[1:15] shaken on this glorious Foundation While
[1:19] others
[1:22] fall here
[1:24] [Music]
[1:28] I
[1:30] I know you said I know you said there's
[1:35] a great falling away I know they try I
[1:40] know they try to
[1:43] complicate what you say but in my soul
[1:47] but in my soul I'm sure of the rock I
[1:51] stand upon one thing I know one I know I
[1:57] will press all
[2:02] your truth is word I follow and it'll
[2:06] still be true
[2:08] tomorrow what I believe was not the work
[2:12] of
[2:16] me his kingdom can be
[2:20] shaken on this glorious Foundation While
[2:24] others
[2:27] fall here I stand
[2:32] on Christ
[2:35] the Rock I stand all of the ground is
[2:41] seeking
[2:44] stand all
[2:46] others
[2:48] others
[2:50] others others fall While
[2:53] others Love is Here I Stand Here I Stand
[3:01] your truth is word I
[3:04] follow it'll still be true
[3:07] tomorrow what I believe was not the work
[3:11] of
[3:15] any his kingdom can't be
[3:19] shaken this glorious Foundation While
[3:23] others
[3:26] fall here I stand
[3:31] While
[3:34] others here I
[3:39] stand Luke 10 and verse
[3:42] 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his
[3:46] spirit I like reading that praise the
[3:49] Lord there's there's another place that
[3:51] Jesus was troubled in his Spirit the
[3:53] night he was with Judas so Jesus had a
[3:56] spirit and it kind of sometimes was
[3:58] affected his Soul wasn't affected but
[4:01] his Spirit was affected he was troubled
[4:03] in his Spirit but here I want you to
[4:05] notice Jesus was rejoicing in his spirit
[4:08] makes you curious to know what he was
[4:10] rejoicing about in that hour Jesus
[4:12] rejoiced in his spirit and said I thank
[4:14] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[4:17] that thou has hid these things from the
[4:19] wise and The Prudent and Hast revealed
[4:22] them unto babes even so father for so it
[4:26] seemed good in thy sight so it makes the
[4:29] it made Christ rejoice and this is
[4:31] something that triggers and moves the
[4:33] heart of God and that is when he can
[4:36] reveal himself not through intellect but
[4:40] by Revelation and he can show his elect
[4:43] the hidden things Mark
[4:47] 4:10 and when he was alone they that
[4:51] were about him with the 12 ask him of
[4:54] him the parable because he had just
[4:56] given a parable when he was alone with
[4:58] his disciples they asked him about the
[5:00] parable and he said unto them unto you
[5:03] it is given to know the mystery of the
[5:06] kingdom of God but unto them that are
[5:09] without all these things are done in
[5:13] Parables now notice the way he's saying
[5:15] it now is that is that there will be
[5:17] ones who catch the mystery the secret
[5:20] there will be ones who are called to
[5:22] catch the father's hidden Mystery of it
[5:25] and there will be ones that are called
[5:27] just to take the par Parable and see the
[5:30] parable and I don't know how all that
[5:32] fits as far as who's in what category
[5:35] I'm not I'm not allowed to put people in
[5:37] categories but there's a truth laying
[5:39] here that the mystery the secret he says
[5:43] it's given to the elect to know the
[5:46] secret the mystery singular mystery
[5:48] there and so he he says it that way in
[5:51] verse 10 um excuse me verse chapter 4
[5:54] and verse 10 and so he says it's unto
[5:56] you is given to know the mystery of the
[5:57] kingdom of God but unto them that are
[5:59] without all these things are done in
[6:03] Parables that seeing they may see and
[6:07] not perceive and hearing they may hear
[6:10] and not understand lest at any time they
[6:13] should be converted and their sins
[6:15] should be forgiven them and it's the
[6:17] mystery of the Kingdom that's given to
[6:19] the elect it's the singular Mysteries
[6:22] I'm going to pull out a few words here
[6:24] that I'll be speaking on but he says
[6:26] it's given to you to know the mystery
[6:28] now we would think the Mysteries plural
[6:30] in other words there's Mysteries of the
[6:32] kingdom of God there's principles of the
[6:35] kingdom of God and uh and we know that
[6:38] Jesus had many things to say about the
[6:41] kingdom children and how they live uh
[6:44] examples are when he when he brought The
[6:46] Parables and The Parables Express
[6:48] revelation of the last days The Parables
[6:50] Express how to live in The Parables is
[6:53] written something but it has to do
[6:55] sometimes of how the children live and
[6:57] then you have the Sermon on the Mount
[6:58] which to me is preaching to the people
[7:01] principles of the Kingdom how the
[7:03] children of the Kingdom live you know
[7:05] what he talks about swimming on the
[7:06] mount uh turn the other cheek you know
[7:09] someone hits you turn the other cheek to
[7:11] them if if uh uh if he talks about lust
[7:15] and he talks about loving your enemies
[7:17] and he says be ye there per for perfect
[7:19] as your father's Heaven is perfect be
[7:21] the CH the children of the Kingdom so in
[7:24] all of those things there's numerous
[7:26] mysteries about how the kingdom children
[7:30] live and how they the principles they
[7:32] live by and they're opposite of the what
[7:34] the world teaches you how many know that
[7:36] Kingdom principles in finances in living
[7:39] in marriage every subject will be
[7:42] different than the wisdom of the world
[7:44] and so we cannot take our cues from the
[7:46] wisdom of the world but Kingdom children
[7:48] how many raise your hand and say I'm a
[7:50] kingdom child of God and I'm interested
[7:52] in the things of the Kingdom so so we
[7:55] live different and Jesus taught us we
[7:57] live different so I want you to know
[7:59] this it's not that we don't have
[8:01] Mysteries plural and principles plural
[8:04] of the kingdom of God but when he says
[8:07] it's given unto you know he says it's
[8:09] given to you know the singular the
[8:12] mystery so all of those things of living
[8:14] the principles of the Kingdom actually
[8:17] come back to one mystery that God is
[8:20] trying to get to
[8:22] you that's why to me the gospel is not
[8:25] complicated that's why the message is
[8:28] not complicated to me
[8:29] because when people become overwhelmed
[8:31] said I got to do this and I got to do
[8:33] that and I got to do this and they they
[8:34] make it all this overwhelming thing I
[8:36] want to tell you tonight the father is
[8:38] actually trying to only get one main
[8:40] thing to
[8:41] you the father has been trying to get
[8:45] one secret one mystery to you and when
[8:48] that comes to you when the father gets
[8:50] it to you then you have something that
[8:53] just opens it all up and now the kingdom
[8:56] you're living in the kingdom and the
[8:58] kingdom principles and the Mysteries
[9:00] everything be begins to open from there
[9:02] but if we go backwards and try to live
[9:04] just Kingdom principles and we block the
[9:07] father from getting the one main secret
[9:10] that we need the one mystery that we
[9:12] need then we're missing something huge
[9:15] because it's really one I know this is
[9:17] going to be strange to say this but
[9:18] there's because we we think God has so
[9:21] many things to show us and he has so
[9:23] many preachers and brother brother Paul
[9:25] has so many preachers coming in and
[9:27] there's so much that God wants us to no
[9:29] that's true but I want to tell you
[9:30] tonight God actually is trying to get
[9:32] you one main mystery and it's given for
[9:37] you to know it that's right amen does
[9:41] that just help you settle down a little
[9:42] bit and feel more peaceful but he he's
[9:46] but he's trying to get a a hidden
[9:49] Mystery to you and uh so uh there's
[9:53] multiple
[9:54] teachings and the message that God sent
[9:56] in the last days has multiple things of
[9:59] of how a Believer lives never has there
[10:01] been a message to our generation that's
[10:03] so specific H and there's so much of it
[10:06] there and yet here it's worded he's it's
[10:09] given to you to know the mystery
[10:11] singular of the Kingdom so really
[10:13] there's one main secret he's trying to
[10:16] get to you he's trying to bring the
[10:19] thoughts of it behind the mighty acts of
[10:21] God he's trying to bring the thought of
[10:24] God to you he's trying to bring his
[10:25] thoughts and brother strw was on that
[10:27] that brother Steven Sunday and what
[10:29] wonderful message we had what a a thing
[10:32] to cause us to deep to think more deeply
[10:35] than we should because he mentioned one
[10:37] statement this is the way he said it he
[10:39] said the thought the thought is the
[10:40] father of the word he said the attribute
[10:43] and I just I went back and listen to
[10:45] Just the part I had written it on my
[10:47] notes but this the way brother Steven
[10:49] said it the attribute of God that was in
[10:51] God before the foundation the attribute
[10:53] you an attribute gives rise to a thought
[10:57] the thought is the father of the
[10:59] word then it's a word so it's attribute
[11:03] it's thought it's word the thought is
[11:05] the father of the word we look in the
[11:07] scripture and say the Father the father
[11:09] and we get in our minds you know some
[11:11] some visible thing but Jesus says Jesus
[11:14] says you can't see the
[11:16] father so don't get into this say father
[11:18] and then Solomon come up here it's a
[11:20] father and son and two separate persons
[11:22] you can't look at it that way I love it
[11:25] when he says that the Revelation because
[11:26] the thought is the father of the word
[11:29] Jesus said no man has seen the father
[11:32] but the son expresses him and the son is
[11:34] the word so the son expresses the father
[11:37] in every generation the son is the word
[11:40] expressed Jesus Christ and the father is
[11:43] the thought of the word and so he says
[11:45] the attribute gives R rise to a thought
[11:48] thank you brother Stephen I know you're
[11:49] listening tonight God bless you the the
[11:51] attribute gives right rise to the
[11:53] thought the thought is the father of the
[11:55] word then it's a word the spoken word
[11:58] then becomes manifested and the
[12:00] manifestation is the image of the
[12:03] Heavenly amen that's powerful and I like
[12:06] how he said it it loses nothing in the
[12:09] process
[12:11] right glory be to God from the attribute
[12:15] to it passes down to it gets to the
[12:18] Manifest manifested thought to the the
[12:21] expressing the image of the Heavenly
[12:22] nothing is lost in the process and when
[12:25] it manifests in you and I brothers and
[12:27] sisters when it comes out in you I it's
[12:29] the original thought and the original
[12:31] attribute that God said that you would
[12:33] be it loses nothing in the process now
[12:35] everything man creates it loses in the
[12:38] process it's hybrid can you say Amen but
[12:41] God's original thought of you you are in
[12:43] the mind of God in the process of
[12:45] thought can you say amen and then it's
[12:47] word can you say amen and then it's
[12:49] manifested and then it's bearing the
[12:51] image of the Heavenly it never loses its
[12:54] effect and never loses anything from it
[12:57] God has his time for you amen and if
[12:59] it's within a year of coming to truth if
[13:02] it's the very night you come to truth or
[13:04] if it's 20 years later if you're one of
[13:07] God's Sons and Daughters he's going to
[13:09] bring it to you he's going to keep
[13:10] trying that's why we can't have
[13:12] unrealistic expectations of people
[13:14] because everybody has a different time
[13:16] that they come that's why I said a few
[13:17] Sundays ago is that you got people
[13:19] realizing that they have don't have the
[13:21] new birth some people and they're
[13:23] discovering wow I'm lacking the the most
[13:25] important thing in my life but you know
[13:27] what praise the Lord
[13:29] praise the Lord and you can preach the
[13:32] greatest sermons but I can tell you that
[13:35] heart isn't coming to repentance until
[13:38] God leads them to repentance
[13:42] right you can hear the best preaching in
[13:44] the world but if your heart isn't
[13:46] repentant and broken and God doesn't
[13:48] move on you that you're sitting there
[13:49] and it's like water off a deck's back
[13:52] right you're not getting what you need
[13:54] to get it's not the father getting that
[13:56] hidden secret to you it's all religion
[13:58] it's all put on it's all being forced
[14:00] listen friends the father's trying to
[14:02] get his hidden secret to you that's what
[14:05] needs to
[14:06] happen but people can go 10 years 20
[14:09] years 30 years and all of a sudden bang
[14:11] something happens in their lives that's
[14:13] why you have to be patient with people
[14:15] pastors have to be more patient than
[14:17] anybody because I'm looking for
[14:18] everybody to be saved and filled with
[14:20] the Holy Ghost in one
[14:22] service I would love it amen but but I
[14:26] don't orchestrate this it's whether the
[14:28] father leads you to
[14:29] repentance see you can open your heart
[14:31] more can you say Amen but the Bible says
[14:34] it's God that leads you to repentance
[14:37] you don't even have anything to do with
[14:38] that he has to break that heart and
[14:40] listen if you go and buck up against it
[14:42] for years God's got your number that's
[14:45] right God's got your number God loves
[14:48] you enough and whatever time he moves on
[14:50] you he will use anything that he needs
[14:53] to use to get a hold of your
[14:56] heart and it's amazing what God uses
[14:59] sometimes to bring a person to True
[15:02] repentance but your children and your
[15:05] loved ones you're praying for you keep
[15:07] praying because they have their season
[15:10] that I'm not worried tonight about the
[15:12] economy can you say amen I I'm I'm
[15:14] worried about me being in tune with God
[15:18] more than the economy can you say Amen
[15:21] one fell I was reading last week said
[15:23] I'm not worried about the world's
[15:24] economy I've got a hairline that's in
[15:27] recession I've got belly that's in
[15:29] inflation and I'm in
[15:33] depression so I'm not worried about the
[15:35] world's economy I'm worried about me I'm
[15:38] concerned about me can you say amen I I
[15:41] don't want to be a distraction to what
[15:42] the Lord's trying to get to me can you
[15:45] agree tonight how many years we go
[15:48] through our life and we let things
[15:49] distract us from the father trying to
[15:51] get that secret to us trying to get
[15:53] something to us we're we're the culprit
[15:56] we're the one that stops it up but if I
[15:58] could just just be released of all my
[15:59] cares and take my worries to the Cross
[16:02] can you say Amen say God I'm going to
[16:03] let you take care of that I'm going to
[16:05] work I'm going to try to plan my
[16:06] finances but I'm going to let you take
[16:08] care I'm not going to be worried about
[16:09] the cares of life as he said to cast
[16:12] your worries and cares upon Him He gave
[16:15] you permission to take your worries
[16:17] about this life and pray and cast it on
[16:20] him and he's going to work it out why
[16:23] because he has another Main Event the
[16:25] economy your finances is not the main
[16:27] event it's like that scripture that says
[16:29] money anth all things you know what that
[16:32] means money it's in Proverbs money
[16:33] answer it means the end of every
[16:35] conversation is money that's the world
[16:38] we live in is the worry of money the
[16:40] worry of the economy the money anth all
[16:43] things and I'm here to tell you it
[16:44] doesn't answer all things it's not the
[16:46] main event it's not the most important
[16:48] thing in your life if you didn't have a
[16:50] dime and God was getting this secret to
[16:52] you then you'd be happy in the Lord can
[16:55] somebody say praise the Lord if you
[16:57] didn't have a house to live in if you
[16:58] didn't have a dime tonight if the father
[17:01] was getting that secret through to you
[17:03] and you were filled with the spirit of
[17:04] God living close to him you're a
[17:07] millionaire can you say amen that's the
[17:09] main event that's the main thing in our
[17:12] lives you let so many things get out of
[17:14] you your job the money your wife your
[17:17] pastor you let so many things why
[17:20] because you're letting that be the main
[17:22] event but this is the main event is the
[17:25] father trying to get his secret to you I
[17:28] want you to go to Exodus
[17:29] 19 and exodus 19 of course is the
[17:33] scripture after the the the children of
[17:36] Israel had come out of Egypt and uh they
[17:39] had come across the desert and they had
[17:41] went through the different things and
[17:43] God perform miracles for them and many
[17:46] things happened then all of a sudden
[17:49] then when all that was uh kind of come
[17:51] to an end then there's there was an
[17:53] event here that uh in the process of the
[17:56] children of Israel sh several years down
[17:59] the road there's a process with the
[18:01] children of Israel that was something
[18:02] very huge that was going to happen now
[18:04] and I'll just tell you what is Exodus 19
[18:07] is when God begins the process of
[18:09] bringing coming descending upon a
[18:12] mountain and descending to the people
[18:14] for the purpose of bringing his word to
[18:16] them now that's the first part we know
[18:18] he's going to bring his word to the
[18:19] people now he has been a god of Miracles
[18:22] he's been a God that's put Pharaoh's
[18:24] Army in the Red Sea he's been a God
[18:26] that's spoken through his Prophet he's
[18:28] he's been a God that's provided bread
[18:29] when they needed food he's been a God
[18:31] that's provided water when they needed
[18:33] water he's been a God that's provided a
[18:35] place for them to live even though they
[18:37] come across the desert he's been a God
[18:39] that they know that has many mighty acts
[18:42] but you see now friends God will not God
[18:46] has an agenda he has a purpose he wants
[18:48] to get something to us and so now in
[18:51] this process he stops and he's going to
[18:53] bring something through Moses from the
[18:56] mountain and he's going to bring his
[18:57] word to the people but tonight I'm
[18:59] hoping the Lord will help me and let you
[19:01] see what the purpose of all of it was
[19:04] because it's not even that he would give
[19:06] us all of his word to live by and you
[19:08] just hold on you'll understand that in a
[19:10] minute so after several years let's read
[19:12] in Exodus 19 and break it down after
[19:14] several years of the process with God
[19:16] now he comes to this huge moment and
[19:18] there have been public displays of God
[19:20] Israel has seen firsthand many things I
[19:23] want to say to you they have been
[19:24] keeping up the lamb since Abraham he had
[19:28] they the people had been taught to keep
[19:29] the lamb up so you realize when he says
[19:32] that statement they had been keeping up
[19:34] the lamb he's talking about 2,000 years
[19:37] of church history that they have been
[19:39] believing in the lamb Jesus
[19:42] Christ they've been keeping up the lamb
[19:45] but this word coming from the mountain
[19:47] was something something deeper than that
[19:51] to bring us into a mystery deeper than
[19:53] that than just knowing that the lamb cuz
[19:56] they were bringing the lamb they had
[19:57] they had missed the Lost circumcision
[19:59] when they were in Egypt so when they
[20:01] come under uh in the land and come into
[20:03] Joshua then they brought back
[20:04] circumcision but tonight I want you to
[20:07] notice this event and here's let's just
[20:09] read it in the third month when the
[20:11] children of Israel were gone forth out
[20:12] of the land of Egypt the same day came
[20:15] they Into the Wilderness of siai Mount
[20:18] Si for they were departed from rehim and
[20:22] were come to the desert of Si and had
[20:24] pitched in the wilderness and there
[20:26] Israel camped before for the mount so
[20:29] they're camping right beside Mount siani
[20:32] and there's a purpose in that because
[20:34] God's going to do a different event now
[20:36] okay and Moses went up unto God and the
[20:40] Lord called unto him out of the mountain
[20:43] saying thus shalt thou say to the house
[20:45] of Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[20:48] so God in the mountain tells Moses to
[20:52] tell the CH children of Israel this
[20:56] principal God is going to speak to his
[20:59] people through a
[21:02] prophet don't you dare try to train
[21:05] change that
[21:07] process he didn't change it in Jesus
[21:09] Christ Jesus was the ultimate prophet he
[21:12] was the god
[21:13] Prophet but he said I'm going to speak
[21:16] and so here's what he said to the people
[21:17] verse four ye have seen what I did unto
[21:20] the
[21:21] Egyptians so you know that's a message
[21:23] when itself and there's some brothers
[21:24] more capable than me than bringing that
[21:26] whole thing of looking back and miam
[21:29] Granda and the tambourine when you see
[21:32] dead Egyptians floating in the water an
[21:35] entire Army that they were afraid and
[21:36] running from and you're looking no
[21:38] wonder miam grabbed the
[21:40] tambourine because you look back and see
[21:43] all the things that your habits all the
[21:45] things that are there floating in the
[21:48] Dead Sea dead can you say amen I tell
[21:51] you God knows how to deal with your
[21:52] enemy God knows how to deal with your
[21:54] habits what a rejoicing that was to look
[21:57] back and grab the tambourine and Shout a
[21:59] little bit because they can look and see
[22:00] that's all finished now and it's done oh
[22:04] my that's wonderful but he that's the
[22:05] first thing he says ye have seen what I
[22:07] did under the Egyptians and how I bear
[22:10] you on Eagle wings and brought you unto
[22:14] who myself so now we're starting to get
[22:17] a picture of the mystery we're starting
[22:20] to get a picture of the purpose in all
[22:22] this God calling a prophet God bringing
[22:24] him out of Egypt which you know is a
[22:26] type of the world type of denom ations
[22:28] the call in Revelations 19 I believe it
[22:30] is to come out of her my people to come
[22:32] out of church systems to the genuine
[22:35] atonement to the the truth to full truth
[22:37] instead of limited Truth by
[22:38] denominations I I pray every person
[22:40] would pray about that because there's a
[22:42] calling to come out come out to full
[22:44] truth can you say am maam in the last
[22:46] days especially so so now you see then
[22:49] uh I brought you but but what's the what
[22:53] watch the mystery now I brought you unto
[22:56] myself there's a reason reason that God
[22:59] got rid of Israel's enemy there's a
[23:02] reason that God delivers you there's a
[23:05] reason that you take you he takes you
[23:08] under his wings how many can say when
[23:10] you come to the Lord he just took me
[23:12] under his wings of protection I've been
[23:15] protected from things that I didn't even
[23:16] know I needed protection from but in the
[23:18] word God is watching over his people how
[23:21] many's under his wings
[23:23] tonight he's letting the people know
[23:25] it's been me in all this I destroyed
[23:28] Pharaoh's Army I destroyed your enemy
[23:31] and now you're under my wings and all of
[23:33] it had a reason to bring you to myself
[23:38] yes now therefore if you will obey my
[23:41] voice
[23:42] indeed and keep my Covenant then ye
[23:45] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[23:49] above all
[23:51] people what is this
[23:53] mystery it's about them it's about who
[23:57] they are yes right I'm setting you apart
[24:01] you're not like the world you're a
[24:03] peculiar people Paul picks it up in the
[24:05] in the new testimony he says you're a
[24:07] royal priesthood you're a holy nation A
[24:09] peculiar people I'm calling you listen
[24:13] there's there's there's nothing here in
[24:15] this mystery there's nothing here about
[24:17] God doing the Miracles and God
[24:19] displaying himself and God showing to
[24:21] the world his mightiness this is getting
[24:24] closer to what God does it for and
[24:26] that's to draw you into the Third pole
[24:28] draw you unto himself can you say Amen
[24:31] draw you into being a peculiar treasure
[24:34] For Me Above All people for all the
[24:37] Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a
[24:39] kingdom of priests and a holy nation
[24:43] these are the words which Thou shalt
[24:45] speak unto the children of Israel so I'm
[24:47] going to come back to that in a minute
[24:48] okay but Moses came and let me just skip
[24:51] yeah Moses came and called for the
[24:52] Elders of the people laid before their
[24:54] faces all these words which the Lord
[24:56] commanded and all the people answered
[24:57] together and said all the Lord has
[24:59] spoken we will do and Moses returned the
[25:01] words of the people unto the Lord and
[25:02] the Lord said unto Moses lo I come unto
[25:04] thee in a thick
[25:06] Cloud the the Lord said unto Moses I'm
[25:10] coming to you in a thick Cloud that the
[25:13] people may hear when I speak with thee
[25:15] and believe thee forever and Moses told
[25:17] the words unto the people moving on you
[25:20] still with me the and the Lord said unto
[25:22] Moses go unto the people and sanctify
[25:24] them today and tomorrow and let them
[25:26] wash their clothes and be ready against
[25:29] the third day now I want you to notice
[25:30] this I've been preaching on the third
[25:32] the three being the mystery I've been
[25:34] preaching on uh Elijah having three
[25:37] parts okay the the first part is Mount
[25:40] Carmel the second part was the juniper
[25:42] tree but the third part is when the
[25:44] really mystery was revealed and the
[25:46] third part and that was in the cave when
[25:48] he says I'm not in the earthquake I'm
[25:49] not in the wind but I'm in a still Small
[25:53] Voice he called them to the mountain in
[25:55] the third month and on on the third
[25:58] day and he begins to do this the Lord
[26:01] will for the third day the Lord will
[26:02] come down in the sight of all the people
[26:06] upon Mount Si on the third day I will
[26:09] descend upon the
[26:12] mountain skip to verse uh 15 and he said
[26:16] unto the people be ready against the
[26:18] third day come not at your wives there's
[26:20] the third day again and it come it'll
[26:22] come to pass on the third day in the
[26:23] morning that there were Thunders and it
[26:26] came to pass excuse me it came to pass
[26:28] on the third day in the morning that
[26:30] there were Thunders and Lightnings and a
[26:33] thick Cloud upon the mountain and a
[26:36] voice of the trumpet exceeding loud said
[26:38] that all the people that was in the camp
[26:41] trembled and the mo Moses brought forth
[26:43] the people out of the camp to meet with
[26:45] God and they stood at the nether part of
[26:46] the mount and Mount Si was all together
[26:49] a smoke because the Lord had descended
[26:53] that's
[26:54] right the Lord descended upon that
[26:58] mountain in Fire and the smoke thereof
[27:00] ascended as the smoke of a furnace and
[27:02] the whole Mount Quake greatly and when
[27:04] the voice of the trumpet SED along and
[27:05] the wax louder and louder Moses spake
[27:08] and God answered him by a what a voice
[27:13] now I I I want to simplify this even for
[27:16] the children would be listening I I want
[27:18] to I want to take out of this I want to
[27:20] draw out of this some elements simple
[27:23] elements of
[27:25] this uh ascending from God for the
[27:29] purpose of drawing the people to himself
[27:32] not that they're caught up in a miracle
[27:34] not that they're caught up in the
[27:35] Supernatural but now for the purpose of
[27:37] bringing his word to the people for the
[27:40] purpose of drawing and making them
[27:42] priest he knows in Revelations 5 they
[27:46] begin to worship when the book was open
[27:48] when the lamb took the book he says Thou
[27:50] Hast made us Kings and Priests right so
[27:54] what's this mystery about this mystery
[27:56] is not about what God displays this is
[27:58] not about the public show of God this is
[28:01] what he's making the people into this is
[28:04] what this is an identity can you say man
[28:06] this is revealing the mystery of who you
[28:08] are thank you for watching our message
