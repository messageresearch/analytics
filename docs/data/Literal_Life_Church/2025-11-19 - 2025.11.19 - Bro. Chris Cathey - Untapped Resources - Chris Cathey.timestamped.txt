[33:09] love you. We appreciate you, brother
[33:11] Paul. And I just feel at home tonight.
[33:14] We missed [music] you. And just want to
[33:16] tell you we love you with God's love.
[33:18] And uh let's sing that song. Um just the
[33:21] chorus. I'm in this message by grace.
[33:24] Oh, you know that. You know how to play
[33:25] it or no? Sorry. Okay, never mind. Well,
[33:29] tried. God bless you. God bless you
[33:31] musicians, everybody tonight. Let's just
[33:34] open the word and I just don't want to
[33:36] hold you too late, but just want to
[33:38] speak what God has on on my heart and
[33:41] may he just come in your aisle tonight
[33:43] and may he give you what you have need
[33:46] of tonight. It's all good. Genesis to
[33:48] Revelation. It's all good.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you for everything. Thanks,
[33:52] brother Ike and the musician, the the
[33:54] sound people back there. And
[33:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[33:57] &gt;&gt; uh we just appreciate everybody. God
[33:59] bless you. So just want to turn tonight
[34:01] for to just to second Corinthians uh
[34:04] chapter 4. 2 Corinthians chapter 4. I
[34:08] just want to read this uh check 2
[34:11] Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1. It
[34:14] [snorts] says therefore seeing we have
[34:18] this ministry as we have received mercy
[34:21] we faint not.
[34:23] Verse two, it says, "But have reconciled
[34:27] the hidden things of dishonesty,
[34:29] not walking in craftness, nor handling
[34:32] the word of God deceitfully, but by
[34:35] manifestation of the truth, commending
[34:37] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[34:40] the sight of God." Verse three, but if
[34:43] our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
[34:46] that are lost. In whom the God of this
[34:50] world hath blinded the minds of them
[34:53] which believe not, least the light of of
[34:57] the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
[34:59] the image of God, should shine unto
[35:01] them. Verse five, for we preach not of
[35:05] ourselves, I say amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; But Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves
[35:11] your servants for Jesus' sake. For God
[35:14] who commandeth the light to shine out of
[35:17] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[35:20] give the light of knowledge of the glory
[35:23] of God in the face of Jesus Christ. In
[35:26] verse seven, I just kind of want to
[35:28] speak on this tonight. But we have the
[35:31] this treasure in earth and vessels that
[35:35] the excellency of the power may be of
[35:37] God and not of us.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Would you say amen that tonight? Let's
[35:40] just go to him in prayer. Father, we
[35:43] just come before you humbly, Father,
[35:45] asking you would speak to us tonight.
[35:47] May you get me out of the way, Father,
[35:49] and we just come in your channel. Only
[35:52] you would speak what you'd have to speak
[35:54] to your bride tonight. I'm so thankful
[35:56] for everyone that's here. We love him
[35:58] dearly. May you bless Brother Paul and
[36:00] all he's done is faithfulness, Lord, so
[36:03] many years, Father, and just bless his
[36:04] family, Father. May you bless this
[36:07] church and bless the community, Father,
[36:09] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be
[36:13] seated. I just want to speak a few
[36:15] minutes on this verse. I was reading it
[36:17] the other week. And verse seven says,
[36:19] "But we have this excellency uh this
[36:22] treasure in earth and vessels that this
[36:24] excellency of the power may be of God
[36:27] and not of us." And I and I started to
[36:30] think in this message, Brother Brandham,
[36:32] I I kind of got this where brother
[36:34] Brandham, he would go on to say, he
[36:36] would say this in this message, taking
[36:38] God at his word. He said, "Brother, I
[36:40] tell you, he says un we have untapped
[36:44] resources of God, it hangs before us."
[36:48] He said, "Where all things are possible,
[36:50] it's a shame that men keep looking back
[36:53] this way instead of looking that way."
[36:56] And he goes on to say that Jesus said in
[36:58] St. uh St. St. Matthew the 13th chapter,
[37:02] we are a swer that went forth and sewed
[37:04] the seeds and someone would come behind
[37:06] him and the enemy would sew seow weeds
[37:09] and and the husbandman said, "Shall I
[37:12] put should I should I pull them up?" And
[37:14] he said, "Then they let them both grow
[37:16] grow together and and he says at that
[37:18] day I'll make the decision. The angels
[37:20] will come and take out the wheat and so
[37:23] forth and burn the tears out the fire."
[37:25] Now, he said we're always talking about
[37:28] how wicked the world is. That's true.
[37:31] He says, "But how women smok and
[37:33] cigarettes and men and drinking and
[37:35] wallowing in slop and beer and stuff."
[37:37] He said, "The way they're doing today is
[37:39] sin on every hand." He said, "Churches
[37:42] and ministers and all, smoking,
[37:44] drinking, gambling, running to parties
[37:46] and picture shows, dancing, hell drives,
[37:49] and everything else." He said, "But we
[37:51] all talk about how wicked that is." He
[37:53] said, "But we're always looking to
[37:55] that." He said, "But that's the wheat."
[37:59] He said, "But but let me tell you
[38:01] something, brother. You forget to know."
[38:03] He says, "The church is growing up at
[38:06] the same time."
[38:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you, amen to that. Tonight, we
[38:10] got to we we get into a place and I just
[38:13] want to speak a few minutes on untapped
[38:15] resources.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Untapped resources. And I believe we
[38:19] live in a time that the devil points you
[38:21] to everything but God. He points you to
[38:24] this circumstance and this trial and and
[38:27] and he keeps you busy in life and we
[38:30] forget to know that God is doing
[38:32] something today. And you know, you might
[38:34] think what God's done in the in the in
[38:36] the past or what he's going to do in the
[38:37] future, but we got to realize what God's
[38:40] doing now, what God is doing now. And we
[38:43] get to a place in our life where we we
[38:45] look at the weed and we go, "Well, you
[38:47] know what? Guess what? It's it's going
[38:48] to grow out here." I'm here to tell you
[38:50] I put in artificial turf and you
[38:52] probably know that the weed will still
[38:54] find a way somehow to come up through
[38:56] that turf.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; But still there's beauty on the outside
[38:59] and beauty on the inside. And I'm here
[39:01] to tell you even though you see that
[39:03] going on, we are blessed people today.
[39:06] God has called you out. God has put you,
[39:09] in other words, you've been you are
[39:11] sitting in heavenly places tonight. you.
[39:14] Each and every one of us are the bride
[39:16] of Christ is sitting in heavenly places
[39:18] and we have untapped resources
[39:21] &gt;&gt; and we live in a place that you know the
[39:24] devil wants to to to push it down and oh
[39:26] well brother you're this and that. Well,
[39:28] you know what? We're all sons and
[39:30] daughters of a king.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you I just like
[39:33] that where it says in verse 7, but we
[39:35] have this treasure in earth and vessels
[39:37] that the ecstasy of the power may be of
[39:39] God and not of us. Verse eight, I pray
[39:42] this encourages you tonight. Verse
[39:44] eight, it says, "But we are troubled on
[39:47] every side." Would you say that?
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Yet not distressed. It says, "We are
[39:52] perplexed but not in despair." Aren't
[39:54] you thankful for the word of God?
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say, he says in verse
[39:58] uh nine, "Persecuted, but what? But not
[40:02] forsaken. Cast down but not destroyed."
[40:05] Oh my, this the the the book is full of
[40:08] promises tonight, brother Henry. It says
[40:10] verse uh 10, always bearing about the
[40:13] body and dying of the Lord Jesus, that
[40:15] the life also of Jesus might be made
[40:18] manifest in our body.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; For we which live are away, delivered
[40:23] unto his death to Jesus' sake, that the
[40:25] life also of Jesus might be made
[40:27] manifest in our mortal flesh. So then
[40:30] death workketh in us, but life in you.
[40:34] Oh, I love that. Tonight he said we had
[40:37] the we having the same spirit of faith
[40:39] according as written. I believed and it
[40:42] says and therefore I have spoken. We
[40:44] also believe and therefore speak. Verse
[40:46] 14 it says knowing that we knowing that
[40:50] he he which raised the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:53] from all us also but g by Jesus and
[40:58] shall present us with you. And he says
[41:01] verse 15, for all things are for his for
[41:03] your sakes that the abundant grace might
[41:06] through the thanksgiving of many
[41:08] redounded. And it says to the glory of
[41:10] God. I'm building to this tonight. It
[41:12] says, "For which cause we faint not, but
[41:15] through our outward man perish, yet the
[41:18] inward man is renewed day by day." It's
[41:21] [snorts] it's it's a daily process. And
[41:24] how do we get that? You see, Brother
[41:25] Chris, Brother Paul, how do we brother
[41:27] Brandon, how do we get that? It's a
[41:29] renewing. It's a dying out every single
[41:31] day. I just because I got a tie on
[41:34] doesn't mean anything. I'm just a same
[41:36] like you. But it's a daily walk with
[41:38] Jesus Christ. It's a It's Who are you
[41:41] feeding the most tonight? It's the
[41:43] inward man. We want to listen to
[41:44] Facebook and Instagram and all these
[41:47] things. But I tell you tonight, get in
[41:49] these resources. Get in the resources of
[41:52] God. God has opened the entire book to
[41:54] you tonight from Genesis to Revelation.
[41:57] And it's a time to tap into your
[41:59] resource and say, "God, I want more of
[42:02] you, Lord. I want I, you know, the sick
[42:05] can be healed. Whatever you have
[42:07] tonight, you can be healed instantly. It
[42:09] might take over time. It might be day by
[42:11] day. But keep every inch, possess your
[42:15] land.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Every single inch, possess your land."
[42:18] Maybe you just feel like, "Brother, I'm
[42:20] barely making it." But you're you're
[42:21] here to church tonight saying, "I'm
[42:23] pressing on." Maybe it feels like I'm
[42:25] going 2 in or I'm going three inches.
[42:28] But I'm here to tell you, you need to
[42:30] tap into the resources that you've been
[42:32] laid before you from the foundation of
[42:35] the world.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it says in verse 17, for our
[42:40] light affliction which is for a moment
[42:43] workketh for us a far more excellency in
[42:46] eternity weight of God. Verse 18. While
[42:48] we look not at the things which are
[42:51] seen, but the things which are not seen.
[42:54] And I and you you witness this when
[42:56] you're out, brother Kenny, and you're
[42:57] out at the gas station, or I know when
[42:59] CO hit, Brother Paul, and you would just
[43:01] be at the pump. I travel more when CO
[43:04] hit in the land. And I'm not saying it
[43:05] wasn't a virus, but I tell you what, we
[43:08] have a God bigger than your cancer. We
[43:10] have a God bigger than your diabetes. We
[43:12] got a God bigger than your anxiety. And
[43:15] I'm here to tell you, you got to tap
[43:17] into the resources that God has gave
[43:19] you.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, brother Tony, he
[43:24] says, which we have not seen, for things
[43:26] which are seen are temporal, but the
[43:28] things which are not seen are eternal.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm thankful tonight. May I wasn't
[43:32] in brother Arab's meetings, but I'm here
[43:34] to tell you, I was there before the
[43:36] foundation of the world, and you were
[43:38] too today. He's called you from the
[43:40] found. He came looking for you. And I'm
[43:43] here to tell you to tap into the
[43:44] resources that he's gave you today. The
[43:47] entire book has been opened before you.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; The entire book from Genesis, not just
[43:54] on a shelf, not for these tapes
[43:56] just to sit on a go get dusty. We have
[43:59] them on our app. We have them on an
[44:00] iPad. We have them everywhere. But it's
[44:03] time even young people to get into the
[44:05] word. Get into these resources that you
[44:08] have. Right. Praise the Lord.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; But I like what Ephesians 3:20 says. It
[44:15] says, "Now unto him that is able to do
[44:18] exce exceedingly abundantly all above
[44:21] all that we ask or think according to
[44:24] the power."
[44:26] &gt;&gt; And it says, "The power that workketh
[44:27] what? In us."
[44:29] &gt;&gt; In us. You know, God, uh, you know, you
[44:32] are the branches tonight. you know,
[44:35] you're connected to the vine and you
[44:37] we're the more you read, the more you
[44:39] push out, the more you the more you stay
[44:41] in the word. You know, people's like,
[44:42] "Well, how you got so good of faith,
[44:44] Chris?" It's not because I just build it
[44:46] up. It's because the hearing of his word
[44:48] daily stay in the word saying, "God, I
[44:51] want more of you
[44:53] &gt;&gt; and stay in these messages of the hour."
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And then I just looked this up and we're
[44:59] talking about the power of God. And I I
[45:02] read Acts 1:8, which I thought was
[45:04] really good. It says, "But we but ye
[45:07] shall receive power." And I wrote that
[45:10] word beside power. I looked that up,
[45:11] "Dunamis."
[45:13] And it says, "After the God Holy Ghost
[45:15] has come upon you, and ye shall be
[45:18] witnesses unto you both in Jerusalem."
[45:20] So, we have work to do. It's just not
[45:23] just sit and say, "I believe a message
[45:24] and I'm going to keep it to me. I'm
[45:26] going to just, oh, well, God revealed
[45:28] the entire book." But I'm here to tell
[45:30] you, he you're the only feet, the only
[45:32] eyes, the only ears, the the only lips
[45:34] that God can use. And he's wanting to
[45:37] use you tonight. And maybe it's on your
[45:39] job or wherever it's at, but just be a
[45:42] light for Jesus Christ.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Just be a light for Jesus Christ. I'm
[45:46] not saying go and blast them with the
[45:48] entire message. They watch the life.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; They watch the life. You don't have to
[45:53] say anything, but just live a life so
[45:56] filled and so connected to your resource
[45:59] that they say, "I want what [screaming]
[46:00] he's got. I want what Brother Kenny's
[46:03] got. I want what he's got."
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you, maybe revive us tonight. Put
[46:11] something in us a little smart. Maybe
[46:12] you're online tonight and you're
[46:13] discouraged. I'm here to tell you to tap
[46:16] into the resource.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:19] But it goes on to say, I wrote I looked
[46:21] that word dunamis up. I thought this was
[46:23] excellent. It says in the word dunamis,
[46:26] the word it says word power. It says
[46:29] dunamis means explosive,
[46:32] dynamite, miracle working energy.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; This is explosive dynamite miracle
[46:42] working energy. I tell you what, no
[46:44] matter what age I get, I want to be a
[46:46] dynamite for him. I want to be a miracle
[46:49] working energy. I want to see people
[46:51] delivered, set free.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's our God.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; That's our God tonight.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; I love that. I like what the prophet of
[47:01] God says. He says, "And Christ is the
[47:03] exaltable fountain of life."
[47:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "We are planted in him by the
[47:08] Holy Spirit." He says, "And then we just
[47:11] listen then just drink from him. Every
[47:13] person that's a Christian, listen, the
[47:16] devil don't care how much you come to
[47:18] Christ.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; He don't care how much you come to
[47:21] Christ. But brother B says, but he cares
[47:24] about how much you drink.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; He don't care how much you come on
[47:28] Wednesdays, how much you show up on
[47:30] Sundays, Brother Kenny. But he does care
[47:32] how much you drink.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; He He He cares about how much you drink.
[47:38] So he don't want you in the book. He
[47:40] don't want you to because he, you know,
[47:41] like he says, Genesis expo, it shows
[47:43] where his beginning and Revelation shows
[47:45] his end. We know what side you're on
[47:48] tonight. And I'm here to tell you, we
[47:50] know we on the winning side.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, he says, the
[47:54] devil don't care how much you come to
[47:56] Christ as long as you don't drink.
[47:59] Listen young people, as long as you
[48:01] don't drink, he wants to keep you on
[48:02] this or this social media or this or
[48:05] that or he wants to keep you so busy not
[48:08] to drink.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Show up on Wednesday.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Show up faithfully on we got we got I
[48:14] mean the message we got 30 years 50
[48:18] years I believe a message but is the
[48:21] message on the inside? Is there a life
[48:23] living in the inside that says I'm ready
[48:26] to go. I'll beat you to church.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I tell you, it's a time to wake
[48:34] up. It's an hour to be happy. It's an
[48:36] hour to be walk around like, "Oh my,
[48:39] brother Paul, I just can't get out of
[48:41] the bed. My back hurts. Next week, my
[48:43] foot hurts." It's always something. But
[48:45] I'm here to tell you, we serve a great
[48:47] God that g that gave you a message of
[48:49] the hour, and he revealed it to you to
[48:52] do something for him. That's
[48:54] &gt;&gt; right. Not just for the ministry, but
[48:56] every leoty alike. You can do something
[48:59] for Jesus Christ. If you're a housewife,
[49:02] you can be the best housewife. You're
[49:04] the Sunday school teacher, you can be
[49:05] the best son. Whatever it is,
[49:08] &gt;&gt; God's called you for a purpose.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, but he goes on to say, he says, you
[49:13] could stand at the table with your mouth
[49:15] watering, say, well, I'm here. I'm here.
[49:18] You're afraid to turn your faith loose.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say in this
[49:23] message, this other message, excuse me.
[49:26] He says, "If you can limit God, you can
[49:29] limit Christ." That's right.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about untapped resources
[49:32] tonight. He says, "And if you limit the
[49:34] church today, its possibilities, you're
[49:37] limiting God."
[49:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "But all things whatsoever you
[49:42] desire when you pray, believe you
[49:43] receive it and you shall have it."
[49:45] Another message, he goes, "Brother, I'm
[49:47] telling you, untapped resource of God
[49:49] hangs before us." Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, and I I
[49:53] think I read this, but he goes on to say
[49:55] for time, he says, "But we Americans,"
[49:57] he said, "we're all wellfed and furied
[50:00] and and feathered, and we sat around,
[50:02] well, my pastor don't believe in that
[50:04] kind of stuff. I'll go over and just
[50:06] just say what now wonder you can't get
[50:09] nowhere." It's the truth. He said, "It's
[50:11] a shame. We don't recognize God and his
[50:14] power and his deity. He's moving."
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say, "It's a
[50:20] shame." Oh, well, we're ready for a
[50:21] judgment and we're and we're sure going
[50:23] to get it. That's right. He said, "My
[50:25] people," he said, "they that that call
[50:27] my name," he said, "if they'll assemble
[50:29] themselves together and pray and then
[50:31] hear from heaven."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; But how can we do that with everything
[50:35] else hanging in the road in our roads
[50:38] and things like that and all these
[50:40] different He goes on to say, he goes,
[50:42] "But poor little America, why? It's a
[50:44] shame." He said, "We got a church on
[50:47] every corner, each pastor fighting." I'm
[50:50] like, "Amen." He says, "I'm afraid to
[50:52] let but" But he said, "Sponsor one of
[50:54] these meetings like that. They'll pull
[50:56] some of some of the people away. Why
[50:58] it's a mill ticket? It's a shame."
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say this. He goes,
[51:03] "But why are you thinking about a mill
[51:05] ticket and million miles yonder dying in
[51:07] heathenism?"
[51:10] He said, "Why? We got preachers hanging
[51:12] all around everywhere, fussing about
[51:14] their little churches and their
[51:15] organizations and tearing up this and
[51:18] that and the other and snorting at one
[51:20] another." He said, "But why? It's a
[51:22] disgrace."
[51:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not fair for one man to
[51:26] hear the gospel twice when one man has
[51:29] heard it at all. Heard it at all."
[51:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's time for somebody to go."
[51:35] He said, "God to move in yonder."
[51:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's time to press to
[51:39] press on. It's time to move forward.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe your past looks really bad. And
[51:45] maybe maybe the devil's telling you and
[51:47] wants you to live. I I could really live
[51:48] in a broke up home. I could look at how
[51:50] bad my past was. I grew up I was in
[51:53] Toledo as a young age and I could just
[51:55] sit there and dwell on it, but I'm not.
[51:57] I just dwell on the good things of God.
[51:59] I dwell on where he brought me from and
[52:01] where I am today and what he's doing in
[52:03] my life. And it's so easy to look in
[52:06] your rearview mirror in your life and
[52:07] brother Ram said, "You'll be racked up
[52:09] somewhere."
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You'll be racked up somewhere. But you
[52:13] know how big a windshield you have when
[52:14] you sit in your car tonight? It's a big
[52:17] windshield. And that would tell you when
[52:18] you look out your windshield, maybe
[52:20] you'll leave this message, you'll say,
[52:21] "That's the blessings of God. I'm moving
[52:24] forward." Maybe maybe you made a
[52:26] mistake, young people, young people old
[52:29] like, maybe you're online. You made a
[52:31] mistake. Guess what? Just repent and
[52:33] move on.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Don't live in it.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; The devil wants you to dwell on it.
[52:38] We're all sinners saved by grace
[52:40] tonight.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; We may I fall every day, but I just
[52:45] Well, you know what? I just dust my my
[52:46] pants off. I ask forgiveness. And his
[52:48] mercies are new every morning.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; His mercies are new. I just tap into the
[52:55] book and say, "Lord, I need some more of
[52:57] your resources." But too many times we
[52:59] pass these gas stations, baby, like me,
[53:02] and my wife goes, "Honey, you've been on
[53:04] Eve for about 2 hours. Uh, it's time to
[53:06] fill up the tank."
[53:09] And, you know, it says 5 miles. Would
[53:11] you please stop? Maybe that's only me
[53:14] tonight.
[53:16] Well, I know it says two and now it's
[53:18] zero. Now we're on We're on some major
[53:20] grace.
[53:22] But too many times we come to church
[53:24] that way. We, you know, brother says,
[53:26] you get what you come expecting. If you
[53:28] look for a mistake, you're going to
[53:30] find, you'll find one in me for sure.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; But you get what you come expecting. And
[53:35] we got to know that God, I maybe I just
[53:37] kneel down and say, Lord, I I need you
[53:40] to speak to me tonight.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I'm I said that today before I
[53:44] got here. I said, Lord, I want you to
[53:45] speak to me. Even when I'm preaching,
[53:47] Lord, speak to I'm preaching to me
[53:49] tonight.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say, he says, "When
[53:55] a spirit born," listen to this. I hope
[53:57] this encouraged you tonight. And in the
[53:59] in the church age book, he says, "When a
[54:01] spirit born uh spiritfilled man, his
[54:04] faith takes the word into his heart and
[54:07] places it on his lips." He said, "Why?
[54:09] That's the same as deity speaking." He
[54:12] said, "Every mountain has to go. Satan
[54:15] cannot stand before that man."
[54:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's an untapped
[54:20] resource that you need to claim tonight
[54:22] and say, "Lord, I speak to my mountain.
[54:24] I speak to that cancer. I speak to that
[54:28] uh diabetes." And just keep walking
[54:31] forward.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; It's like that brother in the chair. He
[54:34] he kept walking in there. I forget his
[54:35] name. Brother Paul, you probably could
[54:36] say it, but he's in the chair and he
[54:38] he's sitting in the the barber chair and
[54:40] he he he keeps claiming his eyesight.
[54:43] He's like, "Well, you're crazy." And all
[54:44] of a sudden, his eyes came open. and
[54:47] then he took off running and he's
[54:48] chasing him. But I'm here to tell you,
[54:50] some of us need to step out by faith and
[54:52] say, "You know what? I'm tired of
[54:54] listening to the devil's lies. I need to
[54:56] tap into my book. The book that's been
[54:59] opened from Genesis to Revelation has
[55:01] been given to you. It's been the book
[55:04] has been handed to you. What are you
[55:06] doing with it?"
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, what are you doing with it?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, not sit on a shelf or or I got a
[55:14] relic or I got a buckle. I'm I'm not
[55:16] trying to be respect disrespectful
[55:18] tonight.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. I'm sorry,
[55:21] brother Paul, but I I got a suitcase and
[55:23] I and I'm not being mean. I Please don't
[55:25] take it wrong. And I got this and I got
[55:27] that. And it becomes a relic on a shelf.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, but Brother Tony's want to He's
[55:34] wanting some people that God could live
[55:36] on the inside and you be written pistols
[55:39] read of all men. And when you walk down
[55:41] the street, they go, "Oh my goodness,
[55:43] even this shadow healed me. I was so
[55:46] full in the Holy Ghost, his shadow. That
[55:48] man loves Jesus Christ.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, but we got to get in the book. We
[55:54] got We got so brother brother Gideon, we
[55:56] we have so many untapped resources.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; But we just could get in the book. And
[56:02] you know, I just love this message of
[56:04] the hour.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad for it, brother Tony.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul, I'm so thankful. Brother
[56:10] Brandon, I I tell you what, I I didn't
[56:13] look for it. He came looking for me. I'm
[56:15] thankful that he did.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; But I thought about tonight and I was
[56:20] saying about untapped resources and
[56:22] maybe this does something for you. But I
[56:24] got this little little bucket. Maybe
[56:26] just brought this. Brother Brandon
[56:28] brought it for me. Thank you, brother.
[56:29] But I thought about these stakes and
[56:32] maybe this will do something for you
[56:33] tonight. But I thought about these
[56:35] stakes tonight. Maybe get some young
[56:37] people to help me if that's okay. I hope
[56:41] someone will will will maybe will you
[56:43] come help me? One of y'all help me. Uh
[56:45] will you will you help me? Do you mind?
[56:47] You don't have to be young, middle age,
[56:49] whatever age. And I want you to take
[56:52] this tonight. I want you to hammer this
[56:53] as I read this resource. I want you to
[56:56] take this steak and maybe they can see
[56:58] it here. And I want you to start
[57:00] hammering that down in there. Not too
[57:02] hard where all the sin comes out, but
[57:04] just just enough. John 3:16, for God so
[57:08] loved the world, that he gave his only
[57:10] son that whosoever believes in him shall
[57:13] not perish but have eternal life.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; There's you a good resource tonight.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Will you will you
[57:20] will you hammer that in tonight? All
[57:22] right, let's read another one. 1 John
[57:24] 1:9. If we confess our sins, he is
[57:26] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[57:29] sins and to cleanse you of what? All
[57:31] unrighteousness.
[57:33] All. So, we're driving stakes tonight.
[57:36] You see that? We are mentally taking the
[57:38] resources that God has gave us in this
[57:40] book and we're driving a stake in that
[57:43] and saying the devil that's my stake.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; That's a resource tonight. Thank you.
[57:49] Maybe you could come up for a minute and
[57:50] and drive this one down. Thank you,
[57:52] brother.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. And we we'll read another one and
[57:56] I won't have time for them all, but uh
[57:58] let's read Joshua 1:9. Be strong and
[58:01] courageous for the L for the Lord for
[58:03] your God is with you wherever you go.
[58:06] Maybe he's driving. Hit that stick a
[58:07] couple more times. Psalms 23:4. Yay,
[58:10] though I walk through the valley of the
[58:12] shadow of death. I will fear no evil,
[58:15] for thou are with me. Thy riding staff,
[58:17] they comfort me. Oh, there's your
[58:19] resource tonight. Drive it down. Maybe
[58:22] the devil, you've went around this
[58:23] mountain long enough. It's time to start
[58:26] driving your your resources and your
[58:28] stakes down and tell the devil whose
[58:30] side you're on. Too many times we we we
[58:33] tell God what our storm is and you need
[58:35] to tell the storm who your God is.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Too many times.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe maybe get another volunteer.
[58:44] Anybody want to volunteer tonight?
[58:46] Anybody? No. Not many hands. Come here,
[58:49] brother. Thank you, brother. Oh, we'll
[58:52] read another resource. I hope this is
[58:53] sinks in tonight. Yes, sir.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe this a little elementary, but this
[58:57] is just where I feel like good going.
[58:59] Philippians 4 4:19. But my God, but my
[59:03] God. You You're going through a hard
[59:05] trial tonight and you're like, "Brother,
[59:06] I don't know how I'm gonna make it. I
[59:08] don't know how I'm gonna pay my bills,
[59:09] but I'm going to read you something. My
[59:11] God shall supply all your need according
[59:14] to his riches and glory by Christ Jesus.
[59:17] My God. That's your God. I'm talking
[59:20] about our God tonight."
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6:33. Maybe maybe just pull one
[59:25] out and hammer this one in, brother. Uh,
[59:27] but Matthew 6:33. But seek ye first the
[59:30] kingdom of God. I tell the boys this all
[59:31] the time. I say, "Boys, seek the kingdom
[59:34] first of God and his righteousness, and
[59:36] all the things should be added unto
[59:37] you." That's right.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; And we could keep going. We would be
[59:41] here. I don't have enough stakes tonight
[59:43] to pull out all God's resources, what
[59:46] he's done for you, where he's at. I hope
[59:48] that sinks in tonight. Thank you,
[59:50] brothers.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; And we get to a spot in our life where
[59:55] we need to drive a stake down. Maybe the
[59:57] Holy Spirit, maybe the devil comes on
[59:59] your shoulder and say, "I'm not saved."
[1:00:01] Then you just go back to John 3:16 where
[1:00:03] you dri down because he comes on my
[1:00:07] shoulder some days and you'll say,
[1:00:08] "Well, you know why? You shouldn't have
[1:00:10] cut that off or you shouldn't have blew
[1:00:11] the horn. I'm just being honest with you
[1:00:13] tonight." And I said, "Lord, yes, I'm
[1:00:15] sorry." And I'll start to ask for
[1:00:16] forgiveness, but my God, my God will
[1:00:19] forgive you of all your iniquities.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; I mean, I just go back to the book
[1:00:24] because the book has been given to you.
[1:00:26] the entire book. We live in an age where
[1:00:29] Paul didn't even have the entire book
[1:00:31] open. But you are living in a day where
[1:00:34] this book has been open to you.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; This entire book, all these resources.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's better than 93 octane. It's
[1:00:45] better than 87. We're living on heavenly
[1:00:47] octane tonight. The untapped resources
[1:00:50] we have.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, I pray this encourages you
[1:00:55] tonight. Y'all just call me crazy, but
[1:00:58] hey, leave me that way.
[1:01:00] I'll read some more. Peace I leave with
[1:01:02] you. My peace I give unto you. Not as
[1:01:05] the world giveth, but give unto you. Let
[1:01:07] not your heart be troubled, nor let it
[1:01:09] be afraid.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; I think some of you the adults need to
[1:01:13] take a steak tonight and drive it down
[1:01:15] and say, I need to Maybe you need to go
[1:01:17] home and physically put a steak down
[1:01:19] somewhere.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And say, I'm tired of this. or you know
[1:01:24] and maybe maybe Isaiah 40:29 where it
[1:01:27] says that he giveth power to the faint
[1:01:29] and them that not might not be he said
[1:01:32] have no might but have increased
[1:01:33] strength every even the youth shall
[1:01:35] faint he said and be weary and the young
[1:01:38] men shall utterly fail
[1:01:41] but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength they shall
[1:01:45] mount up like eagles they shall run and
[1:01:48] not be weary and they shall walk and not
[1:01:50] be faint oh we would be here all tonight
[1:01:53] if I start from Genesis to Revelation of
[1:01:55] how many resources you have.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, but the devil wants to just put in
[1:02:00] your mind, brother Tony and brother
[1:02:03] brother Kenny just puts it in our mind
[1:02:05] every day. You're not a child of God,
[1:02:07] young people. He does it to me, too. So,
[1:02:09] I know he does it to you. But if you
[1:02:11] drive a steak now, you can go back to
[1:02:14] that steak and go, that's where it
[1:02:16] happened on a revival night or on a
[1:02:19] Wednesday night. Oh, we wouldn't have a
[1:02:22] revival. But something struck my life
[1:02:25] and on the inside, I tapped into that
[1:02:28] resource and I said, "Lord, that's me."
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got to remind the devil who we
[1:02:35] are.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Or what team we're on.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't have time to read all this,
[1:02:41] but Jeremiah 29:11, "For I know the
[1:02:43] thoughts that I think toward you."
[1:02:45] Listen, young people, sayeth the Lord,
[1:02:47] thoughts of what? Peace.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thoughts of peace, not of
[1:02:51] evil. So when the when the enemy comes
[1:02:53] to attack you, he's going to give you
[1:02:54] evil thoughts.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; But look, thoughts of peace, not of evil
[1:02:58] to give you what? An expected end. I'm
[1:03:00] thankful. I'm thankful, brother Kenny.
[1:03:03] He's gave you me an expected end. I had
[1:03:06] a terrible end one day. But when he when
[1:03:08] he when he came when he found me, I'm
[1:03:10] here. I'm just here to tell you, he's
[1:03:12] lit me on fire for God.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; He's lit me on fire for God. But you go
[1:03:18] on to say Proverbs 10:22, "The blessings
[1:03:21] of the Lord, it make it rich, and he
[1:03:22] addeth no sorrow with it."
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, Isaiah 54:17.
[1:03:28] That's another one I really feel like we
[1:03:29] need to take a stake and just nail it
[1:03:31] down tonight. Right there. Listen.
[1:03:34] Isaiah 54:17. No weapon that's formed
[1:03:37] against thee, thou shalt prosper. Every
[1:03:40] tongue that rise up against thee in
[1:03:42] judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is
[1:03:44] the heritage of the saints of the Lord.
[1:03:46] And the righteousness is of me, sayaeth
[1:03:48] the Lord.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's time to start driving some
[1:03:52] stakes down tonight and say, Lord, you
[1:03:54] got un riches that we don't tap into.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, he says, listen
[1:04:01] to this. He says, he says, he said, if
[1:04:03] you say to this mountain, be moved and
[1:04:05] don't doubt in your heart, but believe.
[1:04:07] He said that what you said will come.
[1:04:09] This is how I got this message. I was
[1:04:11] listening to this message conference and
[1:04:13] he says he says you say it come to pass
[1:04:15] but you have what you you you've said he
[1:04:17] said you can't have you can have what
[1:04:19] you've said whatever whatsoever it is he
[1:04:21] said let it be he said it's untapped
[1:04:23] resources
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; untapped resources and he goes on to say
[1:04:28] a man said that long ago he said I don't
[1:04:30] want to bother God listen to this he
[1:04:33] said I don't want to bother God you know
[1:04:35] I you know I don't know if you ever felt
[1:04:36] that way I don't want to bother God
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want to bother
[1:04:40] He goes, "Well, I know is he's awful
[1:04:43] busy."
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said this, "I know
[1:04:47] he's awful busy." He said, "Nonsense."
[1:04:51] He said, "I don't want to." Well, you
[1:04:53] can exhaust, listen, you can exhaust his
[1:04:57] bountable blessings. He said, "Could you
[1:05:00] imagine a little fish about a about a
[1:05:02] half an inch long out in the middle of
[1:05:04] the Pacific Ocean? I better drink water
[1:05:07] sparingly because I might run out.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I just a little inch in the ocean,
[1:05:13] brother. Just think about how big the
[1:05:16] ocean is. You look, you can't even see
[1:05:18] the other side. That's how big God's
[1:05:20] blessings are. You can't even see from
[1:05:23] day to day, but God is carrying you
[1:05:26] along the way.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; God is carrying you.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might not see in front of you
[1:05:32] tonight. You say, "Brother, I don't know
[1:05:34] how I'm going to pay my bills. I don't
[1:05:35] know. Okay, you don't need to worry
[1:05:36] about it all. Just keep walking. Possess
[1:05:39] the land that God's gave you. If you're
[1:05:42] going to walk just 2 in or 6 in, you're
[1:05:45] still moving forward.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; You're still moving forward.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, said, could you
[1:05:52] imagine a little mouse about oh so big
[1:05:54] under the great garners of Egypt saying,
[1:05:56] I better eat ration myself this winter.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; He said, you just get little grain, two
[1:06:02] grains a day. He said, 'I might run out
[1:06:04] before the the new harvest. That's
[1:06:06] ridiculous.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my, this message is wonderful.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; He said, 'Well, it's twice that
[1:06:12] ridiculous. A thousand my a thousand
[1:06:15] times more to think you can exhaust the
[1:06:18] mercies of a merciful God. [applause]
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That you can exhaust the mercies. You
[1:06:24] can't exhaust the mercies of God.
[1:06:27] I would be way gone off this world if it
[1:06:30] wasn't for his grace and his mercies.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray this sinks in tonight.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why? You're trying to force
[1:06:38] his way into you. Ask abundantly that
[1:06:40] your joys might be full."
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Maybe you come in here. I'm just I'm
[1:06:45] just wore out. Well, just ask God to
[1:06:47] fill you back up.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Just like you're going to the gas
[1:06:50] station. You're at the spiritual gas
[1:06:52] pump tonight. Say, "Lord, fill me up. I
[1:06:56] want some more. I might I might have
[1:06:58] been in the message 50 years, but guess
[1:07:00] what? You got to keep I might have had
[1:07:02] that car out there 50 years, but I got
[1:07:04] to keep putting gas in it and gas and
[1:07:07] some more gas. And you're not just here
[1:07:09] on a Wednesday night, but get you a
[1:07:11] little bit of God tonight. Say, Lord,
[1:07:13] I'm here to be filled up.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I want your resources tonight.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:07:23] Luke 9:109
[1:07:25] it says, "Behold, I give unto you the
[1:07:28] power to tread on serpents." This is
[1:07:30] another resource.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; "And scorpions and all over the power of
[1:07:34] what?" The enemy
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; "And nothing shall by any means hurt
[1:07:38] you."
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; He might hurt you here. He might hurt
[1:07:42] you in your mind. And you just It's It's
[1:07:44] the battle of the mind. We know the
[1:07:46] greatest battle ever fought, young
[1:07:47] people, is in your mind.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And then you just fill it with junk and
[1:07:51] trash all the time. and you maybe you're
[1:07:53] in your room by yourself and my parents
[1:07:55] ain't looking I'll do this or I'll do
[1:07:57] that. But God is always watching
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; and it's a time that you could take that
[1:08:03] time. And I'm not saying just be in your
[1:08:05] Bible for a hundred hours. But I'm here
[1:08:07] to tell you just watch what you're
[1:08:08] feeding on.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Watch what you're feed you're here.
[1:08:13] You're you're not a trash can. You're
[1:08:14] not a dump.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; You're you're sons and daughters of a
[1:08:18] king.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And you need to feed on these resources
[1:08:20] tonight. I'll tell you like you ever got
[1:08:22] a car and you you we've we've traveled
[1:08:24] all over all over and you fill up this
[1:08:27] tank and that tank and some gas stations
[1:08:28] you pull up like baby we going have to
[1:08:31] buy gas here tonight so we going to have
[1:08:33] to pray wrecked your heart
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden you got water
[1:08:37] in the tank and that thing like I'm
[1:08:39] telling you she ask her you get water in
[1:08:42] the tank and you barely going and you
[1:08:44] your car is sputtering you don't know
[1:08:46] what happened and you got water in the
[1:08:47] tank maybe some of you tonight's got a
[1:08:49] little bit of water a little bit of
[1:08:50] world in the tank.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's time to tap into the
[1:08:54] resources. Maybe maybe maybe you've been
[1:08:57] saved. Maybe you dragged the steak down
[1:08:58] long time ago. But I just want to remind
[1:09:00] you, look back at the steak and say,
[1:09:02] "Lord, I just want another refilling
[1:09:05] tonight. I want some more tonight. Lord,
[1:09:08] refill me, Lord. Oh, come on the inside.
[1:09:11] Give me Give me a purpose, Lord. A
[1:09:13] vision for you."
[1:09:17] [snorts]
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm so glad there's many, brother
[1:09:20] Tony, more outpourings of God. Could you
[1:09:23] imagine? You just get one fill up and
[1:09:25] that's it.
[1:09:26] But our God is so merciful. He just
[1:09:29] keeps filling you up. Oh, I tell you, I
[1:09:32] don't care. This stuff never gets old.
[1:09:33] And the more you feed it, the more you
[1:09:35] feed that day by that read that renewed
[1:09:37] day by day. And the more you read it,
[1:09:39] Brother Brandham, the more it just it
[1:09:41] just resonates, Brother Paul, on the
[1:09:43] inside. And it's like, oh, that's me,
[1:09:46] Lord. That's I say amen to the entire
[1:09:49] book.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, he says,
[1:09:54] "Science can only climb so far." He
[1:09:56] said, "It falls back." He said, "Listen
[1:09:58] to this. You got the un uncarchable
[1:10:01] promises of God, untapped resources,
[1:10:04] yonder."
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "But the thing of it is they
[1:10:08] have to look back and see, oh, they're
[1:10:10] in the school of thought who that taught
[1:10:12] that taught taught taught it." He said,
[1:10:15] 'But I don't care what the school said.
[1:10:17] He said the Bible said. The Bible said.
[1:10:21] He said, ' And that's God's science
[1:10:23] book. Here's your You want a science
[1:10:25] book? Your parents might get here.
[1:10:27] That's your science book tonight.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; I know it's all ragged, but I tell you
[1:10:31] what, it's good. And it might not feel
[1:10:33] good sometimes when you walk in church
[1:10:35] and you get stepped on your toes, but I
[1:10:37] always say it's all good for me cuz I
[1:10:39] need it. This old man, I'm trying to get
[1:10:41] this every single day. It's a
[1:10:43] progression. It's a daily walk.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; It's a daily walk. And when you look at
[1:10:48] your friends or someone beside you that
[1:10:50] maybe is not as far as you, just pray
[1:10:52] for them.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Encourage them.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother says, when they're in
[1:10:56] the gutter, pick them up. You don't have
[1:10:57] to go, "Well, I'm going to give you a
[1:10:58] quote. Let me kick you right in your
[1:11:00] throat." But no, you just encourage
[1:11:03] them. Give them something. Write them a
[1:11:04] note. Write them a letter. Hey, I just
[1:11:06] been praying for you today. Send him a
[1:11:08] flower. Whatever it is, cuz love will
[1:11:10] conquer it all. That's right.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Love of Jesus Christ. They could care
[1:11:15] how many books you've read, how many
[1:11:16] message books you read. They want to see
[1:11:18] the life behind the name.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; The life behind the name.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, Philippians. Hope this is okay.
[1:11:27] Philippians 1:6. Being confident of this
[1:11:29] very thing, that which he that which
[1:11:32] began a good work in you will perform
[1:11:34] until the day of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:37] Second Timothy, I'm just reading some
[1:11:38] resources to re to to strengthen your
[1:11:41] faith tonight. 2 Timothy uh 1:7. For God
[1:11:45] had not given us a what? Spirit of what?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Fear, but of power and love and of a
[1:11:52] sound mind.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, the world thinks you're
[1:11:56] crazy. Oh, brother Gideon, he thinks
[1:11:58] we're crazy. All right. But I'm here to
[1:12:00] tell you on the inside, there's that
[1:12:02] inside man that feeds day and day. And
[1:12:05] I'm tell you what, we're headed to
[1:12:06] earthly home and this is just a pest
[1:12:09] house. This is we're just going through.
[1:12:11] But I here to tell you, I'm going to
[1:12:13] live on the the mercies of God and his
[1:12:15] untapped resources and say, Lord, I want
[1:12:18] more of it.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; I want more of it, Lord.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say, I was reading
[1:12:24] this um I want to read this. He says,
[1:12:27] "Oh," and he said, "Brother said, "Oh,
[1:12:29] knowledge we will we only run so far,
[1:12:31] then it falls backwards. But the tree of
[1:12:33] life has no end to it. We've got
[1:12:35] untapped resources and we're we're
[1:12:38] scared to step out and take God at his
[1:12:40] word."
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; He said this like 14 times in 14
[1:12:44] different messages. Untapped resources.
[1:12:49] He goes on to say he says he said
[1:12:51] they're pressing forward looking forward
[1:12:53] but we want to look back and look at
[1:12:54] Moody and Sanki Sanki he says and Finny
[1:12:57] and Knox and Calvin he said but what
[1:13:00] they said it was all right that was the
[1:13:01] for their age. He goes on to say he says
[1:13:04] my grandfather rode on an ox cart and I
[1:13:06] I'm driving a Ford uh V8. My son will
[1:13:10] fly a jet plane. He said that's where
[1:13:12] they're going on but that's what
[1:13:14] religion ought to be. He goes on to say
[1:13:15] he says the coming of the Lord is at
[1:13:18] hand.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; He said the church ought to be moving
[1:13:22] unto their powers.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says science can only climb so
[1:13:27] far and then it has to be dropped
[1:13:29] dropped off. But we got untapped
[1:13:32] resources that's never been touched of
[1:13:34] the power unlimited of God.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And he says that we ought to be moving
[1:13:40] into.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I say praise God.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This this message is wonderful. I
[1:13:46] like what he says right here. He said
[1:13:47] we're living in a million miles under
[1:13:50] our privilege tonight.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; He said the privilege as Christians to
[1:13:56] be enjoying. I feel ashamed of myself
[1:13:58] when I look out here and I see the
[1:14:00] institutions and the sicknesses. And he
[1:14:03] says in the troubles that's going on
[1:14:05] right now. He said, "Our church ought to
[1:14:08] be walking on the street, healing the
[1:14:09] sick, raising the dead, casting out the
[1:14:12] devils, doing signs and wonders, making
[1:14:14] the whole world realize that Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ lives."
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Well, he said, "That's what we we we
[1:14:21] need to you want to know what we need to
[1:14:23] be doing? That's what we need to be
[1:14:24] doing." He is what he says,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, "We're living in
[1:14:29] under our privileges." Yes, sir. He said
[1:14:31] the le the left they left him at the
[1:14:34] feast of Pentecost and their own he said
[1:14:36] he said there is the only place the
[1:14:38] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian I was a
[1:14:40] Baptist he said and Pentecostal he said
[1:14:43] will ever find him he said they'll go
[1:14:45] back where they left him at and he goes
[1:14:48] on to say he said where is the joy of
[1:14:50] the lord
[1:14:51] I want to ask you tonight where's the
[1:14:53] joy of the lord
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; he said where's the power of the lord he
[1:14:57] said the church asked today what
[1:14:59] happened to the god of history. He's
[1:15:01] waiting for his people to call him on
[1:15:03] the scene.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for me and you to call him
[1:15:07] on the scene. You got something to do.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, he said, "But we
[1:15:13] can't do it through denominations."
[1:15:14] Aren't you thankful? He said, "We can't
[1:15:17] do it under psychology. We can't do it
[1:15:19] on arthatic." He said, "Or we can't do
[1:15:21] it with education. We separate
[1:15:23] ourselves. We divide ourselves." He
[1:15:25] said, "We are we are not divided. We are
[1:15:27] one person indeed in Christ Jesus. He
[1:15:30] said we are all in one in Christ and our
[1:15:32] denominations will never do it. He said
[1:15:35] as good as they are, they won't do it.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying there not great people in
[1:15:40] them churches. I'm talking about the
[1:15:41] system itself.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; There's some great people in them, but
[1:15:45] the system itself is corrupt. Aren't you
[1:15:47] thankful you're called out tonight?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Every one of you tonight has been called
[1:15:52] by name.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every one of you has been
[1:15:54] called by name from the foundation of
[1:15:56] the world. You've accepted it.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And he goes, "Our education is the
[1:16:02] greatest hindrance the gospel had ever
[1:16:04] has ever had."
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; He goes, "What we need is not no educ
[1:16:08] what we need is not education. We need
[1:16:10] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:16:11] Ghost back into the church."
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; To demonstrate the power
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; to demonstrate the power.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about untapped resources
[1:16:20] tonight. He said, "But we're still a
[1:16:23] million miles short where we should be."
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us move what?" Backwards.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Let us move forward.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; But too many times we're fussing about
[1:16:33] this. We're fussing about that. And hey,
[1:16:35] did you hear what Johnny said? And do
[1:16:36] you hear what I'm I've been a victim of
[1:16:39] it? And you did you hear about this,
[1:16:40] brother? You just pray for him.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, "Let us move
[1:16:46] forward. Let us let us go back where we
[1:16:48] left them at the feast of Pentecost." He
[1:16:50] said, "We don't need an omination." Then
[1:16:52] he goes on to say this. He [snorts]
[1:16:53] said, I like what he says right here for
[1:16:56] time. I'm moving. I'm having to skip a
[1:16:57] little bit. He says, "One," he said,
[1:17:00] "One time a man caught an old crow." I
[1:17:02] like this. I'm talking about untapped
[1:17:04] resources. He said, "And he tied him up
[1:17:06] because he was in the cornfield."
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; maybe you're here tonight. Maybe this is
[1:17:11] you tonight. He says, "And the bird
[1:17:12] begins to fly over saying, "Come on,
[1:17:14] Johnny Crow." He said, "Let's go south.
[1:17:16] Let's go. The winter time's coming." He
[1:17:19] said we he's got he's he's got so poor
[1:17:21] he couldn't hardly walk.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe you walked through the church
[1:17:24] tonight and said, "Brother Chris, I just
[1:17:26] barely got here, but you got here.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; You're moving forward.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; You got here." And he goes on to say
[1:17:33] that poor old crow, he and he just cut
[1:17:35] him loose and he said he and when he
[1:17:37] did, the other crows came over and said,
[1:17:39] "Come on, Johnny Crow. Let's go south."
[1:17:41] But he said he's been tied up so long
[1:17:43] until he just couldn't walk around. He
[1:17:46] said, "I can't do it. I can't do it."
[1:17:48] And he said he didn't even know he was
[1:17:50] free.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And maybe some of you tonight is living
[1:17:54] with so much baggage in your life and so
[1:17:57] many scars that you just I'm just here
[1:17:59] to tell you you've been set free from
[1:18:01] the Jesus Christ. Oh, I'm here to tell
[1:18:04] you you need to drive the baggage like
[1:18:06] that. You go at the airport and you many
[1:18:08] times I'm always on a plane, brother
[1:18:10] Kenny. And I just love it when you can
[1:18:12] just go, "Here's my baggage."
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And you watch it go up down the little
[1:18:16] escalator and it goes and it goes around
[1:18:19] and I'm going to the plane. Praise God.
[1:18:21] And too many times we carry our baggage
[1:18:23] with us and scars in our lives. When
[1:18:26] Jesus Christ has already carried every
[1:18:28] weight, every sin, every diabetes, every
[1:18:31] cancer, whatever you got, he's he's the
[1:18:35] greatest high priest we got. Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; He's an untapped resource that he just
[1:18:41] is sitting there going, "Hey, I've been
[1:18:43] here the whole time. Just tap into me."
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Maybe you're not
[1:18:48] completely healed today, but just keep
[1:18:50] claiming it every single day.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Just keep walking forward. Say, "Lord, I
[1:18:55] don't feel no different, but I'm not
[1:18:57] going by my feelings. I'm going by my
[1:18:59] own time, my resources." Oh, I tell you,
[1:19:02] he says, "I just claim it tonight.
[1:19:06] Oh, claim it tonight.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, he said, "That's
[1:19:10] the way man is today. You don't know
[1:19:12] what he says, you don't know that Jesus
[1:19:14] Christ made you free, brother." He said,
[1:19:16] "Let's get out of it." He said, "Let's
[1:19:18] get somewhere. God made us free."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Don't starve to death. God has got
[1:19:23] Pentecostal blessings all through the
[1:19:25] skies. Listen to this. And untapped
[1:19:28] resources of his goodness.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Untapped resources of his goodness.
[1:19:34] He said, "So let's go to it. What
[1:19:36] whatsoever will will come." He said,
[1:19:37] "Let him come." He said, "Drink." He
[1:19:39] said, "Drink from the life freely from
[1:19:42] the waters of life freely." He said,
[1:19:44] "The eagle," he builds his nest high in
[1:19:46] the rock. And he's like the church. And
[1:19:49] the church of Jesus Christ is the church
[1:19:51] that set up on a hill that gives light.
[1:19:53] It's high. It's got a high ambitions.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, it says it's ought to have high
[1:19:59] expectations.
[1:20:00] [snorts]
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; It's okay to have high ambitions. high
[1:20:03] expectations. He said it should have
[1:20:05] high expectations because we've been
[1:20:08] expecting God to do something.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You're living in heavenly places.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; If we could just get above our storms
[1:20:16] tonight, you know, when the plane goes
[1:20:18] through it and you feel it all and I'm
[1:20:19] like, "Lord Jesus, lo, I'm with you
[1:20:21] always. Would you please land?" As
[1:20:23] brother Paul said tonight, he said, "You
[1:20:25] ever heard that scripture?" I said,
[1:20:26] "Yeah." I said, "I love it." Cuz I mean,
[1:20:28] I go through a storm. And I'm like, get
[1:20:30] this plane out of the sky and let's land
[1:20:33] or at least get above the clouds.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; But so many times we we get caught up
[1:20:38] right there in that cloud of life
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; and trials and the devil keeps wearing
[1:20:42] us out and our family and this don't go
[1:20:44] right and the the laundry is messed up
[1:20:47] and I mean I mean I'm talking about
[1:20:49] major problems.
[1:20:52] the the the water heater goes out
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; and then you go to Ecuador and you
[1:20:56] travel the world and you go,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I ain't complaining about nothing.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; You get into the shower and it's cold
[1:21:02] and you go, "Praise the Lord
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; that we even have water."
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And then you start eating some rice and
[1:21:11] you you eat this and we're just we're
[1:21:13] just spoiled.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to be honest tonight.
[1:21:16] We're spoiled brats. I'm a spoiled brat.
[1:21:20] But we have untapped resources and we
[1:21:23] got other people in other countries that
[1:21:24] might just have one little message
[1:21:26] thing. I'm telling you, I've seen it and
[1:21:28] they'll come up to me, "Hey, brother,
[1:21:29] can you get me a book? I've been reading
[1:21:31] this for 20 years and I've got three
[1:21:33] pages."
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And it will rip your heart out.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest tonight. You go
[1:21:38] overseas and you they got one book and
[1:21:40] they got like just a few things. They
[1:21:42] have just a few few and they marked it
[1:21:44] up so much and passed it around so much.
[1:21:47] It feels like a piece of sheet. like a
[1:21:49] sheet you can literally cover up with.
[1:21:51] It's been touched so much and we have
[1:21:53] untapped resources. The message of the
[1:21:55] hour on our phone on on the iPad. We
[1:21:58] have the whole book.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; All his blessings. Just get into it.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I'm encouraging tonight. Get into it.
[1:22:06] It's all good.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And as we as I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:22:10] get this planet out of the sky, but he
[1:22:12] says if you come in this afternoon
[1:22:13] saying, "Well, I go up and if I get get
[1:22:15] in the prayer line, all right." Well, he
[1:22:17] said he'll tell me what I'm Well, Lord,
[1:22:19] he says, "Oh, don't have expectations
[1:22:21] like that." He said, "But if you don't
[1:22:23] do it, uh, he won't get I won't." He
[1:22:25] said, "If you don't do it, then I won't
[1:22:27] get nothing." He said, "Your expectation
[1:22:29] is not too much."
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come to church this afternoon.
[1:22:33] If you're sick, say, I'm expecting to go
[1:22:35] home." Well,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; he said, "I'm not going to leave till it
[1:22:39] happens." He said, "If you haven't got
[1:22:41] the Holy Ghost, say, well, I'll stay
[1:22:43] here to," he said, "and right to in this
[1:22:45] place or I'll get the Holy Ghost."
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "I come here amongst
[1:22:51] the Holy Ghost people." He said, "I come
[1:22:53] here where the spirit is at. I stay
[1:22:55] right here." He said, "I want to be like
[1:22:57] old Buddy Robson was on that in that
[1:22:59] cornfield."
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Think about it tonight, Brother Tony. He
[1:23:02] talked about corny. He said, "Oh," he
[1:23:04] said, "Lord, if you don't give me the
[1:23:06] Holy Ghost, when you come back, you'll
[1:23:07] find a pile of bones of Buddy Robson." I
[1:23:10] tell you, it's time to us to say
[1:23:12] expectations and say, "Lord, I'm not
[1:23:14] leaving till I get it. I'm not leaving.
[1:23:16] I'm going to tap into his resources
[1:23:19] because every resource in that book is
[1:23:21] yours and mine tonight."
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. He goes on to
[1:23:27] say, he said, "A man one time was trying
[1:23:28] to seek God, and every time he'd say,
[1:23:30] I'm saved." The devil would say, "No,
[1:23:32] you're not." This is where I'm going
[1:23:35] tonight.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not saved. He said, "No, you're
[1:23:38] not." He says, "One day he drove down a
[1:23:40] stake."
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Listen. One day, he just made me think
[1:23:44] about this. One day he drove down a
[1:23:47] stake and he said, "Satan, from this on,
[1:23:50] I'll point to this stake."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "This is the place where
[1:23:54] I met God's requirements."
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "One day, Brother Giddy, I
[1:23:59] drove down a stake. Brother Kenny,
[1:24:01] Brother Tony, all of us, Brother Isaac,
[1:24:03] all of us have drove down a steak."
[1:24:05] Maybe you just hadn't drove the stake
[1:24:07] far enough.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's just kind of like leaning
[1:24:10] here. Well, God had just come to church.
[1:24:13] You know what? He didn't come to save
[1:24:14] this building. He came to save
[1:24:16] individuals that want to say, "I'm here
[1:24:18] to get what God has called me for.
[1:24:21] Beautiful.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He says, he goes on to say, he said,
[1:24:24] "You drive your steak down right beside
[1:24:26] your seat this afternoon, saying, Satan,
[1:24:29] right here is where every doubt's going
[1:24:31] to lay."
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to fly away with him
[1:24:35] this afternoon. I'm going to He said,
[1:24:37] "I'm going to accept exactly what he
[1:24:39] told me I could do."
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you believe it?" I say,
[1:24:45] "Amen."
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we I want to bring
[1:24:48] this out as we close this down tonight.
[1:24:51] He says, "But the church," he says, "you
[1:24:53] see, let's see what where Mr. Moody said
[1:24:55] about it. Let's see what Mr. Wesley said
[1:24:57] about it." He said, "Them men lived in
[1:24:59] their age." He said, "That was all right
[1:25:01] for their age, but we got not only a
[1:25:04] scientifically a scientific tree to
[1:25:06] climb, we've got untapped
[1:25:09] resources."
[1:25:10] Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; He said of the bountiful blessings of
[1:25:13] God which is not limited to our limit.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. It's not what you
[1:25:19] can do. He's already paid it all.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You all, we all come to him and say,
[1:25:23] "Well, God, what I can do for you?" No.
[1:25:25] What can I do for you? Lord, I here I
[1:25:27] come. I'm I'm You know, he didn't come
[1:25:29] to save a bunch of perfect people. He
[1:25:31] come to save individuals. I say, "Lord,
[1:25:33] here I am. I lay it before you tonight.
[1:25:36] Lord, I'm I'm filthy. I'm unclean."
[1:25:38] That's where God comes and cleans up.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; He can touch the ring, the the rink is
[1:25:45] sinner, whatever it is, walks in this
[1:25:46] house of God tonight.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what they look like. You
[1:25:50] should have saw me on the outside when I
[1:25:53] when I was in the world.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if he could save me, he can
[1:25:56] save anyone.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's our God tonight.
[1:26:00] He said, "Whatsoever you ask in the
[1:26:02] Father's name, he'll do it." Every
[1:26:04] promise in the book belongs to you. When
[1:26:06] you're saved, listen to this. He said,
[1:26:08] "When you're saved, he gives you a
[1:26:10] check."
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He gives you a check
[1:26:13] with his name wrote at the bottom of it.
[1:26:15] He said, "Don't be afraid to fill it
[1:26:17] out."
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said, "Don't be
[1:26:21] afraid to fill it out because the bank
[1:26:23] of heaven will recognize when it goes to
[1:26:26] the Pentecostal clearing house."
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm telling you tonight, fill it
[1:26:32] out. It's already got Jesus's name on
[1:26:35] it. Let it go to the clearing house
[1:26:37] tonight.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; I like what he I like what he says here.
[1:26:44] I'm trying to get to it tonight. We're
[1:26:46] almost there. But he goes he says he
[1:26:49] goes on to say he says God's known by
[1:26:51] simple faith by the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:53] Ghost. That's the only way. He said God
[1:26:55] in you brings you a son of God changes
[1:26:57] your nature. And the very same thing God
[1:27:00] the creator who made all things spoken
[1:27:02] to the world existence by his word. He
[1:27:05] said that same spirit in you believe
[1:27:07] everything God says and there's nothing
[1:27:10] impossible that you can believe it. He
[1:27:13] said you won't stand back in one little
[1:27:15] creed and say I don't believe it except
[1:27:17] it. He said I can't believe God will I
[1:27:20] can't believe God will do this. I can't
[1:27:21] believe. He says you limit God by your
[1:27:24] unbelief.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He said you limit God by your unbelief.
[1:27:29] And I just want to bring out something
[1:27:30] right here. And I know we're winding
[1:27:32] down, but
[1:27:34] it says right here, he said, "The Bible
[1:27:36] said the kingdom is," we're talking
[1:27:37] about untapped resources. He says, "The
[1:27:38] Bible said, Brother Ram says the kingdom
[1:27:40] is within what?"
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; You, not these walls, not in this
[1:27:45] drywall, not in what's behind the studs,
[1:27:49] in you. He said, "When Jesus rose up
[1:27:51] from the dead, remember he had on his
[1:27:53] side, listen, I love this. He said he
[1:27:55] had the keys of death and hell, not the
[1:27:57] keys of the kingdom."
[1:28:00] He said that was given to the church.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Now Peter had the
[1:28:06] keys." He said, "Do you believe Jesus
[1:28:08] would keep his word if he if he w if he
[1:28:10] if he doesn't, brother, he wasn't God.
[1:28:13] That's all." He said, "Peter, I give you
[1:28:15] the keys of the kingdom." In other
[1:28:16] words, to the Holy Spirit. Whatever you
[1:28:18] bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; But I want to bring this to you. And
[1:28:24] tonight, we're talking about resources.
[1:28:26] And we're going to we're going to come
[1:28:27] down to a close. And I just want to show
[1:28:29] you something tonight.
[1:28:32] And I hope this is okay. I hope he
[1:28:33] invites me back. But if he doesn't, I'll
[1:28:35] keep preaching the word.
[1:28:38] I love you, brother Paul. But I just
[1:28:41] thought about this tonight. And I know
[1:28:42] there's a basketball and football and
[1:28:44] people probably going crazy. Oh my word,
[1:28:46] he's pulling a basketball and football
[1:28:47] out. But but you know, we're human, you
[1:28:51] know, and and and I just thought about
[1:28:52] this basketball and maybe maybe some of
[1:28:54] the young young boys, young Anybody
[1:28:56] volunteer tonight? Maybe y'all can come
[1:28:58] back and volunteer. Do you mind tonight?
[1:29:00] Maybe hold this basketball. But we're
[1:29:03] talking about untapped resources, right?
[1:29:05] And we're talking about this football.
[1:29:06] And I hope this really sinks in tonight
[1:29:08] because I was thinking about this
[1:29:11] and I thought about this baseball. I saw
[1:29:13] the baseball. I think little Joseph's
[1:29:14] baseball. He and maybe Joseph, will you
[1:29:18] hold this tonight? The baseball.
[1:29:20] And I thought about these resources and
[1:29:22] I hope this really sinks in as we talked
[1:29:24] about driving stakes down. Maybe come
[1:29:26] right here where everybody can see you.
[1:29:27] Do you mind? And and I thought maybe
[1:29:29] maybe name a I don't know a famous uh
[1:29:33] baseball player that that makes a lot of
[1:29:35] money.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:29:38] Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth. Maybe of our age.
[1:29:41] I don't know who who that is today.
[1:29:42] Maybe maybe the Dodgers guy. whatever
[1:29:45] his name is, Otani. But that baseball
[1:29:47] is, you know, in his hands, it might be
[1:29:49] just a home run.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; I hope you're understanding me tonight.
[1:29:53] In his hands, this might be worth $6,
[1:29:56] $7, $11, but you put in Otani's hand,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; it's worth 40, 50, 70, $80 million.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Do you understand tonight?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; This football might be $7 to him or
[1:30:10] whatever. Maybe uh who would you say
[1:30:12] like Patrick Mahomes or I don't know
[1:30:14] just a name. I don't know. I I I'm old
[1:30:16] school so I'll probably tell you some
[1:30:17] old names like Troy Aman or something
[1:30:19] terrible. But but like in his hands this
[1:30:22] might be worth $7 or just a game
[1:30:24] touchdown or the game ball.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; But in Patrick Mahome's hands this is
[1:30:28] 160 $80$100 million.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. You put this basketball
[1:30:32] hands maybe say Michael Jordan tonight
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; it's $50 million $50 billion 1 million
[1:30:39] 20 whatever it is is that you put that
[1:30:41] in Michael Jordan's hands but in his
[1:30:43] hands it might be just $5 tonight
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; do you understand what I'm saying
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about untapped resources
[1:30:49] tonight and I hope this sinks in thank
[1:30:51] you maybe you sit it right there but I
[1:30:53] was thinking about tonight I was I was
[1:30:55] getting ready tonight and I thought
[1:30:57] about these I thought about these nails
[1:30:59] and I thought about resources And I
[1:31:01] thought about this and you put them in
[1:31:03] the right hands.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; These nails tonight cuz I build houses
[1:31:07] and build things. They might just build
[1:31:08] me a birdhouse tonight.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; That's about probably all it's going to
[1:31:12] build.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; These little these little Now maybe
[1:31:14] brother Brandon, thank you for getting
[1:31:16] them for me. But but maybe that'll build
[1:31:18] me a little birdhouse that's going to
[1:31:19] fall apart in a couple weeks.
[1:31:22] But when you put these nails in Jesus's
[1:31:24] hands,
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; when you tap into the right resource,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; when you put it into the right hands,
[1:31:30] Right?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; It's gave you salvation. It set you
[1:31:33] free. It set your cancer free. It kept
[1:31:36] your diabetes free. It's gave you
[1:31:38] something to be happy about. But I'm
[1:31:40] here to tell you, I want to read this
[1:31:41] quote that maybe the musicians come. It
[1:31:43] says, "Now sons and daughters who are
[1:31:45] the most powerful before God. What is an
[1:31:47] angel? An angel's a servant. Is that
[1:31:50] right?" He said, "They're servants. What
[1:31:52] are you?"
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a resource tonight. He
[1:31:55] said, "What are you?" He said, "His sons
[1:31:57] and daughter." He said, "Who has the
[1:31:59] most power in heaven?" Then he said, "A
[1:32:02] sinner that's saved by grace or an
[1:32:04] archangel that's standing right by his
[1:32:06] side." Oh, listen to this. He says, he
[1:32:09] says, "The sinner that's saved by grace
[1:32:12] has more authority in heaven than the
[1:32:14] archangel that stands behind his side
[1:32:17] without sin." I'm talking about you, me
[1:32:20] tonight. A sinner saved by grace has
[1:32:23] more authority. You got to tap into the
[1:32:26] resource tonight. Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Or he died in vain. Brother Tony,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; he died in vain. If you we too many
[1:32:33] times, we just got to tap into his
[1:32:35] resource.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; We got the whole book. We got all the
[1:32:39] message quotes,
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; We got We know him really good. We
[1:32:43] memorize them really good.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; But is the author
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; is the author of this book, young I tell
[1:32:52] you, young age, middle age, is this
[1:32:54] author living on the inside?
[1:32:57] Is this the author living on the inside
[1:32:59] of you saying, "Hey, you got untapped
[1:33:02] resources."
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, if you could
[1:33:05] just get this book in your hands tonight
[1:33:06] as they play something softly and you
[1:33:09] can realize what resource you have
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; because this word will defeat the devil
[1:33:14] anywhere, any place, anyhow,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; and anytime.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And if you could just get the sword in
[1:33:22] your hand, you know what? God, I I just
[1:33:24] want to close on this as they place
[1:33:26] something.
[1:33:27] Think about this tonight. They might get
[1:33:30] $50 million.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my, this is hitting home.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it tonight. They might
[1:33:38] get 50. Michael Jordan's riding around
[1:33:41] saying, "I don't have a care in the
[1:33:42] world. I could pay all my bills. I can
[1:33:46] buy 19 Lamborghinis."
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; But look at who you are tonight.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:53] tap into that resource and say, "Lord,
[1:33:57] I'm a daughter son and daughter of the
[1:33:59] king."
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, it should put something in you
[1:34:03] tonight.
[1:34:04] When you realize who you are that you're
[1:34:08] just not going around the mountain for
[1:34:10] 30 years and 40 years, I believe a
[1:34:13] message, but the message is living
[1:34:16] inside of individuals.
[1:34:19] He's wanting to live inside of you.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; I hope you're understanding.
[1:34:27] He send a son who has more authority. Of
[1:34:29] course, we forget what we are.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; We forget many times what made us who we
[1:34:36] are. And when after we become what we
[1:34:39] are, then we forgot how we get here.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, Lord, I'm sorry. I
[1:34:45] do the same thing. I get where I'm at. I
[1:34:47] get complacent in my life. Me, you, we
[1:34:52] get complacent. We forget how we got
[1:34:54] here. And he goes on to say, he said,
[1:34:57] "Oh boy, 84 cent." He said, "Oh, John,
[1:35:00] you're not very much after all. We're 84
[1:35:02] cent. What is that today? Inflation.
[1:35:04] What is it? $3, $5."
[1:35:07] He said, "I touched the boys, but boys,
[1:35:09] you got a soul."
[1:35:11] He said, "You got a soul that's worth 10
[1:35:14] million worlds." Isaac, come here for a
[1:35:17] second tonight. I'm here to tell you,
[1:35:19] you got a soul on the inside that's
[1:35:21] worth a lot more than Michael Jordan
[1:35:24] could ever come up with, that P Manning
[1:35:26] could ever come up with. You got a soul
[1:35:29] on the inside that's that needs to be
[1:35:32] saved and converted. And it's got
[1:35:34] untapped resources. When the Holy Ghost
[1:35:37] fills you and he keeps filling you day
[1:35:40] by day, you have untapped resources. Tap
[1:35:44] into them. They're yours. They're mine.
[1:35:47] They're yours, Brother Brandon, tonight.
[1:35:50] Oh, just say, "Lord, I want to tap into
[1:35:52] your resources. I'm tired of believing I
[1:35:55] got this. I'm tired of anxiety. It's a
[1:35:58] Wednesday night. I'm It might have held
[1:35:59] you over. I'm But I'm ready to tell you,
[1:36:01] maybe there's something said, "Lord, I I
[1:36:03] just I haven't stepped out and just
[1:36:05] said, Lord, I surrender to you tonight.
[1:36:08] Whatever my problem is, he already
[1:36:10] knows.
[1:36:12] But that soul, this body is worth 84
[1:36:15] cent. Maybe his body today is worth $5
[1:36:18] with inflation. But that soul, young
[1:36:21] people, that soul on the inside is worth
[1:36:24] more than any any basketball player. And
[1:36:27] what Payton Manning can make.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; He's come for individuals. Every one of
[1:36:31] you tonight.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; He's came. He set you free. It's time to
[1:36:36] rejoice.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's time to rejoice.
[1:36:41] I know you've heard me probably long
[1:36:42] enough, but I'm here to tell you, tap in
[1:36:46] to these resources.
[1:36:48] They're all good.
[1:36:50] Every one of them, they're all good.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Tap into them tonight. Maybe just heads
[1:36:56] bowed tonight.
[1:36:58] Maybe just someone say, "Lord, God, I
[1:37:01] want to tap into it tonight. Maybe I've
[1:37:03] been around this mountain long enough
[1:37:05] and Lord, I I just need another
[1:37:07] refilling.
[1:37:08] Lord, I I went around the mountain and I
[1:37:12] I'm just I'm just complacent with my
[1:37:14] life and I just Well, I was just me and
[1:37:16] no more. But maybe say, "Lord, work on
[1:37:20] me. Come and touch me tonight."
[1:37:24] Oh, maybe there's someone say before
[1:37:26] this service ends, "Lord, no one looking
[1:37:28] around say, Lord, I I just want the Holy
[1:37:30] Ghost in my life." Oh, no one looking
[1:37:34] around. Maybe it's just one person. If
[1:37:36] not, God bless you. Oh, Father. Oh, fish
[1:37:40] is worth one soul is worth it all.
[1:37:43] Oh, may you touch them while they're
[1:37:44] sitting there tonight. Oh, whatever it
[1:37:47] is, you have a need, whatever it is,
[1:37:48] just lift it up to God. Talk to them.
[1:37:50] Just talk to them. Say, "Dad, Lord,
[1:37:52] Father, we love you tonight. Take up
[1:37:56] this broke up sermon, Lord. And we would
[1:37:58] really get dedicated, Lord. Even my
[1:38:00] life, God, we would just come into a
[1:38:04] consecration with you,
[1:38:06] God. we would tap into your resources,
[1:38:09] Lord.
[1:38:11] Oh, Father, we love you, Father.
[1:38:14] Oh, we love you tonight.
[1:38:17] Oh, we love you, Father, in Jesus name.
[1:38:20] Oh, let's sing is it
[1:38:24] myself.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just worship him for a minute
[1:38:27] tonight. [music]
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's worthy.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I give [singing] myself away. Oh, if you
[1:38:35] need prayer tonight, we'll pray with
[1:38:36] you. Whatever you need,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; oh, it's open. Whatever you need, you
[1:38:41] can do it in your seat.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] just worship him tonight.
[1:38:47] Love on him tonight. I give myself
[1:38:51] [singing]
[1:38:52] away
[1:38:54] so you
[1:38:56] can use me. Here [singing]
[1:39:00] I am.
[1:39:03] Here I [singing] stand,
[1:39:08] Lord. My life
[1:39:12] is in your [singing] hands.
[1:39:16] [music] Lord,
[1:39:18] I longing [singing]
[1:39:22] to [music]

[1:40:34] all [music]

[1:44:51] so you
[1:44:54] can. Hallelujah.
[1:44:57] We've been [singing] made more than
[1:44:59] conquerors. Let's sing that. We've
[1:45:01] [music] been made more than come more
[1:45:04] than conquerors,
[1:45:06] overcomers, [singing] overcomers
[1:45:10] in this life.
[1:45:15] Yes. We've been [singing and music] made
[1:45:18] victorious
[1:45:23] through [singing] the blood of Jesus
[1:45:26] [music] Christ.
[1:45:29] [singing]
[1:45:31] We've been made [music]
[1:45:36] for them conquerors,
[1:45:40] overcomeers
[1:45:41] in peace [music] life. [singing]
[1:45:48] We've been made
[1:45:50] victorious
[1:45:56] [music] through the [singing] blood of
[1:45:58] Jesus. Let's sing it one more time
[1:46:00] tonight.
[1:46:02] Confess [music] it tonight. We've been
[1:46:05] waiting for
[1:46:13] overcomers [music]
[1:46:13] [singing]
[1:46:14] in this life.
[1:46:18] [music]
[1:46:20] We've been made
[1:46:24] glorious [singing]
[1:46:25] [music]
[1:46:29] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:32] [singing]
[1:46:35] Hallelujah. How many raise your hand and
[1:46:38] say, "Thank you, Lord, for the word of
[1:46:39] God tonight, the word of life." Thank
[1:46:41] you, Lord, that you're the exhaustable
[1:46:43] fountain. We have this treasure in
[1:46:47] earthn vessels tonight. We're not
[1:46:49] looking for it somewhere out there, but
[1:46:51] it's within us. We just have to tap it.
[1:46:53] How many got it real clear tonight? You
[1:46:56] can be around all of God's resources and
[1:46:58] not tap it. That's right.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You got to tap it. And they're saying
[1:47:03] that there's so much oil in our own
[1:47:05] country and they want [music] to tap at
[1:47:08] California, different places. Our
[1:47:09] president now wants to tap it. You know,
[1:47:11] the enemy has kept that back for many
[1:47:13] years because of, you know, whatever
[1:47:15] environment or whatever else, but
[1:47:17] they're f we haven't. We've depended on
[1:47:18] other countries, but you know what,
[1:47:20] right? Within our own country, [music]
[1:47:21] we just haven't tapped it yet.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; It's within you. You just got to tap it.
[1:47:26] Get in that word. Can you say amen? Get
[1:47:28] in that place. He that is in within you.
[1:47:31] He that is in you is the message of the
[1:47:33] hour. It's he that it's in you is what
[1:47:36] he's trying to show. And it's an [music]
[1:47:38] inexhaustible fountain. Inexhaustible
[1:47:41] fountain. There is no limitations except
[1:47:43] the limitations that we put on it. I'll
[1:47:46] tell you I feel pretty pretty good
[1:47:48] tonight from the word of God. And it's
[1:47:50] not a pride. It's just I feel very
[1:47:52] privileged. How many raise your hands
[1:47:54] say? I feel privileged to have access
[1:47:57] access to this type of fountain, access
[1:48:00] to these things and uh just to see the
[1:48:04] untapped resources. How do we tap into
[1:48:06] it? We have to drill. We have to drill
[1:48:09] for that oil. Prayer, reading the word,
[1:48:13] taking your time to read the word
[1:48:15] sometimes. There's a difference in
[1:48:17] skimming across it and really digging.
[1:48:19] If you're digging for a treasure,
[1:48:21] there's a difference in just taking one
[1:48:23] shovel, but to really dig and keep
[1:48:25] digging deep until you find the
[1:48:27] treasure. Can you say amen?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; If we're bound by our past, the past can
[1:48:32] keep us from what he has in the future
[1:48:34] for us. [music] I say to you in the name
[1:48:37] of the Lord Jesus tonight that we live
[1:48:41] way below our privileges [music] and
[1:48:43] there's so much more that God has for
[1:48:45] us.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Oh, I want to know you
[1:48:48] more. Oh, I want to know you more. We
[1:48:51] don't know what God has for us and all
[1:48:53] the resources. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:48:55] Let's give a hand clap to the Lord for
[1:48:57] the word tonight. Lord, we thank you for
[1:48:59] this word. I believe
[1:49:03] I I believe it ministered to all of us
[1:49:05] tonight. I believe it's an encouragement
[1:49:07] to all of us. Amen. We're just going to
[1:49:09] close in saying, [music] "I'm rich in
[1:49:11] faith and hope and love." You may feel
[1:49:14] poor in other ways tonight, but you're a
[1:49:15] rich people.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; You're a rich people. You have access to
[1:49:21] sources that the world doesn't have
[1:49:24] access unless they yield. We have access
[1:49:26] tonight. God bless you tonight. Let's
[1:49:28] sing a couple courses of this and we'll
[1:49:30] be [music] dismissed. The Lord bless you
[1:49:32] tonight in Christian love. Amen. How
[1:49:34] many believe you're rich in faith and
[1:49:36] hope and love? I got more than my share.
[1:49:39] Amen. Do we have that song?
[1:49:42] I'm rich in faith and hope and love. I
[1:49:47] got more than my share. And I'll be
[1:49:50] moving to a mansion just [music] over in
[1:49:53] glory. Where I'm rightfully I'm rich.
[1:49:57] Well, I'm [music] rich in faith, hope,
[1:50:00] and love. I got more than my share.
[1:50:03] [singing]
[1:50:05] [music] I'll be moving to my mansion
[1:50:07] over in glory. Well, I'm a rightful
[1:50:10] [music] land. My father owns a cattle on
