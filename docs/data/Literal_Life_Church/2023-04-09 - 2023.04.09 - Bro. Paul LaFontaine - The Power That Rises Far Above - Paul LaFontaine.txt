========================================

Ephesians chapter 1 starting at verse 18. the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead can you say Amen so this power is what raised Jesus from the dead when he raised him from the dead and set him in his own in his own right hand in Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head dead over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all praise be to God God is good this morning Heavenly Father we thank you for this Easter morning Lord we are rejoicing in what you have done for us and Lord we don't want it to be just a symbol or just some type of traditional thing that we look at but Lord we want the power that came from the resurrection to be living in US Lord God I pray that would be possible for every soul under the sound of our voice this morning and not only here but on the internet I pray whoever hears us that Lord I would have your anointing to speak words of encouragement Words of Life Words of Power Lord for we come not to the people with enticing words of man's Wisdom but with power and demonstration of what this word can do and Lord we live with testimonies all the time of what you're doing in the people of God around the world and here locally father so we know that you're Alive the song says you asked me how I know he lives he lives within my heart God that's the proof as we have something real within us we pray you'll bless every heart that's here this morning and encourage every life every family as we commit Our Lives to you this Easter morning in Jesus name we ask him amen God bless you may be seated this morning appreciated the the kids singing that such a joy to all of us and little Israel my my uh nephew there and he had his thumb up which complimented the song very well he's thumbs up amen we got the when we have Jesus we have joy blessed be his name praise the Lord today we celebrate the morning that our Lord rose from the grave and it's celebrated around the world and we're thankful for that we're thankful that people in the world acknowledge a lot of people acknowledge that he rose again there's some who don't believe it some that need proof and but there's some who are believers that believe he rose and this is the day that most of the world gives to celebrate the Lord raising from the grave and coming out of the grave and that when he come out of the Grave was a final Vindication and proof that he was truly everything that the word said about him that was the Vindication that was the proof that he was truly everything the word said about him there had to be a a proof to it uh we can say a lot of things but then people wait for the proof Jesus said things but he had the proof and he followed up with Vindication and so when he rose that was everything that was the Vindication and that was the proof that truly all the word had said about him uh and what he had proclaimed while he was on the earth in a Ministry three and a half years what he had proclaimed it came to pass and he said in three days if you destroyed this body if you if you put this in the ground if you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again and he proved what he said was true let me say something to everybody this morning God has never failed when he speaks something God has never failed his word and it always has come to pass and it always will God has a perfect track record people will fail you and you may have a lack of trust in people but we can trust God because his word has always come to pass and the resurrection is the proof of that at what Jesus said and what the word said he would do we know that it came to pass and we're celebrating that this morning we we want to go into the subject a little bit what Paul says here in Ephesians and uh by the world knowing that it's the Resurrection Sunday we also know some other things at least most of us we know that Jesus uh was both humanity and Divinity together how many believe that Jesus was both humanity and Divinity together as one man and uh we realize that the Bible says that the fullness the fullness of the godhead bodily was in his bodily in other words all of God was poured into that vessel and and so people don't understand and I'll just saying to you don't try to figure that out don't try to figure it out in your own mind anyway because when you try to figure out a man that has full Divinity and fully a man don't try to figure it out because you're going to get it all messed up hence niacia 325 A.D they got it messed up they were trying to figure out how God was in man and when man gets his intellect that's how we get messed up with splitting him into three different persons let me tell you don't try to figure that out with your mind ask God for a revelation of it can I get an amen this morning it comes by Revelation that we would even come close to understanding how man was full Divinity and how he's full humanity and so we know that but we also know that at the end of Jesus life there uh there was a very much of The Human Side displayed as a matter of fact as he come to the last days of his life and the last hours of his life if you know your Bible you realize Jesus when he come to the very end there was very much human in it when he come to the tragic court case when he was accused in court he was an innocent man and he was falsely accused when he come to the brutal treatment of his body when he come to the crucifixion and in a few moments I might elaborate on that a little bit knowing that it was Good Friday this past Friday and we we look at that we want to understand those things but his life at the end came to a turn that even the disciples didn't understand with the brutality and the crucifixion and the scourging and the mocking and the making fun of and he he lived the the last days of his life and you can't find God in any of it now early in his life when he started his ministry you could find God the supernatural God was working through his words in other words he'd speak and the blind eyes would be open he would touch people and they'd be completely healed numerous Miracles took place in the Supernatural God was speaking to him God brought him up to the Mount Transfiguration and said this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell so God was there but at the end of his life there's not many traces of God because God actually he was there but he withdrew himself because this man had Dakota Calvary as our lamb and he had to go to Calvary as a man because God couldn't be killed can you say man God could not see be displayed in our eyes anyway in this defeat in this scourging and and we know the story is that the disciples are wondering and and they're saying even in the I think the garden can say can't you to call for help all the soldiers everybody's taking count your Coffer up and Jesus said don't you think that I can call for thousands of Legions of angels and they would come and change us and he said but that the scripture might fulfill so that there was an obedience to what the Bible said can you say Amen had to be fulfilled and in that moment God as in our terms withdrew himself and so we we know that it was God in man but yet we see this this withdrawal because he had to go to Calvary as our lamb and uh in the last hours in the very last hours he even with went without any intervention of God at the cross there wasn't any intervention of God we're saying God God don't let this happen but you see the scripture had to be fulfilled and we had to be saved we needed a sacrifice you couldn't do it on your you weren't worthy enough no man was worthy enough somebody had to do it for us and so that's the reason there was no intervention of God in this act is because and in fact in fact he was so much left alone that he cried himself at the cross my God my God why has Thou forsaken me you remember he said that so this is evidence that he is feeling it he knows and he's crying out why have you forsaken that's the man crying out because he had to live in that moment that he felt forsaken even by God I'd ask for a raise of hands this morning how many has felt that way yourself he had to live where he's saying God why have you forsaken me God where are you God why and in the worldly terms the last of Jesus life felt like a defeat over and over again there was no God in it it felt defeated it was defeat in Man's eyes but she seen this morning let the record show that The Final End was not defeat and that's why we talk about the resurrection because as much defeat was there as much as God hath withdrawn himself I like the song that the choir is saying Jehovah Jehovah has the final say can I get an amen this morning and I'm glad to say that the final end was not a defeat but the final win was a victory the final end was not all of this uh being forsaken by God but you see the the there was not a defeat but when when the body was dead and in the grave and that was it and in a dark uh a cold uh grave with a stone road in front of it the power of God moved on that body and resurrected that body can you say praise the Lord Jehovah had the final say I just want to say to you when God's involved he'll have the final say of every every situation of every condition come on I should have get a bigger amen than that I know when you're dark and under a tunnel of something and under just under something it's hard for you to say Amen to that but you should say Amen because God has a perfect track record and when he's involved he gets the final say and I can tell you he's going to cause us to end in Victory and if he did it at the cross and he did it here in Jesus life then we find that there was a power and this is what he says in Ephesians there was a power that come upon and set Jesus it was so powerful that he'd come on his body and raised him from the dead far above principality has been in power so there was the power that raised him and and he did not just raise out of the graves and and then walk back into the same conditions again did you realize when God raised it when the power of God raised him up he did not just come back to earth again now we know that he walked a few days on Earth but this power did not keep him this power he actually went to hell he he he seen the soul preached to the souls in prison but then the power was down still on him he raised he raised past the grave he raised past the Earth he didn't come back into the same conditions again can you say man then the Bible says he raised far above and that's my message to you this morning when God raised him he raised far above the conditions again far above the Earth can you say Amen far above defeat somebody say praise the Lord how far did he raise him above principalities of both Powers he broke through every demonic Dimension can you say man this power was powerful enough to break through anything how far did he raise him above principality above power above might Dominion every name that is named the most famous name we've ever had in the world the Caesars even famous names today God raised his name above every name not only in this world but also in the world to come and have put all things under his feet I'm telling you this power raised him far above everything I should close and we should shout the rest of the day why because I find that the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power that's in a holy ghost believer's life you're going to tell me you can't raise out of situations you're going to tell me there's some situation that's too impossible you're going to tell your my situation is different my hurt my pain everything is different you're going to tell me that you can't tell me that because this power has power to raise above far above all things somebody say praise this Lord praise the Lord and so now he didn't just raise out of the Grave he didn't walk back into the same conditions which reminds me of some people that come to church and hear the power of God and don't respond and walk back into the same conditions again might be a lesson for us people do that out of habit because some people are comfortable there was a man that was prayed for by Brother Branham and he was he was temporarily delivered of demons that he was ready to destroy brother Branham and when he prayed for him the man fell at his feet and he was delivered but he was temporarily delivered he said he'll go back and take that Spirit again because he worships that spirit so the power of God was there to make a total Deliverance but he had become so accustomed to the spirit that he walked back into the same condition again he went back and fed on the same things again and invited that Spirit back how many know the Bible says as Jesus talked about he says a man he said he the house can be cleaned and when the house is Sanctified because the sanctification isn't enough I could use a little bit more help this morning sanctification isn't enough got a lot of people that come under the presence of God get Sanctified they feel good they feel better their Spirits have been released from them but that's not the final step can you say Amen he walks through Dry places and if you don't get that house filled seven other demons will come and fill that I'm speaking about what Jesus said that's how it works and so I'll tell you Jesus was not just raised back to Earthly conditions if he'd have showed up the same way they would have continued the persecution they would have continued the things and all that he was doing being persecuted of but I can tell you God had to raise them above the persecution above the defeat above Earthly conditions far above how many this morning got things that you've been through and you'd like to be lifted far above those things five of us all right praise the Lord that's enough I'll preach to you five praise the Lord he didn't just raise all the grave he didn't walk back into the same conditions the power of Resurrection moved in actually in a place far above all things to a position at the right hand of authority of God in a place called Heavenly places this is where the power of God that took the dead body of Jesus and raised him far above defeat and raised him past principalities far above and placed them in a place called Heavenly places and we've been taught by the word of God that that is not a feeling it's not a sensation I love the presence of God I feel I felt it I know that it's real but when he said Heavenly places it's not a feeling it's not that it gives us tingles can you say man the prophet has taught us that the Heavenly places is the believer's position in Jesus Christ somebody say praise the Lord he lifted Jesus to Heavenly places and I don't know if anybody noticed uh and scanned while I was reading about Jesus coming to Heaven places you probably didn't read it but I'm going to bring it up if you got your Bibles and if you don't you're they're gonna have to bring it up back there I want you to go to Ephesians 1 back a few verses to verse 3 where it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ did anybody notice that the same place Jesus was raised to is the same place Paul's teaching that every believer who has the Holy Ghost has been raised into Heavenly places we got the same position and guess what most Christians don't know it most Christians live below their privileges now I want to emphasize that because below your privileges is not where you're supposed to be living young people everybody below your privilege privileges is not where you're supposed to be living and the prophets of the church the church is living way below its privileges but my Bible says he raised them far above not below not leveling out on Earth not leveling out that we're scared of demons but it raised him above with his authority over demons it raised him above any name that's a that's been in heaven past present and future it raised him to Heavenly places that all things were placed under his feet and if that's the place Heavenly places it is and he said in Ephesians 1 3 that that's the place a Believer is his position in Christ then we ought to say it don't look like it in my life it doesn't look like it but that's where I am standing this morning Hallelujah whether you respond a lot or not I'm going to give the devil a black eye today this is a really good day to do it for me there's a lot of things that come in life that if you were to look at my heart behind the pulpit this morning and behind my heart I'm grieving I'm in mourning for the conditions of this world for the conditions of families for the devil's attack to our children and our young people if you were to look at my heart I'm grieving this morning I cried half the night I'm being honest with you but I'm going to stand here and bring the preaching of the resurrected power of God because it is our only hope and if I could help some help this morning I'll continue to give the devil a black eye the Saints are moved to the same place did anybody know that that the progression of science has been a type of the spiritual advancement of the church anybody remember that we came through in science the horse muggy days and of course that didn't take very much to develop of science we found a thing to ride horse and buggy and so that was Luther's day of justification then we come the church moved to Lutheran justification that was the horse and Bugattis and then we have the automobile developed uh I believe in the early 1900s that was Wesley's day we come to the message of sanctification and so the church moved along with the advancements of science we come into the automobile and that was that was fast boy the horse and buggy was slow the automobile was fast of course we got to stay within the speed limit amen only five amens on that too it's really strange but then we come to the airplane developed by science and so we move from the horse and buggy we moved to the automobile then we moved to the airplane and all of this is an advancement of the church and where it's come Luther Wesley Pentecost was the airplane I'm telling you anybody who's back in those days was flying high the shouting of the rejoicing the the gifts returned to the church my you talk about flying high and we look like we've come the highest we'd ever come but guess what science didn't stay with airplane then we come into the astronaut age which is Way Beyond what an airplane could go first man on the moon this this generation can you say amount taking uh isolated and taking a few people up and so now as the church has moved from the Pentecostal age to advancing into the astronaut age then we realized we're moving God is moving the church far beyond what we ever dreamed nobody would ever dream what we'd be Have astronauts nobody would ever dream we'd go to the Moon can you say amen and now science is investing more and more and more and all of it is to move Higher and Higher and if it says that in science then that's what God is doing in the church in the bride we're not staying in Pentecost we're not staying in Luther's day anybody that believes those churches and go to those are churches God bless you believe with all your heart all the truth God has given by high as the gospel Minister have to tell you there's more truth than justification there's more truth than Wesley's message there's more truth in what the charismatics has God has restored much more than that and the purpose is is to take the church Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher this is the eagle age the eagle flies higher than any other bird I like an eagle's view of things I don't want to be an Earthbound animal I don't want to be some animal that's on the earth that's all I ever see I want to be in this Eagle age I want to be looking far above so you know uh so did you know that science is working very hard and is there really is there to make being an astronaut and going into space available to anyone whosoever will did you know that the Tesla guy who I think he's already been up a few but listen now even though it's going to be offered eventually to everyone right now it's a very Selected Few that get to go on these little trips now friends I'm talking about spiritually now he's not calling the entire church world to these higher Realms in Christ he's calling the bride if you want to go there with him and you've got The Bravery of the Holy Ghost he'll take you to higher Heights this morning or you can stay where you're at but did you know that they're they want they're taking people and and not just astronauts now that's trained they're they're taking anybody basically who's rich and uh it's all the type here we're not in Luther's day we're not in Pentecost today but the power of the Resurrection moves the church far above currently it is only I looked this up just to show that I did my homework currently I said I wonder what what they're doing with this after who gets to go currently it's only available to those who can spend an average of 250 000 to 500 000 for a sub orbital trips and so and that's only about 15 a 15-minute ride to the edge of space and back so you're going to pay 250 000 to 500 000 for a 15-minute trip just to the edge of space but that's where we're at it's not just astronaut and astronauts if you got that kind of money Stevie it's kind of a goal isn't it yeah start a savings plan you know if you want to do it and save the money it's offered not just assets and so now and then and then they say or flights they're going to offer flights to actual orbit to go into space for more than 50 million percent though typically a longer trip than 15 minutes so you get to get longer into the heavenlies as an astronaut and you don't have to be an astronaut you don't have to be you don't have to be a popular person to be in the kingdom of God can you say man you don't have to have the right clothes you don't have to have a lot of riches can you say Amen to soar into the heavenlies by the Holy Ghost come in say Amen praise the Lord but you see now that's what the world is advancing in so now 50 million dollars per seat and so you have to say right now it's a select few who are rich but I can say to you in the name of the Lord God has made this very affordable to only Believers this morning he's made it very it is is a very select few it costs a lot to do it but but God has made it available for you to soar by the power of the Resurrection into the heavenlies this morning God has made it affordable for you because he paid the price at Calvary for the trip Hallelujah I'm having a good time I don't know about you but listen he's paid for our trip and he's made it affordable for me and you don't wanna you wanna know how to get there be filled with the Holy Ghost not religion now just sanctified God fill me with the genuine Holy Ghost not do's and don'ts not just wearing all the right things fill me with the full Holy Ghost convert me change me Lord change my heart change my desires and when he feels you you come under Ephesians 1 which is the Saints because it's to the Saints it's not to everybody else but he blows our minds and it says to the Saints God has already given us spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus in Heavenly places and I didn't have to pay 50 million for it I just had to give my life over to Christ he's made it affordable for everybody you ought to be blessed for that you have to pay 50 million a seat for this you don't have to you've got to surrender your life to Jesus Christ completely I'm sold out locked Stock and Barrel he has my life he has everything Change Me Lord [Music] I can't do that for you your parents can't do that for you your husband can't do that for you your wife can't do that for you your pastor can't do that for you it's when you get serious to God and say I need this Holy Spirit in my life I need you to change me Lord and then you fall under this thing you're being lifted by the power of God into Heavenly places into Heavenly places to rise far above the lust of this Earth to rise far above the dark grave and conditions that are around us now if you have your Bible still open to Ephesians I'll read that verse 18 Again Paul says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know things that you may know and I'm going to list three things that we know by him enlightening our eyes because really you know what it's all about what we can see spiritually that's why he said your eyes will need to be enlightened first before you understand your position in Heavenly places God needs to open your eyes and guess what there's not much joy as the kids were singing about this morning there's not much joy if you don't see your position in Jesus Christ because you know what you see you know what you always look at which isn't any Joy at all conditions of life family conditions and this life has temporal joys you get a nice truck you get a nice uh return on your taxes and then it's gone within hours temporal Joy so excited about that and by Wednesday where'd it go it's temporal this world will give you temporal Joys Jesus said I give you Joy not as the world I give you peace not as the world gives it so that shows the world can give a peace the world can give Joys but they're not Eternal they're not lasting not true joy and so now when your eyes are open to what were you really stand and I want you to catch this statement there's a difference in your standing in Christ and the state that you're in your standing is different than your state what state are you in well it's Michigan right now but the state your life is the state state your life is in the state your family is in right now the state that your marriage is in right now I can tell you it's a good thing your state is not the same as you're standing with the Lord my business is falling apart my my life seems like my head's about to burst because of the pressure all these conditions of this generation addiction I want to preach in the next few weeks about addictions addictions is the the number one thing in our nation people are addicted and don't just think it's the drug drug addict a lot of us get addicted to things and I want to give the reason why because I want to expose the enemy we're not called to live in addictions can you say Amen we have a joy in the fountain of the Holy Ghost that's far beyond any kind of drug but it's given by addictions and the state this world is and the state your life is in is not the same as you're standing in the Lord but if you're only looking at the state and not looking at your standing you will find no joy in that it will be grueling it will be everyday negative it will be ups and downs can you say Amen it will be you don't know what's coming to you tomorrow you don't know what's going to hit your family tomorrow can I get an amen oh I know I know I've got it all planned out and I've cushioned I've got cushion here and cushion here I got this life insurance policy and I got it and so any little bumps boom I can just bump bump bump against this cushion you don't have any cushion you don't have any Security in any job in any government can you say a man because God all he has to do is rip the cushion out and you're gonna fall there is no Eternal Joy there is no true joy in this in the state that we're in and the state of the world has come in its very worse with demons Powers Rising oh God Deliver Us from this place I pray bring this rapturing faith in our souls we need to get out of here can you say Amen if you don't feel that in your soul pray for the Holy Ghost because my soul is saying I'm tired of this world I'm tired of the perversion I'm tired of the perverts and I know it's the devil on them but I'm tired in the last two months the news says this increase you know what it is this increase in the perverts and perversions it's such you know what's happening that unconverted Soul that's laying there with all these demons that he's fed on for years movies and everything else it's all laying there laying there but when they see somebody on the news that's becoming a hero and popular it raises those demons within them and now the five percent that I talked about a few weeks ago just five percent of our population it's going it's going through the roof of people coming out I don't know who I am anymore so if I decide that I'm a girl and I'm it's it's perversion can you say man and I'm not ashamed to say it take me off anywhere you want to it's a perverted world it's the state this world is in but I'm preaching to you a resurrected power in Jesus Christ that'll raise you out of this world young person I'm preaching the power to you that will raise you above pornography that will raise you above perverted sex far above it to a holy life not that you're perfect in your flesh but to a consecrated holy life this power raises us high above so the devil's not got you under his feet but you get to a place you've got the devil under your feet can somebody praise the Lord you might feel like you're I'm under the feet of the Devil he's stomping me all over the place but I can tell you that's your state but you're standing with Christ is you're supposed to be with the devil under your feet praise the Lord so without enlightening our eyes and that's why it's so important uh that we see uh and our eyes are enlightened because if we see only this then it's discouraging it's it's hopeless if we only see our conditions of our broken families our corrupt world it's more it's more than clear to us our conditions we can see all of that we can see the the state that we're in if that's all we're looking at then we're doomed we need to see what Calvary has done for us and what the resurrection has done for us and that's what he's going to say here we need to see what Cal we needs our eyes enlightened that we know what Calvary has done for us and we know what the resurrection has done for us that's what I'm preaching to you this morning that do you know what Calvary has done for you do you or is it just a symbolism do you know what Calvary has done for you and your condition and do you know what the power of the Resurrection can do for you in your condition how does it happen your eyes have to be enlightened by Revelation didn't you say in the lateral see an age that they were blind and naked and didn't know it about that church of the last days they were blind and so what did they need I Salve I will give you I sap for your eyes that thou mayest see the message of the hour is I save it's revelation and now you're afraid to read it or listen to it no it's the revelations 3 I have to put on your eyes that you can see what's going on you can see what God said about you you can see your deliverance out of it I anoint your eyes with I said because God gives it we must be given eyesight to see something different than what we see in our lives it's too dark it holds no hope without God enlightening Our Eyes by the message it looks dim and depressing every day Paul says if we have hope in this life only we are of all men most miserable Paul do you have to be so negative we're having a pretty good life here I've got my life in order and I got a good job I just got a promotion we yeah we have hope here but he said if we have hope only in this life we are still of all men miserable I know that seems negative but it's not negative because our hope is in the Lord our hope is not in our money our hope is not in our retirement our hope is not in people yeah that's why the power of the Resurrection is needed because we're of all men most miserable for only looking at this has to be a supernatural energy and eyesight allowing us to see now before I go to the final text today and I'm moving along here I realize that our time is uh we're enjoying the children and such and I appreciate that they preached us a little message as it was but before we go into the final text I just want to say just a few minutes since this was Good Friday about this eyes being enlightened and seeing Calvary right anybody who sees Calvary Wright and the finished work of Calvary and what he did anybody who sees it by Revelation gets affected by it it's not a story in the Bible a lot of churches will read the story but unless God opens our eyes to what he did for you at Calvary you'll never have power to overcome and the more I look at this each year we look at it deeper last year we were here Friday night and we brother Brandon elaborated on what Jesus went through but it just keeps opening it up oh more and more and so you know there's a scripture that says in Revelations they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony it's an end time scripture but think about it now how did they overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony so there has to be a power in this blood and what it did for us that causes us to overcome everybody understand that they overcame by the blood of them by the word of their testimony Jesus didn't did you know that Jesus didn't shed his blood in just one place on the cross but four places if our answer is in the shed blood of that when he shed blood out of his body our attention should rise because that's where they overcome by the shed blood of Christ but he didn't just shed it on the cross when they pierced his side when they put the spikes through his hand no he shed it in four different places and what happened in the whole process on that Friday was I'm going to say this now with with liberty and with confidence what happened in the whole process on that Friday as Jesus went through the whole process that whole process on Friday was addressing every every need of the human being for Redemption including 2023 because it was a finished work it was a complete shedding of blood and you look deeper into it it addressed everything and our Bible says it in Isaiah 53 if you guys want to pull it up Isaiah 53 it says uh who hath believed our report who to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he's talking about Christ here when he comes prophecy he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief now notice this is the mighty conqueror no before he was the mighty conqueror he went through this what for for you and what was he going through what was he feeling those last few days he was despised he was rejected anybody ever been rejected before the same four people all right he was despised and rejected a man a man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs how is this tied together he bore the things that we would bear he felt everything that we would feel he had to feel it he had to feel what it meant to be lonely he had to feel friends rejecting him even his own disciples he had to feel being lonely without anybody in the world but just himself he had to feel that because why you would feel that frankly friends you would never be able to tell God he doesn't understand what I'm going through and there might be some people in here that have said that to God God just this is new he doesn't understand why I'm here to correct you about that because if this is our perfect lamb he experienced what life would be for us and he bore it can you say Amen he born our griefs he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him smitten stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I'm adding in verse six all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all so let me tell you something that scripture tells you you're not in a different category in the sense of your human flesh all we all of us that covers all kind of covers everybody I don't care how much pride you have all we like sheep have gone astray all of us in our own self are weak can you say Amen we've made mistakes we've made blunders even if you've hid them very well you're like a sheep that has gone straight and you will always go astray unless the Shepherd gets a hold of your life and all the sheep that have gone astray the answer is one thing and that's this lamb that's going to Calvary that whatever way we have strayed he's given us a sacrifice that we can come back to and say God you did it for me my shepherd did it for me you can see by Isaiah 53 was an effect on our condition whatever condition so to me gospel ministers and preachers in this message have to connect the finished work of Calvary to our current need you have to connect the finished work of Calvary your atonement to your current need and you cannot by the devil's lie that this particular need in my life including an emotional need is going to be satisfied by some other source I'll go ahead and let it out that's because we have addictions is because we're not getting our emotional needs satisfied and our soul satisfied so the Alternatives come up to the Forefront and we try them and get disappointed every time God has opened up a fountain in the House of David and when you drink from that it not only transforms the desires of the soul but has the power to fill your need emotionally preachers need to preach the finished work of Calvary and connect to the people to their current need or its Calvary is just a story Calvary my dear friend listening Calvary is just a story in the Bible unless you find the connection of your current need to the finished work at Calvary he paid it all he took care of it in the garden he's struggling he has a struggle in the garden and you know what the struggle was over God's will or his own will it was pretty intense because he was sweating and his his face had become so intense from the pressure and that battle of his own will that it was great like greats sweat drops of of blood and science says it got so intense that it turns into some blood sweat turns into blood that's the first time he shed his blood and guess what it was related to a struggle over his own will and God's Will has anybody ever had the same struggle is it tense in the court under pilate he's being falsely accused he's being ridiculed he's being made fun of he's being mocked there's a robe put on them to mock him as being King a purple robe and then the crown of thorns the next place he sheds blood a crown of thorns is crushed where where crushed in his head shed blood came from his head anyone ever had any battles in your mind anyone having him today you don't have to raise your hand but I'd say if you live in this world you have the battle of the Mind this age is mental this age is going insane people can't think straight it's everything that a Believer could do can he keep his heart in the word of God to keep his own sound thinking come on friends let's be real this isn't too thou this isn't 1995. this is 2023 and I'm here to tell you the atonement and the shed blood of Jesus Christ addressed every condition of this Modern Age he paid the price for you he shed blood in that area that this the mental conditions the insanity the addictions of the Mind the pornography and he shed blood there in his head nobody those soldiers didn't know what they were doing when they crushed it in blood came out of his head now we know what he was doing now we know what was taken but now we know why he had to shed blood from there maybe you can remember that this week when the devil's got your inner tailspin in your mind come on people maybe you can remember what this preacher has said to you that God did something for you God shed blood for that he shed blood at the whipping post 39 Stripes that's another place he shed blood and that's when anyone ever being wounded deeply like that and it was in his back but we know as I was talking to the kids that the co-op devotion on Friday morning I was talking to him about how the whip was done and the the pieces of metal and different things put at the end of the whip so that it's not just a whipping in a normal sense but that it would cut the Flesh and open up his flesh and all that is about opening up a wound and all these wounds where the flesh was just hanging down his back and we know we know if that person survived it'll take a long time but there the body would heal itself most the time they died but they didn't want them to die they wanted to suffer so there was a long healing process to Stripes going in his back but it was a it was it was it was looking ahead because Isaiah says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity and by his stripes we receive healing somebody raise your hand if you're sick this morning buy his stripes I'm Healed he already paid the price for my healing and though that would take days months to heal that back you've seen it in movies sometimes when it took days and months and sometimes years to get a full healing to that back and sometimes healing is a process but I can tell you it's not just the body naturally healing itself God provided in his atonement that for any sickness any cancer any disease we're not afraid of any of it because he paid the price for any disease to be healed somebody say Amen this morning this might work what my Lord means to me this morning he means so much more to me and then the shed Blood on the cross pierced aside Nails in his hands and in his feet blood of course came forth from there but then the pierced aside in Blood and water and Spirit came out and that's an important thing because we realized when when his Spirit came out praise the Lord the blood cell had to be broken and something had to come out of him why because we needed that same spirit to be able to live how many needed that Holy Ghost that come out of him the blood cell had to be broken so it would come out of him and come back on the day of Pentecost and fill the Believers he shed blood so you could have the Holy Ghost somebody ought to shout praise the Lord in this building this morning I can't get no help this morning [Applause] I told the kids Friday this is the most cruel death that had ever taken place in history this was cruelty he was mocked he was spit in the face he was innocent but he was falsely accused he was made fun of anybody ever had those situations in life and then I said why was it so cruel why such a cruel death why such cruelty such Relentless no holding back cruelty to a human body wise that's crudy I said to the kids for two reasons number one that he would experience what cruelty was because you're going to go through cruelty you're going to have people mocking you if you stand for Christ the people are going to make fun of you they're going to laugh at you you got an easy road if you don't make a full stand for Christ but if you do it you're going to be experiencing well he needed to experience that all cruelty no matter how cruel somebody could treat you he had to be he had to be treated it was such cruelty by the Roman which were the cruelest in their their treatment of prisoners two reasons why they there was such cruelty in this death he had to feel what extreme abuse he had to be abused because there would be people in this generation especially that were abused sexually abused mentally abused emotionally abused physically abused he had to be abused he had to be scourged he had to be mocked he be had to be be made fun of can you say Amen and it was extreme cruelty because he had to feel extreme abuse and cruelty and what it felt like so that you could never go to him to say God you don't understand he understands because he felt he felt he felt that cruelty I needed I know I need to move on can you give me just a few more minutes he felt he felt it because you would feel it it doesn't feel good to be betrayed the human Spirit can hardly handle it when somebody is falsely accused I didn't do that and they're saying that I did it the human Spirit can bear barely bear something of somebody falsely accusing or putting them down or gossiping about we don't take it very well sometimes we can dish it out but we don't like it coming back at us that's cruelty can you say Amen that's cruelty and God needs to remove that cruelty out of your life you don't want to be treated that way in your gossip he had to feel the extreme abuse and it was extremely cruel death it was secondly an extremely cruel death because let's go back to what the prophet has said to us in the message cruelty of sin it had to be the most cruel death because sin is Relentless sin is the most cruelty that can come to a human being people can do one thing but sin is cruel I got a lot of people nodding their heads and say yes brother Paul what my life has been through anybody listening maybe you've had a pretty cushioned life but there's some people sitting here that's been saved by grace but sin they can tell you sin was cruel to their lives destroyed their Spirit drugs destroyed how they think properly sin never sin is only sin is only a a some joy for a temporal time but every time it never ends up right it's cruel to your life had to feel the extreme but because sin is cruel and it was extremely cruel death because of how sin would be so cruel to us with broken families Children of Divorce affairs alcohol should I go on and on and on depression he went through all of it the Bible says when he was across the table from Judas says that his Spirit was troubled within him why because he knew what Judas was and he knew Judas would stand across the table and he had to stand he had to be across the table from a man who looked him in the face his own disciple and he was pretending he was hiding that he had betrayed him and Jesus had to be courteous to him had to look across the table but his Spirit was groaning because he was getting ready to betray him how many of you have ever felt that before he experienced all of it in the last few hours of his life he experienced broken families children of divorced Affairs alcohol sin is cruel it it produces drugs addictions sin is fun on the outside but it is relentlessly cruel to your life how many who's been there done that can say Amen Brother Paul's sin is never comes out right it it messes with your life it's cruel that's why Calvary had to be a cruel death cruelest death because sin is cruel to us young people is the ones that need to be really listening choose that path and it's nothing but cruelty to your life to your family to your future marriage everything it's nothing but Cruelty Without Christ don't choose the path of sin choose the path of righteousness in Jesus Christ choose the right path [Applause] nobody will be able to make that choice for you parents can't make it I can't make them if I could I would make it for you because I love you enough to do it but nobody can make that choice for you you choose sin watch the cruelty come to your life it's only fun for a season he had to feel rejection he had to feel betrayal he had to feel Judas betraying him he had to take offensive words false accused loneliness no friends even his disciples bailed out at the last minute he had to endure a cold a cold shoulder from people been there done that got the T-shirt disrespect the cold shoulder gossip and eventually killed and sealed up in a dark tomb our sacrificial lamb went through all of this for us he covered all the cruelty of a human experience his blood covered it all to redeem you my brother and sister his blood covering it all so that he could redeem you the knowledge of Christ's blood being shed for you is powerful in itself the enlightenment of revelation of what Christ's blood has done for you is powerful just in itself I haven't even got to the resurrection power yet I'm just talking about the enlightenment of what Calvary has done for your life that in itself should have power in your life to rise in Victory and you're singing he did it for me you can't say Lord you don't understand this he did it for me he did it for me and so I don't care what you have or what you've been through you've followed the blood-stained path that I'm preaching to you this morning if you follow the blood-stained path the Via Dolorosa the called the way of suffering I was there in Jerusalem and I walked the entire way and but I've walked that way I've walked that way with my Lord through many experiences in life but listen the Via Delarosa the way of suffering if you follow the blood-stained path that was broken through for you if you follow that path young person you will come to a victory in Jesus Christ the greatest thing and I'm going to close on this I believe I'm going to close on this I'm not making any promises but the greatest thing is the story did not stop with all the cruelty now I want to make this point and I made it to the kids in the simplest way I could hopefully some of them caught it I've talked about all the cruelty they put him in a grave all the way he was treated and I asked him have you been treated bad by somebody have you felt alone have you felt you had no friends have you been bullied have you been made fun of for because your ears look funny yeah Jesus was made fun there's no Beauty we should desire him so if there was no Beauty which desire he was probably made fun of for his looks he attempted at all point he experienced it all and so now I told the kids this one thing but guess what what's the answer to all this what was the answer God raised Jesus and guess what he rose above all the cruelty if I didn't have that last chapter of the book we are of all men most miserable and it would be discouraging because we would continue to live and guess what we have a victim mentality today is that you've been victimized you can stay in a rut of always feeling like you're being victimized it's prevalent in our generation if you believe I'm telling the truth Say Amen it's a victim in it was Jesus a victim but Jesus didn't keep his victim mentality kids he didn't keep his I've been treated cruel I've been treated cruel sometimes I'm just going to give some parents some advice is when the kid comes to the pity party they call me bad names and sometimes you gotta act and you got to go talk to the other parents and work it out but but sometimes you just tell the kids yes that's what life is and I can't guarantee you that people aren't going to make fun of you instead of saying my kid has been done wrong and I'm going to bring it before the church and the elders and we're going to settle this thing because somebody's done my kid wrong and so now you settle it and next week somebody does your kid wrong again because that's life that's an imperfect World shouldn't we rather teach that that you're going to get criticized you're going to get bullied sometimes can you say Amen but there's a Christ that you can look to that can give you the upper Edge on the enemy and I said to the kids in all his cruelty and darken the grave he rose above it and I'm here to tell you this morning you need to rise above it the power of the Resurrection says you need to rise above it whatever they've treated you like it's time to rise above it it's time to let the power of the Resurrection get you past your past Jesus did not stay in the grave Jesus did not stay on the earth that was being cruel to him but he rose high high above it far above it all something tells me that he gives me the power through Revelation and Enlightenment of the word he can give me the power of God to rise above any kind of treatment this world would give me broken families broken homes his power Rose above it all somebody said praise the Lord Rose so high not back to Earth or back to the same it raised above what else would Enlighten us and here's the last scriptures in in Isaiah come back to Ephesians chapter 1. he says the eyes of your understanding Ephesians 1 18. I'm closing now the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know know what what do we need to know when he opens your eyes you're going to know this about the resurrection in your position that is that ye may know number one what is the hope of his calling and that in the Amplified says you're going to have a hope and a confident expectation with Divine with a Divine guarantee this hope is not going to fall through there's a Divine guarantee with this hope so one thing you need to know is that the hope that we hold in our heart comes with a Divine guarantee and what the riches of the glory of this inheritance of the Saints well that was good enough just to have a Divine guarantee of my hope now I'm a spiritual billionaire I have an inheritance Within Me I'm a rich man spiritually if you're a Believer with the Holy Ghost this morning you are wealthy in The Inheritance that God has given you this is not talking about your your your your your uh your state that you're in it's talking about you're standing and your standing says that you have a hope that has a Divine guarantee and you are rich with an inheritance that God has given you and you didn't deserve it but you have it now as a Believer you're a rich person I'm rich in faith and hope and love I gotten more than my share I'll be moving to my Mansion Just Over in glory where I'm a right fooler well I'm rich in faith and hope and love yeah I've gotten more than my I'll be moving to my Mansion Just Over in glory where I'm a rightful I'm in Aaron Jesus Christ of all things I own it all when Jesus purchased it he gave it to me too please be to God somebody shout praise the Lord emotional yes I am emotional and now I have all the children wide awake and I can preach another hour some of the adults woke up when I sang like that no wonder my dad did that all the time we have a very rich inheritance and number three it's not done can you imagine this we're not done says now we have and what and we know what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which means a mighty power working in us now that is unlimited that's what I mean we have a power that's working in us that's Unlimited so we're rich in inheritance we have a hope that with a Divine guarantee we have a mighty power working in us that is unlimited and it's the same power that caused Jesus to rise above far above all principality and power I'll tell you friends you read this and I'm just going to end this by saying that's all good news if you look at around you it's all bad news but this is good news and there's no bad in it it's all good and I just tell the devil this morning I don't care what's going on in my life and the trials and all the things that I'm burdened about I'm gonna enjoy this for the next 10 minutes in this service I'm going to enjoy it this week and I'm going to tell the devil I defy you Satan I defy you forgetting my eyes on just the state that I'm in I'm gonna look at my standing in Jesus Christ and my standing says I'm rich in faith and hope and love I have a hope with a Divine guarantee I have a power working within me can you say Amen that is an unlimited power that's raising me higher and higher each day that's who I am in Jesus Christ that's what I own I'm sitting in Heavenly places but if you look at that's around you you're not going to see yourself sitting in Heavenly places but you got to tell the devil that's where Jesus said I'm sitting it's all good news the bad news Was Defeated with our sin the good good news is Jesus Sherry used to sing that when she was a little girl good news is he's risen from the dead the good news is it's us he's came to save the bad news Was Defeated with our sin the good good news is Jesus Christ is coming back again amen no other result a reaction to these scriptures than Joy how is it those kids sang a song about Joy this morning in Jesus is my joy in my position is my joy it's all positive none of it negative guess what I'm giving myself permission today to look away from my state that I'm in and look at this and enjoy it I used to tell some preachers could we please quit arguing about the resurrection and start enjoying the resurrection could we keep trying stop trying to figure it out and preach the next glaring thing about the resurrection and how it's all going to take place and transpire I don't really care about the details of it I just wanted to raise me can you say Amen stop worrying about the resume stop debating it start enjoying it Believers this morning Brothers and Sisters in Christ start enjoying this power of the Resurrection let it raise you far above your state that you're in because your state is different than you're standing and I stand Justified before the Lord and in his eyes that's my that's my standing with the Lord that's my position enjoy it with all things under your feet and brother Brandon says as I close in total Deliverance I don't know if you have that quote back there it says all Jesus Works was complete everything was complete total delivered can you say amen he totally delivered the leopard from leprosy he totally delivered the woman with a blood issue her from Richard he totally delivered the world from sin when he died at the day of the atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need for us to live underprivileged people you're not poor you're not underprivileged your state may say you're poor you don't have nothing you don't have nothing of God but that's not what your standing says you're not underprivileged people devil I'm not an underprivileged believer there's no such thing as underprivileged believers there's no need for us to live in a defeated State how many can say Amen to that won't you stand with me this morning so I you know that I'm for sure closing the service as long as you keep saying amen there's no need for us to live in a defeated State we are not underprivileged children there's no need for us to live in a defeated State because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost we don't have to we we have the devil we don't have to have the devil dictate to us Christ delivered us total Deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin notice now delivered us from Habits delivered us from Talking delivered us from The Black Guard and I said what is that so I looked it up The Black Guard is a man that's not honest he's not an honest man he delivered us from the dishonest man The Black Guard he delivered us from all kinds of smutty things wow is that what year is this 1959 there's muddy things in 1959 I'd say that quotes more for today in 2023 but Calvary delivered us young people from the smut the perversion that's on social media tick tock go ahead 50 of Americans just gobbled up 50 Americans have it and we've got States now that are trying to get rid of it and change laws it's so dangerous when they look into it China where it comes from China won't even allow their children to look at it until they're 14 years old and China will only let the teenagers on the internet for two I think it's just an hour hour 40 minutes a day that's it that's all why because they're smart enough to know this affects the kids brains it affects the adults brains it brings SMUD into their lives it teaches them smut what a world we live in but I have an atonement that will deliver us completely from the smut of this world he totally delivered us and put us into his hands completely it is a total a total Deliverance hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] if you be risen with Christ set your affections on things above look at where you're at this morning sitting in Heavenly places in Christ far above the state that you're in you keep looking at it you're going to be defeated but if you get your eyes lifted up in Revelation this morning my position is more important than the state I'm in if I keep looking at my position I'm going to be drawn out of the state that I'm in I'm going to live in Victory blessed be his name brother look up he said when my men's Hearts fail for fear when Wars of rumors of wars fearful sights in the heavens yeah UFO sightings all over the place now all over the country we were told what that was they don't know what it is to this day investigating Angels because judgment is just upon us he sends his investigating Angels just before judgment and now there's just a mass of these things showings and they can't explain what they are all over California hovering over the Pentagon they can't explain it but we know what it is we're close to judgment God sent us a message to tell sons of God who they are that's another place that we can be ruling and reigning from in this life now Heavenly places Jesus praise the Lord God bless you this morning Happy Easter happy Easter it's one of the happiest ones can you say man not because of the state that I'm in but because of the standing I am with Jesus Christ don't underestimate the power of his resurrection it wasn't two thousand years ago it can work in your life now and raise you far above the cruelty of this world
