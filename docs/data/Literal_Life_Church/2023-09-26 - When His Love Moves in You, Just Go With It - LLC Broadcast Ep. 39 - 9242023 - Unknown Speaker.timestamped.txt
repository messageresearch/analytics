[5:40] your when
[5:44] the
[5:45] rise and I run to hide Lord in
[5:53] you I find my Hiding
[5:58] Place
[6:00] Lord in
[6:02] you I find my Hiding
[6:09] Place Matthew 18 and verse 21 and then
[6:12] came Peter to him and said Lord how
[6:16] often should shall my brother sin
[6:19] against me and I forgive
[6:22] him uh till seven times and Jesus saith
[6:25] unto him I say it not unto thee until
[6:27] seven times but until 70 *
[6:31] 7 so you just put that math together get
[6:35] your calculator and uh total all that up
[6:38] and you see um a picture of the Divine
[6:42] love of God Amen a picture of the
[6:44] Forgiveness of God there's no restraints
[6:47] on it can you say Amen so in his in his
[6:51] response to Peter then he goes into this
[6:54] Parable that says therefore is the
[6:56] Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain
[6:58] King which would taken account of his
[7:00] servants and when he had begun to reckon
[7:02] one was brought unto him which owed him
[7:05] 10,000 talents now the scripture here is
[7:08] given a pretty large amount and I looked
[7:12] at it yesterday you translate that into
[7:13] our money today and it's about $34
[7:17] billion so it's almost almost an
[7:19] exaggeration and you're going to see why
[7:21] in just a minute because it's almost if
[7:23] the king knew and this servant knew
[7:25] there there really wasn't a way probably
[7:27] to pay that back it was so huge reminds
[7:30] us of our debt to the Lord can you say
[7:33] Amen we owe him everything and so when
[7:35] he had begun to reckon one was brought
[7:37] into him which owed him 10,000 talents
[7:39] for but for as much as he had not to pay
[7:42] his Lord commanded him to be sold and
[7:45] his wife and children and all that he
[7:47] had and payment to be made because
[7:50] that's what they did the Old Testament
[7:52] uh they they would sell the family they
[7:54] had to sell their children they had to
[7:55] sell uh their land if they got in debt
[7:59] the servant therefore fell down and
[8:01] worshiped him saying Lord have patience
[8:04] with me and I will pay and I will pay
[8:06] thee all then the Lord of that servant
[8:09] was moved with compassion and loosed him
[8:13] and forgave him the debt so I want you
[8:16] to notice the action was to forgive all
[8:19] of the debt but first he was moved by
[8:22] something he was moved this King was
[8:25] moved by something and he was moved with
[8:28] compassion amen and his move being moved
[8:32] with
[8:33] compassion uh he was able to then take
[8:35] an action of loosing this man and
[8:37] forgiving it forgiving his debt and if
[8:39] you don't know the rest of the parable
[8:41] we'll finish it but the same servant
[8:43] went out and found one of his fellow
[8:45] servants which owed him a 100 Pence and
[8:48] he laid laid hands on him and took him
[8:50] by the throat saying pay me that thou
[8:52] owest and his fellow servant fell down
[8:54] at his feet and besought him saying have
[8:57] patience with me and I will pay the all
[9:00] and he would not but went and cast him
[9:01] into prison till he should pay the debt
[9:04] so when his fellow servants saw that it
[9:05] was done they were very sorry and came
[9:08] and told their lord all that was done
[9:10] then his Lord after he had called him
[9:12] said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I
[9:14] forgave thee all that debt because thou
[9:16] desirest me shouldest not thou also have
[9:19] had compassion on the fellow servant
[9:22] even as I had pity on thee and his Lord
[9:24] was wroth and delivered him to the
[9:26] tormentors till he should pay all that
[9:29] was do unto him so likewise shall my
[9:31] heavenly father do also unto you if ye
[9:34] from your hearts forgive not everyone
[9:38] his brother their trespass I want to
[9:40] speak on when his love when his Divine
[9:43] love begins to move in you Just Go With
[9:47] It Just go with it and something was
[9:50] moved in the heart of this ruler and he
[9:52] was moved with compassion and when he
[9:55] was moved a certain way he acted on that
[9:58] and he forgave
[9:59] so he acted upon what his heart was
[10:02] being moved to do it's important that we
[10:05] not only are moved but that we act upon
[10:08] the way that we are moved um it's
[10:11] important that if the Lord leads us and
[10:13] calls us and we feel that and
[10:15] particularly this morning I'm going to
[10:16] get into his his Divine love and I'm I'm
[10:20] reminded of the examples um in brother
[10:23] brandom's life is that when something
[10:24] happened to him that he said something
[10:27] come over him and when he was challenged
[10:29] by demon Spirits then something come
[10:32] over him he said he said oh I wish I
[10:33] could have that all the time but
[10:35] something was able to come over him that
[10:37] was different than his human love
[10:39] different than his thinking different
[10:40] than his mind because some of the
[10:42] situations with demonic power you would
[10:44] normally be afraid of it you would be
[10:46] thinking what do I do do I run what do I
[10:49] do so your mind is always trying to
[10:50] think what do I do in this situation
[10:52] then something grave greater begin to
[10:54] move his heart and all that thinking was
[10:56] washed away and he reacted according to
[10:58] the love of God which by the way the
[11:01] love of God is a stronger Force than any
[11:04] demon power and so when it moved on him
[11:07] he chose to act upon what was moving in
[11:10] his heart and thus he forgave he he he
[11:13] had Power Authority in the name of Jesus
[11:16] Christ and all that became the power to
[11:18] break the power of the enemy so now when
[11:21] God moves on us when this love moves on
[11:23] us then we should move with that and act
[11:25] upon that and this is what this ruler
[11:27] did when he was moved with something he
[11:30] acted on it in this case he forgave when
[11:33] he was when he was moved with with this
[11:36] uh a spirit of compassion then we
[11:39] realized that it would not it would be
[11:41] contrary to our thinking uh it wouldn't
[11:44] be normal for us to to react this way to
[11:47] forgive in other words the normal
[11:49] thinking would just be to respond that
[11:52] that we think it through and he's got
[11:54] all of this debt making maybe he can set
[11:56] up a payment plan our our mind maybe
[11:58] maybe or the worst case scenario
[12:01] scenario is to basically say no no no
[12:03] you've done this you're finished you're
[12:05] done we're putting you into prison this
[12:07] is a lot of debt that's what our Norm
[12:09] because I'm not helping the guy by
[12:10] forgiving him and so you've got all this
[12:13] and so the Mind thinks through thing
[12:15] when this ruler in the parable was moved
[12:18] with compassion he acted on the
[12:20] compassion but he didn't act upon what
[12:22] he would thought cuz he would if he
[12:24] would have thought he would have talked
[12:25] himself out of forgiving him the mind if
[12:29] it was given time to reason with this it
[12:32] would possibly override this compassion
[12:34] that he felt the mind would override if
[12:37] you're thinking sensibly it would not be
[12:39] to forgive this debt but to teach this
[12:41] guy a
[12:43] lesson the mind will override this so
[12:45] now I've been pondering a little bit
[12:48] this Divine love that we've been
[12:49] preaching about and uh I've been
[12:51] thinking about it and deeply in in in
[12:54] working in the people of God and
[12:56] particularly working in me this divine
[12:58] Capstone love working in me and thinking
[13:01] about as we went over its
[13:03] characteristics and we went over its
[13:05] actions and all the points in 1
[13:07] Corinthians 13 of the excellent way
[13:09] we've gone over those things now and
[13:11] hopefully I can spend time and put it
[13:13] together in a little booklet or
[13:14] something to get you all the quotes and
[13:16] the scriptures pretty soon but so but so
[13:18] now we learned that it was a when when
[13:21] God comes in and we act this way it's a
[13:23] different course than human love it's a
[13:25] different action than human love it's
[13:27] something greater it's a for it's a
[13:29] presence Divine love is not a teaching
[13:33] uh it's not mind over matter it's not a
[13:35] mind over matter exercise it's a
[13:37] presence it's a force it's his presence
[13:40] he's the source Divi Divine love so when
[13:43] he shows up that is the best of his love
[13:45] can you say that is his love so it's
[13:47] more than a teaching it's not mind over
[13:49] matter and some exercise in our mind it
[13:52] moves deep and if it moves deep it comes
[13:55] out and it wants to express that Divine
[13:58] love
[13:59] and then when it's a person is moved by
[14:02] it and and when somebody acts upon that
[14:05] Divine love then something different
[14:07] happens every time than the expected
[14:10] outcome somebody say praise the Lord
[14:13] something Supernatural can happen
[14:15] something great can happen when love
[14:18] projects Sovereign Grace takes over the
[14:20] situation and there's no demon greater
[14:23] than that Divine love the problem is is
[14:25] when it moves upon us we've got to let
[14:27] it we got to go with it
[14:30] we got to trust it we can't let this
[14:33] mind interrupt the moving of the spirit
[14:35] of God so now we can we can start at a
[14:37] very basic Point here this morning with
[14:40] the scripture John
[14:43] 3:16 which is quoted probably more than
[14:45] any other scripture in the world in
[14:48] Christian Realms but in the world
[14:50] everybody knows John 3:16 and so I I'm
[14:53] uh it's quoted more than any other and
[14:56] yet the question is how many people
[14:58] really understand John
[15:01] 3:16 so it says for God so loved the
[15:07] world that he
[15:09] gave so that's what I'm preaching this
[15:11] morning God himself was moved as he
[15:15] looked at humanity and looked at the
[15:17] humanity that has fallen and as soon as
[15:19] they had fallen God was moved by
[15:22] something God in himself in the core of
[15:25] himself was moved by love his own love
[15:29] that he had within him but he was moved
[15:31] by it God so loved the he could have had
[15:34] a lot of responses to the condition of
[15:36] the
[15:38] world he has judgment he could have
[15:41] responded first with
[15:43] judgment but he wasn't moved by judgment
[15:45] first he wasn't moved by his law first
[15:49] he wasn't moved by the thought I told
[15:51] them not to do that and they did it
[15:54] anyway he was not moved by all the other
[15:56] characteristics that's in God the first
[15:59] thing that God was moved in his heart
[16:01] with for this world in its condition is
[16:04] he was moved with his love if God's
[16:07] heart wasn't moved to love you you
[16:09] wouldn't even be here this morning you
[16:10] wouldn't have salvation this morning you
[16:12] wouldn't have a desire to serve God but
[16:15] God so loved the world that that now he
[16:18] has he's moved by this but his love was
[16:21] not just moved he took action God so
[16:25] loved that he gave his only begotten son
[16:29] John 3:16 is is something that we know
[16:32] but look at look at what it says here
[16:34] he's seen the condition of the world in
[16:35] man it was fallen and something moved
[16:38] within him something moved within God
[16:41] for you he was moved with compassion he
[16:43] was moved God's first reaction was not
[16:46] judgment what a bunch of losers man I
[16:49] created them and I did all these things
[16:51] what a bunch as first response is my
[16:53] goodness what in the world is you know
[16:56] what a bunch of sad losers that's not
[16:59] what we have coming out of God love
[17:01] moved him can you say amen and in his
[17:05] thought that love moved him to think in
[17:08] his
[17:09] thoughts he his love moved him to start
[17:12] thinking thoughts and you know one of
[17:14] the thoughts he seen and thought in his
[17:16] mind a lamb slain yes amen this is all
[17:21] in God's thoughts because if you know
[17:22] your Bible he said that there was
[17:25] there's ones written in the Lamb's Book
[17:27] of Life who was SL L before the
[17:30] foundation of the world so in these
[17:33] great movement of God's love and
[17:35] something in him just churned and
[17:37] stirring in his heart with love then his
[17:40] thoughts begin to come to what what what
[17:42] am I going to provide what am I going to
[17:44] provide for them so in his thoughts all
[17:46] this happened before you were even born
[17:48] before sin came into the picture God
[17:51] went through all this in his thoughts
[17:52] and he seen a lamb slain before the
[17:55] foundation of the world before you
[17:57] sinned before you did anything wrong God
[18:00] thought it through and his love moved to
[18:03] provide a lamb for your sin somebody
[18:05] ought to shout praise the Lord this
[18:07] morning it's all happening in God's
[18:10] thoughts and he's moved by love a lamb
[18:13] slain this is what they would need to be
[18:15] saved oh they need a way out they need
[18:18] an answer all this was going on in the
[18:20] back part of God's mind before the
[18:22] foundation of the world it's scriptural
[18:25] he's seen you he's seen your Fallen
[18:28] condition he was moved with love he was
[18:31] thinking of you he thought through the
[18:33] whole scenario of a lamb being slain for
[18:37] you his love was moving him in these
[18:40] kind of thoughts oh God help me to get
[18:43] this across this morning if love starts
[18:46] to turn in your heart stay with it go
[18:49] with it and let thoughts come from that
[18:53] what can I do to forgive that person
[18:55] what can I do to love that person how
[18:57] can I Point them to the way out
[19:00] everybody's going to criticize them
[19:02] everybody's going to judge them but Lord
[19:04] you have put Divine love within me his
[19:07] love was moving in these kind of
[19:09] thoughts but then those thoughts were
[19:11] materialized and they weren't just
[19:12] thoughts they became reality and he
[19:14] acted out of his love God God was moved
[19:17] by love and he gave his only begotten
[19:19] son his love moved in him so much that
[19:22] he acted on it he went with
[19:25] it even before he could give his son
[19:28] though he was already moved in the
[19:31] Garden of Eden when man fell he was
[19:34] already moved with love and compassion
[19:35] and Reconciliation and looking for a way
[19:38] to find Fellowship again it wasn't Adam
[19:40] running back to God saying God forgive
[19:43] me I'm at the altar I have sinned no he
[19:46] did what a lot of us do we go hide with
[19:48] our sin we hide in our shame we hide in
[19:52] our gift so it wasn't Adam and Eve
[19:54] running after God let me tell you
[19:57] something when I was 12 12 years old I
[19:58] came to the Altar and I did this and I
[20:00] did that and I did no no no no no no no
[20:03] if you come it's because God's already
[20:05] calling you to come and he loves you
[20:07] enough to call your heart if you've got
[20:10] something laying there as I want more of
[20:11] God it's because he put that there so
[20:14] before the son could come because it
[20:16] would be a matter of time before he
[20:17] could bring his his only begotten son
[20:19] and send him to Calvary before that
[20:21] could happen man's already fallen and
[20:23] God is rushing down man Adam wasn't
[20:25] looking for God God came looking for
[20:28] Adam because what his love was moving
[20:30] within him he wanted reconciliation
[20:33] comes over they're hiding behind the
[20:35] bushes somewhere and so God says Adam
[20:37] where are you and he says you know we're
[20:40] back here uh uh we're naked we're hiding
[20:43] ourselves who told you you were naked
[20:44] you know the scenario but God is running
[20:47] after uh I'll repeat it again our dear
[20:50] brother Ron Spencer who who said that a
[20:54] third of the Angels fell in heaven and
[20:57] God never moved moved on it but one son
[20:59] and daughter fall and God's rushing to
[21:02] make
[21:04] reconciliation what is man that thou art
[21:07] mindful of him it's better than the
[21:10] Angels you have a position of the love
[21:13] of God being towards you that's better
[21:14] than the
[21:15] Angels don't you feel L this morning
[21:18] don't you may reach your back say God I
[21:20] live my hands no one's loved me like
[21:23] you've loved me Lord we're living in a
[21:25] world that nobody loves anybody and the
[21:26] Love Has Gone cro cold and that's why
[21:28] people act the way they do cuz they're
[21:30] not loved right from a child they're not
[21:31] Lov right but I can tell you I don't
[21:33] care what family you come from there's a
[21:35] God that's churning in his heart his
[21:37] heart is stirring because he loves you
[21:39] so
[21:42] much said what are you doing behind the
[21:44] bushes there come out here and and and
[21:47] when he did he threw some skins slain
[21:50] some animals the blood was on the Skins
[21:52] he said he threw these over put these on
[21:54] you I'll take care of this and what is
[21:55] he doing his blood is finding a a place
[21:58] for Fellowship even before he sent his
[22:00] only begotten son he's trying his love
[22:03] is trying to find a place of
[22:05] reconciliation I just need some
[22:07] fellowship again with you I'm not going
[22:09] to leave you out there by yourself come
[22:10] out of those bushes I say to you this
[22:13] morning whoever is listening come out of
[22:14] those bushes come out of your shame come
[22:17] out of your guilt come out from of the
[22:20] bushes and by the way get rid of your
[22:22] covering of religion because religion is
[22:24] a covering to hide your sin religion is
[22:28] a covering and they had they had sewn
[22:30] fig leaves together to cover their
[22:32] private parts God said take those off
[22:35] it's only blood that's a proper covering
[22:37] put these lamb skins on
[22:39] [Applause]
[22:41] you but you dare stay in the bushes with
[22:43] your religious covering come out here
[22:45] and I'll give you a covering I'll give
[22:48] you
[22:49] blood somebody say praise the
[22:53] Lord so even before he could give his
[22:55] son he's calling I want you I want you
[22:58] your fellowship I want you back it was
[22:59] love moving in him to say that he threw
[23:01] some skins to him from a killed lamb
[23:04] around their bodies and he found a place
[23:06] to begin reconciliation his love Found A
[23:11] Door of Hope found a place it wasn't his
[23:15] son yet but he found a place to start in
[23:19] 2 Corinthians chapter 2
[23:22] Paul was moved to tell the church to
[23:25] forgive a really bad brother in the
[23:27] church bad man cuz in 1 Corinthians the
[23:30] Corinthian Church this guy was um having
[23:33] sexual relations with his um stepmother
[23:36] I believe it was and uh it was in the
[23:38] church he was coming to church he was
[23:39] having communion he was doing all this
[23:41] stuff and they weren't rebuking it they
[23:42] were like oh he's a brother and then
[23:44] everybody was kind of hiding it and he
[23:46] rebuked that church you don't hide that
[23:47] thing you call that thing out that's the
[23:49] love of God
[23:52] too and so but then when they called it
[23:54] out and and and and rebuked him and
[23:56] dealt with it cuz Paul said you got to
[23:58] deal with this there's sin in the camp
[24:00] and a A little leaven leavens the whole
[24:03] lump you wonder why preaches preachers
[24:06] have to correct things well it's the
[24:08] holy spirit because if you let sin go on
[24:10] in the camp it'll start affecting the
[24:12] rest of the young people and the rest of
[24:14] the church so he told them what to do
[24:17] and they did it and then he wrote him
[24:18] another letter in 2 Corinthians chapter
[24:20] 2 and he he's moved in his heart he
[24:23] senses in his spirit that this boy's
[24:25] changed his ways and he's he's asked for
[24:28] forgiveness he's asked for repentance to
[24:29] the church now he's coming he's
[24:31] obviously a changed man something is
[24:34] happening in his life and he tells the
[24:35] church it's time to forgive him so by
[24:38] Paul's letter they were moved brought
[24:40] him brother you're reinstated to the
[24:42] church you have repented and we restore
[24:45] you so he says so he doesn't get
[24:47] discouraged and the devil doesn't get
[24:49] advantage of this situation that's where
[24:51] he says we're not ignorant of Satan's
[24:54] devices I could read these to you you
[24:55] read them on yourself at your homework
[24:57] read this is all in the Bible we're not
[24:59] ignorant of Satan because what can
[25:00] happen if forgiveness doesn't come Satan
[25:03] WS havoc and creates I shouldn't say
[25:05] creates but makes more problems because
[25:07] there's no
[25:09] forgiveness there's no restoring of
[25:12] Fellowship now the devil really takes
[25:14] that
[25:15] life if there's just judgment and no
[25:17] mercy if there's no love moving in the
[25:21] congregation then the devil actually
[25:23] makes it worse for that
[25:25] person is anybody hearing what I'm
[25:27] saying
[25:29] it's time to be a mature church it's
[25:33] time to know that we're the ones that
[25:34] hold We're The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat
[25:37] is in the heart of the Bride we're the
[25:39] ones that hold the Divine love if
[25:41] somebody can't find forgiveness they
[25:43] ought to be able to find it within the
[25:45] love of God and the body of
[25:47] Christ that whole mind thing and our
[25:49] thinking um many of you are here today
[25:53] because the love of God moved into your
[25:56] life amen and not just that it moved on
[25:59] you but many of you
[26:02] responded some of you haven't responded
[26:04] yet you know God loves you and you know
[26:06] and you're here and you know it's good
[26:08] to be in church on Sunday mornings but
[26:10] there's so much of this still and I'm
[26:12] going to call it stinking
[26:15] thinking that's what my dad called it
[26:17] stinking
[26:18] thinking and so you have not come where
[26:21] you need to come yet because it's being
[26:23] preached to you the love of God is
[26:25] present you know where it's wanting to
[26:26] take you but you leave this service all
[26:29] the time but interrupted by
[26:31] this you're too scared you won't let go
[26:35] so you're going to walk back into your
[26:36] car and back to your house with the same
[26:38] fears the same Hang-Ups the same scares
[26:40] because you're thinking talk you out of
[26:43] responding to the Lord and becoming
[26:45] broken some people can't even cry and
[26:46] I'm not saying crying is everything but
[26:48] everybody worships there everybody's
[26:49] responds different but some people
[26:51] haven't cried for years except for a cat
[26:53] dying or something like that but but
[26:55] cried because of the conviction of the
[26:57] Holy Spirit I'm cried I'm moved by the
[26:59] Lord and I'm going with it I don't care
[27:01] what happens tomorrow I don't care how
[27:03] embarrassed I am to be at the altar
[27:05] balling my ISS out I don't care anymore
[27:08] I'm going with it that's what we got to
[27:10] do we've got to respond that way we've
[27:13] got to quit letting our mind talk us out
[27:15] of the moving of the love of God we've
[27:19] got to quit let our minds talking out of
[27:21] worshipping God freely we've got to quit
[27:24] quenching the spirit of God when it's
[27:26] trying to move Among Us
[27:31] it's it's but many of you are here today
[27:34] and responded one day in your life to
[27:36] the love of God I say praise the Lord
[27:38] amen thank you you're where you're at
