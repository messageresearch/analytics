[0:00] in the scripture here from Luke chapter
[0:01] 15 you love the Lord this morning a man
[0:06] hopefully I'm not forgetting any of the
[0:07] announcements we have communion or the
[0:09] Lord's Supper this afternoon at 4
[0:12] o'clock is it rather than 4 o'clock so
[0:14] if you want to get a lunch and come back
[0:16] and participate in that I'm sure that
[0:18] would be a blessing to you so we'll come
[0:20] back enjoy that together and then I
[0:22] didn't have a special today but if I get
[0:24] done preaching you will have a special
[0:26] after I'm done preaching I wanted Wesley
[0:27] to sing the song he's saying Monday
[0:29] night there in our watch night service
[0:31] we had Luke chapter 15 and verse 1
[0:34] everybody there everybody here ok don't
[0:40] go home don't worry about what's cooking
[0:42] at home don't worry about what you're
[0:43] gonna do at service everybody needs to
[0:44] be all here oh alright good Luke 15 in
[0:48] verse 1 then drew near unto him all the
[0:52] publicans and sinners to hear him and
[0:56] the Pharisees and scribes murmured
[0:58] saying this man receiveth sinners and
[1:02] eateth with them and he spake this
[1:04] parable unto them saying what man of you
[1:07] having a hundred sheep if he lose one of
[1:09] them does not leave the ninety and nine
[1:12] in the wilderness and go after that
[1:15] which is lost until he find it and
[1:18] that'll be my text today going after
[1:20] that which is lost going after that
[1:23] which is lost until he find it and when
[1:25] he hath found it he layeth it on his
[1:27] shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh
[1:29] home he calleth together his friends and
[1:31] neighbors saying unto them rejoice with
[1:33] me for I have found my sheep which was
[1:36] worst I say unto you that likewise joy
[1:39] shall be in heaven over one sinner that
[1:42] repenteth I want you to notice what
[1:45] makes heaven rejoice it's not the
[1:48] mysteries it's not how much we do for
[1:50] missions can you say man it's when a
[1:53] soul the lost sheep comes and repents
[1:56] that's what makes the Angels rejoice
[1:59] amen so we should be focused we should
[2:02] be focused on what makes heaven rejoice
[2:04] as well we want to be focused on the
[2:07] right thing
[2:07] so I say to you verse 7 that likewise
[2:10] joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
[2:12] that repenteth more than over ninety and
[2:15] nine just persons notice which need no
[2:18] repentance what a shape to be in they
[2:20] don't need repentance anymore either
[2:22] that woman having ten pieces of silver
[2:25] if she lose one piece that not light a
[2:28] candle and sweep the house and seek
[2:31] diligently till she find it and when she
[2:34] has found it she calls her friends and
[2:36] her neighbors together saying rejoice
[2:37] with me for I have found the peace which
[2:40] I had lost likewise I say to you there
[2:43] is joy in the presence of the angels of
[2:46] God over one sinner that repenteth can
[2:50] you say praise the Lord may God bless
[2:52] the reading of his word Heavenly Father
[2:54] we feel your grace and your mercy coming
[2:57] to us this morning the Lord we pray that
[2:59] you'll lead the church by the Holy Ghost
[3:01] Lord we pray we just take these moments
[3:03] now that we have and really listen to
[3:07] the Word of God and what your Holy
[3:09] Spirit is saying to us Lord that we
[3:11] could be guided and receive leadership
[3:13] in these last days and Lord God that we
[3:15] could be an instrument that's more
[3:17] effectively used for your kingdom Lord
[3:19] we could be yielded to you Lord I'm just
[3:22] sharing my heart my vision is you broke
[3:24] these scriptures to me Lord I'm sharing
[3:26] my vision with the church father and
[3:28] it's not about buildings or or anything
[3:30] like that Lord it's about our heart in
[3:32] the earth and what we can do for your
[3:34] kingdom and how we can be available to
[3:37] you lord I just pray that you anoint
[3:39] this and bring it to pass that we'd
[3:40] understand what our position is in this
[3:43] hour according to the scripture we
[3:45] commit the service to you in Jesus name
[3:47] Amen god bless she may be seated I'm
[3:55] just going to read a section of a prayer
[3:58] I don't normally do this but a section
[4:02] of a prayer brother Branham in the
[4:04] message look away to Jesus and he's
[4:07] explaining in there the three poles of
[4:09] Jesus ministry and the three poles in
[4:10] the last day the first pole healing and
[4:13] the Holy Spirit began to work through
[4:15] that first pole was the first pole of
[4:17] healing in the second pole the wave of
[4:19] God
[4:20] using discernment that you could discern
[4:22] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[4:23] but the third pole is what Jesus came to
[4:26] that was beyond the first and second
[4:28] pole beyond the healings and beyond
[4:30] discerning the hearts there was when
[4:32] Jesus sat down and in John chapter 6 and
[4:35] he begin to break the word except to eat
[4:37] my flesh and drink my blood you have no
[4:39] life in you and begin to direct the
[4:41] disciples and all of his followers
[4:43] towards a deeper thing coming and he
[4:45] says my words I speak and you they are
[4:47] spirit in their life in other words the
[4:49] breaking of the word is greater than
[4:51] miracles the breaking of the word in the
[4:53] opening of the word is greater than
[4:56] discerning can you say man we don't
[4:58] eliminate healings or discernment it's
[5:00] part of the body of Christ but we have
[5:03] the opening of the word which comes to
[5:04] the third PO and that transit that those
[5:07] transitions of the three poles happened
[5:09] in the last days as well and so the he
[5:13] looked at the things that we're looking
[5:14] at and the things that we come to the
[5:16] full restoration of the complete truth
[5:18] how many believe the full restoration of
[5:20] the complete truth is here today
[5:22] according to Scripture promising it and
[5:25] bringing it to us we're no longer
[5:27] waiting on that but in this message he
[5:29] expresses what you have seen temporarily
[5:31] will be manifest in the fullness of its
[5:33] power it won't be used in a great way
[5:36] until this council tightens up and he's
[5:38] referring to the World Council churches
[5:39] when there's a blending and them
[5:42] agreeing together to put pressure on the
[5:44] true elect and pressure on the churches
[5:47] who won't join with the Council of
[5:48] Churches and we know we see that in Book
[5:51] of Revelations and all that we
[5:52] understand so he's saying that we won't
[5:55] see this third pole in full
[5:56] manifestation until this catches up and
[5:59] that council tightens up which is
[6:01] happening by the way it's happening it's
[6:03] already in its initial stages and so I
[6:06] want to say to you that we're holding
[6:10] something here but at the end of his
[6:13] sermon he praised this and I think this
[6:15] lays the foundation for the scripture I
[6:18] want to elaborate on he says Lord were
[6:20] at the end time I see the doors will
[6:23] soon be closed and we're 1963 here Lord
[6:27] wrought the endtime now here we are in
[6:28] 2019 beginning the year and
[6:31] in 1963 the doors are closing we're at
[6:36] the end time where are we at in 2019 I
[6:39] see the doors will soon be closed the
[6:42] doors of opportunity and while it is
[6:44] daylight I can still get into some of
[6:46] these places so I want you to notice the
[6:49] doors will be closed and the doors of
[6:51] opportunity will close and while it is
[6:54] daylight and I can still get into some
[6:56] of these places lord help me to go I'm
[6:58] getting old give me strength renew my
[7:00] youth Lord help me that I might do
[7:02] something out there now that I'm waiting
[7:05] for this great time to come that will be
[7:07] here help me Lord as I go out that I
[7:10] might be able under some way to catch
[7:13] that last predestinated seed that will
[7:16] bring back the Lord Jesus help Oh God so
[7:20] you can see his desire and that is our
[7:22] focus his focus was the last elected
[7:25] seed the last child of God the lost
[7:29] sheep that hasn't come in yet it would
[7:31] be easy when you have the opening of the
[7:33] word to focus internally on yourself and
[7:36] say alright we got this now we're
[7:38] holding this and so we close in within
[7:40] ourselves but brother branham's attitude
[7:42] was not that way in his service to the
[7:44] Lord Jesus Christ he said no I want to
[7:47] go out I want to take the last
[7:48] opportunities that I have to find the
[7:51] last one to find the lost sheep praise
[7:56] the Lord that was his desire so his
[7:58] focus was not internally but actually
[8:01] outward even towards the end of his
[8:02] ministry
[8:03] to take opportunities to focus outwardly
[8:06] to see if I can share the word with
[8:09] somebody who's hungry for more the word
[8:12] so his focus was internally excuse me
[8:16] not internally but outward his
[8:17] revelation of what he had and who he was
[8:20] did not produce a closed door us for and
[8:25] no more an attitude that we have a truth
[8:30] and and that type of attitude us for no
[8:34] more and we will just close in here and
[8:37] wait for what needs to be manifest we'll
[8:40] just wait for it to be manifest and we
[8:42] have something
[8:43] but we're gonna close in and just wait
[8:45] for he's not got that attitude he's
[8:47] saying we have something here but we
[8:49] have opportunities and he's focused on
[8:51] the last ones to come in I want to let
[8:54] all you know here this morning is that
[8:56] we're not getting out of here so the
[8:58] last sheep comes in we're not leaving
[9:02] this place in a rapture until the last
[9:03] one comes in and whether that's sitting
[9:06] among us or out there it doesn't matter
[9:08] we have to be focused on it and the
[9:10] reason I believe is I break it down the
[9:12] reason Jesus is addressing this is
[9:14] because we in are what we haven't been
[9:18] blessed with sometimes can become so
[9:20] internalized and so self focused that we
[9:25] lose the vision of the lost sheep
[9:29] everybody on board and this is what
[9:33] Jesus is dressing and I'm gonna break it
[9:35] down because I believe it would be if
[9:38] there is any attitudes that are
[9:39] internally into needed correction I
[9:41] believe this would correct it so we see
[9:44] in Luke 15 if you want to read the
[9:46] chapter this week I'm gonna dwell in
[9:48] this chapter 15 quite a bit and I'm
[9:51] actually headed towards the last part of
[9:54] 15 it's three parables and the last one
[9:57] is the parable of the prodigal son and
[9:59] at the retreat this year the Lord just
[10:01] opens something to me that was so
[10:03] actually personally a personal rebuke to
[10:06] me and I want to share a lot of that but
[10:08] I want to share what the Lord opened
[10:10] that we read over this parable we don't
[10:12] catch sometimes all that's laying in it
[10:13] of the prodigal son coming back and our
[10:16] attitude towards the prodigal son coming
[10:18] back but but I want you to notice all
[10:21] the parables and everything that's said
[10:23] in Luke chapter 15 they have a theme to
[10:26] it and it's ministered to me recently to
[10:30] read this in my devotion and be able to
[10:32] read over and over again in chapter 3
[10:35] it's three parables and they are
[10:36] revealing the attitude that we take
[10:39] towards the loss that's what they're
[10:40] revealing the attitude that we take
[10:42] towards the loss and and we have to
[10:45] realize that we need to focus on
[10:48] something that the incompletion of
[10:50] missing sheep the ones that are lost
[10:53] still lost or the missing
[10:55] coin in the case of the parable of the
[10:57] missing coin that this woman and notice
[11:00] now you've got a man in the first
[11:01] parable but you got a woman in the
[11:02] second borough woman is the type of the
[11:04] bride can you say mine and she's got
[11:08] over 10 coins she's but then she has
[11:11] nine and ones ones missing and her
[11:14] thrust and her attention and her burden
[11:17] is not satisfied to say well I've got
[11:22] nine and I'm good to go
[11:24] she becomes almost obsessed with
[11:26] sweeping the house so she finds the last
[11:31] coin how easy it would be to say I've
[11:35] got nine I'm good to go
[11:37] that's everything I need if I missing
[11:39] this and focus completely on being
[11:41] settled I don't want to take the work I
[11:43] don't want to make the sacrifice to try
[11:45] to find the last one no it's not that at
[11:47] all I'm not happy with just the nine I'm
[11:49] not happy with just what these sheep
[11:51] that are here already
[11:52] they've already they're already in can
[11:54] you say man but the focus has to be on
[11:57] what's lost can I get an amen so so it's
[12:02] amazing so we have that something is
[12:04] incomplete and these are the people that
[12:06] notice that something's incomplete
[12:08] they're not satisfied with just the
[12:10] numbers that they had there's still not
[12:12] a complete group until the lost sheep is
[12:14] in I want to tell you you're not
[12:17] complete until all the bride is in
[12:21] you're not going in a rapture till all
[12:24] the bride is in we're not complete say
[12:27] well we got the word we're complete we
[12:29] got the complete word that the foal of
[12:31] what Paul spoke of in first Corinthians
[12:33] they are speaking of that which is
[12:35] perfect is come then that which his part
[12:37] is done away perfect interpretation by
[12:39] the perfect restored Word of God brings
[12:42] it to perfection not us not our
[12:43] interpretation but God blesses in the
[12:45] last days with about ten scriptures I'm
[12:47] thinking of of a restoration of truths
[12:50] that were lost for 2,000 years of church
[12:52] history he said in the last days I'll
[12:54] restore I'll restore all those truths
[12:58] I'll restore what happened in the garden
[13:00] you'll know what happened the garden
[13:01] I'll restore the Godhead you understand
[13:03] whether it's one God or three gods I'll
[13:06] restore the
[13:07] truth of predestination it's all been
[13:09] laying there but he says I got to
[13:10] restore it and bring it back to my
[13:12] people again because churches have
[13:14] messed with those truths and got rid of
[13:16] those truths and tore pages out of the
[13:18] Bible but in the last days I'll restore
[13:21] truth to my people we're living in that
[13:23] day but we could say well I'm complete
[13:25] we have the word we have the truth these
[13:27] people who are not complete until the
[13:29] last ones come in I want you to look at
[13:33] that look at it just that way that we're
[13:36] not complete and this comfortableness to
[13:39] come to church and say man it's good to
[13:41] see my friends here I'm happy to see my
[13:43] friends sitting next to me it's good to
[13:45] have you all here we're all sons and
[13:48] daughters of God praise the Lord enjoyed
[13:49] the music enjoyed the musicians head
[13:51] back home to your jobs
[13:52] I think our burden needs to go deeper
[13:54] than that I think it shouldn't be asked
[13:59] for no more I think we need a vision to
[14:04] say lord help me find the lost sheep
[14:12] so as we start in the first two verses
[14:15] if you want to look at him again in the
[14:16] first verse I could preach all afternoon
[14:20] on just the first verse that says then
[14:23] drew near unto him the son of man Christ
[14:27] who drew near to him publicans and
[14:31] sinners were attracted to him now
[14:37] friends that to me it doesn't seem
[14:41] normal in our eyes that our Lord Jesus
[14:44] our Lord Jesus when he was around here
[14:47] in this fleshly body of two thousand
[14:49] years ago that there was actually a
[14:51] comfortableness of sinners and publicans
[14:54] to want to be around him it doesn't say
[14:57] their Savior if I have to stay an hour
[15:02] just on first one I'll do it I'm gonna
[15:03] take more time continue this next next
[15:06] time this there's something wrong with
[15:10] this picture because when I view this
[15:11] and when I view some message ranks and
[15:13] some churches the same Jesus that we're
[15:17] claiming to serve the same Jesus that's
[15:19] here in the Bible's were claimed living
[15:21] in us and I'm here to tell you the
[15:23] sinners and the publicans comfortable to
[15:27] be around it it doesn't say they're
[15:28] saved yet but there was some manner that
[15:31] Jesus was that they wanted to hear him I
[15:35] can think of some message atmospheres
[15:38] and message situations that sinners and
[15:41] publicans don't feel welcomed at all
[15:43] they don't feel comfortable at all can
[15:47] you say man but I'm gonna say the same
[15:49] Lord Jesus we claim to serve the sinners
[15:51] and publicans were drawing near to him
[15:54] not even saved yet but there was must
[15:58] have been some manner there must have
[16:00] been something about him that there's a
[16:02] supernatural drawing that they wanted to
[16:05] sit down with him and be with him and
[16:07] they just wanted to hear they weren't
[16:09] even saved yet but I like being around
[16:11] this guy and there's something of it
[16:12] there was an attraction going on even
[16:15] before they were saved
[16:18] if we claim to have the same Jesus then
[16:21] I pray let that same manner be at us
[16:23] [Music]
[16:25] that people would like to be around like
[16:27] to talk to me that I have something of
[16:30] life within me that they're feeling
[16:32] attracted to
[16:33] they've been attracted to the world for
[16:35] years they've been attracted to
[16:37] Hollywood there if they're a hungry
[16:39] heart they're tired of all that but when
[16:41] they pick up on something different
[16:42] within you the Christ in you they want
[16:46] to be around you same Jesus that we
[16:51] claim to have in our we should see the
[16:52] same results everybody understand see
[16:57] it's not that message it's it's the
[16:58] Christ of the message that attracts a
[17:01] hungry heart
[17:02] it's the Christ of the message that
[17:04] attracts the hungry heart our people
[17:07] that attracted to you or do you turn
[17:09] people off I'm gonna be asked them some
[17:12] questions like that in the service today
[17:13] won't be very long but I'm gonna be
[17:15] asking some jolting questions is the
[17:18] sinner and the publican attracted to the
[17:21] Christ in you I'm not talking about your
[17:25] personality people like me yeah I'm good
[17:28] time I laugh that's great no no I'm not
[17:31] talking about you I talk about the
[17:32] Christ that's in you being drawn to it
[17:36] being there there's something there's a
[17:38] drawing so it's amazing to see sinners
[17:40] and publicans coming around that my Lord
[17:43] had something that attracted them to him
[17:45] he didn't repel them they didn't feel
[17:47] repelled this is not normal for sinners
[17:50] to to me it's not normal for sinners to
[17:53] want to be around Christ and and and we
[17:56] think that they stay we think that the
[18:00] center stays as far away from what we
[18:01] believe and who we are the center stays
[18:04] as far away as they can but that's not
[18:06] what the scripture says here and and we
[18:10] write people off they'll never they'll
[18:15] never come to what I believe they'll
[18:16] never come to some of the things in we
[18:19] stand for some of the ways that we dress
[18:21] and some of the I'm not talking about
[18:23] the ways we dress
[18:24] it's a secondary thing do you have the
[18:28] life of Christ but we think they're
[18:33] never gonna and you ride them off before
[18:35] before anything I'm over here and I
[18:38] believe this and this is unattractive to
[18:40] the world we know that we're oddballs
[18:41] the Prophet preached that we're oddballs
[18:43] all that's there so I'm gonna so you
[18:45] stay over here at oddball and they'll
[18:46] never then they don't never receive it
[18:48] you don't have a right to write them off
[18:50] like that and I'm reading a scripture to
[18:52] say the same Christ of the message the
[18:54] same Christ living us the same Christ
[18:56] that lived 2,000 years ago and the
[18:57] sinners and publicans like to be around
[18:59] him is that okay
[19:06] amen kind of quiet today but that's
[19:10] alright I'm determined I got it all I
[19:12] got what the Lord gave me to preach you
[19:16] claim to have the same Jesus in you I
[19:17] have a question our sinners drawn to the
[19:19] Jesus in you or are they not drawn to it
[19:21] or do you have to do you give off such
[19:24] an air about yourself that they don't
[19:26] want to be in your presence at all there
[19:30] was a manner about Christ that made them
[19:33] feel comfortable enough to be around him
[19:35] his approach to them his way with him
[19:38] something must have been attractive and
[19:40] I don't believe Jesus compromised
[19:42] I believe when the time came to tell
[19:43] truth I believe Jesus spoke truth I
[19:45] don't believe it's a compromiser by
[19:48] hanging around these sinners in public I
[19:49] don't believe he was compromised or not
[19:51] how many would believe Christ was
[19:52] compromised he never compromised but I'm
[19:54] here to tell you with all he was truth
[19:56] he was the very embodiment of truth he
[19:59] knew all things and yet knowing all
[20:02] things and knowing all truth his manner
[20:04] in his way attracted the center tracted
[20:09] the publican it's amazing friends and so
[20:12] they come and hear him and so this was
[20:14] the manner they want to come here and
[20:15] not they weren't a saint yet but they
[20:17] were drawn to come around then there's a
[20:19] reaction in verse 2 from the Pharisees
[20:21] and scribes murmuring then saying this
[20:23] man receiveth sinners and eateth with
[20:26] him so now you have the other side of
[20:29] all the public all the the religious
[20:32] people we call the Pharisees and scribes
[20:34] they're supposed to know all these
[20:35] things they know it but but they
[20:37] criticize
[20:38] Jesus and they they said he's eating
[20:40] with sinners and he receiveth them well
[20:44] that was a lie that was a lie
[20:47] because he didn't go to them they came
[20:51] to him
[20:52] so the first sees are already telling a
[20:54] lie on Jesus because they're critical
[20:57] they'd understand they don't have Christ
[20:59] in their hearts themselves can you say
[21:01] man so got a murmur and complain I can't
[21:04] believe that he's invited those people
[21:06] to come and eat with him or he's going
[21:09] out to them he didn't go out to them he
[21:11] didn't even invite them necessary but he
[21:14] has such an attraction to him they
[21:15] wanted to be with him so their
[21:18] accusation is a lie and and that's true
[21:21] to scripture because there is a
[21:22] scripture in Hebrews I believe it says
[21:23] Jesus was separate from sinners Jesus in
[21:26] a lot of times the church world uses
[21:28] that we need to go out there we need to
[21:30] be in the bars we need to have rock and
[21:32] roll in the church we needed this we can
[21:33] attract the center Jesus never had to do
[21:36] that the church world has bought into
[21:39] all these modern ideas is that we made
[21:41] make us look like the front of the world
[21:43] to attract sinners the sinners are tired
[21:45] of the world and on a supernatural God
[21:48] they want a reality let me see the
[21:50] reality of Christ let me see it live not
[21:53] by religion let me see somebody to dress
[21:55] modestly but because it's in their heart
[21:58] because Christ lives in their heart see
[22:02] we get off track and our thinking don't
[22:04] we we get off track so many times that
[22:06] our thinking and these were critical of
[22:09] them being around but Jesus wasn't going
[22:11] out to them necessarily although we're
[22:13] preaching on the fact that we need to go
[22:15] find the lost sheep he was finding the
[22:16] lost sheep because he was creating an
[22:18] atmosphere that they could feel
[22:20] comfortable to come and be saved and
[22:22] come and repent and so now we see him
[22:24] the reaction they're blaming him for
[22:26] being with them it was a lie he didn't
[22:28] go be with him they came to him the
[22:30] Bible says Jesus was separate from
[22:31] sinners Bible says Jesus was separate
[22:33] from sinners so he didn't go on their
[22:35] territory oh you ever heard of the
[22:37] you're heard of a mission dating he ever
[22:39] heard missionary dating nobody's ever
[22:41] heard of that
[22:43] I'm gonna go date this person in the
[22:45] world because I'm gonna get him saved
[22:46] it's called missionary dating
[22:49] yeah I'm gonna go to their parties they
[22:52] invited me to because I can be a witness
[22:54] to them can't be a witness at a party
[22:56] they're drinking and everything you went
[22:58] on their territory
[22:59] the Prophet taught us and the scripture
[23:02] now teaches and it's not necessarily us
[23:04] going on their territory but it's just
[23:06] us having such an attraction to invite
[23:08] them into our world in our territory
[23:11] that they feel comfortable enough to let
[23:13] the Holy Spirit deal with their hearts
[23:16] it's not you saving them it's the Holy
[23:18] Spirit but you got to get them in the
[23:20] right atmosphere they gotta feel loved
[23:23] can you say man and we don't love them
[23:25] by giving them more rock and roll we
[23:28] don't love them by giving them more
[23:29] things of the world and making our
[23:31] church look like a community center
[23:33] instead of a real church we don't
[23:35] compromise those things we should have
[23:38] the goods that attract a sinner to us
[23:41] without compromising the way Jesus did
[23:45] it anybody on board here this morning I
[23:47] can't get enough amens for this I think
[23:49] this is good I think we need this
[23:51] teaching especially in the message of
[23:53] the hour because we're not above growing
[23:57] into pride to say I internally look and
[23:59] keep my mind and all the message
[24:01] movement and all that's going on
[24:02] internally and completely lose our
[24:05] vision for the lost sheep and lose our
[24:07] vision for the center can you say me
[24:10] we're - that means I'm going ahead and
[24:12] say it we're you wouldn't believe how -
[24:14] we're too focused still on ourselves if
[24:20] you way your life today and you don't
[24:21] get anything else of this I ask you to
[24:23] go home and pray say Lord show me in my
[24:26] life if I'm so focused in any way
[24:29] because I'd say when we get to praying
[24:31] we're more self focused than what we
[24:33] realize we're not here for ourselves
[24:35] we're here for others we're here for
[24:39] others right down to every penny you
[24:43] make it your job brothers you better
[24:46] pray and say Lord I want to feed my
[24:48] family I thank you Lord for this job but
[24:52] Lord what can I accomplish for the
[24:54] kingdom of God in my children in my
[24:56] church and in my life this money belongs
[24:59] to you
[25:01] this salary belongs to you this home
[25:04] that you gave me belongs to you it's not
[25:06] mine I'm just a steward over it God can
[25:08] take it away from me just like that we
[25:11] must live with the priority that
[25:13] everything that's given to me must be
[25:15] used in some way to accomplish something
[25:18] for the Lost sinners everything must be
[25:24] gone to come through that filter can you
[25:26] see or elsewhere just like the world so
[25:29] they react to him and I'm gonna get past
[25:30] that now he was separate from sinners
[25:32] but he didn't get on their eternity they
[25:33] came to him but they felt comfortable
[25:35] around him I want to emphasize that
[25:36] point yet so now he was going to correct
[25:39] a group that had become so isolated
[25:41] Pharisees and Sadducees everybody still
[25:43] listening I'm gonna be brief here today
[25:44] I'm gonna try to be brief he was going
[25:46] to correct a group that had become not
[25:48] they they murmured doesn't say they told
[25:51] him openly didn't say hey Jesus you're
[25:54] saying no they murmured but he hears
[25:56] everything and because they murmured and
[25:59] criticized him he's going to give three
[26:01] parables to correct their attitude that
[26:03] had become so isolated to themselves
[26:06] we're the only ones that's right we are
[26:08] satisfied with ourselves can you say man
[26:10] and closing in with him selves they had
[26:12] become so isolated and comfortable in
[26:15] their own world and how it functioned
[26:17] that they had no vision for an
[26:20] atmosphere of place to invite or to have
[26:23] sinners come they did not have the
[26:28] drawing power or even a desire for
[26:31] someone else besides themselves now
[26:36] Jesus does refer to the Pharisees one
[26:38] place and rebukes them that they would
[26:41] encompass land and sea to make one
[26:43] proselyte and they wouldn't even
[26:46] proselyte the sadly the Sadducees to
[26:48] become a Pharisee because there's
[26:50] different groups you know a lot of a lot
[26:54] of the church growth is kind of people
[26:56] going from church to church come on can
[26:58] you say man and proselyting people to
[27:01] come and make a change over to the
[27:03] Presbyterian Church over here it change
[27:05] your membership over here and do this
[27:06] that and so this is what the Pharisees
[27:08] did is that it's it's proselyting it's
[27:11] it's trying and I want you to know what
[27:12] that word means because that's what the
[27:14] Pharisees did
[27:14] and it means a prospect means a person
[27:16] who has converted to one opinion or to a
[27:19] party or like a Democrat becomes a
[27:21] Republican Republican because they never
[27:23] got there's no supernatural God in that
[27:25] for - for repentance
[27:26] that's just changing your opinion that's
[27:29] what religion has become change your
[27:31] membership over here change your opinion
[27:33] okay I believe in God that's that's fine
[27:35] and so now I want to say it again they
[27:38] did not have the drawing power and so a
[27:40] process is a person that is converted to
[27:42] one opinion party or religion to another
[27:44] they were about numbers more than true
[27:48] repentance they were about changing
[27:53] people's opinions than they were about
[27:56] true repentance that's not what the
[28:00] sinners need and that's not what the
[28:02] sinners are looking for the world of
[28:05] religious Jews and sinners was so
[28:08] divided it had no place or regard for
[28:12] the loss I'm saying the world of the
[28:13] sinner and the world of the Pharisees
[28:15] and Jews was so divided there was no
[28:18] attraction to draw them in and they
[28:21] created that world they created
[28:23] unapproachable have we done that are we
[28:32] comfortable with our own world so much
[28:34] that we've lost a little bit about
[28:37] thinking Lord what what can you put in
[28:41] me to draw someone who has not been
[28:43] blessed to hear the truth yet maybe a
[28:48] different message for you this morning
[28:50] different what you expect I want to say
[28:54] over time even a move of God can become
[28:59] closed and exclusive and people can
[29:03] become proud and isolated in their own
[29:06] comfort zone we know denominations can
[29:11] come that way because we see the
[29:13] Pharisees into it we know they can
[29:14] become that way but I'm going to tell
[29:15] you that even a true move of God Luther
[29:18] Wesley can turn into domination ilysm
[29:22] and become isolated that they lose the
[29:25] main focus
[29:26] even a move can God of God can
[29:29] eventually become closed exclusive and
[29:32] people become proud and isolated in
[29:34] their own comfort zone and completely
[29:37] forget why we have this Christ within us
[29:39] they forget why the message has came the
[29:42] messages come to us to have life within
[29:44] us and to impart eternal life for
[29:47] brother Boaz mentioned this in the youth
[29:49] meeting Friday night is that brother
[29:50] brems says that the purpose of the Holy
[29:53] Ghost the purpose and God giving you the
[29:56] Holy Ghost is to impart eternal life to
[29:59] someone else what is the Holy Ghost
[30:05] given for well it's to change you it's
[30:08] to convert you of course but that's not
[30:10] the end of it it's to impart that we
[30:12] could actually impart eternal life to
[30:15] someone else and in the message we
[30:17] forget what the purpose is we forget
[30:19] what the that it's to have life the
[30:21] message is Christ and it's to have life
[30:23] within us to impart eternal life that's
[30:25] what the Holy Ghost was given for but
[30:27] over time a message Steven from God sent
[30:30] by a prophet can produce fanaticism an
[30:32] exclusive and an exclusive monopoly on
[30:35] truth can you say Amen I don't believe
[30:39] we need to present things that way I
[30:40] don't need to present the attitude that
[30:42] we have on the monopoly on truth because
[30:45] truth God you cannot put God in a box
[30:48] that God cannot reveal himself to
[30:51] somebody even if they're not in your
[30:53] ranks I believe that the truth is in the
[30:57] light of the hour I believe his blood is
[30:58] in the life because the scripture says
[31:00] that he if you walk in the light as he
[31:02] is in the light then you have fellowship
[31:04] with one another and the blood cleanses
[31:06] you from all sin can you say man so the
[31:08] benefits to the blood is walking in the
[31:10] light if you're walking in darkness can
[31:12] you say man and you won't walk in light
[31:14] you're gonna lose the effects of the
[31:15] blood of Jesus Christ that's what the
[31:16] scripture says I believe all that but I
[31:19] think it is wrong to present this
[31:21] message as an exclusive thing that God
[31:23] can't deal with someone else besides the
[31:25] ranks of the message I think that's
[31:27] wrong to present it that way I know a
[31:29] lot of preachers are disagree with me
[31:31] that's fine III just preach into my own
[31:33] congregation here I think that even a
[31:36] god-sent prophet can eventually
[31:38] the move of God can turn to fanaticism
[31:41] and an exclusive monopoly on truth and
[31:46] then become a thing you have to do
[31:49] certain things to gain acceptance into
[31:51] that group but not repentance and the
[31:55] only thing I see there for sinners is a
[31:58] requirement first is true repentance can
[32:01] I get an amen the nominations that no no
[32:04] yes you got to ten steps to go through
[32:06] and you're gonna have to correct this
[32:08] you're going to get your dress right
[32:09] you're gonna have to do this right and
[32:10] you're gonna have to do this and you get
[32:12] off those cigarettes and you could you
[32:14] who we got all these steps to go through
[32:15] you better get rid of all out because
[32:17] the scripture just said the center of
[32:18] the first thing he needs and heaven
[32:21] rejoices when he truly repents heavens
[32:25] already rejoicing oh my somebody better
[32:30] get into this now I'm giving you the
[32:32] scripture now we're not rejoicing until
[32:36] they dress right we're not dressed
[32:40] we're not rejoicing and having a good
[32:41] time until we go ahead feel like they've
[32:43] conformed away though the way we look
[32:45] that's not what the scripture says our
[32:48] heart and prayer is to bring them to
[32:50] true repentance
[32:51] that's first can you say amen let the
[32:54] holy spirit come with this power and
[32:56] move that heart to true repentance and
[32:59] if it's true repentance you don't have
[33:01] to worry about all the rest God will
[33:03] bring that Saint on to the fullness of
[33:04] himself the first thing I notice in
[33:09] these scriptures is that heaven rejoice
[33:11] oh not just a sinner because he that
[33:13] would be more of a Baptist presentation
[33:15] look for sinners go for the center get
[33:17] the sinner no no no it's the one that
[33:19] truly repents it's more about repentance
[33:21] than it is the sinner
[33:25] we're praying for an atmosphere that God
[33:29] can move that heart to true repentance
[33:31] and if it's true repentance I'm telling
[33:34] you the power of God is gonna change
[33:36] that life
[33:37] you don't make them from a sinner to a
[33:39] saint you don't have to do it so I'm
[33:43] encourage you on training you this
[33:44] morning what should we be praying for
[33:46] with all the truth we have we should be
[33:48] praying that we create a right after I
[33:49] told my leadership here's my goal for
[33:51] the year in the coming years is that I
[33:53] want to present the best presentation
[33:55] and atmosphere of what this message is
[33:57] in our whole church I want to get us to
[34:01] work towards creating the best
[34:03] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and the
[34:05] best representation of this message how
[34:08] many will join me
[34:09] so souls can be changed they can walk
[34:13] here and here in here to feel the
[34:14] presence of God can you say man
[34:17] God will clean them up God will do the
[34:19] work you catch them God will clean them
[34:23] like fish can you say man aren't you
[34:27] glad you don't have to do the cleanup
[34:29] but we all should be praying every
[34:32] service we get together and every day
[34:34] when we go out into this word God how
[34:36] can you just let there be a radiance
[34:39] come from my life let there be an
[34:41] attraction come from me Lord when I walk
[34:44] into my job when I walk into my school
[34:46] Oh Lord let me be so in tune with you
[34:48] doing my work but somebody is attracted
[34:51] to the presence that I'm bringing when
[34:53] we meet together in this place you just
[34:55] stagger in here and you just barely made
[34:57] it no lady you ought to come a little
[34:59] early you ought to pray you ought to
[35:00] pray on the way to church you ought to
[35:01] sing some songs in your car with your
[35:03] children don't talk about your problems
[35:05] and all that sing some songs create an
[35:07] atmosphere with your children till the
[35:10] time we get here we're ready to create
[35:12] an atmosphere that when people begin to
[35:16] come through these doors you don't have
[35:18] to say very much what's not being said
[35:21] is speaking to their heart already
[35:24] would you join me with that because it
[35:27] might be unless selected seed would be
[35:28] right here among us that hasn't repented
[35:30] yet I talked about going out there and
[35:33] finding the last exit might be among us
[35:34] right here one of these young people one
[35:38] of these children one of these old
[35:39] people they haven't truly repented yet
[35:41] that's what this is about you know
[35:42] you're still a center even coming here
[35:44] if you haven't truly repented yet you
[35:47] still I love you but unless you have
[35:51] truly come to a true repentance in your
[35:53] heart you're still a sinner but I'm in
[35:56] the message it doesn't matter
[35:57] you're still a sinner unless you've
[35:58] truly repented before God it's about
[36:02] repentance that they rejoiced over right
[36:04] there was that's when the Angels rejoice
[36:07] you know they they didn't they don't
[36:10] strike up the band with any old occasion
[36:12] at hand there's a song about it
[36:16] and I'm trying to remember the words and
[36:18] I'm having a senior moment and I'm only
[36:22] 52 heaven doesn't strike up the band
[36:27] with any old occasion and had to be a
[36:29] special thing to make the angels sing
[36:33] but when a sinner makes the lordís
[36:35] choice that's when the Angels rejoice we
[36:39] can't see him but when the center
[36:40] somebody truly repents
[36:42] there's rejoicing going on in heaven so
[36:44] I'm asking you change your focus that's
[36:46] what we begin to rejoice not if we get
[36:48] over all the dress right or I don't get
[36:49] everything let God take care of that but
[36:51] when someone is so broken sometimes
[36:53] they're moved to tears but we know that
[36:55] there's been a true genuine of
[36:57] repentance of the heart God I'm ready to
[36:59] give it all to you we should be
[37:01] rejoicing over that somebody say praise
[37:05] the Lord
[37:06] that's the direction that's the vision
[37:08] that this pastor has for this church I
[37:10] don't want to be a message status quo
[37:13] Church I'm not concerned with what's
[37:15] going on out there I don't really care
[37:17] I'll pray for people but I'm not
[37:19] concerned with fashioning our church
[37:21] after what they're doing out there let
[37:23] them do what they do can you say man but
[37:26] we've got to get to the right atmosphere
[37:27] for the lost sheep can you say mine we
[37:31] got to find the last predestinated see
[37:33] it's not all about preaching the
[37:35] mysteries that's seeing the mystery come
[37:37] and draw people to Christ I'm gonna
[37:41] continue to preach the mysteries of God
[37:43] here we're blessed with the mysteries
[37:45] being unfolded according to revelations
[37:46] 10 7 we're blessed with the mystery of
[37:49] God being revealed in the last days
[37:50] we're blessed I'm going to continue to
[37:52] preach it and I'm going to continue to
[37:53] preach about Bible modesty and all that
[37:55] but listen now that's not the emphasis
[37:57] as much as creating an atmosphere that
[38:00] if I speak for 20 minutes which I won't
[38:02] be today by the way if I speak for 20
[38:04] minutes or an hour and a half I've
[38:07] created the atmosphere and you have to
[38:08] for repentance to take place somebody
[38:13] say praise the Lord
[38:14] over time the message even from a
[38:17] god-sent prophet can produce fanaticism
[38:18] and if you're listening and watching
[38:21] I'll tell you there's a lot of
[38:22] fanaticism that's taking place
[38:25] there's cultish cultish things that are
[38:30] getting worse we bear the blunt and the
[38:33] the reproach of that unfortunately under
[38:35] the same message name I was looking up
[38:40] the meeting to a cult the cult
[38:42] there's many definitions but one dick
[38:44] Shea said a relatively small group of
[38:46] people having religious beliefs that are
[38:47] considered strange or sinister by others
[38:49] and I thought this was just interesting
[38:51] in and a cult is a misplaced or
[38:54] excessive admiration for a person or a
[38:57] thing and notice it says now a misplaced
[39:03] or excessive admiration for a person we
[39:08] have that going on
[39:10] we have idolatry going on say well it
[39:13] was that just today no it happened in
[39:16] Daniels day Daniel was a true prophet of
[39:18] God I believe in true prophets of God I
[39:21] believe they bring the Word of God
[39:23] Daniel Nebuchadnezzar built an image and
[39:25] that image was unto Daniel Shadrach
[39:28] Meshach Abednego says listen gun I ain't
[39:29] bowing down to my friend and my brother
[39:31] Daniel he's a prophet he's God's prophet
[39:34] for the hour but I'm not bound and
[39:35] worship to him this has happened before
[39:39] fanaticism to follow a true man of God
[39:42] and we're having it happen so much in
[39:45] this message idolatry
[39:47] I don't follow William Branham I
[39:50] followed the God of William Branham the
[39:54] truth had been stored through his office
[39:56] in his place of Malachi for revelations
[39:58] since seven scripture being fulfilled
[40:00] you'll never get me to deny that because
[40:02] somebody had to fulfill those things he
[40:04] said well what if it's a lot of
[40:05] preachers well it wasn't in John the
[40:07] Baptist day because his Elijah was
[40:08] spirit was on John the Baptist it wasn't
[40:10] on ten people it was on one man John
[40:12] there was a man sent from God whose name
[40:14] was John
[40:15] and he had the spirit of Elijah upon him
[40:18] one man now today it's not about one man
[40:21] it's about the bride of Jesus Christ but
[40:24] it starts with one man see it's a secret
[40:27] in the scripture that many churches
[40:29] ignore but you can't get around it
[40:32] it's Isaiah it's Moses it's bang bang
[40:35] bang bang it's Paul
[40:38] Paul in the New Testament there's no
[40:40] prophets than to pose a prophet
[40:44] Paul was Paul was had a special ministry
[40:47] besides the other ministers there he
[40:49] didn't make himself that but we got 14
[40:52] books of his writings in the New
[40:54] Testament we got Peter and James and
[40:57] they're all men of God all used by the
[41:00] Holy Ghost Paul why does he get 14 books
[41:03] in the New Testament he said the word
[41:06] that I received from the Lord if a man
[41:08] comes preaching something let him be
[41:10] accursed
[41:10] if an angel come preaching something
[41:12] letting be a curse let him in know he
[41:14] says if I come back and say something
[41:16] different than what's been brought I'd
[41:18] be a cursed
[41:19] that's how much he believed it was the
[41:21] office it was the place he is a man no
[41:24] confidence in the man no confidence in
[41:27] the man no because he's flesh like we
[41:30] are he's a human being like we are oh if
[41:33] I preach that in some message ranks here
[41:35] this morning I'd be blackballed probably
[41:37] my life threatened but I don't deify a
[41:41] man that was born in sin shaped and
[41:44] iniquity
[41:44] I don't deify a prophet I take what God
[41:50] spoke through thus saith the Lord from
[41:52] God I say thank God take it in my heart
[41:56] may it bring me to Christ in my life you
[41:59] understand now with the deepest respect
[42:02] for God's man for the hour God uses that
[42:05] can you say men so much more that I
[42:08] could say on that but I don't want to be
[42:10] airing I don't want to stay negative so
[42:14] many things that I feel I could correct
[42:16] going on in around the world well it's
[42:20] not my job necessarily don't want to be
[42:23] too negative what I want to train our
[42:27] group of people here and whoever God
[42:29] puts it is that our focus is the last
[42:33] elected seed our focus is it to preach
[42:39] the mysteries every service so
[42:40] everybody's dazzled by what I preach I
[42:45] don't preach any more so I can dazzle
[42:47] the other preachers in the message and
[42:50] say this is the only place that's
[42:52] bringing it this way boy this is you got
[42:53] to come here because this is dazzling oh
[42:55] this is well this is deep it's not my
[43:00] desire anymore but this is the focus
[43:04] here the last days prayer the even
[43:06] brother Branham saying Lord we have this
[43:08] now the third poll has been revealed we
[43:10] see it vindicated we have this what's
[43:12] his desire Lord let me take every
[43:14] opportunity that I can to find the last
[43:19] elected
[43:20] it's not focused internally let's focus
[43:23] Lord how can we find I can we find my
[43:28] children bring him back to the Lord
[43:31] the prodigal sons are coming back the
[43:41] attitudes become so so focused I got to
[43:43] get off this but addict who's become so
[43:45] self okis sometimes even in the message
[43:47] that there's no room left for the sinner
[43:49] to come he's saying leave your comfort
[43:52] zone and self focused mind and go after
[43:55] the lost one no matter how good we have
[43:56] it we're all still incomplete with the
[43:58] loss without the lost ones coming when
[44:01] we're satisfied with just our circle and
[44:03] what it is even if it's the circle of
[44:05] our family because families will do this
[44:08] we're focused just on our family
[44:10] strengthen your family in the Lord but
[44:12] you can't be focused only on your family
[44:15] if your focus on your family and no
[44:17] thoughts of the lost ones we're becoming
[44:19] a Pharisee even in the message grab that
[44:26] back I should have said that it came out
[44:30] probably getting trouble for it but
[44:33] since I'm not worried about that let me
[44:36] say it again if we're focused on our own
[44:43] circle and just our own family and no
[44:45] thoughts are the lost ones we're
[44:46] becoming a Pharisee even in the message
[44:51] makes some people uncomfortable have
[44:53] someone in the church for a service that
[44:55] doesn't look like them are they in the
[44:58] message are they in the message where
[45:03] did that phrase come from where did that
[45:08] phrase come from that we're starting to
[45:12] judge people whether they're in the
[45:14] movement of the message or whether
[45:15] they're not and by doing that we make it
[45:18] a movement that it's just as long as
[45:21] they're in the movement and coming to a
[45:24] message church that's good enough I'm
[45:28] here to tell you that's a lie
[45:31] because this message isn't about to
[45:33] start of denomination or a movement this
[45:36] message was to bring us back to Bible
[45:38] faith Bible restored truth and that we
[45:43] have the life of the resurrection power
[45:45] living within us that souls can be
[45:48] transformed and changed I just gave you
[45:51] the whole summary of why God sent the
[45:52] last day's message can you say man but
[45:55] what are they in the message and I think
[45:58] in the words that come from you see it
[46:00] comes from developing something it's a
[46:03] replacement for the real thing we should
[46:07] be asking are they saved are they filled
[46:10] with the Holy Ghost can you say man
[46:13] and I'm gonna pray are they saved are
[46:15] they filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm
[46:18] gonna keep praying if they don't I'm
[46:19] gonna pray for them cuz that's what they
[46:20] need they need true repentance see war
[46:24] about all the message I'll tell you they
[46:26] get the Holy Ghost they won't have a
[46:28] problem receiving all truth that God is
[46:30] brother cuz there's only one spirit that
[46:33] can live the word and that's the one who
[46:35] wrote the book and that's the author and
[46:37] if you have the altar then the author
[46:39] you can live the book can you say man
[46:42] praise the Lord
[46:43] there's only one spirit that can live in
[46:44] us the Spirit of Christ and the first
[46:46] thing people need is the genuine spirit
[46:49] of Christ repentance baptism can you say
[46:52] man to be saved to be filled with
[46:54] Christ's life if not if they don't have
[46:57] it I'm gonna pray and I'm gonna love
[46:59] them right into it I'll jump to my
[47:03] subject real quick of that prodigal God
[47:06] changed his heart and he headed back to
[47:09] the Father but he felt so unworthy to
[47:12] come back and the Bible says before he
[47:19] was back to the Father he felt hesitant
[47:20] the father ran towards him because the
[47:26] father discerned his heart had already
[47:28] changed maybe you couldn't see it on the
[47:31] outside yet and he actually was hesitant
[47:34] to run towards the physis I'm just gonna
[47:36] see if I can ask him just to be a
[47:37] servant in his house I'll be glad to do
[47:39] it I'm earlier unworthy I've walked away
[47:41] from all this stuff I've got all this
[47:43] but but
[47:44] father could see his heart was changed
[47:45] so if the hearts changed that's the
[47:49] first step can you say man before even
[47:52] repented the father's look at him he ran
[47:54] towards the Sun can you say man son fell
[47:58] down and he says Lord I'm unworthy make
[48:00] me a serve I'm worthy to cover your
[48:02] house he starts repenting true
[48:04] repentance and that's all the father
[48:06] needed can you say man
[48:08] he was as predestinated son of God that
[48:10] had come back what was his father's
[48:13] answer yeah you know you know I'm gonna
[48:15] give you a few days here I've thought
[48:19] about this and you really you know my
[48:22] goodness you have really mess yourself
[48:24] up bud look at you I know what all you
[48:27] did I heard it I seen into the
[48:28] newspapers you brought a reproach on my
[48:30] name you did a bunch of stuff my
[48:32] goodness I can't believe that father
[48:34] just forgive me well you know I'm gonna
[48:36] forgive you but there's gonna be some
[48:37] time involved makes me broken this
[48:44] morning to see if that don't correct
[48:46] this I don't know what can I tell you
[48:47] friends we need the father's heart when
[48:49] it comes to these people you need to do
[48:53] this you need to go to the 10 steps you
[48:54] need there's a seminar I know you need
[48:58] to come through the steps here and build
[49:00] your way back god help us said Lord you
[49:05] know what can I do you know it's restful
[49:07] responsible kill the fatted calf bring
[49:10] my best robes it's time to rejoice
[49:15] rejoice
[49:17] I feel unworthy rejoice look what I've
[49:19] done no my sons back he's repented it's
[49:23] time to rejoice he doesn't have to come
[49:28] through the ten steps of psychology to
[49:30] work his way back repentance will bring
[49:32] them all the way where repentance will
[49:34] do the job
[49:35] he was my son before the foundation of
[49:38] the world bring the robe bring the
[49:40] fatted calf let's have a rejoicing bring
[49:43] the musicians get Boaz on the organ get
[49:46] brother Mike on the piano get Weston
[49:48] Solomon on the drums it's time rejoice
[49:51] it's time to have a good time
[49:56] praise be to God can you say mad
[50:00] hallelujah oh my that was a hint for the
[50:04] musicians to come you should have taken
[50:05] that because if you don't I'm gonna keep
[50:07] preaching the joy comes when there's
[50:10] true repentance can you say man there is
[50:13] no joy I want you to notice now there's
[50:15] no joy over the ninety and nine just
[50:17] persons which need no repentance they
[50:20] don't need to repent if we've lost the
[50:22] desire to repent even as a Christian
[50:24] we've lost almost everything can you say
[50:27] mine so I'm asking for a move of God to
[50:30] focus on the one I want Wesley to sing
[50:32] that song he's saying Monday night if if
[50:34] I'm asking you to pray I'm asking for a
[50:37] move of God in our congregation are you
[50:39] with me Saints to to get our focus on
[50:43] the one instead of the message movement
[50:45] as it is now I'm asking the church to
[50:48] get your focus off of what's going on in
[50:50] the entire message and get your focus on
[50:52] the one the sheep can you say man that
[50:54] is lost I'm asking you to pray and to be
[50:57] broken to make this assembly the best
[50:59] representation of this message and the
[51:02] best atmosphere for a sinner to come if
[51:04] the truth were told we on the message
[51:07] are more self focused than what we'd
[51:08] ever omit can you say Amen praise the
[51:12] Lord and and people don't want to hear
[51:16] all the mess that's going on I remember
[51:19] being in a meeting years ago and there
[51:22] was a great controversy I was asked for
[51:24] it's a bunch of ministers to come and
[51:25] discuss it to try to settle it great
[51:27] controversy of the messages in Charlotte
[51:29] and I was there with a bunch of
[51:30] ministers and so it was a thing going on
[51:33] attention and brothers are going back
[51:35] and forth and they were sending messages
[51:37] across the internet and preaching it on
[51:39] the internet to go back and forth and I
[51:42] won't mention names but I'm just here to
[51:43] tell you it was a great controversy but
[51:45] I remember staying there for the
[51:46] ministers I felt something come my heart
[51:48] just
[51:48] this I said some of you have very
[51:50] popular ministers and you're on
[51:51] streaming and thousands of people are
[51:52] watching you I want to just share with
[51:54] you when you get across the pulpit to
[51:56] preach and you only preach the negative
[51:58] and you only trying to correct all the
[52:00] message problems there's some so over in
[52:03] China that's streaming in and they could
[52:05] care less about these problems now I
[52:09] wasn't very popular in that room but I
[52:11] wanted to say it for all of us preachers
[52:12] for all of us Saints a hungry soul could
[52:15] care less about all the controversy and
[52:18] all the message stuff going on that's so
[52:23] over in China when they stream in they
[52:25] want to hear truth they want to hear the
[52:27] positive truth they want to hear God
[52:29] that how God can restore can you say man
[52:30] they want to be changed by the
[52:32] supernatural power of God so when we
[52:34] only have an hour to preach I think we
[52:36] ought to preach the positive Word of God
[52:38] that's why you see me not having to
[52:40] address we had a big thing that happened
[52:42] ten years ago in the message I didn't
[52:44] even address it across the board just
[52:45] left a note because most of you iack
[52:46] marked my carnation didn't even know it
[52:49] existed it was going on I didn't need to
[52:50] talk about it
[52:52] I got the brothers together and
[52:54] discussed it with them but I tell you we
[52:56] only have an opportunity here for an
[52:58] hour
[52:59] well you only have opportunities just to
[53:01] talk to person a few minutes one thing I
[53:02] have learned in talking to people is
[53:05] that we're more anointed than what we
[53:06] realize I said you're more anointed than
[53:10] what you realize and you've got got
[53:12] things in your heart that sometimes just
[53:14] a few sentences to that person in some
[53:17] cases it'll never go away from him
[53:19] they'll go back to it and think about it
[53:21] over and over again because there's
[53:23] power in the word of the bride I said
[53:26] there's power in the word of the bride
[53:28] so I'm asking us let's forget let's get
[53:31] our minds off of social media and all
[53:32] the stuff and debates that are going on
[53:35] over this that and the other and
[53:36] Christmas and on fighting battles with
[53:39] quotes back and forth
[53:42] I had a couple in the church when I
[53:44] first started pastoring and they were
[53:47] having bad arguments and I was just a
[53:49] young pastor I didn't know how to what
[53:50] to say I wasn't even married yet said
[53:53] what do we do with this is the head Lord
[53:55] I said I don't know how to do this but
[53:57] they said they got talking and they said
[53:58] in our arguments we're kind of shooting
[54:00] the Bible and quotes at one another to
[54:03] defend each other and go back I said
[54:04] well I have one bit of information I can
[54:07] tell you may not know a lot but I know
[54:09] the Word of God and the message is too
[54:12] precious for you to bring in your carnal
[54:14] argument
[54:16] leave the word out of it it's too
[54:19] precious not meant for that our message
[54:21] is not given to us to argue about to
[54:24] fuss about let's quit arguing about the
[54:27] resurrection and let's get the
[54:28] resurrection within us I want to be in
[54:32] the resurrection I want to have the
[54:33] resurrection power I don't want to
[54:35] debate when it's gonna happen in all
[54:37] these other details and we have so much
[54:39] knowledge and the message and revelation
[54:41] but we have more knowledge people get
[54:42] puffed up with knowledge we know so much
[54:44] that it brings us into immaturity that
[54:47] we're supposed to fight on one until we
[54:48] convince one another of what's right and
[54:50] we've completely lost the main focus and
[54:54] that's to create an atmosphere with the
[54:55] Holy Ghost someone could be changed and
[54:58] repented and they could receive this
[55:00] truth how many raised hands say make me
[55:02] Christ in me that sinners are attracted
[55:04] to be around me
[55:05] oh yeah sinners are attracted publicans
[55:10] are attracted he's got something to say
[55:12] I want to hear it every one of you I'm
[55:16] asking you to take your mind and your
[55:18] sometimes it brings depression I'm
[55:21] asking you to take your mind this year
[55:23] off of your problems
[55:25] when you're focused on your problems
[55:27] you're not focused on somebody else to
[55:29] help somebody else I'm asking you to
[55:32] repent and focus off of your problems
[55:34] and focus on the right thing and when
[55:38] you do that you're gonna see God work
[55:40] out your problems you're too focused on
[55:43] your problem do you focus on your
[55:44] complexes to focus on yourself self
[55:48] focused god help us to die to that this
[55:51] morning and become focused on the main
[55:55] thing there's somebody still out there
[55:58] and we're not complete somebody's still
[56:01] here that hasn't come and we're
[56:04] incomplete until they're in

[1:05:33] to keep on bringing these strings before
[1:05:36] the lost sheep Lord the lost ones that
[1:05:39] our focus should be on the ones that are

[1:05:55] controversies and losing sleep over
[1:05:57] there whether we have this just right or
[1:05:59] not oh god help us not to be that way
[1:06:02] but help our burden to increase as we
[1:06:05] look in Jeremiah Isaiah there learn says
[1:06:07] that mark them that sigh and cry for the
[1:06:09] abominations done in the city that would
[1:06:12] be the seal of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:06:14] ones that are sighing and crying for the
[1:06:16] abominations that would be the seal of
[1:06:19] something within us that would be
[1:06:20] Abraham crying out Lord if there's 50
[1:06:22] Lord if there's 30 if there's 20 would
[1:06:25] you spare him Lord crying out for a lot
[1:06:27] Oh Lord we need a deeper experience with
[1:06:31] you Lord we thank you for the unveiled
[1:06:34] truth of the third pole being open to us
[1:06:36] we thank you for the seven seals being
[1:06:39] revealed to us Lord we're thankful to
[1:06:41] live in such glory subsets truth Lord
[1:06:43] but God what have we done with it father
[1:06:47] what have we done with it Lord some
[1:06:51] hungry heart Lord may they be drawn to
[1:06:53] us I pray and may you prepare the ground
[1:06:56] of
[1:06:56] their hearts that the words I would say
[1:06:58] even if it's an invite to church it
[1:07:01] would be the trigger for that heart to
[1:07:03] be changed draws to repentance as we've
[1:07:06] asked for the sinners but Lord if
[1:07:09] there's repentance needed in our lives
[1:07:10] we repent before you Lord forgive us and
[1:07:13] may our may be we rejoice over the right
[1:07:16] things Lord we rejoice over this and
[1:07:19] that and the other nice things in life
[1:07:21] that we get and that's fine but help us
[1:07:24] to really find the real rejoicing that's
[1:07:27] when someone Lord finds the cross finds
[1:07:32] the power of the Cross granted father

[1:07:38] us different lord help us to to walk
[1:07:41] closer to you and I pray you'll draw the

[1:08:13] gathered together at four o'clock for a
[1:08:14] short Lord's Supper foot-washing tonight
[1:08:17] and fellowship together looking forward

[1:08:22] bless you all
[1:08:23] I pray that this is not offensive to
[1:08:26] anybody I pray that it was taken in good
[1:08:28] a good spirit and you understand my
[1:08:31] heart don't always bring it just the way
[1:08:34] that I want to bring it but we need to
[1:08:36] be focused on the right thing and that's
[1:08:39] my heart is that we focus on our
[1:08:40] problems too much focus on ourself too
[1:08:44] much our own prayers sometimes so we
[1:08:50] focus on someone else's need then God
[1:08:54] has a way of blessing us for the desires
[1:08:56] that we have
[1:08:59] god bless you even if they don't believe
[1:09:04] you just
