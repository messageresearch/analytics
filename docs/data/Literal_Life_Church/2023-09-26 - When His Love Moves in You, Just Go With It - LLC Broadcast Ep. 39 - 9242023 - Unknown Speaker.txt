hide me hide me hide me in your holy name [Music] hide me in [Music] your when the rise and I run to hide Lord in you I find my Hiding Place Lord in you I find my Hiding Place Matthew 18 and verse 21 and then came Peter to him and said Lord how often should shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him uh till seven times and Jesus saith unto him I say it not unto thee until seven times but until 70 * 7 so you just put that math together get your calculator and uh total all that up and you see um a picture of the Divine love of God Amen a picture of the Forgiveness of God there's no restraints on it can you say Amen so in his in his response to Peter then he goes into this Parable that says therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King which would taken account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents now the scripture here is given a pretty large amount and I looked at it yesterday you translate that into our money today and it's about $34 billion so it's almost almost an exaggeration and you're going to see why in just a minute because it's almost if the king knew and this servant knew there there really wasn't a way probably to pay that back it was so huge reminds us of our debt to the Lord can you say Amen we owe him everything and so when he had begun to reckon one was brought into him which owed him 10,000 talents for but for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made because that's what they did the Old Testament uh they they would sell the family they had to sell their children they had to sell uh their land if they got in debt the servant therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay and I will pay thee all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt so I want you to notice the action was to forgive all of the debt but first he was moved by something he was moved this King was moved by something and he was moved with compassion amen and his move being moved with compassion uh he was able to then take an action of loosing this man and forgiving it forgiving his debt and if you don't know the rest of the parable we'll finish it but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a 100 Pence and he laid laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay the all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw that it was done they were very sorry and came and told their lord all that was done then his Lord after he had called him said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on the fellow servant even as I had pity on thee and his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was do unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespass I want to speak on when his love when his Divine love begins to move in you Just Go With It Just go with it and something was moved in the heart of this ruler and he was moved with compassion and when he was moved a certain way he acted on that and he forgave so he acted upon what his heart was being moved to do it's important that we not only are moved but that we act upon the way that we are moved um it's important that if the Lord leads us and calls us and we feel that and particularly this morning I'm going to get into his his Divine love and I'm I'm reminded of the examples um in brother brandom's life is that when something happened to him that he said something come over him and when he was challenged by demon Spirits then something come over him he said he said oh I wish I could have that all the time but something was able to come over him that was different than his human love different than his thinking different than his mind because some of the situations with demonic power you would normally be afraid of it you would be thinking what do I do do I run what do I do so your mind is always trying to think what do I do in this situation then something grave greater begin to move his heart and all that thinking was washed away and he reacted according to the love of God which by the way the love of God is a stronger Force than any demon power and so when it moved on him he chose to act upon what was moving in his heart and thus he forgave he he he had Power Authority in the name of Jesus Christ and all that became the power to break the power of the enemy so now when God moves on us when this love moves on us then we should move with that and act upon that and this is what this ruler did when he was moved with something he acted on it in this case he forgave when he was when he was moved with with this uh a spirit of compassion then we realized that it would not it would be contrary to our thinking uh it wouldn't be normal for us to to react this way to forgive in other words the normal thinking would just be to respond that that we think it through and he's got all of this debt making maybe he can set up a payment plan our our mind maybe maybe or the worst case scenario scenario is to basically say no no no you've done this you're finished you're done we're putting you into prison this is a lot of debt that's what our Norm because I'm not helping the guy by forgiving him and so you've got all this and so the Mind thinks through thing when this ruler in the parable was moved with compassion he acted on the compassion but he didn't act upon what he would thought cuz he would if he would have thought he would have talked himself out of forgiving him the mind if it was given time to reason with this it would possibly override this compassion that he felt the mind would override if you're thinking sensibly it would not be to forgive this debt but to teach this guy a lesson the mind will override this so now I've been pondering a little bit this Divine love that we've been preaching about and uh I've been thinking about it and deeply in in in working in the people of God and particularly working in me this divine Capstone love working in me and thinking about as we went over its characteristics and we went over its actions and all the points in 1 Corinthians 13 of the excellent way we've gone over those things now and hopefully I can spend time and put it together in a little booklet or something to get you all the quotes and the scriptures pretty soon but so but so now we learned that it was a when when God comes in and we act this way it's a different course than human love it's a different action than human love it's something greater it's a for it's a presence Divine love is not a teaching uh it's not mind over matter it's not a mind over matter exercise it's a presence it's a force it's his presence he's the source Divi Divine love so when he shows up that is the best of his love can you say that is his love so it's more than a teaching it's not mind over matter and some exercise in our mind it moves deep and if it moves deep it comes out and it wants to express that Divine love and then when it's a person is moved by it and and when somebody acts upon that Divine love then something different happens every time than the expected outcome somebody say praise the Lord something Supernatural can happen something great can happen when love projects Sovereign Grace takes over the situation and there's no demon greater than that Divine love the problem is is when it moves upon us we've got to let it we got to go with it we got to trust it we can't let this mind interrupt the moving of the spirit of God so now we can we can start at a very basic Point here this morning with the scripture John 3:16 which is quoted probably more than any other scripture in the world in Christian Realms but in the world everybody knows John 3:16 and so I I'm uh it's quoted more than any other and yet the question is how many people really understand John 3:16 so it says for God so loved the world that he gave so that's what I'm preaching this morning God himself was moved as he looked at humanity and looked at the humanity that has fallen and as soon as they had fallen God was moved by something God in himself in the core of himself was moved by love his own love that he had within him but he was moved by it God so loved the he could have had a lot of responses to the condition of the world he has judgment he could have responded first with judgment but he wasn't moved by judgment first he wasn't moved by his law first he wasn't moved by the thought I told them not to do that and they did it anyway he was not moved by all the other characteristics that's in God the first thing that God was moved in his heart with for this world in its condition is he was moved with his love if God's heart wasn't moved to love you you wouldn't even be here this morning you wouldn't have salvation this morning you wouldn't have a desire to serve God but God so loved the world that that now he has he's moved by this but his love was not just moved he took action God so loved that he gave his only begotten son John 3:16 is is something that we know but look at look at what it says here he's seen the condition of the world in man it was fallen and something moved within him something moved within God for you he was moved with compassion he was moved God's first reaction was not judgment what a bunch of losers man I created them and I did all these things what a bunch as first response is my goodness what in the world is you know what a bunch of sad losers that's not what we have coming out of God love moved him can you say amen and in his thought that love moved him to think in his thoughts he his love moved him to start thinking thoughts and you know one of the thoughts he seen and thought in his mind a lamb slain yes amen this is all in God's thoughts because if you know your Bible he said that there was there's ones written in the Lamb's Book of Life who was SL L before the foundation of the world so in these great movement of God's love and something in him just churned and stirring in his heart with love then his thoughts begin to come to what what what am I going to provide what am I going to provide for them so in his thoughts all this happened before you were even born before sin came into the picture God went through all this in his thoughts and he seen a lamb slain before the foundation of the world before you sinned before you did anything wrong God thought it through and his love moved to provide a lamb for your sin somebody ought to shout praise the Lord this morning it's all happening in God's thoughts and he's moved by love a lamb slain this is what they would need to be saved oh they need a way out they need an answer all this was going on in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world it's scriptural he's seen you he's seen your Fallen condition he was moved with love he was thinking of you he thought through the whole scenario of a lamb being slain for you his love was moving him in these kind of thoughts oh God help me to get this across this morning if love starts to turn in your heart stay with it go with it and let thoughts come from that what can I do to forgive that person what can I do to love that person how can I Point them to the way out everybody's going to criticize them everybody's going to judge them but Lord you have put Divine love within me his love was moving in these kind of thoughts but then those thoughts were materialized and they weren't just thoughts they became reality and he acted out of his love God God was moved by love and he gave his only begotten son his love moved in him so much that he acted on it he went with it even before he could give his son though he was already moved in the Garden of Eden when man fell he was already moved with love and compassion and Reconciliation and looking for a way to find Fellowship again it wasn't Adam running back to God saying God forgive me I'm at the altar I have sinned no he did what a lot of us do we go hide with our sin we hide in our shame we hide in our gift so it wasn't Adam and Eve running after God let me tell you something when I was 12 12 years old I came to the Altar and I did this and I did that and I did no no no no no no no if you come it's because God's already calling you to come and he loves you enough to call your heart if you've got something laying there as I want more of God it's because he put that there so before the son could come because it would be a matter of time before he could bring his his only begotten son and send him to Calvary before that could happen man's already fallen and God is rushing down man Adam wasn't looking for God God came looking for Adam because what his love was moving within him he wanted reconciliation comes over they're hiding behind the bushes somewhere and so God says Adam where are you and he says you know we're back here uh uh we're naked we're hiding ourselves who told you you were naked you know the scenario but God is running after uh I'll repeat it again our dear brother Ron Spencer who who said that a third of the Angels fell in heaven and God never moved moved on it but one son and daughter fall and God's rushing to make reconciliation what is man that thou art mindful of him it's better than the Angels you have a position of the love of God being towards you that's better than the Angels don't you feel L this morning don't you may reach your back say God I live my hands no one's loved me like you've loved me Lord we're living in a world that nobody loves anybody and the Love Has Gone cro cold and that's why people act the way they do cuz they're not loved right from a child they're not Lov right but I can tell you I don't care what family you come from there's a God that's churning in his heart his heart is stirring because he loves you so much said what are you doing behind the bushes there come out here and and and when he did he threw some skins slain some animals the blood was on the Skins he said he threw these over put these on you I'll take care of this and what is he doing his blood is finding a a place for Fellowship even before he sent his only begotten son he's trying his love is trying to find a place of reconciliation I just need some fellowship again with you I'm not going to leave you out there by yourself come out of those bushes I say to you this morning whoever is listening come out of those bushes come out of your shame come out of your guilt come out from of the bushes and by the way get rid of your covering of religion because religion is a covering to hide your sin religion is a covering and they had they had sewn fig leaves together to cover their private parts God said take those off it's only blood that's a proper covering put these lamb skins on [Applause] you but you dare stay in the bushes with your religious covering come out here and I'll give you a covering I'll give you blood somebody say praise the Lord so even before he could give his son he's calling I want you I want you your fellowship I want you back it was love moving in him to say that he threw some skins to him from a killed lamb around their bodies and he found a place to begin reconciliation his love Found A Door of Hope found a place it wasn't his son yet but he found a place to start in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 Paul was moved to tell the church to forgive a really bad brother in the church bad man cuz in 1 Corinthians the Corinthian Church this guy was um having sexual relations with his um stepmother I believe it was and uh it was in the church he was coming to church he was having communion he was doing all this stuff and they weren't rebuking it they were like oh he's a brother and then everybody was kind of hiding it and he rebuked that church you don't hide that thing you call that thing out that's the love of God too and so but then when they called it out and and and and rebuked him and dealt with it cuz Paul said you got to deal with this there's sin in the camp and a A little leaven leavens the whole lump you wonder why preaches preachers have to correct things well it's the holy spirit because if you let sin go on in the camp it'll start affecting the rest of the young people and the rest of the church so he told them what to do and they did it and then he wrote him another letter in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 and he he's moved in his heart he senses in his spirit that this boy's changed his ways and he's he's asked for forgiveness he's asked for repentance to the church now he's coming he's obviously a changed man something is happening in his life and he tells the church it's time to forgive him so by Paul's letter they were moved brought him brother you're reinstated to the church you have repented and we restore you so he says so he doesn't get discouraged and the devil doesn't get advantage of this situation that's where he says we're not ignorant of Satan's devices I could read these to you you read them on yourself at your homework read this is all in the Bible we're not ignorant of Satan because what can happen if forgiveness doesn't come Satan WS havoc and creates I shouldn't say creates but makes more problems because there's no forgiveness there's no restoring of Fellowship now the devil really takes that life if there's just judgment and no mercy if there's no love moving in the congregation then the devil actually makes it worse for that person is anybody hearing what I'm saying it's time to be a mature church it's time to know that we're the ones that hold We're The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat is in the heart of the Bride we're the ones that hold the Divine love if somebody can't find forgiveness they ought to be able to find it within the love of God and the body of Christ that whole mind thing and our thinking um many of you are here today because the love of God moved into your life amen and not just that it moved on you but many of you responded some of you haven't responded yet you know God loves you and you know and you're here and you know it's good to be in church on Sunday mornings but there's so much of this still and I'm going to call it stinking thinking that's what my dad called it stinking thinking and so you have not come where you need to come yet because it's being preached to you the love of God is present you know where it's wanting to take you but you leave this service all the time but interrupted by this you're too scared you won't let go so you're going to walk back into your car and back to your house with the same fears the same Hang-Ups the same scares because you're thinking talk you out of responding to the Lord and becoming broken some people can't even cry and I'm not saying crying is everything but everybody worships there everybody's responds different but some people haven't cried for years except for a cat dying or something like that but but cried because of the conviction of the Holy Spirit I'm cried I'm moved by the Lord and I'm going with it I don't care what happens tomorrow I don't care how embarrassed I am to be at the altar balling my ISS out I don't care anymore I'm going with it that's what we got to do we've got to respond that way we've got to quit letting our mind talk us out of the moving of the love of God we've got to quit let our minds talking out of worshipping God freely we've got to quit quenching the spirit of God when it's trying to move Among Us it's it's but many of you are here today and responded one day in your life to the love of God I say praise the Lord amen thank you you're where you're at because you you you weren't just moved you responded you repented and that action moved you and you something moved in your life and you acted on it and that's why I say when he does if you're listening to me on the broadcast today or anywhere wherever you're at in the world
