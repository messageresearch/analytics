[3:20] [Music]
[3:21] way no it's not easy to
[3:28] stray there is a cross in your
[3:34] way 1 Corinthians 13:12 and 13 for now
[3:38] we see through a glass Darkly but then
[3:40] face to face now I know in part but then
[3:43] shall I know even as also I am known and
[3:46] now abideth faith hope charity these
[3:49] three but the greatest of these is
[3:52] Charity I want to title this the bride
[3:54] shall know him as she is known the bride
[3:58] shall know when I say shall know know
[4:00] it's because there's a prophecy and
[4:02] it'll be this time that the bride shall
[4:04] know Christ the bride shall know him as
[4:07] she is known prophecy of Paul saying
[4:11] that at that day he's he's saying now
[4:13] for we see through a glass in the first
[4:15] church age we see through a glass we see
[4:17] Christ through a glass but then face to
[4:20] face and so we know that that's a per
[4:23] prophecy also he mentions that in verse
[4:25] 10 if you're looking when that which is
[4:28] perfect is come then that which is in
[4:30] part shall be done away so that is a
[4:33] prophecy there'll be a coming day when
[4:35] that which is perfect will come and that
[4:38] that which is in part shall be done away
[4:40] I personally believe that there's enough
[4:42] Vindication to show that we're in that
[4:44] day when that which is perfect has come
[4:46] we just want to Echo what we said on
[4:48] Sunday about this knowing him face to
[4:51] face and the bride coming to know him in
[4:53] a face to face relationship and I'll
[4:55] just say it this way that if our vision
[4:57] of Christ is limited if we have a a
[4:59] limited which Paul describes here as a
[5:02] dark glass or seeing through a glass
[5:05] Darkly seeing through a window that's
[5:07] faded or a window that doesn't give the
[5:09] full picture Christ is on the other side
[5:12] and it's not clear through the window
[5:13] because it's it's through a glass Darkly
[5:16] and that's the simplest way to explain
[5:18] that's how they looked through this
[5:20] glass Darkly to see Christ and when
[5:22] we're look at them that way it's it's a
[5:24] wonderful thing but he says there'll be
[5:25] come a day when we'll have a
[5:27] face-to-face relationship with Christ
[5:29] not through a glass Darkly can you say
[5:31] manam and so if our but here's the point
[5:34] if the if our vision of Christ is
[5:36] limited if we see through a glass Darkly
[5:40] then other things are limited and we
[5:42] have a partial revelation of Christ
[5:44] throughout the ages they had a partial
[5:46] Revelation and the the wonderful thing
[5:48] about the Believers in God who were had
[5:50] the Holy Ghost in every age they
[5:53] connected with what Christ was doing in
[5:55] that hour his word for that hour and
[5:57] when they connected with that they they
[5:59] lived it they believed it with all their
[6:01] heart that even though it was a partial
[6:03] revelation of Christ they gave their all
[6:06] to it some of them gave their lives to
[6:07] it do you know that those Believers that
[6:10] were beheaded and given their lives for
[6:12] the gospel of Christ they did all that
[6:14] and sacrificed their life knowing very
[6:17] little of the of the character of Christ
[6:19] knowing very little of what we enjoy
[6:21] today of what Christ and yet they gave
[6:23] their lives for it I'd say that if we
[6:26] know that this much of Christ in this
[6:28] hour and we're blessed with so much re
[6:30] word revealed to us then we ought to
[6:32] give our all to it you got brothers and
[6:34] sisters you're going to shake hands with
[6:35] when you get on the other side and I'll
[6:37] tell you I'm going to feel humbled to be
[6:39] in front of them because they gave their
[6:41] lives and they only had a partial
[6:42] revelation of Christ they didn't know
[6:45] them like we're blessed to know him
[6:46] today but they gave their lives for it
[6:48] they gave their all to it we should give
[6:50] our all to it can you say Amen a partial
[6:53] Revelation uh will tend to make our love
[6:56] partial as well as what we said Sunday a
[6:58] partial revelation will make our love
[7:00] partial and uh I want you to I want just
[7:03] to bring back some scriptures again
[7:05] related to the subject that partiality
[7:08] in the body of Christ shouldn't be there
[7:10] looking at one another and showing
[7:12] partiality with one another shouldn't be
[7:14] happening it happens in the world it
[7:16] happens in schools it it it happens in
[7:18] business can you say man there people
[7:21] are partial to different ones and
[7:23] they're they're partisan and all these
[7:25] other things but within the Holy Ghost
[7:28] kingdom of God the partiality should go
[7:31] away and we should look at one another
[7:32] Through The Eyes of Christ and we
[7:35] shouldn't just have favorites can you
[7:37] say man and look down on other ones and
[7:39] try to judge each other but when we're
[7:41] looking through this glass and see
[7:42] Christ then he sees us without
[7:44] partiality so we should see one another
[7:47] that way so we have when we have a
[7:49] limited view in the face of Christ if we
[7:51] have a limited view then we're going to
[7:53] be limited in how this love comes out
[7:55] from us to others and that's the uh
[7:58] point that I was going to bring Sunday
[8:00] and so as Believers we cannot be partial
[8:03] in judgment or in our treatment of
[8:05] others we can't be partial in our
[8:07] treatment with others if you haven't
[8:09] learned anything from this uh excellent
[8:11] Way series you I would say if you learn
[8:14] it you you should learn this that we are
[8:17] to react to everyone in the love of
[8:20] Christ the same way and and the
[8:22] treatment of other people they deserve
[8:25] to be treated with the love of Christ
[8:27] and given the love of Christ and and I'm
[8:29] not talking about compromising because
[8:30] you have to tell the truth love is
[8:32] rooted in truth but but when we're
[8:34] treating people wrong uh because we
[8:36] think they're less that doesn't belong
[8:37] in the body of Christ we should treat
[8:39] one you know hey everybody wants to be
[8:40] treated right how many raise your hand I
[8:43] like to be treated right I like to be
[8:44] treated with respect and uh you know no
[8:48] nobody likes to be abused whether it's
[8:50] mental or verbal or physical abuse uh
[8:53] sexual abuse that's a disrespect to the
[8:55] human being and so none of us like to be
[8:58] disrespected whe whether it's an
[8:59] attitude coming we we like to be treated
[9:01] right and if there ever is a place that
[9:03] you see the treatment of one another
[9:05] with high respect and love and you may
[9:08] disagree but the the the respect and the
[9:10] treatment of one another and and
[9:12] feelings and love for one another it
[9:14] should be resident Among Us and when
[9:16] it's not I would just say this safely
[9:19] when it's not happening somebody is not
[9:21] looking into the face of Christ
[9:23] correctly there's a there's a story that
[9:26] I remember a quick little story about
[9:28] Leonardo deiny
[9:30] uh d viny as he's painting the face of
[9:33] Christ and I've mentioned this before
[9:35] but there's a story that when he was
[9:37] painting the face of Christ on the the
[9:40] painting he was doing of the last supper
[9:42] and he was there and he was intently
[9:44] just working on the face of Christ and
[9:47] uh Leonardo he got angry at one of his
[9:50] servants and he lashed out at him he
[9:52] just lashed out he got upset they had
[9:53] done something wrong and so he pulled
[9:55] away from uh painting the face of Christ
[9:57] and he just got real mad and he lashed
[9:59] that out at him and then he went back to
[10:02] and he and he he says he could not he
[10:05] was stumbling and and struggling to go
[10:08] back to fa painting the face of Christ
[10:10] he had trouble with it and he he tried
[10:13] and he couldn't do it he tried he
[10:14] couldn't do it and there was too much
[10:16] evil just stirring within him and his
[10:18] anger and he had a lack of peace and
[10:20] that lack of peace made him throw down
[10:22] his brushes go and find that servant
[10:25] that boy and ask forgiveness from him
[10:29] just effective he could not paint the F
[10:31] of face of Christ and have that feeling
[10:34] within him now that's just a natural
[10:37] thing it's just a natural story but I
[10:38] think it says something to us of what
[10:41] I'm trying to minister on that there's
[10:44] something about when we're when we're
[10:46] looking into him and looking at him
[10:50] through the word of God and we're
[10:51] keeping focused on him makes it very
[10:55] difficult to hate one another
[10:57] am why because we're being changed into
[11:00] looking at the way Christ sees it right
[11:03] so we can kind of tell in our lives when
[11:05] we're not in the face of Christ enough
[11:07] we become affected so by so many other
[11:09] carnal things but when we're looking at
[11:11] him so he I just finished in the story
[11:13] he went and asked forgiveness and and
[11:15] then only through asking forgiveness and
[11:17] prayer did Leonardo did he did he have
[11:20] an inner calm and settle down enough to
[11:23] go back to painting the face of Christ
[11:26] he settled down because he asked
[11:28] forgiveness hello he asked forgiveness
[11:31] and he he he went to prayer and that's
[11:34] the type of things that relieves anger
[11:36] that's the type of things that relieves
[11:37] and so he did that and then he could
[11:39] calm down in order order to go back and
[11:41] paint the face of Christ First Timothy
[11:44] 5:19 says against it in this whole
[11:47] partiality thing and showing us it's not
[11:49] it doesn't belong Among Us within the
[11:51] church church people and Believers 1
[11:54] Timothy 5:19 against an elder receive
[11:57] not an accusation but but before two or
[12:00] three Witnesses so it's very important
[12:03] that Among Us that we be careful when an
[12:06] accusation comes against an elder and
[12:08] for that matter for anybody that's a
[12:09] member of the body of Christ it's very
[12:11] important we don't just accept that and
[12:13] take it as truth right and and so now
[12:16] notice the subject of partiality notice
[12:18] the subject of of waiting to see the
[12:21] whole picture of things not judging on
[12:24] partiality not judging on seeing it oh
[12:27] somebody made an accusation somebody gos
[12:29] somebody put an elder down somebody put
[12:31] a pastor down somebody put an elder in
[12:33] the church down we are we are taught in
[12:35] the scripture we are not to receive that
[12:37] just like that but out of the mouth of
[12:39] two or three Witnesses what in other
[12:41] words we're waiting to see if it's the
[12:42] truth before we believe it that's
[12:45] maturity in the body of Christ you don't
[12:47] just accept gossip you don't just take
[12:49] it as the final Authority because that's
[12:51] being partial in your judgment right and
[12:54] we're not supposed to be partial in our
[12:56] judgment we're not supposed to take half
[12:59] truths about somebody no none of us like
[13:01] that about us being said about us so in
[13:03] maturity we're not taking half truths
[13:06] about what we hear but before two or
[13:07] three Witnesses it goes deeper when it
[13:09] says in verse 20 them that sin rebuke
[13:12] before all that others also May fear now
[13:15] that's a strong scripture and I've never
[13:18] heard too many uh pastors talk about it
[13:20] nevertheless it is in the scripture that
[13:23] Among Us them that sin rebuke before All
[13:25] That Others May fear I can't help but
[13:28] think it's in this same subject of
[13:30] partiality it's in this same subject
[13:32] we'll be real harsh on somebody here and
[13:34] somebody over here we won't be as harsh
[13:36] on and we have to be careful about
[13:38] partiality in our judgment here it says
[13:41] rebuke before All That Others May fear
[13:43] fear because all of us are under the
[13:46] same Holy Spirit and and the word is the
[13:48] same and so in that theme then he says
[13:51] verse 21 I charge thee before God and
[13:53] for the Lord J and and the Lord Jesus
[13:55] Christ and the elect Angels is pretty
[13:58] serious that thou observe these things
[14:01] without preferring one before another
[14:05] doing nothing by
[14:07] partiality doesn't belong Among Us how
[14:10] many would just say that's that's good
[14:12] that's a good lesson for me that's the
[14:14] way it's supposed to function that you I
[14:17] say this before the elect angels and
[14:19] before the Lord Jesus Christ observe
[14:21] these things without preferring one
[14:23] before another without partiality and
[14:25] then it's echoed in again in James 2:2
[14:28] if you want to bring it up James 2:2
[14:30] said my brethren have not the Faith of
[14:32] Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory
[14:34] with respect to persons for if there
[14:37] come unto your assembly a man with the
[14:38] gold ring in go goodly apparel and there
[14:41] come also a poor man in Vile rment rment
[14:44] so in our day you know one comes in he's
[14:46] got all the rich clothes clothes on he
[14:49] he buys the very best he's got the very
[14:52] best of jewelry or she does and they're
[14:54] dressed really great maybe they're got a
[14:57] position in the in the uh in the county
[14:59] or in this or they're a mayor or
[15:01] something like that they're dressed good
[15:02] they drive drove the Mercedes in and
[15:05] then you got another guy gets out of his
[15:07] truck in overalls and he comes in and he
[15:11] stinks and he doesn't look that great
[15:13] and so our own human nature of this
[15:16] world is to judge them based upon those
[15:18] things we shouldn't do
[15:21] that and ye have respect to him that
[15:23] weareth the gay clothing come on in and
[15:26] say unto him sit thou here in a good
[15:28] place and give them the best place at
[15:30] the potluck and sit up close to the food
[15:32] and be the first in line and say to the
[15:35] poor stand back over here and sit here
[15:37] under my foot
[15:39] stol are you th not then partial in
[15:42] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[15:44] thoughts so it's it's related to now if
[15:49] we do not I'm getting back to seeing the
[15:51] face of Christ when we're looking at him
[15:53] then we see him the right way and his
[15:56] love flows through and the partiality it
[15:58] is grown because why if we if we see him
[16:02] impartial then we'll look at one another
[16:05] partially as I said Sunday he doesn't
[16:07] look up at us with a partial
[16:10] Revelation aren't you
[16:12] glad he knows us fully and not only does
[16:15] he knows know our weakness and what we
[16:17] were born in our first birth actually uh
[16:20] he knows us in our new birth and he
[16:22] knows us they're son we're a Son of God
[16:23] from the foundation of the world does
[16:26] God see you does God know you God knows
[16:29] you amen God knows who you really are
[16:31] God knew who you really were before you
[16:33] knew who you really were that's true and
[16:37] and so now that's why he can love you
[16:40] with a predestinated elect of love
[16:42] because he knows he really knows who you
[16:45] really are you take people a lifetime to
[16:48] figure out who they are sometimes and
[16:50] they the identity crisis and trying to
[16:52] be everybody else young people do that
[16:54] when they're young they're trying to be
[16:55] everybody else and we always preach to
[16:57] them find your IDE identity in the word
[16:59] of God and actually by looking into the
[17:00] face of Christ and his word you find who
[17:03] you really are because it's a revealing
[17:05] it's a knowing this Christianity this
[17:08] this message is an identity that we get
[17:11] to know how God made us what he made us
[17:14] for why he sent us what he sent us here
[17:17] to do can you say this message is a
[17:19] revealing of our true identity and the
[17:22] true identity of Christ and who he
[17:24] really is it's a knowing relationship
[17:26] it's not putting something on the
[17:28] outside it's not changing who we are all
[17:30] the time it's not having complexes of
[17:32] who we are it's finding out solid I'm
[17:35] confident I know this is the way God
[17:37] made me I'm comfortable in my own skin
[17:40] and I'm going to give God glory in the
[17:42] way he made me because I am known of God
[17:44] I know God I am known of God He Knows My
[17:47] Name can you say am man he knows who I
[17:49] am and so I'm going to be who I am
[17:52] because I know who I am what an age of
[17:55] what an age of an identity crisis right
[17:57] down to the perversion of not even
[18:00] knowing whether you're a boy or girl
[18:01] anymore it's a it's a it's a Satan's
[18:04] attack on the identity even of a man and
[18:07] a woman what a perverted thing it's an
[18:10] identity crisis and yet in the word of
[18:12] God we are fearfully and wonderfully
[18:15] made who we are and individually we are
[18:17] known of God and when we know that we're
[18:20] known and he reveals to us who we are he
[18:23] re reveals to us who he is and we find
[18:25] our identity in him can you say Amen
[18:28] when God unveils who he is completely
[18:30] and we can look at him face to face then
[18:33] it brings this victory in Divine love
[18:36] flowing through you it brings this
[18:39] victory in Divine love looking into his
[18:42] face this face-to-face relationship this
[18:45] knowing him knowing us and US fully
[18:47] knowing him perfectly it brings us into
[18:51] this victory of divine love that's why I
[18:52] conclude with this tonight that Paul is
[18:54] concluding the same way when we come in
[18:57] that day when that would is perfect has
[18:59] come we're looking perfectly into the
[19:01] face of Christ through his word it's a
[19:03] day of knowing it's a day of knowing who
[19:06] he is and it's a day of knowing who we
[19:08] are amen it's an unveiling it's a
[19:11] revealing it's it it's not smearing on
[19:15] Christianity it's not living off the
[19:17] blessings of
[19:19] Christianity let me say it this way it's
[19:21] not being just interested in Christ as
[19:23] The Giver it's being interested in
[19:25] Christ himself the person this is is not
[19:28] a religion this is a love relationship
[19:31] with Christ can you say Amen this is an
[19:33] everyday falling deeper in love with him
[19:36] I'm falling in love knowing as I get to
[19:37] know him more I fall in love with him
[19:39] more that's a true relationship in
[19:41] marriage too they start courtship and
[19:43] they start dating a courtship and so you
[19:44] know what it's about getting to know one
[19:46] another and so if you get to know one
[19:48] another and there's no love there it's
[19:49] just like I'm backing off but you keep
[19:51] if you keep get together and you know
[19:53] them more you keep falling in love with
[19:55] who they are and they're falling in love
[19:57] with you that's that's the way it is
[19:58] with Christ the more I get to know him
[20:00] the more I fall in love with him and so
[20:03] let me just say it this way how we're
[20:04] living day by day comes down to what
[20:07] we're looking at how you react to Life's
[20:10] troubles depends on this one thing what
[20:13] are you looking
[20:14] at what are you beholding what are you
[20:18] beholding in your life what are you
[20:19] looking at and if it's very little of
[20:22] this word in your life then you will not
[20:24] be able to react to Life's circumstances
[20:27] the right way but there's a power
[20:29] there's a power there's a
[20:31] transformation it just does it cuz God
[20:33] said in my in the gospel is power I'm
[20:36] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[20:38] Christ for it's the power under
[20:40] salvation it does something when we keep
[20:42] our eyes beholding the word of God we
[20:44] see him can you say amen and and and you
[20:47] don't have to work up the power you
[20:48] don't have to work up the transformation
[20:50] he just says keep beholding me keep
[20:53] looking at me and all the power to live
[20:55] to react to give love to to have wisdom
[20:59] in every situation it comes out of
[21:01] looking into his face and we look at it
[21:04] and it's hard to come out of prayer and
[21:06] come out of looking at his face it's
[21:09] hard to have ill feelings towards
[21:11] somebody when you're in that atmosphere
[21:13] of looking at him just like Leonardo
[21:16] just like it it's it was hard to stay
[21:18] ill in his in his
[21:20] heart coming to in front of the face of
[21:23] Christ that was just a
[21:25] picture I tell you when we're we got
[21:27] we're always looking at this there's a
[21:30] power that changes us we look at life
[21:33] different how you react to troubles
[21:35] depends on what you're looking at your
[21:36] Victory as a Christian is what you're
[21:38] mostly looking at in your life that's
[21:40] true if he is here and has appeared
[21:43] before us in this hour then we can see
[21:45] him clearly it brings the result of a
[21:48] constant change from glory to glory to
[21:51] glory we all with open face beholding as
[21:54] in a glass the glory of the Lord because
[21:57] the glory of God is in the word of God
[21:59] and I'm not just talking about just our
[22:00] Bible it's the word it's the word of
[22:03] power but it starts by reading your
[22:05] Bible it starts by getting into it it's
[22:07] staying in front of it it's staying in
[22:08] the message it's it's staying in the
[22:10] word of God it's not the technical
[22:12] Written Letter on here it's what we're
[22:14] looking at in his character and when we
[22:16] keep looking at and beholding it because
[22:18] James brings up that thing about uh
[22:20] someone who's not a doer of the word and
[22:23] just a hearer is the one that looks in a
[22:25] glass quickly and walks away but
[22:28] somebody who looks in a mirror and stays
[22:30] there and keeps looking and keeps
[22:32] looking he starts to see the flaw and
[22:34] becomes a doer of the word and not a
[22:37] hearer only right how REM how many
[22:40] remembers that scripture in
[22:41] James so we are in his appearing now
[22:45] we're his we're looking for his coming
[22:48] but we're in his appearing now he has
[22:52] appeared he is revealing his glory that
[22:55] which is perfect is come we we just need
[22:58] to keep looking at it and beholding it
[23:00] and gazing upon it and Americans and
[23:03] American believers stop stop being so
[23:07] distracted by so many things and
[23:10] beholding everything else if you behold
[23:13] the news every day you're going to be
[23:15] pretty weak and pretty
[23:17] scared if you're beholding social media
[23:20] most of the time you're going to be
[23:23] insecure you're going to be uh scared
[23:25] you're going to be dying into all
[23:28] different things of the world wisdom of
[23:31] this
[23:32] world what are you beholding uh you know
[23:35] right to the worst perverted things and
[23:37] looking at women and men on there if
[23:39] you're beholding that you're not going
[23:41] to survive it unless you pull out and
[23:43] say God take that from my life there's
[23:46] only one power I want controlling and
[23:48] leading my life and and guiding my life
[23:51] and that's the power of His Holy Spirit
[23:53] and his love working in me I won't be
[23:55] under the power of anything but so
[23:57] easily we get under the power of
[23:59] something else we get depressed by
[24:01] something else there's a power that goes
[24:04] with it and so we want to be under that
[24:05] so I'm going to switch down talk about
[24:07] this prophecy and I've been mentioning
[24:09] it that that when we get to the end time
[24:11] that which is perfect is come that which
[24:13] is perfect has come so Paul ends this
[24:15] with a prophecy that the bride of Christ
[24:18] of the last days shall see him and
[24:22] Behold Him clearly crystal clear through
[24:25] the word being revealed and his
[24:28] appearing through the word being
[24:30] revealed to us she this bride will
[24:33] Behold Him in a clear way and not
[24:36] through a glass
[24:39] Darkly let me say this respectfully
[24:42] dreams
[24:44] prophecies
[24:46] healings it's through a glass
[24:49] Darkly but it may not be knowing him
[24:52] this is a knowing relationship this is a
[24:54] knowing him
[24:56] relationship so dreams sometimes dreams
[24:59] are of the Lord sometimes they're not
[25:01] and if people want to follow every dream
[25:04] that they have I wouldn't follow hardly
[25:06] any of my
[25:08] dreams people get caught up in that this
[25:11] dream and this dream and they're trying
[25:12] to interpret it be
[25:14] careful be careful because unless
[25:16] there's someone that really has a gift
[25:18] there to interpret it uh you you could
[25:20] go way off track and guess what you're
[25:23] doing you you're seeing through a glass
[25:26] Darkly you're holding holding on to
[25:28] something that's it's a it's a partial
[25:31] trying to see what's coming and trying
[25:33] to see what's in your life and you know
[25:35] the thing is about the mystery of his
[25:36] will and that's what the Bible calls the
[25:37] mystery of his will you know his will is
[25:40] a mystery there's only one way to find
[25:42] his will is to look in his word because
[25:43] his word is his will amen I'm trying to
[25:46] find his will so you're looking maybe
[25:47] I'll give me I get I'll get a dream or
[25:49] something like that and and God does
[25:51] speak through but if you're only
[25:53] depending on a dream it's it's seeing
[25:55] through a glass Darkly there's a more
[25:58] sure word of Prophecy there's a there's
[26:00] a there's a a way the Lord can speak to
[26:02] you and drop it in your heart this is
[26:05] the will of God young people say well
[26:07] what do I do what career do I have and I
[26:10] don't know I wish the Lord had tell me
[26:11] to just be an engineer and God may do
[26:13] that God can do that he can impress upon
[26:15] your heart what to do but if if it's the
[26:17] details of what who do I marry and all
[26:19] these other things you know I say to
[26:21] people his will is in the word of God so
[26:24] get in the word stay in the word and out
[26:27] of that that's his will for this hour
[26:30] that's his achievement for this hour
[26:31] what does what is God's will that he
[26:34] wants to achieve for this hour right now
[26:37] right what is God's will right now what
[26:40] am I to be doing as a Christian in this
[26:42] hour and you find that in the word and
[26:44] you position yourself there then out of
[26:47] that he'll lead your heart to what job
[26:50] you should be having so what person to
[26:53] marry right amen see it all comes back
[26:55] to beholding his word stay in the word
[26:57] and you're going to be winging it if
[26:59] you're out of his word and you got to
[27:01] make big decisions in life and you're
[27:02] not staying in his word you're going to
[27:04] be winging it you found the fly it's off
[27:06] the cuff and I think vaguely I don't
[27:09] really have sure about this but I'm
[27:10] standing at the altar marrying this girl
[27:12] but I don't have full faith of it you
[27:14] can't do that you got to know where you
[27:16] stand you got to know it's his will can
[27:19] you say Amen to walk as solid as we can
[27:22] walk and there's nothing more solid in
[27:24] this world than beholding the word of
[27:26] God constantly he is revealing who you
[27:28] are and he's revealing who he is amen
[27:32] that's the
[27:33] hour at that day Jesus said you'll know
[27:37] I'm in the Father the father and me I in
[27:39] you and you and me you'll know what kind
[27:41] of Oneness is happening because I'm
[27:43] going to I'm going to appear to you and
[27:45] I'm going to reveal this whole plan to
[27:47] you I'm going to break open all this to
[27:50] you I'm not going to be partial I'm not
[27:52] I'm not going to be uh uh uh uh seeing
[27:55] you're not going to see me through a
[27:57] glass Darkly anymore but you're going to
[28:00] look at to me in a relationship that's
[28:01] face to face and thus you're going to
[28:03] know me and I'm going to know you
[28:06] there's nothing here and it's a
[28:08] relationship can you say Amen thank you
