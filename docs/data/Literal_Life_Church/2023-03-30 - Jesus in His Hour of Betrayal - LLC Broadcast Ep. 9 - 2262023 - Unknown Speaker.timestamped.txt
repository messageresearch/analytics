[7:44] else
[7:49] oh God
[7:50] [Music]
[7:57] please
[7:58] [Music]
[8:14] thank you
[8:17] I speak not of you all I know whom I
[8:21] have chosen but that the scripture may
[8:23] be fulfilled he that eateth bread with
[8:26] me hath lifted up his heel against me so
[8:29] he's he's already describing as as nice
[8:32] as they're having a time together here
[8:33] of course you know the disciples really
[8:36] don't have a clue what's going to happen
[8:37] the next few hours in his life he's told
[8:41] them but because they don't have a
[8:42] revelation they don't understand what's
[8:44] going to transpire to me it's going to
[8:46] be one of the greatest sacrifices
[8:47] anyone's ever made it's going to be the
[8:50] greatest pivotal time in history for The
[8:52] Souls of men and they don't have a clue
[8:54] they're just having this time and they
[8:56] don't know it's the final time with
[8:57] Jesus at least for that time and so now
[9:00] while he's sitting there there's another
[9:01] thing going on and he begins to describe
[9:04] it and that is he uses the scripture in
[9:06] the Old Testament he that eateth bread
[9:08] with me hath lifted up his heel against
[9:11] me
[9:12] now I tell you before it come that when
[9:14] it has come to pass ye may believe that
[9:16] I am he verily verily I say unto you he
[9:19] that receiveth whomsoever I sinned
[9:21] receiveth me and he that receiveth me
[9:24] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
[9:26] when Jesus had thus said he was troubled
[9:29] in spirit and testified and said verily
[9:32] verily I say unto you that one of you
[9:35] shall betray me
[9:37] remember he only has 12 disciples there
[9:39] it's a small crowd there but he said one
[9:42] of you shall betray me then the
[9:44] disciples looked one to another doubting
[9:46] of whom he spake now there was one
[9:49] leaning on Jesus bosom one of his
[9:51] disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter
[9:53] therefore beckoned to him that he should
[9:55] should ask who it should be of whom he's
[9:57] fake he then lying on Jesus breast saith
[10:00] on him Lord who is it who is it Jesus
[10:02] answered he it is to whom I shall give a
[10:05] sop when I have dipped it and when he
[10:08] hath dipped us up he gave it to Judas
[10:10] Iscariot the son of Simon and after the
[10:13] stop Satan entered into Judas then said
[10:17] Jesus unto him that that thou doest do
[10:19] quickly in other words in our language
[10:21] whatever you need to go do you should go
[10:24] do it now now he's never made that
[10:26] statement before even though one thing I
[10:28] want you to know tonight he's known
[10:30] what's in the heart of Jesus the entire
[10:32] Journey the entire three and a half
[10:34] years he knew he had to know
[10:37] but it wasn't until the hour come and
[10:40] the time come that Jesus began to expose
[10:42] it
[10:43] and actually gave him gave him the
[10:45] Liberty okay this is in your heart you
[10:48] need to go do what you need to do now no
[10:51] man at the table knew for what intent he
[10:53] spake this unto him for some of them
[10:55] thought because Jesus Judas had had the
[10:57] bag he took care of the money Judas had
[11:00] the bag that Jesus had said unto him by
[11:02] those things that we have need of
[11:04] against the feast or that he should give
[11:06] something to the poor that's once again
[11:08] the disciples are in the dark about
[11:10] what's really going on and so but Jesus
[11:13] knows exactly what's going on and that's
[11:14] why his spirit is troubled and the rest
[11:17] of them don't have a troubled spirit
[11:19] all this is going on and Jesus has a
[11:22] troubled spirit because he knows what's
[11:24] taken place and so he sends him off they
[11:26] think he's going just for food or
[11:27] something but he knows you need to go do
[11:29] what he you need to do verse 30 and he
[11:31] then having received the stop went
[11:34] immediately out and it was night and
[11:37] I'll get to this at the end of the
[11:38] service tonight but we're just 31 says
[11:41] therefore when he was gone out when
[11:43] Judas left Jesus said now is the son of
[11:46] man glorified and God is glorified in
[11:48] him and from that point on when Judas
[11:51] exited from that point on chapter 14
[11:54] chapter 15 chapter 16 is all an intimate
[11:59] time speaking just with his disciples
[12:01] and so it and he didn't he didn't do
[12:04] that before in quite this way now he
[12:07] changed and so now it's going to be a
[12:09] more intimate speaking just with his
[12:12] elect amen so I want to talk about Jesus
[12:14] in his hour of betrayal
[12:16] in this journey this week as when they
[12:19] come into the crucifixion Friday night
[12:20] and the Resurrection Sunday so I want to
[12:22] talk about Jesus in the hour of his
[12:25] betrayal and I just want to get into it
[12:29] a bit deeper tonight so that maybe we'd
[12:31] understand it maybe you have a a good
[12:33] understanding of it but I think it's
[12:34] relevant to talk about uh as Jesus went
[12:38] into we know that times that Jesus was
[12:41] rejected and Jesus was turned down by
[12:43] the religious leaders and so he he lived
[12:46] a life of rejection by many people he
[12:49] was accepted by his disciples but then
[12:51] as this hour come and it's described as
[12:54] when you come into this hour this this
[12:56] last hour it became a time of great
[12:59] betrayal that everyone was betraying
[13:01] Jesus not just Judas now because a few
[13:04] scriptures later Jesus after Jesus left
[13:07] then he actually says all of you will be
[13:09] offended so it's it's not just a spirit
[13:12] that is just on Judas now but the the
[13:16] spirit of betrayal is all around so much
[13:19] so that even his own elect are affected
[13:21] by this I'm scared I don't know what to
[13:24] do and so I'm just I'm gonna back off
[13:26] from this even as elector doing that but
[13:29] there's a difference in the elect in
[13:30] Judas can you say Amen there's a big
[13:32] difference even though sometimes they
[13:34] come under the spirit that's prevalent
[13:36] around but I just want to say tonight
[13:38] praise be to God there was one person
[13:41] there that did not bow or did not come
[13:43] under the spirit of betrayal and that
[13:45] was Jesus Christ himself
[13:47] can you say a man he was not going to
[13:49] betray God he was not going to betray
[13:51] the word he was not going to betray what
[13:53] the word said about him can you say
[13:54] ma'am and and I think that's a wonderful
[13:56] thing because I want to be like Jesus I
[13:59] want to be that one that's not the one
[14:00] that betrays him can you say amen I want
[14:03] to be loyal to our Lord I want to be
[14:05] loyal to the message of the hour I want
[14:07] to be faithful to him can you say Amen
[14:09] no matter what kind of spirit of
[14:11] compromise is around I want to be
[14:13] faithful to my Lord and and be better at
[14:16] that praise the Lord so now moving into
[14:18] this next phase we see Jesus spirit is
[14:21] troubled not only is he the only one who
[14:23] sees the next step that's coming and
[14:26] that is to end his life on Earth and to
[14:29] go to Calvary and he would go and carry
[14:32] uh every sin of the world on his
[14:35] shoulders and bear it and that includes
[14:37] your sin that includes my sin that
[14:40] includes every sin of the world so you
[14:42] can imagine someone's spirit being
[14:44] troubled because he's the only one there
[14:46] that really knows God knows that this is
[14:49] the next step he knows this is the next
[14:51] step Jesus knows this is where I'm
[14:53] headed within hours now this is what in
[14:55] the scripture proclaims of me but but
[14:57] can you imagine now bearing it alone
[14:59] he's the only one who knows
[15:01] he's the only one that sees it and so
[15:04] you know a lot of it he's bearing alone
[15:06] within himself so I would think that if
[15:09] you're headed to Calvary if you're
[15:10] headed to a Calvary bearing the sins of
[15:12] the world I would say that would be
[15:14] enough to trouble your spirit
[15:17] but but when we we take a look at this
[15:19] that would be enough pressure in his
[15:21] Spirit but to top it off
[15:23] to top it off now the scripture that
[15:26] says his spirit is troubled is tied with
[15:28] saying one of you shall betray me
[15:33] so on top of going to Calvary on top of
[15:36] bearing the sins of the world on top of
[15:38] the pressure of bearing that alone he's
[15:40] got one of his disciples sitting there
[15:42] and nobody knows it but he's fixing to
[15:44] betray him
[15:47] and I believe that's why his Spirit was
[15:49] troubled as well
[15:51] I believe it made it worse can you say
[15:54] Amen
[15:55] one of his own chosen disciples has made
[15:58] a deal secretly to betray him he has
[16:02] known it all along Jesus has known along
[16:04] and if you don't get anything else
[16:05] tonight just think about that a minute
[16:06] all the three and a half years of
[16:08] Ministry Jesus has known this from day
[16:11] one of of being with Judas yet he never
[16:15] exposed him he called he called Judas he
[16:19] sent him out to cast out devils and
[16:21] everything I'm saying I was going to
[16:22] read tonight to you but you know it if
[16:24] you know the scripture if not you can
[16:25] look it up Jesus caught Jesus called
[16:27] Judas as one of his disciples he sent
[16:31] him out to cast out Devils to heal the
[16:34] sick to raise the Dead
[16:38] he watched Judas as he shouted and he
[16:41] rejoiced and and they said when they
[16:43] come back casting out Devils they were
[16:45] all rejoicing they were shouting Jesus
[16:47] watched Judas and all the time he never
[16:49] said nothing he let him shout he let him
[16:52] rejoice and all the time he knows down
[16:53] the road where this boy is going
[16:56] but it's something interesting about
[16:58] Jesus that he didn't just jump on it
[17:00] even what he knew sometimes it's not
[17:02] wisdom to just jump on it can you say
[17:04] man sometimes you got to let it manifest
[17:07] itself
[17:10] and so he lets him go on he's rejoicing
[17:12] he's shouting and by the way I might say
[17:14] that to you is that just because
[17:15] somebody's shouting higher than you and
[17:17] somebody's dancing all over the building
[17:19] doesn't mean they have something real
[17:21] all the time sometimes it's real
[17:23] sometimes they're getting deliverance
[17:24] and sometimes they're just emotional and
[17:27] shouting because everybody else says but
[17:29] they're not getting anything
[17:30] I've talked to a lot of people who have
[17:32] shouted and screamed and did everything
[17:33] and when they walk out and you counsel
[17:35] with them there's no Deliverance yet
[17:37] there's nothing delivered yet can you
[17:39] say Amen so Jesus watch this in Judah
[17:42] says he shouted with the others but
[17:44] listen friends we want to have a
[17:45] substance can you say amount we want to
[17:48] have the real thing in our hearts
[17:50] and then when you got the real thing
[17:52] then shout then dance then Worship the
[17:54] Lord
[17:55] praise the Lord
[17:57] but he was able to watch this boy and
[17:59] watch him come along watch him
[18:01] fellowshipping with all the brothers on
[18:04] the boat Sea of Galilee watch him with
[18:06] all the rest the power of God come on
[18:08] him to cast out Devils fellowshipping
[18:11] with the rest of the brothers serving
[18:12] and working with handling the the
[18:15] whatever he did there and handling all
[18:17] the meetings of five thousand people
[18:19] serving as an usher whatever he did he
[18:21] watched him and then he watched him new
[18:24] one night he snuck away and he made a
[18:26] deal with all the church leaders the
[18:28] council to join them to come up against
[18:31] him and catch Jesus to catch him in
[18:34] something and Jesus knows all of this
[18:36] all the time and he holds it all within
[18:39] himself
[18:40] and lets him go on and my point tonight
[18:43] my point tonight to you there must have
[18:46] been something very much stronger in
[18:50] Jesus to know all of this
[18:53] and to endure It Whatever Jesus had
[18:57] to endure because remember Jesus said to
[19:00] us now about the end time he that shall
[19:03] endure to the end
[19:05] shall be saved
[19:07] there's an endurance but it's not an
[19:10] endurance in our own energy because I
[19:12] can't tell you we're not going to
[19:13] survive this the last day's Spirit we're
[19:16] not going to survive any of this but he
[19:18] had something that he could endure this
[19:21] intense pressure he could endure
[19:23] betrayal he could endure watching
[19:26] someone come along and and maybe
[19:28] mistreating or betrayal and especially
[19:30] at the end he could endure it and
[19:32] whatever Jesus had I want that tonight
[19:34] can you say amen I want to be able to
[19:37] act appropriately I want to be able to
[19:39] act in love because that's what I
[19:40] believe he had he had the Father's Love
[19:43] living within him and there's only one
[19:45] thing that can override betrayal in our
[19:48] lives and that's Divine love
[19:50] everybody has experienced betrayal
[19:54] isn't it amazing that our Lord did too
[19:57] no betrayal has been
[19:59] like Jesus betrayal and he stood alone
[20:02] betrayed by everybody
[20:05] how many has ever felt alone before
[20:07] your lord was alone more than anybody
[20:10] the whole world it seemed like was
[20:12] against him
[20:14] everything that moment when he went to
[20:16] Calvary he stood there alone by himself
[20:18] bearing the sins of the world he had no
[20:21] support he had no brothers and sisters
[20:24] around him he had no friends his own
[20:26] friend and he calls him that at the end
[20:29] he calls Judas he calls him friend even
[20:31] at the end these the ones that's closest
[20:33] to him and now they all run they all
[20:35] scatter and he stands there completely
[20:38] alone at the most pivotal point in
[20:41] history and he does it and there's no
[20:43] way ever a human being could do that
[20:45] except he's got God living with him and
[20:47] he's been baptized with the Divine love
[20:49] of God
[20:50] he's holding to the word can you say
[20:53] he's holding to the promise of God
[20:56] and that's why he could endure because
[20:58] there was something stronger in him to
[21:00] override the Betrayal might I say to you
[21:03] there's something stronger that you can
[21:05] have in your life that will override
[21:07] every betrayal that you've experienced
[21:09] can I get an amen tonight I'm here to
[21:12] preach you there's something stronger
[21:14] that can come in your life that will
[21:16] override and be stronger than any way
[21:19] that you have been betrayed
[21:20] it must have been something stronger
[21:23] in Jesus to know all of this and to
[21:26] endure it especially at this hour when
[21:29] his Spirit was troubled
[21:31] we can't endure anything unless God puts
[21:34] something in us to endure it
[21:36] I say we can't endure any of this
[21:39] we are we would react just like the
[21:42] world does
[21:44] right except God
[21:47] I like that term that song is heaven but
[21:49] it says but God
[21:52] we were lost but God
[21:55] we we didn't have any hope but God rich
[21:59] in Mercy but truth will prevail how many
[22:02] believe that the truth will come out you
[22:05] you it will no matter what we hide it
[22:09] will be exposed God never forgets unjust
[22:12] injustices that are done unless they're
[22:14] repented of if somebody repents that's
[22:16] when it's washed away but if there's
[22:18] been an injustice of any kind and it
[22:21] hasn't been repented of it's going to
[22:22] come back to haunt somebody someday
[22:25] God will take care of Injustice God will
[22:27] do it if you read the book of Psalms and
[22:29] David you certainly see that is that he
[22:31] talks a lot about his enemies he talks a
[22:34] lot about being persecuted David talks a
[22:36] lot about all these this that's against
[22:39] him and yet he kept really keeps
[22:41] releasing it to God releasing it to God
[22:43] saying I'm going to give it to him he's
[22:45] he's in control can you say Amen God
[22:49] will take care of it but the holy spirit
[22:50] is his nature
[22:52] he won't let you hide anything
[22:55] and he just brings it out and actually
[22:57] if people would mature and be know
[22:59] things that's the greatest thing that
[23:01] can happen to you
[23:03] whether it's bad or good Let It manifest
[23:05] let it come out even it's a bad desire
[23:08] God oh now I see my desires are wrong
[23:10] God you've got to change my desires
[23:13] if it was all hidden in here you don't
[23:14] know but when it's manifested maybe you
[23:16] have a sin maybe you do something all of
[23:18] a sudden it becomes public and
[23:19] everything well my goodness sometimes
[23:21] say oh I want to hide it I don't want it
[23:22] to be become public but sometimes God
[23:25] has to do that because it jolts you to
[23:27] say here it is you got to deal with it
[23:29] now you got to give it to me
[23:32] no the nature of the holy spirit is to
[23:34] to lovingly
[23:36] bring it to the surface
[23:39] so God never forgets no matter what we
[23:40] hide it would be exposed and what's in
[23:43] US truly will come out it may take years
[23:46] but it will come out and I don't mind if
[23:49] it's bad or good that comes out because
[23:51] the truth sets you free
[23:54] being betrayed may be the worst pain
[23:58] that happens in our spirit Jesus Spirit
[24:01] was troubled there's one of you should
[24:03] that betray me and his Spirit was very
[24:06] troubled by it
[24:08] being betrayed I think affects human
[24:11] beings
[24:12] in the worst pain sometimes
[24:16] betrayal means to break Trust
[24:19] to let down somebody let you down
[24:23] to break one's promise that means
[24:25] someone broke their promise
[24:27] to be disloyal and it actually means to
[24:30] deceive you know first of all I think of
[24:32] Judas and all those things
[24:34] to let down to break one's promise to be
[24:36] disloyal to break trust and to deceive
[24:39] because that's what Judas did there was
[24:41] a deception to us but see when you're on
[24:43] the other end of betrayal now it does
[24:45] not feel good
[24:47] when you've been the one who's betrayed
[24:49] somebody you have to repent you have to
[24:51] make it right
[24:52] but I'm talking about the ones are on
[24:54] this end of being betrayed being let
[24:56] down someone's broken their promise and
[24:59] guess what guess what because we're
[25:01] human beings don't ever think that in
[25:03] some fictitious World we'll live in this
[25:05] world and never be betrayed
[25:08] amen
[25:09] it's it's human beings you're going to
[25:11] be betrayed people are going to break
[25:13] promises and he uh
[25:18] he's there three and a half years
[25:19] knowing
[25:21] Judas
[25:23] and he leaves it alone
[25:28] he never treated Judas any different
[25:33] and he knew what he was
[25:36] anybody listening just don't don't turn
[25:39] the channel off yet I was still there
[25:42] he was with Judas and knew all this for
[25:44] three and a half years and he never
[25:45] treated treated Judas different than the
[25:47] rest of believers
[25:49] so much so the disciples could never
[25:51] detect
[25:53] anything indifferent in treatment
[25:55] he could have added attitude toward
[25:57] Judas and the disciples pick up on
[25:58] everybody Lord I noticed you got a
[26:00] little attitude towards Judas sometimes
[26:01] what's going on
[26:03] that night they didn't know who it was
[26:06] Judas is acting out something he's being
[26:08] a hypocrite Jesus is letting it alone he
[26:10] never treated treated judicity different
[26:15] and at the end when they come to the
[26:17] garden and the Bible says Judas is
[26:20] standing with the soldiers he's standing
[26:22] with them instead of with Jesus after
[26:24] three and a half years he stood with his
[26:26] disciples through everything
[26:28] and now he's standing with the soldiers
[26:30] against him that's some people that have
[26:32] exited this truth
[26:35] who are you standing with
[26:40] and he he comes over I'm closing he
[26:43] comes over and he grabs Jesus and he
[26:45] kisses him Judas kisses him
[26:48] as a sign
[26:49] to show them he's the one but yet he
[26:51] would go so far as to give something
[26:53] that's it's a kind of a close intimate
[26:57] friendship thing to kiss someone right
[27:00] Embrace him kisses him that was a sign
[27:04] but it just it reminds me sometimes of
[27:06] people that have completely turned
[27:08] against you and they just give you a big
[27:10] hug and everything's okay and it's all
[27:11] phony
[27:14] Judas
[27:15] they're not being real
[27:17] it's a Judas kiss
[27:19] but
[27:21] talk about a moment to be angry
[27:23] it's like why is he kissing me
[27:26] why is he greeting me this way
[27:29] and here's his response even now
[27:32] friend
[27:35] called him friend
[27:37] where have you been
[27:41] maybe his convicting say why are you
[27:43] with these guys well he knew why he was
[27:45] with them but friend
[27:47] why is he calling him friend
[27:50] because he has something greater in him
[27:53] than Judas ever had
[27:55] that's the only way he could do that
[27:58] something stronger than Jesus and
[28:01] whatever he has I want more of it
[28:04] tonight
[28:05] I want more of it tonight
