[15:39] Why should I worry?
[15:43] Why should I fear
[15:46] when the very same Jesus
[15:51] stays always near?
[15:55] He lives in my heart
[15:58] and he hears when I cry.
[16:03] I'll call on his name till the storm
[16:07] passes by. Sing that again. So why
[16:11] should I worry?
[16:15] Why should I fear
[16:18] when the very same Jesus
[16:22] stays always near?
[16:26] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[16:32] cry.
[16:34] I'll call on his name till the storm
[16:38] passes by. First verse out on the water.
[16:45] The storms raging high.
[16:49] The waters around
[16:52] them were troubled that night.
[16:57] Fear filled their hearts and they
[17:00] thought they would die.
[17:04] They failed to remember
[17:08] that the masses all stand in this next
[17:10] part. He spoke and he spoke the word
[17:16] and the winds all stood still.
[17:20] Even the waters
[17:23] they obey his will
[17:27] and he calms the stor
[17:31] just like he will mind
[17:35] if I just remember
[17:38] that he lives deep inside. So why should
[17:44] I worry?
[17:47] Why should I fear?
[17:50] When the very same Jesus,
[17:54] he stays always here.
[17:58] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[18:03] cry. Hallelujah. I'll call on his name
[18:08] till the storm passes by.
[18:12] We read in the Bible
[18:16] how he walked with him
[18:20] brought light to the darkness
[18:24] when the way so dim.
[18:28] How great it would be to have a steps
[18:32] leading mine
[18:35] and to walk with the master
[18:39] all the time.
[18:42] So when trials come
[18:46] and death is so near,
[18:50] I just search for the master.
[18:54] He said we'll be there
[18:57] time in all trouble
[19:01] and my body in pain.
[19:05] All I have to do is call on his name.
[19:12] So why should I worry?
[19:15] [Music]
[19:16] Why should I fear
[19:19] when the very same Jesus
[19:24] stays always here?
[19:27] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[19:32] cry.
[19:34] I call on his name till the storm pass.
[19:40] Last time why should I? Why should I
[19:44] worry?
[19:46] Why should I fear
[19:49] when the very same Jesus
[19:53] stays always near?
[19:57] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[20:02] cry.
[20:04] I'll call on his name till the storm
[20:09] passes by.
[20:14] My s Savior,
[20:20] Savior.
[20:25] That's a prayer request would come. Hear
[20:28] my
[20:29] humble
[20:32] cry.
[20:37] And while
[20:40] on others thou are calling.
[20:48] This is my prayer Lord. Oh do
[20:53] not pass me
[20:57] by.
[20:59] Last time crying Savior. Crying saveior.
[21:09] [Music]
[21:13] Oh, hear
[21:16] my
[21:18] humble
[21:21] cry.
[21:25] And while
[21:29] on others thou
[21:32] are called.
[21:34] [Music]
[21:39] God bless you tonight. Uh yeah. So, like
[21:41] Gideon said, um I'm still here. Uh I've
[21:45] been to the airport several times and
[21:46] this last time they're like because of
[21:49] weather and stuff in Chicago, they keep
[21:50] turning us around and everything is very
[21:52] delayed. And I just she was going on the
[21:55] computer and looking for a flight for
[21:56] me. And I'm like, I just need to get
[21:58] home. And I just felt in my heart just,
[22:02] you know, just go with it. Like the Lord
[22:04] was just giving me peace. And I just
[22:07] felt strong like this is for a reason.
[22:09] And right as I was kind of feeling that
[22:11] way, she's like, "Well, there's probably
[22:13] a reason for all this." And I felt that
[22:15] that was a confirmation of what the Lord
[22:17] was saying to me in my heart. And then
[22:18] and then she followed up by saying,
[22:19] "This is a airport lady, not even a
[22:21] Christian." She's like, "It looks like
[22:22] you're supposed to be in church." So
[22:25] we're I was going to sing uh because he
[22:28] lives, but Gideon already sang it. So um
[22:31] let's sing that song I Claim the Blood.
[22:33] Let's do uh B flat. And can we just do
[22:35] organ to start and then you guys join
[22:37] in?

[22:50] of strength when I am weak.
[22:56] [Music]
[22:59] that takes me through
[23:04] when life is pressing
[23:08] me.
[23:12] Oh, I have a source
[23:17] of power
[23:19] from
[23:20] above.
[23:21] [Music]

[23:30] by a shield of blood.
[23:36] Let's sing it. I claim the blood
[23:41] Jesus shed on Calary.
[23:49] Those precious blood stains
[23:54] were made there just for me.
[24:01] For all my sin,
[24:05] my sickness, and my pain.
[24:12] When I need healing,
[24:15] I claim those precious blood stains.
[24:22] And I do not know
[24:26] how others make it through.
[24:31] [Music]
[24:33] You never go
[24:37] to Calary as I do
[24:43] for there's a hill
[24:47] link landing stream which flows
[24:53] with peace that only
[24:57] his redeemed can Oh,

[26:41] the Lord. There's a source tonight.
[26:43] Amen. Hallelujah. Claim it. Praise the
[26:46] Lord. Let's sing this song as our
[26:48] brother Brandon would come. This is your
[26:50] house. Let's all stand together and sing
[26:52] it. Praise God.
[26:55] Dedicate
[26:57] this temple to you, Lord.

[27:18] peace. people.
[27:22] Lord, we agree
[27:28] in unity.
[27:30] Tell them now that this is your house.
[27:36] Father, come and dwell.
[27:41] Your house.
[27:45] Oh, a holy house of prayer
[27:50] where the lost and the lonely
[27:54] bring their burdens and their care.
[27:59] This is your house.
[28:02] Oh, this is your house.
[28:08] Come and dwell.
[28:14] Amen. and God bless you this evening.
[28:17] And
[28:20] if you want to be opening to Acts
[28:22] chapter 3 and verse 19,
[28:25] just one quick announcement. Um we're
[28:27] going to have prayer for the young kids
[28:30] going back to school on this Sunday. So
[28:33] if you'd like to participate in that,
[28:35] bring your kids.
[28:39] God bless you. I hope everyone's doing
[28:40] well tonight. Looks like we've had quite
[28:42] a few out for uh sickness. Um or word
[28:45] got out that I was preaching tonight,
[28:47] but those were last minute things. So, I
[28:49] don't think that was it.
[28:52] God bless you this evening. Acts uh
[28:55] 3:19.
[29:00] Repent ye therefore and be converted
[29:02] that your sins may be blotted out when
[29:04] the times of refreshing shall come from
[29:07] the presence of the Lord. And he shall
[29:09] send Jesus Christ, which before was
[29:11] preached unto you, whom the heaven must
[29:14] receive until the times of restitution
[29:17] of all things, which God has spoken by
[29:19] the mouth of all his holy prophets since
[29:22] the world began. Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[29:25] we ask you to bless your word tonight.
[29:27] Father, I pray that you'd help us each,
[29:29] Lord, to get out of the way and that you
[29:32] have your preeminence. I just pray you'd
[29:34] speak to your people and edify them this
[29:36] evening. take this thought you've placed
[29:38] on my heart, Lord, and I just pray you'd
[29:40] put your words in my mouth in Jesus
[29:42] name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[29:49] There's a couple couple things in this
[29:51] set of scripture that I want to look at
[29:53] that's been on my heart and um is just
[29:56] the word the word refreshing, the times
[29:58] of refreshing. And that that statement's
[30:01] been going through my mind, times of
[30:03] refreshing. when the times of refreshing
[30:05] come and we find that the word
[30:06] refreshing here means to refresh to cool
[30:09] off from the heat and actually one of
[30:12] the definitions of the word is revival
[30:14] it's revival and so the times of
[30:16] refreshing come from the Holy Spirit and
[30:19] they come when when we can have revival
[30:21] and it refreshes us and and then we find
[30:25] the restitution of all things which is
[30:27] to restore to perfect state before the
[30:29] fall
[30:31] &gt;&gt; it's restoration to a perfect state,
[30:33] which that perfect state looks back
[30:35] before the fall. And so, just kind of
[30:38] put linking these two together is
[30:40] there's there's a restoration that comes
[30:42] that's been promised for our day. And I
[30:44] believe that that restoration when it
[30:46] comes when it when it came, it it brings
[30:49] refreshing to us. And and not only was
[30:52] it just a just a a refreshing when it
[30:54] when it came at the time it came with
[30:56] the prophet on the scene, but I believe
[30:58] God gives us time of refreshing uh all
[31:01] throughout our Christian journey. And so
[31:02] that's the direction I want to go this
[31:04] evening. One thing that I noticed when I
[31:07] was we were going through Job is is God
[31:10] restores a double double uh portion to
[31:12] Job at the latter end of his life. And
[31:15] uh Job 42:12 says, "So the Lord blessed
[31:18] the latter end of Job more than his
[31:20] beginning. For he had 14,000 sheep and
[31:23] 6,000 camels and a thousand yolk of oxen
[31:26] and a thousand sheasses. He had also
[31:28] seven sons and three daughters." Now,
[31:30] this is this just caught my attention
[31:32] here. Not not only is Job receiving a
[31:35] double double portion, that his trial is
[31:37] coming to an end. He's God's restoring
[31:39] and and you know, Job could rejoice in
[31:42] that. But what's interesting here is
[31:44] he's he's given seven sons and three
[31:46] daughters again. But for some reason
[31:48] this time, the scripture actually spells
[31:51] out the name of the daughters. And I'm
[31:53] I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
[31:54] this. I just thought it was it caught my
[31:56] attention. So, and he called the name of
[31:58] the first um I'm going to pronounce
[32:00] these completely wrong. Uh Jamaima, and
[32:02] the name of the second, Kesia, and the
[32:04] name of the third, Karen Hep. And in the
[32:08] land where no women found so fair as the
[32:10] daughters of Job, and their fathers gave
[32:13] them inheritance among their brethren.
[32:15] After this lived Job in 140 years, and
[32:18] saw his sons and his sons sons, even
[32:20] four generations. So Job died being old
[32:23] and full of days. So, it wasn't just
[32:25] that God gave him anything in
[32:28] particular. I mean, you have all these
[32:30] camels and all the things that Job was
[32:32] given. And yet, there's there's
[32:33] something he's he's there's an emphasis
[32:36] on on his children. There's an emphasis
[32:38] on his daughters. There's an emphasis on
[32:41] his grandchildren.
[32:43] And and uh just and I believe that
[32:46] there's we can start looking that and
[32:48] and picking it apart and saying, "Well,
[32:49] where's the real refreshment that Job
[32:51] receives? Was it from all the things or
[32:54] was it from the relationships? And and I
[32:57] want to take it even a bit further. And
[32:58] and was it was it all the things? Was it
[33:01] the restoration of things? What if God
[33:03] didn't do that? But yet Job came out of
[33:06] this trial and he knew God in a deeper
[33:08] way in ways that he didn't know him
[33:10] before. And so we'll get to that a
[33:12] little bit more in a minute. But but I
[33:14] believe it was it was it was God
[33:16] refreshing him after this great trial.
[33:19] And and I believe that this this points
[33:22] to something that we receive in God is
[33:24] and and I'm not going to spend a lot of
[33:25] time on trials either, but you know,
[33:27] when we go through trials and and
[33:28] tribulations, there's a refreshing time
[33:30] that comes after it. And I believe that
[33:32] even through that, if if the trial isn't
[33:35] done, if it isn't over, then God gives
[33:37] us times of refreshing all through it to
[33:40] keep us going, to keep us sane. Amen.
[33:43] But look how look how look how low he
[33:45] got the the the the the first time and
[33:47] and how he questioned God and and and
[33:51] then you know just this refreshment
[33:53] knowing God in ways he didn't before.
[33:55] Job 19:25 to 27 for I know my redeemer
[33:59] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[34:01] latter day upon the earth. And though
[34:03] the after my skin worms destroy this
[34:06] body, yet in my flesh shall I see God,
[34:08] whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes
[34:11] shall behold and not another. Though my
[34:14] though my reigns be consumed within me.
[34:16] So Job is getting is is getting um a a a
[34:21] a vision of the restitution of all
[34:24] things through Christ. He's seeing
[34:25] Christ. I know my redeemer lives. And
[34:28] that's the refreshing that's coming to
[34:30] him in the middle of this. And then Job
[34:32] 42 1-6 then Job answered the Lord and
[34:35] said well first of all Job gets he he
[34:38] receives word from the Lord he he
[34:40] receives a a messenger from the Lord
[34:42] Eliu we remember but he also receives
[34:45] direct contact with God and that direct
[34:48] contact this is the end then Job
[34:50] answered the Lord and said I know that
[34:52] thou can't do everything what a
[34:55] refreshing to the spirit of Job through
[34:57] this is that through all of this
[34:59] hardship I know that there's nothing you
[35:02] can't do. He says that uh uh uh I know
[35:06] that there's nothing and and no thought
[35:08] can be withholden from thee. Who is he
[35:11] that hideth counsel without knowledge?
[35:13] Therefore have I uttered that I
[35:15] understood not things too wonderful for
[35:17] me which I knew not. Here I beseech
[35:20] thee, and I will speak, I will demand of
[35:22] thee, and declare thou unto me. I have
[35:24] heard of thee by hearing of the ear, but
[35:27] now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I
[35:30] abhore myself and repent and dust and
[35:32] ashes. Job could come through this and
[35:35] he knew God by a headn knowledge. But he
[35:37] comes through this and he says, "But now
[35:39] my spirit, I'm refreshed. I'm refreshed
[35:42] in God because I I I once I I heard you,
[35:46] but now I see you. I know you in a
[35:48] deeper way." And it was refreshment to
[35:51] Job. And so I'm I'm bringing you tonight
[35:53] that there's there's a refreshment when
[35:55] God reveals himself to us that's
[35:57] refreshing to our souls.
[36:01] This revelation of Job is so great at
[36:03] the end of the book. And and and I don't
[36:06] know the reasons why his daughters are
[36:07] mentioned. I could speculate a little
[36:10] bit, but I don't want to do that too
[36:11] much other than just a couple things
[36:13] here, points on it, because I I do want
[36:15] to encourage our sisters a little bit
[36:16] here, too. But Job the revelation was so
[36:19] great that he names the names of his
[36:21] daughters are spelled out. His sons
[36:23] aren't named but his daughters are. Now
[36:26] daughters he's also he also says they
[36:29] were given an inheritance but in those
[36:30] days the daughter was not given an
[36:33] inheritance unless there was no brother
[36:35] to receive it. Then it could go to her.
[36:38] And there was actually that that became
[36:40] law in the book of Moses because there
[36:42] was a man who died and he had no sons
[36:45] and his daughters came to Moses and she
[36:47] said, "Hey, there's no there's no man to
[36:50] take this. What what about us?" Moses
[36:53] says, "Hold on. I got to go talk to God
[36:55] about this." He goes and talks to God
[36:57] and God says, "You know what? They're
[36:59] actually speaking right. Give them and
[37:01] make write this down as a law." So this
[37:03] this gave the daughters of God a part in
[37:06] the inheritance. Now that that was old
[37:09] testament that was something natural.
[37:11] But his daughters are given an
[37:12] inheritance among their brothers. It was
[37:15] rare for that day. But then even their
[37:17] names come out and bring out what I
[37:19] believe. Job sees Christ. He my I know
[37:22] my redeemer lives. Now just watch this a
[37:24] minute. I might be going out a little
[37:26] limb here, but I don't think I am. Uh
[37:28] now the one I called Jamaima was is
[37:30] actually Yamima.
[37:32] I thought mima
[37:35] means dove and peace. A dove is a is is
[37:39] peace. The next one is kito quesia which
[37:43] is a fragrant incense. It's expensive.
[37:45] It's rare. It's beautiful. And that was
[37:48] actually one of the incense that was
[37:49] brought to Christ at his birth by the w
[37:52] or when when the wise men came to him.
[37:55] Karen hap hapuk is means a horn of
[37:58] adornment. We know that a horn means
[38:00] strength in the scripture. And that that
[38:03] word hapuk is is actually paint. It's a
[38:05] cosmetic. But uh one thing that kept
[38:08] coming out as I was trying to research
[38:10] this a little bit um was in particular
[38:12] is the color red. And the red for the
[38:14] blood of Christ. It's a it's a outward
[38:16] beauty that comes from an inward
[38:18] character is the meaning of her name. So
[38:20] the ending of Job's trial brought peace,
[38:23] a beautiful fragrance from inward
[38:25] character growth. And that and and then
[38:28] he names his daughter these things. So,
[38:31] Job 1 emphasizes the sons, but at the
[38:33] end it it it focuses more on the
[38:36] daughters. And I just thought I thought
[38:38] of the daughters of Zion, a beautiful
[38:40] branch to the Lord, a bride adorned for
[38:43] her husband. She's made ready. It's it's
[38:45] all about the bride of Christ. And so,
[38:47] at the end of Job, this revelation
[38:50] that's coming forth is all about these
[38:52] daughters. Is all about the women. Is
[38:54] all about, you say, the church, the
[38:56] bride, the Christ. Over in the New
[38:58] Testament, we find Peter giving the wise
[39:01] marriage counsel. 1 Peter 3:7,
[39:03] "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them
[39:05] according to knowledge, giving honor
[39:07] unto the wife as under the weaker
[39:09] vessel." Oh, we stop there. Well, the
[39:11] weaker vessel. But he goes on and he
[39:13] says, "It is being heirs together of the
[39:15] grace of life that your prayers be not
[39:17] hindered." So Peter's bringing this
[39:20] marriage council out that brothers, you
[39:21] can't just walk all over her. This is a
[39:23] daughter of a king. She has the same
[39:26] rights to God as you do.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; And and she's a daughter of the king. We
[39:30] ought to treat her like a daughter of
[39:32] the king.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; So I just I just thought this was just
[39:36] something beautiful coming out of Job.
[39:38] Just this this revelation is just just
[39:40] seems to be everywhere in him. And and
[39:43] and that's the refreshment I believe
[39:45] that Job received. I noticed how after
[39:48] God revealed himself to the children of
[39:50] Israel as Jehovah Rafa, then in Exodus
[39:54] 15:27, it says they came to um Eilim
[39:58] where uh where were 12 wells of water
[40:00] and three score and 10 palm trees and
[40:02] they encamped there by the waters. Now
[40:05] there's there's just something that
[40:06] keeps coming up when you're talking
[40:08] about refreshing that you can't you
[40:10] can't get away from this tie with water.
[40:13] And so here they're they're they've got
[40:15] shade. It was it was after their trial
[40:17] and God revealed one of his attributes
[40:19] to them. Catch now the thought the
[40:22] revelation God revealed himself to them
[40:25] to to to that they rested in a place of
[40:27] refreshment out of the sun under these
[40:30] palms near the sources of water and
[40:33] there was there was there's 12 tribes
[40:35] and there's 12 wells. There's plenty of
[40:37] water for all who thirst.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Come unto me all who are weary and heavy
[40:42] laden and I will give you rest.
[40:46] What's what's that rest? What's the rest
[40:48] in the scripture is the Holy Spirit. God
[40:50] will give us his Holy Spirit. But I
[40:52] don't believe that it's just a one-time
[40:55] filling. I believe we need refreshing in
[40:57] this life. Many refillings. We need God.
[41:00] I I'm I'm weary this evening. I need a
[41:02] refreshment from you.
[41:05] In John 7 uh 37:38, if any man thirst,
[41:09] let him come to me and drink. If we
[41:11] drink from him, out of out of the
[41:13] innermost being shall flow rivers of
[41:16] living water. He's He's a living
[41:18] fountain. He He and And this is brother
[41:21] Brandham speaking. He to me is that
[41:23] fountain that saved Hagar's life and the
[41:25] child when they were dying in the
[41:27] wilderness. I believe he's the rock in
[41:29] Isaiah 32. He's the rock in a weary
[41:32] land. He's the shelter in the time of
[41:34] storm. When when they were in the
[41:36] wilderness, he struck the rock. He was
[41:38] the rock that water came out of and and
[41:41] and gave them refreshment for their for
[41:44] their weariness.
[41:46] Zechariah 13, he's the fountain that
[41:48] opens in the house of David for sin. And
[41:52] Psalms 36:9, he's David's fountain of
[41:54] life. He's the still waters of David.
[41:57] He's the green pastures. He's he's the
[42:00] water by the brookside for David.
[42:02] Remember he says, "Though I walk through
[42:04] the valley of the shadow of death, I'll
[42:06] fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy
[42:08] rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
[42:11] That's the scripture. They leadth me
[42:13] into green pastures. It's the
[42:15] refreshment for for his soul.
[42:18] Genesis 17, he's Abraham's nursing
[42:20] breast, El Shadi. But when his life was
[42:23] gone from him, a a man 100 years old,
[42:26] how will this thing be? His wife old, he
[42:29] said, I am El Shadi, the breasted one.
[42:32] uh like a baby. Now watch this. The baby
[42:34] that's fretting and it's sick and its
[42:37] strength is gone from it. Lean upon the
[42:39] mother's bosom and nurse its strength
[42:41] back. Sure. Not only when it's nursing,
[42:43] it isn't fretting no more. At the
[42:46] mother's breast, it's satisfied while
[42:48] it's getting its strength. That what
[42:50] caught me is that that fretting. If
[42:52] you're fretting, you're not resting.
[42:53] You're not you're not refreshing. You're
[42:56] worrying. And and and and worrying
[42:59] brings wearying. Yes.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Worrying brings wearing. We get weary
[43:03] when we when we're worrying. When we're
[43:05] not we're not refreshed. We're we're
[43:07] we're we're we're nervous. We're worked
[43:10] up. We we we can't settle ourselves.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; We need a refreshing.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:18] So, if you're fretting tonight,
[43:21] &gt;&gt; he's Jehovah Shalom.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And I just want to look at that just a
[43:25] minute. Jehovah Shalom is is one of the
[43:27] redemptive names of Jehovah. It means
[43:29] the Lord is our peace.
[43:32] The Lord is our peace. Judges 6 and 23
[43:35] and 24 and I'll just reference it.
[43:37] Gideon was afraid and he's and he's
[43:40] hiding. This is the story of Gideon.
[43:42] This is when God Jehovah reveals himself
[43:45] as as I'll be your peace is Gideon and
[43:49] and it's a time of persecution and
[43:51] they're that they're they're under heavy
[43:53] attack and they they can't seem to to
[43:55] get what God has promised them. the
[43:58] enemy comes and takes their grain and
[43:59] and it and you know just seems like that
[44:02] the enemy is always trying to take their
[44:03] revelation,
[44:05] but Gideon is down by the wine press,
[44:07] you know, the story, and the angel comes
[44:09] to him and things and and Gideon, I just
[44:11] thought Gideon was afraid and he's
[44:13] drowning in his own complexes. Right?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; He just the whole thing, his whole
[44:18] speech back to the angel of the Lord was
[44:20] was, "Well, I'm this and my family's
[44:22] this and we're lowly and this and that
[44:24] and and you know, but the angel saying,
[44:26] but that's not how God sees you.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Your name in the book says you're a
[44:30] mighty man of valor."
[44:32] &gt;&gt; But an encounter and and and a word from
[44:35] the Lord brought him peace to where he
[44:37] he he calls the place Jehovah Shalom.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; The prince the the prince of peace. God
[44:43] is the prince of peace. Jesus Christ is
[44:47] Psalms 23:4.
[44:50] Let's just read Psalms 23.
[44:56] It's short.
[45:03] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[45:05] want. He maketh me to lie down in green
[45:07] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[45:10] waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth
[45:14] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[45:17] name's sake. Yay, though I walk through
[45:19] the valley of the shadow of death, I
[45:21] will fear no evil, for thou art with me,
[45:23] thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[45:26] Thou preparest a table before me in the
[45:28] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[45:30] my head with oil. My cup runth over. He
[45:33] anoints his head with oil. What's oil in
[45:36] the scripture is is the spirit of God.
[45:38] He anoints my head with with He anoints
[45:41] us with his spirit. My cup runth over.
[45:44] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[45:46] me all the days of my life. And I will
[45:48] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[45:51] Why does David want to dwell in the
[45:53] house of the Lord forever? Because
[45:54] that's refreshing in his is in his
[45:56] presence.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalms 23:4, we we you know,
[46:02] thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[46:05] Well, what's a rod for? Spare the rod,
[46:07] spoil the child. Right? What's the rod
[46:09] for? It's it's it's proddding the sheep,
[46:12] but it's also protecting the sheep. So,
[46:15] you could say he took our he he it it's
[46:17] it's Jehovah shalom. The Lord is our
[46:20] peace. His direction, his correction,
[46:23] his protection brings us peace. Isaiah
[46:27] 53:5, he took our chastening so we could
[46:30] have peace. Isaiah 26:3, he gives us
[46:33] perfect peace when our mind is stayed on
[46:36] him. If you if you're fretting, going
[46:38] back to fretting, if you're fretting,
[46:41] just let your mind be stayed on him.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; When we trust in him, we trust in him.
[46:47] The scripture says you can have perfect
[46:49] peace. And and listen, I know when when
[46:52] things are when when our mind is
[46:53] spinning, it's sometimes it's hard to
[46:55] catch your mind and and and bring it
[46:57] into subjection. But I believe that if
[47:00] the scripture says that bringing every
[47:01] thought subject to the obedience of
[47:03] Jesus Christ, if he says that you can be
[47:06] in perfect peace and I'll keep your mind
[47:08] and your heart, then there it has to be
[47:10] possible. God wouldn't God wouldn't
[47:12] dangle a carrot out in front of us and
[47:14] say, "Well, keep your mind in perfect
[47:16] peace." when we know that this world is
[47:18] keeping our mind all stirred up and
[47:20] we're and and it's just a time of
[47:21] anxiety and and and it's just the world
[47:24] we live in and it's fast-paced and and I
[47:26] want to get to some things in a minute
[47:28] and I just thought, but God, how do we
[47:30] how do we do that in this age? Talks
[47:32] about the cool of the morning and the
[47:34] dew and enjoying it. And I thought,
[47:36] well, but I mean, I literally you get in
[47:38] your truck and you go and you flying
[47:41] down the highway because you're getting
[47:43] run off the road otherwise. And and I
[47:45] just thought, where's the enjoyment? But
[47:47] there has to be if God says you can keep
[47:51] your mind in perfect peace. There has to
[47:54] be a perfect peace in your mind, that's
[47:56] possible.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; God doesn't do that to that would be a
[48:00] cruel father.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; God doesn't do things that way. So it
[48:05] has to be possible.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; John 14:27, he gave us his peace as he
[48:11] went to Calvary. Not as the world give I
[48:14] uh uh not as the world I give you my
[48:17] peace. Not the peace of the world. The
[48:19] peace of the world fades away. It
[48:21] doesn't last long before you have to
[48:23] find something else for your peace.
[48:25] Before you have to find something else
[48:27] for your comfort. That's why you know
[48:29] you you'll hear us say you got to what
[48:31] are you turning to for your comfort?
[48:32] What are you looking for for peace? What
[48:34] are you turning to when you want
[48:36] refreshing for your soul? Because it
[48:39] it's okay to watch a little something.
[48:41] And it's okay to, you know, enjoy things
[48:43] that are in this world, a little
[48:46] vacation or something, but but it's it's
[48:48] if you if you're constantly going to
[48:50] those things or if you're turning to the
[48:52] wrong things in those times, you're
[48:54] going to you you your spirit can't isn't
[48:57] actually it actually makes your spirit
[48:59] fret more. It makes your spirit more
[49:02] anxious. So, we have to go to the right
[49:04] source for our peace. Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Philippians 4:6-7, "Don't be anxious,
[49:10] but give everything to him in prayer and
[49:12] seeking him, asking him about it,
[49:15] &gt;&gt; giving him thanksgiving." This is my own
[49:17] words. Letting him know what our request
[49:20] is, our desire, our heart. God wants to
[49:23] know your heart.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And he and he and he trades all of your
[49:27] worry with peace, which passes all
[49:30] understanding.
[49:32] Peace so powerful that it keeps our
[49:34] hearts and our minds through Christ.
[49:36] That's that's attainable.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; That's possible.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; That's and that and that is for you.
[49:44] Everyone say that's for me.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; That's for me.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; That's for me.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Some of you aren't moving your lips.
[49:50] That's 100% participation, please.
[49:53] That's for me.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; That's for me.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. That's true.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; But you see you see that now I'm not
[50:00] going to I'm not I'm not criticizing
[50:02] you, but I'm just saying why why didn't
[50:04] you speak it?
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Is it because is it because we're tired?
[50:08] I get it. Or is it because you don't
[50:10] believe it?
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Because I'm telling you that's for you.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; So So listen, cast down the negative
[50:18] thoughts.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Cast away, like brother Paul was saying
[50:22] Sunday, cast away the negativity from
[50:24] your lips. And and when you're feeling
[50:26] weary, when you're feeling burdened,
[50:28] when you're feeling like your mind is
[50:30] just spinning and spinning, start
[50:32] speaking word. Start speaking. But go
[50:37] tell God, "Brother Brandon gave me
[50:39] permission that I can claim this for
[50:41] myself.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; If you've got any confidence in me,
[50:45] forget me. It's the word of God. Speak
[50:48] the word of God
[50:50] &gt;&gt; that you it is for you. Speak those
[50:52] things.
[50:54] Worrying is not refreshing. Like I said,
[50:56] worrying causes wearying.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It there's no merit to worrying.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; It it it can it can actually drive worry
[51:05] can actually be used to drive us to God,
[51:08] but that's where we cast our cares upon
[51:10] him because he cares for you. And then
[51:12] you leave it there.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; But it can cause us to get in his way,
[51:15] too. If we're not bringing it to God,
[51:18] then we can act out of our worry and
[51:20] make the situation worse.
[51:23] There's no merit. I was thinking there's
[51:25] no merit to worrying. You don't get an
[51:27] award for worrying.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; You don't get to the end of the road and
[51:31] get a medal.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; There's no medal for worrying.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; It must be possible. In fact, you get a
[51:38] crown of gold
[51:40] &gt;&gt; when you cast your cares upon him.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; It must be possible to cast our cares
[51:45] upon him because the scripture says,
[51:47] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah."
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another thing that doesn't refresh
[51:51] us, I'm just going to list a couple
[51:52] things that came to my mind. Another
[51:54] thing that doesn't refresh us, staying
[51:56] outside the presence of God. Our opening
[51:58] scripture said times of refreshing that
[52:01] come from the presence of God. So if you
[52:03] want to see receive times of refreshing,
[52:05] then you have to be where his presence
[52:07] is.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; We we have to be in his presence.
[52:11] Staying away from church and where the
[52:13] body is is not refreshing. Right.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; We're to assemble ourselves the more as
[52:19] the time as the end time approaches. If
[52:21] we say we believe we're closer, now this
[52:24] is this is what got me as I was thinking
[52:26] about this. If we say we believe we're
[52:28] closer than we've ever been and then
[52:30] stay away from church and the things
[52:32] that the church is doing, I'm not so
[52:34] sure that you really believe we're
[52:36] closer than we've ever been.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Because if you really believe
[52:41] that, then you would follow what the
[52:42] scripture says and you would assemble
[52:44] yourselves all together all the more.
[52:46] One time Jonah ran from the presence of
[52:48] God and it caused a great storm that
[52:51] affected those around him negatively.
[52:54] He ran from the presence of God and you
[52:57] remember the storm rose up and they
[52:59] said, "What is this?" And he said, "It's
[53:00] me. Throw me over." Soon as they got rid
[53:03] of rid of him, the storm stopped. All
[53:06] right.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Jonah caused the storm
[53:08] &gt;&gt; running from the presence of God and it
[53:10] affected that's what that's the key. It
[53:12] affected those around him.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Cain went out from the presence of God
[53:17] and created his own way of doing things.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; What did that create? It brought death
[53:23] &gt;&gt; and it brought weariness.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; He created civilization. And what's
[53:28] what's it bring us? We get weary.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; It's true. That's true.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve went out from the presence
[53:35] of God and since then has been sorrow
[53:38] and putting on religion rather than
[53:40] getting the real thing.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; And when you put religion on, you're not
[53:44] refreshed.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; It's not refreshing.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes sometimes now we can go from I
[53:51] was just thinking about something
[53:52] brother Paul's always taught taught me.
[53:54] Sometimes we can go from event to event
[53:56] to event. And even though we're going
[53:59] where the presence of God is, we're not
[54:02] really refreshing ourselves.
[54:04] You have to get refreshment for
[54:06] yourself. It could be we're we're just
[54:08] simply so busy that we're not slowing
[54:10] down enough to receive the refreshing in
[54:12] those times.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; We're we're giving out, but we're not
[54:16] receiving in.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; We have to make sure we're refreshing
[54:20] ourselves in the Lord.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Now, what refreshes us? I put this in
[54:29] because of this past weekend and I
[54:31] thought it was it was real good. And if
[54:33] you want to want to read a little more
[54:34] of what brother Brandham says about
[54:36] music,
[54:38] it's in this it's in the message life
[54:40] and 58
[54:42] uh May 12th. And he says that's real joy
[54:44] to my heart and I was so glad to refresh
[54:47] myself in the presence of that good
[54:50] singing tonight.
[54:53] I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
[54:55] It's It's the music's too loud. I don't
[54:57] like the songs they sing. That church,
[54:59] they you know, the way Ike plays the
[55:02] drums is just offensive.
[55:06] I don't see them, so I I guess I could
[55:07] say that freely.
[55:10] But I just thought it was good. That's
[55:11] amazing. The it it refreshes myself in
[55:14] the presence of that good singing.
[55:17] For all who worked to make this last
[55:19] weekend what it was, Abraham was met by
[55:22] Melzdc after his battle for Lot. Abraham
[55:27] gave out for his brother.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; He recovered. He went and he and he and
[55:31] he he he went to war for Lot. and and
[55:34] the musicians, the singers, the event in
[55:37] itself, it was you you're going you're
[55:39] you're letting out of your your own
[55:42] energies, your own uh uh your gifts,
[55:45] your your your everything you are.
[55:47] You're pouring yourself into the event.
[55:50] Abraham did that. And after that, he met
[55:53] God.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And so, I believe that there's a
[55:57] blessing for you.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; You might be tired and weary still
[56:00] tonight. You might be homesick after the
[56:02] event, but I believe that there there's
[56:04] a blessing for you.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; And and and and there was there was
[56:08] revelation
[56:10] for for Abraham. He knew Melzdc. He knew
[56:14] God.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; It it was refreshment to him. It it was
[56:18] they communed together. That was
[56:20] refreshing to Abraham. Hallelujah.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; In the third seal, he says, "When the
[56:26] truth of a promised word of God," and
[56:28] this is I really just want to try to lay
[56:31] this in as I as much as I can. When the
[56:33] truth of a promised word of God has been
[56:35] truly revealed to his saints that's
[56:37] filled with oil. They get stimulated.
[56:39] Wine is stimulation. Glory. I feel it
[56:41] right now. Stimulation with joy. Shout.
[56:44] See, for with stammering lips and with
[56:46] other tongues will I speak to this
[56:48] people. And this is the refreshment.
[56:51] This is the wine that's poured out. What
[56:53] is wine in the Bible? Refreshment. This
[56:56] is the refreshment that comes from the
[56:57] presence of the Lord. It's got to be
[56:59] scriptural. But they were stimulated by
[57:02] what? By revelation.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; So the revelation is wine. And brother
[57:06] Brenham's saying wine in the in the in
[57:08] the scripture that was the refreshment
[57:10] that when they they couldn't drink the
[57:11] water, when they needed refreshment,
[57:13] they would drink the wine. Wine. We
[57:15] drink wine. It's the revelation. It's
[57:17] it's the word of God.
[57:20] made plain. It's It's vindicated
[57:23] revelation made plain. It brings joy. It
[57:26] it it if you're down, it makes you
[57:28] happy.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; It it encourages you.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It it it does all these things we need
[57:34] for refreshment that we look for. Uh the
[57:37] the the scouring out by the gospel. When
[57:40] you scour something, you're refreshing
[57:41] it.
[57:43] True.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; You know what real victory is when
[57:45] you've been refreshed by the word,
[57:47] hearing the full gospel when you come
[57:50] here and you hear the full gospel
[57:52] preached. And and and you know, just
[57:55] thinking about the the I just had that
[57:57] thought, the rain on my mind. The rain
[57:59] and there's a former rain and a latter
[58:01] rain that's been poured out. It shall be
[58:04] light in the evening time. Even when
[58:06] it's dark, misty, neither night or day,
[58:09] it shall be light.
[58:12] But but the the the the the former rain,
[58:14] the teaching rain, the sewing rain, and
[58:16] then the latter rain, the harvest rain.
[58:18] It it needs the anointing upon it. It
[58:21] needs the spirit of God upon it. You
[58:22] have to come into the presence of God.
[58:24] You you need to stay in the word because
[58:26] that's the refreshing, the rain that
[58:29] falls. When God washes us by the water
[58:32] of his word and separates us from sin
[58:34] and unbelief, it's a refreshment to us.
[58:38] the the the the the water and the rain
[58:41] and and how how a a drink of cool water
[58:44] is refreshing.
[58:46] Rain is refreshing, especially after a
[58:49] drought or when the humidity is high.
[58:52] You know, we get high humidity and it
[58:54] just you walk outside and it just it
[58:56] just feels wet. The moisture's in the
[58:58] air, but it's a miserable wetness.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Let the rain come and there's something
[59:03] refreshing about a soft rolling thunder
[59:05] and the sound of rain.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; The smell right before a rain, the the
[59:10] the odor, the the the the the perfume,
[59:14] especially in desert country. So, you
[59:16] feel dry tonight
[59:18] &gt;&gt; in the desert country out in Arizona
[59:21] before the rain, you get this just this
[59:23] beautiful rich smell that comes just I
[59:27] don't know how to describe it other than
[59:28] wet dirt. It just smells like wet dirt.
[59:32] It gets this wet dirt smell and it's so
[59:34] fragrant and lets you know that the rain
[59:36] is coming
[59:38] when you're when you're when you're
[59:40] feeling weary, when you when you're
[59:41] feeling dry, when you feel like you're
[59:43] not connecting, it just just pray for
[59:46] the rain. Just God, give me revelation.
[59:49] God, bring the rain. Bring revive my
[59:52] soul. I I'm dry now, but the but in the
[59:55] driest times, it's when the be the rain
[59:57] is the most beautiful.
[1:00:00] the revelation, the the the the the
[1:00:03] teaching, the the spirit coming and
[1:00:06] watering that word
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; rain dropping down upon the natural
[1:00:11] vegetation of the earth. It's a type of
[1:00:13] spiritual rain which gives eternal life.
[1:00:15] Scripture calls it the former rain. So
[1:00:17] we we we went through this.
[1:00:20] The rain produces the blessings upon the
[1:00:22] earth and the spirit reigning produces
[1:00:24] the blessings of God.
[1:00:27] But we can get so caught up on the
[1:00:29] blessings of God that we forget where
[1:00:32] the blessings came from.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And so we're not just we're not just
[1:00:38] enjoying the blessings of God, but we
[1:00:40] want to enjoy God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; We want to enjoy the revelation that
[1:00:44] comes with the blessings. If I come and
[1:00:46] I'm just getting blessed, that's that's
[1:00:48] not stimulating. You might you the rain
[1:00:51] falls on the just and the unjust. Now,
[1:00:53] I'm not calling you just and unjust, but
[1:00:54] I'm just saying it it it can fall and
[1:00:57] you can get stimulated, but it's not
[1:00:59] doing anything. It's not really
[1:01:00] refreshing you. You need it to go
[1:01:03] deeper. You need it to water your soul.
[1:01:06] At the end of the service
[1:01:09] when the full gospel's been preached,
[1:01:11] the refreshing that comes from giving
[1:01:13] our praise to him, the Holy Ghost
[1:01:16] watering that promise that you received
[1:01:19] through the word being preached
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; for your healing, for your salvation,
[1:01:24] for a better walk, for for fear to leave
[1:01:27] you, for whatever you have need of. But
[1:01:30] if we always leave right after the
[1:01:32] service,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes before the ministry has
[1:01:35] dismissed, we miss an important part of
[1:01:39] refreshing ourselves.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; We water. We give back to God. And God,
[1:01:45] we we just ask him, Lord, just just
[1:01:47] water what you've given me.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; And it and it's and it's it's that
[1:01:52] hurry. It's that rush. Why are you in a
[1:01:55] hurry?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Why are you leaving so fast? You're
[1:01:58] missing you're you're missing a
[1:02:00] blessing.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; You're missing an important part of the
[1:02:03] service. You're checking out too soon.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; You you you
[1:02:08] might want to just clock in and clock
[1:02:10] out, but you're clocking out too early.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Receiving the Holy Ghost into our souls
[1:02:17] is the greatest refreshing.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Even after we receive the spirit, we
[1:02:22] need those times of refreshing. The the
[1:02:24] the they the um they were up in the
[1:02:26] upper room. They received the spirit of
[1:02:28] God. It was refreshment to them. But
[1:02:30] then just two chapters later, I think it
[1:02:32] is. They needed another refreshing.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; They were in fear. They they were
[1:02:36] worrying. But when that refreshing came,
[1:02:39] the worry left.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; When you're sick and come into his
[1:02:44] presence, we are healed. That's
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; When the doctor says there's no more can
[1:02:48] be done or says it's cancer, the best
[1:02:50] thing we can do is get them into the
[1:02:52] presence of God.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's talking. He says this
[1:02:55] woman on the stretcher he said what what
[1:02:57] do we do for what what can we do? We
[1:02:59] lift her into the presence of God. You
[1:03:01] create an atmosphere
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; so that they can come into the presence
[1:03:05] of God and receive their healing. You
[1:03:07] see this goes much deeper than the thing
[1:03:09] than what we think it is. You come and
[1:03:12] you create an atmosphere. You put your
[1:03:13] lick of fire together and that creates
[1:03:16] an atmosphere of refreshing not just for
[1:03:19] you but for the one who might be sick or
[1:03:21] discouraged.
[1:03:23] But we can just send the presence of God
[1:03:24] to them if they if they're too sick and
[1:03:27] they can't make it. Sister Sister uh
[1:03:29] Galuchia was telling me, Emily, they
[1:03:31] want to be here, but she just can't
[1:03:33] right now. We can send the pres sister
[1:03:35] Emily, we send the presence of God to
[1:03:37] you just now.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; We can send it to them. We lift them up.
[1:03:40] We lift their name up before the throne
[1:03:42] of God.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when the church gets
[1:03:45] to that place where Christ means so much
[1:03:48] to us that we thirst to get in his
[1:03:50] presence and with each other, it's
[1:03:52] lifegiving resource. Brother Brandham
[1:03:54] said,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; "What is any sweeter?" I'm I'm coming
[1:03:59] down fast
[1:04:05] now. Just I just I was thinking, you
[1:04:06] know, we're talking about the spiritual
[1:04:08] things, but there's natural things, too,
[1:04:09] that refreshes us that God gives us in
[1:04:11] this life. And one of the things that
[1:04:13] came to my mind, I guess, along the
[1:04:15] lines with what we said Peter's Peter's
[1:04:18] wise marriage council was joint joints
[1:04:21] of grace. Uh uh and and what is any
[1:04:25] sweeter in a man's life? What is any
[1:04:27] sweeter than to come home when he's
[1:04:29] tired and weary with his little bucket
[1:04:31] in his hand from working all day or
[1:04:32] plowing or whatever he might be to walk
[1:04:35] in and have a lovely wife to meet him at
[1:04:37] the door. Sit down on his lap a minute
[1:04:39] and brush his brow a little and kiss him
[1:04:41] on the cheek and put her arm around him.
[1:04:43] Say, "Dear, I know you're tired. You
[1:04:45] You've worked so hard. Give him
[1:04:47] consolation."
[1:04:48] Now that he knows that that arm is
[1:04:51] around him is absolutely his. It's his.
[1:04:55] Never is it around any other man or any
[1:04:57] other desire. The kiss that's on his
[1:04:59] cheek is from real pure holy heart that
[1:05:02] just loves him and him alone. How it
[1:05:04] makes you I know makes you stick your
[1:05:07] chest out and say, "I'm not so tired
[1:05:09] after all."
[1:05:12] See, that's it. It does something to
[1:05:14] you. That's something God gives you to
[1:05:16] refresh you.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; He that finds a wife finds a good thing.
[1:05:24] What is more refreshing than a husband
[1:05:27] putting his arm around his wife after
[1:05:29] she's had a long day with the kids?
[1:05:31] Taking taking care of the house, maybe
[1:05:33] feeling a bit lonely and down. A husband
[1:05:36] giving his wife an affectionate hug.
[1:05:39] Giving her a little a little kiss of
[1:05:40] affection,
[1:05:42] letting her know she's beautiful to you
[1:05:44] still.
[1:05:46] Even though I I don't know if it's
[1:05:47] somewhere in the message and men latched
[1:05:49] on to it or where it came from, but even
[1:05:51] if she doesn't greet you with a bow in
[1:05:52] her hair and her hair's, you know,
[1:05:54] sticking up every which way, this this
[1:05:57] is war with them kids.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Telling her she still looks beautiful.
[1:06:03] Giving her somebody to talk to
[1:06:06] to to let her know somebody loves her
[1:06:09] and was thinking about her throughout
[1:06:10] the day.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's refreshing to her. That refreshes
[1:06:14] her spirit. She might have fought them
[1:06:16] kids and and might have might have lost
[1:06:18] a little bit, but reinforcements is home
[1:06:21] with bigger guns
[1:06:25] and just just that is a refreshment to
[1:06:27] her.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; It's refreshing to be around godly
[1:06:32] friendships,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; that believe the way you believe,
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; that support you in what you do,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; that laugh together and relate to each
[1:06:42] other in the time of life you're in.
[1:06:44] That's right. That's right.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Seems like if we'll show ourselves
[1:06:48] friendly and get around a bit that God
[1:06:50] gives us good friendships in the body of
[1:06:52] Christ.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Friendships that'll refresh our spirit.
[1:06:56] That'll that'll that'll refresh us and
[1:06:58] and and help us in life.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Youth meetings are a good thing to
[1:07:04] attend.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; We we do them here for you.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; And it's a good thing to attend. It's
[1:07:10] good friendships to build. It's good
[1:07:12] refreshment. It's, you know, you go to
[1:07:14] school and you and and you go to schools
[1:07:17] and maybe it's a it's a it's a good
[1:07:18] school, but maybe they don't believe
[1:07:20] exactly the way you do. Maybe you go to
[1:07:23] public school. It was always a
[1:07:24] refreshment to me to come in. I I mean,
[1:07:26] I needed a place to go and I was going
[1:07:29] to find some place to go because that's
[1:07:31] just what teens do.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; But I was given a place to go each
[1:07:34] Friday night. And and and I took it up.
[1:07:37] And I I mean, I had a great time growing
[1:07:40] up. We had good friendships. We had good
[1:07:42] good teaching and and it was just it
[1:07:45] it's a memory to me.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; They're good. They're good things.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; So, I'm get I'm getting close to the
[1:07:56] quote you have, but not yet. Just a
[1:07:59] little bit more reading. And every
[1:08:00] Christian comes the same way when he
[1:08:02] comes into the presence of God. First,
[1:08:04] he has to be refreshed. The Holy Spirit
[1:08:06] has to take hold of a man, renew him,
[1:08:08] and make him another person. The Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost comes in just a refreshment. The
[1:08:12] Holy Ghost comes in the quiet of the
[1:08:14] hour. God has to give you a spirit that
[1:08:17] makes you even even agreeable. You're
[1:08:20] you're just you're not quiet. Your
[1:08:21] spirit's not quiet.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You know, you go out in the morning real
[1:08:26] early when the de is on the ground. The
[1:08:27] dew falls just before daylight. Usually
[1:08:30] sometime in the night after the hustle
[1:08:32] and bustle of the world is gone, is to
[1:08:34] bed after everything's asleep. Did you
[1:08:37] ever go out early of a morning and you
[1:08:39] go out early and and everything is so
[1:08:43] fresh? Just feel fresh early in the
[1:08:45] morning. The old earth has been hit away
[1:08:47] for a while and it's refreshed. Have you
[1:08:49] ever got up in the middle of the night
[1:08:51] and you just you just step outside for a
[1:08:53] minute? You there's less cars anyway,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; less cars. There's just there's a
[1:08:59] stillness in the air. There's there's a
[1:09:01] quiet the God God has laid the earth to
[1:09:04] sleep
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; and there's just it's just a refreshing
[1:09:08] just to step out into that quietness
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; and did did you ever come in the
[1:09:14] presence of a man or woman who had hid
[1:09:16] themselves away from the world remember
[1:09:18] Jonah Jonah left the presence of God and
[1:09:21] look at the negative effect but this is
[1:09:23] somebody who's going to the presence of
[1:09:24] God a man or woman hid themselves it's a
[1:09:28] refreshing to talk to him they refresh
[1:09:30] themselves elves, they begin to come to
[1:09:32] life. And did you ever go into the rose
[1:09:34] garden early of a morning up down the
[1:09:37] highways real early dees on the ground
[1:09:39] hold the odor of honeysuckle and so
[1:09:41] forth? Just like a Christian who has hid
[1:09:44] himself away with God in the stillness
[1:09:46] of the night or somewhere and come forth
[1:09:48] the next day with a freshness, a odorous
[1:09:51] life, a pleasant place to be, somebody
[1:09:54] you like to talk to,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; somebody that can encourage you,
[1:09:58] somebody you got confidence in. You want
[1:09:59] people to talk to you.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Refresh yourself in the presence of God.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; People like to talk to you.
[1:10:07] Your neighbor over there, how you love
[1:10:09] to talk with her. See, it's the
[1:10:11] freshness, the odorous. Um, and the
[1:10:14] thing and the and the next thing, it
[1:10:15] yields fruit. Everywhere the Holy Spirit
[1:10:17] comes, it always plants the seed of God
[1:10:19] and yields fruit. The the staff of of uh
[1:10:22] Moses was placed in in the glory of God,
[1:10:25] the shikina, and it budded. It came to
[1:10:28] life. And that's what he's saying. When
[1:10:29] you get into the presence of God, you
[1:10:31] come to life. You produce fruit.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Another great thing of entering into
[1:10:36] this place is a place where you can have
[1:10:37] confidence. You can believe. You can
[1:10:40] have confidence. You need confidence.
[1:10:42] Get into the presence of God.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the quote you have.
[1:10:49] Look at it. Look at it. The budding. The
[1:10:51] first thing we find out what makes trees
[1:10:53] bud, it's a refreshment. What makes the
[1:10:56] refreshing? Early of a morning, you go
[1:10:58] out early, find out after the night,
[1:11:00] everything gets still, the dew falls and
[1:11:02] it brings a refreshing. The trouble of
[1:11:04] it is today
[1:11:07] the people don't have time to get before
[1:11:10] God and get still.
[1:11:14] The trouble of it today, the people
[1:11:17] don't have time to get before God and
[1:11:20] get still.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; They got so many things to do. They
[1:11:24] belong to this. They got to do this.
[1:11:25] They got to do have this. They got to be
[1:11:28] here. You don't have time. Listen, the
[1:11:31] devil's just took up all your time.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; my my. The devil is taking up all your
[1:11:38] time. I think we need to reassess what
[1:11:40] we're busy doing.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; The devil's taking up all your time. You
[1:11:45] don't have time to get still before God,
[1:11:47] to get quiet. You don't have time. I I
[1:11:50] you know, this is this is amazing. I
[1:11:53] want to be refreshed. I need refreshing.
[1:11:56] Well, get just get still be I don't got
[1:11:58] time.
[1:11:59] I don't got time. Well, the devil's
[1:12:01] pulled something on you.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Get in the quiet. And remember, after
[1:12:06] all, you're a nature. And after all,
[1:12:09] nature gets quiet. Isn't this amazing?
[1:12:12] And still, then the dew begins to fall.
[1:12:14] That refreshes and brings forth life.
[1:12:16] And you are a nature yourself.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; And when you get quiet and still, I'm
[1:12:21] giving you the keys now. Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; When you get quiet and still before God,
[1:12:25] then the dew of heaven begins to fall
[1:12:27] and begins to refresh.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Did you ever go out of a morning after
[1:12:32] the night has passed early of a morning
[1:12:34] also it blossoms to give fragrance? And
[1:12:36] did you ever go out early of a morning
[1:12:38] to the define the fragrance? You find
[1:12:40] out that early of the morning when you
[1:12:42] get out the dew is hanging low, the
[1:12:44] trees are budding, the blossoms are
[1:12:46] coming up, the perfume is go along the
[1:12:49] road, smell the honeysuckles into the
[1:12:51] rose garden. That's why it's been quiet.
[1:12:54] Nature has through the night. It got
[1:12:56] quiet and God bathed it in refreshing.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That's what you need to do is get away
[1:13:03] and get quiet before God so he can bathe
[1:13:06] you with the refreshment from heaven.
[1:13:08] Amen. Get alone to yourself. Close the
[1:13:11] doors. Pull them together and say, "Now,
[1:13:14] Lord, here I am in your presence.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Here I am in your presence." Musicians,
[1:13:21] you can come.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; You can stand to your feet.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our hearts for a
[1:13:31] minute as they as they prepare
[1:13:36] and just let your let yourself get quiet
[1:13:39] for a minute.
[1:13:41] Been hustle and bustle all day. It's
[1:13:43] it's work and kids and school and things
[1:13:46] and just just let yourself get quiet.
[1:13:49] And I pray in the in the presence of God
[1:13:51] that you'll you'll feel refreshed
[1:13:53] tonight.
[1:13:56] Lord, I pray for your people this
[1:13:57] evening. I pray for I I need refreshing,
[1:14:00] Lord.
[1:14:01] Just Lord, we go through trials and
[1:14:04] tribulations and and just everyday life
[1:14:07] and we're battling constantly. The
[1:14:10] accuser of the brethren comes before us
[1:14:13] day and night and Lord, it it weies us
[1:14:16] and then we we we just there's so much
[1:14:18] in this life that Satan has created.
[1:14:23] Not only does he steal our time from us,
[1:14:26] makes us so busy that we we can't get
[1:14:29] still. Even when we do get a quiet
[1:14:32] moment, we can't still ourselves.
[1:14:35] It's just we're we're too busy. He's
[1:14:37] created this environment around us.
[1:14:41] And yet, Lord, yet you've promised times
[1:14:44] of refreshing.
[1:14:47] And so Lord, just feeling your presence
[1:14:49] now. I pray that everybody under the
[1:14:51] sound of my voice
[1:14:54] would feel your presence.
[1:14:57] And Lord, we don't just want your
[1:14:59] blessings.
[1:15:02] I I I remember reading
[1:15:05] when when that vision came and that
[1:15:08] blast and
[1:15:10] or the dream or whatever it was before
[1:15:12] it had happened and it worried brother
[1:15:14] Brandham
[1:15:16] and and he said he just he just came and
[1:15:19] he was praying and and your power came
[1:15:22] your anointing came down and he said
[1:15:25] that's real power. He said, "That's not
[1:15:27] the blessings you feel." Lord, we thank
[1:15:30] you for the blessings. We We want the
[1:15:32] blessings,
[1:15:34] but Lord, we want something deeper than
[1:15:36] the We want the We want the one who's
[1:15:38] giving the blessings,
[1:15:41] Lord. We We want and and I don't mean it
[1:15:44] arrogantly, Lord. We want We want power
[1:15:46] to live every day. We want your
[1:15:49] anointing. We want, Lord, and and by
[1:15:53] that, we can't just have your blessings.
[1:15:56] We need you, Lord.
[1:15:58] We need you, Father, to to stabilize our
[1:16:02] minds, to to stabilize, Lord, our
[1:16:05] nervous system.
[1:16:08] Lord, we need you. And we we cry out to
[1:16:10] you, Lord. We we tell you just humbly
[1:16:14] just now, Lord, with with lifted hands,
[1:16:17] we need you, Lord, and we need
[1:16:20] refreshing from you tonight,
[1:16:23] Lord. were weary. Father,
[1:16:26] many have given themselves out over the
[1:16:28] weekend. They're weary, Lord. It was a
[1:16:31] great weekend. I'm not taking from it.
[1:16:33] I'm not knocking it. But I'm just
[1:16:34] saying, Lord, we're tired and we just
[1:16:37] need refreshing, Lord.
[1:16:40] And I pray you'd grant it tonight to
[1:16:42] every heart. Those who need who need
[1:16:44] healing, we lift them into your
[1:16:46] presence. We lift Sister Emily into your
[1:16:48] presence tonight. We lift those who

[1:17:11] presence pour out upon them, Lord. We
[1:17:14] ask it just the the best way we know
[1:17:18] how.

[1:17:22] weary soul. Just Lord,
[1:17:26] Lord, just feeling their weariness just
[1:17:28] now.
[1:17:30] I pray you'd refresh them.
[1:17:34] Let your spirit come. Lord, as we just
[1:17:38] sometimes we do have to go right away,
[1:17:41] but Lord, we just want to stay a moment.
[1:17:45] Let you water what the what what
[1:17:47] promises you've given us tonight. Let
[1:17:50] you water your word.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you, Father, you've you've
[1:17:56] brought seowing rain. Now bring reaping
[1:18:00] rain.
[1:18:01] Just water the word with your spirit.
[1:18:03] Lord, water it with your presence. Give
[1:18:06] us refreshings, I pray,
[1:18:10] Lord. Refresh this church.
[1:18:13] refresh this body, Lord. I've been
[1:18:16] thinking there's a there's a song and
[1:18:18] I'm just too inadequate to sing it, but
[1:18:20] send us a Holy Ghost revival,
[1:18:23] Lord. Not just bathing the church with
[1:18:26] it, but bathing every heart with it,
[1:18:28] every individual with it. Bring us
[1:18:30] revival, I pray, as as Satan sws his
[1:18:35] evil seed, trying to thwart the master's
[1:18:38] plan. the servants's tired and
[1:18:41] discouraged.
[1:18:43] They're doing the best they can, but
[1:18:46] Lord, we need a Holy Ghost revival.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Revive us, Lord. I pray
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
