[1:12] to Luke
[1:13] Luke this morning Luke 12. Luke 12.
[1:17] verse 32
[1:21] Luke 12 32.
[1:32] Luke 12 32 says
[1:36] it says fear not little flock
[1:39] for it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:42] give you the kingdom
[1:44] I want to speak on this morning about
[1:46] the evidence of that land
[1:49] the evidence of that land
[1:51] may we go to prayer father we love you
[1:53] Lord
[1:54] God you just so wonderful there's

[2:07] just the all-knowing God and we love you
[2:09] Lord we thank you for just to be in your
[2:11] presence this morning made something
[2:12] that be said this morning to help me get
[2:15] out of the way Lord not to be of myself
[2:17] but to be of you God let us get in a
[2:20] channel this morning to speak to your
[2:21] bride your people this morning draw us
[2:24] closer this morning Lord father we just
[2:27] want to be more like you Lord we just
[2:29] God We Adore You Lord we just we're
[2:31] searching for that landlord
[2:33] God we're searching we're like Caleb and
[2:36] Joshua where we're not giving up till we
[2:37] see that land this morning and father I
[2:40] ask you just bless this church blessed
[2:42] brother Paul and everyone here father we
[2:44] love you in Jesus Christ's name amen you
[2:47] may be seated
[2:49] because I was thinking on this I was
[2:51] reading that Luke 12 32 this morning
[2:57] I was thinking about that fear not
[2:59] little flock
[3:01] and it's so it's so good that he says
[3:03] fear not little flock and brother Bram
[3:05] says it was it was a little flock
[3:08] he all he goes on to say that it's and
[3:10] he says for it's your father's good
[3:12] pleasure to give you the kingdom
[3:14] and aren't you glad this morning that
[3:17] Jesus Christ is coming for a bride
[3:20] without Sparta wrinkle this morning
[3:23] but you know what it's nothing that
[3:25] we've done he's already paid the price
[3:28] he's coming for a bride and brother Bram
[3:30] says in one place he says everything we
[3:32] have we need of is is preparing for the
[3:35] bride everything we need of is in the
[3:37] word of God
[3:38] he's already paid the price there's
[3:39] nothing we can do I could travel the
[3:42] roads a million miles and it's still not
[3:43] enough
[3:44] but his blood and what he's done is
[3:47] worth it all he's paid the price and I
[3:50] believe we're all searching for land
[3:51] this morning I believe that you're not
[3:54] just come here just to get in your car
[3:55] to hear me or hear Brother Paul but to
[3:57] hear from Jesus Christ
[3:59] and we're all going through this life
[4:01] and we go through the hard times that
[4:03] brother Bram said it's not always on the
[4:04] mountaintops but it's in the valleys
[4:07] you know and then when they had the
[4:09] great fights in Goliath and you think
[4:11] about it it always was in The Valleys
[4:12] they were fighting
[4:14] you know it's not always on the
[4:15] Mountaintop he says the fruit freezes in
[4:17] the mountaintops
[4:18] and I love what he says that he says the
[4:20] fruit freezes but in the Mountaintop in
[4:23] The Valleys we have to press through we
[4:26] have to it's a struggle it's a fight
[4:27] every day it's not always oh it's just
[4:30] wonderful song or one for this but we go
[4:32] through trials in life but the pressures
[4:34] make you better makes you a better
[4:37] person it cleans you out it it it the
[4:40] the brother Brahman says tension
[4:42] tension's good for you
[4:44] church is good for you this morning so
[4:47] it's hard to grasp sometimes when it's
[4:49] in your own front yard or you're
[4:51] fighting through but but we're we're
[4:53] looking for that land this morning
[4:55] and I believe that I would call you a
[4:57] Caleb and Joshua this morning that we're
[4:59] out of over 2 million people there was
[5:01] two that came back and saw evidence of
[5:03] that land
[5:04] and I believe we you might we might look
[5:07] small and vital but we are strong in the
[5:09] army of God
[5:11] you know he might he said well he camps
[5:13] about us that we we get in here and we
[5:15] start having church and we we inherited
[5:17] his praise you know what he don't just
[5:19] go to the Tabernacle of Jeffersonville
[5:21] but when you call on him he's encamped
[5:23] around these walls this morning and when
[5:25] you're in your car you call on him in
[5:27] time of need but I'm telling you we're
[5:29] going to a city and I want to encourage
[5:31] you this morning not to give up
[5:33] not to give up when you're in your
[5:35] doubts and you're in your valleys and
[5:37] you know why I say keep pressing on
[5:40] and when brother Brandon went behind the
[5:42] curtain of time and the message behind
[5:44] the curtain of time he went from his
[5:46] body he went over there and he said
[5:48] these are converts coming to him at 90
[5:50] years old and he said you don't remember
[5:52] me and she said no I'm paraphrasing for
[5:54] time this morning but he says no I don't
[5:56] remember you and he goes over there and
[5:58] you know he says you don't want to miss
[6:00] this land you don't want to miss this
[6:01] for nothing
[6:03] and he didn't even want to go back into
[6:05] his body he said but the the crowd kept
[6:07] saying keep pressing on keep pressing
[6:10] through this bottle and I believe if
[6:12] your loved ones today that's passed on
[6:14] they would pull the curtain of time and
[6:16] tell you to keep pressing on to keep
[6:19] holding the torch it might seem tough
[6:21] and life seems tough and it throws you
[6:24] curved balls but I tell you that land's
[6:27] full of milk and honey this morning that
[6:29] lamb we're searching for is something to
[6:31] strive for with everything that's within
[6:34] you everything you have is is searching
[6:36] for that land and not to give up
[6:40] program says he says in this message
[6:43] testimony he said Jesus always said fear
[6:46] not fear not do not fear Reverend said
[6:49] Don't Fear he said don't do that he said
[6:53] if you do then God can't work with you
[6:56] he said if you do he said if you do
[6:59] believe then God can work with you isn't
[7:02] it that right he said I have that faith
[7:05] in God I believe that's what Jesus said
[7:07] have faith in God and you know the Bible
[7:10] says you can't even please God without
[7:11] faith but you know what faith is it's by
[7:15] coming and hearing the word of God
[7:17] is by listening to the prophet listening
[7:20] to you know what I thought about was
[7:22] driving over and praying and I thought
[7:23] about you know what the message don't
[7:25] need to be tested
[7:27] he's already proved he was medicated
[7:29] prophet in this day it's already been
[7:31] tested it's been trial it's your test
[7:34] now
[7:35] it's the bride's test to see what you
[7:38] believe and you Proclaim and this
[7:41] message that's already been tested it's
[7:43] already been Vindicated but it's just
[7:45] you getting in the Bible and saying you
[7:48] know what I'm gonna fight for every inch
[7:49] I'm gonna fight for my family members
[7:51] I'm going to fight for my loved ones I'm
[7:54] going to fight for this sickness you
[7:56] know what I tell my I tell sweetheart
[7:58] today you claim your healing this
[8:00] morning you get up and claim it this
[8:02] morning
[8:05] if you came with depression you know
[8:07] what God didn't God didn't want you to
[8:09] have that this morning he's already paid
[8:11] the price you have to accept it this
[8:14] morning
[8:14] he wants you to have this land you know
[8:17] what he said he died for all of us
[8:20] he died for us all you're just blessed
[8:22] to see the truth
[8:24] you're just blessed aren't you glad that
[8:26] he went through the garbage can today or
[8:28] to the dump yard and picked you up
[8:31] and set you aside and said hey you're
[8:34] one of them no I don't know why he
[8:36] passed this piece of trash but he picked
[8:38] this one up it set you aside for service
[8:41] well aren't you thankful this morning
[8:43] that he picked you up out of the Maori
[8:45] clay set your feet upon a rock and I'll
[8:48] tell you what we're here to stay
[8:51] but it's trust in Jesus Christ
[8:52] everything I tell my I tell my wife all
[8:55] the time I said we tell the boys I said
[8:57] boys no matter what we do we're gonna
[8:59] like Joshua we're going to serve the
[9:01] Lord in this house
[9:03] I said for the for the days that we live
[9:05] we'll serve the Lord if Daddy loses his
[9:07] job will still serve the Lord if I don't
[9:10] have enough money better to pay to us
[9:12] we're still going to pay our tithes
[9:14] because that's what the Bible says
[9:17] and this has to be your absolute the
[9:19] word of God the word of God
[9:22] because you know what this was brother
[9:24] Graham's road map right here
[9:26] the Bible you know we read his quotes
[9:28] and I'm so thankful for the prophet but
[9:30] you know what he pointed us to Jesus
[9:32] Christ he showed every one of you who
[9:35] Jesus was where we're going where we
[9:38] came from and where we're going and I'm
[9:40] thankful this this morning that he
[9:42] showed you he showed me what the grace
[9:45] of God we had this morning that there's
[9:47] evidence in that land because brother
[9:50] Branham went behind the curtain of time
[9:52] he didn't want to go back to that body
[9:54] they always tell him my mom's over there
[9:56] and I say praise God she got baptized
[9:59] and gave her heart to the Lord probably
[10:00] about four months before she fell over
[10:02] you know I'd love to have her back but
[10:04] not in a way I'm actually jealous in a
[10:07] way because I'm like you're in that land
[10:08] waiting for us to to the adoption we're
[10:12] all groaning the Bible says we're
[10:13] groaning on the inside waiting for
[10:15] adoption
[10:17] and if there's something that's not on
[10:18] the inside this morning that's not
[10:20] groaning for that for that land or for
[10:23] that adoption this morning it's time for
[10:26] a checkup
[10:27] it's time for a checkup this morning if
[10:29] we don't have something on the inside
[10:31] that's groaning like crying out saying
[10:33] father come quickly Lord
[10:35] come quickly I know you'll have had
[10:37] enough of this past house
[10:41] the prophet is God says he said he said
[10:43] so don't fear fear is of the devil
[10:47] he said every time everything Jesus
[10:50] would say fear not he said consistently
[10:53] fear not fear not is that right always
[10:56] fear not he said now God don't want you
[10:58] to fear he wants you to believe
[11:02] he says so every one of you believe with
[11:05] one Accord one Accord every one of you
[11:08] you think about that he would always say
[11:10] I love what the prophet said he said
[11:11] even cancer wouldn't have stand in the
[11:13] way if you could believe
[11:16] even cancer
[11:17] covet whatever they want to call it
[11:19] Delta American Airline virus whatever it
[11:22] is Delta it's always something every
[11:24] year
[11:25] it's always a new virus in the land but
[11:28] God has conquered every virus every
[11:31] sickness 2 000 years ago you have
[11:34] evidence this morning
[11:36] you just have to accept it
[11:39] Austin says his faith in the believer
[11:41] that makes them whole we can pray for
[11:43] you all day but you've got to let your
[11:45] body obey that confession and you have
[11:47] to claim it every day claim your job
[11:49] claim your inheritance God's gave it to
[11:52] you just claim it
[11:54] I love Barbara talks about the abstract
[11:57] deed he says hey we have the abstract
[11:59] deed and it goes all the way back if you
[12:02] pull it on the house and I've been in
[12:03] real estate where you pull it back you
[12:04] see all the owners but you know what's
[12:06] so great we see the king written over
[12:08] ours when you look back you might have
[12:11] all these different owners but the King
[12:12] was the first owner and he's conquered
[12:15] death held in the grave and I'll tell
[12:17] you he's coming for a bride this morning
[12:18] and we should be all looking for that
[12:21] land we should keep our focus on that
[12:23] land and that should be our shride this
[12:25] morning
[12:28] that should be our stride this morning
[12:31] program says when Divine love is
[12:33] projected in 1957.
[12:35] he said when those Hornets had me
[12:37] covered I knew I'd be stung to death in
[12:39] a few moments he said instead of being
[12:42] afraid
[12:43] he said there was only two elements that
[12:45] you can be controlled by and that's
[12:46] either Faith or doubt
[12:49] he says a fear will accompany doubt so
[12:52] if you he said if you're Jesus said fear
[12:54] not Don't Be Afraid God keeps his word
[12:57] no matter what condition you are tonight
[13:01] God keeps his word
[13:03] I love that God keeps this word that's
[13:06] who we got to trust in it's not by what
[13:08] I do it's all about what Jesus already
[13:11] said he's done he's already gave you
[13:13] he's already done he's paid the price we
[13:15] just have to accept it that's like Bobby
[13:17] Brown said that when that uh when the uh
[13:19] I'm paraphrasing the night this morning
[13:21] for time but he talks about the
[13:23] president he gave him that pardon and he
[13:25] brought it back to him and he didn't
[13:26] accept that pardon you know he had his
[13:29] party right in front of him
[13:30] but he didn't accept it you know what
[13:33] you just got to reach out and accept it
[13:35] this morning you know what if you have
[13:37] Assad this morning how thankful you
[13:39] should be
[13:40] how thankful you should be because I've
[13:42] come from a home and I would pass it up
[13:44] through here coming up I told the boys I
[13:46] think it's that little mosque up here on
[13:47] in Perrysburg and we were passing
[13:50] through I said boys I said Isaac I never
[13:52] thought I would drive back through here
[13:53] and bring back memories never thought it
[13:56] didn't family never saw the message none
[13:58] of my family saw the message and my
[14:00] grandmother handed me them two CDs one
[14:02] day when I was going to the military she
[14:04] said why the nomination just about
[14:05] religion and it changed my life
[14:08] that changed my life because I realized
[14:12] there was an Evidence there was a deep
[14:14] call to the Deep to respond
[14:16] there was a deep cloth to the deep and I
[14:18] was passing up this mosque and we turned
[14:20] off and I said boys son I used to just
[14:23] walk down this highway and I used to
[14:25] walk down this highway and I'd walk
[14:26] through here as a little kid trying to
[14:28] run away from home
[14:30] and I started running around that mosque
[14:31] and it was corn fields at the time
[14:33] and I said it was like a Kmart over
[14:35] there and we go through the wrong crowds
[14:37] and we would try to run away from home
[14:39] for weeks and come back and I said boy I
[14:41] look at I said and I said but God came
[14:43] and rich in Mercy
[14:45] I said God he from the foundation of the
[14:48] world he came down and he saved me a
[14:49] sign
[14:50] and I said he did the same thing with
[14:52] you son
[14:53] and then we might it might be cold
[14:55] outside but the holy spirit is warned
[14:57] today
[14:58] and I thought about that mosque and I
[15:00] thought about how but that's every one
[15:02] of our Lives we all have a testimony
[15:04] we've all but God has come down and gave
[15:07] you evidence of that land this morning
[15:09] and you are the fruit of it this morning
[15:11] I want to claim that this morning if you
[15:13] haven't had had the baptism of the Holy
[15:15] Ghost or you hadn't been baptized I
[15:18] provoke you now to get baptized I say I
[15:21] say get baptized get in the name of
[15:23] Jesus Christ because that's going to
[15:25] carry you through
[15:29] the prophet of God says in the seven
[15:31] Church ages he says in Revelation 15 3
[15:34] he says it says in the in the in the
[15:37] seeing in the scene of the song of Moses
[15:39] the servant of God and the song of the
[15:40] lamb saying great and marvelous are thy
[15:43] Works Lord God Almighty just and true
[15:46] are thy ways thy king of saints he says
[15:49] the lamb the high priest holding his
[15:51] blood as an atonement of The Mercy Seat
[15:53] for our sins is the Lord God Almighty he
[15:57] said that is his presence present office
[15:59] that is what he's doing now pleading his
[16:02] blood for our sins
[16:03] he said but one day that lamb will
[16:06] become the lion of the tribe of Judah
[16:10] and he says he will come forth in the
[16:12] power
[16:13] and glory and take his authority to
[16:16] reign as king
[16:18] he says he is the coming king of this
[16:20] Earth of course he said that he said
[16:23] that does not say he is not a king now
[16:25] he said for he is our king the king of
[16:28] saints right now it's a spiritual
[16:30] Kingdom he said it is not of this world
[16:33] system even as the night of this world
[16:36] that's the reason we act different from
[16:38] the world but he says I love it I'm
[16:40] talking about evidence of the land this
[16:41] morning but he says our citizenship is
[16:44] in heaven
[16:46] our citizenship is in heaven this
[16:48] morning you know I always thought about
[16:50] Brother Paul's thinking you know this is
[16:52] the negative life right now
[16:54] there's always a negative and positive
[16:56] in this flesh we're coming in the
[16:58] negative but there's a positive
[17:00] Awakening there's that theophany
[17:02] awaiting that's pulling groaning to go
[17:05] to a perfect land with milk and honey
[17:07] like Caleb and Joshua and I tell you you
[17:10] ever thought about a battery have you
[17:12] ever tried to crank your car and take
[17:13] the negative off
[17:16] try it
[17:17] try it I wish I had a demonstration I
[17:20] thought about this morning I was praying
[17:22] this morning and I was like man I need a
[17:24] battery with a light but I thought about
[17:25] you take the negative off it doesn't
[17:27] crank
[17:30] it doesn't crank try it go go light up a
[17:33] light and take off the negative it
[17:34] doesn't light up
[17:36] it takes the negative to turn to the
[17:38] positive this morning it takes the bad
[17:40] trials to make you a better Christian it
[17:43] takes the hard trials in the valley to
[17:46] get to the Mountaintop this morning it
[17:49] takes hard trials hard situations care
[17:51] whatever it is this morning but I tell
[17:54] you he is the positive this morning and
[17:56] think about the cross there is a
[17:58] negative sign but Jesus was nailed on
[18:01] the cross it became positive this
[18:03] morning and that's what we go to the
[18:05] bank on this morning there might be a
[18:07] negative sign in it but it was all
[18:09] positive and he was nailed to the cross
[18:14] but it takes the negative to become the
[18:16] positive so don't get down with the
[18:19] devil's on your shoulder he did it with

[20:47] let's turn to numbers this morning
[20:49] how far we'll get but let's turn the
[20:51] numbers this morning
[20:52] numbers 13.
[20:55] verse 17.
[20:58] he talks about the 12 South sent out to
[21:00] the land
[21:02] in verse 17 of numbers 13 17 it says
[21:05] that Moses sent them out to spout the
[21:07] land of Canaan and said to them he said
[21:09] get up this way Southward and go into
[21:11] this mountain
[21:13] and he said see the land what it is and
[21:15] it really hit me and struck me for what
[21:17] it is you know what is sickness good is
[21:19] sickness bad is healing good you know
[21:22] they had to actually question them hey
[21:24] go see what it is if the God says
[21:27] there's a great land if he says you're
[21:29] healing this if you're he can heal you
[21:31] in Jesus name whatever he says in this
[21:33] Bible he'll give it to you but here they
[21:36] go they question and see what the land
[21:38] see the land and what it is and the
[21:40] people that dwell therein whether there
[21:42] be strong or weak few or many
[21:44] and what the land is and they dwell in
[21:46] whether it be good or bad
[21:48] and what cities he says and they be they
[21:52] that dwell in whether the tents or
[21:54] strongholds it says in what the land is
[21:56] whether it be fat or lean whether there
[21:58] be wood therein or not and it says and
[22:01] be of good courage and bring forth fruit
[22:04] of the land bring up the fruit of the
[22:06] land now the time was the he says that
[22:08] was the time was the time of the first
[22:10] great first great right grapes and verse
[22:14] 25 for time
[22:15] it says in the return for they to return
[22:18] from searching for the land after 40
[22:19] days
[22:20] and they went out and came to Moses in
[22:22] there and think about he's sitting all
[22:23] these tribes out there and they the the
[22:25] congregation the children of Israel and
[22:27] to the Wilderness of Pera and the kadish
[22:29] and brought back word unto them and then
[22:32] to the congregation and showed them the
[22:34] fruit of the land verse 27 and they told
[22:37] that they told him and said and said we
[22:39] come into the land whether they're
[22:41] sentenced us and surely it floweth with
[22:43] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[22:46] it he goes to verse 28 28 I'm building
[22:48] on this it says nevertheless the people
[22:50] be strong in that dwell in that land and
[22:53] the cities are walled and very great
[22:55] they started coming back with the evil
[22:57] report
[22:58] think about it they started to go they
[23:00] send them over there and they'd come
[23:01] back and they come back hey well there's
[23:03] they're strong we look like grasshoppers
[23:05] in the side of them we look we're we
[23:07] can't fight this battle but you know
[23:09] what this battle is not yours
[23:12] think about it in second Corinthians
[23:14] second chronicles it talks about King
[23:17] Jehoshaphat and he says hey this battle
[23:19] is not yours it's mine
[23:21] he's already paid the price you might be
[23:24] in battle brothers says you have to
[23:25] fight for every inch of ground and it's
[23:27] it truly is a fight and he says when you
[23:30] become a Christian he says he basically
[23:33] says when you become a Christian you
[23:34] gotta fight and that's when the battles
[23:37] start that's when the trials start
[23:39] that's when the trials of this life but
[23:41] it's come to test you it's come to see
[23:44] who you are in Christ not just to carry
[23:46] around a book and say I believe a
[23:48] message
[23:49] not just to know all the Cults the devil
[23:51] knows the quotes he knows who the
[23:53] prophet is he knows every scripture but
[23:55] I tell you he just looks at the life
[23:57] behind the name
[24:00] he says when a weak Christian gets on
[24:02] their knees he said the devil the devil
[24:04] trembles imagine a pretty dope man of
[24:06] God imagine a man that's that
[24:09] surrendered his life to the calling or
[24:11] whoever it is that's one of us just
[24:13] shrilly saying Lord I will shred
[24:16] everything off me of this world
[24:18] imagine someone prayed up
[24:20] imagine what they do when they get their
[24:22] get on their knees
[24:24] oh praise the Lord
[24:26] it says nevertheless these people be
[24:28] strong and dwell in the land verse verse
[24:29] 30 skip down it says and Caleb's still
[24:31] the people before Moses and said let us
[24:34] go up once and possess it
[24:36] for we are able to overcome it I love
[24:39] that you know what because they knew
[24:41] that if God gave them the land if God
[24:43] said go get the land and he says hey I'm
[24:45] going to prepare a place this morning
[24:47] he's prepared the place this morning for
[24:50] us for me and you this morning it's the
[24:52] grace of God but he said is he going to
[24:54] do it he's going to prepare a place
[24:57] and it says but when the man went up
[24:59] verse 31 with him it said we are not
[25:02] able to go against see listen I think
[25:04] that's how people act today well hey
[25:05] brother well you know I'm going through
[25:07] this trial I don't think I'm going to
[25:08] make it yes you're going to make it the
[25:11] Bible says we are Overcomers we're
[25:13] conquerors we're more than conquerors
[25:17] and it says we are not able to go up
[25:19] against the people for they are stronger
[25:21] than we and they brought up an evil
[25:22] report and I believe we live in a day
[25:24] that's just nothing but evil violence
[25:27] it's perfect every every sickness you
[25:30] could think of or immorality everything
[25:32] you could see is the past tense out
[25:34] there they want to tell you evil reports
[25:36] you can't have this you can have
[25:38] everything in Jesus Christ
[25:40] if you took on his name you're the Bride
[25:42] of Jesus Christ and you are missed Jesus
[25:45] Christ this morning
[25:48] but he goes he says evil reported in the
[25:50] land verse 32 which they have searched
[25:52] into the children of Israel saying the
[25:55] land thou which we we have gone to
[25:57] search he said is a lamb that's eaten up
[25:59] with inhabitants thereof and all the
[26:01] people that we saw in it are men of
[26:03] great stature and there was they saw a
[26:06] giant they saw the Giants and the sons
[26:08] in it hey which have come it says Giants
[26:11] and when we were in our own sights as
[26:13] Grasshoppers and so we are in this in
[26:16] their sight and I believe that's how we
[26:18] get sometimes we get before the devil
[26:19] the devil wants to lie to you and tell
[26:21] you something or tell you you don't have
[26:23] that land or these young people I'll see
[26:25] them come through prayer lines and say
[26:27] they're fighting this or fighting this
[26:28] Spirit or fighting this and you know
[26:30] what that's Justin but the LIE of the
[26:32] devil
[26:33] it's just the buff of the devil
[26:35] it's just the bluff because he knows
[26:37] where you're going he's not after some
[26:39] people passing you see all these
[26:40] churches we come through here passing
[26:42] downtown we are blessed and you see all
[26:45] these churches passing and we have what
[26:47] we have in this day and what the
[26:48] evidence we have and you are the
[26:50] evidence this morning you are the fruit
[26:53] as they went back and they brought back
[26:55] the fruit Blood Brothers said they were
[26:56] so big a grapefruits of two men more
[26:58] than two men could take two men to pack
[27:00] it out over two million people they sent
[27:02] out spies but only two of them came went
[27:04] over the land and possessed it oh it's
[27:07] it's few in number this morning it's few
[27:09] but you know what Mighty is he that's in
[27:11] it that we're in Jesus Christ if you
[27:14] think about Noah there was eight in his
[27:15] day you think about he was just him and

[29:22] oh you gotta have a side buddy that
[29:25] believes the word of God that believes

[29:51] sister
[29:52] we got to have a side buddy this morning

[29:57] because he believed the words
[30:00] he said they went over into the Promised
[30:02] Land
[30:03] and he said I love what he says he says
[30:05] and they came back with a bunch of
[30:07] grapes he said that taking two men to
[30:09] pack see the prophet said he said now
[30:12] see that Israel will have the evidence
[30:14] before they even get into the promise
[30:16] see they'll have the evidence he says
[30:19] see they'll have the evidence that God
[30:21] said it's a good land it's filled with
[30:22] milk and honey it's the grand land the
[30:25] prophet said it's a good land he said
[30:27] now you're old he said all this old
[30:29] garlic leak and whatever you got here in
[30:31] Egypt he said now we're talk we're
[30:33] taking we're talking you taking you to a
[30:35] land with milk and honey you probably
[30:37] never tasted either one milk or honey
[30:40] down there in Egypt or all these years
[30:42] he said they just give you some slaves
[30:45] rationings
[30:47] he said but now you're going to this
[30:50] land
[30:51] he says so just at the moment moment
[30:54] time he said they got in about one Day's
[30:57] Journey where King is Born either the
[30:59] great judgment seat of the world was he
[31:01] said they stopped under this great poems
[31:03] out there that Springs and Camp he said
[31:06] now he said to let the people know
[31:08] brother Graham says watch what a perfect
[31:11] what a real perfect evidence it is
[31:14] how God does that he said just as he
[31:17] does today he said now God said the land
[31:20] is great
[31:21] he said now before you could go over I
[31:24] want you to see the land is great he
[31:26] said go bring me back some evidence of
[31:29] that land and show it to the people
[31:32] and I'm so thankful that we had a
[31:35] prophet go before our day and tell you
[31:37] how hell was going to be how he saw the
[31:39] pain the painted eyes and then he went
[31:42] over and saw the evidence of no he ain't
[31:44] seen Jesus Christ yet because he said
[31:46] he's just a little bit higher but he
[31:48] says he was still in that just imagine
[31:50] he didn't even got to see Jesus how much
[31:52] how how we need to strive to get to see
[31:55] Jesus Christ
[31:57] oh he just got to see even a glimpse and
[32:00] he still didn't want to go back in that
[32:02] body he still didn't want to go back so
[32:05] if your mother or father has passed away
[32:06] in Jesus Christ oh they're praising God
[32:09] right now I told my wife the other day
[32:11] we did Brother Paul we did a we had to

[34:36] higher

[34:39] the Lamb of the light he'll be the light
[34:41] of the city think about it one day
[34:43] that's what you're striving for this
[34:45] morning that's what you keep pressing
[34:47] through battles that's why you're going
[34:49] through heartaches that's why you're
[34:50] going through trials that's why if
[34:52] Monday comes is another trial there's a
[34:55] you lose a job or whatever it is or you
[34:57] keep pressing if someone tells you to
[34:58] quit singing or or do this I tell you to
[35:01] keep singing for Jesus Christ I tell you
[35:03] to keep pressing on for Jesus Christ if
[35:05] it's in Jesus name you keep doing it
[35:10] but I thought about everybody just show
[35:12] up for a funeral show up for this but I
[35:14] tell you what I'll tell you it's good to
[35:16] be in the house of God

[35:46] I have to go I have to be some guy but
[35:48] you know what as you come into church
[35:49] you need your tanks filled up
[35:52] we need your tanks filled up and that's
[35:54] not just by sitting you know what thank
[35:55] God bless you for the the the the sound
[35:58] system and the and the the visual audio
[36:00] but I tell you what the devil with this
[36:02] covert has put us in a different mindset
[36:04] where we can watch church or anywhere we
[36:06] can just watch it in our I'm just going
[36:07] here I don't know why but you know we
[36:09] just we just want to sit in the comfort
[36:11] of our home

[36:16] want to drink some coffee and just kind
[36:18] of sip on some coffee in our pajamas
[36:21] I'm not saying if you're sick my wife is
[36:23] today
[36:24] but I'm saying if you're sick praise God
[36:26] God bless you it's wonderful to have
[36:29] I said but there's nothing like being in
[36:31] The Presence of Jehovah because spirit
[36:34] said in five minutes of time with Moses
[36:36] five minutes time changed his life took
[36:39] away his teachings took away everything
[36:41] that he learned five minutes at the
[36:44] burning bush sometimes we just need a
[36:46] burning bush experience we need the
[36:48] presence of God we need to take all the
[36:50] formality off of us and just lay our
[36:53] hair down forsake and say God I'm going
[36:55] to serve you whatever happens today I'm
[36:57] going to praise you
[36:59] oh we can go to a ball game and
[37:01] get excited we could go here and get
[37:03] excited we should be some excited people
[37:05] in this place today that we have
[37:07] evidence of that land
[37:12] oh the police will tell me say Daddy I
[37:14] got excited a little ball game one time
[37:16] they told me I got excited one day at
[37:19] the ball game and my boy said hey I just
[37:21] wanna hi bro Daddy I hope you do that in
[37:23] church on Sunday I said you just better
[37:25] watch out cause here I come
[37:27] I said because I love Jesus more than
[37:30] that bag of there I said what he's done
[37:33] for me what he's brought me from what
[37:35] he's brought you from diabetes cancer
[37:38] whatever it is he's going to heal you if
[37:41] you don't get your healing here you'll
[37:43] get it over there
[37:44] [Applause]
[37:49] oh praise God
[37:51] oh he's worthy of our Praises he's
[37:54] worthy of our praises
[37:56] oh you know what they say Chris you're
[37:58] just crazy I said I'd be like brother
[37:59] Brown just leave me away leave me that
[38:01] way
[38:02] just leave me that way
[38:05] leave me that way I'm happier this way
[38:07] than I was the other way
[38:11] I love what he says
[38:13] the prophet says he said now always he
[38:15] said when you come to bring back the in
[38:17] evidence there the enemy lays in the
[38:20] road
[38:22] he lays in the road
[38:24] I'm looking what he says he says when
[38:26] some of them follow fellows looked over
[38:29] and seen those great Giants of Canaan oh
[38:31] my
[38:32] Prophet said we can't do it
[38:36] he said he said they said we can't do it
[38:38] he said but they brought back the
[38:40] evidence that the lamb was there
[38:43] he said they had been been falsely LED
[38:47] aren't you thankful that you're not
[38:49] being falsely LED but you got a pastor
[38:51] today that stands up it stands for this
[38:53] message of the hour
[38:55] stands for this truth no matter you know
[38:57] they got this nonsense there's not a
[38:59] cloud there's not a bridge they didn't
[39:00] fall you know what that's nonsense to me
[39:03] you either believe it 100 or get out
[39:07] brother I said 99 is still alive but I'm
[39:10] here to tell you I'm like sister how do
[39:12] you write brother Brown that ain't
[39:14] nothing but the truth everything you
[39:16] said everything you pointed is to is
[39:19] nothing but the truth
[39:21] you show me somebody that went God saw
[39:23] the evidence of that other land
[39:25] show me that someone when he brought
[39:27] back Millions hundreds of thousands of
[39:29] people with stretchers pulled off and he
[39:32] would bring them up for him and tell him
[39:33] and then he would change the address and
[39:35] say your address changed
[39:38] your address changed but then to be so
[39:42] humble where the prophets so humble that
[39:44] he would iron his suit in his car to get
[39:47] out this message
[39:50] he went right through brother Billy upon
[39:52] them would say they would take his suit
[39:53] and we would run it through the side of
[39:55] the seat to even get the wrinkles out
[39:59] just for me and you to hear a message
[40:02] to point us back to Jesus Christ
[40:04] this point is back not the brother
[40:06] Branham not to the man but to the god in
[40:09] the man the god in the man
[40:13] he said can't you see today he said that
[40:16] you're all drive a thousand miles to
[40:17] hear the word and watch it being proved
[40:20] and confirmed it's the evidence of a
[40:23] great land
[40:25] he said you could see a shadow of a man
[40:27] laying dying with cancer be made whole
[40:30] he said and we see the words of God he
[40:33] said that he spoke happening today but
[40:35] being confirmed it's evidence that keeps
[40:38] his word
[40:40] evidence that keeps his word
[40:43] aren't you thankful
[40:46] God commissioning Moses 1953. he says
[40:50] Joshua and Caleb he said they went over
[40:52] he said I like that I like that thought
[40:54] were there he said when they came over
[40:56] they 10 came but come back and said oh
[40:58] we look like grasshoppers on the side of
[41:01] them Joshua and Caleb said we can do it
[41:03] we can do it that's right
[41:05] he said God promised we could do it God
[41:08] said we could do it God promised our
[41:11] fathers that we was going that was our
[41:14] land and that belongs to us
[41:16] he said no matter if you got walled
[41:19] cities and they look like Giants and
[41:22] everything else
[41:24] so no matter what you're going through
[41:25] no matter what world city you got today
[41:27] in your mind or in your whatever you're
[41:29] going through you know what it's nothing
[41:31] but the bluff of devil
[41:33] it's nothing but because the devil's
[41:35] just a bluff he's just broke him up and
[41:36] said he's just a perverter he just
[41:39] perverts the word he's got no power but
[41:42] you know what my sister Gabby was
[41:43] singing there's probably when they were
[41:44] singing power in the name of Jesus to
[41:47] break every chain to break every
[41:49] sickness he's already broke every
[41:51] sickness he's broke Every Chain he's
[41:54] been raised he's done he's sitting in
[41:56] Heavenly places and he controls
[41:58] everything
[41:59] aren't you thankful that our control
[42:01] teller today is Jesus Christ and he's in
[42:04] evidence in their land he's in that city
[42:06] building a place he said I went away to
[42:09] prepare a place aren't you thankful
[42:11] that's where we're going
[42:13] and if you're not ready and you haven't
[42:15] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[42:16] provoke you to get into Jesus Christ
[42:19] I said get in Jesus Christ I say give
[42:22] your heart to Jesus Christ because this
[42:24] world will sell you the devil will put
[42:26] you on the side of this road and run
[42:28] over you and laugh at you he's done it
[42:30] to me he'll run over laugh at you and
[42:33] keep on going
[42:35] but Jesus Christ will come by and pick
[42:37] you up
[42:38] and say there's one of my sir there's
[42:41] one of my Lambs I'll leave the 99 for
[42:44] one
[42:46] oh but there's that one still we're
[42:48] looking for
[42:49] that's that one that we just got to
[42:51] bring in one day it's coming soon church
[42:54] I believe it I believe we're right here
[42:56] at the finish line
[42:58] and I believe if your loved ones could
[43:00] tell you that today of the day and they
[43:01] were over in that land they could say
[43:03] hey keep pressing on
[43:06] I keep pressing on if they just look
[43:08] through the curtain of time right now
[43:09] and just pull the curtain back they
[43:11] would tell you to keep pressing on like
[43:12] they did Brother Brian they'd say sister
[43:14] Sherry keep pressing on brother Paul
[43:17] keep pressing on oh you don't want to
[43:19] miss this for the world you don't want
[43:21] to miss this place for the world you
[43:23] keep pressing on no matter what the
[43:25] trials of the devil brings you no matter
[43:26] what sickness the land brings you you
[43:28] know what one day we're gonna come to
[43:30] the river brother said when you get down
[43:32] to the river that's where the devil
[43:34] stops and then he carries this over to a
[43:36] Promised Land that's flowing with milk
[43:38] and honey and I'm telling you keep
[43:41] pressing on today pre-pressing on keep
[43:43] giving all you got and you serve god
[43:46] with everything that's in you
[43:52] he said he quit looking at the Giants
[43:54] and started looking at God's word
[43:57] and when men and women quit looking at
[43:59] their sickness and diseases and start
[44:01] looking at what God said about it you'll
[44:03] take you'll you'll you'll it'll take
[44:06] over he said amen and things are subject
[44:08] to Jesus Christ
[44:11] he said in all things are subject to you
[44:14] in prayer
[44:16] when you ask in his name and believe
[44:19] amen
[44:21] he said ask what you will in his name in
[44:24] my name and it'll be done that's right
[44:26] brother said whatsoever things you
[44:29] desire When you pray believe you receive
[44:31] him and you shall have it
[44:33] but just because you pray that Jesus
[44:35] Christ and just like I said you got any
[44:37] good father if Isaac asked for something
[44:39] I know it's going to take him to the
[44:40] world any good father is going to pray
[44:41] about it
[44:43] before they just give it to him
[44:45] just like any father you know we think
[44:47] hey our God we need this today maybe you
[44:49] don't need it
[44:51] maybe it'll take you farther away from
[44:52] the world
[44:54] maybe if you gave you a big old job with
[44:56] a bunch of money he'd take you farther
[44:57] away from the world
[44:59] think about it
[45:02] but then you see all these people that
[45:03] move away and there's not even a they're
[45:05] not even a church nearby they'll take a
[45:07] job I don't understand this they'll take
[45:09] a job Millions miles away make more
[45:11] money and there's not even they just go
[45:13] spiritually dead
[45:15] I'd Rather Have Nothing I'd rather live
[45:18] in a soap box just to come in the
[45:20] presence of God every Sunday every
[45:22] Wednesday to support the church the
[45:24] support of ministry to support this
[45:26] message of the hour I'd rather have
[45:28] nothing to live inside my car than be
[45:30] somewhere that doesn't have a church or
[45:33] because you have evidence this morning
[45:34] you should something on the inside
[45:36] saying Lord tell whatever it is take it
[45:38] from me Lord make me more like you
[45:41] strive for that purpose
[45:44] strive for that purpose
[45:50] he says God says so he said let nothing
[45:53] stand in your way
[45:54] program said stop looking at things
[45:57] where you're looking at here look at the
[45:59] Unseen
[46:01] look at the Unseen but you know what it
[46:04] takes something on the inside to look at
[46:06] the Unseen people look at you when
[46:09] you're out and about they'll say Chris
[46:10] what are you looking at you're singing
[46:12] songs we're going through hard times
[46:13] you're full of joy I said because it's
[46:16] on the inside
[46:17] are seriously groaning on the inside
[46:20] it's their soul crying out for adoption
[46:23] today it's like you know what the devil
[46:25] can't do nothing to me that he that he
[46:27] doesn't allow
[46:28] think about it program talks about how
[46:31] job you think about it he had job his
[46:34] wife cursed him said curse God
[46:37] he was there with Bulls all over him
[46:39] scraping balls off of them lost
[46:40] everything you think about we go through
[46:42] trials sometimes scraping balls off of
[46:45] them oh all in a bad place
[46:48] and he still got down and said I serve
[46:50] you Lord
[46:52] think about it
[46:55] because there was something on the
[46:57] inside that knew there was evidence of
[47:00] that land
[47:01] there was something I'm here to tell you
[47:03] this morning if you don't get anything
[47:04] else you keep pressing on
[47:07] you keep starving no matter what they
[47:09] say no matter what their critics say and
[47:11] you know what's so funny they create
[47:12] this websites and this this junk that I
[47:14] don't even look at I don't even give it
[47:16] one that one iota show me one place they
[47:18] were Vindicated
[47:20] show me one place they're medicated then
[47:22] I look at it
[47:23] but then their life's right up
[47:26] they're out in the world they pull
[47:28] someone out of these you hear this and
[47:29] that and they get out of this I'm
[47:30] talking about the land they get away
[47:31] from church they get on the one going
[47:33] here but they get away
[47:36] I'm telling you young people do not keep
[47:38] your eyes on the word of God
[47:40] and you believe every scripture you go
[47:42] from Jesus to Revelation you get a Bible
[47:45] foundation and then you will you see why
[47:47] the message where the Prophet comes out
[47:49] of the Bible
[47:51] don't do it the other way don't learn
[47:53] just a bunch of quotes and don't learn
[47:54] this Bible
[47:55] you get your priorities in line and you
[47:58] trust every word I tell my boys I said
[48:00] we're going to learn Genesis the
[48:02] Revelation and why we believe what we
[48:04] believe because they're going to pull
[48:06] you out the devils in hell are going to
[48:08] say this and say that but you can say
[48:10] the Bible says the Bible says he's going
[48:14] to send your prophet in our day and
[48:16] that's what he sent you
[48:20] but when you get a Bible base and when
[48:23] you get a Bible Foundation ain't nothing
[48:25] going to stand in their way ain't never
[48:27] there when that Foundation is done and
[48:30] we're building houses I build houses
[48:31] sometimes and we have to dig so deep to
[48:33] get Divergent soil to pour the Footers
[48:36] you need a strong footer today you need
[48:39] a strong footer and the only footer that
[48:41] you need is this Bible and it needs to
[48:43] be your foundation in your home it needs
[48:46] to be everything that you got and your
[48:48] foundation needs to be in Jesus Christ
[48:51] it's got to be your father today
[48:53] and it can't be the other way around I'm
[48:56] not hating on the message in any way God
[48:58] bless it I'm thankful for it we wouldn't
[49:00] have the eyes to see this if we didn't
[49:03] I'm just telling you we got to get our
[49:05] priorities straight
[49:07] he pointed us to the Bible and you've
[49:09] got to learn the front and the back of
[49:10] this cover this is your instruction
[49:12] manual
[49:13] but a lot of times we don't get it
[49:15] enough
[49:16] we don't read it enough we're on
[49:18] Facebook too much we're on Instagram you
[49:19] know what I say get your face in this
[49:22] book and don't play Facebook Facebook
[49:24] this
[49:26] make this your Facebook
[49:28] get your face in this book because it's
[49:31] filled with milk and honey everything
[49:33] you had need of is in the word of God
[49:35] he's already paid for it he's gave us
[49:37] the evidence of that land you just have
[49:40] to accept it this morning you have to
[49:42] claim every healing that you need it's
[49:44] already paid on Calvary
[49:46] it's already paid
[49:55] Romans 8 you want to turn there for time
[49:56] 8 or 8 37 39 they said nay and all these
[50:00] things we are more than conquerors
[50:01] through him that loved us
[50:04] for I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[50:07] life this is me right here I just want
[50:08] to I told her I want to put this poet
[50:10] just right up on my by my office before
[50:12] I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[50:15] life nor angels nor principalities no
[50:17] powers nor things presence nor things to
[50:19] come nor Heights nor death nor website I
[50:22] just say website whatever it is so
[50:24] whatever it is nor death nor any other
[50:26] creatures shall be able to separate us
[50:29] from the love of God
[50:31] from the love if you're truly a bride of
[50:34] Christ this morning I'm not trying to
[50:35] add to it but I'm here I'm just
[50:37] paraphrasing but nothing should separate
[50:40] you from the love of this truth and the
[50:42] love of this message
[50:45] and you know what you need to line it up
[50:46] if they tell you to go check this check
[50:48] this check their life
[50:50] see if they're serving God
[50:52] these people put this stuff in this
[50:54] website that makes my soul just it just
[50:57] it makes me want to throw up
[50:59] they want to say this and say that I
[51:01] want to say where were they were and
[51:02] when brother Brandon was here
[51:04] the same people fell over his feet and
[51:06] had to ask them to get hey you come
[51:07] escort this man off my feet
[51:10] because they challenged the Holy Spirit
[51:13] they challenged and you know what
[51:15] they're still healing on the tapes we're
[51:16] listening to a tape the other day or we
[51:18] were reading a a thing the other day and
[51:20] the boys were sick for two weeks and I
[51:22] opened the opened the Bible we started
[51:23] reading and we turned right to a message
[51:25] and they probably called out their
[51:26] sickness
[51:29] the Holy Spirit fell in that house and
[51:31] completely healed my boys
[51:34] there's healing in this message they're
[51:36] healing in this Bible and I'll tell you
[51:38] what the boys completely got healed
[51:44] in the mighty conqueror
[51:46] 1958 he said he pulled back the curtains
[51:49] so that we could look past the curtain
[51:51] of time
[51:52] he pulled back every Bluff of the devil
[51:56] he said he fully paid the price
[51:59] he said and tonight he's the Conqueror
[52:02] and the Bible said that we are more than
[52:04] conquerors through him who loved us
[52:08] Who Loved Us
[52:10] think about it went through Iowa we're
[52:11] coming to Christmas now think about it
[52:14] they think about where he went they
[52:16] didn't go where he thought he would go
[52:18] think about he born in a manger
[52:20] think about it they thought he was going
[52:22] to come a certain way
[52:24] well Jesus Christ don't come as what
[52:26] they think the world thinks is going to
[52:27] come
[52:28] hey we already had a prophet in our land
[52:30] come and these people are looking for
[52:32] this or looking for that Prophet they're
[52:33] looking but you're blessed to see it
[52:35] today
[52:36] you are blessed to have the evidence of
[52:38] that land
[52:41] he said fully paid the price and tonight
[52:43] he's the Conqueror and the Bible said
[52:45] that we are more than conquerors through
[52:47] him it says so every Christian in here
[52:49] tonight he has the thing under he said
[52:52] tonight has the thing under control
[52:54] we've conquered sin we've conquered
[52:56] death we've conquered hell he said we've
[52:59] conquered the grave we conquered
[53:01] sickness because of Jesus is our Mighty
[53:04] conqueror
[53:06] Jesus is our Mighty conqueror
[53:11] he says the this word is the pardon this
[53:13] word was written for a parting to know
[53:16] that he is a mighty conqueror he said is
[53:18] a pardon to each of you if you receive
[53:21] it as a pardon
[53:23] you got to receive it as your pardon you
[53:26] got to accept it no matter what the
[53:27] devil tells you no matter what he says
[53:29] hey you can't have it you know what
[53:31] you've already got it if you're in Jesus
[53:32] Christ you see what you see
[53:35] I tell you why I was telling my dad the
[53:37] other day and I'll call him I'll say Dad
[53:39] how you doing or this and that he'll say
[53:40] son you still believe in it

[53:46] truth
[53:47] I said Dad I'll go to my dying grave
[53:50] believe in just like sister had he
[53:52] writes
[53:53] I said because there was a seed to be
[53:55] watered one day
[53:56] there was a seed to be watered one day
[53:58] and then I finally got to see and what
[54:00] brother Brown went over the evidence of
[54:02] that land and now we got we're partakers
[54:04] of that land
[54:06] every one of you are partakers of that
[54:08] land
[54:09] you're going to be partakers of a land
[54:11] that's flowing with milk and honey whole
[54:13] word with a lamb is the light
[54:17] oh so I tell you not to give up
[54:19] I'll tell you not to give up and keep
[54:21] striving
[54:23] but there's going to be trials and we'll
[54:25] read this as the musicians come today
[54:39] I love what Psalms 121 says one through
[54:42] eight
[54:43] says well I lift up my eyes into the
[54:46] Hills
[54:47] from rent's cometh my help
[54:50] my health
[54:51] Cometh From The Lord
[54:54] it says which made in heaven and earth
[54:56] he will not suffer thy foot to be moved
[55:00] he that keepeth he said thy will not
[55:03] slumber
[55:04] love it behold
[55:06] he that keepeth Israel shall never
[55:08] slumber nor sleep
[55:09] it said the Lord is thy keeper
[55:13] I just said Lord that is the truth
[55:16] The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right
[55:18] hand
[55:20] thy son shall not Spike thy there by day
[55:23] nor by Moon by night
[55:25] the Lord shall preserve thy from from
[55:28] all from all evil aren't you thankful
[55:32] he shall preserve thy soul
[55:35] the Lord shall preserve thy going out
[55:37] and thy coming in from this time forth
[55:39] and ever Evermore
[55:43] so he's an all-knowing God
[55:46] he knows who he's coming for this
[55:48] morning
[55:49] he's coming for a bride
[55:52] and he's going away he said he went away
[55:54] to prepare a place
[55:56] that we're not worthy of
[55:58] even the prophet said if he set my soul
[56:00] the hell I'd still serve my Lord
[56:03] I said I never understood that statement
[56:05] I told my wife that I never understood
[56:07] the statement my brother Graham says I'd
[56:10] still serve my God
[56:13] but you know what it took many years to
[56:14] get in this word of God
[56:16] and to become it become a love language
[56:22] and start to fall in love with the
[56:23] author
[56:25] you know and I could actually say today
[56:27] if you set my soul hell I'd still serve
[56:29] my God
[56:30] for all he's done for me he's done
[56:32] nothing but good brother Paul
[56:36] his benefits weigh out your 401K it pays
[56:39] out anything you could ever accomplish
[56:40] in this world
[56:42] whatever he's whatever you think you
[56:44] guys it's going to burn up one day
[56:47] but you know what one day it's gonna be
[56:49] like the three Hebrew children
[56:50] they walked in that fiery fungus brother
[56:52] Brown said they couldn't burn the Holy
[56:54] Spirit out of him didn't matter how much
[56:56] how hot they got it
[56:58] seven times harder it was killing the
[57:00] guards they were throwing them in there
[57:02] but it didn't matter
[57:04] because the fourth man had to show up
[57:07] and he if he hadn't showed up in your
[57:09] life and he ain't in your life I
[57:11] encourage you today to get them in your
[57:13] life
[57:15] to get them in your life let him reign
[57:18] in every aspect of your life your job
[57:21] everything let him be it all in all
[57:23] first let him be first place not your
[57:26] wife not your husband not your kids but
[57:29] Jesus Christ first
[57:32] and everything else will be added
[57:34] everything else will be added I'll tell
[57:37] you why my wife left her job many years
[57:39] ago she was a pharmacist
