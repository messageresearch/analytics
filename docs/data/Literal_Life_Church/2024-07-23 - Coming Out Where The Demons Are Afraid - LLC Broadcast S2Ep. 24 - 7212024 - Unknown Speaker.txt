been so good thank you Lord got a reason to pra give him a praise re Mark chapter 5 and they come over unto other side of the sea into the country of the gines and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with change I just want to just uh identify in the scripture things that stories like this that are told but there's always a meaning and something behind the story that we can learn and for a man that had an unclean spirit and he came out of the tombs we realize to meet Jesus he's dwelling among the tombs uh that's not a good place to be dwelling if you're wanting to be set free because that he had been often bound with feathers and chains and the chains had been plucked under by him and the feathers broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones interesting cutting himself with stones but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adure Thee by God that thou torment me not did you wondering what's happening now that the demons are talking through this man now and they're saying for Jesus to leave them alone because now that this man has come in the presence of Christ the demons are tormented that's right before the demons were tormenting the man but once he comes in the presence of the Lord the demons become tormented that's right for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is Legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the Devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forth withth Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the sea and they were about 2,000 and were choked in the sea and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city excuse me they that fed the swine fled and told it in the the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done and they came to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion and they seen him sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid and they saw it they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine and they begin to pray him to depart out of their coast and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him how be it Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee and hath compassion on thee and he departed and begin to publish in docis how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did Marvel I want to speak this morning on coming out where the demons are afraid and um I I want to just continue on the you know I've been talking about freedom in Christ and being really free that Jesus Christ has unlimited freedom for the human being and uh I'm kind of trying to find a place to end it and move on but this just keeps opening up so this will be real simple today uh I believe everyone that's here can get a hold of something here because it would just make it real simple the scripture is simple this story is simple and yet we have to believe that our Lord is the same this morning here in this building as he was back then and that is he is able to set a man free that is so you realize now when it gave the number of the swine that all the demons went into uh that was quite a few swine and all the demons that went into all of those swine those pigs all of them were living in one man so that's quite a few demons to deal with that's quite a bit of Torment demon another word for demon is a Tormentor and that's quite a bit of Torment for one man to have living within him and so I want to I want to speak and elaborate on and just break down this story a little bit this morning and the first thing that we must understand from this is demons are real the devil is real and and and and you you wouldn't think you'd have to start out that basic but today you do because people don't believe that anymore they don't believe that there's another dimension with uh angels in that other dimension and there's another dimension with demons in those dimensions and so we don't see those with our naked eye today but nevertheless Christians know that it's true Christians know that it's true because the Bible said it that is our absolute but they know it's true because they know that we wrestle not against flesh and blood you can go have a fight a physical fight with somebody uh but you would never resolve their real problems or your real problems because there's another dimension we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers poers and spiritual wickedness in high places Christians know that this is real not just because the Bible says it but but they know it's real because they're when they're trying to serve the Lord there's something fighting against them and so they know that it is true that there is real demons there is a real devil and he is real he's a person and uh the devil's trust is to try to keep a human being from the presence of the Lord why would he keep a human being from the presence of the Lord because then he can keep them tormented he can keep them bound and as long as they stay away from the presence of the Lord then he can keep them tormented because that is his agenda he wants a keep a person uh bound he wants to keep a person tormented agitated irritated never fully happy never never fully enjoying life always under either the guilt of of sin or under the guilt or maybe under condemnation but maybe it's not that maybe just Bound by something that they just can't get rid of a habit and they're just Bound by it Satan loves for people to stay bound I don't know why I I know that he knows what it means to be bound himself but he just that's the agitation he gives he doesn't like the human being to be set free he doesn't like a human being to be fully truly happy in Christ he doesn't want this full happiness and yet Satan sells his stuff by giving human beings what they they think is real happiness but I've been elaborating on this series to show you that when he presents his stuff it is temporal it seems to go back into things I've read you scientific things to show you that they have proved that even some of the helps that they have is only temporary it never deals to bring a person to complete happiness it never does that's because they haven't solved the thing that that when you come into the presence of the Lord that it's not just his word it's not just his laws that he gives but he actually has something greater for you and that he wants to set the human being free of any bondage he's so done his job to present things that the bondage is scripture and bondage is the law and bondage of the message and I I say I hate to credit Satan but he's done a a quite a job quite a decent job of convincing Minds that everything that God has has for us is to bring us in bondage that is terrible for him to present that because it's actually the biggest lie that you can tell a human being no there is no other full complete freedom and happiness for a human being than in Jesus Christ you see to me this morning I'll just drop in my personal testimony when I look at this Bible now and I thank God that I can look at it right because I've been through a lot of things that I could be influenced by something that taints this Bible and taints this presence and taints this message but somehow by his grace when I look at this when I look at the message when I look at being in the presence of the Lord when I look at all of this I don't see one ounce of bondage so maybe it's just how you're looking at it I can't get my mind wrapped around somebody concluding that way how could God send something God God our God our creator how could he be sending us something that would bring us under bondage maybe it's how you're interpreting it maybe it's how Satan interpreted all I know is there's enough scriptures and enough things that come from God that he wants us to be happy and free he wants us to be satisfied he wants us to be content can you say Amen but when you're dealing with demons uh it's a whole another realm because they're so subtle and they they don't look that and you know when you talk about de today uh Christ is the one that he's really the only one that can expose them or call them out they are so hidden and they're given different names today they're polished up they're watered down even the term demon is watered down I can't hardly use it we can't hardly use it because it's justo too scary for people it's it but but you see that term demons is not scary to a Believer why why is it not scary to a Believer because we have something greater otherwise wise it's scary otherwise it's overwhelming when I talk about it this morning it would be overwhelming to see that this power of the enemy has this much power over man that he's cutting himself that he's breaking through chains they can't hold him he's dwelling amongst the tombs he can't even be with his family anymore he's come to and I use this extreme scripture to show how far the devil can take you do you know that the only reason some people don't go that far in their torment is because they have chains maybe of psychology of certain things that hold them back from going all the way they had to put this man on the in these tombs and he dwell there because he was killing people and he was hurting people he was hurting his family and so sometimes you can restrain somebody but even his restraints even his restraints he'd break them off but he had to go somewhere this is an extreme case but he had to go somewhere to show us that how far the enemy wants to take somebody by being bound oh yeah but the worst case when they come in the presence of the Lord everything changes but God calls demons for what they are people get offended when you label something demon possession oh my uh it's not a possession it's just a problem well some problems have demons behind it some don't but you have to really pray to find out you don't want to be stepping out saying you got a demon be careful you tell your teenager you got a demon be careful uh you better make sure of that I didn't expect to say some of this this morning but listen you better be careful what you're saying and and seek the Lord can you say amen amen but sometimes we know the reality of somebody being becoming demon possessed and uh that is a term also that doesn't like so it's just a problem well find out if it's just a problem or find out if it's a demon you have to find out but I just want to you notice about this now until the son of man came there was really no power for this man there was no power big enough or great enough for these demons until the son of man came and he came I want you to notice something in the scripture he did not go into the graveyard he did not go into the tombs he did did does not dwell there as such but he put himself in a place that was close enough took a boat across had to stop by here this certain Mountain he gets across and I don't know he got gets out on the beach or whatever but he puts himself himself Within High distance of this man that was possessed he doesn't dwell amongst the tomb Jesus does not dwell amongst the dead and so if you notice the story he puts himself so this man can see Jesus a far off but he does Place himself where they he can see Jesus and when he sees Jesus he has to come away and quit hanging around the dead and get where Jesus is you have to make a move to quit hanging around places where demons can just keep tormenting I want help I want help I got this i got this i got this do you really want to be free do you really want help and this man had to run out of the graveyard out of the atmosphere he was in because he was hanging around the wrong atmosphere for him to be free if you really really want to be free then you've got to stop hanging around the wrong atmospheres the wrong people you got to stop hang stop hanging around the wrong atmosphere you got to stop feeding on the wrong things for two reasons it's not good for you but if you have demons and things that are tormenting you and you say I want to be free there's no way that Jesus can do that when you stay in the atmospheres you're in there has to be a movement for you to move towards Christ and get in his presence now that man did not deliver himself he had no power to deliver himself but once he got into the presence of Christ then something could be done and there's only one power great enough it is the son of man that that that until he came there was really no power over the demons how many would agree with me that whatever he did here to this man he's in the building this morning and he's able to do it again or he's not God he can either do this again or he's not God and the message came came to prove to us he can do it again he can do it again he's living the son of man is living he's present among us today and so but you see now one thing is it is never it it never lets demons feel comfortable it exposes them when you come into the presence of the Lord there's a characteristic of his presence and that he'll never let the demons be comfortable it exposes them Satan hates this Revelation in that people become free in this Revelation and it has power this word has power to kick the devil out I just want to mention something about the devil's history and I and I'm going to conclude by saying this that every we need to know that we have power through Christ into his name to kick the devil out he gave power over the church to cast out devils not because of us but he gave us power so so I I would just say kick him out because when you go into the devil's history he was kicked out of heaven before we even come along he was kicked out of heaven with a third of the angels He was kicked out of the Garden of Eden he was kicked out of the camp when ishmail came along cast out the Bond woman and her son he he was kicked out of the camp in Exodus and Deuteronomy it says I will cast out the nations from before thee and then he says I will cast out the enemy for thee David said I will cast out the Heathen be from before thee and so you have this whole history of the Enemy being kicked out from the very beginning he was kicked out Proverbs 22 says cast out the scorner I want everybody to listen to this uh Home Folks and and local people you know like that are part of a local body this says cast out the scorner and contention shall go away because it's the scorner and it's the one just keeps finding things to be critical of that brings contention in the body cast out the scorner and contention shall go out ye strife and reproach shall cease Ma I was just adding that one in Proverbs 22:10 Matthew 18:16 when we get to the New Testament when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick Matthew 20 excuse me Matthew 12:28 but if I cast out Devils interesting thing that what Jesus says if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you how do we know the kingdom of God has come nigh because it's casting out devils in Luke 11:20 he words it this way he he says I if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God then you know that the kingdom of God is at hand you ever notice he says I'm casting out Devils just with the Finger of God if his finger has that much power how much does the rest of the body of Christ have then he gave his church commission to cast out devils and they were kicking him out throughout history the devil has been kicked out kicked out kicked out of heaven at the beginning kicked out the church kicked him out they had power to kick him out and look what his final end is Revelations 12:7 there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down he's finally been ultimately cast out and he accused them before God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and now here's the prophecy that one day he'll be completely kicked out he was kicked out at the beginning he's been kicked out all through the Bible and he's going to be kicked out at the end I say if that's his history and that's his future why can't you give him the boot every now and then kick him out he's used to it kick him out of your home kick him out of your spirit kick him out of your attitude kick him out of your life he's used to it he don't like it but that's his history and that's his future giving the boo now dwelling among the tombs this is where this man was this is where people hang out with demons you can't hang out with the wrong C crowd in dead spiritual people and think right if you're around dead spiritual people you can't think right if you want to be free the first step is to get away from stuff and people that do and say stupid things this world is making things more insane it's an insane world and and we find that even amongst Christian churches Things become a bit insane I only say that because it's not sound gospel anymore it's not sound thinking anymore it's not sound Doctrine anymore so you can't hang around the wrong stuff and the wrong people that are saying stupid things you are not stupid but if you hang around them you will think stupid things it's it's true this all started with thinking process how did the man get you don't start being having a legion of demons within you you don't start that way it's when he W he become out of his right mind in other words he wasn't thinking right and Satan attacked his thoughts and he started to buy into that that's only goes One Direction and when he was delivered he sat there calm clothed and in his right mind what you hang around what you feed on if you want to be free of those things your proof that you want to be free is when Jesus is Calling you make a move towards him you have to come his way that's right and once you start coming you don't have to deliver yourself you don't have to deal with your problems yourself but you can't stay where Jesus is not and he's not amongst the Dead he's not amongst things that are dead he's not amongst thoughts that are dead or thoughts that are not clear sound thinking he's not there you have to come away from that this applies to every Christian this morning every unbeliever no matter I think this message is simple to apply to everyone the question is do you want to be free and if you want to be free you have to you have to come away I can preach about the freedom in Jesus Christ for weeks but if people aren't willing to change their life and come away from dead things you can't get anywhere for him to speak the word and all he has to do is speak it and that Demon's gone that torment that thing that's that's irritating me all it takes is just one more Jesus it's leave in Jesus name amen that's the atmosphere I want to be in and that's the kind of person I want to be as when the tormentors are afraid of what I have inside me they're afraid of me I think everybody here can find something this morning that was said that was truth I want I'm not going to be so arrogant to say that it's that it's all truth I I I I believe but it's not that I say it if it's the word it is the truth and the truth shall make you free and even if you can acknowledge that some of it Lord that would would be something that the Lord said and something for you for you even if you acknowledge that I'd go ahead and do it I'd go ahead and do it I would I would if you see Jesus a far off today I would run towards him I wouldn't run away from him thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us
