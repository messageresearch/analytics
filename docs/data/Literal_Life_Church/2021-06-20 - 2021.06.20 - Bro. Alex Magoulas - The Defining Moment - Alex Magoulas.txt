========================================

would like to turn this evening into the book of saint john the 12th chapter and we'll start in the 23rd the 23rd verse here and we'll go now to verse 3. god bless each one of the different young people and i see some different familiar faces as well trusting that the lord would bless each one amen god is faithful god is faithful saint john the 12th chapter and verse 23 as you've probably noticed already i'm no good at public speaking so i'm just going to try to get out of the way and preach now saint john 12 23 the bible says and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor verse 27 now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him jesus answered said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated i'd like to take a thought from my text this evening and i'd like to preach on the defining moment amen the defining moment and i think this scripture is a timely scripture for the hour that we live in god the father here speaking out of heaven he responds to the the uh the cry of jesus here uh you know father uh would i would i cry that he would save me from this hour he says but i came forth this our father glorify the name so god responds and he says i have both glorified my name and he said i'm gonna do it again and i believe it's relevant to us because i believe we are living in the hour when he has come and spoken by a voice to us the voice that we've heard in this day it's not just the voice of another man speaking but god has spoken unto us through a vindicated prophet in this generation and what has he declared he's declared the name of jesus christ that he would glorify his name once again amen i believe the name of god is glorified again today in the bride of jesus christ because the true nature of god has been revealed to us in his fullness amen there is a people on the face of the earth today i believe i'm looking at some of them tonight there's a people in the face of the earth today and they are the place that he has put his name they are his provided place of worship amen and just like in that day when god spoke some people said that they thought they heard the sound of thunder and they just preached the thunders of some sort of a carnal doctrine well we heard thunder somebody said well well the angels spoke we've had an angel speak to us in this day it's true but what we've heard is more than just the voice of a messenger amen we've got a vindicated thus saith the lord that has come and spoken to us from heaven amen i believe the words that we're feeding on tonight it's not the words of the man william branham it's more than just the angel that's spoken to us amen because the words of a man will fail us listen i was just saying a few moments ago i thank god for godly father's words as a man will fail my children my words as a man would fail you tonight but we're not feeding tonight on the words of a man we are feeding tonight on the unfailing body word of the son of man the same god that spoke back there in saint john 12 he has spoken to us in this generation i believe he's come to speak to us tonight because he wants to glorify his name in you and i amen and i'll remind you what jesus told him he said the voice that we've heard in this day it did not come from mike listen god's not confused about who he is god knows exactly who he is god sent the voice for your sakes so many young people raised around this message they hear the quotes they hear the tapes they hear the preaching and sometimes it's presented to them in a way where they think god's up to get him brother brandon was a young man he thought god was up he said god hated me but jesus loved me didn't realize it was the same person sometimes we look at the message we think it's a bunch of rules and ideas and quotes but i want to testify to you tonight as a young man that got saved through this message this message comes from my sake it's here for you he's not against you he's for you tonight if you're sitting here tonight hearing the message of the hour believing what god has said it's because it's for you you've got every reason to rejoice if god is for you tonight who can be against you hallelujah he knows who he is he's not saying it for himself he knows who he is he wants you to recognize who he is because who he is is who we are that's where we can have a boldness and stand and preach because as he is so are we in this world not just the world to come not 50 years in the future not in the days some by and by somewhere right now as a christian the word that spoke of the bridegroom spirits of this bride well praise the lord that'll make you feel pretty good i feel pretty good about that i was talking to brother the other day i said you know what god has said so many things about my life i would have never dared to say about myself how many even in our own lives sometimes we look at it and we question we look in the mirror god has said so many good things about you you couldn't presume to say about yourself when you think about the magnitude of what god has spoken over your life it astounds me he's given us every reason to succeed in the midst of satan's eating despite darkness despite confusion despite wickedness and listen you young people brother branham talked about it when he was an older man in the 50s and the 60s he said my children got so much more to deal with today than i had to deal with if it was that way 60 years ago what about today you see what are you getting at brother listen jesus had to make a decision amen he come to an hour and he said my desire i could look at it and say why am i in this hour you might look at it and say why am i in the midst of the darkest most perverse age there's ever been jesus looked at his own hour and listen maybe you're the same way tonight maybe you feel the same way you look at the day you live in you look at the hour that we're in and it troubles your soul it troubled jesus see the devil come along sometime to use a young person to say you know if you really believe this if you really believe the word you won't let all this stuff bother you but i want you to understand and even bother jesus jesus was troubled by the hour that he lived in sin what he saw witnessing the things that he saw don't let the devil discourage you about that because listen jesus was troubled about it but what did he say amen what'd he say should i should i ask for a deliverance from this hour but listen he said this is the hour i come there this hour that you're so troubled about this day and age which seems so filled with darkness and discouragement god put you here in this hour and he didn't just put you here because he had nowhere else to put you he didn't put you here because he ran out of somebody to come and work for him or do something and said well i guess i this is all i got left i got the reserve now he saved the best for last he said i'm going to put them in the midst of the darkest hour there's ever been on the face of the earth in the midst of satan's eden and they will not only just overcome they will thrive they will overcome every adversary they will choose my way which is the harder way not because of but despite satan's heathen they will choose to follow me they will overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony your young people don't be content tonight to rest on just brother branham's testimony or daddy's testimony or the pastor's testimony god wants you to have a testimony they stood the test of time they fought the good fight they pressed the battle when everybody else walked away when the orange sounded retreat they threw themselves into the battle who threw themselves about 13 year olds 14 year olds little davids and grown men when grown men don't want to fight when grown men don't want to stand for god anymore god's got some teenagers got some young people say i believe god david had a testimony i know what god can do i've watched him fight [Music] hallelujah jesus had to make a decision amen here's what i'm getting to with this amen i want you to think about this look think we we we rehearse the different miracles in jesus ministry we look at all the different testimonies and the things that he done we look at the healings and the prophecy and the miracles but i want you to understand jesus came to a place a defining moment amen where he had to surrender his will to the father every healing every miracle every prophecy it would have meant nothing if he didn't go to calvary amen we thank god for the healings we thank god for the miracles we we we embrace and expect those things because they're precious to us but unless this lamb of god went and he died at calvary it would have meant nothing those things testified of who he was he was defined when he embraced he took the stinger of death into him and rose again on the third day that showed once and for all this is that messiah that had been prophesied amen no death where is i sting a grave where is thy victory we've got one he rose from the dead on the third day death has lost its sting satan's lost his power he's defeated tonight we've got one he didn't just raise from the grave the grave but he ascended far above everything that's trying to beset you tonight every principality every power every every mind battle every temptation every addiction every little thing that the devil wants to send your way every time you walk through walmart every time you go to school every little stumbling block satan puts in your way he's got more stumbling blocks he's got more temptations than ever but god is not defeated he defeated it 2 000 years ago we've got one that's clear past the moon tonight amen we're not just trying to get out of our event we've done plum on into the unfailing realities of god tonight amen now think about this jesus this whole time he's been preaching to his disciples he said i'm the bread of life amen i am the true bread which has come down to the heaven but now he's speaking and saying except the corn of wheat and except the corn or wheat would die and go to the ground it would abide alone in other words he's preached about the bread but now he's preaching about the seed life because the seed life that was going to go on the ground was going to determine who you and i were amen the bible says in isaiah 55 that his word is bred to the eater but it's seed to the sower you say what are you getting at brother listen this is what i'm getting at god was going to sow a seed that day at calvary amen he took a seed of a son of god and he sowed that seed in confidence because he knew listen jesus had confidence in the word about him what brother ma'am say it was one prophecy by a man that was backslid when i get it you destroy this temple i will raise it up again if he had that much confidence about what the word said about him listen god knew when he put that seed in the ground amen look at farmer he don't i'm not a farmer now i don't have a green thumb or whatever i didn't get that from adam i guess hey man listen but i know one thing a farmer don't go out there and put a hundred thousand seeds or whatever in the field because he thinks they're not going to come back up he has an expectation that seed is going to come back up and when god put that sun on calvary and he was planted in the ground planted a borrowed tomb he had confidence that that seed would come up on the third day you say what are you getting abroad listen every seed must bring forth after its own kind listen god did not put a seed of a son of god in the ground with power and authority and righteousness and sinlessness and virtue he put that in the ground just to get a bunch of church members back listen god paid a great price he put a seat in the ground not to get a bunch of formal denominational people back that believe half the word amen he didn't put some hybrid in the ground he didn't put us on the ground just to get a bunch of cirrets under the butt of bulls and girls help me out somebody he put a son of god in the ground because he wanted sons of god and the same power the same likeness the same life the same ability he did not ordain anything less for you than the full manifestation of the son of god hallelujah that's why we're gonna have boldness as he is amen why it's the same seed yes it's the same life the prophet says many times you hear this on tape he says we live a million miles below our privileges amen i want to ask you not how far are you living below yours hey man half a half a million miles quarter somewhere we live below our privileges amen and why do we do it we do it because we choose to whether we realize it or not amen i was studying this on the way here and it's great because we come on samaria wrote i'm like yes it's a sign it was literally a science of samaria but i always loved this story because the bible tells us about a man by the name of jehu in the bible and the prophet elijah he'd given a prophecy about jezebel that she was going to be thrown down and the dogs would eat her up and she wouldn't even be buried and one day the prophet elijah come to a man a man by the name of jehu this man wasn't a royalty he wasn't a whatever just a guy but an anointed servant of god because of the prophecy of elijah came to him and he anointed him to be king amen and he anointed him to be king for a purpose listen god has called you to this life this kingdom for a purpose he said i'm going to call you for a purpose god has anointed you to destroy desert jezebel to fulfill the prophecy of the prophet elijah i'll tell you what i i just always love the story of jehu amen i tell you what they they take him and say he's going to be king and he hops in his chariot i don't know what he was driving that day amen maybe a mustang or something hey man and he hops in his chair and he gets his guys together and they're riding amen praise the lord somebody they start running down there towards jezebel where she's at and you've got joram the the king of uh of king of israel or no i'm sorry uh jordan's the king of yeah the king of israel it's her offspring he's down there and ahaza the king of judah they're all down there waiting and they see this little cloud of smoke up in the this guy all of a sudden and like who is this there's somebody coming this way so they said we need to find out what this is about is he coming for peace is he coming for war so he goes and grabs a message and says hey come here i want you to go over here and come here i want you to go over here and i want you to go and see are they coming for peace or war and so he runs over there and jay who's waiting on him amen this is all right i'm gonna dramatize just a little bit amen and he comes and the guy says are you here for peace he says why are you talking about peace we're not here for no look we don't ride in chariots for peace we're here for a reason we're here to destroy jezebel he says i tell you what get behind me turn your chariot around and follow me we're going to work so now he's got this guy and they're looking at the messenger saying well he didn't come back she said get another messenger i'm going to pick on you get another messenger send him down to the jehu jehu what's he up to so he goes out there and he's saying hey uh what are you doing here jay who have you come for peace man why is everybody talking about peace i mean we we don't need peace tonight we need somebody to stand up and fight listen he tells that second messenger i want you to get behind me and turn your chair around and follow me so now jehu i tell you what his arm is getting bigger all the time listen it started with one man being prophesied about but then another guy joins in and then another guy joins in before long he's got a whole host following him and they're looking they're saying man i don't know you can sit down sit down your chariot for a little bit hey man and after a while jorm's like what is going on every time we send a guy down to that church every time we send a guy down to that anointed prophecy they come they don't even come back they they join signs with it well praise the lord so finally jordan's like you know what i'm gonna go see what this is about i better go look at it myself so he writes down there he says listen have you come here for peace what are you doing here well let me say this if your enemy's asking for pieces because you don't want to fight you amen have you come for peace and i love it jehu he takes his bow and the bible says with his full strength he put his full strength into his bow he said how can we have peace when the whoredoms and the witchcrafts of your mother jezebel pollute this land listen he don't negotiate he don't he don't stop for no one but he's got a purpose he's anointed to destroy that woman jezebel and he drops that guy right in his chair and ahaziah sees it takes off he says cut him down don't let one get away listen god has anointed you as christians amen to destroy the works of that spirit of jezebel in the world today that's why a prophet come and preached against it the way he preached against it because there was going to be a bribe come on the earth she's ordained to overcome every antichrist system every distraction every difficulty every trial when the enemy comes your way you just turn him right around sticking behind you or run him over he's not stopping for anyone amen praise the lord somebody i tell you what he does we sing that song here just a little while ago they get they get joram he says i want you to take his body go throw him in naboth's vineyard you remember the story of naboth it happened jezebel had her had him killed because they wanted his inheritance they wanted his what god gave him they wanted to take it from him and they murdered that man to take it but jay who says we've not forgotten we've not forgotten what you did we've not forgotten your crimes we remember what you did to the people of god we remember what you did through the the inquisitions and the years of darkness we are not ignorant of satan's devices tonight help me out somebody listen i know what it's like to be under the hand of a taskmaster like the devil but i know what it's like to be set free by the power of jesus christ i can walk in newness of life tonight because he's made away from me i've got no desire to go back under the bondage of israel i've got no desire to live under jezebel's tribute tonight listen i'm not content tonight to get one victory how many ass i mean jehu was not content with just one victory in his life he said i'll cut him down i'll run him down i'll take out anybody that stands in my way i've got one purpose to fulfill the will of god for my day i've been anointed for it i've been called as a king to bring about the destruction of the powers of darkness listen i've got some jehu's i believe on the earth today anointed through the prophet elijah's ministry anointed to be called for this hour because god wants to prove to your enemy the devil once and for all that there's nothing he can do there's nothing satan can do to stop the word of god in your life listen god so wants to humiliate the enemy tonight he don't you don't have to be some 80 year old man that studied the bible your whole life you just get on fire for god and you submit yourself to god young person and you've got more power than every principality every power every darkness we've got 13 14 15 16 you've got more power in this building tonight than all the powers of darkness can muster together i believe there's enough power in this building tonight you could speak a world in existence if god wanted to do it hey man tell you what what have we got to do with peace amen that's the problem we make peace with it well you know the devil this and the devil listen i'm not here to negotiate with the enemy i'm tired of talking about him like he's scary i'm tired of building him up he ain't nothing before jehu he is just an enemy ordained to be defeated amen listen i tell you what they saw jehu come and said he drives his chariot furiously it must be jehu i told you you've got a reputation when people know who you are when you're driving down the road they can't even see the call of your car they don't know who's coming say well he drives like a maniac i must be jehu i've driven like that before you young people don't do that by the way amen listen he had a reputation his reputation was so strong they didn't want nothing to do with him amen praise the lord we remember what he's done that's why we're here tonight listen i was just talking to some the young people about this earlier today at our church you you look at the men of god throughout history you look at women watching their little kids tortured you read a fox's book of martyrs you look through the bible you look through history listen men and women they suffered and they bled and they died so we could be here tonight and preach this bible and believe this message uncompromising unflinching we're not backing up we're not walking away these men spilled their blood to seal their testimony and one day i've planned to meet every one of them and shake their hand and say i fought my good fight too i didn't back down because it was inconvenient i didn't walk away because it was hard to serve god i doubled down and i put my shoulder to the wheel and i hopped on my chair and i rode out i remember what the antichrist system didn't do those people i know what that power has done throughout the ages of god's people trying to steal your inheritance listen why does the devil fight your inheritance so much because it belongs to you it does not belong to him it will never belong to him and he knows it he knows it that's why he fights it so much amen but we have not forgotten the price that was paid we're here tonight because people pay the price even this prophet you think of all the friends he lost you think of all the things that was done to him the things that were spoken about him that prophet lost a daughter lost a wife this man paid a price to bring this message to us and god forbid that i should sit at home and fold my hands and let let some jezebel spirit run over my family and run over my testimony and run over my church and run over my prayer life god's given me an anointing god's given me a commission god's given you a commission well praise the lord we're not here tonight for peace we're here to declare war on all the powers of darkness say what are you talking about brother listen jesus even said i didn't come to bring peace i come to bring us hard we're not here to flirt with the world we're not here to negotiate terms we are not negotiating tonight with our children with our testimony with our prayer life we it is non-negotiable because the price is already paid we're not backing up we're not riding off we're not suing for peace we are not satisfied until every enemy is put under our feet because the bible says praise the lord the bible says that the god of peace amen he would put satan under your feet shortly oh he's under he's under god's feet he's under your feet god wanting you to be the one to supplant every power of the enemy hallelujah my my come for war tonight amen listen god called you not to the greatest picnic ever fought we're gonna fight over a piece of turkey i'm gonna fight over against the last sandwich with the last piece of pizza that's not why we're here we are called to the greatest battle that's ever been fought and if you don't like fighting well guess what throw out the old wishbone and get it back listen we'll fight with our neighbor we'll fight with her brother we'll fight with our sister we'll fight with everybody else but the enemy wants to come in and try to defile us and make us lukewarm and make us powerless and we'll sit there and we'll forehead well i hope someday somebody does something about that well maybe if mommy does it or daddy your big brother or so-and-so the pastor you do it god called you to do it listen this is not a one-man show there's only one great one it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's jesus christ in you it's jesus christ and me he is not defeated he is not weakened his power is magnified i tell you what jehu i tell you what he goes down to samaria like i was talking about and he says you know what i i'm not satisfied we've defeated jezebel we defeated joram i defeated ahaza you know what i feel like i could go on a little bit longer hey man listen some people that come to church they get a little victory and they're in church for a few weeks and they have a good time in the lord for a little while and afterwards they lose their victory brothers sisters if you want to keep the victory in your life go out and get some listen i can look at my life and say god deliver me from this addiction god healed me when i was sick god did this in my life but you know what i'm not finished i'm not done i'm just getting started we're just getting warmed up the best is yet to come amen somebody listen there's nothing more pitiful to me than a christian they're always getting beat up by the devil and every time they open their mouth while the devil did this and the devil did that and he's just tormenting me god give us some jehoves that'll go and take it to the enemy amen listen jesus when jesus walked in the room the devils begin to cry out have you come to torment us before the time it's like i always say i'm gonna say it again hey man listen you what you well the people just complain well this is happening this and that amen listen when trouble troubles me i trouble trouble amen i'd like to make my life so uncomfortable for the powers of darkness till anyone would come on the same block that i live on listen you've got to be the devil to the devil you say what's that what's a devil it's a tormentor but here's one the prince of life and the tormentors were getting tormented listen i hope my life so torments satan till he just stays awake all night frightened about it i hope he leaves his closet light on i hope he looks under his bed i hope he sits there and i live right free in his head all day long amen listen i want to be able to say like paul amen they knew who jesus was they knew who paul was they ought to know your name they ought to recognize you coming down the road in your chariot say there come the son of god going to church there's a son of god there's a daughter of god going to school i don't want nothing to do with him everywhere i go i get beat up i get defeated i don't want nothing to do with him anymore amen i'll tell you what what brother brahms say he said i'm so glad that a man can so completely serve god til what the devil don't know what to do with him listen there's somebody's got to fulfill the largest prophecy there's somebody got to fulfill the message there's got to be somebody on the face of the earth the devil don't even want nothing to do with you your life is under so much holiness and humility and power satan don't even want to be around you anymore listen these sumerians they had a bunch of ahab's kids down there and jay who's like tell you what give them an army give them some chairs send their best fighters out here i challenged them to fight you know what the sumerians did they said we don't want nothing to do with him he kills everybody everywhere he goes they went took ahab's sons and they cut their heads off

of the lord terry's in front of you this is just the beginning come and see my zeal for the lord of hosts you know i think about the bible tells us about a young man by the name of phineas when the people of israel had sinned in the days of moses amen they said in the days of moses that defile themselves i believe it was with the people of moab and there was a there was a young man by the name of phineas he went and grabbed a javelin you know what he did he saw the enemy at work in the in the camp of israel and he went he did something about it he didn't go crying get on the phone and blubber and why this why he went and did something about it amen he went around and jabbing through him and it's amazing to me you know what god says he says this men's deal this man's zeal has become he says an atonement for israel you say what are you getting that brother listen one bans zeal saved the entire nation one man jehu started out one man amen just one man but it began to build and they began to fall not falling the man following the anointed prophecy coming to pass following the destiny that god had laid out for them amen one man in the hand of god with a zeal and a love for god spared the entire cape of israel if one man's zeal will do that under the blood of bulls and goats what what haha somebody what can god do here tonight amen you say well you know i you know what it

we're talking about a defining moment jesus came to a place that defined him the work of redemption jehu came to place in his life there was a moment that defined the fate of kingdoms the day he stepped in that chariot amen it's like i just said we're so busy looking for something god didn't ordain you to look for something he actually revealed it already got a ring for you to be something not even to become something to be something quit trying to become this kind of i wish i could be you already are if you can believe all things are possible brother brown tells a story this is in the sermon come let us reason together in 1955. he gives his testimony he said there's a man in the meeting he was sitting there and he had hardening his arteries and he says he wants god to make him well and he asked me you think god would heal you sir do you think that would do that and he said the man got healed there he said i want to ask you something he said i was talking to this woman right next to you think about this sit right next to each other in church there's a woman sitting right next to my church and here's this man he said when i asked you something i was talking to that woman and when i was talking to you you felt something move over from her to you he said he said just then the sovereign grace that went over to you a real strange feeling swept over you didn't it and you wondered why that woman didn't raise up didn't you see she missed it because the angel was leaving her and going to you isn't that right he says if it is wave your hand real funny feeling that's right he says it ended with you brother your faith got the vision now i we don't like to think about these but these things but i that's just how i am i begin to think about it can you imagine being that woman sitting that meeting and you you you drove all the way to church you fought your way through sickness fought your way through all these things and you dealt with all these problems and you come to church but because your faith's not in the right place you listen the angel was there the power of god was present to heal the prophet was right there say i wish brother brown was here tonight listen the angel of the lord is here but can your faith catch the vision that woman missed it and a few feet away some other man got it don't miss what god's doing amen you get older i do anyway i guess you are too i'm not old man as some would say but i'm older than many of you but let me say this people that get older they tend to look back on things and put the rose tinted glasses on and we remember things that the way we want we we we begin to think about things we wish we did differently and you know we are warned from an early age to avoid certain pitfalls and different troubles in life and that's good that's fine but what i find the most with people when they get older amen your mileage may vary hey man it's not usually our regrets aren't usually what we did do or didn't do wrong or whatever it's usually the things that we left undone we we wanted to pursue a certain career we want to do this and we do that but we let fear we let things get in the way with the cares of life distract us before you know it you're you're older and you look back said i wish i had done this with my life i wish i wouldn't miss we miss so many opportunities and the very things we miss sometimes that's the defining moment in our life if i just went this way if i'd done one thing different amen listen and maybe tonight we've got many young people here maybe you're concerned tonight you don't want to miss out on certain friends or certain things in your youth or maybe there's this special someone in your life and you're interested in them we don't want to miss those things or or maybe it's school a career whatever it is friends let me say this whatever you do don't miss on out on the kingdom of god it's so easy to get caught up in leo to see it it's so easy to look around and be troubled by this hour it's so easy to be distracted and caught up with the cares of this world and you can sit in church and the holy ghost can come and ruin the service and bless one person and you can sit there and scratch your head and say what's going on i don't understand you're missing what god's doing friends whatever you do you might you might miss work you might miss whatever it is don't miss this kingdom don't miss this thing this rapture this event it's more than an event it's going on right now god's doing something tonight right now he's quickening us from death into life he's even bringing these mortal bodies subject to the word and i think can you imagine sitting in william branham's meeting and missing that well you know she might have missed her young but think of all the thousands of people that missed what the message was about they're calling for revival brother branstad they missed the awake don't miss it now they miss the awakening of the bride listen i'm here tonight because i caught it my faith caught the vision god allowed me by his sovereign grace to recognize the move is on for the bride we're in our chariot we're going down the road we're not going back this way we're not walking back to the powers of darkness we're not compromising we're down the road we're down the road we've got some victories under our belt tonight the move's not on for the ecclesiastical realm the move's not on for the rest of the world it's on for you and i listen i i made this statement years ago and i want to make the same statements not to you young people because i hear this all the time in churches i hear this idea you know we need to take care of the youth and have youth meetings they're the church of tomorrow the youth of the church tomorrow that is absolutely a lie you are not the church of tomorrow you are the church today and if you are not the church today there will be no church tomorrow the move is on in your life not just mine listen i'm just getting i'm getting old and crusty and everything else amen listen god needs some young men god needs some david's listen david didn't know when he got up that day to take some food to his brothers help me out now he didn't know that was going to be the moment that defined the rest of his life he thought he was just going down to give his brother some food and he hears this big old goliath boston and his brothers are even going on all of david you're just getting all worked up that's just your pride well that's because faith looks like pride to the unbeliever listen you're gonna have classmates you're gonna have friends you might even have people in church you catch the vision of this message you get on fire for god they might say all kinds of things about you they might call you every kind of name in the book but one day they're going to call you gone because you're not made to stay in this world you're made to go into heavenly places listen david didn't know when he got up that morning and rode that donkey down there they'd be singing songs about him at the end of the day they were going to be testifying about him saw his slaves thousands but dave in his ten thousands had no idea it was coming right his way but when it come his way he was ready his face said i'll take the challenge i accept the challenge the gauntlet's been thrown i won't run away i'm not backing up god ordained this moment for me see it seemed like it seemed insignificant they've been out there for 40 days plus just a day like every other day oh i got more trials i got this goliath go kill him well brother i'm just really struggling with this thing you don't have to struggle with it anymore go cut his head off you're anointed for it you ordained to overcome it it has not been ordained to defeat you you have been ordained to defeat it don't miss it tonight listen esther almost missed it she saw like jesus she saw her hour she saw the danger of it and she got disturbed and mordecai says look you've got to go talk to the king amen you go talk to the king i said listen now if you don't do this listen if you don't do this god will find some way amen god's going to save his people but how do you know listen esther you were born for this task you were born for such a time as this listen jesus could not he could not bypass his hour he was born for that purpose you and i were born in the darkest most perverse most deceiving age there's ever been don't get shook up about it you were born for it you were born to overcome it how many times amen do we miss an opportunity to do something for god i'll be honest you know this times my somebody called me on the phone maybe maybe somebody can relate to this you know people calling the phone i've got this need or whatever it is well i'll pray about it here a little bit and then i get off phone and i forget about it and then i find out about there and i'm like man that was you know what i do you know what i do when they call me said brother i gotta need let's just pray right now let's not miss an opportunity listen god might be waiting for you to pray he might not be waiting for the pastor or the deacon or the evangelist he might be waiting for you to pray god has put mountains in our life that you're getting you to move don't miss it you go right there and say you know what i'm not going to go back home i'm not going to research it i'm not going to question i'm going to stand up to the enemy god has already equipped me listen if you've got the holy ghost and you're a christian you're as equipped as you need to be to overcome every power of the enemy tonight we let so many opportunities slip by us we think it's insignificant amen that's why we miss it we think it's just another family devotional we think it's just another sunday evening service or prayer meeting oh it's just another service don't ever take for granted what god's trying to do amen god is trying to do something in your life amen brother graham says this in christ the mystery he says god's trying to get us the revelation we let so many things keep it from us god's not trying to keep nothing from you listen he revealed it to this day that's why he gave him the message he revealed everything god's not holding nothing back from you we let things get in the way we let things distract us and they're not always even things that are what we would say inherently sinful now listen we all we have to work jobs and we have to we've got family we've got obligations i get that but but don't let that become what's preeminent in your life look your education is important that's good but it don't ever take the place of god your job your career this a boy or girl or whatever it can never fulfill god's purpose in your life if you give it preeminence amen praise the lord you and i were born for such a time as this listen you were created to destroy the powers of darkness in laodicea the darkest most wicked evil age he set in the most powerful of revelation that there's ever struck the face of the earth just to prove it doesn't matter how dark it is it doesn't matter how wicked it is i can take children i can take young people i can take old people i can still defeat satan anywhere anytime that means today in this hour under any circumstances listen it doesn't matter what your circumstance is tonight satan is still defeated by the word of god why would anybody choose the day that they're in hey man they asked brother brown you could choose a day what would you listen a lot of us if it wasn't on tape we wouldn't have said the same thing if it wasn't on tape we just said all right i picked that i wish i was there with paul i wish i was back down the shores of galilee we never picked anything else but brother man said i would have chose this day this day what this hour this is the greatest battle yeah that's why it's going to be the greatest victory god didn't reserve this day for paul he didn't reserve it for arenas he reserved it for you and i what a blessing you say what what a blessing you and i get to fight on the front lines in the heat of the greatest battle there's ever been god's reserve some heads on the heads of goliath for you to take off and you to lift up and say my god preserve my testimony in 2021 when satan was on every phone every magazine rack every place every textbook yet i've got victory over the powers of darkness i believe in a token i believe there's amen somebody listen i've got four little ones if i looked at this day and this hour that we lived in i would have never said oh i should have children and bring them in this horrible awful god-forsaken wicked world but i did that by faith because i believe in a power of a token there's going to be somebody there's going to be some daddy somewhere there's going to be some praying moms somewhere they're believing for their household and their household shall be saved listen a prophet preach it somebody's got to fulfill it somebody must fulfill this word it might as well be me it might as well be you oh there you go i was made for this people get all shook up they're all worried what are you talking about man i was made for this i was born for this i was forwards in the heath of battle in the darkest hour because i was made to overcome satan you were made for this amen brother tells a story about a man by the name of arnold von winklery he's a hero in switzerland hey man you familiar with the story this man is just listen he goes out one day and he's gonna go fight these people they're invading switzerland and he stands up one day listen he's this is not some young man he's got a wife and kids back home hey man he gets up probably slept from the ground if it's anything you know some of you brothers all love camp and i tell you what my day of camping's motel 6 or something that's about that's about as much as i rough it he probably woke up oh man that's not as nice as the bed i slept in the night before i need to get a my pillow or something i don't know i've got all these pains popping some some tylenol or something listen this is this is a this is a man with a family just a farmer listen he's not some elite man he's not some trained soldier but he woke up one day and when everybody else was standing there wondering how we're going to overcome the enemy this man stood up he said my friends today i die for switzerland what are you going to do arnold von winkler he says listen i'm going to go and i'm gonna charge the enemy at the worst part of the army i'm gonna go where there's the most spears the densest army the most heated place of battle i'm gonna go in there and i'm gonna take the enemy spears and i'm gonna pull them into myself and i'm gonna drive them into my bosom i will die but when i do i'll make a way for you to overcome the enemy that man would up there didn't have a weapon in his hand but he threw his arms out and he said make way for liberty and that then rushed into the heat of battle he wasn't armored he wasn't even armed but he took the spears in his bosom and when he did that he made a way it rallied them into the cause they charged the enemy drove them out of switzerland and to this day they've never been invaded again brother bearman talks about this great this great heroism of this man listen this is a natural man dying for his natural country he didn't know that morning we would be having statues of him built in switzerland he didn't know that day when he died we'd be preaching about him in 2021 that a man by the name of william branham was going to be preaching about him i had no idea david didn't know arnold didn't know esther didn't know that man had no idea we'd be preaching about him talking about him that he'd be a national hero he knew one thing i've got a wife and kids back home and i'll never see him again i'll never see them again but i lay down my life so they can live in freedom they say brother that's a real hero listen i'm not asking you to do that tonight i'm telling you one already did it for him when adam's race was lost in sin when there was no way out and the prophets had failed and kings had failed and judges had failed there was one that come down from glory and he spread on his arms of the cross and he made it away for you and i tonight to have liberty i'm not asking you tonight to go take a bunch of spears into your bosom i'm telling you the enemy's line is broken tonight's the night charge while he's broken open amen this is the moment he's defeated this is the moment he's exposed a prophet has shown us he has been exposed as a defeated enemy and then don't sit there and wait for somebody else to charge a man made a way for you and i to get the victory tonight all you have to do is charge your enemies actually lost all of his power that man took that in and made a way for you and i to have liberty amen listen arnold von winklereed he wasn't he wasn't a hero till after that day listen all these men and these women the bible we get this idea they're just so whatever and this listen these are ordinary people farmers shepherds take just ordinary but listen ordinary people they look like ordinary people but extraordinary circumstances revealed extraordinary people because they were extraordinary in this listen gideon didn't know he was extraordinary and god come down one day and said you're a mighty man of valor he had no evidence to back that up in the natural there was not as he's cowering behind the line press listen come out from behind the line press tonight god has spoken things over your life you're better than that you're more than what the world's told you you're more than what people have told you you're exactly what god says about you the sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ we've got a faith tonight it's a victory over everything in the world hallelujah it just takes one person amen just takes one listen brother brandon all the time you hear him talk on tape about how a person they got a wrong spirit something they can come in the service they can come to church and ruin the atmosphere and we take that and we dwell on the negative one person could just ruin a service one person's bad spirit can can affect somebody what about one person with the right atmosphere i don't care if you're sitting in a church full of hypocrites that are backslid one person but the holy ghost and fire can come in the church and change the scene listen if the devil can do that in the negative how much more can you and i tonight by the power of almighty god change the scene change the circumstances we're not weighed down by the powers of the world we've risen up rise up tonight claim your victory hallelujah praise the lord the enemy's lying already broken amen listen he's in disarray that's why he fights you that's why he fights you so hard you say why is he fights hard he knows he's got a short time left that's why the bible says he knows his time is sharp that's why he fights you he knows his time is up this is your hour this is your time now's the time to charge now's the time to throw them into the sea amen now is the time to strike you're never going to have a better opportunity than right now to strike your enemy amen i say once more into the breach hey man let's go fight a good fight let's go press the battle amen ours is not to make reply ours is not to question why let's go do and die man let's go fight this thing out let's let the enemy remember he's never had to fight a power like the power he fought in this day amen i feel like john paul jones in the revolutionary war saying that you know this story in the revolutionary he's on that ship when the enemies are bombarding him it looked like he was losing amen maybe you feel that way tonight about your situation i just it seems like the more i try the more i struggle the more problems i have quit trying go and do it go and be the god called christian god called you today and john paul jones when it looked like they're at the worst the british they say no are you ready to give up are you sir ready to surrender i like it he says i've not yet begun to fight you thought i was fighting i wasn't even trying yet we're just getting warmed up this bride of jesus christ i thank god for william branham i thank god for these men that have stood the test throughout these years of this message but god's got some young people here tonight they're just getting started the best is yet to come we're just getting warmed up we're taking the fight to him tonight this is our night this is your time this can be the night everything changes for you if you can recognize it whatever you're wrestling with whatever you're going through maybe you feel like the most defeated person there is tonight's your night you can believe all things are possible amen as you stand to your feet amen will there be a young person here tonight they see what god's done for them they see the finished work of calvary they see what a prophet's done what a message is preachers in this day they see that the enemy's line is broken and they're not waiting for somebody else to finish the battle they'd say i'm ready to charge i'm going ahead first if nobody else is going i'm going in i'm going in with my sword drawn i'm going in with my shield up i'm going in with the enemy and only one of us is coming out you go dig him a grave cause after today i'll never see him again i'll never have to deal with him again i'm coming out with the victory hallelujah god give us some jehusa is there a jehu here tonight say i i'm not gonna just go on doing like i always did we get too comfortable in there to see her we don't need to be comfortable we need to win throw yourself into the kingdom of god throw yourself into battle you can only win you can only win if god is on your side listen you've got every reason to have courage satan has every reason to be afraid he'll tell you you've got every reason not to i'll share this testimony brother paul who's there that friday he was talking about brother paul i got done with that service we prayed that one sister got healed in the service and i was telling this at the church the next day i went home that night i was driving back home on the highway and satan satan come and spoke to me in that vehicle and i tell you what it's like i was saying earlier i don't know why he would do that it never ends well for him hey man listen if satan talks to you a lot make them uncomfortable talking to you listen i know how to make human beings uncomfortable talking to me hey man i just make it real uncomfortable he come in that car and you know what he said to me he said you're just getting the people worked up you don't really believe this message like that you don't really believe god does all those things nowadays you don't really believe that people were healed you're just saying all that you're just getting people worked up you don't believe that at all and it struck the inspiration struck me i said i that i said what i said was this i said even if that's true satan i know one person that was there that night that believed it you do i said satan if there's one person that believes that this is still the same thing today it's you that's why you fight it that's why you're against it that's why you're here talking to me now you fight it because you know what it's done to you night after night after night in the prophet's meetings you saw what the power of god did to you you believe it even if i don't that's why you're afraid that's why he's afraid right now oh i can feel him shaking right now he's afraid some young person is going to believe it the way he does listen if you believe as much as he did amen you'd have every reason not to be afraid you've got not one reason to fear tonight amen we bow our heads heavenly father i thank you for these precious young people tonight i think of john writing to the church and his epistle writing to these young men because they're strong you young men are strong lord tonight there's young people sitting here they don't have a wife and kids and all the different things we get when we're older we get so many different responsibilities we spend so much time trying to juggle trying to manage our time lord we it seems like we failed so many times but father they're in a time of life right now they can be whatever you want them to be lord they don't have to be distracted lord these are the best years of their life how satan would come and try to torment them say they're too young to do something for the lord they're too young to fulfill your purpose but lord that's just a lie the enemy tonight we rebuke him in the name of jesus christ lord if you could take a jeremiah if you could take a david if you could take a gideon and perform your will in their lives lord tonight from the youngest to the oldest the least to the greatest lord your arm is not last short tonight that you cannot save lord your ears not growing heavy tonight that you cannot hear lord i believe you can take even the weakest christian i thought about that after the enemy come to me that night i said that's why when the weakest christian goes to their knees the devils tremble the devils trouble because they believe lord tonight the enemy is convinced you're convinced lord tonight may we be fully persuaded may our faith catch the vision tonight victory is ours in the name of jesus christ victor is mine god give me the victory lord there's no excuses moses had excuses gideon had excuses lord we've got one reason tonight above every other excuse of every misgiving above every reservation we've got one reason tonight to believe because you said it lord that's all we need that's all we're needing lord tonight i'm not moved tonight but what i feel i'm not moved tonight by what i see i'm moved tonight by what i believe and i believe right now tonight all things are possible to him that believes lord you've qualified us tonight to overcome the enemy may there not be one that goes out of here empty-handed tonight if we go out of here tonight if we live below our privileges tonight it's because we chose to lord you did not choose that for us you chose something greater for us you chose healing you chose deliverance you chose authority you chose power revelation wisdom and might through the spirit of christ all things are ours tonight if we can just reach out and believe lord i pray you take these young people god give us some timothy's tonight that are examples some young men that are examples some young sisters that are examples in charity in faith and doctrine in their purpose may they be the living epistles read and known of all men in their schools in their homes and their families lord maybe some young person that come from a home maybe mommy and daddy are struggling may you take that young person take that young person and give them such a zeal and a fire for god you could use that young person to restore that home it's not always mommy or daddy sometimes you'll take that young person restore a home god i pray you do it i pray for everyone under my voice tonight everyone in divine audience tonight may you use them that way god may just be a great a great move of god in our lives as a witness that we are a move of god we are our revival may that not just might be my preaching tonight may that be the voice of everyone present jesus name we believe it amen amen god bless you tonight brother go ahead and sing something for us amen i'm sorry go ahead and come brother oh yes
