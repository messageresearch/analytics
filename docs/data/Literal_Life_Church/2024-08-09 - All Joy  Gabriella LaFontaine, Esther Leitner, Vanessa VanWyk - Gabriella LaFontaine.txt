All Joy

Walked quite a few miles with You now
And You've never walked away
Been through a few trials and somehow
I bent but did not break
You never failed me
And You never will
It's true, might sound crazy
But I'll say it still

I count it all joy when I run into trouble
I count it all good when the bad days come
'Cause I know that You're always working
And I know that You're still not done
So I'm gonna lift Your praise through the trial
Ain't no storm gonna stop my voice
'Cause I've lived some life
And I've learned that I can always
Count it all grace
Count it all joy

I gave You my heart in pieces
And it healed inside Your hands
The more I learn I can trust You, Jesus
Oh, the more I understand
You never failed me
And You never will
You prove it on the daily
So I'll say it still

I count it all joy when I run into trouble
I count it all good when the bad days come
'Cause I know that You're always working
And I know that You're still not done
So I'm gonna lift Your praise through the trial
Ain't no storm gonna stop my voice
'Cause I've lived some life
And I've learned that I can always
Count it all grace
Count it all joy

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

I'm counting all of my blessings
I'm naming them one by one
And that number keeps getting higher
And I've only just begun
I'm counting all of my blessings
I'm naming them one by one
And that number keeps getting higher
And I've only just begun

I count it all joy when I run into trouble
I count it all good when the bad days come
'Cause I know that You're always working
And I know that You're still not done
So I'm gonna lift Your praise through the trial
Ain't no storm gonna stop my voice
'Cause I've lived some life
And I've learned that I can always
Count it all grace
Count it all joy

Do do do do do do do (joy)
Do do do do do do do (count it all joy)
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do ...
