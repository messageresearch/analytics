========================================

help us Lord to think like you Lord help us to think like you hallelujah praise the lord it's good to be here tonight if you turn in your Bibles with me to Psalms 119 we're going to look at that Psalm tonight I asked you on Sunday to read that it's a long chapter but I just trust you were able to read some of it we're going to pull from it just a little bit tonight for our texts we greet you in the name of the Lord It's a joy to be a Christian tonight to be in the house of the Lord and we're thankful for his grace and mercy to us we want to remember all the prayer requests that's been mentioned and it looked like there was a flyer that came in for a special meeting next week this coming weekend as well in Murfreesboro Tennessee Brother Joseph Hammonds he's having brother Daniel Gibson Danner for Saturday and Sunday and I just got the fire today so it's a bit short notice I'll put it on the back if anybody would be down in that area you're certainly welcome to take that in so I want to announce it for Brother Joseph we appreciate him and their their meetings as well amen you know I was reading in August 9th in the in the a devotional I don't know if he was reading it but it's just really inspiring here the other day and I won't read all of this but I thought this was really good and it's my heart's desire and this is the way we want it I was reading this to my daughter and my wife just an hour or so ago and the prophet said in the devotion I don't know if you read this one on August 9th he said he's he's never trusted me with too much God's never trusted me with too much because I wouldn't know how to take care of much I guess he just gives me what he will but what I have I freely give to glorify him and his church I'm just here to try to represent him to you by a Divine gift just like if he gave me a hand I want to use that hand the best that I can if you give me my eyes I don't want to look at the evil things I want to look at his bible I want to look at things that's right if they happen to run into evil things my eyes I want to turn my head till I look off somewhere else because he gave gave me my eyes then he talks about being healed he was almost blind and he was healed but his last comment here said oh it's amazing grace how good he is I love him though he condemns me at the end I still love him how many how many people I want to be there that if I served him and loved him my whole life and he condemns me to hell at the end I'll still love and serve him see that's when it's not about God paying me something or God God doesn't really owe us anything but when we love him like that we love him anyway that's how deeply I want to love the Lord tonight when I read that I thought Lord that's what I want I want to be able to love you that deeply in my heart let's pull out a few scriptures here tonight Psalms 119 and if you get a chance read the whole chapter it's I think it's the longest one in the Book of Psalms so there's a lot in there but I want to just look at a couple things here in Psalms 119 we'll just do 65 to 72 first thou Hast dwelt well with thy servant O Lord according unto Thy word and I just missed an announcement wait look up here wait stop I got the cart before the horse so we're praying at 7 30 tomorrow morning whether in your homes or here at the church you're welcome to join us we're praying that God will just lead us and guide us God will give us Revival in our hearts we'll be praying for the camp that starts tomorrow night so if you join us at 7 30 in the morning we'd appreciate that for a half hour we'll be praying together or as long as you want to pray that would be great and brother Brandon mentioned to me that at state line Mr Newbold actually ordered when you bring your kids to school is it first day tomorrow Tiffany okay so he's set a prayer time as well about the same time so when the kids come so that's good uh we'll we'll join together with them as well and pray together amen so thou now I can read the scripture everybody look at your Bibles thou Hast dealt well with thy servant O Lord according to Thy word teach me good judgment and knowledge for I have believed thy Commandments before I was afflicted I went astray before I was afflicted I went astray but now have I kept Thy word thou art good and do us good teach me thy statues the proud have forged a lie against me but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart their heart is as fat as Greece but I Delight in thy law it is good for me that I have been Afflicted that I might learn thy statues look at the good that comes out of being Afflicted going through things that's a pretty strong word being Afflicted he said it's good for me to be afflicted because what I learn out of it is your statues the law of thy mouth is better unto me than a thousands of gold and silver verse 97 skip to verse 97. oh how I love thy law it is my meditation all the day oh how I love that's what I'd like to title this tonight loving his law because law and the the talk about the law of God has a bad connotation to it right and Satan's done that has a bad connotation but here's a man of God especially after he had sinned now he's saying Lord I love thy law I love the law of God I love the precepts of God there's not too many people say that but he's come to a place that I want to come to Lord I love thy law you'd have to understand the power behind God's law in order to say that I love thy law you know people saying it you don't hear too many people that are Lawless saying it I love the law they want to get rid of policemen and be a lawless nation and sometimes you're her teen are teenagers you'll never hear them saying I love the rules of this house I love the laws of this home you rarely hear it saying you don't hear people saying concerning the laws of God but David's saying it Lord I love thy law it is my meditation all the Day verse 113 if you would 113 I hate vain thoughts but thy law do I love verse 163. verse 163. I hate and abhor lying but thy law do I love in verse 165 great peace have they which love thy law how many want peace tonight great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall offend them amen Lord Jesus thank you for your word tonight thank you for your precepts thank you that we have this people gathered here and listening online and I pray the anointing of the Holy Spirit would come as we've expressed our hearts to you Lord in the songs of worship lifting our hands lifting our voices Lord just bringing a jubilant Heart Tonight Lord I remember our choir when they sing that song Hallelujah in the valley Lord hallelujah in the in the Saint in the weak times Lord there's something you get Glory when someone just reaches out and Praises God in the weak times and sings Hallelujah you can hear the hallelujahs coming out of the valleys not just the mountains but coming out of the valleys you love to hear your people sing during those hard times and I pray Lord tonight your word would go forth in power and demonstration Lord we pray that it would bring forth the fruit that it was meant to do we're thankful we offer all your blessings from the weekend and just the last few weeks has such a just been an outpouring and we're thankful for it may tonight be no exception and may the camp this week be a wonderful time for the young people Lord to enjoy the presence of the Lord to be able to get something solid in their lives we pray for we pray for the anointing of the ministers and and the camp directors and all of them may you bless it keep everyone protected there Lord I pray and we commit the service here tonight to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated God bless you now this Psalm 119 is set apart in very special uh in in itself because of it keeps having a theme to it and the theme is in all uh 176 verses of it that's the amazing thing if you read it the theme runs through all uh 176 verses it's I believe I think it's the longest you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's the longest Psalm that's in the Book of Psalms and it's the 119th Psalm but what's interesting is about it it has a theme in every verse and we're going to talk about this really the theme is loving his law loving his precepts David's saying I love your Commandments and so you correct me on this as well if you read it through I could only find two verses that don't mention these things every verse besides two and I mean it now coming correct me if you find me wrong okay that's fine I only found two verses that didn't have these things in every verse his his law his word his precepts his testimonies his Commandments his judgments and his statutes are in every verse but two so I think we know the theme and that is he has come to a place that he loves his law he loves his precepts he loves his Commandments everything that's come from God he's in love with him and he's not running from them he's not questioning them he's come into the world that this is the only world to live in is God's precepts God's quotes God's what do you ever want to whatever you want to call him they're quotes from God and they come through God's prophets there's quotes of Moses that's the quotes of the prophet and so he's living on all the quotes and he's valuing all the quotes he's saying this all has meaning to me and I'm not running from it I'm not resisting it I'm not bucking up against it I may want to understand some of them more but there's one thing for sure I have learned I love your law praise the Lord I love your statues I love your commands and you find those words you find those words in every verse but two I found so all these things are what God spoke to his people through his Prophet all these things are things God spoke to his people through his Prophet back at that time and I don't know if he had uh had this strong love for them before he broke the law himself how many original and say David broke the law himself David brought broke the thing that thou shall not commit adultery and he was with another woman that was not his his wife and not taken as his wife so he broke that so I don't know if David come into this deeper love for the law of God after he made a mistake a lot of times we do if we're really broken and we're real sincere about our sin then we develop a deeper love for what we ignored in other words he had to trample upon a bunch of precepts as a king he had to ignore and say this doesn't apply to me and and it's not important he had to make it less important in order to commit adultery with Bathsheba he had to trample upon or he didn't forget because he knew but he had to say you know what I'm I'm taking a vacation I'm taking a vacation from certain laws of God because I want this woman sometimes after we make a mistake and we defy and go against God's law we pay for it because how many know David paid for it we can pay there's something but there's something good that we get out of it can you say man and that is maybe what David got was such this deep deep love for the law of God I don't want to ever ever resist it again I don't want to trample upon it these things are not just words in a book they're just not words in the tablet but God gave them to me to protect me God gave them to me to keep me guarded from the things that I would get into and now I'm not looking for ways around them I love them somebody say praise the Lord I am through with looking aways around them I'm through with taking 10 years and trying to explain this quote I'm I'm through with it because if I know that it's come from God I'm good with it I love it I trust him because I trust God we're talking about the prophet's word now not just any wisdom that's on out there wisdom of the world we're talking about what we know is Vindicated to come from God how many know this Bible came from God it's the Vindicated word of God and it came from God so we can trust it because it came from God not man's interpretation of it but we can trust it so I don't know if David became this strong in his love for the law uh after his mistake we don't know that I'll I'm gonna ask him someday I really am I'm gonna ask him someday because I can't ask him now but I'm going to ask him did you come into a deeper love after you defied the law of God and now you're coming into Psalms one team David I heard you say every verse you're crying out I love his precepts I love his testimonies I love his Commandments there's not one of them I don't love there's some I may not understand but I love them I want them in my life I want to keep them before me I want to order my life order my steps in your word may we all come may we all lose every bit of of distrust and may we come into this kind of love for his word amen all I know is that he is life was 100 trustworthy of what God said there's not an ounce of question or resistance in David he's basically saying I may not have been all in before but I'm all in now I love your precepts I love your law so this this life of David that he come into it would be another extreme of what we see in the world today and even around us sometimes with some in that's going to a message church or going to church as a Christian um this would be the Other Extreme of what we see in the world because the world is mocking the precepts of God the world is saying it's out of date the world is saying it doesn't work world the world says many in the world say there you know there is no God number one but then a lot of them are saying if this is God this has no value anymore that's crazy stuff that's stupid stuff so this is if you have that extreme that you live in in the world that there's no value for the precepts of God in other words God says something and they decide whether it's relevant or not and they dump it out that's the world we live in I think David is the Other Extreme of the world we live in and that is he's not just in between but he's actually saying they're saying I hate God's laws I don't need God's laws I don't need to live my life according to God's word and David's saying I can't live without the laws of God I can't function without out of the precepts of God the littlest little detail on how to live I need it to live by I want to be that way it's the other extreme of what the world is there's a there's extreme there's an extreme now of disrespect for God's word and disrespect for God's prophet can I hear it amen we've reached higher and higher levels of people mocking quotes of the prophet and mocking what the message says and it's his opinion that's increased and the problem is is when it increases it can plant seeds in your mind that make you back off and have your wall up towards it but see that's Satan's work to do that and so people become extreme in their disrespect for God's word I think on Judgment Day there's some people that is even left the message they're in a rough spot on Judgment Day because of the disrespectful Blasphemous things that they're saying I would never put them in hell but I just know some of it's blasphemy and they should be careful what they say respect it disagree with it but respect it be careful what you boast can you say mom be careful what you do with God's prophets whether it's in the Bible or what God has said be careful what you do because if it's God's prophet and it's his word you may disagree but certainly respect it things he said are mocked they're in derision look at a scripture sure if I can find it here in 119 if you still have your Bible open let me see if I can find that one he says in 119. in verse I didn't write this down but there was something about the word derision they had me in derision um yeah of course oh here it is verse 51 David says the proud have had me greatly in derision and that means they have mocked what I'm standing for they are mocking what I believe they're mocking these precepts but look what he said even though he's being mocked and the words being mocked the proud had me in greatly in derision yet have I not declined from thy law they've posted a lot of stuff against this message and against me and yet I have not declined from your law I still respect the quotes from God's prophet amen so some are in Rebellion some are provoking God when you leave a service like Sunday and you go and do the opposite and post the opposite boy where's it come when you're provoking God then can I get an amen but some it's not provoking a rebellion some it's just sarcasm about certain quotes and things God says but here I love the law and guess what this is David's saying this before Calvary so before the possibility is the holy spirit coming in in an individual and living the law by the spirit this is before the spirit is on the soul yet oh it says before count this is way before there's any possibility of of the laws being written in the heart or in the Soul by the Holy Ghost before that David's already saying I love it I want to live by it that's amazing friends because we've got the blessing of calvary we've got the blessing of living a holy ghost life the amen are on the inside that in the soul when the flesh even says I don't want it the soul says amen Lord I want it I desire thy laws I want your word I want what your Prophet said I want it I want it it was sent for me it's not sent for everybody that's the reality of it I wish the whole world could receive it but it's not sent for everybody I want the love of God in my heart that I know that it's set for me and I want to embrace it I want to take all of it can you say amen and so they had nothing to live it by the spirit but David loves it anyway he Embraces it David changes his attitude towards the statues and precepts of God his mind had changed to love them and not to try to get around them because human nature and the serpent nature is to get around the laws of God Eve only had one thing from God to believe and follow and Satan got her around it Satan reads with reason with it so something has to happen to us to say I'm not looking for ways around it anymore I'm not looking for ways around it I'm I'm looking to for God to keep opening it to me because I love it he gave it to me it's for us can you say Amen now picking up from Sunday a little bit it was years after the prophet Moses gave his law that David had put some other things in place as I was speaking Sunday he gave some other things in place because different situations would come up and the high court or the Supreme Court of David and different ones would would bring laws as as a as a as a further interpretation I would say of what Moses said because there are situations that come up when as I was saying Sunday a husband being with another woman alone in a locked room um so they said we need to address that so they put in there a precept they put in there a thing that says uh and I gave you the law for it on Sunday I can't remember the name just now but it was it was to forbid that to happen for a man who wanted to be alone somewhere by themselves because it sets them up for Temptation and so they just made a law and then I mentioned to you after amnon's case then they had another thing with the high court and said now we need to we need to extend this to single guys and single girls because they're under sexual Temptation too and you put them long enough in a room something could take over if they're in a locked room and nobody's watching them so if it's an open place and people can see them or someone could surprise them that's the law as well if there was a possibility of something coming in and surprising them then it was okay see because they're open but if they're intentionally locked in a room together or in some place together and no one can see them and get to them you're setting yourself up for Temptation these laws were put in place after amnon for single people and then it trickled down and kept going and I'm not speaking on that again but it was very important to me that I found it in the scripture to see something that I've always encouraged in young people don't set yourself up for Temptation don't give yourself places that the flesh can take over but live with Integrity lived honorable can you say man honor that guy honor that girl and have some boundaries in place that God can honor according to the word of God and I think God will bless you for that can you say Amen praise the Lord so I um I I in talking about that I thank God for the message of the last days for our time how many thanks God for the message I thank God for the message because you know you have uh uh brother Brandon was mentioning something to me in the office there is that even sometimes when when you have something like the spirits taking over of lesbians and homosexuals and the spirits you may not have taken that Spirit but we have warnings to keep us from those Spirits coming in and so in the Bible days they greeted one another with a holy kiss men kissed men on the neck and actually brother Branham he says now we're not doing that because that's not our greeting today we're going to shake one another's hands you see now now you either believe he has the authority to adjust that he hasn't changed the the core of what's in God's mind hasn't changed but now for our generation now he says that's not going to work for the men to be kissing one another why because the spirit of homosexuality is present he said you start to open the doors to those Spirits so we're not going to kiss one another we're going to shake hands look at the authority now if you did not see the authority of God's man or the hour pulling from the thoughts of God for our day if you didn't see that you're going to Buck up against it but you see now God breathes on a generation to give us precepts and principles that are meant for the generation as well that's just the way I believe it because the people in Moses day would have had to believe the same thing the people that Nathan's day would have had to believe the same thing the people in Isaiah and Jeremiah because there were other prophets and some of them would have said no you know what I'm sticking with what he said back there but yet Jeremiah it was addressing the children of Israel going into idols and different things so now he had to address what was going on for the day can you say amen and so you couldn't say well I'm going to believe this prophet and not this one no because God's breathing on a generation saying I love my people that I may give some precepts for them to be able to understand for their day in their own language you ought to thank God it's in English for you a lot of countries don't have that don't have so much access but God breathed on this generation God brought his word to our generation and it's more up to date I think I said this Sunday I preached this Sunday and I don't have as many here but I'm going to preach anyway tonight this word is more up to date than anything I've found it's more up to date than it ever was it's more relevant than it ever has been he gave us his word and he's put Protections in place and you start playing with them then you're going to have you're going to open yourself up to Spirits in your home in your mind in your life God's put Protections in place and so so that's when you say I'm not strong enough to protect myself so I love thy law I love this quote and I'm going to apply this because I know going with the word comes a protection God can give me God loved me enough to put that there is that okay with everybody amen so you know what I'm just going to keep preaching this I'm going to keep preaching practical I'm going to keep preaching all the quotes I have some even in my assembly I think if I never talked about dress like I did Sunday they would love it love to come here they would like certain stuff it's interesting I received probably more response and support than I ever have for what we talked about Sunday undressed and I appreciate it very much but sometimes then other ones are have gone completely silent curiously not a word set about it because and that's a shame that's not fair to me as a minister I should be able to freely Minister all this message this is the message of Christ for the last days I'm not going to just talk talk about just Doctrine or just the things that uh that bring emotion and just Redemption I love to preach about Redemption and it makes me when you preach hope and Redemption that's wonderful can you say Amen but sometimes correction is needed and if you put me in a place that I can only preach on certain plots and if I get on the other parts you go silent on me on your support that's not fair to a minister but I'm going to keep doing it because brother Brian said I went out to Phoenix I go out there every year he says I preach it the standards and it gets worse and worse he said but I'm going to keep on preaching it it's because of the spirit of this age and the wave has taken people through all the social media and Fashions of this world it's trying to grab a hold of our girls it's trying to get over the minds of the people as they preach Sunday and listen listen God has sent us his word with the power of protections with it he said well they need the holy ghost first yes they need the Holy Ghost but I believe there's a power in the world until they get the Holy Ghost if they say Lord I'm going to follow your precepts I think there's a protection in place for it that's just the way I believe it and I'm going to keep preaching this because look at what Luther said Luther Martin Luther said this if you preach the gospel with all of its aspects with the exception of dealing with the issues specifically for your time you are not preaching the gospel at all read it again okay I will if you preach the gospel with all of his aspects with the exception of dealing with issues specific for your time you are not preaching the gospel at all because the convictions of the Gospel the gospel is the good news when you preach Redemption when you preach it's for your age too and when you preach it you're going to be blasting out and warning people of The Temptations of the age but you're not just going to keep preaching The Temptations and keep preaching that this world is all dirty and the spirits are there you're going to bring around a hope and Calvary and the good news I've got an atonement for you I've got an answer for you it hasn't changed since Calvary I don't care how bad the modern day gets his blood is powerful enough to change a life it never loses its power can I get an amen tonight his blood reaches to the deepest Mirey clay his blood has the answer for any depression his blood has the answer from any mental breakdown can you say man his power is there for us he gave it to us we just have to receive it we just have to say Lord I want it I love it take me Lord can you say Amen so we love the law of God but I want you to look at Joseph just before we go into some other things Joseph here uh being a type of Christ he was in a situation where he was tempted or I should say he was in a room and they did not have that law yet that said a man and woman shouldn't be alone in a room and pontiver's wife was all trying to get a hold of Joseph and get him locked in a way in a private place and so then she appealed to him you know the story with Joseph but Joseph with no heart laws hardly at all except for Abraham this was before Moses now so there's no Ten Commandments there's no things put in place yet okay and this is actually a type of this is a type of Joseph is a type of Christ and that is that if you have Christ in your life you've got the law Giver within you and somehow him being a type of Christ before he had any specific laws about I need to get out of here because the Ten Commandments says for me to get out Joseph didn't have that and so here he is and with this highly uh how should I say this he's a young man he's a young and strong and she's she's attracted to him a married woman and now she appeals to him in a room alone can you say amen and she's coming and and that combination I'll tell you it the story could have read altogether different the story could have read uh like David's story the story could have read like a lot of the stories in the news today because there's no Holy Ghost there there's no precepts there there's nothing there you're not young people you're not in that place you're not in the place of the world that you have no escape and nothing to go on there's the Holy Ghost there's the protections of the Holy Ghost there's the principles that we're preaching there's the principles of God that you know about so you won't have an excuse because you've got those things you can cling to Joseph's in the room alone and he didn't know this was going to happen she starts to come after him and in in and the scripture says four words there wasn't a long law for him to go by he loved the Lord he loved the Lord he's a type of Christ and it just says he did one thing four words Henry forwards he got him out just profound he didn't try to witness to her he didn't try to get her to turn to Jehovah God he didn't say can we have a Bible study first here and just try to point you to the Lord he got him out you know why I mentioned Henry because there was one time I was preaching this years ago when both of us were single probably and I said if we would just live by those three words he got him out just those three words and I held up three fingers the whole time and Henry's back there doing what he's doing now he's counting the words and he's he's counting four and I've got three fingers up see Henry it's just Wednesday night here Henry has all of my preaching bloopers if you ever want to hear him he's heard me for umpteen years here and they're like he he's got he can't remember a lot of things but he can remember all of my bloopers for all of my sermons sit down take an hour with him and he'll tell you all of them and that's one of them I'm saying just live by brothers and sisters young men live by those three words he got him out and there's Henry's back there going one two three so I got it straight tonight I got my math right and I'll keep it to four and I'll continue to say that's all the scripture says he got him out there was no explanation there's nothing he said he said I can't do this sin against my God it wasn't about what they would do he was so in love with God I can't do this sin because he was so close to God can I get an amen tonight he was so dedicated to his God I can't do this offense against not you not me against my God that's the way we need to live that's when Christ is living within us because everything we do is not living by a law we can live by law but it's that I don't want to do anything to offend this Christ within me I would not do this and so here's let's bring it up today he got him out that's what he did that's all he did he got him out he told her no four words young girls she told him no that's it he turned it off come on friends I'm bringing it up today he turned his head never clicked that page oh I should be getting some more amens tonight never click that page I'm bringing it up today I I never touched that girl he got him out never touched that girl he had a principle in place and a conviction in place and he put feet on his convention and he got him out you can talk about convictions all day long but In the Heat of the Moment you better apply them and get out like Joseph got out somebody ought to say praise the Lord now Josh McDonald says some things here a couple things about the principles of God and we'll just bring it to a close two teenagers board on a hot summer night remember that a neighbor has a backyard pool they also remember that the neighbors are on vacation they decide to sneak over to enjoy a refreshing swim they giggle as they clamor over the tall backyard fence willfully ignoring the posted signs no trespassing and no swimming the girl cautiously makes her way across the unlit backyard as her boyfriend races to the diving board with one hard bounce he hits his body he throws his body high into the air the girl's laugh turns to a shriek as she reaches the pool's Edge and realizes there is no water in that pool the impact of the boy's dive snaps his neck instantly paralyzing him for life so Josh McDowell makes the comment the homeowners didn't post the warnings to make to take the fun from the boy's life but to protect those who are around the pool in choosing to disregard the posted warnings he moved himself into a dangerous spot I say it again in choosing because it's a choice everybody right when God has his precepts in front of us and the world the wisdom of the world it's a choice it's a choice after what I preached Sunday it's a choice got to choose and in choosing to disregard posted warnings because as I preached Sunday some things are not you have you've sinned already but this has the potential to lead you into sin this is a warning sign this is something be careful of this that could lead in this direction can you say Amen they ignored and by choosing to disregard posted warnings I think the message has a lot of posted warnings for us in doing that he this kid moved himself into Danger and so he's like this young man we often don't see the looming dangers or we minimize the consequences of stepping into sin how much can it hurt we asked ourselves unfortunately you and I have a very limited perspective God on the other hand sees every possible scenario and their resulting joys and sorrows how many would agree tonight that we have a very limited perspective come on now let's be humble we have a very limited perspective but God has the greatest perspective and God sees every possible scenario and the resulting Joys and sorrows Joyce you should say Joys or Sorrows because the scenarios could be joys or could be Sorrows God sees all that he sees the scenarios he says have you ever entered one of those corn mazes and they're having those now I don't know if you've been through a corn maze yet but at every Junction in the corn maze you're saying should I turn right should I turn left perhaps and you're trying to figure out the corn means okay trying to go through it and with every Wrong Turn and Dead End you get more confused about where you are in the maze and the location of the correct path leading to the exit if you only had a bird's eye view it would be a lot easier can you say Amen if you had a guide a trustworthy Source perch the top of a real high ladder you'd have help in making the right choices to successfully navigate the maze in life we can consistently make right choices and enjoy much good in life by following God's guidelines and God's boundaries can you say Amen he has a much taller ladder he's looking from a much taller place and he sees this maze how many would agree we're in a maze of this world how many would agree that the young people are in her maze a corn maze trying to navigate which direction to go way worse than it was 20 years ago way worse than it was 10 years ago it's a corn maze how wonderful it would be and how wonderful it is I can tell you tonight we've got a god with a bird's eye view let's take it further we got a guy within we got a god with an eagle's View because God the Great Eagle is looking from the top and he can see go this way go this way go this way and this will get you out of this world and bring you to a rapture I said it'll bring you to a rapture this word this word is not just to keep us holy Christians it's to bring us to a rapture it's to bring us to The Great Escape that our children and us can get out of here and friends I said it to you Sunday we might we must be close one of the greatest things that hit me on Sunday and I didn't drive it home enough I don't know if I did but it hit me when I got only been thinking about for two or three days is that how can somebody stand and admit that we are at the full manifestation of Sodom and Gomorrah in the 60s he preached two things flashing red light I don't know how many listened to it two things that are a sign of the coming of the Lord is soon number one in the days of Noah the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were pretty and they fell by it pornography all the increase in Beauty and the modesty in women we've seen that start in the 50s and 60s and we've seen that but we didn't see the full manifestation yet of the Sodom and Gomorrah spirit that had to come because Jesus said as in the days of Sodom we are here and my thought was how could anybody buck up against me talking about modesty to the sisters of our church and the brothers as well and still admit that we're in the time of Sodom where we're rubbing shoulders with it every day how could anybody say I don't know if that's I think that's overboard I think that's cool how could you be too extreme with the spirits as prevalent they are trying to take our children I'm not sure that you could be of too extreme unless you make it just legalism and not preach it by the Holy Spirit but don't buck up against preachers that would seem they're making an extreme not when the homosexual spirit is so prevalent time to trying to take our daughters trying to take our sons trying to pervert our minds I'm here to tell you that God put in place his precepts his word his statues even in the message of this hour to prepare us to be able to go through this time and here's the point if we've got the full manifestation of song Gomorrah here where some of us I know some of us are sick of it it's just it's grieving me more and more I say this we must be very close to the coming of the Lord said we must be very close to the coming of the Lord and so be it even so come quickly Lord Jesus I'm ready to go you got your plans you got this you got to do this next weekend you got this plan for retirement go ahead and do it and and I do it too but listen my heart says I'm ready to step out of this any moment God calls us home I'm ready to get out of here and we are close friends can you say Amen do you believe that he's he's he's saying God says that this way do you believe that I love you and want to bless you with provision and protection then commit to my boundaries they are good they are for your good because I am good from God's Eternal perspective God does life with us asking do you want to avoid heartache in your life follow my precepts don't deviate you want to avoid addiction follow my precepts don't deviate you want to be successful in business follow my precepts don't deviate from it you want to experience true meaningful love follow my precepts and don't deviate from them you might have to wait for genuine real love but don't ever go away from his precepts but sometimes we get in our heads that we know better than God so we make willful choices outside of his boundaries and then must suffer the consequences so we should spend time reflecting on our life and how choosing to live with God's boundaries has protected you but also look at the times you willfully Step Beyond his umbrella of protection and had to endure the Fallout here's the thing about Sin the repercussions aren't always immediately evident sometimes we think we've gotten away with it but sin eventually demands our payment unless we each come to understand and this is important unless we each come to understand God loves me and I can trust him we will never walk through life dependent on the character of God to make the right choices I'm going to say it again I'm not you see this is before you can talk about dress you can talk about boundaries you can talk about rules all you want to but something has to drop deeper and this is what d That's what I said about David he said I love thy law David's not saying I have to do this he's saying I love it he come to a place I love it I love your precepts the more the more detail that God's made it for me the better I embrace it I love it I haven't I'm not bucking up against it when I read that quote of Moses when I read that quote of the Prophet Nathan when I read that thing I'm all over it I'm saying Lord you said that for a reason and I would never dump that out there's got to be a reason that you said it I love it because of this unless we come to understand that God loves me and I can trust him don't talk about all the details addressing to you do you trust God do you know that he loves you unless we get that we will never walk through life dependent on the character of God to make the right choices aren't you glad God gives us another mind aren't you glad he sent us the mind of Christ so if he sent us his mind through the thoughts of God and the mind of Christ which is in the soul brother Abraham says we must fill our hearts with his word fill our hearts with his word not fill our hearts with entertainments all the time we need a Revival in our hearts and filling our hearts with the word we need a Revival of repentance and we need a Revival in our thought life and we need as brother Brown says a Revival now friends I know there's things promised further for the bride but I don't look for that as much as and I say that respectfully I'm under expectation of what God would do in our lives before we get out of here but when you read about Revival brother Bradham says there's other things that we are doing for God to come and do those things we're not trying to make a Revival happen and one of the things he said as he was watching Lake Michigan in Chicago he says I noticed over there he said this great he said the the waters coming up with Great Waves because the wind was coming but he says what it was doing is brushing up all the trash that was in the water and blowing it up on the beach and blowing up in the side and he said that's a Revival when God begins to move and move all the trash out of our lives then the water's clean then you can have a real Revival and God clean up all the trash in our lives then we start to have a Revival not we work it up by the music now that we were you know we're not totally living right but we're just gonna we want to get a good feeling I want you to have more than a good feeling I want it to be genuine to be real when you shout when you dance and listen you're welcome to do it and some people don't give them themselves enough freedom to do it but you I want to know when you do it there's a life there that's saying I love his law I love his word I'm stimulated by the revelation of his word I'm not sure you get a revelation there's not if there's not a stimulation that goes with it God's word has a stimulation that goes with his word when it's revealed to your heart but we never are working up these things we're never trying to make the the Dynamics work or try to push to try to make those work we're we're ordering our lives by the word of God we're saying Lord make me more prayerful God let me just be more sincere these are the things that God would come down and tell his Prophet if he could just do this or didn't know it was if you could just have more prayer lines no no he said the prophet personally if you'll be more sincere if there's something wrong in your life correct that correct it let all the trash be washed to the to the side and then watch the other things happen in your life don't be dependent upon the other another person's experience they may be shouting and rejoicing and getting something from God but we never compare ourselves we know where we're at with God we want the conviction of God in our heart and then when you know you've got something solid there if it makes you rejoice if it makes you shout if it makes you dance praise be to God but only you know if it's genuine on the inside only you know if you've made contact with God really made contact we don't want to borrow or imitate somebody else we want to know in our heart Something's Happened to me and now I want to rejoice in that we need to move all the trash out and then watch the other things happen get rid of this constant resistance if you have it tonight if you're listening you have a resistance to the quotes a resistance to the guidelines we need to be embracing them trusting them God breathed on this generation somebody somebody's broken the trust in this message somebody's done it the enemy's done this thing the things that the prophet said were for a reason they were for this age it was for our protection don't mess with God's boundaries don't mess with God's precepts say God put something within me that David had that my love is such a love for your law for yours statues for your principles all those things I broke it down a few years ago I'm closing now I broke it down a few years ago precepts um statues the law the testimonies there's five or six different things there and actually they are similar but they all have a little bit different meaning some of the precepts are some of the breakdown of practical things that come off off of the law and so David said David didn't leave any of them out when he said I love all these things I failed I I made a mistake but I'm I'm I'm I'm backlord by your grace how many knows that his repentance was there in Psalms uh uh somebody help me out Psalms 50 I think it was 53 where his repentance he Lord he said Lord Purge me with hyssop Lord build the walls of Jerusalem God I Repent before his repentance was thorough Lord never let me do this again and it's so deeply moved him after his mistake that he's saying Lord I am no longer going to take the risk of trying to get around certain precepts I'm going to Value every one of them is anybody listening here tonight I love them because I love you I trust them because I trust you I trust that there's a power behind them and there's a protection that goes with them there's an umbrella that goes with them that will protect me even when I can't see things in the corn maze myself you're watching over me and you gave me this word at this age so that you could Hew out a people Hew out a bride to mold a bride a masterpiece in this age that will escape pornography that will escape these things of this Earth that will escape the homosexual spirit that will escape the sexual dirty spirit in this age there's gonna be a group of young people there's gonna be a bride that escapes all these things that overcomes all these things and why because God was faithful to bring his word to this generation God was faithful to not only bring his word but to pour out his spirit in the last days can you say amen he said the Holy Spirit had been bound for almost 2 000 years by Creeds and dogmas but he said it's to be released in the evening time by the evening time messenger friends it wasn't just doctrine that was released to us it wasn't just the Seven Seals but through the ministry of the last days I'll release my Holy Ghost to the people they'll have full access to the holy spirit in their lives and then there will be a bride rise and say I love this word I love his laws I'm not dumping out any of this scripture it all has relevance to me I don't want to be a one-man denomination because denomination starts picking and choosing what they want out of this the days of Miracles are passed that doesn't apply today First Corinthians 7 doesn't play to a woman's hair today it only applied them we don't make those decisions we say if God valued it and God accurately echoed it again through his Prophet his age we value it we're leaving it alone we're not messing with it if God said it I believe it that settles it I love his law I love his word Lord I want you to know tonight I may not understand every detail of this word but I want him to know I love this word I trust this word I have a full confidence in it and that's what we need in young people we need a group of people to rise and say I have one honor 100 confidence in this word and the message of Christ for the last days and I'm all in I'm all in let God see see I can't see that in you sometimes there's characteristics in us to say Well they're playing they're playing games with this thing because they're up and down from one week to the next they don't know where they stand but you see God sees that that resonating thing out of you say God I I may be I may not feel like the strongest Christian today but he looks inside and the Soul says they're all in let God look at my life on the inside and he can say they're all in they're not exiting they're not leaving in their hearts they're all in Let God see that in me tonight he really loves my word he he failed last week he he he he made a decision that was maybe not my perfect will he was in my permissive will but he repented he recognized what he did wrong but overall I can look at his heart and I can see he's all in he's not leaving Hallelujah I love him tonight and I love his word let's Stand Together Charles Wesley wrote A Hymn and risk going to read the the lyric to you I don't think we know it here sometime I'd like to get in the lyrics and sing it applies a little bit to this I just I've always enjoyed it the Collinsworth family sings it traditional hymn Charles Wesleyan they wrote thousands of hymns but this one's called I want a principle within I want a principle Within Me of watchful Godly fear a sensibility of sin pain to feel it near I want the first approach to feel of Pride or wrong desire to catch the wandering of my will and quench the kindling fire the second verse says from thee that I know more may stray no more thy goodness grieve grant me the foul follow all I pray the tender conscience give quick is the apple of an eye oh God my conscience make Awake My Soul When sin is nigh and keep it still awake the third verse says almighty God of Truth and Love to me thy power in part the mountain from my soul removed the hardness from my heart o May the least Omission pain my reawakened soul and drive me to the blood again which makes the wounded whole praise be to God I want a principle deep within that temptation as soon as it's there I'm so awakened to what's in my soul that I would sense it right away say Lord protect me from that that's how we want to live friends amen father we thank you for this word tonight we thank you Lord for your precepts we love your precepts we love this word I say it to you often now that if we if we didn't have the words of a prophet throughout the scripture where would we be and Lord I wouldn't have anything to instruct to order my family or my home and order my life I wouldn't have anything to go on and you have given us your Commandments your precepts your words Lord the spoken word is the Original Seed and in the original seed is power Lord if we get back to the original again it's power for the Sons and Daughters of God to come back into that again and Lord we love it and we're thankful for it and we we're so grateful Lord tonight in this little place with a smaller crowd this evening we're so grateful that your presence is near us that Lord you have pointed us in your direction Lord makes us want to love you deeper and know you deeper father and I pray Lord that my heart as a pastor would come closer and closer and closer to these things not just by mechanics or intellectual but closer to your presence Lord let the congregation see a deeper walk with God in the pastor let the congregation let my children I know Lord they respect me and those things but Lord let my children and my wife see even a deeper walk and a closer walk with you let them see what the David had here let them see there's a man if he has one great love in life he loves the precepts and the words of God he loves it it is his obsession Granite father I may not be a success in money or other things but let me in this Journey with the success of my children being able to see the presence of the Lord in my life and that I valued what your Prophet said granted Lord and bless your people tonight as we we're going to close the service now but we're thankful for the the steps that you can order in the word of God the our steps can be ordered every day because you give us what to walk in thank you Father thank you that you help us make it through the corn maze because of your Eagle's eye view thank you Lord for the posting signs of warning thank you when you send someone even the body of Christ and they give us a little warning thank you for those little things Lord so you're still speaking you're still watching over us you're still protecting us Lord we don't do these things to be mean and the convictions and things that we try to share with not only our youth but our sisters and brothers here Lord you didn't intend for those things to be trapping or putting the people in bondage that's not what your intention was and it's certainly not my intention either Lord they'll never let the enemy tell that to the people in congregation here or may they see my heart that I'm echoing and saying again what the spoken word has said putting it up before the people and we know as Paul taught us Lord if we keep beholding and looking at that into that law of life and into that word where chains Lord our countenances change our life has changed just by continuing to be looking at it and beholding it Lord because Lord You're Beautiful your face is all I see when your eyes are on this child your grace Your Grace abounds in me give F Lord [Music]
