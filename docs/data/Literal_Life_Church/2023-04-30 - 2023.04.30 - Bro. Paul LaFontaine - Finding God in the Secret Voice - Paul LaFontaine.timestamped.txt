[0:00] and uh we'll be mindful of the time and
[0:03] yet we know that we want to give time to
[0:04] the word of God can you say Amen
[0:06] praise the Lord so if you would turn
[0:08] with me again to our scripture in first
[0:10] kin First Kings 19 and we'll remind you
[0:14] and Echo that scripture again from
[0:16] Elijah's experience here and then
[0:18] uh
[0:20] First Corinthians 19 and we'll just read
[0:23] one verse and we'll read one in
[0:24] Revelations First Corinthians 19 and
[0:27] verse 10 verse excuse me First
[0:30] Corinthians 19 and verse 11. he said go
[0:34] forth and stand upon the mount before
[0:35] the Lord and behold the Lord pass by and
[0:38] a great and strong wind rent the
[0:40] mountains and break in pieces the Rocks
[0:42] before the Lord but the Lord was not in
[0:44] the wind and after the wind and
[0:46] earthquake but the Lord was not in the
[0:48] earthquake and after the earthquake of
[0:50] fire but the Lord was not in the fire
[0:53] and after the fire a still Small Voice
[0:57] and God showed Elijah that I will be in
[1:01] the still Small Voice Revelations
[1:03] chapter 10 and verse 7 and I'm going to
[1:05] connect these two verses because we move
[1:08] from the Days of Elijah to our day in
[1:11] the Fulfillment of scripture and we're
[1:13] living in Revelations 10 right now
[1:15] and Revelations 10 if we get time later
[1:19] in the message we'll break it down if
[1:20] not we'll do it the next service
[1:22] Revelations 10 and we're just picking up
[1:25] verse 7 to the day we live in but in the
[1:28] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:30] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:34] of God should be finished as he had
[1:37] declared to his servants the prophet
[1:41] so if the Sabbath Angel is to be a vocal
[1:43] cord to bring the final mystery singular
[1:46] mystery to the Church of God in the last
[1:48] days I think it's pretty important we
[1:51] know who the seventh messenger is
[1:54] I think it's important pretty important
[1:56] we know who the seventh angel is
[1:58] and all these were seven Messengers
[2:01] angels in his right hand say was an
[2:03] angel
[2:04] in the other dimension no angels can be
[2:06] Earthly Messengers bodies can you say in
[2:08] bodies and so it's important that we
[2:11] know who the seventh messenger is
[2:13] because he's the one who will be used of
[2:15] God to Break Forth this mystery to his
[2:18] people and I want to title this today
[2:20] just to Fort for a short time finding
[2:23] God in the secret voice
[2:25] Heavenly Father we graciously thank you
[2:29] Lord for the mercies that you extend to
[2:32] us the blood of Jesus Christ the message
[2:34] of Christ of the last days and Lord
[2:36] we're grateful for what you've done Lord
[2:39] not only financially for the church but
[2:41] mostly Lord the Revival the spiritual
[2:43] the changed lives that we observe over
[2:46] and over again and it can be a little
[2:48] child that weeps at an altar and they
[2:50] recognize the presence of the Lord and
[2:52] their need for God lord from the small
[2:55] things to the great things you're doing
[2:57] a mighty work and Lord it shows you're
[2:59] in in charge of your church Lord we want
[3:02] to yield to you we want your Holy Spirit
[3:04] to continue to guide us during these
[3:06] times and we know when we walk outside
[3:08] these doors we walk into a great
[3:10] Darkness but Lord the light that we
[3:13] receive through your word here will be
[3:15] enough light to be able to shine in this
[3:17] darkness and to pierce the darkness Lord
[3:19] help us to live lives that are
[3:21] Sanctified dedicated to you Lord
[3:24] Spirit-filled lives Lord with our lamps
[3:27] trimmed and burning Lord for we're
[3:29] burning at the the Midnight Hour Lord
[3:31] we're burning the oil at the midnight
[3:32] time and I pray father we'd stay filled
[3:35] with the true spirit of God God come and
[3:37] meet with us today as we deliver your
[3:39] word in Jesus name we ask him amen amen
[3:43] God bless you may be seated
[3:48] so we have been covering some things
[3:51] concerning the stability that we find in
[3:53] the word of God and I am preaching
[3:56] recently of the one source that God sent
[3:59] to us in these particular times for our
[4:02] stability and our security and uh you
[4:06] know God hones down and bring things
[4:08] down many times God can speak through
[4:11] many things God can speak through many
[4:13] uh venues and different things Through
[4:15] the Ages but it seems like in his
[4:18] mystery at the end time he really brings
[4:20] it down to a secret a mystery and and he
[4:24] wants to show us where that place is
[4:27] that he dwells Elijah had to know uh
[4:31] from God he had to be taught I'm not in
[4:34] the earthquake I'm not in the wind why
[4:37] is he saying that because we could look
[4:39] for God in different things but at this
[4:41] particular moment in Elijah's life he
[4:43] wanted to tell Elijah I'm not in the
[4:45] earthquake I'm not in the wind that's
[4:47] ripping the the Rocks apart I I'm not in
[4:50] the in the fire but I want to let you
[4:52] know where I am and where you can find
[4:54] me and that's in this still small voice
[4:57] and so when we get to the end and I'll
[4:59] just throw this out to you when you get
[5:00] to the seventh mystery the seventh seal
[5:03] there's not much written about it but I
[5:05] can tell you it's similar in nature and
[5:07] characteristic when it says and when he
[5:09] had opened the seventh seal which is the
[5:12] final seal when he opened the seventh
[5:15] seal there was silence in heaven for the
[5:18] space of a half hour
[5:19] so there is a span of time that there's
[5:22] something happening so mysteriously and
[5:25] so secretly that the public will not
[5:28] know that it's going on now God is not
[5:31] all that always that way God has a way
[5:34] to display himself through the
[5:36] supernatural to the entire world God can
[5:39] do anything he wants can you say amen
[5:41] God can open up the blinded eyes God can
[5:44] raise the dead can you say amen and he's
[5:47] done that and can still do that but when
[5:50] Believers come to the depth of the
[5:52] mystery of God it's not that God would
[5:55] display himself to The World God doesn't
[5:58] want to just show off to the world and
[6:00] God doesn't want to just endorse you and
[6:02] prove that you're right to everybody
[6:04] it's kind of like what they said at the
[6:06] cross Jesus come down and prove yourself
[6:08] prove that you we believe you're the Son
[6:10] of God come down and prove yourself the
[6:12] soldiers were were kind of taunting him
[6:15] saying if you're the Son of God come
[6:16] down God doesn't show off for anybody
[6:19] God has bound his word can you say amen
[6:22] and so though he can display things to
[6:24] the world sometimes when he comes to the
[6:26] final mystery it's a secret to the rest
[6:30] of the world and it's only for believers
[6:33] to catch it
[6:36] praise the lord well I didn't get a lot
[6:38] of amends on that but if I need to I can
[6:41] go back through the scripture and show
[6:42] you
[6:43] God can change
[6:45] his his God can change his his display
[6:49] and he can show us that you have to find
[6:52] him but it's in a mystery it's in a
[6:54] secret and he's going to make himself
[6:56] let me go to Jesus if you don't
[6:58] understand let me go to Jesus when his
[7:00] disciples ask him why do you speak to us
[7:02] in Parables why why can't you just
[7:05] plainly say it out there he said because
[7:07] it is given to you to know the mysteries
[7:10] of the Kingdom it's given to you so I'll
[7:13] sit down with right now with you and
[7:15] I'll share the secret of what the
[7:17] parable means but it's not given to some
[7:21] I'm just quoting Jesus now
[7:23] so there is a voice within the voice you
[7:26] can hear a literal voice of even Jesus
[7:28] you can hear a literal voice of even a
[7:30] messenger can you say Amen but there's a
[7:32] voice that's within the voice that
[7:34] speaks to his people that reveals a
[7:37] mystery that she needs to know and it's
[7:39] beyond Miracles it's beyond signs it's
[7:42] beyond wonders it's beyond signs in the
[7:44] heaven can you say Amen it's coming to
[7:46] the final thing that we need in our
[7:48] lives for stability
[7:50] can you say man because if you were
[7:52] depending on a miracle God will do it
[7:55] but if you're just depending on that
[7:57] then you might be disappointed when God
[7:59] chooses not to do a miracle that day
[8:03] am I going to stand alone here
[8:07] do I need to go to John 6 my favorite
[8:10] place in the Bible to talk about the
[8:12] third part of Jesus Ministry Jesus had
[8:14] three parts to his ministry he healed
[8:16] the sick great Supernatural things he
[8:19] discerned the thoughts of the people but
[8:21] there was a deeper part and in John
[8:23] chapter 6 we have the chapter starting
[8:25] with 5 000 followers who saw his
[8:28] miracles of multiplying the fishes and
[8:30] Loaves
[8:33] he they watched it he's got five
[8:36] thousand followers and he has to leave
[8:37] them because they're so excited about
[8:40] the food and they're so excited about
[8:42] the miracle and so excited that he had
[8:45] to exit because he feared they were
[8:47] going to take him and make him a king
[8:48] that's how enthused they were about
[8:50] Jesus
[8:52] I'm gonna teach you the word of God
[8:54] today I hope you're listening
[8:55] okay
[8:56] they were so enthused they were going to
[8:58] make him King it wasn't time for him to
[9:00] be a king he's obligated to the word of
[9:02] God so he's got to escape this big crowd
[9:05] we're ready to make you a king now it's
[9:07] not time for that the word doesn't say
[9:09] that now but in their enthusiasm for a
[9:11] true work of God and miracles of god
[9:14] they wanted to make own King Jesus exit
[9:16] and then they come back to him and he
[9:18] starts to speak things about the bread
[9:20] of life it's about eating it's about
[9:21] these spiritually partaking he says then
[9:23] he comes down he says does this offend
[9:25] you I'm the bread of life the next verse
[9:28] to say I can read them to you
[9:29] because many of his disciples come to
[9:33] him and said this is a hard saying why
[9:35] are you talking like this you're the
[9:37] bread of life just just do the Miracles
[9:44] many of his disciples left him at that
[9:47] point because they were tied to only the
[9:51] miracles of Jesus
[9:53] was it Jesus who did them yes if he does
[9:56] a miracle here today as far as visibly
[9:58] heals cancer how many believe he still
[10:00] does it he can raise the dead here today
[10:01] he can do anything he wants to do but if
[10:04] you're only tied to that you're not
[10:06] getting to the mystery of Christ in your
[10:08] life
[10:10] in one chapter he goes from 5 000
[10:14] followers to the last of the chapter to
[10:17] 12 left
[10:19] the Jesus you serve
[10:21] something happened
[10:24] he goes from 5 000 followers in one
[10:27] chapter down to 12 followers and one's a
[10:31] devil
[10:34] it's like Jesus what happened to your
[10:36] ministry everybody's left you
[10:38] everybody's gone where's the following
[10:40] where's the big crowds I'm afraid of big
[10:43] crowds
[10:44] I'm afraid of big big things because my
[10:48] Jesus when he gets to a certain point
[10:49] and begins to bring the word to the
[10:52] people then he starts to lose followers
[10:55] now if Jesus is the same yesterday today
[10:58] and forever how many believe he's the
[11:00] same today we often think of that
[11:02] scripture he's the same yesterday he can
[11:04] perform Miracles he can do the same he
[11:06] can do whatever he wants to do we
[11:07] believe that but that scripture also
[11:10] means that his nature is the same and
[11:12] that is he can show the world Miracles
[11:15] till he has thousands following him but
[11:17] when he starts bringing the word he'll
[11:19] start losing followers because people
[11:21] want the Miracles but they don't want
[11:23] the word
[11:26] that's why you have make-believers and
[11:28] unbelievers and
[11:29] Believers in every congregation
[11:32] and I'm going to add another one
[11:33] spectators
[11:37] Spectators they're not on the team
[11:40] fighting against the devil
[11:42] they're on the outskirts sitting on the
[11:44] app just watching everything looking for
[11:46] something to go wrong I guess
[11:49] and so Jesus comes to the end I didn't
[11:53] expect to get into this scripture but
[11:54] it's just to explain this is the nature
[11:56] at the end time when the Seven Seals
[11:59] revealed he said there was silence in
[12:01] heaven we don't like a god of Silence
[12:05] we don't like a guy God that's being
[12:07] silent or that's hard to find his still
[12:10] Small Voice that's too much work for us
[12:12] we want an audible voice we would like a
[12:16] prophecy and I'm not against prophecies
[12:17] we like something just so straight and
[12:19] so audible like that and so we tend to
[12:21] cling to those things as like my last
[12:24] series I talked about Divine love and
[12:25] Paul says we could have prophecies we
[12:28] could understand all Mysteries and yet
[12:30] not have the real thing of divine love
[12:31] and so it didn't dump out the gifts it
[12:33] didn't dump out what what the
[12:35] Pentecostal experience brought us but
[12:37] but when God take there's a reason God
[12:40] attracts our attention with the Miracles
[12:42] I said to you before I don't need
[12:45] another miracle to keep me in the
[12:46] message
[12:48] if God never did another miracle I'm
[12:51] stable upon the word of God
[12:53] now I pray for him to do Miracles
[12:56] because our teenagers need to see a God
[12:58] that's real
[13:00] and he will never stop doing those as
[13:02] our faith unites together can you say
[13:04] Amen he's able to do the impossible but
[13:07] personally I don't need to see another
[13:09] thing of blind eyes opener the dead race
[13:12] I've seen it I've watched it as a young
[13:14] kid I watched the man be prayed for and
[13:17] some of you were in that service in Lima
[13:19] I've watched a man completely blind be
[13:21] prayed for and Shout around the room his
[13:23] eyes completely completely became open I
[13:26] needed to see that and say my God is the
[13:28] same yesterday today and forever but now
[13:30] as I've grown as a Christian God can do
[13:33] it and I'll glorify my shout but if he
[13:35] doesn't do it I'm not leaving
[13:37] I'm not exiting I'm not questioning
[13:40] whether everything's true or not
[13:43] my experiences become deeper than that I
[13:45] fell in love fallen in love with the
[13:47] Jesus the the true Christ can you say
[13:49] Amen it's the Christ of the message it's
[13:52] not what he does it's who he is I've
[13:55] fallen in love with who he is
[13:58] [Applause]
[14:01] he's a person
[14:03] and he never wanted the children of
[14:05] Israel just to lean on all the Miracles
[14:06] they complained and said God we don't
[14:08] have any water give us the water God we
[14:09] don't have any food they were childish
[14:11] babies
[14:12] Pentecostal babies that needed signs to
[14:16] keep them going
[14:18] we want to go back to Egypt went to God
[14:20] we just go back to the world if God's
[14:22] not going to do another sign how
[14:24] immature
[14:25] God said that for 40 years they have not
[14:29] known my ways they know my works but
[14:32] they don't know my ways
[14:33] God wanted a people to come up close to
[14:36] him and get such in close relationship
[14:38] that they become one with Christ that
[14:42] this mystery see what are you talking
[14:44] about what Paul preached Christ The
[14:47] Mystery of God revealed
[14:50] Christ in you
[14:53] the hope of glory
[14:55] that's more than a miracle
[14:57] that's more than being a part of a
[14:59] movement
[15:00] that's more than shouting in dancing
[15:05] thank you
[15:08] so
[15:10] you know Jesus one chapter 5 000
[15:14] followers down to 12 and one's the devil
[15:17] and can I just mention what he said
[15:19] there because it goes with my theme
[15:20] finding God's secret voice you know what
[15:23] the key was of stability you know what
[15:25] kept Him in
[15:26] Peter didn't even understand all that
[15:28] was going on but he had a revelation
[15:30] simple Revelation this is the way he
[15:32] worded it
[15:34] he said
[15:36] Jesus said to the twelve you're going to
[15:38] go away also are you leaving come on now
[15:40] friends this is Jesus who you serve with
[15:43] 12 followers left
[15:45] 12.
[15:47] that doesn't seem like the numbers that
[15:49] the mega churches are bringing in
[15:53] how many true experiences of repentance
[15:55] and Holy Ghost is happening in those
[15:58] atmospheres not to be critical but God's
[16:01] Not About Numbers God's not about
[16:03] quantity he's about quality of the holy
[16:06] spirit in people's lives
[16:08] I'd rather preach to 10 people that are
[16:10] getting filled with the spirit than 200.
[16:16] Peter catches something because Jesus
[16:19] test him said you guys going to go away
[16:21] all also you're going to leave as well
[16:23] this is offending you are you going to
[16:25] go something rose up in Peter he says
[16:29] to whom shall we go
[16:33] so to Peter the Revelation was there are
[16:38] no other sources
[16:41] there is nothing else for me
[16:45] that's what what powerful words
[16:48] to whom shall we go I have found the
[16:50] source
[16:52] you are the source I'm not going
[16:55] anywhere I'm not going to get on Google
[16:57] and search something else I found my
[17:00] Christ I'm here to stay
[17:04] what did Jesus find what did they find
[17:07] in Jesus he said thou Peter said thou
[17:12] Hast the words
[17:14] of eternal life
[17:16] he didn't say you've got enough miracles
[17:18] to keep me
[17:20] wasn't the Miracles it was still still
[17:22] small voice
[17:23] what was calling Peter right at that
[17:25] moment the still Small Voice that was a
[17:27] voice within the voice that no education
[17:29] gave him no Seminary gave him
[17:32] and he said Peter Upon This Rock he said
[17:34] when he said thou with the Christ the
[17:36] son of me he says flesh and blood has
[17:37] not revealed this to you you didn't get
[17:39] it in college you didn't learn it by
[17:41] learning the father has sent you a
[17:43] revelation of who he is in this hour who
[17:45] I am and you're holding that Revelation
[17:47] in your heart and he's speaking it I
[17:49] don't even know completely what I found
[17:51] but I know I found him
[17:54] and I'm not going anywhere
[17:56] I'm here
[17:58] Jesus said a few scriptures earlier my
[18:00] words that I speak unto you he says the
[18:02] flesh profiteth nothing the flesh these
[18:05] are powerful words friends I'm way off
[18:08] of my notes today the flesh profiteth
[18:11] nothing
[18:13] but my words that I speak unto you they
[18:17] are Spirit they are life
[18:22] he's saying the same thing he said to
[18:23] Elijah
[18:25] it's not God in the earthquake it's not
[18:27] God in the Wind
[18:28] but you'll find him in the still small
[18:30] voice
[18:32] my words I speak unto you they are
[18:35] Spirit they are life
[18:39] so we've been getting into the stability
[18:42] and security that we find in the one
[18:44] source that God gave us in Christ in
[18:47] that still Small Voice in when he speaks
[18:49] to us so uh intimately through his word
[18:52] that's the stable voice can you say amen
[18:55] and to speak these things is to be so
[18:59] that we not fall into the Trap of
[19:01] turning to other things for our
[19:03] stability
[19:05] there's really only one thing left in
[19:07] this world we can trust
[19:10] and put confidence in now
[19:13] and that's the word of God
[19:15] there's only thing one one thing left in
[19:17] this world that will not corrupt
[19:19] everything else will corrupt political
[19:22] systems are corrupt government systems
[19:25] are corrupt
[19:26] Hollywood has been corrupted almost
[19:28] since it started
[19:30] everything has corruption in it but the
[19:33] Bible says the only thing that's
[19:35] Incorruptible is the word of God
[19:39] it's the only source left that we turn
[19:42] to
[19:45] and so we see then that because it won't
[19:48] corrupt that's the thing and then he
[19:50] says some other things like all other
[19:51] things besides what he gave us to live
[19:55] by and to bring us the Holy Ghost and
[19:57] debris assurance and to bring a
[19:59] stability in this hour he said every
[20:01] other thing will be shaken God will
[20:04] shake everything else including
[20:07] religious intellectual experience and
[20:09] cause it to fail in your eyes because he
[20:13] because he wants you to know the only
[20:14] stability is in the word of this age
[20:18] so everything's shaken here's some
[20:20] scriptures Hebrews 12 25 see that ye
[20:23] refuse not him that speaketh notice Paul
[20:26] doesn't say in Hebrews see that you
[20:29] refuse not him that's doing miracles
[20:31] see that you refuse him not him that's
[20:35] speaking
[20:36] the power is what he's speaking
[20:41] the power to live is when he's speaking
[20:44] can you say Amen see that you refuse not
[20:47] him that speaker for if they escaped not
[20:48] who refused him that spake on Earth much
[20:51] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[20:53] from him that speaketh from Heaven whose
[20:56] voice then shook the Earth but now he
[20:58] has promised saying yet once more I
[21:00] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[21:02] and this word yet once more signifying
[21:05] the signify the removing of those things
[21:09] that are shaken as of things that are
[21:11] made that those things which cannot be
[21:14] shaken May remain wherefore we receive a
[21:18] kingdom which cannot be moved
[21:23] let us have Grace whereby we may serve
[21:25] god acceptedly with reverence and godly
[21:27] fear so he shakes everything and the
[21:29] only thing left is the unmovable thing
[21:32] the word of God that we live by that's
[21:33] what we should live by says another
[21:35] thing in second Thessalonians 2 verse 1
[21:37] I'd be so because I want to take this
[21:40] further all kingdoms will be shaken all
[21:42] political systems will be shaken
[21:44] religious denominations will be shaken
[21:46] if they're not based upon the word of
[21:48] God everything will shake underneath us
[21:50] can you say amen and God will do that
[21:52] but here's another thing that shakes
[21:54] look at this in second Thessalonians 2
[21:56] verse one now we beseech your brethren
[21:59] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:00] and by our gathering together unto him
[22:02] and just make a note the rest of verse
[22:04] the rest of the chapters about the
[22:06] Antichrist Spirit but look what he says
[22:08] that ye be not soon shaken in mind
[22:13] so he shakes every Kingdom of this Earth
[22:16] but we're it's deeper than that now
[22:18] Satan wants to shake us in our thinking
[22:22] Shake us in our emotions
[22:24] Shake us in our minds to where we're
[22:27] troubled and we're feeling shaky and
[22:30] we're feeling nervous where in our minds
[22:33] Paul said that'll happen in the last
[22:35] days when the Antichrist spirit is
[22:37] beginning to manifest itself people
[22:39] could be shaken in their mind but he's
[22:42] saying you soon not be shaken or be
[22:44] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[22:46] nor by letter as from us as the day of
[22:48] Christ is at hand let no man deceive you
[22:51] by any means for that day shall not come
[22:54] except there come a falling away first
[22:56] and then that man of sin be revealed the
[22:58] Son of Perdition we're in the day of the
[23:00] revealing of the Antichrist spirit and I
[23:02] can tell you my friend if you're
[23:03] listening it is not just some Russian
[23:06] thing it's not communism but Jesus said
[23:09] it'd be so close to the real thing that
[23:12] it would deceive the very elective
[23:13] possible the Antichrist spirit is here
[23:16] it's working but it's not out there in
[23:19] Russia can you say man it's of a
[23:21] religious nature it's trying to
[23:23] impersonate the true Christ
[23:25] yeah
[23:26] and you can see things that just soak
[23:28] look so close to the real thing and it's
[23:31] only the discernment of the Lord that'll
[23:33] allow you to be able to detect The
[23:35] Faults from the real
[23:37] that's the day we live in no wonder our
[23:39] minds could become shaken
[23:42] Lord what do I believe
[23:44] what's real
[23:46] are you in that God I'm saying things
[23:49] that our young people probably think God
[23:50] are you in that
[23:52] it seems so real are you in it we better
[23:54] pray we better know
[23:57] let no man deceive you
[24:00] I want to know that I know that I know
[24:03] and so he messes with the mind he messes
[24:05] with the Mind Satan's messing with the
[24:08] Mind Satan's messing with absolutes
[24:11] I mean you know Satan's messing with
[24:12] absolutes obvious one is the the
[24:15] absolute in science and the absolute and
[24:18] the word of God guys are guys and girls
[24:20] are girls
[24:21] now Satan's messing with the absolutes
[24:24] you know when I read the news now I just
[24:26] I want to quit reading it because every
[24:27] day this stuff is in the news and you
[24:30] know we got the trans and then and then
[24:32] now yesterday I read that there's
[24:34] somebody decides they want to be a
[24:36] handicapped person and I forget the term
[24:38] but they want to be in a wheelchair and
[24:40] they they choose to look like they're
[24:42] handicapped and they're not and you know
[24:44] I'm sitting there thinking I gotta quit
[24:46] reading this stuff because it's messing
[24:47] with me
[24:49] it's like there is no sound thinking
[24:52] anymore
[24:57] but you know let's not talk about the
[25:00] trans gender
[25:02] let's talk about how he messes with
[25:05] absolutes in the word of God
[25:12] he comes within the message of the last
[25:14] days the movement of the message not the
[25:16] message of Jesus Christ for the last
[25:17] days but the movement and he's working
[25:19] among us to mess with the absolutes
[25:25] so people are shaken in mind
[25:28] I just tell the devil all the time don't
[25:29] mess with my absolutes
[25:32] it's established in my heart this is
[25:34] God's absolute Malachi 4 5 is an
[25:36] absolute to me who who the Sabbath Angel
[25:38] is an absolute to me I know who that is
[25:42] I know who Malachi 4 5 and 6 is
[25:44] don't mess with my absolute
[25:47] but he does
[25:48] and it's interesting that his attacks
[25:50] start to you know Satan young people
[25:52] listen Satan is not this red creature
[25:55] with a pitchfork
[25:58] if you had that in Sunday school or
[26:01] whatever
[26:02] that is not the devil
[26:05] pitchfork
[26:07] Tale
[26:09] red you got that there's the devil the
[26:12] devil works right within the church to
[26:15] deceive you to the wrong thing
[26:20] how do you prove that from the Garden of
[26:22] Eden
[26:24] he was subtle he was slick he was
[26:26] handsome
[26:28] stood upright
[26:30] talking to Eve
[26:32] and all he did was put a question mark
[26:34] at the end of the word of God we need to
[26:35] question this here's the word this is
[26:37] what God Said yehad God said he's
[26:39] actually quoting the word by the way so
[26:41] the devil was not in this Pitchfork red
[26:43] creature he was a Slicker that was
[26:46] quoting the word
[26:48] now if we want to grow up and be Saints
[26:50] here let's grow up and be Saints I'm not
[26:53] here to just Pat people on the back
[26:55] listen
[26:56] the devil is our adversary but he's
[26:59] subtle like the Beast was in the Garden
[27:02] of Eden
[27:03] and he quotes the word he quotes the
[27:06] word
[27:07] but it puts a question mark at the end
[27:10] of it
[27:12] right he's the one that puts the
[27:13] question mark on
[27:14] God said to Adam and you believe it
[27:17] even when you don't completely
[27:18] understand it I'll show you I'll show
[27:20] you understanding I'll let you know over
[27:22] time but I want you to believe it
[27:26] he just wants us to be brainwashed
[27:28] people
[27:29] just believe it and not understand it
[27:33] well if you're brainwashed by the right
[27:35] thing it wouldn't be so bad
[27:37] I don't mind being brainwashed by the
[27:39] true word of God
[27:41] I just wash all my thinking away so I
[27:44] can think like the the God wants me to
[27:46] think
[27:50] so he's subtle he was a Slicker he
[27:53] wasn't a red creature with a pitchfork
[27:55] he's quoting the word and
[27:58] he's deceiving Eve that way and he's
[28:01] still the same way we must know let me
[28:04] just get further here we must know where
[28:06] we stand today
[28:09] because of this we must know where we're
[28:10] standing we must know what we're
[28:12] standing on if we're on the wrong thing
[28:14] God will move it if we're on the wrong
[28:17] Foundation God will move and crash that
[28:19] a foundation and we will watch it fall
[28:22] apart kind of like quicksand quicksand
[28:25] is not regular sand sand is bad enough
[28:28] you remember Jesus said don't build your
[28:30] life on the sand
[28:32] building on a rock which is a revelation
[28:35] of Christ build your marriage build your
[28:38] life young person build your life build
[28:41] your career on the rock of a revelation
[28:44] of who Jesus is build everything your
[28:47] finances build it on the Rock but he
[28:50] says he that builds it on Sand is
[28:52] seeking sand it's movable and quicksand
[28:54] is work because it sucks you in
[28:56] quicksand is a mixture of water and sand
[28:59] together
[29:01] quicksand is a mixture of water and sand
[29:03] together and water is movable boy it
[29:05] doesn't take science to figure that out
[29:07] water is not water is movable and you
[29:10] put you put uh water around or close to
[29:15] that sand it becomes quick sand and you
[29:17] can't step in it because it's going to
[29:19] suck you in you're going to be sliding
[29:21] and then you're going to go down because
[29:23] why don't build your life upon that we
[29:26] must know where we stand can you say man
[29:28] we must know what we're standing on in
[29:31] the hour we live in can you say man and
[29:34] then when we're standing on something
[29:35] that's wrong I want you to know God
[29:38] loves you enough that if you're on the
[29:39] wrong Foundation he will shake it
[29:45] not to discourage you but to say it's
[29:48] time
[29:48] to get your life on the right foundation
[29:55] Jeremiah 23 12 swear for
[29:58] Jeremiah 23 12 wherefore their way shall
[30:00] be unto them as as slippery ways
[30:03] slippery ways
[30:05] that's my demonstration this morning is
[30:07] slippery
[30:09] he says they they that their way shall
[30:12] let be them as a slippery ways in the
[30:14] darkness so it's not just slippery it's
[30:15] in the darkest they shall be driven on
[30:17] and fall therein for I will bring evil
[30:20] upon them even the year their visitation
[30:21] saith the Lord it's slippery ways
[30:23] there's no Foundation to it there's no
[30:25] word there's no voice of the Lord there
[30:27] there's nothing to base their lives so
[30:28] they choose to live on the slippery ways
[30:30] and they become unstable the word
[30:33] unstables in the Bible James 1 8 a
[30:35] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[30:37] ways
[30:39] second Peter 2 14 says having eyes full
[30:41] of adultery and that cannot cease from
[30:44] sin beguiling unstable Souls a heart
[30:47] they have exercised with covenants
[30:48] practices cursed children beguiling
[30:51] unstable souls and then second Peter
[30:53] once again Peter says about Paul as also
[30:56] in all Paul's Epistles speaking in them
[30:58] of these things in which are some things
[31:00] hard to be understood he says the
[31:04] prophet Paul brought some things that
[31:06] even Peter said they're hard to be
[31:07] understood which they that are unlearned
[31:10] and unstable wrestle with
[31:14] rest wrestle with Peter says I I don't
[31:18] understand everything Paul's saying but
[31:21] for unstable unlearned people they
[31:24] wrestle with it as they do also other
[31:27] scriptures
[31:28] did he just com did he just compare
[31:31] Paul's writings with scriptures
[31:35] he did
[31:37] they wrestle you know the thing is is if
[31:40] you wrestle with the messenger you you
[31:42] end up wrestling with a lot of scripture
[31:46] other scripture
[31:49] unto their own destruction we need to
[31:53] know what we're standing on we need God
[31:56] to bring stability to our lives can I
[31:58] get a response this morning we need to
[32:01] know that we're standing on the right
[32:03] foundation can you say Amen
[32:06] and we're being challenged of what we
[32:08] believe what we really have at the core
[32:10] of ourselves there's a discovery going
[32:13] on in many people's lives growing up in
[32:15] the message
[32:16] they're discovering things sometimes
[32:19] and they're discovering that they're
[32:21] wearing out from just doing the right
[32:24] thing on the outside that that's wearing
[32:26] out that doing the right thing is not
[32:29] enough I'm going to articulate this
[32:31] because I feel the lord gave it to me
[32:32] there's great discoveries going on and
[32:35] sometimes it can be embarrassing but
[32:37] many lives there's discoveries that go
[32:39] on that realize wow I thought I was on
[32:43] the right foundation and I'm not
[32:47] I thought I had the Holy Ghost and I
[32:51] don't
[32:54] I'm not preaching anybody here that has
[32:56] it they know that they have it
[32:57] but their Discovery is as I thought I
[33:00] was here and I did the right thing and
[33:02] I'm wearing out of just doing the right
[33:04] thing because Mommy and Daddy said to do
[33:06] it and because the messenger said to do
[33:08] it and because this that and the other
[33:09] but that's wearing out because why the
[33:11] times we live in your foundation has to
[33:14] be more sure than that
[33:16] there's too many demonic forces that
[33:18] we're fighting against you can't be on
[33:20] sinking sand you can't have a foul's
[33:22] nation that's shaky you've got to know
[33:24] where you stand to go against this devil
[33:26] he's subtle he's slick you got to know
[33:29] where you stand and so though this
[33:31] discovery that's happened Lord I realize
[33:33] I had a sister tell me the other day I
[33:35] had a preacher there's a pastor that was
[33:37] here and sharing his testimony I grew up
[33:39] in the message and even got into
[33:40] preaching and I didn't have what I
[33:42] needed I thank God for that type of
[33:44] honesty because I'll just say this it
[33:46] might be embarrassing to realize you
[33:48] don't have the right foundation it might
[33:49] be embarrassing but what's more
[33:51] embarrassing to meet it at the end
[33:54] I say it's worse to continue pretending
[33:58] than it is to be honest I don't have the
[34:01] right foundation and I need an altar in
[34:04] my heart
[34:06] don't ever be ashamed to admit the
[34:09] foundation's not right and to say well I
[34:12] can just keep building no you can't
[34:14] build if you have the wrong Foundation
[34:17] you can't build correctly the house
[34:20] won't stand
[34:24] you know there are building projects
[34:27] that start that somehow some glitch
[34:29] happens in the blueprints and the
[34:31] builders start the foundation and they
[34:34] build it up and they discover
[34:36] oh my goodness we did something wrong
[34:40] there's something wrong here and the
[34:43] foundation's wrong so we have to we have
[34:46] to tear it all down
[34:48] this is what the prophet said to one
[34:50] brother one brother who said I didn't
[34:52] understand about the godhead and baptism
[34:56] and he said I thought I had what I
[34:58] needed I didn't understand the truth of
[34:59] it in the Bible that there's one God and
[35:02] you have to be baptized in the in the
[35:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ a father
[35:07] is not a name boy I'm giving the word
[35:09] today and I
[35:11] if you can't say Amen just chew on it
[35:12] I'm just asking you to take it with you
[35:14] father's not a name son is not a name
[35:16] you said Jesus said baptize the father
[35:18] son who goes but he said in the name of
[35:20] and the name is not a father the name is
[35:22] the Lord Jesus Christ and so this fellow
[35:24] he had this struggling he's wrestling
[35:26] with us and he has a dream about a house
[35:28] because he's a contractor he has this
[35:30] house and the wrong Foundation was there
[35:32] and so he said the prophet Prophet said
[35:34] to him brother Brian said what's the
[35:36] dream about that he said this thing I
[35:38] have to tear the whole house down and I
[35:40] had completely rebuilt the foundations
[35:42] God's showing you your doctrine's wrong
[35:45] you can't just build off of that false
[35:47] Doctrine you've got to start at a
[35:49] foundation and rebuild the whole thing
[35:50] again
[35:53] yes you've got to start over say God I'm
[35:56] here at your altar I'm repenting I have
[35:58] the wrong thing can you say man there's
[36:01] no shame in that there is embarrassment
[36:03] there it can be embarrassing but I'd
[36:04] rather tell the whole world and say
[36:06] listen this is where I'm at than to go
[36:08] on pretending putting something on
[36:17] is so embarrassing because these
[36:19] contractors say you know what we spent
[36:21] millions of dollars that's another thing
[36:24] rebuilding foundations it's painful and
[36:27] it's expensive
[36:28] and it's embarrassing because the whole
[36:30] city sees it's like what are they doing
[36:32] now well they're tearing the whole thing
[36:33] down
[36:34] well what kind of idiot
[36:38] what a person
[36:40] who did that it's embarrassing
[36:43] we have to tear all the foundations and
[36:46] we have to rebuild them again
[36:50] you think God is embarrassed at that
[36:53] no God's all about foundations
[36:56] preparations
[36:59] so I encourage you through repentance
[37:01] true repentance if you come to that
[37:03] Discovery I have family members my
[37:06] sister would tell you 25 26 years old
[37:10] great wonderful Godly girl she
[37:12] discovered she needed something at that
[37:14] age she didn't have what she needed
[37:15] she'll tell you
[37:17] hundreds of testimonies saying I grew up
[37:19] in this message I grew up I don't have
[37:21] what I have I respect it I honor it but
[37:24] it's getting old I don't have any power
[37:26] to live against this devil I'm lacking
[37:29] something praise the Lord
[37:31] praise the Lord and you recognize you're
[37:33] lacking something just be willing to say
[37:36] I'm willing to start from scratch with
[37:37] my Lord and say God I want you to tear
[37:40] up tear it up and rebuild everything so
[37:44] that the house that I build on is not on
[37:47] sinking sand
[37:51] oh I feel his spirit in here this
[37:52] morning God is speaking I believe
[37:57] it's a hard saying and that's what the
[37:59] disciples felt like this is hard it's
[38:01] hard to hear sometimes but see listen
[38:03] friends I want to be I want to be
[38:05] obedient to the Lord to share my heart
[38:07] for you can you say man I don't want to
[38:09] be a deceiver I want us all to have a
[38:12] true experience with the holy ghost from
[38:14] the pastor to the deacons everyone must
[38:17] know where they stand in this hour I've
[38:19] got a spirit in my heart oh I love it
[38:22] when a 14 year old gets filled with the
[38:24] spirit of God and they know where they
[38:25] stand they might still be a little
[38:27] immature but they know they got
[38:28] something from God
[38:29] somebody say praise the lord we need
[38:32] young people filled with the spirit we
[38:34] need parents filled with the spirit we
[38:37] need older people filled with the spirit
[38:39] we need our foundation to be sure can
[38:41] you say Amen
[38:43] we need to know where we stand today
[38:46] based upon the word of God
[38:48] and know that if we have to rebuild
[38:51] that there's really to God no shame in
[38:53] rebuilding
[38:56] it's actually a blessing when God shows
[38:58] it to us can you say Amen
[39:00] praise be to God oh how many wanna say
[39:04] Lord rebuild me if I need to be rebuilt
[39:10] Hallelujah Satan's last attack I can
[39:13] take you through the scriptures to the
[39:14] core of our only stability left he's
[39:16] striking at the core
[39:18] the word came by the prophet of the age
[39:20] and he strikes at the core of that word
[39:23] which becomes the only stability that we
[39:25] have left
[39:26] demonic forces talking to you talking
[39:29] you out of it
[39:31] if you can be talked out of something
[39:33] then you must have been originally
[39:34] talked into it
[39:40] so the foundation's wrong
[39:43] good
[39:44] we don't need to be unstable that we can
[39:46] be talked out of something
[39:49] but we want to have a stability that we
[39:51] can't this isn't an intellectual
[39:53] exercise
[39:55] this is an experience with him Christ
[39:59] and so did not demonic forces trying to
[40:03] get this but the discovery comes I need
[40:06] something more than somebody forcing I
[40:09] need something more than somebody
[40:11] forcing me how to dress
[40:14] I need something more than somebody
[40:16] telling me what to do
[40:22] praise God for these truthful
[40:24] discoveries I say praise God that it's
[40:26] manifesting time how many believe it's
[40:28] manifesting time over time every seed
[40:31] will come out Jesus said every seed will
[40:33] manifest a matter of fact somebody so
[40:35] tears with the weed and the farmer said
[40:38] what is this and Jesus said an enemy
[40:41] hath done this while the wheat was being
[40:42] sold the tares was being sold by an
[40:44] enemy he said should we get the tears
[40:46] either he said no no no no no no don't
[40:48] because if you root out the tears you
[40:50] root out the weed with it let them both
[40:52] grow together
[40:57] let them grow in the same congregation
[41:01] and over time
[41:03] it'll manifest what they are
[41:07] and they'll see who they are
[41:10] and everybody will see who they are
[41:12] and that's a that's a bad thing no
[41:14] manifesting time is a good thing
[41:17] it's a good thing because I believe as
[41:19] he said in three kinds of Believers he
[41:20] says if you've seen yourself as a
[41:22] make-believer this morning you've seen
[41:24] yourself as an unbeliever then pray and
[41:26] get to an altar and say God make me a
[41:28] believer make me a Believer there's
[41:31] Grace there's Mercy can you say amen I
[41:33] know about election but listen I know I
[41:35] had he write that said she said whatever
[41:37] whatever you ask right now whatever you
[41:40] ask and knowing that a new birth takes
[41:42] God dealing with somebody a mother asked
[41:45] her one request she was a poor woman and
[41:47] she could have had lots of money in that
[41:49] moment that at that moment
[41:51] brother Brown gave a testimony of the
[41:53] supernatural Miracles that was going on
[41:54] and she said to him in her house she had
[41:57] nothing to eat hardly at all she was a
[41:58] poor one Hattie Wright said brother
[42:00] random that ain't nothing but the truth
[42:02] and the Holy Spirit swooped into that
[42:04] place and said tell her she can ask
[42:06] whatever she wants right now whatever
[42:07] she will guess what she asked for
[42:10] in the bedroom over there was two young
[42:13] Sons laughing at what was going on
[42:14] they're laughing they're mocking you
[42:17] know what she asked for not money
[42:20] she asked for the Salvation of her two
[42:22] sons
[42:24] Hallelujah
[42:27] and God saved those two boys they begin
[42:30] to weak and they got salvation
[42:32] praise the Lord
[42:34] so you know it's in what we ask for and
[42:36] we see then that God moves upon us and
[42:39] God shows us his way and God makes these
[42:42] if we if things are manifested then
[42:45] that's a good thing it seems so
[42:47] heartbreaking when things manifest but
[42:48] it makes you if it makes you in the end
[42:51] a real believer and obeying the word for
[42:53] your age it was worth it when your
[42:55] foundations are wrong the building will
[42:57] never be right can you say Amen so we go
[42:59] back we tear out we start over it's an
[43:01] expensive thing it's a laborous task but
[43:04] it's worth it I want to tell you this
[43:06] morning that it's worth it it'll be
[43:08] worth it in the end
[43:13] and
[43:15] so I sat across the table from a
[43:17] minister if I said his name you know him
[43:19] great influence there's several of them
[43:21] great influence in our ranks
[43:24] and they just denied everything this
[43:26] denied it in front of me a friend of
[43:29] mine
[43:30] and he began to explain all the
[43:32] fanaticism and all the trouble and
[43:35] just a bunch of stuff for two hours he's
[43:37] just
[43:38] and I just said
[43:40] I said brother I said I see all that
[43:44] I see the trouble I see the fanaticism
[43:46] that follows this last day's message
[43:48] I see the things that are the work of
[43:51] the enemy working right close to the
[43:53] work of God I see people that are weird
[44:00] if I was basing this upon following
[44:03] people and their instability
[44:05] I would have been gone a long time ago
[44:09] something happened to me as a 16 year
[44:11] old boy
[44:13] and I say the same thing as Peter to
[44:15] whom shall we go thou Hast the words of
[44:18] eternal life something happened to me
[44:20] and it's not based upon the fanaticism
[44:22] and the unstableness of people sometimes
[44:25] either on congregation they're in and
[44:26] out they don't know what they believe
[44:27] from one day the next that's fine I'm
[44:29] going to keep preaching it I'm going to
[44:30] keep praying for you I pray for many of
[44:32] you more than what you realize for the
[44:34] stability in your life but I can't force
[44:37] it on you I just got to preach it
[44:39] I pray for you but my stability does not
[44:42] based upon people's ups and downs or my
[44:44] ups and downs can you say man I'm
[44:46] anchored into the anchor of Christ
[44:51] [Applause]
[44:53] The Anchor Holds
[44:56] it's held up till now and it's going to
[44:58] hold the other storms that are coming
[45:00] I'm in a storm right now but the anchor
[45:02] is holding friends the anchor is holding
[45:04] it's everything I can do to preach this
[45:06] morning but The Anchor Holds I'm not
[45:09] going anywhere because I'm rooted to the
[45:11] truth of what this last day's message of
[45:13] Christ has given me I've met the person
[45:16] this is not about a movement this is not
[45:18] even about William Branham or any other
[45:21] of those the ministers that were used of
[45:23] God it's not about that it's the Christ
[45:25] that I found in a still small voice
[45:31] I didn't find him in a denominational
[45:33] Creed I'm sorry people are fine and
[45:36] there's lovely people I have great
[45:37] friends there but in a denominational
[45:38] Creed you know what it does it takes
[45:40] away from the word and when you take
[45:42] away from the word you take away from
[45:44] the spirit of Christ
[45:46] I didn't find him in a denominational
[45:49] Creed I found him in the word for this
[45:52] hour
[45:54] it's not about a man and if it's about
[45:56] any man it's about the man Christ Jesus
[46:00] there is no other mediator between man
[46:02] and God except the man Christ Jesus
[46:05] anybody leaving as a visitor to say
[46:07] think we're promoting any man we we
[46:09] believe there's a seven days messenger
[46:11] We Believe Malachi 4 5 was fulfilled but
[46:14] every fulfillment of that is to bring
[46:16] the bride in the last days back to the
[46:18] Bible and back to the Christ the Living
[46:21] God
[46:23] [Applause]
[46:24] the main attraction here is Christ
[46:27] and the message of the last days has
[46:30] revealed
[46:31] the Christ is the mystery of God
[46:33] revealed the mystery in Revelations 10
[46:36] is what the bride will come to not the
[46:39] Miracles of Christ
[46:40] the mystery of Christ
[46:44] would the god that every young person
[46:47] every adult you might be 50 years old
[46:49] and saying
[46:51] I don't have what I need
[46:53] well praise the Lord my brother let's
[46:55] pray together let's get what we need
[47:00] I said to that brother I said when I
[47:02] look at all the trouble when I look at
[47:04] all of it I'm going to find a place to
[47:05] close here I promise
[47:07] when I look across the table Adam I said
[47:09] when I see all the trouble when I see
[47:11] the fanaticism when I see the strange
[47:13] doctrines that that's come out of this
[47:15] movement when I look at all that an
[47:18] emphasis on the outside rather than the
[47:21] inside emphasis on a man instead of
[47:23] Christ emphasis on interpreting doctrine
[47:27] that they shouldn't be interpreting
[47:30] I could go on and on but when I seen all
[47:33] I said to this man when I see all of it
[47:35] the true message that God sent is the
[47:38] only thing that I can trust and rest on
[47:41] as being solid in my life
[47:47] the message of Christ for the last days
[47:49] is what God sent
[47:52] that is the only stability in its
[47:54] revealing of Christ
[47:56] it is the only stability to turn to
[48:01] so I said to him
[48:03] you're throwing the baby out with the
[48:04] bathwater
[48:07] you're looking at all this financing
[48:09] you're throwing the baby out with the
[48:10] bathwater I said I'm not throwing the
[48:12] baby out with the bathwater
[48:14] all the dirt all the Dirty Water cast it
[48:16] out
[48:17] but don't throw the baby out
[48:19] it's the only thing left that's solid
[48:22] it's the only thing left that's stable
[48:26] praise the Lord
[48:28] Elijah under that third mystery what God
[48:32] was not in and he wasn't in the
[48:34] earthquake he wasn't in the fire he
[48:36] wasn't in the wind at that third pole we
[48:38] come to what God is in and what he's
[48:41] speaking in it's in the secret voice the
[48:43] still Small Voice Elijah was shaken
[48:45] until he found where God was and he got
[48:48] quiet and listened can you say amen and
[48:51] he reassured him you will not always
[48:54] find me excuse me you will always find
[48:57] me Elijah in this still Small Voice and
[49:00] at the end time you will always find the
[49:02] reality of him in the voice that he has
[49:05] sent
[49:06] you know another thing you told Elijah
[49:07] I'm I'm reading my notes here and I'm
[49:10] actually looking for a place to close
[49:12] I promise you there's a lot there's a
[49:15] lot here
[49:18] you know another thing he told Elijah
[49:20] that it's brought in confidence not only
[49:22] he says I'll always be in that still
[49:23] Small Voice if you'll get quiet if
[49:26] you'll settle down
[49:28] You'll Always Find me in that still
[49:30] small voice
[49:33] are you listening
[49:34] isn't it a joy to know there's a place
[49:37] that you'll always find God
[49:39] you always find me get quiet Listen to
[49:42] listen to that word and let him speak to
[49:45] you
[49:46] and the answers will be there here's
[49:47] another thing he said because he thought
[49:49] he was all alone I must be the only one
[49:51] believing this
[49:53] young people say that I must be the only
[49:54] one I've had young girls say I'm gonna
[49:57] be a
[49:59] I'm going to be a Old Maid the rest of
[50:01] my life
[50:03] there's no man out there for me
[50:07] I know what it is to be despised and
[50:10] rejected of all men
[50:17] how old are you I'm 18.
[50:25] feeling alone the devil abuses it
[50:28] so Believers today Elijah felt he was
[50:31] the only one and Jezebel was breathing
[50:34] down his neck
[50:36] felt like he was the only one here's
[50:37] another encouragement that he felt
[50:39] stable
[50:40] he said I got 7 000 down there in the
[50:42] land that's believing the same thing as
[50:45] you
[50:46] there's some real Believers on this
[50:47] young person there's some real believers
[50:49] filled with the Holy Ghost you might
[50:52] walk through a school
[50:53] that they might persecute you
[50:56] you might work walk through a college
[50:57] you might go to a job that nobody
[50:59] believes like you
[51:01] don't you ever believe the lie from the
[51:03] devil that you stand alone in this
[51:06] I said Elijah I got 7 000 around this
[51:09] world let's believe in this word
[51:11] praise the Lord do you love them this
[51:13] morning
[51:14] God is good amen
[51:16] God has put his voice in his word
[51:19] there's a voice within his voice and
[51:21] that is our stability that's where we
[51:23] find our peace and when you know you are
[51:26] hearing his true voice and it leads you
[51:28] day by day by this message and you know
[51:30] there's there's there's more of you
[51:33] around the world that's believing you
[51:35] feel a peace settled over you in your
[51:38] heart can you say Amen you feel a peace
[51:41] settle over you in your heart you feel a
[51:44] stability come Lord I may not be all
[51:47] that I uh want to be I may not be all
[51:49] that I need to be but thank God I'm not
[51:52] what I used to be and I'm in the right
[51:54] Channel that I can hear from God
[51:57] we must know where that channel is and
[52:00] find it we must know who our pastor is
[52:05] all the five Federal Ministry ministers
[52:08] to us but then there's a there's a
[52:09] particular channel that the pastor feeds
[52:12] your family and you can say I'm growing
[52:14] under this gift this pastor his
[52:16] shepherding his leadership today you
[52:19] need to know who your pastor is and have
[52:21] trust and confidence not in me but in
[52:25] the office can you say Amen this is the
[52:27] channel God's feeding my family
[52:30] we need to know where we stand we need
[52:31] to know where we know we're standing in
[52:33] the word of God we need to read the word
[52:35] of God
[52:36] [Music]
[52:38] I'm being honest with you if God has
[52:40] done this active our lamb has stepped
[52:43] into this this stepped into the vision
[52:45] John had and our lamb that went to
[52:48] Calvary 2000 years later now on this day
[52:50] he takes the book of redemption and he
[52:53] he peels the seals off of it the
[52:55] Mysteries around the book he does that
[52:57] in our hour and he breathes forth the
[53:00] seals you say well how did he do that
[53:01] how did our lamb do that that's all
[53:03] invisible but then he says in the days
[53:06] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[53:07] he shall begin to sound he'll burst
[53:09] forth all of these things through who he
[53:12] has on Earth
[53:14] so he begins to give this to his people
[53:16] give it to his people give to this P
[53:19] just give it and then within that
[53:21] there's this this voice of the Lord
[53:23] Jesus Christ
[53:24] I will speak to my people at the end
[53:27] time
[53:29] I will have a channel that I'll burst
[53:31] forth and I'll speak all this for but
[53:33] they have to be listening they got to
[53:35] shut out the other voices in their lives
[53:39] are you willing to shut out the other
[53:40] voices
[53:43] I wonder if we have some in our assembly
[53:46] that haven't even cracked ever even
[53:49] looked at a seal book haven't even
[53:51] looked at a church age book haven't even
[53:53] read much of their Bible haven't you
[53:55] know listened to the seals that troubles
[53:58] me
[54:00] it really does and I'm here not to make
[54:02] you feel bad I'm here to say God's done
[54:04] something God's spoke something
[54:08] God had a channel that he worked through
[54:11] see well what about all the other well
[54:13] my goodness God blessed throughout 2000
[54:16] years of church here in history with
[54:18] Godly ministers Godly men the reformers
[54:24] God used and he's still using Mighty Men
[54:28] praise the Lord
[54:29] praise the Lord but every people have
[54:32] trouble when you hone it down
[54:34] to seven Messengers in Jesus right hand
[54:36] through the church ages All The Godly
[54:39] ministers in Paul's age there's a lot of
[54:40] Godly ministers
[54:42] but then there's seven angels in his
[54:43] right hand there's seven Messengers God
[54:45] singles out says this is the one that
[54:47] this is the one I'll really greatly use
[54:49] to bring my word to the people Paul
[54:51] irenius Columbo
[54:54] help me out brother rap
[54:58] Martin Luther
[55:01] Wesley
[55:05] I have seven stars on my right hand you
[55:08] come under those Messengers that are
[55:09] speaking to me I'll bring my church
[55:10] through and then he says the last one
[55:13] the Thunders break the seals break and
[55:16] I'll pour it all how's he going to do it
[55:17] he gives us the exact time frame in the
[55:19] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[55:21] I'll burst forth all those voices and
[55:23] I'll speak those things
[55:25] when that bursts forth and you haven't
[55:27] even read it you haven't even listened
[55:28] to it
[55:32] I only need my I only need my Bible yeah
[55:35] but the in your Bible it says he's in
[55:38] Malachi 4 5 and 6. in your Bible says
[55:42] the seventh Messenger will be the one
[55:44] that finishes the mystery your Bible
[55:46] says that and you're not going to listen
[55:48] to the messenger
[55:54] now I'll burst the fourth and the last
[55:56] thing I want to say if you'll sit still
[55:59] and repent and just say Lord I I'm I'm
[56:03] available to you I'll sit still I want
[56:06] to be listening to a voice Beyond just
[56:08] the seventh angel
[56:10] because see some people say that's the
[56:12] voice of Jesus Christ no no no no no no
[56:14] the voice of Jesus Christ speaks through
[56:16] his ministers
[56:19] as long as I hear the seven things oh
[56:21] that's good no no no no there's a voice
[56:23] within the voice
[56:25] so I'm hearing all this stuff blasted
[56:27] forth and it might be loud I played it
[56:30] in my home
[56:31] that might be loud but takes another
[56:33] thing to hear the still Small Voice
[56:36] that's speaking within it
[56:40] and all of a sudden somebody realized
[56:42] wow I shouldn't have listened to all the
[56:44] people that are being so critical
[56:46] because I realize there's something in
[56:48] here there's something in here
[56:50] that I didn't realize was in here
[56:54] you know and I preach it I preach things
[56:56] and I become like I'm from another
[56:57] planet
[56:58] you some of you are thinking that this
[57:00] morning it's like where did this guy
[57:02] come from
[57:04] where in the world
[57:07] it's because you're not feeding on the
[57:09] same thing
[57:11] the same voice Jesus Christ he's not
[57:14] going to say anything different to you
[57:15] that does to me
[57:17] it's going to be consistent it's going
[57:18] to be stable it's going to be he's so if
[57:20] you're listening the same voice I am
[57:22] it's a lot easier to say Amen that
[57:24] registers amen that's the truth amen
[57:28] I'm not forcing you to say man I like
[57:30] amens but I'm not forcing you to say it
[57:32] I want you to have the amenor on the
[57:34] inside
[57:36] the Holy Ghost is the amenor and it only
[57:38] agrees with the word of God and only
[57:40] feeds on the word of God so if I preach
[57:42] the true word of God if you've got the
[57:43] amen or something down here is saying
[57:45] amen even if it don't make it to your
[57:47] lips sometimes
[57:49] well I'm kind of reserved and quiet okay
[57:52] but if you got that amen or his
[57:54] registrant saying you know there was a
[57:56] guy one time fighting with somebody
[57:57] because it was a Pentecostal saying that
[58:00] the tongues is initial evidence the
[58:01] tongues is initial evidence all he goes
[58:03] he said that's not scriptural he's
[58:05] trying to point him back to it say no it
[58:07] was other tongues not unknown tongues of
[58:09] the day of Pentecost does God speak with
[58:10] unknown tongues yes he does that's not
[58:12] what happened in the day Pentecost it
[58:13] was other tongues and everybody heard
[58:15] them in their own language there was
[58:17] nothing mysterious about it that's what
[58:19] God had dead on the Bay of Pentecost
[58:21] then the Pentecostals took that and said
[58:22] that's the initial evidence of the Holy
[58:24] Ghost where's no scripture for that
[58:26] sometimes in the book of Acts they
[58:28] didn't speak with tongues
[58:30] so did they not get it
[58:33] so he's arguing he's arguing so later
[58:35] this guy comes to further truth not at
[58:37] that moment though he's going to argue
[58:38] he's going to fight with him you're
[58:40] wrong you're wrong and he said later he
[58:41] testified he says wow that guy why was
[58:44] arguing with him because some people
[58:45] they they win the argument but they
