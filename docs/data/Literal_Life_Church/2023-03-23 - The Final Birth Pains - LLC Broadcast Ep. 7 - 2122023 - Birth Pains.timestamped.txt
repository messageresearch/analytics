[0:50] he loves to hear
[0:54] he Praises from these people
[0:59] he loves to hear things from the
[1:04] Mountain Times
[1:08] but I believe
[1:12] it draws a tear to his face when he
[1:20] is
[1:23] [Music]
[1:44] Hallelujah
[1:47] [Music]
[1:52] [Laughter]
[1:53] [Music]
[2:13] [Music]
[2:16] but when the rain
[2:21] this story
[2:22] [Music]
[2:25] he's touched by the sound
[2:30] [Music]
[2:53] Hallelujah
[3:01] [Music]
[3:13] [Music]
[3:34] love my world soon
[3:44] [Music]
[4:10] Hallelujah
[4:13] [Music]
[4:19] [Music]
[4:40] Christmas
[4:42] time
[4:45] [Music]
[4:50] Jesus I'll never give up
[4:54] [Music]
[5:15] because
[5:22] [Music]
[5:54] my way
[5:57] [Music]
[6:02] amenities
[6:05] [Music]
[6:41] knowing this first that there shall come
[6:44] in the last days scoffers walking after
[6:47] their own lust and saying where is the
[6:49] promise of his coming
[6:51] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[6:53] things continue as they were from the
[6:55] beginning of the creation
[6:57] so this group knows that things are to
[7:01] take place but they're mocking it and
[7:02] scoffing it uh they're and their their
[7:05] manner of life is to live as if it's not
[7:07] going to happen
[7:08] but if God said it's going to happen
[7:10] it's going to happen
[7:12] so this is another group who's living
[7:14] there they're scoffing but their their
[7:16] manner of life is to live uh not only
[7:19] scoffing it and not believing that it's
[7:21] true but there is something else in the
[7:24] world that says if it is true we're
[7:26] going to do everything without our power
[7:28] to stop it
[7:29] and that's another uh weakness and
[7:32] arrogance of man
[7:34] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[7:36] that by the word of God the heavens were
[7:38] of old and the Earth standing out of the
[7:40] water and in the water whereby the world
[7:42] that then was being overflowed with
[7:44] water perished it happened I mean we can
[7:46] say Amen
[7:47] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[7:49] now by the same word are kept in store
[7:52] reserved unto the fire against the day
[7:55] of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men
[7:57] but believe beloved be not ignorant of
[8:00] this one thing that one day of the Lord
[8:02] is this a thousand years and a thousand
[8:04] years as one day the Lord is not slack
[8:06] concerning his promise as some men count
[8:09] slackness but is long-suffering to us
[8:11] word not willing that any should perish
[8:14] but that all should come to repentance
[8:16] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[8:19] thief in the night in the which the
[8:20] heavens will shall pass away with great
[8:23] noise and elements shall melt with
[8:25] fervent heat the Earth also and the
[8:27] works that therein are shall be burned
[8:29] up seeing then that all these things
[8:31] shall be dissolved what manner of
[8:34] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[8:37] conversation all holy manner of life in
[8:41] all holy conversation and godliness
[8:43] looking for and Hasting unto the coming
[8:46] of the day of our God God wherein the
[8:49] heaven shall be on fire shall be
[8:50] dissolved and the element shall melt
[8:52] with fervent heat nevertheless we
[8:55] according to his promise now here's the
[8:57] other group we're living according to
[8:59] his promise we're living on his promises
[9:02] we're looking for something else can you
[9:05] say amen and you can't endure what's
[9:08] coming on the earth unless you know of
[9:09] the promise that there's something else
[9:11] coming
[9:12] nevertheless we according to his
[9:14] promised look for the new heavens and
[9:16] new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[9:18] wherefore beloved seeing that ye look
[9:20] for such things be diligent that ye may
[9:23] be found of him in peace without spot
[9:26] and blameless if you won't mind back to
[9:28] John one of the gospels John chapter 16
[9:31] and they can pull up their pull it up
[9:34] there quickly if they want John 16 and
[9:36] verse 20 verily rarely I say unto you
[9:39] that ye shall weep and lament but the
[9:42] world shall rejoice and ye shall be
[9:43] sorrowful but your sorrow your sorrow
[9:45] and here's the other group now there's
[9:48] one group that that may sorrow and yet
[9:51] they may rejoice in this world we may go
[9:54] through sour but the world shall rejoice
[9:55] and ye shall be sorrowful but your
[9:58] sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman
[10:01] when she is in travail hath sorrow
[10:03] because her hour is come but as soon as
[10:07] she is delivered of a child she REM she
[10:10] remembers no more than anguish for joy
[10:14] that a man is Born Into the world and
[10:17] whenever you have something brand new
[10:19] coming in God you always have a death
[10:22] and you always have pain that comes
[10:25] before it can you say Amen
[10:27] and we'll get into that a little bit
[10:28] because that's the process in God's
[10:30] kingdom that's the way it works in God's
[10:32] kingdom that's not the way that it works
[10:34] in the world we tend to polish ourselves
[10:36] up we tend to try to make ourselves
[10:38] better the world gets better and better
[10:39] we intellectually try to change
[10:41] something or do something or patch up
[10:43] what's already done even if it's dirty
[10:45] and it's filthy we patch it up and do
[10:47] the best we can but when God does
[10:49] something he does it brand new and then
[10:51] it comes the way that its birth is
[10:54] through pain
[10:56] through suffering
[10:59] through hard times
[11:01] can you say Amen I'll tell you if you
[11:04] have a real true New Birth this morning
[11:06] it's because probably a lot of your life
[11:08] and especially right before the New
[11:10] Birth you went through hard times you
[11:14] went through pain because why you had to
[11:16] die out to yourself to have a new birth
[11:19] and it's just the way the kingdom of God
[11:21] works you can avoid it you can get
[11:24] around it you can try to polish it up
[11:25] I'm a good person I'm okay I love God
[11:28] but that's not the new birth there has
[11:30] to be a death before there's a new birth
[11:34] many people will not allow themselves to
[11:36] go through that pain but if they only
[11:37] knew the joy if they only knew what was
[11:39] coming then they would die out to
[11:41] themselves because what God has brand
[11:44] new is so much far beyond what you're
[11:47] living now
[11:48] Hallelujah and so now by looking at it
[11:51] this way we see this these nervous scary
[11:54] events as bringing us closer to the
[11:58] birth of a new life a new heavens and a
[12:00] new Earth so we see these events as not
[12:02] the scary nervous events that the world
[12:05] looks at it as but we see it as
[12:07] something of giving birth to the new
[12:09] life giving birth to the new world and
[12:12] that is a very exciting result that when
[12:15] it's all over can you say Amen the
[12:17] prophet opens the mystery that we know
[12:19] if it's in the final days when it's all
[12:21] over as a woman going through her final
[12:23] days of birth pains when it's all over
[12:26] then a baby is born the pain increases
[12:30] before the baby is born can you say man
[12:33] the contractions increase that you know
[12:36] and how feeble I am to talk about this
[12:37] this morning when I haven't had a baby
[12:39] myself we have Professionals in this
[12:41] room
[12:42] that have been through this and none of
[12:44] you guys better talk about you knowing
[12:46] about you don't know nothing and how
[12:48] many sisters would raise their hand how
[12:50] many has ever had their husbands say to
[12:52] somebody we're gonna have a baby or we
[12:54] had a baby and the wife looks over what
[12:56] you mean we
[12:59] we had a baby you didn't do nothing
[13:01] hardly
[13:03] but you mean we partner
[13:05] yeah so none of you but there's some
[13:07] professionals in the room and I'll say
[13:10] this that the mystery of God is actually
[13:12] written in the life of a woman
[13:15] The Mystery of the Bride the mystery of
[13:17] what the bride goes through the mystery
[13:19] of everything and bringing forth Christ
[13:22] lies and she lives out this mystery when
[13:25] she dresses modest and lives like God
[13:27] said to the center she's she's a light
[13:30] she's a word more than what I can preach
[13:32] the woman is the mystery to this world
[13:34] of what God's doing in his bride that's
[13:37] a pretty important position God bless
[13:39] you sisters we give you praise and honor
[13:41] this morning for holding up that
[13:43] standard
[13:45] she been through it just they know so
[13:48] I'm not going to talk about it but we
[13:49] know that as she gets closer and closer
[13:51] the pain gets more intense and the
[13:54] suffering gets more intense can you say
[13:56] Amen pains increase but see when you
[13:59] know the joy that's just a few minutes
[14:02] away you can endure and you can have
[14:05] Hallelujah in the valley
[14:09] somebody say praise the Lord
[14:10] you can have Hallelujah in the valley so
[14:13] the pains increase there's another
[14:15] reference to it in Luke chapter 21
[14:17] thought I would read that if you guys
[14:19] want to pull out Luke chapter 21 it says
[14:22] verse 25 this is where he refers to it
[14:24] Luke 21 25 it says and there shall be
[14:28] signs in the sun and the moon and the
[14:30] stars and upon the Earth distress of
[14:32] nations with perplexity the Sea and the
[14:35] waves roaring men's Hearts failing them
[14:37] for fear and for looking after those
[14:40] things which are coming on the earth for
[14:42] the powers of Heaven shall be shaken
[14:44] and then shall they see the son of man
[14:46] coming in the cloud with power and great
[14:48] glory and when these things begin to
[14:50] come to pass then look up and lift up
[14:53] your heads for your Redemption draws now
[14:56] Jesus is saying the same thing when
[14:58] there's perplexity of Nations when
[15:00] there's earthquakes in diverse places
[15:01] when men's Hearts failing for fear when
[15:04] all this stuff begins to intensify and
[15:06] get more and more as you'll see in the
[15:08] scripture more and more then when these
[15:10] things begin to come to pass then we can
[15:13] look up and lift at our lift up our head
[15:15] because the joy that set before us
[15:17] that says to us our Redemption is
[15:20] drawing nigh
[15:22] it's the only way to look at events the
[15:25] right way and that's with the revelation
[15:29] you Bound by the scare and as I said
[15:31] last Sunday you're going to make an
[15:33] issue with some family in the church
[15:35] knowing these events are taken and we're
[15:37] this close you're going to distance
[15:38] yourself from the body of Christ now
[15:41] you're going to backslide I say to you
[15:43] as a gospel Minister you need to be
[15:45] under the word you need to be clinging
[15:47] to the body of Christ you don't need to
[15:49] be running away
[15:50] [Applause]
[15:53] God have mercy on people that are doing
[15:55] that even today
[15:57] God have mercy on their souls so if you
[15:59] don't see it the way Jesus is saying
[16:01] goes on to say look up lift up your head
[16:02] for your Redemption is drawing nigh and
[16:05] and so they just we'll continue with
[16:07] that in a minute but if you don't see it
[16:08] this way you will be looking at things
[16:12] like the world looks at it
[16:14] where you where you stand and you where
[16:17] you're standing there and they're going
[16:18] to hand you the next
[16:20] uh fear
[16:22] that you're going to worry about the
[16:24] next year a woman when she's in travail
[16:26] has sorrow because her Hours come but as
[16:30] soon as she has delivered the of the
[16:31] child she remembersth no more the
[16:33] anguish for Joy than a man that is Born
[16:36] Into the world the spiritual birth is
[16:38] the same way as the natural birth a lot
[16:40] of people run from the pain part of it
[16:42] can you say Amen but if you would just
[16:44] sit still and know the pain that's in
[16:46] you is to bring forth new life it's not
[16:49] the new birth is not a new intellectual
[16:52] exercise it's not shaken the preacher's
[16:54] hand it's not speaking in tongues it's
[16:57] not a feeling or emotion the new birth
[16:59] goes much deeper than that can you say
[17:01] amen and and it works by a natural birth
[17:04] it's the pain that a woman goes through
[17:06] you're not going to get to that new
[17:08] birth without some pain without your
[17:10] system being jolted your life crumbling
[17:13] apart sometimes
[17:14] divorces and all kinds of things can
[17:17] happen and a lot of times it's driving
[17:19] the person in this pain of life to seek
[17:22] God can you say a man just say finally
[17:25] God I need you more than anything else I
[17:28] don't care about anything except a new
[17:31] birth
[17:32] pain drives you to that suffering drives
[17:35] you to that because that's the way God
[17:37] set it up can you say Amen praise the
[17:40] Lord and and in God's kingdom you can't
[17:42] get around it and and so we see that new
[17:45] life it's not an intellectual but your
[17:46] whole life changes I had some good
[17:48] fellowship with Michael and uh Jason
[17:50] coming home Friday night from the youth
[17:52] meeting and to see God forming these
[17:54] young men's lives and to be able to hear
[17:56] their testimonies in their story where
[17:58] they came from where they're at now and
[18:00] I don't mean to embarrass them this
[18:01] morning but God God is doing something
[18:04] God these new ones that have come God's
[18:06] doing something in their life but I can
[18:08] tell you it's not without pain it's not
[18:10] without suffering it's not without God
[18:12] challenging the mind and challenging
[18:14] everything they ever knew before it's
[18:16] painful friends but I'll tell you I
[18:18] complimented my brother to see that he's
[18:20] stuck with it he's sticking with it and
[18:23] and he's staying around the word of God
[18:24] a lot of people would have bailed out a
[18:26] long time ago but this young man here
[18:28] wants to be baptized here in the next
[18:29] couple weeks he's stuck with the word of
[18:31] God in name of Jesus God's doing
[18:34] something
[18:35] but it's not without pain
[18:38] we think sometimes the birth is just
[18:40] like that but a lot of times this I'm
[18:42] through a lot of pain and suffering
[18:44] losses can you say Amen challenges where
[18:47] the word is rebuking you and all these
[18:49] other things
[18:50] but all the end result is what we're
[18:54] looking at
[18:55] Hallelujah I could join my brother and
[18:58] grab his hand and step into a Rapture
[19:01] with brother Jason step into a Rapture
[19:03] with brother brother Michael
[19:08] a bunch of other stories in the church
[19:10] technically you shouldn't be here today
[19:12] through your story you shouldn't be here
[19:14] you shouldn't be saying Amen to the word
[19:16] of God there's a lot of other places you
[19:18] could be but it's God grace and the pain
[19:20] that you've been through that puts you
[19:22] here this morning
[19:25] your story every story is different but
[19:27] I guarantee you your story if it's of
[19:29] God will bring you
[19:31] to being ready for a rapture
[19:36] amen you don't like your story
[19:39] I don't like mine either
[19:40] we didn't get a choice of our story
[19:43] we didn't get a choice of what our
[19:44] family would go through
[19:46] we didn't get that choice
[19:48] but God certainly was watching over it
[19:51] and the most inhumane the most the most
[19:54] tragic things that happen to us
[19:58] can't get what much worse than Brothers
[20:00] throwing Joseph into the pit his own
[20:03] flesh and blood
[20:05] selling him to Egypt into slavery
[20:08] slavery you can't get much by the
[20:10] feeling rejected and betrayed
[20:13] and yet God's working to fulfill the
[20:15] vision
[20:17] for his life
[20:19] Hallelujah
[20:21] I feel his presence here this morning
[20:24] I may not be long I'm not feeling that
[20:26] well I'm feeling I'm not accepting those
[20:28] rattlesnakes and symptoms
[20:31] but in the in my soul
[20:33] I just feel that I love the presence of
[20:36] God I love to be near him I
[20:38] I love to hear his voice
[20:40] like brother Boaz said if you're if
[20:43] you're hearing that still small voice
[20:44] this morning you you know that he has to
[20:47] be real close for you to hear a still
[20:49] small voice
[20:52] I think God doesn't have to shout at us
[20:55] but it's a still small voice
[20:58] so
[20:59] your whole life changes when God's
[21:01] getting over you it it inconvenes it it
[21:04] gives you inconveniences in life doesn't
[21:07] it do that with a woman uh
[21:10] that's become pregnant and her life now
[21:13] becomes inconvenienced
[21:16] once again sisters you know all about it
[21:18] but life wasn't about it you can't
[21:21] always move around as easy as you did as
[21:24] you get bigger
[21:27] and I was suggesting those uh I read up
[21:30] on all this you know and I was I said
[21:32] hun I read up that you're when you're
[21:34] pregnant like you're supposed to be
[21:36] wearing snow skis around the house and
[21:38] walking in them because your back will
[21:40] get out of shape so do you want me to go
[21:42] buy you some snow skis and you're
[21:43] walking around the house no I don't want
[21:45] no school snow skins not gonna waddle
[21:48] around I'm already waddling around
[21:54] snow skis that's what they said and
[21:57] your life becomes inconvenienced and you
[22:01] can't do all the things you did before
[22:03] and you get you go through morning
[22:04] sickness and you go through these things
[22:06] and and then there's sisters that don't
[22:09] have any of that which everybody else is
[22:10] jealous of they don't have any of it but
[22:12] in most cases you have changes and you
[22:15] can't fit into the clothes that you fit
[22:16] in before and and what's going on and
[22:19] there's something growing inside of you
[22:22] there's a new life growing inside of you
[22:25] and this is a type of the spiritual is
[22:27] that when you have new life that's
[22:29] getting ready to be birthed in you
[22:30] there's going to be pain there's going
[22:32] to be suffering you're going to be
[22:33] inconvenienced
[22:35] so if I'm scaring all you young girls
[22:36] that are single right now don't you ever
[22:39] let me scare you because there's nothing
[22:41] there's nothing in the world like
[22:43] bringing forth a child into this world
[22:44] nothing like it
[22:47] the pain the suffering
[22:51] you probably will have it but there's
[22:53] nothing like the joy
[22:56] it's pain suffering can you say Amen
[23:01] but when the baby's there
[23:03] it's all done
[23:05] and Jesus said it when the baby comes
[23:08] then all of a sudden the joy that's
[23:10] there
[23:11] he said
[23:12] that when the joys there and the joy of
[23:15] what has come
[23:16] you don't remember any of the pain
[23:20] anymore
[23:21] I'm telling you friends we're getting
[23:23] ready to step into a dimension
[23:26] I said we're getting ready to step into
[23:28] a dimension real soon
[23:31] and there's things that you won't be
[23:33] able to remember no more
[23:37] you won't remember those bills that are
[23:40] due tomorrow you won't remember the hard
[23:43] time that you came through earlier in
[23:45] your marriage you won't remember all the
[23:47] struggles in your family you won't
[23:49] remember the people that done you wrong
[23:53] you won't remember any listen if God can
[23:56] forget it all then there's a place that
[23:58] we come that we can forget it all and
[24:00] when we step into that other dimension
[24:03] the pain the sorrow the trials our story
[24:07] we will not remember any of it because
[24:11] of the joy one of the favorite things in
[24:14] nature to me is the trees in the fall
[24:17] you know that I love the fall time and I
[24:19] didn't bring a picture with me I have a
[24:21] lot of pictures I collect them I found
[24:22] another one the other day in a in an
[24:24] office that we purchased I found a
[24:26] beautiful just a beautiful picture and
[24:28] those colors in the fall are so
[24:30] extremely brilliant and bright and the
[24:33] most beautiful thing you ever seen you
[24:35] know that and I love it it just it moves
[24:37] me every time I see the Smoky Mountains
[24:39] that way and just see all the different
[24:41] colors brilliant so I took a picture of
[24:43] this picture and I sent it to a brother
[24:45] who's going through a kind of a hard
[24:47] time right now in the church and going
[24:49] through some suffering and starting to
[24:51] see some things in his life that he
[24:52] needs to address and die out to and I
[24:54] know he's going through a death and I
[24:56] sent that to him and I says isn't it
[24:58] amazing only in the kingdom of God that
[25:00] you can have something so beautiful
[25:02] while they're going through a death
[25:04] [Music]
[25:06] it is only in the kingdom of God that
[25:09] Death Becomes a beautiful thing
[25:13] beautiful is the death of his Saints we
[25:16] don't want to lose our loved ones but in
[25:18] Christ it's not an end can you say Amen
[25:21] it's a beautiful thing they go on to
[25:23] their new body can you say man only in
[25:26] the kingdom of God is death a beautiful
[25:28] thing
[25:29] and I was encouraging the brother that
[25:32] you keep dying out to yourself you keep
[25:33] doing that the beauty of God is showing
[25:36] in your life we're not here to become
[25:38] another polished church and make sure
[25:39] everything's just perfect we're here
[25:41] that if we don't have repentance and you
[25:44] say well I already repented 20 years ago
[25:45] when I gave my heart to the Lord hasn't
[25:47] somebody told you that we have to repent
[25:49] all the time
[25:51] we need an altar almost daily in our
[25:53] lives
[25:55] so don't you dare come here every Sunday
[25:57] and just nod and say I'm okay the truth
[26:00] is we're not okay can you say man we
[26:03] always need more of God we always need
[26:06] more correction and the only way to
[26:08] change that is to repent we need
[26:10] repentance if God
[26:12] speaks to your heart and corrects
[26:14] something then just just set brother
[26:17] Paul aside
[26:20] somebody take that as from the Lord and
[26:22] the next step said God I cry out to you
[26:26] please burn the things of the world out
[26:29] of my life
[26:30] Take Me Lord
[26:32] this is almost wrapped up this is almost
[26:34] over you might not have another Sunday
[26:37] to repent
[26:38] who are we to assume that
[26:42] we need
[26:43] atmosphere of repentance
[26:47] and if you realize that the pain of
[26:49] dying out to your own desires because
[26:51] see the birth pains is in you
[26:53] individually too
[26:56] through pain
[26:57] through suffering
[27:00] through
[27:02] things that take us
[27:04] things we don't understand things that
[27:06] are hurtful to us things that where we
[27:09] suffer
[27:11] if we realize that the pain of dining
[27:13] out to our own desires and truly
[27:15] repenting and saying Lord I'm done
[27:17] when we come to that it's going to bring
[27:19] forth God's life within us
[27:22] and that's when we say
[27:24] every bit of pain was worth it
[27:28] maybe it's embarrassment I'm embarrassed
[27:30] that the Lord has exposed this in my
[27:32] life
[27:33] you'll get at the end of it say it was
[27:35] worse it was worth all the embarrassment
[27:38] people talk people said things other
[27:40] times we don't want people to know
[27:42] things and we try to and that's fine
[27:44] that's fine none of us like to be
[27:45] embarrassed but one day you're going to
[27:48] say this was worth all the embarrassment
[27:51] whatever man could say whatever man can
[27:53] do if it brings the end result it's
[27:56] worth all the pain
[27:57] worth all the trouble
[28:00] with all the trials
[28:03] it will be worth it all
[28:05] when we see Jesus
