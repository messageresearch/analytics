[0:00] corinthians chapter 5 is where we want
[0:01] to read together in the scripture
[0:03] and any other visitors we're glad to
[0:05] have you today god bless you
[0:07] anyone coming in and joining with us
[0:09] fellowship around the world we spend a
[0:11] little time in the bible and
[0:13] see if the lord can speak something to
[0:14] us out of it and we're just
[0:16] grateful that we have our bibles and
[0:18] have the word of god
[0:20] and we're thankful to be christians
[0:22] today it's such a blessing inspiration
[0:24] to see a young
[0:25] heart like that singing with filled with
[0:27] the holy ghost and
[0:28] ministering to us that way i always like
[0:31] to pause and say
[0:32] in this wicked age in this age of
[0:36] young people without god it's so
[0:39] good to see a young life filled with the
[0:42] spirit and dedicated to the lord
[0:44] and i say we give glory to god for that
[0:46] we have so many here in the church as
[0:48] well
[0:48] and we're thankful for it you know god's
[0:50] doing something when the young people
[0:52] have an interest in god can you say man
[0:55] you know there's something right going
[0:57] on when it's drawing the hearts of the
[0:58] youth
[0:59] because if something's wrong that's
[1:01] usually who you lose first as the young
[1:03] people
[1:04] and that's even in our own ranks
[1:05] sometimes not this church but other ones
[1:07] where
[1:07] you know something's not quite right but
[1:10] if god is working
[1:11] it'll draw every age can you say man
[1:14] old young but when you're drawing the
[1:16] young people and there's something there
[1:18] that they're hungry for then you know
[1:20] god is in the midst and something's
[1:21] happening
[1:22] a special set of scriptures here and i
[1:24] want to continue my
[1:26] subject from last sunday our
[1:27] participation in create
[1:29] creation part two our participation in
[1:32] creation
[1:33] and second corinthians chapter five and
[1:35] verse fourteen
[1:40] the love of christ constraineth us
[1:44] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:47] for all
[1:48] then we're all dead and
[1:51] that so paul is saying if if that's true
[1:54] that we believe that one died for all of
[1:57] us
[1:57] then we have to reconcile reckon that we
[2:00] in our old nature we're dead we consider
[2:03] ourselves dead
[2:04] if we believe that truth but here he
[2:06] says in 15 and that he died for all
[2:09] that they which live should not
[2:12] henceforth
[2:13] live unto themselves so
[2:16] if you have a revelation of this that
[2:18] you're dead in christ
[2:20] and and the new man christ is living
[2:23] one of the attributes of it will be we
[2:25] no longer from henceforth we no longer
[2:28] are living selfishly we're no longer
[2:31] living
[2:31] for ourselves how many believe we're in
[2:34] a world that it's
[2:35] it's about themselves everything is
[2:36] about people's rights my rights
[2:39] themselves
[2:39] well this revelation says that we no
[2:42] longer henceforth live
[2:43] unto us themselves but unto him which
[2:46] died for them and rose again
[2:48] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[2:51] after the flesh
[2:52] so henceforth we don't live selfishly
[2:55] but then henceforth
[2:56] we are now looking at people different
[3:00] we are now looking at every individual
[3:02] different
[3:03] when you have this revelation we don't
[3:05] look at the flesh because the world
[3:07] looks at the flesh
[3:08] the world judges by what the person is
[3:10] wearing the world is judging by the
[3:11] person's baggage
[3:13] the world is person there's a helpless
[3:14] case there we can no longer look at what
[3:17] we see on the inside
[3:18] but we're looking to is there a seed in
[3:21] that soul
[3:22] is there a part of god in that that can
[3:24] be tapped
[3:26] we from now on we can no longer look at
[3:29] people after the flesh
[3:33] there's a lot of christians who still do
[3:34] that but you're living in the flesh
[3:36] you're not living in the spirit
[3:38] henceforth no we know man after the
[3:40] flesh ye though we have known christ
[3:42] after the flesh
[3:43] he had 33 years on earth we knew hamlet
[3:45] the flesh but even him
[3:46] yet now henceforth know we him no more
[3:49] after the flesh
[3:50] we don't know christ after the flesh we
[3:52] weren't there 2000 years ago
[3:54] but here we're here today and christ is
[3:56] just as real in this building this
[3:57] morning
[3:59] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[4:02] a new creature
[4:03] old things are passed away behold all
[4:06] things are become new
[4:07] and all things are of god who hath
[4:10] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[4:13] and hath given to us the ministry of
[4:16] reconciliation
[4:18] so christ was pulling and recognizing or
[4:20] excuse me reconciling those back to god
[4:23] through his ministry but now that
[4:25] ministry has been given to paul
[4:27] and then he goes on to say it's been
[4:29] given to us we have a ministry of
[4:30] reconciliation
[4:32] to with that god was in christ
[4:33] reconciling the world unto himself
[4:35] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[4:38] and hath committed unto
[4:40] us the word of reconciliation
[4:43] it's not just paul it's us why are you
[4:46] living as a christian
[4:47] you've been committed the ministry
[4:51] of reconciling people back to god
[4:54] it's pretty powerful now
[4:57] then we are ambassadors for christ
[5:01] as though god just beseech you through
[5:04] us
[5:06] we pray you in christ's dead i'm
[5:09] standing in christ's dead
[5:11] because fleshly he's not here but by
[5:13] spirit he's here and i'm standing in his
[5:15] place
[5:15] and saying be ye reconciled back to god
[5:20] what a powerful ministry amen heavenly
[5:22] father
[5:23] we humbly ask for your help in the
[5:25] service today and we pray that
[5:27] the lives that are listening the ears
[5:28] that are listening that you would be
[5:31] real to them that you would find them
[5:34] lord where they're at
[5:35] that you will draw them closer to you
[5:37] and that's all we pray for we know your
[5:38] power is able to do it
[5:40] there's needs greater here and listening
[5:42] online greater than any man can meet
[5:44] but god can do all things and we depend
[5:47] on that
[5:48] we commit the service to you in jesus
[5:50] name amen
[5:51] you may be seen once you shake
[5:52] somebody's hand before you're seated
[5:54] since we're allowed to do that now
[6:03] we appreciate your prayers while we were
[6:04] resting this week my wife and i had a
[6:06] real nice rest
[6:08] and we appreciate the um those who took
[6:10] care of things while we were away
[6:11] god bless those that the staff and
[6:13] different ones that god has given us
[6:15] so this morning we want to develop this
[6:18] thought
[6:19] on our participation in creation we just
[6:22] want to develop it just a little further
[6:24] and when the ministry of the last days
[6:28] transitioned from the first and the
[6:31] second poll to the third poll
[6:34] and that was god bringing back the open
[6:36] word to his people
[6:37] that those transitions happened in the
[6:39] last days and just in case nobody
[6:41] understands
[6:42] that what i'm saying when i use the word
[6:44] poll p-u-l-l
[6:46] the three polls um in jesus ministry two
[6:49] thousand years ago
[6:51] he had i won't call them polls but i'll
[6:53] call them phases
[6:54] they were three polls to his ministry
[6:56] they were phases to his ministry
[6:58] and the first one was is that he was did
[7:00] so many uh uh
[7:02] so many prayers were answered in the
[7:03] healing of the body the healing of the
[7:05] sick
[7:06] so that was the first phase of this
[7:08] ministry it it was not done in a quarter
[7:10] it was all over galilee
[7:12] and jesus phase of that ministry healed
[7:15] so many the blinded eyes were open
[7:17] the lame walk the dumb talked jesus can
[7:21] still do that today
[7:22] jesus is still opening up the blinded
[7:24] eyes
[7:25] jesus is still making the lame walk how
[7:28] many believe that
[7:29] but then he had another phase as that he
[7:31] could discern the thoughts and the
[7:33] intents of the heart
[7:34] and he could he could tell you what the
[7:36] secrets of your heart were
[7:37] that was another phase of jesus ministry
[7:40] and he that's the way that he was
[7:41] and god would show him by vision and he
[7:44] could see into a person's life
[7:46] both the past the present and the future
[7:49] by vision
[7:50] jesus was able to do that in that phase
[7:52] of his ministry
[7:53] and then when he come to the third part
[7:55] of jesus ministry
[7:57] it was more about him opening the word
[7:59] to his disciples
[8:00] it was about opening the word and
[8:02] speaking the word and seeing who would
[8:03] follow that
[8:04] and so there was three phases of jesus
[8:06] ministry to make it simple
[8:08] jesus uh in in each different level
[8:12] he was dealing with the human being and
[8:15] a human being is made up of body spirit
[8:17] and soul
[8:18] so everything that jesus came to do was
[8:21] to affect
[8:22] the human being not just in your soul
[8:26] but in your body as well he made an
[8:28] atonement for when you get sick
[8:30] you can go to him he took stripes upon
[8:32] your back
[8:33] he cared about your body when you're
[8:35] sick
[8:37] so jesus everything that he was was
[8:39] related to affecting the human being you
[8:42] as a human being
[8:43] jesus came not not so that he could show
[8:46] off
[8:47] but that he could affect you he sends
[8:50] his word to affect you and it's not just
[8:52] your soul
[8:53] it's your body can you say man and then
[8:55] it's your spirit your emotions
[8:57] these secrets of your heart your spirit
[8:59] realm and he could get into that and
[9:01] find out
[9:01] as a matter of fact today quite often
[9:04] well
[9:05] every service somebody says pretty much
[9:07] that brother paul did not know that
[9:09] but he god through brother paul through
[9:11] a minister discerned what
[9:13] i was thinking discerned what i was
[9:15] thinking we were talking about it last
[9:17] night and you preached the merry thing
[9:19] how did i know that i didn't know it but
[9:21] god knew it
[9:22] because he's concerned about what you're
[9:24] thinking he's concerned about your
[9:26] discouraged
[9:27] spirit that you have he's discouraged
[9:29] when your emotions are low
[9:31] he he is he is encouraged that he has an
[9:33] atonement
[9:34] for when you're under depression he
[9:37] himself was depressed he himself
[9:39] was low and so then i
[9:42] just not spend a lot of time on that
[9:44] because i just wanted to qualify
[9:46] these different three polls then we come
[9:48] to the third part
[9:50] and the third part dealt with the soul
[9:52] and particularly creation
[9:54] because when he come to the third part
[9:56] he was actually going to have his new
[9:58] creation
[9:59] and make new creatures in christ jesus
[10:03] completely new human beings would be as
[10:06] paul
[10:06] said when you come into christ you are a
[10:09] new
[10:10] creature you are a new creation
[10:13] in your soul level it's brand new
[10:18] new creatures in jesus christ
[10:21] and so when we talk about creation now
[10:24] the third pole
[10:26] has creative power in it to create the
[10:29] human being and to create something new
[10:32] and uh so so the the question is
[10:35] is why does what god want to do that why
[10:37] does god want to
[10:38] create something new why does he want to
[10:40] use this power
[10:42] it's far deeper and a lot of us
[10:43] believers know that he displayed that
[10:45] power in the third poll
[10:47] when our prophet was used to create
[10:49] squirrels uh
[10:50] howdy right and all these things that we
[10:52] are familiar with god displaying it but
[10:54] i can tell you
[10:55] that god did not bring this power to the
[10:58] bride he's not bringing it to her for us
[11:00] to create squirrels
[11:02] frankly i could do with less squirrels
[11:04] in my yard
[11:06] two of them out there this morning and
[11:08] give you said what are we going to do
[11:09] i'm going to do the same thing my dad
[11:10] did
[11:11] i'm going to get me a bb gun and i'm
[11:12] going to have a target practice to get
[11:14] them away from my bird feeders
[11:17] and uh dad's gone on now so i'd say he
[11:20] just he shot himself in the finger even
[11:22] doing that with the bb gun one day
[11:23] we had to take him to emergency he said
[11:26] don't you tell the church that
[11:32] his worst fear in emergency his worst
[11:34] fear was that they said to him
[11:35] said we have to report you now as a
[11:38] shooting
[11:39] incident he said i just had a bb gun
[11:41] well we have to report it
[11:43] his testimony would be ruined for life
[11:49] so i can get by he's god i can share
[11:51] with the church now
[11:53] do you think that god sends the third
[11:55] pull and this creative power to the
[11:57] bride of christ
[11:58] just to create squirrels no he did those
[12:01] things to say
[12:02] it's here his word has come back to the
[12:06] bride
[12:09] it's not that it's not to to do those
[12:11] things so it's the
[12:12] the the message of this and what it
[12:14] means to us is
[12:15] far deeper than creating squirrels and i
[12:17] want you to catch this through this
[12:19] series and be able to see it
[12:20] and so then at the last days jesus
[12:23] ministry must manifest again
[12:25] in all these three variations or all
[12:27] these three phases
[12:29] three polls whatever you want to call it
[12:31] that means healing
[12:32] that means discerning of thoughts and
[12:34] that means the third pole the opening of
[12:35] the word
[12:36] and the creative power coming back to
[12:38] sons of god again
[12:40] like adam had it in the garden we fell
[12:43] from something in the garden
[12:45] and his word comes back in the end time
[12:47] to sons god sons of god to give them
[12:49] back that power again
[12:50] this creative power can you say amen our
[12:53] participation
[12:55] in creation
[12:58] god wasn't keeping that to himself god
[13:00] was putting it by the holy ghost in
[13:02] every
[13:03] believer can you say amen because of
[13:05] this the third paul here is with us
[13:07] and we now because this is with us and
[13:10] been working and
[13:11] the opening of the world his word is
[13:13] becoming more alive to the bride through
[13:16] these years
[13:16] something has been happening because
[13:18] we're growing in our understanding
[13:20] of what this really is and it's not to
[13:22] show off and exercise power
[13:24] to the world so they can see who we are
[13:26] this is not a public show can you say
[13:28] man
[13:29] but there's something that we have
[13:30] within us that god wants to play this
[13:33] way to give him glory
[13:34] can you say amen in everyday situations
[13:38] i don't need more squirrels but i
[13:41] certainly have
[13:42] needs and i've got to recognize that
[13:44] something within me
[13:45] allows me to say if you say to this
[13:48] mountain
[13:48] be removed and cast in the sea that's
[13:51] his word coming back to the people again
[13:55] jesus didn't say if i say it for you he
[13:57] said if you say to this mountain
[14:01] one of the most mysterious places in the
[14:02] scripture and the prophet said he
[14:04] stumbled over it for years
[14:05] but you can't get away from those words
[14:07] that jesus said if you
[14:09] speak those words
[14:13] help us lord to see it because the third
[14:16] poorest
[14:17] paul is here we understand now
[14:21] some things about it that other
[14:22] generations have not understood we
[14:24] understand how god
[14:26] brings his thoughts to material
[14:29] like no other people and generation
[14:31] before we understand
[14:33] how god brings his thoughts to the
[14:36] people
[14:36] and how he causes his thoughts to
[14:39] materialize
[14:40] and come to pass we understand how that
[14:43] takes place
[14:44] god could have done it anyway but we
[14:46] understand from the quote i read to you
[14:48] last sunday which i'm going to read a
[14:49] little bit of it again
[14:50] to remind you of it but we understand
[14:52] how god
[14:53] brings his thoughts into material like
[14:55] no other people understand
[14:57] it's not just understanding today but
[15:00] it's not just
[15:01] understanding it today but sons
[15:04] doing it and acting upon it according to
[15:07] the word of god
[15:08] we're not in a day of the third poll
[15:09] that we just say we understand this and
[15:11] how it works
[15:12] but god is saying yield to me
[15:15] surrender to me get emptied out of all
[15:18] the world get emptied out of your own
[15:20] thoughts
[15:21] so this thing can work in you
[15:26] god bless you good to have you today
[15:28] don't mean to embarrass this is your
[15:29] parents
[15:30] okay god bless you good to have you
[15:33] god doesn't bring us understanding of
[15:35] things so that we can just
[15:36] have conventions and get excited about
[15:39] the understanding of it
[15:43] this is on a daily basis that god says
[15:45] i've given you my word back
[15:47] eve lost the word adam lost the word but
[15:50] i'm i've given it back to you in the
[15:51] last days
[15:52] what will you do with it and i can tell
[15:54] you my series is
[15:55] the main reason he gives it is so you
[15:57] can affect other people
[16:00] not yourself but other people that your
[16:03] words
[16:04] are powerful not because of you but
[16:06] because of the holy ghost in here
[16:08] what you say can bring life or what you
[16:11] say
[16:11] can bring death
[16:15] so we want further understanding sons of
[16:17] god are doing it and acting upon it
[16:19] so let's bring you back to the quote
[16:21] from last sunday the prophet said saint
[16:23] john 1
[16:23] in the beginning was the word and the
[16:25] word was with god i don't know if you
[16:27] have that quote or not
[16:28] in the beginning was the word and the
[16:30] word was with god and the word was god
[16:32] and the word became flesh and dwelt with
[16:35] us
[16:36] god dwelt with us in flesh he was the
[16:38] word so what is he saying here
[16:40] it was thought it was word he spoke it
[16:42] and then the word became material begin
[16:45] to materialize
[16:46] and that's where we have the term the
[16:47] word became flesh that's what he wants
[16:50] the word to become flesh how does god do
[16:53] that and the prophet goes on to explain
[16:55] it here
[16:55] he says so god's thoughts before a word
[16:58] it's a thought
[17:00] and a thought has to be created how is
[17:03] it created all right
[17:04] so god's thoughts become creation when
[17:07] it is spoke
[17:08] by the word it's not just that it's in
[17:10] the heart it's spoken with lips
[17:14] god's thoughts become creation when it
[17:16] was spoke by a word
[17:18] that's when he presents it to you as a
[17:20] thought his thoughts
[17:22] and it is revealed to you see his
[17:24] thoughts are there
[17:25] it's revealed to you then it's still a
[17:28] thought
[17:29] until you speak it and once again in the
[17:32] same language
[17:34] as jesus 2000 years ago when he says if
[17:37] you say to this mountain
[17:38] this prophet has worded it this way he
[17:40] says it's still a thought
[17:42] until you speak it
[17:46] he didn't say it's still a thought until
[17:47] god speaks it
[17:50] god's already spoken it through prophets
[17:54] god's already said he's already spoken
[17:56] we've got our bibles here this morning
[17:57] the bible is full of prophets words it's
[18:00] been spoken by prophets he's not saying
[18:02] that god speaks it
[18:03] he's saying it still stays in thought
[18:06] form
[18:06] until you speak it
[18:10] so you understand when i say we
[18:12] understand the process
[18:13] now of the third poll and that is how do
[18:16] we bring god's thought into material
[18:18] it comes to a revelation to us and that
[18:20] revelation goes further that you begin
[18:22] to speak these things
[18:24] and say these things and you don't
[18:26] realize god's
[18:27] creative power is in your words to be
[18:30] able to speak things
[18:32] into existence
[18:37] am i losing any of you boy brother paul
[18:40] i sure don't feel like that today
[18:42] this week you don't know the week i've
[18:44] had i'm not looking at the week you had
[18:46] i'm not looking at your troubles i'm not
[18:48] looking at your finances can you say
[18:50] amen
[18:50] i'm looking at what god's word says you
[18:52] are with the holy ghost
[18:54] and this word materializes based upon
[18:57] what you're speaking now this sunday i
[19:00] won't get into it but i'm going to talk
[19:01] about the power of the tongue
[19:02] i'm going to talk about the power of the
[19:04] negative effect you can have on your
[19:06] wife
[19:06] your children your husband your families
[19:09] the world
[19:10] by your words you have a negative effect
[19:12] but you turn it around by the holy ghost
[19:14] and you start peaking positive
[19:16] you don't realize that some of those
[19:17] words have his anointing in it
[19:19] and can change in possible situations i
[19:22] say praise the lord somebody ought to
[19:24] clap their hands and say
[19:25] yes that's true brother
[19:28] hallelujah
[19:31] it's still a thought until you speak it
[19:34] and then he goes right to you now don't
[19:35] you see where jesus said
[19:37] if you say to this mountain he goes
[19:39] directly to that scripture
[19:41] because he's in the same theme he's
[19:43] saying if you say to this mountain
[19:45] it's still a thought until you speak it
[19:48] it's a thought then god reveals it then
[19:51] you speak it
[19:52] and that's when it starts to materialize
[19:56] so back before the world
[19:59] was formed the logos began to speak
[20:02] things this was his process
[20:03] it was in the mind of god to have a
[20:05] world to have creation
[20:07] to have animals to have this planet
[20:11] but also many other planets and in his
[20:12] first creation he began to
[20:15] create and he did it by the same process
[20:17] it was in the mind of god
[20:19] and by the logos he began to speak the
[20:21] world into existence
[20:23] and the solar system and it and he was
[20:26] standing there today we look at it the
[20:27] way we look at it
[20:28] it's just he was standing there and he
[20:30] just began to speak
[20:31] these different lights into existence
[20:34] kind of like when henry put all these in
[20:35] one by one
[20:36] whoever did god seen all the feminine it
[20:40] was in his
[20:40] it was in his mind all the firmament but
[20:43] it had to be spoken
[20:45] and guess what i want to say this we
[20:46] really don't know how long it took to
[20:49] materialize
[20:50] the only thing we know is when he spoke
[20:53] it
[20:53] it was as good as done there's some say
[20:56] a day some say a day of the lord is a
[20:58] thousand years
[20:59] so it took him 6 000 years to create the
[21:01] world some day six days
[21:03] i'm not going to hassle over that with
[21:04] you i can believe both
[21:06] i don't really know but all i do know is
[21:08] he spoke by the logos the word of god
[21:11] spoke god's thoughts and that no matter
[21:13] how many years it took to materialize
[21:16] it could happen right now if it took a
[21:18] thousand years whatever it took
[21:20] when it was spoke it was gonna
[21:22] materialize someday
[21:24] because it's god's word it's not your
[21:27] word it's god's word
[21:29] and when it comes on lips and begins to
[21:32] speak
[21:33] you're not speaking just some carnal
[21:35] thing you're speaking his word
[21:36] and it has the power within it to begin
[21:39] to materialize
[21:41] and begin to form blessed be his name
[21:45] and so now it's a thought god reviews it
[21:47] you speak it
[21:48] so here's he's saying this and so when i
[21:50] say our partner
[21:52] participation in creation it would be
[21:54] like god when he was creating the solar
[21:56] system the logos
[21:57] he would invite you alongside and he'd
[21:59] say come stand by me here
[22:01] i want you to participate in this
[22:03] creation so
[22:04] he said let there be this star and let
[22:07] there be this planet
[22:08] let there be and he would draw you
[22:10] alongside and he would say
[22:12] brother paul brother kyle listen tom
[22:15] brother tom come i want you to stand by
[22:18] me today
[22:18] and i want you to help participate in
[22:21] creation because
[22:22] i've given you the same power that this
[22:24] is his thoughts it's not your thoughts
[22:26] i want you to participate with me in
[22:28] creating the solar system
[22:30] so god says a few things the longest
[22:32] said but he says now you speak it and so
[22:34] you're standing there
[22:35] you're maybe you're a little nervous i
[22:36] don't know but if he said it then i'm
[22:38] gonna speak it
[22:39] let there be a planet right there called
[22:42] venus and we don't know how quick it
[22:45] took place
[22:46] maybe it took places in the second time
[22:49] way the prophet described it in some
[22:50] places said
[22:54] there it was
[22:57] the lord says do it again let there be
[23:01] a planet mars i don't know which one men
[23:04] or women are from but
[23:08] we wasn't thinking about that right then
[23:09] you think about the lord is saying
[23:11] participate in creation i want you to
[23:14] participate
[23:15] now it may not have happened then even
[23:17] though we were in him
[23:19] but i can tell you as we get past
[23:22] calvary
[23:22] and the holy ghost comes individuals in
[23:25] the book of acts which i'll get to today
[23:28] we are the lips that god
[23:32] uses in his new creation
[23:39] he didn't use the lips of jesus christ
[23:42] he did while he was here but in the new
[23:45] creation which the new creation the
[23:46] first one the solar system
[23:48] then he created this earth and and
[23:50] everything in it
[23:51] okay but then when he comes to his new
[23:53] creation the third creation
[23:55] of new creations in human beings the
[23:57] soul being changed
[23:58] when he come to that i'm going to read
[23:59] you places in the book of acts it is
[24:01] that it was his body it was his people
[24:04] things that were spoken on their lips
[24:07] are what begin to create those new
[24:10] creatures
[24:14] amen so as we think about this
[24:18] deeply if he asks you to come and
[24:20] participate he certainly does in this
[24:22] creation
[24:23] and we think it happens right now but we
[24:25] know it materialized but when he put man
[24:27] on earth
[24:28] then we go to the next phase let's take
[24:29] a step back here we go to the next phase
[24:32] when he put man on earth he actually
[24:34] made man a creator adam was a minor
[24:36] creator himself
[24:37] and he participated in things the
[24:40] heavens was one thing
[24:41] but on earth did you know that he
[24:43] created this earth
[24:44] for man to be a god over
[24:48] and after the earth was here adam was
[24:51] the one that spoke it was on his lips
[24:54] when when it was earthly related because
[24:57] he created this earth for man to rule
[25:01] and reign on
[25:02] the other planets i don't know who's up
[25:04] there i don't know if it is
[25:05] up there they're trying to find out but
[25:07] i knew though i do know
[25:09] that god made this planet this earth
[25:12] to put his son and daughter on that they
[25:14] would be the god over this earth
[25:17] so gets us now earthly things earthly
[25:20] related things
[25:21] he gave his sons power over earthly
[25:24] related things
[25:30] my and that's why we have
[25:34] jesus saying the disciples saying teach
[25:36] us to pray and he says pray like this
[25:39] our father which in heaven hallowed be
[25:41] thy name
[25:42] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[25:46] in earth
[25:49] as it is in heaven now why is he
[25:53] teaching you to pray that prayer because
[25:55] you had control over things of the earth
[26:00] not in heaven so much although i will
[26:02] say that there was such a burst of faith
[26:05] one day in joshua
[26:06] that he spoke to the son and said i need
[26:09] you to stand still for 24 hours
[26:12] now we didn't see a lot of that here in
[26:14] the old testament but there's
[26:16] every once while there's a birth of
[26:17] faith and a son of god catches his
[26:18] position
[26:19] he said i got something to do here and
[26:21] i'm just speaking it i don't have any
[26:22] scripture for it
[26:25] sun stands still and it stood still for
[26:28] 24 hours
[26:30] but anything earthly related not so much
[26:33] heavens but earthly related
[26:35] it's it's earthly things that he put his
[26:37] son's charge over adam says
[26:39] adam says this is given to me to do this
[26:42] and so maybe adam is standing there and
[26:44] he said what you know
[26:45] lord lord what are these little things
[26:47] running around over here
[26:50] and maybe the lord said well
[26:54] we don't have a name for it yet it was
[26:56] created
[26:57] but we don't have a name for it yet and
[27:00] the lord says to adam
[27:02] you're in charge of the earth you name
[27:03] what it is
[27:07] participation i
[27:10] i made you ruler over this earth i
[27:14] i i put you here to rule and reign under
[27:16] there so so don't be leaning back on me
[27:19] he said what's that little thing running
[27:20] around over there well it doesn't have a
[27:22] name i need you to name it
[27:24] he said all right i name you a squirrel
[27:31] i name you monkey there's this great big
[27:35] thing headed towards him you know and
[27:37] not to destroy him but just he's a big
[27:39] mammoth thing
[27:40] lord what's that he doesn't have a name
[27:43] yet
[27:45] name him elephant
[27:49] names all of them but the other thing
[27:52] was is that
[27:53] he said lord i i've been thinking about
[27:56] where that river is running
[27:58] over there and i see that mountain over
[28:00] there i was wondering
[28:02] i would like it if that river ran around
[28:04] this way
[28:05] and the mountain was over here and the
[28:07] lord says well
[28:08] speak it then i would like it to be
[28:12] different than that
[28:13] i would like that river to run around
[28:15] here and
[28:16] adam said you want me to speak it yes
[28:19] you speak it you're in charge of earthly
[28:21] things you're in charge of this
[28:23] if you say to it it'll be removed
[28:29] he said all right lord i want that river
[28:31] to run in there and he begins to speak
[28:33] these things
[28:34] and when he spoke them it materialized
[28:37] it and it all changed
[28:43] i don't need to move physical mountains
[28:48] like i don't need any more squirrels
[28:51] jesus said if you say to this mountain
[28:52] why do i if i if
[28:54] if i wanted to move mountains i'd move
[28:56] all the smoky mountains
[28:58] just behind my backyard over here on
[29:00] concierge street
[29:01] i'd move all of them all the smokies up
[29:04] in michigan now
[29:10] and my wife would be saying amen
[29:14] i would but i don't think jesus meant
[29:16] for us to go
[29:17] move physical mountains because you've
[29:20] got some bigger mountains than the
[29:22] smokies in your life
[29:28] when he says whatsoever things you
[29:29] desire in prayer whatsoever things are
[29:31] laying there
[29:33] brother brahman says these things are on
[29:35] conditions they're on motive and
[29:36] different things the motive has to be
[29:38] right but when the motive is right
[29:40] and god places a desire there then one
[29:44] thing needed is for you to begin
[29:45] speaking it that's true
[29:49] see this is it can be dangerous
[29:50] territory for people
[29:52] because you think you're going to get
[29:53] off track and the preacher is going to
[29:54] get off track and
[29:55] and you know we are yielding ourselves
[29:57] saying lord
[29:58] let me yield myself more so that you can
[30:01] trust me with your word
[30:03] bring me your desire but lord am i
[30:05] missing out
[30:06] on what you have given me here to speak
[30:09] and to pray and to change situations
[30:13] i ask you to consider that i ask you to
[30:16] consider if you are living below your
[30:17] privileges
[30:18] i said last sunday that a lot of you are
[30:20] living below your potential as a
[30:21] christian
[30:22] you have a lot more potential to be
[30:23] spirit-filled and moving on with the
[30:25] lord
[30:26] things are holding you back walls are up
[30:28] but listen your spiritual life is not
[30:30] over it is not done
[30:31] i said that about my own physical life
[30:33] my wife says your days are not over your
[30:35] life and over and your spiritual life
[30:37] this morning your spiritual life is not
[30:39] over god has many more things for you to
[30:42] grow into
[30:47] plus it'd be his name so
[30:51] that's all earthly things that's that's
[30:53] not god's creation
[30:55] his third creation was new creatures we
[30:56] have to move on now
[30:58] and the more that i look at this subject
[31:00] it seems that we have
[31:02] we have a huge part in pulling the
[31:05] potential of
[31:06] christ out of others we are handed the
[31:09] keys to unlock the kingdom within people
[31:12] in this work of new creations god used
[31:15] his own
[31:15] people to speak just the right words and
[31:18] bring others
[31:19] to their potentials in the first
[31:22] creation
[31:23] he by his work spoke those things unseen
[31:26] into existence
[31:27] in this new creation he is still
[31:29] speaking but on whose lips
[31:32] if something is laying there that is
[31:33] untapped yet
[31:35] word to become flesh who is it that
[31:37] pulls this out
[31:39] god works through his body
[31:42] i'm reminding you of our two scriptures
[31:44] last sunday matthew 16 18.
[31:46] if you can pull that up again matthew 16
[31:48] and verse 18
[31:50] and i say unto thee thou art peter and
[31:53] upon this rock
[31:54] i will build my church and the gates of
[31:56] hell shall not prevail against it
[31:58] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[32:01] the kingdom of heaven
[32:02] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[32:05] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[32:07] thou shalt loose on earth
[32:08] shall be loosed in heaven acts 1 verse 8
[32:11] acts 1 and verse 8 we read this last
[32:13] sunday but ye
[32:14] shall receive power but ye shall receive
[32:17] power
[32:18] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[32:21] and ye shall be witnesses
[32:22] unto me both in jerusalem and in judea
[32:26] and samaria and under the uttermost part
[32:29] of the earth
[32:30] why does god give you the holy ghost not
[32:33] for yourself as such
[32:34] but you receive power that you become a
[32:37] witness
[32:40] you receive power in your life to
[32:42] overcome sin
[32:43] power to overcome the world but what's
[32:45] the real purpose
[32:47] that you speak on your lips and you are
[32:49] a witness
[32:50] to the word we're here
[32:53] to affect others we're here to find
[32:56] another elected seed
[32:58] we're here our businesses our money our
[33:01] resources
[33:03] everything our families we are here to
[33:05] serve the lord
[33:07] we are here to affect this generation
[33:09] for the lord
[33:11] i pray this morning god would burn every
[33:13] bit of selfishness out of you
[33:15] in every goal or every agenda or every
[33:18] business venture that's to self-satisfy
[33:21] you
[33:22] i pray god would burn that out of you
[33:24] and say i'm gonna do this lord i pray
[33:26] for your direction but i'm doing it
[33:28] for the kingdom of god i'm doing it to
[33:30] affect souls for his kingdom
[33:33] we're here for that can you say amen and
[33:36] a lot of believers have lived their
[33:37] whole
[33:38] life selfish if you'll catch this that
[33:40] he doesn't give you his spirit
[33:41] for yourself marriages
[33:45] break down because of selfishness
[33:49] the two fighting i want things my way
[33:53] but if you read the bible marriage is
[33:55] not about you
[33:57] marriage is about sacrificial life to
[33:59] the other person
[34:01] and actually for a husband you're the
[34:03] encourager and nourisher in the things
[34:05] of the lord
[34:07] that she is washed in other words you're
[34:09] providing an environment can you say man
[34:12] you're making decisions as a daddy of
[34:14] what priorities are in life
[34:16] and it's not the world and television
[34:18] and all kinds of sports
[34:20] the priority is the lord and what he
[34:22] wants to do in our lives
[34:24] teach your children that the lord is
[34:26] number one
[34:31] hallelujah so
[34:34] acts you shall receive power after the
[34:37] holy ghost is coming so let's just talk
[34:39] about that
[34:39] so when these new creations begin to
[34:42] start in the book of acts
[34:44] believers because of those scriptures
[34:47] now
[34:48] believers are participating in speaking
[34:51] it
[34:51] to another one to untap a seed of god
[34:54] thousands i think came the first day and
[34:56] you know why thousands came
[34:58] because peter had the keys of the
[34:59] kingdom and he stood there and they said
[35:01] what do we need to be to
[35:03] do to be saved i stumble sometimes
[35:06] what do we need to do to be saved
[35:11] and now peter's standing there and if he
[35:14] hadn't
[35:14] said nothing he has the keys to the
[35:16] kingdom to unlock this whole thing
[35:19] if he'd have been selfish he'd have
[35:21] looked over the crowd and said
[35:23] well i don't even know if god could
[35:26] accept you
[35:30] see you complicate things with your
[35:31] prejudice
[35:33] you're looking at the flesh peter had to
[35:35] stand that day and know no man after the
[35:37] flesh
[35:38] and had to believe the person's asking
[35:40] that question because
[35:42] something is in here saying i want to
[35:44] know what to do to be saved
[35:46] and peter had to put away what he was
[35:48] looking at and say i'm
[35:50] i'm i am focusing in on that hunger
[35:52] right there
[35:53] that question that that man asked me in
[35:56] the line at work
[35:57] that employee asked me another question
[35:59] i'm focusing in i said lord
[36:00] use me right now because the words i say
[36:03] can untap that seed of god that lays
[36:05] there
[36:05] i don't care if they got tattoos i don't
[36:07] care if they got earrings hanging out of
[36:09] their ear
[36:09] i don't care what they look like right
[36:11] now i'm a son of god
[36:13] and i'm not knowing this person after
[36:14] the flesh i'm going for that soul
[36:18] i am called as an ambassador that what i
[36:22] speak could untap what's in that person
[36:28] see we got to quit living selfishly we
[36:30] caught to quit
[36:31] judging from the flesh we've got to quit
[36:34] looking at the outside
[36:36] we got to quit giving people the
[36:38] elevator look
[36:43] sometimes we just we knock them out of
[36:44] the kingdom before they even spoken to
[36:46] us
[36:47] they'd never receive that shame on us
[36:51] that's selfishness
[36:53] we're not here to serve ourselves we're
[36:54] not here to choose
[36:56] who god would choose we're here to be a
[36:58] vessel to speak just the right word
[37:00] that would untap something within that
[37:02] person don't you dare judge them by the
[37:04] flesh
[37:06] i watched the healing line friday night
[37:07] at brother russell's i went over there
[37:09] and just enjoyed the healing life they
[37:11] invited the community
[37:12] come and be prayed for whatever need you
[37:14] have fill out a prayer card
[37:16] i went there and prayed for different i
[37:17] watched them come through there i'll
[37:19] tell you they look like some rough
[37:20] characters
[37:21] and brother brother andrew have such a
[37:23] burden for the community that way
[37:24] they look pretty rough they look bound
[37:26] and they were wearing all kinds of
[37:28] things
[37:28] coming through that prayer line but
[37:29] listen if they desire something from god
[37:32] let them come through there let's pray
[37:33] for them i walk through the prayer line
[37:36] myself i stood in for sister janice
[37:38] sister tiffany
[37:39] a few other needs in the church i wrote
[37:40] up prayer cards because i'm burdened i
[37:42] believe god's going to be a miracle for
[37:43] these people
[37:44] i stood there but to watch these people
[37:46] if you'd have judged them from the flesh
[37:48] you'd have said you don't even belong
[37:49] here but we're not doing that
[37:51] we're believers and we're looking for
[37:52] what's in that soul
[37:58] hallelujah shame on us as believers all
[38:02] these years
[38:03] to make this message just an outward
[38:07] dress code shame on us
[38:11] you know me i preach on modesty i preach
[38:14] on these things i believe them because
[38:15] they're in the bible
[38:17] but our first approach to a person is
[38:19] not about what they're wearing
[38:21] it's that soul that needs to be baptized
[38:24] with the holy ghost
[38:25] we have made this message a religion by
[38:28] the outward thing we judge whether a
[38:29] person is acceptable or not
[38:31] don't make this message of religion
[38:33] don't make the dress code this message
[38:35] this message isn't a dress code this
[38:37] message is holy ghost coming into the
[38:39] people
[38:43] by the word spoken on our lips
[38:46] oh i could get on that a lot more
[38:49] modesty
[38:50] yeah i've got a sermon coming up i'm
[38:53] going to nail it i'm going to preach it
[38:55] in a way you've probably never heard it
[38:56] before i also got a little sermon god
[38:59] gave me that i was so grieved i read an
[39:01] article from
[39:02] this haley baldwin uh she's the wife of
[39:05] justin bieber i mean bieber
[39:09] my heart was so grieved i went to prayer
[39:11] for and i want to read i want to preach
[39:13] a message the language
[39:14] the new language of the antichrist
[39:17] because that woman in her words
[39:19] shows the deception if some preacher has
[39:21] deceived her to present another jesus to
[39:24] her
[39:24] that she can dress almost naked and
[39:27] still feels like she's a christian
[39:31] god have mercy on her soul and the
[39:33] people mostly
[39:34] who's deceived her don't preach on
[39:36] modesty we preach on clothes
[39:38] we preach men and women are different we
[39:40] preach god didn't create
[39:43] adam and steve he created adam and eve
[39:47] don't ever make this message all about
[39:49] that
[39:52] because you'll get distracted by what a
[39:54] person is wearing
[39:56] does it reflect what's coming out in the
[39:57] heart yes it does all the more reason to
[40:00] change the heart
[40:03] we got the holy oats to change people's
[40:05] hearts
[40:06] praise the lord let's give the lord a
[40:09] hand while i get a drink
[40:15] god is good so
[40:20] believers in this new creation are
[40:22] participating in speaking it to one
[40:24] another
[40:24] in fact i'm going to go here on a limb
[40:27] and say
[40:28] there is not one incident in the book of
[40:31] acts where a believer is filled with the
[40:33] holy ghost
[40:34] without someone there in the body
[40:36] speaking something first
[40:40] think about it and brother bran taught
[40:43] us that he says the seed comes through
[40:44] the body
[40:45] he says the seed word comes through the
[40:47] body somebody spoke something and that
[40:49] day peter
[40:50] he they said what do we need to be saved
[40:52] he had the keys to the kingdom
[40:53] he said repent be bad he gave the key to
[40:55] it and thousands come to the lord and
[40:57] are baptized that day
[40:59] we don't have those numbers but
[41:00] sometimes we do it and that day it did
[41:01] it he unlocked the entire kingdom to
[41:03] those people
[41:04] by what if he hadn't said nothing it
[41:06] wouldn't happen but peter standing there
[41:08] a human being
[41:09] spoke just the right words and all those
[41:11] people were birthed into the kingdom of
[41:12] god
[41:15] he participated in the new creations
[41:18] and there they all were standing there
[41:20] we want to be baptized in the name
[41:22] of the lord jesus christ they didn't
[41:24] look right yet
[41:26] but then we something in your words drew
[41:28] us we want to be baptized they're all
[41:30] standing there
[41:31] they didn't look right but peter said
[41:34] let's baptize them
[41:36] let's see them filled with the spirit of
[41:38] god
[41:45] not one incident is where a believer is
[41:47] filled with the holy ghost
[41:49] without somebody speaking something
[41:53] and
[41:56] in other words there's not one incident
[41:58] there were angels in the book of acts
[42:00] that
[42:00] come to people there was an angel the
[42:03] lord came to
[42:03] saul paul so it's not that there weren't
[42:06] angels but i'm telling you when there
[42:08] was a new creation started of the holy
[42:10] ghost
[42:10] someone of another body member had to
[42:13] speak something
[42:17] so and that was you know let me just get
[42:20] to the examples here
[42:22] not one got the birth by an angel or a
[42:24] cloud
[42:25] or alone with their bible
[42:29] i'm saying that because people say i
[42:31] don't need a church i don't need a
[42:32] preacher
[42:33] i don't need a pastor i can go up here
[42:35] and live up north or way down south
[42:38] in key west and i just need my bible and
[42:41] god
[42:42] and i'll get it all that way your bible
[42:44] you should read it because it declares
[42:46] different than that
[42:48] because in the book of acts there was a
[42:51] guy named
[42:52] um well he's not he didn't get his name
[42:55] but
[42:55] he's the ethiopian eunuch and he's in
[42:58] the chariot
[42:59] reading his bible trying to figure it
[43:02] out
[43:04] and i'm sure he got little lessons out
[43:05] of it it was all great all the old
[43:06] testament stories
[43:08] but then he started to read these
[43:09] scriptures like isaiah said he was led
[43:10] as a lamb to the slaughter and said
[43:12] and he said what is this i don't
[43:14] understand this so
[43:15] he alone with his bible could not bring
[43:17] the new creation of a new birth
[43:20] so philip is called i think a deacon
[43:22] philip is
[43:23] a deacon not a minister
[43:26] a deacon phillips called and said i want
[43:29] you to leave this meeting and i want you
[43:30] to go see there's a
[43:32] ethiopian eunuch here he's sitting there
[43:34] with his bible and he needs help
[43:36] okay now this is a story in the bible
[43:39] but it's
[43:40] everything that i'm preaching they were
[43:42] human beings
[43:43] and philip had a mind just like you do
[43:47] and he's trying to figure out
[43:48] why is god sending me down there maybe
[43:50] he's got a little fears
[43:51] will i say the right thing i don't know
[43:54] but i'm going to obey god
[43:55] and do what he says to do and when he
[43:57] gets there he says
[43:58] he says i jump up in the chair he jumps
[44:00] up there and he's reading through the
[44:02] scriptures
[44:03] and the man says to him
[44:07] or philip says do you understand what
[44:10] you're reading
[44:13] see it takes revelation do you
[44:16] understand would you pull that scripture
[44:18] up in acts
[44:19] chapter 8 and verse 26 do you
[44:22] understand what you're reading and he
[44:25] says
[44:26] how can i and the angel lord spoken to
[44:29] philip saying arise and go
[44:30] okay clip down there i got the wrong one
[44:33] and he arose and went okay
[44:35] on down a little further was returning
[44:37] seeing his chariot read isaiah's the
[44:38] prophet
[44:39] then the spirit said unto philip go near
[44:40] and join thyself to this chariot
[44:43] and philip ran thither to him and heard
[44:45] him read the prophet jesus and said
[44:46] understand though what thou were eatest
[44:48] and philip and he said how can i except
[44:51] some man should guide me
[44:52] and he desired philip that he would come
[44:54] up and sit with him
[44:56] the place of the scripture which he read
[44:57] was he was led as a lamb sheep to the
[44:59] slaughter and like a land dumb before
[45:00] his ears so open he nod his mouth
[45:03] in his humiliation his judgment was
[45:04] taken away and who shall declare his
[45:06] generation
[45:06] for his life is taken from the earth
[45:09] next one and the eunuch answer phone
[45:10] said
[45:11] i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet
[45:12] this of himself or some other man
[45:15] and then philip
[45:21] you see it then philip first step
[45:24] open his mouth
[45:28] at that moment if he would have judged
[45:30] him or let his carnal mind or his fear
[45:32] get involved
[45:33] he wouldn't and if he hadn't opened his
[45:35] mouth this man would not have become a
[45:38] new creation
[45:40] then philip opened his mouth and began
[45:43] at the same
[45:44] scripture and preached unto him
[45:47] jesus the revealed word for the hour
[45:52] i say praise the lord
[45:55] in the new testament church in the new
[45:57] creations philip
[45:59] is participating in that creation
[46:03] is anybody listening to me today by
[46:06] opening his mouth
[46:08] and the anointed words no matter what
[46:10] carnality he felt at that time or felt
[46:12] about himself or that eunuch he opened
[46:14] his mouth and he declared jesus unto him
[46:17] and the scriptures came alive
[46:20] because that's what happens people are
[46:22] going to read the bible but there's
[46:23] certain ones in there he was looking for
[46:24] the messiah
[46:25] of that day couldn't tie it together it
[46:27] took a holy ghost-filled believer
[46:28] to break it down and to be able to share
[46:30] with him jesus which is the revealed
[46:32] worthy hour what's the next scripture
[46:34] say
[46:35] and as they went on their way they came
[46:36] under a certain water and the eunuch
[46:38] said see
[46:38] here is water what doth hinder me to be
[46:42] baptized praise the lord that doesn't
[46:44] happen unless
[46:45] god's pulling something out of them by
[46:48] what philip just said
[46:50] now there's another incident in acts
[46:53] chapter 9
[46:55] paul meets a light the next chapter paul
[46:57] meets a light
[46:58] it's jesus he meets jesus
[47:03] jesus speaks to him
[47:07] who are you lord he said i'm jesus whom
[47:10] you're persecuting
[47:11] as you go to try to put the saints in
[47:13] jail and my people in jail
[47:15] it's me that you're persecuting i'm
[47:16] paraphrasing this it's jesus
[47:19] jesus speaks to him in a pillar of fire
[47:21] in a light
[47:23] but guess what no new creation
[47:26] in paul yet
[47:30] even by hearing from jesus
[47:33] out of a light
[47:37] because god says
[47:40] my body will participate
[47:43] in this creation i'll speak it
[47:47] through my body can you imagine
[47:51] he's talked to jesus and doesn't even
[47:54] have the new birth yet
[47:57] if a pillar of fire came to you say well
[47:59] that's the ultimate experience that
[48:00] jesus spoke to me in the pill of fire
[48:01] that's it doesn't mean you have the
[48:03] birth yet doesn't mean you're a new
[48:05] creation yet
[48:06] if something's changed your life will
[48:08] change
[48:12] paul wasn't changed yet very religious
[48:13] man theologian all these of and now he's
[48:15] met the lord himself
[48:17] in a pillar of fire but he still does
[48:19] not have
[48:20] this new creation in his soul yet why
[48:22] because god says
[48:24] my body will participate in creation you
[48:27] guys have that scripture we can read
[48:28] through that one because i want people
[48:29] to see it in their bibles
[48:31] what i'm preaching to you today is in
[48:33] the book of acts so much that he used
[48:36] his body can you say amen acts chapter 9
[48:39] and pull up if you would verse oh
[48:42] my i'm in second corinthians still
[48:47] acts chapter 9.
[48:53] all right so he meets the light verse
[48:54] 10. and there was a certain disciple
[48:56] acts chapter 9 verse 10 there's a
[48:58] certain disciple in damascus named
[48:59] ananias
[49:00] and to him said the lord in a vision
[49:02] ananias and he said behold i am here
[49:04] lord
[49:05] and the lord said unto him arise and go
[49:07] into the street which is called straight
[49:09] and inquire the house of judas for one
[49:11] called saul of tarsus
[49:13] for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a
[49:15] vision of man named ananias coming in
[49:17] and putting his hand on him that he
[49:19] might receive his sight because he had
[49:21] been blinded by seeing the bill of fire
[49:23] and then ananias answered lord i have
[49:26] heard by
[49:27] many of this man now much evil he hath
[49:30] done
[49:31] to thy saints at jerusalem here's the
[49:34] human side
[49:35] of ananias which all of you have
[49:39] here's the human if you read the book of
[49:41] acts the human side comes out
[49:43] a lot we think these book of acts
[49:46] believers are just
[49:47] way on the clouds somewhere just you
[49:50] know creative power
[49:51] but we see their humanness many times
[49:54] when they prayed all night for peter to
[49:56] come out of jail and he shows up at the
[49:58] door
[49:58] they were afraid and didn't believe it
[50:00] was peter
[50:02] they're praying for his deliverance he
[50:04] shows up at the door and they're running
[50:05] away saying it's the spirit
[50:09] they weren't even believing their own
[50:10] prayer
[50:12] that's the humanness in the book of acts
[50:15] you have the same humanness
[50:16] and yet with the holy ghost you've got
[50:18] god there to open the kingdom to other
[50:20] people
[50:22] and i says lord this man do you know
[50:25] this but he didn't say that because the
[50:27] lord but i'm just reminding you
[50:29] do you know are you sure you want me to
[50:31] go to this saul
[50:32] have you heard what he's doing to our
[50:34] people
[50:35] and ananias he doesn't even show any
[50:38] position
[50:38] he's just a disciple he's just a
[50:40] believer he
[50:42] but god says i'm going to sin and this
[50:43] is this is god's sense of humor
[50:46] because i love this god's sense of humor
[50:48] he's going to take the one of the
[50:49] greatest
[50:50] theologians that's learned from the
[50:52] greatest theologians that knows
[50:54] all about the old testament saul and
[50:56] he's on a religious agenda
[50:58] inquisition to kill all those and put
[51:01] him in jail and he
[51:02] knows the word and then he picks maybe
[51:04] this new disciple
[51:05] ananias and he's i'm going to choose him
[51:08] to go
[51:09] and pray for this great theologian
[51:12] this is god's sense of humor because
[51:14] under normal circumstances
[51:16] they wouldn't be in the same room
[51:17] together ananias is going to say i'm not
[51:19] the guy for the job to talk to him
[51:21] he's intimidated by him and paul
[51:23] probably is going to look
[51:25] say there's a movie there like peter and
[51:27] paul and
[51:28] ananias consist paul says who are you he
[51:30] couldn't see ananias and paul goes
[51:33] ananias ananias i love how he says it
[51:35] because it's like
[51:37] who are you
[51:40] who are you god just puts this
[51:43] arrangement together
[51:45] and then in just a few seconds ananias
[51:48] is going to be used
[51:50] to bring a new creation in the prophet
[51:54] paul
[51:57] he hears from jesus out of a pillar of
[51:59] fire which a prophet should
[52:03] he's going to be the prophet that's
[52:04] going to write an apostle that writes
[52:06] 14 books of the new testament he's going
[52:08] to go on the backside of the desert
[52:10] study for three and a half years he's
[52:11] going to have a huge
[52:13] worldwide ministry and god sends
[52:16] little ananias so he can get his birth
[52:19] first
[52:22] love god's sense of humor i love it
[52:26] so we learned from that that don't you
[52:28] ever
[52:30] put someone in a category don't you ever
[52:32] write someone off
[52:33] don't you ever say saul was voted by the
[52:37] church as the least
[52:38] likely person to write foot 14 books in
[52:41] the new testament
[52:42] paul was voted the least likely to
[52:44] succeed the very last
[52:46] person they would think of to be a holy
[52:48] ghost-filled believer
[52:49] and even take the gospel to the gentiles
[52:52] no way
[52:53] can't happen but don't you dare write
[52:56] someone off
[52:57] because god says in the further
[52:58] scriptures as ananias says this stuff
[53:01] i'll read it here
[53:02] ananias says have you seen the vision
[53:04] jesus and he said lord i have heard by
[53:06] many of this man
[53:07] verse 13 how much evil he has done to
[53:09] the saints at jerusalem
[53:10] and here he has authority from the chief
[53:13] priests to bind
[53:14] all that the call in thy name but the
[53:16] lord said unto ananias
[53:18] go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
[53:22] unto me to bear my name before
[53:25] the gentiles and kings and the children
[53:28] of israel for i will show him how great
[53:31] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[53:33] and ananias went his way entered the
[53:35] house putting his hands on him said
[53:37] brother saul
[53:38] the lord even jesus that appeared unto
[53:40] thee in the way as thou camest
[53:41] has sent me that thou mightest receive
[53:43] thy sight
[53:44] and be filled with the holy ghost
[53:47] and immediately there fell from his eyes
[53:50] as it had been scales
[53:51] and he received sight for with and arose
[53:54] and was baptized ananias participated
[53:59] in that creation of paul the prophet
[54:07] god chose a nobody to go to a somebody
[54:11] so that somebody could recognize he's a
[54:13] nobody
[54:14] and ananias is a somebody
[54:20] go ahead put that on your refrigerator
[54:22] this week
[54:24] that was fresh that's not in my notes
[54:26] put it on the refrigerator
[54:27] god took a nobody to bring the create
[54:31] new creation
[54:32] to a somebody and teach to somebody he's
[54:34] a nobody
[54:35] and to acknowledge that ananias is the
[54:37] real somebody
[54:41] why is he a somebody why is he most
[54:43] important
[54:44] not because of ananias flesh he's
[54:46] holding the word
[54:48] he's got the keys to the kingdom what he
[54:51] says
[54:52] could have the anointing in it to break
[54:55] down
[54:57] and break every chain do you sing that
[54:59] this morning brother michael break every
[55:01] chain
[55:02] i thought you're saying that this one
[55:03] we'll sing it here in a minute after i'm
[55:05] done
[55:07] god used nobody to go to a somebody
[55:10] i'm trying to say that again so i
[55:12] remember it it's good
[55:16] don't laugh time you forget things too
[55:18] you know that
[55:21] yeah that's a good idea you're my age
[55:25] aren't you you have the same issues
[55:29] you're sitting there laughing at me god
[55:32] used
[55:33] a nobody to bring the new creation to a
[55:36] somebody
[55:36] so that somebody could recognize he's
[55:38] really a nobody
[55:39] and the nobody is a somebody
[55:43] it's different every time i say it
[55:46] whoo all right get up here and
[55:50] figure out where i'm at
[55:55] i it's kind of god's sense of humor can
[55:57] you say amen
[56:00] so if you're prejudging their past and
[56:03] it's all through the book of acts
[56:05] i preach a lot about through the years
[56:07] about peter
[56:08] and his prejudice against the gentiles
[56:11] and god calls him to go to the house of
[56:13] cornelius
[56:15] and says don't call what i've called
[56:18] clean unclean rebukes them
[56:22] and that's peter with the holy ghost
[56:26] holding back from telling what he knows
[56:29] just because he's got prejudice against
[56:31] the gentiles
[56:33] and so even with the holy ghost god has
[56:36] to deal
[56:37] with people's prejudice in this method
[56:40] they're not wearing the right thing they
[56:42] don't look the right way
[56:44] may god humble you and deal with your
[56:46] prejudice
[56:48] some people they only need themselves
[56:50] they only need their family never think
[56:52] of someone else never think of
[56:53] connecting with somebody else that their
[56:56] words could be encouraged to someone
[56:57] else in the bible they don't need
[56:58] anybody
[56:59] i say that's selfish i say that god if
[57:02] you have the holy ghost you have
[57:03] something within you to minister to the
[57:05] rest of the body
[57:06] you might say something to another body
[57:08] member but you're not even around them
[57:09] enough to allow that to happen
[57:13] better re-examine your life and see
[57:14] maybe there's too much selfishness there
[57:17] i need my business i need my life i need
[57:19] my job i need my kids that's pretty much
[57:21] it and that is your first responsibility
[57:23] but don't forget you're put on this
[57:25] earth to be the holy ghost
[57:27] to someone else and to speak words of
[57:30] encouragement to someone else
[57:32] can you say amen i think of brother
[57:35] andrew
[57:37] caruso out there friday night and when
[57:39] he was 2006 they were coming to the lord
[57:41] and they were rough guys
[57:42] and there was this alex who by the way
[57:46] preached on friday night and alex and he
[57:48] come around
[57:49] and he said there was such tension
[57:50] between them that you know borderline
[57:52] fighting and they were back and forth
[57:55] and then when andrew come to the lord
[57:56] then he shared the message with
[57:58] this alex after all the fighting
[58:01] intention
[58:02] alex is the one voted voted last likely
[58:05] to be the one coming to the word
[58:07] and he came to the message in the light
[58:10] filled with the holy ghost
[58:11] and preached a wonderful service now
[58:14] preaching this message
[58:16] he'll preach for us lord willing on the
[58:18] tri-state youth meeting he'll be here
[58:20] alex mcgoulas some of you know him from
[58:22] brother ray's church
[58:23] but to see what i preached today is that
[58:26] somebody
[58:27] with the holy ghost begin to speak the
[58:29] words and someone who is the least
[58:31] likely to come
[58:32] is now preaching the word of god and
[58:35] brother alex said friday night he
[58:36] pointed to a man
[58:38] sitting there he's about 60 years old
[58:40] and he said about five years ago
[58:42] he was sitting in his car this man was
[58:43] sitting in here there's a testimony
[58:45] he said he was sitting in his car and he
[58:47] was hit by a car
[58:48] at going 55 miles an hour he was hit
[58:52] as he was sitting permanent there
[58:55] he the car came and hit him that fast
[58:57] they took him in the hospital
[58:58] after a few hours the doctors gave him
[59:01] no hope
[59:02] they said if if he even comes out of
[59:04] this
[59:05] hospital alive he'll never walk again
[59:08] he's completely finished and it was
[59:10] brother alex heard about it
[59:12] and went to prayer and he spoke and god
[59:14] showed him showed him to say
[59:16] he's going to walk out of there he's
[59:18] going to be completely well in two days
[59:20] and that man raised his head i testified
[59:22] two days i had dinner with him
[59:24] applebee's after two days he walked out
[59:26] of the hospital completely whole
[59:34] you see and alex back in 2005 was the
[59:37] least likely to be
[59:38] anything and here he has received the
[59:41] word of the lord now
[59:43] some five years ago season for someone
[59:45] else to be healed
[59:46] listen friends god puts the holy ghost
[59:48] in us for a reason
[59:49] and it's not for you it's not for you
[59:53] it's to open the kingdom to that person
[59:56] sitting next to you
[59:57] or that person at work you have to be a
[1:00:01] big
[1:00:01] bible scholar oh brother paul i get
[1:00:04] nervous about what to say
[1:00:06] jesus said don't pre-think what you're
[1:00:08] going to say in that hour
[1:00:09] it'll be given to you in that hour how
[1:00:11] many remember that scripture
[1:00:14] gets so nervous about stuff we need to
[1:00:16] depend on the word that's lying within
[1:00:17] us
[1:00:18] so i'm preaching to build your faith
[1:00:20] today and i'm almost done but we have
[1:00:21] the word
[1:00:22] how many believe we have the word it's
[1:00:25] not just that we have when i say we have
[1:00:27] the word it's not just we have our
[1:00:28] bibles
[1:00:29] it's that's not that we have the word
[1:00:31] the substance of the creative power of
[1:00:33] god through the holy ghost
[1:00:34] that's the word the spoken word of god
[1:00:36] god gave us this to read but remember
[1:00:38] adam and eve didn't have this
[1:00:39] and they had all power over the earth
[1:00:43] so when i say we have the word how many
[1:00:45] appreciate your bibles
[1:00:46] i appreciate this bible i love this
[1:00:49] bible it's my favorite book
[1:00:50] but you see now when i say we have the
[1:00:52] word it's not that you're holding your
[1:00:54] bible
[1:00:54] and you should appreciate your bible you
[1:00:56] should bring your bible to church i know
[1:00:57] they put it up on here but you need to
[1:00:58] bring your bring your sword to church
[1:01:00] i'd encourage you to do that
[1:01:01] and we get a little bit lazy but i think
[1:01:03] you should you know hold your bible
[1:01:05] bring it to church
[1:01:06] but these bibles we're thankful for them
[1:01:07] because god actually did give our bibles
[1:01:09] back to us
[1:01:10] the catholic church took our bibles away
[1:01:12] from us
[1:01:14] i said the catholic church took the
[1:01:15] bibles away you can't read that only us
[1:01:18] priests can read it
[1:01:19] the catholic church took the bibles away
[1:01:21] but under luther and those different
[1:01:23] god gave our bibles back to us they got
[1:01:26] the printing press and god allowed the
[1:01:28] printing press to be
[1:01:29] to be invented so we could have our
[1:01:31] bibles back
[1:01:34] so i'm thankful for this bible people
[1:01:36] have given their lives for this bible
[1:01:38] that you have this morning
[1:01:39] but when i say we have the word as the
[1:01:41] bride and we have thus saith the lord we
[1:01:43] have it
[1:01:44] i'm not talking about holding your bible
[1:01:46] i'm talking about we have the substance
[1:01:48] of the spoken word of god to be able to
[1:01:51] speak
[1:01:52] life to another individual
[1:01:55] we have thus saith the lord we have
[1:01:58] his word can you say man eve had no
[1:02:01] bible
[1:02:02] but she had her and adam had the word
[1:02:04] and then she fell from that word
[1:02:06] she fell from it and then god gave the
[1:02:09] word back after calvary
[1:02:11] he began to give it back to the people
[1:02:13] and when the people had the word back
[1:02:15] creation was taken place on their lips
[1:02:18] and then
[1:02:19] the church fell from the word the second
[1:02:21] eve
[1:02:22] fell from the word and throughout dark
[1:02:24] church ages they got away from the word
[1:02:26] they lost their bibles but they got away
[1:02:27] from the word
[1:02:28] after the book of acts they got away
[1:02:30] from it and then in the end time god
[1:02:32] prophesied through his prophet said
[1:02:34] i will give the word back to the people
[1:02:37] at the opening of the seals the third
[1:02:39] poll
[1:02:39] i'm giving the word back that eve lost
[1:02:43] i'm giving the word back that the book
[1:02:46] of acts people lost
[1:02:48] i'm giving the word back to the people
[1:02:51] again can you say man
[1:02:54] then he gives it back thanks be to god
[1:02:56] but the word is more than just our
[1:02:58] bibles
[1:02:58] it's the power of god's thought by
[1:03:00] revelation given back to the people
[1:03:03] and when she has it she has creative
[1:03:06] power again i hope i'm not preaching up
[1:03:09] here to you today
[1:03:10] i hope i'm preaching what's in your
[1:03:11] heart
[1:03:13] i hope you're not thinking squirrels
[1:03:15] creating squirrels
[1:03:17] that's not why god gives it to you it's
[1:03:20] to pull
[1:03:20] out of you and out of others what's on
[1:03:23] the inside
[1:03:24] that is not seen never mind squirrels
[1:03:28] oh if i could create a squirrel i'd be
[1:03:31] really proof that i have the holy ghost
[1:03:36] never mind creating squirrels just try
[1:03:38] to create a better attitude in you
[1:03:42] sometimes
[1:03:44] people this message you know they want
[1:03:46] squirrels it's like just create a better
[1:03:48] marriage
[1:03:52] create a better attitude towards people
[1:03:55] use the word to create a more positive
[1:03:58] atmosphere
[1:04:01] god help us for being negative homes and
[1:04:03] negative families and
[1:04:05] and speaking gossip about the worst of
[1:04:07] somebody before we believe the best of
[1:04:09] somebody
[1:04:10] this is believers i'm talking to can you
[1:04:12] say man we can speak words of life and
[1:04:14] in front of our children we can speak
[1:04:16] negative or we can speak positive
[1:04:18] but i think we should change that don't
[1:04:20] worry about squirrels just create the
[1:04:21] right
[1:04:22] speech in your own lips
[1:04:26] and you will see god begin to work in
[1:04:29] that atmosphere
[1:04:30] create the right atmosphere in your home
[1:04:32] that one day when brother brahms home
[1:04:33] was in disarray
[1:04:35] and she was all nervous sister meaty and
[1:04:37] the kids were fighting with one another
[1:04:39] i know none of your children ever fight
[1:04:40] with none other but brother adams did
[1:04:42] i know none of you ever have marriage
[1:04:44] issues intentions
[1:04:45] none of you do my wife said sometimes
[1:04:48] people will sin
[1:04:49] they listen to sometimes sometimes my
[1:04:52] wife and i
[1:04:53] we love one another with all of our
[1:04:54] heart and we're dedicated to one another
[1:04:56] of course we're
[1:04:58] we're soul mates but it doesn't mean
[1:05:00] that sometimes
[1:05:02] we don't have disagreements
[1:05:05] it seems like people love to hear when
[1:05:07] we have a disagreement because it makes
[1:05:08] them feel good that they have them
[1:05:10] we are human beings you know and we work
[1:05:13] it out and we forgive and
[1:05:15] god's given us these things of
[1:05:16] forgiveness repentance if we don't have
[1:05:17] forgiveness
[1:05:18] we don't have nothing that's why people
[1:05:20] end up in a divorce because you haven't
[1:05:21] tapped in
[1:05:22] to forgiveness the way that you should
[1:05:28] but you know we have these intense
[1:05:32] moments of fellowship
[1:05:37] let's just call it that
[1:05:40] and that's what him and his wife were
[1:05:41] having and his wife was broken down
[1:05:43] crying and the house was a mess and the
[1:05:45] kids are fighting
[1:05:46] and you know the story a million times
[1:05:48] but there's one place i love when
[1:05:49] brother brahm says
[1:05:50] he says i just he says we're little
[1:05:52] creators adam was a little creator
[1:05:54] and he starts to use this thing in the
[1:05:56] home a lot of people want to use it at
[1:05:58] church
[1:05:58] a lot of people want to use it for
[1:05:59] squirrels but but use it in your own
[1:06:02] marriage
[1:06:04] forget squirrels create their own your
[1:06:06] just start with the right atmosphere in
[1:06:08] your home
[1:06:09] get rid of the rock and roll music and
[1:06:11] bring some good holy ghost-filled music
[1:06:13] in
[1:06:14] change the music start there
[1:06:17] buy some lafontaine cds here today in
[1:06:19] the library and
[1:06:21] change the atmosphere
[1:06:25] don't remind squirrels and how do you
[1:06:27] write listen
[1:06:28] he did that to show us five times grace
[1:06:31] he displayed it to the bride five times
[1:06:34] hattie wright the little fish that's
[1:06:36] speaking to the storm you believers know
[1:06:37] what i'm talking about
[1:06:39] if you have questions about it if your
[1:06:40] visitors ask me after and i'll let you
[1:06:42] know what it is
[1:06:42] god displayed that not so we could go do
[1:06:44] those same things to show us
[1:06:46] the word is here it's been given back to
[1:06:49] the bride
[1:06:50] now he's in a situation at home is
[1:06:52] disarray he says he said this is the way
[1:06:54] he said it
[1:06:54] he says now lord i'm going to start
[1:06:56] praying for my wife
[1:06:58] under his breath not not openly not not
[1:07:00] like some men
[1:07:01] lord use me now i'm going to rebuke this
[1:07:04] spirit off of my wife
[1:07:08] woman come at your subjection right now
[1:07:11] and everything will be fine once you get
[1:07:14] this house clean
[1:07:16] everything will be all right
[1:07:19] you're laughing because but i have
[1:07:21] counseled guys that say
[1:07:23] if my wife would just keep
[1:07:26] her house
[1:07:30] this one guy said like sister so and so
[1:07:32] in the church and i go oh no you
[1:07:33] shouldn't have said that
[1:07:36] but sometimes if my wife would just keep
[1:07:38] this place organized
[1:07:39] our marriage would be fine and i said
[1:07:43] you are so wrong you are so wrong
[1:07:47] do you honestly think that the house is
[1:07:49] perfect all your
[1:07:50] marriage problems are over you are blind
[1:07:57] you create the right atmosphere it's
[1:07:59] like lord i rebuked that spirit
[1:08:01] children you know you don't fight fire
[1:08:03] with fire
[1:08:06] you don't fight temper with a temper
[1:08:09] those kids are not going to relate to a
[1:08:13] dictator coming in
[1:08:20] but the christ that's within us you have
[1:08:22] to correct things but
[1:08:24] he just starts he didn't start speaking
[1:08:27] things yet
[1:08:28] he started praying in his heart and one
[1:08:30] of the things he said he says lord
[1:08:32] i send my peace that's within me
[1:08:36] i send it to my wife right now
[1:08:41] in other words he has something in there
[1:08:42] he's got to tap into it
[1:08:44] because she needs it right now i send my
[1:08:46] peace to my children
[1:08:48] lord settle their spirits he goes in
[1:08:50] there but then he starts to talk to the
[1:08:52] kids
[1:08:52] get him playing nice together get
[1:08:54] everything resolved with them
[1:08:55] he's doing things but he's speaking
[1:08:56] things and he said something to his wife
[1:08:58] he said
[1:08:58] honey do you remember that little dress
[1:09:00] down that you liked in the store the
[1:09:02] other day
[1:09:04] he's not saying thus saith the lord
[1:09:06] you're going to be better
[1:09:11] he's speaking now listen friends i'm
[1:09:14] right here
[1:09:15] are you right here with me he's not
[1:09:18] necessarily
[1:09:19] quoting a scripture there but the holy
[1:09:21] ghost in him
[1:09:22] is make allowing him to say just the
[1:09:24] right thing to change the right
[1:09:26] atmosphere
[1:09:26] to the right hemisphere and it happened
[1:09:28] to be let's go down later and look at
[1:09:30] that dress and get that for you
[1:09:32] you sisters should be saying amen right
[1:09:34] now and getting behind me big time
[1:09:39] some of you sisters need a vacation
[1:09:41] brothers
[1:09:44] planet do it that's
[1:09:47] that's an order from your pastor
[1:09:51] can i get amens from the sisters thank
[1:09:52] you thank you
[1:10:00] i'm on your side there
[1:10:04] next sunday i'll be on the brother's
[1:10:06] side
[1:10:11] so he does he does he speaks things but
[1:10:16] they're not necessarily things that we
[1:10:18] could you know quoting scripture
[1:10:20] and we know we say the word sometimes
[1:10:22] but these are things that
[1:10:23] have the love of christ and the holy
[1:10:26] ghost behind them
[1:10:27] that are things that can change the
[1:10:29] atmosphere
[1:10:31] so you've heard that story many times
[1:10:33] maybe it's the first time you heard it
[1:10:34] today
[1:10:35] but all it is is the summary is as
[1:10:37] brother bram is teaching us
[1:10:39] you before the fall were created a minor
[1:10:41] god
[1:10:42] like adam you fell from that
[1:10:45] but calvary has redeemed you
[1:10:49] back to a son of god again and you
[1:10:52] stand as with the holy ghost now if you
[1:10:54] don't have the holy ghost you seek god
[1:10:55] say god i need it
[1:10:57] but that's the holy ghost you stand
[1:10:58] where adam stands
[1:11:01] to create worlds and go live on them
[1:11:06] the power have you heard it before the
[1:11:09] power of the holy ghost within a
[1:11:10] believer
[1:11:11] has enough power to create a new world
[1:11:14] and go live on it
[1:11:16] it's not my words that's the prophets
[1:11:18] how much does this have
[1:11:20] so we're being we're redeemed back we're
[1:11:23] coming back to eden again
[1:11:25] coming back to a place and if you think
[1:11:27] that's oh i get my new body someday
[1:11:29] that's when i'll change and
[1:11:30] move mountains and no no we're already
[1:11:33] redeemed
[1:11:34] beloved now are we
[1:11:37] the sons of god now we're the sons and
[1:11:41] daughters of god
[1:11:42] and with the holy ghost we stand there
[1:11:44] with the power to
[1:11:45] pull something out of somebody to speak
[1:11:47] the right the word in season
[1:11:49] to change atmospheres you do it when you
[1:11:51] come to service if you'll join in some
[1:11:53] people don't join in
[1:11:54] i don't mean to make you feel bad but
[1:11:55] you're not utilizing
[1:11:57] your if you say you have the holy spirit
[1:11:59] you're not using your holy spirit to
[1:12:00] create an atmosphere for god to really
[1:12:02] do something
[1:12:03] come in here and stand to your feet and
[1:12:04] worship god with all your heart
[1:12:07] you create the atmosphere brother andrew
[1:12:09] said you're you're activating you're
[1:12:11] you're using the gift that's within me

[1:13:02] to change situations but you know what
[1:13:04] he you know what adam had
[1:13:06] adam had by the power of god
[1:13:09] adam controlled things instead of
[1:13:13] things controlling adam some of you have
[1:13:15] heard me say that before
[1:13:17] what adam had is he controlled things on
[1:13:20] earth instead of things
[1:13:21] controlling him how many people and even
[1:13:24] believers we have
[1:13:25] everything's controlling them they let
[1:13:28] their finances get awry
[1:13:29] and their finances are dictating whether
[1:13:32] they come to church tonight
[1:13:34] sometimes whether they do this can't
[1:13:36] come because and so now
[1:13:38] finances emotions family emotions
[1:13:42] is controlling them and keeping them
[1:13:43] away from god
[1:13:45] but sons of god life doesn't control
[1:13:47] them
[1:13:48] money possessions family emotions
[1:13:51] families dads and moms do not control

[1:14:08] received so many testimonies from that
[1:14:10] service
[1:14:11] i'm not building up my ministry but god
[1:14:12] using us to speak how long will you
[1:14:14] mourn
[1:14:15] that is going everywhere and there's so
[1:14:17] many places that being ministered to
[1:14:18] because why
[1:14:19] i just asked the question mourning is
[1:14:21] real but how long will you let it
[1:14:23] control you
[1:14:25] it's time to move on can you say amen
[1:14:29] and i don't mean that disrespectful to
[1:14:31] your morning i say there comes a time
[1:14:33] that you have to move on with the lord
[1:14:36] you have to say
[1:14:37] is this thing controlling me i'm a son
[1:14:40] and daughter of god
[1:14:41] things are not supposed to control me
[1:14:43] i'm supposed to control things
[1:14:46] you have a choice can you say man i know
[1:14:49] i'm
[1:14:49] i'm going along here i don't even know
[1:14:53] they don't have a watch in here yet
[1:14:55] o'clock
[1:14:56] so it is
[1:15:00] if you let me read our text just one
[1:15:02] more time
[1:15:03] it's one o'clock my i haven't gone a
[1:15:05] long time if you let me read second
[1:15:07] corinthians 5
[1:15:08] and refer to it then then we'll find a
[1:15:11] place to close here
[1:15:12] i haven't been this long in a long time
[1:15:15] and next sunday i'll be really short
[1:15:18] don't laugh i have my uncles uh
[1:15:23] uncle jim passed away my dad's brother
[1:15:26] and they have a memorial next sunday up
[1:15:28] in chelsea for him
[1:15:29] i think it starts at 2. so more than
[1:15:31] likely next sunday
[1:15:33] will be short because i got scoot out of
[1:15:35] here and if the lord's still dealing
[1:15:37] i'll get one of these preachers and they
[1:15:39] can come up here and just continue on
[1:15:40] and i'll scoot out
[1:15:43] that was a joke second corinthians
[1:15:47] chapter five
[1:15:48] it's pretty bad when you have to tell
[1:15:50] people you were joking
[1:15:54] said to grace i told her is she here
[1:15:56] grace and hannah oh
[1:15:58] she always laughs at my jokes whether
[1:15:59] they're good or not
[1:16:02] complimented her the other day all these
[1:16:04] years as a little girl she's laughed at
[1:16:06] my jokes
[1:16:08] so our text said this second corinthians
[1:16:11] 5
[1:16:18] let me just hone in on verse 15
[1:16:21] 15. and that he died for all
[1:16:24] that they which live shouldn't
[1:16:27] henceforth
[1:16:28] not henceforth live unto themselves
[1:16:30] first thing
[1:16:31] two things they that
[1:16:35] live should not live if you want the
[1:16:38] creative power working in your life
[1:16:40] you don't live to yourselves let me word
[1:16:43] it the way lane
[1:16:45] worded it a few weeks ago it's not about
[1:16:48] you
[1:16:51] that's what that scripture says this
[1:16:53] isn't about you
[1:16:55] it's not about you don't live to
[1:16:59] yourselves
[1:17:00] from henceforth if you have this
[1:17:02] revelation you want to see the third
[1:17:03] pole
[1:17:04] working more don't live towards
[1:17:07] yourself next verse wherefore henceforth
[1:17:12] know we no man after the flesh so we
[1:17:14] learn two things out of these scriptures
[1:17:16] as a prerequisite to for creation or
[1:17:19] preparing for creation
[1:17:20] to bring these new creatures later on
[1:17:22] the scripture creeks of new creatures
[1:17:23] number one don't live to yourselves
[1:17:26] number two
[1:17:27] don't know any man after the flesh
[1:17:31] no selfishness can ever work in his
[1:17:33] kingdom it's about his kingdom it's not
[1:17:36] about you
[1:17:37] only thinking about yourself and your
[1:17:39] needs won't work never touching or
[1:17:41] speaking to someone else
[1:17:42] what a shame that is don't some don't
[1:17:44] even need anyone else
[1:17:46] some don't need to even speak to anyone
[1:17:48] else but yet if you have the holy spirit
[1:17:50] we can't be selfish with it we have to
[1:17:52] speak words of life to other people
[1:17:54] second of all knowing one's after the
[1:17:56] flesh will not work in his kingdom
[1:17:58] what is inside and what what is inside
[1:18:01] that individual
[1:18:02] and what can i say to pull more out of
[1:18:05] them we can bring out the worst in
[1:18:07] people by our words
[1:18:08] the flesh or we can bring out the best
[1:18:11] in people
[1:18:12] and what's living in their soul he's
[1:18:15] committed
[1:18:16] the last verse says he's committed to us
[1:18:19] if you just look at verse
[1:18:24] 11 the end of it verse 11.
[1:18:30] no that's not it verse 19.
[1:18:35] he hath committed unto us the word
[1:18:39] how many believe we have the word and
[1:18:42] it's not just the word but it's the word
[1:18:44] of reconciliation so
[1:18:48] something cries that out in us verse 20
[1:18:51] we are ambassadors for christ
[1:18:53] as though christ did beseech you by us
[1:18:56] we pray you
[1:18:57] in christ's dead be ye reconciled
[1:19:02] to god we have the word
[1:19:06] of reconciliation i want to live
[1:19:10] the way he wants me
[1:19:14] let's stand together
