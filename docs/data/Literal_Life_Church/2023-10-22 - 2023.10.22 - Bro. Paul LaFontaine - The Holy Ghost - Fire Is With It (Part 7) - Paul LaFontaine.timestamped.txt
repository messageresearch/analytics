[30:26] more important than this praise the Lord
[30:28] hearing the word of God and sitting at
[30:30] the Lord's feet what can you say to me
[30:32] Lord to help me in the times we live in
[30:34] and to be able to live overcoming life
[30:36] Matthew chapter 3 and verse 11 just one
[30:39] scripture and it's speaking about uh
[30:42] just John the Baptist speaking and
[30:44] remember John the Baptist had the spirit
[30:46] of Elijah on him and so he said this one
[30:49] statement that's been just really
[30:51] speaking to my heart this week I indeed
[30:54] baptize you with water unto repentance
[30:58] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[31:02] than I how many knows there somebody
[31:05] mightier than a prophet
[31:07] amen John said it all the prophets
[31:10] pointed to the Lord as the mighty one
[31:12] that's right they didn't point to
[31:14] themselves if they're a true Prophet I
[31:16] indeed baptize you with water under
[31:18] rembrance but he that cometh after me is
[31:20] mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[31:23] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you not
[31:26] with water he shall baptize you with the
[31:30] Holy Ghost and with
[31:33] fire in speaking about fire we'll go to
[31:36] the end time prophecies and that's in
[31:38] second Peter uh chapter 3 and just add a
[31:42] few things as we go to our day second
[31:44] Peter chapter
[31:48] 3 excuse me I believe that would be yes
[31:52] second Peter chapter
[31:55] 3 verse 7
[31:58] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[32:00] now by the same word are kept in store
[32:04] reserved unto fire against the day of
[32:07] judgment and predition of ungodly men
[32:10] verse 10 but the day of the Lord will
[32:12] come as a thief in the night in the
[32:14] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[32:16] great noise and the elements shall melt
[32:19] with fervent heat the Earth also and the
[32:22] works that are therein shall be burned
[32:25] up verse 11 seeing then that all these
[32:29] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[32:31] persons ought you to be in all holy
[32:34] conversation and godliness amen amen

[33:53] them then and in the days coming we
[33:55] commit that to you Lord we commit the
[33:57] service to you and the word that we've
[33:59] read Inspire it to our hearts through
[34:01] your Holy Ghost we pray in Jesus name
[34:04] amen amen God bless you you may be
[34:13] seated I have been asking the Lord to
[34:16] continue to help me
[34:18] to rightly divide this subject of the
[34:21] Holy Ghost that we've been speaking on
[34:24] and to keep it in the Simplicity that
[34:26] God in ended it for as I said at the
[34:29] beginning of this series the subject of
[34:31] the Holy Ghost has been really attacked
[34:34] by the enemy so much but I just want to
[34:37] say something positive you never need to
[34:39] be afraid of the term the Holy Ghost you
[34:42] never need to be afraid of the Holy
[34:44] Ghost it's something you never need to
[34:47] let Satan complicate it's never meant to
[34:49] be complicated it's actually if I could
[34:52] say it this morning the greatest miracle
[34:55] that can take place in a human human
[34:57] being is God's Own spirit being injected
[35:00] into your life so it's interesting that
[35:03] Satan would take the greatest miracle
[35:06] that can happen to you and complicate it
[35:09] and make it something that you would be
[35:11] afraid of that is not God's work that is
[35:15] the enemy's work but it is the greatest
[35:18] thing the greatest miracle that can take
[35:21] place in your life is that God's Own
[35:23] Spirit could come into human beings and
[35:27] if that is the greatest Miracle then I
[35:30] think that we should also uh be ones who
[35:34] if it's the greatest miracle that we
[35:36] should be also asking him for the
[35:38] greatest miracle if we don't have that
[35:41] great miracle we should ask him for that
[35:44] great miracle because he's given it
[35:46] whosoever will may come can you say amen
[35:49] and he's basically said if you ask if
[35:52] you knock if you persistently ask he's
[35:54] going to give you his spirit and so you
[35:57] have to ask but we ask with more
[35:59] fervency when we know that it's the
[36:01] greatest miracle that we could ask for
[36:04] now how many of the rest of us have a
[36:06] life that we ask God for miracles for
[36:08] other
[36:10] things we ask God for miracles now
[36:13] there's some people uh that don't
[36:15] believe in a supernatural God there's
[36:17] some people today that don't believe in
[36:19] God at all uh but there's some who
[36:21] believe in God but they don't believe in
[36:22] a supernatural God but there is a lot of
[36:25] people that that believe in God but I
[36:27] find it interesting that uh the worst
[36:29] thing about us sometimes is is the
[36:32] person who wants God and he wants God in
[36:36] his emergencies and he wants God to be a
[36:39] miracle working God and even will ask
[36:42] God I I need a miracle I I I need this
[36:46] but one thing that we don't want to do
[36:48] is we don't want to micromanage God and
[36:51] only be asking him for the Miracles that
[36:53] we want but the other miracles of the
[36:56] Holy GH ghost coming in us we back off
[36:58] and say I only want him that's
[37:00] micromanaging God that's saying I want
[37:03] only out of God what I want but I'm
[37:06] preaching to you that the greatest thing
[37:08] that you could ever ask God for is to
[37:11] fill you with his
[37:13] spirit and if you're going to ask God to
[37:15] perform a miracle for your life with
[37:17] sickness or anything else and you avoid
[37:20] the greatest Miracle then I'll tell you
[37:22] and I'll challenge you today there's
[37:23] things that you need to ask for that are
[37:25] even more important than miracles in
[37:27] your life God can do Miracles God heals
[37:30] the sick God heals cancer as he did our
[37:33] brother he's done it for years and he'll
[37:35] still be a miracle working God but I'm
[37:37] saying the greatest Miracle you can ask
[37:39] for is God putting his spirit in
[37:42] you somebody say praise the
[37:45] Lord this is what we should be asking
[37:48] for this is the greatest miracle that
[37:50] God could do and God is not your Aaron
[37:52] boy God is not your
[37:55] grandpa why do you say that because we
[37:58] live in a world that he's a grandpa to
[38:00] go you know how Grand you know Ellie you
[38:02] know how papa is uh you know how Papas
[38:05] and nanas are it's like they come to
[38:08] Papa and Nana to get things that they
[38:09] know their parents would not give
[38:14] them it's just they they they they're
[38:16] working the system and yesterday
[38:20] yesterday I I walk out out of my office
[38:22] studying and she's by herself out in the
[38:25] Florida room and she comes out that door
[38:27] she's by herself which is she don't need
[38:29] to be in there alone that's where all
[38:30] the candy
[38:31] is sure enough she comes through that
[38:34] door and she's munching on something I
[38:36] said what did you get
[38:40] [Music]
[38:42] nothing so and so but you know it's like
[38:45] to me it's like all you had to do is ask
[38:47] Papa and I'll get you one you don't need
[38:49] to steal it but people make God a
[38:55] grandpa people make God their Aaron boy
[38:58] and they only go to prayer did you ever
[39:00] notice that after 9/11 how spiritual the
[39:03] nation
[39:05] become people were putting there praying
[39:08] praying people that hardly have ever
[39:10] prayed now it's like we need God oh this
[39:12] is serious is it and you notice it only
[39:14] lasted for a few months and they go
[39:16] right back to the idolatry again they
[39:18] don't want God that what he can do
[39:20] inside of them they want a god they can
[39:23] call on for miracles but only temporal
[39:25] miracles only natural Miracles only
[39:28] miracles of healing I'm desperate I love
[39:30] desperation but it's not fair to God to
[39:33] only ask him for the things that you
[39:35] want when there's something that's been
[39:37] provided that would actually be powerful
[39:39] enough to change your life from the
[39:41] desire of sin and you haven't even asked
[39:45] for
[39:47] it what's the criteria for getting it
[39:49] the only thing I can see is when he said
[39:51] in the Book of John he said what father
[39:53] wouldn't give his children something if
[39:55] they asked he said what father wouldn't
[39:57] do that if it's good for them he said
[39:58] and our heavenly father he said all you
[40:00] need to won't he give the Holy Ghost to
[40:03] them that ask
[40:05] him praise the Lord greatest Miracle you
[40:09] could ask for in desperation is being
[40:11] filled with the Holy Ghost so rightly
[40:13] dividing this truth of the Holy Ghost
[40:15] and bringing it in Simplicity to the
[40:17] youngest child can understand it it's
[40:19] it's it's quite a challenge uh the
[40:21] experience of the Holy Ghost has
[40:23] suffered interpretations of men is
[40:25] swinging One Way making the Holy Ghost
[40:28] evidence an emotional workup and then
[40:31] swinging the meaning to another way
[40:32] where we just have dry-eyed mental
[40:35] exercises with no power in it at all
[40:37] that's the way he swings people's
[40:39] interpretation of the Holy Ghost even to
[40:41] this day even to this day Satan is still
[40:44] swinging the interpretation to Great
[40:46] workup of emotion and Swinging it over
[40:48] to intellectualism he's still doing that
[40:50] but hopefully as a minister and I'm only
[40:52] responsible for my church here I'm not
[40:54] trying to speak to the whole world
[40:56] unless there's a Hungry Heart to hear
[40:58] I'm responsible to my own church to
[41:00] teach the the balance of what the Holy
[41:03] Ghost is that true word births will come
[41:06] and people will know that they know that
[41:09] they know that they have this change
[41:11] within their life I want everybody here
[41:14] to know that you know that you know that
[41:16] you got it and you're going in a Rapture
[41:19] that's my desire as a pastor so I'm
[41:21] preaching for this purpose for my own
[41:23] church that we can have everybody I
[41:25] don't want to leave any of you
[41:28] behind I'm going and I don't want to
[41:30] leave you
[41:31] behind and the only thing I can see in
[41:33] scripture is that they're not going in
[41:35] there's foolish virgins there's wise
[41:36] virgins and the only difference that
[41:38] didn't go in is they didn't have the oil
[41:39] the Holy Spirit the only difference I
[41:41] want everybody to get the oil I want you
[41:44] to be filled with it I want every young
[41:47] person every child that comes to the age
[41:49] of accountability I want every one of
[41:50] you to be filled I don't want to leave a
[41:52] hoof behind I want to take all of you in
[41:55] the rapture oh but there's
[41:56] predestination and all the I know that
[41:58] but that's up to God I'm preaching the
[42:00] Holy Ghost so every one of you will get
[42:03] it I'm taking all of you in with me
[42:06] that's my desire praise the Lord so we
[42:09] we find then that we we we want to
[42:11] rightly divide that to a person knows
[42:14] that they know that they have it and
[42:16] this change has happening them and when
[42:18] it does there's no more doubts and
[42:21] there's no devil will ever move someone
[42:24] with that Revelation that they have what
[42:25] they need no devil will ever move it can
[42:28] you say Amen am this statement that John
[42:31] the Baptist makes with the spirit of
[42:33] Elijah on him reveals so much and I want
[42:36] to just settle down and elaborate on it
[42:38] for a minute in this series this
[42:40] statement John the Baptist makes in
[42:42] Matthew 3 that he says that I'm
[42:45] baptizing you with repentance I'm
[42:48] baptizing you with water I have my
[42:50] calling I have my office to you I have
[42:53] the spirit of Elijah and so I'm meant to
[42:56] forun the first coming of Christ I'm the
[42:58] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[43:00] Make Ready the way for the Lord I'm to
[43:02] prepare the way for the Lord and so I
[43:04] have my calling I have my office and
[43:07] that's to baptize you if you come and
[43:08] repent I'll baptize you with water but
[43:11] he says there's one coming after
[43:14] me there's somebody that's following
[43:17] this
[43:18] message this is my message and I'm
[43:20] leading you to it but I I will phase out
[43:23] someday and there's one coming that's
[43:26] mightier than
[43:27] me somebody say praise the
[43:30] Lord and I wanted to just elaborate that
[43:33] that that his John's Ministry was for a
[43:36] purpose it was to introduce but it was
[43:38] to lead to something else it wasn't to
[43:41] stay with the focus on John the Baptist
[43:43] it wasn't to stay with the focus on
[43:45] Elijah what I will do I I will do my
[43:48] position John says and I will fulfill
[43:51] this but I want to let you know there's
[43:53] one coming after me the message of
[43:56] Elijah was not complete without Christ
[44:02] coming the message of Elijah will never
[44:06] be complete until the one that comes
[44:09] after the message comes and incidentally
[44:12] comes in your life else the message
[44:14] means nothing until he the one that's to
[44:17] come after me John says he will come and
[44:20] I'm pointing you now to
[44:22] him the Lord amen it's happen really in
[44:26] every
[44:27] message every true Prophet there's
[44:30] something to
[44:31] follow Christ is to follow it's been
[44:34] said even by the prophet of this age
[44:37] there's a time that something moves from
[44:39] the prophet to the prophecy there's a
[44:41] transition that goes from the prophet
[44:44] and the emphasis on a prophet to the
[44:46] actual prophecy and guess who that gets
[44:48] fulfilled in not the prophet in his
[44:51] people but he said there's one coming
[44:53] after me I'm baptizing you with
[44:56] repentance but there's one it was
[44:57] repentance It Was preparing for
[44:59] something it was to forerun something
[45:01] and as it's been said in this hour by
[45:04] the angel of the Lord that as J John the
[45:07] Baptist forun and come before my first
[45:09] coming you and your message will forerun
[45:12] the second coming of Christ that's
[45:14] what's been said and we see the
[45:15] Vindication of that being fulfilled in
[45:18] in all the scriptural fulfillments of
[45:20] the last hour if God forerun his first
[45:23] coming with a messenger with the spirit
[45:25] of Elijah then he will do that in the
[45:26] second coming as well and we've seen
[45:29] that fulfilled but we've got to start
[45:30] looking as that but when I'm finished
[45:32] when I'm done I'm forerunning this and
[45:35] if if if we don't get to who's coming we
[45:38] can fall short of the purpose of the
[45:40] message we are not continuing to glory
[45:43] in a
[45:47] prophet we are not continuing to only
[45:50] glory and what God get in the prophet
[45:52] but the one Christ who comes after him
[45:57] this is what John is saying Christ will
[46:00] come after me there's one to come after
[46:02] me that's mightier than me he's greater
[46:05] than me and he's coming ever be watching
[46:09] because there's something coming after
[46:10] my message and it won't be another man
[46:13] it won't be another Prophet it'll be
[46:19] Christ there's a mystery of this
[46:21] throughout the
[46:23] Bible there was a transition from Moses
[46:25] to
[46:27] Joshua Joshua meets Jehovah Savior Jesus
[46:30] Jehovah savior there was a transition
[46:32] from the prophet Moses to Joshua Moses
[46:35] died Moses my servant is
[46:38] dead his ministry was as far as his
[46:41] physical Ministry it was over there was
[46:44] a transition from Moses to Joshua how
[46:47] many know there was a transition from
[46:49] Elijah to
[46:51] Elisha how many know that Elijah spoke
[46:53] the words and went off the scene and
[46:54] there was a young Prophet Mich that had
[46:56] to speak the same thing as what Elijah
[46:58] said and he didn't speak anything
[47:00] different than what Elijah said he spoke
[47:01] the same thing got in trouble was put in
[47:03] a prison for it because he spoke the
[47:05] same thing I feel that way sometimes the
[47:07] the messenger's gone but I'm still up
[47:09] here preaching things that he said and I
[47:11] get in trouble for it sometimes people
[47:13] buck up against it and all I'm doing is
[47:15] being a Micah I have no message of my
[47:16] own preach the word stay with what
[47:19] Elijah said can you say man and I get in
[47:21] trouble for it but that's my office in
[47:23] this hour to bring Christ to the people
[47:25] can say man to say the word that was
[47:28] said so that you can come into your
[47:30] inheritance and so the transition came
[47:32] from Moses to Joshua from Elijah to
[47:34] Elisha from elizar elizar eleazer to
[47:40] Rebecca who had an office of introducing
[47:43] her husband to her but when his job was
[47:46] finished it was about
[47:48] Rebecca somebody say praise the
[47:51] Lord From The Prophet to the prophecy
[47:54] and so when it does
[47:56] when it comes there's one that's going
[47:57] to follow me it when it does he says
[47:59] it's greater it's mightier now we don't
[48:02] think that because if we look at the
[48:03] powerful things that happen through
[48:05] someone else that's gone before us like
[48:08] the prophet of the sour or like others
[48:10] who have been before us when we think it
[48:13] what's mightier than that what could be
[48:15] greater than that but John said the one
[48:18] that's coming is
[48:20] mightier he's
[48:22] greater we don't think that we seem so
[48:25] so we see so much of the powerful work
[48:27] of Elijah but Christ Christ being in the
[48:31] people is greater Jesus himself said the
[48:35] works that I do shall you do
[48:38] also so there's even a work that was
[48:41] coming after Jesus Earthly Ministry that
[48:43] he would say the works I'm doing shall
[48:45] you do do also and many more works you
[48:48] shall do so it's a transition to go from
[48:51] there's something here but there's
[48:53] something coming there's something here
[48:55] but there's something coming and we must
[48:57] not miss what God is bringing after we
[49:00] must not miss who this person that's
[49:03] coming after the message is sent I will
[49:05] say that the third poll though not a
[49:08] public show is greater than the first
[49:10] and second
[49:11] poll anybody who knows that truth would
[49:14] raise your hand and said the f the third
[49:16] pole is greater and mightier than the
[49:18] first and second but yes the yet the
[49:20] first and second is so much more visible
[49:23] we would how can that be greater when
[49:25] this one's quiet and there's no public
[49:27] show but nevertheless it's more powerful
[49:29] it's more Mighty can you say Amen the
[49:32] third poll the word being in the people
[49:34] Christ being manifested in this bride is
[49:36] greater than the work of a
[49:39] prophet am I getting trouble for saying
[49:41] that but I'm saying what John said he
[49:43] that comes after me is mightier than me
[49:46] Christ being in the people is greater
[49:48] than Christ being in the
[49:51] Prophet come on now Christ being in the
[49:55] people
[49:56] sinb born people the power of God in
[49:59] their lives the signs following their
[50:01] lives is greater greater than God being
[50:04] in a
[50:07] prophet I said it a couple weeks ago
[50:09] Jesus was born without sin so it's not a
[50:12] real big thing that we see Miracles and
[50:15] God and the Oneness with God and him uh
[50:17] raising the dead and him doing yes he
[50:19] did that to display that's what God can
[50:21] do in a human being that's not a
[50:23] greatest Miracle is just his power could
[50:26] come in sin born people that would born
[50:28] in sin change their life fill them with
[50:32] the power of God and the works that
[50:34] Christ did you see it in their lives
[50:37] too Paradox is
[50:39] greater Paradox is something
[50:41] unbelievable yet it's
[50:44] true
[50:46] Hallelujah so in Elijah we could all sit
[50:49] around and be
[50:51] Spectators to what God's doing through
[50:53] Elijah and uh I'm not so sure that
[50:56] that's why the Pharisees heard about
[50:58] John out on the river so we'll check it
[51:00] out ourselves and John was baptizing a
[51:02] lot of sincere people that seen his
[51:05] office in the scripture so they're
[51:06] getting in the water and they're
[51:07] repenting they're being baptized and so
[51:10] he's doing it and then all of a sudden
[51:11] the Pharisees come up and he discerns
[51:13] their motive as a little hey they say
[51:15] well this is good we want to be baptized
[51:17] too and he could discern they didn't
[51:20] really come with a sincere heart they
[51:21] didn't come with
[51:22] repentance they didn't come to say I'm
[51:25] I'm leaving my Pharisee hood and I'm
[51:27] coming to the truth of this Prophet
[51:29] because he's going to leave me to the
[51:30] Messiah they're not saying that say we
[51:32] just want to be baptized because
[51:33] everybody else is being
[51:34] baptized he says you generation of
[51:40] snakes to religious leaders you
[51:44] vipers and you people think I'm a hard
[51:49] preacher people get squirmy and they
[51:51] don't like cuz I preach and I'm
[51:53] preaching on them I'm preaching on them
[51:54] and you know guil is charge yeah I'm
[51:56] preaching on
[52:01] you can I go to the scripture mandate
[52:03] for a Pastor Paul told Timothy and Titus
[52:07] preach the word reprove
[52:09] rebuke judgment begins of the house of
[52:12] God those that sin rebuke before All
[52:13] That Others May fear now don't get
[52:14] nervous I'm not going to call your name
[52:17] but a pastor has to get specific and
[52:19] reprove and rebuke or he's not doing his
[52:23] job if I compromise on that then I can't
[52:26] be your pastor anymore not a god-called
[52:28] pastor but there's going to be rebuke
[52:30] it's going to be hard but I always think
[52:31] if you read the message and you read
[52:33] what John's saying I'm not a hard
[52:35] preacher at all when he can say that
[52:37] have people have a religious spirit with
[52:39] all kinds of Pride I think I'm right I
[52:41] don't need to listen to you and he says
[52:44] you are like your father the
[52:46] devil you come from him and you're a
[52:48] Generation of Vipers I am not a hard
[52:52] preacher boy that Spirit of Elijah was
[52:55] on John so strong the same one was on
[52:58] the original Elijah that told Jezebel
[53:00] who she was and she didn't like
[53:04] it she could control her husband Ahab
[53:08] but she didn't like the man of God
[53:10] because she couldn't control
[53:14] him praise the Lord see whenever I walk
[53:18] away from this I'm just need to stick on
[53:19] my
[53:22] notes with Elijah you can be a spectator
[53:25] and all the Pharisees coming out I'll be
[53:27] baptized
[53:29] too and but John says you he says in one
[53:34] place Jesus says about John in John 5
[53:36] verse 35 John he was a burning and a
[53:41] Shining Light Jesus said this about John
[53:42] he was a burning and Shining Light and
[53:45] ye were willing for a season to rejoice
[53:49] in this light I don't know if you can
[53:50] pull that scripture up I'd like people
[53:52] to see it Jesus said this about John he
[53:54] was a burning and a Shining Light and ye
[53:57] were willing for a season I'm John 5:35
[54:00] you were willing for a season to rejoice
[54:04] in his light but I have greater witness
[54:07] than that of John for The Works which
[54:09] the father hath given me to finished the
[54:12] same works that I do bear witness of me
[54:15] that the father hath sent me I have a
[54:19] greater witness than that of John and
[54:20] you were willing to rejoice in his
[54:24] light but now there's a deeper
[54:28] light now there's a further
[54:31] light so what's he saying you can't
[54:34] continue to rejoice in the light of John
[54:38] the
[54:39] Baptist because there's greater light
[54:41] that's come is that okay with
[54:44] everybody Jesus said it himself so John
[54:46] says it's not about me it's the one
[54:48] who's coming after me I must decrease he
[54:51] must increase how many you know that
[54:52] John said that I must decrease now he
[54:54] must increase when we live in the glory
[54:57] of the Days of Elijah it's hard to
[54:59] believe we become a spectator because
[55:01] God's doing everything in the children
[55:02] of Israel were a spectator to what God
[55:04] was doing through the prophet Moses but
[55:06] when they come into the promised land
[55:08] you couldn't just wait Moses was gone so
[55:10] you couldn't just say where's Moses
[55:12] because if we can go to him and ask for
[55:13] a miracle we can watch God do a miracle
[55:15] through Moses Moses was dead no you go
[55:18] into the promised land pick up your
[55:20] sword and start fighting for your own
[55:22] land somebody say praise the Lord it was
[55:25] a transition to the prophecy being in
[55:28] you can you say Amen Christ in you
[55:30] taking your inheritance and going
[55:32] against the devil yourself the days of
[55:35] being a spectator sitting back in the
[55:37] congregation and watching everything I
[55:38] don't think we should be a spectator I
[55:40] think we should jump in ourselves and
[55:42] said whatever is happening here I want
[55:44] it all for
[55:46] myself you don't want to get to the
[55:48] other side and say I was a good
[55:50] spectator no you want to be into it and
[55:53] I Reed the same holy spirit that was
[55:55] being poured
[55:56] out but you can easily become a
[55:58] spectator when there's a prophet around
[56:00] but that but the one that comes after me
[56:02] he says that's what the one after the
[56:04] prophet is what we need even today the
[56:06] one that shows up after me is the one
[56:09] you should know by now the one who comes
[56:10] into your life oh blessed be the name of
[56:13] the Lord the one who's coming after me
[56:15] the one who comes into your life after I
[56:18] preach on Sunday morning here the one
[56:21] who meets you after this is the one
[56:23] who's essential it's not coming to
[56:25] church and hearing the pastor but the
[56:27] one that comes after me in your life
[56:30] this week that's the essential
[56:31] [Music]
[56:34] one it's not coming to church it's the
[56:37] one who goes with you after
[56:40] church you still with me everybody
[56:43] awake amen turn the air conditioner on
[56:47] it's too warm in here people falling
[56:49] asleep it's the one it's not coming to
[56:51] church it's the one who comes after
[56:53] church on
[56:56] now the one that comes after me so
[57:00] now he now I'll take it further the one
[57:03] that's coming after me is greater than I
[57:07] and he will
[57:08] baptize
[57:10] with
[57:12] fire the Holy Ghost and with fire so now
[57:15] I want to preach the rest of the time on
[57:17] this
[57:18] because here in the scripture when John
[57:22] says what's coming after me it's going
[57:25] to be the Holy Ghost him coming after me
[57:28] and he will baptize you not just in
[57:30] water not just under repentance but he
[57:33] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[57:38] Fire now it's God that put that in there
[57:42] he didn't just say I'll come and baptize
[57:44] you with the Holy Ghost because we know
[57:45] the Holy Ghost is unseen I've been
[57:47] teaching that Jesus said about the New
[57:49] Birth he said the spirit goes where it
[57:51] listeth and and and the wind it moves
[57:54] around and you can't see the wind from
[57:56] moving it comes and goes as it pleases
[57:58] and you can't tell you can't tell it you
[58:00] can see maybe something's happening but
[58:02] you can't actually see the spirit so if
[58:04] he only said the Holy Ghost he didn't
[58:07] just say the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[58:10] and with
[58:12] fire now we're going to find out today
[58:15] why did he say that it's perfectly in
[58:17] line with scripture as we go back if
[58:19] John had the spirit of Elijah on him
[58:21] then we go back to the original Elijah
[58:24] and we realized that The Showdown with
[58:27] God's people that were backslid Elijah
[58:30] said there's only one thing that's going
[58:32] to fix all this is that you pray to your
[58:35] God and I'll pray to my God and I'm
[58:38] going to show Israel the god that
[58:40] answers by
[58:43] fire is the only proof that he's in the
[58:48] midst so John had to say the Holy Ghost
[58:51] in fire because Elijah is all about
[58:54] calling the the fire
[58:57] down why well we're going to get into
[58:59] that because John is saying to settle
[59:02] he's like Elijah to settle this it it it
[59:05] took one thing for God's backsliding
[59:07] people Elijah said there's only one
[59:09] thing that's going to settle this this
[59:10] backsliding idolatry condition in God's
[59:13] Own people a God that answers by fire I
[59:17] am glad today to say no matter what you
[59:19] think about me I believe in a God who
[59:23] answers number one
[59:27] didn't a brother say that a few weeks
[59:28] ago darl W or somebody we're not just a
[59:30] God that we pray to but we we're we're a
[59:34] people that we're looking for an answer
[59:36] back from
[59:37] God we're a people that crav not just
[59:40] we're pulling up bringing up prayers all
[59:42] the time there's a lot of religious
[59:43] people do that but we're a results
[59:45] oriented people we're calling on God to
[59:47] answer now if he doesn't answer for 10
[59:50] years we're not going to give up we're
[59:51] not just praying to God and putting our
[59:53] prayers up there saying God I want want
[59:54] you to answer that prayer we believe a
[59:57] God that answers and we believe in a God
[1:00:00] who would answer by
[1:00:03] fire God's backslid people God Answers
[1:00:06] by fire only that and when we have let
[1:00:09] me just say it when we the reason John
[1:00:11] the Baptist said when he comes it will
[1:00:14] have to be the Holy Ghost with fire is
[1:00:16] because when you have a sin born nature
[1:00:19] that you're born with when you're full
[1:00:21] of can's desires for the world and
[1:00:24] worship when you're born to worship His
[1:00:26] Own Way I preached on that you're born
[1:00:28] with a Cain nature you're born with a
[1:00:30] serpent nature that desires the world
[1:00:33] but wants to worship your own way when
[1:00:34] you're born with that baptism and water
[1:00:38] will not be
[1:00:40] enough for the sin nature in your soul
[1:00:43] baptism and water is not
[1:00:46] enough repenting is not
[1:00:49] enough there's only one thing that does
[1:00:51] with a sin nature and takes care of it
[1:00:54] and that's the holy fires of God to
[1:00:56] consume
[1:00:59] it has to be a baptism by fire and
[1:01:02] that's why his messenger is saying that
[1:01:06] John is God's messenger but that's not
[1:01:08] enough we might need a fire oh I wish I
[1:01:11] could go through the scenario of the
[1:01:12] whole thing of Israel and uh you know
[1:01:15] their backsliding condition and Ahab and
[1:01:17] Jezebel's part that they played and all
[1:01:19] of that and finally God says that's
[1:01:20] enough there's a showdown and he says
[1:01:23] you bring your altar they brought
[1:01:24] they're out there they split it up just
[1:01:25] right they cried all day and all night
[1:01:28] they cut themselves which is
[1:01:30] incidentally part of idolatry worship
[1:01:33] there's spirits to cut
[1:01:36] yourself oh I should have get a greater
[1:01:38] amen than that all those spirits of
[1:01:41] tattoos and cutting yourself and
[1:01:44] loneliness and suicidal Spirits all goes
[1:01:47] with the other worship of the world all
[1:01:50] the traits that go with it when you're
[1:01:51] lonely you're opening yourself up to
[1:01:53] Spirit you'll never find that in the
[1:01:55] holy spirit of God you say will you find
[1:01:58] loneliness yeah you might be lonely but
[1:02:00] there's a God that can be your friend
[1:02:01] when you feel lonely it's only the devil
[1:02:04] that turns you to cutting to cutting
[1:02:06] yourself it's only the spirit of the
[1:02:08] world they're cutting themselves and
[1:02:10] they're laying on the altar all day long
[1:02:12] until Elijah even mocks them and says
[1:02:15] maybe your God's on vacation maybe he's
[1:02:17] taking a little rest because they
[1:02:19] weren't getting any results from that
[1:02:22] Elijah said your God is is not real
[1:02:25] because he didn't come with fire I'm
[1:02:26] calling for fire so then when they've
[1:02:29] done it all day Elijah says clean the
[1:02:31] whole altar redo it set it in place
[1:02:35] split up the sacrifice get it perfectly
[1:02:37] in order you know Elijah's Ministry is
[1:02:40] to set the right Altar for
[1:02:43] us Elijah Ministry this day you will not
[1:02:47] find any other message in the end time
[1:02:49] that sets the right altar of repentance
[1:02:52] God's order for the church was set by
[1:02:55] Elijah you try to come up some other way
[1:02:57] God sent his order through the church
[1:02:59] through Elijah you start to mess around
[1:03:02] with those things Church order dress
[1:03:04] whatever it is don't mess with it
[1:03:06] because Elijah is setting the order to
[1:03:08] come before
[1:03:13] God but all of it is a preparation of
[1:03:16] the Altar and you know what he did he
[1:03:18] said bring tons of gallons of water and
[1:03:20] pour it on the sacrifice and soak it
[1:03:23] down
[1:03:26] I love how God does things I'm going to
[1:03:29] make sure when the fire comes they'll
[1:03:31] know this is God soak this whole altar
[1:03:35] that there's no way that a fire could
[1:03:37] ever suck it up couldn't can't do
[1:03:42] it and you know what happens all of a
[1:03:45] sudden he came down and Israel
[1:03:47] repented this is the true God they
[1:03:49] should have known
[1:03:50] that but when you go for through years
[1:03:55] without God showing up in that way and
[1:03:57] you become backslid then it's only the
[1:04:00] Vindication of God answering by
[1:04:03] fire that's a distinction to the people
[1:04:06] this is God I'm backslid let the god
[1:04:11] that answers by fire he come and consume
[1:04:13] the sacrifice he consumed the altar that
[1:04:16] fire swallowed up everything that was
[1:04:18] there so you can know why John the
[1:04:20] Baptist says this messenger is not
[1:04:22] enough there's one to follow me we need
[1:04:24] a fire to answer back to our repentance
[1:04:27] and to burn out the old nature how many
[1:04:29] knows there needs to be a fire answer
[1:04:31] back to your heart of
[1:04:33] repentance when you repent praise the
[1:04:35] Lord for that when you're baptized
[1:04:37] praise the Lord for that but then you be
[1:04:38] saying God I want you to answer back by
[1:04:41] filling me with the Holy Ghost I need
[1:04:43] the god of fire to come in my life the
[1:04:45] Holy Ghost of fire so it's the one
[1:04:47] coming after me that will baptize with
[1:04:50] Holy Ghost and Fire Elijah should have
[1:04:52] said that when God put the those two
[1:04:54] things together of Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:04:57] it's telling us something and now I want
[1:05:00] to go deeper in this if you can still
[1:05:02] give me uh another three hours
[1:05:07] here praise the Lord when
[1:05:11] God puts those two things together of
[1:05:14] the Holy Ghost and Fire God put it
[1:05:16] together don't separate those two things
[1:05:19] but when he puts the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:05:22] together he's saying
[1:05:24] this Holy Ghost baptism is not just an
[1:05:28] intellectual
[1:05:31] thing it has fire with
[1:05:35] it not physical fire as it was in the
[1:05:37] days of el but the holy fires of
[1:05:41] God coming down on your
[1:05:44] life the Holy Ghost comes with fire
[1:05:47] we're going to find out why we need the
[1:05:48] fire because why it it's not just an
[1:05:52] intellectual stimulation
[1:05:55] it's not just an invisible thing and
[1:05:57] this is where God balances me out
[1:05:59] because I could just preach it all one
[1:06:01] way the Holy Ghost is just an in
[1:06:02] invisible thing you can't see I've been
[1:06:04] preaching on Mary she didn't feel
[1:06:06] anything when she received it but you
[1:06:07] know what Mary Wednesday night we were
[1:06:09] on it Mary she didn't feel anything
[1:06:11] there was no sensation when the when the
[1:06:13] conceived Christ in her there's no
[1:06:15] sensation but it wasn't long she could
[1:06:17] feel
[1:06:19] something wasn't long you could see it
[1:06:22] coming out
[1:06:26] you can't come to God and not have
[1:06:30] results happening in your life that you
[1:06:33] can
[1:06:37] see this fire is what he's talking about
[1:06:41] that it won't be just an intellectual
[1:06:43] thing the Holy Ghost will not just be an
[1:06:46] intellectual thing but fire will come
[1:06:48] with it and you know what when there's a
[1:06:50] fire around you're going to know it
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:55] right eventually if there's fire
[1:06:57] anywhere you're sitting peacefully in
[1:06:59] your house and you're sitting there
[1:07:01] quietly and everything's in Harmony and
[1:07:03] peace and Oneness with one another and
[1:07:06] everything's so nice you got your house
[1:07:07] so perfect but what changes everything
[1:07:10] is if a fire
[1:07:12] starts the fire's going to make you move
[1:07:15] you're going to smell it can you say
[1:07:17] Amen you're going to get nervous I got
[1:07:19] to save my house can you everything is
[1:07:21] quiet until the fire comes amen fire
[1:07:26] fire is going to do something when fire
[1:07:29] is present nothing will stay the same
[1:07:32] this I'm speaking about the Holy Ghost
[1:07:34] when the fire comes with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:36] nothing will ever be the
[1:07:37] same this was fulfilled in the upper
[1:07:40] room someone reported that to show what
[1:07:44] was happening with the apostles and the
[1:07:46] 120 in the upper room to show this
[1:07:49] person reported it I think it was Luke
[1:07:51] that reported what happened and got it
[1:07:52] from Witnesses who were were in the
[1:07:54] upper room he reported Luke or whoever
[1:07:57] it was to bring it in the word of God
[1:07:59] that when this happened in the upper
[1:08:00] room it was not some powerless religious
[1:08:04] Orthodox gathering in the upper
[1:08:07] room I'm going to say it again the Bible
[1:08:10] reports that that upper room was not
[1:08:12] some powerless religious exercise
[1:08:15] Orthodox Gathering but clothing tongues
[1:08:19] of fire set on each of
[1:08:21] them that's what your Bible says
[1:08:24] isn't it interesting that John says
[1:08:26] he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:28] and Fire and then when he reported it
[1:08:30] there were cloven tongues as a fire
[1:08:32] setting individually on each of
[1:08:35] them not physical fire but it's it's
[1:08:38] it's the fire of God splitting himself
[1:08:41] into 120 Believers and his fire his
[1:08:45] consumption of himself coming in the
[1:08:48] people oh I'm happy today I'm happy that
[1:08:51] I don't have a powerless religion I'm
[1:08:53] happy that the message is not a
[1:08:55] powerless religion I'm happy this Bible
[1:08:57] can come alive and the power of God can
[1:09:00] show up and change people's lives I'm
[1:09:03] happy that I can preach something that
[1:09:05] will kill the very nature of sin in your
[1:09:08] soul our God is a consuming fire and if
[1:09:12] you've got sin in that Soul this fire
[1:09:14] will burn it out of you you got desires
[1:09:17] for the things of the world still got
[1:09:19] them this fire will cleanse them out of
[1:09:22] your soul it will burn and consume every
[1:09:26] desire for the things of the world
[1:09:30] Hall it's not a powerless Holy Ghost it
[1:09:34] has fire with
[1:09:36] it and it so keeps burning in your life
[1:09:40] until even this day cuz I want it to
[1:09:43] keep burning in me it doesn't just burn
[1:09:45] out the the desire for sin it keeps
[1:09:48] burning stuff out of you I won't get
[1:09:50] into it now I'll get in a minute the
[1:09:52] bitterness the resentment the
[1:09:55] gossip the tongue that won't shut
[1:09:58] up you stay in the Holy Ghost it's going
[1:10:01] to keep burning things out of you that
[1:10:04] shouldn't be there because our God is a
[1:10:06] consuming fire I want him to burn out
[1:10:09] everything that's not of him everything
[1:10:11] that doesn't belong in this vessel may
[1:10:14] God's fire burn it out of my
[1:10:16] [Applause]
[1:10:18] life that's the prayer We Begin bring
[1:10:21] before God clothing tongues of Fire
[1:10:24] God is a pillar of fire how many knows
[1:10:25] God's a pillar of fire then he splits
[1:10:27] himself up into 120 Believers when fire
[1:10:30] is with it it means it will not be an
[1:10:32] uneventful event the pouring out of the
[1:10:35] Holy Ghost will not be some uneventful
[1:10:37] event or boring it's not going to be
[1:10:39] boring when a fire starts it's not
[1:10:42] boring when the fire if a fire was
[1:10:44] across the street just now and we're on
[1:10:46] the parking lot there's going to be
[1:10:48] gawkers we're going to be watching the
[1:10:50] fire fire gets everybody's
[1:10:52] attention
[1:10:54] everything's normal no this is just a a
[1:10:57] normal service and everything's quiet on
[1:10:59] the home front but when the fire shows
[1:11:01] up then we're all gazing upon and saying
[1:11:04] somebody's being set on fire here
[1:11:06] somebody's being chased God's in our
[1:11:09] midst and doing
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:14] something and we don't want the fire
[1:11:16] without the Holy
[1:11:20] Ghost I don't think you can truly have
[1:11:22] that you can work up the fire you can
[1:11:25] pretend it's there through emotion but
[1:11:27] when the fire's really there he's
[1:11:29] consuming what's not of
[1:11:31] God and it works in coordination it is
[1:11:34] the Holy Ghost it is together with the
[1:11:36] Holy Ghost so it's not a mental exercise
[1:11:39] it's a paradox it's something
[1:11:40] unbelievable if you want to pull that
[1:11:42] first quote up in a paradox something
[1:11:44] unbelievable but it's true it will be
[1:11:46] Supernatural not just natural when he
[1:11:48] comes it'll be Supernatural I believe
[1:11:50] that the same God that fell on the day
[1:11:52] of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar
[1:11:54] of fire and divided himself with
[1:11:56] clothing tongues among his people is
[1:11:59] here tonight it's the same God he was
[1:12:01] then he is today with the same Holy
[1:12:03] Ghost I know it's a paradox it cannot be
[1:12:07] explained emotions screaming crying and
[1:12:10] so forth cannot be explained but it's a
[1:12:13] paradox how God does it
[1:12:17] amen oh I shouldn't have done
[1:12:22] that all right hold on oh
[1:12:27] boy oh did I ever get lost you bring me
[1:12:30] back that first claw quote I I'm I'm
[1:12:33] still in Petersburg Michigan I do know
[1:12:37] that I so go to the next one see if it
[1:12:39] finishes after it's the Unseen God now I
[1:12:42] want you to notice it's the Unseen God
[1:12:45] dwelling in the human
[1:12:48] heart making himself visible now that's
[1:12:52] the perfect balance when you say Holy
[1:12:54] Ghost and Fire because the Holy Ghost
[1:12:56] you don't see it's the Unseen God
[1:13:00] putting himself in human beings you
[1:13:01] don't see that part but the fire you
[1:13:07] see it's the God doing a human making
[1:13:10] himself visible by vindicating his word
[1:13:13] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:13:17] forever God wants to show by these
[1:13:20] people getting the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:13:22] have to put nothing on you don't have to
[1:13:24] work it up you don't have to shout
[1:13:26] because somebody else is shouting I
[1:13:27] don't like all that pressure I don't
[1:13:29] like working up emotion I don't like any
[1:13:31] of it you never have to do that when
[1:13:33] God's dealing with somebody preach the
[1:13:35] word can you say Amen but you see it
[1:13:37] always go with God showing himself the
[1:13:40] same yesterday today and forever this
[1:13:42] isn't a powerless religion and what God
[1:13:44] does in you is not a mental exercise but
[1:13:47] it's to show Jesus Christ is the same
[1:13:48] yesterday today and
[1:13:50] forever that the works that I do shall
[1:13:53] shall you do also the young mother the
[1:13:56] older woman in the body of Christ some
[1:13:58] of the criticism sometimes to this is
[1:14:01] the woman are the women are under
[1:14:02] bondage and we believe that the women
[1:14:04] should keep silence in the churches
[1:14:06] that's to handle the word of God but we
[1:14:08] don't want them keeping silence how you
[1:14:09] can how can you keep a woman silent
[1:14:10] who's got the Holy
[1:14:12] Ghost we want them teaching the young
[1:14:14] people the the young girls we want them
[1:14:17] worshiping God I get texts from sisters
[1:14:20] encouraging me and giving me a scripture
[1:14:22] I'm not offended by at all because she's
[1:14:24] a member of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:26] she's not a lower species can you say
[1:14:28] amen and whatever influence in this
[1:14:29] message that tries to make them some
[1:14:31] lower species she's coars together with
[1:14:34] you
[1:14:35] brother as a as a vessel she's the
[1:14:37] weaker vessel but you together with here
[1:14:39] your coair together honor her that
[1:14:43] way God can use a woman to speak
[1:14:46] something can you say
[1:14:49] Amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday so
[1:14:52] it's something happen that's why we go
[1:14:54] back to birth is a
[1:14:57] mess birth is a
[1:14:59] mess all the sisters raise your
[1:15:03] hand birth is a mess it's not just
[1:15:07] this blue or pink hospital room and
[1:15:11] there's no blood and there's no
[1:15:13] suffering and there's only one sister
[1:15:17] that I know
[1:15:18] of that every time she would tell this
[1:15:22] and she's gone on with the Lord now she
[1:15:23] was in my church one 35 years ago and
[1:15:27] dear sister
[1:15:28] Phyllis sisters hated it when she
[1:15:30] described her two children she had
[1:15:33] because she's oh well well I didn't have
[1:15:35] hardly any pain the whole pregnancies
[1:15:38] and when I had the child it was just
[1:15:40] like a little
[1:15:43] tickle and the sisters would hate when
[1:15:45] she tells them how did you get by with a
[1:15:50] tickle but that's the only one I've
[1:15:52] heard and it's still when they come out
[1:15:55] it's a mess blood
[1:15:58] water life comes in the child most time
[1:16:00] they scream
[1:16:02] out there's noise can you say amen and
[1:16:05] we have a religion of many years that
[1:16:07] tries to bring birth to Shake in the
[1:16:09] preacher's hand or I go to Paula
[1:16:11] fontaine's church so I'm okay or I'm in
[1:16:13] the message am I okay a birth real birth
[1:16:15] when God's dealing with you it's a mess
[1:16:17] and you don't care what people think
[1:16:19] about you you're going to come to that
[1:16:20] altar you're going to give your life to
[1:16:22] God you may cry you may weep you may
[1:16:24] shout I don't know what you'll do you
[1:16:25] may not do anything but just God's
[1:16:27] changing your life and and the makeup
[1:16:29] can run down and get all over your
[1:16:32] face
[1:16:36] woo and there're snot flying everywhere
[1:16:39] sometimes and you got to get the
[1:16:41] kleenexes and you got to get it because
[1:16:43] why if the natural birth is a mess
[1:16:46] spiritual birth is a mess you're going
[1:16:48] to know something is happening to
[1:16:51] you don't ever make it some intellectual
[1:16:54] exercise don't ever make it something
[1:16:56] that I believe brother Brandon was a
[1:16:57] prophet and I'm good you're not good
[1:16:59] until you receive the Holy
[1:17:01] Ghost and when you do I'm not
[1:17:04] encouraging you to try to work up an
[1:17:05] emotion I'm just saying you'll know when
[1:17:07] something's changing you you know what
[1:17:09] something maybe not at that moment but
[1:17:11] you see your life has been changed
[1:17:13] there's something further than being
[1:17:15] baptized I'll tell you as a pastor
[1:17:17] there's a further experience than just
[1:17:18] being baptized and some people receive
[1:17:20] the Holy Ghost while they're being
[1:17:21] baptized I don't know I can't tell you
[1:17:23] when you receive it but you receive a
[1:17:25] change in your life that you say Amen to
[1:17:27] the word of God you're following the
[1:17:29] word and your desires on a soul level
[1:17:32] has been
[1:17:33] changed I used to desire to go to that
[1:17:36] and go to this place and go to this
[1:17:37] watch these movies and guess what
[1:17:40] something has got a hold of
[1:17:42] me and the greatest thing I desire is to
[1:17:45] be in his
[1:17:46] word not for worldly movies not for the
[1:17:50] sin of the world not for the flesh not
[1:17:53] for what the world produces something's
[1:17:55] changed in me that's
[1:17:57] right birth is a mess you know something
[1:18:00] is happening Holy Ghost is unseen you
[1:18:01] can't see it but you can see fire you
[1:18:03] can see what a fire is doing there's an
[1:18:05] unseen part of the Holy Ghost but
[1:18:06] there's a visible don't judge your
[1:18:09] evidence by the
[1:18:13] visible no amens to that time to take a
[1:18:19] drink there's a visible and there's the
[1:18:21] invisible don't judge that you got it in
[1:18:23] the evidence by the
[1:18:26] visible but the visible if Fire's there
[1:18:30] something's going to be
[1:18:33] visible don't judge your evidence by the
[1:18:35] visible don't ever think it won't be
[1:18:37] showing up though like Mary she didn't
[1:18:38] feel the conception but later she knew
[1:18:41] God had done something God was growing
[1:18:43] in her life so I just want to let you
[1:18:46] all know if you ask for the Holy
[1:18:48] Ghost the fire goes with
[1:18:51] it
[1:18:57] if you're going to ask for it don't be
[1:18:59] these specifics and say the fire goes
[1:19:01] with the Holy
[1:19:03] Ghost I might be too embarrassing no no
[1:19:05] no no no when it's getting a hold of you
[1:19:07] you'll take the Holy Ghost with the fire
[1:19:09] with
[1:19:10] it however it would make you act
[1:19:13] whatever it would make you do you'll
[1:19:15] leave family and friends Jesus said
[1:19:17] except you're ready to leave father and
[1:19:19] mother and he said hate father and
[1:19:20] mother it's not hate in the sense of a
[1:19:22] hate like we think but you have to be
[1:19:24] willing to leave family father and
[1:19:26] mother cuz family sometimes will lead
[1:19:27] you away from
[1:19:28] God when this experience happens it's
[1:19:31] not about the family being an idol
[1:19:33] anymore or them choosing for you it's
[1:19:36] you and God choosing for what the will
[1:19:38] of God is for your life is that okay
[1:19:41] with everybody if you want the fire with
[1:19:44] it if you don't want the fire with it
[1:19:46] you don't want it bad
[1:19:49] enough any Christian here that has his
[1:19:52] Spirit knows knows the fire goes with it
[1:19:54] can I ask for a show of hands that the
[1:19:56] fire came into your life any Christian
[1:19:57] who has the Holy Ghost knows that the
[1:19:59] fire goes with it it's going to burn the
[1:20:02] desire for sin out it's going to put you
[1:20:04] on fire for him boldness is going to
[1:20:07] come you're not afraid anymore to pray
[1:20:09] you're not afraid anymore to confess the
[1:20:11] word of God for this hour the disciples
[1:20:13] were afraid until they went to the upper
[1:20:15] room they were hiding they even denied
[1:20:18] Jesus they went away Jesus was left
[1:20:20] alone his own disciples that night all
[1:20:22] betrayed
[1:20:24] him but when they received the Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost they didn't forsake Christ they
[1:20:27] got the boldness to Proclaim Christ can
[1:20:30] you say am man when you get power in
[1:20:32] your life and that's what he said after
[1:20:33] you receive the Holy Ghost you shall be
[1:20:35] Witnesses power when you receive this
[1:20:37] the power of the Holy Ghost you'll be
[1:20:39] Witnesses unto me you're not afraid to
[1:20:41] be a witness it's not some shallow
[1:20:43] temporary emotion one thing one night
[1:20:45] and the feeling goes away that's not
[1:20:47] what this is this is the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:49] Fire but ye shall receive power after he
[1:20:52] comes upon you to be Witnesses unto me
[1:20:55] in Jerusalem in Judea in lamberville in
[1:20:58] in Seline in can you say Amen in
[1:21:01] Petersburg in Toledo of all places
[1:21:04] Toledo to be a witness in Toledo of the
[1:21:06] message of the hour listen he's made you
[1:21:09] Witnesses and that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] gives you power to do it's not for signs
[1:21:13] and wonders he'll have that but it's a
[1:21:15] power to be a witness it's a power to be
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:19] bold it's a power to not be afraid
[1:21:22] anymore
[1:21:23] right to talk about your
[1:21:28] God say I've got this thing I'm not
[1:21:32] ashamed of it something's taken over my
[1:21:35] life it's like fire Jeremiah said it's
[1:21:39] like fire shut up in my
[1:21:46] bones everybody
[1:21:51] okay preaching my heart I laid it all on
[1:21:53] the table to you this
[1:21:56] morning you don't think the devil fights
[1:21:58] me to hold back and saying these things
[1:22:00] he fights me tooth and
[1:22:02] nail but I'm gonna I'm GNA laying it on
[1:22:05] the laying it out before you
[1:22:08] tonight Lin it all and then tomorrow the
[1:22:12] family and I I always quote John Mir who
[1:22:17] was a great
[1:22:19] conservationist if we didn't have John
[1:22:21] Mir we wouldn't have a lot of our
[1:22:22] national parks including the Smoky
[1:22:25] Mountains he has a lot of good
[1:22:27] quotes I was reading some of them this
[1:22:29] morning but the my greatest quote that I
[1:22:31] use John Mir and this describes where
[1:22:34] I'm headed
[1:22:35] tomorrow the mountains are
[1:22:37] calling and I must
[1:22:44] go so I didn't just quote brother bradam
[1:22:47] this
[1:22:50] morning it's all out there I'm actually
[1:22:53] quoting John
[1:22:56] me fire what does this fire do one
[1:23:00] writer said the
[1:23:02] fire will refine you the fire will
[1:23:06] purify you the Holy Ghost Fire has a
[1:23:07] capacity to remove the draws in your
[1:23:09] life the iniquity the sins can you say
[1:23:12] amen he will keep your heart holy and
[1:23:15] clean and well keep you focused on God

[1:23:20] destructive part of the fire of the Holy
[1:23:21] Ghost is it in you is what makes it
[1:23:24] impossible for demonic activities to
[1:23:27] operate in the life of the carrier of
[1:23:29] the Holy Ghost the fire is what makes it
[1:23:31] possible that demonic activities can't
[1:23:33] rule in your mind and can't rule in your
[1:23:35] heart depression shouldn't be able to
[1:23:37] rule when you're asking for the fire to
[1:23:40] keep it
[1:23:42] away no demon can withstand you when you
[1:23:46] remain intoxicated with this kind of
[1:23:48] fire no family curse no family curse can
[1:23:53] stand against you when you're operating
[1:23:55] in this dangerous frequency of his fire
[1:23:58] there isn't any family hereditary thing
[1:24:01] cancer or whatever Pride there isn't
[1:24:05] anything that can bypass the fire
[1:24:07] burning it

[1:24:13] that does that work don't ever let the
[1:24:15] devil tell you this is a this is
[1:24:17] something in breaded me I'll never get
[1:24:18] rid of it don't ever settle for that

[1:27:00] there Grandpa and Grandma you better get
[1:27:03] that in check cuz he might interrupt me
[1:27:05] at the wrong time
[1:27:06] someday but I'm
[1:27:10] preaching fire anything fire touches it
[1:27:12] turns the other thing into fire is that
[1:27:15] right when fire touches wood it becomes
[1:27:18] the wood becomes fire when the fire of
[1:27:20] the Holy Ghost touches you it turns you
[1:27:22] to fire if I had one of those little uh
[1:27:24] things to start a fire what are those
[1:27:26] little torches lighter if I had one this
[1:27:29] morning it's just this little thing but
[1:27:30] do you realize do you realize that
[1:27:33] little thing that little fire you
[1:27:35] realize how how what it can
[1:27:37] consume if I were to get one of these
[1:27:39] with piece of paper paper going and
[1:27:41] within hours this whole building would
[1:27:42] be consumed by that little
[1:27:44] fire I might have a little fire god but
[1:27:47] it when it spreads out other places it
[1:27:49] can do a lot of
[1:27:51] thingsall
[1:27:52] see there's a good side to a fire too
[1:27:54] especially it's God's holy
[1:27:55] fire praise the Lord I I was out here in
[1:27:59] some of the land that I own by the old
[1:28:01] church I'm trying to sell it and uh I
[1:28:04] had to burn a bunch of brush and
[1:28:05] everything I didn't know I'd never done
[1:28:06] this before so I put the brush here it's
[1:28:08] the middle of summer everything's dry
[1:28:09] got that fire going and all of a sudden
[1:28:11] I realized it caught the side of the dry
[1:28:14] grass and it was moving slowly moving to
[1:28:19] both neighbors
[1:28:21] homes such a dummy I do things like this
[1:28:23] because you know I lived a very shelter
[1:28:26] life I don't know how to do properties
[1:28:29] Henry's Henry's done most of my work on
[1:28:31] my properties I can barely change a door
[1:28:32] knob I don't know about life I've been
[1:28:35] very
[1:28:36] sheltered and I stood there way too long
[1:28:39] until the neighbor say you better do
[1:28:41] something about that cuz it's not going
[1:28:44] to stop and it's headed to both
[1:28:47] neighbors homes so then I get in gear
[1:28:50] and get their hose over and get Buckets
[1:28:52] and did everything and thankfully
[1:28:54] stopped it but it wasn't stopping and so
[1:28:56] that's when you realize in the Holy
[1:28:58] fires of God I don't want it to stop in
[1:29:01] my life
[1:29:03] Josh brother Ken I don't want it to
[1:29:06] stop I'll take the Holy Ghost which is
[1:29:09] the evidence of saying Amen to the word
[1:29:11] of God but I'll take the fire with it
[1:29:14] am I'll take the fire with it because
[1:29:18] it's done only good to me can you say
[1:29:20] Amen now it's real easy to preach the
[1:29:24] fire as an outward thing of shouting and
[1:29:26] dancing and I believe that's part of it
[1:29:28] but the fire is going to go deeper it's
[1:29:30] going to consume whatever is in you
[1:29:31] that's not of him when it comes it don't
[1:29:33] stop burning after your desire for The
[1:29:35] World Is Gone most of you with the Holy
[1:29:36] Ghost my desire for the world is gone he
[1:29:38] burned it out but it don't stop burning
[1:29:40] things out of your
[1:29:44] life
[1:29:46] one when God comes he starts burning out
[1:29:49] the anger the bitterness the resentment
[1:29:52] towards
[1:29:54] others can you say Amen the resentment
[1:29:57] towards
[1:29:59] preachers the resentment towards people
[1:30:01] and
[1:30:02] congregations the the jealousy he burn
[1:30:05] he wants to burn that out of your life
[1:30:06] it's killing you the pride that you're
[1:30:08] better than others can't even connect
[1:30:10] with the body of Christ because you you
[1:30:12] think you're
[1:30:13] better the holy fires of God if you
[1:30:16] allow him will burn that out of
[1:30:18] you you're better than others you don't
[1:30:21] need others the gossip the no repentance
[1:30:24] everything that's not of God in our
[1:30:27] lives let the fire
[1:30:33] burn your kids can I have five more
[1:30:36] minutes your kids don't see the Unseen
[1:30:39] holy ghost in your
[1:30:40] life but your kids will see the
[1:30:45] fire kids I've got the Holy Ghost they
[1:30:47] gave it to me 20 years ago I've got the
[1:30:49] Holy Ghost you can say all those words
[1:30:51] but but the evidence of how you live
[1:30:53] every day and what the fire is doing in
[1:30:55] your life is the greatest evidence to
[1:30:57] your kids that he's a changed man amen
[1:31:00] they won't see the Holy Ghost they'll
[1:31:02] see what the fire of the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:04] doing in
[1:31:05] you because you're on fire for God or is
[1:31:10] this just an argument of spirit and a
[1:31:13] battle of quotes let me say something on
[1:31:16] my heart to all of us preachers let's
[1:31:18] let me preach on the preachers if we
[1:31:21] make this message a battle of quotes
[1:31:23] then we are lowering oursel with a lack
[1:31:26] of
[1:31:27] character we are never to go to battle
[1:31:30] with quotes with one another the Sheep
[1:31:32] see that and they're
[1:31:35] disappointed keep it holy keep it
[1:31:37] precious and let God interpret the
[1:31:40] quotes by bringing I read quotes all the
[1:31:42] time I read the Bible all the time but
[1:31:44] when we have an argument of spirit
[1:31:45] behind the quote we've left the
[1:31:47] character of the word I need to get
[1:31:50] greater amens than that that's for us
[1:31:53] that's for for for everyone else
[1:31:55] preachers and all to hear we have to die
[1:31:57] to our pride we have to die to things in
[1:31:59] our lives we have to die to become a
[1:32:01] fighter I don't want to be a fighter of
[1:32:03] the word I want to be a liver of the
[1:32:07] word help me Lord help me Lord not to
[1:32:10] become a fighter your kids don't see the
[1:32:13] Unseen Spirit but they see the fire do
[1:32:15] they see this message do your kids see
[1:32:18] this message as a law or a drudgery to
[1:32:21] you every
[1:32:26] day when they conclude it's just a it's
[1:32:29] a law it's a drudgery it's every day and
[1:32:32] they only see you shouting in church
[1:32:37] on yeah this is typical the which
[1:32:39] direction I
[1:32:41] go right where the rubber meets the
[1:32:46] road the fire is not just wanting to
[1:32:49] come and make you shout and dance
[1:32:52] but it's to bring character in our lives
[1:32:54] and to burn that which is not of
[1:32:56] God do they your kids see do my kids see
[1:32:59] the message is a law or
[1:33:01] drudgery or do they see it as a fire
[1:33:04] burning in
[1:33:06] you that's a love for God you're dying
[1:33:09] to your selfishness every day maybe
[1:33:13] that's why your kids don't
[1:33:15] respond what did they see in you and
[1:33:17] hear out of your mouth Through The Years
[1:33:20] blaming this one and blam bling this
[1:33:22] preacher and shame on us shame on me if
[1:33:26] this is what our kids see shame on
[1:33:31] us maybe they just seen this as just
[1:33:33] some membership in your life instead of
[1:33:35] a fire talking about the excitement of
[1:33:38] the word talk to other people all the
[1:33:41] time in church you can see them in
[1:33:43] church but this isn't just in church the
[1:33:45] kids can see they can see your heart
[1:33:48] sometimes it maybe not in it but
[1:33:49] hopefully they see your heart my heart
[1:33:51] is in this thing it's not just a duty
[1:33:53] but it's a fire of God I'm on fire for
[1:33:56] him and when I lose my fires a little
[1:33:57] bit I'm going to jump in and get on fire
[1:34:00] again I don't want to be lukewarm can
[1:34:03] you say Amen so now I'm bringing this
[1:34:05] down now to these quotes what I'm I'm
[1:34:06] directing in future home and is why I
[1:34:08] read in second Peter because do you do
[1:34:10] know that the same way God redeems this
[1:34:14] Earth which is a spoken word of God he
[1:34:16] will redeem it back to a millennium in
[1:34:18] Eden again the same way he works on the
[1:34:21] Earth is the same way he works on you
[1:34:24] right water blood and
[1:34:28] fire to bring you into a millennium
[1:34:30] dwelling place for God to dwell in so
[1:34:34] now the world to be redeemed for his
[1:34:35] redeemed person he uses the same method
[1:34:38] he baptizes in water after the ant antel
[1:34:41] livian destruction shed his blood upon
[1:34:42] it to sanctify that was through Christ
[1:34:44] and claim it see when Christ died at the
[1:34:46] cross it wasn't just to save you it was
[1:34:48] to save this Earth his blood Dro dripped
[1:34:50] out upon this Earth Satan tried to say
[1:34:52] I'll give it to you he said no sir I'll
[1:34:54] buy it remember Satan tempting Jesus
[1:34:56] I'll give you all the kingdoms of the
[1:34:58] earth he didn't need to Jesus didn't
[1:35:00] that I'm not going to take it from you
[1:35:01] I'm going to buy it with blood I'm
[1:35:03] buying it back amen he said no sir I'll
[1:35:06] buy it let me be Let It Be A Witness he
[1:35:08] was lifted up for an insign that he
[1:35:10] brought it he purchased this Earth next
[1:35:13] one but now it has to go through a
[1:35:15] baptism of fire Holy Fire from God which
[1:35:18] cleanses the earth and the heavens
[1:35:20] around it see the heart the heart has to
[1:35:23] be cleansed like that before God can
[1:35:25] come down in the person of the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost which is Christ coming down and
[1:35:29] dwell in the human heart it first must
[1:35:31] be repented it must be baptized in his
[1:35:34] name to show who it belongs to then it
[1:35:37] must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[1:35:39] and then the Holy Fire and holy ghost
[1:35:42] from God comes down and burns out all
[1:35:45] the desire of sin all the nature of the
[1:35:50] world the same way he burns It Off the
[1:35:53] Earth and the atmospheres and the demon
[1:35:56] power do you realize when we're in the
[1:35:57] Millennium when the Holy Fire comes
[1:36:00] someday and burns this it's not just
[1:36:02] burning this Earth but it's burning the
[1:36:04] atmospheres of demonic Realms that's how
[1:36:07] the fire of God goes prise the Lord when
[1:36:09] we walk back on this Earth because he's
[1:36:10] not going to annihilate the earth when
[1:36:12] Peter says Annihilation it's
[1:36:13] annihilating the sin and the atmospheres
[1:36:15] of sin it's the same Earth but when he
[1:36:18] burns it with his holy fire we step back
[1:36:20] on this same Earth again that's right
[1:36:23] it'll be cleansed you'll never hear The
[1:36:26] Whisper Of The Devil in your ear anymore
[1:36:29] accusing you
[1:36:31] anymore you'll never feel a lustful
[1:36:34] Spirit come to you to try to tempt you
[1:36:35] to lust those atmospheres have been
[1:36:38] burned out you'll never have the
[1:36:41] temptation to sin anymore it's all gone
[1:36:43] you'll never have a spirit of depression
[1:36:45] come around you anymore cuz it's all
[1:36:48] been burned by the Holy Fire of God
[1:36:50] those at are
[1:36:52] finished praise the Lord I want to be
[1:36:55] there don't you but I can tell you that
[1:36:58] the same ho of fire that will burn this
[1:37:00] Earth is working in your
[1:37:02] life that you can be free and you can be
[1:37:06] delivered and you can live above sin you
[1:37:10] can live protected from the things of
[1:37:12] the world and you can
[1:37:14] live in the power of God instead of
[1:37:19] Satan's defeat that's
[1:37:22] right and then the Holy Fire and holy
[1:37:24] ghost from God comes down and burns out
[1:37:26] all the desire sin all the nature of the
[1:37:28] world and now it's the baptism of fire
[1:37:29] cleanses it from all germs all its
[1:37:32] diseases all sicknesses even all the
[1:37:36] spiritual things which is by us too it
[1:37:38] does the same way to make it ready for
[1:37:41] God to dwell in in this great age that's
[1:37:44] to come the new Earth that's why every
[1:37:48] once in a while we have that same Holy
[1:37:50] Fire if it's cleansing diseases and
[1:37:53] sicknesses that's why brother Gustav
[1:37:55] sits here this morning healed by the
[1:37:57] power of God because the same one that's
[1:37:59] going to work on the earth someday
[1:38:01] cleansing diseases and sicknesses is the
[1:38:03] same one that can come to your body
[1:38:06] now Hallelujah next one so he redeems it
[1:38:10] in the same way he does his people he
[1:38:12] makes it all just the same his Plan of
[1:38:14] Redemption you become a new person amen

[1:38:19] joining church or trying to turn a page
