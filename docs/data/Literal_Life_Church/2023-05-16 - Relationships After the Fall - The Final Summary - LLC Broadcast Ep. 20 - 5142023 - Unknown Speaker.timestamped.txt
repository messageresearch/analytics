[3:12] Thessalonians chapter 2 now we beseech
[3:15] you Brethren by the coming of our Lord
[3:16] Jesus Christ
[3:18] and by the Gathering Together unto him
[3:19] that she be not soon shaken in mind or
[3:23] be troubled neither by Spirit nor by
[3:25] word nor by letters as from us as that
[3:28] the day of Christ is at hand let no man
[3:31] deceive you by any means for that day
[3:33] shall not come except there come a
[3:35] falling away first and that man of sin
[3:37] be revealed the Son of Perdition so
[3:40] we're talking about the last days here
[3:42] and it is a day of deception and it is a
[3:45] day that many shall fall away so they
[3:47] were they were with the truth but
[3:50] there'll be many fall away because it's
[3:51] an hour of deception that's that's
[3:54] prophecy for our time
[3:55] and then he speaks of the Son of
[3:57] Perdition who opposeth and exalted
[3:59] himself above all that is called God and
[4:02] in his worship so that he as God's
[4:04] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[4:05] himself that he is God remember you not
[4:08] that when I was yet with you I told you
[4:10] these things and now we know what
[4:13] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[4:16] his time for the mystery of iniquity
[4:18] death already work only he who now
[4:20] letteth will let until he be taken out
[4:22] of the way we see that the spirit will
[4:24] be exposed and we see the spirit is all
[4:26] the ways back in Paul's day as he's
[4:29] writing to the Thessalonians it's
[4:30] already beginning to work in the church
[4:32] verse 8 and then shall that Wicked be
[4:35] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[4:36] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[4:38] destroy with the brightness of his
[4:40] brightness of his coming even him now
[4:42] listen now even him who's coming is
[4:44] after the working of Satan with all
[4:46] power and signs and lying wonders lying
[4:50] wonders in other words we live in the
[4:53] age of Lies
[4:55] Satan is the father of Lies
[4:59] so one of the distinction is we live in
[5:01] the age of lies and he'll do lying
[5:04] wonders that's why the deception is
[5:06] there it'll be a lie it won't be the
[5:07] truth but it will be so close in the
[5:09] evening time it'll look like the truth
[5:11] look like the real thing but that's the
[5:13] most deceiving you can get is that it
[5:15] looks like the truth and yet it's a lie
[5:17] and with all deceivabeness of
[5:19] unrighteousness in them that perish
[5:21] because they received not the love of
[5:24] the truth that they might be saved so
[5:26] here's the problem is that you cannot go
[5:29] up against this lying age unless you
[5:32] receive something and what you receive
[5:35] is a love for truth
[5:38] how many want that this morning not not
[5:41] up here but a love and a desire I'm
[5:44] going to pursue truth I want to know the
[5:46] truth if you don't have that a love for
[5:49] truth then you'll be succumbed by lies
[5:52] but if God puts by the Holy Ghost within
[5:54] you a love for truth you're always going
[5:56] to be pursuing the truth
[5:58] whether it's in God's word or in
[6:00] relationships what I'm going to talk
[6:02] about this morning in relationships my
[6:04] bottom line is that if you love the
[6:06] truth and you're always pursuing truth
[6:08] even in relationships with one another
[6:10] you're waiting to get to the truth
[6:14] and for this cause God shall send them
[6:16] strong delusion because they won't
[6:18] receive the love of the truth some
[6:19] they'll he'll they'll come under a
[6:21] strong delusion that they should believe
[6:23] a lie so a lot of people will will
[6:26] swallow the lies because they haven't
[6:29] received the love of the truth and
[6:30] because actually God sends a strong
[6:32] delusion over them that they might all
[6:35] be damned who believe not the truth once
[6:37] again they didn't believe the truth but
[6:38] had pleasure and unrighteousness all
[6:41] right so that's that all looks pretty uh
[6:43] pretty dim pretty uh negative it's
[6:46] truthful but it's this is what is is
[6:48] happening
[6:50] but I thank God for the rest of these
[6:52] scriptures because he says verse 13 but
[6:55] we are bound to give thanks always to
[6:57] God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord
[7:00] because God hath from the beginning
[7:03] chosen you to Salvation through
[7:06] sanctification of the spirit and what
[7:09] belief of the truth
[7:11] I'm going to say the same thing that
[7:13] Paul said here I'm going to say I thank
[7:15] God every day that there's some
[7:17] individuals on the face of the Earth
[7:19] that are called from the foundation of
[7:21] the world and they in this age of lives
[7:24] are going to believe the truth where
[7:25] unto he called you by Our Gospel to the
[7:28] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[7:30] therefore Brethren Stand Fast and hold
[7:34] the Traditions which ye have been taught
[7:36] whether by word or by epistle people
[7:39] make traditions a bad word there's some
[7:41] good traditions and that's the word of
[7:42] God and he says in this hour you better
[7:44] hold fast to him
[7:46] don't move the boundary lines don't move
[7:49] uh don't don't try to change standards
[7:51] just leave them the way they are
[7:54] now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and
[7:57] God even Our Father which hath loved us
[7:59] hath given us everlasting consolation
[8:01] and Good Hope through Grace Comfort your
[8:03] hearts and establish you in every good
[8:06] work and work now this morning I feel uh
[8:09] that I'm going to try my best to
[8:11] summarize and finish up this little
[8:13] series that we've been on talking about
[8:16] relationships after the fall and the
[8:19] fall I'm referring to in the beginning
[8:20] when we fell and I've been talking a
[8:23] little bit about relationships that took
[8:26] that were different before the fall and
[8:27] everything changed after the fall I'm
[8:29] going to do my best to summarize uh that
[8:32] this morning and wrap it up you know
[8:34] it's one thing to talk about all the
[8:37] thing that we fell from and how it makes
[8:39] us Act and the serpent nature that we
[8:41] were born with and uh to to be real
[8:44] honest with you it's it's quite a burden
[8:46] on a minister and I lean a certain way
[8:49] I'm different than other ministers every
[8:50] minister is different but it's it's
[8:52] quite a burden when you go through a
[8:54] series that's laboring on things that
[8:56] are really bad things that we do and bad
[8:59] interactions with others and
[9:01] relationship those aren't really
[9:03] shouting Services you're not going to
[9:04] have people hanging from their actors
[9:06] and dancing and shouting and it's quite
[9:09] a burden and quite a labor on me to
[9:11] labor in those things because the
[9:13] response may not be quite as exciting as
[9:16] when you're talking about the joy of the
[9:18] Holy Spirit
[9:20] I can preach on the joy of the Holy
[9:22] Spirit and I will again
[9:25] but and but we tend to enjoy things that
[9:28] are that bring the joy of the Lord and
[9:30] the joy of the spirit and and uh and and
[9:32] that's all fine uh but when you're on
[9:35] these things just laboring and plowing
[9:37] with it it's more planting seeds and
[9:39] it's not the greatest shouting services
[9:41] and when we feel the conviction of the
[9:44] Holy Spirit rather than the joy of the
[9:46] holy spirit it's a bit different the joy
[9:49] is a lot more popular today can you say
[9:52] mine the the joy is a lot more popular
[9:54] and I enjoy the joy of the Lord but it's
[9:57] good to see sometimes where we're short
[10:01] where our shortcomings are
[10:03] because the devil actually he doesn't
[10:06] like things to be talked about where
[10:07] we're short he doesn't like that because
[10:10] if you get victories in the areas where
[10:12] you're short that's when the devil is
[10:15] really on the Run
[10:17] when people will come under conviction
[10:18] and say I've been a Christian for years
[10:20] but I'll tell you I'm really learning
[10:21] something from the Lord here that I need
[10:23] to I need to give this to the Lord I've
[10:25] given all this I've given my my times
[10:27] I've given my all these other things but
[10:29] I I realized an area today that I'm
[10:32] doing to my family or my children and my
[10:34] relationships or my relationship to God
[10:36] and I realized I recognize an area where
[10:39] I'm sure we don't come to church to get
[10:40] patted on our back or to hear all the
[10:42] good things we actually come to hear our
[10:45] short areas our shortcomings where we
[10:47] can say where we can yield more
[10:50] can I get an amen this morning that's
[10:52] that's really why we come to church and
[10:54] so it's good to see where we're short
[10:56] and not just where we're thriving and
[10:58] that way we can keep growing how many
[11:00] want to keep growing this morning we
[11:02] want to keep growing and a constant
[11:05] atmosphere of energy that says we are
[11:08] right we're right we're right a constant
[11:10] atmosphere all the time of that that
[11:12] we're right may bring pride and that we
[11:15] are uh the only ones that are right and
[11:18] that we can never be wrong
[11:22] I'm going to say it again if you only
[11:24] have an atmosphere where you're
[11:25] preaching you're right you're right
[11:27] you're good you're good you're the bride
[11:29] you're the bride and never correct never
[11:31] any correction in our lives it can tend
[11:34] to lead to a pride that people start
[11:36] thinking well we must be the only ones
[11:38] that are right and we could never be
[11:40] wrong I'm always right and that is a
[11:42] deception
[11:45] let me say this way so the kids can
[11:47] understand it some medicine that you
[11:49] take doesn't really taste well going
[11:51] down
[11:51] but it's what the doctor ordered and you
[11:53] need it
[11:55] can you say Amen
[11:57] so I'm gonna I'm gonna bring this down
[12:00] after these weeks and bring it down to a
[12:02] summary and talk about relationships
[12:04] after the fall and summarize Adam and
[12:06] Eve
[12:07] who enjoyed a perfect Oneness with God
[12:09] they had unhindered fellowship and love
[12:12] with God and love with one another and
[12:15] and and it was unhindered there was
[12:17] nothing there was no guilt there was no
[12:19] shame there was nothing there and so
[12:21] they had unhindered fellowship and love
[12:23] with God and love with one another and
[12:26] then we know that something uh come to
[12:28] break that nothing could break it before
[12:30] that something but something come to
[12:31] break all that up and all of it was lost
[12:34] all of this Oneness was lost and broke
[12:37] by one thing and that is a Eve listen to
[12:42] a lie Eve the how this all started was
[12:45] Eve listen to a lie she had the truth
[12:49] she had the word but then in a
[12:52] vulnerable state Satan comes and he
[12:55] whispers and says to her a lie or we
[12:58] could call it a false interpretation
[13:00] instead of the truth of God's word it
[13:03] was a false interpretation of what God
[13:06] Said and so so we might make the comment
[13:09] that you can't help but say it this
[13:11] morning but an ad that most of our
[13:14] troubles many times in life begin with
[13:17] misunderstandings with one another
[13:20] misinterpretations of things that get
[13:23] said many times our troubles begin with
[13:26] misunderstandings with one another or a
[13:28] situation being falsely interpreted to
[13:31] us or maybe uh uh reposted to us or
[13:35] resend to us if I had this morning I say
[13:38] something to brother Zach I'd say
[13:40] something to him or he said something to
[13:43] me to say something to brother Ike and
[13:45] so now if I became the messenger of that
[13:47] he would have to trust me to be a
[13:49] messenger because if he told me what to
[13:51] say to brother Ike in the process of me
[13:53] walking across the room and talking to
[13:55] him depending on my character that may
[13:58] not be get said exactly is how he meant
[14:02] it to say
[14:03] it's called misunderstanding it's called
[14:05] misinterpretation of what should have
[14:07] been said he's going to speak the truth
[14:09] but the messenger in between it is very
[14:12] important because it might get
[14:13] misinterpreted this happens every day in
[14:16] our life misunderstandings
[14:19] misinterpreted things things that are
[14:22] read wrong between one another can you
[14:24] say Amen how many believe that God that
[14:26] people today misunderstand God's word
[14:30] misunderstand what it means and because
[14:32] people haven't been taught right and the
[14:34] word peer purely presented to them they
[14:37] misunderstand God they misunderstand
[14:39] what God meant in the Bible they have a
[14:42] misinterpretation and a lot of that work
[14:43] is has Satan's hands on it because he's
[14:46] the misinterpreter of this word he did
[14:49] it in the garden he's still doing it
[14:51] today he's taking the truth of God's
[14:53] word which is pure has power in it will
[14:56] set you free but if it gets into Satan's
[14:59] voice and Whispers to you it's going to
[15:01] be misinterpreted and so thus we have
[15:03] the beginnings of the Fall was a lie
[15:06] that was told to Eve can you say Amen
[15:09] one one person said it takes two to
[15:12] speak the truth
[15:13] one to speak and another to hear
[15:17] Mark Twain said
[15:19] get your facts first
[15:22] and then you can distort them as much as
[15:24] you please
[15:27] now mostly in this life people don't do
[15:30] that they don't seek the facts first
[15:33] they go ahead and misinterpret they'll
[15:35] go ahead and read the story read what
[15:37] they hear right off the bat and it gets
[15:39] misinterpreted and like the old phone
[15:41] thing that we used to play as it goes
[15:44] around the room to everybody you say
[15:45] something and it's so funny and so
[15:48] sometimes embarrassing what it ends up
[15:50] at the end of the of the phone call all
[15:53] of you have done that we we did that as
[15:54] a kid it was very funny and it's amazing
[15:56] you're sitting right in front of one
[15:57] another and whispering things and it's
[15:59] amazing how twisted that story is at the
[16:02] end so most of us we we don't take the
[16:05] truth most of us we'll take hearsay and
[16:07] then we'll misinterpret it even more
[16:09] Mark Twain says get your facts first and
[16:10] then you can distort them but but say I
[16:13] would say Satan is more like this than
[16:15] anyone and that is that the truth is
[16:17] there the truth has been told the truth
[16:20] is present it's been spoken to his
[16:21] people and that's when Satan comes in
[16:23] and starts to misinterpret the word
[16:26] fellowship and Oneness with God and one
[16:28] another is broken by real simple things
[16:31] but they're important things and that's
[16:34] when the lies come in and start to
[16:37] unravel the truth that we already have
[16:41] that's when things begin to break up
[16:43] that's when splits happen that's when
[16:45] Fellowship is broken
[16:49] and then because everything broke away
[16:53] then we find Adam and Eve and Cain
[16:59] right away right away acting different
[17:02] than what they did living under the word
[17:05] and living under truth they started to
[17:07] act different
[17:08] and and when you live in truth and live
[17:11] in the protection of Truth there there
[17:14] is a protection with it there's a shield
[17:16] against the enemy when you just simply
[17:19] live in truth
[17:21] but if you live in truth and you trust
[17:23] it even sometimes when you don't fully
[17:25] understand it but this is from God this
[17:27] is truth I'm going to live in truth
[17:29] because truth truth is will always be
[17:32] truth because truth when it is believed
[17:35] it may look like Satan is going to
[17:37] trample upon it under his feet but truth
[17:39] will always Prevail and truth will
[17:41] always be truth and you're going to be
[17:43] Freer and you're going to be have more
[17:45] victories if you live in the truth and
[17:47] so now when all this happens
[17:50] now another nature is driving them
[17:53] because they listen to a lie we have the
[17:56] fall of Man and they listen to a lie
[17:58] about the truth now another nature and
[18:01] characteristics of that nature is
[18:03] driving them and they're acting all out
[18:06] of sort so I'm going to summarize now
[18:08] the first thing they started to do was
[18:10] Lie themselves because they're under the
[18:12] spirit of Satan which is lying
[18:15] they started to lie
[18:18] they started to blame one another
[18:20] instead of standing for one another
[18:23] they started to hide from the presence
[18:26] of the Lord
[18:27] instead of run towards the presence of
[18:30] the Lord could everybody agree that when
[18:32] they failed the best place that they
[18:34] could be running to is back into the
[18:37] presence of the Lord
[18:38] but our nature is to run from it to hide
[18:41] from it some people don't realize that
[18:43] when you're in trouble or you've made
[18:45] mistakes the best place that you could
[18:47] run to is the presence of the Lord the
[18:49] best place they can get to is the house
[18:51] of God where the gospel is being
[18:53] preached but you know what most people
[18:54] run from that that's the first thing
[18:56] that they strike off their list I ain't
[18:58] going there and I'm going to go hide
[19:00] somewhere I'm going to go I'm going to
[19:01] take a big vacation that's not the way
[19:03] to deal with your struggle with your
[19:05] relationship with God if they should
[19:07] have been running back to the presence
[19:09] of the Lord said God we've made a
[19:10] mistake here God have mercy on me and
[19:13] they started hiding their sin instead of
[19:15] bringing it to God they listen to this
[19:18] they took time and sowed they didn't
[19:21] just hide in the bushes they took time
[19:23] to sow fig leaves together I love how
[19:26] that's worded
[19:27] they they sowed the Bible says they
[19:31] sowed fig leaves and aprons together
[19:34] they did it together now they have no
[19:36] Oneness anymore but they're somehow
[19:38] found Oneness to sow fig leaves together
[19:43] so they got some Oneness but it's really
[19:45] strange because they're they're saying
[19:47] let's let's do this and and let's and
[19:49] and so they're they're gonna find
[19:51] creative ways to run from God and hide
[19:54] their shame and they're going to do it
[19:56] together in their marriage
[19:58] before they prayed together
[20:01] they Fellowship together in Purity they
[20:05] were openly in his presence and now they
[20:07] were finding ways to be out of church
[20:09] and hide from his presence
[20:12] all these attributes came out
[20:15] and guess what all of these attributes
[20:18] were not learned some of these
[20:20] attributes were almost immediate and
[20:23] they didn't Adam and Eve blaming one
[20:25] another they didn't go to classes
[20:28] before they started to manifest these
[20:30] attributes isn't that amazing I'm going
[20:32] to bring a point here that is this isn't
[20:34] about that where they were taught this
[20:36] is about something got in their nature
[20:39] that was wrong
[20:40] it was deep down in their nature now
[20:43] and so now everything that they started
[20:45] to manifest it wasn't taught they didn't
[20:47] take lessons in it they did Adam and Eve
[20:50] didn't go through a 10-week process to
[20:52] learn how to become fussing and arguing
[20:55] with another and fighting they didn't
[20:57] they didn't they didn't it was all
[20:59] within them to fight for their own way
[21:01] to stand for themselves instead of tell
[21:03] the truth to blame one another to lie to
[21:06] hide from God they weren't taught that
[21:08] it just came with this whole fall in the
[21:10] garden it was inherent in the nature
[21:13] they were lying and they didn't learn
[21:15] how to lie and the best example of that
[21:17] is a little two-year-old that uh when
[21:21] when they when they got a cookie and you
[21:22] know they did but there you go over to
[21:24] them and say did you steal that cookie
[21:27] and they're they're looking there and
[21:28] they're saying no I not mean and they
[21:31] have they have crumbs coming out of
[21:33] their mouths
[21:35] not me no Johnny did it Johnny did it
[21:41] me
[21:44] that kid did not go especially at two
[21:46] years old to a 10-week seminar and learn
[21:48] how to lie
[21:50] and yet they're such good ones at two
[21:52] years old already they're professional
[21:55] Liars
[21:56] they're better than some adults they
[21:59] know how to blame someone else and they
[22:01] know how to do this and deny it deny it
[22:03] there's no evidence of it then just
[22:06] breathe bring a show me I'm it's amazing
[22:09] and guess what they didn't learn it it
[22:11] comes in the nature that they're born
[22:14] with it's by Nature
[22:17] that these characteristics come so whose
[22:20] nature is it didn't come from God so
[22:22] this means that when they fell from
[22:23] truth and listened to a lie they took on
[22:26] not just did they fall and lose
[22:29] everything they had with God they took
[22:31] on a nature and attributes that can only
[22:35] originate in one and that's Satan
[22:39] himself
[22:42] he's the father of Lies
[22:45] he's a false interpreter of the word
[22:47] he's the blamer of someone else he's the
[22:50] gossiper he is jealous of a jealous
[22:54] wasn't wasn't Lucifer jealous of the
[22:57] position of God and wanted to be
[22:59] worshiped like God
[23:00] he's the originator of jealousy and he
[23:04] drew a per he had influence on the third
[23:06] part of the stars and so he rose in
[23:08] jealousy to take away the Kingdom from
[23:10] God even before we got to Earth he is he
[23:13] was he's jealous of God but guess what
[23:16] Satan's really jealous of he's a great
[23:18] jealousy over the believer's position in
[23:20] Christ he's been always jealous of your
[23:23] creative power because God gave creative
[23:25] power to Adam
[23:27] and when God gave that full power on the
[23:30] earth to Adam Satan was jealous of that
[23:32] Creed he's never had creative power can
[23:35] you say amen he never will have it he
[23:37] can't create anything he only perverts
[23:39] what God brings out he has always wanted
[23:42] access to that creative power and guess
[23:45] what God gives it to Sons and Daughters
[23:47] of God he gives creative power to you no
[23:50] wonder he's jealous of you and puts a
[23:52] believer in his position in Christ by
[23:54] the Holy Ghost he stands as a Powerhouse
[23:57] against the enemy and Satan says I can
[23:59] never have that so the only thing I can
[24:01] do is fight against this believer try to
[24:03] tell him they're not a Believer try to
[24:05] belittle them try to put them down try
[24:08] to find their mistakes and capitalize
[24:10] he's trying because he's jealous of your
[24:13] position in Jesus Christ
[24:16] you have something that he can never
[24:19] have and that's why Satan hates you it's
[24:21] not your personality he hates it's not
[24:24] your mannerisms it's not only it's what
[24:26] you have in God inside of you that's
[24:29] what he's jealous of if
[24:31] if the
[24:33] fall happened in the garden
[24:36] by believing a lie
[24:39] then it's pretty simple that the way
[24:41] back
[24:43] starts
[24:45] with believing the truth
[24:49] and I don't mean intellectually just
[24:50] saying yeah I believe this I'm talking
[24:52] about what he said in my text they need
[24:56] to receive the love the nature the love
[24:58] of the truth and because they wouldn't
[25:01] receive the love of the truth by the
[25:02] Holy Ghost then there come under a
[25:04] delusion to believe any lies
[25:07] but if the way out of Eden was believing
[25:09] a lie then the way back starts with
[25:11] believing the truth the truth receiving
[25:14] the truth the love of the truth when we
[25:17] get a true experience of the Holy Ghost
[25:18] and our soul we have received a love for
[25:21] truth what's the evidence of the Holy
[25:23] Ghost
[25:24] when we've received the Holy Ghost we
[25:27] receive a love
[25:29] for truth
[25:33] you love truth and sometimes it doesn't
[25:36] matter the vessel that it comes through
[25:39] that's besides the point
[25:41] it doesn't matter what Avenue it doesn't
[25:43] matter if you find that it's truth you
[25:46] love it you say Amen to it the evidence
[25:49] of the Holy Ghost is saying Amen to
[25:50] every word of God of this age
[25:52] by Nature it just it just it just says
[25:55] amen it may not say it here but it says
[25:57] amen
[25:59] amen
[26:01] evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not
[26:03] shouting it's not dancing that's the joy
[26:05] of the Holy Ghost you get stimulation of
[26:07] Revelation you're going to shout and
[26:08] dance sometimes or you may just cry not
[26:10] everybody will shout and dance is it
[26:12] okay to say that not everybody May shout
[26:15] and dance but you're gonna be there's
[26:17] gonna be a reaction emotionally when
[26:19] you're stimulated by the revelation
[26:22] but the evidence of having the Holy
[26:24] Ghost is not an emotion
[26:28] it is your Nature has been changed
[26:31] that you begin to love the truth even in
[26:36] family relationships you'll stand back
[26:38] and say now you've just said something
[26:40] to me against a brother you've just said
[26:42] something to me and then we heard
[26:44] something and a Believer will stand back
[26:46] because he's a lover of the truth he
[26:48] won't Jump Right In and say well tell me
[26:50] more I want to hear more
[26:53] I think we should stand back and say I'm
[26:56] going to wait and pray about this and
[26:58] make sure that we have the truth
[27:04] it's a love of Truth whether it's
[27:05] doctrinal truth whether it's in the
[27:07] Bible whether it is and even if it's the
[27:09] truth about your condition
[27:13] you're hiding something in your life
[27:17] and the truth comes and exposes you if
[27:19] you're hiding it and you're doing it
[27:22] then that's the truth
[27:24] and because you're a lover of Truth
[27:26] you'll find an altar and repent God I've
[27:29] been exposed
[27:31] it's the truth I'm backslidden I'm away
[27:33] from you
[27:35] you gotta admit it's true to get
[27:37] anywhere
[27:39] but then you grab onto the other truth
[27:41] that says he that he that asks
[27:43] forgiveness God's faithful and just to
[27:46] forgive him of his sins then you grab a
[27:48] hold of that truth if I repented God's
[27:50] forgiven me I'm going to stand and go on
[27:53] truth will be Vindicated every time
[27:55] truth will always speak for itself truth
[27:59] will always be truth
[28:01] it'll never change and it will show
[28:04] itself as
[28:06] truth thank you for watching our message
