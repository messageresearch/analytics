[0:00] in the needs of your life
[0:02] and my life and that's what we gather
[0:04] for we are hungry and we want to be fed
[0:07] from the word of god
[0:09] amen praise the lord
[0:11] if we missed any of our visitors feel
[0:13] welcome today and fellowship may god
[0:16] bless you
[0:17] i talked to a lady yesterday i know
[0:18] she's here she just lives down the road
[0:20] a little bit i don't know if joanie's
[0:22] here not got to talk to her on the phone
[0:24] yesterday and a lovely
[0:26] sister and she's wanting the home church
[0:29] and she has ms is that right brandon she
[0:32] has ms and so she's had a lot of
[0:34] complications and so we just want to
[0:36] maybe sometimes she can come and we'll
[0:38] lay hands on her anoint her with oil
[0:40] believe for her we've got a chance to
[0:42] share the message with her a little bit
[0:44] and she's asking what we believe here
[0:45] and what we stand for so let's just be
[0:48] praying for joni this morning
[0:50] colossians chapter 1 and verse 18 we'll
[0:52] pick up the scripture at verse 18.
[0:56] and he is the head of the body
[1:00] the church who is the beginning
[1:03] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:06] things
[1:07] he might have
[1:08] the preeminence how many believe that
[1:11] christ is the head of the body
[1:13] and when we have a a word picture like
[1:16] that then we realize that we look right
[1:18] to our own bodies and realize how many
[1:20] know that i can't have an action i can't
[1:23] move my hands unless they're first comes
[1:25] something and it goes very quickly from
[1:27] my head it receives instructions if it
[1:30] didn't have the head it would not be
[1:31] able to act correctly or act right or
[1:33] even act but because the head is
[1:35] attached to the body the head sends the
[1:37] instructions for everything else christ
[1:40] is the head of the church
[1:42] it is not our minds that we're
[1:44] interested in it's the mind of christ
[1:46] that we're interested in
[1:48] and as the body of christ comes under
[1:50] his preeminence then she functions and
[1:53] her actions
[1:54] all by the mind of christ by being led
[1:57] of the spirit
[1:59] and so something must happen and that is
[2:01] spiritually we have to come under the
[2:03] full preeminence of our head jesus
[2:06] christ he is the word can you say amen
[2:08] so we bring our lives under an authority
[2:11] we bring our lives under something we
[2:13] certainly you know if you think of the
[2:14] head you you think of a puppet a puppet
[2:18] has strings on it on its arms and on its
[2:20] on its feet and it a puppet is
[2:22] controlled it's not the mind of the
[2:24] puppet the puppet doesn't even have its
[2:26] own mind but it's it's controlled by
[2:28] someone else just moving the strings
[2:30] there's a lot of people in the face of
[2:31] the earth and some even within the
[2:33] church they're just puppets
[2:36] they haven't come under the headship of
[2:38] jesus christ yet they act on their own
[2:40] they do their own thing or they're
[2:42] controlled and influenced by someone
[2:43] else but the body of christ he is the
[2:45] head
[2:46] and it says the firstborn from the dead
[2:49] that in all things he might have the
[2:50] preeminence we'll get into that today
[2:52] for it pleased the father that in him
[2:55] should all fullness dwell and having
[2:58] made peace through the blood of his
[3:00] cross by him notice now to reconcile all
[3:05] things unto himself by him i say whether
[3:08] they be things in earth or things in
[3:10] heaven because we know some believers
[3:12] have gone on to the grave now gone to
[3:14] the other side some are on earth some
[3:16] are in heaven but i can tell you all who
[3:18] are predestinated in jesus christ
[3:20] because of calvary this reconciliation
[3:23] and bringing them back to the head is
[3:25] going to take place
[3:27] all that are in heaven all that are in
[3:28] earth all things in him will be
[3:31] reconciled so you notice now as the head
[3:33] comes down and the head becomes revealed
[3:35] to us and the the peace through the
[3:38] blood of the cross
[3:39] this this reconciling begins to happen
[3:42] in other words he's bringing all things
[3:44] back to himself the body that got
[3:47] detached in the fall of the garden the
[3:49] body that god detached is going to be
[3:51] reconciled to the head again
[3:55] i say whether they be things in earth or
[3:57] things in heaven and you that were
[3:59] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[4:02] mind by wicked works that was you
[4:06] maybe you today
[4:08] but you who were alienated and enemies
[4:11] where in your mind by wicked works yet
[4:14] now have he reconciled i mean he can say
[4:17] that i was that was that i was an enemy
[4:20] in my mind i was alienated a lot of was
[4:23] because i was in my own mind not the
[4:25] mind of christ i did my own thing i
[4:27] functioned by my own deal
[4:30] but now
[4:31] he's reconciled us in the body of his
[4:33] flesh through death to present you
[4:36] holy
[4:37] and unblameable and unpreprovable
[4:41] in his sight
[4:42] amen let's pray heavenly father we ask
[4:45] for your anointing upon the word of god
[4:47] today
[4:48] we are
[4:49] humbly coming before it
[4:51] the most sobering thing lord that takes
[4:53] place is when your presence comes in and
[4:56] begins to break the word to us lord it
[4:58] just makes our hearts broken lord the
[5:01] possibility of what you could speak
[5:03] under your anointing we need you lord we
[5:05] are hungry today and want to be fed lord
[5:08] i just pray you bless these children
[5:10] that have come and sang for us today

[5:15] refreshed our spirit as a pastor and
[5:18] the the pastor's wife just refreshed our
[5:20] spirit to see their hearts and lord to
[5:22] look at them we look at the future we
[5:25] see your future church we see lord the
[5:28] the potentials of you filling them with
[5:30] your holy ghost

[5:34] matter how much the world goes awry the
[5:36] church moves on

[5:39] for you saying that the singing that
[5:41] they're blessed it refreshes our spirit
[5:43] today lord thank you for this lovely
[5:45] congregation and the gift that they've
[5:47] given us and their love and support and
[5:49] their texts and emails and their their
[5:52] their their eyes lightening up lord by
[5:54] the word of god preached and just their
[5:57] hunger for it it's a it's a challenge to
[5:59] us lord and it's a wonderful thing we
[6:01] just pray you'll bless today lord and be
[6:03] with us strengthen us may you get in
[6:06] this word now and be present among us
[6:08] in jesus name
[6:10] amen amen shake somebody's hand before
[6:12] your seed and greet them in the name of
[6:14] the lord
[6:16] praise the lord
[6:23] a couple sundays ago when we were here
[6:25] we spoke on the
[6:27] finding god's authority
[6:30] and coming under god's authority
[6:32] authority has been a subject that has
[6:34] been abused and misused by satan and
[6:37] authority itself has been misused
[6:40] and so when you take subject of
[6:41] authority then we realize that it's
[6:43] people back off from it people are
[6:45] afraid of it and i mentioned to you as
[6:47] well we live in a culture where
[6:49] lawlessness will take over they don't
[6:50] want authorities over them they don't
[6:52] want anybody telling them what to do and
[6:54] the spirit of law and lawlessness is
[6:57] taking our country over
[6:59] and so we're not a part of that we're
[7:01] not a part of the the children how many
[7:03] know the bible says this refers to the
[7:05] children of disobedience
[7:07] so we live in the world that are
[7:09] children of disobedience to the word of
[7:11] god but we're not the children of
[7:13] disobedience we are the children of
[7:15] obedience
[7:16] to the word of god to his headship and
[7:18] to his authority we're not afraid of
[7:20] god's authority when author the
[7:22] authority of god first came into my life
[7:24] by the holy spirit i wasn't afraid of it
[7:27] thankfully i had been taught in a home
[7:28] that wasn't something to be afraid of
[7:30] authority wasn't abused in my home you
[7:32] come from a lot of homes sometimes that
[7:34] authority was abused authority was not
[7:36] used in the right way now we have
[7:39] governments and and different
[7:41] things in the government they're abusing
[7:42] their authority taking the liberties
[7:44] away from people but you see now uh when
[7:46] i come up i wasn't afraid of it so the
[7:49] authority being the word of god when god
[7:51] said something even though my flesh
[7:52] didn't like it i submitted to it i put
[7:54] my life underneath it because i didn't
[7:56] have a lack of trust i have to preach to
[7:59] it to people today that have a lot of a
[8:02] lack of trust in obeying authority they
[8:05] have a lack of trust and authority and
[8:07] i'm sensitive to that that authority has
[8:10] been hurt or ruined in your life or
[8:12] misused in your life used in the wrong
[8:14] way but let's never dump the baby out
[8:16] with the bath water let's never dump out
[8:19] the fact that god's authority is latin
[8:21] it's not like man's authority
[8:23] god's authority is what you want to
[8:25] bring your life under can you say man
[8:27] and the body needs to come under the
[8:29] head jesus christ because you'll find no
[8:32] greater protection and love can you say
[8:34] amen you'll find no greater blessing
[8:37] because the thing about the head coming
[8:39] to the body and connecting with it is
[8:41] that everything that's in the head flows
[8:44] down into the body of christ
[8:47] that's a benefit that's not like the
[8:48] headship of this world authority of the
[8:50] world where the boss is the boss and you
[8:52] get pushed along the side just come
[8:54] under my head chef that's not like this
[8:55] at all everything that let me say it
[8:58] this way
[8:59] all that was in god he poured into
[9:01] christ and all that was in christ he
[9:04] pours into the church
[9:08] now i want to be under authority like
[9:10] that
[9:11] because he gives his church authority as
[9:14] she comes under his authority
[9:16] and she functions not by her own mind
[9:18] but truly by the mind of christ
[9:21] where do we find that where do we find
[9:24] the this where do we find
[9:26] what he wants done with the word what
[9:28] we find it in the word of god
[9:31] we find it in the word for the day
[9:33] we find it in present truth
[9:35] and
[9:36] so now
[9:37] i want to go deeper into the subject of
[9:40] finding this authority coming underneath
[9:41] it
[9:42] i might be on the subject for a few
[9:44] weeks because authority is such a big
[9:46] subject
[9:47] but in this scripture we read this
[9:49] morning colossians chapter one it's just
[9:51] another phase of looking at god's
[9:53] headship and us coming underneath it
[9:56] i just want to open this as a foundation
[9:58] and just say now
[10:00] how many know that redemption is not
[10:02] finished yet
[10:05] redemption is not finished yet and even
[10:08] though in christ eyes at the cross
[10:11] he could say because of calvary
[10:13] it is finished
[10:16] as far as he was concerned the price had
[10:19] been paid the bride had been bought back
[10:22] can you say man she was in the pawn shop
[10:24] he paid the price to buy her back
[10:27] but there's a process to redemption and
[10:30] and paying the price of redemption
[10:32] is only the first phase of redemption
[10:35] paying there if you look back in the
[10:36] book of ruth you find phases of
[10:38] redemption ruth came under uh the power
[10:41] of redemption and she come as a moabite
[10:44] girl she didn't know anything about the
[10:45] ways of god and yet she is a type of the
[10:48] bride would come into naomi's family and
[10:50] then she would come over into israel
[10:52] she'd move into bethlehem and hopefully
[10:54] i get the chance to talk about her
[10:55] because as ruth made decisions to get
[10:58] closer and closer as she come closer and
[11:01] closer to the the ways of jehovah and
[11:03] she embraced them and she made a
[11:05] decision naomi your god will become my
[11:08] god
[11:09] naomi remember this is a moabite woman
[11:11] they worshipped all kinds of gods but
[11:12] she made a decision she said i don't
[11:15] want those other gods i want your god
[11:17] your god will be my god your ways will
[11:20] be my ways
[11:21] your lifestyle will be my lifestyle even
[11:24] though it's contrary to the world it's
[11:26] contrary to the moabites i want this and
[11:29] she made a decision i want your god i
[11:32] want his ways i want jehovah
[11:35] i want what jehovah's prophets say what
[11:37] did what did the prophets of jehovah say
[11:40] and i want to listen nobody else was
[11:41] saying that but ruth said i want and
[11:43] guess what when she made a decision to
[11:45] come underneath that then she come under
[11:48] something i'll call the power of
[11:50] redemption
[11:55] i'll tell you
[11:56] that's the place you want to be
[11:59] you may not be all where you need to be
[12:01] today but i'm going to hopefully show
[12:03] you that you can bring your life under
[12:05] the word for this hour and become
[12:07] submissive to it and just little steps
[12:10] like ruth did little steps towards that
[12:14] brings you under the power of redemption
[12:17] and so i'll just say that we're not
[12:19] finished with redemption yet why truth
[12:21] is she every step she did i don't want
[12:23] to preach it now it's for the end i've
[12:24] got it at the end of my notes every step
[12:26] she made guess what brought her closer
[12:30] to boaz
[12:33] she made a little step and she and then
[12:35] but it crossed and one day boaz was in
[12:37] the same field that she was in she got
[12:39] to talk to boaz
[12:41] type of christ
[12:43] and then she got to be around boaz and
[12:46] then she humbled herself to come under
[12:48] and put the under his feet and just laid
[12:50] at his feet all night right next to boaz
[12:54] she's getting closer and closer to
[12:56] christ and guess what she became the
[12:59] wife
[13:00] of boaz
[13:02] to bring full redemption to naomi and
[13:04] her whole family
[13:07] but she wasn't fully redeemed until he
[13:09] paid the price so boaz paid the price
[13:11] but it wasn't just paying the price he
[13:13] had to be willing to pay the price he
[13:14] had to he had to have all he had to be a
[13:16] near kinsman he had to have all these
[13:18] qualifications we have a near kinsman
[13:21] jesus christ he's the closest kinsman
[13:23] that can redeem us can you say mine and
[13:25] he went to calvary and he paid the price
[13:28] for our redemption
[13:31] but redemption is not finished yet just
[13:33] because the price price was paid jesus
[13:35] said it is finished but as far as you
[13:37] and i we're still under the power of
[13:39] redemption this word this message what
[13:42] god has sent in the last days as we come
[13:44] underneath it it's got a power of
[13:46] redemption that's raising us up
[13:49] you see brother paul are you sure not
[13:50] we're not through with your redemption
[13:52] well one reason i know that i'm not in
[13:54] full redemption this morning is that i'm
[13:56] still living in this body that's 55
[13:59] that's getting
[14:00] old and he promised in his redemption
[14:03] that he would give me a new body
[14:06] so redemption isn't finished yet this
[14:07] morning
[14:08] aren't aren't some of you old people
[14:11] gray-haired people
[14:13] bald people
[14:15] glad that we're not done with redemption
[14:17] yet
[14:19] all right not too i i know i'm glad i'm
[14:22] looking forward to about a 21 year old
[14:24] body
[14:26] a theophany body
[14:28] a word body
[14:31] see where is he going i'm writing the
[14:32] scripture
[14:34] i'm writing the bible
[14:37] and so now
[14:38] we are in a process
[14:40] of redemption
[14:42] if you know your bible then it he pays
[14:44] the price
[14:45] and then he
[14:46] in the last after 2000 years of church
[14:49] history we pick up revelations 5
[14:52] and we have this book of redemption with
[14:53] this book that's closed and sealed with
[14:55] seven seals it's the book of redemption
[14:57] well in the end time it's closed it's
[14:59] not open even though the price was prey
[15:02] our lamb had to come and take that book
[15:04] of redemption because that's the title
[15:05] deed that adam lost in the garden
[15:08] he had the title deed to this earth he
[15:10] had the power he had the authority and
[15:12] he lost it all and so now it it went
[15:14] back into the hands of the title deed to
[15:16] this earth went back into the hands of
[15:18] the original owner and here in
[15:20] revelation 5 we pick up the end time
[15:22] where now that book has got to be
[15:23] unsealed and that book of redemption has
[15:25] to be given back to the people of god
[15:27] again we're not finished with redemption
[15:29] but i can tell you we're awful close to
[15:32] close to the final stages
[15:34] because i can tell you the lamb has
[15:36] broke the seals
[15:38] not six of them all seven of them
[15:41] how many believe that this morning
[15:43] and since we know that he's broke the
[15:45] seals the book of redemption
[15:47] redemption is finishing
[15:50] our names are in that book of redemption
[15:53] he'll reveal the names in the book of
[15:54] the judges see brother paul is this
[15:56] happening why we get together and preach
[15:58] and different ministers come through and
[15:59] they're preaching the end time message
[16:01] they're preaching the seals open they're
[16:02] preaching all the seals this is an open
[16:04] book we're not under a closed book of
[16:06] redemption anymore revelations 5 it was
[16:08] opened by our lamb can you say mine
[16:11] sent to his prophet on earth this he
[16:13] broke the seals threw him to a seventh
[16:15] angel messenger on earth blasted them
[16:17] before the people and now all this
[16:19] preaching that you're hearing at the end
[16:21] time is not just to give you another
[16:22] feeling or sensation it's to show your
[16:25] name in the book because when john seen
[16:27] his name in the book he must have seen
[16:29] his name in there because he said i
[16:31] started to shout i started to glorify
[16:33] god i started to praise the lord
[16:36] all of heaven all of earth everything in
[16:39] creation heard me saying worthy is the
[16:42] lamb that was slain
[16:44] it was shouting time in heaven we know
[16:46] there's a shouting time in heaven when
[16:48] someone gives their heart to the lord
[16:49] and repents
[16:50] but in revelations 5 everything began to
[16:53] shout and worship and glorify god not
[16:57] because of salvation not that
[17:00] that was one thing but now because
[17:03] redemption
[17:06] we could we could shout all morning over
[17:08] salvation
[17:10] you ought to be happy that you're saved
[17:12] this morning by calvary
[17:14] but now we come to the end time and the
[17:16] book of redemption is open and he says
[17:18] all of creation heard me shouting all of
[17:20] a sudden now we realize the book of
[17:22] redemption the seals are taken off the
[17:24] book we can look and see our name in the
[17:26] book
[17:27] see our place in the scripture
[17:29] say listen like the harlot said i'm not
[17:31] a harlot i'm a daughter of god
[17:33] [Applause]
[17:38] he said brother branham said the day i
[17:40] realized i wasn't the son of charles and
[17:43] alibranum
[17:44] naturally he was but he said i realize
[17:46] i've seen my name i've seen my place in
[17:49] the word and i was not the son of
[17:51] charles and elle branham i'm a son of
[17:53] god
[17:54] true identity comes out
[17:57] so listen if there was worship because
[17:59] he was the creator in revelations one
[18:02] and two they worshipped because thou art
[18:04] worthy
[18:05] excuse me you've created all things they
[18:07] were worshiped because of creation but
[18:09] now the worship increases and the
[18:11] worship is even deeper because the seals
[18:14] have been broken and we can see our
[18:16] names in the book so i wanted to say
[18:17] that's when we get together and hear the
[18:19] preaching of the last days it's not just
[18:21] church it's not just getting together
[18:23] fulfilling a duty it's not just coming
[18:25] here and punching a clock and saying i
[18:27] went to church today when we gather
[18:29] under the revealed word of god and the
[18:31] seals are open christ is revealing your
[18:34] name in the book christ is showing your
[18:36] true identity
[18:38] [Applause]
[18:39] this isn't just time to just fill a
[18:41] religious duty
[18:43] this is the time to see our place
[18:46] lift our hands
[18:48] and say thou art worthy o lord
[18:53] the worship goes deeper than a sensation
[18:58] all due respect a lot of worship in
[19:00] pentecost is just a sensation
[19:03] it's just an emotion and i'm not against
[19:05] that i love to be emotional but our
[19:07] worship needs to go deeper than just a
[19:09] carnal outside sensation and i felt
[19:12] tingles up my arm
[19:15] you need to find your life in christ to
[19:16] live an overcoming life you need
[19:18] authority against the enemy
[19:21] not in church you need authority when
[19:23] you're dealing with the devil out there
[19:26] come on you got to agree with me how
[19:28] many wants more authority of god to deal
[19:29] with your devil how many has a devil how
[19:31] many has the same enemy i'm fighting
[19:34] come on you got at the very basic you
[19:36] got to raise your hand said i got the
[19:37] same enemy the devil
[19:40] and i need the authority of jesus name
[19:42] to go against him
[19:47] so
[19:49] we have to
[19:51] examine that we're in the process
[19:54] it's not that we're going to church or
[19:56] we have a bible or that we have message
[19:58] books
[19:59] it's that he is the word
[20:02] and he is wanting to get the preeminence
[20:06] in all things
[20:07] that's where we're at
[20:10] it's not just that you have a bible this
[20:12] morning it's not just that you go to
[20:14] church
[20:15] what is god doing the head
[20:17] has come down
[20:19] the word
[20:20] the mind of christ has come to us
[20:23] and it is the word
[20:25] and he is
[20:26] working to get preeminence in your life
[20:29] in all things
[20:31] what does preeminence mean i'm glad you
[20:34] ask
[20:38] preeminence means
[20:40] superiority in rank
[20:43] it means precedence it means he gets the
[20:46] precedence above all things
[20:49] that he is before all things it even
[20:53] says that in the bible he is before all
[20:55] things and by him all things consist
[20:59] and in the amplified that says he is
[21:01] before all things and by him all things
[21:05] are held together
[21:07] this whole universe is held together by
[21:09] the word of his power
[21:11] his authority holds it all together and
[21:13] if you bring your life under his
[21:15] preeminence then that's the only way
[21:17] your life is held together
[21:21] better stay right here
[21:24] he should be before all things in your
[21:27] life
[21:29] the word should be before all things
[21:32] and by him all things are held together
[21:36] because if you trust in your insurance
[21:39] or if you trust in your doctor
[21:41] if you trust in your government if you
[21:44] trust in your new business adventure
[21:47] it's you know me and my wife we do some
[21:49] business adventures and i'm always
[21:51] saying well we'll pray about this we'll
[21:52] get some advice this week we're asking
[21:54] advice about something we're going to do
[21:56] and i said you know what i just said to
[21:58] the lord i said i'm we're doing this and
[22:01] we pray we're in your will lord guide us
[22:03] and lead us but all of that to me is
[22:05] just fragile
[22:09] there's nothing secure in
[22:10] it so your life your business ventures
[22:14] your new the entertainments that you
[22:15] follow the fashions of the world if
[22:17] that's what you're it's fragile it's
[22:19] falling apart
[22:21] can you say man i called the doctor i
[22:22] was sick on thursday i called i just had
[22:25] a cold don't worry
[22:27] i'm not going to spread anything
[22:28] i'm i'm six feet from brother tony here
[22:32] i said i got a cold i i hadn't called
[22:34] her in six or eight months and i called
[22:36] i said
[22:37] can i get in and see the doctor today
[22:39] and see if this is any kind of infection
[22:41] you know she said
[22:42] she said the doctor dr smith
[22:45] is not seeing
[22:46] any sick patients in her office right
[22:48] now
[22:52] so i just got quiet and i just thought
[22:54] about that then
[22:56] just think about it
[22:57] my doctor's not seeing any sick patients
[23:00] in her office at this time
[23:05] is she seeing healthy patients in her
[23:06] office has thing changed that much
[23:10] what kind of crazy world are we living
[23:12] in
[23:14] i'm sick i'd like to see my doctor well
[23:16] she's not seeing sick patients in there
[23:19] maybe over the phone and goes on and on
[23:21] and on so i just said you know what
[23:23] we'll get to it another time
[23:25] hopefully i survive
[23:33] by him
[23:35] all things are held together
[23:37] and i believe in doctors and i'm
[23:39] thankful for doctors i'm thankful for
[23:41] the medicines that's been given can you
[23:42] say amen i'm thankful for what science
[23:45] provides for us but at the end of the
[23:46] day
[23:47] we have a healer we have a god we're
[23:50] under his headship
[23:52] and if we depend too much on this world
[23:56] and not on the one that's actually
[23:58] holding this world together and holding
[24:00] everything together our lives
[24:03] he needs to be before all things
[24:06] and by him he needs to be the one
[24:08] holding your life together can i get an
[24:10] amen this morning that's where our life
[24:13] has got to come
[24:14] he is before all things he's before any
[24:17] decisions he's before anything that you
[24:19] do he is consulted he's our consultant
[24:22] he's our counselor he's our guide he's
[24:24] our shepherd he's our leader can you say
[24:27] amen he's our financial counselor he has
[24:30] to be everything to us
[24:33] now god can god use human flesh and god
[24:36] would skin on yet he can use men to give
[24:38] counsel we seek counsel on different
[24:40] things but we cannot put our trust in
[24:42] man
[24:45] it has to be
[24:46] in our head
[24:49] and a wife does that to the headship of
[24:51] her husband it's not about you know
[24:53] you're under my authority
[24:55] no if she's the right authority she says
[24:57] i bring my life how many times i've seen
[24:59] wife say and there's this when they say
[25:02] this i know there's a man that's a real
[25:04] leader because she says i'm happy to let
[25:07] my husband lead our lives and i'm
[25:10] praying for my head and i'm gonna be
[25:12] guided by the decisions god gives him if
[25:15] he asks my input i'm gonna give it
[25:18] because god can work speak through both
[25:19] of us we understand that but she said
[25:21] i'm happy to be under the protection of
[25:23] my husband that god's leading him and i
[25:25] will follow that lord
[25:29] don't hear that too much today
[25:32] but there's something about the true
[25:34] authority of god
[25:36] that we don't have to fight against
[25:38] we just say lord
[25:40] that's actually a safe place to be
[25:42] that's actually a place that i don't
[25:44] have to make all the decisions
[25:49] let him make them amen
[25:51] i've also i've also had wife say you
[25:54] know if he messes up he's in trouble
[25:56] with god not with me
[26:01] but you just it's just released
[26:06] trust
[26:07] and obey
[26:09] so if that's true in a right kind of
[26:11] marriage relationship it's true in our
[26:13] relationship with the lord there's a
[26:15] trust and obey and there's a coming
[26:17] underneath it and so now preeminence i
[26:19] didn't finish the meeting yet going very
[26:22] slow today but preeminence is support
[26:24] superiority and rank precedence he's
[26:26] before it's it's preeminence that's he's
[26:28] above
[26:30] and i like this that's the priority of
[26:32] place in other words he has first place
[26:35] christ
[26:37] is the principal theme
[26:39] of this bible
[26:42] how many say amen
[26:44] christ it's not just stories
[26:47] christ is revealed in every scripture in
[26:49] this bible christ is the mystery of god
[26:51] revealed from the old testament to the
[26:54] new testament christ is revealed in
[26:55] every scripture
[26:57] if you don't see christ in it go back
[26:58] and read it again
[27:00] christ is the center of this bible he's
[27:03] the principal theme of this bible so now
[27:06] he needs to become the principal theme
[27:09] of our lives
[27:12] so we can say we're under headship and
[27:14] under his leadership but then so this is
[27:16] the last meaning of preeminence
[27:18] superiority of power
[27:20] or influence
[27:22] that's the word i want to use
[27:23] superiority in other words
[27:26] he is before he is above me
[27:29] he is my headship and he has preeminence
[27:32] in all things he has supported a
[27:35] superiority of power or influence in my
[27:38] life he's the greatest influence in my
[27:40] life
[27:42] he has the greatest powerful influence
[27:46] on my decisions on what's in my mind
[27:49] what's in my thoughts what's in my life
[27:52] how i raise my children how i conduct my
[27:54] finances whatever i do
[27:57] he is the main influence from my
[27:59] decisions
[28:01] i wanted to get into my personal
[28:02] testimony today because when god filled
[28:05] me with the holy ghost at 16 then then i
[28:07] began to realize i needed to attach
[28:09] myself and feed on as much as i can the
[28:12] word of god for the hour first of all i
[28:14] devoured my bible the whole you know one
[28:16] of the evidence is that you have the
[28:17] holy ghost one of the i know there's a
[28:20] lot of different evidences including the
[28:22] evidence of speaking in tongues which
[28:23] the the pentecostal world has taught as
[28:25] being the initial evidence i i beg to
[28:27] dis differ a little bit because i think
[28:30] it has to be deeper than just speaking
[28:31] in tongues we believe in speaking in
[28:33] tongues i told the sister yesterday we
[28:34] believe in all nine spiritual gifts here
[28:36] but we never take one of the nine
[28:38] spiritual gifts and make it the evidence
[28:40] of the holy ghost if god is working in a
[28:42] church you'll see those nine spiritual
[28:44] gifts working in the church
[28:46] but the evidence of the holy ghost is
[28:48] that he that happened here to hear what
[28:50] the spirit is saying to the churches
[28:52] your heart connects and say i believe
[28:54] that by the holy ghost i believe what
[28:56] he's saying to the church in other words
[28:59] the evidence of the holy ghost never
[29:00] denies any of this bible
[29:03] because the holy ghost wrote this bible
[29:05] you can have a cursed person speaking in
[29:06] tongues and divine denying some of the
[29:08] word ain't going to happen the holy
[29:10] ghost always says amen to every word of
[29:13] god
[29:14] including the message of the last days
[29:17] so my testimony was is when i be i
[29:19] devoured my bible because with my holy
[29:22] ghost came this incredible craving and
[29:25] vacuum for the word i wanted to hear the
[29:28] word now i had been raised in church but
[29:30] you see when you receive the holy ghost
[29:32] it changes how you're hearing it
[29:36] i heard the message i heard the bible my
[29:39] whole life in sunday school that's what
[29:40] we should do praise the lord but it
[29:42] never clicked it never become personal
[29:45] to me until i received the holy ghost
[29:48] and i remember the night in the service
[29:50] i received the holy spirit while the
[29:52] word was being preached the book of acts
[29:53] says that by the way is that while peter
[29:55] yet spake these words the holy ghost
[29:56] fell on them
[29:58] you can receive the holy ghost this
[29:59] morning while i'm preaching to you if
[30:01] you believe he's here won't you raise
[30:03] your hand and said i receive it in the
[30:04] name of the lord jesus christ
[30:07] but i did not come to the word opening
[30:09] to me until i received the holy ghost
[30:11] because i didn't have the amen or on the
[30:13] inside i didn't have the craving the
[30:15] holy ghost only feeds on one thing the
[30:16] word
[30:18] the holy ghost doesn't feed on
[30:19] entertainment the holy ghost doesn't
[30:20] feed on a fellowship
[30:24] it's all important but my holy ghost
[30:26] only feeds on one thing and that's the
[30:28] word and i got this incredible craving i
[30:31] devoured the word of god and the message
[30:33] of the last days i said if god was
[30:35] gracious enough to send elijah in the
[30:37] last days to restore the word i ought to
[30:39] give some time to hear what he said and
[30:41] i said i wanted to know the authority of
[30:42] god i wanted to know his headship what
[30:44] does his word say about everything what
[30:47] does his word say i want to know what it
[30:49] says because i want to bring my life
[30:52] under the headship of the word
[30:55] i don't want to be this deformed
[30:57] creature that's over here and my head is
[30:59] over there and i'm just trying to
[31:00] function like a puppet i wanted to bring
[31:02] my life under the headship of the word
[31:06] of god
[31:08] that's a visual right there by the way
[31:10] that's what i can come up with this
[31:11] morning
[31:13] devoured the message of the last days
[31:15] sent by the seventh angel
[31:18] elijah malachi 4 5 and 6. matthew 17 11.
[31:21] he said well did jesus say anything
[31:22] about it jesus himself referred to
[31:25] elijah truly shall come and restore all
[31:27] things
[31:29] we're past that day now
[31:31] but it's the first key scriptures that
[31:34] jesus said
[31:35] in the prophecy for the last days
[31:38] elijah will come and restore lost truths
[31:42] that ministry is over now
[31:46] but the moving of the holy ghost
[31:49] is not over
[31:51] there's a revival by the word of god in
[31:53] the bride of jesus christ
[31:57] it's a word revival
[31:58] by his spirit making the word real
[32:03] making the word alive
[32:06] can you say amen
[32:09] making things that lay there
[32:11] may be dead in the scripture making it
[32:13] alive to you that's the bride's revival
[32:16] a word revival a spirit revival can you
[32:19] say amen
[32:21] because
[32:23] the spirit had been bound
[32:26] for almost 2 000 years
[32:29] at the door of creeds and dogmas of the
[32:31] church
[32:33] i'm going to lay a heavy one on you
[32:35] the holy spirit for the most part bound
[32:38] up through the dark ages by the time we
[32:40] get the end time
[32:42] the holy spirit was bound by creeds and
[32:44] dogmas of men
[32:46] in christianity
[32:49] when you mess with this word
[32:51] you bind the spirit up
[32:56] the holy spirit was bound for almost
[32:57] 2000 years by creeds and dogmas of
[33:00] banned but he said it's to be released
[33:02] in the evening time by the evening time
[33:05] message
[33:07] so when did it start
[33:09] little man luther
[33:11] in the catholic church
[33:13] threw the bread down
[33:14] said this isn't the literal body
[33:17] struggled if you watch some of the
[33:19] movies he's just almost insane i've got
[33:21] to have the assurance that i'm saved
[33:23] instead of looking to the catholic
[33:25] church
[33:26] he looked to his bible and the bible
[33:28] said the just shall live by faith if i
[33:30] have faith in what the son of god did at
[33:32] calvary then god says i can be saved and
[33:35] he had a conversion he had to change not
[33:37] by a candle can you say amen not by a
[33:39] confession to a priest
[33:41] can you say amen not by saying the
[33:43] communion bread was the literal body of
[33:45] jesus christ he threw it down he said
[33:47] that just shall live by faith and that
[33:49] was the beginnings of god restoring his
[33:51] message to the church
[33:53] the spirit was released
[33:56] slowly released
[33:58] people come under the freedom and said
[34:00] praise be to god and they actually got
[34:01] almost too excited because they begin to
[34:04] build a denomination around luther don't
[34:06] do that don't take a man and build a
[34:09] denomination around it don't take luther
[34:11] and build a denomination and they did
[34:13] the lutherans don't take wesley and
[34:15] build a denomination don't do that let
[34:17] the spirit take you to the next step
[34:21] pentecost so you got luther wesley
[34:24] restored sanctification to the church we
[34:26] should live a sanctified life the spirit
[34:28] released to the people then azusa street
[34:30] the outpouring of the gifts 1906 is
[34:32] who's the street god restoring the gifts
[34:34] back to the church god restored the
[34:36] blessings back to the church the
[34:38] shouting can you say man and the freedom
[34:40] god but it wasn't the final step
[34:45] god's taken us to more than just the
[34:47] gifts being restored to the church
[34:50] god is releasing his spirit
[34:53] fully released by the evening time
[34:55] message
[34:56] his spirit bound by creeds and dogmas
[34:59] and oh it's been released in the evening
[35:01] time
[35:04] don't don't take it and build a lutheran
[35:06] out of it
[35:07] all respect to you lutheran people i'm
[35:09] not teaching against you if you're
[35:10] listening this morning
[35:12] don't take wesley and build the nazarene
[35:14] church and this denomination pentecost
[35:18] two years after 1906.
[35:21] if you don't know your history that's
[35:22] that's up to you i've read the history
[35:24] two or three years after 1906
[35:27] they started to split into denominations
[35:31] assembly of god
[35:33] church of god
[35:36] no don't do that
[35:38] don't do that
[35:39] let's pray
[35:41] and let's let the holy spirit take us to
[35:43] the next step
[35:44] let's not buying this up by denomination
[35:46] like the catholic church did that's
[35:48] right
[35:51] hey i love you i wouldn't be saying this
[35:53] unless i loved you
[35:55] you just chew on it you just think about
[35:57] it
[35:58] i'm saying the holy spirit is not to be
[36:01] bound up by our ideas or denominational
[36:04] ideas it's to be loose to the people in
[36:06] the end time
[36:08] and why is it to be loose so that the
[36:10] body
[36:11] can bring
[36:12] hit make him the full preeminent the
[36:16] head the word comes back to his church
[36:19] that sons and daughters can come under
[36:21] his preeminence and exercise
[36:24] the true
[36:25] authority of jesus christ
[36:27] carrying the name of jesus you're not
[36:29] carrying his name just because you say
[36:30] his name
[36:32] but you have his name
[36:34] by spirit
[36:36] praise the lord
[36:37] still love me
[36:39] hey just give me a listen give me a
[36:40] chance here all right so in my testimony
[36:44] you know and when we look at our lives
[36:45] this morning it really begs the question
[36:48] i'm only on the first paragraph of what
[36:50] i'm preaching this morning you can tell
[36:52] i'm having a real good time
[36:55] i won't be long but what i have to say i
[36:57] think you should take and chew on it
[37:02] this begs the question now when we talk
[37:04] about the superiority of superiority of
[37:06] influence in our life who's the most
[37:08] influence in our life
[37:11] so it really begs the question
[37:14] in your life who has the final say
[37:16] of things in your life
[37:20] you know brother brahm taught us the
[37:22] absolute is the word of god
[37:24] there has to be an absolute to anything
[37:26] when you come up to the corner and
[37:27] there's a red light
[37:29] if there was no red light there some
[37:31] corners would be chaos and all kinds of
[37:34] accidents so there's an absolute at the
[37:36] corner when we drive up
[37:37] there's a red light there's a green
[37:38] light you can't go to it turns green you
[37:40] shouldn't
[37:42] there's an absolute there's an absolute
[37:44] at a baseball game
[37:45] come on
[37:47] and people fuss and stew about the
[37:49] absolute of that umpire he makes a call
[37:51] you can disagree with all you want to
[37:53] but we're going to have a pretty crazy
[37:55] game if somebody don't have the final
[37:57] word whether you agree with him or not
[38:00] the umpire has the final word
[38:03] and that's where we need to come
[38:05] spiritually that our absolute is not
[38:07] some two-bit preacher on the internet
[38:10] our absolute is not some family member
[38:12] some uncle telling us what to do our
[38:14] absolute has to be rooted in the word of
[38:16] god he should have the final say
[38:20] who has the final say in all things in
[38:22] our life who decides what we do what
[38:25] influence will be given to the decisions
[38:27] for all things in our life there's some
[38:29] questions i'm asking you this morning
[38:30] who decides who decides what's this who
[38:33] decides what's modest
[38:37] who's it left up to
[38:40] what influence will be given to
[38:42] decisions in all your life and this is
[38:44] the hour that we're in now this is the
[38:46] work of the lord now it's not that we
[38:48] know that jesus was our god
[38:50] or that he paid the price of redemption
[38:52] it's the power of redemption working in
[38:55] us and our obedience to the word makes
[38:58] the authority of god flow into his body
[39:01] as we make him the full preeminent one
[39:03] we make him the full influence in our
[39:05] life the word has the full influence it
[39:08] influences my decisions it influences my
[39:10] life can you say amen
[39:12] praise the lord this bride of the last
[39:15] days
[39:16] i want to tell you what she's doing this
[39:18] bride that i'm preaching to and the ones
[39:20] around the world that are coming under
[39:22] the headship of the word finally out of
[39:24] denomination under only one head jesus
[39:27] christ the word
[39:29] even the book of revelation says it
[39:31] about that system come out of her my
[39:33] people come out of those systems
[39:36] come back to the word little bride
[39:39] and you're not gonna be under a pastor
[39:41] you're not going to be and i know we're
[39:42] under pastors but it's not going to be
[39:44] the headship of the nicolaitan spirit
[39:46] where the where is some dictatorship num
[39:49] some denominational head sending out a
[39:51] book to you to tell you what to preach
[39:55] no the bride is going to accept one
[39:58] handship and that's the headship of the
[40:00] revealed word of the hour
[40:04] come out of her my people come out of
[40:07] those denominations come out of those
[40:09] systems you say well our church is
[40:11] independent well just make sure that
[40:13] they're
[40:14] believing all the word of god and the
[40:16] word for this age if they're not come
[40:17] out of that mess
[40:19] that's what the bible says for you to do
[40:22] get under the headship of the word of
[40:24] god
[40:26] the bride
[40:28] the last day's bride
[40:30] i already said this a couple sundays ago
[40:32] but
[40:32] it was so good i'm going to say it again
[40:36] the last bride the last day's bright is
[40:38] reversing
[40:39] all the rebellion of lucifer in heaven
[40:45] it started there didn't it
[40:48] started with lucifer
[40:50] his influence on the other angels his
[40:53] rebellion to authority he was right next
[40:55] to the authority of god god's right hand
[40:57] man god it's right-hand angel so to
[40:59] speak
[41:00] great chief musician
[41:02] greatly talented
[41:04] closest to god that you could get
[41:06] exercise was under the authority of god
[41:09] and all of a sudden he comes out from
[41:10] underneath that throat says i'm going to
[41:11] lift my kingdom above his kingdom
[41:13] lucifer was the first one to establish
[41:15] the principle of rebellion to the word
[41:18] of
[41:18] god i don't want to live by that
[41:20] principle
[41:22] he comes out
[41:24] but this bride is reversing
[41:26] the rebellion
[41:28] of lucifer
[41:31] this bride is also reversing the fall in
[41:33] the garden the bride of the last days is
[41:36] reversing the fall in the garden
[41:40] soon as calvary the purchased price was
[41:43] prayed at calvary god birthed the bride
[41:45] on the day of pentecost and for 2000
[41:48] years he's been bringing the names
[41:50] that's on the lamb's book of life
[41:52] bringing him to a conversion to a new
[41:53] birth and when we climax at the end time
[41:56] this bride is going to have the same
[41:58] test that eve had she's going to have
[42:01] the same serpent whispering in her ear
[42:06] are you listening
[42:08] the hiss of the serpent will be in the
[42:11] ears of the last days people
[42:15] god didn't really say that or god didn't
[42:17] mean it the way that he said it
[42:22] but now we're in a time
[42:24] that the prophet said
[42:26] this
[42:27] second eve this bride is here to prove
[42:33] to satan
[42:34] that this eve is not like the first eve
[42:41] i don't know what you think of yourself
[42:42] this morning but i'm trying to give you
[42:44] an identity that if you latch onto
[42:47] it's pretty powerful
[42:48] that i stand in a position
[42:50] not by arrogance or pride by authority
[42:53] that i'm actually acting out the word of
[42:55] god to reverse what happened in the
[42:58] garden
[42:59] and to prove to satan this second eve is
[43:02] not
[43:03] like the first eve
[43:06] she won't fall by a misinterpretation of
[43:09] the word she won't follow man's ideas
[43:12] she has one headship that's the word of
[43:14] god and she won't fall like eve how many
[43:17] believe christ was the second adam
[43:20] if you're a bible reader christ was the
[43:21] second adam if there was a second adam
[43:23] there has to be a second eve and i'm it
[43:26] you're it can you say amen this eve is
[43:28] to prove to the devil
[43:31] that this eve is not like the first eve
[43:34] no no no no satan we're not following by
[43:36] it we're not listening to the hits of
[43:37] the serpent we're not listening to any
[43:39] other ideas of man except the true word
[43:42] of god
[43:44] not listening to it
[43:46] i learned this that's how the fall
[43:47] happened
[43:48] and i'm being used to reverse this whole
[43:50] thing until the devil's really he's
[43:52] howling now satan is howling over this
[43:55] word coming to the bride this book of
[43:57] redemption this message of the last days
[44:00] this revival he's howling at it that's
[44:02] why he's fighting you every day that's
[44:04] why he's whispering in you that's why
[44:06] the accuser of the brethren is still
[44:08] saying you're not it you're not the
[44:10] bride you're not the one you're just no
[44:12] you made this mistake you did this the
[44:14] other day how can you be the bride
[44:15] listen quit listening to the accuser of
[44:18] the brethren
[44:19] [Applause]
[44:22] stop listening to him
[44:24] i'm this
[44:25] i'm that
[44:28] we know the devil's lying with his lips
[44:30] are moving
[44:32] and he's always moving in your ear
[44:34] the accuser knows accuser of who
[44:38] not the accuser of donald trump joe
[44:40] biden
[44:43] it's not it's that that's all that's a
[44:45] sideshow
[44:46] it's not what's happening
[44:49] we're what's happening
[44:50] the body of christ is what's happening
[44:53] it's just a sideshow
[44:55] so if he's the accuser of
[44:57] not donald trump not not hillary
[45:02] it's not bothering her he's bothering
[45:04] you
[45:07] he's speaking in your ear
[45:10] that's when the bride says okay
[45:12] i'm getting out of that channel i'm
[45:14] gonna quit listening to his voice
[45:20] shut up satan
[45:23] and just i don't know
[45:26] if the devil keeps badgering you so bad
[45:31] remind him and remind you of your past
[45:34] you remind him of the future
[45:37] is that right
[45:39] you say satan since you keep hanging
[45:41] around and i've told you to go
[45:43] let's have a bible study what do you say
[45:47] see where could we go
[45:50] i know you don't like genesis
[45:52] because that exposes when you started
[45:56] but we don't have much time satan so
[45:57] let's skip to the book of revelations
[46:00] let's have a bible study if he's not
[46:02] gone yet i'd be surprised because he
[46:04] don't want to hear his future in the
[46:06] book of revelations
[46:08] because there's there's many scriptures
[46:10] in there talked about his doom his end
[46:12] and the lake of fire you know what the
[46:14] lake of fire hell in the lake of fire
[46:17] was not created for me
[46:21] what kind of devil is telling the bride
[46:23] that you're going to go to hell
[46:25] tell him that hell was created for satan
[46:28] and his angels
[46:30] hell was not created for me
[46:33] i'm not even predestinated to be there
[46:39] no hell is not for me i'm not going to
[46:42] hell i'm going in a rapture someday
[46:44] because of the word of god that i
[46:45] believe
[46:48] oh somebody ought to shout this morning
[46:50] somebody ought to say praise the lord
[46:54] tell the devil say oh there's a lot of
[46:57] scriptures here that we can go do but
[46:59] because you've accused me the last few
[47:01] days let's go to the one that says and
[47:04] satan was cast down the accuser of the
[47:07] brethren to accuse them no more
[47:11] [Applause]
[47:18] and then
[47:19] poof he goes away
[47:22] and he'll leave you alone for maybe a
[47:24] few days
[47:25] a few hours
[47:27] and then you got to have another bible
[47:29] study
[47:30] whatever is needed for this guy
[47:32] whatever is needed for this dude take
[47:35] care of them through the word of god
[47:38] drop some a-bombs on them
[47:41] the word of god
[47:43] he hates it
[47:44] he's howling and then when this bride
[47:47] begins and it's not just that we say i'm
[47:49] bride i'm in the message of the last
[47:51] days i've come out of her my people i'm
[47:54] under the freedom of spirit of the lord
[47:55] jesus christ it's not that
[47:57] it's when she really begins to come
[48:00] under
[48:01] the headship in her life
[48:04] and he looks and say says
[48:07] i've got the preeminence
[48:09] in that brother and sister's life
[48:12] my son and daughter
[48:14] they're starting to exercise a life
[48:16] every day of living in the spirit
[48:18] anybody ever heard of it
[48:20] walking in the spirit living in the
[48:21] spirit is that i don't make any
[48:23] decisions too quickly
[48:26] and if uncle so-and-so calls and says
[48:28] you should do this
[48:30] say all right i appreciate the input but
[48:32] i don't make any decisions too quickly
[48:34] unless i consult the lord
[48:37] and his word
[48:38] and i go into the message of the last
[48:41] days
[48:42] and i research it and i research my
[48:44] bible and i look at what the prophet of
[48:46] god said and i look say god is there
[48:48] something that you can show me
[48:51] to give me direction
[48:53] because i don't make any decisions too
[48:55] hastily unfortunately there's some
[48:57] decisions in life you have to make quick
[49:00] the less of those we have the better
[49:02] you just depend on the lord and
[49:04] sometimes wing it but you don't want to
[49:06] do that too often
[49:08] you're going to give it time
[49:11] and you let an influence come in your
[49:13] life of your decisions and your flesh
[49:16] may want something so bad
[49:18] but god looks down at his son
[49:20] and sees all that battle going on and he
[49:23] says i've finally seen my son wait a
[49:26] little bit and he didn't act in
[49:28] decisions with his flesh or his own
[49:30] intellect or his background education or
[49:33] what he thinks is best he consulted me
[49:36] and he obeyed what i the direction i
[49:38] gave him
[49:40] god just breathe
[49:42] breathes it in
[49:44] this is what i've been trying to get
[49:46] through for 6 000 years
[49:48] my sons adam's race restored back to
[49:52] being under the full headship of
[49:54] leadership of the holy spirit
[49:57] they don't live by impressions
[49:59] we don't believe something just because
[50:00] something comes to our mind
[50:02] people think because something came to
[50:04] their mind it's god speaking to them
[50:06] not always
[50:07] you better check that out see if it
[50:09] lines up with the
[50:10] word people think because they thought
[50:13] it it's
[50:14] final
[50:15] they it's it's in a lot of it is their
[50:18] own opinions their own oppressions their
[50:19] own
[50:20] fleshly affection
[50:22] we've got to move past that
[50:28] is this okay
[50:31] amen
[50:32] hey man let's give the lord a handclap
[50:33] afraid so i'm taking a drink
[50:36] [Applause]
[50:41] i don't know why i feel so free this
[50:43] morning but
[50:44] when those kids sing to you like that
[50:47] give you a charge
[50:50] and when you're headed out to the smoky
[50:51] mountains
[50:52] for vacation tonight i don't know maybe
[50:54] that's what it is i'm just i'm just
[50:56] gonna blast this out and i'm skipping
[50:58] out
[50:59] nobody can find me
[51:02] but the mountains are calling
[51:04] and i must go
[51:08] john muir said that
[51:12] once you guys put up that quote brother
[51:14] bradham and christ the mystery of god
[51:16] revealed look at here
[51:20] christ the mystery of god revealed moses
[51:22] his intellectuals he had to lose them in
[51:24] order to find christ
[51:26] to be a prisoner
[51:27] and then went and he's referring to in
[51:29] the bible where paul a prisoner he
[51:31] preached a message paul a prisoner
[51:33] and that's a strange subject that he
[51:36] became bound
[51:37] by only the holy spirit he wouldn't act
[51:39] unless the holy spirit led him
[51:41] paul became a prisoner not only a
[51:42] physical prisoner but he was a prisoner
[51:45] to the will of man and his own will he's
[51:47] a prisoner to the will of
[51:48] god he had come to a place and this is
[51:51] why he referred this he said to be a
[51:53] prisoner moses he had lose them in order
[51:55] to find christ then when god got all the
[51:58] world beat out of moses and all of his
[52:00] mighty men that he was and stand in the
[52:02] presence of that pillar of fire that day
[52:04] uh i believe brother nathan last sunday
[52:06] spoke about the pillar of fire how many
[52:07] remember that
[52:09] when he come in the presence of the
[52:10] pillar of fire that day he was found
[52:12] just speechless
[52:14] god broke him down
[52:16] i tell you when we come into the real
[52:18] presence of god it's just all of our tr
[52:20] former training everything that we are
[52:22] it just breaks us down and it just makes
[52:24] us species that god how do you want to
[52:26] use me
[52:28] he was just found speechless he didn't
[52:30] even couldn't even talk he said god had
[52:32] a prisoner then you see you won't try
[52:34] after your own searching next next one
[52:36] then god had to endow him with power
[52:39] enough that he could go down there and
[52:41] he said lord i told pharaoh what you
[52:43] said and he wouldn't do it and he said
[52:45] then take this thyroid god speaking
[52:47] that's god's word go out there and point
[52:49] it towards the east and call for flies
[52:52] and flies came into creation because he
[52:56] had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay
[52:59] off with nothing
[53:02] what is that saying what the word says
[53:04] is that he gives his authority to people
[53:07] when they become prisoners to his will
[53:10] moses finally come to the place i can't
[53:13] use my background i can use my education
[53:16] i can't do i can't even speak right lord
[53:18] and then god had him exactly where he
[53:20] wanted them and he said now i'm ready to
[53:21] use you and he said pharaoh listen to me
[53:24] take your rod stand up like you said at
[53:26] the red sea why cry speak and go forward
[53:29] i've called you you're my son you have
[53:31] the authority
[53:32] go forward in the name of jesus
[53:36] moses grabbed that rod with there in it
[53:38] and everything he spoke and
[53:41] creative power was on his lips a human
[53:45] being
[53:47] let there be
[53:48] let there be flies and there was flies
[53:51] everywhere
[53:54] let there be
[53:55] this
[53:56] blood in the water let the you know all
[53:58] the plagues that begin to come down the
[54:00] authority that was upon that land's lips
[54:02] but remember brother branham is saying
[54:05] he had a prisoner god had a prisoner
[54:08] that pharaoh couldn't pay off
[54:11] with nothing is there any left of that
[54:15] nothing else could turn him no way he
[54:17] was a complete prisoner in the chains of
[54:19] god's word
[54:21] bound up only to thus saith the lord
[54:24] oh if god can get him prisoners like
[54:28] that
[54:30] oh if you could raise your hand church
[54:32] this morning say god
[54:34] truly make me a prisoner to your will
[54:37] let me not act unless it's truly your
[54:40] word and your will which is his will
[54:43] it's his word
[54:44] oh if i could preach this morning and
[54:46] have at the end of this service we may
[54:48] not have shouting we may have dancing i
[54:50] don't know what we'll have but if i
[54:52] could have some people leave that's true
[54:53] say lord make me a prisoner to your will
[54:57] then i've accomplished my sermon this
[54:59] morning make me a prisoner to the word
[55:01] of god
[55:02] because i know that's when god can
[55:04] really use the authority
[55:07] in the church
[55:10] he's got to get that he said now oh if
[55:12] god can get in prisons like that that's
[55:14] when he can express his preeminences you
[55:16] see he's got the man or the person so
[55:19] that he knows
[55:21] nothing
[55:22] but christ
[55:24] [Applause]
[55:31] the threefold purpose of god is that god
[55:33] would fully reveal himself to man number
[55:35] one
[55:37] and number two
[55:40] that he would get the preeminence in his
[55:42] body
[55:44] and number three he would take them back
[55:47] to eden again it's the threefold purpose
[55:49] of god
[55:50] to reveal himself to man through jesus
[55:52] christ did he do that
[55:54] he fulfilled that purpose when he came
[55:56] in jesus christ god revealed himself to
[55:58] man fully in the body of jesus christ
[56:01] jesus was god
[56:03] he wasn't a second person of the trinity
[56:07] all that god was he poured into that
[56:09] human vessel
[56:12] see that's a mystery i know
[56:15] it is a mystery that is the mystery of
[56:17] god
[56:18] don't try to split them into three
[56:19] people
[56:22] no don't try to do that
[56:25] i'm
[56:26] i'm a father i'm a husband
[56:31] i'm
[56:32] i have
[56:33] a lot of offices
[56:36] too many
[56:38] but i'm all the same person
[56:41] don't split god into three and make an
[56:43] idolatrous out of you no don't do it and
[56:45] i say that respectfully to all of our
[56:47] trinitarian brothers and sisters i
[56:49] respect you as a brother in christ
[56:51] but don't try to sell you can't sell it
[56:53] to a jew you can never sell three
[56:56] distinct persons to a jew never happened
[56:59] a true jew
[57:02] hero israel the lord our god is one lord
[57:08] in three offices of father son holy
[57:10] spirit
[57:11] but he's one god and so god manifested
[57:13] himself in jesus christ can you say amen
[57:16] number two
[57:20] to get the preeminence in man and that's
[57:21] the work he's in right now but guess
[57:23] what happens when he gets the
[57:24] preeminences in the church he takes them
[57:27] back to eden
[57:29] again
[57:31] can you say amen
[57:36] praise the lord
[57:37] can i have 10 more minutes amen
[57:40] so let's go back where we fell let's go
[57:42] back to genesis 1. all right genesis 1
[57:45] genesis 3 let's read that and then i'll
[57:47] bring this down to a close
[57:50] i mean i'm unlike the second or third
[57:53] paragraph so many things to talk about
[57:58] but i want those children
[58:00] to come and sing again in a few minutes
[58:03] and sing about how blessed we are
[58:12] here's where we fell genesis 3 we were
[58:14] gods adam and eve were gods on earth
[58:16] they had all authority over the earth
[58:18] they named the animals
[58:20] nothing controlled adam adam controlled
[58:23] things how many would like to be back
[58:24] there again
[58:27] nothing controlled adam adam controlled
[58:28] things through the power of god
[58:31] he ruled and reigned on this earth he
[58:33] was this earth was given for him this
[58:35] earth is given to his bride to his
[58:36] people
[58:37] this earth is fast falling back into the
[58:39] hands of sons and daughters of god very
[58:41] quickly
[58:42] let
[58:44] presidents and prime ministers fight
[58:45] over land all they want to let them war
[58:49] even over the land of israel
[58:52] but that
[58:53] that real estate is fast falling back
[58:56] into the hands of god's people
[58:59] gonna happen
[59:01] but the whole earth was given
[59:03] this real estate this whole planet was
[59:06] given for adam to rule and reign on
[59:08] that's what it was created for and it's
[59:10] fast falling back into the hands of sons
[59:12] and daughters of god
[59:14] and so i just chuckle when i'm on the
[59:16] news
[59:17] watching how they fight over land and
[59:20] war and i'm saying it's all going to be
[59:22] mine someday guys
[59:24] you're wasting all your money
[59:26] it's fast falling back into the hands of
[59:28] the bride there's going to be a
[59:30] millennium i don't want it the way that
[59:31] it is by the way i don't want it the way
[59:33] that it is there's too many demons on
[59:35] this earth there's too much perversion
[59:37] on this earth it's too much a mess so i
[59:39] want god to come with his holy fire and
[59:42] purge the whole thing and burn it all
[59:45] and then he's going to set up a
[59:46] millennium of a thousand years honeymoon
[59:48] with the bride because he's already
[59:50] marrying the bride right now and it's
[59:52] going to be a thousand years honeymoon
[59:55] in a millennium i'm not talking about a
[59:58] story i'm talking about the word of god
[1:00:01] this earth is fast falling back into the
[1:00:03] hands of the bride and we will rule and
[1:00:05] reign on this earth again
[1:00:07] thousand-year honeymoon that's a pretty
[1:00:09] long one i don't know how long philip's
[1:00:11] going to be gone brother doug you know
[1:00:13] he's not here today it's like is he
[1:00:14] taking a thousand years or what
[1:00:17] tell him to come home my goodness
[1:00:20] a thousand years that's pretty good
[1:00:23] i'm in how about you
[1:00:26] this earth is fast falling back in but
[1:00:29] he says now the serpent was more subtle
[1:00:32] i know where i'm at in my time i'll be
[1:00:34] right in about an hour
[1:00:36] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:00:38] beast of the field which the lord god
[1:00:39] had made
[1:00:41] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[1:00:43] said so this creature that god part of
[1:00:46] god's creation of course
[1:00:48] satan anoints him because he can speak
[1:00:50] he uses this serpent because he can
[1:00:52] speak
[1:00:54] yeah hath god said and what he's
[1:00:55] speaking is not just cussing
[1:00:58] he's actually quoting the word of god
[1:01:00] for some reason
[1:01:01] that's because satan's behind him
[1:01:03] speaking
[1:01:04] and he's going to cause the fall yeah
[1:01:06] god said ye shall not eat of every tree
[1:01:08] of the garden and the woman said unto
[1:01:09] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[1:01:11] the trees of the garden
[1:01:13] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:01:15] the midst of the garden god hath said
[1:01:17] now here eve she knew her words she knew
[1:01:19] what god had said i want you to notice
[1:01:21] though when god told adam and eve don't
[1:01:24] eat of that tree don't touch don't even
[1:01:26] don't eat of it
[1:01:28] don't feed on it and don't even touch it
[1:01:31] now friends sometimes god
[1:01:33] tells us don't feed on something
[1:01:36] and then he says to some things don't
[1:01:38] even touch it
[1:01:41] speed ahead to satan's eden today and
[1:01:43] you young people and you adults and
[1:01:45] everybody can apply this to everything
[1:01:48] in your life
[1:01:50] there are certain things that god warns
[1:01:52] us about even though it's not a spirit
[1:01:54] yet it can become a spirit
[1:01:59] when you look at the message keep that
[1:02:01] in mind
[1:02:02] that when you read certain things you
[1:02:03] say that's a strange thing to say matter
[1:02:05] of fact for some of you who've never
[1:02:06] read the message a lot of it's going to
[1:02:08] be counter culture but if you read it
[1:02:10] just sit on it a while because some of
[1:02:11] it is not it's some of it's not saying
[1:02:14] you're you're this or that it's saying
[1:02:15] that if you were to head down this
[1:02:17] direction
[1:02:18] this is where you where you end up
[1:02:21] because god's prophets do that they give
[1:02:22] warnings too it's not just you're this
[1:02:25] you're a dirt bag you're living in sin
[1:02:27] it's it's a warning to say if you go
[1:02:29] this path you will be living in sin
[1:02:31] i like people to say i'm interested in
[1:02:33] listening to not only god's uh
[1:02:37] god's
[1:02:38] diagnosis of me
[1:02:40] but i'm listening to his warnings
[1:02:44] i wish we had more children that listen
[1:02:46] to the warnings of parents you're going
[1:02:47] to get burned if you touch that
[1:02:51] sometimes god's just warning us and
[1:02:52] people feel so condemned and is he
[1:02:54] telling me that is he saying i'm a
[1:02:57] because i wear these shorts and
[1:02:59] listen grow up
[1:03:02] some things the prophet said is to warn
[1:03:04] us where it's going
[1:03:07] if you play and flirt with that thing
[1:03:10] you could take a feminine spear
[1:03:14] maybe you can look at the message a
[1:03:15] little different now
[1:03:18] it's to me it's all
[1:03:20] the love of god
[1:03:22] loving his people
[1:03:24] out of this generation who's going to be
[1:03:27] destroyed
[1:03:29] and he's loving us saying
[1:03:31] this is your way out
[1:03:34] don't do that
[1:03:37] you start listening to it and you come
[1:03:38] into the power of redemption which
[1:03:40] redemption only heads in one direction
[1:03:42] that's upwards
[1:03:51] eve
[1:03:52] i want you to know somebody eve when god
[1:03:54] told adam and eve
[1:03:56] and this is proof this morning that i
[1:03:58] have to continue this next next time i
[1:04:00] preach because there's too much here
[1:04:02] but if you just give me these just a few
[1:04:04] minutes here i just want to say when god
[1:04:06] told them
[1:04:08] don't eat of that tree
[1:04:09] don't touch it the tree of knowledge of
[1:04:12] good and evil
[1:04:13] he didn't even give him an explanation
[1:04:15] why
[1:04:16] everybody knows that right
[1:04:20] there was no reason why and and so now
[1:04:22] you look at it and you say
[1:04:25] he said don't eat you can eat of all the
[1:04:27] other trees but don't eat of that one
[1:04:28] with no explanation so what's it about
[1:04:31] it's just basically trust and obey
[1:04:36] if it was like a modern generation
[1:04:38] teenager today
[1:04:40] why
[1:04:42] i'm not doing it until i know why
[1:04:46] boy fellow you got a rough path ahead of
[1:04:48] you if you want to come in relation with
[1:04:50] god you'll never go with that
[1:04:52] attitude because there are some things
[1:04:55] god tells us to do and he doesn't fully
[1:04:57] explain it right off the bat
[1:05:03] didn't tell him
[1:05:05] and now he eve quotes it back to the
[1:05:07] serpent she knew it well
[1:05:10] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[1:05:12] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:05:13] which is in the midst of the garden god
[1:05:15] hath said eve quoting god ye shall not
[1:05:18] eat of it neither
[1:05:19] ye
[1:05:20] touch neither you touch it lest ye die
[1:05:24] and that's what he told us that's what
[1:05:25] god said
[1:05:27] that's our source
[1:05:29] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:05:32] you should not surely die i mean think
[1:05:34] about that a minute
[1:05:37] well first of all god he just he's just
[1:05:39] out to kill you like that so quickly
[1:05:42] god's a loving god
[1:05:44] jesus is a loving jesus
[1:05:47] he is
[1:05:48] but if you read the four gospels
[1:05:51] your interpretation of love isn't going
[1:05:53] to come through very strong in some of
[1:05:54] the ways jesus is talking to the
[1:05:56] religious leaders
[1:05:59] his love was not rooted in feelings
[1:06:02] it was rooted in truth
[1:06:05] oh come on
[1:06:06] can you say man
[1:06:08] don't turn me off give me give me three
[1:06:10] more minutes here
[1:06:13] i know i'm in i'm in your face this
[1:06:15] morning but you know i love you and i'm
[1:06:17] just asking you to consider it
[1:06:19] the serpent said the woman you should
[1:06:20] not surely die for god doth know that
[1:06:22] here's the serpent talking god doth no
[1:06:25] all of a sudden he becomes an
[1:06:26] interpreter now
[1:06:28] he becomes an interpreter of what god
[1:06:30] said
[1:06:32] it hasn't been interpreted yet to eve
[1:06:34] but he becomes the interpreter of what
[1:06:36] god said
[1:06:37] for god he becomes this great theologian
[1:06:39] on god all of a sudden for
[1:06:44] could it be
[1:06:45] that a lot of the theologians were
[1:06:47] hearing the hiss of the serpent
[1:06:50] more than the bars more than the
[1:06:51] prostitute houses
[1:06:54] that the voice here was like it was in
[1:06:56] the serpent he's not out there trying to
[1:06:58] get you to be a prostitute he's here
[1:07:00] quoting and interpreting the word of god
[1:07:04] that's your enemy
[1:07:06] be careful the voice you listen to be
[1:07:08] careful the preachers you listen to
[1:07:11] because here satan's speaking through
[1:07:12] the serpent and he's going to interpret
[1:07:15] god doth know that in the day ye ether
[1:07:17] of then your eyes shall be opened and ye
[1:07:19] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[1:07:22] and eve had never heard any
[1:07:24] interpretation yet and so now he
[1:07:25] explores this interpretation god knows
[1:07:28] this and god knows if you eat that you
[1:07:30] need to know something if you eat that
[1:07:32] you'll become as a god well first of all
[1:07:34] adam and eve should have been saying why
[1:07:36] are you selling us on the fact of
[1:07:38] becoming gods
[1:07:39] when we're already gods over this earth
[1:07:43] god has already put us in authority
[1:07:48] what a misinterpretation what a lie
[1:07:50] first lie that was ever told as a big
[1:07:52] one
[1:07:54] and then he's this little thing i've got
[1:07:55] to get up here and finish and quit he
[1:07:58] says this thing ye shall know
[1:08:00] good
[1:08:00] and evil
[1:08:07] it's kind of a
[1:08:08] enticement that
[1:08:10] that to to discern good and evil
[1:08:14] i could come into the place that i'm the
[1:08:16] one
[1:08:17] discerning good and evil
[1:08:21] instead of god
[1:08:24] now think about that
[1:08:27] because that's what i'm preaching on
[1:08:28] this morning
[1:08:31] he's influencing
[1:08:33] her decision making process
[1:08:35] and saying you can even be as a god and
[1:08:37] the whole thing of discerning what's
[1:08:38] right and wrong
[1:08:40] will be in your hands
[1:08:43] that's pretty serious
[1:08:46] because sons of god when they get a new
[1:08:49] birth and they grow
[1:08:50] into the redemption that god is doing
[1:08:53] they eventually come to even this
[1:08:55] because they're looking at this fall in
[1:08:56] the garden they're saying is that where
[1:08:58] she fell
[1:09:00] they're saying
[1:09:01] sons of god are saying
[1:09:04] i don't even want to exercise my own
[1:09:07] will and my own
[1:09:10] discernment by myself
[1:09:12] of what's right and what's wrong
[1:09:26] i'm going to close on this watchman knee
[1:09:28] missionary to china he was chinese 1950s
[1:09:34] had some wonderful books and wonderful
[1:09:35] things he said here about authority
[1:09:38] and uh
[1:09:40] watchman knee the missionary to china
[1:09:43] was
[1:09:44] he had some pretty straight words for
[1:09:45] the church and he says he was the guy
[1:09:47] that said
[1:09:48] i can't believe all that the american
[1:09:50] church can accomplish without the
[1:09:52] leadership of the holy ghost
[1:09:54] he's pretty straight
[1:09:57] and he talked to ministers over there
[1:09:58] for many years and then he was in hong
[1:10:00] kong he was safe when rush when when uh
[1:10:03] china turned to communism in somewhere
[1:10:06] in the 1950s
[1:10:07] he knew if he went back he'd go to
[1:10:09] prison and he intentionally says i got
[1:10:11] to go back to my people i got a minister
[1:10:12] there as soon as he got back within
[1:10:14] three weeks he was put in prison
[1:10:15] sentenced to 20 years spent the last 20
[1:10:17] years of his life in prison
[1:10:19] was not allowed to do anything except
[1:10:21] the chinese government what they said
[1:10:22] for him to do so you imagine this whole
[1:10:25] flow and stream of the holy spirit all
[1:10:26] these books and all this training and
[1:10:27] all that he's seen in the word is
[1:10:28] completely cut off and i don't know what
[1:10:30] he was doing for 20 years except praying
[1:10:32] 20 years and then when his sentence was
[1:10:34] over they didn't let him go they didn't
[1:10:37] release him so he ended up staying there
[1:10:39] and dying in prison
[1:10:41] he says about this fall
[1:10:44] he says as man's
[1:10:46] as man's obedience increases
[1:10:50] a christian now as a man's obedience
[1:10:53] increases his actions decrease
[1:10:56] when we begin to follow the lord we are
[1:10:58] full of activity
[1:11:00] but quite short of obedience
[1:11:03] this is true
[1:11:06] although we get the holy ghost near a
[1:11:07] new birth it's like jesus he learned
[1:11:10] obedience by the things he suffered we
[1:11:11] start a life of learning how to be
[1:11:13] obedient to the spirit
[1:11:16] and he says when we come to the lord
[1:11:18] we're full of activity i want to go go
[1:11:20] go but quite short on obedience but as
[1:11:22] we advance in spirituality our actions
[1:11:24] gradually diminish until we are filled
[1:11:27] with obedience many however do what they
[1:11:30] like and refuse to do what they dislike
[1:11:32] they never ponder whether or not they
[1:11:34] are acting out of their obedience hence
[1:11:36] many works are done out of self and not
[1:11:38] of obedience to god now he has makes a
[1:11:40] little comment here about this knowledge
[1:11:42] man's actions should not be governed by
[1:11:44] the knowledge of good and evil it should
[1:11:45] be motivated by a sense of obedience the
[1:11:48] principle of good and evil is to live
[1:11:49] according to what is right and what is
[1:11:51] wrong
[1:11:52] if you know you know there's people in
[1:11:54] the world without christ without
[1:11:55] christianity just secular people that
[1:11:58] they they live in this this sense of
[1:12:00] what's right and wrong i want to do
[1:12:01] what's right and i don't want to do
[1:12:02] what's wrong
[1:12:04] the principle of good and evil is to
[1:12:05] live according to what is right and
[1:12:07] wrong before adam and eve ate the
[1:12:08] forbidden fruit their right and wrong
[1:12:11] was in god's hands
[1:12:13] if they did not live before god they
[1:12:16] knew nothing at all
[1:12:18] for their right and wrong actually
[1:12:21] were in god
[1:12:23] that's deep friends
[1:12:25] i shouldn't bring something so deep as
[1:12:26] i'm closing
[1:12:28] for the right and wrong they're they're
[1:12:30] right and wrong adam and eve was
[1:12:31] actually in god by taking the fruit of
[1:12:33] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:12:35] they found a source of right and wrong
[1:12:38] other than god himself consequently
[1:12:40] after the fall men
[1:12:42] need not find
[1:12:43] in god the sense of right and wrong they
[1:12:46] have it in themselves
[1:12:48] this is a result of the fall the work of
[1:12:51] redemption is to bring us back to the
[1:12:53] place where we will now find our right
[1:12:56] and wrong
[1:12:57] only in god
[1:13:03] that's it friends
[1:13:04] i got to stop
[1:13:06] what a powerful statement
[1:13:09] redemption is bringing us back to the
[1:13:11] place sons and daughters of god that all
[1:13:13] of our right and wrong is only in god
[1:13:15] i'm looking for his influence i'm
[1:13:17] looking for his direction i'm looking
[1:13:19] for him to say we live in a world where
[1:13:22] all of our absolutes are out the door
[1:13:24] there's not an absolute anymore they're
[1:13:25] removing all the absolutes even about a
[1:13:27] man what's a man and what's a woman
[1:13:29] there is no absolute anymore but i'm
[1:13:31] preaching to you god has an absolute and
[1:13:33] his sons
[1:13:34] know right and wrong because he told us
[1:13:36] right and wrong
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:42] praise be to god i gotta stop
[1:13:46] it's like that little
[1:13:48] that little uh that sunday school class
[1:13:50] and they're
[1:13:51] you know there's just certain things
[1:13:54] adam and eve didn't know certain things
[1:13:55] god says hey that's it and it's i heard
[1:13:58] a story about that sunday school class
[1:13:59] and the teacher's taking the subject
[1:14:01] sister laura
[1:14:02] the teacher is saying something god has
[1:14:04] a purpose for everything he created you
[1:14:06] know he had the cats take care of the
[1:14:08] mice and the bees they help us get honey
[1:14:10] and they're going into all these things
[1:14:11] and one kid pipes up and says well why
[1:14:14] did god create poison ivy
[1:14:18] i've probably been asking the same thing
[1:14:21] i would have also asked what's the
[1:14:23] purpose in mosquitoes
