========================================

amen I believe there is a people today amen that are following him taking up their cross and amen it's good to be here and certainly a privilege to to be with you and an honor to speak to to the young people and and hopefully with the help of the Lord just say something as as brother Branham said to to put courage in your heart amen that's what we want to do and I especially want to thank you brother Paul for the invitation this week not necessarily for preaching all these services but uh amen for uh for being here in the fellowship we've had together I believe it's good for the ministry to to be in unity together and believe that amen if there's ever a time that called for the unity of of the ministry it's this hour amen because amen we're at the end time I was telling the church the other day that you know um we are literally at the end of of of the time and we are speaking which could be the last services that will be spoken and how important it is for us to to listen to receive to react and and to do that and because God does nothing in vain I don't believe this service is in vain tonight but I believe he he knows exactly who would be here so God bless you we certainly love you and appreciate you and so good to see all the youth that have come the ministry that have come to support it may God bless you this evening amen let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer [Music] our gracious heavenly father I want to say that I love you Lord and I thank you for this opportunity to stand before God's people Lord and they are your people Lord and I pray that you would help me this evening to get myself out of the way that you would anoint my lips Lord anoint the ears of the hearer you know every heart you know their needs you know the power of the enemy and what he's trying to do in their lives Lord and you have a purpose for them Father they're your people they're your children they're somebody in the kingdom of God and I pray Lord that you would just speak in a special way tonight with your help we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you if you just turn in your Bible perhaps to a familiar scripture to you judges the eighth chapter and let me just speak to you for a moment on the scene that is happening here how many love the word amen amen word is our strength amen and let's go to the sorry let's go to the 18th verse and this is Gideon that is speaking then he said unto Zeba and zalmuna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor and they answered as Thou Art so were they each one resembled the children of a king and he said they these they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the Lord liveth if you had saved them alive I would not slay you and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the youth Drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth in Zeba and zalmuna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength and Gideon arose and slew Zeba and zalmuna and took away the ornaments that were on their camel's necks then the men of Israel said unto Gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy son son also for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian and Gideon said unto them I will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the Lord shall rule over you it can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word I am I was looking at this a while back and the scriptures always spoken to me where Gideon has asked his son to take his sword and and and slay the enemy and when he wouldn't do it because he was afraid these Kings said ask Gideon to kill them because they said as a man is so is his strength that's what I want to speak to you this evening I'm going to title it that as a man is so is his strength what he has in him is his strength I believe it's God's desire to put strength in US that's why he's always worked his the scripture says that I would you were in health and prosper even as your soul prospers even Ahab a wicked King when when the prophet spoke to him and said that the syrians are going to come back and go strengthen thyself prepare yourself to meet the enemy God has always provided a strength for his people the word is our strength amen when Abraham was was getting old and he was waiting upon the promise to be fulfilled and he was he he forced 25 years he waited and he waited upon the Lord and God appeared to him and said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now he told this to an old man and brother Branham says that God was telling him now draw your strength for me and what was he doing he said he was preparing him for the miracle that God was going to do in his life God has the provided strength for every one of us this age amen what we're going through your personal struggles your personal life your family life your the family you came out of that none of that God has already measured that in to this age and what you're dealing with and he's already provided what you need to overcome it praise the Lord brother Branham said in in Jehovah Jireh he said if I could ever get the Pentecostals to recognize their sons and daughters of God and Heirs of Abraham then no devil or thing can hold his people nothing can hold them now uh um and I quoted this this morning I want to quote it again he said that he said we need to be stable we need to know where we're standing he says now you can honestly sincerely be stable you can be a stable Methodist you can be a stable Baptist Presbyterian a Catholic and be stable but don't be stable in your church doctrine be stable in the Bible Doctrine examine your doctrines by the Bible ask what Jesus was if he isn't the same today then your Doctrine is wrong how many believe that man this this scene that I'm reading and I'm um I I I I just want to if the help of the Lord maybe incorporate a couple testimonies in there if I can but um uh you know we look at one another I think we need to help one another help one another up we live in the age of of talking about one another and blasting out everybody's failures or what we disagree with one another on and that's not what we should be about we should be about helping one another up amen and so this event that I'm reading to you is closing out the struggle between Israel and and Midian as Zeba and zalmuna are the kings of Midian previously already the princes of Midian orb and Zeb have already been terminated and thus the rulership of this nation that is tormented them for seven years is coming to a close Gideon is standing here now with these rulers subdued in front of him and he's standing there and this is why he asked them the question who were these men that you killed and and he said they were men like you they look like a king They Carried himself like kings and he said this was my family this made Gideon a blood Avenger and and he said I wouldn't have killed you but you've messed with my family and so I want you to keep in mind the spiritual aspect of it Gideon turns to his firstborn son jether which means abundance and he told him amen rise up and draw your sword and slay these Kings I want you to notice that Gideon is asking his son to carry out my desire for you are expressing my blood link you're my firstborn son and I want you to take part in the victory that has already been won I want to say it again I want you to take part in a victory that had already been won Gideon wants his son to be what he is getting the Mighty Men of Valor Gideon didn't know this it took God to tell him who he was but here this has always struck me brother Paul because here stands a young man fully equipped to carry out his father's desire fully equipped but what kept Him from drawing The Sword in that day of consummation was his own fear and so instead of rising up and finishing what had the enemy had brought in upon Him amen he stepped back and refused to take apart in what he was being asked to do listen we're not having Youth meetings like this just to have fun though it is fun and just to come together it is because God is equipping you in this hour to carry out what this generation is called to fulfill amen I once was a youth and said in a chair like you but now our years have have gotten away from us right brother Samuel amen we're getting older we're not the last generation there's a generation coming up behind us amen and you are as fully equipped as a generation before you and God has placed everything in your hands that you have need of but what it takes is a strong hand of Faith to take what God has provided because this sword no matter how sharp it is in the hand of faith it takes a hand of Faith to drive it to the heart of the enemy you're going to take anything tonight it must be by faith he's placed his son in a position strike the last blow at these Kings you know it could have been this kid it could have been Gideon amen I'm going to take all the glory for myself but I I want my son to share in the victory I want my son to know what it's like to stand Victorious over rulers principalities and powers of Darkness that once ruled over families and even generations of families held them in fear and kept them back kept them thinking they couldn't overcome I want you to strike the last blow Don't Be Afraid these kings are already defeated you're only carrying out what I have already done Hallelujah Ephesians 4 8 says therefore it's said when he ascended on high he led captivity captive in other words he let a train of vanquished foes amen and he bestowed gifts on men amen Christ already defeated the enemies that we are fighting Amen in this hour every disease amen every afflicting amen lust and passion all the perversion that we're dealing with this in the age and some of these things become Tangled not amongst the people and you don't know how can God do how can he deliver God has already vanquished him he's already vanquished him he's not asking you to do something he hasn't done nor is he asking you to do something you cannot do Hallelujah I remember one time I hope this is all right I was in Africa while I was there and some of you might have heard this story before but I think it goes well with this a friend of mine who was a bushranger over there he would conduct classes for the Rangers to go through certain stages and the last stage of training for the Rangers was called sleeping with the Predators Hallelujah and I was privileged to go with him on the last class I didn't get to get all the other steps they just took me on the last class to sleep with the Predators and they literally put you in a position where the Predators come into your camp and and you get to Fellowship so what I remember about this Brothers this this Ranger he was a brother it was him and then it was me and a minister friend and another truck and then it was four other gentlemen in in another truck so there was three trucks before before we went out on this this camping trip um uh we had a house service well these four gentlemen were workers way up in the um in the oil fields I think somewhere in North Africa and then they came here and and they was in the house meeting then they were going to go with us on this this camping trip and and I remember the day that we got up to do that one of the brothers he was a big strapping South African gentleman he was tall he might have been six four six five big and strapping I remember him talking to me he said you know he goes I've been in the bush many times and he goes when I'm out there he said I wear and he he told me what kind of knife he straps on and he goes he goes they call me Rambo well he said Rambo and uh and so the day of of sleeping with the Predators comes and out he comes man and he's he is dressed to the nines ready for the Predators I don't know what a big knife is going to do but but he has it on and he's he's totally equipped and what the the ranger said he said what I do you must do also he said when I'm driving you drive if I stop you stop if I go don't stop you go so we get out in the bush and we're driving and and as we're driving we're we're going on through the bush and we get in the middle of a bunch of elephants now we're not in a zoo okay where you can walk away from the cage there's a bunch of elephants and they're starting to cross the path well as they're coming there's an opening there and the brother he just guns it he goes right on through the minister brother who's driving the truck I'm in he just goes right on through but these brothers that are carrying Rambo Rambo sitting in the back of the truck he's not in the cab he's in the back with another brother and and they they don't punch it and go through they just drive up real slow to the opening and when they got up there the elephants crossed over and so they had to stop so now Rambo and his friends are surrounded by elephants and if you've been around African elements uh elephants they're big and you could hear you could hear branches breaking you could hear the trumpeting of the elephants and I'll never forget the ranger we pulled up around around the bin and the ranger got out of the car and he slammed his hand down on the on the top of the hood and he goes I told them to do what I said because they didn't listen so then we'd drive to the camp the brother had took out a half of a zebra and Drug it around the camp to put the scent there and and we're at a water hole and so we're going to wash these animals and he put us all on shifts all night long that we would take shifts watching because even though you're going to sleep with the Predators you don't actually want to sleep with them right so we won a couple guys there to if they get too close you know Shine the Light and so we're you know so we would take one hour and a half shifts and two of us at a time well Rambo had talked to me and I can't I'm calling him ramble because I can't remember his name so I just call him ramble but he said they called him Rambo so I'll call him Rambo and and when he got out of that truck after that elephant experience his demeanor his way he carried himself had totally changed he'd turned white and he looked at me and he goes it was very skinny so he had an excellent go into the camp and we're there and we're waiting because lions and and hyenas and all that you could hear them out in the bush and and they're supposed to come and sniff the dead animal and we praise the Lord get to look at them and and so but the whole time we've taken shifts or an hour and a half and then we sit there and watch amen these these Brethren that sat in the back of the truck and they were very scared they never went to sleep at all they just kept shining their light like this the whole night long they never slept Rambo had totally changed and what happened fear ruined the experience of the camp one man's fear they even told me I had laid on the ground and was sleeping and they told me he said you know a red Roman just crawled right to you and and uh and and I'm like well thank you well red Roman looks like a tarantula it's it's big and and you can see the tracks right where I had slept it was right came up right up here and then it just continued on right on this other side this thing crawled right over the top of me and they said we watched it foreign you know I'm tired of just being informing what's going on around us man if you're equipped in your Rambo at least save me from a spider well I'm saying that to say this you can look the part you can have the equipment you can sing with the angels but if you don't put into operation what he tells you to do amen you are not going to be able to stand the experience and here here is jether now if you've read his story you'll find out this is his defining moment this is where we hear of him and this is where he comes into existence and this is where he goes out of existence amen because you find out because he was afraid amen uh Gideon had 70 Sons one of them was was from a concubine and that man's name was abimelech and that man rose up and wanted to be the ruler and he killed all of the sons except the youngest which means the firstborn died with all the rest in that Scourge but I often wondered what if that boy hadn't got the courage at that moment to draw the sword and destroy those kings that laid in front of him amen his the next chapter of his life would have been different and God brings moments like this into our life to confront something amen that you might be afraid of and even in their stature and in their rulership is greater than you amen but God said I'm asking you to draw the sword and strike the final blow blessed be the name of the Lord takes a strong hand of faith this was his firstborn son you're the Church of the firstborn and God doesn't ask you to do something you cannot do for what he asked you is not tied to your ability but it's tied to his word that's why any experience we have must go back to his word amen amen our birth amen must come from the word I remember when the Lord called me at the age of 17 to preach I was in prayer you know it's a good place to have communion with the Lord is while you're praying and I was in prayer and it was it was close to midnight it was somewhere it was really late in the night and and I was praying and the Lord just spoke to my heart and says you're going to preach the word and and I remember just in my heart just speaking back says no no I'm not and he never said any he only said all he said right after that he said acts 5 and he named the verse and he said acts 5 in the verse and I didn't know what it was but I was having an experience but I didn't know what it was but I hear in his voice tell me you're going to preach and he gave me the word well then I went and looked at the word because you can hear a voice you can have an experience but if it doesn't line up with the word God doesn't ask you to hang on to something that's not of him so when I went back and looked at acts 5 19 it says the angel of the Lord came to them by night and told them to go stand in the temple and teach the words of this life so what the voice told me was confirmed by the words it wasn't my imagination I didn't dredge it up and ask it to happen I didn't even know what that scripture said I don't want to tell you any experience you've ever had go back and find it in the words because once it's in the words once it's for you find it in the word Satan cannot take it from you any experience you've ever had amen he can take from you because that's his nature but when it comes back to the word Hallelujah I wanna I just want to take this thought from this statement of the King as a man is so is his strength your strong is what you have inside of you strength is measured in different ways actually in spiritual if we try to live this in our own strength you'll find your strength is tied to your ability which God cannot use Amen brother Branham said Moses offered God his own ability and God couldn't use one thing that Moses offered of his human ability the Bible said in the book of Acts that Moses was a man Mighty in word indeed learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and he cannot use it and he can't use yours Paul said I had to forget everything I ever know to learn Christ this was a man that was steeped in the scripture concerning Zeal of Pharisee a Jew of the Jews a teacher of the Old Testament and he had to forget everything he knew Hallelujah your ability gets in the way of the will and power of God but faith is tied to God God's not even wanting to use your faith brother Ram says your faith is no good we need his faith when the man at the gate beautiful was healed it wasn't by Peter's faith it was in the name of Jesus Christ and by the faith of Jesus Christ that that man rose up and walked so that means Jesus Christ is here to work outside of your ability and put in you his own power praise the Lord and this is what the story of Gideon highlights to us is in Prophecy it's highlighting the work of Jesus Christ the strength of God flowed through the weakness not the ability of Gideon because Gideon really will find out was afraid and if anybody could teach somebody else about fear it was Gideon and now that same trait is coming to his son of fear you see it Carries On just like Abraham Under Pressure would tell a lie so would Isaac Vaughn natural traits coming from your own abilities figure it out by your own reasoning extrapolating what's going to happen to you in the future as we've been preaching amen when when Satan comes into your reason and he tells you something Jesus said he's telling a lie and when he's speaking a lie he's talking about himself the fears he's trying to put on you is his own fears it's his own hopelessness he's lost his first estate you've got yours back he cannot be redeemed you can be redeemed he cannot receive the Holy Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost he cannot be restored you can be restored you're fully equipped I wonder how many of our young people are standing here tonight equipped with the sword in the final battle a battle that's already won I think Satan can stop this Rapture he can't stop it amen he's trying everything he he can do to produce his own body change through all this perversion that's going on in this hour amen trying to teach the young people that they don't need the permission of their parents they want to if they want to transition into another sex and whatever more he's trying to produce his own body change I don't need his permission I don't need his permission to leave his Camp I don't need his permission Amen to leave what he's trying to place upon Me For Greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world see I found out myself my own self that God don't need my ability amen he needs me to be patient with his I learn patience you know I know that's a dangerous statement to make brother Paul usually I learned patience and you're like oh it means you're totally patient I never said that I said learn patience amen God will teach it to you because patience they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength so Gideon himself knew what it was like to be fearful he was a coward and then when God met him and see this is the principle of the message you can find this in the Book of Judges this is the principle of the message this is the only time in the Book of Judges you'll find a prophet coming to the people and and here the principle the message a prophet comes and points him to a God who is the same yesterday today and forever in his mighty power and how he brought him out of Egypt and how he delivered them with his mighty hand he said but you have not obeyed his voice now this is the amazing thing is that they have been living under this torment for seven years God delivered them into that and they were sons of God living in the Promised Land and they went under captivity willingly sons of God captive in the place God has put them what a shame that with all the resources that God had promised to watch over that land and that land will always provide for you if you stay with my word but if you begin to bring the idols in that the other nations have amen you're going to lose that what happened they begin to worship other gods you know it's important to know who the midianites are they are the descendants of Midian who is the son of Abraham from his second wife get her up the Bible says that when his son those Sons got older from that second wife that he sent them away from Isaac and sent them to the east he wanted a separation between amen the promise seed and the the children of the second wife and they sent him away with gifts so they didn't leave with nothing they went away with gifts and and and they lived in the east I think it's a very important note to bring into Focus here that these are descendants of those who had relationship with Abraham but not according to the promise you'll find this nature and every false Doctrine every false movement anything associated with the truth that's not of God they all have this in common they lack that promised birth Midian begins to pop up here and there in the scripture after he sent him away to the east you can find them there they're the ones who who was also in the selling of Joseph uh they took them and and the ishmaelites came and and then and there and then they helped in the selling of Joseph and then you'll find out they're also close relation of course to Ishmael and they both have it in common they both were sent away man their relations with a grudge but you'll find the midianites most prominently in the time of Moses because it's something that when God sends a prophet there's people that rise to prominence in that time because of that influence of that prophet my if it hadn't been for that Prophet you might not ever hear of them right but there's a benefit of God sending a prophet and and you find that when when Moses fled from pharaoh and he went down to Midian he marries the daughter of of the prayer the priest of Midian Jethro and he lives there until he receives his commission to go back and deliver Israel from Egypt and so in that time Israel and Midian have a friendly relationship actually it's very strong ties that they have together numbers 10 tells us a midianite acted as a guide for Israel in their wonderings in the wilderness Moses invited him to stay with them and go into the promised land with them but something happened between Israel and Midian to rupture their relationship that was found in numbers 22. and there Balaam become involved they find this is a spirit that becomes prevalent it's prevalent at this hour and it's prevalent in the church ages is the spirit of Balaam Balaam become involved in this relationship and he he suggested that one of the princes of Midian would use his daughter and connected her with a leader in Israel you see because Satan attacks the leaders and so much did it rupture that relationship that it was the midianite women which seduced the Israelite men and it resulted in a Slaughter in which also Balaam was killed in fact the Lord said Vex the midianites for they Smite and smite him for they vexed you with their Wiles that's the last battle that Moses oversaw before he was taken home was to deal with these midianites the midianites out of whom he took a wife out of whom you've had a relationship with and now he has commanded you Vex them because they have vexed you amen so this is a major separation between these two Nations who are Step Brothers in relation you know Satan is a master at destroying relationships that Spirit of Balaam is still alive and he knows how to connect leaders to bring trouble cause problems in the camp of the lord we all know the story of Balaam Balaam was a hireling prophet he could go either way he could speak the words of God or he could speak the words of man and he was hired by balak the moabites Lots children because they didn't want to have anything to do with Israel coming through their land if they knew Israel was a successful people that God was with him that the power of God was manifest amongst them and signs and wonders and healings and deliverances and there was a prophet there who was carrying the word of God and the shadow of the king is in the camp and so they hired a prophet to come speak something against these people curse them find something bad about Moses find something bad about the young people find something bad about Israel because God is going to have to curse him Moses uh excuse me Balaam tried to do it amen he wished he told he told balak he said I'm going to go ask the Lord for permission and and if he tells me I can I will if he tells me I can't I can't do it so he went and asked the Lord and the Lord says no you can't do it these are my people so he goes back to bed he said I can't do it Bennett said I'll give you more money I give you more money to leave the word I'll give you success he made an offering to a man that has truly gifted truly equipped he was in a position he could really help the people but his appetite his ability so he went back and he said well I'm going to go back and ask the Lord again and the Lord came and he said you go and speak but you're only going to say what I put in your mouth so he goes and as he goes we know the story he's met by an Angel of the Lord and he doesn't see him but his animal sees him right and the animal won't go and then we see Balaam caught into a fit of road rage and he tries to beat his animal up you imagine how horrible it looked him having having a temper fit and he's beating his animal and the animal turns and speaks to him haven't I been good to you you see somebody talking to themself this could be what's going on but that animal saw the angel of the Lord and when because of that action it opened the eyes of this prophet and he saw the angel of the Lord so when he went up and balik said listen let's go over here and I can show you some things about these folks in the message and we can find a place God's going to have to curse them no matter what he saw wrong with them God would not allow them to be cursed let me tell you that's the same God today no matter what flaws no matter what failures you might find amongst the people amen this is God's promise when you reach out and try to do something about it you are touching God's anointed [Applause] could God's anointed have failures can they have backslidings oh yes they can you're still in your human body amen but the shadow of the king is in the camp the word of a prophet is amongst us God is with us this this influence he's he said I can only and some of the most beautiful prophecies in scripture flowed out of Balaam and the king of King balak said listen don't say anything at all you're not doing any good for me here so we went back but Balaam didn't forget and he realized you know what I can get God to deal with him in death I want to tell you God hated it then and he hates it now he hates immorality amen it's not a church flying a rainbow flag and flying in all inclusion and everything God hates immorality he doesn't hate you he hates immorality so he will change your life he'll clean you up you're not out without resource and there was the rift there was this this deep hatred and enmity now between these started when a false prophet a hireling prophet ruptured that relationship Midian is the main figure in Israel against Israel at this time so as we said Midian was a friend and a relative but we're not born of the same promise you know we have a lot of folks leaving the message they'll be friends for a while but there become enemies when balaamism comes among them because the spirit of balamism is looking for someone to teach when the Bible tells us in chapter 6 that they join Confederacy this is what Spirits do they join Confederacy with amalek who is the children of Esau who's he saw he's a man who did not value the birthright but he found it easy to sell it out for a moment of appetite there's already been a prophecy over these boys the Elder Shall Serve the younger the prophecy is Holy it's from God Jacob was in line for that Birthright but the mother got involved I trust this is all right the mother got involved and she somewhere along the line because the parents were riffed and they separated in their affections over their children they both amen amen they tried to manufacture what God Said when God had already said Jacob's going to get the birthright when the time for Birthright the promise uh the blessing was to be given amen the church Rebecca knew about it and she's called Jacob in and said listen your father has called Esau and says come and say let's pray he's gonna he's gonna give the blessing he said and she said he's going to go out and he's going to kill and bring venison the venison stew that your father likes I know how to make that and here I got your brother's clothes I'm going to put them upon you and I'm going to make that stew and you're going to take it in and you're going to get the blessing that your brother is supposed to get you see the problem of it is Jacob is trying to get that blessing wearing someone else's coat you all right good can I have your coat it ain't gonna fit me I don't mean that wrong we're just you know sometimes young people we feel like we got to wear someone else's coat to get the blessing you know God did not call me to to be uh uh brother Paul um I've healed the pool I hear the call and I know his spear brother Samuel he never asked me to be him but somehow we feel like we got to have we got to all have the same experience because a church tells us how to do it [Music] and the church knows how to make a good stew and where they're saying if I wear the clothes of brother Paul I'm going to get the blessing of the father I smell like him praise God I got it no you don't get it it's going to cause you a lot of trouble trying to act like somebody else [Music] you think because you shout like somebody jump like somebody run like somebody you got it God never asked you to imitate anybody else he asked you to have your own experience get your own he never asked me to act like brother Paul or brother Samuel or anybody else [Applause] God is not here to give a church birth he predestinates it he predestinates your moment of the Holy Ghost it can't be taught into you come on a mother can put a coat on you and bake up a stew and I don't think he makes stew cook up a stew amen it's not going to give you the Holy Ghost [Applause] you've got to get it by meeting him slowly face to face where God talks to you and you talk back to him if you're a Son of God that's how he meets you it's a nice coat thank you brother one day I'm going to grow into it I remember brother Paul I I did this I was a number of years ago I'm not telling you these things that tell you where I've been I'm telling you things to help you God can use these simple things like this and you don't even know what he's doing and it was 2019 and I was way in the north and India we was in a convention and there was there was a bunch of ministers setting over over on this side and there's a man caught my attention he was big and tall set right on the front he had this nice shiny suit on nice silver shiny suit he's just looking at me and I I can't speak uh their language and and so I'm preaching and brother Roshan is interpreting and I'm talking about Jacob getting the blessing trying to get it and and I they kept getting attracted to that man didn't know why so I went over there and I said man give me your coat he looked at me like I I had asked him to give me everything he ever owned he looked real scared and he took his coat off and again he just stared he never made a smile he never did anything he just gave it to me and I went over to him and I knelt down before him sorry brother Paul I just don't have to do this they need to get awake and so do you amen bless me father bless me the only guyzek was laughing okay yes and and I said and here's a blind prophet being deceived I said God don't want you with another man's coat and that man stared at me and there was a young man in the back this is where the ministers he began to rejoice and Shout I didn't know have a clue what was going on took the coat off he CK yeah help me thank you sorry you take that to the cleaners amen I took the coat off and a man put it on he got up and left thanks for the coat don't leave he got up and left I had no idea what was going on I did not know that man was the Pentecostal overseer of the area and the young man in the back was trying to receive the message and that man was telling him that the message was wrong and I was calling that man a blind prophet and a guy was trying to receive a blessing wearing the wrong coat and just that simple illustration I had no idea that the Holy Ghost was the one doing it that's simple illustration of a man trying to wear another man's coat to receive God's blessing delivered that young man that same God is here tonight that young man might have went up to the meeting and didn't know God had already equipped him to be delivered he'll deliver you because he's already equipped you blessed be the name of the Lord you can't get it wearing someone else's coat he have joined Confederacy with amalek and Esau I won't hold you much longer and the children of the East Ishmael hear all real relatives do you see what's happening here all of these are relatives relatives of Israel someone close tormenting the people of God and the reason their torment was successful was because Israel was addicted to idols Jewish historians said in that time they were so addicted to Idols that They Carried little images in their pockets to take out and look at them once in a while they must have been called eye idols [Music] Hallelujah are and idols you'll get it later can you imagine they they would take them out of their pocket so addicted in the and the and the famine was so severe that it drove Israel out of their homes their homes were were in shambles and they lived in the dens in the caves God sent a prophet in the midst of that idolatry and brother bam said that here's getting behind a wine press trying to thrust some wheat afraid of the enemy because the enemy would come up with camels without number can you imagine the terror that was upon them with these these and these engines of War coming through their places and they were defenseless to fight against sons of God could not overcome lust and could not overcome the things of the world they was helpless in the face of this flood and here they are hiding and Gideon's back here he's hiding but God has sent a prophet and this is the pattern he's used today because if you realize this this hour was so significant in the history of Israel that that when Isaiah began to prophesy about the coming of the Lord he said it would be like the day of Midian go back and read it this will be like the day of Midian what was the day of Midian total victory but it started with conviction a war cannot be won without conviction God don't hand something to you that you don't care about you can have a sword hanging on your side but if you don't know how to use it and you don't care of it it's of no benefit to you to quote a quote the Bible said they came up without number and every time they would have a harvest they came up and would destroy their increase you see that's the characteristic of Satan every time you have a good service he'll come in and hear Robert from you the next day your cause something to happen maybe in relationships something to happen I don't know I'm not somebody affected by thumbs up or thumbs down on on Facebook and everything else I'm not that person because I don't have a profile sorry you don't have to be quiet I didn't condemn you if you have one I said I'm not affected by thumbs up or thumbs down it don't it don't blow my mind that I don't have a hundred friends and I don't worry about a nameless person that I've never met that they don't like me and they disagree with me and don't Hey listen amen the other day I had I had I had a man who used to be in my church he was a minister and he he's left the message and he started texting me at 11 30 at night on Saturday night I had to preach the next morning he started texting me it ended up being like 30 or 34 texts and started accusing me that I'm I'm I I know that I'm following a deceiver and you're lying to the people and the only reason you're keeping the church is to keep the money flow going and I don't expect you to answer but because you don't answer you're a coward 11 30 at nights and I gotta preach in the morning glory to God I wanted to wear another man's coat and I sat there and I asked the Lord I said do you want me to answer this man and he said do not cast your pearls [Applause] so I said Thank You Lord and I took out the enemy's text and I did block and I don't know if he's ever touched me since because I don't have to listen to it I want you to know you don't have to listen to what the devil tells you he is a line to you come on somebody he's a liar he tells you this message is wrong he's a liar if he tells you it's a false prophet he's a liar God is already Vindicated it now he's manifesting it and he's acting some young person why don't you draw your sword and destroy those two kings they can't hurt you they're already defeated [Applause] Glory so I found this Divine button called block I love it brother Mann said Jesus didn't clown around for the devil when he said show me a miracle he didn't show him anything amazing the only time that Herod and pilate became friends when they was both crucifying Jesus Christ some folks were never friends in life until they've all come under the conclusion brother random's wrong I'm telling you they got the same crucifying spirit in them that was there at that day amen but I won't wanna I don't want to be identified with that I wanted to be identified with those that stay in this hour and draw the sword that God has given me of this message he can't tell me it's true God has already Vindicated it in my life he has spoke over my life with this message you cannot tell me it doesn't work [Applause] it'll work over you I don't know how long you have Youth Services dude they go a long time like to midnight or something okay all right I am just now starting to feel untired and good that's very dangerous [Applause] oh I never set my timer ah I got to tell you another testimony you know brother Gideon I I once was a young Preacher Brother Samuel was too right how old are you brother Samuel praise the Lord he's old I'm 54. I want to ask you how you how old you are but I know ARP is talking to you all the time they talk to me I think I was around 27 or so I hope this is all right because only trying to tell you how God works through weakness I can tell you I I'd like to tell you how big and bold and strong I am but I want to tell you about times that I didn't even want to preach and I sure didn't want to do the work of the Lord can I tell you about it yet God had totally equipped me you know but I was I was on the mission field and I I was down in in the middle of nowhere in Guyana South America and I had flown down there with a pastor I had flown into the interior way back by the Brazil border and we're going to minister to the Indians in these in this Village and his village is disconnected from from in any any town or anything it's like 70 miles to the nearest town and we fly in there on this little puddle jumper and the brother had told me prior to going in there he says we're going to we're going to buy tickets to get in we're not going to buy tickets to get out he said when we get there we give the remaining money to some of the Indian brothers and then go buy a ticket for while we're there who's going to be there eight days and have have a Revival yeah a Revival of eight days and I'm American I like return flights I like to know that if I get in I'm getting out this was prior to the days of the idol bail and well I'm getting drunk we didn't have cell phones we had nothing I'm down there to do the work of the Lord you can only take about 24 pounds in with you we're going to be there a week that means your clothes your Bible whatever material you're going to take so I took two books the Bible a notepad and some clothes and beef jerky because that's very important praise the Lord and I I took with me Church age book and demonology that's what you want to take on the mission field so I hope this is all right brother Paul I got a ticket in but I don't have one out so I told that Pastor he's a black brother and I told him I said uh my brother I said uh you know we don't plan that way we we get our tickets to come out here I am Young I got the ability to preach glory be to God totally equipped I'm gonna go expound to the needy did you turn me off no okay I just wondered you know we get in this mind that everything's glamorous I had a guy tell me one time brother Michael said boy it must be nice to travel around the world and preach I said go do it I told that brother I said we don't work like that we get a ticket in we get a ticket out he goes man don't worry about it everything's gonna be okay so of course then she gave me that advice I worried about it because that's what good people do we worry until it consumes us it was funny as I was flying down into Guyana from America I I pulled out a magazine out of the back and it started talking about a woman that that lived way back in this area he was gone go to she was a British woman she ran some kind of resort or something and and that and she just talked about the place I read I don't know that's nice I closed it up went well we get we get on the airplane so I asked the brother I said Is there going to be anybody pick us up he goes no I said well do you know where this Village is he goes it's somewhere in that direction don't worry about it now I did not know this whole mission trip was constructed to help Danny not the natives even though it did but God wanted me to learn something called patience because you're going to need it to wait upon the Lord and I I got so consumed with worry and me and him bickered and argued and I said that's not how we work we got people that know we're cut that pick us up and everything it was it was us Brothers us two brothers on this plane and they had put a big painting in the airplane in the cargo search I didn't know what it was and and so as we're flying down to the middle of nowhere to land on this airstrip where nobody is to pick us up I asked him um uh you know what direction he didn't know and then he started saying you know there's something wrong well great I already am not getting back home now there's something wrong and he goes something something bad is wrong I didn't know the brother's coming down with malaria but he goes there's something wrong and I go yeah there must be there's something wrong with me we land and there's a Jeep waiting there and it's not waiting for us it's waiting for the painting nobody's there to pick us up there the painting was more important than the preachers and the brother asked him said hey can we hitch a ride with you we're trying to get over to this this Village he said they said yeah hop in we'll take you over to this Farm maybe they can get you there we ended up at this Village nobody came to get us but we ended up and the whole time he's telling me don't worry about and I worried about it we fought you know we're on the mission field we're there for the glory of God walking in his inspiration fighting like cats and dogs he calls me a little child and I called him an old woman I'm sorry it's just the way it was we're there to have a meeting see you thought with preachers is all Halos and prayer meetings I'm trying to help you you know here's a young preacher brother Desmond told me he's went on bless his heart he's went on to be with the Lord now we became real close friends don't think we became enemies we became real close friends we we laughed about that until the day he died I mean you know he's a little child and you're an old woman it was we had great identification with one another and and uh and he said listen he said I can't preach he said you're going to have to preach now I'm there eight days I went into a deep depression I got to be honest a deep depression because number one I'm not getting back home I have no return ticket I got to preacher Revival meeting while I'm depressed track that's how it was I Can't Describe to you how much depression came down upon me so I went because I was depressed I went and laid in the hammock under tree and tried to study so of course because I'm depressed I pulled out demonology it's a good sermon to go along with how I'm feeling you feel oppressed let's look about demons you know how they work so I did and you know I opened up that book and and the first thing I saw is brother Graham says now on the mission field I said uh on the mission field he began to talk about all the dangers and the snakes and the mosquito just touch you you got malaria and he says then at the end of it he says but don't worry about it Lord will go before you and wave it all out of the way now I gotta tell you to my fault I read that it never moved my meter one bit I'm going to tell you about the glory of God the brother came to me he's sick he's like give me your money I gave him it was eighty dollars my last money on Earth I gave to him and he gave it to an Indian brother and the Indian brother strapped a live pig to the back of a bicycle and bicycled 70 miles and he was going to meet us at the end of the eight days so I did not know for eight days when I was going home when I wanted to last I solved my money was when the piggy was gone to the market literally literally it wasn't funny then I'd like to tell you that I got up and preached messages that soared like the angels but I can't remember a word that I preached telling you that to my shame but also to his glory because if you're in the will of God he's going to teach you to wait upon him and that if you're facing something that you don't know how it's going to work out he's saying you just wait upon me see if jesser had realized who it was that it was inspiring that man Gideon it was that man that he met after the prophet came that said get in you're a mighty man of Valor Gideon's like how am I that I'm the weakest one in my family I'm at the bottom of all this bad gene pool and God says no you're a mighty man of Fowler amen he actually attached his own name to Gideon because you look up mighty man it's Gabor and God is called a Mighty Man a warrior and he attached his own name to a cowards and asked him now before you win this battle go home to your father's house and chop down the Groves and the idols because before you can have victory Idols have got to be gone that's the same God that was with me and Guyana now I want to tell you this story I preach and I don't remember a thing I preached brother Paul but all I know is the chief's father came to us at the end of the meeting and we was getting ready to leave to go find out if we was going home and you asked me did you make it home what do you think this is not my ghost is the chief's father come to me this was on the morning we're leaving after eight days he comes to me and he's a Jehovah Witness and he said I had a dream last night and he said I dreamed that two angels came to the Village a black angel and a white angel if I'd have known better I'd asked did the white one look depressed now I want you to know how God was representing me while I wasn't representing him and he told this man in this dream these two angels have visited your village and he showed him two trees he said one tree represents what he preached and this other tree the message he preached and the other tree represents your denomination take your knife and strike the false tree God gave him a challenge to believe and he said I took my knife and I struck that tree of Jehovah Witness now I want you to know here I am depressed wanting to get home but because I was doing what God had asked to do it was God that done the equipping my ability had nothing to do with him I did not want to be there but God still showed up young people that's what I'm trying to tell you if Jester had realized that was the god that was standing by his side it was more than his father Peter just drawn that sword and finished what God asked him to finish he would not have died in the next chapter but I want to tell you this is your night to rewrite what that young man could not do oh yes let me for don't let me forget you asked me did it work out yeah you know we're walking through that Village 80 miles away and we're walking there in that Indian stepped around the corner of the big old gap tooth grin and he pulled out his back pocket two tickets it was glorious the whole time I look back on that and God said now listen if you would just wait upon me and you quit worrying I'll work it out I'll work it out through people you think it won't work out through I will finish the work that you think cannot be finished I don't need your ability I just need you God prove that to me down there in Guyana because it wasn't my ability my ability when we take me back home but God's word showed up and he finished what he started you believe that same God of tear tonight [Applause] young people you're not jether your sons and daughters of God and he's equipped you in this moment to draw your sword don't be afraid to do it amen don't be afraid because your father showed you how to do it and it's a battle that's already won I want you to think the things you're struggling with tonight and you don't think you can overcome and the enemies told you you can't overcome it these are enemies that have already been defeated they've already lost their power every demon of lust has already been defeated amen every demon of worthlessness and hopelessness and depression and nervousness and cancer and high blood pressure every one of these diseases have been defeated by our Lord he's just asking you pull the sword and show proof of his victory at Calgary having say amen that's what I want to do Hallelujah stand with me tonight Hallelujah I mean raise their hands and say Lord I'm going to draw the sword I'm gonna draw the sword amen you've asked me Amen to finish this work that you've already done Hallelujah God bless you tonight we love you with the love of the Lord I trust at what we say maybe you're just somebody put some courage in your heart because it's not your ability this thing's finished with it's not how well you argue the message don't even do it try to reason with unbelief use the block button [Applause] come on church this message this message is a life it's not who can say the quotes the best this message is the life of Jesus Christ and the life of Jesus Christ being revealed through yours God bless you tonight we love you with the love of the Lord God bless you brother Paul come on Hallelujah oh why was I preaching with this
