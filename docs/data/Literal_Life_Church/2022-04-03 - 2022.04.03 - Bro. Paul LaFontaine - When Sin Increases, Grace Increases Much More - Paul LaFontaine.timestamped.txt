[0:00] death by sin and so death passed upon
[0:03] all men
[0:04] for that all have sinned for until the
[0:07] law sin was in the world but sin is not
[0:10] imputed when there is no law
[0:12] nevertheless death reigned
[0:14] from adam to moses even over them that
[0:17] had not sinned after the similitude of
[0:20] adam's transgression who is the figure
[0:22] of him that was to come so that's what's
[0:25] that saying there is that
[0:27] death reigned from adam to moses
[0:29] remember moses is the one that brought
[0:30] the law so death was reigning and
[0:34] it says even over them that had not
[0:36] sinned after the sentiment to adam in
[0:37] other words you didn't do what adam did
[0:39] but you became
[0:41] you took the sin nature because of his
[0:43] fall all of us come under sin all of us
[0:46] are born the wrong way so even though
[0:48] you didn't technically do that all have
[0:50] all become under that
[0:52] that act back in the garden and that
[0:54] fall from god we all come underneath it
[0:56] i want you to notice something here
[0:58] though now but not as the offense so
[1:00] also as the free gift so now he's going
[1:02] to be in talking about grace talk about
[1:04] sin talking about grace but not as the
[1:07] offense so also is the free gift for if
[1:10] through the offense of one
[1:12] many be dead
[1:13] much more the grace of god and the gift
[1:16] by grace which is by one man jesus
[1:19] christ hath abounded unto many so the
[1:23] principle is still true that if one man
[1:25] fell and we receive the blood of all of
[1:27] it and we could be
[1:29] we become sinners and we come under sin
[1:31] it's a trickle-down effect if that
[1:33] principle is true then by one man and
[1:35] his sacrifice at calvary we come under
[1:38] the grace of god can you say amen
[1:41] because you can't apply it to one and
[1:42] not apply it to the other and guess what
[1:45] you didn't deserve what adam did but you
[1:47] don't deserve the grace of god but you
[1:48] get it anyway
[1:51] amen
[1:53] and not as it was by one that sinned so
[1:56] is the gift and i'll read this a few
[1:58] minutes from now in the amplified but
[2:00] and and not as a it was by one that sin
[2:03] so is the gift for the judgment was by
[2:06] one to condemnation but the free gift is
[2:09] of many offenses unto justification for
[2:12] if by one man's offense death reigned by
[2:15] one
[2:16] much more they which receive abundance
[2:19] of grace now
[2:20] you're going to start seeing words in
[2:22] these scriptures about the grace of god
[2:24] abounding abundance of the grace of god
[2:27] and of the gift of righteousness in
[2:29] another place in the scripture uh paul
[2:32] mentions the god who's rich
[2:35] in mercy
[2:37] not just mercy but he has to be rich in
[2:39] mercy for us
[2:41] amen abundance of grace so much more
[2:43] they which receive abundance of grace of
[2:46] the gift of righteousness shall reign in
[2:48] life by one jesus christ
[2:50] therefore as by the offense of one
[2:53] judgment came upon all men to
[2:56] condemnation none of you
[2:58] are are an exception
[3:01] to being born in sin and coming under
[3:02] that sin of adam none of you this
[3:04] morning are an exception to i don't care
[3:05] how good we feel we are we've all come
[3:07] under sin
[3:09] amen
[3:10] therefore as by one offense of one
[3:12] judgment came upon all men to
[3:13] condemnation even so by the
[3:16] righteousness of one the free gift came
[3:19] upon all men unto justification of life
[3:22] for as by one man's disobedient many
[3:26] were made sinners so by the obedience of
[3:29] one shall many be made righteous
[3:35] moreover now watch watch the little
[3:37] change here moreover the law entered
[3:40] because the law didn't enter to moses so
[3:43] you got the fall you got man come under
[3:45] sin
[3:46] and then he says moreover the law
[3:48] entered
[3:49] that the offense might abound so after
[3:52] the law came
[3:54] then something happens in other words
[3:56] the sin actually multiplied
[3:59] the guilt and the condemnation why did
[4:01] that multiply after the law because
[4:03] before the law you didn't know you were
[4:04] doing wrong
[4:05] you didn't know you were sinning
[4:07] but now you put the law of god in there
[4:09] now you say now i know what i'm doing
[4:11] wrong and it actually without the grace
[4:13] of god it actually makes us feel more
[4:15] sinful
[4:17] when god points out what we're doing
[4:19] wrong then you really start to feel oh
[4:21] my do i never do i ever need
[4:25] the lord
[4:27] right
[4:28] so it multiplies it abounds
[4:31] when god brings his word
[4:34] the prophet said it this way sin becomes
[4:37] exceedingly sinful in the presence of
[4:40] the lord
[4:45] moreover the law entered that the
[4:46] offense might abound
[4:48] but this is the this is my my service
[4:52] but where sin
[4:54] abounded
[4:55] multiplied
[4:57] grace
[4:58] did much more abound
[5:02] you ought to raise your hand it's a good
[5:03] thing that it works that way
[5:06] there's something greater than our sin
[5:08] there's something that's abounding
[5:10] greater than the heap of sin
[5:12] and that's the grace of god
[5:14] so i want to title this when sin
[5:16] increases grace
[5:18] increases much more
[5:20] father bless your word and bless every
[5:22] heart that's here help us to get in the
[5:24] channel that you've given us lord just a
[5:26] portion just one preacher in the body of
[5:29] christ i can't do it all but i give my
[5:32] gift to you and i pray your minister to
[5:33] these precious souls in jesus name we
[5:36] ask him amen god bless you may be seated
[5:39] now in last sunday in zechariah chapter
[5:42] 4
[5:42] we read about the headstone which is
[5:45] christ comes in the last days
[5:47] and
[5:48] there was a great great shouting and
[5:50] crying that went forth to identify what
[5:53] that headstone was coming in the last
[5:55] days and you remember that the shouting
[5:57] was crying uh what that was coming to us
[6:00] when christ comes to us in the last days
[6:02] as the headstone
[6:04] then there was we could call it whatever
[6:07] we could call it but in that particular
[6:09] incident in zechariah the cry that went
[6:11] out the shouting went out calling it
[6:13] what it was and they begin to shout
[6:15] grace grace grace though it could be
[6:19] called revelation because headstone rock
[6:22] means a revelation so it's a great
[6:24] revelation coming to us in the end time
[6:26] the greatest revelation of christ has
[6:29] hit us in the last days the this planet
[6:32] earth has never received a greater
[6:34] revelation of jesus christ than in the
[6:36] last days so we could say it's greater
[6:38] revelation coming to us they could shout
[6:41] the power of god has come to us they
[6:43] could shout it's the message of the last
[6:45] days they could call it anything they
[6:48] want but yet they called it they shouted
[6:50] grace it's grace grace and they shouted
[6:54] grace unto it and grace is the unmerited
[6:58] favor of god to save us
[7:02] you didn't deserve it can you say man
[7:05] and with the name and what they shouted
[7:07] you could give many names to what this
[7:08] message is but when it came to us in the
[7:11] last days and by the way it has come the
[7:13] shouting was this is grace
[7:16] it's a message of grace
[7:19] without it we're lost
[7:21] without it we're caught in satan's eaten
[7:23] without it we're caught without it we
[7:25] have no hope for our sons and daughters
[7:27] without it we have no hope of the last
[7:29] days we would caught be caught in sodom
[7:32] and gomorrah but god sends a message of
[7:34] grace to get us out of here
[7:37] hallelujah and so when they they shouted
[7:40] grace grace that sits with another
[7:42] passage that's the same thing coming in
[7:44] revelations five and we have this vision
[7:47] that john has of the last last day's
[7:49] events and that is that they found that
[7:52] someone was supposed to come and take
[7:54] the title book or the title deed back
[7:56] that was lost in adam in the beginning
[7:58] someone was taken back but they couldn't
[8:00] find anybody worthy they couldn't find
[8:02] anybody worthy nobody no man no matter
[8:05] how pious they were no matter how
[8:07] religious no matter if they were a
[8:09] prophet of god when they scanned
[8:11] everyone no man was found worthy or
[8:14] deserving to take the book and give it
[8:16] back to the people and the lamb's book
[8:18] of life they nobody was worthy of it so
[8:21] if that's true then that's the way the
[8:23] prophet said it if nobody comes and
[8:24] takes the book of redemption back then
[8:26] all of creation is lost
[8:29] we're finished can you say man
[8:31] and guess what nobody was worthy there
[8:34] was nobody deserving to come and take
[8:36] this book we were in a state there was
[8:38] nothing that nothing to take the book
[8:40] the climax
[8:42] when in the end time when the climax of
[8:44] sin would come upon all of us and we
[8:46] would be caught in laodicea and caught
[8:48] in satan's eden and the the sin would
[8:51] heap around this whole world to a spot
[8:54] to a place that it's almost
[8:55] unexplainable it's almost unexplainable
[8:58] the sin that is around us
[9:02] and it's in that day
[9:04] if something somebody didn't come and
[9:06] step forth all creation is lost we're
[9:09] doomed i hate to say that
[9:11] and just say it to make it simple
[9:13] without the grace of god in the last
[9:14] days we're all doomed
[9:16] no matter how no matter how good we
[9:18] think of ourselves
[9:20] and you know we always when we when we
[9:22] identify ourselves we always come out
[9:24] smelling like a rose pretty good
[9:26] you see
[9:27] but even in our best state the bible
[9:29] says every man at his absolute best
[9:32] state
[9:33] is still vanity
[9:39] scripture is so honest and so my
[9:41] goodness that sure don't fit in a
[9:43] positive thinking seminar does it
[9:45] or building up your
[9:47] self-esteem
[9:49] the truth is the truth at our best state
[9:52] we can't get ourselves out of the
[9:54] judgments that are coming
[9:56] at our best state we can't work our way
[9:58] back to god
[10:00] he has to come in his grace
[10:03] someone had to come worthy and so in
[10:05] this incident in revelations 5 you can
[10:07] read it
[10:08] jesus referred to the inn and he said he
[10:10] even said in matthew 24 he said except
[10:13] those days in the last days except they
[10:15] be shortened no flesh would be saved in
[10:18] other words accept the grace of god
[10:20] shorten those days and he didn't step in
[10:23] all flesh would be destroyed all fast
[10:25] even christians and all all flesh would
[10:27] be there wouldn't be no flesh saved
[10:29] except those days be shortened and
[10:32] that's the days that you live in if it
[10:34] continues to go like it is unless the
[10:37] grace of god comes in no flesh will ever
[10:40] be saved we're finished we're done can
[10:42] you say amen
[10:44] but the grace of god everything's lost
[10:46] and there it is and the title deed is
[10:48] gonna is is no one can take it nobody's
[10:51] worthy and that's when a lamb steps into
[10:55] john's vision and emerges forth into
[10:57] john's vision
[10:58] oh praise god a lamb steps forth and if
[11:02] you know your bible it was the lamb that
[11:05] god provided when adam and eve fell it
[11:07] was the lamb all the way around can you
[11:09] say man because something had to be in
[11:12] our place that was pure and sinless and
[11:15] the priest would go get that lamb and he
[11:17] would examine it he didn't examine you
[11:20] he examined the lamb and found it
[11:22] flawless it had to be perfect it was the
[11:24] only one worthy and he took that for our
[11:27] sin and he says this is a flawless lamb
[11:30] so now when we have the lamb jesus
[11:32] christ
[11:33] step it into this vision and the vision
[11:35] says he's got that book in his hand why
[11:38] he's the only one worthy to take the
[11:41] book
[11:44] so
[11:45] our lamb steps into the vision
[11:48] and
[11:50] he
[11:51] why because he's worthy
[11:54] and now read your bible i don't have
[11:56] time to go there
[11:57] just like in zechariah 4
[11:59] the shouts begin
[12:02] the worship begins
[12:06] and it's all about worthiness in other
[12:08] words it said thou art worthy of this
[12:10] lamb somebody was worthy and he stepped
[12:13] forth for me and the shouts begin and
[12:15] the worship begins worthy is the lamb
[12:18] that was slain worthy you know what
[12:20] they're shouting about you should be
[12:22] shouting about this morning
[12:24] if nobody come and take that book nobody
[12:26] worthy we're finished and none of you
[12:27] were worthy no prophets worthy william
[12:30] branham wasn't worthy
[12:31] isaiah wasn't moses wasn't worthy none
[12:34] of them were worthy to take this book
[12:35] only one the lamb jesus christ is the
[12:38] only one worthy and he steps forth
[12:40] because of grace for you and he takes
[12:42] that book
[12:43] [Applause]
[12:46] and
[12:47] so the shout says thou art worthy thou
[12:50] art worthy the shouts begin i in other
[12:52] words are saying i wasn't worthy but
[12:55] grace made me worthy he put me back in
[12:57] favor with god he redeemed us back to
[13:00] god and he's made us kings and priests
[13:04] he's put how do you be a king and priest
[13:06] of royalty he says he puts you back into
[13:09] favor with god he by his grace puts you
[13:12] back in the graces of god
[13:15] hallelujah
[13:17] all right so from the beginning
[13:20] in the fall
[13:22] when it first happens
[13:24] then
[13:25] adam and eve after they sin
[13:28] they recognize they're naked
[13:30] and they have no covering for it
[13:32] and they hide
[13:34] they hide in the bushes
[13:36] and so they're they're hiding and
[13:40] and so
[13:41] they're hiding from god they feel guilt
[13:43] they feel shame because it's not just
[13:45] that they send it's the guilt that goes
[13:47] with it
[13:49] i don't feel worthy to talk to god
[13:51] anymore
[13:52] i don't feel worthy to pray anymore
[13:55] i don't feel worthy to even come i don't
[13:57] have the faith i know i don't have the
[13:59] favor of god anymore
[14:01] so i don't feel worthy to pray so i'm
[14:02] going to go hide and that's what we do
[14:07] we still do it
[14:10] we hide
[14:12] when we do something wrong or when we
[14:14] know that we're in sin
[14:15] we tend to escape into other things
[14:18] kind of relieve our guilt
[14:22] this is a
[14:24] the last 30 years has kind of been
[14:27] this term come out guilt-free
[14:29] guilt-free ice cream
[14:33] guilt-free food
[14:36] guilt-free give me why why do you think
[14:38] all that came out just the last 20 30
[14:39] years guilt-free because they want to
[14:41] provide something else that
[14:45] supposed to taste like the real thing
[14:48] but you can eat it and not feel the
[14:50] guilt
[14:52] but
[14:54] i don't like it
[14:58] rather wait a few weeks
[15:00] and get the real ice cream
[15:04] can i get a witness brother stephen
[15:08] it's all a really guilt so it's a
[15:10] reflection of man because the natural
[15:12] types of spiritual so that's how we
[15:14] relate so we start hiding because we
[15:16] feel the guilt it's not just that we did
[15:18] wrong but we feel guilt then we got a
[15:19] devil whisperer here you're you're a
[15:21] dirtbag you're finished you're done uh
[15:23] you'll never come into the graces of god
[15:25] again it's just you've got all that that
[15:27] voice is in your head and so now you
[15:29] throw yourself into religion you throw
[15:32] yourself into given to the poor you
[15:34] throw yourself into augments to make
[15:36] yourself look better but listen hey wait
[15:37] a minute wait a minute god has a place
[15:39] for you to come with your guilt god's
[15:41] already dealt with it at calvary
[15:43] he's dealt with your sin can you say man
[15:46] he's paid for your sin he's paid for
[15:48] your guilt and when a person comes truly
[15:51] to the lamb of god and turns their life
[15:53] over completely to him then he washes
[15:56] away all not only the sin but he washes
[15:58] away the guilt of sin
[16:02] that you can walk in the favor of god
[16:04] and know he's forgiven me
[16:06] he's justified me
[16:09] and i can come with boldness before the
[16:11] throne of
[16:12] grace
[16:14] i can approach scott again but they're
[16:16] over there hiding and you know what
[16:19] i love how brother ron spencer says it i
[16:21] always quote him you know like a third
[16:23] of the angels fell with lucifer before
[16:25] the beginning
[16:26] a third of the angels fall
[16:29] and there's not you don't see any action
[16:32] by god
[16:33] a third of the angels were influenced by
[16:35] lucifer to leave him and not worship him
[16:37] or to worship lucifer
[16:39] a third god doesn't do anything but one
[16:42] son adam
[16:43] falls
[16:45] and he rushes down to him right away
[16:59] adam where are you
[17:02] adam
[17:06] adam where are you
[17:09] because he does what we do we hide
[17:12] but you forgot one thing you're a son
[17:15] you're a daughter
[17:20] so just like us it's not running towards
[17:22] the lord megan first may say god i need
[17:25] you i fell in sin we should be doing
[17:27] that but most of the time we do it we
[17:29] escape into our little habits we escape
[17:31] into our thing to relieve our guilt but
[17:33] god doesn't want us to do that we should
[17:35] be running after him but guess what when
[17:37] you don't run after him he runs after
[17:39] you
[17:39] [Music]
[17:41] he comes and finds you
[17:46] it says adam
[17:48] steve
[17:50] mike
[17:52] doug
[17:54] [Applause]
[17:55] i'm looking for you where are you
[18:03] lord
[18:04] we're over here
[18:06] we're over here in the bushes
[18:08] oh my god we're covering ourselves
[18:12] what has happened god says what has
[18:14] happened
[18:15] don't you think he knows what happened
[18:18] but he wants you to confess it his
[18:20] brother diggs said
[18:21] he wants you to say it he wants you to
[18:23] admit it
[18:26] imagine adam's stepping out of and so
[18:28] god's saying i want i want you to come
[18:30] out
[18:32] and then when they come out they stand
[18:33] there they got the fig leaves over them
[18:35] and it's like the lord's saying
[18:37] what is that
[18:39] what are you wearing
[18:41] when we recognize we are naked we feel
[18:43] shame to come into your presence so
[18:45] we're covering ourselves with whatever
[18:46] we could find
[18:48] we're hiding behind it
[18:50] you don't think people are doing this
[18:52] even today
[18:53] you're hiding behind something right
[18:57] you're covering
[18:58] religion is a covering
[19:00] religion means covering
[19:04] so they cover it religion i'm a good
[19:05] person i love god they cover it and
[19:08] they're going to post all this stuff i'm
[19:10] okay i'm okay but you're not okay if
[19:12] you're under the guilt of sin and the
[19:14] guilt of leaving the word of god you're
[19:16] not okay
[19:17] just admit it you're not okay there's
[19:19] only one answer the true blood of jesus
[19:21] christ the bleeding word that comes
[19:22] through the word the blood of jesus
[19:24] christ
[19:25] so they step out said what are those
[19:27] those these are fig leaves that we sewed
[19:29] together we did it
[19:31] and so
[19:33] god just reaches over and grabs a bloody
[19:36] skin
[19:37] of a lamb
[19:38] that had already been taken care of and
[19:40] he takes it just blood just a mess and
[19:43] throws it over to him take those fig
[19:44] leaves off and put these animal skins on
[19:49] so he covers him in the right thing and
[19:50] why is he doing this
[19:52] because
[19:53] he wants some way to fellowship with his
[19:56] children again
[19:58] it won't be the ultimate blood yet but
[20:01] it gives us a place we can start talking
[20:03] again
[20:05] what is it what am i preaching on the
[20:07] grace of god
[20:09] the grace of god
[20:12] so so so he says you know can you
[20:14] imagine adam saying now what's happened
[20:16] god says what happens
[20:18] the woman
[20:19] it's the woman that begotten me
[20:24] she did it
[20:27] i can't believe i can't imagine him
[20:29] saying that in front of god but
[20:31] it's true to human nature as well i was
[20:34] the victim somebody else did me wrong
[20:40] blaming somebody else
[20:45] the woman she beguiled me
[20:48] so then god turns to the woman and the
[20:50] woman says
[20:52] the serpent
[20:55] now when you had oneness before
[20:58] in the marriage
[21:00] oneness says you're one
[21:02] so you're not going to blame one another
[21:04] if one falls the other falls with you
[21:07] because you're one right
[21:09] oneness was completely broken it's all
[21:11] her fault and he separates himself and i
[21:14] says himself i'm okay but it's the woman
[21:16] that you gave me lord
[21:22] wow we we say some really stupid things
[21:24] to god sometimes
[21:26] stupid things to come
[21:37] i wonder if any of you husbands have
[21:38] ever said something similar like that to
[21:40] god
[21:43] okay i'm gonna move on now
[21:47] this is the blame game it says somebody
[21:49] else
[21:50] should i talk about how there's millions
[21:52] of people
[21:53] that have left god because someone else
[21:56] did them wrong in the body of christ
[21:59] somebody else hurt me
[22:01] somebody else did me wrong
[22:03] but that i'll never relieve
[22:05] it's between you and god the guilt of
[22:07] sin
[22:08] it doesn't have to do with anybody else
[22:10] it has to be you and god
[22:12] and so this is how it happened and it's
[22:14] the mercy of god and you go to that
[22:17] here's my point this morning
[22:18] in the worst conditions that's when we
[22:21] need a god rich in mercy
[22:24] paul words it and he says you were dead
[22:27] in trespasses and sin but god who is
[22:30] rich in mercy quickened you
[22:34] you who were dead and trespasses in sin
[22:37] now friends you can't get any worse
[22:39] condition than dead
[22:42] but that's how it's worded when you're
[22:44] in the world without christ you are a
[22:46] dead walking living dead person
[22:48] doesn't the bible said that she liveth
[22:50] and pleasure is dead while she's living
[22:52] you're dead spiritually you're a dead
[22:54] person you can't get worse than a dead
[22:56] person you can't first get worse than
[22:59] dead when a person is dead it's
[23:01] permanent they're dead it's over it's
[23:03] finished except in jesus christ
[23:05] because in three days he rose again only
[23:08] in the kingdom of god is death not
[23:10] permanent can you say amen
[23:12] but in our understanding dead is dead
[23:14] you're dead if you're dead it's finished
[23:15] you can't get any worse than dead
[23:18] and yet in that condition of dead
[23:20] god rich in mercy
[23:24] says i can quicken the dead i can bring
[23:26] them to life
[23:29] so it was god rich in mercy running to
[23:32] adam and eve in the beginning this is
[23:34] what he began doing and it was the grace
[23:36] it was shouting's grace this is grace of
[23:38] god adam and eve should have been
[23:40] shouting grace grace god's grace
[23:44] i didn't deserve this but he's found a
[23:46] place of fellowship for me somehow
[23:51] now speed ahead 6 000 years and we come
[23:54] to the end of revelations 5 that i'm
[23:56] talking about and exactly the same
[23:59] things happened we're in a condition no
[24:01] man was found worthy no man was found
[24:04] deserving and so
[24:06] so after 6 000 years the final days just
[24:10] before judgment strikes the earth how
[24:12] many believe we're just a few days
[24:13] before judgment strikes the earth
[24:16] at those days god is still like in the
[24:18] garden drawing us out of our guilt and
[24:21] out of our hiding you know why i'm
[24:23] preaching it to you every week because i
[24:25] love you and i'm praying every sunday
[24:29] every time you're here i'm here i'll be
[24:31] here but you got to be here and i'm
[24:33] praying every time that you're here if
[24:35] you're hiding under anything or hiding
[24:38] away whatever it is i'm praying god
[24:40] anoint me because it's god inviting you
[24:42] to come out of your hiding come into a
[24:45] life of honesty before the lord
[24:48] don't get behind your fig leaf religion
[24:52] come to the cross
[24:54] come to christ
[24:56] be honest with him
[24:59] god grace trying to draw you out of your
[25:02] the bushes there
[25:03] can you say amen
[25:05] and so now he still wants fellowship
[25:07] this time he has not an animal skin in
[25:09] his hand he stands as a bloody lamb with
[25:11] a book in his hand
[25:13] to call you out of hiding and say look
[25:15] here
[25:16] here's the book it's not closed anymore
[25:18] it's open come here look at this book
[25:21] look in here and see your name in the
[25:23] book of life
[25:25] if i'm in the lamb's book of life then
[25:27] i'm in the lamb i'm part of him
[25:31] and i have the favor of god not because
[25:34] i am who i am i'm the favorite god
[25:36] because i'm in the lamb's book of life
[25:39] is this simple enough for everybody
[25:41] and if i'm in there
[25:43] if i'm in there
[25:44] then he has made me worthy i have favor
[25:48] with the king.
[25:50] now how many knows a girl named esther
[25:52] an unworthy girl esther israeli girl
[25:54] nobody knew
[25:56] and that girl moves from being nothing
[26:00] moving moving up moving up until now
[26:03] she's chosen by the king
[26:07] but even after she was chosen and been
[26:09] the queen for a little while
[26:12] she recognizes she has an enemy against
[26:15] her that's making her feel unworthy to
[26:18] be that queen
[26:19] i'm out to get the jews
[26:21] i'm out to get her
[26:23] she has an enemy and so now esther
[26:26] showing her humanness she says i'm going
[26:28] to go
[26:29] i'm going to pray about this but there's
[26:31] a rule that says nobody is supposed to
[26:33] come before the king
[26:34] uninvited am i and i everybody
[26:37] understands the story
[26:39] so esther so so now she she comes and
[26:43] just gets in the back door of the temple
[26:44] and she sees him on his throne and she's
[26:46] a little bit just a little bit afraid
[26:48] you know i feel like a lot of her being
[26:50] afraid is is not so much sin and guilt
[26:53] but just intimidated by the devil she
[26:56] has an enemy and she's intimidated
[26:58] i there's a rule that says nobody can
[27:00] come and i can't come before him anyway
[27:05] i can't come before him just like and so
[27:08] she had to get a revelation but wait a
[27:09] minute i'm not like everybody else
[27:14] it's real simple friends
[27:16] the devil's telling me all this stuff
[27:18] but i'm not like everybody else
[27:21] i
[27:23] i must not forget i have been chosen
[27:27] by the king
[27:30] and all the unworthiness i feel and all
[27:33] the devil is intimidating me and he's
[27:35] going to kill my people and he finds out
[27:36] i'm a jew he's going to kill me and this
[27:38] is all and there's this intimidator
[27:40] there and she's seen tim that's why
[27:41] she's hesitant a little bit to come
[27:43] before the throne but once she begins to
[27:45] come back into that revelation that says
[27:47] i'm chosen of the king i was chosen
[27:49] above millions all these other people
[27:51] i've been chosen as the queen
[27:54] as the bride of jesus christ i have been
[27:57] chosen and thus if i have been chosen i
[28:00] must have the favor of the king to come
[28:02] before the game it is the throne of
[28:05] grace and so come boldly before the
[28:07] throne of gates it took her a while to
[28:09] fast and pray and come into this
[28:11] revelation to finally say you know what
[28:13] i'm going to go down there i'm going to
[28:15] step into there i know all the rules say
[28:17] that nobody's worthy but yet i'm worthy
[28:19] because he made me worthy
[28:23] somebody shout praise the lord
[28:27] this is a bible study you learned in
[28:28] sunday school but i can tell you it
[28:30] speaks to your life right now can you
[28:32] say amen it speaks to your life no
[28:34] matter how much the devil tells you
[28:36] you're unworthy if you're a son and
[28:38] daughter of god he has made you worthy
[28:41] to come before the throne of grace
[28:43] i've come and prayed sometimes and felt
[28:45] completely unworthy to pray but i have
[28:47] to override what i feel about myself and
[28:49] what the devil's saying because i have a
[28:52] right to the throne of god because of
[28:54] his grace
[28:55] i have a right to pray for my child
[28:57] who's sick i have a right to pray for
[28:59] these needs i have elijah was a man to
[29:02] subject to like passions as they were as
[29:04] we are and yet he prayed and god
[29:06] answered his prayer it wasn't elijah's
[29:10] worthiness was because he was chosen of
[29:13] god
[29:15] and she comes and she says i have a
[29:17] request
[29:18] whatever it is esther whatever it is up
[29:20] to the half of my kingdom
[29:23] you have my favor you don't have to earn
[29:25] it you don't have to go do this you
[29:27] don't have to go do that it's not about
[29:29] that what do you desire and the depths
[29:32] of your heart ask me up to the half of
[29:34] my kingdom i'll give it to you
[29:36] talk about the favor of the king
[29:38] ask that's why jesus was saying ask
[29:43] knock
[29:44] seek he wants you to ask
[29:48] ask esther
[29:49] i was wondering if you could come over
[29:51] for a dinner
[29:53] uh and
[29:55] so she's setting all this up because
[29:56] she's gonna get the the confidence and
[29:59] the boldness to invite her enemy
[30:01] to the same dinner
[30:05] i love it i preached on this before but
[30:07] just in case some of you didn't hear me
[30:10] i love to see this type
[30:12] that she invites
[30:14] her enemy
[30:16] into the presence of the king
[30:20] i don't have to deal with them on my own
[30:23] i would invite him into the presence of
[30:25] the king and he'll deal with it
[30:30] that's why i say you got problems don't
[30:32] stop coming to church
[30:34] the devil's fighting your mind don't
[30:36] stop coming to church
[30:38] get in his presence and it doesn't have
[30:40] to be in church if you invited his
[30:42] president's presence into your home if
[30:44] you invited your presence into your
[30:45] truck yesterday i was fellowship with
[30:47] brother john i said you know what it
[30:48] doesn't have to be in church i've been
[30:50] in my truck my truck traveling and felt
[30:52] the presence of god come into that truck
[30:54] i just weep and cry god i'm glad to be
[30:56] your son i'm glad to be chosen of you
[30:59] i'm coming before you lord
[31:06] my dad used to say the devil he's
[31:08] constantly beating us down my dad used
[31:09] to say he's always telling you you can't
[31:11] be a son you did this and you did you
[31:12] can't he's always badgering me and dead
[31:14] and dad said i just started talking back
[31:16] to him
[31:17] no i am a son of god i am the chosen of
[31:20] god he is talking back and you and then
[31:22] you and then you say well if you're
[31:24] going to keep badgering me let's have a
[31:25] bible study satan
[31:29] i'm going to get my bible out
[31:31] where should we go
[31:34] let's go to genesis first
[31:37] no no no
[31:39] don't go there don't care how about the
[31:40] book of revelations
[31:42] the two books that satan hates the worst
[31:47] because genesis exposes his beginning
[31:49] and revelations shows his destination
[31:53] and he doesn't like it
[31:55] it's the word it's gonna happen it shows
[31:58] it's got his whole biography in between
[32:01] but it's got its beginning it's got his
[32:03] end and so if you start bringing in the
[32:05] scripture and bring the presence of god
[32:06] and turn on some good holy ghost-filled
[32:08] music do you think the devil's gonna
[32:10] stay around and badgered your mind
[32:12] esther learn i'm you know what i'm going
[32:14] to do i'm going to invite this guy to
[32:16] church with me
[32:24] she invites him and shows she's still
[32:26] just a tad intimidated you don't think
[32:28] she's nervous there
[32:30] when haman's sitting right there eating
[32:32] her food
[32:34] there's her beloved king and they're
[32:35] there and it still shows he's been
[32:37] intimidated because she was at okay king
[32:39] says what is it that you want
[32:40] um
[32:44] i was wondering if you could
[32:47] come for dinner tomorrow night yes
[32:51] why didn't she ask then
[32:53] because she's still growing
[32:55] in her confidence
[32:59] i mean this guy is a beast this guy is
[33:02] this guy's rough he's out to kill her
[33:04] he's out to get her and so she's just a
[33:06] young young girl who was unworthy of all
[33:10] this but she has to keep remembering
[33:12] i've been chosen i'm in a position here
[33:14] and my king can take care of this guy
[33:19] invites them the second night they all
[33:21] come over this is good food i'm enjoying
[33:23] this and she gets the confidence and she
[33:25] blurts it out and says this is what's
[33:28] happening this is my enemy the king says
[33:31] who is badgering you who's doing this i
[33:33] want to know and she points over and
[33:35] says this is him right here at dinner
[33:37] right now
[33:38] and she let the king
[33:40] deal
[33:41] with her enemy
[33:48] this is not just a sermon this is an
[33:50] everyday life for you
[33:52] because your battle an enemy that's
[33:54] getting worse and worse and worse and
[33:56] worse to believers who want to serve the
[33:58] lord
[34:01] invite your enemy in the presence of the
[34:03] king
[34:04] and let him deal with them can you say
[34:06] man the only way she could do it is she
[34:08] had the king's favor that's the only
[34:10] reason
[34:11] she was an exception to the rule that
[34:13] nobody can approach god this way
[34:15] nobody's worthy she was an exception to
[34:17] the rule this bride is an exception to
[34:19] the regular rules
[34:23] so when all this happened in revelations
[34:24] 5 there's loud shoutings john got loud
[34:27] that's why i say shouting grace grace
[34:30] shouting thou art worthy our lord you
[34:33] have made us worthy you've made us kings
[34:35] and priests i wasn't worthy but you made
[34:37] me worthy shouting rejoicing
[34:41] it says john he said i was shouting so
[34:43] loud
[34:44] all of heaven all under the earth all in
[34:46] the sea everybody heard me shouting
[34:49] worthy the lamb
[34:53] grace grace
[34:55] because he has made me worthy can you
[34:57] say amen
[35:00] and the prophet said the reason he was
[35:02] shouting so much is because he's seen
[35:04] his name in the book the lamb's book of
[35:06] life
[35:08] if i'm there
[35:10] then i can't continue to say i'm not
[35:12] worthy he has made me worthy
[35:18] amen you're still with me this morning
[35:21] amen
[35:23] so we found out last sunday that in the
[35:25] time we live in just before the
[35:26] destruction or just before the judgments
[35:28] of god it's a wonderful thing to see
[35:31] that just before his judgment strikes
[35:34] god poured out his grace to his people
[35:36] to deliver them from the condition
[35:38] and i tried to articulate the times we
[35:40] live in and trust me i could take
[35:42] another
[35:43] five six hours to talk about what we see
[35:46] every week going on in the news in this
[35:48] world i i don't know how else to say it
[35:50] we're living in the days of noah we're
[35:52] living in the days of sodom and gomorrah
[35:55] but and the conditions are are reaching
[35:58] uh
[35:59] the conditions every week are reaching
[36:01] not even a boiling point they're
[36:03] reaching the point of exploding
[36:06] that's my my feeble way of saying it
[36:09] it's like when god said about when the
[36:11] children of israel were in egypt when
[36:12] the cup of iniquity becomes full then
[36:14] god stepped in his grace
[36:16] so that's another word picture to show
[36:18] us the cup of iniquity is full
[36:21] it reaches a point that something's got
[36:24] to give and sin has heaped so much in
[36:27] our world you may feel comfortable as an
[36:30] american you still have your car you
[36:32] still have your conveniences at home
[36:33] most of you are going to eat a good meal
[36:35] today
[36:36] our brothers and sisters in ukraine it's
[36:37] not so it's a different story and that's
[36:39] the problem sometimes is us spoiled
[36:42] americans
[36:43] don't call out to god like we should
[36:46] we're okay because we have something to
[36:47] fall back on can you say amen
[36:49] but you see we can't live that way
[36:51] because we're in the closing seconds of
[36:53] time and our hope is not in all of our
[36:56] the things that the world's providing
[36:57] for us that's going to be gone someday
[36:59] our only hope is in the lord our hope is
[37:01] in the lord and the escape and the grace
[37:03] that he's provided for us somebody needs
[37:06] to say lord if you've provided grace in
[37:08] the last days i embrace your grace i
[37:10] need your grace i need the message of
[37:13] grace
[37:15] that's what we need to be saying i could
[37:17] spend hours though all the facets of the
[37:19] condition i tried last sunday sodom and
[37:21] gomorrah
[37:22] satan's eden
[37:24] almost daily almost daily laws are being
[37:27] introduced almost on a daily basis i
[37:30] hope you're watching what's going on
[37:32] sodom laws sodom laws that justify sodom
[37:35] and gomorrah
[37:37] laws that are stealing the parents
[37:39] rights they're being passed right now
[37:42] by our own president
[37:44] taking your rights away as a parent to
[37:47] influence your child because they
[37:48] discovered is that we can talk about
[37:51] gays and transgender all we want to and
[37:53] we can try to get losses in so the
[37:55] adults can do that but if we it's kind
[37:56] of like hitler said those that have the
[37:58] minds of the child have the minds of the
[38:00] future
[38:02] he who rules the children rules the
[38:05] future so now they've discovered satan's
[38:07] anointing to discover unless we get into
[38:10] the minds of a three or four or five
[38:11] year old and start influencing them to
[38:13] give them what they want to be and and
[38:15] now we've got to remove parents
[38:17] influence because they might tell their
[38:19] kid that's wrong they might say no god's
[38:22] made you in the image of god you're
[38:24] listening to a wrong spirit and by the
[38:26] way parents you have a right to say that
[38:32] that's what a parent does can you say
[38:34] man that's how he loves the child to
[38:36] point out when they're wrong and you're
[38:38] being influenced by the wrong thing
[38:40] god help us to be parents not afraid to
[38:44] say it in love but to say it it might be
[38:46] the last voice that they hear
[38:50] trying to take our kids trying to
[38:51] influence sodom and gomorrah trying to
[38:53] change laws almost daily
[38:55] i tell you i just i went out
[38:58] i was just looking down the phone and
[39:00] seeing what happened just this week and
[39:02] i said to my son solomon i said solomon
[39:04] i can't believe my granddaughter it was
[39:07] hard on you guys but i can't believe my
[39:08] granddaughter who's here this morning
[39:10] can't believe it she's
[39:12] what is she gonna what kind of world is
[39:14] she gonna grow up in
[39:18] what kind of world
[39:20] is my granddaughter ellie mae gonna have
[39:22] to grow up in
[39:25] every day it's changing
[39:31] what kind of world is jira gonna have to
[39:34] grow up in
[39:36] i say the same thing as the song brother
[39:38] west
[39:39] gyra will provide
[39:41] for our sons and daughters
[39:43] jaiba has provided for our sons and
[39:46] daughters
[39:47] and without it without that grace we
[39:49] have no hope for our sons and daughters
[39:53] except god left the remnant the bible
[39:55] says we would have become as sodom and
[39:57] gomorrah
[39:59] no not my kids they never buy into that
[40:01] they know they're a girl and a boy it's
[40:03] the spirit behind it
[40:05] you don't think lesbianism is creeping
[40:07] into
[40:08] the minds in this message of young girls
[40:11] that feel lonely
[40:14] i didn't expect to say this but i'ma say
[40:16] it
[40:18] satan abuses loneliness
[40:21] that's when spirits come in i haven't
[40:24] had no guy look at me
[40:26] there's no good guys in the message
[40:27] these are all statements i've heard from
[40:29] young girls one girl's out in the world
[40:31] right now i just keep praying god will
[40:33] bring her back but that's the statement
[40:34] she made for me
[40:35] there's no guys looking at me everybody
[40:37] all the other girls get guys i don't get
[40:39] one i'm not talking about anybody here
[40:40] she's she's in the world
[40:43] i love her i love her
[40:45] and i believe she's coming back
[40:47] but she bought into that and it started
[40:49] that loneliness i don't have someone and
[40:51] there's another girl who used to come to
[40:52] church when she was very young in this
[40:54] church she's a lesbian today there's a
[40:56] boy that played the organ he's a
[40:58] homosexual today and all this just it
[41:00] starts somewhere and then if you don't
[41:02] have the holy ghost those spirits attach
[41:04] to their minds
[41:06] all privately and they start to buy into
[41:09] these well maybe
[41:10] i'm not this maybe i'm this
[41:15] it's real
[41:16] it's among us
[41:18] but we have the token
[41:22] amen oh my kids though
[41:24] my kids don't never buy into that my
[41:25] boy's a boy my girl's a girl we'll be
[41:27] fine we'll be fine you're you're living
[41:29] in la la land
[41:32] you're living in la la land this is
[41:34] serious
[41:36] i said to solomon my granddaughter's got
[41:38] to grow up this world this this is and
[41:40] so this but i said to him that here's my
[41:42] other cry even so come quickly lord
[41:46] jesus please that's i believe the bride
[41:49] is just going to be saying lord if it's
[41:51] your grace to rapture do it now lord
[41:53] come now
[41:55] don't let my kids grow up in this
[41:58] if they do he'll give us the grace to do
[42:00] it but i don't want her growing up in
[42:02] this
[42:03] it's time can you say amen it's time
[42:05] that this be finished
[42:12] there's something more important than
[42:14] our jobs and our possessions and our
[42:16] convenient lives
[42:18] and our little escapes and our
[42:22] little tv shows
[42:26] you can have all that as an american
[42:28] provided to you and miss the atonement
[42:30] of the lord jesus christ
[42:34] i said about noah's day that the
[42:36] thoughts of man was evil continually he
[42:38] couldn't think of good thought anymore
[42:39] so our mind time and our thoughts and
[42:42] believers wonder ones sometimes
[42:43] believers because you see that's
[42:45] believers that the devil beats up so
[42:47] much
[42:48] they have the holy ghost they got
[42:50] something within them and their and
[42:51] their minds are being plagued their
[42:53] minds are being brought down
[42:55] i'm being real with you listen listen
[42:58] we're not exempt from his access to try
[43:00] to get in our thoughts
[43:03] sexual lustful thoughts
[43:05] you may not look at anything but the
[43:07] spirits are around
[43:09] i've said before in your mind you may
[43:12] never go to a wrong movie or watch a
[43:14] wrong movie but you have your
[43:15] imagination and satan anoints your
[43:17] imagination you can produce and create
[43:19] your own movies in your mind sit in the
[43:22] theater of your mind and watch the most
[43:25] filthy things created in your own mind
[43:30] why because of the contaminated spirits
[43:33] we live in it's the conditions it's the
[43:35] conditions and so you know i don't like
[43:37] to keep because i can go like i said
[43:38] another six hours conditions and all of
[43:40] you would feel like oh my goodness
[43:42] lord have mercy
[43:46] but i don't end it that way because i
[43:48] have a token i have grace
[43:50] i've got an answer for us this morning
[43:53] if i didn't have it i wouldn't preach
[43:54] because we're finished we're all done no
[43:57] matter how good we've done to the
[43:58] kingdom of god we're all finished but i
[44:00] can preach the grace of god and stop
[44:01] talking about conditions and just
[44:02] conclude by saying when the conditions
[44:04] are at their very worst that's when god
[44:07] becomes rich in mercy
[44:09] and we need him to be rich in mercy we
[44:12] don't jesus need his mercy at this hour
[44:14] we need him rich in mercy
[44:17] i need a lot of grace
[44:19] and anybody who says okay well i'm just
[44:21] going to go live the way i want to
[44:23] because i have the grace of god you
[44:24] don't understand grace because when you
[44:26] understand grace it puts a real
[44:28] soberness in you say god i don't want to
[44:30] step on your grace because the way you
[44:32] want to live is grace becomes disgrace
[44:35] the grace of god is not this christ it's
[44:37] somebody saying i need your grace to
[44:39] survive i need your grace to make it out
[44:41] of this world i need your grace for my
[44:43] children's minds my children's hearts i
[44:45] need jehovah gyra to protect my sons and
[44:48] daughters
[44:50] i need you lord if i ever needed you i
[44:53] need you right now there isn't anything
[44:55] more important than the grace of god in
[44:57] our lives speaking to us
[45:00] hallelujah
[45:02] my daughter have to grow up in
[45:04] this thursday
[45:06] your president
[45:08] our president shame we have to claim him
[45:12] this thursday he says on transgender day
[45:15] of visibility i'm not even putting this
[45:17] up on the board because it's not worth
[45:18] it
[45:20] but i want you to know what our
[45:21] president said thursday
[45:23] and where we're at
[45:25] to everyone celebrating transgender day
[45:27] of visibility this is joe biden your
[45:28] president to everyone celebrating
[45:30] transgender day of visibility i want you
[45:32] to know that your president sees you
[45:34] jill camel a doug our entire
[45:36] administration sees you for who you are
[45:38] made in the image of god
[45:41] this is a catholic
[45:44] that doesn't even match what the
[45:45] catholic doctrine is
[45:47] no catholic
[45:49] he's no christian
[45:53] he he's become a perverted mind
[45:58] how bold should i get
[46:03] see the devil wants to intimidate us to
[46:05] not speak truth and there's less and
[46:06] less churches talking about this because
[46:09] it's not politically correct
[46:11] and the ones who are talking about it
[46:13] are going to be scanned
[46:15] our youtube channel is probably being
[46:17] scanned
[46:18] it might even be scavenging when i'm
[46:19] talking right now
[46:22] we get a little scared about it
[46:25] but but you see somebody's got to say
[46:27] something
[46:29] if i go to jail i go to jail but
[46:30] somebody and if you're listening right
[46:32] now whoever you are god bless you listen
[46:34] if you're listening to whoever you are
[46:36] i'll just let you know that that we
[46:38] believe the bible and we believe what
[46:40] god says the image of god is not what
[46:42] biden says
[46:44] that man male and female created he them
[46:48] in the image of god was male and female
[46:51] and then he separated them
[46:53] and he made them
[46:54] distinct our president does not
[46:57] understand he shouldn't even be using
[46:58] the term of the image of god doesn't
[47:00] have a clue what the image of god is
[47:03] but we believe the bible here
[47:06] and we believe that homosexuality is a
[47:08] is an abomination to god
[47:10] transgender is an abomination to god
[47:13] [Applause]
[47:14] and if you're listening i've got hope
[47:16] for you sitting there listening you
[47:17] could come to petersburg and i'll lead
[47:20] you to an altar of grace that you can be
[47:22] delivered yourself
[47:24] i don't need that to be arrogant but
[47:26] they say they're listening today
[47:29] they say they're scanning
[47:32] so i can shut it all down
[47:34] but let's let them shut it down
[47:38] because there has to be a voice there
[47:40] has to be a voice
[47:45] i don't even want to finish what he said
[47:46] i tell you i'm just i don't even want to
[47:48] hear what the president when he goes
[47:49] this direction i don't have any
[47:51] confidence in them
[47:54] i made some decisions this week i'm not
[47:56] watching another disney movie

[49:50] experienced an epidemic of violence
[49:51] against transgender women of color and
[49:53] girls of color and tells parents that
[49:55] they are that they can protect the
[49:57] safety and health of their children by

[50:21] goes on and on after an actor
[50:24] assaults another actor on the stage in
[50:26] front of the world at the academy awards
[50:29] it didn't surprise me
[50:31] after an actor assaults one right in
[50:34] front of everybody the rest of the world
[50:35] at the academy of worlds the motion
[50:37] picker picture company
[50:39] the awards

[50:45] the motion picture industry
[50:47] two hours later issue a statement that
[50:49] says the academy
[50:51] does not condone violence of any form
[50:58] and i'm going
[50:59] do they think i'm an absolute idiot
[51:04] am i stupid
[51:07] no i think they're the stupid ones to
[51:10] issue in a statement that their academy
[51:12] that produces movies
[51:15] of all kinds of violence says we don't
[51:18] condone violence of any kind
[51:21] you liar
[51:22] you've done it for 60 years
[51:26] 70 years
[51:28] and they got this mental block that they
[51:30] can't associate how that act or acts
[51:32] gives themselves permission to act
[51:33] anyway they can't tie it together with
[51:35] how he's acting to the videos he
[51:37] produces and the and what he's acting in
[51:39] even his just violent violent outright
[51:42] violence blood and guts video games
[51:44] blood and guts and they never tied
[51:45] together why is there violence why is
[51:47] there kids acting this way why is your
[51:49] shootings more than ever before this
[51:51] january in new york chicago why is it
[51:53] happening why nobody ever says well if
[51:56] you're blowing up people and there's
[51:57] blood and guts happening and you're
[51:59] saying that doesn't affect you've got a
[52:01] real mental block because what you feed
[52:03] on
[52:04] is what you act out
[52:09] all right you know what i'm going to
[52:10] have to quit here and all this stuff
[52:14] the academy does not condone violence of
[52:17] any form
[52:20] they need to watch their movies
[52:28] extreme conditions call on a god who's
[52:30] rich in mercy
[52:32] can you raise your hand and say we're in
[52:34] extreme conditions
[52:37] can you at the very minimum just just
[52:39] say this is not what it was ten years
[52:41] ago
[52:43] it's changing every day
[52:45] but extreme conditions require a god
[52:48] rich in mercy
[52:50] we need him like we've never needed him
[52:52] before
[52:53] can you say amen are you sure you want
[52:55] to take shots
[52:56] or even give time to people who take
[52:58] shots to condemn the message as being a
[53:00] cult are you sure you want to do that
[53:03] are you sure you wouldn't think it and
[53:04] rethink it
[53:06] that the very thing that is our
[53:09] message of grace
[53:11] and our only hope
[53:12] and people condemn it as being a cult
[53:14] i'm here to tell you it's the grace of
[53:16] god
[53:17] that he would make statements to deliver
[53:19] us from this present generation
[53:24] this message is the last days is more
[53:26] relevant today i'm talking sunday what
[53:29] is this april 3rd this message is more
[53:31] relevant today than it has ever been
[53:37] it's our grace to escape with the token
[53:39] with our families
[53:42] you know in egypt the only homes that
[53:44] were safe is the ones that have the
[53:45] blood on it
[53:50] let's break down for a minute
[53:53] maybe a little bit more than a minute
[53:56] this sin
[53:58] abounded after adam fell because that's
[54:00] where i said we're at i mean sin has
[54:02] abounded six thousand years now we're at
[54:04] the
[54:04] not the boiling point but the blowing up
[54:06] and hold on to that term blowing up
[54:08] because i want to get to that minute
[54:09] it's just going to blow up it's just
[54:10] come to a place it's going to blow
[54:12] because sin is heaped up
[54:14] but it's multiplied it's multiplied so
[54:17] much
[54:19] uh to the end time it just heaps up and
[54:21] it's just it's it's everywhere it's in
[54:23] our atmospheres
[54:24] uh it's in our i can get our thinking
[54:27] it's
[54:30] i think of brother gary in our church
[54:32] and i don't see this to belittle him
[54:33] because i believe brother gary was a
[54:36] man of god who loved this word he never
[54:38] left the word but you know he battled in
[54:40] his mind
[54:42] brother ken and i know
[54:44] know this more than anybody because we
[54:45] dealt with him and brother brandon as
[54:47] well always trying to encourage him he'd
[54:49] sit in services sit in services like
[54:51] this
[54:52] and the devil just plaguing his mind
[54:55] and a lot of it we just didn't
[54:56] understand but we tried to understand
[54:58] but he battled it probably almost to the
[55:00] day he went
[55:02] some preachers would say hey
[55:05] he probably didn't have nothing
[55:07] he shouldn't be living that way or the
[55:08] devil's battle in his mind
[55:10] some people say well he might he didn't
[55:13] have the holy ghost
[55:14] well i was his pastor for
[55:16] probably 25 years i no
[55:18] different right
[55:20] because if he could have left this word
[55:22] he would have left a long time ago
[55:25] he never left christ he never left this
[55:27] word what's the evidence of the holy
[55:28] ghost remember
[55:31] is the reality is that the holy ghost
[55:33] changes your soul but the other two
[55:35] parts of you is not born again
[55:39] your mind your spirit
[55:43] your emotions they're not converted they
[55:46] have to come under the holy ghost can
[55:48] you say amen
[55:50] if the holy ghost is in our flesh then
[55:52] why do we still get sick
[55:58] if the holy ghost is in
[56:00] our minds then we would never have any
[56:03] anxiety never have any fears never had
[56:05] any pressure
[56:07] but the holy ghost is in our soul when
[56:09] he sets up in the control tower now you
[56:11] got something to overcome with
[56:14] that's the way i believe it but until we
[56:16] get out of this and get a new body satan
[56:18] only has two excesses and that's our
[56:20] mind our spirit and so he he's just he's
[56:23] ganging up on it
[56:25] especially believers he's gaining up on
[56:27] your thought life he's trying to be
[56:28] literally he's trying to put you that
[56:30] you cap out of something you can grow a
[56:32] lot more as a christian but he's keeping
[56:33] you here why because he acts access to
[56:36] the spirit your spirit realm and so he's
[56:38] going to badger those things brother
[56:40] gary badger did all those years and you
[56:42] know we tried everything we'd pray with
[56:44] him on and he'd have good times then
[56:45] he'd go other times and i don't even
[56:47] know what it was his past or whatever it
[56:48] is but i would never de-christianize or
[56:50] take away from him what he had
[56:53] because he was faithful to the word of
[56:54] god
[56:55] he cleaned this church every time after
[56:57] service for some 20 years
[57:00] he served the body of christ silently
[57:02] quietly couldn't hardly even talk or
[57:04] fellowship with people couldn't eat with
[57:05] him because he had a problem from his
[57:07] cancer and his throat and all that he
[57:08] had so many so many things and yet i
[57:11] would never de-christianize that man i
[57:14] know he was tied to christ and i know
[57:16] when i step across the river he's one of
[57:18] the first handshakes i want to get my
[57:21] dear brother gary with his new body
[57:26] see we categorize people and we put the
[57:28] things all this stuff you know and i
[57:31] tell you
[57:32] the devil's just heaping up
[57:34] and believers will sit right in services
[57:36] like that have many say they're sitting
[57:38] in church brother paul i feel so guilty
[57:41] because i'm sitting at church and the
[57:43] battle's just
[57:45] the battle's raging
[57:49] because the devil comes to church too
[57:53] he's more faithful than some other
[57:54] people
[57:57] yeah he's
[57:58] he's here and i hate that i want to
[58:00] worship freely i know this is true
[58:02] something's registering myself i want to
[58:04] be free of this and yet
[58:06] you know he's got thoughts of this and
[58:08] thoughts of that and thoughts
[58:09] you know this is a battle
[58:11] it's a battle
[58:14] and
[58:15] with all the conditions
[58:17] i just i don't know how to say it except
[58:19] for
[58:20] that
[58:21] don't allow the devil
[58:25] don't allow the devil
[58:29] to beat you up and take on guilt
[58:32] because of the age that we're living in
[58:37] a lot of things that you're feeling
[58:39] is the age and the atmosphere
[58:42] contaminated around us
[58:45] we're taking ownership of it and just
[58:47] beating ourselves up as christians do
[58:50] you need the holy spirit you know you
[58:51] need it you should be honest i need the
[58:53] holy spirit
[58:54] but if you know god's done something in
[58:56] your life that's real
[58:58] you may be away from it
[59:00] but you need to stand against the enemy
[59:01] and say i won't allow him bring the
[59:03] whole guilt to this that somehow now i'm
[59:05] falling under the judgments of god
[59:09] it's the atmosphere we're feeling
[59:12] you guys are going to be honest with me
[59:13] and say i never think in pure thought i
[59:16] never have a bad thought i never looked
[59:18] the wrong way today
[59:20] are you going to be raise your hands to
[59:21] be honest it's a battle in this hour to
[59:24] keep our eyes on the right thing
[59:28] if we don't be honest then we're
[59:29] preaching perfection
[59:31] in the body
[59:33] perfection by the holy ghost in the body
[59:36] and in the mind
[59:38] some preachers think i'm justifying sin
[59:40] and i'm justifying a bunch of no i'm not
[59:42] justifying anything
[59:43] you need to be honest if you're looking
[59:45] at the wrong thing say god forgive me of
[59:47] that but don't let the devil take it to
[59:49] take away everything god has given you
[59:53] you're here
[59:54] you have what you have i know god dealt
[59:56] with me in my life and i'm here and i'm
[59:58] here to bring him everything i'm here to
[1:00:00] confess my sins i am i am by the grace
[1:00:03] of god i want him to change me i want to
[1:00:05] live deeper than what i'm living here
[1:00:06] and that's how it is and i got a god
[1:00:08] here i got a king i have his favor and
[1:00:10] he's ready to do it and that's the
[1:00:12] fairfax friends that's it
[1:00:15] it isn't any more complicated than that
[1:00:19] don't let him cause you to live in
[1:00:21] defeat can you say amen in the amplified
[1:00:24] it says it says so going back to verse
[1:00:27] 18 and
[1:00:28] romans 5. if you want to read it along
[1:00:31] so then as though one trespassed adam's
[1:00:33] sin there resulted condemnation for all
[1:00:35] men even so though one act of
[1:00:37] righteousness there resulted
[1:00:39] justification of life for all men for
[1:00:40] just as though one man's disobedience
[1:00:43] his failure to hear his carelessness the
[1:00:45] many were made sinners so through the
[1:00:47] obedience of one man the many will be
[1:00:49] made righteous and acceptable to god and
[1:00:50] brought into right standing with him
[1:00:52] verse 20 but the law came to increase
[1:00:55] and expand the awareness in the trespass
[1:00:58] by defining and unmasking sin see when
[1:01:00] the word comes it unmasks what the sin
[1:01:03] is it unmask it so it actually becomes
[1:01:06] how should i say it doesn't become worse
[1:01:08] but your sin becomes more evident
[1:01:12] you become really a sinner when the word
[1:01:14] comes because you didn't know you were a
[1:01:15] sinner
[1:01:16] you didn't know what you were doing
[1:01:17] wrong so that little spot there of the
[1:01:20] word coming to somebody's life when
[1:01:22] they're out there in the world they
[1:01:23] didn't know they were sinner they didn't
[1:01:24] know it was all fine they were a sinner
[1:01:26] they had the nature of sin but when they
[1:01:27] come to the word it's a real tedious
[1:01:29] thing because god begins to show them
[1:01:31] why they're wrong
[1:01:33] what's wrong in the soul
[1:01:35] then they start he starts to point out
[1:01:37] through the word and through the message
[1:01:38] this is this is this is how you should
[1:01:40] live this is how you say same thing in
[1:01:42] the law of moses thou shalt not kill
[1:01:43] thou shalt not commit adultery when all
[1:01:45] that came up
[1:01:47] okay now i know something's wrong here
[1:01:51] now i know i'm living in sin he says the
[1:01:54] law increases and expands now i want to
[1:01:56] just make a point here
[1:01:59] the law
[1:02:01] think deeply now with me the law that
[1:02:03] was god's grace to the people that's
[1:02:05] what he called moses law people would
[1:02:07] say was the law no we're past the law no
[1:02:09] no it was god's grace to the people
[1:02:11] moses bringing the word but that
[1:02:13] expanded the effects of sin actually
[1:02:16] it made sin the bound it made sin
[1:02:18] increase why it made them aware of how
[1:02:21] weak they are without god's grace
[1:02:27] how many people have said to me that the
[1:02:30] that the enemy uses the very message to
[1:02:34] try and condemn them
[1:02:39] quoting the message and quoting the
[1:02:41] scripture
[1:02:42] now do you think god ever intended the
[1:02:44] message to condemn people
[1:02:47] to condemn you
[1:02:49] no
[1:02:49] how does that work when all of a sudden
[1:02:51] the word comes it's the grace and now a
[1:02:54] sudden god's people through the enemy
[1:02:56] interpreting it using the same message
[1:02:58] i'm never worthy i'll never measure up i
[1:03:00] can never do anything using the message
[1:03:02] to do it
[1:03:04] talking to a parent yesterday about the
[1:03:06] kids if kids grow up in an atmosphere
[1:03:08] they never measure up to daddy and mommy
[1:03:10] they never can measure up they're never
[1:03:11] perfect enough that's not good
[1:03:15] because they'll start perceiving god
[1:03:16] that way
[1:03:19] so we have to be balanced as parents
[1:03:20] that we constantly have to point out
[1:03:22] what they're doing wrong and don't stop
[1:03:24] doing it but you have to praise
[1:03:27] you have to praise
[1:03:28] when their steps made to something good
[1:03:32] because they're going to feel like i
[1:03:33] never there's no sense in trying i won't
[1:03:35] try anymore i'm not going to try to
[1:03:37] serve the lord anymore because i
[1:03:38] couldn't measure up to daddy mommy i
[1:03:40] can't measure ever measure up to god so
[1:03:42] i'm quitting there's no sense in trying
[1:03:46] we must have our truth that we present
[1:03:49] seasoned with grace
[1:03:53] has to be seasoned with grace
[1:03:59] you know another word for a bounded so
[1:04:02] he's saying that all this abounds and
[1:04:05] sin abounds and
[1:04:07] then he turns it over and he says but
[1:04:10] when
[1:04:11] what's the last
[1:04:12] word he says there
[1:04:14] where sin abounded grace did much more
[1:04:16] i'm going to try to wrap it up and close
[1:04:17] here in a minute but you still with me
[1:04:20] but where sin abounded in other words it
[1:04:23] just increased and it multiplied and
[1:04:26] compounded
[1:04:27] where sin would do that grace did much
[1:04:30] more compound
[1:04:32] and increase
[1:04:35] so another word for abounded of course
[1:04:37] is compounded everybody anybody ever
[1:04:39] heard of
[1:04:40] uh compound compound interest
[1:04:44] or anybody heard of debt interest
[1:04:47] or anybody had
[1:04:49] interest on your debt
[1:04:51] um
[1:04:52] so you know when you have these things
[1:04:55] of interest then it's not just the debt
[1:04:58] it's not just the bill it's not just
[1:05:01] what you got
[1:05:02] but when you have interest charged on a
[1:05:04] loan
[1:05:05] especially the days when they have high
[1:05:06] interest then at the end of it you don't
[1:05:08] just owe the original debt it abounds it
[1:05:11] accumulates it gets to be more
[1:05:14] that's what satan does with your sin
[1:05:17] it keeps abounding it keeps
[1:05:19] growing in interest and you know satan
[1:05:22] has terrible interest rates
[1:05:29] so you young people if you buy a car you
[1:05:32] say okay i'm gonna buy a car here okay
[1:05:33] i'm gonna buy a car for seven thousand
[1:05:35] dollars okay
[1:05:37] and i only have three hundred dollars
[1:05:39] down i made on my babysitting money and
[1:05:41] i'm going to put 300 down
[1:05:43] and the bank's gonna give me a loan at
[1:05:45] 10
[1:05:46] they're gonna let me pay for it for 48
[1:05:48] months i'm just giving an example here
[1:05:49] of interest now you buy a car for seven
[1:05:51] 300 down ten percent uh interest for 48
[1:05:55] months which i think is four years
[1:05:57] you pay a hundred and fourteen dollars a
[1:05:59] month
[1:06:00] guess what when it's over you didn't pay
[1:06:02] seven thousand for the car you will
[1:06:04] actually pay after it's over with four
[1:06:06] years you'll pay almost 10 000 for the
[1:06:08] car
[1:06:10] because of interest abounding
[1:06:12] accumulating
[1:06:14] so your car that you thought you would
[1:06:16] pay uh 7 000 where you didn't pay that
[1:06:19] you didn't pay that you paid
[1:06:20] 9 600 almost 10 000 and then in four
[1:06:23] years you're going to have repairs let's
[1:06:24] say it's 2 000 repairs now that cars
[1:06:27] cost you uh 11 612
[1:06:31] the 7 000 car
[1:06:33] and after four years the thing is
[1:06:34] falling apart anyway
[1:06:37] you know the air don't work so you got
[1:06:38] 260 air two windows down 60 miles an
[1:06:41] hour
[1:06:44] the air don't work the headlights are
[1:06:47] wired on with baling wire
[1:06:50] there's loud sounds coming out of it
[1:06:52] there's there's smoke coming out of it
[1:06:55] and you've paid
[1:06:57] not double but you've it so it abounds
[1:06:59] right and so you know and there's a
[1:07:01] smoke or you know
[1:07:03] i thought last night i was in detroit in
[1:07:05] a traffic jam years ago this was i was
[1:07:08] young
[1:07:09] and
[1:07:10] stuck in a traffic jam and somebody's
[1:07:12] car was smoking just smoke just coming
[1:07:14] out of the hood just pouring out of it
[1:07:16] and everybody notices it really but the
[1:07:19] guy who's in the car
[1:07:21] it was so funny i don't know why i'm
[1:07:22] bringing that but it was just so many
[1:07:24] because i drove up next to him and
[1:07:25] people are passing him and kind of
[1:07:27] wanting to point to it and they're all
[1:07:29] looking at it and he's he's going
[1:07:34] i remember that distinctly brother steve
[1:07:36] in my mind that
[1:07:37] he's just acting like it was almost
[1:07:39] normal every day to see that come on
[1:07:41] yeah
[1:07:43] wish you had a car that had smoke coming
[1:07:45] out of it you're probably jealous of me
[1:07:51] sin
[1:07:52] debt
[1:07:53] bears interest
[1:07:55] can you say amen
[1:07:57] the devil has the worst interest he he
[1:07:59] the devil's a crook and he makes you a
[1:08:01] slave the bible says the the the
[1:08:04] borrower's servant to the lender so his
[1:08:06] kind of debt and interest makes you a
[1:08:08] slave for life sometimes because of one
[1:08:11] sin that you do satan could put compound
[1:08:14] it in your life
[1:08:15] and you can't seem to get over it
[1:08:17] because the devil has got interest on it
[1:08:19] and it's it's not just you remember what
[1:08:21] he says he makes you rob the store and
[1:08:23] then he goes and calls the cops on you
[1:08:24] that you rob the store and then he
[1:08:26] badges you you can never be a believer
[1:08:28] one small little thing sometimes the
[1:08:30] devil has compound interest on it
[1:08:33] it makes you never be forgiven of that
[1:08:35] you can never be free of that that's the
[1:08:37] way the devil works but if you turned
[1:08:39] around compound interest compounded
[1:08:42] interest and you turn this all around
[1:08:44] and i'm teaching this is a mathematic
[1:08:46] class for the young people if they catch
[1:08:48] this my that would be great if you turn
[1:08:50] the interest the power of the interest
[1:08:51] around and it's compounded monthly uh on
[1:08:54] invested money you invest it instead of
[1:08:56] debt you take close to the same amount
[1:08:59] of payment you would have paid for that
[1:09:00] car and you invested in an investment
[1:09:02] account and you you start at you know
[1:09:04] some somewhere like uh maybe uh 12
[1:09:07] percent or excuse me nine percent you
[1:09:09] started let's just say it this way if
[1:09:11] you if you took uh if you put in 170
[1:09:16] for starting at 25 years old at nine
[1:09:19] percent when you're 67 years old you'll
[1:09:22] have 1 million dollars grown
[1:09:25] you'll be a millionaire at 67 just by
[1:09:28] putting in that 170 dollars a month
[1:09:30] starting at 25 years old you put that in
[1:09:33] every month
[1:09:34] you'll be a millionaire if you put in
[1:09:36] if you put in 500 a month you'll be
[1:09:38] three million dollars
[1:09:41] at your retirement
[1:09:43] that's really powerful
[1:09:45] compounded interest is actually god's
[1:09:47] idea
[1:09:49] it's god's mathematics
[1:09:54] young people
[1:09:57] this this is this is powerful naturally
[1:09:59] but it's more powerful
[1:10:00] spiritually amen
[1:10:03] young people i haven't even got into the
[1:10:04] blessings of tithes and offerings
[1:10:07] i haven't talked about that yet
[1:10:09] go over to malachi 3 it says he'll pour
[1:10:11] out upon you a blessing that you won't
[1:10:14] be able to contain by you being faithful
[1:10:16] with your tithes and offerings
[1:10:18] god's mathematics are better than
[1:10:20] anything in the world can you say amen
[1:10:23] you give your light to god you turn your
[1:10:24] life over to jesus christ and say lord i
[1:10:26] want to obey you in all things that you
[1:10:28] do i want to follow you with all my
[1:10:29] heart all of heaven is backing you up
[1:10:31] can you say amen
[1:10:33] that walk towards god is going to be
[1:10:36] compounded and god's going to bless you
[1:10:37] abundantly for it can you say amen
[1:10:40] even about the mathematics albert
[1:10:42] einstein says that compound interest is
[1:10:44] the greatest mathematical discovery of
[1:10:47] all time he says the greatest
[1:10:50] mathematic discovery of all time i've
[1:10:52] got one greater for albert einstein when
[1:10:54] sin abounds grace abounds way beyond it
[1:10:57] can you say amen
[1:10:59] it blows the human mind
[1:11:01] compound interest can blow your mind but
[1:11:03] the grace of god can blow your mind
[1:11:05] because he says where sin would bound
[1:11:07] and it looks like it's taken it to the
[1:11:09] deepest place grace abounds that much
[1:11:11] more
[1:11:14] blows satan's mind blows the human mind
[1:11:16] can you say man it's not even fair
[1:11:18] because you didn't even deserve it you
[1:11:20] didn't even deserve it and god gave it
[1:11:22] to you
[1:11:23] here's some economics of god one can
[1:11:26] chase a thousand
[1:11:28] to ten thousand
[1:11:31] there's some mathematics for you
[1:11:34] hallelujah
[1:11:36] last quote and i'm gonna end it here
[1:11:38] you understand though
[1:11:41] compound interest in the in the natural
[1:11:46] debt of sin
[1:11:48] grows
[1:11:50] but there's something greater
[1:11:53] that's the grace of god
[1:11:55] it's not just you initially get his
[1:11:57] grace but his grace abounds his mercy
[1:11:59] becomes rich to you and it needs to be
[1:12:01] rich in these last days because
[1:12:03] otherwise we'd be a defeated people
[1:12:06] i love you today i love everyone that's
[1:12:08] here everybody listening i love you with
[1:12:10] all my heart
[1:12:12] and please don't be offended
[1:12:14] i love you and i want to tell you the
[1:12:16] truth god
[1:12:18] has a plan for your life
[1:12:20] god has given his grace he's offered his
[1:12:22] grace to you
[1:12:23] don't let the devil taint
[1:12:27] what his grace has been given to you
[1:12:29] don't let him taint it
[1:12:31] this last quote is amazing because it
[1:12:33] says we see that astronomers are
[1:12:35] predicting some time and i'm closing we
[1:12:37] see that astronomers are predicting
[1:12:39] sometime in this early part of the first
[1:12:41] part of the month beginning in the
[1:12:43] second or the fifth somewhere along this
[1:12:44] month the indian astronomers predict the
[1:12:46] world to blow to pieces and the american
[1:12:49] newspapers make fun of it
[1:12:50] so i looked up this article and it said
[1:12:53] the beginning january of 62 and so i
[1:12:56] read the same articles that the
[1:12:57] prophet's reading here and he said they
[1:12:58] were predicting that five five stars to
[1:13:01] line up and it haven't had to happen in
[1:13:03] a long time uh but their conclusion of
[1:13:05] is all five of these stars are lining up
[1:13:07] and their conclusion to is i do not he
[1:13:09] says that the world is going to blow to
[1:13:12] pieces the world when these line up the
[1:13:13] board so there's a great fear there's a
[1:13:15] great scare this is how the prophet
[1:13:17] addresses i do not believe the world's
[1:13:19] going to blow to pieces because of the
[1:13:20] five stars lining up but i do say it's
[1:13:23] wrong to make fun of it because
[1:13:25] something's fixing to happen one of
[1:13:26] these days something similar to that
[1:13:29] when the five planets mars jupiter venus
[1:13:32] and so forth comes into their
[1:13:34] they they've never they've never did it
[1:13:36] oh they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago
[1:13:38] but who was back there to know it i
[1:13:40] predict that this has been so now his
[1:13:42] here's his prediction is what the star
[1:13:44] is lining up i predict that this is a
[1:13:46] spiritual application i believe it's
[1:13:48] coming in the issue of the issue of god
[1:13:51] i believe it's coming in of the issue of
[1:13:53] god that the great revelations of the
[1:13:56] word will be opened during this time
[1:14:00] that's what he says
[1:14:02] 62
[1:14:03] i predict that these five stars lining
[1:14:05] up
[1:14:07] is not what they're saying that it's
[1:14:08] going to blow to pieces at the end of
[1:14:10] the world and they're working off of
[1:14:12] that thing that the mayan calendar said
[1:14:16] predicted 2012 because that was gonna be
[1:14:18] another lining up the five stars that
[1:14:20] would be the end the earth would blow to
[1:14:21] pieces all that has truth to it
[1:14:24] but they don't have any revelation to be
[1:14:26] able to discern when it's going to
[1:14:27] happen that's right
[1:14:29] okay but here's the prophet he takes he
[1:14:32] says yeah there's something this is a
[1:14:33] sign in the heaven of something he said
[1:14:35] there's there's there's
[1:14:37] the great revelations of the world will
[1:14:39] be open during this time what happened
[1:14:40] the year after that
[1:14:44] remember they claim it was three stars
[1:14:46] that came into their orbits when jesus
[1:14:48] was born and this is five and five is
[1:14:56] it's my my sermon to you
[1:14:59] five is the number of grace
[1:15:02] it's not the number of judgment
[1:15:04] so when his word comes
[1:15:06] and great revelations come in the last
[1:15:08] days for his people what is it
[1:15:10] it's grace coming to us
[1:15:13] it's grace and look what else he says
[1:15:15] remember they claim those three stars
[1:15:17] came into their orbits when jesus was
[1:15:18] born and this is five and five is grace
[1:15:20] the number of grace there's the third
[1:15:21] number of perfection three is the number
[1:15:23] of perfection 5 is the number of grace
[1:15:25] jesus
[1:15:27] grace faith all those are five so forth
[1:15:30] the number of grace god ever sends his
[1:15:33] power to the church
[1:15:35] in other words he's saying if god ever
[1:15:37] sends his power to the church
[1:15:39] it'll be
[1:15:41] his grace
[1:15:42] it won't be
[1:15:50] it's powerful if you didn't get anything
[1:15:51] else get this
[1:15:53] when he sends this headstone when he
[1:15:55] sends this revelation when he if he
[1:15:58] brings this power to his church which
[1:16:00] how many believe he has
[1:16:02] it'll be his grace it won't be
[1:16:06] the obedience
[1:16:08] of the people
[1:16:15] somebody said praise god
[1:16:19] hallelujah
[1:16:20] that's right
[1:16:22] somebody shout grace
[1:16:26] when this comes
[1:16:28] and it has come
[1:16:30] it will be grace to the people
[1:16:33] it won't be dependent on the obedience
[1:16:35] of the people
[1:16:36] it's all grace
[1:16:39] it's all grace
[1:16:43] it'll be rapturing grace
[1:16:46] now you know his best i believe in being
[1:16:48] obedient how many believe in obedience
[1:16:50] but at the ultimate end rapturing grace
[1:16:52] is rapturing grace it won't be your
[1:16:55] obedience to get you in
[1:16:57] it's gonna be because his grace was
[1:16:59] extended
[1:17:05] it won't be the obedience of the people
[1:17:09] and isaiah said in the 40th chapter cry
[1:17:12] to jerusalem that her warfare is over
[1:17:15] listen let me tell you something i wish
[1:17:16] i could go to that chapter but read this
[1:17:18] look at this scripture he's referring to
[1:17:20] tell israel comfort my people comfort
[1:17:22] them give them comfort don't badger them
[1:17:25] don't preach judgment to them listen
[1:17:27] listen we're the bride is not under the
[1:17:29] judgments of god she's past the
[1:17:31] judgments of god
[1:17:33] she's under the grace of the message
[1:17:35] that's become can you say amen
[1:17:37] comfort my people and tell them cry to
[1:17:41] jerusalem that her warfare is over yet
[1:17:43] she was guilty of adultery but it was
[1:17:46] god's grace that was sending it god
[1:17:48] sends anything to us it'll be his grace
[1:17:52] and not our merits
[1:17:56] when he brings this it won't be the
[1:17:57] obedience of the people so whatever
[1:17:59] voice is telling you i won't make it in
[1:18:02] unless i become more obedient
[1:18:04] that's not accurate
[1:18:07] i believe in obedience
[1:18:09] but ultimately this won't depend on us
[1:18:14] it depends on our surrender to what he's
[1:18:16] already provided
[1:18:19] that scripture in isaiah 40 ends by
[1:18:22] saying
[1:18:23] israel i have forgiven you your debt has
[1:18:26] been paid double
[1:18:31] now if you had a debt i know i'm
[1:18:33] supposed to close
[1:18:35] if you had a debt
[1:18:36] and you owed say you owed
[1:18:39] twenty dollars and you did something
[1:18:41] wrong so you owe twenty dollars
[1:18:44] and you couldn't pay it
[1:18:47] someone are you the one that put the
[1:18:48] reflectors on my lines
[1:18:50] you're finally confessing to it i have
[1:18:52] two monument lines in my front driveway
[1:18:55] and somebody put reflectors on my lines
[1:18:57] the other day i knew who it was but i
[1:18:59] was trying to get the family to confess

[1:19:10] especially leaving me three days without
[1:19:12] confessing it

[1:19:33] so that you know
[1:19:35] it's not just been paid but it's been
[1:19:37] double paid
[1:19:39] to give the confidence
[1:19:42] comfort my people
[1:19:44] the debt that calvary has been paid
[1:19:46] it's over how joyful and free should we
[1:19:49] be when he's double paid our debts
[1:19:55] forgiven justified
[1:20:01] let's stand together let's rejoice
[1:20:04] he has made us worthy can you say amen
