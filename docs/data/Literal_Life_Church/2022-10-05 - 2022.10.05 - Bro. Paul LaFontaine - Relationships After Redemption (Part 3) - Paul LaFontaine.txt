song nobody else knows it but me and Sherry but I should sing songs that everybody knows I guess but praise the Lord God's good anyhow amen and I just wanted to say that brother Ted Daniels let's remember him in prayer when he read that tonight he sent me a testimony a couple days ago and I'm not going to steal his Thunder he may want to share this Sunday but you know about I guess it was maybe a year ago I was really lord gave me just a real special prayer and Faith for Sister Janice who's losing her eyesight but she got the best report since she's been a young girl she got the best report from the doctor a few days ago that her eyesight is returning and improving very well so maybe he can amen he can give the details of it what we rejoice in the Lord in that and I wasn't going to back down and keep believing the Lord's going to restore all of her sight to it she's doing much better praise the Lord God is good we're going to Let's study in Romans chapter 12 tonight and continue in the series a little bit in relationships after Redemption and let's just take our portion out of just a little study tonight in Romans chapter 12 and some really really good things in here in relation to our series and we don't want to skip it I think it's the next place after the book of Acts that we could talk about what relationships look like after after he redeemed us at Calvary and paid the price filled what's with the Holy Ghost and we have the book of Acts and all the mighty acts that took place through the Believers because of the Oneness of God being restored but then we realized we've been speaking about Not only was the relationship with God restored but the relationship with one another was restored as well and so we have another window here in scripture here in Romans 12 that I think it expresses it good after we come through all of the teaching in Romans concerning justification and where a Believer stands and the contrast or I shouldn't say the contrast but Abraham believing it was accounted under righteousness and seeing what that righteousness is then towards the end as often Paul does in in some of his books that he gets to what does this look like this teaching this Doctrine this this truth what does it look like in an everyday setting with your interaction your with your life with Believers with people of the world what does Christianity look like and I'm always one that leans so well I want to see what it looks like I want to do that I want to be that and so there's another window up so let's study this together tonight if you don't mind Romans 12 and verse 1. I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye presents your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind she may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith so when we come together to the body of Christ we cannot have that thought that I'm better than everybody else we actually got to have a deeper thought and that is that Christ has deposited a portion of himself and everyone that you're looking at that should change our attitude right that God has given a measure to each one and so there is no one higher than the others especially if I've got God in Me and You Got God in you we look at it that it's all God it's a measure of God so there's no Lesser God can you say Amen in the person next to you so that's the way we got to look at it for as we have many members in the one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on the exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without the stimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in Hope patience and tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of the Saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that we be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to Men of lowest State be not wise in your own conceits recompense no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as such is life in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourself but rather give place under wrath for it is written venge is mine I will repay saith the Lord therefore if any if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirsts give him a drink for in doing so Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good there's a lot of things in there you can't live all that except you have the Holy Ghost that's for sure amen father thank you for this evening bless us and anoint us with your words father as we teach this together tonight we just gather around your word give us those Eternal things within us Lord that we can live them out each day we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated tonight so we're going to continue speaking about relationships after Redemption this will be part three and this will be a little bit more of a teaching tonight knowing that it is Romans 12 and just to break it down just a little bit so we are in speaking about relationships with others and we know that the most important relationship that was restored after Calvary is the relationship between God and man what they lost in the Garden of Eden was restored back and so that was the most important God in man and then we see the fruits in the book of Acts of men so coming back into Oneness with God that they took note that the men had been with Jesus it wasn't just they had been with Jesus they had Jesus living in them and they had become so one with God that someone walking in the shadow of Peter was healed can you say Amen now that's not Peter that's something else has happened to Peter and all the book of Acts really shows what the fruits are to God coming back and complete Oneness with man again and so but now then we we have the interactions with other people in talking about relationship with that and what that looks like now in life after God after God corrects the sin problem from the Fallen Eden after God corrects how many to believe that God corrected God completely corrected the sin problem in our nature God corrects it in his own way and remember the reason there was trouble in interacting with others in expressions of hatred and jealousy and anger and killing and persecuting and making fun of and breaking off Oneness with one another and marriages and all this began to come after the fall we never seen that before but the reason that we had all those attributes come forth is because the Oneness was broke in the beginning so all that remember all that jealousy all that hatred none of these things originated in God the the persecuting the making fun of other people being sarcastic putting other people down and then breaking Oneness with other people and shunning other people all these attributes and fruits come from the sin in the beginning and I want to say this that really it can never be right with others it can never be perfectly right with others unless God deals with that Fallen nature let me just say something about help in this world we we have the world is a world has some pretty good things these days for a good marriage and uh helping the family and helping anger issues you can go to anger management classes and it may it may help and it's just like with medicine the world has this all these medicines and brother Brown never put those medicines down he never he gave all the glory to God so science advances and we don't agree with them if they put God aside but we don't put God aside but we're thankful there's so many self-help things to help you and so if God gets the healing but he uses a medicine to do it for a while or whatever we give God glory for it this world is full of pretty good things now after six thousand years and even though it's off the tree of knowledge of men developing it there's some pretty good stuff to help the family to help marriages and different things I I listen I'm not going to ever be critical of something thing whatever it is helps a marriage get better I'm not going to be critical it helps your anger get better I say praise the lord we need less people anger in this angry in this world but you see now all of those things though they help in a great way um all of it will never be as pure and as original as when God deals with the sinful nature of a man can I say it that way none of that will ever be as pure or as original as what they had in the garden when you have Oneness with God when the god in man's nature is the same and that's living within him and living out your relationships are going to be the best that they can ever be back then just simply by Nature by the nature being right and when the nature of sin came in then none of these relationships can be perfectly right although we have a lot of self-help we have a lot of things and uh I I I only against that if it becomes an alternative to God that's where we're against it we thank God for every good thing that can help somebody I'm not going to condemn but some marriage counselor helps a marriage get to be a better marriage I say praise the Lord for that we don't want to get arrogant and proud and say you know we're the only ones that have the answer here God has the answer but God may use someone else can you say Amen to do it so that's my attitude towards those things but we never want want any of those things to be an alternative for not receiving the change of nature because none of those things will bring it in such an original form and a pure form from the very soul of us God changing and getting ready to sin in our nature that's when you're talking relationships are going to get really good they should because you're dealing with it from a nature on the inside amen Amen brother Paul so now Paul picks it up here in the Book of Romans and some of these issues in the scripture some of these things I get on it's hard to hold back preaching but I would just like to do teaching tonight it's hard to hold back and not preach them so I'm going to be a Treacher that's what they call it so Paul brings it in Romans now after the book of Acts we find Romans comes up and at the end of the book of Romans here in Romans chapter 12. it's it's I want to delve into it because the first time that Paul mentions the term we should present our bodies this term a Living Sacrifice now nobody had ever heard that term before it's the first time it's been under revelation of God Paul introduces us speaking I wonder some of the Saints are saying wow never heard that before and it might have been a little confusing at first to realize they only knew one sacrifice that was done and that was at Calvary and they celebrated that and they worshiped under it and they knew they could have never been where they're at by the Holy Ghost except Christ made the sacrifice in Calvary and how many knows he does that once and for all it took care of all sin at Calvary one sacrifice once and for all it was over so they believed that they they got together and had the Lord's Supper quite frequently now never forgetting what the Lord did for his sacrifice so when Paul brings up this term we should present our bodies he didn't say a sacrifice again he didn't say we're going to die again but he actually called it a Living Sacrifice a Living Sacrifice so there's a mystery in the suffering of Christ that we will live out that will not be dealing with sin in the nature of sin but we will that's quite a deep term a Living Sacrifice and they as they were familiar with Christ's sacrifice but but it does not eliminate us entering into sufferings and a surrender in our life and our bodies that glorify and continue to glorify God you think about it a minute these are sinborne bodies God brings us the Holy Ghost and puts it actually justifies a man sanctifies them in his soul now Justified sanctifies them glorify him he's already glorified in a soul level he's already seated in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ in his soul already entered into heavy places and you put that now in a sinborn body that can never be born again now the battle starts now the battle starts and so now you put it in a sinborne body who doesn't know the ways of God doesn't want the ways of God will never want it and you got this Holy Ghost down on the inside okay friends there's a there's a new sheriff in town there's a new headship here there's a new King sitting on the throne everybody get an order now because this body is going to come under subjection to the king that's sitting on the throne there's a new sheriff in town There's a new king and so now you're all going to come under subjection this you may do it quickly or you may take years to do it but you're all going to bring because this this this brother or sister is saying I want to live by the Holy Ghost I want to live in the spirit and if they're saying things like that and moving into it now this body realizes oh my goodness they're surrendering they're yielding I've got to bring this whole body under subjection to what the word says and but it's not an easy thing because this flesh will never be born again like it is in the soul this flesh shall never be glorified right it'll never come to that state where the soul is so thus we come we come to the real battle sometimes of a Christian every day and so now Paul introduces we should become a liberty it means when I say it again that knowing what Christ did for us does not eliminate us entering into sufferings and surrendering in our life and surrendering our bodies that they would glorify God you think about this now this is what point I wanted to get to think about how much Glory it's going to bring to God that he would actually so consume by the Holy Spirit a sin-born body that a body that doesn't ever want to serve the Lord or have the desire to do it comes under subjection to God and ends its life with bringing glory all to God not smoking and drinking and glorifying the devil and glorifying sin and the songs of the world there's going to be plenty of lives do that but there's going to be some lives that have those sin-borne bodies and have the potential to do all that and they're going to end up bringing complete glory to almighty God I want to be one of those I want my body to bring glorified glory glory to God amen so now we enter into sufferings in the surrender in our life nobody else is entering into that but this Living Sacrifice so and I want to say this is not to be forced we willingly come and present ourselves Paul said to present yourselves he didn't say I'm going to come and get you and present you you present yourself you you bring your life up to God as a Living Sacrifice like Isaac did to Abraham that day a little boy he he was a type of Christ let me believe Isaac was a type of Christ he was going to become a sacrifice and he willingly stepped up to come up on the altar because his dad uh it was being so surrendered and so obedient to God so completely I trust you he said take your son your only son from from your wife Sarah and from you came came from you take him and put him up and sacrifice them to me and and Abraham's just you talk about a complete trust in God he's got a complete trust all right I'm doing it and tells his son Isaac get up in the Altar and because of Daddy's trust in God Isaac also have the same trust in God to get up willingly and offer himself willingly just like Jesus did at Calvary he willingly he had he had his own will he said if it be possible let this cup pass from me he could have turned it down but he willingly presented himself to all the authorities that day he knew what they were going to do to him and he presented himself he wasn't being forced to go to the cross but he willingly did it and this is what it looks like in us too that we will only come we're not forced to do it he to get us surrender and Abraham did not have to chase Isaac the rest of his life to get him to surrender he didn't have to chase him around the the desert Come On Son get up here come on and he's chasing her you got to do this God said do it you have to chase Isaac there's no scripture for that he willingly presented his body to his father praise the Lord he trusted God like his father trusted and he got up all right everybody's quiet he got up on the dentist chair next last Wednesday night listen to it the son willingly got up on the dentist chair because Dad said it's gonna be okay this is going to be for your good he willingly got up because he had the same trust daddy the dentist is going to help you you're going to go through some pain but in the long run it's going to be good and he trusts the the father's trust the son how many wants the same trust that Christ had going to Calvary amen you got to trust God you got to trust God so he willingly he comes up and he he he Abraham didn't have to chase him but he willingly gets up into the dentist chair it's going to be for your good there is no resistance to the king like vashti had that took an Esther there's no resistance to the king but vashti had a resistance to the king so there has to be a willingness there has to be a surrender there has to be a trust so praise the Lord he willingly offered and this is what Paul said that you present yours present your bodies present you present you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy unto God which is your if you have your Bible still open if you have it up there you can read it but I'm just going to clip along here in these scriptures I'm just breaking these down tonight so we understand a little better so now it's amazing that in in this chapter he deals with the relationship with others most of this chapter in Romans 12 deals with uh interacting with the body of Christ interacting with others and even mentions uh there picking it up talking about bless them which persecute you so that's relationship that's the ones that are you're around that's persecuting you um there he mentions recompense no evil no man evil for evil don't try to find me here I'm all over the place in Romans here right now but uh avenge not yourself so you have that tendency to want to they did me wrong I'm going to get them back and God says lead the Vengeance to me then Jesus's mind say the Lord so this is about relationships it's about interacting with not just Believers but people so what's amazing to me is the entire Romans 12 the entire thing has the theme of relationships with other people and he starts the theme with offering yourself as a Living Sacrifice and that teaches us that relationships will call on this thing of sacrifice all the time good the reason he presents presents your body as a Living Sacrifice and then he talks about relationship with us because if you're going to have good relationships and you're going to have right relationships you will and never eliminate sacrificing yourself you're listening marriages you're never going to eliminate sacrifice in your own wants and wishes sometimes and sacrificing yourself to make that relationship work in the marriage there's going to be sacrifice involved that's why people sixty percent bail out and get a divorce now because why I don't have to sacrifice I'm not going to do this and I I married her for this or I married him for that all the christ-like sacrifices eliminated and you can never do that with relationships friendships marriages families brothers and sisters whatever it is Paul says before he talks about these relationships present your body a Living Sacrifice because it will be you sacrificing yourself to make the relationships correct is that okay so now he teaches he starts it off with that in verse 2 and be not TR conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so right away in the second verse and this is one of the best places to express a lot of what I believe on something and that is when he says that to be not conform this word but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind those two words speak to me I don't know if they do to you but they speak to me transformed is a is a change by the renewing of your mind both those words tell me this is not just one night in an altar and everything's done in an altar can you say man this is the growth to maturity this is so God begins his work in you you become a Living Sacrifice because if there wasn't more to do why would Paul teach on you presenting your body as a Living Sacrifice it's done at Calvary it's done it's over I'm as good and in heaven good as in in heaven remember that guy talked to him a long time I I was at a concert and went back and around I don't know if he was singing or what but he's in the back of a van there in the back backstage and he's smoking a cigarette and I knew that he got up there and talked all about God and I said what are you doing there you know and he was a I think a Baptist man he said I'm perfectly fine I'm saved Sanctified gonna go to Heaven someday be with my Lord someday instead of smoking a cigarette I said I'm sorry sir that that just that doesn't work but I just left it alone because that's how he's been taught that's how he looks at it that there's there's hardly any surrender in the body when you come down to Romans 12 and he says no it's not over just at Calvary from here on out we start surrendering ourselves more and more so this is a growth this is not one night in an altar and it's all done I'm headed in a Rapture and I basically can treat other people the way that I want to treat them I can basically keep my anger and resentment toward somebody it doesn't matter that's not what Paul's saying and he's saying we're being transformed we're being renewed in our minds can you say Amen so uh and I love this because it's in this word of transformation a changing of the mind and the prophet brings it in for some messages on called The Power of transformation in 1965 and he reads this same scripture Romans 12. remember it's the end of 65 and this is how he introduces the subject remember the subject is going to be a seed when you're talking about a seed he lays in the seed be transformed by the renew of your mind now you that you're a seed then that seed is going to go through a process through the right water through the right environment that seed has to grow that seed will be if if God predestinated that seed to be something no matter what seed it is it's the potential is all in that seed when it's there I put up some apples to you some apple seeds one day and all the potential for some 12 000 apples from one seed all those apples lay in that one seed all the potential lays there but you can't see it yet what it's got to be supplanted it becomes a Seedling it comes up there's no apples yet it grows out of the ground there's no apples yet it grows up a tree there's no apples yet it grows up into branches there's no apples yet and now all of a sudden something pops out of the branches and you get to see what it was meant for the fruit of it that didn't happen overnight that seed began to transform Itself by a predestinated plan if you're a seed of God here tonight all the potential of God already lays within you is that what the word teaches it and I taught it to the brothers the potentials that the potentials of Christ taught to the brothers last weekend or two weekends ago at the men's meeting Brothers you know all those apples and I'll go ahead and tell the story because if you many of you weren't there of course I brought up a whole basket of apples in front of them and they had to get rid of them so I just started throwing apples at the brothers right in that conference room I hit the ceiling and one cracked and spilled over a guy that was bald it didn't work out so well but I just told him I'm not a polished preacher who has a bunch of PowerPoints I said this is my visual and I started throwing apples at him so they would remember and I guarantee you they won't ever forget an apple being splattered down on somebody it'll never forget that that's my visuals started throwing them out throwing a Gideon but you know what it's to get the point across if that's true in the natural it's certainly true in the spiritual you have potentials laying within you but they don't come out overnight they don't come out one night in an altar they come out as you go through the sufferings and the surrendering with Christ as you go through that then more of those that fruit comes out so this is the way I believe it and so this is a a quote a paragraph if you guys have it that I have read as soon as he reads the scriptures this is what brother Graham said and I've read this quote over and over for years now that this he says as soon as he reads the scripture now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have now now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought into the perf what's that that's a growth that we be brought into the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word now my subject is the power of transforming transformation I've read that over and over again for years because why it it speaks of a growth it doesn't speak of a one-time event when your Nature's change it's a moment's event filled with the Holy Ghost but now we get to see if the real thing is there as you surrender to him we get to be able to see uh and it's kind of like bringing up Isaac running because you know you got to present yourself God wants you to present yourself but there are some people that right away Lord here I am all of me I remember my dad laying his watching as billfold on the altar my money's yours my time is yours he laid it all and boy did he have surrender mom and I were having breakfast this morning and you know we talked about the good jobs that he had in the factories up here in Michigan opportunities and when God kept calling to the ministry he laid it all aside went into full-time Ministry and God blessed that because he obeyed the will of God amen but you see now there's some people that just right away all right I'm all yours Lord do what with me what you want but there might be some Isaacs that are running through the desert and they know they need to come and present themselves but it's years sometimes before because they're trying to get around that full surrender and if they're son and daughter of God you can run but you can't hide you better off to say okay I'm here I'm Yours Lord what do you want to do with me this thing doesn't get by without a complete surrender can you say Amen can I hear you say Amen online how about online amen you're not going to get around this Joseph what came in as Christ came in charge of the entire land Joseph in the Bible and so God anointed him by a dream to get all the Harvest and start packing it in all these big vaults and these big things because God showed him was going to be a famine in the land well the famine actually ended up driving everybody to Egypt to be under Joseph's leadership so the famine came and more people came dependent on him even his own family his dad and his brothers now they're completely dependent on him and then this came and then a drought and then they had no money then they had to sell their cattle and they were they were they were left with nothing why God's teaching that at the end of the day every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess someday that he is Lord how many knows the Bible says that so you can come harder you come easy or you can you know go through tribulation but you see now every man is going to confess he's Lord someday and praise the Lord I like that so now he said now to to be brought into the perfect will of God by that quote be brought into the perfect will of God by so to be brought into his perfect will by God changing Us by changing our thinking and so we got just hints of this here is something here that we could say you could have the Holy Ghost but not be in his perfect will just because of your stinking thinking because he brother Brahm says he says transform from the Natural Things of life so it must be when we first come to the Lord and even get a genuine New Birth we're so naturally minded it's going to take God a long time to purge our minds on the way we think can you say Amen so that's where the transformation comes in Paul's the one who said it how do we transform brother Paul how are we transport Paul how are we transformed how we do it by the renewing of our minds God has to change our thinking about stuff because we're thinking about the natural things of life we need to be transformed so we can finally come in and delivered the perfect will of God so that tells me a person can be born again but not being his perfect will because of their stinking thinking because of the way they think and their stubbornness whatever it is they think about a certain way think about the natural things of life it's in the fight for years for it until God shows them something in the word say you need to quit fighting for prevent possessions you need to quit wearing yourself out running a business so bad and not putting God first you need to stop that and that Don's them oh my goodness I'm doing wrong I could be in his perfect will yeah you see and so I asked this tonight who's willing to say Lord I want to be not in your permissive will but your perfect will I want to be there praise the Lord the next verse says this and this is what all the verse in the Amplified so you can put it up there sister Genie but this is the Amplified so and do not be conformed to this world any longer with its superficial values and Customs but be transformed and progressively changed as you mature spiritually by the renewing of your mind focusing on Godly values and ethical attitudes so that you may prove to yourself for yourselves what the will of God is that which is good and acceptable and perfect in his plan and purpose for you how many you want to find his purpose for you right so we're transformed by the renew our mind and the the end result to that is not just to surrender but we start to fulfill his purpose for our lives what he wants to accomplish what his achievement is can you say Amen so and then it says verse 3 now for by the grace of God given to me I say to every one of you not to think more highly of himself and of his importance and his ability not to think more highly of himself of his own importance or ability that he ought to that he ought to think but to think um so as to have sound judgment as God has a portion to each a degree of faith and a purpose designed for service so now we start to come into relationship and he's saying that here's something through the grace was given to me here's a revelation given to me every man among you should not think of himself more highly than he ought to think why that that's not relationships after Redemption that actually originates in Lucifer to actually think in his mind when he comes into the atmosphere of God can you imagine this now he's allowed into the atmospheres of God he's one of the high Angels right hand man of God and Lucifer gets lifted up and all the time he's coming into the presence of the Lord he's got this thought I want to be worshiped like that I want to be acknowledged I am better than all these angels and I actually can see myself being in the high position above God he's thinking this and very later he carries it out that originates in Satan that's not relationships under Redemption humility is under Redemption can you say amen and the way he says it here is that uh he he's uh if you're going to have right relationships in the body of Christ you can't have a man or woman coming Among Us thinking of themselves more highly than they ought to think um coming with an heir about you or your nose in the air that you're better when you coming in with that air about you will not work in relationships what I find is interesting and don't work with the church but then they go out to the world and they're going to be resisted as well they might get along with people a little bit better but eventually you'll see find a track record of a person that's all about themselves that all along the way relationships broke relationships broke because every atmosphere he goes into he thinks of himself more highly than he ought to think loses jobs he you know I know fellas that every time they go into a job this is like 30 years ago every time they go into a new job within days they're telling me that they can run the company better than the owner that's had it for 30 years and they got all new ideas about how they if they change this and if they do this this would be right and I always want to tell them you know you only just just be humble and do what the boss tells you to do and if the boss invites you in asking for your ideas praise the Lord then give them but they leave they leave they leave because they have a mindset they think of themselves more highly than everybody their gifts are a special gift from God and nobody knows what they know and so everybody needs to come to them and ask for advice and they go from job to job and they have a track record of doing that so even in the world it doesn't work but for certainly in the body of Christ you can't come with an heir about you that your family's better or that you're better with your nose in the air uh you know it won't work around the presence of the Lord hey I've been around I know more than a lot of you you all need me I hope you can acknowledge my gifts that I have and my expertise I'm really good if you don't see how good I am I may have to just move on eventually that's where you see sometimes people go quite often from church to church and the church all okay I'm saying it the church when people go from church to church the church and the church Administration always is the problem in some cases they're that way but when you have a track record and it's always the church became the problem the church did us wrong it's time to look in the mirror something wrong because it can't be every Church something definitely wrong with that so A lot of times if they don't acknowledge my gifts they don't acknowledge my expertise I'm good I know I'm good I know if you don't see how good I am I may have to move on and I need to move on on this subject I guess I've got something here that really is Head and Shoulders above all the others in this congregation I know we think people come in and feel they can never measure up everyone you think well most people come in they think they never measure up to everybody they're below everyone that's really rare most the time it's Pride that comes and we have a lot of know-it-alls that got it figured out already I remember a preacher I won't say his name but you know after a lot of years he said you know some of you have moved here thinking that God sent you here to correct me as the pastor but he said I want to let you know God sent you here not for you to correct me but for me to correct you I've never said that that's pretty bold I've thought it because people come with already I got everything I need to correct this the quotes and he's off here and everything and that just the entrance to that just doesn't sit well with me or with anybody you have to come in humbly and I'm going to get to the the kernel of such a powerful truth that Paul gives us here but let me finish this when you you see now uh when you come with that attitude you got it all figured out it's not the right entrance and Paul's going to be deal what is he dealing with relationships relationship that thinking that says that I I'm thinking a little bit higher than I ought to think of myself it's none of this works and the way to approach it is to think soberly and sound Paul says knowing this here's here's the Rev I'll go ahead and give the revelation of it everyone that's around you look around you right now in this congregation look around you everyone that's around you God has deposited a measure of himself within them and you need to look at it that way or relationships with people in the body will always turn bad every person you say well I don't know who has a birth and I don't listen no we don't know that okay we have characteristics we can see but we don't have a right to put them in a category and say where they're at we're supposed to look at it that when we come in we don't think more highly than we think of ourselves but think soberly that God has dealt Every Man a measure and so if that's true then when I look at everybody then I'm saying not highly enough I'm saying they have a portion within themselves here's humility everybody has something within them that I need that's humility and don't get hung up on their personality if there's a measure of Christ in them you need that measure of Christ you need it then no no I'm so sufficient I know enough I know that person no ever he says God has dealt with every man let's just take that for a minute how many just would just say I want to believe and when I walk around that God has doubt we know that's the truth that people wouldn't be sitting here unless God has dealt with every man and woman here there's something God's done in their life no matter how small God has dealt with them and it may not be the way God dealt with you and they may not have as much knowledge of you as the message they might just barely be around the message and not know all the years of things that you've heard over the pulpit but we're never supposed to look at them as less but something that we need in the body of Christ there's a measure of Christ that we need there instead of we don't need them instead of they don't know very much I'm watching this sister be baptized last Sunday that I'm rejoicing in as she comes and hears the word of God I'm watching a transformation take place in her life and it's a joy that's seeing the glory of God in people and it's happened to so many Through The Years here with all the church politics and all the stuff that goes on get your eyes off of that and look at the glory of God taking somebody with you it's amazing to me and I don't know if she's listening tonight she had to go to Florida there her husband to fix their house and such but my I'm just seeing how God I have never had to go to her and talk to her personally about you know this and what to wear I've never had to do that God there's no resistance God changes the life God does it and God has dealt with every man don't belittle how God has dealt with everybody not only has he dealt with each one but he says he's dealt to every man a Measure of Faith so when you look at someone you should think God has deposited I would love tonight for you if you don't get anything else to get this so when you come around the people of God you look at every one of them say God Mighty the mighty super Supernatural God has deposited something in that person that I need and I am better with it than I am without it instead of thoughts like I'm just better that's all there is to it remember this is your thinking this is what people think people never come and say things like um I'm more High than the rest I just want to let everybody they never say that Paul says for a man not to think himself more highly people never speak I'm better than you it'd be a pretty extreme person that just basically says Brandon I'm better than you you just need to know it it's usually what people are thinking but God knows what you're thinking so it's what people are thinking instead of the thoughts like I'm just better and it's in your thinking no one ever says the words but I'm just better than all of you it shows in their actions but it's in their thinking and that won't work in Christ's like relationships can you say Amen the next verse says I mean that's that's powerful we should we could just stop right there and pray about it when you come amongst the body of Christ let's look at everyone as they have a deposit and a Measure of Faith they have something within them that we need let's not get into this measuring you know we could talk a lot about preachers thinking how effective their gift is and the ones that think that they're supreme or they're Superior or they're are probably not as great as they think they are because for sheep humility is the thing today that speaks more than anything humbling yourself so we get up you know and we get these things going on amongst preachers and I think we should grow beyond that and recognize it's not just the preachers they have gifts of the fivefold ministry but I have a I have a deeper gift in me that's than to preach of a pastor I have a gift of a pastor he's given me God gave it to me I didn't get I didn't go training for it God gave it to me okay but I have a deeper gift with me and a measure of Christ that that lays aside the gift for singing writing songs preaching I have a measure of Christ within me and that's the most important one right but I don't have a measure of Christ that's better than yours right amen I in my gifts to preach I may be able to preach better than brother Tom but I can't lead a sports team like him that is for sure I'd be too wore out first of all but nobody can lead us Sports and kids in sports like brother Tom I wouldn't even touch it he you see and so that means that means we each have an individual gifts that we are he may not be able to write a song but I can't do some of the things that he does those are gifts that God gives us but as far as the measure of Christ it's the same and people need to be treated that way amen the next verse says in verse 4 . well let's finish this so he goes on with the subject for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone remembers one of another he picks up the same subject in First Corinthians we know that when he talks about a natural body spiritual body we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of One Another We're members of one another having them gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity so it's listing a bunch of things here and there really slats within the body that someone that someone gets I Minister on these things before and broke every one of them down because you'll see this in the body that there's different bents in somebody and they'll slowly find that bent in the body of Christ and begin doing that person just gifted at giving giving giving and doing things and you know volunteering and different things they don't do it because they're told they just start doing it because they're gifted to that in the body of Christ that measure God gave him them of Christ in them has a certain bent to it right so if everybody finds their place then once everybody finds their place then everybody respects listen I can't do what that person does like them but I'm going to support them get behind them we want to see all those gifts working in the church we have a lovely group of people here the people have found many have found their gifts they're finding gifts and it works in continuity helps me as a pastor a lot assistant pastor it's just a wonderful group that we have here of different ones finding their little niche as it was and some of that may not be here visible for every service like the video people and the audio people some of it may be gifted to as an exhortation to somebody outside of a service they're given an exhortation to somebody God gave them a dream to give to somebody so there's a lot work of the Holy Spirit going on not just in the services amen he that ruleth with diligent he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness so you can study that on your own it just shows the variety of different ways God uses different ones and we need to respect that we need to don't think that need to think that our gift is better or at a better level we don't need to think that way matter of fact the one that comes to higher popularity needs to become more of a servant all along and more humble verse 9 is what I want to get to before we close tonight and I won't be long let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good so I want to concentrate on this Let Your Love be without dissimulation what does dissimulation mean I'm glad you asked dissimulation means hypocrisy when you love when you express love always have it without hypocrisy don't express it with anything tainted to it so you can imagine now Redemption relationships after Redemption is a pure love Fountain fountain flowing from God flowing into us and when we express that love it doesn't need to come through our mind and come through our prejudice and it doesn't need to be selective it doesn't need to come through any filters no the love of God comes out from the Fountain of God coming out of us and needs to be with no hypocrisy in it it needs to be real can you say Amen love one another without hypocrisy this is what the Holy Ghost brings relationships without phoniness without hiding and without being Too Faced brother Burley calls it to Facebook not Facebook to Facebook and he says that because people will be two-faced there's something in church there's somebody in church different than what they post online sometimes they're two-faced is this the same person I don't know so that's what he calls it so anyway uh but hiding relationship without phonies without hiding without being Too Faced This is Love Without dissimulation love when expressed must be pure and from the pure Fountain of God it cannot have any carnal editions or agendas with it the love of God as is expressed cannot have carnal additions to it or agendas or taken away from it it can't have racism love on his best can have cannot have racism in it it can have Prejudice in it it can't be selective is anybody hear what I'm saying tonight Paul's teaching not mine Let Your Love be without any phoniness or any taintedness any agendas not the selective thing loving certain ones and not loving the other it can't be with hypocrisy mixed with it it can't be just a pass of hate it can't be sloppy agape everybody's tired tonight so I have to let my jokes linger a while till you catch it can't be sloppy Agape it can't be passive hate it's got to be real genuine untainted pure love expressed to everyone unrestrained no hypocrisy not being Too Faced one writer says so when the Apostle Paul tells us to walk in love that is without dissimulation he means this and this is the way he worded the scripture if you are going to say you love someone then make sure you really love them don't give an impression that isn't true don't say one thing and then do another your love should be without hypocrisy so don't be phony when it comes to the subject of love the pure love of God doesn't need your tainted things added to it in your history your past of people doing you wrong that's the thing is we we put that on the new person we just met we take all of our past people that's hurt us and now we're going to be restricted because this person is bearing the blunt of everything that you've been through before that's not fair can you say Amen when we express the love of God that person deserves all of it expressed to them without being selective so I like the way he words it there and he goes on to say let me ask you a question as I bring this to a close tonight let me ask you a question have you ever been to faced with people who thought you were their friend did you say one thing to them but later talk behind their backs has anybody ever done that did you do exactly the same thing that someone else is doing to you right now is it possible that you are reaping what you have sown instead of getting bitter and hard-hearted towards someone who has acted hypocritically in his friendship with you learn from this experience make a decision that you will not be phony or hypocritical in your relationships the way this person has been to you meanwhile make sure you forgive those who have wronged you let it go and do your best to overlook their inconsistencies the Lord will probably deal with them about their actions so if they come to you in Repentance let them know that they are forgiven but most importantly let this be a time when you decide that you will not be guilty of giving a false impression to a friend let Your Love be real don't be a phony as I'm closing I read this by Brother Branham I like real love genuine love something that you can feel Paul Rader said one time brother Billy I was leaving my wife one morning said we were sitting at the table and I got up kind of on the wrong side of the bed and I'd said something to her I know that hurt her feelings and I said I never apologized and he said she said Paul will you go with me somewhere tonight and he said I can't he said I can't do it and just went on like that and said I was just in a meeting and had stirred I mean had me all stirred and I had to go to the office said you know how a fella gets said I I went out the door and I said she always met me at the door and kissed me goodbye said she was standing there when I kissed her I said goodbye and said she said goodbye and said I walked out on the end of the gate and said when I close the gate and looked back said she always waved her goodbye at me and I said I turned around and looked and I said goodbye and she said goodbye and said when I went on down the street I began to think about it said my how can I stand it said what if something happened to me today that's my sweetheart said I look I said something I ought on to said his heart got to swelling big turned around run back in real quick jerk the door open and looked around he heard somebody crying she was standing behind the door crying and said he looked around grabbed her by the shoulder pulled her around kissed her as big as he could like that walked out and shut the door went out the gate and said goodbye and she said goodbye he said just like she did the other time but the last time had feeling in it so that's the way it is about knowing Christ you can know him but as they're feeling a real a feeling of real love feeling a real Fellowship that's the way that's the secret to success that's the way it's a real genuine love that's just not put on that's not put on it's real and God knows it's real and so does Satan know it's real when you love the Lord with a real genuine love amen let's Stand Together precious Lord we thank you for this study tonight Lord we're always bringing our hearts to you to say I want to live that way I want to live the way that you want me to live not by duty but by the flowing Waters of divine love that comes from the soul now you mentioned it said in the great day of the feast out of man shall come flowing rivers of Living Water shall come out of him in that day and that's when the Holy Ghost will come because all these fountains that come from heaven now will be in the soul of Believers and everything that's pure and every good thing of God in every bit of the Divine love is going to flow through a group of people not from a book not from a tape not from a phone and not from a church that's going to flow from individuals so Lord Paul teaches us tonight that's still so relevant today that we should present our bodies a Living Sacrifice to you Lord willingly offer up and say it's a sacrifice and I'm going to give that sacrifice so that my relationship with you and my relationship with others would be better Lord then comes in the middle and says Let Your Love if you're going to express love Let It Love Without be without any hypocrisy with any without any phoniness without any racism or selective God help it to be purged of that and let it to be just pure just the way that you loved us and Lord let it have feeling in it as the prophet said let it not just be words I love you I love you I love you but let there be a great amount of flowing love that comes from the I love you great amount of feeling in it that we mean it when we say we love you when we say we love someone else let it be the expression of a real true meaning and feeling behind it granted Lord as we seek you in all things and seek to follow you each day we ask it in Jesus name amen
