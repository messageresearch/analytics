certainly are glad to be in the house of the Lord to worship him during this Christmas time and how many know that he's present with us certainly feel his presence he's come to visit us this morning and to speak to us I just can't get over that line and that song this morning that lyric that I held you in the beginning it's important that we hold on to him when we can't see anything if we hold on to him then at the end he'll hold on to us amen praise the lord we invite your attention to Matthew chapter 1 this morning in your Bibles Matthew chapter 1 and I'd like to speak on the birth of Christ under strange circumstances and this was given to me 3 or 4 days ago in my morning devotion as I was reading the scripture and I trust it'll be a blessing to you and that we be filled with more of his Spirit refilled with his Spirit we come to know him in a deeper way praise the Lord I have some announcements just I'm just going to leave them to the end today Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus our heavenly father we pray Lord as we've gathered this morning that you will bless your word Lord the song that brother Gideon sang this morning Lord that we're rich in faith and hope and love I stand here this morning and I know many of the people can identify and agree that we are a very blessed people we are very rich people Lord we may not be rich in these Earthly goods and Lord there might be different ones in the congregation Lord trying to make ends meet and things but Lord we are so wealthy when it comes to the Revelation and the the things you have done to touch our hearts and change our lives we are a rich people so Lord we can only reach back on this this Christmas Eve and just worship you and express our hearts to you and sing to the top of our our voices Lord let it be just a little incense that would rise to you this morning that you know Lord that you are loved and that you are appreciated and that you're adored and Lord that you're worshiped this morning from the depths of our heart we're so thankful father we're so blessed and Lord one of the things that we enjoy as a Believer is that we might have many things that's happened in the past to us but Lord today we know that we can look with hope and with Joy To The Future because we have our future in your hands and Lord when we held on to you at the beginning you will hold on to us at the end Lord Jesus I anchor that that this morning as that lyric has ministered to me and now this little message that You' given me for the people may it minister to them may we grow we pray father in Grace and knowledge of Christ as we commit this service to you in Jesus name amen I bless you may be seated this morning praise the Lord I'm just going to work my way a little bit through the scriptures here this morning and as I said I want to speak on the birth of Christ under strange circumstances and when it worded it this way when it said the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise the Amplified says there the birth took place under these type of circumstances and when I was reading it the other day I realized that the that his birth took place was kind of a strange setting and that's why I've titled that this morning the birth of Christ under strange circumstances because the circumstances and the setting and what took place and how it took place was uh from the carnal mind a pretty troubling type of setting it was a pretty strange setting and as a matter of fact we wouldn't believe that God would be doing something as great as send coming himself and connecting with us as God he would do as it says in the scripture for the purpose of saving his people from their sins I'll tell you that's a pretty big condescension that's a pretty big moment that's happening right here that he's beginning the process of saving his people from their sins how many know that you're a sinner this morning we're all Sinners without hope without Christ coming can you say amen I I praise uh Franklin Graham as I was reading yesterday and he was uh addressing the Pope's new uh new thing to that the priest can bless uh uh homosexual marriage and everything they can bring a blessing they don't have to line up with the word but they can bless it and Franklin Graham basically said listen we're all Sinners and we all need Christ and even the pope is a centner woo is he ever going to get in trouble for that but the man spoke truth and he says I don't know what he's doing it's going to bring all kinds of confusion he said but we when we all come before God we're going to need the blood of Jesus Christ else we come under judgment for our sin and he told it straight can you say Amen so this is a very amazing spot of Prophecy to be fulfilled it's one of the greatest uh places of Prophecy to be fulfilled that it's called Emmanuel this would be God with us this would be so significant it's God With Us it's God condescending to us and we know he came in a little baby at first and began life that way but it was actually God condescending to us it was God coming and connecting with us it was it was the birth of the king not a king it was the birth of the ultimate King and and and yet it's in shrouded it's it's it's surrounded and clouded as if I could say that the whole greatest thing of the birth of Christ was clouded by very strange circumstances and in fact I can safely say that that it this this um this situation that Christ was born in was actually out of sync completely with the normal thought patterns of the world and also I want to emphasize this he came out of sync with the normal thought patterns of the religious organizations completely contrary to the way they thought he would come because even their minds in relig religious denominations and organization even their minds although they were worship Shing God their minds had be become Twisted by their Creeds and their dogmas that they weren't looking at God correctly they didn't see God right so when he slipped in in Simplicity and enshrouded with kind of a a situation that was very very strange and looked ungodly when God came in that they were so messed up in the way they thought about God is that they couldn't understand why God would do this and so uh because it was against the thought patterns and the normal thought patterns it seems that it's a strange circumstances and the carnal mind the carnal mind would never see this never understand this if they seen God behind this it would take a revelation to see God behind the circumstances can you say Amen so you can really say it this way to make it understandable this wonderful Jewish believing couple believed in Jehovah God this wonderful Jewish believing couple Joseph Mary fell in love and they got engaged it sounds good so far this wonderful Jewish believing couple Joseph and Mary fell in love and got engaged and then she turns up pregnant before they got married said she turns up pregnant before they got married and they hadn't been together yet to have a child they're only engaged a spouse to one another the final marriage hadn't taken place and they were not together yet and and she turns up pregnant so you could easily you could really say that this is circumstances that are very very strange for God to be born in and come in his kingdom and first of all It Don't Fit with how God in our minds would do things remember how many believe it this morning remember God is a righteous God he is righteous he's the ultimate of righteous he's where we get righteousness from how many believe God is righteous how many believe he's the only one that's righteous and so we know that and most people go we know God is righteous and it don't seem like God like his nature to reveal and to bring his righteousness to us with circumstances that did not look righteous at all and when you take the laws of God and the things that we're still today teaching young people about uh saving sex before marriage and saving that honor for the marriage day and all these things that were taught to the Jews in the Old Testament we still teach today even in 2023 because there are God's principles they're God's laws and they are true can you say amen and they still apply to the human being can you say Amen so this is what Joseph and Mary believe this is what Mary's parents believe this is what the churches still held on to as a matter of fact the law they held on to so long if somebody committed adultery then they held to the Old Law that they had to be stoned they actually had to be stoned if they broke that and were found pregnant before the marriage so now this is what happens and so the carnal mind could never look at what's happening and see God behind it I'm just stopping for a minute and I'm saying why Lord why Lord did you do it this way and I don't even have all the answers because I don't understand all of God but I know I can look through the Bible and see a pattern of him when he comes he reveals himself in Simplicity and also he comes and he's working in a in in a thing that if we looked at it from our eyes carnally we wouldn't find God in it why don't I just jump to you on why don't I talk about you when you're living in sin and when you're out there and then God begins to work in your life and you still got habits and different things but God's being to beginning to work and nobody knows what what's happening it's a good thing God didn't judge you right there it's a good thing he could look inside and see the seat of God within you it's a good thing that somebody could look beyond what was happening in your circumstances I'm preaching to you today we have to look past the circumstances that surround our life and we have to be looking for the god that's trying to reveal himself L we miss god brother Paul I've had some trouble this year that I never dreamed what happen in my family domestic life whatever has happened I've had some things you wouldn't dream it's unprecedented well it's not unprecedented it's probably happened before but you think it's unprecedented but when you look at it with from the carnal eyes and the embarrassment of everything everybody else that sees your life you can only be looking at your circumstances but there's only one answer from the message that we're to look at in circumstances we are not to bow to our circumstances we are not to read read the wrong thing into our circumstances we're actually supposed to embrace our particular circumstances because we know that in those things God can be revealing himself if I have any lesson for the church this year this is my this is my New Year's revelation we better stop looking at the outside and the surface we better start looking for God to be revealing yourself I'm looking for God where is he trying to reveal himself is everybody with me because you can judge matters and think you got it right and you're completely wrong you can judge another person by even how they would act or dress sometimes and you can judge it completely wrong we have to grow up and not judge things by the flesh Paul said we know no man after the flesh including Jesus Christ he says I know we knew him after the flesh he lived here for 30 but we can't even know Jesus after the flesh we have to know him by this Elohim this being this Christ that comes into our lives but we can't know any man after the Flesh and so now we find then that first of all you don't see God that would fit into these things because he's a righteous God I'm going to get into that a little bit more in a minute what righteousness really is it don't seem like God would reveal himself and bring his righteousness in circumstances that were not righteous at all and yet we know from 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 27 it expresses to us that God will stumble conventional wisdom and will hide himself in base things this is the way it's worded 1 Corinthians uh 1:27 but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh could glory in his presence God's got an agenda God's going to make the world look stupid one day come on can you say amen God is going to confound the wise God he's already done it he'll do it again that someday they're going to say there is no way that God sent his last day's message through a package like this there's no way you can do it but God's going to confound all the wisdoms of every University of every Seminary of every God is going to make them look stupid when he shows that's exactly what I was doing in the end time and you missed [Applause] me so we know by 1 Corinthians 1 that's God's nature to do that so it's not like God in our own minds to do things this way and then through the eyes of everyone around Mary and Joseph think about it now when this happens and she comes to her mom and dad and says I'm pregnant you know uh Through The Eyes of everyone Mary's parents Joseph Mary the church that was around them would who would eventually hear you know word bad uh negative travels faster than positive oh yes and so uh everyone's going to know about it and through the Through The Eyes this all looks very very bad and also it looks embarrassing one of the Traditions that we have and I've told you before we we watch during Christmas time I don't know if it be tonight or tomorrow we watch a movie it's called The Nativity Story please don't tell the whole world we watch a movie but if anybody hears it's a movie about it's one of the best movies about the birth birth of Christ and how Mary went through all those Transitions and so we watch it every year and uh I love it because it's so real in some places a lot of the you know the the movies of Christ are just really glossed over and a bit too Orthodox and even the music is orthodox but this one they're really real and and so when when Mary and Joseph's parents and I can't remember completely I should remember it because we watch it every year but I can't remember what Happ was but I know the tension and I know Mary's dad he became he didn't know what to do when he heard this she's sitting there by herself saying the angel told her this and their spouse he's encouraged this engagement with Joseph and Mary he's real proud because he's got a business and he's watching out for his daughter he's got a good Mary was a little reluctant in the movie to to go with him but they you know they eventually fell in love and so now this whole he's very happy why is the Daddy happy this is going to be a normal thing I got somebody to take care of my daughter this a normal life and then the girl his daughter comes and says I'm pregnant what what and it's just you see the tension mared Mar he's he's you know he's pacing the floor and then he looks at Joseph and Joseph's going because in something like this you're trying to find somebody to blame you're trying to find what's going on this is interrupting the whole plan the whole normal let me tell you something God will interrupt your plan you people that are control freaks get ready for a lesson if you come close to God God's going to show you you're not in control of life you're not in control of your family and so Mary's dad felt that's this is all in the bag everything is normal and she turns up pregnant and so now the people are going to hear with everybody who looks from that point on this whole thing is going to be embarrassing it's going to be looked down on and yet in the middle of this is what God's doing to bring his kingdom to the world to the earth I don't understand all that I don't understand some of the people that are sitting here this morning I don't understand some of you you shouldn't be here in church with your family worshiping the way that you're worshiping everything in the carnal mind says no not you when you look at when I'm looking over your lives and seeing some of you shouldn't be here some of you come up under a real strict background and so sometimes that strictness makes you distant towards God and you're hesitant towards God because you come up in a legalistic background but some didn't we got some drug addicts here we got some people that slept around we got some people you're sitting next to you that weren't perfect we got a deacon here with a lot of facial hair that you've heard his testimony of what he came from there isn't anything our caral minds and say this young man and his family should be sitting here filled with the spirit of God there isn't anything that says it but I'm telling you why we looked and maybe could judge God was doing something in his life is Lindsay's life and if we' have been too quick to judge and if you do that one we got all kinds of testimonies here this morning you shouldn't be here and that's why we have to mature and grow and not judge things by the outside appearance because the circumstances can look very very unrighteous and God's trying to birth true righteousness can I get a witness this morning when God's trying to birth true righteousness in us and I'll get to this in a minute he may have to purge self-righteousness even people in the message who have become self-righteous they got it all figure out they know everything they got everybody figured out there's a stage that Christians go through many go through depending on their personality they go through a legalistic stage so they get Sanctified sometimes they're just Sanctified don't have the Holy Ghost yet but boy they're really on a campaign now purging their life from everything they're going to cleanse everything and they're going to make sure everybody else cleanses their life then they become critical and legalistic towards other people their daughter's not dressing right their son's not dressing right they become critical because they're going through a stage in their life that everything is only through their eyes righteousness is through their eyes and they see those quotes and they jump onto them but they become real Pharisees with them because they're apply them to everybody else nobody's Measuring Up nobody's really living as close to God as they are I didn't expect it's not in my notes I'm saying it anyway and God if they're a Son of God God will have to deal with that man in such a deep way to show him how filthy his righteous really is and God did not send us a message so that we can enhance our own righteousness God sent us a revelation of his atonement that we don't need any of our righteousness we need the righteousness of God can I get a witness this morning yeah it's just a stage and you just let them go through it and if they're a Son of God but you see when it all looks bad you know when things look bad in the circumstances and and there's a maybe even a a a just a a shadow over this whole thing how do you convince anyone in this world that this word is right this word the words being fulfilled in the last days this is God coming to us how do you witness to someone that this is the word of the hour and this is the message when it comes in this kind of package it's a hard sell it was a hard sell for Mary but she kept holding on to she said listen the angel of the Lord spoke to me and I don't care if the highest priest in Jerusalem says I'm a liar I know that his word is being born in me and birth I don't care if the greatest theologians in Jerusalem can dispel this and but I'm saying the word he spoke to me I know this true and I'm ready to bear this message I'm ready to Bear the reproach that goes with it I'm ready to Bear articles and and news articles and interviews and things that's taken place more and more against the last day's message I'm ready to Bear the reproach of it because it's not about figuring this message out with my mind it's about what he's done in my heart somebody say praise the Lord hallelujah and when it all looks bad then it's a hard witness sometimes but we keep on witnessing we keep saying it's the truth hallelujah huj it's easy for us today to believe this was Emanuel 2,000 years ago it's easy for us to believe because we see he was birthed we see that he grew up we see he had Miracles and signs and wonders there's no man like this in the face of the Earth that's lived for 33 years then we see it all end in a death burial and a resurrection his he has an empty tomb so now it's easy for us to say today that this was Emanuel but back when he was being born nobody could identify and say there's no way that Emanuel God With Us is happening in these circumstances everybody can say it today a matter of fact you can have unbelievers singing carols with you about Emanuel God With Us they sing right along with you outright unbelievers will join in the carolling and join in the songs this powerful birth of the Son of God and God came to us and you know sometimes atheists will just join right in and maybe it better than you after seeing all that Jesus did in his life most will say it's God now but in that hour the circumstances around it would have you very confused that can't be God that can't be God working it's just not the way that God would do it and verse 19 speaks of Joseph now I want you to start bringing this out verse 19 Matthew 1:19 then after we they all find out about the pregnancy then we find out verse 19 then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make make her a public example was minded to put her away privately so now here's the next thing I want to show that we can do sometimes is that when you have something embarrassing take place and and and and and you have something even in your own life a mistake or whatever and you have something Tak place we're always trying to what can we do in our minds to cover this up what can we do to fix this how can we minimize the gossip is anybody listening this morning how can we and so Joseph and and Mary's dad is in this mode of trying to to to to to get something together here to keep this private because it's embarrassing to the family what do we do here why can't we do this and and and so so the thoughts and this is when circumstances happen in our lives that are not pleasant that are negative the first thing we engage in is our mind and our thought life to try to figure out how to fix it try to hide it because no human being likes to be embarrassed we all like to appear good to everybody else and so when something happens when your testimony something's going to go out that you're not uh uh coming out smelling like a rose we will do things on our mind to try to private and he says he's a just man I think it was very honorable I've preached that to young people this was an honorable man because he's thinking of Mary and all that's going to go around about her so he's thinking I'll just go ahead and start start the divorce proceedings even before we're technically married and we'll keep this as private as we can and we'll do this that and the other and so that was all fine that was all fine that was just but that wasn't God's plan and because Joseph was going to act upon this and not marry her the angel of the Lord had to step in like he has to step in with your life sometimes when your mind has figured everything out and you're going to do it this way to cover for yourself the angel of the Lord May step into your life and say no no you're not going to do that because what you don't see is what's happening is the word is being fulfilled in your life how many would raise your hand and say I thank God for his grace in my life that he sends his angels his Messengers his 5-4 ministry and when I was about ready to act upon foolishness and act upon something that I thought was right the angel of the Lord over the pulpit stood and said don't do that stop sit still watch I was looking for a quote last night I was looking cuz there's some situation where that I can't remember who it was maybe it was just a few months ago but it's just like sit still God's doing something sit still God's doing something don't act too quickly cuz God's doing something and that's the way we got to be in maturity we got to be careful that we don't act too quickly with this can I get an amen this morning we got to be careful that we don't act too quickly when our circumstances make us embarrassed and we got to do something about it maybe sit still God might be doing something sit still and see the glory of God stand still and see the glory of God we act upon our own carnal Minds because sometimes of the embarrassment of what it's going to look like to everybody else and this is the mode that Joseph was in and he's a man of honor and respect to help cover for Mary he sets out to do a private divorce really thinking to think through all this and figure out a plan we do that in our circumstances trying to figure out our ourselves the best way we can do things because it makes us nervous when something happens out of the normal is anybody listening it makes us nervous when something happens out of the normal it's going to look bad to everyone else it's going to make you look bad and human beings do not like looking bad often human beings do not look they don't like looking bad and often they deflect attention to someone else by gossiping and putting another one down people criticize to make them themselves look better but human because human being beings don't like to be uh to be looked at in a way that would embarrass them and human beings don't like criticism I don't like criticism I'm a human being it's all together important how we react to criticism had an older Minister tell me one time we might as well accept the fact we will be criticized I as a pastor will be criticized but I must choose what I'm criticized for and if I'm criticized for preaching the balance of God's word with all my heart if I make a mistake I believe God will correct me but if I am criticized for striving for a balance to preach the full counsel of this message let that criticism come I embrace it because I'm going to stay with that balance my my my point is to you this morning is we step into action quickly sometimes to deal with situations and is amazing what we do to cover up our shame and our embarrassment so that we can look righteous and holy in front of everybody life dishes out some abnormal things and we want to appear normal we want to appear good to everyone this mindset is flawed that's right this action and effort to make ourselves look good to everybody is flawed because it's trying to work it out ourselves it's trying to make us appear right to others but the main reason it's f is it might be against what God is really trying to do God may be trying to reveal his true righteousness and you are trying to maintain your own righteousness why not stop and watch what God is doing let me talk about righteousness for a minute human beings have had not not had not had human beings have not had a good success interpreting the righteousness of God we're talking 6,000 years human beings do not have a good success rate at interpreting what the righteousness of God really is even after Moses brought the law which was from God they took it and they made it something else and then 400 years before Jesus that we developed these Pharisees and Sadducees that were believe the law but they actually took the law and added to it and added some things to it that weren't actually in there but it was there interpretation of the law and so now it by the time Jesus got here to come they're so rapid up in the law being the righteousness of God if you do the law and if you do it right and if you do it perfect you have God's righteousness and I'm here to tell you scripturally the law is not the righteousness of God news flash I'm getting ready to read some scriptures in Romans that Paul had to separate the law from the righteousness of God he's the one that used the term the righteousness of God the righteousness of God and he separates us say the law is not the righteousness of God cuz if that were true we didn't need Calvary we didn't need the Son of God to become and die for our sins can you say Amen because we already had enough righteousness to be acceptable to God but if we just did the law if we did the law we'll be fine the righteousness of God is not the law of God and so human beings they judge by the surface they judge by what's on the outside they take the fruits of the law and the fruits excuse me the fruits of righteousness and say that's righteous so now you do have the fruits of righteousness because there's a scripture in uh Philippians 1:1 that says being filled with the fruits of righteousness so there are fruits that come from his righteousness but the fruits are not the actual righteousness they're only the fruits of righteousness denomination makes the fruits the actual righteousness that's scary because we could have manifested all the fruits and put them on and do them and if you honor God's word and you do it praise the Lord God will honor you that's a wonderful thing but don't ever say that you're righteous before God because you do the law that's a twisting of man the righteousness of God is much deeper than just doing the law it's it's the person of righteousness it's him can you say Amen he's the only one there's you know the the Rich Young Ruler come to Jesus and said good master and he corrected him right away he said good he said there's none good but God he's correcting because he's getting ready to judge the Commandments and his acceptance of eternal life he's getting ready to judge it by what can I do more to get eternal life what can I do more and he says have you followed the law he says yeah I've done this since I was a kid I've done all that and I still don't have eternal life but the first thing Jesus had to say to him was to say don't call me good there's none good but God a foundational thing that you need to know before you can properly come to the righteousness of God is to say there is no one righteous except God there's no one righteous except God and if we have it it's because by spirit that same God has come in us so I'm I'm off my notes here but 6,000 years of bad history of human beings don't let human me beings don't let denominational systems don't let theologians and the message mess with the righteousness of God that's right they never get it right now we go back in our Bibles with through the road Romans road all have sinned and come short of the glory of God all these the Romans road they call it he bring somebody through it and then and then Paul goes to Abraham reachs back to their their father literally he reaches back to their father Abraham because their lineage we came from Abraham we're Abraham's sons okay I'll use Abraham and he goes into this teaching and he says you know that when God came to down and give the word of the Lord to Abraham when he believed that word it says I'm in it for the long haul I'll believe it if I'm 990 years old I'll still be believing it I'm going to have a son you're going to make me a a man of many nations I don't know how it's because my wife is Barren but I believe it with all my heart I'm in for the Long Haul and God's a a credited his account Abraham you are righteous he didn't hear all the other quotes the law hadn't come yet now this is can you imagine Pharisees just trying to figure well wait a minute now how do we bring the law with this you know how do we do this well don't try to figure it all out I'm just telling you that before your law came you're making the law a righteous person that follows the law perfectly but I'm saying your father Abraham he didn't know any of the law he didn't do any of it yet he didn't know the dress code and God says I've imputed it unto Abraham because you believe this way you are righteous before me that's it so there's got to be a key here that when he sends his true word his spoken word of the hour and a heart says like Mary be it unto me according to Thy word I'm willing to go through the reproach I'm willing to be laughed at I don't care what the websites say about it I believe it with all my heart Revelation now you're tapping into the righteousness of God and then we go we make it a dress code which listen friends the fruits of righteousness will bring modesty the fruits of righteousness will bring a distinction in a man and woman what they're wearing the fruits of righteousness will bring the fruits of the spirit in your life right there is fruits of righteousness but you have to have his righteousness first Hallelujah well I'm enjoying this this morning we need to hear this because we can mess with the righteousness of God ourselves we turn it into something and this is why the setting of his birth is enshrouded or or is is covered up because if she comes up pregnant it's probably one of the worst things that could have happened around the birth of Christ for people not to believe that there was a supernatural conception God has placed it in a way that most the people are not going to believe because everybody's in a mindset if she's pregnant she's been with a man that's it that's conventional knowledge and yet their Bible said a virgin shall conceive how did they miss that that it's possible a virgin shall conceive but they what are they covered over by they're covered over by religion they're covered over their concept of God they're covered over by a a righteousness that no you just you stick to your game there and you stick to what you're supposed to be doing now when all this happened it it God I don't know why but he allows it to be and probably in that day the worst thing for a woman to lose her virginity it still should be that way our girls should value them El you say well I made a mistake then get a hold of the thing that you will value yourself get a hold of God can you say Amen you should vow yourself but in that day and in this day but in that day today it's cheapened today it's it's it's mocked today people sleep together they do it all the time it's a mess but back in that day in the Jewish setting it was probably the most thing that's looked down upon and it happens in their eyes they're never going to see it any other way then you try to witness and Mary tries to witness this is Isaiah being fulfilled in me right you're just trying to justify yourself you're trying to find an excuse for you sleeping around or you and Joseph being together you're trying to cover this up they're never going to receive it because God somehow laid it out that way and I don't understand all the reasons but I do know that it's for for a reason it's for a reason that God God's elect God's people could look past the circumstances can I can I just have you drop that truth in you for this coming year how many's excited about the coming year I so excited about this assembly and the the work of God and everything that's taking place in the missions but spiritually we need to be in a mode of looking for God to be manifested in one another and don't stumble at the circumstances let me finish this about the righteousness of God Paul brings it in and he says Romans 1:17 for therein is the righteousness go of God revealed so he's presenting to the Jews to the Romans but he's got to separate the righteousness of God with the law 117 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed so he says we're just now we're just now starting to see what the righteousness of God it's just now being revealed after Christ's first coming Romans 3:21 but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets say I'm going to read it again now Paul says the righteousness of God without the law is being manifested imagine Pharisees and Jews saying what they never separated the law from righteousness now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets Romans 10:3 for they Israel the Jews they the Jews being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God you know if we're going about to establish our own theories and our own righteousness and our own version of the word and our own version of the message if you're busy doing that you may miss the righteousness of God the Jews did it Galatians 2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain once again separating it Philippians 3:9 boy you guys are fast and be found in in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith I love that term the first line and be found in him how many this morning want to only be found in him and in his righteousness not in something you smeared on the outside not in putting on a show to everybody else but I prayed I repented of my sin B AP ized filled with the spirit and I want to be found in his righteousness not my own that day when I go to the other side I want to be found in one thing his righteousness clothed in his righteousness not my own we have to separate it right or we could look look over what God's doing right now we can become blinded by our own righteousness it blinds us to the real manifestation of God in people's lives sometimes a simpler heart sometimes we can be blinded and not see God moving among us and not see what God is doing because we're blinded by our own religion or we're blinded by our complicated heart and sometimes a simpler heart that doesn't know very much catches it and we don't amen Lord help me not to be blinded by my own righteousness Lord help me not to be blinded by my own legalistic ways Lord help me find you I don't want to miss you in every service every day we should be praying is everybody with me this morning we got to be looking at the right thing God I want to find you in this day what do you want to do through me this day what do you want to do in my life looking for the god moments the god moments there there's God moments throughout the day if you get distracted by circumstances you won't you'll miss the god moments Lord help me every day to catch the god moments when I go to church help me catch the god moments what are you trying to say to me help me not to miss those things I had an email this week from the man that sold us this church and if you know the story it was Supernatural all the way through how we got this building every building that we got has been Supernatural but then once again he he He blesses this and we we had a need we didn't have a lot of money and so you know the story uh we seen the building and it was already sold going to closing it was a Christian man who wanted to bring his business in here and change it the neighbors didn't want it he had to fight to get the zoning changed eventually he won and he was getting ready to go to closing we seen the building and then once we seen it my dad said that's the building for you my wife was saying hey she's the one that said we should look for buildings besides building on the other lot she said and a deacon I can't remember brother Jim or one of the deacons said why don't we look for other buildings I said no no no I want to BU I want to stay there I like it and so my stubbornness was don't left my stubborn was is just going to be this way it's the normal we're settled here on Whiteford Road this is you know that you know and God had this in mind that's right and uh you know little did some of you know uh Becca grabbed sister inz and come over here in the in the winter in February the gate was closed she comes over here in a Sunday afternoon after church walks sister inz through the snow and they lay their hands on the building and pray that God will give it to us even though it's sold already cuz she's a woman of Faith sister ANZ she's listening God bless you she's a woman of Faith she's seen it in her life she knows it's real so they do that and then just before we go to Israel I write a little email to um this uh man I say we've seen the building we like it congratulations on your new building and if something happens you know we would be interested in the building that's all I said we should be looking beyond the circumstances to what God's trying to birth is everybody catching that today we have to the message tell us to master our perfect Faith Masters us every circumstance and never caused them for us to miss God so men have done this and even today among ourselves let's just pass some of that but we could go into the our our present environment and go into even uh uh a a mixture of the righteousness of God with Works perfection in the flesh the Holy Ghost when it comes to you is not perfection in the flesh if it's preached that way it's not preached correctly but can we apply these circumstances and the cloud that was over the birth of Christ in his first coming can we apply it to his second coming as well we can because he brought this word of this generation remember now I don't know if you knew this but I want to make sure that I don't assume that you know it the first com coming of Christ was not just a moment true it was a sequence of events it was a cycle of events it began with some dreams to people it began with the prophecy 400 years before then it some people had some dreams and uh and then Elizabeth uh she got pregnant she couldn't get preg she got pregnant and so it was a process then Christ was born but that wasn't the first coming then he would grew up then he had three and a half years of ministry then he died and rose again so the first Advent or the first coming of Christ was not just one moment it was a series of events the last coming of Christ or the second coming is the same way it's not one moment of the Rapture even though we're looking forward to that the second coming begins with the word being born without man's hands on it the Virgin word Born Again Untouched by denomination the seals are taken off of it but if you try to present how God would launch the second coming of Christ and presented uh the seventh angel and the and uh uh Kentucky hillbilly with a seventh grade education God did the whole backrop of how it would happen in a intellectual environment in a seminary environment in a in a figuring everything out in the logistics of it in an intellectual age beyond the industry age the technological age all this would happen and God says in the middle of all that intellect I'm going to pick a seventh grade education man and I'm going to bring this word he'll finish his work and go on to his reward but I'm going to use this fessel it's a hard cell but it ain't different than the first coming and when sin abounds the grace of God abounds even more that's what the Bible says when circumstances become extreme and it looks impossible that's when the god rich in Mercy steps in because we need in this hour a god rich in Mercy families are Tor apart there's things that happen in families we didn't want to happen oh God why did that happen to me that's embarrassing to me and so we we repent we go on with God but thankfully The God Who is rich in Mercy when we need it steps in and he's not he's not poor in Mercy in this day he has to be rich in Mercy how many raise your hand I need a God rich in Mercy with my mistakes I need a God rich in Mercy in leoda in this perverted sexual age when thoughts come to us all the time I tell you I need a God to correct me I need a God rich in Mercy I need his grace I need his his forgiveness can you say amen I needed more than I've ever needed it before amen God always stepped in with a god rich in Mercy the first sin and man's hiding he's in hiding covering himself with fig leaves hiding away from God in his presence he was always in the presence of God always Fellowship me he sins he goes hides like we do he hides away there's people sometimes attending my congregation you're still hiding you still got your wall up oh once you trust the Lord and quit putting your wall up be free in Jesus Christ bring your sins to the cross your pth to the Cross let it all be washed away and be free in Jesus Christ quit holding back quit holding your heart back from the rest of the congregation and from God don't do that don't be afraid of people people may hurt you but you become bigger than that can you say Amen he's he's bigger than all my problems he's bigger than the people who criticized me he's bigger than my past can I get an amen this morning he's bigger than all of that what was I talking about than you Lord please somebody remind me huh God God rich in Mercy and he goes he finds them and he's hi they're hiding say what are you doing hiding he calls them out of their hiding come on I want I've got to find a place to fellowship with you again I tell that was a god rich in Mercy they didn't deserve that right come out here stand out here and they covering themselves said God grabs skins throw those things down throw some skins on you bloody lamb skin and this will begin the beginnings so I can find some place to fellowship with you again friend if you're away from God or your heart is blocked to God there's a God rich in Mercy there is a God who is rich in Mercy and He is wanting his word to be born and manifested in your life oh my I'll finish this next time I like it verse 20 because he says by but while Joseph thought on these things what's he thinking about how can I fix this what can I do put her away privately we got to do this we got to cover it up while he was thinking all those things the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph the son of David fear not why is he saying fear not because he's living under fear because of his circumstance aren't you glad when God rich in Mercy comes and says stop fearing the future stop fearing your circumstance stop being fearful because what's happening in Mary this that is happening was already spoken by a prophet and you're trying to cover it up you're trying to no no no the word the word of is being fulfilled in your life marry that woman you know that I'm just going to close this by saying I got a bunch of quotes I wanted to read and everything I want to say this was the next the last scripture says in verse 25 verse 24 then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had been him and took unto him his wife both Mary and both Joseph when they got the picture from the angel what this really was and what was going on they both offered to God what was needed to begin the process I tell you friends it doesn't take just God's word it takes a heart saying be it unto me it takes a heart said I'm willing to Bear the reproach I'm willing to live like a young girl and dress like a young girl should dress I'm willing to follow God I'm willing to his word to be fulfilled in my life a young man it takes a young man say like Joseph okay now it's settled I'm all in I'm here for the duration and we will carry this word I will take care of this word I will raise this son even though he's not my own I'm I'm all we need young people to say I'm all in we need people to say I'm not on the internet toss between two no I'm all in that's finished I'm done with that I'm all and I'm carrying a burden I'm carrying a reproach people are going to laugh at me but I'm ready to carry the reproach I'm ready to follow through a lot of you done it years ago and you've been carrying it all these years God bless you we're going to continue to carry it until the Rapture we're going to we're going to be on CNN someday that's right we're going to be on CNN and you know what's going to happen it's not going to be the best representation of this message it's probably going to be some of the worst I hope it is I hope it's good but more than likely with the media it's probably not and we Associated and that's when we'll find out where everybody stands it'll be a real revealing time it's already happening but boy when we're on CNN I tell you it'll be a real test that's right because God likes to test his people to prove I got one quote here one quote you guys don't have it up there can I read one quote before we close I read this to the staff the other night I read it I said I just read this in possessing the enemy's Gates and I'll just pick this up and close my Bible just as proof This is the End he's talking about Israel he says it was only a few years later when the Trials come for Israel in the old in the wilderness and the church got All Shook Up as is so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way it's supposed to happen God makes it that way God brings tensions into the church because every son that cometh to God must be tried must be proven and must be tested he lets sickness strike you he lets disease come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the Seed of Abraham why does he do it to show the world this is my Seed of Abraham they believe no matter what they believe people wouldn't know that until God puts a test and puts an environment says wow they're going to be really tested am I going to am I going to keep carrying the burden of this word or am I going to ditch it he permits it that the show the world that you're a Seed of Abraham I'll tell you I'm ready for a test that shows that I'm a true sa Abraham I'm ready for you know well I say I'm ready I'm probably not ready but I just say to the devil Bring it on Bring it on if it's the proof of who his elect are if it's to finish this race Bring It On he permits his own will he permits disasters God permits the F for friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he could do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are taught that these things are more precious than gold to US that's right it's way we got to look at it last Sunday brother Nathan he says it if they haul up with the truck was it going to dump all this gold out would you rather have that gold or would you have your rather have your trials what a great question for us especially those of us that need money right now I use just one block of that gold and we let stand and say I'll take the trials because they're more precious than that gold I'll take the testing I'll take people speaking against me I'll take the tensions in the church we have it we have it but God allows it God permits it to test us are we going to grow up are we going to run away are we going to start doubting the message are we going to start being shaky in and out now I don't know where I stand because uh I don't know where my family stands anymore so now I don't know where I stand some of you young people what if your parents go arai where you going to stand can't depend on your parents that's where do you stand in the word of God what if they go and just you know fly the ceop say I'm finished with us it's happened a lot and then you have young people rise and stand he has revealed himself to me this is not about getting in on the coattail of my parents or my pastor this is that that I grabbed I oh Vanessa I held on to him in the beginning and he'll hold on to me to the end glory be to God hallelujah somebody say praise the Lord stand up so I quit preaching praise the Lord let's give him praise Hallelujah I'm in for the Long Haul I'm in to bear his word you haven't made that commitment to the Lord and you're feeling led to do it this morning don't wait another day don't wait another young person whoever you are don't wait for a full commitment like Joseph and Mary I'm going to marry this girl I'm going to go on with God and whatever persecution I receive from this day forward I'm willing to bear that reproach because his word must be fulfilled in my life if the word could be B certainly be born in me Henry you want to sing that come up here give him a key for that if you don't want to sing it I'll sing it because I was singing it this morning but she was a virgin bride to be you don't want to sing it Henry wrote this many many years ago you know it give give me something come on you come sing it you remember it come on it's your fault you wrote it stand up and be don't be ashamed she was a virgin a little bit higher for him she was a virgin bride to be and one night as she lay quietly the spirit of the Lord or shadow told her yes and said that you'll receive a child that sin cannot defile and she said be it unto me according to Thy [Music] word and she kept these things and pondered them deep within her [Music] heart she believed in [Music] God when he said that something new was going to [Music] startop if the word could be born in Mary it can certainly be born in you and me if the word could be born in May it can certainly be bor born in you and me now virgin bride to be through the blood saved through the blood of Calvary and in this time of Darkness he has come raled a Vindicated word that we all have heard and I can see it being born in you and [Music] me cuz we've kept these things and pondered them deep within our hearts we believed in God when he said that something new was going to [Music] start if the word could be born in Mary it can certainly be born in you and me yes the word had been born in Mary and I can see it being born in you and [Music] me can we just have before we dismiss this morning just bow our heads and close our eyes guys and I'll say it again if you if you're feeling LED of the Lord you should respond to that leading you should respond to that leading if God's doing something in your life don't overlook it by something has to rise in you that's greater you're not worried about the embarrassment anymore what's God going to do to me what what's he going to change

Believers and see that God is doing his work God is doing something there and we celebrate it we rejoice in it we keep praying for it Lord to finish your work no matter how you get the job done but that you finish it Lord we yield ourselves as Joseph did that day say Lord I Lord I I understand now your angel has spoken to me and I understand what this is this is the word being fulfilled in me
