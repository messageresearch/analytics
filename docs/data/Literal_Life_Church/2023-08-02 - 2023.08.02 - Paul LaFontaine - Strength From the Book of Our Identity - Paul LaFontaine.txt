========================================

brother Jesse and your wife and family good to see you glad to have heard you were coming and uh if I'd known you were in Baltimore I was at the Baltimore Airport Monday I could have brought you over myself uh you would have had to jump in the plane but I could have brought you myself amen make sure you agree brother Jesse and his wife uh and family there I don't know how long they're here but uh he's a good brother in visiting from Mexico it's good to have them amen Revelations chapter 5 and verse one and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne how many were sitting on the throne one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like uh uh like Jasper and a starting Stone Sergeant Stone and there was a rainbow you see do I have the right scripture here no I'm in I'm in four okay why didn't somebody yell at me and I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals this is good because in number chapter four you have the throne set in heaven one sitting on the throne and now the theme of chapter five is my theme tonight now we have a vision of a book all right we have a vision of a book and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the heaven was able to open the book neither the look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders say unto me weak not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb as he had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of olders which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy so I want you to notice now the opening of this book now they're singing a new song things have changed this is a transition in John's Vision this is a transition it was about him sitting on the throne and then we know that Jesus walked in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks for seven Church Ages which brother Rapp is dealing with that on Wednesday night a couple Wednesday nights he'll pick that up again but he was we know one like the son of man Christ was in the midst of the seven in church ages but but but the the vision changes now and the emphasis becomes a book that that lamb has to go get and so that's the emphasis but notice the results of just him taking this book Christ that is they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals or for thou was slain and that's redeemed us to God now this is all the people responding to this taking of the book They're responding saying praise the Lord You've redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation you all came from a lot of stuff you come from a lot of backgrounds and it's the grace of God and his Redemptive power that you're here tonight can you say Amen so they're starting to shout and rejoice because you've redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue people nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth I want you to notice as I speak on tonight the strength and the Book of our identity their identity changed because they came from all this stuff but now they've seen their I did this book must be a book of identity because when they seen their new identity we're not we're no longer the background that we come from we are Kings and Priests this is the book of identity and when they begin to see that they seem they have their new identity in Jesus Christ or their original identity and not only have you made us Kings and Priests that's our new identity but we have power to rule and Reign on the Earth so power and strength come from looking in this book father bless your word tonight and we thank you for the trip that we got off and we're thankful to be home we we're thankful for the fruits that you've brought from the ministry and even here Lord Brother Stevens true and all that you're doing by your Holy Spirit here locally we thank you Lord for it and we want to be a part of it we want to just settle in and listen to your voice tonight as Christians and we just commit the evening to you in Jesus name amen God bless you as you take your seats tonight now this is a vision of John and it's it's a vision that's very important to all of us in this time it it has some elements to it worth teaching and taking a little time on tonight and actually this is linked together with what I was speaking before I left into the young people at the camp and that was talking about young girls and young guys being strong young girls in this age being strong to the wrong type of guy young guys being strong to the wrong type of girl but all of us are praying for more strength in the word of God that we could be strong in our convictions that we can be strong in our hearts that we can be strong against the wave of sin in this generation we don't need to be weak we need to say Lord make me stronger be strong in the Lord in the power of his mind so not just young people all of us say Lord make me strong by Revelation and so this will be related to that in that I got in was that the camp I just got into identity a little bit and something really opened up to me it might be simple tonight but we can't uh we can't Overlook the subject of true identity without looking at this book of redemption that is being open to us here in Revelations 5 because it's everything it's everything I don't care who told you your identity I don't care what your mom and dad said I don't care what the world has told you I don't care what you come from all of that was washed away now this book has your true identity this book of redemption tells you who you really are and I asked the kids I said if I were to ask you who are you you'd probably give your name well I'm Sam I'm Gideon I'm William that's what people answer but you see now who you are is deeper than just your name you would have to keep talking and tell me your personality I have to watch you for years but in Christ your identity is actually deeper than your personality deep in the deeper than the way God Made You deeper than your your looks can you say Amen but even your looks were predestinated by God can you say Amen even though mannerisms God made you the way you are but so I want you to notice now when we talk about this book your identity you have to stay in the word to keep God keep letting God unpeal the layers of to get to the depth of your identity it's not just your personality it's not just your name it's not just who you think you are it's not just oh I know myself after 30 40 years I know myself I'm this one no you have to keep looking in the word because this goes beyond your personality this is who you are in the might of God before the foundation of the world when you start to look at it really look at it power and strength come in your life you got to stay in this word and this this sermon will end tonight hopefully with the value of the message because if you think the message is just a gathering of a bunch of message churches and it's a kind of like another movement just like the Seven Day Adventist or whatever if you think that about the message you don't know what this message is because resident within the books of this message is this revealing of This Book of redemption this is the most important thing of your life can you say Amen and so maybe that's what make you feed on better but so now the the vision of John maybe would just look at it tonight and maybe for some of you this is revisiting the subject of this book it was one sitting on the throne he and and so then he's sitting on the throne in chapter four I'm glad I read that and then chapter five introduces a book that's in the hands of this one sitting on the throne and so after Christ is seen for 2000 years in the midst of the candlesticks with not really any specifics it's just the condition of the churches brother rap is dealing with this Sardis and laodicea and Philadelphia he's dealing but but the son of man is there in the midst of the candlesticks and he's working in the people but there's no specific action uh in vision of where our lamb is until Revelations 5 when the book comes into view and when the book comes into view by the vision there's a book here and when the book is here then the lamb steps forth into the into this Vision so there's something related to this book and you and our lamb because he's in the midst of the candlesticks but now when the book is is present and when there's seven seals on it our lamb as the way brother around says it our lamb steps forth into this vision very significant thing but it's about the book The Lamb shows himself again he shows up at the end he steps forth into this new vision of John and in in this vision and Christ being there is related to this book and he actually then he takes the book because he's the only one I want every 13 14 year old 10 year old to be listening tonight because I'm going to make this as basic as possible there's a book here and Christ takes this book that sealed with Seven Seals and it's because he's the only one worthy to take this book and tear off what's holding it up so we can see what's inside Jesus is the only one who's worthy to look at that book and open it up for us and in this Vision he does and that's why everybody gets excited you know it must be exciting you know when you when you have if you if you were the beginning of your life and there was already a biography about your life and there was a book about it and the title was Paulo fontaine's life I'd say you'd be curious if you were given a book and it's already got your life in it you'd be curious to read that can you say man wow it's already there that makes it easy and you'd be very curious I'm going to tell you tonight we should be very curious about what's in the Lamb's Book of Life we should feed on the word can you say Amen we should be feeding on this message and our Bibles because because it's not just we're learning uh how to to to live right that's it's beyond that there's an identity in Christ in the word that you have to know to receive strength that's what this message is so this book is closed it's sealed up with seven Mysteries around it and if it would be like the old Scrolls that's what the way their book was then you'd have seven straps around it sealed up and so if you in the vision now Christ would have to take it and tear off seven straps open up the scroll on the table and we finally get to look and see what's inside our book is more like looks like this tonight and so that would be seven straps across it and you couldn't see what's in the inside it's sealed with seven Mysteries it's sealed up so we couldn't we couldn't tear off anything to look inside ourselves we are unworthy to do that why were we unworthy because at the beginning we fell with Adam so this book got lost Adam had it it got lost and went back to it didn't get lost and went back to the hands original owner Adam lost it and then God put Seven Seals on it and until the end time he says then the only one worthy to do it is the Lamb to tear the seals off and finally the people of God will get to look in the inside and see what it is it's at the end time we get to look at the words in the book and it's a book of identity can you say Amen so now so now you can't see the contents because it's sealed with seven Mysteries around it and so now in in Revelations chapter 5 all the attention turns to this book of redemption we wouldn't expect that I thought it was going to turn to Christ well it does turn to Christ but it's an action this book comes into play this book of The Mystery of God of your identity it comes into play because this book was with Adam he lost it went back in the hands original owner it's got to come back to the people again and so now this book is important it's not just about I believe Christ I believe he went to Calvary that's what most of the Christianity believes I believe in the Lord and I don't knock that praise the Lord but now as you look to the end time there's another action and the book comes into play that Adam lost the book is at the Forefront of this vision and our lamb is in the vision he has to step forth into this vision and all the elders around them and they're they're all weeping and John's weeping because none of the elders Peter Paul all the Patriarchs of the Bible as good as they lived and as great a prophets as they were none of them have the worthiness to take this book and break it to us and then he says John stop weeping because the lion of the tribe of Judah has showed up in this vision the worthy one has showed up that's why they switched from weeping to rejoicing because somebody's Worthy this is the way it's worded if this is the way it's worded by the prophet if no one come and take took this book all of creation would be lost why is that because he's the one that redeemed everything and he's going to finish Redemption he may have saved your soul but when he died of Calvary he's redeeming this entire Earth from sin and so all of creation would be lost and we would stop someday and it's it would be all be over and done and all the creation would be lost so the book held the key to sons of God getting it back into their hands so he could finish Redemption he can't finish Redemption until the bride has this book and can see her true identity this whole world all of creation is completely lost until this lamb takes this book breaks the seals often and his bride begins to look into it and come back to Sons and Daughters of God of God again all creation will be lost unless that happens pretty important book pretty important message well I thought it was just the preacher with the seventh grade education and everybody makes a big rah-rah over it you don't even know what the message is I thought this was a dress code and I'm getting tired of the dress you thought the message was the dress code hello you thought the message was don't chew gum in church I'm telling you the early years in the message and one preacher said it my earliest years the message what the message meant to me is stuff like don't chew gum in church that was the message to him and he said Lord I'm glad I stayed with it because my goodness it's so much more than don't you come in church there's so much more to this it's not some man with a seventh grade sixth grade education no he would use he would use this as a as the surface but what he's wanting to do is get this book of redemption of identity back into the hands of the people I might shot a little bit tonight on Wednesday night this is pretty exciting so now all the attention turns to this book all the elders must have knew what it was in it because everyone got real happy when the lamb had it in his hand everybody started to get happy the prayers are going up everything's there everybody got extremely happy they were weeping before and now they're happy because they know there's some contents in that book they can't get to but they need to get to it and our lamb is worthy to open it they knew when he had it in his hand they knew he was going to tear the seals off they know he was going to open it up and he was the only one worthy no wonder they're getting happy somebody's going to open this identity to me somebody's going to reveal this to me and it's my Lord it's my land the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's going to open this book glory be to God we get to see what's in the inside everybody got happy why it was why why did they get so happy because this book was related to them it was the subject of them there was a connection to Christ with this book if they had come to the Altar for two thousand years in the church ages and the preacher preached Christ and they came to the altars I received Christ as my personal Savior and I I received the Redemptive work he did at Calvary that Soul was saved right there if they sincerely believed it can you say Amen so so but so and that's wonderful I'm not knocking that that's that's what happened for 2000 years but but you see now they didn't really know there was a connection to Christ themselves by a spirit Union that none of them didn't know that they just I accept what Christ did for me my sins have been washed away but when they the elders knew when this book is present and it gets unsealed that's my connection that I am a part of Christ this is the way brother Brandon said it Christ is the book of redemption and the bride is the words in the book that's what he said about this book of redemption Christ is the book he says well I thought Christ was the lamb there and the original owners on the throne and you had Christ and then if you're a trinitarian you're trying to figure it all out to split not into three no no this is a vision it's it's a parable it's a vision it's a it's not a parable but it's it's playing out something and so you don't divide and make God a trinity by a vision because that vision would never meant uh match up the rest of the Bible that he's won the original over became Christ the lamb can you say Amen so if you've got a book and brother says the book of Christ yeah it's the revealing All Through the Bible of Jesus Christ but we have to if we have a lamb step forth he is a bloody lamb he's been to Calvary and also he's he's been hit with it throughout the church ages remember the Bible said that after he rose again to set at the right hand of the authority of God and then he's the intercessor uh for 2000 years he's an intercessor for the sins of the people for 2000 years so he's a bloody lamb not only from Calvary but now all the sins of the people would be absorbed by him through the ages that's why when he steps in this Vision he's a bloody lamb a lamb that has been slain so but don't try to say well he said he's the words in the book well who is Christ then it's Christ happened in the vision he'd be the one that have to take this book but the revelation of who he is throughout the ages is is this book this book and guess what Christ is the book and the bride is the words in the book if you had a book that was all wrapped up and uh maybe it was wrapped up in a present or something and you heard that the title of the book was the complete revelation of who you really are for dummies no I better leave that part out the complete revelation of Who You Are For Dummies might as well go ahead and say that because we were dumb we're dummies we're numb to who we really are so I'll go ahead and call it if you had a book titled but you couldn't get in it you couldn't see the Revelation you couldn't see who you really are but the book said is that this what did I say it was now I have to go the title because the complete if you've seen that on a shelf the complete revelation of who you really are for dummies I would say we would be curious to have that book broke open I would say that you would say how am I going to look in that book if it has the complete you know we'll jump for books a lot quicker that for the titles in the library it's just like you know how do I lose a hundred pounds in three days or something like that you look at that title and say I want to read what that says and you can't really do that I've I've tried it no I haven't tried it but you can't do that but you know we jump for books we're curious and we're curious just by the title is anybody with me here tonight yeah I want to buy that I'm going to buy that sometimes we spend a lot of money I like to buy books I I buy them my wife likes to buy a lot of books when she was homeschooling she bought when she went to homeschooling convictions convinced she bought every book in the entire convention I have a huge library of homeschool books if anybody wants them I will sell them to you in a private sale without my wife there I will sell them I have hundreds of books from for homeschooling we have every answer in the world for homeschooling every book we know how to deal with strong-willed children and everything we got it it's in book form you see titles and you buy it but what if you've seen a title that really intrigued you but you couldn't get to it because it's all wrapped up and it takes a special person to open it up to you we jump on books all the time this that and the other low carbon you know what's the next answer what's the next book you know by the titles we're just buying it up we're not buying books today we're catch it on Pinterest we stretch the new program the 95 days or the 75 days now I'm preaching at my daughter she knows I'm just as bad what's the next thing what's the next craze coming out and you know anyway we're doing low carb right now so Back to Basics you know I'm married right now it's a low carb Barb that's what her name is low carb Barb she's gonna make sure that I do it or sister Splenda Brenda that's her name I appreciate our love her very much she's gonna get me she got me get me taken care of because she loves me oh if you if you bought if you looked at a title for a book you're all over you want to jump on it this book has the greatest title has the greatest thing it's the it's the best book in the world for your life and so we should show a craving in our hearts for this book I want to hear it it reminds me of when I receive the holy ghost at 16 years old the one thing I knew was an Evidence of the holy ghost in my life is I had a such a huge vacuum and craving for the word of God I couldn't get enough of it not just conventions not just services but that message and I said if God if God is it true that God would send a messenger to my language and my age with a spirit of Elijah if that's true and God did all that work to send him and he sacrificed and he did it and then he died and went on to his reward if if God did that then I ought to take a little bit of my life and find out what it says I had to lay everything else aside and after work I can tell you I've had a bunch of cassette tapes and after my job that I had at that siding company I come home for about four or five years and usually every day after work I listened to this message which I needed that foundation in my life to do everything I do today but I fed on it because that's why I said if God sent this and more the more I read it I knew God had to send this not a man and I read it and I read it guess what I didn't just see the identity in the position of William Branham I didn't just see God could work through a man I've seen God could work through me as a Son of God I said I could come into my position I said I see my identity in that book this is more than just some books and dates this is more than an app on your phone that's why I hated being an app because everybody has the same you got tons of apps on your phones and just another app don't you ever let it become another app you punch that app on your phone more than all the rest of them and if you have to delete other apps make that app the priority turn that voice on listen to the message of the hour because you're not going to get just some denominational thing you're going to get your identity revealed to you somebody say praise the Lord this is a book that's revealed at the end time with your true identity and I love it praise the Lord so the complete Revelation who you really are for dummies we could get excited about that but there's no Next Step until he opens it so we can get curious all we want to but God has to open it Christ had to open it and until it gets unsealed and handed to us there's no further steps in our Christian walk until it gets unsealed and he hand it to us but see then there's a worship there's an excitement because it's in the hands of the one worthy to break it open they're excited because they know he will open it he has opened it and when he opens it we get to look inside the the biggest thing that we catch here is it must be a book of identity because they say they are redeemed out of what they were from every Kindred tongue Nation people look at that look at that and they changed their identity from what they came from what they were raised in this book made them begin to believe I'm not what I came from I'm not what I came from that's why we don't have things of cultures and things we don't you know it's just like we have our culture but it's like we don't make that the gospel can you say man because it gets washed away for the most part we don't say well this culture better than another culture and always we don't get into racism or anything it's none of it is of god can you say man because why we have another identity that we just don't identify from with the country we come from Nigeria or Mexico no no we've got a whole new identity that puts us all in the same ground can you say amen and they looked in there and says oh blessed be the name of the Lord we've come from all of this from our past but now we realize we're not that we're Sons and Daughters of God we're Kings and Priests unto God this is a book of identity because before this was opened they did not see themselves as Kings and Priests they see themselves as Christians they had accepted Christ but you don't hear too many writers saying and proclaiming strongly that he has made us Kings and Priests until this moment so and then it's a revealing of their true identity and then with it King Power how many believe that when someone has their true identity revealed the true identity power comes with it and I don't mean just power to to zap the devil it's power over the enemy but it's power to live Who You Are and so the power they've seen in the word was that he's made us Kings and Priests there's a whole study on what you become as a king in Priest that's a great position he's called you to but now we're not only Kings and Priests but he's made us to rule and Reign on this Earth I always like to interpret that as being that Adam when he ruled in reigned on the earth nothing controlled Adam he controlled things the weather did not control Adam he controlled the weather he named the animals there was nothing on Earth that controlled him so now modern day times when a Son of God comes into his place he prays with his God and there's nothing on this Earth that would control us we pray and God in us controls it sexual passions if they're under the control of the Holy Ghost in your life they don't control us we control it finances don't control us we control our finances with the Lord's help that sons of God coming into their place so ruling and reigning is what they've seen now I see it now I see I mean redeemed back to ruling and reigning on this Earth I'm not some grasshopper that Joshua and Caleb said were more than able to take the land and all the ten others five says we're like grasshoppers in their sight and in our sight as well we're grasshoppers we don't have a chance we'll always be grasshoppers he said we're not grasshoppers Joshua games we're not grasshoppers they've seen their identity we're Sons and Daughters of God the promise of this hour see they've seen their name in the word even back then they caught a revelation we're not grasshoppers God said we can take this land call the revelation of their name in the book and the book wasn't even totally open yet but they called little Revelation said I am not a grasshopper here friends I have the power to take this land because God's Prophet set is mine Hallelujah so there's strength in seeing your true identity young people hope you're listening older ones I hope you're listening your strength in the Lord is not because you shouted and danced if you're a Christian long enough you'll probably shout and dance and that's good I have I did it this weekend at camp we we were shouting man but your strength in the Lord is not in shouting and dancing it's in knowing your true identity in the word of God but the devil doesn't like is you finding your drug and you walk stable with with with confidence in God I know where I stand here and if I got something that's impossible I serve in a god of the impossibilities I'm going to go to Paramount Grabber my hand the hands of my family I'm going to pray for them right now we're going to get through this and God will step on the scene it's boldness can you say man it's strength it's not weakness I'm not afraid of any devil when you know who you are you're not afraid of any devil there's strength and true identity why didn't we have this book of redemption to start with I'm glad you asked him I'm glad you asked because our father in reality did have this book of redemption he held it it was in Adam's hands guess what knowing who he was as the Son of God gave him Power To Rule and Reign on this Earth Adam never never had Adam never had a former identity like you and I have did you realize that Adam only knew himself by the book by the book and his identity as the Son of God he knew I was created right from the Breath of God he didn't have a former identity he didn't have a mom or a dad that put him down and told him you'll be nothing in life he never had that he only knew his true identity praise be to God he had the title need he had the book in his hands he knew who he was right from the start and that's why he had power over the elements that's why he had power over life because it was in his hands knowing who he was as the Son of God gave him Power To Rule and Reign Adam never had a former identity he started with the right identity I wish all of us could have done that but we didn't start with the right identity and that's why a lot of us even went and sinned you realize that's why you went and lived in sin because you didn't know who you were you can never go back to a life of sin when you know truly who you are in Christ you'll never do it it's the power over sin I could never do that to my Lord can you say Amen identity is the power to everything the reason you went into sin the reason your life was messed up he had children out of wedlock whatever happened divorce all these other things that come from all the fruits of the world why did I do that Lord I wish I had a perfect testimony like so and so in the church and you know come and ask me there isn't anybody in the church with the perfect testimony we were all born in sin the cleanest kid in this church that's never done anything wrong which we don't have anybody if you thought they were perfect they were born in sin like you were have all the potential for sin in them born with a serpent nature can you say Amen they were born in sin and so all of us that's why I say he said well I come from a real dysfunctional family they were dysfunctional and they were bad no guess what we all come from a dysfunctional family and parents Adam and Eve so we all come from a dysfunctional praise the Lord I'm having a good time tonight you all come from dysfunction you're all messed up preacher's not supposed to say that he's supposed to be positive without Christ you're a mess you are all messed up well I've lived a pretty good life and I gave to Charities and uh you know I I stayed true to my dad and mom I wore what they said to wear you're born in sin shaped in iniquity you're messed up that's the identity of the world and and Adam you see he the the book the book fell away from Adam because of sin and the program says it went back into the hands of the original owner God because the title needed this earth and the Book of the book went back to the hands original owner because Satan's hands were too grubby for it he would have loved to have that but just his hands he he didn't so it went back in the hands Adam for the first time coming went from strength to weakness he was weak why was he weak because he was living in a false identity as a fallen Son of God not a son with power but a human governed by weakness of a serpent nature just another human being he forgot who he was brother Brown says Adam forgot who he was he got amnesia through sin and he forgot who he was now in our day the book appears again and Christ opens it the Saints start proclaiming not only has he redeemed us but we see that what he has redeemed us for its power and strength not weakness he's reading this the power power to rule power to reign with Christ in humility can I say it again since the book has been opened to us and it has he's called us to rule and reign in power with Christ with humility not the arrogance power power of this world but with the humility of Christ unreal Unleashed power against the devil and his kingdom by a simple humble believer who's looking and seeing his name in the book glory be to God Hallelujah now I thought it was interesting this week I caught this with the young people I was talking to him about it uh Eric Erickson was the first one who mentioned the term identity crisis and he mentioned it in 1968 so it's the first time he's a he was a psychoanalyst and a psychologist Eric Erickson and he developed the concept of the identity crisis in 1968 and he and he came up with a term to characterize the experimentation and identity development phase that people experienced during their teen years he was specific because he split up all the stages of Life of development into uh five different uh seven different stages I believe it was and the fifth stage this teenage and so he coined this term identity crisis and so I I want to look at this just a second because we realized that it's in 1968 finally this has been happening naturally with teenagers for years and all of us go through stages of life that we forget who we are we don't know who we are we go through an identity crisis our parents have told us so long but he seemed to realize that the teenage was the was the hardest time because then they go out to school and so now they think they know who they are but then they have an identity crisis they don't know who they are so they try to start being like everybody else they start like dressed like everybody else and they start to dress like the movie stars and they try to change their hair and their hair becomes blue instead of the way God made it brown that they make it blue and they put no piercing in their nose and they do everything because they're they're going through something they don't know who they are yet and some of them if I'm looking at a 60 year old on a Harley and he's got his ears pierced and he's you know he's he looks like he's gonna fall over with a heart attack but he's there with his leather jacket on and he's going at it with this image that he's trying to be the guys still have an identity crisis even at 60 years old he hasn't found who he really is so it's not just teenagers but he said it's specific so I want you to notice now he uh Eric Erickson coined that and pronounced something so now we've always had a natural transition of the stages of life and probably back in Jesus day and later times you probably would have had that natural stage of teenagers going through that time of of uh uh they come to that change of life and 12 13 years old they become a little bit more sensitive how they look when they're eight year when they're seven-year-old boys they could care less how they look they don't need a bath they come out from the dirt from the day and the rain go to church without a bath or anything they could care less something they look like then all of a sudden at 13 they care about what they look like and they're spending an hour in the mirror getting in there had a shower the shower took about two hours and they're getting their hair just right they're putting some grease in it and they're looking at all this you know and getting it just right and so now it's like you're you're staying who took my son because at 70 I couldn't get him to take a bath and now he's taking three baths a day and he's you know getting his hair just right something changes naturally in them they become noticed that what I look like and then then they get influenced by their kids I want to look like that I want to look like this so This natural thing probably was already there throughout history as they go through the change of life and become a man they become sensitive to how they look uh and and so another thing I brought up to the young people is that they they didn't notice Girls when they were seven years old girls don't count girls are girls are not needed if you ask a seven-year-old do you think girls are needed no women and girls are not needed at all if we had a whole earth with with boys and guys we'd be fine without them we don't need any girls at all I hate girls so seven year old said I hate girls maybe even their sister but I don't know about 12 or 13 years old you ask them do you still hate girls like you did at seven well I'm not so sure that I hate them they're kind of they're kind of nice are they needed on the earth oh yeah they're needed and everything changes now what's changing their body their perception of things they're growing can you say man so you take this natural thing and it's it's such a crisis he calls it a crisis he names what's been developing naturally and I think it's something so much of the enemy to give a name to something sometimes that's already been there naturally and then the devil gives it a name right and so now now the people will take a name that's given to us by the doctors or by the world because they gave it a name we start to buy into it where parents started oh just let them be themselves we don't teach them the word of God anymore just let them go through that and they can be whatever they want they can do this they can do that and we open the doors because somebody called it an identity crisis it starts out natural but then it can turn into spirits that's the devil he always takes something natural and perverts it that's your enemy in Romans 1 here in a minute he takes something natural and he turns it to unnatural and then it turns into the wrong spirit so Eric Erickson says this 1968 and it's during their teen years the period of identity crisis happens during the fifth stage of Eric Erickson's stages of development watch Satan take this identity identity crisis now watch this as he takes the identity crisis label in 1968 to new deeper levels than ever let's go to Romans 1. I didn't realize I had so much tonight but we're going to get you some of it here Verse 18 for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth of unrighteousness Truth and unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifesting them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and God had so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened profess themselves to be wise became fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like a de corruptable man and to birds and to Forfeit obese and creeping things this is idolatry and this is man taking the purity of the glory of God and attaching it to an animal attaching it to the creation instead of the creator wherefore what happens now when you do that when you mock the Creator when you mock the designer when you start rebelling against the original designer of how he even made you watch what comes from it wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness to the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed Forever This is a mockery of a Creator I am denying the Creator I am denying that he made me I you know a creature made me I evolved from a creature and all this comes from somebody rebelling against the original designer of you for this cause God gave them up under vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise all the men also the men leaving the natural use of a woman natural use of a woman natural family relations were the one burned in their lusts one for another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving themselves the recompense of their air which was me and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to reprobate mine to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all the righteousness so let's stop right there you see the cycle of man turning against the original identity and design even of naturally who we are they go against God and thus they go against nature and in their love say I don't want to hear what God made me and my natural desire for a woman I'm changing that now and I don't want a woman anymore men will be with men and homosexuality all starts with a denial and a mockery of God it's against what he made you the original designer men turned to Men Women turn to women a defiant spirit that says it don't start out as a homosexual it starts out as taking the spirit is I defy what God has designed me as can I get an amen tonight I defy God I defy he's the designer I go against it I defy right now today I defy the word and what the prophet said I'm going against that that's the prophet's opinion be careful of that be careful where I'll lead you I defy what God made me the natural chapter of a man to woman I defy that I don't have to go with a woman I can go with a man and then as you see that happen in our society the last 60 70 years and it becomes a normal laws come in for homosexuals notice now notice it goes deeper than that because Satan never keeps it at that level the Defiance of God as an original designer the Defiance keeps going and Satan takes it deeper into the 2000s which says guess what I I was I'm a biological woman but I'm not a woman anymore I'm going to tell everybody I'm a man I defy science I defy biology and thus you defy the way God made you as a desire and I design my own self however I choose trans we probably won't let this message out public but in Romans 1 you'll find the answer to the trouble of all this it started somewhere it's I defy God is the original designer and creator that's where it starts with but look where it leads now you're not even thinking properly I can choose whatever I want to be I can choose my own dreams and my own destiny and you know what I believe in believing in your dreams but you better go to prayer find out what God wants for your life this isn't some carnal natural zigzag Zig Ziglar seminar that says you can be anything you want in life not without God you can't yeah you can go do it by your own power but we have to go to God first is what what did you put me on Earth to do why did you give me these gifts is it your will for me to do this but the Defiance of God says I don't need God in any of that I can become anything and if I decide this is what I am then this is what I am it's getting quieter so maybe I should pick this up next Wednesday night again but I just I'd like to finish is this brother Steve's water here is this mine okay not that I don't trust him notice the nature of Satan's working and I won't be long I'm just I'm laying in something here about the nature of Satan taking it to level lower level lower level lower level and now we've got now we've got somebody said I choose that I'm not a woman and everything else says they're a man I'm not a man I'm a woman and he thinks that love he takes it and so notice the nature of Satan's work of mixing identity it takes a Defiance towards the design designer it takes the mixing up of the nature of men to men mixing of genders Satan keeps plunging deeper and deeper our gender problem that we have today of messing up genders to a young child can't even think straight about it anymore it comes from Satan and his desire to mix up the identity of Who You Are and it goes much deeper than any of you without the Holy Ghost can handle it goes much deeper Satan is taken deeper every week he takes it deeper in this world you live in to people take the spirit I must have these problems in life because maybe somebody told me I'm a man but I'm really a woman and they take that demon power they open themselves up to that demon power and that thought life and they begin to believe there's something else than what the and so now he keeps them plunging deeper and deeper into sin into confusion about who they are weakness weak Minds weak convictions weak bodies how many know the food we're eating is making us weak bodies come on manipulated bodies taking children and giving permission permission to manipulate and change try to change the biology of who they were manipulating that's how low Satan is taking it God forbid that this is happening and it's already happening and then all of a sudden a kid wakes up and in his nature this is you can read the testimonies online they get that that change in their body to change from a guide to a girl and five years later they they keep feeling these expressions of who they really are when they grow up because somebody did it to them when they were young and now they realize wait a minute I made the biggest mistake of my life and they want to sue the doctors for doing it but it's because their nature starts to come and realize God may be this way and I tried to change it their life's a mess absolute mess no family no children of their own everything natural life that they could have had is finished because Satan deceived them in their identity you Believers listen to me tonight watch out for Satan trying to deceive you about who you really are in Christ you're not the world you're not meant to be like the World Girls you're not meant to dress like that he's called you to something higher guys are not meant to be that out there he's called you to something higher men of God strong in the Lord taking care of your wives and families young women that dress calmly at Godly and are strong in the Lord that's what he's called you to do get your mind off of Satan speaking to you that somehow that's a better life it might be better for them but it's not really it's it's not going to be better for you because why you have the book and God's trying to tell you who you really are and it's not to be part of the Amish is to be a dignified daughter of almighty God a king's daughter that's what he said of you in the Book of Life you forgive me for being straight tonight but listen I'm against the power of the enemy that tries to come even our own ranks and mix up the identity and try to mess with these kids minds and adults Minds maybe I'm this maybe I'm not that maybe this message isn't for me it's all mess up of identity say Lord let me stay in the storm till I find out who I am and I stand upon an unmovable in the word of God let the world pass away I know where I stand and if ten thousand ten thousand Fall by my right twenty thousand my left even even the pastor leaves this message it shall not come nigh unto me because I know who I am in the word of God somebody say praise the Lord tonight we must know who we are in this hour told to go against Satan's identity crisis Hallelujah blessed be his name in Defiance to the original designer Satan's work is slow to complete this perversion of identity that he has in this hour and then you have a thing called intelligent design which some of you homeschoolers teach your kids intelligent design the set of beliefs based on the notion that life on the Earth is so complex that it cannot be explained by the scientific theory of evolution and therefore must have been designed by a supernatural entity that's the conclusion oh yeah it's intelligent design and guess what it's more intelligent than the minds we have on the face of the Earth it's a good thing we can learn learn in the word of God God's intelligence from the beginning because I wouldn't want to trust the intelligence of a psychologist come on now thank God we got intelligent design and that's our creator our designer who said what we were from the foundation of the world I love it that he puts the word Supernatural in there in the meeting it says is that it can't these things can't be explained by scientific theory of evolution and therefore we must have been designed by a supernatural entity God supernaturally chose you before the foundation of the world oh it's intelligent design because who I'm living with in this world have has no intelligence whatsoever and this gender reveal this gender reveal that we've had for some reason I wonder when they're going to phase that out because it's wrong to do a gender reveal to put that on that boy to show it's going to be a boy it's going to be a boy and so they do all these different games for gender reveals yeah it's just an exciting time so we're going to show the rest of the siblings and my whole family and we got this pinata and we're gonna bust the pinata in a bunch of blue things come out and you're oh it's a boy it's a boy wonder when they're gonna stop that it's wrong to tell that boy he's a boy so if you go 30 years and they they did that when you were born but you forgot who you are I think you need another gender reveal with another pinata from Mexico I guess we have to do it again have the family over because you forgot who you were having pinata bust it open have the blue come out and you have to discover again I'm a boy God made me a boy gender reveal sometimes we need that amongst the young people can you say man so they don't dress like a boy and the girls don't dress like a boy and the guys don't dress like a girl maybe you need a revelation but I'm Ending by saying this I never dreamed I'd go this long tonight but I'm having so much joy in my heart right now it's hard to contain myself let me in on this did you notice the time when the proclamation of the of the uh term identity crisis came in 1968 and did you realize just a few years before in 1963. is when the seals were taken off of the book of redemption Hallelujah and it's not it's not an identity crisis it's an identity reveal for the bride the seals were taken off the book and now from that time until tonight because I'm preaching it to you still we're not out here in a Rapture yet and I'm still going to keep preaching this book in this Russians because the bride's going to catch it eventually can you say Amen but isn't an amazing God just before the term comes out identity crisis and then it goes into girls not even knowing who they are it goes into changing biologic it goes into an absolute perversion just before the term comes out God comes out with the seals broke and says I'm going to give this book I'm going to hand it to my Prophet on Earth it's open Revelation is 10. you ought to say praise the lord it's open it was closed in Revelations 5 the lamb took it Revelation 10 it was opened up the same book was opened up I'm going to throw it to my Prophet on Earth he's going to speak those things and if they feed on that which how many knows Revelations 10 uh uh 10 8 through 11 it says feed on it what do you feed them the open book what is this message the open book they feed on it just before 1963 he takes the seals off and as soon as identity crisis proclaims a title God releases the greatest reveal of ever and brother Graham says he revealed the names of the book he said John must have seen his name there he because he began to shout so much because he must have seen his name and he says this not Orman Neville not our name like Paula Fontaine or Ormond Neville or William Brennan that's not what's in the book it's your position and place in the word for your day that's your name and when you see that and you step into it this is me this is all me I'm not going to try to be anybody else now this is me power comes in your life it's not just a gender reveal but it's the sons of God revealing can you say man it's a revealing of Sons and Daughters of God and who their true identity in this book really is you need to start getting excited can you say Amen you start singing since I saw my name in the book of redemption since I saw my name in the book well Jesse I have communion now with Christ My Redeemer since I saw my name in the book Let's stand and singing since I saw my name in the book of redemption since I saw my name in the book I have commute yeah now with Christ My Redeemer since I saw my name in the book singing now oh since I saw my name in the hood of redemption since I saw my name in the world I have gone never with us saw my name is sing it again oh since I saw my name in the book of reventions since I saw my name in the Lord with Christ my name is [Applause] [Music] since I saw my name in the book of redemption Sunshine [Music] with Christ why we needed since I saw my name is [Music] amen tonight let me finish this so the message is the revealing of this book that is what the message is the message is not don't you come in church the message is not a collection of sermons by William Branham from the 50s and 60s the message is not a new dress code that's weird the mess is not a movement that is out to take all the movies entertainments out of our life if it does that sanctifies your life but the message is so much more than that the message is not a conglomeration of churches around the world that's not the message the message is not a near another weird break off of Pentecost with Holiness beliefs with it no no no that's not what the message is that's not what God sent us in this age we needed a whole lot more than another Holiness level we needed a whole lot more than just another movement can you say imagine we needed more than just another dress code we needed to see our names in The Book of Life to get our true identity and if you don't get anything else tonight that is what this message is don't let anybody tell you it's anything different you feed on it and something else comes besides William Branham it's your identity in Jesus Christ [Music] the gender reveal [Music] he's my husband and I'm the bride I'm not trying to tell him what to do anything I know who I am I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and Christ is my husband I know who I am can you say Amen maybe you get curious now young people and all and look at this message different and you get curious and when you do you begin to feed on it and read the book and make it your whole life you will rise to strength in knowing who you are I appreciate you staying a little longer tonight I think it was worth it don't you and that's when you start to sing you take a little time before you go home you say oh [Music] oh I know who I am [Music] oh [Music] I know who I am singing [Music] that person We Are The Chosen Generations [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I live my life [Music] living life [Music] [Music] oh Lord I know I know this was [Music] to show his excellence [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he says [Music] I'm back [Applause] [Music] [Music] I know who
