oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou H has set up then then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach Meshach and abedo therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it won't to be Heat heed 2 Timothy chapter 3 in the New Testament we add some scriptures here to the the text and the context 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 12 yay in all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse doesn't say that it it it will get better and better as you have many years as a Christian um if you're living Godly in Christ Jesus then the spirits and the the forces against you will get worse and worse evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived and I want to speak a little bit tonight in in the service on why is s Satan getting more angry it's one thing if we know about Christ Jesus of 2000 years ago in our stories from Sunday school and we see the four gospels and we see he lived 33 years and we see his fleshly days here on Earth but it's another thing that God drops a revelation of who Christ really is and actually the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not just the church receives it not just just uh a group that receives it but it's personally to you the new birth is a revelation of Christ personally to you and when that Revelation comes listen I can tell you it's not just that you understand Jesus in the four gospels Christ becomes real and personal to you and so that that TI that title is is an announcement it's it's what is happening now secretly and we're just not talking about his life here on Earth but who he is is revealed in the day in its fullness in this day day it in its fullness Christ will be revealed in his fullness and who is he revealing it to he's revealing it to his body his people because we are the body of Christ if the body of Christ is without the head then she's not really the body of Christ how many believe tonight and I'm just laying in some foundational statements that I know you will at least nod to an amen would be nice but if you nod to it how many you believe Christ is the head of the church he's the head he's the if we want to call it he's the brains he's the he's the one that directs just like your body your head if you cut your head off your finished the body has no function without the head and so Christ is the head of the body the body has nothing can't be nourished can't be filled can't can't move can you say Amen without the head and so now in the end time we see Paul and Colossians saying the head that he is the head and by him and through him consist all things and she is the body but the the head must be connected in a union with the body and through denominational ages of 2,000 years denominational ideas has so destroyed the word of God and taken away from the word of God that you take away from the husband Christ and the body has become detached from the head but in the end time the head returns and reveals himself and when the head comes back and the body catches it she becomes one with him for a rapture so that's the prophecy for the end time and so it's him who's revealing himself to his body his people that's what's happening right now spiritually that's what's happening we can talk about what's happening in the news we can take prophecy and and bring all these things but what spiritually happened is the bride has recognizing her headship Christ has returned you say well he's returned uh not in a physical body yet but because that's when we meet him in the air but Christ Christ has returned in the fullness of his word why has he done that because he's the head and the body's got to connect with it before Rapture and so when she recognizes her headship her true headship and her headship is not a denominational head her headship is not a church her headquarters is not somewhere here on Earth she's recognizing her true headship which is Christ the word and that is what's happening in True Believers she's recognizing her head Christ is here he is my head I'm becoming one with him and his word is coming through him that I'm truly his body let me say it this way Christ is the head of the body and the body at the end time recognizes that this is our this is our head Christ that's come back to us the word has come back to us again through denominational ideas he's restored the full word back to us and thus Christ our head is back and it's revealed to her this is him this is the one we seen 2,000 years ago this is the true Christ revealed and when she recognizes my head is here this is Christ she Embraces it she becomes one with it by the Holy Ghost and when she does she becomes his hands and his feet on Earth where's Jesus he's in his people what's the final manifestation to this world of Christ not Jesus in the air but Jesus in his body can you say Amen we meet him in the air but when the word comes back according to Revelations 1 he sets his foot upon the Land and Sea Christ that Covenant angel that rainbow Angel that's Christ there and when he comes down and descends that's not a physical return the physical return is to meet him in the air in a Rapture that this is a word returning of Christ the full word because that's who how many let me step back a bit how many know that Christ is not just the physical body that was here 2,000 years ago Christ is the word right he's the person of the word John 1 And1 in the beginning was the word Matthew starts out the birth of Jesus in the story L Mark Luke tells about the the beginnings being the birth of Christ John starts it with with the eagle anointing on John he starts the whole Beginnings not at the birth of Christ but to tell who this Christ really was and that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's John's Eagle Eye describing what this birth of Christ was who is he well he was a Healer who is he he's a counselor he's a princip please but if you miss the part that he is the word revealed in every generation that is Christ when Christ Reveals His word to any generation that's a revealing of Christ and when he brings the word to that generation that's Christ revealing ring himself Jesus is the word Christ is the word can you say Amen so she comes under this headship she forsakes all o others uh all the other man's ideas she leaves she exits you find this in the Book of Revelations where babylon's there Babylon is a is means religious confusion and the world is full of religious confusion especially in Christianity and the call to the bride at the last days is to come out of her my people her come out of come out of that system come out of that Babylonian religious confusion and come to where come back to the word praise the Lord come back to the true headship and there's a people it won't be a church doing it won't be this church it's a it's individuals coming back to the word and she comes back forsakes all the other men's ideas forsaking all others like a wife does when she stands in a wedding and she makes a commitment to that one man the bride makes a commitment to one man Jesus Christ all others I forsake all others it's like she takes a vow can you say am man it's a more it's a more serious vow than what the girls and the guys take at the altar that's serious but the one you take to Christ uh I'll serve you for richer for poor in sickness and in health I'm not going to leave you I'm committed to you and forsaking all others as long as I shall live that's the commitment we make to our headship Jesus Christ praise the Lord so she does it and when she does when she does that the bride now in this hour it sets her in a Rapture condition to be restored Back to Eden praise the Lord so now now you see now I said that because it gives the roots of the root of Satan's anger the root of Satan's anger is not that just he don't like you but the root of Satan's anger is this bride becoming one with her head Christ can you say Amen when you are becoming one and bringing your life through the word and giving him the preeminence in your life and making him number one in your life when he he hates that more than anything because Satan has learned something and you know I feel very confident tonight if I don't get a lot of amens I'm going to give the devil a black eye tonight I don't care because he does not like me preaching like this cuz this is what's happening now I'm going to tell you what's making saying Satan angry from the beginning but he's also getting becoming more Angry as we get closer to this Union and this oness in this Rapture he's getting more Angry that's why the prophet took the Rapture text in Psalms 27 though a host should be encamped around me I will not fear hide me in thy Pavilion Lord praise the Lord why because as the everything intensifies and once intensifying oh world the world's the politics everything's intensifying everything's Under Pressure but why isn't Under Pressure we're coming to the end of prophecies being fulfilled in the people of God the body of Christ she's coming to that moment where she's letting this word go through her and Satan can see some of the results of it and he's getting more angry at your life if you're the one bringing your life through the word and your family through the word he's becoming more angry at your family he's not going to walk away he's going to stand there more angry at you Satan can't move a man with a revelation he can mess with your spirit he can depress you he can discourage you he can speak to your mind but one day that's going to be over too he can accuse you you're not a son of God look at the M mistakes you made he can say your spirit can get low sometimes you can get physically sick in the body but then God can heal you can you say amen he can tamper with the outer two Realms of spirit and flesh because those two aren't born again but he can't get to the Revelation that God has deposited in your heart this is what makes Satan so angry it helps us to be a mature adopted Sons when you have that situation where all that live in Godly in Christ Jesus and take a stand and have a revelation shall suffer persecution and when it comes you stand surefooted and you still confident because that person angry with me it's not the person it's the devil doesn't like what I have remember I talked about a few weeks ago the Devils learned this that the people get get a revelation and they act upon it from from uh able all the way through to the bride today Satan has learned that the people that get a revelation God bypasses Satan gives it to them even when they weren't worthy of it and Satan hates when they get a revelation from Abel how did Abel bring a blood sacrifice and King brought fruits one thing Revelation he caught a revelation there nobody there was no Bible there was no teaching on it there was no seminars on it got a revelation from God that it was blood that we fell by and now it takes blood to get us back so I'm bringing this bloody animal I'm SL slitting I'm going to slit his throat I'm going to let the blood come all over all of it and and Cain is over here on this side and he says I think it's good fruits in our lives if that God honors good fruits and so he makes this beautiful table with all kinds of lush fruits on it God's going to be impressed with all of my good fruits makes it beautiful and Abel is over here and he don't know but just by Revelation he just does it and there's this big bloody table with a bloody animal around it and they both begin to worship and God says I accept Abels and I re reject Kings and the only difference was God dropped a revelation this is what you bring in worship not your own fruits not some flowery altar blood we needed blood we needed a sacrifice for our sins the only one provided place to worship God is under the shed blood of Jesus Christ no other place to worship Satan is not angry at borderline Believers Satan is not angry at compromisers Satan's not angry at the person who shouts Satan's not angry but you start living the life and you by a revelation you start living the life of Christ that's when Satan becomes more angry at you Satan is not howling of those things but he is getting more and more angry at the sons of God somebody is letting that word come through their lives and they are becoming with the word more and more he's getting his rightful position Christ is getting his rightful position in first first place in their lives and every question of life gets addressed by the word first because he is her or his head he's my head the word is my head it's not because of your personality it's not because you go to church Satan's not angry at you because you attend church that doesn't make there's hundreds of people thousands around the world that attend church some of them more faithful than you it's not that Satan's angry because you come to church and I'm really glad you're here tonight many come from distances an hour and a half away sometimes longer here tonight in the service God bless you some listening from many places God bless you but that's not what Satan is angry with you about it's the Revelation that you hold it's your dedication to come under God's headship it's your submission because only the bride will be submissive to this word the rest Rebel and say I'm not going to do that I'm going to pick and choose what I want out of the message she's not doing that she's saying I value it all I want it she becomes one with it you know why the king got mad you know why the king got mad and got in a fury about the Hebrews it's because of how they answered saying we are not going to Bow God can Deliver Us from the fire if you put us in there but we are not going to Bow if God doesn't Deliver us we if God if God delivers us praise be to God but if you throw us in there and God doesn't Deliver us we want to let you know we're still not bowing to this image praise the Lord they took a stand why did take a stand because they had the revelation of the true headship and Nebuchadnezzar was asking them to come under a different headship it was pressur to come under a different headship and worship a different image or worship a different thing just like the image of the beast of the last days he wants you to come under the Antichrist spirit and worship something different a new version of Jesus Christ a new version of Christianity but they said no we're not doing that we're not worship and so they would not bow to be swayed to worship at that image at the feet of that that image that everybody wanted them to and this is what made Satan angry it was their revelation of who to worship it's their revelation of TR who the true king was can you say Amen they refused to do it even if they died God raises up a people that are not afraid to die for this gospel God raises up young people that are not afraid to stand for the word of God and hold that Revelation in their heart he and then he goes heat up the furnace heat things up out of his Fury make it harder on him make it more scary and he thought by saying you know what I'm going to do I'm going to heat this up seven times hotter and he thought he's looking for a reaction from him and they're still just whatever you need to do but I'm going to heat it seven times harder whatever you need to do it's kind of like Jesus said to Judas you're delaying this thing whatever you need to do go do it quickly if you're going to try to cause a stir in the church don't wait go ahead and do it manifest what's in your heart get it done that's what he said to Jesus whatever you need to do do it quickly let's get it over with heat it up seven times why don't you try 14 times hotter because it doesn't matter in light of my Revelation it doesn't matter heat it up before the Rapture let it heat up all it wants to and why am I not afraid not because I have the intellectual fortitude to stand here and save young people and save people's lives from the onslaught of the sexual perversion and everything and the immodest of the immodesty of this age I don't have nothing in me to keep people back from that but I've got a word and a holy ghost that'll keep people from it and I'm going to keep preaching it cuz that's our hope it's the token that kept the death angel away it's the token applied to the home in the front post of the door it's the Holy Ghost the token is the Holy Ghost and I've I've got that to preach to you and that'll be your protection in this lustful age can somebody say Amen the reason that Satan is getting more and more angry and I just say to you is that you better be in the word you better be standing you better say God give me more Revelation what you what's the most thing you need to pray for not just the people that have cancer not just your your child that's sick pray for anything you can bring to God but you know what he said to pray for more than anything Revelation every time you come to church every time you open the word don't just open the word say God drop drop a revelation in my heart pray for Revelation more than you've ever prayed for it because that's the only thing that'll get you through the Ws of the enemy if you already got it raise your hand I already got some Revelations don't startop pray stop praying for more God drop some more in my heart God give me more I'm going to need it you're going to need it brother Johnny you're going to need it your family's going to need it all of you're going to need it
