[1:32] amen good morning everyone God bless you
[1:34] maybe while we're standing we can uh
[1:36] take our Bibles and open up to the book
[1:39] of 1 Chronicles chapter
[1:48] 12 it's a real pleasure for my wife and
[1:50] me to be here uh this this week
[1:54] fortunately we we at first it looked
[1:56] like we were only going to be able to be
[1:57] here for a day but um things worked out
[2:00] we're able to be here for a couple days
[2:01] and we're real happy about that I really
[2:03] enjoyed our time last year down in
[2:06] Tennessee and uh we're glad to be here
[2:08] again it's a real privilege this is a
[2:10] camp that I went to uh frequently and as
[2:13] a uh as a young adult and it was always
[2:15] a blessing I just appreciate uh the
[2:17] attention brother Paul and brother Barry
[2:20] and their assemblies give to helping us
[2:23] be grounded and settled as we continue
[2:25] our walk with the Lord but today we're
[2:28] going to talk about uh uh the children
[2:30] of isachar and uh the challenge of
[2:32] walking in truth in an age of competing
[2:35] narratives that's what we'll be looking
[2:36] at today let's see if I can get
[2:40] this verse 32 and of the children of
[2:42] isachar which were men that had
[2:46] understanding of the times to know what
[2:48] Israel ought to do the heads of them
[2:50] were 200 and all their Brethren were at
[2:53] their commandment so we'll be taking a
[2:55] look today at what made these children
[2:57] of isachar so special about the the time
[3:00] that they were living in let's pray
[3:03] Heavenly Father we thank you very much
[3:04] for your goodness and Grace To Us Lord I
[3:06] Thank you for bringing us here for this
[3:08] weekend father I just pray that you
[3:10] would speak to each and every one of us
[3:12] Lord I pray that you would help us to be
[3:14] more grounded and S to be more ground
[3:16] Lord that we might know uh the more
[3:18] clearly the day that we're living in and
[3:19] how we should be living in this time
[3:22] lord we just ask your blessing upon this
[3:23] service in Jesus name amen you may be
[3:26] seated just going to try to position
[3:28] this so I can see every everybody
[3:30] reasonably
[3:31] well very
[3:33] good well at the uh here in 1st
[3:36] Chronicles 12 kind of step back and get
[3:39] a little bit of the
[3:41] context uh David had been anointed king
[3:44] as a young boy and um when King Saul uh
[3:48] saw how successful and was and what a
[3:50] great warrior he was after he had slain
[3:53] Goliath and uh Saul slain his thousands
[3:56] but David his 10 thousands uh David was
[3:59] definitely on on Saul's uh radar screen
[4:02] and this was a time of uh even after
[4:06] Saul was uh chasing David all over the
[4:08] country and uh David knew that he was
[4:11] God's anointed man for the hour but that
[4:13] didn't take away that David's flesh got
[4:16] really anxious and fearful and nervous
[4:18] many times even to the extent that for a
[4:20] couple years he actually lived in uh in
[4:23] PH in philistia in Goliath's Hometown
[4:26] he's he's he's leaving the promised land
[4:29] he
[4:30] he's he's hiding from a Saul there in
[4:32] the uh there in the town of his uh
[4:34] greatest enemy it wasn't an easy time
[4:38] but finally the Philistines uh um they
[4:41] defeated Saul's Army uh Saul's dead and
[4:44] uh David uh is uh is is is crowned King
[4:48] and when we look at our Sunday school
[4:49] story books it seems like that uh Saul's
[4:53] uh kingdom comes to its demise and
[4:55] David's Kingdom starts R away in the
[4:58] next uh story on the next next page but
[5:00] that's not the way it was there was
[5:02] actually a time of about seven eight
[5:04] years of of Civil War while David is
[5:06] King in Hebron and uh Saul's son
[5:09] ishbosheth is uh is is uh is King in
[5:13] another place I forget what the city was
[5:15] but there was a civil war between the
[5:16] two it was a time of of of great
[5:19] uncertainty and Israel I can imagine
[5:22] ishbosheth supporters the house of Saul
[5:25] they could be parading down the streets
[5:26] saying stop the steel stop the steel
[5:28] David is David stealing the kingdom and
[5:31] uh and David supporters out there make
[5:33] make Israel great again make Israel
[5:35] great again this is this this wasn't an
[5:38] easy time for them to live in the Sunday
[5:40] school story books we read like as one
[5:42] goes quickly from one to the other but
[5:44] there was a time of uh of Civil War and
[5:47] you can read about it in then 2 Samuel
[5:49] 3:1 it says there was a long war between
[5:52] the house of Saul in the House of David
[5:55] in verse six and it came to pass while
[5:57] there was war between the house of Saul
[5:59] and the House of David it wasn't an easy
[6:02] time and Times of transition really
[6:05] they're never easy and that's when we
[6:07] need uh people who know that what time
[6:10] it is and how to live in that time and
[6:14] uh finally um as as this uh this Civil
[6:17] War was kind of winding to a close um
[6:20] the Leading Men of Israel United
[6:22] together and that's what you that's what
[6:24] we read in 1 Chronicles CH 12 and the
[6:27] Leading Men of Israel come to Hebron to
[6:29] make David King in 1 Chronicle tells us
[6:32] about the men from each tribe and and
[6:35] you can pick this up in the in the
[6:37] chapter but in it talks about the men of
[6:39] Judah in verse uh verse 24 of 1st
[6:41] Chronicles 12 they sent
[6:44] 6,800 men armed with shields and Spears
[6:47] and then the tribe of Simeon sends 7,100
[6:51] men All Men of Valor these men are
[6:54] described Levi uh sends
[6:57] 4,600 men led by their might Mighty
[6:59] priests zadok and jeho Benjamin these
[7:03] are Sauls this is the tribe that Saul
[7:05] came from they sent 3,000 men to Hebron
[7:07] to to Crown David King Ephraim sent over
[7:11] 20,000 men all all of these men were
[7:13] famous for their Valor manasse sent
[7:16] 18,000 men Zebulon sent 50,000 men the
[7:20] Bible says these are men who were expert
[7:22] in war Nally sent a thousand captains
[7:26] 7,000 spearmen Dan it over 28,000 expert
[7:31] men in war Asher sent 40,000 and two and
[7:35] a half tribes on the other side of
[7:36] Jordan they sent
[7:38] 120,000 men and
[7:41] isachar they send just 200 men they're
[7:46] not described of Men of Valor doesn't
[7:49] say whether they have swords with them
[7:51] Shields or spears none of that is said
[7:53] about the men of isachar and the men of
[7:56] isachar these little this party of 200
[7:58] men you wouldn't even hardly see them
[8:01] among this this great multitude of
[8:04] Mighty Warriors but these were men that
[8:08] were special for their time because they
[8:10] were men of understanding they knew the
[8:14] times they were living it was a chaotic
[8:16] time and uncertain time and these were
[8:17] men with discernment who understood the
[8:19] times to know what Israel ought to do
[8:22] and when we live in times of uncertainty
[8:24] and that describes the time that we're
[8:26] living in it's important to be men and
[8:28] women of
[8:29] understanding I just I I enjoy reading
[8:33] through the messages especially
[8:35] sometimes the opening prayers and some
[8:37] of brother brandom's
[8:38] messages especially those messages that
[8:41] sound really have a have have a have a
[8:43] deep title because it can be it can be
[8:45] intimidating as as young people to uh to
[8:48] start getting into the message because
[8:49] like where do you start you've got plank
[8:52] upon plank upon plank of the bookshelf
[8:54] where do you start and it's 70 weeks of
[8:57] Daniel the seven sealed or it can be
[9:00] kind of intimidating but it's
[9:02] interesting in some of these messages
[9:04] the very first prayer at the beginning
[9:06] is amazingly and beautifully simple this
[9:08] is the paragraph two from the third
[9:11] seal we've come again tonight Lord to
[9:14] attempt this meeting and to pray thee to
[9:17] open to us Lord this third seal of this
[9:19] book that it might be known to us that
[9:22] we would know what to do and how to live
[9:27] and how to be better Christians
[9:30] and to me that opening prayer some just
[9:32] kind of cuts through the mysteriousness
[9:36] because God means it to be simple he
[9:38] means for the vision to be simple so
[9:40] that we can run forward and live our
[9:42] life with it this isn't an isolated
[9:44] prayer and paragraph four is your life
[9:47] worthy of the Gospel brother bradam says
[9:49] we've assembled together father for no
[9:51] other purpose but to try to learn how to
[9:54] live better and to live close to you for
[9:57] we see the day approaching
[10:00] paragraph two of Christ is the mystery
[10:02] of God revealed again he's just praying
[10:04] for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as
[10:06] we meet together this morning to teach
[10:08] your word that we might know how to live
[10:11] in this present day and what is the time
[10:14] of day that we're living in and we can
[10:17] keep on going with these but again this
[10:19] this is paragraph 40 a man running from
[10:20] the presence of the Lord that we might
[10:22] know how to live in this present day at
[10:24] the approaching of the Lord Jesus that
[10:26] we might know just how to live in this
[10:28] present day
[10:29] what to look forward to what to do
[10:33] brother brandham was a man of isachar he
[10:36] was a man of understanding who who knew
[10:39] the time that we were living in to know
[10:40] what Israel to know what the bride ought
[10:42] to do in that time that's what that's
[10:44] the kind of people that we want to be
[10:45] today also that's our purpose of being
[10:48] here Lord we love you we're trying to
[10:50] prepare for that
[10:52] hour it's a time of great uncertainty so
[10:55] we want to know the time that we're
[10:57] living in and how we should and how we
[10:59] should be living in this in this time
[11:01] brother Brandon says we're living in a
[11:02] day of great uncertainty since time
[11:05] first began back in the Garden of Eden
[11:07] When sin came in and broke eternity into
[11:09] time I don't believe there's ever been a
[11:11] space of time with so much
[11:14] uncertainty as today because there's not
[11:17] even one hope left in the natural world
[11:20] today a lot of uncertainty and he just
[11:23] goes on later in the message what kind
[11:24] of uncertainty is there there's the
[11:27] uncertainty of of home life and it's not
[11:31] an unusual thing anymore um get a group
[11:34] of young people together especially out
[11:36] out out out out in the world you're
[11:39] unique if you have a mom and dad who
[11:41] stay together and and help you as a as
[11:44] as a as a healthy family and that can
[11:47] even come into come into our own ranks
[11:50] within the message just because you know
[11:52] moms and dads um maybe they weren't
[11:54] Believers or maybe they started as
[11:55] Believers and then things happened and
[11:58] they and their Rel relationship got
[11:59] strained and they might have got and
[12:01] they and they might have gotten divorced
[12:03] and and as as as kids we can feel very
[12:05] conflicted about that we can even blame
[12:07] ourselves that that's our fault it's not
[12:09] your fault like brother uh like Brother
[12:11] Sam was preaching last night there many
[12:14] men in the Bible sus who get them who
[12:16] find themselves in really difficult
[12:18] circumstances and they didn't do
[12:20] anything to get them there Daniel did
[12:22] nothing wrong to find himself in Babylon
[12:25] he did nothing wrong to get thrown into
[12:27] the lion's dead and you might feel like
[12:28] your home life is a lion's den and you
[12:31] might feel I wish I could have done this
[12:32] if I had have been a better kid maybe
[12:34] Mom and Dad would have stayed together
[12:35] those are the thoughts of the devil you
[12:37] you're not responsible for that but you
[12:40] might have done nothing wrong like you
[12:41] find yourself in the lion Den but the
[12:43] angel of the Lord can be with you right
[12:45] there and can strengthen you because
[12:48] that's the unfortunately a broken home
[12:50] is the new normal today and the devil's
[12:52] going to is is is knocking on the homes
[12:54] of Believers even till today to break
[12:56] them up but doesn't matter what kind of
[12:58] home life you have you can still be an
[13:01] overcomer there remember I was teaching
[13:04] years ago was just in the extraordinary
[13:08] circumstance um a home was one of my
[13:10] students home was just was breaking up
[13:12] before us and was really really sad and
[13:14] you're teaching your your kids you see
[13:16] the and you see the strain in the kids's
[13:17] eyes how difficult it is for them and I
[13:19] was teaching one day in Bible class and
[13:21] the Lord just gave open the scripture
[13:23] from Psalm 27 says that when my father
[13:27] and my mother forsake me then the Lord
[13:29] will take me up that's Psalm 27:10 so no
[13:33] matter what circumstances we can find
[13:34] ourselves in and say oh man I'm don't
[13:36] live in the perfect message home I'm
[13:37] sorry there's no perfect message home
[13:40] there's no perfect believer there's no
[13:42] perfect Christian we're all needing the
[13:44] the grace and the power of God um but
[13:47] when my mom and dad forsake me the Lord
[13:49] will take me up in these times of great
[13:51] uncertainty God's still there with you
[13:54] that doesn't change home life can be
[13:56] uncertain your job can be uncertain I
[14:00] mean we're all most of us here um how
[14:02] many of us are uh 29 and under 18 to 29
[14:06] years we're all J zers then and the Gen
[14:10] Z you're coming of age um yeah some of
[14:13] us were in college around the financial
[14:15] crisis of 2008 2009 that's not a really
[14:19] good time to enter the job market I was
[14:22] at Ohio State and doing a year of
[14:24] graduate school which I never finished I
[14:26] met my wife that same year and I got my
[14:28] married instead of my masters but I was
[14:30] very glad to be that one year in
[14:32] graduate school because I how could I
[14:35] find a job that's really tough and then
[14:37] you co hits and the econom is very
[14:40] uncertain we live in uncertain
[14:43] times uncertainty of War I'd never
[14:47] really expected in in my lifetime to
[14:50] have the kind of global uncertainty of
[14:52] of war that we see today in the Middle
[14:54] East in Ukraine in uh in South Asia Asia
[14:59] um all over the place there's a lot of
[15:01] uncertainty about
[15:02] war the uncertainty of of of of churches
[15:06] it's very easy to uh we can look at at
[15:09] at church as being our anchor and church
[15:11] is a great thing we have a we can have
[15:12] great deacons great pastors great Sunday
[15:14] school teachers but those are not our
[15:18] anchors and um I I I I grew up in a
[15:22] message Church like many of you did and
[15:24] I I probably grew up with a good dose of
[15:28] uh of Church Pride so glad I had the the
[15:30] best pastor in the message the best
[15:32] Church in the message and then my pastor
[15:34] of so many years gets up and leaves the
[15:38] message talk about the time of
[15:40] uncertainty and you think everything is
[15:43] is rocks all in your life you've got the
[15:45] Holy Spirit you're going forward and
[15:46] then that happens like what am I going
[15:49] to do now God it's a time of uncertainty
[15:53] and that can that can affect a person
[15:54] and and um you know what I'm you can
[15:57] kind of almost
[15:59] you hate to see those things happen I
[16:02] kind of think though about the story of
[16:03] the wise man who build his house upon a
[16:04] rock and the foolish man who build his
[16:06] house upon the sand and the man who
[16:09] built his house upon the sand the winds
[16:10] came the storm came and the Wall came
[16:13] tumbling down right Splat well the Bible
[16:16] describes it great was the fall of it
[16:19] great was the fall of his house but it
[16:21] was also a great
[16:23] opportunity because if your faulty
[16:26] Foundation exposed you have an
[16:29] opportunity to build upon a foundation
[16:32] stronger than your
[16:33] pastor you have the opportunity to build
[16:35] upon a foundation that's stronger than
[16:37] your parents you have an opportunity to
[16:40] build upon a foundation where God's word
[16:42] is being laid Brick by Brick In your own
[16:46] heart and when my pastor left the
[16:48] message that was a very difficult time
[16:50] for me I was already married I had I had
[16:53] I had I I I had a son I'm responsible
[16:55] leading my home but it was it was a
[16:57] shaking time but it was I can look back
[17:00] and say it was it was a good time
[17:02] because God was putting us on a rock
[17:04] solid
[17:06] foundation oh uncertain sounds elections
[17:10] if brother brandom only knew how
[17:13] uncertain elections could be I'm not
[17:15] looking forward to next year's election
[17:17] year anybody else no it's it's it's it's
[17:19] an uncertain time and the level of uh
[17:22] vital is just so uh so uh so so high how
[17:26] that time has whoops how that time has
[17:28] come now so much
[17:31] uncertainty and you can look I mean all
[17:34] these are are are pretty great uncertain
[17:36] things but the level of uncertainty that
[17:39] the devil brings into it I had to check
[17:42] into a flight recently and usually when
[17:44] you check into your flight you it's a
[17:46] matter of course just put your pass your
[17:48] your passport number in all that kind of
[17:49] stuff your name and this was the first
[17:51] time I'd ever gotten this menu for
[17:56] gender What UN uncertain
[18:00] times and and we can and we can chuckle
[18:04] at it but it's it's not a funny thing
[18:07] because the people don't even
[18:09] know who they are or what they are and
[18:15] the and the and the worst thing about it
[18:16] you know growing up in adolescence
[18:18] that's a tough thing we feel strange
[18:21] things as we're growing up in adolesence
[18:22] our body send us all kinds of signals
[18:25] and the way the world is today even with
[18:27] uh schools even on your computers as
[18:29] you're scroll scrolling on your phones
[18:33] we see things that we don't really want
[18:34] to see we see things we weren't looking
[18:36] for but it can still impact you it can
[18:39] still grab your attention get your
[18:41] thoughts going in a certain way a
[18:43] certain direction and it's it's it's a
[18:45] rough thing and when folks are already
[18:48] in a time of their life when there's a
[18:49] lot of Uncertain with uh hormones and
[18:52] your body is changing all those things
[18:54] and
[18:55] then thoughts come you should identify
[18:57] with this you've got this particular
[18:59] feeling that's the way you are maybe
[19:01] maybe yeah why am I I I I uh someone I I
[19:06] I know a friend of mine growing up she
[19:09] was thinking yeah why am I such Trends
[19:11] good Trends with all all the girls
[19:12] around me I really don't have any good
[19:14] guy friend she comes home and asks her
[19:15] mom mom does that mean I'm
[19:18] lesbian that wouldn't have been a
[19:20] question I was asked 20 years ago but
[19:23] because all these thoughts are already
[19:25] there and then there then the Devil's
[19:28] trying to get you to identify with
[19:29] certain things and then you make it a a
[19:32] part of your identity and not just
[19:34] something that you feel that you want to
[19:35] yeah we're we're created in God's image
[19:37] but we're in sinense all the things that
[19:39] we feel we can't identify with them
[19:41] because that's the effects of sin in our
[19:42] lives but the devil makes it so hard and
[19:45] then man why do I not seem to fit in
[19:47] think maybe I'm a maybe I'm a guy in a
[19:50] girl's body or the other way around he's
[19:52] giving confusion and uncertainty all
[19:54] over the place and um more than ever
[19:57] before we need men of isar who can know
[20:00] the time that we're living in and how we
[20:02] need to live in this
[20:05] time it's important that um to recognize
[20:08] that facts and Truth are two different
[20:12] things things can be
[20:14] factual but are they true because there
[20:17] are many ways to put facts together into
[20:21] a
[20:22] narrative but only one of them can be
[20:25] right now what is this word narrative
[20:28] come across it sometimes but this is a
[20:30] uh it's a way of
[20:32] presenting or understanding a situation
[20:34] or series of events that's going to
[20:37] reflect or promote a particular point of
[20:39] view or set of values this isn't a word
[20:42] that we might use every single day if
[20:44] you listen to the news much or or watch
[20:46] the news you you you'll hear it bandied
[20:47] about but um narratives are
[20:50] important give you a little example
[20:53] here's a uh picture of my lovely family
[20:56] somewhat dated picture but but uh
[20:58] they're still lovely
[21:00] nonetheless um but we recently moved um
[21:03] got into a new house and my uh my son
[21:07] was uh pointing out to me the the truth
[21:10] that um this kitchen does not have a
[21:12] dishwasher and he was highly concerned
[21:15] about this because this is like this is
[21:16] all of a sudden the number one Home
[21:18] Improvement project that we've got to
[21:20] get a dishwasher I said job I think
[21:22] we'll be okay cuz I think we've got
[21:24] three
[21:25] dishwashers no what do you mean Dad no I
[21:28] got one two Dad no we need a
[21:31] dishwasher so um so we still don't have
[21:34] we still have the three dishwashers and
[21:37] uh my wife was the youngest of six they
[21:39] didn't have a dishwasher growing up they
[21:40] had six dishwashers as well and um we've
[21:44] kind of gotten into a little bit of the
[21:45] routine after supper we just kind of
[21:48] make ourselves scarce and the kids can
[21:50] work on washing the dishes and I try to
[21:52] find a corner of the house as far away
[21:54] from the kitchen as possible cuz this is
[21:56] not a real peaceful time of the evening
[21:58] so one one one one evening I'm in the
[22:00] other corner of the house making a fire
[22:02] because that's what men do when it's
[22:03] kind of cool outside it's kind of nice
[22:05] you're making your fire and all of a
[22:07] sudden you I just hear these explosions
[22:09] in the kitchen going on and then my wife
[22:11] says kids get to work in there if I hear
[22:13] anything else so all of a sudden my
[22:15] blood pressure just goes to the roof and
[22:17] I could there's a problem I'm going to
[22:19] solve it I'm about the point where I RI
[22:21] my belt up it's that kind of a thing so
[22:23] I just go there guys what's going on
[22:26] here and I just my my little girl the
[22:29] youngest one she's crying on the ground
[22:30] said mama told you to get up and do the
[22:32] dishes stand up bam I gave her a spank
[22:36] in my son's eyes Dad she didn't do
[22:42] anything he was mortified that his
[22:45] father had just perpetrated this act of
[22:47] Injustice because all that had happened
[22:51] was little Sophie had fallen on the
[22:55] floor and started crying
[23:00] I heard what I
[23:01] heard and I put it into a narrative that
[23:05] my kids are messing up they're
[23:07] disobeying if I spare the rod I will
[23:10] spoil the child I will take care of this
[23:13] narratives get give meaning and I got
[23:16] the narrative wrong and when we get the
[23:19] narrative wrong the facts of the
[23:21] situation were all the same child on the
[23:24] floor when they shouldn't have
[23:26] been children crying when they should
[23:29] have been effectively efficiently
[23:30] working those are the
[23:32] facts but my narrative I got it all
[23:35] wrong and I had to go back apologize to
[23:39] my children I had to help little Sophie
[23:42] do the dishes so that worked out that
[23:45] was my Act of uh active Penance there
[23:47] but we see the importance of a
[23:51] narrative cuz just the facts we think
[23:54] knowing facts is everything no you're
[23:56] not even halfway home by knowing facts
[23:59] it's the narrative how you understand
[24:01] those facts that is the most important
[24:05] and we live in a world where you've got
[24:07] all kinds of political events going on
[24:09] and uh there can be the same events take
[24:12] a look same people this is a protest in
[24:15] Berlin recently these are
[24:17] Palestinians uh Palestinian supporters
[24:20] protesting they're not conflicting that
[24:22] there was that there was an event that
[24:23] happened October 7th the the people can
[24:26] be talk about the same people
[24:28] same events but whether you think
[24:30] they're terrorists or Freedom Fighters
[24:32] all depends on your
[24:36] narrative same events same people but
[24:39] the narrative is what's important I was
[24:43] surprised uh I just read yesterday uh a
[24:46] recent poll uh surveying American young
[24:50] people j z 18 to 29 year olds ex 20% of
[24:55] them had a positive View of Osama bin
[24:59] Laden 20% of them so if we were
[25:02] basically were to ask like the first
[25:04] four row to stand
[25:07] here that would be the group that would
[25:09] have a positive view of Osama bin Lon
[25:11] 30% say his views were actually a Force
[25:14] for good he just shouldn't have been so
[25:15] violent with them how can this be it's
[25:19] the narrative it's the the way of
[25:22] understanding certain events they're not
[25:23] disputing he caused the 10 20 Towers to
[25:25] fall that's not in dispute it's the it's
[25:28] the it's the narrative behind it the way
[25:30] the way of understanding and I I admire
[25:33] what Benjamin Netanyahu when he made a
[25:35] speech shortly after October 7th he
[25:37] brought the Jews right back to what the
[25:40] narrative was the the truth is remember
[25:43] what amlc has done to you don't forget
[25:46] that because this is the battle that
[25:48] that we're in and it's important for us
[25:49] to go back what kind of battle are we in
[25:52] we're not battling against flesh and
[25:53] blood we're battling against
[25:54] principalities against Powers that's the
[25:56] narrative and we can get distracted by
[25:59] so many things nowadays we can get
[26:01] distracted by oh man we're so frustrated
[26:04] with Trump we're so frustrated with b
[26:05] and we're so Frid we can get caught up
[26:07] in all those little narratives none of
[26:09] those narratives really have that much
[26:11] impact on our
[26:12] soul and I Proverbs I think Proverbs
[26:15] chapter 4 says keep your heart with all
[26:18] diligence and it can be so hard when
[26:21] when we can when when when when our when
[26:24] political Flames can be so ignited we we
[26:26] care so much about one party or the
[26:28] other party and we're not keeping our
[26:29] heart then because we'll be following
[26:31] the news much more than we follow God's
[26:34] word at that point and and and we're not
[26:36] keeping our heart then so it's it's
[26:39] important um to remember what narrative
[26:42] is actually true and it used to be there
[26:45] General acceptance that there was one
[26:47] narrative that was true and that's God's
[26:49] narrative that's Revelation but God says
[26:52] um yeah you can agree or disagree with
[26:54] it but that's what God said that's the
[26:56] that's the reigning narrative but in our
[26:59] world um Revelation is kind of U there
[27:02] is no Revelation anymore there are no
[27:04] absolutes and instead of absolutes there
[27:07] are just conflicting narratives there's
[27:11] narrative one two 3 four and what does
[27:14] this do they said basically any
[27:17] narrative that you espouse can have
[27:19] equal value that's your Truth for you
[27:20] that's your Truth for you all it does
[27:23] really is just replace certainty with
[27:26] questions and that's what's happened
[27:28] today because there is no more re the
[27:31] world says there's no more revealed
[27:33] truth you have what you think is true
[27:35] they have what they think is true and we
[27:37] just kind of let the rest stay in the
[27:38] middle but this is a uh I can remember
[27:40] when I was in college I was I was in the
[27:43] cafeteria I was eating breakfast there
[27:44] by myself with my Bible open in the
[27:47] cafeteria and uh and uh having my
[27:50] devotions at breakfast at the same time
[27:52] and I came across this Psalm and I think
[27:54] it was ining finals week I have more
[27:57] understanding understanding than all my
[27:58] teachers I really liked that one I
[28:01] really like that one why is it though my
[28:04] teachers my professors KN know a lot
[28:07] more facts than I
[28:08] do but the number of facts isn't what
[28:11] determines wisdom it's the understanding
[28:14] that determines wisdom you might know
[28:16] far fewer facts but if you can put those
[28:19] facts together the right way like the
[28:20] men of isachar did you will have far
[28:23] more understanding than your teachers
[28:25] why because your testimonies are your
[28:28] meditation and that's is a there's a lot
[28:31] of lot of um competition for our for our
[28:35] attention nowadays Daniel chapter 12
[28:38] describes the last
[28:40] days but thou o Daniel shut up the words
[28:43] and seal the book even to the time of
[28:45] the end many shall run to and fro and
[28:48] knowledge shall be increased this
[28:51] describes the day that we live in
[28:53] knowledge being increased people running
[28:55] to and fro the time of the end is
[28:58] characterized by this increasing
[29:00] knowledge yet we also see that knowledge
[29:03] itself is not enough to
[29:06] overcome that's not enough because in
[29:08] this scripture there's something that's
[29:10] kept back and what's kept back shut up
[29:13] the words seal the book till the time of
[29:15] the end that which is sealed up that is
[29:19] kept back and that is what is going to
[29:21] be enough to make an overcomer but just
[29:24] knowledge running to and fro that's not
[29:26] going to be enough God has Unleashed
[29:28] Revelation Unleashed understanding in
[29:32] this day and that is what makes us uh
[29:35] Victorious so our purpose this morning
[29:38] is to speak about how we can have an
[29:42] understanding of the times we do live in
[29:45] a world where knowledge abounds and
[29:48] there'll be more knowledge than we can
[29:49] really keep track of it just a time of
[29:52] of
[29:53] confusion we live in this world um via
[29:56] Google
[29:57] knowledge is literally at your
[29:59] fingertips you can ask Google any
[30:01] question you can ask chat GPT just any
[30:04] question and they'll give you a good
[30:05] answer and uh in my small group this
[30:08] morning we were talking about seeking
[30:09] God's will for your life and um it's not
[30:12] always easy to get an answer really
[30:14] quickly from the Lord on these things
[30:16] Google though you type in a question
[30:18] you'll get the answer in a couple
[30:20] milliseconds that's the kind of waiting
[30:22] time that gen Z is used to but that's
[30:25] not how God works and Google really
[30:28] doesn't care about God's will for your
[30:30] life they just care about clicks and
[30:31] your ad Revenue so don't go to Google
[30:35] for the big questions of your life you
[30:37] take those to the word of God take those
[30:39] to the Lord um there in there in in
[30:42] prayer all this knowledge Google has
[30:45] plenty of facts out there but all the
[30:47] knowledge all the facts don't imply
[30:51] wisdom in fact wisdom couldn't be
[30:54] further away than what we find on the
[30:56] internet today um I shared this last
[31:00] year that uh um hands down the two most
[31:03] dangerous words in the English language
[31:05] today are studies show you can find a
[31:09] study to uh to verify anything that you
[31:11] want to have verified and there's a and
[31:14] a lot of studies nowadays have to be
[31:16] called back because they're not
[31:17] verifiable there's plagiarism issues so
[31:20] we can look and try to find via Google
[31:22] um an answer with footnotes it's uh uh
[31:25] psychologically verified and all that
[31:27] that is not an absolute absolute there's
[31:29] only one of those that's the word of God
[31:31] so we have lots of facts out there but
[31:33] the important thing is where is
[31:41] truth brother brandom says the days are
[31:43] growing evil because man's knowledge
[31:45] that he received in the Garden of Eden
[31:47] when he left the Tree of Life to eat
[31:49] from the Tree of knowledge that
[31:50] knowledge man's knowledge is increasing
[31:54] constantly and as knowledge is increases
[31:58] they get away from the Bible and get
[32:00] into a theory we see that today and what
[32:03] this is getting away from the Bible
[32:05] That's Revelation you're getting into a
[32:07] theory that's narrative 1 narrative two
[32:10] narrative three narrative four there's
[32:12] really no absolute
[32:14] anymore and now the power has come for
[32:17] the world has become very skeptical and
[32:21] skepticism that's something we're just
[32:23] basically holding anything that has a
[32:25] claim of Truth at Arms length I'm not
[32:28] going to I don't know if I really want
[32:29] to accept that or not I can I I don't
[32:31] see this is really right about it that's
[32:32] really right about it I I'll listen to
[32:34] it look at it but I'm not going to
[32:36] accept it I'm not going to accept this
[32:38] either because I see this this and this
[32:39] is potential problems there a skeptic
[32:42] keeps everything at arms length and will
[32:44] Embrace nothing because he wants to keep
[32:47] himself safe from all the from anything
[32:49] that could lead him astray and if you
[32:52] getting away from the Bible getting into
[32:54] theories getting the narratives then you
[32:55] don't have anything that has a has a
[32:57] claim of Truth on you and I wouldn't
[32:59] have thought about this but this
[33:01] skepticism this has a connection to the
[33:04] spirit of the day one of the The Book of
[33:06] Revelation talks about uh lukewarmness
[33:10] as characterized in the age of laoda and
[33:12] uh synonymous for Luke Waris you can be
[33:15] uncommitted indifferent unconcerned
[33:17] irresolute you kind of keep things at
[33:20] arms length you'll be undecided and um
[33:23] I'd always kind of thought about
[33:24] lukewarmness as being yeah yeah living a
[33:27] little bit of a compromising life not
[33:29] really on fire for the Lord but there's
[33:31] more to it from that when brother
[33:32] brandham discusses it this from from the
[33:35] church age book he's crying out to this
[33:37] last age this lukewarm age you have the
[33:39] word you have more Bibles than ever but
[33:41] you're not doing anything about the word
[33:43] except dividing and hacking into pieces
[33:46] taking what you want and leaving out
[33:47] what you don't want you're not
[33:49] interested in living it but debating it
[33:53] and that's the you you can talk about
[33:55] you can you have one person's narrative
[33:57] of what God's word means somebody else's
[33:58] narrative what God words mean somebody
[34:00] else's narrative what God's word means
[34:02] and you can be skeptical of it because
[34:03] you can just talk and debate hack it to
[34:05] Pieces take what you want that he says
[34:08] that is
[34:09] lukewarmness because you're not
[34:10] accepting anything you're just keeping
[34:13] it at arms length and what um you're not
[34:15] you're not interested in living it but
[34:17] debating it talking about it that's not
[34:19] living it but just debating it because
[34:21] says I would sooner you were cold or hot
[34:24] if you were cold or rejected that I
[34:26] could stand that that if you'd get white
[34:28] hot to know its truth and live it I'd
[34:31] praise you for that that is when when
[34:33] when you're when when when you're you're
[34:35] lukewarm you're not doing anything about
[34:36] it you really giving the answer either
[34:39] way you're just living in the gray of
[34:42] questions and questions that's is a uh
[34:46] this is a this is a time in our lives in
[34:48] the world today where nobody really
[34:50] likes truth because truth has a claim on
[34:53] us we have to do something with truth
[34:55] whereas a question that can be actually
[34:58] kind of convenient um it's easy to it's
[35:00] easier to talk about truth and discuss
[35:02] it with questions because if you're just
[35:03] asking questions you really can't be
[35:06] wrong and sometimes when you ask
[35:08] questions some people ask questions to
[35:10] um actually get an
[35:12] answer other people ask questions to
[35:16] show off what they
[35:18] know if you've been in college you
[35:20] probably I've heard that you go to this
[35:22] Prof this Symposium or something and
[35:25] somebody gets up and asks a question
[35:27] five minutes into their talk they
[35:28] haven't even asked their question they
[35:29] just want to show off what they know
[35:31] they're they're not really seeking truth
[35:35] but how do we live in a world um where
[35:38] questions are the greatest and instead
[35:40] of just actually seeking truth how do we
[35:43] deal with the questions and Pope Francis
[35:46] he kind of uh epitomizes the spirit of
[35:48] the day who am I to judge the Catholic
[35:51] Church used to have pretty strong stands
[35:53] of morality on uh whether it be abortion
[35:56] um
[35:57] marriage there were some pretty strong
[35:59] stands but now he's just eroding all of
[36:01] this as who am I to judge he's not
[36:03] taking a taking a stand there and he's
[36:06] gotten some uh some flak for that he
[36:08] recently had a a conference at the
[36:10] Vatican with a bunch of Bishops and and
[36:13] priest and this the following article
[36:15] was written by one of the priests who
[36:16] was there who was critical of
[36:17] them he says Pope Francis is just giving
[36:20] question marks no man will give his life
[36:23] for a question mark he will for an
[36:26] exclamation
[36:27] point question marks litter the
[36:30] landscape certainty appears to be a
[36:33] problem not a
[36:35] solution without truth we're only left
[36:38] with our own conclusions which aren't
[36:41] truths Worth Dying For and thus aren't
[36:44] truths worth living for and I think this
[36:47] is a really uh perceptive remark um this
[36:51] is the world today there there are are
[36:53] are questions abound as long as you're
[36:55] asking questions you're doing great but
[36:57] really questions are there to get to
[36:59] truth people talk about it's all the
[37:02] journey the journey is more important
[37:03] than the destination well try telling
[37:05] your kids that after a 15-hour road trip
[37:07] the destination's important questions
[37:10] are also important if they get you the
[37:12] truth if a question doesn't get you the
[37:14] truth it might just be distracting you
[37:16] and taking up your time and the Vatican
[37:19] has has has has has has an issue here
[37:22] truth is certain it's an exclamation
[37:25] point um if there's an EXC there's a I
[37:29] get to I do I do a a class in my in in
[37:33] junior high towards the beginning of the
[37:35] year how to write emails because all of
[37:38] a sudden when the kids get into junior
[37:39] high they have their own email address
[37:41] they can start emailing me and I get
[37:43] quite the emails sometimes with bold
[37:44] letter types and and Exclamation point
[37:46] Exclamation point Mr crook would you
[37:48] please do this Exclamation point
[37:49] Exclamation point Exclamation Bo today
[37:51] please bold the police might not be
[37:54] there and then they give their names we
[37:56] you kind of need to how do you use how
[37:58] do you write an email you don't use bold
[38:00] face all caps exclamation points too
[38:02] much with your boss or your teacher that
[38:04] kind of thing but exclamation points
[38:07] they're meant to get out and grab your
[38:09] attention that's what they're meant for
[38:11] truth is certain and Truth God's truth
[38:14] is has exclamation points John the
[38:16] Baptist wasn't just saying would you
[38:18] like to repent would you think about
[38:21] maybe repenting that's not how John the
[38:24] Baptist was his repent the kingdom of
[38:26] heaven at hand it's not like our our
[38:28] moms who get us up for for for want to
[38:32] get up now it's time to go to school
[38:34] want to get up sweetheart come on I got
[38:36] breakfast for I got your favor you can I
[38:38] that's not how God's truth works is get
[38:41] up now got to get the table now repent
[38:45] or um behold the bridegroom comes go out
[38:48] to meet him now this is what truth is it
[38:51] meant action but that's not uh how the
[38:55] devil likes uh to have us have truth he
[38:58] wants to take all these exclamation
[39:00] points of Truth and show them in another
[39:03] light to kind of bend them gradually
[39:06] into a question mark because then
[39:09] there's nothing we have to do now not
[39:11] all questions many question you know uh
[39:14] teachers will tell you or students tell
[39:16] you there's no such thing as a stupid
[39:18] question that's uh that's uh true um not
[39:22] all questions um are bad not all but not
[39:25] all questions are are as as good as
[39:27] others we know that as well uh just ask
[39:29] the person who lives in customer service
[39:31] if all questions are equally good
[39:33] they're not but sometimes God will do
[39:36] things in a certain way with the
[39:38] intention of creating a
[39:43] question and here's an example in Exodus
[39:45] chap 12 this is as the Israel is getting
[39:48] the Passover ready for the first time
[39:50] all these families have gotten the
[39:51] instructions from Moses what they're
[39:53] supposed to do with the lamb what
[39:54] they're supposed to do with the Lamb's
[39:56] blood blood how they're supposed to
[39:57] apply I just ad door everything and
[40:00] Moses says do it this way he says it
[40:03] shall come to pass when you come under
[40:05] the land when the Lord he will give you
[40:07] according to he's promised you'll keep
[40:09] this service and it shall come to pass
[40:11] when your children shall say unto you
[40:14] why are we doing this God is doing
[40:17] things in a certain way to raise a
[40:20] question among the Next Generation so
[40:22] that when they say why are we doing this
[40:24] this way Dad Dad will say I'm so glad
[40:26] you asked and you can explain the
[40:28] importance of redemption by Blood so
[40:31] sometimes we can come through come up to
[40:33] questions in our lives that can be very
[40:36] uncomfortable because when you ask a
[40:38] question you have to make yourself
[40:39] vulnerable you have to admit I don't
[40:41] know this I'm uncertain about this and
[40:43] that's we don't like doing that I can
[40:45] remember growing up in the message I had
[40:47] uh questions how God is sending a
[40:50] prophet are we not following a man I I
[40:52] went to a Baptist Church school and I I
[40:54] I hear all the uh about the trinitarian
[40:57] verses in the Bible there are in
[40:58] trinitarian interpretations of the
[41:00] verses in the Bible and questions back
[41:02] and forth and for a long time I was
[41:04] afraid to ask the questions because I
[41:06] would be afraid man if I go ask somebody
[41:08] in my church to look at me what do you
[41:10] mean don't you believe the message and
[41:12] that and the fear of that question was
[41:15] just it stopped me dead in my tracks and
[41:18] consequently I didn't ask my questions
[41:20] for a long time and I just got more
[41:23] confused more confused more confused and
[41:25] didn't what to do with it and finally I
[41:28] can remember I was down at Louisiana
[41:29] camp and there was a Saturday evening
[41:31] service and I went to Camp full of
[41:33] expectation that God was going to give
[41:35] me what I had asked for and at the end
[41:38] of the services the altar call I'm up
[41:40] there just praying and praying and
[41:42] praying and the people next to me
[41:44] they're being prayed for and they're
[41:45] just they're just praising the Lord
[41:47] because God's answering their prayer and
[41:49] everybody in the congregation is singing
[41:50] victory is mine victory is mine and when
[41:53] you don't feel like you have Victory yet
[41:55] that is about the most Lonesome feeling
[41:58] in the
[42:00] world that's how I was and finally I
[42:02] just left the altar there and went back
[42:04] to my seat and I didn't know I I was
[42:07] praying asking God to to help me with my
[42:10] issue and nothing was happening and
[42:12] finally I got to a point I was miserable
[42:14] enough that I didn't care what somebody
[42:17] asked and I I approached brother Tim
[42:20] through it after brother Tim you have a
[42:22] few minutes I could talk to I've got
[42:23] some
[42:24] questions and now that's a beautiful
[42:27] thing because I struggled with my
[42:29] question long enough that I cared
[42:33] enough for the
[42:36] truth that's an important thing and it
[42:39] reminds me of a story of a man named
[42:42] Socrates from U ancient uh Greece some
[42:46] young uh some young uh young guy was
[42:50] came up to me asked hey could I be your
[42:52] could I be your student I'd really like
[42:53] to learn from you could I could I and
[42:55] Sak okay you want learn with me so he
[42:57] says sure so come
[42:59] ahead says come ahead so socres takes
[43:01] the guy and they go on the walk down to
[43:03] the center of the city you want to be my
[43:05] you want to be my student you want to
[43:06] learn of me that's fine and they finally
[43:08] they get seated here um by the fountain
[43:10] at the center of the city a Socrates
[43:13] then grabs the guy and puts his head in
[43:15] the fountain holds it there and holds it
[43:17] there long minute and the guy starts
[43:21] flailing he starts flailing he starts
[43:24] flailing till finally he throws Socrates
[43:28] office what are you trying to do to me
[43:31] and Socrates said when you care for
[43:34] answers the way you care for the air you
[43:37] breathe then you can be my
[43:40] student and that's not how Google treats
[43:44] you you can type I could have back then
[43:47] it wasn't so I don't even know if Google
[43:49] was invented back then I could have just
[43:52] typed my my my question online and could
[43:55] have got gotten the answer a couple
[43:57] seconds later and answer a couple
[44:00] seconds later but the virtue of having
[44:03] to wait months for that
[44:05] answer gave me a much higher care I
[44:10] cared about the answer because I had
[44:12] months of misery invested into actually
[44:15] seeking I mean Proverbs Chapter 2 if you
[44:18] seek after knowledge if you cry for
[44:21] understanding Google doesn't want you to
[44:23] cry for
[44:25] anything but God wants us to he he's
[44:28] willing to put us through hard times so
[44:31] that we care about this truth more than
[44:34] anything
[44:35] else that uh so I finally asked my
[44:37] question you know what brother Tim
[44:39] didn't
[44:40] say brother how long have you been in
[44:43] the message and you lack that Revelation
[44:46] he didn't talk down to me nothing at all
[44:47] he just opened the Bible and started
[44:50] going through things going through
[44:52] things and 20 minutes later we were we
[44:55] were done
[44:56] and I asked brother
[44:58] Tim I was praying at the altar where the
[45:02] Holy Spirit was moving why didn't God
[45:04] come and answer my question said well
[45:08] bud you have a Bible question you have a
[45:10] Bible answer and God answered my
[45:14] prayer he didn't answer it right there
[45:16] at the altar but he answered a little
[45:18] bit later and that was kind of the
[45:20] beginning for me where the message kind
[45:24] of making it my own you could read and
[45:26] and and and starting to see more and
[45:27] more of it so sometimes God will do
[45:31] things in a certain
[45:33] way he'll say things in a certain way
[45:35] that cause questions because he wants us
[45:38] to ask questions because when you start
[45:40] asking questions you're become
[45:42] personally invested and you'll and
[45:44] you'll remember it better
[45:47] thereafter however there are also other
[45:50] kinds of questions that um might not be
[45:54] quite so good
[45:56] let's
[45:58] um we'll skip this
[46:01] here look at this I didn't finish that
[46:03] from Exodus chapter 25 a good
[46:07] question the the so the children ask why
[46:09] are we doing this Dad gives the answer
[46:12] it's a sacrifice of the Lord Passover
[46:14] this is what God did for us and when a
[46:16] real question's answered like that it
[46:19] ends up the people bowing ahead and
[46:21] worshiping you get closer to God you
[46:23] remove those things that were keeping
[46:26] you from worshiping and and and you can
[46:28] enter in because those things will be
[46:29] taken care of that's that that's a
[46:31] really neat
[46:34] thing brother brandham at the start of a
[46:37] question answer service he says I'm not
[46:40] there yet he says these things are
[46:42] questions on the people's hearts and he
[46:44] wants to go over them because I trust
[46:46] it'll clear up our thoughts that we'll
[46:48] know what to do know how to live better
[46:51] after our questions are answered this
[46:54] sounds again like the spirit of the the
[46:55] visar want to clear up those things so
[46:58] we know what to do and how to live
[47:02] better that's an important thing but
[47:05] again the devil
[47:07] likes trying to bend those exclamation
[47:10] points into question marks and we just
[47:13] saw an example of questions that God
[47:17] intends for us to ask there are other
[47:19] kinds of questions that um we need to be
[47:23] aware of because they're not going to
[47:26] lead us to the Lord questions they're
[47:30] they're a nice uh nice argumentation
[47:33] tool or debating tool like I said they
[47:35] can be a way of showing off your
[47:36] knowledge but they can also be a way of
[47:39] downplaying the significance of truth
[47:41] without coming right out against
[47:44] it and that mean it can be kind of
[47:46] subtle because they don't really say
[47:49] anything but between the words they
[47:53] are and you can also uh um you're making
[47:56] someone who keeps asking questions in
[47:58] this way they're really not standing for
[48:00] anything they're just chipping away at
[48:02] that Foundation that you have so you
[48:04] really can't disagree with them because
[48:06] they're not saying anything they're just
[48:07] asking questions and these kinds of
[48:10] questions do you really think that's
[48:13] what God actually meant and what other
[48:16] ways could we understand this verse to
[48:18] be more in inclusive how do other people
[48:21] look at this these kinds of questions
[48:23] are more with the intent of taking those
[48:27] exclamation points of Truth hammering
[48:29] them down and erecting a question mark
[48:33] in their place and that is a spirit of
[48:37] the time that we live in just like that
[48:39] Catholic priest said certainty appears
[48:42] to be the problem and questions be the
[48:45] solution that's not the case we're not
[48:47] just meant to ask questions and never
[48:49] get answers we're not meant to go on the
[48:51] journey never get to the destination the
[48:53] destination matters too not just the
[48:54] journey
[48:58] we started with our men a visitar with a
[48:59] slide with this
[49:00] Compass anybody see an exclamation point
[49:03] on the
[49:05] compass you certainly do it's right
[49:08] there and when you're looking for truth
[49:12] you want a compass that's very certain
[49:14] you don't want to have a compass that is
[49:16] uh I don't know where do you want to go
[49:18] today I don't know where do you want to
[49:20] go today no you want a compass that
[49:22] tells you where North is even if it
[49:25] tells you you're wrong you've been going
[49:26] south and you've been telling your wife
[49:28] I know I'm going the right way what
[49:29] about the comp oh I'm wrong honey you
[49:31] want a compass that tells you the truth
[49:33] a compass has an exclamation point at
[49:36] the top of
[49:38] it now we said that um there's no such
[49:41] thing as a stupid
[49:43] question I will however want to talk for
[49:46] a few minutes about the kind of question
[49:48] that Paul talks about that he says you
[49:51] should avoid these kinds of
[49:53] questions and that is a
[49:56] foolish question because there are a lot
[49:59] of those out there today Paul says avoid
[50:03] foolish questions and that word foolish
[50:06] means impious or Godless a question that
[50:10] doesn't have God in it is probably a
[50:13] question meant to get you away from God
[50:17] but Paul tells Titus a young man avoid
[50:19] foolish questions avoid genealogies
[50:23] contentions strivings about the law for
[50:26] they are unprofitable and
[50:31] vain 1 Timothy 1:4 neither give heed to
[50:35] fables and endless genealogies which
[50:39] minister questions rather than Godly
[50:42] edifying which is in
[50:44] faith those questions that God kind of
[50:47] plants in our path like like he did for
[50:49] the uh people in the Passover the people
[50:52] as there when and Joshua crossed the
[50:54] Jordan River into the promise and he had
[50:56] the people build this uh altar of stones
[50:58] so that when they're young people their
[51:00] children ask what is this altar of
[51:02] stones here for they could give the
[51:03] answer those kinds of questions have God
[51:06] embedded in them so we can be brought
[51:09] back to God but questions that are this
[51:11] there to minister more questions to
[51:14] minister more questions Paul describes
[51:16] those as foolish
[51:19] questions the end of the're they're not
[51:21] edifying the end of the Commandment is
[51:23] Charity out of a pure heart and of a
[51:25] good good conscience of Faith unfeigned
[51:27] from which some having swerved aside un
[51:31] vain jangling vain jangling is just
[51:34] noise uncertain sounds not giving I mean
[51:37] a certain sound is when the the the
[51:39] bugler plays his Trump and go off to
[51:42] battle you want that bug to give a
[51:44] certain sound you know exactly what
[51:45] you're supposed to do but the little Vin
[51:48] jangle that's just
[51:49] distracting some have turned aside unto
[51:52] vain jangling Paul says Desiring to be
[51:54] teachers of the law
[51:56] understanding neither what they say nor
[51:58] whereof they affirm I think this is
[52:01] important here because it shows that
[52:02] there are people like to ask questions
[52:04] who don't even know what they stand for
[52:06] they're just asking questions but not
[52:08] really standing for anything
[52:11] themselves and um tell you when when you
[52:14] go through a time um of of of seeking
[52:17] when you're looking for truth and you're
[52:19] not and you're not sure and this is this
[52:21] is a similar time that I went through
[52:23] after my pastor of many many years left
[52:25] the message man now what do I do and I
[52:28] got to reading all kinds of things I I
[52:31] read everything that was out there
[52:33] against the message I read it I wasn't
[52:36] sure what what what what what am I going
[52:37] to do now I I I got into and there are a
[52:40] lot of I can look back now a lot of
[52:42] foolish questions there but
[52:46] um I can remember you can think if
[52:49] you're not certain about something if
[52:51] you're going through a math problem and
[52:52] say yeah 5x + 2 is
[52:56] 17 how do you solve it some people look
[52:58] at the X oh Lord there's an X in my math
[53:01] what am I supposed to do math is
[53:03] supposed to be numbers what am I
[53:04] supposed to do here and you can just get
[53:06] obsessed with what you don't know that's
[53:09] foolish you when you go about seeking
[53:12] look at what you do know well you know
[53:14] that two was added to the 5x so I'm
[53:17] going to take the two away then I got
[53:19] the 5x by itself I got and then I've got
[53:23] 15 / 5 x is going to be three how did I
[53:27] get there I was focusing on what I knew
[53:30] instead of what I don't know and the
[53:32] devil likes us with barrages with all
[53:35] kinds of questions and then we're not
[53:37] even sure we're not sure of anything
[53:39] anymore I can remember one time years
[53:41] ago I was at a camp under the family
[53:45] campus in Ohio and there was a Ministry
[53:46] just preached away and it was a it was a
[53:50] i it to me it was a deep sermon which
[53:52] meant I didn't understand very much of
[53:53] it at all and that at the end of the
[53:55] service at the end of the camp everybody
[53:57] was just rejoicing rejoicing
[54:00] rejoicing and I was confused I didn't I
[54:03] I didn't get much of anything and then
[54:05] again you feel so alone then everybody
[54:07] else was rejoicing you just like I
[54:08] didn't get a thing I you feel so bad
[54:10] back there but what helped me at that
[54:13] moment question came has God saved you
[54:18] yes God has saved me so I can I might
[54:22] not have understood 90% of that sermon
[54:24] but I knew that God saved me so I was
[54:26] already I could start injuring in and
[54:29] praising God for saving me because when
[54:31] we when when we feel I didn't get a
[54:32] thing I'm not a part of it the devil
[54:35] will start feeding that and is it true I
[54:37] didn't understand anything yes that is
[54:39] true the that is a fact and it's a true
[54:41] fact but the devil's going to put his
[54:43] interpretation to it you didn't
[54:45] understand it therefore there's not a
[54:47] receiver for truth inside of you
[54:49] therefore you this might not be a child
[54:51] of God and he's got this thought in
[54:54] there which is is a true thought I
[54:55] didn't understand much at all but he
[54:57] puts his interpretation on it and that
[55:00] gets you to start walking away from
[55:02] truth you're not even you're not even
[55:04] going to re praising God he can't take
[55:06] your salvation away from you but he
[55:09] practically did I wasn't even able to
[55:12] praise God for but you know what as soon
[55:13] as I started praising God thank you Lord
[55:15] yes you did save me thank you Lord for
[55:17] dying on the cross for me thank you Lord
[55:20] I appreciate thank you and before too
[55:22] long I was able to clap I was able sing
[55:25] and that Spirit just kind of
[55:28] lifted the devil tries to take away even
[55:31] that which we have don't let him do that
[55:34] so when you're confused you're not sure
[55:36] focus on what you do know and let God
[55:39] take care of what you don't know God
[55:41] will send an algebra teacher in your
[55:42] life and he'll take care of the x's and
[55:44] the
[55:45] Y's but foolish
[55:47] questions some characteristics of them
[55:50] foolish questions seek
[55:53] controversy not truth
[55:55] truth foolish questions they're just
[55:58] there to to stoke the fires keep things
[56:01] going and in my probably about year and
[56:05] a half two years I was I wasn't sure
[56:08] yeah I I wanted to believe the message
[56:11] but I just I I had all these questions
[56:13] barraging me I was and I was focusing on
[56:15] all those things but I finally I
[56:17] wondered and I've got a a file somewhere
[56:20] on my computer where I kind of dumped my
[56:22] thoughts I kind of thought would any
[56:24] answer be enough
[56:25] enough would any answer be enough and if
[56:27] it's a foolish question no there won't
[56:30] be any answer that would be enough you
[56:32] could come out and say this you could
[56:34] give every answer every single question
[56:36] they've asked so far it's hard to keep
[56:38] track of them because you start
[56:39] answering one line then something else
[56:40] comes up and something else comes up as
[56:42] soon as you start answering one line
[56:44] they really don't care about the answer
[56:46] they just want to keep on questioning
[56:48] would any answer ever be enough if it's
[56:50] not they're not really caring about
[56:52] truth they just want controversy foolish
[56:55] questions are not going to
[56:57] edify they're not going to promote
[57:00] godliness and foolish
[57:03] questions they're going to affirm
[57:05] nothing they're just going to be
[57:06] skeptical chipping away at the
[57:09] foundation that uh that that that that
[57:11] you're on and I can remember uh These
[57:14] Foolish questions they're not edifying
[57:16] they're not promoting godliness and that
[57:18] year and a half period whatever it was
[57:21] um I would get up in the morning and I
[57:24] used to have my daily devotions I'd get
[57:26] my Bible out and I I'd read but in that
[57:28] time period I didn't open my bible so
[57:31] much as I opened my computer and I read
[57:33] their website and I thought that I'm
[57:36] seeking God this way that's a foolish
[57:39] question because that's a foolish
[57:41] question it's not leading you to God
[57:43] it's leading you to another source
[57:45] besides the Bible that was a foolish
[57:48] question and it also times of prayer I
[57:52] wasn't really seeking God that way so
[57:54] much was again what's the next thing on
[57:56] the website what's the next video that's
[57:58] been posted what's the next thing and
[58:00] you
[58:01] just you're you're just driving yourself
[58:04] crazy in anxiety what's the next thing
[58:05] that's going to come out what's the next
[58:06] thing that's going to come out but it
[58:08] wasn't edifying it wasn't PR in
[58:10] godliness at all and one thing that kind
[58:14] of uh I finish this do a couple more
[58:17] scriptures here full of but foolish uned
[58:20] questions avoid knowing that they gender
[58:23] stries and the servant of the Lord must
[58:26] not
[58:28] strive the servant of the Lord isn't
[58:30] going to be a debater who's going to be
[58:33] there to win every single argument we're
[58:35] not here to win arguments we're here to
[58:36] win hearts and sometimes we put way too
[58:39] much too much to focus on being
[58:43] right we want to be shown to be right
[58:45] that's God doesn't care about being
[58:47] shown to be right it's more important to
[58:49] be right than to show yourself to be
[58:52] right the servant of the Lord must not
[58:54] not strive but be gentle unto all men
[58:57] apt to teach patient in meekness
[59:01] instructing those who depose themselves
[59:03] if God will peradventure give them
[59:05] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[59:07] truth and that they may recover
[59:11] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[59:14] who are taken captive by him at his will
[59:17] in this last scripture what is the snare
[59:20] of the devil These Foolish
[59:23] questions can a snare of the devil
[59:26] because foolish questions they are
[59:29] traps masquerading as questions because
[59:33] the devil's going to lay a trap out
[59:35] there and if you're a Trapper you're
[59:37] going to put your trap out there and you
[59:38] disguise it so the animal won't won't
[59:40] won't won't see it and there's nothing
[59:42] as innocent looking as a question
[59:44] because there's no such thing as a
[59:45] stupid question so you see this out
[59:47] there you an interesting question and
[59:49] you step right where the question mark
[59:50] is you're
[59:52] caught that's one of the characteris ICS
[59:54] of a foolish question it's a trap it's a
[59:57] snare of the devil and I got to thinking
[1:00:01] um there are These Foolish questions
[1:00:04] failure to discern what kind of a
[1:00:07] question it
[1:00:08] is that could end up pretty
[1:00:12] badly that's how it was in the Garden of
[1:00:14] Eden the Fallen Eden it all started with
[1:00:19] a
[1:00:21] question a question that was wasn't
[1:00:25] discerned to be a foolish question
[1:00:29] Genesis 3:1 the serpent was more subtle
[1:00:32] than any beast of the field which the
[1:00:33] Lord God had made and he said unto the
[1:00:35] woman yay hath God said You shall not
[1:00:38] eat of every tree of the
[1:00:42] garden doesn't sound like anything wrong
[1:00:44] there yeah God said it praise the Lord
[1:00:47] wow you could go multiple ways with that
[1:00:50] but what was the purpose of that
[1:00:53] question because a lot of times question
[1:00:54] questions going can be a smoke screen
[1:00:57] and what's behind the question that's
[1:00:58] what you really got to try to deserve
[1:01:00] not the question itself and that Eve
[1:01:03] didn't discern what kind of question it
[1:01:06] was this question this question wasn't
[1:01:09] posed to direct Eve to God but it was
[1:01:12] actually a snare to draw her away from
[1:01:15] God and when we're on a journey when
[1:01:18] we've got questions popping up we need a
[1:01:20] certain guide we need a guide with
[1:01:22] exclamation points of truth that we can
[1:01:24] follow and the devil wants to send us
[1:01:26] through life with a question mark on our
[1:01:29] Compass but God gives us exclamation
[1:01:32] points of Truth and unfortunately today
[1:01:35] many people don't mind having a question
[1:01:37] mark on their Compass because they get
[1:01:40] to choose the way for themselves but
[1:01:42] once you get to the destination all of a
[1:01:44] sudden then you care did did you get to
[1:01:46] the right one or not so handling foolish
[1:01:49] questions um the first thing is think
[1:01:53] that we can say we're not always
[1:01:55] obligated to
[1:01:57] answer Jesus was asked many
[1:02:01] questions and very rarely did he ever
[1:02:03] give an answer that was direct to the
[1:02:06] person's question Jesus would be ask a
[1:02:09] question he just might start telling a
[1:02:12] story it didn't seem to answer the
[1:02:14] question at all he's telling the story
[1:02:16] about a coin that got lost or about uh a
[1:02:20] son who uh who squandered his
[1:02:23] inheritance
[1:02:25] he was answering the question but not
[1:02:26] the way the questioner wanted it to be
[1:02:30] answered and um I think often about um
[1:02:34] about Stephen as well step's trial was
[1:02:38] kind of was pretty similar to the trial
[1:02:40] of
[1:02:42] Jesus it was a shame it was set up from
[1:02:45] the very beginning the people who were
[1:02:47] accusing stepen they'd already paid
[1:02:50] people to ask the questions they there
[1:02:54] were no sincere questions there at all
[1:02:57] they knew the answer that they wanted to
[1:02:58] get the the the end of it was already
[1:03:01] determined from the very beginning and
[1:03:04] it's interesting Stephen has asked this
[1:03:06] question in uh in Acts chapter 7 you
[1:03:09] don't have to turn there just want to
[1:03:10] see with how the uh question gets
[1:03:12] started and you kind of see the
[1:03:14] remarkable way that he answers
[1:03:16] it and um the high priest has has has
[1:03:20] accused him of speaking Blasphemous
[1:03:22] words against the holy place and against
[1:03:24] the law and as Steven's there the high
[1:03:26] priest waves his fingers are these
[1:03:28] things
[1:03:30] so and the way that I would have started
[1:03:34] ask answering that question I would have
[1:03:37] I would probably tend to respond
[1:03:38] directly to what the question was about
[1:03:41] what am I being accused of but I would
[1:03:43] have if I had done that I would have
[1:03:44] just be breathing Oxygen on on the fire
[1:03:47] and it would have ignited Steven doesn't
[1:03:49] do
[1:03:50] that Ste it's kind of like the like a
[1:03:53] traffic officer pulls somebody to the
[1:03:55] side and says do you realize how fast
[1:03:58] you were
[1:03:59] going and why were you doing this and
[1:04:02] then all of a sudden Stephen answers in
[1:04:05] the days of
[1:04:06] Abraham in the days of Isaac that's how
[1:04:09] Stephen answers the question he doesn't
[1:04:11] seem to answer the question at all but
[1:04:13] what he's doing he's answering the
[1:04:15] question behind the question because
[1:04:18] Stephen is showing you're putting me on
[1:04:20] trial just like your fathers killed
[1:04:23] prophets just like your your fathers
[1:04:24] killed this Prophet your father came
[1:04:26] against Moses he was answering the
[1:04:27] question but not the question they put
[1:04:29] into words but the question that was
[1:04:30] igniting their hearts and that's that
[1:04:33] takes a lot of wisdom because if we
[1:04:35] directly engage with the question
[1:04:37] sometimes we're just blowing blowing
[1:04:39] oxygen there on the fire it'll blow up
[1:04:41] on our face if they really want to seek
[1:04:43] truth let them seek truth if it might
[1:04:45] just be a foolish question but I love
[1:04:47] what brother brandom says about Stephen
[1:04:50] this in the message sudden secret going
[1:04:53] away of the church in every age God's
[1:04:55] had Thunderbolt prophets and signs and
[1:04:57] wonders to condemn the thing in the
[1:04:59] midst of all popularity and stand alone
[1:05:01] for God but not only that but what if I
[1:05:05] would speak of the time of little
[1:05:08] stepen we all like the the prophets the
[1:05:11] Thunderbolts and the signs and wonders
[1:05:13] and God has had those in every day but
[1:05:15] brother R says God didn't just have that
[1:05:18] not only that not a prophet not a pastor
[1:05:21] little Steven just a member of the body
[1:05:24] of Christ how this little fellow stood
[1:05:28] before the Sanhedrin Council that
[1:05:29] morning and spoke out to those who were
[1:05:31] condemning him you stiff necks Etc he
[1:05:34] wasn't a pastor you can't expect your
[1:05:36] pastor to do it all you can't expect
[1:05:38] your trustee board to do it all or your
[1:05:40] Deacon board you've got to make yourself
[1:05:42] ready it's an individual Affair and
[1:05:46] that's what God we want to want somebody
[1:05:49] else to come to answer the question
[1:05:50] handle things sometimes that God had
[1:05:52] little Steven he has us there here us
[1:05:54] here here as
[1:05:56] well so it's a it's a powerful thing to
[1:05:59] be able to discern um if it's a foolish
[1:06:03] question or not and I can remember when
[1:06:06] I was wrestling with my questions for
[1:06:08] that time period one thing that kind of
[1:06:11] struck me as not being quite right was a
[1:06:14] lot of times questions can be posed in a
[1:06:16] really scoffing manner where it's just
[1:06:19] kind of personal attacks character
[1:06:21] attacks against brother Brandon and
[1:06:23] highly dis respectful sometimes and I
[1:06:25] just thought a scripture came to mind
[1:06:28] and it's in the book of Jude chapter 9
[1:06:31] and it describes um a dispute that
[1:06:34] Michael the Archangel had with um with h
[1:06:38] the devil they were disputing about the
[1:06:40] body of Moses and it says Michael the
[1:06:43] Archangel when contending with the devil
[1:06:45] he disputed about the body of Moses but
[1:06:48] he did not dare to bring against him a
[1:06:50] railing slanderous accusation but he
[1:06:53] said the Lord rebuke you and I just
[1:06:55] thought man if Michael the Archangel
[1:06:58] would have that much respect for the
[1:07:01] devil not to just be a slanderous
[1:07:05] accusation he just said the Lord rebuke
[1:07:07] he he was respectful of his opponent you
[1:07:09] could say there how much more should we
[1:07:12] be respectful when we're having a
[1:07:14] conversation with fellow human beings
[1:07:16] made in the image of God and when I saw
[1:07:18] the the spirit of scoffing that was
[1:07:20] often upon the questions I would be
[1:07:22] reading and feeding upon I just this
[1:07:24] doesn't ring ring right and another
[1:07:28] thing that kind of helped me here um
[1:07:32] it's important that we we have a we have
[1:07:34] a principle in the Bible um when when
[1:07:37] John the Baptist came he came to make
[1:07:39] ready a people prepared for the Lord and
[1:07:41] when Christ Ministry came his disciples
[1:07:44] were kind of John the Baptist disciples
[1:07:45] were kind of concerned because we you're
[1:07:47] you're losing followers John this isn't
[1:07:50] what's supposed to happen is it and John
[1:07:52] said he must increase and I
[1:07:54] decrease that's the spiritual pattern
[1:07:58] God sends a prophet and he's supposed to
[1:08:00] have the attention for a time but at a
[1:08:02] certain point that decreases so we can
[1:08:05] have the our Focus increasing upon
[1:08:07] Christ that's the way it was with John
[1:08:09] and Jesus and that's the way it is now
[1:08:13] brother brandom's life story isn't our
[1:08:16] foundation that isn't our Focus if that
[1:08:18] was your foundation this is a great
[1:08:20] opportunity to actually look past his
[1:08:22] life story look at what he preached what
[1:08:24] he taught because that is what we can
[1:08:26] build ourselves on because he brought us
[1:08:28] back to a Bible foundation and Bible
[1:08:31] faith and the more that I spent time
[1:08:34] actually there a there was a a point I
[1:08:36] started what I want to go back and I'm
[1:08:38] just going to start listening to the
[1:08:39] messages
[1:08:41] 1947 I'm just going to start listening
[1:08:43] to may be having on my computer screen
[1:08:45] because some it's not really very uh you
[1:08:47] can't hear it real well but I just
[1:08:49] started listening listening I said I
[1:08:51] want to get to know this messenger for
[1:08:54] myself from the beginning so I did that
[1:08:56] I listened to those messages did for uh
[1:08:58] you can go through the first couple
[1:09:00] years pretty quickly because there's not
[1:09:02] a lot of them but you can just kind of
[1:09:03] get a feel and it's just the genuiness
[1:09:07] just Rings through Rings through I
[1:09:13] mean my
[1:09:14] goodness if somebody was trying to be a
[1:09:17] a fake or a fraud he's going to put his
[1:09:19] best foot
[1:09:20] forward but brother brandom never
[1:09:22] stopped singing he was a terrible singer
[1:09:25] and he just kind of sings
[1:09:27] away and I guess I'm I got to work on
[1:09:31] that my wife and son pointed out last
[1:09:34] church service at the end we started
[1:09:37] singing a song said honey they muted
[1:09:39] your mic really
[1:09:41] fast and job said yeah Dad you were
[1:09:44] really really off key but that didn't
[1:09:47] matter to brother Brandon he just sang
[1:09:49] he wasn't worried about coming across as
[1:09:51] polished or anything like that he just
[1:09:53] he was just who he was and that was and
[1:09:55] that was true um another thing that that
[1:09:59] really um that really got me I I read on
[1:10:02] a this is a website of a of a fellow
[1:10:05] young Minister friend I spent time with
[1:10:07] fellowship with and and you've probably
[1:10:09] had it too when someone who's a close
[1:10:11] friend leaves that hurts I I was reading
[1:10:15] his his his website one day and he got
[1:10:18] to writing about the Book of Malachi he
[1:10:20] said hold up the Book of Malachi Mal Mal
[1:10:24] isn't even written to the Gentiles
[1:10:26] Malachi is completely for the Jews so
[1:10:28] Malachi 4 couldn't apply to us because
[1:10:31] he says Malachi 1 verse1 says the burden
[1:10:33] of the word of the Lord to Israel by
[1:10:36] Malachi so if it's to Israel You're
[1:10:38] pulling all things out of context to say
[1:10:40] that Malachi 4 applies to the to the
[1:10:43] Gentiles that can't be right I read that
[1:10:45] hold up that can't be right either I got
[1:10:48] to looking at my scripture in Malachi
[1:10:51] 1:1 that's supposed to be just is Israel
[1:10:54] it says for the from the rising of the
[1:10:56] Sun to the going down of the same my
[1:10:58] name shall be great among the
[1:11:02] Gentiles I just thought
[1:11:04] man how trust how how trustworthy are
[1:11:09] these folks who I'm putting as my
[1:11:10] sources to lead me into truth if they're
[1:11:13] if they're we playing this fast and
[1:11:15] loose because this manner of Bible
[1:11:17] interpretation doesn't work because we
[1:11:19] just had Christmas guys Isaiah 7:14 says
[1:11:23] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[1:11:26] and you'll call his name Emanuel but
[1:11:28] Isaiah 1:1 says the vision of Isaiah the
[1:11:30] son of Amos which he saw concerning
[1:11:32] Judah and Jerusalem does that mean that
[1:11:35] the Messiah was just to them no it
[1:11:38] doesn't so I just those are just a
[1:11:40] couple of things that got to see now
[1:11:42] I've got to I've got to be grounded and
[1:11:44] settled looking not just at at what
[1:11:46] they're saying because these are foolish
[1:11:48] questions I had nothing good to show for
[1:11:51] my year and a half I was just being
[1:11:53] being exhausted looking at different
[1:11:55] YouTube film clips that was gradually
[1:11:57] going to be taking certainty away from
[1:11:59] every single area of faith I said I'm
[1:12:02] going to go back to what do I believe
[1:12:05] what do I believe and ground you look
[1:12:08] okay I believe yes I believe the Bible
[1:12:11] is God's word we're going to start there
[1:12:13] I believe I'm a sinner go on go on then
[1:12:17] I believe yeah baptism in Jesus's name
[1:12:21] that's there black and white you really
[1:12:22] can't I can't swallow a trinitarian god
[1:12:26] before long you start God started
[1:12:28] putting all the structure back in place
[1:12:30] and I left that time of questioning with
[1:12:32] a stronger Foundation than I had when I
[1:12:35] went into it but I can remember remember
[1:12:38] the how how important the narrative is I
[1:12:41] remember going through that time I
[1:12:42] thought man and you could see on this
[1:12:44] particular web page is are the names of
[1:12:46] all these former leaders of the message
[1:12:48] you've already left the message and you
[1:12:49] got this list list list list man
[1:12:52] goodness Lord
[1:12:54] I've got the virus too and there's only
[1:12:56] one way this story pans out once you've
[1:12:59] got it there's only one way and I'm on
[1:13:01] it seems like I'm on the way out but
[1:13:03] that's not the case the devil might tell
[1:13:05] you this is your narrative you're having
[1:13:08] these thoughts that means that you are
[1:13:09] this that's not the case at all you can
[1:13:11] be struggling with one thing or another
[1:13:13] but that doesn't that that does not
[1:13:15] determine who you are or where you're
[1:13:16] going to be go back and seek God cuz he
[1:13:19] will tell you who you are where you are
[1:13:22] and where you need to go those are some
[1:13:25] examples of foolish questions on kind of
[1:13:27] a a doctrinal level if I could call it
[1:13:30] that but um we kind of head on the home
[1:13:33] stretch I want to take a few minutes to
[1:13:35] talk about foolish questions that can
[1:13:38] also be on a personal level ah this is a
[1:13:42] didn't forgot this 2 Timothy 3:7 talk
[1:13:45] about people ever learning never able to
[1:13:46] come to the knowledge of the truth this
[1:13:49] is somebody who's asking questions
[1:13:51] learning one opinion another opinion
[1:13:53] another opin opinion they've heard lots
[1:13:54] of opinions they can explain all the
[1:13:56] narratives that are out there but the
[1:13:58] truth they don't have that and I don't
[1:14:01] care so much about explaining all the
[1:14:03] different narratives you care about one
[1:14:05] thing there's one pearl of great price
[1:14:07] you want to have the truth that's the
[1:14:08] most important
[1:14:10] thing but there are also foolish
[1:14:12] questions on a personal level I alluded
[1:14:15] to one just now there when I was at the
[1:14:18] uh at the end of a church service didn't
[1:14:20] understand a single thing and then you
[1:14:21] kind of leave the the idea of man you
[1:14:23] don't
[1:14:23] understand truth do you have a receiver
[1:14:25] of Truth could you be a Son of God and
[1:14:27] how the devil's putting those questions
[1:14:28] in your mind and leading you down a
[1:14:30] certain way of
[1:14:32] thinking when um we have to exercise
[1:14:37] discernment with questions the devil
[1:14:39] asks us during our trials and we might
[1:14:43] is the devil ask me this question or is
[1:14:45] it my question I don't care every
[1:14:47] question that comes up we want to go
[1:14:48] back and see is God in the question or
[1:14:50] not because a foolish question will be
[1:14:52] removing God we'll try to be removing
[1:14:55] God from our
[1:14:57] narrative but brother Bram talks about a
[1:15:00] time in his life he says that was the
[1:15:02] greatest trial that he'd ever faced and
[1:15:05] that was when his uh his wife had just
[1:15:08] passed away and his little baby Sharon
[1:15:11] Rose was uh was there in the uh there in
[1:15:15] another room in the basement she was
[1:15:17] just laid out with like a mosquito net
[1:15:19] over her and it says um this was the
[1:15:22] hardest Temptation I ever met in my life
[1:15:26] just about 25 years old his wife had
[1:15:29] just passed away and Billy Paul laying
[1:15:31] at the point of death he says I opened
[1:15:34] the door he wants to go visit his
[1:15:36] daughter no nurse was there he slips
[1:15:39] down into the basement and that was
[1:15:40] where the hospital was fixed up no
[1:15:43] screens on the Windows hardly flies on
[1:15:45] their little eyes their little piece of
[1:15:46] mosquito bar we call it netting put over
[1:15:48] her face and I shoed the Flies off laid
[1:15:52] there her little eyes she suffered so
[1:15:55] hard till they were
[1:15:57] crossing and he says then Satan moved up
[1:16:02] by the side of me there and
[1:16:05] said did you say he was a good
[1:16:11] God yeah I said
[1:16:14] that did you say he was a Healer well
[1:16:20] why did your father Die In Your Arms
[1:16:22] over there and you were calling calling
[1:16:25] and he's a sinner you were calling for
[1:16:26] his life why did your brother die in
[1:16:28] your other brother's arms out there and
[1:16:30] you standing in the Pulpit preaching a
[1:16:31] few weeks ago all the devil's doing is
[1:16:34] asking
[1:16:36] questions asking questions but can you
[1:16:38] see the devil's not really just asking a
[1:16:41] question he is suggesting something he's
[1:16:44] not going out and saying God doesn't
[1:16:45] love you God doesn't care for you he's
[1:16:46] not saying that he's just asking the
[1:16:48] question inviting brother random to go
[1:16:50] along this particular uh route of
[1:16:53] thinking he says then why didn't he
[1:16:55] answer you you said he loved you and
[1:16:57] saved you he couldn't tell me there was
[1:16:59] no God I'd already seen him but he was
[1:17:01] telling me he didn't care for me the
[1:17:04] devil told us that before if we had that
[1:17:07] question for man why I've been why am I
[1:17:10] still in this situation nothing seem to
[1:17:11] be changing my life does God even care
[1:17:13] about me that that that can hurt inside
[1:17:16] very very bad brother brandom had that
[1:17:20] but now your own wife there she is dead
[1:17:23] second day now and your little boy at
[1:17:24] the point of death Billy Paul just 18
[1:17:26] months old your little girl at 8 months
[1:17:29] old she's lying here dying with men in
[1:17:31] gidis and you just prayed and God pulled
[1:17:34] a sheet down and said shut up doesn't
[1:17:36] hear he won't hear you at all he's
[1:17:38] turned his back on you he's a good god
[1:17:40] huh he loves you huh all he's doing is
[1:17:44] asking
[1:17:46] questions and then brother brandom says
[1:17:48] everything he was telling me was the
[1:17:52] truth
[1:17:54] in the sense that everything the devil
[1:17:56] told him had happened it was
[1:17:59] factual but that's a difference facts
[1:18:03] are not truth the devil had thrown all
[1:18:07] the kinds of facts that brother brandom
[1:18:09] could not dispute all these facts did
[1:18:11] this happen yes did it happen yes did
[1:18:12] this happen yes did this happen and then
[1:18:14] the devil puts an interpretation to it
[1:18:17] and that was not
[1:18:20] true so facts are not truth and how
[1:18:23] often can that happen in our own lives
[1:18:26] where the devil tries to give us a
[1:18:28] narrative and so many events in the
[1:18:30] narrative can be factual and then he
[1:18:32] tries to put a spin on it that is not
[1:18:34] true at all and here's where we have to
[1:18:37] exercise discernment and bring every
[1:18:40] thought to The Obedience of Christ put
[1:18:43] Christ back into our story that's very
[1:18:49] important now most of the time we think
[1:18:52] that the problem problems that we have
[1:18:53] on our lives the way the situations that
[1:18:55] we're we're struggling with right now we
[1:18:57] look back why am I finding myself in
[1:18:59] this circumstance why am I here we go
[1:19:02] back and look ah it's because this
[1:19:04] happened to me when I was a kid that
[1:19:07] teacher he really messed me up with that
[1:19:10] class or this Uncle did this or we we go
[1:19:12] back and look at the thing that we say
[1:19:15] caused our problem so adversity we think
[1:19:18] the adversity is what brings the
[1:19:20] consequence directly to us
[1:19:23] we often think that events determine the
[1:19:26] consequences that we suffer but like
[1:19:29] every kindergarten will tell you you
[1:19:30] never go from a to c there's always one
[1:19:33] thing in between and that is a be the
[1:19:39] belief and this is the belief is like
[1:19:42] the narrative the belief that we adopt
[1:19:44] regarding our adversity there's
[1:19:46] something that comes between the
[1:19:48] difficulty we had and the situation we
[1:19:51] find yourself in now and and that is the
[1:19:53] belief that we adopt the narrative and a
[1:19:57] good true belief or a good true
[1:19:58] narrative will make you strong but bad
[1:20:01] and false beliefs are poison that slowly
[1:20:03] kill you and we have a
[1:20:07] choice what belief are we going to adopt
[1:20:11] about our situation because it's not
[1:20:15] everybody who grew up in a broken home
[1:20:17] ends up a drug
[1:20:19] addict not everybody who had the problem
[1:20:23] X happened to them ends up with
[1:20:25] consequence y there are lots of things
[1:20:28] that happen in between and the most
[1:20:29] important thing is what is the what is
[1:20:32] the belief that we adopt about it I can
[1:20:36] remember my my uh my my grandmother my
[1:20:39] dad's mom she uh she her um my my dad's
[1:20:42] younger brother he passed away in a
[1:20:44] tragic hunting accident when he was just
[1:20:46] like 15 years old or so like a year
[1:20:49] after that um my my grandma and grandpa
[1:20:52] they got divorced and it was a terrible
[1:20:55] time and a lot of people have that kind
[1:20:57] of adversity end up really really bad
[1:21:00] but that was a time that where my
[1:21:01] grandma she came to Faith and I I found
[1:21:04] her devotion book and she happiness is a
[1:21:07] choice Joy is a choice and you can see
[1:21:09] God you finally can you find God in your
[1:21:11] circumstance but here's what they um
[1:21:14] here's what people have read about this
[1:21:17] false beliefs are poison that slow they
[1:21:18] kill you when we accept these false
[1:21:20] beliefs to our questions about our
[1:21:22] trials and suffering our suffering
[1:21:26] multiplies exponentially on an emotional
[1:21:29] level and doctors acknowledge that
[1:21:32] emotional pain can be the worst kind of
[1:21:35] personal suffering so it's not just
[1:21:37] somebody's sick in the hospital not well
[1:21:40] but when they think oh my family doesn't
[1:21:42] care about me God doesn't care about me
[1:21:44] that thought God doesn't care about me
[1:21:46] that causes even more
[1:21:48] pain than actual physical pain symptoms
[1:21:51] that you might have
[1:21:54] and a lot of physical pain can be rooted
[1:21:55] in internal emotional factors he says
[1:21:58] between 75 and 90% of all illnesses can
[1:22:01] be traced back to our body's response to
[1:22:05] stress and this author says the majority
[1:22:07] of emotional pain arises from mistaken
[1:22:11] or irrational beliefs that we hold
[1:22:13] regarding to what happens to
[1:22:16] us by taking a wrong narrative that the
[1:22:19] devil gives to us like I was there at
[1:22:21] the end of that church service thinking
[1:22:23] God I I didn't get a thing about it I
[1:22:27] must not even have a receiver from truth
[1:22:29] am I even a child of God then the pain
[1:22:30] starts on the inside the pain and if you
[1:22:33] were to continue to go along that way
[1:22:36] you get yourself anxious into depression
[1:22:38] all kind of things just snowballing all
[1:22:40] because you adopted the devil's thought
[1:22:44] it's so important to be like the
[1:22:45] Children of isachar Men of understanding
[1:22:47] who know the times we live in who look
[1:22:49] for the exclamation points of Truth
[1:22:51] follow those Embrace those have
[1:22:54] discernments for what kinds of questions
[1:22:56] that we have I want to show us one thing
[1:23:00] and then will'll be closed how important
[1:23:03] it is with what we identify with and we
[1:23:05] want to queue up that little video clip
[1:23:07] if we could I want to show a short video
[1:23:09] clip from uh uh service that brother
[1:23:12] Brandon preached in Chicago and how
[1:23:15] important it is to take every thought
[1:23:18] and how easy it is those thoughts that
[1:23:20] we get if we identify with those
[1:23:22] thoughts and their wrong thoughts the
[1:23:25] the the power it has to do great great
[1:23:28] harm and then what we do with those
[1:23:31] thoughts we could just pull that video
[1:23:32] clip Up and then we'll uh we'll finish
[1:23:34] up from
[1:23:46] there now we are be strangers I see that
[1:23:48] you are strictly stranger to
[1:23:51] me you're from away from here you come
[1:23:54] from another
[1:23:56] city You' got a lot of trouble on your
[1:23:59] heart you got hard trouble to begin with
[1:24:02] is that right there's a whole black I
[1:24:05] see a black sheep keep following me like
[1:24:07] that or
[1:24:10] aive and that was a man confess I need
[1:24:14] he said you a wi is that true and you
[1:24:18] got a your church or something your p
[1:24:22] got F that
[1:24:25] right don't pay people tell you and the
[1:24:29] only your
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:41] heart stop right there what was it that
[1:24:44] was causing that lady's
[1:24:47] trouble she believed the devil's
[1:24:50] lie and what kind of Lies is the devil
[1:24:52] trying to tell about us today musicians
[1:24:54] can come with Paul and ready what kind
[1:24:56] of Lies is the devil trying to tell us
[1:24:57] about today if we identify with those
[1:25:00] lies she started to identify with this
[1:25:03] lie am I a witch am I a witch and her
[1:25:06] that was driving her body nuts her heart
[1:25:08] trouble anxiety all these different
[1:25:10] things what kinds of Li the devil could
[1:25:13] we be identifying with
[1:25:14] today don't believe them put those to
[1:25:17] the side don't believe your own don't
[1:25:19] believe your feelings about yourself
[1:25:21] believe God's word about yourself that's
[1:25:24] how we handle foolish questions that's
[1:25:26] how we handle these things take them to
[1:25:28] God is God in this question or not if
[1:25:31] he's not I don't want to have any part
[1:25:32] of it I don't want to believe the
[1:25:34] devil's thought about me that make sense
[1:25:37] just let's
[1:25:39] pray heavenly father I thank you for
[1:25:42] your goodness and your grace to us Lord
[1:25:43] I Thank you for this Lord the small
[1:25:45] scripture from the book of Chronicles
[1:25:48] about the men of isachar such unique men
[1:25:50] Lord they seem not to offer very much
[1:25:52] just 200 men not noted for their uh
[1:25:55] battle worthiness or their swords or
[1:25:57] their Spears or their Shields but uh
[1:26:00] it's more important to be on the right
[1:26:02] side than how we're equipped Lord they
[1:26:05] were equipped in a special way though
[1:26:06] they had that discernment able to
[1:26:08] discern the spirit of the time that they
[1:26:10] lived in that they would know how to
[1:26:11] live in that age I pray Lord you would
[1:26:13] help us also give us good discernment to
[1:26:16] know what are the conditions the time
[1:26:18] that we're living in so that we could
[1:26:19] live for you today Lord I pray that you
[1:26:22] would be with each young person whatever
[1:26:24] questions they might be wrestling with
[1:26:26] whatever they might be working through
[1:26:28] Lord I pray that you would be with them
[1:26:29] come alongside them and lead them I pray
[1:26:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:34] amen God bless you thank you brother I
[1:26:37] appreciate
[1:26:47] that turn his mic off we're going to
[1:26:51] sing
[1:26:53] I really enjoyed the word really enjoyed
[1:26:55] the word this morning and um I believe
[1:26:58] that there's an army rising up amongst
[1:27:01] the young people I believe there's a new
[1:27:03] generation that are that children of
[1:27:06] issachar and they're not gullible
[1:27:09] they're not just swallowing everything
[1:27:12] that they read They're not taking all
[1:27:14] the devil's foolish questions and being
[1:27:17] troubled by it but they're they're
[1:27:18] seeking truth and they're willing to
[1:27:21] wait till God lands a revelation in
[1:27:23] their heart and there's an army rising
[1:27:25] up that way and you don't want to be a
[1:27:28] part of generation of young people
[1:27:29] sitting even in a message church and and
[1:27:32] uh just being led by lust or something
[1:27:35] or forming a marriage based upon lust
[1:27:38] you don't want that there's a young
[1:27:39] people that say no I don't I don't want
[1:27:41] that the rest of the world has that I
[1:27:43] want my marriage and my future and
[1:27:45] everything to be based upon the truth of
[1:27:48] God's word or revelation of God's word
[1:27:50] and I don't want to be numb and and
[1:27:52] numbed in my mind so much that I'm not
[1:27:55] open to receiving because that's what
[1:27:57] all the world's knowledge and questions
[1:27:59] out there that's what it makes us just
[1:28:00] makes us numb to really finding truth
[1:28:02] but there is a children of isachar
[1:28:04] that's seeking and living understanding
[1:28:08] their times navigating through it
[1:28:10] through the revelation of the word he's
[1:28:12] given us and put in our hearts we're
[1:28:14] going to make it through he wouldn't
[1:28:16] have said in Leota to him that
[1:28:17] overcometh unless he'd have some
[1:28:19] Overcomers to this leoan age and I
[1:28:22] believe uh we're speaking to a lot of
[1:28:24] that generation here this morning
[1:28:26] brother brem says each generation has
[1:28:28] its own Revival in the word of God and
[1:28:31] uh so I believe that God if you notice a
[1:28:33] lady that's always been a important part
[1:28:36] of that video that that rap show that
[1:28:38] part was so important when he she was
[1:28:40] told that and we would say it was by the
[1:28:42] devil but remember it came through a
[1:28:44] healing evangelist that actually told
[1:28:46] her that and that can be more troubling
[1:28:48] sometimes because it comes through a
[1:28:49] source that comes out of the church and
[1:28:52] so that's how much in this deceiving age
[1:28:54] we have to navigate and get to the truth
[1:28:56] because sometimes lies can come through
[1:28:58] a lot of different sources and we have
[1:29:00] to seek is this truth and I love it as
[1:29:03] how he prays for her he just lays his
[1:29:05] hands on her and just sends her off and
[1:29:07] if you kept it got kind of loud with the
[1:29:09] Clapping of the audience but he looks at
[1:29:11] her as she's going by and said you're
[1:29:13] not a
[1:29:14] witch must have been comforting to hear
[1:29:16] the truth somebody said that about you
[1:29:19] but you're not a witch you're having
[1:29:20] nervous problems and you're having
[1:29:22] troubles but what the devil said about
[1:29:24] you is not
[1:29:26] true amen praise the Lord let's stand
[1:29:29] there's an army rising up I believe it
[1:29:31] with all my heart so remember now as we
[1:29:34] as we get finished here that we will
