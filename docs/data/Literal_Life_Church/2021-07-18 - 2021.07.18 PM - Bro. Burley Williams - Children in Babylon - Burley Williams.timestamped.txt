[0:01] i would like to invite you to turn you
[0:03] to the book of daniel chapter one
[0:14] daniel chapter one
[0:29] let's start at verse 1.
[0:33] in the third year of the ring of jihad
[0:35] kim
[0:36] the king of judah came nebuchadnezzar
[0:40] king of babylon unto jerusalem and
[0:44] besieged it
[0:46] and the lord gave jihad came king of
[0:48] judah to his hand
[0:50] with part of the vessels of the house of
[0:53] god
[0:54] which he carried into the land of china
[0:57] to the house
[0:58] of his god and he brought the vessels
[1:02] into the treasure house of his god
[1:07] verse three and the king spake unto
[1:10] aspinas the master of his units that it
[1:13] should bring certain
[1:15] of the children of israel another king
[1:18] seed
[1:19] in other provinces verse 4
[1:22] children in whom no blemish but well's
[1:26] favored
[1:27] and skillful in all wisdom cunningly
[1:30] knowledge
[1:31] and understanding signs such as the
[1:34] ability in them to stand in the king
[1:36] palace
[1:37] and whom they might teach the learning
[1:40] of the tongue of the chaldeans
[1:44] and the king appointed them a day the
[1:45] provision of the king's meat
[1:47] you know the wine which he drank so
[1:50] nourishing them three years
[1:52] that at the end there are they might
[1:54] stand before the king
[1:56] verse six now among these were the
[1:59] children of judah
[2:00] daniel hananiah michelle
[2:03] and azariah until whom the prince of the
[2:07] unit gave names
[2:09] for he gave her to daniel the name of
[2:11] belter shazer
[2:12] and to hananiah shadrach and to michelle
[2:16] meshach and azariah of bendigo
[2:19] you may be seated i'm gonna go ahead and
[2:22] read verse eight
[2:23] to ten but daniel purpose in his heart
[2:26] that he would not defile himself with
[2:28] the portion of the king's meat
[2:30] nor with the wine which he drank
[2:33] therefore he requested of the prince of
[2:35] the eunuchs
[2:36] that he might define himself might not
[2:38] defile himself
[2:40] now god had brought daniel into favor
[2:43] and tender love
[2:44] with the princess of the eunuchs and the
[2:48] prince of the unit said that to daniel i
[2:50] fear my lord the king
[2:51] who has pointed your meat in your drink
[2:54] for why should
[2:56] he see your faces worse like than the
[2:59] children
[3:00] which are of your sword then
[3:03] shall you make me endanger my head to
[3:06] the kingdom
[3:08] praise the lord god bless you
[3:12] the lord will just help us for a few
[3:14] minutes
[3:16] uh it's a sermon i preached on before
[3:19] and it just kind of come back in my
[3:20] heart and i want to
[3:22] title this children children in babylon
[3:28] children in babylon
[3:31] you know it's amazing sometimes when you
[3:33] read the book of daniel
[3:37] when you're thinking about daniel you
[3:39] think about an old man
[3:42] daniel the wise old daniel
[3:45] your mind kind of goes there but
[3:48] actually we find here in the scripture
[3:51] that daniel was children when they first
[3:54] went there
[3:55] they were not men they were children
[3:59] and we see here uh the prophet of god
[4:03] says in the message gabriel instructions
[4:05] to daniel
[4:06] and i just want y'all to just listen to
[4:08] this he's i want you to notice how
[4:10] daniel
[4:11] yet an alien yet boosted from his people
[4:16] boosted from his church without one
[4:18] church service
[4:20] without any church to go to without
[4:23] any hymns to be sane but what he's
[4:26] saying himself
[4:29] in the midst of all of this still hold
[4:32] on to
[4:33] what the prophet said
[4:36] amen so now you see daniel
[4:40] which he's as you read on down in this
[4:42] quote
[4:43] he began to talk about how daniel was
[4:45] probably around the age i believe 12 and
[4:47] 14.
[4:49] let's think about that how many 12 year
[4:51] olds we got here
[4:53] 12 11
[4:57] 13 14
[5:02] 15 16
[5:06] 17 18.
[5:11] it's good for you anyway
[5:15] but one thing about it for certain we
[5:18] can
[5:19] go back and think about the times when
[5:22] we was that age
[5:25] amen so i want to just try to paint a
[5:29] picture
[5:31] and pray that it will help you and one
[5:34] thing i want you to know
[5:37] you are those special children like it
[5:40] was in daniel times
[5:42] you are now those special children
[5:45] you have to understand the context of
[5:46] the scripture
[5:48] when they brought down them to captivity
[5:51] they wasn't
[5:52] looking for all of the children of
[5:54] children israel
[5:56] it was certain ones that they were
[5:59] looking for
[6:00] certain ones that's the only thing on
[6:02] their mind ones that got
[6:05] got wisdom skill understanding
[6:08] this is the one we want but what was the
[6:11] purpose for
[6:12] to use the gift that god already given
[6:16] them but they wanted to domesticate them
[6:19] to babylonian thinking so that they can
[6:22] teach the babylonians
[6:23] so in other words they want to take what
[6:25] god already let them be born with
[6:28] take it and pervert it for the use of
[6:30] babylon
[6:32] the devil is no different today he want
[6:34] to take the gifts in your lives
[6:36] young people in his mercy he want to
[6:38] take it he want to get you to fall
[6:40] so he can take them gifts and go use
[6:42] them for his purpose
[6:44] and babylon represents the world
[6:47] can we say amen let me tell you
[6:49] something brother and sister
[6:52] you are special children that don't mean
[6:55] you get special treatment
[6:58] you are special children but you get the
[6:59] same treatment as anybody else because
[7:01] the word corrects us all
[7:04] but i'm just trying to help by the help
[7:06] of the holy spirit and show you
[7:08] what you are in god's sight the devil is
[7:12] not interested in
[7:14] denomination it don't matter to him he
[7:17] already got him
[7:18] they belong to him according to the
[7:20] scripture the
[7:21] of the mother of the harlots and she got
[7:23] harlots he owns
[7:24] all of them but it's this message what
[7:28] the devil
[7:29] is attacking amen
[7:32] praise the lord he don't attack the
[7:33] baptist and the methodist no it's
[7:35] the message believers is what he attacks
[7:40] because he wants you amen see
[7:43] well you have to understand uh yeah
[7:46] all children in the world yeah all them
[7:48] got the devil attacks everybody
[7:50] but he got a special taste for you
[7:54] a special taste because he wants to uh
[7:58] use you to build his kingdom for his
[8:01] glory that's what the devil wants
[8:03] but i'm so thankful that god got
[8:05] firefold ministry today that's going to
[8:07] keep
[8:08] standing right on the forefront letting
[8:09] young people know you can live this
[8:12] gospel
[8:14] you can overcome this world and you
[8:16] can't you don't have to walk around
[8:17] being beat down by the devil you can be
[8:19] free
[8:20] this message is about freedom it's not
[8:23] about bondage
[8:24] if you look at the messages do's and
[8:26] don'ts you'll never get nowhere
[8:29] this message is life this can anybody
[8:32] show me
[8:33] one quote one scripture
[8:37] will god want you to be in bondage
[8:41] just one where he wants you to be in
[8:44] bondage you won't find it
[8:46] because god don't want you to be
[8:47] abundant this message comes to set you
[8:49] free
[8:50] now people want to keep you in bondage
[8:51] the devil want to keep you in bondage
[8:54] but god wants you to be free
[8:57] now in this story here we're going to
[8:58] have to go a little background
[9:00] to try to work it up with children in
[9:03] babylon
[9:04] we find out in verse 1 the children of
[9:07] israel
[9:08] is going into captivity because they
[9:10] rejected the prophet jeremiah
[9:13] god kept warning them over and over and
[9:16] over
[9:17] not to do certain things but they
[9:18] wouldn't listen to jeremiah
[9:20] and then eventually why did they ended
[9:23] up down there in bondage
[9:25] can we say amen see rejecting the word
[9:29] was what put you in bondage you see a
[9:32] lot of times
[9:32] we ain't careful we're going to say
[9:34] reject the prophet put you in bondage
[9:36] no that's incorrect rejecting the word
[9:39] put you in bondage
[9:41] because god makes it very plain even
[9:43] with samuel he said samuel they didn't
[9:45] reject you
[9:47] they have rejected me can we say man
[9:51] you see brothers and sisters i love this
[9:53] message with all of my heart
[9:55] i live and die for it i really do
[9:58] because it's the truth
[9:59] but i do want to explain something to
[10:01] you you definitely got to have a balance
[10:03] in your life
[10:04] what a messenger is who god is
[10:08] i'm not here to try to prove to you
[10:10] brother branham was a prophet
[10:12] that's not my ministry to prove to you
[10:14] brother madam is a prophet
[10:15] that something had to be revealed to you
[10:17] by god
[10:19] can we say amen you know i find amongst
[10:22] young people
[10:23] they actually get mad at brother branham
[10:27] and don't even understand why they mad
[10:28] at him
[10:32] that's right he said oh
[10:35] not me all right i'll give you the
[10:37] symptoms of people that don't got mad at
[10:38] the prophet
[10:40] when you ask somebody a question then
[10:42] they give you the answer
[10:43] and then you say did brother brother say
[10:46] that or is that in the bible
[10:52] that's the proof you got an attitude
[10:54] against a prophet
[11:00] see what doesn't happen in your thinking
[11:04] as you grow up in the message you'll
[11:07] hear a brother better say it but abandon
[11:09] shape but abandon shade what about it
[11:10] but about him said you hear it all the
[11:12] time
[11:14] so now you're going to judge everything
[11:15] what did he say i did the bible
[11:17] i'm just going to tell you something
[11:18] friends on my stand as a minister
[11:22] when i say the prophet said oh i say
[11:24] brother madam said
[11:26] only thing i'm saying this is what god
[11:28] said through his prophet
[11:33] that's what i'm saying but you got some
[11:36] ministers
[11:37] is this a lie well they hear they hear
[11:41] don't i stand on what i say but you got
[11:43] some ministers
[11:45] can't preach without saying
[11:53] we're here to lead you to jesus christ
[11:55] not to brother branham
[11:59] brother branham is god's ordained
[12:01] messenger
[12:03] can we say amen but he led us to worship
[12:06] god
[12:09] huh he's a type of eliezer
[12:14] at asia when he got isaac a bride god
[12:16] son of a prophet to go get him a bride
[12:18] now you know what how many of you
[12:19] believe that uh eliezer and rebecca i
[12:22] mean
[12:23] isaac and rebecca appreciated eliezer
[12:28] how many of you believe that i wonder
[12:30] why they didn't name one of their
[12:31] children earlier
[12:34] but yet they appreciated him so much
[12:38] i know people name their children
[12:39] william brown because you name your
[12:41] child william branham that don't mean
[12:42] your child going to heaven
[12:47] but this message is true
[12:52] amen and i'm gonna tell you if you got
[12:54] any questions
[12:56] about the message the best way to get
[12:58] your answer
[12:59] is keep the right spirit
[13:03] because we're in a time now people ask
[13:05] you a question hoping you can't answer
[13:07] them
[13:09] if somebody asks you a question with the
[13:10] wrong spirit you can't give them an
[13:12] answer
[13:13] because they're approaching you the
[13:14] wrong way but if you got the right
[13:17] spirit
[13:18] the answer is there
[13:21] i promise you that can we say praise the
[13:23] lord
[13:24] so what's happening today we see that
[13:28] here in the bible oh i know so i'm going
[13:31] to call me
[13:31] for you against the prophet have i said
[13:33] anything against brother branham
[13:37] no but the way mine's been programmed
[13:40] now
[13:42] see because so many people leaving the
[13:44] message now
[13:45] everybody walking on eggshells
[13:48] don't say that about the prophet that's
[13:50] nonsense because
[13:52] people that are mature in balance in
[13:53] their life they have a balance they know
[13:55] what's being said they know what to say
[13:57] when that not what not to say
[14:00] can we say praise the lord if brother
[14:02] brandon was sitting right there in that
[14:03] chair i'll say the same thing and i
[14:05] believe brother brown would say amen
[14:08] because he led us to jesus christ
[14:13] let me tell you something young people
[14:14] there's three types of people around
[14:15] this message
[14:18] there's a group of people that have made
[14:21] brother branham
[14:22] more than what he was there's a group of
[14:26] people
[14:26] have taken away what he was
[14:30] but there's a bride know exactly where
[14:32] he was
[14:35] the ones that makes him more than what
[14:37] he was that's when all these strange
[14:38] doctrines come from
[14:40] deity doctrines and all these things and
[14:43] then the ones that take away from where
[14:44] he was they always want to find and
[14:46] preach his mistakes
[14:48] his faults and his errors but the brides
[14:51] say
[14:52] elijah a man of light
[14:55] precious passions
[14:58] knowing he was a man just like you and i
[15:02] brother brandon mr is the most humblest
[15:04] man that i know to have such a prophetic
[15:07] ministry but would get up in the pulpit
[15:09] and admit when he said something wrong
[15:13] now how many of you got to do that
[15:17] but he did it he would admit i was wrong
[15:21] to me that's the spirit of christ
[15:24] praise the lord but i encourage every
[15:26] one of you lay in this message
[15:29] dig in it pray just lay in it amen
[15:33] how do you know what a preacher telling
[15:34] you the truth you ain't studying it
[15:37] you have this message designed you have
[15:40] to study it yourself
[15:43] not just when you come to church and
[15:44] hear the pastor preach you yourself
[15:46] got to be at home dedicate yourself i
[15:49] mean
[15:50] discipline yourself to study this
[15:52] message
[15:55] it's exactly right mom and dad can't
[15:57] give it to you you got to get it
[15:58] yourself
[15:59] the bible says seek your own soul
[16:00] salvation with fear and trembling
[16:03] just the way it has to be but i'ma tell
[16:06] you this is the greatest
[16:07] this message is not a move
[16:11] it's a restoration to take us back to
[16:14] what the original is
[16:16] can we say praise the lord to show us
[16:19] that we are sons and daughters of god
[16:21] not bound by any man thoughts or any man
[16:23] creeds of doctrine
[16:24] we're supposed to be set free amen
[16:28] i love it when i can see young people
[16:31] grab
[16:31] a hold of a true revelation get a true
[16:33] experience in their life
[16:35] and take this message and get go with it
[16:37] i love it
[16:38] it goes to prove that you don't have to
[16:40] be old to be in the message
[16:42] you don't have to wait till you get old
[16:44] to receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:46] you can be six years old five years old
[16:48] you can receive the baptism of the holy
[16:50] ghost
[16:52] some people say well i've been trying to
[16:54] get the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:55] it just ain't happening just to help i'm
[16:57] gonna tell you why it's not happening
[16:58] because you're not ready to die
[17:02] the more hungry you fall the quicker
[17:04] you'll get it
[17:05] when you're ready to die from your
[17:07] thoughts and your way to god i want you
[17:09] i gotta help you i'm gonna die you ready
[17:11] for it then
[17:13] but you're gonna say well i guess i'll
[17:15] try to get it
[17:16] forget it ain't gonna happen you gotta
[17:19] want it
[17:21] thirsty for it hungry for it if you
[17:23] don't have it you gotta want it
[17:25] amen and if that thirst is there it's
[17:27] simply because it's god
[17:29] pulling you the prophet god said why do
[17:30] you hunger why do you thirst he said it
[17:33] is the holy spirit
[17:34] pulling you but the devil got so many
[17:38] things out there trying to get you to
[17:40] quench your thirst
[17:41] with worlyism things of this world and
[17:44] friends and stuff like that
[17:45] them the things you got to get away from
[17:46] you because i'm going to tell you right
[17:48] now
[17:49] when god calls you the first thing he
[17:52] calls you for
[17:53] is separation total separation
[17:57] from all unbelief because what god does
[18:01] when he first calls you he wants to
[18:02] separate you to himself
[18:04] so he can strengthen you get you where
[18:08] he wants
[18:08] you to be then he'll send you back
[18:12] he'll send you back to go to people that
[18:15] that you didn't care for and that got on
[18:17] your nerve was a bad influence on you
[18:19] when god strengthened you he'll send you
[18:21] back to them because now they can't no
[18:23] longer influence you but now you can
[18:24] influence them
[18:28] that's exactly right but you yourself
[18:30] need to be strengthened
[18:33] i'm sure that we're on different stages
[18:35] in here some born again some may not be
[18:37] born again
[18:38] some are in different transitions in
[18:40] life i'm aware of all of those things
[18:43] i'm speaking in general so whatever
[18:45] category
[18:46] fits you you just take that say thank
[18:48] you lord amen
[18:50] but i'm so interested here with the
[18:53] children of israel
[18:55] they carried them uh from babylon
[18:58] i mean from jerusalem to babylon
[19:01] jeremiah told them
[19:03] year after year this is what's going to
[19:04] happen to them
[19:06] and as far as they know yeah yeah yeah
[19:08] they go that jeremiah again prophesying
[19:10] and
[19:10] yeah yeah yeah but you know finally
[19:15] that day came
[19:18] nebuchadnezzar and his crew coming down
[19:20] to jerusalem
[19:22] just wrecking the place i want you to
[19:25] think about this
[19:26] uh just a little drama daniel
[19:30] him in the house all of a sudden
[19:34] uh they hear it they see a dust storms
[19:37] because you know in the bible when an
[19:38] army moves it's just like a bunch of
[19:40] sand
[19:41] so they know it's an army coming and all
[19:44] of a sudden they hear rumbling
[19:46] and then you're looking around what was
[19:48] going on he goes no he's out
[19:50] just put it like daniel outside playing
[19:52] he see this dust storm coming up
[19:55] what's going on dude he runs in the
[19:56] house mama daddy something is not right
[20:00] and mom and daddy looks out saying oh
[20:05] this is what jeremiah was talking about
[20:08] come on come on in the house dan come on
[20:09] now
[20:10] dave what's going on mama just just come
[20:11] into the house
[20:13] come into the house and now just think
[20:17] of all of that screaming taking place
[20:20] people being taken out of their house
[20:22] taken out of their homes
[20:23] and nothing they can do you go read the
[20:27] book of jeremiah
[20:29] jeremiah god let the children of israel
[20:32] know
[20:33] that when the enemy comes don't even try
[20:36] to fight them
[20:37] because your weapons won't work go back
[20:40] and read jeremiah i think it's jeremiah
[20:41] hey he said
[20:42] god said ain't gonna do you know he said
[20:44] your armory ain't even gonna work
[20:47] because god controls those things he let
[20:49] them know and he's going to work for you
[20:51] because
[20:52] i tried to fight for you i tried to keep
[20:54] you in the right path
[20:55] but you are the one that rejected my
[20:57] word now you got answer for it so don't
[20:59] even try to fight
[21:02] mean you don't read the book of jeremiah
[21:05] i'm going to tell you one one amazing
[21:07] scripture in the book of jeremiah
[21:09] when you get up to i can't remember what
[21:11] chapter it is when
[21:13] jeremiah was in jail he and they was in
[21:16] captivity
[21:17] jeremiah sent a letter to him
[21:20] and that letter that he sent to them
[21:23] there was no doubt there was already a
[21:25] captivity wanting comfort
[21:27] wanting to be comforted but then
[21:29] jeremiah sent a letter
[21:31] i can say the children of israel oh
[21:33] jeremiah sent a letter
[21:34] oh he's going to let us know it won't be
[21:36] long we're going to be getting out of
[21:37] here but god said 70 years he ain't
[21:38] going to change
[21:41] but in the condition that they was in in
[21:43] bondage when he something in the letter
[21:45] when they began to read it the letter
[21:47] says
[21:49] build houses
[21:53] plant vineyards have children
[21:57] what build houses print when we're in
[22:00] babylon
[22:01] but god said no that's what i want you
[22:04] to do
[22:05] and then after all of that then pray for
[22:08] the ones that got you in captivity
[22:13] no encouragement is in debt
[22:16] but that was the letter of encouragement
[22:19] because god said you're so depressed now
[22:22] to where you're going to walk around
[22:23] don't want to do nothing and just don't
[22:25] want to do nothing
[22:26] he said he said if you do that then when
[22:29] 70 years is up i ain't going to have
[22:31] nobody to bring out of them
[22:34] so keep going he said if you want peace
[22:37] get along with them
[22:38] pray for them he said but i'm giving you
[22:40] an expected end
[22:42] that you won't be there him always i'm
[22:44] going to pull you out
[22:45] but you got to keep going on you see
[22:47] when you're going through something in
[22:49] life
[22:49] as a young person getting depressed the
[22:52] first thing you want to do is sleep it
[22:53] away
[22:55] sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep
[22:58] sleep you know what when you got
[23:00] problems
[23:02] and you go to sleep and when you wake up
[23:05] you know who's looking at you when you
[23:06] wake up that same problem you went to
[23:09] sleep with
[23:11] god has not called us to run from things
[23:14] he called us to deal with it
[23:16] overcome it can we say praise the lord
[23:19] you can you can overcome any situation
[23:22] by the help of god
[23:23] you can overcome any situation in your
[23:25] life i don't care
[23:26] what it is you can overcome
[23:30] because we've been ordained to overcome
[23:33] like we were saying
[23:34] earlier you go read the book of
[23:35] revelation to him that overcome
[23:37] each age said to whom they're overcome
[23:39] that is a prophecy let you know it'll be
[23:42] overcomers in every age
[23:44] and as dark as this age here it's going
[23:46] to be overcomers
[23:49] can we say praise the lord but if you
[23:52] notice
[23:53] in verse 2 it said and the lord gave
[23:55] joha came
[23:56] king of judah into his hand with part of
[23:59] the vessels of the house of god
[24:01] see they took the vessels of the house
[24:04] of god
[24:04] and they took the people of the they
[24:06] took everything
[24:07] but look what the devil's intent is is
[24:10] to put him
[24:11] in the house of his god so that's why
[24:15] the devil want to get guard vessels
[24:17] which is you which is me he want to get
[24:19] us
[24:20] and use us for his service
[24:24] and god permitted to be so because they
[24:26] rejected the word
[24:28] are you with me verse 3. and the
[24:32] then the king speaker to aspirin as the
[24:34] master of his units
[24:36] that it should bring certain of the
[24:37] children of israel
[24:39] of the king see and of the princes
[24:42] if you notice how that read it said
[24:45] certain
[24:46] of the children of israel not just any
[24:48] of certain of
[24:49] but which ones did he want of the king
[24:52] seed
[24:54] that comes down from david's bloodline
[24:57] because the devil
[24:58] said this is payback david don't gave me
[25:01] all kind of trouble
[25:02] he don't kill my goliath he don't beat
[25:05] all my philistines
[25:06] he that david is gone but now i got
[25:08] david's seat line
[25:09] now i want to get them that's the one he
[25:11] wanted was david seedling
[25:13] and that's what the devil wanted today
[25:15] he want the bride of jesus christ
[25:17] he wants you but i'm here to let the
[25:18] devil know he can't help you
[25:21] because you belong to god not the devil
[25:24] not this world you belong to god
[25:28] hallelujah and he says fresh for
[25:32] children whom was no blemish
[25:36] why children he want to get
[25:39] children with an innocent vine that he
[25:42] can get them away from their parents
[25:45] get them to himself so he can put in
[25:47] their mind
[25:48] what he wants in this mind in their mind
[25:50] this is the same tactic
[25:52] that they done in the days of egypt
[25:54] trying to kill the male child
[25:56] same thing happened in the new testament
[25:58] trying to find the seed killing the
[26:00] children
[26:01] and the devil is doing the same thing
[26:03] today trying to get the younger
[26:05] generation
[26:05] to influence them and to roll doing that
[26:08] they can influence the next generation
[26:09] come behind them
[26:10] but the devil he doesn't realize is the
[26:12] prophecy made over the bride
[26:13] god gonna have old people young people
[26:16] children they're gonna overcome this age
[26:20] that's right notice children in whom no
[26:23] blemish
[26:24] but well-favored skillful in all wisdom
[26:28] cunning and knowledge and understanding
[26:30] signs some of the smartest people i know
[26:32] in this world is children in this
[26:33] message
[26:36] very smart very intelligent
[26:39] and the devil wants you
[26:43] he want to use you for his glory that's
[26:45] what the devil
[26:46] wants all right let's keep going
[26:52] verse 5
[26:57] and the king appointed them a daily
[26:59] provision
[27:01] of the king's meat and underwine he
[27:04] drank
[27:05] so nourishing them three years that at
[27:07] the end there they might stand before
[27:09] the king
[27:10] let me backtrack just a little bit
[27:11] before we go farther with this
[27:13] now here is daniel
[27:16] his family family is being moved
[27:20] all the way to babylon
[27:23] they get settled in their houses because
[27:25] you know they gave them houses and all
[27:27] that stuff
[27:29] but think about it when they get settled
[27:30] in their bodies is settled in but the
[27:32] spirit is not
[27:33] because that's not where they belong
[27:35] they belong in jerusalem
[27:38] but now they don't get settled into
[27:39] their homes everybody's sitting in the
[27:41] house wondering what's going to happen
[27:43] what's going to go on now and then all
[27:46] of a sudden
[27:47] daniel's parent hear that there's a
[27:49] decree
[27:51] has been made to go select
[27:54] certain children
[27:58] you see how smart the devil is
[28:01] he want the seed the kings
[28:04] see certain other children of israel and
[28:07] of the king
[28:08] seed special picks
[28:12] let me tell you you are the devil's
[28:14] picks because he wants you bad
[28:16] but you have to see that you had to do
[28:19] the same thing daniel did you're gonna
[28:20] have to purpose something in your heart
[28:23] i'm not gonna defile myself with that
[28:27] purpose comes power i'm gonna show you
[28:28] that in a moment
[28:30] now here's a little daniel them in their
[28:31] homes they don't got settled in
[28:34] i can see damn parents just walking
[28:36] around
[28:38] knock come touch the door
[28:42] y'all i'm dramatizing they opened the
[28:44] door as one of the king's
[28:46] servants so there's a decree being made
[28:50] we're looking for certain children and
[28:52] we come to get them
[28:54] and we'll be back at a certain certain
[28:56] time
[28:58] i can see there dang your parents the
[29:00] door shut they read in the decree
[29:03] and they whispering and talking to each

[29:48] said you know there's nothing we can do
[29:49] to stop it
[29:51] because we rejected the prophet
[29:55] we rejected the word that's why we're in
[29:57] this condition
[29:58] so now there's nothing we can do he's
[30:01] now gonna have to be at the mercy of god
[30:03] just like we
[30:04] are a
[30:07] day or two passed by parents walking

[31:07] daniel but there's nothing we can do
[31:11] and then all of a sudden they hear the
[31:12] horses coming
[31:18] open the door and there goes daniel got
[31:21] his backpack
[31:25] and daniel walking out with his head
[31:28] down

[32:01] what daniel had
[32:03] and that's what kept him all those years
[32:07] in babylon but his daddy gave him the
[32:11] quote book
[32:13] as a child
[32:16] i could see daniel walking out selected
[32:19] by the king
[32:20] seeing the carnal mind being selected by
[32:23] the king
[32:23] is an honor you think about some of them
[32:27] israelites standing
[32:28] there they saying daniel being chosen
[32:31] damn why are you sad bro

[32:38] kingdom palace

[32:40] head hanging down why you sad damn
[32:43] and then the other one that wasn't
[32:44] chosen i sure would like to go into the
[32:47] king palace
[32:49] you see a lot of times when you think
[32:50] the world got something better to offer
[32:52] you
[32:53] you think that's an honor that's not an
[32:55] honor that's death
[32:58] but the devil want to let you see you've
[32:59] been promoted promote it
[33:02] this is good for you that's what the
[33:04] devil wants you to look at and see

[33:42] hit that quote book
[33:43] and just turn his head no no no
[33:48] they just smiling flashing those eyes in

[33:58] going to tell you something friends

[34:07] that never paid you no attention
[34:09] as soon as you start you want to serve
[34:11] god he starts liking you
[34:15] why do you think that's so that's the
[34:17] devil
[34:18] to get you trapped then this girl didn't
[34:22] pay you no attention the beauty queen or
[34:24] the school

[34:38] giving you all that attention
[34:40] that is a distraction satan just start
[34:43] putting things in your life

[34:46] quench that thirst with the word
[34:48] you're trying to heed to the call god
[34:51] call you satan sees that
[34:52] he said now let me throw opportunities
[34:54] out here to kick them distract them
[34:56] and sadly many failed
[35:02] and then daniel as he walks into the
[35:05] babylon
[35:07] going to the king palace look what they
[35:10] begin to do
[35:13] verse 5 and the king appointed them a
[35:14] daily provisions
[35:16] of the king's meet in other words the
[35:18] king won't
[35:19] want daniel to have what he wants daniel
[35:22] to have
[35:22] so he can get down your thinking
[35:26] to get in the line what he wants daniel
[35:28] thinking to be see that's what school is
[35:30] doing
[35:32] huh what do you think all this school
[35:34] stuff doing they're teaching you
[35:36] y'all i hate crying don't say nothing
[35:37] about homosexuality you know
[35:39] only thing they do is trying to program
[35:41] your mind to babylon
[35:44] they're doing it through school they're
[35:45] doing it through music
[35:47] they do it through movies all of it is
[35:50] to get your mind
[35:51] set to be comfortable here in this world
[35:56] and then get you into an anointing say
[35:58] let's just love everybody everything is
[36:00] okay
[36:01] no no i love everybody but i hate sin
[36:07] but the devil want to get your mind set
[36:09] let's just get along
[36:10] together and be one big family you
[36:13] become my family when you're born again
[36:16] then we are family hello
[36:20] that's right so the king had to give
[36:23] them things
[36:24] to get them to where he wants them to be
[36:26] change their thinking
[36:27] change their diet change that give them
[36:30] a different appetite
[36:32] see this is what's going on through
[36:33] facebook now i know i talk about
[36:35] facebook a lot
[36:36] i'm not against it i'm just against some
[36:38] of the things that they do on it
[36:45] but it's too much time to put in that
[36:46] stuff you know what the prophet god says
[36:49] this
[36:50] if i go into your house and see what you
[36:52] got on your wall
[36:54] what pictures you got on your wall he
[36:56] said i have a good idea what's about you
[36:59] how many of you know you post things on
[37:01] facebook that's a wall
[37:04] so you identified by the things you
[37:06] posted on facebook
[37:08] look and see what you post and get a
[37:10] good idea what's inside of your heart
[37:15] that's right so this world is designed
[37:19] to get your mind control your mind to
[37:22] get you away from the things of god
[37:24] but here's the deceiving thing about it
[37:26] the devil want to get you
[37:28] the devil want to get you to think this
[37:30] way but yet be religious
[37:34] go to church worship sing do whatever
[37:37] you want to do
[37:38] just don't get the holy ghost
[37:43] all right
[37:48] you know what go back to the book of
[37:52] exodus
[37:54] and read the story when pharaoh go to
[37:57] the part where pharaoh
[37:59] was making deals how many of you know
[38:01] pharaoh was making deals with moses
[38:05] other words we're telling moses let's
[38:07] make a deal
[38:10] moses wasn't interested in making no
[38:12] deal the only thing moses had in his
[38:15] mind
[38:16] let my people go so we can go worship
[38:18] god
[38:19] so what pharaoh want to do you remember
[38:21] moses said we want to go a three-day
[38:23] journey
[38:25] we want to go a three-day journey in the
[38:26] wilderness so we can worship our god
[38:28] not a one day not a two-day but a
[38:30] three-day journey that's what moses
[38:32] wanted
[38:34] but pharaoh said let's make a deal moses
[38:36] let's make a deal
[38:38] he said you you go on worship god
[38:42] just like you said then he said but
[38:44] don't go too far
[38:47] worship god in the land
[38:50] moses said not so we worship the god and
[38:54] the abomination of the egyptian all
[38:56] around us
[38:56] moses said no no no see that's a trick
[38:58] of the devil
[39:00] he almost go worship but just don't go
[39:02] far
[39:04] what was pharaoh doing he was telling
[39:06] moses i want you to go worship your god
[39:08] but i don't want you to go too far
[39:10] because i might need to need something
[39:12] from you
[39:12] i might need to use you i want you to be
[39:14] available
[39:16] that the same thing with the devil
[39:17] doesn't go too far in god
[39:19] i want you to keep your lust i want you
[39:21] to keep your attitudes
[39:22] i want you to keep these things i might
[39:24] want to anoint you and use you sometimes
[39:27] but you got to let the devil say you got
[39:28] to let the devil know no i'm going
[39:30] farther than that
[39:34] pharaoh come back to him again okay okay
[39:36] okay okay
[39:38] okay he's going ahead that's right
[39:43] believe the cattle no he's leaving the
[39:46] little ones
[39:48] you moses just like you said
[39:51] you always go leave the little ones
[39:55] pre-adventure it's a lot of trouble out
[39:57] there most you don't want to take them
[39:58] down and know that there's a heat
[40:00] y'all just go on he wanted the moses and
[40:02] then to separate from the little one
[40:04] so that he can do it uh what
[40:06] nebuchadnezzar is doing
[40:07] get to their mind but he said i got to
[40:10] get rid of the old ones so i can get to
[40:12] the little ones
[40:13] so i can get them the way i want them
[40:14] that's why he hate ministry
[40:16] satan hate old-time preachers old-time
[40:20] ministers that believe in the original
[40:21] way
[40:22] satan hates them can we say man
[40:25] that's why the devil tried to get you to
[40:27] pull back from your parents
[40:29] man my parents don't understand what i'm
[40:31] going through they oh now this is a new
[40:33] generation
[40:33] let me just pull back let me get some
[40:35] counsel from some of the young people
[40:37] that is around me they don't understand
[40:39] us yes we do understand you i did not
[40:42] come out of my mama wound 54 years old
[40:48] that's right but he want to get you to
[40:51] pull away
[40:52] from elders someone they're going to
[40:54] give you wisdom and the right guidance
[40:59] and moses said not so he said we will go
[41:04] with our little ones that's right the
[41:06] old
[41:07] we're all going defense okay okay okay
[41:10] okay okay
[41:12] just go lead your cattle
[41:15] just leave your counter and you go he's
[41:18] trying to get moses them
[41:20] to go worship god without a sacrifice
[41:25] that's what the devil wants us to try to
[41:26] get us to do be religious but not having
[41:29] a
[41:29] revelation what this true sacrifice
[41:31] jesus christ is all about
[41:36] and moses said no we all going to go
[41:40] our old our young our cattle
[41:44] and moses was so greedy
[41:47] he said we ain't even gonna leave a hoof
[41:52] i can imagine pharaoh come on dude you
[41:54] got to have over four million cattle out
[41:56] there
[41:56] and you're gonna tell me you you won't
[41:58] even leave a hoof
[41:59] that's exactly right because moses wants
[42:01] the devil to know
[42:02] everything that belongs to god goes
[42:06] and you have to have that same attitude
[42:08] my mind belongs to god
[42:10] my thinking belongs to god my soul
[42:12] belongs to god my spirit belonged to god
[42:14] satan ain't leaving nothing for you to
[42:16] use to try to anoint me to go the wrong
[42:18] way i'm not giving it to you i'm giving
[42:20] it all to god
[42:22] because it's a three-day journey not one
[42:24] justification sacrificing the baptism of
[42:27] the holy ghost
[42:28] you got to go all the way it's a
[42:30] three-day journey
[42:34] it's looking right the tactics of the
[42:36] devil that's how he does
[42:38] things notice
[42:43] verse six now among these were other
[42:46] children of judah
[42:48] daniel hananiah michelle and azariah
[42:53] that is their god-given name
[42:59] but the devil don't like that i want to
[43:02] give him another name
[43:04] see the devil want to give you another
[43:05] name
[43:08] huh he want to call you chicks and dudes
[43:11] and players and all those kind of names
[43:13] babylonian words huh
[43:19] you take it to another level you want to
[43:21] give us another name baptist methodist
[43:23] pentecostal then the name the devil want
[43:24] to give up but god said you're
[43:26] christians
[43:27] you are sons and daughters of god
[43:31] that's what you are but the world want
[43:33] to give you names
[43:37] sometimes some young people especially
[43:38] themselves they get caught up in in the
[43:40] master they get caught up into some of
[43:42] these worldly atmospheres
[43:43] they decide to change their name too
[43:44] call them their name schwagero and all
[43:46] that stuff
[43:47] sit in a message church swagger yo
[43:50] that don't even sound right to me to
[43:51] call somebody brother swaggy
[43:55] what are they trying to do they want a
[43:57] name to try to fit in with what the
[43:59] world
[43:59] the trend of the world is doing
[44:06] that's not right try to change their
[44:08] identity changing their
[44:09] changing everything about them they
[44:11] changed it down your location
[44:13] they changed down your name but they
[44:15] could not change daniel's heart
[44:21] verse seven unto whom the prince of the
[44:24] units gave names
[44:25] so he gave it to daniel the name best of
[44:27] shazam
[44:29] and to have an eye shadrach and timothy
[44:32] meshach and azar azariah
[44:35] they think if they did good to see their
[44:37] mom and dad and their mama would say hey
[44:38] daniel he's an arm bell
[44:40] bell chaser what any name i gave
[44:43] you boy where you get that from that's
[44:44] what they call me
[44:50] the devil want to change your complete
[44:52] identity
[44:55] a wife with anything of this message but
[44:58] be
[44:58] tied into this world the worldly names
[45:01] he want to change everything about you
[45:06] verse 8 this is the verse i love
[45:11] but daniel purposed
[45:14] not in his mind see when you prefer
[45:17] something in your mind
[45:18] that can change but when you get
[45:20] something rooted down in your heart
[45:23] amen he purposed in his heart
[45:26] that he would not defile himself with
[45:29] the portions of the king's meet
[45:31] he had to do that because he knew if i
[45:33] accept what the king
[45:34] gave me it's going to change me it's
[45:37] going to change the way i think change
[45:39] the way i look
[45:40] i don't want it you got to be the same
[45:42] way brothers and sisters
[45:43] i don't want nothing that this world has
[45:44] to offer nothing
[45:47] i want the mind of christ not the mind
[45:50] of this world
[45:57] not with the wine which he drank what a
[46:01] what a what a position to be in
[46:03] drinking the same wine that the king
[46:05] drank
[46:07] what an honor i just want to let the
[46:09] world know i do drink wine
[46:12] but not that one i drank the wine of
[46:14] revelation for the stimulation of the
[46:16] word
[46:17] not that one
[46:23] verse nine now how now
[46:26] i want you to catch this brothers and
[46:28] sisters this boy is 14 years old
[46:34] but look at the decisions he's making
[46:37] at the age of 14.
[46:40] he's making decisions adults won't even
[46:42] make that's right
[46:45] 14 years old because there was something
[46:48] down in here
[46:51] he said i'm not going to give this up
[46:54] purpose in his heart not only daniel the
[46:57] other three did it too
[46:59] let me explain something to you in a
[47:01] minute i'm gonna get to this verse
[47:07] let me just skip down let me skip some
[47:09] things here
[47:11] i don't want you but i'm gonna have to
[47:12] for time's sake
[47:15] someone i can be a long-winded preacher
[47:17] i can be a short one
[47:20] my wife my wife gave me a compliment
[47:22] this morning she said
[47:24] that was too quick
[47:27] and she told me she said i knew you had
[47:29] some more fuel in that tank brother
[47:30] i said that was too quick yeah but too
[47:32] quick for a preacher to get that from
[47:34] his wife that's good
[47:37] because usually they be they want to
[47:38] remind you don't belong with it
[47:41] i'm just saying let me just
[47:52] i'm gonna i'm gonna jump down to verse
[47:54] 17
[47:58] let me i'm gonna have to go with my
[47:59] bible i i mark down what i want but let
[48:02] me read something to you
[48:21] let's go down here to versey uh
[48:24] verse 11.
[48:27] dean sent down to merzar whom the
[48:29] princes of the unit had set over daniel
[48:31] hannah michelle and azariah
[48:34] prove thy servants i beseech the 10 days
[48:38] let them give us pulse to eat and water
[48:41] to drink
[48:42] and let our consciousness be looked upon
[48:44] before thee
[48:46] and the confidence of the children to
[48:47] eat are the portions of the king's
[48:49] meat and as thou seest deal with thy
[48:53] servant that's a bold statement
[48:55] otherwise daniel let him know
[48:57] you let us eat what we want to eat and
[48:59] you do one the other one because the
[49:01] other a lot of them children in israel
[49:02] fail
[49:04] new four didn't but the rest of them
[49:06] failed he said you let them eat that
[49:08] king's meat then when we come together
[49:10] you look at our contents and we'll let
[49:11] you be the judge
[49:15] that's what i'm gonna tell you something
[49:16] young people yo
[49:19] the way you say certain things even the
[49:22] way you dress
[49:23] the way you talk it speaks on what
[49:26] you're eating because you're going to
[49:30] express it out
[49:33] and i'm not talking about in church
[49:34] either i'm telling when you ain't in
[49:36] church
[49:37] [Music]
[49:41] you know i love the holy ghost
[49:44] this is just 20 something years ago
[49:47] even in the school systems when
[49:51] parents they know the parents love the
[49:53] lord and have a testimony
[49:54] when the children do wrong school tell
[49:56] them
[50:01] that's right you know sometimes young
[50:02] girl they get their friend to sneak a
[50:04] pair of pants to school for and
[50:06] they put their pants on at school and
[50:08] all of a sudden you get a phone call and
[50:10] teachers say now i know what you believe
[50:11] i
[50:12] might not agree what you believe but
[50:14] your daughter had pants on
[50:15] you kidding me yes
[50:18] did you come home always hey mom how was
[50:21] your day at school great
[50:24] i didn't know they got a phone call from
[50:26] school to tell you
[50:31] some things happen you know another
[50:34] thing happened
[50:35] you know sometimes young people get out
[50:37] there on the job
[50:38] it's working but on the job they want
[50:40] they want to act like everybody else
[50:43] they don't want to testify i'm a
[50:44] christian i love the lord and then
[50:46] they're ashamed jesus don't be ashamed
[50:49] of me you'll be ashamed of me i'm going
[50:50] to be ashamed of you
[50:52] but to be on the job acting all cool and
[50:54] everything
[50:55] i want to get down with their normal
[50:57] language and stuff
[50:59] and then one day they'd be with their
[51:00] parents they should be walking somewhere
[51:01] and then one of them guys on the job see
[51:03] you
[51:03] they say yo what's up homie what's up
[51:06] y'all you like what
[51:07] are you talking about what are you
[51:09] saying i don't know what they're saying
[51:10] mom
[51:11] they telling on you
[51:16] god permits that to happen do you know
[51:18] why
[51:19] because he loves you
[51:24] cause he loves you to let you know don't
[51:26] be ashamed of me
[51:29] don't get caught up i know it's pressure
[51:31] i know it's a pull on the flesh
[51:33] but i got better things for you than
[51:35] that
[51:40] that's exactly right verse 15
[51:44] at the end of the ten day their
[51:45] conscience appeared fair
[51:48] and fatter in flesh than all the
[51:51] children
[51:52] which did eat the portion of the king's
[51:55] meat that's why we appear different
[51:58] because of what we're eating on
[52:00] we're eating on the word we appear
[52:02] different to the world
[52:06] and i want to say this it ain't just
[52:08] even the appearance of your clothes
[52:10] but when you're eating on the word
[52:11] feasting on the things of god you carry
[52:13] an
[52:13] anointing that the world recognize
[52:17] something different about you
[52:20] it'll be an anointing that they
[52:22] recognize
[52:28] verse 16 the all took away the portion
[52:32] of their meat
[52:33] and the wine that they should drink and
[52:36] gave them
[52:37] posts now i want you to catch verse 17.
[52:42] you know before i read it
[52:48] i know the language
[52:51] as young people you want us to
[52:55] understand what you're going through
[52:58] i understand every bit of that
[53:02] i sympathize with it i do i actually do
[53:06] because it's such a poor but i want to
[53:10] show you something
[53:12] that i help you even when you're down
[53:17] you're like it's just so hard it's so
[53:20] rough
[53:20] it's dog this is going on see it's just
[53:24] it's just so it's i just can't
[53:26] it's just it's just so much going on i'm
[53:28] gonna be honest with you
[53:29] i'm one of the wrong preachers to bring
[53:31] that to
[53:34] because that type of stuff i can't pull
[53:36] my spirit down
[53:38] with you say oh bless your heart
[53:43] god understands just keep pressing on
[53:46] you know what you're going to do
[53:47] you're going to walk away feeling
[53:49] justified
[53:51] and yet be in the same state
[53:56] because i want to take you to something
[53:57] higher
[53:59] to let you know regardless of what
[54:00] you're going through here's someone
[54:02] here to help you it's the lord jesus
[54:04] christ
[54:06] because i want you to watch the
[54:07] scripture because daniel them
[54:11] purposed in their heart
[54:15] no wavering no doubt they was dead set
[54:19] we're not going to defile ourselves
[54:21] whenever you make a decision like that
[54:23] in your life i'm gonna serve god
[54:26] regardless
[54:27] whenever you do that god will send an
[54:30] anointing on your life
[54:32] and strengthen you to help you keep
[54:35] walking
[54:36] see we don't read with daniel and
[54:38] purpose in their heart
[54:40] they they they we're going to defile
[54:41] themselves because them doing that
[54:44] this is what verse 17 says ask for these
[54:48] for not men
[54:52] children god gave
[54:55] them knowledge and skill
[54:58] and all learning and wisdom and daniel
[55:01] had
[55:02] understanding and visions and dreams
[55:05] have purposed their heart god poured an
[55:07] anointing all upon them
[55:10] he would do the exact same thing for you
[55:12] see i'm
[55:13] purpose i'm gonna serve god god just
[55:15] started anointing you giving you
[55:16] strength
[55:17] start overcoming things you're like wow
[55:19] what i just feel like i'm just going up
[55:21] now
[55:21] it's because of what you purpose
[55:25] that's how god does things
[55:28] but now when you walk every day in your
[55:30] life with that strength no
[55:33] but he gives you portions when you're at
[55:36] your lowest stage when you have need
[55:38] because you keep pressing on he still
[55:40] give drop portions
[55:42] like he did ruth handfuls of portion
[55:45] purpose
[55:47] because if god anoint you every day of
[55:50] your life
[55:51] and you're up on the mountain you'll
[55:53] freeze
[55:56] how many y'all heard brother brother say
[55:57] that he said you stay up on the mountain
[55:59] all the time your fruit freezes
[56:03] that's why the mountains have valleys
[56:05] how many y'all ever seen the whole
[56:06] series a mountain just stared at them
[56:09] anybody ever been driving just seeing
[56:10] mountain you know what you do
[56:12] you just stare at the top of them
[56:15] wow look at that now you never pay no
[56:17] attention to the valleys
[56:20] it lets you know to get the one mountain
[56:22] to the next you got to go down to the
[56:23] valley to get there
[56:24] up and down up and down but we sang the
[56:27] song the guard on the mountain he's
[56:28] still
[56:29] in the valley god
[56:32] gave them this anointing because they
[56:35] purposed this
[56:36] in their heart
[56:40] can we say praise the lord i'm just
[56:42] trying to show you but these are
[56:44] children in babylon
[56:48] one quote book see daniel
[56:52] and the other three even though they was
[56:54] in babylon they was in different
[56:56] provinces daniel was by himself
[56:59] the other three had fellowship with each
[57:00] other but
[57:02] daniel was by himself
[57:05] and overcame with one quote book
[57:08] now daniel could come overcome with one
[57:11] quote but from jeremiah
[57:12] how much you can do what god don't gave
[57:14] you in this day over 1200 messages
[57:18] you can overcome this layer to see and
[57:20] age but you got to do the same thing
[57:22] then
[57:22] they just had one book he would read it
[57:25] over
[57:26] 70 years reading one book
[57:30] and he overcame babylon now what about
[57:33] you and me where all god has poured out
[57:35] in this day
[57:36] he gave us the word this message to
[57:39] overcome this age
[57:43] can we say praise the lord
[57:46] turn to daniel 3.
[57:53] see some of you getting sleeping i can
[57:56] give you some resurrection power
[57:59] all i gotta do is say i'm fixing the
[58:00] clothes
[58:05] you know the people resurrect fit in the
[58:08] car
[58:10] a few more minutes go by he ain't closed
[58:22] chapter three you remember
[58:25] the same cry in daniel chapter three to
[58:28] come to worship an image
[58:31] it's the same thing that's happening
[58:32] today i want us to fall down to the
[58:34] image of the beast worship
[58:36] the beast all these things parallels
[58:38] right in the scripture
[58:41] how many you believe it the mark of the
[58:43] beast and all these things you can
[58:45] preach it right here
[58:46] in the scripture but i think something
[58:49] that's overlooked
[58:51] in this age about pulling people to the
[58:54] image
[58:58] and one of the key thing in this day
[59:02] what the devil have really mastered
[59:05] his music
[59:10] according to science
[59:13] music is the only thing
[59:16] can invade your conscience without your
[59:20] permission
[59:22] according to science you say oh
[59:25] no well let me give you an example
[59:29] how do you say you just can be in a
[59:30] department store mine in your business
[59:34] ain't thinking about no music but you
[59:35] just walk in the department store
[59:37] and also
[59:42] and then you catch yourself
[59:47] sorry lord sorry your music can invade
[59:51] your country
[59:51] just like that haven't you ever been
[59:54] sitting in a restaurant
[59:55] waiting on your food to come the music
[59:57] playing then i'm saying you get the
[59:58] knife for the fart you start going
[1:00:04] that music has invaded your then
[1:00:06] when you catch it
[1:00:09] nobody can see that
[1:00:15] that's the power of music power music
[1:00:21] and then the prophet of god has a vision
[1:00:25] of the end time of the worldly bride
[1:00:27] god's bride
[1:00:29] in both incident music was involved
[1:00:35] one of them was dancing to a rock and
[1:00:36] roll tomb
[1:00:38] and the other one was marching on with
[1:00:41] christian soldier
[1:00:43] music is involved
[1:00:46] now watch daniel 3 verse 4.
[1:00:52] then a herald came aloud to you it is
[1:00:55] commanded o
[1:00:56] people nations and
[1:01:00] languages not just babylon because this
[1:01:02] is the
[1:01:03] time of the gentile ring they had power
[1:01:05] over everything
[1:01:07] verse 5 that at what time you hear the
[1:01:10] sound of the cornet
[1:01:12] flute heart sacrifice plastering decimal
[1:01:15] listen what it said and all kinds of
[1:01:19] music you fall down and worship the
[1:01:23] image
[1:01:24] that nebuchadnezzar the king has set up
[1:01:29] all kinds of music
[1:01:34] hitler says this you give me the music
[1:01:38] of a country i control the youth of the
[1:01:42] country
[1:01:44] because you know it works through music
[1:01:48] that's why you me we have to be
[1:01:51] careful with music
[1:01:56] if you're listening to music and it's
[1:02:00] not ministering to your soul
[1:02:04] that is not of god
[1:02:08] if he just make you happy in your flesh
[1:02:10] this is what it is fleshly music
[1:02:13] music is ordained to minister to your
[1:02:16] soul
[1:02:16] and pull you closer to jesus christ
[1:02:21] but the devil is so crafty
[1:02:26] i hate to do this let me all over here
[1:02:28] kirk franklin
[1:02:32] don't be ashamed you have just raise
[1:02:33] your hand hang on or something
[1:02:36] ain't gonna do that you're probably
[1:02:38] saying some of his songs and don't
[1:02:40] know it
[1:02:43] kurt franklin is one of the greatest
[1:02:46] tools the devil have
[1:02:50] in this day and time kurt franklin
[1:02:54] i used to be a disc jockey professional
[1:02:57] i can take kirk franklin music
[1:03:01] and i can show you every worldly song
[1:03:04] that we danced in the club where he got
[1:03:07] it from

[1:03:18] no
[1:03:18] no no no no where did that music come
[1:03:20] from where'd the root of that music come
[1:03:22] from

[1:03:27] prove it i got my son one time
[1:03:28] let me share something to you pull up a
[1:03:30] quick song i'll go find the
[1:03:31] worldly song

[1:03:39] has revolutionized
[1:03:41] the way that music is he sure did under
[1:03:44] what anointing
[1:03:46] the devil
[1:03:52] what what celebrities
[1:03:56] today people will listen to them more
[1:03:59] than a president
[1:04:00] and then a preacher
[1:04:04] what's happening now they got
[1:04:07] celebrities
[1:04:08] when they make new audio bibles
[1:04:12] they get the voice of celebrities to
[1:04:14] read the bible
[1:04:18] morgan freeman his voice is so distinct
[1:04:22] they want him to read the bible to you
[1:04:24] and this man don't even believe in god
[1:04:30] all of this is a part of babylon
[1:04:33] feeding you her meat getting your mind
[1:04:36] directed the way that she wants it
[1:04:39] all this is happening all around us
[1:04:41] every
[1:04:42] day
[1:04:45] children in babylon i'm a close
[1:04:54] i'm saying this from the depths of my
[1:04:55] soul
[1:04:58] showing you how daniel
[1:05:01] overcame all of those years
[1:05:06] and he didn't have the holy ghost
[1:05:13] now what excuse we have having the holy
[1:05:17] ghost
[1:05:18] but yet letting babylon control us
[1:05:24] it's no excuse i understand your
[1:05:27] struggles
[1:05:28] i understand your pressure i understand
[1:05:30] but i'm here to tell you
[1:05:31] you need to look a different way
[1:05:36] because you want to stay in a sad
[1:05:38] situation where i'm just struggling i'm
[1:05:39] just struggling i'm just struggling i'm
[1:05:41] just struggling
[1:05:41] you'll stay that way and the only thing
[1:05:43] in your life's gonna be the struggle
[1:05:44] you'll never get nowhere
[1:05:46] you'll stay stuck in one spot you'll
[1:05:49] have to come to a place i'm
[1:05:50] tired of this struggle
[1:05:55] i'm going to be free from this struggle
[1:05:59] see you go through changes in life
[1:06:02] as a young person you go to the stages
[1:06:07] you condemn yourself in the mirror
[1:06:11] you look in the mirror
[1:06:15] why can't my hair be like hers
[1:06:20] look at this
[1:06:25] before you know it you get a young girl
[1:06:27] in the church that seemed to be popular
[1:06:30] all you got to do watch your hairstyle
[1:06:33] if she got any little followers they'll
[1:06:35] do her hair their hair just like hers
[1:06:37] they don't form the hair club
[1:06:44] boys get in the mirror
[1:06:53] why can't i be like him
[1:06:58] the only thing you're doing is trying to
[1:06:59] find an identity in your life
[1:07:02] but you're looking at the influence when
[1:07:03] somebody else want to be like them
[1:07:06] you don't need muscles to serve jesus
[1:07:09] you need faith muscles
[1:07:14] beauty is being born again every girl
[1:07:17] that is born again for the holy ghost
[1:07:19] you are
[1:07:20] beautiful you ain't got to try to
[1:07:23] attract nobody from the outward
[1:07:25] appearance
[1:07:25] you can it's the holy if a boy got the
[1:07:28] holy ghost you got the holy ghost
[1:07:29] holy ghost tracks holy ghost
[1:07:35] i am so hurt of you hearing so many
[1:07:38] divorces happen around this perfect word
[1:07:41] about young people not even young older
[1:07:45] something wrong somewhere
[1:07:49] second right how many you want to be
[1:07:54] married
[1:07:56] go ahead raise your hand
[1:07:59] how many of you want to get married
[1:08:02] now the ones that didn't raise your hand
[1:08:04] you were married first
[1:08:11] it happened to you first
[1:08:16] see when some of you raised your hand
[1:08:17] the other one looked around who's
[1:08:19] available
[1:08:23] let me explain something to you coming
[1:08:26] to meetings like this
[1:08:28] having meetings like this there is
[1:08:30] nothing wrong
[1:08:32] when you know you're in the place with
[1:08:34] god have the holy spirit
[1:08:37] there's nothing wrong thinking maybe the
[1:08:39] one is here
[1:08:41] ain't nothing wrong with that you see
[1:08:44] down through the years
[1:08:45] preachers preaching so hard are you
[1:08:47] coming here because you want a
[1:08:48] girlfriend what a black friend you are
[1:08:49] wrong i don't know
[1:08:51] i ready for you to be in a meeting like
[1:08:53] this in your heart right looking
[1:08:55] instead of looking the wrong way out
[1:08:56] there in that world
[1:09:02] you might get a call on this paul but
[1:09:04] i'll stand behind what i said i got no
[1:09:05] problem with that
[1:09:08] i like to just keep it real because this
[1:09:11] gospel
[1:09:12] is real it's real
[1:09:17] but you got to make sure 100 you got
[1:09:20] that relationship
[1:09:21] with jesus christ children in babylon
[1:09:26] and i can say children and laodicea
[1:09:30] but i'm here to tell you you can do the
[1:09:31] same thing daniel did
[1:09:36] let me tell you young people too watch
[1:09:39] where you hang around
[1:09:42] just because you're in the same church
[1:09:43] that don't mean they're good for you
[1:09:46] oh
[1:09:48] exactly right you need to be around
[1:09:52] somebody they're going to speak positive
[1:09:55] go talk about the things of god not
[1:09:58] secret stuff
[1:10:00] but things of god that's what you need
[1:10:03] to
[1:10:03] hang around
[1:10:08] i mean back in the days
[1:10:11] i don't preach so many count meetings it
[1:10:12] ain't funny i can't tell you how many
[1:10:15] but i'm i'm an observer
[1:10:20] back in the days i'll be in the
[1:10:21] ministerial building you know where to
[1:10:23] keep the minnesota i'll be looking out
[1:10:24] the window
[1:10:26] and you can see certain boys walking
[1:10:30] around the campground
[1:10:32] they know they're the man
[1:10:36] they walk around with so much confidence
[1:10:41] when you talk to it's uh
[1:10:52] and i always have little fellas behind
[1:10:54] them falling right behind him
[1:10:59] and they're just walking around and then
[1:11:01] when they get close to where the girl's
[1:11:03] sitting
[1:11:04] you always have a girl in a group she's
[1:11:07] it
[1:11:09] and it'd be a bunch of girls behind her
[1:11:12] you'll notice it probably about the
[1:11:13] second day after the camp because
[1:11:15] they'll have their hair counted the same
[1:11:16] way
[1:11:18] because it's an influence want to fit in
[1:11:22] with a group
[1:11:23] and be identified that's what that
[1:11:25] actually is
[1:11:29] i preaching at the camp i said you boys
[1:11:31] i said you walk around
[1:11:33] you the rooster and all of the hand just
[1:11:39] i just want y'all to know one thing i am
[1:11:42] the farmer
[1:11:42] with the pick for
[1:11:50] because i hate to see a boy that thinks
[1:11:53] he's all of that
[1:11:55] play with a girl's emotions
[1:12:01] and she gets so caught up he looked at
[1:12:04] me
[1:12:05] yeah he looked at you your friend your
[1:12:07] friend friend he looked at all of you
[1:12:12] that's right a holy ghost gentleman
[1:12:16] don't do that
[1:12:19] don't do that
[1:12:23] walking around the campground can't even
[1:12:24] get nothing out of the service cody
[1:12:29] what the preacher freak ah it was good
[1:12:33] what did he say it was good
[1:12:40] but all you did is sat down
[1:12:43] and then when it's over going to the
[1:12:45] cafeteria to eat
[1:12:47] and she'd get close they do a trait
[1:12:52] i just observe for the paul i do and it
[1:12:55] hurts my heart
[1:12:57] when i see young people get so
[1:12:58] vulnerable
[1:13:00] to want to fit in until they want to
[1:13:02] lower themselves
[1:13:04] lower their conviction just to fit in
[1:13:05] with a group
[1:13:08] that hurts
[1:13:15] one more
[1:13:18] i had a young boy come to me one time
[1:13:22] his dad come to me said brother brother
[1:13:23] could you talk to my son
[1:13:26] he said he has a lot of respect for you
[1:13:27] yeah i talked to him once where is he at
[1:13:29] he showed me where he did i went down
[1:13:31] there and
[1:13:32] when i walked up to him i seen him he
[1:13:36] had his head down
[1:13:37] he'll look up see me coming i just shook
[1:13:40] my head that's a lost poke fella
[1:13:45] i said what's the problem bud
[1:13:49] brother burleigh i tried to hang around
[1:13:52] those guys they don't want me to be
[1:13:53] around
[1:13:55] really she yeah yeah
[1:14:01] and the holy spirit comes on the scene
[1:14:06] i said have you ever had a little kid
[1:14:09] younger than you
[1:14:10] come up to you and want to play with you
[1:14:14] then you'll be with your other friends
[1:14:16] and you push the kid off
[1:14:19] his consonant change like where is the
[1:14:22] man going
[1:14:24] i see when that happened to you you're
[1:14:28] playing with a kid younger than you
[1:14:30] your friends come around you need to
[1:14:32] tell that young kid
[1:14:33] hey buddy we're buddies but let me get
[1:14:35] back with you later i'm gonna hang with
[1:14:37] them a little bit
[1:14:38] i'll get back with you i said little kid
[1:14:39] to go okay okay
[1:14:41] you didn't offend him i said but if you
[1:14:44] push him off
[1:14:45] and jump with your friends instead of
[1:14:48] gonna hurt him and it's gonna offend him
[1:14:50] i said now you're reaping what you sow
[1:14:56] i said your other problem is i says over
[1:14:59] 500 kids out here
[1:15:01] on this campground i said but you want
[1:15:05] to fit with a certain
[1:15:06] group that's what you want
[1:15:10] i said when you want to go make friends
[1:15:11] with everybody i said you make friends
[1:15:13] with everybody you'll never be by
[1:15:15] yourself
[1:15:17] i said that's what you need to do
[1:15:21] i didn't go up there i'm so sorry for
[1:15:23] you young man
[1:15:24] oh god no that ain't going to help him
[1:15:29] so he walks off a couple hours later i
[1:15:32] seen him
[1:15:34] he made him a new group of friends they
[1:15:36] were all laughing i walked by
[1:15:38] i looked at him he looked at me
[1:15:44] see when you want to get in certain
[1:15:46] groups you all got a denomination spirit
[1:15:49] on you
[1:15:52] that's what you got on you right when we
[1:15:54] supposed to be the family of god
[1:16:01] exactly right the most wonderful thing
[1:16:05] when you see young people get converted
[1:16:08] through experience in their life you're
[1:16:11] able to reach
[1:16:12] younger people then more than me and all
[1:16:14] of them can
[1:16:17] it just circles right around when you
[1:16:19] see somebody struggling go help them
[1:16:23] because they don't fit in your group no
[1:16:25] no we are supposed to be the body of
[1:16:32] christ
[1:16:34] sometimes a young boy might not be
[1:16:35] noticeable
[1:16:38] because you might get some big glasses
[1:16:39] on
[1:16:41] girls look down
[1:16:46] then later on in his life he might
[1:16:49] become the ceo of a company
[1:16:52] and then you find out hey
[1:16:56] what about when he was a little bitty
[1:16:57] nerdy little fella you pay no attention
[1:16:59] to it
[1:17:00] now hey and he said how are you doing
[1:17:03] let me let you meet my wife
[1:17:10] that's that's right let me tell you
[1:17:14] something
[1:17:16] get married to jesus christ
[1:17:19] before you try to marry somebody else
[1:17:25] have a relationship with him first
[1:17:29] he will bring the one that he ordained
[1:17:32] for you
[1:17:34] somehow some way he'll bring it
[1:17:37] together but you have to be patient
[1:17:41] first be right with him that's how god
[1:17:44] does things
[1:17:48] and i'm going to say this and i promise
[1:17:52] i just said i promise i ain't saying i
[1:17:54] was gonna do i just said i promise
[1:18:01] let me say something to you
[1:18:07] out of all your faults failures errors
[1:18:10] upset
[1:18:10] disappointments i want to let you know
[1:18:13] from the depths of my heart
[1:18:14] just for you to even be here i'm proud
[1:18:18] of you
[1:18:21] may god bless you just for you to even
[1:18:23] be here may god bless you
[1:18:28] and don't take nothing like me what i
[1:18:30] said to you this evening
[1:18:31] because i'm giving you exactly what god
[1:18:33] put on my heart many things i could
[1:18:35] preach
[1:18:36] but this is what he put on my heart i
[1:18:37] want to let you know okay how young you
[1:18:39] are
[1:18:40] you can overcome anything
[1:18:44] talk to your parents if you don't have
[1:18:48] parents
[1:18:48] you have a pastor you have deacons
[1:18:53] someone you can talk to because it's a
[1:18:55] shame sometimes
[1:18:56] parents are not in the position where
[1:18:58] they need to be
[1:19:00] that's bad but i want to let you know
[1:19:02] you always want to have somebody
[1:19:04] that can you can have confidence in and
[1:19:07] talk to about situations in life
[1:19:09] i pray to god it's your parents because
[1:19:11] that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:19:13] but you do have pastors to lead you
[1:19:16] and guide you let me tell you something
[1:19:19] young people i believe
[1:19:23] the question to be asked sometimes what
[1:19:25] is a successful pastor
[1:19:28] i thought about that thing over and over
[1:19:29] and over
[1:19:31] to me a pastor of success
[1:19:35] is when he teach the word of god as god
[1:19:38] give it to him
[1:19:40] so anoint it and just lay it out to you
[1:19:42] and you receive it
[1:19:44] a pastor's success is when you don't
[1:19:46] have to keep coming to him with your
[1:19:48] problems
[1:19:49] but you can take the word of god and fix
[1:19:51] your problems
[1:19:55] he's done his job i'm not a dr phil got
[1:20:04] a problem dr phil dr phil
[1:20:06] get the pill no no no that's psychology
[1:20:11] but when your pastor counsel you when
[1:20:12] you hear the word of god preach
[1:20:14] take it to your heart because something
[1:20:17] could come up in your life
[1:20:19] and then the holy spirit takes you back
[1:20:21] hey pastors preach another minute to
[1:20:23] preach the same thing
[1:20:25] you'll be able to deal with your problem
[1:20:26] i love it when my congregation don't
[1:20:28] hardly ever come to me about their
[1:20:30] problems
[1:20:32] that lets me know they caught a hope to
[1:20:34] the word they can deal with it
[1:20:35] themselves
[1:20:37] i don't know married couple coming to me
[1:20:40] with a problem and we don't talk about
[1:20:42] it before
[1:20:45] that makes me upset because it lets me
[1:20:46] know they didn't listen to me the first
[1:20:48] time
[1:20:48] and what make you thinking of looking
[1:20:49] the second time
[1:20:52] brother take the word you young man
[1:20:57] i challenge you because you're gonna be
[1:20:59] the leader of a family one day
[1:21:00] you're gonna be the priest of your home
[1:21:02] one day but i'm challenging you
[1:21:04] to get into maturity mature in the word
[1:21:08] because you'll be a leader of a home one
[1:21:09] day
[1:21:12] and it's pressure
[1:21:15] some just want to get married i just
[1:21:17] want to get back
[1:21:18] okay you think what you think it is
[1:21:25] love is blind is eye-opening
[1:21:34] you learn a lot of things but if you can
[1:21:37] take
[1:21:37] things now while you're young and apply
[1:21:39] it to your life it's gonna help you
[1:21:42] in there and you get married all these
[1:21:44] things gonna help you
[1:21:46] you'll be able to glean and pull back on
[1:21:48] them think about it and it is gonna help
[1:21:50] you
[1:21:51] but it's still gonna be mistakes because
[1:21:52] you gotta grow
[1:21:56] people don't even believe in courtship
[1:21:57] no more they believe it let's do it
[1:22:02] nope don't work like that
[1:22:05] and i'm gonna tell you young boy if you
[1:22:07] ever talking to a young girl
[1:22:10] without the consent of a father i'm
[1:22:12] ashamed of you
[1:22:15] i'm ashamed of you that's wrong that's
[1:22:18] what worldly that's what babylonians do
[1:22:22] not believers
[1:22:26] you see another thing mess up the young
[1:22:29] people is just texting
[1:22:34] i don't believe you got no right to be
[1:22:36] texting a girl it's the parents the
[1:22:38] father don't know
[1:22:40] because when you're texting you you're
[1:22:42] creating a bond
[1:22:45] in a relationship she's taking your
[1:22:46] words
[1:22:49] you're creating something
[1:22:58] when you got your life right with god
[1:23:00] you won't be ashamed to approach a man
[1:23:04] amen you said sir i'd like to talk to
[1:23:06] you
[1:23:08] i've been praying for a wife i'm kind of
[1:23:11] interested in your daughter
[1:23:12] can i talk to you sir if he's a mature
[1:23:15] man
[1:23:17] sorry son let's get good and talk
[1:23:22] but if he knows his daughter says young
[1:23:25] man i appreciate you coming to me but
[1:23:27] she ain't ready for this kind of stuff
[1:23:29] you need to be a gentleman walk away
[1:23:31] that's right
[1:23:34] it alone
[1:23:37] don't be but sir god
[1:23:40] showed me she's nigh
[1:23:46] you might tell your son god showing me
[1:23:47] something right now and i think you
[1:23:48] might need to leave
[1:23:54] and some girls get so offended
[1:23:57] cause sometimes their dad might be a
[1:23:59] little rough
[1:24:01] i never get nobody with a daddy like
[1:24:02] this you ought to be thankful to your
[1:24:05] daddy like that
[1:24:09] but there are some incident parents are
[1:24:11] too rough and they run off a good man
[1:24:14] run off a good girl that's what the
[1:24:16] balance have to be
[1:24:17] by the holy spirit
[1:24:21] can we say man
[1:24:25] one young girl i'm just talking now
[1:24:28] musicians could come
[1:24:30] one young girl had a boy come up to her

[1:24:41] me you're my husband and he ain't
[1:24:43] showing me that
[1:24:44] she just walked away
[1:24:48] that's because the person put god in it

[1:25:00] but young man if you know you ain't even
[1:25:04] right yourself
[1:25:06] struggling ain't overcoming things
[1:25:09] don't try to get in no relationship
[1:25:13] don't do it cause if you do then you
[1:25:16] still got them problems ain't been
[1:25:18] overcame you're
[1:25:18] loosely useful lust no overclocking you

[1:25:22] and going
[1:25:23] oh we gonna get married then you do get
[1:25:25] married you know what happened you carry
[1:25:26] out all of that right into that marriage
[1:25:30] now you're in a marriage not only is
[1:25:32] struggling with things that happen in
[1:25:34] the marriage now you're struggling with
[1:25:35] yourself trying to overcome things you
[1:25:37] should have
[1:25:37] overcame before you got into marriage
[1:25:43] it's true be a gentleman
[1:25:47] be a gentleman hey man
[1:25:50] you can have a healthy marriage healthy
[1:25:52] relationship
[1:25:53] if you just listen to the teachings of
[1:25:55] the word
[1:25:56] and don't get impatient
[1:26:01] so you got a lot of voters out here
[1:26:05] you let me tell you young girls
[1:26:06] something that might offend you a little
[1:26:08] bit
[1:26:10] but it's going to be the truth
[1:26:13] just because you're in the atmosphere
[1:26:15] around the message of the hour
[1:26:19] it gives you a certain reflection
[1:26:22] because you're under that anointing
[1:26:26] these worldly boys know that
[1:26:30] when they see you to you
[1:26:33] they look at you as an innocent little
[1:26:37] church girl that i can easily
[1:26:40] get to just the way they view you
[1:26:44] just because of the anointing
[1:26:47] so when they come upon you and talk
[1:26:48] these words that tingling to your ear
[1:26:53] if they can't go the right way like i
[1:26:56] taught you about your
[1:26:57] pastor your dad and so forth you better
[1:26:59] stay away from that boy
[1:27:00] and let me tell you something he gonna
[1:27:02] keep talking so he can break him
[1:27:04] he can break your armor with words
[1:27:09] and you'll be like oh he's joking he's
[1:27:12] he's just fine no he working on
[1:27:16] something
[1:27:18] he just threw a little word at a time
[1:27:21] they slipped man
[1:27:25] you look so cute today ah that's all he
[1:27:28] got to say he ain't gotta say that now
[1:27:30] wait a couple days now that's stuck in
[1:27:33] your head

[1:27:43] because now you're working with your
[1:27:44] emotions you're getting attention

[1:28:52] boys are
[1:28:53] brother she's no good
[1:29:01] how many you know is contrary to
[1:29:03] scripture

[1:29:20] brought her right to him there's two
[1:29:23] women

[1:34:28] here no more
[1:34:30] and he hit the road that's protecting
[1:34:34] her
[1:34:35] now she's married got a lovely family
[1:34:38] because she waited on god
[1:34:44] we as ministers true pastors
[1:34:47] will do things like that because they're
[1:34:49] looking out for your soul
[1:34:52] that's why you work together pastor work
[1:34:54] together with your parents we work
[1:34:56] together
[1:34:57] to make sure my daughter my son gonna be
[1:35:00] safe
[1:35:00] ain't nothing get that stuff you ought
[1:35:02] to thank god for that
[1:35:04] instead of having one of these pastors
[1:35:06] oh look like a good guy to me marry him
[1:35:08] get her you when you want to set the
[1:35:10] date that's not a good pastor
[1:35:14] he just want membership
[1:35:18] huh but you ought to be thankful for
[1:35:22] that
[1:35:22] am i boring are you sleeping
[1:35:27] you get sleepy just stand up shake it
[1:35:28] off
[1:35:30] but i'm done let's give the lord
[1:35:42] i forgot to ask is anybody need prayer
[1:35:46] let me certainly pray with you let me
[1:35:49] explain something to you
[1:35:53] some meetings every meeting is not the
[1:35:57] same
[1:35:59] sometimes you have youth meetings people
[1:36:02] need deliverance
[1:36:04] power guard come down it'd be an altar
[1:36:06] call
[1:36:08] there's nothing wrong with that but
[1:36:10] there are some meetings
[1:36:12] you gotta let stuff sink
[1:36:15] get you to think about things
[1:36:18] contacts down in that soul
[1:36:22] but i do we like to offer prayer if
[1:36:24] someone need prayer
[1:36:26] if you've got something that's bound in
[1:36:27] you need deliverance
[1:36:29] i actually don't talk to you how to be
[1:36:31] delivered it's all
[1:36:33] christ you could overcome anything
[1:36:36] it's all right for a preacher to lay
[1:36:38] hands on you pray with you
[1:36:40] but we all got to come to a place in
[1:36:42] life where you can grab hold
[1:36:44] to things yourself and handle it by the
[1:36:47] word of god
[1:36:49] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:36:52] what i'm presenting to you
[1:36:53] that you can overcome anything with him
[1:36:58] god bless you thank you
[1:37:04] let's stand again praise the lord
[1:37:08] young people god has so many protections
[1:37:11] in place in the word of god for your
[1:37:12] life he loves you
[1:37:14] and he not only has them in the word but
[1:37:16] he has a minister who'll be honest and
[1:37:17] say those things to you
[1:37:20] we believe the same way brother berlin
[1:37:22] and i and these
[1:37:23] principles and boundaries and just
[1:37:25] things that build respect
[1:37:27] and we got a couple here they got two
[1:37:29] children that's the two kids that sang
[1:37:30] the night
[1:37:31] lane and kylie but
[1:37:34] lindsay was i so told this story a few
[1:37:36] weeks ago but talking about
[1:37:38] a girl watching out for herself she was
[1:37:40] at high school
[1:37:42] and kyle got his eye on lindsay and
[1:37:46] he's just in the world a worldly guy you
[1:37:49] know but he's like brother bernie says
[1:37:50] one of his got his eyes on that girl you
[1:37:52] know
[1:37:52] and so she he came and said he wanted he
[1:37:54] asked her out
[1:37:55] and she said no no no we don't do that
[1:37:58] we don't do that
[1:37:59] but you can come to church with me if
[1:38:00] you want
[1:38:02] i love that i love that story because
[1:38:06] there's a girl who's got some strength
[1:38:07] about her not just to give in to the
[1:38:09] wooing of a man
[1:38:11] because he says you're pretty or says
[1:38:12] these things and these things are
[1:38:14] text back and forth all the time be
[1:38:16] careful your words
[1:38:17] you can't back them up with a commitment
[1:38:19] you don't shouldn't loosely say things
[1:38:21] like i love you and things like that
[1:38:22] that bond
[1:38:24] save it save it for when you know it's
[1:38:26] the right one
[1:38:29] she said you come to church and so he
[1:38:31] said all right came to church
[1:38:33] saved repented saved baptized filled
[1:38:36] with the holy ghost and his family
[1:38:37] serving the lord
[1:38:38] praise god god will honor you
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:47] you know every situation is different
[1:38:50] every love story is different there's no
[1:38:52] cookie cutter thing that takes place we
[1:38:53] know everything
[1:38:55] every relationship will be different but
[1:38:56] god's boundaries don't change
[1:38:58] and the reason he talks about a boy
[1:39:00] going to the father is because it builds
[1:39:02] respect
[1:39:03] if you're going around the other way if
[1:39:05] at all possible you should talk to that
[1:39:07] man because that man's the protection
[1:39:08] over that daughter's life you can find
[1:39:09] it in the old testament
[1:39:11] he has power to even break a vow of a
[1:39:13] girl
[1:39:14] the daddy does because god gave him that
[1:39:16] authority to watch over that girl
[1:39:19] you say well what do i have to do that
[1:39:20] for all i'm telling you and brother
[1:39:22] burley is saying to you tonight
[1:39:23] so capably don't buy into the babylonian
[1:39:27] ways of how to do things
[1:39:29] do it according to the word of god and
[1:39:31] god will bless your future family
[1:39:33] and you're one that you fall in love
[1:39:35] with he bless it more if you abide by
[1:39:37] god's principles in his way
[1:39:38] you know i'd love to i can't wait
[1:39:40] someday to talk to daniel
[1:39:43] and shadrach and meshach and mendigo
[1:39:45] someday
[1:39:46] soon i'm going to be sitting down with
[1:39:48] them and they can tell me the whole
[1:39:50] story
[1:39:50] i said praise the lord brother my how
[1:39:53] did you do it
[1:39:54] live in smack dab in the middle of
[1:39:56] babylon
[1:39:57] by yourself in the kings i said i say
[1:40:00] god bless you ro
[1:40:01] god bless you let me give you a hug
[1:40:06] for not eating the purposing in your
[1:40:08] heart not to eat the king's meat
[1:40:11] but you know some of you with me and
[1:40:14] give a hug to daniel some of you young
[1:40:16] brothers and sisters give a
[1:40:17] handshake god bless you daniel we heard
[1:40:19] about you just a few months ago or last
[1:40:22] year we heard about you brother burley
[1:40:23] spoke about you again in daniel
[1:40:25] god bless you for your stand that you
[1:40:26] made and he might ask
[1:40:29] you young girl your young guy what age
[1:40:32] did you come out of
[1:40:36] what time did you come out of you say
[1:40:39] well we lived in the last stage in
[1:40:40] laodicea
[1:40:42] we lived in satan's eden it was called
[1:40:44] by the prophet
[1:40:45] your jeremiah called it babylon our
[1:40:47] prophet called the satan's eden and we
[1:40:49] lived right in the middle
[1:40:50] of it and daniel's eyes perk up
[1:40:54] and he wants to give your hand a
[1:40:56] handshake and say
[1:40:57] god bless you we did everything we could
[1:41:00] the purpose in our heart to overcome
[1:41:02] babylon
[1:41:04] but you lived in satan's eden and you
[1:41:06] overcome
[1:41:08] you didn't keep struggling with things
[1:41:10] there's a difference in struggling and
[1:41:11] overcoming
[1:41:12] people say i'm struggling you know it's
[1:41:15] a different
[1:41:16] you want to start saying i'm overcoming
[1:41:18] i'm not struggling anymore
[1:41:20] we are overcomers can you say man and my
[1:41:23] sister has that song are you she because
[1:41:25] one day they'll look at you and say
[1:41:26] are you she the bride the lead of the
[1:41:28] last days
[1:41:30] who stood the worst of times i'm looking
[1:41:33] at young people tonight are going to not
[1:41:34] just survive but they're going to
[1:41:35] overcome laodicea in this hour i'm
[1:41:37] looking at you tonight
[1:41:39] i'm looking at that bride
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:44] amen brother burly spoke to those people
[1:41:47] that'll be on the other side those young
[1:41:49] people
[1:41:50] say by the grace of god we made it
[1:41:52] through
[1:41:54] and i'm just a privilege to know you
[1:41:55] tonight and just be able to be here with
[1:41:57] you
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:41:59] one thought that i had is when daniel
[1:42:00] purposed in his heart that day he made a
[1:42:02] decision
[1:42:05] and now his friends brother said him and
[1:42:07] his friends would get together and have
[1:42:08] bible studies and encourage one another
[1:42:11] you should do that we got together
[1:42:14] encouraged one of
[1:42:14] one another in babylon that i was
[1:42:17] thinking tonight when he made that
[1:42:20] decision just a little decision
[1:42:23] i'm not going to eat the king's meat
[1:42:26] do you know that that was the beginnings
[1:42:28] of jeremiah's prophecy of redemption
[1:42:30] being fulfilled
[1:42:33] the spoken word book said jeremiah said
[1:42:35] in 70 years i'm going to bring you out
[1:42:37] of captivity i'm going to redeem you
[1:42:38] back
[1:42:39] you know what the start of it was
[1:42:41] somebody who made a decision
[1:42:44] i am not going to defile myself with
[1:42:46] this world
[1:42:49] why do you make that because there's a
[1:42:50] revelation saying that's how we got in
[1:42:53] this mess
[1:42:54] that's how we got in babylon that's how
[1:42:56] we're that's why we're in captivity now
[1:42:58] and we're away from our parents and this
[1:43:00] is how all this happened because people
[1:43:01] got away from the word of god so what i
[1:43:03] need to do
[1:43:04] is make a little decision right now no
[1:43:06] no wait a minute wait a minute
[1:43:08] i don't want your wine i don't want your
[1:43:11] meat
[1:43:12] i don't want your pornography
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:17] i don't want to be i don't want my name
[1:43:19] changed to a gamer
[1:43:24] i don't want that identity
[1:43:28] i'm purpose in my heart and that little
[1:43:30] decision began
[1:43:32] the process of redemption being
[1:43:35] fulfilled
[1:43:36] you don't realize how powerful your
[1:43:37] decisions are
[1:43:39] make a little decision towards god and
[1:43:41] all of heaven
[1:43:42] is backing you up that's reason i
[1:43:46] have decided
[1:43:49] to follow jesus
[1:43:54] yes i
