TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. the sound in lights ablaze. If that's the measure you must take to crush the idol. Jerk the pews and all the decorations too until the congregation's few then have revival. Tell your friends that this is where the party ends. Until you're broken for your sins, you can't be social. Then seek the Lord and wait for what he has in store. And know that great is your reward. So just be hopeful cuz you can sing all you want to. Yes, you can sing all you want to. You can sing all you want to and still get it wrong. Oh, worship is more than a song. [Music] Take a break from all the plans that you have made and sit at home alone and wait for God to whisper. Beg him please to open up his mouth and speak and pray for real upon your knees until they blister. Shine the light on every corner of your life until the pride and lust and lies are in the open. Then read the word and put to test the things you've heard until your heart and soul are stirred in rocks and broken. Cuz you can sing all you want to. Yes, you can sing all you want to. You can sing all you want to and still get it wrong. Oh, worship is more than a song. We must not worship something that's not even worth it. Leave the stage. Make some space for the one who deserves it. Anything I put before my God is an idol. And anything I want with all my heart is an idol. And anything I can't stop thinking of is an idol. And anything that I give all my love is an idol. Oh, cuz I can sing all I want to. Yes, I can sing all I want to. And we can sing all we want to. And we can sing. All we want to. We can sing all we want. It's wrong. Worship is more than a song. &gt;&gt; Second Kings 5 picking up again at verse 9. So non came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean." But non was wroth and went away and said, "Behold, I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper." Non had all of this preconceived in his mind how God was going to do it. And he was wrong on all points. All points. This is when our minds gets in the way of God. This is when our minds get lifted up above the ways of God and how he's going to do things. Don't underestimate how powerful the creative mind can be. But when it gets in trouble is when it interrupts the way God wants to do things. Are not then he complains about the rivers. Are not Abna and uh Farar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. And his servants came near and spake unto him and said, "My father, if the prophet had bid thee to do something great, wouldest thou not have done it, how much rather than when thou say, he saith, wash and be clean?" Then when he went down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying, the man of of the man of God, and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Elisha, which has a a a bit of a feminine she is, is he becomes a type of the bride. And in his ministry, in what he does, uh we find types in there for our lives as well. So, we want to pay close attention to that. We want to be listening. And we find then that we uh uh in the early days of Elisha, we find Elisha so consumed. I don't want to miss these points about Elisha. We find him so consumed with staying very close to Elijah. Elisha was staying very close to him. Elijah actually tried to get him and say, "You stay here and I'll go somewhere else." Elijah said, "No, I'm not going to leave you. I'm staying right with you." And then he said, "What do you want from me?" And he said, "You know what? I I'm asking for a double portion of your spirit to come on me." Talk about it's asking for big things. Even Elijah said, "My, this is a big request, but you ask it." And God gave it to him. &gt;&gt; But but look at how closely linked he wanted to be to Elijah cuz he knew that was God's man. He knew it was God's man for the hour. He knew that he was eventually leaving, but he didn't want him to leave until he said, "I want a double portion of that spirit to come on me." He asked for it. He got it. And see then we see him go and he knew the time was time for a transition going from Elijah and now the ministry being on Elisha for the work to be able to continue it the the work of the Lord did not end with Elijah. It continued in Elisha. And so when Elisha seen this change in this uh in in in this transition going on and it was going to change from Elijah to God positioning Elijah for a work to continue. The first thing he cried out while holding the mantle of Elijah. The first thing he cried out he said where is the Lord God of Elijah? First thing he says this is how close he wanted to stay to this. I want a double portion of his spirit spirit. But then he says, he takes that mantle, he actually strikes the Jordan and it opens up just like it did Elijah. Can you say amen? But he says, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" I want you to notice he didn't cry out, "Where's Elijah? What are we going to do? Elijah's gone." He did not cry, "Where's Elijah?" He cried, "I want the Lord God of Elijah." That's a big difference because we have movements among us that are trying to keep Elijah alive, trying to say maybe he's going to come back. We don't have anything. But I told you last Sunday when God sends his word through Elijah, Elijah may leave, but the word is still here. The word is still in the land. And then that the bride becomes a carrier of that word. It has all the power in it. It will not return void. It will finish his work. But how's it going to finish it? It's going to finish it in you. &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Not where is Elijah. Where is the Lord God of Elijah? &gt;&gt; It's where the Lord God of Elijah is what we want. And he called a revelation. There's a transition. And I don't need Elijah to come back. I need the Lord God of Elijah. He called a revelation. It's not to repeat Elijah again. It's not to have him come back. We're not trying to be a prophet or look for another one like that prophet. Can you say amen? We're looking now for how the God in that prophet will work through us. It's amazing how when a gift looks so similar to a discernment of a prophet, it's amazing when a gift would rise up and it looks so similar to a prophetic gift, people flock after it. I just say it safely. They have not recognized the awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; If they flock after a gift that's similar to the prophet trying to make it happen again, they have not recognize the awakening of the bride. They have not caught a revelation of the transition. &gt;&gt; And so they reach back into the past and they're looking for the same type of gift to the work. And they're reaching back into Pentecost. But that's not what Elijah's catching. He's saying, "I don't need Elijah to come back. I need the Lord God of Elijah to come help me finish this work." &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now people flock after that. I won't say much more about that, but I'm telling you, they haven't recognized and they deceive the people somewhat because they take them backwards instead of forward. Elisha didn't want to go backwards. And incidentally, if you read your Bible, uh the sons of the prophets, soon as Elijah went up in the chariot, the sons of the prophets tried to influence Elijah to go find Elijah. They said, "Isn't this interesting?" They said, "Maybe he's just took the chariot up to a mountain. If we send out a search team, you've got 50 men here." It's these these prophets, it's the ministers that are saying, "Let's try to get Elijah back. Oh, that's too true to this hour. &gt;&gt; We're nothing without Elijah coming back. The the tent, whatever's got to happen where nothing's going on. No, there's no been no revival going on. Elisha didn't think that because he just took the mantle and struck the waters and it opened up like Elijah. Don't tell me God's not around. Don't tell me the God of Elijah isn't here. The God of Elijah has performed miracle after miracle. The God, the God of Elijah has called a bride &gt;&gt; to take and carry this word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so we find that Elisha called a revelation. And these guys said, "I can't get past this point." These guys said, "Go send out and try to find Elijah again." And Elisha said, "No, don't do that." Why did he say, "No, don't do it." Because he had a revelation. Elijah's work was finished. And so now we find then the sons tried to do that. I want to finish the story there. I'm having a hard time cuz I'm I'm wanting to preach this morning these things. They said go. He said, "Don't go." Finally, it weighed on him and Elisha said, "Go on up." They went to trying to find Elijah. They couldn't find him. Well, that's because God took him in a chariot. Couldn't find him. Come back. We couldn't find him. We couldn't find Elijah. We've got to find Elijah. He said, "I told you. I told you not to go." Elisha had to stand against that spirit of idolatry in order to come into his own position. &gt;&gt; Elijah had to stand against that spirit of idolatry to find his positioning in the word of God. After Elisha then began his ministry, there were very few things that Elisha did that was similar to Elijah. Some were similar, but there were very few things. And yet Elisha has a double portion of the spirit of Elijah. You would think if he's got a double portion, all the works that Elisha is doing would be similar to Elijah, but they weren't. They were different. A matter of fact, Elijah, he's speaking to an entire generation, to the whole nation of Israel, to the politics, everything else. He rebukes Jezebel and the Jezebel system. But when it comes to Elisha, it's a little bit more personal to a widow woman, to this, to that, and the other. It's a little bit more personal. There are things that are similar, but there are things that are not similar. And here's the biggest point. Watch how God does things a little bit different to bring healing through the ministry of Elisha. Because we always think, well, he's going to do it the same way he did it before. He's going to do it. We we listen to certain things. He's going to do it this way. He did it this. And if he's done something before, he can do it again. Just don't get your mind involved to say, "I want him to do it just like he did it back in the days of Elijah." God did things different on Elisha. And what did you have to trust? Not Elisha, but trust the God that was in Elisha that when he gave a word, &gt;&gt; if it's a word of God, you better go dip seven times in Jordan. You can complain all you want to, but you better go dip in Jordan if you want to be washed. We find then that the the miracles of Elisha were a bit different and it was Elisha's ministry that healed this leprosy. Now we have one incident before this when Miriam was struck with leprosy because her disrespect towards the man of God. Her and her brother criticized the marriage of Moses. That's all they did. And uh she was struck with leprosy. And then we find that God after seven days brought her back in the camp. So obviously she was healed. But this healing was the next incident that leprosy comes up. And leprosy comes up in the Bible. It's important for us to talk about because leprosy I I want to just break it down a little bit more than I did last Sunday because we find the prophet is the one who told us that leprosy was a type of sin. There was no cure back then for leprosy. Matter of fact, last Sunday I told you it was about 1940. They they finally got a cure for leprosy. 1940s. Is God going to deal with the leprosy, the sin of leprosy, the leprosy, the sin? Is he going to deal with it in the end time? He has to deal with it. And he's not going to deal with something new. It's the same atonement from Calvary, but he's going to renew it and bring the revelation to the people. I've given you my atonement, and it is just as powerful it's ever been. And guess what? You're going to need it cuz it's a dirty age. It's a leprosy age. It's an unclean age. You're going to need to be washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Not just baptized, but your mind's going to need to be washed. &gt;&gt; Your spirit's going to need to be washed. Your emotions are going to need to be washed. &gt;&gt; And sometimes your body is going to need to be healed. &gt;&gt; The atonement, how many believe the atonement's still in action today? &gt;&gt; It's still just as real. Praise the Lord. So the prophet brought it back to this is a type of leprosy. There was no cure back then. And so because there was no cure under the Levitical law, God actually put in specifics for leprosy how to deal with it. And that's what you have to do when you don't have healing for it, a complete healing like non. Then you deal with things. You you put things in place to deal with it. And the way God dealt with it that they had to go through a process. There was an isolation for people that had leprosy, isolation from the rest of the people. They had to go outside the camp. Uh, and leprosy came in the human body. And if it was in the human body, starting in the skin, then if they came into their house, then it would get in the house, it would infect other people, it would get in the clothes, it would get in the fabrics. It It was a filthy, filthy thing. And it just begin to invade everything. And God specifically had to deal with it someday. But he gave instructions how to deal with something. Now, I want you to notice God will help us sometimes deal with something. He'll give us something to deal with something. And it's wonderful to deal with it. But always remember, God does not want you to just deal with it the rest of your life. In fact, that's what people will tell you sometimes. Just deal with it. Everybody ever heard that? What do I What do I do? Just deal with it. This is kind of a don't care attitude. &gt;&gt; Just deal with it. No, God doesn't just say deal with it the rest of his life. Rest of your life. He's got an atonement that's going to heal it until it's baby skin again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is a powerful word and atonement he's given us. Don't you ever underestimate it. And don't block it from coming in your life. &gt;&gt; So, God specifically deals with it now with a healing. And we come to the the story of non when he deals with it. And look how he deals with it. Now, here's what brother Bram said about leprosy. Leprosy, there was no cure for leprosy. They haven't found it yet. This was 1953. He says this. They they haven't found it. So, it took a while for the the cure for leprosy to get out. 1941, I think, is when they found something, but it didn't spread the word. That's probably why Brother Bram saying they haven't found the cure for leprosy. If you guys can put that quote up if you have it. They haven't found it yet. Only God can cure leprosy. They haven't found even nothing for it to help it. But it's a type of sin. It sets in so gradual. It's painless. Just moves right in and you don't know it until you're dying. It's a type of sin. And that's how sin works in our life. In our life, it's not it's painless. It moves in gradual. Just moves right in. Don't know it until you're dying. Big white warts come out and all over you. Limbs drop off and everything. Eats you right into it. Just it just eats you up. Leprosy. Jesus was the only one who could heal this leprosy. He's the only one today who could heal this leprosy. He's not just talking about the natural leprosy. He's talking about sin. Jesus is the only one that can heal this type of sin. &gt;&gt; Now, I had a couple pictures here. It starts out with a you can't even feel these rashes that come. You can't even hardly feel it. And as he said here, it's gradual and it just it's painless. You can't even feel it. Then it starts to get itchy and then but look at the final result now. Then it starts to eat away. This is sin. It starts gradual. It starts at the surface. But if you leave it there, it eventually it eats up your entire body. It takes limo. It takes the flesh off. It eats the flesh. Is anybody listening to me, young people, you listen to me, you dabble around with the things of sin. You may not feel the effects of it yet, but if you let it stay there, it's going to eat everything good out of your life. There's a word here that's continually washing the bride, cleaning the bride. &gt;&gt; And so, what I was thinking about last night as I was just looking at this and praying after we it it's hard to type this sin with the nature of sin that we're born with because the nature of sins is not something you got gradual. You were born with the nature of sin. And the atonement had to cut cut to the very core of the nature of sin. You were born with it. How many raise your hands say? I was born with the nature of sin. You didn't do anything bad to get that. You were born with it. You didn't look at the wrong website to get that type of sin. You were born with that. We were born defeated. Can you say amen? We were born losers. What a terrible thing to say. That's not politically correct. But according to our first birth, you're born a loser. You have nothing to go on. I know, brother Paul. I'm pretty good. I've made it pretty successful in life. You were born a loser. And without the new birth, you were you're you're you're going straight to the wrong place without a new birth. You try to handle your nature of sin all you want to with giving to the poor and dressing up nice on the outside and but you need a new birth and that changes your desires. It actually kills the nature of sin. It kills the spirit of unbelief that's inside you. But I don't know if this leprosy and forgive me if I'm just going off on a limb here but I don't see that sin as being gradual. That's you're born with that. That does not come gradual. this more types a slow surface rash that comes in your life of sin but if it's not dealt with it eats everything up it's a slow work this is maybe not the nature of sin but the infection of sin maybe this is not the nature of sin you're born with but this is the infection of sin is there such a thing yes I believe there is the infection of sin into our body into our spirit and into our mind so After we see his prophet's word is still in the land under Elisha, we see non who is a great man gets infected with this leprosy. And as we said last Sunday, leprosy will affect anybody. No matter how great your position, no matter who you are, he was a great warrior and all of a sudden now one day he gets these warts and things on his hands. It keeps growing. It's like he's saying, "Why me? Why do I get this? I'm a great man. I got great money." He couldn't buy his way out of it. He couldn't talk his way out of it. He got it. Which shows us that sin is not a respector of persons. Praise the Lord. And so non, he's a great man. He's saying, you know, why, you know, it's like what an inconvenience to my life. You know, it's like now this comes along. you know, life was going great and wonderful. And I just want to examine the thought patterns of non because I think it's way too close to the way we think about when something strikes us in life and all of a sudden now this isn't fair. This is an inconvenience to me. This is this this messes up my schedule. I'm a commander in the army. I've got to do this and I've got to do that. But sometimes God allows something. You see now friends, why did God allow this leprosy in non for a number of reasons. He's going to learn h have to learn how to come to the true God for healing. &gt;&gt; He's going to have to learn that he can't go to any other source except the true God. &gt;&gt; He can't buy his way out. He can't talk his way out of it. He and then but it's just this whole process of mindset. This is not fair. This doesn't belong to me. And God allows things to come in our lives sometimes that interrupt. It's inconvenient. It interrupts our schedule. I had a plan. I had a plan. Everything's got to be just so. And so you get a plan. And then God interrupts that plan. &gt;&gt; Non had a plan. And all of a sudden, the whole thing's interrupted by something pretty huge. And he can't find anything to get rid of this inconvenience in his life. &gt;&gt; That's the way God wanted it. That's the way God allowed it. Because we can't get in a mindset, I don't want any minds. I don't want any anything to infect my life. I don't want anything to change my life. Non, he's a great man. He gets infected. But he has to humble himself to how the word was going to play out for his life. And he had to have no preconceived ideas, no money paid, no seeking for great things. He needs to be made clean and the word will heal him. But he needed to take the prophet's word and submit to God's provided way for the hour. &gt;&gt; But he thought it out ahead of time. And we tend to prethink how God's going to bring deliverance. We say, "I know God heals. I know he's going to heal me." The problem is is when when non said, "Behold, I thought," where he got in trouble. And when we start to prethink how God's going to do something, we hurt God's plan. We hurt God's provided way. And non thought, I just know when I go, I just know the meeting is going to go this way. Sometimes our own unrealistic expectations or pre-planned expectations set ourselves up for disappointment. Can I get an amen? You may have done it to yourself because you told God how he was going to do it. You gave them a time frame. You gave them how it fit in your schedule. &gt;&gt; You gave all of your instructions and it's just you had it all in your mind. Maybe you didn't tell nobody, but you had it all in your mind. It's going to go this way. And he walked up and he had it all planned. I'm going to stand up there by the door. I'm knocking on the front door. And uh Elisha's going to be there standing up. Elisha. He's standing up and he's going to open the door and I'm going to stand there and Elisha is going to hit me on the head. Too scared to do it. &gt;&gt; You want me to hit you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Boy, you're a nice fella. You're not the Elisha that I want. You know, I want to be hit on the head. I'm going to stand there. The door's going to open. I'm going to have my eyes closed and Elisha's going to hit me on the head and say, "Be healed. But it's okay. I'll forgive you afterwards. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you ain't doing it. No, &gt;&gt; man. What a brother. This guy. He's a good guy. All right. Thank you. Anyway, okay. Yeah, I picked the wrong guy. Be nice. I stood there at the door and he hit me on No, no, that's not how Elisha acts. And he hit me on the head and say, "Be healed. be healed. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And that's how it's going to happen. And I want all of you servants to have your phones rolling because I want to get this all on video and post it right away. There might be, you know, lights around and everything going on and I want to get that on film so that I can post it right away. We always think it through to something great. &gt;&gt; And God had non's number to teach him. Don't you dare come to church with a preconceived idea how God's going to heal you. Don't live every day with a preconceived idea and time limits and all that. Just say, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Let him come on the scene in his own time. Let me be delivered, Lord." And Lord, I give you full sway to do it your own way &gt;&gt; for watching our service today. If you would like more information, please contact us by visiting our website, literallife.urch.
