23. with a beautiful atmosphere in the church this morning just to remind you that it doesn't depend upon us we're just grateful when a church service felt without the Lord's just a lecture that to be more or less dry depending upon the speaker but when the Lord's here we just pray that he can he does above and beyond but we can do ourselves this morning I want to take a look at one part of the Feast of atonement and that is the that is the scapegoat take a look here give me my settings right it looks like we're in business so we'll start off in the Book of Leviticus while we're standing chapter 23 and we'll start in verse verse 26. and the Lord spake unto Moses saying also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation to you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and you shall do no work in that same day if it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God for whatsoever Soul it shall be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever Soul it be that doeth any work in that same day the same soul will I destroy from among his people you shall do no manner of work that shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings that shall be into a Sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the tenth month that even from even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath so we'll take a look this is the we're in Leviticus 23 Moses goes over the feasts of the Lord and well this is the description that's given here about the day of atonement and we'll just try to look today um it will go back and another scripture it describes the offerings that are given and see how important this the scapegoat is for us perhaps we can just open the word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord I Thank you that that you have drawn on our lives fooled us here this morning Lord because as uh the Apostle Paul reminds us no man can seek after God you are you initiate Lord you initiate that I just pray you would help us to hear to respond oh God and I pray Lord wherever there might be anything in our hearts father father that we that we've kept inside and trying trying to cover our own ways Lord may we just Lord throw our sins upon that scapegoat this morning oh God we may have real atonement the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated this from the reading we just took a look at from Leviticus 26 I think a couple things we wanted to emphasize um how important it is to have atonement because if you just look at the word itself atonement is at one minute because we are where we're separated from God in our in our sinful condition we don't have that that uh that Oneness that we desire to have and you know how easy it can be to lose that Oneness I mean you can even have people in the same house sometimes Noah every now and then uh no my wife and I we can the best of buds for a while and every now and then there's those those times of friction that occur and you can be seated in the same car and you can be even patting her leg but you feel like you're patting a cactus and there's just and there's just no at one mint in in the car there and that can be how it is between us and the Lord sometimes so we're just kind of going through the motions and every time we raise our hands to try to we we know ourselves that there is no at one mint there and you know what in order for that atmosphere in the car to be uh to be uh to be changed um we tried to find this scapegoat in the modern sense of the word if you try to scapegoat it's not a one minute it's not going to be returned it's not gonna it's not gonna happen I want to take a look at this word the scapegoat because there's a way that it's used in the modern sense that is completely wrong and completely opposite to the biblical sense the word was uh the word was coined by uh um William Tyndale who translated the the Bible into English in the 1500s his vision was that the plowboy could be able to read God's word for himself and by reading it himself he would know more than any of the Catholic Bishops he wanted to put the Bible into everyday language his challenge was to take these Concepts that were in the Old Testament that were in the Hebrew Bible how could he how could he name this what was the right English translation the right concepts for this through this goat that we'll be reading about he he coined this word it's scapegoat and what we're going to look at according to Webster's the the scapegoat is a person or group that bears the blame for others and as long as my wife and I in the car are just bristling Cactus and porcupines at each other and I say it was somebody else's fault it was that person's fault that person's fault I'm seeking a scapegoat but that is not the way the Bible means that word to be used so to me it's when we look at the idea of scapegoat today there is a sense that that's inbred into us that even the modern man's day as hard as he tries to get away from any need for Calvary any need for Redemption there is still this idea someone does something wrong somebody has to pay I've got to find somebody so that I'm not the one so everybody's going to be trying to shifts the blame so that I'm not the one who has to pay so this idea of guilt and Punishment they lie deep in the hearts of men it's there and that's something we can use to uh to talk about the gospel of somebody because our hearts can testify against us our hearts testify that we need a redeemer and but the the idea the modern idea of Escape that has been so watered down that really we don't need a redeemer as long as we can find somebody else to blame it's shifting of Shifting of blame so we'll look at the Modern idea of the scapegoat for a little while and then we'll contrast it with what the Bible actually means by a scapegoat and there there is a dramatic difference but we when we look at Leviticus chapter 23 here it talks about um in verse 28 you shall do no work in the same day because you know what when we try to uh to make things right with our husbands or wives we can do our we can be on our best behavior do everything if they want but until the issue has been dealt with every single thing we do is only going to make it worse I can try I'm going to clean I'm gonna clean everything up sweeter I know you're mad at me I'm gonna do everything I can I'm gonna get this kitchen all cleaned up and she would rather I stop because everything I do to show how good I am only makes it worse and that's how this was the Lord too he says on this day of atonement don't do any work because you're doing it with the wrong heart and the longer we do good actions with wrong Hearts it's like trying to clean dishes with filthy rags because that's how our righteousness are he says no work other day ever told them because you can't atone for ourselves and that's something that we try to do so valiantly we want to atone for ourselves so that we don't have to say I'm sorry will you forgive me we try so hard but um he says it is a day you should do no work that day for the day of atonement to make an atonement for you we can't atone for ourselves atonement is made for us and it's it it's serious because if we're trying to atone for our own sins with our own actions trying to prove how good we are it says the soul that won't be doing this that won't be following God's directions just letting atonement be made for you it'll be cut off from among his people we have to accept God's atonement for us and atonement is made for us we cannot do that ourselves now if we go back uh it's in an interesting order here Leviticus 23 describes the day of atoma in brief and we'll notice is on the uh I think the 10th day of the seventh month but now we're going to go back seven chapters to Leviticus 16 and we'll just see it's describing a particular detail of the feast verse 29 says this will be a statute forever unto you in the seventh month and the tenth day of the month that's the important date so we know that this is the feast that's being talked about the day of atonement you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you again we're not atoning for ourselves the priest makes us atonement for us so I want to take a look at some of the details that that are given in Leviticus chapter 16. I will start off in the in verse in verse 8. basically it will be a bullock that's going to be offered then the priests will also take two goats and the heir and the priest will cast lots upon the Two Goats one lot is for the Lord and that goat's going to be offered as a sacrifice and the other lot is for the scapegoat so one one goat's going to be killed right away offers a sacrifice the other goat it looks like he's escaping death but that's not where the idea of the scapegoat comes from this goat's not escaping that's not the idea he's just put off to the side um so Aaron is going to kill the first goat upon which the Lord's lot fell and he's going to offer the first go for a sin offering and then that first goat's blood will be taken with the Bullocks butt that was offered before and that blood is going to be going all the way through the through the outer Court through the inner Court the priest is going to be taking this this is the one day of the year the high priest can go into the into the Lord's presence and the holiest of the holies and he's taking this this goat's blood and this and the Bullock's blood and these anointing into toning for the sins of the people then he comes back and there's one goat Still Standing because the sins have been atoned for Fellowship has been restored between God and the people but the sins are still there in a sense something has to be done with them and then in verse 10 but the goat on which the Lots fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement with him and to let him go for a scapegoat Into the Wilderness and here is we'll we'll look at it later but here the sins of the people be confessed over this goat and the scapegoat is carrying the sins of the people and to the Wilderness it's been a toned for it now the sins are being taken away all the way into the wilderness and verse said 22 talks about verse verse 21 Aaron's laying his hands on upon the goat and he's going to send him away by the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness and the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities and do a land not inhabit and he shall let the goat go into the wilderness and that's kind of the the background that we'll look at as we go further this morning but like I said the idea of of guilt the idea of punishment that's that's inbred into our hearts even modern man with a secretary and understanding we have to deal with with guilt guilt makes us feel uncomfortable and we have to find a scapegoat forest and I I always enjoy seeing where the word scapegoat comes up in the news because it's still a very active topic because I was looking this morning Auto thefts going on all over the country and three days ago Fox News highlights they wanted a scapegoat Americans are split on who's accountable for auto thefts the criminals or the car makers also now the cities who have a hard time getting enough police and allowing the police to do their jobs the crime waves going on and instead of blaming the criminals it's the car makers because they should make the cars more difficult to steal so the city is looking we have to find a scapegoat besides the criminals because if the criminals are the problem then the policing is the problem and that's an issue that we don't want to take care of so let's find a scapegoat then you've got uh my generation of this scapegoat for a male America's failures on The Huffington Post and this is each generation is comparing itself to the golden generation and yeah it's it's the uh it's the hippies fault it's the it's a Millennials fault because they're not good workers it's and everybody what's what's America's problem the youth today if they could just get some Backbone in them we're looking for a scapegoat and really um all the things that are being describing article like that it's just Sins not being dealt with that's why you're seeing so many problems in society today but we don't want to deal with that we want to shift the blame to one generation or the other and then in New Zealand uh yeah um having some economic difficulties we're going to blame the weather High Cost of Living looking for a scapegoat somewhere else so this idea of scapegoating it's uh it's not just Western even in the Hindustan times two days ago they're looking for a uh a a a a a scapegoat to account for some military difficulties the idea of Escape goes it's it's all over the place we're looking for some way to shift blame so that we don't have to bear responsibility for whatever problems are going on as I was studying I discovered a new tool that that Google has introduced Google Books you know they've they've scanned so many books into uh computers and now you can actually look to see the frequency of particular word use over time so I was curious has has the necessity or the idea of trying to find a scapegoat has that increased over time and it actually kind of has you can see like in the 1500s when Tyndale publishes his Bible he coins the word you've got to spike in how often scapegoat's being were heard in the 16th century is bibles are being printed those were the main books being printed then you see more scapegoating references but then it's interesting 1700s not too many references but then I don't know if there's this idea of wanting to shift responsibility people are taking less and less responsibility want to find a scapegoat more and more people want to find more scapegoats nowadays because we don't want to find we want to deal with a problem ourselves because really if you can find a scapegoat that's almost as good as a solution to your problem it's uh it's not that bad the secret to success in the corporate world is knowing who to blame that's a that's a big part of it um and I could remember when I worked in an office when I was in the Netherlands I I was part of a production process and when things go wrong in the production process fingers will be pointed pretty fast who dropped the ball where did it go wrong and I remember there's a big order that we were Printing and I the order got printed on the wrong thickness of material it was on a thicker material which is going to be more costly I remember when I heard about that the first thing I do is I dive into my email so I can prove that it wasn't my fault because we're going to be really quick to to protect ourselves tried to find that it was his fault it was their fault it was somebody else's fault we want to find that scapegoat we all want to avoid blame because we know the guilt if somebody's guilty you got to have payment that's and again that's just inbred into us our conscience knows if there's guilt it has to be paid for and that's just a testament that that we we need a redeemer there's something in us that longs through a redeemer and the Feast of atonement says don't try to make atonement for yourself God provided that atonement another one to air is human but to blame it on someone else that's going to be the next manager this is human nature find that this is the modern idea of a scapegoat the moderative Escape is point that finger it's their fault their fault their fault and if you can keep yourself clean you could be the next promoted one now examples of the we see lots of examples of the uh of the modern scapegoat um where does the blame usually get pushed and if you go back to the first uh it didn't take long Adam Leaf weren't even out of Eden and they were already trying to find scapegoats um neither Adam nor Eve admitted their sin they weren't open about it they searched immediately for a scapegoat someone else whom they could blame so they would have a better chance of being declared innocent and who do we often try to place the blame on yeah the dog ate my homework right or the devil made me do it according to Mark Twain God is the most popular scapegoat for our sins God made me do it if he'd wanted to stop me he he could have and we could blame our background uh this and this happened that's the way I am and and I can't change and and that can certainly be something that contributes to where we are today but we also bear responsibility for what we do today because God always makes a way of Escape so that we can so that we can change the weekends so we can break cycle so yes my background accounts for things that's not an excuse to continue on the way I am Adam said the woman you gave me Eve said the man you gave me my parents my friends we we were quick to point a finger at all of these different and all these different ones one of the most well-known examples of scapegoating throughout history um goes back to the Great Chicago Fire and this one I'm going to tell the story about uh I don't know did anybody else learn a song about Mrs O'Leary in elementary school late one night when we were all in bed Mrs O'Leary took her Lantern to her shed a cow kicked it over and winked her eye and said it'll be a hot time in the old town tonight Mrs O'Leary this Irish immigrant in the city of Chicago and there's this huge conflagration that destroyed as much of the inner city she got blamed really fast this was a great conflagration October 8th to 10th in 1871 about 300 people were killed about three and a half square miles of the city were destroyed a hundred thousand residents left homeless this is huge the fire begins around nine o'clock in the evening on October 8th in or next to a small shed that belonged to the O'Leary family the fire department once they heard about it responded quickly but due to a mistake of the night Watchman the fire department got sent to the wrong address giving a small fire time to grow into this great conflagration there was a mistake somewhere on the part of the city Administration but the focus was finding a scapegoat and uh yeah nobody liked the Irish so they served as a good one the exact cause of the fire has never been completely determined but at that time speculation grew quickly according to one journalist it all started around 8 30 1 in one of the Stalls of Mrs O'Leary's Barn where she had carelessly forgotten her Lantern and in the night as the story goes as the song goes her cow kicked the lantern over so it was easy to blame Mrs O'Leary because she was Catholic she was Irish and the journalist story spread like wildfire because people were quite willing to believe it and even in the the in this journalist stories I mean she was depicted as this as this hag as all these negative words that are just they're going to be it was it was a piece to to sell so the scapegoat's been found and Shifting the blame very conveniently but we're going to see on this years can tick by and as hard as we want to remove blame from the guilty blame has a way of always coming back and we'll see this this story is interesting 22 years afterwards in 1893 this journalist whose story sold like wildfire fire he admitted that he had made it up 22 years later he couldn't live with it hidden away he's hidden in the way it had been he'd made it up to have a sensational story to sell and that those 22 years they were terrible for the O'Leary family they moved from one side of Chicago to Other Side of Chicago they moved to Michigan they moved back because they were being hounded by the press all the time being blamed for look hundred thousand people lost their homes 300 people died because of your stupid cow the stupid Irish and that just people were willing to believe it and they just built but the question was so the journalist admits that I made it up who really started the fire everyone still pointed to Mrs O'Leary because it did happen in or near her Barn that was a fact and for her entire life she was hounded by journalists who wanted to write about the fire well in 1944 and the fire was 1871 in 1944 73 years later we can try to shift blame for a long time we can try to hide sin for a long time but it's not going to work 73 years later a man named Louis Cohn admitted that the fire that he was there when the fire started and Mrs O'Leary's shed he was there were some buddies playing cards and Mrs O'Leary came out to chase the boys away and as he gets up to take the take the gambling Kitty with him as he gets up he kicks the lantern over by accident and that's what started it 73 years later and then in 1997 126 years after the fact this is still going on the Chicago city council declares Mrs O'Leary completely innocent based upon historical research I think this is really a neat story just because it shows we can try to blame somebody we can try to shift it shift it shift it but guilt has a way of always coming back to the correct party we can try to find the scapegoat and scapegoating today is try to shift blame shift blame shift blame but if blame is never connected to the guilt it's gonna be like two magnets you can try to keep those two magnets away from each other but blame is going to come back at a certain time that's just a principle of the Lord so the the modern concept of the scapegoat emphasizes blame or guilt instead of sin it's all about Shifting the blame in the modern conception of a scapegoat it's shifting blame but the the biblical perception of the Gate of the Escape group couldn't be further from that it's completely opposite the biblical perception of the escape code doesn't talk about the blame it's not a blame goat it's a sin goat in the modern society deals with the blame tries to move out of the way so we don't have to deal with sin but the Bible says hey don't worry about the blame let's deal with the sin it's called a it's called the sin go and guilt blame and sin Belong Together the guilt blamements and you can you can try as hard as you want to separate them but you will never succeed in shifting your sin over to somebody else it might temporarily to make somebody else is getting blamed but if there's a sin issue their guilt will always come back to the sin that bore it always we we we cannot separate the two so the scapegoat modern perception is it's you it's you it's you it's you it's the pointing finger but numbers reminds us be sure your sin will find you out we can't separate our blame and our and our guilt it's going to work like a uh like a boomerang that Boomerang I think out of the Australian Outback you can use it to hunt if you throw it right and it'll come right back to you it's going to come it's going to come right back and this is what happens you want to happen when you're hunting but when you're using when you're trying to find a scapegoat and you're not dealing with sin you're shifting blame it's that Boomerang you're gonna try to get somebody else that's going to come come come come back it'll come right back to you that's how that scapegoat works uh David a man after God's Own Heart but he sure messed up big innocent with Bathsheba he does his best to shift the blame for the baby that Bathsheba is is carrying he invites Uriah I was talking about this in Bible classes last week I mean if you think about what David did he and Uriah had been through a lot together they'd Had Each Other's backs on the field they'd been through thick and thin together and then you're not just stealing somebody's why if you're stealing you're one of your best friends wife and David did this and so he gets he gets Bathsheba pregnant and then he sends off Messengers to to joab so that Uriah can come back to Jerusalem so that David can make it look like this baby is Urias he's trying to do everything he can to shift the blame for the baby to shift the responsibility for the baby to Uriah but Uriah he he had no party he didn't play alone he did he didn't even go down to his house I'm on duty King I'm going to stay right on your doorstep I'm not going to go to home so David ends up having Uriah killed and then I just imagined David because Nathan how long does he bear this he Bears this sin of lust the sin of adultery the sin of murder he Bears this for months and he's this whole time he still has this responsibility of being Israel's king of being Israel's song leader he still has to maintain the the image of going to church and every time he takes his harp and tries to praise God his thoughts condemn him terribly and I when you just when you when you place yourself in his shoes I mean he had been he he was Tangled in the web of his own making he he the more that he tries to get out of it the more he gets caught that's why the Bible tells us we can't atone for ourselves because when we try to atone for ourselves we're just getting ourselves caught up even more in sin we can't do it so I just think about David here as someone who's who's got to he's trying to bear his own sin trying to trying to trying to be king trying to be a worship leader and he just feels terrible on the inside and knowing what he knew having been through that he can write a Psalm like this blessed to see whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered it doesn't say blessed is he who has covered his sin it doesn't say that because David knew all about covering his own sin and he was not blessed he had every kind of problematic he was fighting all kinds of mental battles everything because he was trying to cover his own sin and it wasn't working but blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven oh to know the Forgiveness of Christ that we are completely our sins are separated from us as far as the East is from the West bless is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose spirit is no guile then verse 3 I think describes someone who's been carrying their own sin for so long when I kept silence I covered it up my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long his heart his conscience is screaming at him and he does everything he can just to keep his mouth shut because he doesn't know what he's going to say if if he opens it he's going through that he's going through anguish because he's trying to cover his own sins we're not made to cover sins we were made to live in Eden we were made to live in a perfect environment but then through the fall we're carrying these things that we were never created to carry but God I mean it was I mean God through his his Mercy provides an atonement he provides a way of Escape so that we don't have to carry that anymore for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of Summer he couldn't even cry anymore he'd cried every tear he could but as long as he's just keeping it inside it doesn't produce anything the good cry didn't help but finally I acknowledged my sin unto thee and David said finally I stopped doing this I stopped pointing to this person or that person finally I said Lord it's me finally I acknowledge my sin to thee my iniquity have I not hid for a long time David tried to cover his own sin tried to find the scapegoat here there wherever but finally he acknowledged his sin he confesses that not his transgressions to the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin think about that meditate about that we can be sometimes so reluctant so hesitant to confess something to the Lord I can remember when I was I was probably my between job or Lynn's age and I was my brother and I were playing down the basement of our house and I can remember something happened and the leg of an end table in one corner of the basement I'll put in the passive voice got broken yes when the politicians make apologies they say mistakes were made they don't say I may I I goofed enough but somehow the leg of the table got broken and I was just angry because now we're going to tell Mom and Dad about this and you can be so you you try to it's just terrible but then when you finally go back to ah Mom Dad we broke the leg we did it we're sorry and sometimes the thing that we're most afraid of the vindictiveness of daddy rips off his belt no that didn't happen that didn't happen we can be so afraid of that we could be so afraid if we confess our sins to God what's God going to do it's gonna be like this Pagan God who throws a thunderbolt no no God has compassion for our condition David finally acknowledges his sin he stops the show of covering it up and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin we can try to cover it up as much as we want to but sin is going to be dealt with first Timothy 5 24 says some men sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after but either way the sins come because sin and blame guilt they belong together and I want my sins blame and guilt to come together now so I can deal with them now before God I don't want them following after I'm going to talk for a few minutes about what happens with this biblical scapegoat so we could we have the idea that you have these these like we shared before we have these two goats and uh have they both come forward and there's a uh there's a lot that's drawn so we can I know what they did they flip a coin whatever but there's a lot drawn and one goat's going to become the uh the sacrifice who's killed immediately and then after that there's another goat who becomes the escape goat and um I need a escape goat Marcus would you be a scapegoat this morning wonderful wonderful I need a good escape goat so this the scapegoat Marcus has just seen the others the other goat being killed right before his eyes I mean his as as the priest goes and kills this goat I mean the blood might be spattering upon Marcus upon the scapegoat and he's just wondering what is going to happen next this is this is a scary thing and at first um when Marcus sees the first goat being killed and everybody leaves Marcus like everything's fine but then the guy comes back the priest comes back and the marker starts getting nervous because maybe everything's not fine because what happens now priest takes this scapegoat and he prays over the scapegoat and Leviticus 16 22 tell us what happens or 1621 Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their sins and all their transgressions in all their sins putting them upon the head of the goat and will send them away by the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness I just always wondered me a little innocent lamb like this and the and the imagery of a priest putting his hands upon him and notice when I put when the priest put his hands on the goat he's not doing this because this is the modern idea of what scapegoating is finding blame but what the biblical idea is we were with open hands it's me who did it I'm the one who's in need of prayer and with Open Hands I put I'm the priest is transferring all of the sins upon this animal and I just have to wonder this is an animal who never knew guilt for anything this is an ant an animal can't do all these sins and I just have to wonder what must that animal have felt as the priest is confessing the transgressions the iniquities and he's naming them I just wonder what goes on in the animals body because all that's happening he's confessing confessing confessing it's all transferred over to the goat and then the Bible says the priest summons a fit man he doesn't someone somebody who's who's been the couch potato all year long he summons a fit man and that's important because this next job this goat who is now carrying all the he's feeling things he's never felt before he's being taken by this man into an uninhabited place of the wilderness this goat is leaving all the things that he's used to he's leaving the Comforts of hope he's leaving the Tabernacle areas leaving the camp of Israel and he's got to be taken out into the A wilderness place where there are lions and tigers and bears everything that makes him feel really scared so the fit man why does the Bible say a fit man instead of just any man well it's not going to be easy if you've got an animal that doesn't feel real safe he wants to stick with you it's going to be hard to leave him in the wilderness so that I'm going long I'm taking Marcus Into the Wilderness and I'm taking them taking and said now you just go you just go but Marcus he's scared so he turns around he tries to come back I said no I'm supposed to leave you in the wilderness you got to go get going bud but he gets scared again and he comes back his bad bad bad and I'm really upset because I've got supper waiting on me at home I'm sick and tired of this I said you get to go I'm going to throw you in the wilderness get out of here and then he comes back again I've got I I can't come back to the camp with this goat because this goat is carrying everybody's sins if this goat comes back the sins are still with us we're not atoned for I've got to get this go completely gone so I just I'm mad at the goat I do everything I can I get rocks I get Stones get out of here yell get out get out of you stupid go get out and finally he's so afraid of me he just runs crying all the way back to his parents thank you Marcus it was a very difficult task take that go into the Wilderness and make sure he stayed there that's why the Bible says a fit man had to do that because it could be a long process a night a hint that it might have been a really hard and difficult process is seeing how that tradition changed over time because you know what you do the last thing you want if I've taken this school out into the wilderness finally get back I'm lying in bed at night I don't want that happening I do not want that goat to be back because those sins have to be gone that's the picture of the scapegoat he's carrying the sins out into the Wilderness and it's that fit man's job to make sure they never get back that this was hard so we can see how this tradition changed in Jesus's time at that time you could look in the the I think the the inishna at that point they didn't take the goat Into the Wilderness they took the goat up to a high cliff and just pushed it over because that was much easier to take care of the problem because it was really hard to keep that goat from not coming back but the sins had to be gone but first of can we see that there is a difference between the modern blame goat and the biblical scapegoat because when I'm looking to blame somebody all I'm looking for is that email that shows I said the right thing you had to do that I'm just you're the one at part but the scapegoat the biblical sin goat you're going with Open Hands into your confessing Lord it's me I have done wrong all the iniquities the the children of Israel are confessing we are the guilty ones that was the reason of the day of atoma so they could afflict their souls and see where where my left give the Holy Spirit a chance Lord if there's something I need to make right let me make it right so like I I I can do this but the biblical scapegoat is a single where you're open all the iniquities of the children of Israel their own righteousnesses are being acknowledged all their transgressions aggressions the steps across God's law that may have been small at first it were still steps in the wrong path these things had to be acknowledged all their sins the end results of the wrong steps all these things because man's sin and God's holiness couldn't exist that's why these sins had to be taken out of the camp we can't have both sin and God's holiness it's one or the other now once in the desert this uh this goats well this goat wasn't like a dog or a cat who always tended to find its way home that was the point because the goat didn't have a vagabond's existence in the wilderness generally we have a very short existence because the Lions or Tigers of bears the Predators would make easy prey of this goat he would likely be torn to pieces that first night and he would be torn to pieces and more importantly all the sins that the goat bore would be destroyed as well and that was the point that was the point that's what it's all about the scent of the Israelites were transferred over to the goats and he carried them into the desert where they could be destroyed and after that the sins no longer existed they were gone they were completely dealt with an accuser who could come back and and hire his private investigators try to find evidence for the crime but he could find no evidence because all the evidence had been destroyed there was no longer evidence of a crime the sin itself had been destroyed and we know that in the Old Testament this is a picture of what Jesus Christ does for us and and that picture is valuable Jesus Christ he is our scapegoat and we know that we're talking goat I thought Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God he was and the Redemption is such a such a beautiful all-encompassing thing it can be it'll be symbolized in multiple ways yeah I could find it here but um I think this is an interesting statement from Brother Branham he says we were goats yeah sometimes we have a pretty goatee nature but he became goat for us he became sin for us that's the reason he had to be punished the way he was because all of our sins were placed on him thank you and then when he died on the day of his death they took him down there off the cross and they put him in the grave and he laid there from Friday afternoon till Sunday morning on that wonderful Easter morning when he arose again and his soul was loosened from the prisons of hell down yany where he went as a sinner for you and I bearing our sins to give us a perfect Assurance he Jesus the the Wilderness in the Old Testament where that goat was led was a picture of hell and because hell was was created to destroy and Jesus was sent there but hell did not destroy Jesus the sins were destroyed but hell was not destroyed he went there bearing away our sins to give us a perfect assurance and you can imagine this fit man who takes to go into the Wilderness and if he hears a bleeding goat in the middle of the night he has no perfect Assurance because the sins aren't gone but if he has if that goat never comes back if he never hears those things again he has an assurance he can wake up next morning my sins are gone I've got I've been my sin has been atoned I could once again have fellowship with God and that's the kind of assurance that we can have Jesus Christ Resurrection shows that his his sacrifice was sufficient he went and the sins were destroyed but he was not he lived to tell the tale and because he did that his soul was cast into hell because he was a Castaway he was The Escape of the Old Testament they put the sins of the people upon the scapegoat turned him out into a Wilderness to die Jesus was that scapegoat who had the sins of the people upon him he was cast away went and held or suffered the tortures his body went into the grave to pay the price of our Resurrection Jesus took our sins he bore them out of the city he was abandoned by all the disciples he was left alone to suffer just like that goat left alone completely to suffer Jesus he was abusively treated mocked just like I had to abusively treat Marcus yell at him kick him sorry bud throw things at him and finally that goat got the point that this isn't a safe place to be I'd rather be out there Jesus was abusively treated mocked scourged just like that goat who was taken out into the wilderness and Jesus truly went into the Wilderness he went into hell and just like Samson was persecuted by the Philistines Jesus Christ was tormented by the Devils but they couldn't keep him there just kind of like the like the Hebrew boys who went into the fiery furnace the only thing that furnace did was destroy the ropes when Jesus goes into hell the only thing hell did was destroy the sin it couldn't destroy him it couldn't touch him his sinless body suffered and died and all the sins that jesus carried were also destroyed and that he is resurrected and shows that it was accepted so for us today we could say yeah I don't want to carry my own sin I don't want to cover my sins I don't want to excuse my sins I don't want to find somebody else to blame for my sins only thing that we can do is confess them to Jesus and let that scapegoat that the true scapegoat carry them into the wilderness that go to the Old Testament bore upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited just like Jesus Christ surely he hath borne our griefs he hath carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed both the lamb and the Goat provide this picture and then what happens to those sins in those days saith the Lord the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserve the look for the sin but they won't be able to be found and I was uh I've I've I think I've shared before that was asked a question one time why is the Old Testament so much longer than the New Testament and one reason is uh yeah the Old Testament gives much more detail about a person's life the New Testament does it gives ups and the Downs The Faults the warts all those things it gives us those things but the funny thing happened to Matthew 28 Jesus says this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is remission of sins and all those things that I just kind of Imagine for myself the Old Testament Saints like the dragon almost like a ball and chain for their experience because they know the things they did wrong and they know it's yeah it's sacrificed what they they it's still there and they're dragging us along and you if we would hired to ask you do a memory Association exercise we were to think of David or some some of the things we'd think of we might think right away of Goliath somebody might think of Bathsheba because those things are associated people think of Samson where you think a lot of negative association that are connected with him right away if you think of Gideon you might think about that timid young man who is fearful to obey God right away there are things that can be that we can make that connection all those negative things that can be connected with us and we look at ourselves in the mirror what might we think of right away might not be God's thought about us but all those things are connected in the Old Testament Saints they're dragging these things and then all of a sudden there's this Blood Veil and they can be dragging it through though then once Jesus offers himself as a sacrifice for sin is Old Testament States staff that blood Veil and the sins gone they can worship they've got peace they've got rest they can go into God's presence any time they want to in the Old Testament only the high priest only once a year could go directly into God's presence with this elaborate ceremony was followed but once we've stepped through the New Testament of God's blood those connections the devil might try to make those connections again those associations with things we did in the past here there but no they're gone because Revelation 1 5 talks about how Jesus Christ hath loosed us from our sins in his own blood the connection between us and the sin is broken by the blood of Jesus Christ so there can be search made for the sins but they will not be found because they have been atoned for God always makes a way of Escape every time and brother Graham talks about the message making a way he says God makes a way of Escape every time he says sickness continue into corner Satan pins you down to a place after you become a Christian maybe he says maybe you've been a gambler you see he says the cards are on the table come on John you know what's in you Satan is it attempt you to go back but God in every time he will make a way of Escape if you'll accept it the sins are gone the devil wants to lure you back into him but we have that way of Escape still today message lying dying buried Rising coming brother Graham says he was he was also buried in this they have this sin offering at the cleansing of the sanctuary and that sent off and they took the Two Goats one goat was killed the other goat had the sins that was placed from the dead goat put in the live goat he says remember Jesus was a sheep he was a lamb but in this case he became a goat he was righteous because he was God the Sheep but he also became a goat a sin that he might be that sin offering for me for me and you from a sheep to the goat I just think that's a that that's a wonderful thing why does he do that so that we can be free that we can have at one minute atonement Union again with him but the banham says that person's got a right to be free he's talking about somebody who might come with him and be bound and possessed he's I looked at Calvary I know that Jesus Christ paid the price he did it there that person's got a right to be free Satan can't hold them any longer and if you could get them to see not their aches or their pains or some preacher praying for them or some holy church that's all right that goes with it but the main thing is to see what Christ did for you you're free and to me that's the point of the service this morning is to see somewhat dramatically what did Christ do for me he took my sins he took my iniquities he took my he bore them all upon himself and he carried them away so the association between me and my sin to be broken completely and he gave me his righteousness so I am associated with everything that is then good wonderful righteous it's imputed to me it's almost like somebody who were to have a uh um who would who have made lots of terrible financial decisions but then she gets married and she marries a guy with really good credit all of a sudden his credit is in a sense imputed to her she can enjoy things that she never would have been able to do on her own because his credit is being imputed to her that's what happens when Christ righteousness is imputed to us he says brother said how could I be saved get rid of sin as long as we're doing this we're trying to get rid of sin our own way but the day ever told me I said anybody who does any work it'll be a curse we can't atone for ourselves is how can I be saved get rid of sin he was the sin offering for me so he died now if sin is if sin is dead then bury it he carried my sins far away he was a scapegoat that went out and the scapegoat took the sins of the people on him went into the Wilderness to die go out there took the sins of the people took them far away so did Jesus he took the sins of the people carried them far away so that he put them in the sea of God's forgiveness if sin is dead then bury it when we come to the altar in a way of repentance we're saying Lord forgive me forgive me for my sin I confess that I'm unable to do anything that pleases you ah the best thing I do on my best days are our filthiness compared to your righteousness I confess that forgive me Lord and then God does something he he he he he kills that that uh that that that that that that carnal man then he says but if if if if it's dead bury it and that's the that's the next step in Romans 6 the Apostle Paul talks about baptism baptism is is a picture of bearing you you take somebody you bury them and you leave everything that was dead in the water and then just like Christ was buried he's also resurrected in New Life and that's that's that that's that is the picture who want to be delivered so one half want to die to sin get rid of sin one last uh statement before we uh before we close musicians can come but uh it's a it's a it's a simple thing when we try to atone for ourselves we saw the quote from Sir Walter Scott what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive when we try to atone for ourselves things get complicated but when we accept the atonement of Christ it's a beautifully gracefully simple atonement and the message sir is we would see Jesus brother I don't care if you don't even know your ABCs the only thing you have to have is a humble submitted heart to God and God will work his will through you that's what he's looking for someone who is like a child such as we'll learn you don't have to know a whole lot you only have to know one person that's the Lord Jesus to know him is life that's the only person you have to know to have eternal life to know him not know the book nor the Creeds but know him now him as your personal savior no him is the understood you with his goodness and mercy that sent the world away from you discharge you sent it away like the scapegoat in the Old Testament to go into the Wilderness and to be killed to be no more and the very thing that made you sin and do the things that that you used to do has been driven from you by his Precious Blood that sanctifies you that sets you aside for his service that he might will his will through us to work through us it's just that simple God gave us his best when he gives us a scapegoat and that's the picture today we don't want to tone for ourselves we don't want to take this modern blame goat idea if we're always trying to shift the blame we want a real scapegoat and God wants to deal with the real issue I'm the one Forgive Me Lord let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace and I thank you for these pictures in the Old Testament that can sometimes or dramatize it make it so so plain what you did when you went to Calvary when you were when you were forsaken by your disciples just like that goat was forsaken in the wilderness and Lord you who knew no sin the sin of the world was transferred upon your shoulders Lord that when I do something wrong and my conscience bothers me well that can be just a terrible thing like David described as roaring within us all day long our bones can shake it seems like and how much more that must have been for you who had never known a guilty a guilty feeling like that because you hadn't sinned that you took all that on the cross for us thank you Lord and father I pray that Lord if we see today Lord It's Your Holy Spirit might search in our hearts if there are places where we see yes I've been playing a Blame Game and I've been covering sin or pushing sin away Lord help us to stop that help us to stop weaving that tangled web and just go with open Palms like the high priest did as they forgive me Lord forgive me my transgressions my iniquities all my sins that we might know our sins are gone completely gone Lord I pray that you would be with each each boy and girl Lord each teenager each Mom and Dad Lord father how easily the devil tries to get into our lives I pray oh God if there's places where we've covered up sin whether we could do house cleaning and get it out and let that be taken from us oh God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen what song is it yesterday let's stand You Are My Strength when I am weak you are the treasure that I Seek You Are My All In All seeking you as a precious

I just think it's such when you look at that song everything that he took from us taking my sin my cross my shame we can feel so desolate and it's gone I remember that first night went to Louisiana Camp I was in the back row of the church I felt terrible brother Paul had been preaching I felt terrible I'd always been a guy who would clap his hands and sing I I couldn't do it anymore I was under conviction I felt terrible then finally make my way up to the front I was in the worst possible place in the middle of the row because everybody knows you get out when you're in the middle of the road but I came up I never altered it was gone it was gone I get up afterwards I felt lighter than the feather it was gone all those things were used to carrying they were gone still does today and he doesn't we remember our sins but he doesn't he doesn't and when we know that we can sing We can worship Worthy is he it's a wonderful thing amen he has forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood of the land lamb of Calvary [Music] he has forgiven me he has forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood of the Lamb of calvary [Music] he has forgiven me amen maybe just one more song for brother Michael comes but you ask me why I'm happy I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone I thought they were always before me David said my sin is ever before me but once God took care of it it was gone we can rejoice and be happy amen you ask me why I'm happy so I just tell you why because my sayings are gone and when I meet the scoffers who asked me where they are I say my things are gone [Music] up across of Calvary a story move as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise God my Saints are gone twice at the old-time altar where God came in my heart and now my Saints are gone the Lord took full possession the devil did depart and glad my Saints are gone they're underneath the blood out the cross of Calvary as far removed darkness is from down name a sea of gods forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise God my Saints are gone when Satan comes to tempt me and tries to make me doubt I say my sins are gone you got me into trouble but Jesus got me out and glad my sins are gone [Music] that's good enough for me praise God my sins [Music] oh Emily I'm believing now for Jesus am happy night and day big house my sins are gone my soul is filled with music with all my heart I say I know my scenes are gone they're underneath the blood of the Cross of Calvary as far remove as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone [Music] amen praise the Lord hallelujah thank you for the rap thank you so much um you guys don't know this this sermon is Timely amen God doesn't want anything to stand up to us on him we just want us to let go and may you make mistakes you've done something wrong you know and that guilt is always there because you're a child of God and every time we do something around the Holy Ghost just sticks his flight on to correct that wrong and all his accents just come back to the altar again and what a brother said is just timely until David add that unto David you know made his life right with beer things were not right in his heart down his heart it was just losing it and for unbelievers it's nothing they can do whatever they want to do and they'll feel no guilt but because we're God's children it will bother us condemn us inside us and when it comes like that I think we should just let go I'm gonna talk about just you I'm talking about me too I'm included so because the devil knows one thing if he can't destroy you it won't destroy the work the the fruits of your life and all I can do is just put that same for you all the time like Bible says then like is the accuser of the Brethren it will always accuse you of your wrong but the moment you can step forth in faith and bold and Sam bring whatever is standing between you and the Lord and bring to the Lord he said it's just an able to do what to forgive all not just some all of our sins so going back again listen to that sermon again because I believe God spoke to this man today amen he don't know bro I believe God did amen amen [Applause] he was wounded for our transgressions [Music] he was bruised gritty peace surely [Music] born our sorrows and by his stripes we are everything this morning this morning oh he was wondering for our transgressions [Music] a surely he born [Music] is tribes we one more time raise your hands and just sing the song the Lord oh he was soon there for our transgressions he was bruised [Music] surely oh surely people are [Music] sorrows and by his tries we are here amen praise the Lord with this missing Jesus name God bless you will see you glory on Wednesday below Terrace amen can you go down a little bit [Music] the Harry Harry I found didn't feel we blind drawn from the Emmanuel's wings and sinners [Music] stays and seen Us blind beneath the blood Luther
