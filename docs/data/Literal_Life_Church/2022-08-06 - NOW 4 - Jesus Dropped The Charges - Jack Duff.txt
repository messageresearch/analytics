Description:
#NOW4 #christianmusic 
On August 6, 2022, we gathered for another Night of Worship (NOW Vol 4.) This live recording is the fourth in a series done at Literal Life Church. All we can say is “what an incredible evening!”. The over 400 in attendance will never forget how special the Lord came into the service. After the song “Hallelujah From The Valley” we began to sing the simple chorus, “Hallelujah”. The Lord must have been pleased as He swept through the place and baptized us in His presence. As they say, there's nothing like being there, but we trust the special anointing on each song will come through as you listen.

Literal Life Church Choir, under the direction of Kenny Slachta, welcomed special guests MB (Message Believers) Youth Choir, Pastor Jack Duff (West Palm Beach, Florida), and Pastor Isiah Brooks (Des Moines, Iowa). MB Youth Choir is under the direction of Lys Paul Lukuka (Des Moines, Iowa). MB Choir is a virtual choir that began during COVID and includes members from all over the world. Many choir members from all over the United States, United Kingdom, Trinidad, and several countries in Africa were in attendance at this concert. Over 1,200 connections live-streamed the evening online for the recording representing over 36 countries! Praise God!

Pastor Paul LaFontaine of Literal Life Church was the hosting Pastor.

Worship with us! He’s Worthy!

Lyrics:
I was guilty (guilty)
Of all the charges
Doomed and disgraced
But Jesus (Jesus)
With his special love (special love)
Saved me by his grace
He pleaded (pleaded)
And pleaded (pleaded)
He pleaded my case
(Am so glad that.)
Jesus dropped the charges
Jesus dropped the charges
Now am saved through grace and faith.
I was guilty (guilty)
For so long (so long)
Lived in sin too long
But Jesus (Jesus)
With his special love (special lo...
