[8:47] the Lord. We'll sing. Um wouldn't take
[8:49] nothing from my journey now, but I was
[8:51] going to continue on with that beat, but
[8:53] I find myself with this song. I fumble
[8:56] over my words way too often. Way too
[8:59] often. There's a lot of words in this,
[9:01] so I wanted to slow it down just a tad.
[9:05] So,
[9:06] same key. Ready? Well, I wouldn't take
[9:10] nothing for my journey now. I'm going to
[9:14] make it to heaven somehow. Though the
[9:17] devil turns me and tried to turn me
[9:19] around,
[9:22] he's offered everything that's got a
[9:25] name, all the wealth I want. World of
[9:28] fame if I could still wouldn't take
[9:31] nothing for my journey now. Why don't we
[9:33] go and greet each other tonight singing
[9:35] well wouldn't take nothing for my
[9:37] journey now. Got to make it to heaven
[9:41] somehow. Though the devil temp
[9:44] me around.
[9:47] He's offered everything that's got a
[9:50] name. All the wealth I want world fame
[9:53] if I could but still wouldn't take

[10:14] name. All the wealth I want. world of
[10:16] fame if could still wouldn't take love
[10:19] on a journey now.
[10:22] First verse. I started out traveling for
[10:25] the Lord many years ago.
[10:29] I had a lot of heartache, met a lot of
[10:31] grief and woe. Oh, but when I would
[10:36] stumble, then I would humble down.
[10:40] I can say thank you, Lord. I wouldn't
[10:42] take nothing for my journey now.
[10:46] Well, I would take another for my
[10:48] journey now. Got to make it to heaven
[10:51] somehow. Though the devil takes me and
[10:54] tried to turn me around.
[10:57] He's offered everything that's got to
[11:00] name all the wealth I want. World of
[11:03] fame could still would take another
[11:06] journey now.
[11:09] Well, there's nothing in the world that
[11:11] ever will take the place of God's love.
[11:14] All the silver and gold can never by a
[11:17] mighty touch from above.
[11:20] But when my soul is healing, I begin to
[11:23] feel in his power. I can say, "Thank
[11:27] you, Lord. I wouldn't take nothing for
[11:29] my jour."
[11:32] Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my
[11:34] journey now. Got to make heaven somehow.
[11:39] The devil tempts me and tried to turn me
[11:41] around. Hallelujah. He's offered
[11:45] everything that's got a name. Wealth, I
[11:48] want the world of fame. But if I could
[11:50] still wouldn't take nothing for my
[11:52] journey now.
[11:56] Hallelujah.
[11:58] Praise the Lord. You may be seated
[12:00] tonight.
[12:03] Amen.
[12:05] That reminds me of just along that same
[12:08] same thought. Wouldn't take nothing from
[12:10] my journey. I can't turn back on him. I
[12:12] like that song. Let's sing that one or
[12:13] two. I can't turn back on him.
[12:19] I've turned away from sin.
[12:24] I walk with him every day.
[12:29] There's just no other way.
[12:33] While bridges behind me burn,
[12:38] pressing ahead will be my earth.
[12:43] Have you been there? I've reached the
[12:46] point of no return.
[12:50] First verse, when I think of all the
[12:55] Lord has done for me, yes, Lord,
[13:00] his holy prevailed. So I can walk in
[13:05] victory
[13:09] since I've touched the cross and felt
[13:13] the pain he bore.
[13:16] Oh yes.
[13:18] forsaking all my life before.
[13:23] I've set out for heaven shore to go with
[13:28] him all the way,
[13:31] never to return again to yesterday.
[13:37] Sing it with all your heart tonight. Oh,
[13:39] I can't turn back on him.
[13:44] I've turned away from sin.
[13:47] Oh, I walk with him every day.

[14:14] Having put my hand to the plow, I won't
[14:19] look back. Hallelujah.
[14:23] Nothing behind could ever match what I
[14:27] now have.
[14:30] Oh,

[19:53] Kath. Jesus,
[19:57] lamb of God,
[20:02] worthy
[20:04] is your name.
[20:11] Jesus,
[20:15] lamb of God,
[20:20] worthy
[20:22] is your name.
[20:26] Just the first verse. You are my
[20:28] strength. Oh,
[20:30] you are my strength. When I am weak, you
[20:34] are the treasure that I seek. You are my
[20:40] all in all.
[20:47] Seeking you as a precious jew to give up
[20:53] be a fool. You are my all in all.
[21:01] Worship him now. Oh Jesus,
[21:07] lamb of God,
[21:11] worthy
[21:13] is your name.
[21:19] Oh Jesus,
[21:23] the lamb of God.
[21:28] Worthy
[21:30] is your name,
[21:34] God.
[21:36] Worthy
[21:38] is
[21:39] your name.
[21:43] Oh Jesus,
[21:48] lamb of God,
[21:52] worthy
[21:54] is
[21:56] your name. Give us one of those verses
[21:58] again. I love those. Give us a verse.
[22:01] You are my strength when I am weak and
[22:06] you are the treasure that I seek. You
[22:10] are my all
[22:12] and all.
[22:16] Yes.
[22:18] Seeking you as a precious jewel, Lord.
[22:22] To give up. I'd be a fool. You are my
[22:27] all and all. We worship you Lord. Oh
[22:33] Jesus.
[22:37] Lamb of God.
[22:41] Worthy.
[22:43] Worthy is your name.
[22:46] Yes Lord
[22:48] Jesus.
[22:52] Lamb of God,
[22:56] worthy
[22:58] is
[23:00] your name.
[23:05] Praise the Lord. We invite your
[23:07] attention in the Bible tonight to
[23:08] Matthew chapter 24. We're going to read
[23:10] in three places. And God bless you
[23:13] tonight for fellowshipping together. You
[23:15] can open your Bibles in your homes as
[23:16] well, wherever you're at. Matthew
[23:18] chapter 24. And we're going to read a
[23:21] few verse uh one two verses here and
[23:23] then Luke 21 end time scriptures and end
[23:26] time characteristics and then go to
[23:28] Hebrews 2 and 3. So three places Matthew
[23:31] 24:10 says and then shall many be
[23:34] offended and shall betray one another
[23:37] and shall hate one another. So the the
[23:39] time of the end time of course is a a
[23:41] time of betrayal. So keep that in mind.
[23:43] It's a time of betrayal. And then he
[23:46] says in verse 11, many false prophets
[23:49] shall rise and shall deceive many. So
[23:52] now we have a characteristic of
[23:53] deception and there are false prophets
[23:56] in the name of the true word and in the
[23:59] name of exc I should say under the name
[24:02] sometimes of Christianity. But the
[24:04] problem with false prophets is when they
[24:06] rise as they cause deception. And then
[24:09] verse 12 says, "And because iniquity
[24:11] shall abound, the love of many shall wax
[24:15] cold." Luke 21 and:e 16, it's also Jesus
[24:20] speaking about the end time as well.
[24:22] Luke 21 and verse 16.
[24:25] One verse of scripture here says, "And
[24:27] ye shall be betrayed
[24:31] both by parents and brethren and kins
[24:33] folks and friends, and some of you shall
[24:36] they cause to be put to death." And then
[24:40] if you would turn over to me to Hebrews
[24:41] chapter 2 and verse three, and we'll add
[24:43] this one in. It is if you've been now,
[24:45] some of you are following along in the
[24:47] message. He cares. Do you care? Some of
[24:49] you agreed to listen to that. And now
[24:51] that you're follow following along,
[24:53] you'll see this is one of the texts that
[24:55] brother Bran read in the um in the text
[24:58] for this subject. Hebrews chapter 2 and
[25:01] verse three. How shall we escape if we
[25:05] neglect so great salvation? How many
[25:08] believe this salvation is a great
[25:10] salvation? It's a powerful salvation.
[25:13] How shall we escape if we neglect so
[25:15] great a salvation which is at the first
[25:18] begin to be spoken by the Lord and was
[25:20] confirmed unto us by them that heard
[25:23] him? Pay attention if you would to the
[25:25] word neglect because that doesn't seem
[25:28] like it's just outright rebellion and
[25:30] running from it. It's just neglecting it
[25:33] and that can come in different forms.
[25:36] But we don't want to neglect what God
[25:38] sends. It is a great salvation. Praise
[25:41] the Lord. Father, we just ask you
[25:43] tonight to bless your word. Give us your
[25:45] anointing, Lord. And I pray you would
[25:47] inspire it just like you have to my
[25:49] heart today. And I pray that you'll help
[25:51] your people. These are your uh chosen
[25:53] ones before the foundation of the world.
[25:55] Hold them in your hand. Form them, Lord.
[25:58] And form our opinions by your word.
[26:00] Form, Lord, change our minds. And may we
[26:03] take your thoughts tonight, Lord. May we
[26:05] be instructed and corrected and
[26:07] encouraged, Lord. And I pray father
[26:09] every wrong would be made right by the
[26:12] word of God. Send your holy spirit among
[26:14] us tonight we ask and sweep among us in
[26:17] Jesus name we ask it. Amen. God bless
[26:19] you. You may be seated.
[26:22] So when we move along in the message he
[26:24] cares do you care. There we'll get to a
[26:26] a pretty lengthy section that he begins
[26:29] to and I want to break that section
[26:31] down. I was going to do it tonight. Um,
[26:33] and that's a section or an area of the
[26:35] message he really elaborates on the in
[26:38] of of the subject in relation to our
[26:41] confession and the sincerity with our
[26:44] confession. And uh I believe it's one of
[26:47] the greatest evidences that we show God
[26:50] that we care. And remember in this
[26:52] series now that you're listening with
[26:53] me, you don't have to have the
[26:54] background. We're trying to show that
[26:56] God is a God who cares and likes to do
[26:58] something about it. But we have to show
[27:00] we care. God could care all he wants to,
[27:03] but we have to show we care. Well, how
[27:05] do we know we care? How do we what do we
[27:07] do? What do we offer up to God to show
[27:10] him that we're caring? One of the
[27:11] greatest things is sincere confession.
[27:14] Something that's spoken from our lives.
[27:16] And and what that means is that the the
[27:18] greatest evidence of showing you really
[27:20] care is open transparency, not hiding
[27:24] anything, sincere confession. And so I
[27:28] just tell you when we get into that part
[27:29] of it, put your seatelt on because it's
[27:33] going to be intense. It's going to be
[27:34] some because when we get into that, it's
[27:36] sometimes not comfortable. But I'll tell
[27:38] you, it's the key that the devil wants
[27:40] us to keep to keep us away from true
[27:43] honest transparency and confession. Uh
[27:46] the devil likes us to smear on the
[27:48] message, but God likes an open sincere
[27:51] heart to lay it on the table. And when
[27:54] we do that, somehow it moves the heart
[27:56] of God to step into situation. I can't
[27:59] slip past a little small section though
[28:01] of truth laying here before we get into
[28:03] confession. I can't slip past this part.
[28:06] And the the the the next part of the
[28:08] message, and you probably read it, is
[28:10] related to uh uh it's actually rel
[28:13] related to the lack of trust that we
[28:16] have today. And so I'm going to say it's
[28:18] it's it's because of the age of lies
[28:20] that we live in. We live in an age of
[28:22] lies. We live live in an age of
[28:25] deception. I just read the scriptures.
[28:26] Jesus said talking about betrayal.
[28:29] Talking about deception from false
[28:31] prophets. And when you have end time
[28:34] conditions that have deception and lies
[28:37] and the a I would call this brother
[28:38] Jason Watkins had a wonderful message
[28:40] one year at the men's meeting called the
[28:43] age of lies. We live in the age of lies.
[28:46] We live in a time that everybody lies.
[28:48] They have no conscience of God. So every
[28:50] politicians lie. Can you say amen? Your
[28:53] friends will lie to you. It's a it's a
[28:55] spirit of the age. The problem is is
[28:58] when you have an age of lies, there's
[29:00] one fruit that comes from that and that
[29:03] is a lack of trust
[29:07] because you've been lied to. You you've
[29:09] been betrayed. You've been to you they
[29:12] people were supposed to be loyal to you
[29:14] and they weren't loyal. And you have
[29:16] enough of that happen in the age. Then
[29:18] the fruit of that age is you have people
[29:20] with a lack of trust. And brother Bam's
[29:22] going to talk about this and I don't
[29:24] want to skip this part because we cannot
[29:27] allow the devil to ha make us a person
[29:29] who has a lack of trust. Can you say
[29:31] amen? We have to have a trust number one
[29:34] in God. We have to have a full trust in
[29:37] his word. And the Bible says trust the
[29:39] Lord with all of thine heart and lean
[29:42] not to thine own understanding.
[29:45] We got to trust the Lord.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; And and so if we're looking here at the
[29:50] subject tonight of of trusting him and
[29:53] we live in an age of the failure of
[29:55] loyalty to one another, people close to
[29:58] you can turn against you. All of it
[30:01] produces a lack of trust. They don't
[30:02] trust anything or anybody anymore. And
[30:05] you're going to hear the prophet say
[30:06] that in just a few minutes. I'll just
[30:08] read the quote himself. But they don't
[30:10] trust anything. They don't trust anybody
[30:12] anymore. uh something is lost within us
[30:16] that is built to feel secure because God
[30:19] made us to feel that loyalty to feel
[30:23] secure. God made us for human beings to
[30:26] put their trust in promises that are
[30:28] kept.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; We have something in us that we draw
[30:32] security out of promises that are kept,
[30:35] not promises that are violated. Promises
[30:37] that are go the somebody goes against
[30:40] them. They make a promise and they go
[30:41] against it. And so we're built to be
[30:44] able to have secure relationships
[30:47] because we we realize that it comes from
[30:49] a security of the promises and
[30:51] relationships with loyalty. We're built
[30:54] to have relationships with loyalty.
[30:56] We're built to have security of promises
[30:59] kept. We're built to have commitment.
[31:02] Can you say amen? How many likes
[31:03] commitment? How many likes loyalty? How
[31:05] many likes somebody to be loyal to you?
[31:08] We're built for that. But we live in an
[31:10] age when he says many shall betray one
[31:13] another.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; So we have to be careful that we're not
[31:16] part of that. And we have to be careful
[31:19] that we don't become bitter and put our
[31:21] wall up and now we don't trust anybody.
[31:24] And guess what? If you get away that you
[31:26] don't trust anybody anymore, then maybe
[31:28] the devil would like to take you to the
[31:30] next step and not trust God.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz he, you know, he don't care if your
[31:35] friend wasn't loyal to you. He wants you
[31:37] to make you have a lack of trust in God,
[31:40] to question God. That's where the
[31:43] devil's trying to end this thing up. And
[31:44] we must stop him in his tracks. We must
[31:46] say, "No, I will not let the devil take
[31:49] my trust away from his word from God is
[31:52] God's word's never failed. His promises
[31:55] have never failed. He's got a perfect
[31:57] track record."
[31:59] &gt;&gt; And I can trust that. Can you say amen?
[32:01] Now, your current trial right now, your
[32:03] current trial, it may look like
[32:05] sometimes, where's God? He's not coming
[32:07] through. I don't trust God anymore. I
[32:09] don't know. I don't know about this. But
[32:11] don't forget God's track record. 6,000
[32:14] years and even before that, never
[32:17] failing a promise that he made. He's got
[32:21] a Your uncle may not have a perfect
[32:23] track record, but God's got a perfect
[32:24] track record. His word has never failed.
[32:28] If it's 400 years later and a prophet
[32:30] said, "A virgin shall conceive." 400
[32:32] years later, he kept his promise, "A
[32:35] virgin conceived,"
[32:36] &gt;&gt; you can trust God's word.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Why do I say that? Because we must not
[32:41] buy into the lie of this age that all of
[32:43] a sudden now we can't trust God.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz you go into counseling somebody,
[32:48] they're going to have to have a certain
[32:49] level. It's all about trust. They're
[32:51] going to have to have a real trust in
[32:52] God to confess, to come to the altar, to
[32:55] give their life that why someone would
[32:57] never come. People would never come and
[32:59] hear hear me preach unless there unless
[33:01] there was some level of trust.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I wouldn't have
[33:05] anybody to preach to cuz so trust is a
[33:08] very important thing. And that ministers
[33:10] don't violate that trust is even more
[33:12] important.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; And so we have a reverence before God
[33:16] that these are God's people, not my
[33:18] people. And I have to live a life worthy
[33:20] of the gospel. Can you say amen? Before
[33:22] the people. Because there's one thing I
[33:24] don't want to do. I don't want to lose
[33:26] you to see you lose your trust in God or
[33:28] lose your trust in a man of God who's
[33:30] bringing the word to you. I want to be
[33:32] reverent to reverence that and respect
[33:34] you and humble myself before you. And
[33:37] then we humble oursel before God. I
[33:39] value your respect. I value your trust
[33:42] that you have in me. And many ministers
[33:45] through the ages, they don't value it
[33:46] enough and they ditch it and they don't
[33:48] respect God's people. Can you say amen?
[33:52] Praise the Lord. So now, uh, something
[33:54] is lost within us. Sometimes when we're
[33:58] built to feel secure in the promises and
[34:00] we're built for relationships with
[34:02] loyalty, when that is violated, we begin
[34:05] to w withdraw ourselves. When loyalty is
[34:08] violated, we withdraw oursel. We put a
[34:10] huge wall up. We we build a world around
[34:14] us that's so tight no one is allowed in
[34:17] because someone has violated trust.
[34:19] Maybe many people has violated trust. So
[34:22] it's like you have a huge wall up. Uh
[34:24] and and so you you you you kind of hold
[34:27] back giving genuine love. It's blocked.
[34:30] And we're not supposed to hold back
[34:32] genuine love. If we say we got it, we
[34:34] don't have a right to restrict it from
[34:36] anybody. If we say we got divine love in
[34:39] our hearts and we got Christ, if you say
[34:40] you got Christ, you got divine love, you
[34:43] don't have a right to restrict that to
[34:45] certain people and give it to other
[34:47] people.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is not a shouting service
[34:51] tonight, but I can tell you, you don't
[34:53] have a right to be uh just picking and
[34:56] choosing who you want to release the
[34:58] love of God to. You don't have a right
[35:00] to be picking and choosing who you
[35:03] release forgiveness to.
[35:05] And when we come down to it, how do we
[35:08] rebuild trust? We'll come down to this
[35:09] at the end. Well, there's a big thing is
[35:12] just the true flow of forgiveness that's
[35:14] coming through Calvary, flowing through
[35:16] us.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we're not going to
[35:19] get there without that forgiveness. So
[35:21] now, when we're violated, we withdraw.
[35:23] We put a wall up. We build a world
[35:25] around us. Like the little girl that
[35:27] brother Brand was dealing with in a
[35:29] insane asylum. And she said she had
[35:32] built herself around her own world there
[35:34] in what she thought and the Holy Spirit
[35:36] had to break her out of her world. Uh
[35:38] don't think that's just some girl in
[35:40] insane asylum. We build up a wall around
[35:43] us of tight walls a lot of times because
[35:47] somebody has hurt us and violated trust.
[35:51] But you see we can't do that. And so now
[35:53] we become blocked. We block genuine
[35:55] love. And uh the love of many grows
[35:58] cold. Jesus said, "There's an
[35:59] insensitivity. There's no feeling
[36:02] anymore. Nobody will ever be trusted
[36:04] again. Uh, I don't need anybody anymore.
[36:07] I'm going to build my safe world around
[36:09] me." The problem is God didn't make us
[36:13] to be that way. He made us to be
[36:15] relational beings. He made us to be
[36:18] humans that are relational not only to
[36:20] God, but to other people as well. He
[36:23] made us to connect and not keep
[36:25] disconnecting.
[36:27] That's right.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This one Christian
[36:32] writer says, "Rebuilding trust is much
[36:34] harder than building it."
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Rebuilding trust is much harder than
[36:39] building it. After conflict and
[36:41] separation after two people have so
[36:44] seriously injured each other, even after
[36:47] apologies has been made, restoring
[36:50] spontaneity and carefree affection
[36:53] doesn't happen overnight. And that also
[36:56] is the way God has made us. It takes a
[36:58] while. It's actually harder to rebuild
[37:01] trust than it is to build it initially.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; But is is the power of redemption does
[37:09] the power of redemption from the Lord
[37:11] have rebuilding trust in it?
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; It not only builds trust, but if you've
[37:19] lost it, it can rebuild trust.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; It can restore. He said, "I will
[37:24] restore, sayaeth the Lord." This is not
[37:26] only a God that can keep you from sin,
[37:28] but when you fall, then he's able to
[37:30] restore you from sin. If that's true, if
[37:32] he's a God that can protect you, he's a
[37:35] God that can forgive you. He's a God
[37:38] that can rebuild trust. Even if you've
[37:40] lost trust in God and lost trust in the
[37:43] message, you listen to the wrong voices.
[37:45] Too many preachers hurt you. I'm telling
[37:47] you, Christ knows about it and he can
[37:49] rebuild your trust that you stand with
[37:52] 100% confidence in this word that God
[37:55] has sent.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; It's in the atonement. God God provided
[37:59] for it to rebuild trust. Some of you
[38:01] tonight may need the Lord that might
[38:03] need to be your prayer. Not so much I
[38:05] need more finances. I need my trust
[38:07] rebuilt in the word of God. I need my
[38:10] trust rebuilt in what God says. Praise
[38:13] the Lord. So, I'm going to read that
[38:15] again. Rebuilding trust is much harder
[38:17] than building it after conflict and
[38:18] separation. After two people have so
[38:20] seriously injured each other, even after
[38:23] apologies have been made, restoring the
[38:26] spontaneity and the carefree affection
[38:28] for one another doesn't happen
[38:30] overnight. There's something about it.
[38:33] I'd say the worst fruit from this lack
[38:34] of trust is a lack of trust in God. To
[38:37] find God, his help, his deliverance, uh
[38:42] we will have to trust him to do that.
[38:44] So, we would have to trust God. If we're
[38:46] going to find help, if we're we're going
[38:48] to find a God who cares, if we're going
[38:51] to find deliverance, we'll have to fully
[38:53] trust him.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; So, how important is it? And then then
[38:57] Satan destroys our trust that we also we
[39:00] off al we we put ourselves away from God
[39:03] being the supernatural God that he needs
[39:05] to be because we've lost a little bit of
[39:08] trust in our heart. We might still be
[39:09] going to church, but we're just not
[39:11] quite allin because we've lost trust.
[39:14] We're questioning. We're wondering. We
[39:15] got doubts floating around in front of
[39:18] us in our spirit. And we've got all that
[39:20] there. We limit. We limit what God can
[39:22] do. God wants us to believe. God wants
[39:25] us to be free. God wants us to fully
[39:27] trust him. And as I said Sunday, God
[39:29] leads us into trials that will cause us
[39:32] to take us to deeper levels of trusting.
[39:34] Like Abraham, take thy son, thine only
[39:37] son, and bring him up. The son that he
[39:39] got a promise through, take him up and
[39:41] offer him up. Try to figure that one out
[39:43] in your mind. But what was he testing?
[39:45] He was testing Abraham's faith. Are you
[39:48] going to trust me? Take your only son,
[39:50] offer him up to me. And he actually did
[39:52] it. He put him up to the altar, grabbed
[39:55] the knife. This is how much he trusted
[39:57] God,
[39:59] his only son. His only son from his own
[40:01] loins. And here from from the the
[40:04] promised son. And he's ready to do it.
[40:06] And the angel has stopped him says, "Now
[40:08] I know you really trust me."
[40:11] There are levels of trust that we need
[40:13] to grow to it. Can anybody help me with
[40:16] an amen tonight? There are levels of
[40:18] trust God wants to bring you through
[40:20] through trials that you've never
[40:21] imagined before.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. You know
[40:27] that story about the guy that falls off
[40:29] into the Grand Canyon just hanging by a
[40:32] bush and he says, "Can anybody help me
[40:34] up there?" You know, and somebody says,
[40:36] "Yeah, I can help you." It's God
[40:38] speaking to him. I can help you.
[40:40] What do you What do you need me to do?
[40:42] Please help me. What do I need to do?
[40:43] Let go and I'll help you.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; That's what God said. Let go and I'll
[40:47] help you.
[40:49] Is there anybody else up there?
[40:54] God has taken us to levels of trust that
[40:57] we never imagined before. There are
[40:59] trials in people's lives. Even in this
[41:01] church, I would have never imagined
[41:03] families have to hit it. But all I can
[41:06] say is our God is true. Our God will
[41:08] bring you through. Our God can be
[41:11] trusted. He's got it in his control.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now, if we lose our trust
[41:20] in God, then we we close the doors for
[41:23] deliverance. And the God who cares.
[41:25] Satan has done his best to destroy
[41:27] trust. So, we won't even trust the Lord.
[41:29] He don't care if you lose Satan doesn't
[41:31] care if you lose trust in the
[41:33] government. He doesn't care if he you
[41:35] lose trust in your uh employer. It's
[41:37] when we don't think God can be trusted.
[41:40] He is winning the battle in your life
[41:43] when he brings you down the path
[41:46] of not trusting God.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Satan's winning. And I tell you, we need
[41:51] to wake up. If you're there, you need to
[41:53] wake up. Don't let him do it. Don't let
[41:55] Satan take it that far. Say, "Well, I'm
[41:57] not there." Well, praise the Lord you're
[41:58] not there. But I can tell you the
[42:00] devil's agenda is not just to get you to
[42:03] mistrust other human beings. He wants to
[42:06] get you to you. Not you don't trust the
[42:08] message. You don't trust God. You don't
[42:10] believe. You see, that's where he wants
[42:12] to take you. Don't let him f fulfill his
[42:15] agenda. Losing trust in the word of this
[42:17] hour is the worst thing. Cuz listen now,
[42:20] losing trust in the message of the hour
[42:22] is the worst thing Satan can do cuz it's
[42:25] the very thing God sent in his provided
[42:28] way for this hour.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; And what an attack. It's always been
[42:33] attacked, but look at the last 15, 20
[42:35] years, 10 years, how this message has
[42:38] been attacked. You know, we had a
[42:40] reporter here and we were gracious. We
[42:42] answered her questions, but it we knew
[42:45] it all of a sudden it just everything
[42:47] most of the stuff was negative on all of
[42:49] us. Not sure if I'll do that again, but
[42:51] I'll tell you, I'll say it publicly and
[42:53] I respect the young girl that come. She
[42:55] was very respectful to us. But listen,
[42:57] if the enemy is behind it all, if the
[43:00] critics are behind it all, you're not
[43:02] going to come out, it's not going to
[43:04] about come out truthful.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why? Well, it's just
[43:09] what he said here in Satan's Eden. Look
[43:11] at this. No wonder he destroys the value
[43:13] of the word of the hour. He says, "Now,
[43:15] he said he would exalt himself above the
[43:18] most high." How does Satan do that? He
[43:20] would ascend above the clouds and the
[43:21] stars, and he would sit there like God
[43:23] and be above the most high. And he has
[43:25] succeeded in carrying out his threats.
[43:28] He has certainly had a marvelous success
[43:32] in carrying out his threats by the
[43:34] people letting him explain away in every
[43:38] age the value of God's promised word to
[43:41] that age. That's exactly how he's done
[43:43] it. In every age, he explained it away.
[43:46] The enemy is behind influences to
[43:49] explain slowly explain away and take
[43:52] stabs in his his fiery darts at the
[43:55] message of the hour. The very thing God
[43:58] sent that should be trusted, that's what
[44:00] he's trying to poke holes in. Can I get
[44:02] an amen tonight?
[44:05] &gt;&gt; The very It's the word of the hour that
[44:07] he sent. It's that that the the guns are
[44:10] trained from hell against. And in our
[44:12] minds, we can be manipulated sometimes.
[44:15] And I'll tell you, that's why we need
[44:17] the the the typost of the Holy Ghost. We
[44:21] need a concrete typost. Can you say
[44:24] amen?
[44:25] &gt;&gt; We need to be settled that we have the
[44:27] Holy Spirit. When you have that, then
[44:29] there's no in your soul questioning.
[44:32] It's in your mind. You might have Satan
[44:34] bring things and little birds try to put
[44:36] nest in your thoughts, but the soul says
[44:40] amen to the word of God. So, you know,
[44:43] we will go into this idea a little bit
[44:45] of this lack of trust which causes
[44:47] people not to connect. It really is just
[44:50] unbelief, a lack of trust. And this text
[44:53] that uh we read to you,
[44:57] how should we escape if we neglect so
[44:59] great a salvation? The omnipotent God is
[45:02] available for any need and people
[45:05] neglect it. How should we escape if we
[45:07] neglect? And I was looking up that word
[45:08] neglect. People neglect the power of God
[45:12] and the what God can do but they
[45:15] sometimes just neglect it. Neglect it
[45:17] for different reasons. Like neglect
[45:20] means, listen to what neglect means.
[45:22] It's with our subject. Neglect means
[45:24] something is being ignored that is not
[45:27] being cared for properly. That's the
[45:29] verb. Neglect is something that's being
[45:32] ignored. Now it's I don't see this as
[45:34] being somebody just running away from
[45:35] it. It's something that's just being
[45:38] ignored. Neglect is ignoring something
[45:42] that should be cared for.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; How should we escape if we neglect? It's
[45:49] just ignoring that something we should
[45:51] be giving more value to and we're just
[45:54] ignoring it. And people ignore it for
[45:56] different reasons. It's it's not just
[45:57] always uh just rebellion and I'm running
[46:00] away from this. It's just ignoring it.
[46:02] And then the noun for neglect means the
[46:04] state of fact or fact of being uncared
[46:07] for. Isn't that amazing? We're preaching
[46:09] on he cares. Do you care? And it means
[46:13] that people cannot give the proper
[46:15] attention and care for this word, for
[46:18] the power of God, for the inward need
[46:21] that they have. If you have something
[46:23] inward that's a need, God has a way to
[46:25] meet that need.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; And so you need to have a a care and not
[46:29] neglect that inward need.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; That's how we show we care. You don't
[46:35] ignore. You don't neglect. You don't
[46:37] have a lack of care for and that's what
[46:39] people have. They like have a care they
[46:41] have a lack of care for their heart.
[46:43] They maybe come to church but they you
[46:45] must care if there's a need. You see,
[46:48] brother said in the thirst message, he
[46:49] says there's another thing that we do to
[46:51] a thirst. He says we neglect a thirst.
[46:55] And if you neglect a God-given thirst,
[46:58] he said you'll die.
[47:00] So you can't neglect a thirst. If God's
[47:02] putting something in you and there's a
[47:04] wall blocking it, you must have a care.
[47:07] And this is what neglect means. Uh we're
[47:09] preaching on he cares, do you care? It
[47:11] means that people cannot give the proper
[47:13] attention and care for an inward need.
[47:15] You have sin, but you're not caring for
[47:18] the answer for that sin. You're just
[47:20] neglecting the answer God's given. You
[47:22] have damage in your heart. You have hurt
[47:24] in your heart. You have condemnation in
[47:26] your heart. You have fear in your heart.
[47:28] and you're not caring for that heart to
[47:31] bring it closer to God. That's neglect.
[47:34] How shall we escape if we neglect our
[47:37] hearts and where they're at?
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] So, when you don't have a care for that
[47:45] heart and bring it to God, it means
[47:46] you're neglecting it. You're not caring
[47:48] for it. God cares for it, but you're not
[47:50] caring for it. So if someone neglects
[47:54] the truth or neglects
[47:56] God, it could be out of rebellion,
[48:00] it also could be because it's not a
[48:03] prior a priority in your life above
[48:06] everything else. Might as well say it.
[48:09] People might neglect because they're
[48:10] just out rebellious. But I don't catch
[48:13] that meaning of the word neglect. It's
[48:15] just not having an attention. And here
[48:17] I'm saying people neglect it and ignore
[48:20] it because something else is more
[48:23] important in their lives.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; So So I I I I know God's important. I
[48:30] know God's important, but and I know
[48:32] I've got some needs here and I've got to
[48:34] connect with the Lord so he can so he
[48:36] can help me. But it's on the bottom of
[48:39] the list.
[48:41] It can't. You're not caring for it
[48:43] properly if it's at the bottom of the
[48:45] list. Because one day when the money is
[48:48] gone and the things are gone, how you
[48:51] cared for your heart and connecting with
[48:53] God is the only thing we go away with.
[48:56] Character is the only thing we take with
[48:58] us.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; How much we get from God in revelation
[49:02] is what we will carry with us to the
[49:04] other side. It won't be our houses and
[49:06] lands. But people neglect a need in
[49:09] their lives for a lot of reasons, but
[49:12] sometimes it's just simply everything
[49:14] else is so so greatly important.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Help us, Lord.
[49:22] To not get so busy.
[49:27] I was just thinking of something
[49:28] somebody sent me today, and I if it all
[49:31] comes back to me, I'll say it to you,
[49:32] but it's not all coming back right now.
[49:36] You love the Lord tonight.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Could be out of rebellion. Could not.
[49:41] Could be that there's there's not a
[49:42] priority above anything else in life.
[49:44] Listen, the word and Christ the word is
[49:48] the pearl of great price.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; But if you don't see it as the pearl of
[49:54] great price,
[49:56] &gt;&gt; you won't value it as that.
[49:59] And Jesus said when the man in the
[50:01] parable found he was looking for the
[50:03] pearl great price, he found it. He
[50:06] unearthed it. And when he found it, he
[50:08] went and sold everything else he had for
[50:12] that pearl. When Christ, this word, this
[50:16] Christ of this message becomes that kind
[50:19] of pearl in you, you will easily shed
[50:22] the things of the world.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; You will easily put it priority above
[50:26] everything. The only reason you don't
[50:28] sell out to it, lock, stop, and barrel,
[50:30] it's not a pearl to you yet.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I'm giving away a sermon that the Lord's
[50:34] given me. I'm giving it tonight. And I
[50:36] got a whole sermon on this. The only
[50:38] reason somebody wouldn't completely sell
[50:40] out lock, stock, and barrel to this
[50:42] Christ of this message is they don't see
[50:44] it as the pearl.
[50:47] When you see it, this is the pearl. This
[50:49] is what I've been looking for my whole
[50:51] life. God sent it. It's precious. It's a
[50:53] pearl. It's not something to be ignored
[50:55] and put to the side. And when you see it
[50:58] as that, you'll sell out everything else
[51:01] and you'll give to it. Can you say amen?
[51:03] So, here's what brother Brown gets into.
[51:05] You can't believe nothing hardly. It's
[51:06] this little section about trust. Can't
[51:08] believe nothing hardly but the Bible. We
[51:11] still have Christ thanks to God. See,
[51:13] you can't believe anything. For
[51:15] instance, when you turn on your
[51:16] television, you that have such and when
[51:19] you turn your television on and see the
[51:21] commercials, well, if a person tried to
[51:23] live by 100th of those commercials,
[51:25] you'd die in a week. So, you couldn't do
[51:28] it. And the very thing that some company
[51:29] will break down like a product and say
[51:31] this is the thing here and don't have
[51:33] this one over here. And the same company
[51:36] sells the same product, then another
[51:38] commercial will come on, take this on
[51:40] this side and not that and that same
[51:42] company. So, there's a competition. And
[51:43] today with the what do they call them
[51:45] the algorithms or whatever it is they
[51:47] catch what you want to buy. They're
[51:48] vying for your purchase cuz they're out
[51:51] to make money. And a lot of times what
[51:52] brother Brandon says is true. It's the
[51:54] same corporate companies that own both
[51:56] of them. They're making a fight between
[51:58] the two products and they're saying this
[51:59] is the best. This is the best. And the
[52:01] same company's making the making both of
[52:03] those products. What are they doing?
[52:04] They're lying to you.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; It's the age of lies.
[52:08] They're lying and they don't care.
[52:09] They're lying to you. And we kind of get
[52:11] pulled into that. The American people
[52:13] fall for such stuff as that till the
[52:16] whole thing is become rotten until
[52:19] there's no hopes at all. And just hold
[52:22] the quote right there. Nobody knows what
[52:25] to believe.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; It it creates this thing of confusion
[52:31] and lack of trust.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; That's where it starts. It's it's the
[52:35] media. It's the commercials. It's just,
[52:39] you know, I started this when I was a
[52:40] very young boy. Some of you know my
[52:43] story, but I'll just be real quick with
[52:45] it. When I recognized for there was a
[52:47] freckle removal for my freckles, and I
[52:50] begged my mom and dad for months on end
[52:53] to get this new product that would
[52:55] remove freckles cuz I hated my freckles.
[52:57] I begged them. I begged until my dad
[53:00] finally sprung for the product. I got
[53:02] it. I took it home. I put it all over my
[53:04] body and I knew the next morning I would
[53:07] be like non and have baby skin and not
[53:10] have freckles anymore.
[53:12] The next morning I woke up I had more
[53:14] freckles than what I had the night
[53:15] before. And so I I learned these things
[53:18] when I was a kid. Hey, wait a minute.
[53:20] Somebody's trying to sell me something
[53:21] here. They're lying to me. And most of
[53:25] the products is that way. It's to make
[53:27] money, but it don't have a substance to
[53:29] to it. Can you say amen?
[53:31] I'm comfortable with my freckles today.
[53:33] I've learned to accept them. 32 years
[53:35] ago, I married a woman and the two
[53:37] questions I asked her to establish our
[53:40] relationship, "Do you have the Holy
[53:42] Ghost?" Second question, do you like
[53:44] freckles?
[53:47] And she said in her Tennessee accent, I
[53:50] love those freckles.
[53:52] Praise the Lord. Let's get married.
[53:56] I've ordered a lot of stuff through the
[53:58] years, friends. I didn't learn from
[53:59] them. I've ordered a lot of special
[54:01] vitamins and pills and all the weight
[54:05] loss stuff from what did it start out
[54:08] fit for life and that turned it into fit
[54:11] to be tied and
[54:14] balance of nature and I have been
[54:18] gullible and you know that's the only
[54:20] thing people buy that balance of nature
[54:22] for is to relieve their childhood guilt
[54:24] of not getting their fruits and
[54:26] vegetables cuz their mom told them to
[54:28] get it and you can get it in a peel
[54:29] pill, a pill. That's the reason they do
[54:31] it. I was beginning to wonder after I
[54:33] was taking all this stuff that I seen
[54:35] and I seen on ads and I had it all
[54:38] laying on the counter and I took I was
[54:40] running how many pills I would be
[54:42] needing to take per day to solve all my
[54:46] problems.
[54:49] Apple cider vinegar. And the only
[54:52] benefit to that is it comes in gummy
[54:54] bears. Now,
[54:57] there's something appealing about
[54:59] vitamins and stuff that come in gummies
[55:01] because it takes you back to your
[55:02] childhood and it's easy to go down and
[55:04] it's gummy bears and you feel like
[55:07] you're a kid again and but you know on I
[55:09] want to end this on a good note finally
[55:11] finally in my life this year I'm hitting
[55:14] and finding some good things that
[55:16] doesn't look like lies and just a bunch
[55:18] of money spending. I'm getting some
[55:20] results. Uh some of it is from our dear
[55:23] sister Tina and different ones in the
[55:24] church that's helped us to get um sister
[55:27] Tina is the she don't mind me teasing
[55:29] her that she's the resident uh
[55:32] homopaththetic doctor here
[55:36] homeopathic doctor and uh she has helped
[55:39] us and some others and I want to say to
[55:42] the glory of God uh I'm off of since
[55:45] March I'm off of all my medications all
[55:48] my medicines since March.
[55:51] Amen. So it is there is some things that
[55:54] can help and uh finally finding some of
[55:57] those things. But boy, I was gullible
[55:58] with some of that stuff. This is the age
[56:00] of lies.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; There's no morals in the companies as
[56:04] he's saying the the system. It's a
[56:06] system of Satan to act like they're
[56:08] telling the truth, but they're telling a
[56:10] lie. And they will lie to make a greater
[56:12] profit. Politicians will do that to get
[56:14] a position. The age of lies causes
[56:17] people to do what? to lose trust.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; The age of lies has a fruit to it and
[56:23] that's causes people to lose trust.
[56:25] Nobody knows what to believe. As brother
[56:26] Bram says, why why is this such an
[56:29] important subject? Why is it so? Why did
[56:32] I believe the prophet brought it up for
[56:33] a reason? Because without trust, you
[56:36] won't run towards God and seek the help
[56:39] from God because you have a hesitance
[56:42] even to trust him.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; It's an age of lies. If you've had
[56:46] enough lies, the fruit of it would be
[56:48] you you just have a mistrust. You can't
[56:50] have that with God. We got to give all
[56:52] of our hearts to him.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He goes on to say,
[56:56] "The people lie, cheat, steal, till you
[56:59] almost have to have a bond of security
[57:00] to borrow $5 from somebody." You know,
[57:02] the Bible speaks that there'd be no love
[57:04] in the last days, but just among the
[57:06] elect group. That's right. The scripture
[57:08] speaks of that. that the husband would
[57:10] be against wife and wife against
[57:12] husband, children against parents. Just
[57:14] among the elected of the Lord will there
[57:16] be any love left. I want to as a pastor
[57:19] tell you this is what brother Bram says
[57:22] is the time and Jesus said it. He said
[57:24] many shall betray one another. Fathers
[57:26] will turn against children. Husbands
[57:28] will turn against wife. Just remember
[57:30] when you're having that argument and
[57:32] Satan wants to take it and escalate it
[57:33] to break in your oneness in your
[57:35] marriage. Just remember that's not you.
[57:37] That's the devil doing that because it's
[57:39] an age of mistrust. If he can cause you
[57:42] to mistrust one another,
[57:44] then he can cause you to mistrust God.
[57:47] And we live underneath that, friends.
[57:49] Brother Brand was saying it. That's why
[57:50] I read to you the end time scriptures.
[57:52] It's a time of betrayal. It's a time
[57:54] when people lose trust. And so that's
[57:56] what he says in the natural. Now look
[57:59] where he goes. And you probably read
[58:00] this if you're listening to this
[58:02] message. Now we find out that the
[58:04] churches too are always promising
[58:06] something like television and so forth
[58:09] that they never get to the thing they
[58:12] promised.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Right? I may not get as many amens on
[58:16] this, but he goes to and said this whole
[58:18] carnal atmosphere of lies now it's come
[58:21] in the church that they're always trying
[58:23] to promise and hold something out from
[58:24] the people and promise. Okay, this is
[58:27] going to happen. This I believe in being
[58:28] expecting. I preached on that a Sunday
[58:30] or Wednesday, I think it was, is that I
[58:32] believe in true expectations of God, but
[58:36] false expectations is a bad thing. And
[58:38] sometimes churches to bring the people
[58:41] under false expectations and promising
[58:44] if you do this this is going to happen.
[58:46] If you give this much money this is
[58:48] going to happen. This big meeting coming
[58:50] up this is going to be the answer to all
[58:52] your problems. People get disappointed
[58:55] because they put their trust in
[58:57] something and the next time when it
[58:59] fails they don't trust as much. He even
[59:02] said in I think perfect faith I read it
[59:04] today where he says we shouldn't have
[59:07] artificial altra altar calls because
[59:09] when we do that person will come but
[59:12] it's 10 times harder for them to come
[59:14] the next time if they're not sincerely
[59:17] in confession when they come to the
[59:19] altar
[59:20] &gt;&gt; they get harder towards it and so now
[59:22] he's saying the churches like television
[59:25] the thing they promise is often I said
[59:26] an old quotation man is always praising
[59:29] God for what he did praising God for
[59:30] what he will looking forward to what he
[59:32] will do and then ignore what he's doing.
[59:34] You see they fail and that's the way
[59:37] that become the history after a while
[59:39] the polluted because they fail to
[59:41] recognize now you can talk of the
[59:43] comfort Christ give once and say that a
[59:45] comfort he will give in the ages to come
[59:47] but refuse the comfort that he's got
[59:50] here now for you see it's on the same
[59:53] basis we find that it's become a great
[59:56] thing now find out that they come so
[59:58] he's saying they point to something and
[1:00:00] this is get this gets pretty specific
[1:00:01] the next one there that's even become in
[1:00:04] Pentecost in the church. It's it's
[1:00:06] become into the Pentecostal realms that
[1:00:08] they're always promising something that
[1:00:10] they never get to it. It's always that
[1:00:13] every fellow has a different sensation
[1:00:16] and make it whether it's scripture or
[1:00:17] not. They're promising something that
[1:00:19] they never get to it until it seems
[1:00:22] like. Now, friends, he's diagnosing the
[1:00:24] church. They're buying into this is that
[1:00:27] you're manipulating the people and
[1:00:29] putting out a promise there and having
[1:00:31] them reach towards it. Then they get
[1:00:33] disappointed. You know what you're
[1:00:34] doing? You're bringing confusion. You're
[1:00:35] bringing a lack of trust.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And if it's the church, people start
[1:00:40] will start lacking trust in God because
[1:00:43] the church is supposed to represent God.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; The church is supposed to be preaching
[1:00:47] the reality of God. But if they're
[1:00:49] playing games, and I've even watched
[1:00:51] this in movements within our within our
[1:00:53] our group, and that is to keep the
[1:00:55] people always on the edge of something.
[1:00:58] They keep changing. The target keeps
[1:01:00] moving, keeping on. Oh, this is the big
[1:01:02] thing that's happening. Everybody needs
[1:01:04] to join in with this. And then when that
[1:01:06] fizzles out, then they jump onto
[1:01:07] something else. This is what's
[1:01:09] happening. And they draw the people into
[1:01:10] it. A lot of people get disappointed and
[1:01:13] get discouraged because what? You're
[1:01:15] doing the same thing.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Just preach the pure word of God with no
[1:01:21] gimmicks. Don't try to hold something
[1:01:23] over the people to try to keep them
[1:01:26] paying their tithes. Get rid of all that
[1:01:28] carnality. Yes.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And we've had this thing creep in
[1:01:32] sometimes with using all kinds of
[1:01:33] different things to keep the people
[1:01:35] dazzled by something. Just let's just
[1:01:38] let's just let all that burn away from
[1:01:40] us
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; because what it does it causes people to
[1:01:44] lose trust in the true message in the
[1:01:47] true word of God. Can you say amen? Let
[1:01:49] me finish that. So it get to the place
[1:01:52] where it doesn't seem to be any
[1:01:53] sincerity. I think that's the end of the
[1:01:55] Yeah, that's the end of the quote. Did I
[1:01:56] read that whole thing? Yeah. So every
[1:01:58] fella has a different sensation and make
[1:02:00] it whether it's script whether it's
[1:02:02] scriptural or not and they're promising
[1:02:04] something that they never do get to it
[1:02:07] until it seems like it's got to a place
[1:02:08] where there doesn't seem to be any
[1:02:11] sincerity
[1:02:12] confusion promises broken around the
[1:02:15] church. It affects people. And the last
[1:02:18] thing he says here, there doesn't seem
[1:02:20] to be s sincerity. That's what we'll go
[1:02:22] into in next is sincerity and sincere
[1:02:25] confession. That kind of atmosphere can
[1:02:28] affect the trust in people. And there's
[1:02:30] not the sincerity in our altar calls.
[1:02:33] There's not the sincerity in our
[1:02:34] services. We're not coming here to just
[1:02:37] hear a sermon, an artificial sermon.
[1:02:39] We're coming here to meet God.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything artificial. I
[1:02:45] don't want to be dazzled by something
[1:02:47] that surface. I want to meet God. I want
[1:02:49] to connect with him.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, just to to find
[1:02:55] some uh conclusions here tonight. And
[1:02:58] remember, I said this is just a very
[1:02:59] short section of he cares. Do you care?
[1:03:01] I hope you listen to it. But we cannot
[1:03:04] let Satan steal our trust in God. First
[1:03:08] of all,
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; why do you have to say something so
[1:03:12] simple, brother Paul? Because Satan is
[1:03:14] out to steal your trust in God. Satan is
[1:03:18] out to steal your trust in the message.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; I just say take your Bible and take the
[1:03:24] message. Don't take any other voices on
[1:03:25] the internet.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You've got a soul. You can call on God.
[1:03:30] You can take your Bible. You study it
[1:03:33] and you find the truth that God can show
[1:03:36] you. Don't take voices from anybody else
[1:03:38] today.
[1:03:40] They just sometimes come and plant a
[1:03:42] little seed there against the prophet's
[1:03:44] message and get you find it. And I'm
[1:03:46] going to just testify to you. There are
[1:03:48] some times when I come along through the
[1:03:50] years, I've said this to ministering
[1:03:51] brothers. There are some times and since
[1:03:54] 16 years old, I've been studying this
[1:03:55] message and every once in a while he'll
[1:03:58] say something, the prophet of God, and
[1:04:00] I'll go,
[1:04:04] especially when I was young because I
[1:04:05] didn't know my Bible well enough. And
[1:04:07] I'm going, where did he get that from? I
[1:04:10] I don't know. But I knew I had to trust
[1:04:12] in this. This is God's prophet for this
[1:04:14] hour. Satan's never taken that away from
[1:04:16] me. That's was settled. Who Malachi 4
[1:04:19] was has was settled. That's a a
[1:04:21] foundational absolute. Brother Brandham
[1:04:24] isn't the absolute. The word is the
[1:04:25] absolute. But who Malachi 4 was, that's
[1:04:27] an absolute.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; I had a man in in the office and begin
[1:04:31] to question these things and I just he
[1:04:33] wanted to talk about all the different
[1:04:34] things where he felt like brother Brian
[1:04:35] was wrong. I said, 'There's only one
[1:04:37] question I need to ask you. Who's
[1:04:38] Malachi 4:5?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, I never thought about
[1:04:41] that." I said, "Well, that's
[1:04:43] foundational. I mean, who's he at? Who
[1:04:45] is he?"
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Because once that is established as an
[1:04:49] absolute, the other things God can show
[1:04:52] you,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; okay? God's not asking you to just
[1:04:55] blindly trust something, but but you see
[1:04:57] now over time when I found something and
[1:04:59] I'm going, "Ah, boy, where does that?"
[1:05:02] And I know there's a human side, too.
[1:05:04] But let's not promote that so much that
[1:05:06] we start questioning everything God's
[1:05:07] prophet said. There's a human side. But
[1:05:10] every time that I find something, I say,
[1:05:12] I don't know if that's in the word. I've
[1:05:14] been in doing this. I'm 59. Why do I
[1:05:17] keep bringing up my age? I'm 59. Started
[1:05:19] at 16 years old. Study this message.
[1:05:21] Every time through the years, even as of
[1:05:23] last week, now I know why the prophet
[1:05:26] said it.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; There it is right there in the Bible.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a trust that develops a
[1:05:33] real trust. God's breathing on this
[1:05:36] generation. God breathed on this
[1:05:38] generation and he's brought his people
[1:05:40] back to absolute truth.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; It lays in there.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; So, I've learned to trust to where I
[1:05:47] don't take my thoughts on it and say,
[1:05:49] "Okay, he was wrong on that and I'm just
[1:05:51] going with it." No, no, no, no, no. I
[1:05:52] trust a prophet's interpretation over my
[1:05:55] own. Yeah, sure.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is a divine
[1:05:58] interpreter of God's word.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Not he as a human being, but his office,
[1:06:02] he's an interpreter of God's word. That
[1:06:04] needs to be settled in our lives.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; That way, we don't just throw him on as
[1:06:08] a pebble on another pebble on the beach.
[1:06:11] No, no. God did what he did throughout
[1:06:14] the Bible when the people needed. He
[1:06:16] sent a prophet.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; This must be for somebody tonight.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wh how does you have how do you
[1:06:23] have a pattern that God sends a prophet
[1:06:25] in every generation and reveals his
[1:06:27] secrets? Amos 3:7 through the prophets
[1:06:30] and all of a sudden we get to the end
[1:06:33] and God changes his mind. No, I'm not
[1:06:35] going to do it that way.
[1:06:37] Changing the whole pattern. No, he's
[1:06:39] always done it that way. And I'm I'm
[1:06:42] comfortable with that. And guess what? I
[1:06:44] trust that that's a God that I can
[1:06:46] trust.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; I get those little things. I Oh my
[1:06:49] goodness. And then every one of them.
[1:06:51] Every one of them.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; There it is. There it is. Cuz remember
[1:06:54] when you're in the mind of God and a
[1:06:56] prophet's bringing the mind of God, you
[1:06:58] may not understand it initially.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But if it's the mind of God, you'll
[1:07:02] catch that thought. Say, "Oh, now I see
[1:07:04] what was in God's mind. Now I see why
[1:07:06] the prophet was saying that."
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes to the world, it seems very
[1:07:09] harsh what he says. Elijah's Elijah
[1:07:12] didn't have too much. He didn't hold
[1:07:15] back on Jezebel at all. And this Elijah
[1:07:17] didn't either. and all the Jezebels of
[1:07:19] the generation
[1:07:21] because his nature was Elijah.
[1:07:24] And so you go, "Oh, well, I don't know
[1:07:25] if I'd say it that way." But let let
[1:07:28] Elijah be Elijah.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; What do you If you live back in Elijah's
[1:07:31] day, what are you going to come? That
[1:07:32] was very harsh what you said about
[1:07:34] Jezebel. You were very Can't you choose
[1:07:37] your words a little better? You're going
[1:07:39] to tell Elijah that? No. Elijah's
[1:07:41] Elijah. Let him be Elijah.
[1:07:45] We pastors, we might bring it a little
[1:07:48] different way, but let Elijah be Elijah.
[1:07:51] I'm not not afraid of any of it today.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; If it comes and tears the very hide off
[1:07:56] of me, I've learned to trust the Lord
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; that it's for my good.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I got to go back here
[1:08:05] and find where I'm at in my notes.
[1:08:12] We can't let Satan steal our trust.
[1:08:16] We must pray and say, "God,
[1:08:20] if I've lost trust, restore my trust."
[1:08:23] God can build trust. And God can restore
[1:08:25] trust, he can rebuild it. And in
[1:08:28] redemption, he can rebuild trust as
[1:08:29] well. Not just give it, but rebuild it.
[1:08:32] to trust God for our complete salvation
[1:08:35] and the rapture and everything in
[1:08:37] between. God wants us to trust him for
[1:08:41] our complete salvation and the rapture
[1:08:45] and everything in between.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Now, this one man, as I'm just trying to
[1:08:54] draw down to a close,
[1:08:57] uh he writes a little something about
[1:08:59] trust can be rebuilt in broken
[1:09:01] relationships. He was asked from a man
[1:09:03] on a radio show, "I broke trust with my
[1:09:06] wife. I was unfaithful to my wife. We're
[1:09:09] back together." But he said, "How can I
[1:09:12] rebuild trust to my wife that she trusts
[1:09:14] me again?" What a great question. He
[1:09:17] gives a scripture here in Colossians
[1:09:18] 3:13,
[1:09:20] "Bear with each other and forgive one
[1:09:23] another. If any of you have a grievance
[1:09:25] against someone, forgive as the Lord
[1:09:29] forgave you."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] Some people think trust either exists in
[1:09:34] a relationship and you have it or you
[1:09:37] don't. It's only one or two things. I
[1:09:40] think that's a good way to bring it up.
[1:09:41] Some people think that trust exists. You
[1:09:43] either have it or you don't. But that's
[1:09:45] simply not true. Scripture shows us how
[1:09:47] we can build trust and even rebuild
[1:09:50] trust. This is what scriptures uh these
[1:09:54] scriptures uh talk about conflict
[1:09:57] resolution to be able to rel uh uh to
[1:09:59] resolve things and to build back trust.
[1:10:02] I shared that he would first need to
[1:10:04] humbly go to his wife and admit his sin
[1:10:06] if he hadn't done so already and ask for
[1:10:08] forgiveness. That's Matthew 5. That
[1:10:10] would fulfill the Lord's commandment to
[1:10:13] go fess up to it, own up to it,
[1:10:15] completely repent. But see, it's not
[1:10:17] just that to rebuild. Then he would need
[1:10:19] to ask her if there was any other way
[1:10:21] that he had hurt her. Listen to her.
[1:10:23] Listen to her response. Take ownership
[1:10:26] without blameshifting, accusing, or
[1:10:28] denying. He would need to confess his
[1:10:31] sin and ask for her forgiveness for
[1:10:33] hurting her without taking these first
[1:10:36] steps in humility towards
[1:10:37] reconciliation. Any efforts, any
[1:10:39] additional efforts he would take to
[1:10:41] rebuild trust with his wife would be
[1:10:43] hindered. I reminded them him that if
[1:10:46] someone trusts me, it's because I have
[1:10:48] done what is trustworthy and what makes
[1:10:51] them feel safe. My actions have created
[1:10:54] trust in them. Therefore, to rebuild
[1:10:57] trust with his wife, he would need to
[1:10:59] find out what she needs to feel safe and
[1:11:04] do those things.
[1:11:06] And he goes on and on. But I just want
[1:11:08] to bring that point that we assume well
[1:11:11] trust trust is either there or it's not
[1:11:14] there. If trust is broken in this age,
[1:11:16] it can be. It can be restored as well.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And if we're talking about a trust in
[1:11:22] God, your trust in the Lord and the
[1:11:24] message in one another can be restored.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; How many believe that tonight?
[1:11:31] We can't have an entrance to a God who
[1:11:33] cares. Until we care enough to say, I
[1:11:36] trust God that he can. If I'm lacking
[1:11:38] trust, he can rebuild my trust.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; You come before the Lord, there has to
[1:11:43] be a trust in him. The power of Christ's
[1:11:45] forgiveness is the key to trusting
[1:11:49] again. William Slack, I don't I don't
[1:11:51] think he's here tonight. He wrote
[1:11:52] something really nice last week on the
[1:11:55] youth um telegram and it was on
[1:11:58] forgiveness. Several of our brothers
[1:12:00] though write something uh brother Brent
[1:12:02] and different ones and it's it's
[1:12:03] encouraging things even some of the
[1:12:04] sisters and uh William wrote a thought
[1:12:08] on forgiveness and it was wonderful to
[1:12:11] see but then I heard from some of the
[1:12:13] youth you know this is difficult
[1:12:15] you know these these this person's hurt
[1:12:18] me this person you know it's amazing
[1:12:20] today it used to be that someone was
[1:12:23] older become old and crusty and so many
[1:12:26] people have done them wrong they become
[1:12:28] bitter and they're the ones that's got
[1:12:30] to talk about forgiveness.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; But now it's the teenagers
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; who have had hurts and pains sometimes
[1:12:37] by their own parents.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; It's them that's talking about the
[1:12:43] subject of forgiveness. I know it's
[1:12:45] within me. I know. But it's hard to
[1:12:48] forgive.
[1:12:50] We're living in quite a generation,
[1:12:51] friends, if it's in our young people
[1:12:53] that they already have. They're asking
[1:12:55] God, "Help me to forgive.
[1:12:59] help me. And I said to one young person,
[1:13:01] I said, "We release forgiveness to that
[1:13:04] person
[1:13:06] for our own freedom,
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; not waiting for someone else to make it
[1:13:11] right.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Because that person may never change,
[1:13:14] but we can be free when we release
[1:13:17] forgiveness." How many believe that
[1:13:19] Christ released forgiveness from the
[1:13:20] cross for us? And we hadn't even
[1:13:22] repented yet, but he just released
[1:13:24] forgiveness to us. It came forth from
[1:13:27] Calvary.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; God loved us that much.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; If Christ just released his forgiveness
[1:13:34] to us, how can we restrain it and hold
[1:13:36] it back from others that have done us
[1:13:38] wrong? This is how we rebuild. Can you
[1:13:41] say amen? And I remind you of Proverbs
[1:13:43] 3:5.
[1:13:46] Trust the Lord with all of thine heart
[1:13:47] and lean not to thine own understanding.
[1:13:50] Never buy into the idea that this is
[1:13:52] impossible. This is our goal to trust
[1:13:54] the Lord with all of our heart. As I'm
[1:13:56] closing tonight, how many would raise
[1:13:58] your hand and say, "I want to trust the
[1:13:59] Lord with all of my heart and not lean
[1:14:02] to my own understanding." Never buy into
[1:14:05] the idea that this is impossible. It's
[1:14:07] our It's actually our only hope. It's
[1:14:10] our only hope that we trust the Lord
[1:14:12] with all of our heart.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil talk you out of it.
[1:14:16] Trust can be re rebuilt back in God
[1:14:18] again. Trust can be built back in people
[1:14:21] again. How many believe it can be built
[1:14:23] back in God? It can it can be built back
[1:14:25] in people again.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; But the thing with it is is that when
[1:14:29] your ultimate is when God, you have to
[1:14:32] have your ultimate in God and your trust
[1:14:34] and security in God's faithfulness
[1:14:37] because people may still fail you
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; because they're human beings.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; But if you're strong, you release for
[1:14:45] forgiveness. You can have relationship
[1:14:47] anyway. We're built to have
[1:14:48] relationships. but always having our
[1:14:51] boundary up to say, "I won't let that
[1:14:54] hurt get to my heart anymore because I'm
[1:14:57] secure and free in the Lord." Is that
[1:15:00] okay? Here is why it's so important and
[1:15:02] no doubt why it's part of the truth of
[1:15:03] what we see. And brother Brandham
[1:15:05] bringing it. He cares. Do you care? It
[1:15:07] is. It it it is it will bring and I just
[1:15:09] want to Ted Instrom said this. This is
[1:15:13] I'm closing on some of these things.
[1:15:14] When there is a strong trust, listen
[1:15:17] now. When there is a strong trust, a
[1:15:20] person tends to be more open and less
[1:15:23] defensive.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; When there is a strong trust, a person
[1:15:29] tends to be more open and less
[1:15:32] defensive. He doesn't have to spend time
[1:15:35] proving something. Facades can drop and
[1:15:39] be replaced with directness and honesty.
[1:15:43] Why? Because they have a strong trust.
[1:15:50] God can heal your broken heart,
[1:15:55] but you need to give him all the pieces.
[1:16:02] If we're not willing to give him all the
[1:16:04] pieces of the hurt and the broken heart,
[1:16:07] he can't heal it.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And I mean all the pieces.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; We bring them all to him. And I bring it
[1:16:14] to you. I bring it to you to trust you.
[1:16:18] Can you say, "Man, musicians can come."
[1:16:21] How many's ever been trying to give a
[1:16:22] baby a bath and they get the shampoo in
[1:16:26] their eyes and they scream bloody
[1:16:28] murder?
[1:16:30] So, as they just grow a little bit,
[1:16:32] you're trying to teach them if they
[1:16:33] would just lift up their head
[1:16:36] and look at me,
[1:16:39] then the water would drop off and they
[1:16:41] wouldn't get it in their eyes. How many
[1:16:43] times have you tried to tell? But they
[1:16:45] don't trust you. They get scared of the
[1:16:47] shampoo. It's going to get in my eyes.
[1:16:50] And they put their head down. It gets in
[1:16:51] their eyes again. And they scream bloody
[1:16:53] murder murder again.
[1:16:56] That's right. And what's the references
[1:16:59] in scripture, especially at the end
[1:17:01] time? Look up. Lift up your head.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; You get scared, you put your head down.
[1:17:06] But he wants us to keep looking up at
[1:17:08] him because then when he's washing us,
[1:17:10] it just goes, it doesn't get in our
[1:17:12] eyes. A child has to learn to trust the
[1:17:15] one who's given him a bath. Can you say
[1:17:17] amen? We have to learn to trust the Lord
[1:17:20] 110%.
[1:17:22] And when you come to trials that are
[1:17:24] testing that, say, Lord, I know I'm
[1:17:26] being tested right now. Everything in my
[1:17:28] life is being tested. But the greatest
[1:17:30] thing he's trying to teach me is how
[1:17:32] much do I really trust the Lord?
[1:17:36] Do I got what Abraham I'm Abraham's seed
[1:17:38] but do I have what Abraham had to say
[1:17:41] take thy son thine only son God if I'm
[1:17:44] missing that give me that kind of trust
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; that for my finances for my emotional
[1:17:49] well-being for my soul whatever it is
[1:17:52] tomorrow if I don't know how to pay
[1:17:54] bills. I don't care what comes my way. I
[1:17:57] am going to trust my God because he's
[1:17:59] bigger than any problem. He's bigger.
[1:18:01] Can you say amen? I'm trusting him. I'm
[1:18:04] trusting in the deepest times when I
[1:18:06] don't understand and I can't even
[1:18:08] understand God. I'm going to stand here
[1:18:10] and trust him because he's got a track
[1:18:12] record that's never failed.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to give any answers
[1:18:16] to anything except utter the words,
[1:18:18] "Lord, I completely trust you 110%."
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And we will come out of this by the
[1:18:24] grace of God. That's the kind of trust
[1:18:27] level he wants to be. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:18:30] stand together. Do you love the Lord
[1:18:31] tonight? Trust and obey.
[1:18:36] For there's no other way
[1:18:39] to be happy in Jesus
[1:18:44] but to trust
[1:18:46] and oy.
[1:18:48] Oh, trusting and oy
[1:18:54] for there's no other
[1:18:57] way
[1:18:58] to be happy
[1:19:01] in Jesus
[1:19:05] but to trust and oy
[1:19:10] when we walk with the Lord
[1:19:16] in the light
[1:19:18] his word.
[1:19:20] What a glory
[1:19:23] he sheds on our way. Hallelujah. Think
[1:19:29] about it now. While we do his good will,
[1:19:35] he abides
[1:19:37] with us still
[1:19:40] and with all who will trust. How many
[1:19:44] raise your hand say, I want to trust him
[1:19:46] that way. I want to just let him go.
[1:19:47] Give it to him. Oh, trust and oy
[1:19:54] for there's no other way
[1:19:58] to be happy
[1:20:01] in Jesus
[1:20:05] but to trust and oy.
[1:20:10] Not a shadow
[1:20:12] can rise,
[1:20:14] not a cloud in the skies,
[1:20:19] but his smile quickly
[1:20:22] drives it away.
[1:20:26] Yes, it does.
[1:20:28] Not a doubt,
[1:20:31] amen. Not a sign, nor a te can abide.
[1:20:38] Why we What a place to live. What a
[1:20:43] place to live tonight. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:20:46] trust and know
[1:20:50] for there's no other way
[1:20:54] to be happy in Jesus
[1:21:01] but to trust and oh, I love this.
[1:21:05] Hallelujah. I love it. Not a burden
[1:21:10] we bear, not a sorrow
[1:21:15] we share, but our toil he does richly.
[1:21:20] He's going to repay.
[1:21:24] Oh yes. Not a grief nor a loss, not a
[1:21:30] frown or a cross, but is blessed if we
[1:21:37] trust and oy.
[1:21:43] Trust and oy
[1:21:47] for there's no other way to be happy in
[1:21:54] Jesus
[1:21:57] but to trust and oy.
[1:22:02] There's another verse. Let's sing it.
[1:22:04] But we never can prove
[1:22:09] the delights of his love
[1:22:13] until all
[1:22:16] the altar
[1:22:18] we lay. That's right.
[1:22:22] For the favor he shows and the joy he
[1:22:29] bestows
[1:22:31] are for them who will trust. Are we
[1:22:35] going to do it tonight? Such blessing
[1:22:38] within.
[1:22:40] Oh trust and oy
[1:22:44] for there's no other way to be happy in
[1:22:51] Jesus
[1:22:55] but to trust and oy
[1:23:00] just reach your hand towards the Lord as
[1:23:02] we close the service tonight wherever
[1:23:04] you are
[1:23:06] you know when we lift our hands it's a
[1:23:08] sign of surrender
[1:23:09] So when we pray together tonight and
[1:23:11] leave this place, let there be a
[1:23:14] completely
[1:23:16] surrendered heart, completely trusting
[1:23:19] heart.
[1:23:21] We trust him with our lives. We trust
[1:23:23] him with the confessions of our soul,
[1:23:25] our spirit. We trust him when there's
[1:23:29] pain. We trust him. When there's
[1:23:31] something secret and hidden, we trust
[1:23:33] him that he's going to have our good in
[1:23:35] mind. We trust him with it. And Father,
[1:23:37] as we leave this place tonight, Lord,
[1:23:40] may your presence go with us, Lord, with
[1:23:43] your heart, Lord. And we've we've seen a
[1:23:46] a part of your heart tonight, Lord,
[1:23:47] that's been expressed to us. Oh, how you
[1:23:50] love us, Lord. How you care for us,
[1:23:52] Lord. May we show that we care, Father.
[1:23:56] May we not buy into this age of lies and
[1:24:00] begin to mistrust everything and get
[1:24:02] bitter and cynical, Lord, and critical.
[1:24:06] Oh God, forgive us. Help us to be free.
[1:24:09] Help us to have that spontaneity, Lord,
[1:24:12] to have relationships that are opened
[1:24:14] and Lord, with one another and
[1:24:17] especially with you, Lord. No guilt, no
[1:24:20] condemnation, no shame. As Adam and Eve,
[1:24:23] Lord, walked in the garden, the cool of
[1:24:25] the day, and there was no guilt. There
[1:24:27] was perfect fellowship with you. No sin,
[1:24:31] no hesitance, just free fellowship,
[1:24:34] walking in the cool of the day. You've
[1:24:36] restored us back to that, Lord. And I
[1:24:38] pray you'll grant it for these precious
[1:24:41] souls tonight. We go in your name
[1:24:43] tonight. We go in your presence. Grant
[1:24:46] every need, we pray, and commit it to
[1:24:48] you as we go on until we meet together
[1:24:50] Sunday. Lord, we pray you'll protect us.
[1:24:52] Put your angels around us. We ask it in
[1:24:55] Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you all in
[1:24:59] Christian love tonight. If you have a
[1:25:01] need, come forward. We'll be glad to
[1:25:03] pray with you. Take that before the
[1:25:05] Lord. I trust the word has been a
[1:25:07] blessing to you tonight. Encourage you,
[1:25:09] strengthen you. And he gives us these
[1:25:12] nuggets, these golden nuggets, this
[1:25:14] pearl of great price. We can't put a
[1:25:17] price tag on what the Lord gives us. Can
[1:25:20] you say amen? God bless you as you
[1:25:22] dismiss this evening. Got another key.
[1:25:24] Trust and oy
[1:25:28] for there's no other way
[1:25:33] to be happy
[1:25:36] in Jesus
[1:25:39] but to trust. We're going to sing Jesus.
[1:25:45] We're depending on you. Oh Jesus,
[1:25:51] we're depending on you.
[1:25:55] Jesus,
[1:25:57] we're depending on you.
[1:26:00] Depending on you
[1:26:03] to see. Oh, one more time. Jesus,
[1:26:09] we're depending on you.
[1:26:12] Jesus,
[1:26:14] we're depending on you.
[1:26:18] Jesus,
[1:26:20] we're depending on you.
[1:26:23] Depending on you to see us through.
[1:26:29] Israel came to the water. They didn't
[1:26:32] know what to do. There was no one to
[1:26:36] help them. They couldn't see their way
[1:26:38] through.
[1:26:40] Lord, you moved the water and they
[1:26:43] walked right on through. Oh Jesus, we're
[1:26:49] trusting you, Lord. Trusting you, Lord.
[1:26:52] Jesus.
[1:26:58] Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:02] Oh Jesus, we trust you, Lord. Depending
[1:27:06] on you,
[1:27:08] depending on you to see us through. When
[1:27:13] your face tried by fire, you don't know
[1:27:17] what to do. You know the devil's a liar.
[1:27:21] There's not much he can do.
[1:27:24] Although he tries to stop us, we know
[1:27:28] you'll see us through. Oh Jesus, we're
[1:27:32] depending on you. Aren't you glad we're
[1:27:34] depending on Jesus,
[1:27:42] Jesus? Oh, we're depending on you,
[1:27:47] Jesus.
[1:27:49] We're depending on you.
[1:27:52] Depending on you to see through. When
[1:27:58] you're face trapped by fire, you don't
[1:28:01] know what to do. You know the devil's
[1:28:04] alive. There's not much you can do.
[1:28:09] Tries hard to stop us. We know you'll
[1:28:12] see us through. Oh Jesus, more than
[1:28:16] ever, Lord, we're depending on you,
[1:28:21] Jesus. We're depending on you,
[1:28:25] Jesus.
[1:28:31] Jesus,
[1:28:33] we're depending on you. Depending on you
[1:28:38] to see us through
[1:28:42] the water, they didn't know what to do.
[1:28:47] There was no one to help them. Couldn't
[1:28:50] see their way through.
[1:28:52] Lord, you move the water and they walked
[1:28:56] right on through. I'm glad that Jesus
[1:28:58] moved through on you. Aren't you glad we
[1:29:01] can trust the Lord and I, Jesus?
[1:29:08] Jesus
[1:29:11] depended on you.
[1:29:14] Jesus
[1:29:16] depended on you.
[1:29:19] depending on you to see us through.
[1:29:25] Amen. More than ever
[1:29:29] before.
[1:29:31] Lord, I love you
[1:29:37] more than ever
[1:29:40] before.
[1:29:42] Lord, I need you
[1:29:48] more than ever
[1:29:52] before.
[1:29:53] I want to tell you
[1:29:59] I love you now
[1:30:02] more than ever
[1:30:06] before.
[1:30:11] more than ever
[1:30:14] before.
[1:30:16] Lord, I
[1:30:18] Lord, I really love you
[1:30:22] more than ever
[1:30:25] before.
[1:30:27] Lord, I need you
[1:30:32] more than ever
[1:30:35] before.
[1:30:37] I want to tell you
[1:30:42] I love you now
[1:30:46] more than ever
[1:30:48] before.
[1:30:52] More
