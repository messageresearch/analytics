[5:00] the glory belongs to
[5:05] you for we know in part and we prophesy
[5:08] in part but when that which is perfect
[5:11] is come then that which is in part shall
[5:14] be done away what he means by that that
[5:16] one day which I believe we're in that
[5:18] time uh we will come to a time that's
[5:21] not seeing Christ in a partial
[5:22] Revelation but a perfect Revelation and
[5:25] that's prophesied for the end time
[5:27] that's Paul's prophecy here when that
[5:29] was which is perfect is come so aren't
[5:31] you happy this morning that you live in
[5:33] the time that we will see a perfect
[5:35] vision of Christ not just the partial
[5:38] Revelation when I was a child I spake as
[5:40] a child I understood as a child I
[5:42] thought as a child but when I became a
[5:44] man I put away childish things for now
[5:48] we see through a glass Darkly and this
[5:51] is the scriptures I'll get to today for
[5:53] now we see through a glass Darkly but
[5:56] then face to face now I know in part in
[6:00] portion in in a partial uh Vision now I
[6:03] see a partial Vision but then but then
[6:07] shall I know even as also I am known we
[6:10] want to uh preach on these things today
[6:12] because what a great Revelation to see
[6:15] and to be known by him but not only will
[6:18] he we we we be we are known by him but
[6:21] we will know him in his fullness he will
[6:24] know us in our fullness and we will know
[6:26] him in his fullness because it's a
[6:28] face-to-face relationship
[6:30] and now abide of faith hope charity
[6:34] Divine love these three but the greatest
[6:37] of these is divine love so we want to
[6:39] just uh try to wrap up the last few
[6:42] verses of 1 Corinthians 13 and if you're
[6:45] a Christian I'm sure you've studied the
[6:47] scripture and looked at these things
[6:48] we've enjoyed looking through the whole
[6:50] chapter is has called it a bit of a
[6:52] window outside of the correction that
[6:54] Paul was given to the Corinthian Church
[6:56] who had leaned towards emotionalism and
[6:58] leaned towards 's prophecies and made
[7:00] such an emphasis on those things U that
[7:03] Paul right in the middle of all of his
[7:04] correction to put the gifts in order and
[7:06] all that right in the middle of it he
[7:07] has this little window into the more
[7:09] excellent way he says he says that all
[7:12] these gifts covet the best gifts they're
[7:14] wonderful they're of God but yet I show
[7:16] unto you a more excellent way and then
[7:18] he breaks into what that more excellent
[7:20] way is and ends the chapter with a
[7:22] prophecy saying that we'll actually come
[7:24] to a more perfect way at the end time
[7:27] and when we see him in that way face to
[7:29] face we will the bride will come into
[7:31] this victory in Divine love how many
[7:34] believe that this morning so because
[7:36] it's a prophecy for our day then it
[7:38] becomes a very significant thing for us
[7:41] to look at and to realize and I would
[7:43] just like to talk about this
[7:45] face-to-face moving into a face-to-face
[7:47] relationship with Christ and I'll just
[7:50] say that it's really the only entrance
[7:52] into this excellent way how many would
[7:54] raise your hand and say I if God said I
[7:56] could live in this victory in Divine
[7:58] love and live in this more excellent way
[8:00] how many raise your hand say I want to
[8:01] live there every day and so Paul shows
[8:04] us the entrance to this more excellent
[8:06] way is a face-to-face relationship with
[8:09] Christ not a partial and when he uses
[8:11] the term we see through a glass Darkly
[8:14] it's a symbol it's a it's a word picture
[8:16] to show us uh it could be a mirror it
[8:18] could be a looking through a window
[8:20] that's clouded uh if I had an example
[8:23] this morning I have a window and so it's
[8:24] nothing worse than trying to look
[8:26] through a window and see something
[8:27] clearly and it's it's clouded with
[8:28] something something sprayed on it and so
[8:31] you have a partial vision of who's
[8:32] behind the window you can see it's Jesus
[8:35] you can see a works of Jesus you can see
[8:38] someone's back there but you never can
[8:40] see it perfectly clearly and he says
[8:43] throughout Seven Ages we've seen through
[8:45] a glass Darkly Christ has done things
[8:48] he's manifested his power we know it's
[8:50] Christ behind there but we we a
[8:52] prophecies is seeing him in part we
[8:54] we're living at a level of seeing him in
[8:56] part but there's a a more powerful
[8:59] relationship coming to the church at the
[9:01] end time that we don't see him through a
[9:03] glass Darkly but we see him face to face
[9:05] for years it's feel I feel like there's
[9:07] so many conventions says we got it we
[9:09] got it we're the bride we got it but
[9:11] you've got to find a you got to harness
[9:13] that into an everyday
[9:16] life praise the Lord you may have
[9:19] something and you know what I'll tell
[9:20] you when you have the perfect word come
[9:22] to you you do have
[9:24] something but it doesn't mean the
[9:26] Perfection has come to you yet person
[9:30] see he's not just he's not just bringing
[9:32] a perfect word which he has but he's
[9:34] bringing his people to Perfection and
[9:36] maturity and remember when Jesus said be
[9:38] ye therefore perfect it didn't mean
[9:40] Flawless or or something like that in
[9:43] the flesh it meant growth to
[9:46] maturity that's what he meant said be
[9:48] perfect as your fathers and it's growth
[9:49] to maturity if we're not growing in the
[9:51] word and in the vision we see of Christ
[9:53] then then we're not going anywhere and
[9:55] so that's what he wants to take his
[9:57] people to perfection I got it I got it I
[10:00] got it but he didn't know what he had we
[10:02] need to know what we have but not just
[10:04] praise and worship and Shout over what
[10:06] we have and that maybe we're better than
[10:08] everybody else get rid of all that i'
[10:10] I've got something I but let the Holy
[10:12] Spirit take what you got and bring you
[10:15] to a perfection in it is that okay with
[10:18] everybody so what what we are what we
[10:21] are called to in this present time what
[10:23] are we called to living in a more
[10:25] perfect understanding of him with Divine
[10:28] love love as our motive for everything
[10:31] that we
[10:33] do living in a more perfect
[10:36] understanding of him this is what Paul's
[10:38] saying living in a more perfect
[10:40] understanding of him with Divine love is
[10:43] the motive for everything that we do
[10:45] every gift everything that we do every
[10:47] every reaction to people we've been
[10:49] preaching this everything that comes in
[10:50] life every trial if we're in that realm
[10:53] of divine love then our reaction is
[10:55] divine love and that's because we have a
[10:57] perfect understanding or we're growing
[10:59] into a perfect understanding of who
[11:01] Christ is we're wanting that to work
[11:03] through our lives if we I I and and
[11:06] listen now if we don't have distinctions
[11:09] from the rest of churches in in our
[11:11] character then we are really like the
[11:14] rest and sometimes we can put down the
[11:16] other churches and I don't think that's
[11:18] right
[11:21] either say well we're different we're
[11:23] better we you know we have we're better
[11:26] than denominations we're better than
[11:27] these other churches well let's see the
[11:29] character of Christ because the
[11:32] distinctions isn't that you have a
[11:33] building or that you have good music or
[11:36] that you have good preachers the
[11:37] distinction the distinction there has to
[11:39] be a further distinction is Christ
[11:41] himself living in the
[11:44] people Jesus said something interesting
[11:47] in Matthew 5 he said for if we love them
[11:50] if you love them that love you what
[11:54] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[11:56] the
[11:57] same so he's saying that you know if
[12:00] you're have the same characteristics of
[12:03] only loving those that you want to love
[12:05] and you're selective in your love then
[12:07] you're really not any different than the
[12:08] rest of people Jesus is teaching it I'm
[12:11] not and then he says and if you salute
[12:14] or greet your brethren only what do ye
[12:18] more than others the publicans do the
[12:20] same they have their click they have
[12:22] their Clan and they greet one another
[12:24] and kind of ditch everybody else we're
[12:26] the elite group and he says if you're
[12:28] doing that amongst yourself as Brethren
[12:30] you're really not much different in
[12:32] character than what they
[12:34] are praise the Lord I'm always safe when
[12:38] I'm teaching what Jesus
[12:39] said can you say Amen because you if
[12:42] you're a Believer you have to say amen
[12:44] and Jesus said you better watch it
[12:46] because you get amongst yourself and
[12:47] then you become partial you become
[12:50] selective you become I got my own group
[12:52] here and so now your love becomes
[12:54] selective to your only your friends can
[12:56] you say amen I used to say say it this
[12:59] way you invite so and so your real
[13:00] friend over and you serve them steak and
[13:03] the other people you're a little leery
[13:04] of but maybe you have them over and you
[13:05] have them over hot
[13:09] dogs see that's being being it's showing
[13:12] up your attitude towards them is showing
[13:14] up and we don't have to a right to be
[13:16] respector persons like that we can't
[13:18] come into this if you salute your
[13:20] brethren only why do you're not doing
[13:22] anything than the different than the
[13:23] others do not even the publicans and
[13:26] then his next script next thing he says
[13:28] is be therefore perfect even as your
[13:31] father which is in heaven is perfect
[13:33] perfect in other words we're moving out
[13:35] of that that selective love we're moving
[13:37] out of that partiality we're moving out
[13:40] of that that thing that is a respector
[13:42] of persons if that's working amongst the
[13:45] kingdom of God and the people of God
[13:47] then it's not the maturity of divine
[13:48] love
[13:50] yet what do ye more than others how are
[13:53] you different than denominations when we
[13:55] say we have the only way when we say we
[13:57] have the only way now now there's no
[13:59] other way through than through our way
[14:01] how are we any different than a
[14:04] denomination the word is the way the
[14:07] word is the only way Christ is the only
[14:10] way a glass Darkly when we have God
[14:13] doing things through the seven Church
[14:14] ages and he Paul says we see through
[14:17] glass Darkly now showing gifts showing
[14:19] wisdom showing the supernatural praise
[14:21] God all the manifestations of God for
[14:23] seven Church ages but he says still
[14:25] we're still seeing Christ through a
[14:27] glass Darkly even though all these
[14:29] manifestations of God has happened and
[14:31] are still happening I praise God for it
[14:34] but we're still only seeing him through
[14:35] a glass Darkly seeing him through a
[14:37] cloudy glass at its very best and then
[14:40] because we can't completely see him we
[14:42] start to get off track to other things
[14:44] other than him be ye Perfect by the holy
[14:49] ghost moving into you that's what that
[14:51] means that growth to Perfection be ye
[14:54] perfect means by the Holy Ghost we move
[14:57] into something deeper
[14:59] than uh the denominational Creeds has to
[15:02] offer we have not moved to Perfection
[15:05] just because God has given us a perfect
[15:11] word we have not moved to Perfection
[15:14] just because God has blessed us with the
[15:17] perfect
[15:21] word but we have the right thing to look
[15:26] at we have the right vision to look at
[15:29] we have the right vision of Christ to
[15:31] look at so that it can change us and
[15:34] that we can move into more Divine love
[15:36] can you say in mind we haven't reached
[15:38] Perfection because we have God has given
[15:40] us the perfect word by Divine
[15:42] Vindication he has given us that and I'm
[15:44] going to read that quote to you in a
[15:45] minute if I get to it we have that that
[15:47] perfect inter interpretation by Divine
[15:50] Vindication we're blessed with that but
[15:52] you see now just because we have that
[15:54] doesn't mean that we have moved to
[15:56] Perfection but we have the praise God
[15:59] this morning we have the right thing to
[16:01] be looking at it if you look at the
[16:03] right thing and look at this vision of
[16:06] Christ God will change you from glory to
[16:13] glory we see through a glass Darkly and
[16:16] it's that means it's an imperfect view
[16:19] of Christ but when he starts removing
[16:21] the Veil uncovering The Book of
[16:23] Revelation means unveiling Revelation
[16:25] means unveiling he he begins cleaning
[16:28] the glass whatever you want to call it
[16:29] when it's it's it's not just that we
[16:31] become greater intellectually when God
[16:33] does that than the rest of the churches
[16:36] when he starts unveiling it's to bring
[16:38] something deeper in our lives Christ The
[16:41] Mystery of God revealed Christ in you
[16:44] the hope of
[16:45] glory and so when he unveils it's not
[16:48] just to make us smarter than everybody
[16:51] else it's not to give us more Pride but
[16:53] it's to bring more of the mystery of
[16:55] Christ in your own life manifested every
[16:57] day that's what he sends it for so you
[17:00] can see Christ clearly and when you see
[17:02] Christ clearly in Perfection then God
[17:05] can transform you in your life say well
[17:08] what's my problem brother Paul you're
[17:09] probably looking at other things more
[17:12] than you're looking into the
[17:16] word and I say that as a as a conviction
[17:18] to my own life we are so busy we are so
[17:21] distracted we have so many
[17:22] responsibilities how much time is spent
[17:24] looking in the word of God because
[17:26] that's how we see this picture the word
[17:27] the message can you say Amen we see
[17:29] another portion of Christ how much are
[17:32] we given to do that because that's the
[17:34] thing Satan makes us Overlook it Satan
[17:36] makes he puts uh he he taints the
[17:38] message he makes people afraid of the
[17:40] message and he does that for a reason
[17:42] because the power is looking into that
[17:44] character of Christ through the word and
[17:47] we catch something Satan does not want
[17:50] that to happen that's right you become a
[17:52] Powerhouse for the kingdom of God so we
[17:55] might be looking at the wrong thing can
[17:57] I have an amen this morning morning you
[17:59] might be took looking too much instead
[18:01] of into the message and into your Bible
[18:04] amen but when when he starts unveiling
[18:06] and uncovering it's more than just to
[18:08] make us a greater intellectual Church
[18:11] than the other churches then I will know
[18:13] him as he knows me this is the final
[18:15] thought ends that Paul ends and I'm
[18:17] trying to make it a final thought too
[18:19] this is what he ends on is that I when I
[18:22] see him face to face then I will know
[18:25] him as he knows me right I'm going to
[18:28] elaborate on that in a minute this is
[18:30] the final thought Paul brings in this a
[18:33] full knowing a full knowing of Christ
[18:37] and Christ fully knowing you now that's
[18:41] a given that he knows
[18:43] us there's two main revelations in a
[18:46] Christian Life that a Christian that a
[18:48] Believer needs and uh these things are
[18:51] Beyond any gift or Beyond any knowledge
[18:53] Beyond physical healing by the atonement
[18:56] of Jesus Christ this is deeper and first
[18:59] of all we need a revelation that he
[19:01] knows
[19:04] us he knows me he knows my
[19:08] name I have a maker he knows he knows my
[19:12] every thought you say well why are you
[19:15] saying this because there are people
[19:16] that even in tend church and they don't
[19:18] realize God knows you inside and out am
[19:23] let me say it this way God does not have
[19:25] a partial revelation of you
[19:30] he doesn't see you through a glass
[19:33] Darkly even though there are some people
[19:35] that would like God to be looking at
[19:37] them through a glass Darkly because they
[19:39] can hide some
[19:41] things but God does not see you in your
[19:46] life and your past he doesn't see you
[19:48] through a glass Darkly he knows you 100%
[19:54] completely he knows what you done and
[19:56] then the power of forgiveness that God
[19:58] forgive me I put that under your blood
[20:00] then he forgets that he can't remember
[20:01] it anymore boy that's the love of
[20:04] God praise God that's the love of God
[20:08] and when I talk about him knowing you
[20:11] then transfer it over us knowing him
[20:13] because when we have a face to face like
[20:15] he has a face and sees your whole life
[20:17] the love of God kicks in it must because
[20:20] he says if you'll repent and bring that
[20:22] past under the blood I can't see that
[20:25] anymore that part's over can you say
[20:27] Amen talk about a complete picture of
[20:30] you he doesn't see you through a glass
[20:33] Darkly he sees you face to face he sees
[20:36] everything that you
[20:38] are amen so that's the first part in a
[20:42] Christian is coming to and you would
[20:44] like to be able to say that all the
[20:47] Believers and everybody everybody sees
[20:49] how much God knows them but a lot of
[20:52] people think they still have a private
[20:55] life that they're hiding from God and
[20:58] they have a a little secret thing that
[21:00] they do it's not healthy it's wearing
[21:03] out spiritually and but they're going to
[21:05] hold on to that because that's my little
[21:07] private
[21:09] world all the time thinking when nobody
[21:11] at the church sees it the pastor I'm
[21:13] really glad he don't see
[21:14] it and then you buy into the thing that
[21:17] God doesn't see it guess
[21:20] what I hate to be the messenger of bad
[21:23] news God sees
[21:26] everything he seen what you looked at
[21:29] last night on your phone every detail
[21:33] he's an infinite God he knows all things
[21:36] from the end to the beginning he knows
[21:38] he sees
[21:41] it why does this need to be a revelation
[21:44] before the revelation of seeing Christ
[21:46] clearly because you need to know that
[21:48] God knows you and there's nothing that
[21:49] you can hide from God this morning in
[21:52] church and it gets a little bit more
[21:53] exposing when you're in church because
[21:54] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[21:56] and intents of the heart I'm preaching
[21:58] with that word this morning and that
[22:00] Holy Ghost is upon me and it could I
[22:02] don't know you but it could say anything
[22:04] right now that exactly pegs exactly what
[22:06] you're doing there was a mom that come
[22:08] to me and says thank you for two or
[22:10] three weeks ago so when you talk to the
[22:12] young people and just gave them a little
[22:13] warning about what they're looking at
[22:15] she said thank you she said because God
[22:17] dealt with me the Wednesday before of
[22:19] the same thing and her and her husband
[22:21] just the same thing and I said that's
[22:22] just the Holy Spirit not just speaking
[22:24] through the preachers but he's speaking
[22:26] through the mothers the fathers if we're
[22:28] in tune with him he's going to drop
[22:29] things in our hearts can you say Amen
[22:32] the word is a discerner he's not going
[22:34] to let things just happen under the
[22:35] current he's going to expose it when you
[22:37] come to church I don't know if I like
[22:39] just going to church because it's too
[22:40] exposing yes because he's here and he
[22:43] knows you Paula fante doesn't know you
[22:46] unless you share something but he knows
[22:48] every detail of your life this morning
[22:51] and yet and yet he has unlimited love
[22:54] for
[22:56] you he loves he knows you here's the
[23:00] song Gloria Gaz wrote the one who knows
[23:02] you the most loves you the most the one
[23:05] who knows me the most loves me the most
[23:09] you see when I talk about these things
[23:10] and how he looks at us I pray you
[23:13] transfer over now that when we're really
[23:15] looking clearly at his
[23:18] face it should bring this Divine love
[23:22] that we look at we won't look at God or
[23:25] one another with a partial revelation
[23:29] but with the full picture it's what
[23:31] happened with the woman they found in
[23:33] adultery and they threw her down using
[23:35] the law and say okay we found her this
[23:37] is it and then Jesus says let him that's
[23:39] without sin cast the first stone what's
[23:41] he doing the love of God is actually
[23:43] expanding their Vision because all they
[23:45] see is through a glass Darkly but Jesus
[23:48] is looking at the whole picture amen
[23:51] okay and that's why he can offer
[23:53] something else because he's looking at a
[23:55] predestinated daughter of God he's
[23:57] looking at the PO potential of what she
[23:59] can be because why he 100% there's no
[24:02] partial revelation of that woman down on
[24:03] the ground they're ready to Stone God
[24:05] doesn't see a partial Revelation or they
[24:07] see a partial Revelation and they're
[24:09] judging her based upon her acts and they
[24:12] caught her in the ACT but you cannot
[24:15] have the Divine love of God and judge by
[24:18] a partial revelation of anybody else you
[24:20] must say God help me to understand and
[24:23] see the whole
[24:24] picture and let your love motivate me
[24:27] God
[24:28] knows everything about
[24:30] you your ins and outs your ups and downs
[24:33] your life your story your your past your
[24:37] present your personality Satan God knows
[24:40] you completely he knows how you tick he
[24:43] knows your bench he knows your
[24:44] weaknesses but Satan has studied
[24:47] you and how you tick how to tempt you
[24:50] right so both of these have had long
[24:54] studies in you but you won't take the
[24:57] time to study it as much as Satan does
[25:00] you won't figure out you and your
[25:03] weaknesses and how Satan can get
[25:05] you how your mind
[25:08] works praise the Lord so he knows you
[25:12] this morning and he knows everything
[25:14] about you and he you can't hide that
[25:16] from him you think you're hiding it on
[25:18] your phone you think you're hiding it in
[25:20] private you think you're hiding it on
[25:21] your computer but I'm here to tell you
[25:23] you're not hiding anything from
[25:25] him he sees everything every detail of
[25:29] your life grieve not the Holy Spirit
[25:31] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[25:33] your Redemption Paul teaching that shows
[25:36] us that we as Holy Ghost Christians can
[25:39] grieve the Holy Spirit doesn't mean he
[25:41] doesn't love us doesn't mean he's giving
[25:42] up on us but he just he just just he's
[25:45] grieved by what you're looking
[25:48] at the reason you do it the reason I
[25:51] anybody would do it is because you feel
[25:53] like there's certain places rooms
[25:56] quietness dirty little secrets there's
[26:00] certain things that are not under the
[26:02] visibility of God and that such a
[26:05] lie he sees it all and he's and he he's
[26:10] already has a plan and a word in place
[26:13] for your life you going to keep going
[26:15] down that road you're my son I have a
[26:19] plan already for
[26:22] you you can buck up against it you can
[26:24] resist it but if you're a son you come
[26:27] hard you come easy I've said this for
[26:29] years if you're a son and daughter of
[26:30] God you either come hard or you come
[26:32] easy but you're coming because all the
[26:34] father hath given me will
[26:36] come what does that Force demanding no
[26:42] love unconditional love that's what it
[26:46] is so he knows every detail of your life
[26:50] maybe that'll help somebody live
[26:51] different this week in their
[26:53] privacy amen can't hide it from God he
[26:56] knows you inside it out and yet yet when
[26:59] he looks at our lives and sees our
[27:01] weaknesses and sees our
[27:03] mistakes he would give up except for he
[27:06] sees the whole thing which means he's
[27:07] seen a predestinated seat of
[27:11] God oh if we could all look at one
[27:13] another that
[27:14] way if we could all have that kind of
[27:18] divine
[27:19] looking but he sees and I'm so glad he
[27:22] seen me that way beauty is in the eyes
[27:24] of the
[27:26] beholder he sees me for who I really am
[27:29] so the Revelation that he knows us he
[27:31] knows us and yet he loves us yet there's
[27:34] something reaching out in his heart to
[27:37] to look at us with the whole picture of
[27:39] a predestinated son and daughter of God
[27:41] and so now there's the two knowings that
[27:44] a in a Christian Life is n number one
[27:46] and when the son of man was M man
[27:49] manifested this day showing he showed us
[27:52] he knows everything about us knows our
[27:54] house number knows where we live He
[27:56] Knows My Name he knows my every thought
[27:59] I have a maker can you say amen he knows
[28:02] my name he knows my heart he knows my
[28:04] every thought praise the lord it's not
