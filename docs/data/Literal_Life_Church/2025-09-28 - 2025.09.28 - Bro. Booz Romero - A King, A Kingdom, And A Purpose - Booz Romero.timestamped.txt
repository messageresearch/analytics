[22:23] great sorrow,
[22:26] but God gives
[22:29] a song. Aren't you glad? Oh, in the

[28:02] [Music]
[28:05] [Applause]
[28:12] Praise the Lord.
[28:14] Hallelujah. Is that what you want to do
[28:17] this morning? Let's all stand. Every
[28:20] day,
[28:23] every hour,
[28:26] you are faithful,
[28:30] Lord.
[28:32] Every day,
[28:36] every hour
[28:38] you are faithful.
[28:42] Every day,
[28:44] every day,
[28:47] every hour you are, you are faithful.
[28:54] Oh, is he faithful? You are faithful.
[29:02] You are faithful.
[29:05] Tell them this morning with your hands
[29:07] lifted up, you are faithful.
[29:11] Oh
[29:12] yes, you are faithful. Sing every day.
[29:17] Oh,
[29:20] every day,
[29:23] every hour. Lord, you are faithful.
[29:28] Oh,
[29:31] every day,
[29:34] every hour. Oh, you are faithful
[29:41] Lord
[29:43] and faithful.
[29:46] Oh,
[29:49] you are faithful.
[29:52] Yes, you are. Oh,
[29:55] you are faithful,
[29:58] oh Lord.
[30:01] You are faithful,
[30:04] oh Lord.
[30:07] Amen. Can you say that with your heart
[30:09] this morning?
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Is he faithful?
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; The beauty of the promise is even though
[30:17] you may be unfaithful,
[30:20] he remains the same.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; He remains faithful. So we're with
[30:25] gratitude in our hearts, we can be in
[30:27] his house and say, "Lord, thank you
[30:29] because you're faithful. Thank you
[30:31] because you're still in the in the in
[30:33] the forgiving of my mistakes, in the
[30:35] forgiving of of my my like my messing up
[30:39] all the time, Father, you're still
[30:41] faithful. You're grateful for that this
[30:43] morning. Are you happy to be in the
[30:45] house of the Lord? Do you love him this
[30:47] morning?"
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's good to be here. So, if
[30:51] you have your Bibles, let's go straight
[30:53] to the word of God. Um, I have some
[30:56] slides here. If you don't have your
[30:57] Bible, well, God bless you. If you have
[31:00] your Bible, praise the Lord, too. Um,
[31:02] I'm nervous this morning is is is not an
[31:05] easy thing to be here. And, you know,
[31:07] even though I've been coming to this
[31:08] church for so many years, every time we
[31:11] stand behind the holy desk, there is
[31:14] always like uh, you know, my voice is
[31:16] shaking or something is going on. But
[31:21] that's a good thing
[31:22] &gt;&gt; so that we can step out of the way and
[31:25] we can let God speak to what he wants to
[31:27] tell us this morning. Amen. So, uh, if
[31:30] we have our Bibles, let's go to the book
[31:32] of, uh, Psalms, uh, uh, 142
[31:37] and we're going to read verse 1 through
[31:40] verse 7. And then we're going to go to
[31:43] the book of Hebrews chap uh 11 verse 38
[31:49] through verse 40. I'm going to try to go
[31:52] slow so I can say my words the right way
[31:56] and all of that good stuff.
[31:59] Amen. So here we have in in the book of
[32:02] Psalms 142 says, "And I cried unto the
[32:06] Lord with my voice. With my voice, unto
[32:10] the Lord did I make my supplication.
[32:14] I pour out my complaint before him. I
[32:17] show before him my trouble.
[32:20] When my spirit was overwhelmed within
[32:24] me, then thou knowest my path in the way
[32:28] wherein I walk uh have the privilege
[32:31] laid a snare for me. I looked on my
[32:34] right hand and beheld, but there was no
[32:38] man that will know me. Can you imagine?
[32:40] David is writing here and he's like, I
[32:43] was seeking for help and no one was
[32:46] there to help me.
[32:49] refuge fail me. No man care for my soul.
[32:55] That's very interesting. Why is he
[32:57] referring to his soul? He's not even
[32:59] like he's talking about himself, but now
[33:01] he's going deeper and he's saying like
[33:03] no one care for my soul.
[33:06] And then I cried unto thee, oh Lord. I
[33:10] said, thou art my refuge and my portion
[33:14] in the land of the living. Attend unto
[33:17] my cry,
[33:19] for I am brought very low. Deliver me
[33:23] from my persecutors, for they are
[33:26] stronger than I.
[33:28] Bring my soul out of prison, that I may
[33:32] praise thy name. The righteous shall
[33:35] compass me about for thou shalt deal
[33:37] bount bountifully with me. Now in the
[33:41] book of Hebrews 11:38
[33:43] through verse 40
[33:47] and the scripture says on whom the world
[33:49] was not worthy they wander in deserts
[33:52] and in mountains and in dens and in in
[33:55] caves of the earth and these all having
[33:58] obtained a good report through faith
[34:01] received not the promise. God having
[34:05] provided some better thing for us that
[34:08] they without us should not be made
[34:10] perfect. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[34:12] Heavenly Father, thank you once again,
[34:14] Father, as we're in your house. Father,
[34:17] may uh you forgive us this morning,
[34:19] Lord, if in any way we have grave your
[34:21] Holy Spirit, Father. But we know that
[34:24] through the atonement now, we can
[34:26] present ourselves boldly before your
[34:28] presence, Lord, and as we haven't done
[34:31] it, Father, because that's
[34:32] justification. You have come with us
[34:34] with sanctification, justification. You
[34:37] have given us the Holy Spirit, Father,
[34:39] and now even more. The person of Jesus
[34:42] Christ is with us this morning. And not
[34:44] only with us, but is in us working from
[34:48] the inside to the outside, Father. We're
[34:50] grateful for that this morning, Lord. as
[34:52] we as humans are here hearing your word
[34:56] father is let let it not be another
[35:00] sermon father but like something that
[35:02] can change that can um bring courage to
[35:05] our souls father to our spiritual walk
[35:08] with you our Christian walk with you
[35:10] that's what we want this morning father
[35:13] may I be able to step out of the way and
[35:15] may you receive all the glory father and
[35:18] if we have something good something that
[35:21] can come good out of us that is that is
[35:23] not us father but that is you father as
[35:26] we come before you we thank you we
[35:29] commit this service in your hands in the
[35:30] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you
[35:33] may have your seats
[35:35] and a brother always said like you may
[35:37] you and and I may remain like you may
[35:40] have you may enjoy the comfort of your
[35:42] seats that as I may I remain standing
[35:45] amen so um anyway it's good it's once
[35:49] again it's good to be in the house of
[35:50] the lord Um it's always a privilege when
[35:53] you can study study the scriptures and
[35:56] then find uh the mind of the Lord for
[35:59] for for for the day. So uh this morning
[36:03] I and I think we have it here. We can go
[36:06] to slide number one but we would like to
[36:08] title this a king a kingdom and a
[36:12] purpose. A king, a kingdom and a
[36:15] purpose. And um you know last time we
[36:18] were speaking here we're talking about
[36:20] David and and we were speaking about how
[36:22] David
[36:23] already being part of the kingdom. There
[36:26] was one person that was part kind of
[36:29] related to Saul and he wanted to honor
[36:32] Saul, right? So he he wanted to um to to
[36:36] kind of uh honor the memory of the king
[36:38] that had died. So what he did he brought
[36:41] him to the table and then he he he
[36:44] became part of the kingdom right so that
[36:47] was mephibosed mephibosed became part of
[36:49] the kingdom. So you know in thinking
[36:51] about David there are so many things
[36:53] that we can study in the life of David.
[36:56] So with that in mind then the Lord just
[36:58] brought this in my heart and I was like
[37:00] let's let's go for this. I spoke a
[37:02] little bit about this when we were in um
[37:04] in Connecticut a few months ago but now
[37:06] I was studying it and the Lord was just
[37:08] changing everything. So maybe the
[37:10] scriptures are the same. My wife was
[37:12] there. So if you don't if you just kind
[37:14] of can cover your ears, but like the
[37:17] scripture may be the same, but how the
[37:19] Lord is going to bring one wants to
[37:20] bring it this morning will be maybe
[37:22] different. Amen. So again, as we said, a
[37:26] king, a kingdom, and a purpose. So
[37:31] if we see here the first thing that
[37:33] we're going to find in in the book of
[37:35] 1st Samuel chapter 22 uh let's go right
[37:40] here. So 1st Samuel chapter 22
[37:44] and and the Bible is speaking here that
[37:47] they David therefore departed dance and
[37:49] escape escape to the cave Adel and and
[37:53] when his brethren and all his father's
[37:55] house heard it and everyone he heard it
[37:58] they went down fither to him and
[38:01] everyone that was in distress and
[38:03] everyone that was in debt and everyone
[38:05] that was discontented
[38:07] gather them themselves unto him and He
[38:10] became a captain over them and there
[38:13] with him about 400 men. So
[38:19] where are they all going? They're going
[38:21] to a cave. They're going to a place that
[38:24] that that is unusual to begin to begin a
[38:28] kingdom.
[38:30] Okay. So just going to leave that
[38:31] scripture there. But if we take a little
[38:33] bit of background, you see in the Old
[38:35] Testament when the Lord met with Moses
[38:38] in Mount Si, he gave him clear
[38:41] instructions on the way the tabernacle
[38:43] was supposed to be built. You know, it
[38:45] was supposed to have an atrium, a holy
[38:47] place and in in another place that it
[38:49] was called the the holy of holies. Amen.
[38:51] And and we see that in in uh in uh
[38:54] Exodus chapter 25. And it says, "Thou
[38:57] shalt put the mercy seat above upon the
[39:00] ark. And in the ark, thou shalt put the
[39:02] testimony that I shall give thee, and
[39:05] there I will meet with thee. and I will
[39:09] commune with thee from above the mercy
[39:11] seat from the from between the cherubims
[39:14] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[39:16] of all things which I'll give thee in
[39:18] commandment unto the children of Israel.
[39:21] So this script scripture to me has a lot
[39:25] of meaning because when the Lord comes
[39:27] to meet with Moses or when he wants to
[39:30] commune with Moses, he's telling him go
[39:32] to the mercy seat. And then if if if you
[39:35] just think about mercy seat,
[39:39] mercy seat, it is not talking about the
[39:42] the the the seat of judgment. It is
[39:45] talking about the mercy seat. It is
[39:47] talking about the the seat where there
[39:50] is grace where there is forgiveness.
[39:53] So that's why the importance when you
[39:56] when you have come to Christ don't stay
[39:58] in the in the in the atrium. Don't stay
[40:01] there outside just way as an expectator
[40:04] but you have to come closer and then
[40:06] there is the holy place. It's good to be
[40:08] in the holy place. It's good to have all
[40:10] the emotions that you can have. You're a
[40:12] human. You can experience all those
[40:14] emotions. When when you come to the holy
[40:16] of holiest, that's going to be even
[40:18] something greater because there is where
[40:21] you can find mercy and you can find
[40:23] forgiveness.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; That's way different than just staying
[40:28] outside because outside people will
[40:30] still be looking at your outer
[40:32] appearance. People will still be looking
[40:34] at AT HOW YOU ARE. PEOPLE WILL STILL BE
[40:37] LOOKING AT YOUR FLESH. PEOPLE WILL still
[40:40] be looking at your mistakes. And then
[40:42] people IS GOING TO JUDGE YOU BECAUSE
[40:43] YOU'RE YOU'RE you're outside.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; But what happens when you come inside?
[40:49] That's what when the prophet of God had
[40:51] that vision about the third pool, it
[40:53] said and and there there was like a big
[40:55] tent.
[40:57] You see, always God from something big
[41:00] to something very small to something
[41:03] very private. Why? Because he wants to
[41:06] have that personal relationship with
[41:09] you. He wants to commune with you. He
[41:11] wants to connect with you this morning.
[41:15] That's what he wants. So that's why when
[41:17] when when that vision of the third and
[41:20] our pastor preached like I don't
[41:21] remember how many how many services
[41:23] about it and it was just so great
[41:25] because when you're coming to the third
[41:26] pool is not a an open to the public. He
[41:30] it is something more private where it's
[41:32] just you and God where you can commune
[41:35] with him when you can talk to him when
[41:37] you can express how you feel and he's
[41:40] not going to judge you. He's going to
[41:41] bring healing to what to your need.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why to me this scripture
[41:48] is kind of like when he's saying like
[41:50] it's it's talking about the the mercy
[41:52] seat and it's like and I will have
[41:55] communion with you there Moses. I want
[41:57] to have that communion with you. And
[41:59] that's the same thing that was sold to
[42:01] the prophet of this age. It's like
[42:03] there's going to be a big tent and he
[42:05] thought, "Oh, that's great." Amen. He
[42:07] was even the prophet of God was planning
[42:09] on buying a big tent. He's like, "Then
[42:11] we're going to have this great revival
[42:13] and people is going to be healed."
[42:16] That was that was the vision of the
[42:18] third pole. But then something happened.
[42:20] He's like, "Then there was a little
[42:22] room. There was a little little little
[42:25] place where people were going through
[42:27] there on one side and they were coming
[42:29] to the other side and they were walking.
[42:31] They were walking with the stretchers or
[42:33] or or with the with with with the you
[42:34] know the the the hospital bed. They were
[42:36] going through there and then they were
[42:38] coming out healed
[42:40] &gt;&gt; and he's like something was happening in
[42:42] there
[42:44] &gt;&gt; and then the angel told him and this
[42:47] will be your thirdpool thirdpole and I
[42:50] will meet you there and I will meet you
[42:53] there. Why am I saying this? We're going
[42:56] to try to connect it with everything
[42:57] that we're talking about. Okay, but that
[43:00] was for the prophet. And then here it's
[43:03] like when you get discouraged be when
[43:05] you get betrayed or whatever your
[43:06] condition is when you enter into his
[43:09] word when you enter the holy of holiest
[43:12] you will find rest for your soul
[43:15] &gt;&gt; because how glorious that is that when
[43:18] you know when when when when the law was
[43:20] given through Moses they have to follow
[43:23] all those rules and regulations for the
[43:25] tabernacle on on all all the the the the
[43:27] the skiing skin and everything that they
[43:30] have to guilt. But at some point when
[43:33] Jesus died there there was there was a
[43:35] veil that was rented in two. And now you
[43:38] have full access to that mercy seat. Who
[43:41] was that mercy seat? It was Jesus. But
[43:44] it was not only for for us to always go
[43:47] back and REFER TO THE CROSS. BUT NOW
[43:49] it's to to taking him out of the his out
[43:52] of history and bring him him back to our
[43:55] to your daily life
[43:57] &gt;&gt; to your daily walk.
[44:00] Because every time you feel discouraged,
[44:02] every time you feel betrayed, now you
[44:05] can go to him and say, "Lord, I feel
[44:07] discouraged. Lord, I feel betrayed.
[44:10] Lord, they are talking about me. They
[44:11] are saying this about me." And then he's
[44:14] like, as when brother Brandham was
[44:15] talking, he's like, and and I went to
[44:17] the hospital and I went to the big
[44:19] university and I was like, Lord, I
[44:21] haven't done anything. And the and the
[44:23] and the voice just came and say, I am
[44:24] your portion.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; So that could be the same thing for you
[44:28] this morning. And you may think, Lord, I
[44:30] don't have like all these great
[44:31] possessions, which is nothing against
[44:33] it, or Lord, I I I haven't I haven't
[44:35] reached so many things. But my prayer
[44:38] for you this morning is that you can
[44:40] hear him saying, "But I am your
[44:42] portion."
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Because if I am your portion, you will
[44:46] lack nothing
[44:48] &gt;&gt; because you're going to be content. You
[44:50] You're going to be satisfied with what
[44:52] he had given to you.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] The invitation this morning
[44:59] in the book of Matthew chapter 28
[45:03] verse 28
[45:07] he says come unto me come he's he's
[45:11] giving you an invitation
[45:13] &gt;&gt; unto me he's providing you the place
[45:17] &gt;&gt; all ye that are labor labor and heavy
[45:20] laden in other words you have to
[45:22] recognize your condition
[45:25] &gt;&gt; because you cannot come to him in in in
[45:27] in not knowing your condition. But when
[45:30] you come to him and and when you come
[45:32] and and ask for a specifics, that makes
[45:34] a big difference because it's like even
[45:37] the prophet of God says when you pray to
[45:39] God, you have to be specific.
[45:42] Amen. Come unto me all ye that are labor
[45:45] and heavy laden and I will give you
[45:48] rest. That's a reward. So he's telling
[45:50] you come. He's giving you an invitation.
[45:52] He's telling you where to go. He's
[45:54] providing you the place. That's a
[45:56] provided place of God for worship. And
[45:58] then he's also telling you if you feel
[46:00] yourself in this condition, you can come
[46:02] to me,
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Lord. I'm tired this morning. I can come
[46:06] to you, Lord. I feel discouraged this
[46:08] morning. I can come to you this morning.
[46:11] And then he says, take my take take my
[46:13] yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am
[46:15] meek and lonely in heart. We preach
[46:18] about this at the beginning of the year.
[46:19] The heart of God. What? What's the heart
[46:22] of God? meek and lonely in in in heart.
[46:26] That's God's heart. It's not it's not
[46:27] it's not a h a heart that will always be
[46:30] you will always be in the place of
[46:31] judgment, but he will bring correction
[46:33] to your life.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; But he's like, I am meek and I am
[46:37] lonely. That's my heart. And then the
[46:41] again the reward and you shall find rest
[46:44] unto your souls because then it says
[46:47] because my yoke is easy and my burden is
[46:50] light.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Now, it it reminds me
[46:56] of that man. This is like a like a story
[46:58] of that man that that he was, you know,
[47:00] complaining to the Lord about the cross
[47:02] that he was carrying. And he's like,
[47:04] "Lord, this is so big." And the Lord
[47:06] brought him to the place where they have
[47:08] all the crosses.
[47:10] And he's like, "Okay." The Lord told
[47:12] him, "You go and choose whatever you
[47:14] want." And then and then he choose one.
[47:16] And the Lord was like, "Well, that's the
[47:18] one that you were carrying.
[47:22] That's what he's saying. Your his yoke
[47:24] is easy and the burden is light. Why?
[47:28] Because as we always say like he you
[47:30] will not be able to receive or like to
[47:32] carry more than what you can bear.
[47:34] That's his that's the scripture. Amen.
[47:37] Now there is another invitation in the
[47:39] book of Isaiah 55 and it says hold for
[47:43] everyone
[47:45] that is thirst that thirsteth. That's
[47:48] the condition of all condition of the
[47:50] world. Come ye to the waters and he that
[47:53] has no money. Come ye buy and eat. This
[47:56] is free. Yay. Come buy wine.
[48:01] Stimulation the stimulation of the
[48:03] revelation and milk without money and
[48:05] without price. In other words, he's
[48:08] providing a full he's giving you a full
[48:10] provision of who he is.
[48:13] He's all but you you you if you are
[48:16] seeing these two scriptures is giving
[48:18] you an invitation. It's not an
[48:20] imposition. This is not by impo
[48:23] imposition. This is by invitation only.
[48:28] If you're here is because you're
[48:29] willingly here in the house of God.
[48:32] Nobody told you you have to be here. No,
[48:34] you you were here because you wanted to
[48:35] be here. Amen. So it's always an
[48:38] invitation. It's it's always like the
[48:40] Lord coming to you and say, "Hey, just
[48:42] come and and let's have some
[48:43] fellowship." Amen. Amen. So now,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Even more, I was just thinking about it,
[48:51] but like I I really like this this quote
[48:54] from from the first sale where brother
[48:56] Venom says, "Every bornagain believer,
[48:59] true believer, is perfectly
[49:02] absolutely
[49:04] sinless before God.
[49:09] And you are like, "Who are you talking
[49:11] about, Lord?"
[49:14] &gt;&gt; He's talking about you.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God is telling you, he is
[49:20] you're a true believer. If you're a true
[49:22] believer, what is a believer? What's the
[49:25] the characteristic of a believer? They
[49:27] believe.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says the bornag again believer
[49:35] true born born again believer
[49:38] true believer is perfectly abs ab ab ab
[49:41] ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab
[49:41] ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab
[49:41] ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab
[49:41] abssolutely sinless before god and then
[49:44] he is not trusting in his works are if
[49:48] you trust in your work in your works
[49:51] you're going to be lost.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody was like there was a
[49:55] gathering of people and and they were
[49:57] they were talking about religion and
[49:59] they were talking about Buddhist and and
[50:01] uh and you know all the different
[50:02] religions and it's like what makes the
[50:05] Christian religion different than the
[50:07] other religions and the answer was
[50:10] because this this the Christian religion
[50:12] is not about works it's about grace.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense to you this
[50:21] morning? Because if it will be by your
[50:23] works, we will be all we will have
[50:26] fallen short of the glory of God. But
[50:28] it's just his grace that we're here this
[50:31] morning.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; So that's why he is not trusting in his
[50:35] works. If you're trusting in your own
[50:36] works, in in your in you in you in you
[50:39] coming to church, in you paying your
[50:41] tithing and your offerings or or kind of
[50:43] tending to the sick and the afflicted,
[50:45] that's great. But if you're trusting in
[50:47] that, you're lost. That's right.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; But in the blood of Jesus, that's what
[50:54] where you have to stand this morning. It
[50:57] is in THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. WHY? BECAUSE
[51:00] THAT IS your confession that has dropped
[51:02] into your heart. There is nothing else
[51:05] that can take you out of what God had
[51:07] done in your life that you can say,
[51:09] "Lord, is just by grace. It's just
[51:11] through your blood that I'm here this
[51:13] morning that you can see me before
[51:15] before my my my my mistakes and anything
[51:18] else. The only thing you see you see the
[51:20] blood
[51:22] &gt;&gt; and then Jesus said be there for perfect
[51:25] even as your father in heaven is
[51:27] perfect. If Jesus is giving that as a
[51:31] commandment of the Lord he's telling you
[51:33] you have to be perfect.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Did you did you have a bad thought this
[51:39] week?
[51:42] Did you lie this week? Maybe shouldn't
[51:45] do that.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Did you like have a thought in your in
[51:51] in in your in your mind about your
[51:53] husband, about your wife? Oh, once
[51:55] again,
[51:59] if you think about all your thinking and
[52:01] all of that,
[52:04] you will you will be falling short of
[52:06] the glory of God.
[52:09] And then but if he's telling us be ye
[52:12] therefore perfect even as your father in
[52:14] heaven is perfect. How could we even
[52:16] start the thought of being perfect?
[52:20] But Jesus require it. If and if it is a
[52:23] requirement we have to do it. But if
[52:26] Jesus require it, he has to he has a way
[52:29] to make he has to make a way for it.
[52:33] He has to make a way for it.
[52:36] And the prophet of God says, "And he has
[52:38] made a way
[52:40] and it is his own blood."
[52:43] &gt;&gt; So if he's telling you be he therefore
[52:45] perfect, he's telling you that you have
[52:47] to do it. But at the same time, he is a
[52:49] fair. He's a he's a fair. He's a just
[52:51] God that that he's telling you yes, you
[52:53] have to be perfect. But let me tell you
[52:55] something. I will provide you the tools.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; I and I will provide you even something
[52:59] more. I I have already shed my blood
[53:02] that you can be perfect.
[53:06] THAT YOU DON'T HAVE to walk defeated or
[53:09] you don't have to be always looking at
[53:11] what you did the last week or or your
[53:14] offenses from years ago. Now, if
[53:16] everything has been confessed is if
[53:19] everything is under the blood of the
[53:21] lamb then now you can say I can walk in
[53:25] power.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Don't don't we sing I'm walking in power
[53:28] in in in power. I'm I am working in
[53:31] miracles. I see you. I don't remember
[53:33] the song anyway, but just think about
[53:35] the song. Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; But we sing and we, oh, I'm working in
[53:40] power. I can I almost performing
[53:42] miracles and all. I see a life of favor
[53:44] and then I know who I am.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; But then you see your brother and you
[53:49] criticize your brother. You see your
[53:50] sister, you criticize your sister. Or
[53:53] you see yourself and you overjudge
[53:55] yourself.
[53:56] when it's like Lord if you have shed
[53:59] your blood for me let me walk with that
[54:02] vision let me walk with that mindset
[54:05] this morning that I that I can be
[54:07] perfect that I can be sinless before you
[54:10] this morning that it is not by my works
[54:13] as I said Christianity is the only one
[54:16] that is just by grace
[54:20] &gt;&gt; amen
[54:22] he's made a way
[54:25] Now, if you see here,
[54:29] we're page three, so we have good time.
[54:30] Oh, wow.
[54:37] Oh, let's let's focus a little bit on
[54:39] David.
[54:40] After Saul was rejected by God, the Lord
[54:44] had a plan all along to provide a king
[54:47] for Israel. We know that, right? because
[54:49] the the people's choosing or the
[54:51] people's choice was Saul, but God's
[54:54] God's elected person was David.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And we know by the scriptures how the
[55:00] prophet Saul Samuel led by the holy holy
[55:03] ghost. He's brought to the house of
[55:04] David where he was there in in in
[55:08] where where there was the one that the
[55:10] where the future king was and Samuel
[55:13] gets there. He gets there to worship.
[55:15] Tells Jesse what the plan is and u Jesse
[55:19] and ask him Jesse bring all your
[55:21] children to so we have to worship
[55:22] together because we are going to eat
[55:25] until everybody's here and we and we can
[55:27] we can partake of the meal and Jesse
[55:29] brings all the all all you know his best
[55:32] children. How many parents are these
[55:33] days that way?
[55:35] Let me bring you the one that behaves
[55:37] the most in church and the one that
[55:40] Well, that one is busy. Don't don't
[55:41] bring it. Don't bring him around.
[55:45] That's parenthood right here. Jesse like
[55:47] you know belittling the one child
[55:49] because then he has a star child and
[55:50] then he had one child that yeah, you
[55:52] know that's he needs help.
[55:58] That's the attitude of many parents.
[56:00] Amen.
[56:02] We all need help.
[56:04] I was one of them kids that there is one
[56:06] one author that said that there is the
[56:09] type of kids that the ones that are very
[56:10] outspoken and those are the ones that
[56:13] you're able to identify when they are
[56:14] struggling with something.
[56:17] But there is some other type of kids in
[56:19] your household
[56:21] that they are called the golden kids.
[56:25] Those are the type of kids that hide
[56:27] everything and inside of them they are
[56:30] struggling
[56:31] &gt;&gt; but they are not able to express how
[56:34] they feel because of the fear of what
[56:37] their parents are going to say about
[56:39] them and they hide all their struggles
[56:41] for years until that thing explodes.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; I was one of them. I was a golden child
[56:50] confessing my sins. Amen. But by God's
[56:54] grace, the Lord took me out of that
[56:55] bubble of golden child and he's like,
[56:57] just be who you are in Christ.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So anyway, so we have David and
[57:03] then we have the the the the children of
[57:06] uh the other children of Jesse
[57:09] and uh and they and you know Saul Samuel
[57:12] asks like uh are these all your sons?
[57:16] And Jesse replies, "No, I have one more.
[57:18] He's tending to the sheep of of his
[57:20] father." Samuel asked him, "Go and get
[57:22] him." As soon as David walks in, he
[57:26] tells Samuel that that David is the one
[57:28] that is supposed to be anointed over
[57:30] Israel.
[57:32] Then Samuel anoints David and worships
[57:35] the Lord in the house of Jesse. Amen.
[57:37] What a beautiful picture. We're seeing
[57:39] here a good for nothing uh like an
[57:43] anonymous guy now become the anointed
[57:47] for the kingdom. And remember, we're
[57:50] talking there is a king, there is a
[57:52] kingdom, and there is a purpose we're
[57:55] building. Okay?
[57:57] So, but before we go we get there, I I
[58:01] was listening the other day and uh
[58:03] brother Brham was talking about this
[58:06] specific instance and and and we are all
[58:09] familiar with this story, but maybe for
[58:11] the sake of the younger ones, uh we we
[58:13] can talk a little bit about it. And and
[58:15] we know that there was this uh this
[58:18] specific fellow that he will go to the
[58:21] meetings and then he will disrupt the
[58:23] services and then we'll be threatening
[58:25] the pastor or or the preacher and then
[58:28] they will be all be afraid and then uh
[58:32] that was the guy. Okay. But at at some
[58:36] point there was this specific instance
[58:39] where the guy came to the to the
[58:41] prophet's meetings and he was there in
[58:43] the meeting and then at some point he
[58:45] started screaming at the prophet and and
[58:47] then it started you know like cussing in
[58:49] in front of everybody and and then the
[58:52] police was there and and and all the
[58:54] ministers were all alarmed. What what
[58:56] should we do here? But then the prophet
[58:58] of God was just looking at him.
[59:01] Why?
[59:03] Because when we can say that someone in
[59:06] our generation
[59:09] got to the point of such love divine,
[59:15] it brings a kind of a different
[59:16] perspective on on where we could be this
[59:19] morning. Right?
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God, even though
[59:23] not seeing the threat in front of him,
[59:25] what he did was like the guy came in
[59:27] front of him, he spit on his face and
[59:30] then he was like, I'm going to break all
[59:32] your bones and I'm going to do all of
[59:35] these against you. But let me tell you
[59:37] one thing. The prophet of God, he looked
[59:41] at him and then he recognized, you know
[59:43] what? What what what had happened with
[59:46] that guy that what had happened was that
[59:49] he had I think he's one of the ones that
[59:51] had believed a lie and then one lie
[59:53] brought to another lie and it was the
[59:55] power of multiplication of that spirit
[59:58] that it ended up being that that that
[1:00:01] that brother was possessed
[1:00:04] and then but not only that when the
[1:00:06] prophet of God looked at him and he is
[1:00:08] like you know what yeah and he was just
[1:00:10] looking at him and at some point you No,
[1:00:13] he just love him and say in the name of
[1:00:15] Jesus that that the spirit had to leave
[1:00:18] and according to the the accounts the
[1:00:21] the spirit left.
[1:00:23] But then the police officer asks is this
[1:00:27] man going to be okay? And then here is
[1:00:32] where brother Ram says
[1:00:35] no sir. He's like is he going to be all
[1:00:38] right? And he's like no. Why? because he
[1:00:42] worships
[1:00:44] that spirit.
[1:00:46] He and and think about this. He think he
[1:00:50] is right.
[1:00:52] If he's willing to give it up,
[1:00:55] it will leave him right now.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; But he worships that spirit and he will
[1:01:02] take it right back.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; So that's a challenge for us this
[1:01:09] morning. When you think about your
[1:01:11] struggle, when you think about the
[1:01:13] things you're facing these days is like,
[1:01:16] are you worshiping
[1:01:18] those spirits? And and and and and a
[1:01:21] definition of worship is submission. Are
[1:01:24] you submitting to those spirits or are
[1:01:27] you saying Lord come and take control of
[1:01:29] my life?
[1:01:31] So that's and the reason why I'm saying
[1:01:33] this because it is the same condition
[1:01:36] where Saul was you know as soon as he
[1:01:40] disobeyed God then the spirit of the of
[1:01:43] the enemy just came and once in a while
[1:01:45] if you think about it once in a while
[1:01:47] will come and possess him and then they
[1:01:49] will have to bring a musician and then
[1:01:51] the musician will play the music and he
[1:01:53] will set free.
[1:01:55] But he was so possessed of that spirit
[1:01:59] that he wouldn't it would never let him.
[1:02:02] It will not leave him at all. And
[1:02:06] brother Brandon says that many times
[1:02:08] sickness people could be healed in the
[1:02:11] service and and then and you know now
[1:02:15] you have all these kind of internet
[1:02:16] going on that you know he will tell
[1:02:18] people that they were healed and then
[1:02:19] people didn't heal. Well, people healed
[1:02:21] but what happened is that in the
[1:02:24] presence of God there is nothing that
[1:02:26] cannot be delivered.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; But what will do though that people do
[1:02:32] after when they will go home, when they
[1:02:35] will go to the workplace, will they
[1:02:37] still be claiming back those things or
[1:02:40] will they still stand in their
[1:02:42] confession of deliverance and their
[1:02:44] confession of healing? So that makes a
[1:02:48] big difference because in God's presence
[1:02:50] there is nothing that can be hidden or
[1:02:52] there is nothing that can be delivered
[1:02:54] but is more on what you do after when
[1:02:57] you get out of this place.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in in the case of of Saul he
[1:03:03] was worshiping the spirit. He was bowing
[1:03:06] himself to that spirit of pride that
[1:03:08] spirit of rejection.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was bowing himself before those
[1:03:14] things. And at some point that thing
[1:03:17] killed him
[1:03:19] because that was the judgment of God.
[1:03:21] Amen. If you see now if we can keep
[1:03:25] moving forward here um they start
[1:03:27] looking for a musician and they bring
[1:03:29] David to the palace. Now remember
[1:03:32] David's David was anointed to be the
[1:03:34] king but it was not his time yet. Think
[1:03:38] about it. When they br they they bring
[1:03:40] the good for nothing. Now he's given a
[1:03:43] promise and he's thinking it's going to
[1:03:45] be tomorrow. Now I'm going to be I'm
[1:03:47] going to stop caring for the sheep of my
[1:03:49] father and now everybody's going to bow
[1:03:51] before me and it's going to be great.
[1:03:54] Guess what? It was not the case.
[1:03:59] Many times and David was was anointed to
[1:04:02] be the king but it was not his time yet.
[1:04:05] Because many times God can anoint you
[1:04:07] for something but it's not your time to
[1:04:09] come to manifestation on on the
[1:04:12] commission that the Lord wants for your
[1:04:14] life. You know many times we're
[1:04:16] commissioned but God's timing to use us
[1:04:19] for a specific task is not shown to us
[1:04:22] right away. You know as the prophet said
[1:04:25] sometimes God can use a man for five for
[1:04:27] a five minute commission but we need to
[1:04:30] be patient and wait on his timing. We
[1:04:34] need to embrace the process.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Don't despise
[1:04:48] don't don't don't despise where God has
[1:04:51] you right now, but serve your purpose.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; That's what brother said that. Don't
[1:04:57] don't don't despise it where God has you
[1:05:00] right now, but serve your purpose.
[1:05:02] Discern what the Lord wants to teach you
[1:05:06] at the time of our test.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's very important.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; This generation
[1:05:13] wants everything fast
[1:05:16] with the snap of their fingers. They
[1:05:18] want it to happen right away. But let me
[1:05:22] tell you, and when I'm talking about the
[1:05:24] generation, I'm including myself. they
[1:05:26] but we sometimes are missing the
[1:05:29] opportunities that the Lord has for us
[1:05:32] to learn.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; If I ask our sisters, our sister uh
[1:05:37] Emily or sister Sharon or like the ones
[1:05:40] that have been have had to deal with the
[1:05:42] sickness for a long time and if I will
[1:05:45] have to ask them what is it like? Well,
[1:05:49] I can say because my mom had cancer at
[1:05:51] some point, but I I can tell you one of
[1:05:53] the answers will be, you know what, the
[1:05:55] only thing I knew is that the Lord was
[1:05:58] there there all along
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; and that's more than enough.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; And that's kind of when you learn to
[1:06:06] trust more in the Lord, when you're
[1:06:09] going through a trial that that lasts
[1:06:11] for a long time and you're like, Lord,
[1:06:13] when is this going to end? And the Lord
[1:06:15] is like, just a little bit more time.
[1:06:19] Amen.
[1:06:22] We want miracles,
[1:06:24] but we don't want to go through the
[1:06:25] healing process.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; We want miracles, but we don't want to
[1:06:29] go through healing, which is a process.
[1:06:32] We want a body change. We want to be
[1:06:35] raptured.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; I want to be raptured. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:40] I hear that all the time. I have heard
[1:06:43] many people saying and and I agree that
[1:06:45] how many want to be raptured? And we can
[1:06:47] say amen. But every day is an
[1:06:50] opportunity to be changed.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Didn't it happen the that way with
[1:06:56] Enoch? He walked so close to God that he
[1:07:00] was not found.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; He walked with God. It was not just like
[1:07:04] a a one event is something. It was a
[1:07:07] process. And I can tell you today the
[1:07:10] rapture, the first coming of the Lord
[1:07:12] was a prophet. A a process. There were
[1:07:14] prophecies given. But then how did it
[1:07:17] started? With the coming of the angel.
[1:07:19] Do you guys remember that in the first
[1:07:21] coming the angel came to who? He came to
[1:07:23] Mary. That was the beginning of the
[1:07:25] coming the first coming of the Lord. And
[1:07:28] then the Mary had to be ready to receive
[1:07:31] the word. And she said, "Be it unto me
[1:07:34] according to thy will." And then the the
[1:07:36] spirit of God kind of shadowed her. And
[1:07:38] then she conceived of the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:41] And that was still the coming of the
[1:07:43] Lord. It it was a process and then it
[1:07:46] kept coming. It kept going until he 12
[1:07:49] 12 years old. Then then he was in the
[1:07:51] temple and he was confounding the the
[1:07:53] the minds and the thoughts of of the of
[1:07:56] the wise and the understood and that was
[1:07:58] great. It was still the first coming of
[1:08:00] the Lord and people were like where is
[1:08:03] the Messiah? The Messiah was already
[1:08:05] there but it was in in in in a in a
[1:08:08] teenager form
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and that was still the first coming of
[1:08:11] the Lord.
[1:08:13] And then it kept going until he he until
[1:08:15] John the Baptist had to say uh this is
[1:08:19] this is my beloved son.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That was John the Baptist the the the
[1:08:24] messenger to for to forun the coming of
[1:08:26] the Lord and it was all the first coming
[1:08:29] of the Lord. It was a process.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; What can we say in our day is the same
[1:08:35] thing. The coming of the Lord is a
[1:08:37] process. I don't know if if you guys
[1:08:39] heard or read this week, but people were
[1:08:41] waiting for the rapture to be on
[1:08:43] September 23rd, 24th. People were
[1:08:46] deceived.
[1:08:47] Why? Because now we know by the
[1:08:49] understanding of the scriptures that the
[1:08:52] coming of the Lord is a process. There
[1:08:54] is a people on earth that every day they
[1:08:58] are being changed because we we read we
[1:09:00] read that in the scriptures that he's
[1:09:02] changing us from glory to glory.
[1:09:06] And the in the second coming of the
[1:09:08] Lord, the angel had descended. There was
[1:09:10] a forerunner.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we believe that this morning?
[1:09:16] There was a forerunner and then who came
[1:09:18] after the forerunner. Now there is a
[1:09:20] bride on this earth that is receiving
[1:09:24] that word and she is in that rapturing
[1:09:27] process.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; We want to go and and and and we we we
[1:09:34] say this many times. So yes, Lord, we're
[1:09:36] going to go and we're going to be in
[1:09:38] that thousand years millennium and it's
[1:09:40] going to be great and then we're going
[1:09:41] to be stepping on the ashes of the evil
[1:09:43] and all of that. That's praise the Lord
[1:09:45] for that.
[1:09:47] We want to go and rule over the new
[1:09:49] heaven and in the new earth. But here we
[1:09:52] cannot rule our own body,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; our own tongue,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; our our temper
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; is still holding to the things from your
[1:10:01] past
[1:10:03] and you want to rule in a new world.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Control this 80 cents. Well, now with
[1:10:09] inflation and all of that, maybe five
[1:10:11] bucks.
[1:10:13] Amen. If you're able to control this
[1:10:16] now, then the Lord is going to place you
[1:10:18] over bigger things.
[1:10:20] But now the Lord is suffering you to let
[1:10:23] go and let God take control. Be your
[1:10:26] Lord. That is the second coming of
[1:10:29] Christ. The messenger, the message, but
[1:10:32] now the recipients of that message. The
[1:10:35] people that have to leave that message.
[1:10:38] And we always hear the term like the the
[1:10:40] opening of the book, the opening of the
[1:10:42] book, eating from the open book. Do you
[1:10:45] know what that means? Is the author is
[1:10:47] present there with you. That's the
[1:10:49] opening of the book. Because when you're
[1:10:51] reading from the revelation of the
[1:10:53] opening, the open book now, there is no
[1:10:56] room for you to to find a fault in the
[1:10:58] scripture because he's right there.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And that's how beautiful is the second
[1:11:06] coming of the Lord. It It's not just,
[1:11:08] you know, pe these people. And you see
[1:11:10] some of the images there in Africa. I
[1:11:12] think some of them were like waiting in
[1:11:14] a forest. They're waiting for for for
[1:11:16] the Lord to come and everybody gets so
[1:11:17] excited and everything and it's like how
[1:11:19] deceived people can be when there is a
[1:11:22] people that is being changed from glory
[1:11:27] to glory
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; until the the the the dawn of the day.
[1:11:31] That's what the scripture says. Amen.
[1:11:33] Now, if you see in the message uh
[1:11:36] victory day, God lets disappointments
[1:11:38] happen to show victory.
[1:11:42] Oh, if we could only see that, you'd
[1:11:44] only see that these things that seem to
[1:11:47] be burring burring you and upsetting
[1:11:49] you, they are trials. They are things to
[1:11:52] stand still and it's like kind of just
[1:11:55] to change to focus your focus your
[1:11:57] glasses on the word of God
[1:12:02] and speak the word and then just walk
[1:12:05] forward and that's all there is for you
[1:12:07] to do. You see what is the prophet of
[1:12:10] God telling us is like well things are
[1:12:12] going to happen in your life that's
[1:12:14] that's part of life but you you have an
[1:12:17] assure foundation you have the word of
[1:12:20] God that you can always always go back
[1:12:22] to that word and say Lord you are my
[1:12:25] refuge you are my sanctuary you are my
[1:12:27] everything this morning as we read here
[1:12:30] in Psalms 142 David is like who is
[1:12:33] taking care of my soul who is taking
[1:12:35] care of me and he's like kind of in all
[1:12:37] despair like Nobody is taking care of
[1:12:39] me. But then he's like, "No, but yes,
[1:12:40] you, Lord, you take care of me."
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; No, the next one, it is it is it isn't
[1:12:48] how you're going to get there. That is
[1:12:50] up to God.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Just keep on moving. Follow follow the
[1:12:56] word. If you stand stagnant, then you
[1:12:58] know the water stinks, right? Like the
[1:13:00] stagnant water will stink, but the water
[1:13:02] that is running is beautiful. That's
[1:13:04] what the Lord wants for your life. Don't
[1:13:06] still don't don't stand or stay
[1:13:08] stagnant. Keep moving.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Keep going forward.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; And then the other one I have here. Now
[1:13:17] remember, God has counted you worthy
[1:13:19] when you have a test. Oh, praise the
[1:13:22] Lord. Lord, I'm so worthy.
[1:13:27] Don't fail this to get this. When you
[1:13:29] have a trial or a test, it shows the
[1:13:32] grace that it shows the grace of God has
[1:13:36] found you.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; You found favor favor with God and God
[1:13:44] believes that you will stand the test.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Think about it this morning. your
[1:13:50] hardest trial, your hardest test that
[1:13:53] you have this past week or that you are
[1:13:55] going to face in the coming days, there
[1:13:58] is nothing that he hadn't already
[1:14:01] accomplished for you.
[1:14:03] But he believes in you.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And I do remember brother Steve Ste was
[1:14:08] when he was speaking about the kind of
[1:14:10] when you have a a son and it's like at
[1:14:13] some point that that son needs to be
[1:14:15] affirmed needs to be reaffirmed that you
[1:14:18] know that somebody believes in him in or
[1:14:20] or a or a wife affirming the husband and
[1:14:24] and this is God telling you I believe in
[1:14:26] you. I trust that you're that I had
[1:14:29] already provided all everything you
[1:14:31] need. So you're going to stand the test.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] And many times we he or we're hesitant
[1:14:42] and and well well that's something God
[1:14:46] give you to overcome. He knows you will
[1:14:48] do it. He because he has put his trust
[1:14:52] in you
[1:14:54] does what he wants for you. Remember
[1:14:56] there is a king there is a kingdom and
[1:14:59] there is a purpose. Yes.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; How many times we have made uh rush
[1:15:03] decisions and we get in a lot of
[1:15:05] trouble.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; But we have one thing for sure. God's
[1:15:13] purpose in our lives is and he'll always
[1:15:16] be will be fulfilled no matter what.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God says God's
[1:15:22] purpose can never be defeated because it
[1:15:26] is his purpose.
[1:15:28] It it is not your purpose. It is his
[1:15:30] purpose. And then he says what God has
[1:15:33] purposed in his mind, what God has
[1:15:36] purpose in in his heart to bring to
[1:15:38] pass. There is no demon. There is no
[1:15:40] power. There is nothing that can ever
[1:15:43] separate God's great eternal plan. It
[1:15:48] must be as God has said it. And we can
[1:15:51] say amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; It's God's purpose. It is it is God's
[1:15:56] plan. No, remember we're talking about a
[1:15:58] king. Now we're talking about a purpose.
[1:16:01] Now we we have to talk about a kingdom.
[1:16:02] Amen. Now,
[1:16:05] one more thing here. There's one uh you
[1:16:07] know the Bible always tells us
[1:16:11] God always chooses and calls men. It is
[1:16:15] not men choosing God or calling to God.
[1:16:17] Well, people can call to God, but is God
[1:16:20] kind of calling his his men? It is God
[1:16:24] calling men. You see how Gideon was
[1:16:26] called a mighty man of valor.
[1:16:29] How David was called a man after God's
[1:16:31] own heart and many others. Why is this?
[1:16:35] So that men don't get the glory.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; When God called you is for him to get
[1:16:40] the glory. He's not your is not for you
[1:16:41] to get the glory. But that God gets the
[1:16:44] glory. Look at every calling. There were
[1:16:47] always obstacles. There was always
[1:16:49] something coming against these men for
[1:16:52] so that they could avoid them to fulfill
[1:16:54] God's purpose. It always h it is a
[1:16:57] throughout the scriptures. So let me
[1:16:59] tell let me give you a key for this
[1:17:00] morning. If if it was in the scriptures
[1:17:02] is the same thing that can be applied in
[1:17:04] your life. Right?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; So that when you're planning or kind of
[1:17:07] uh getting ready to come to church and
[1:17:09] then everything is not going according
[1:17:11] to plan, that is the enemy trying to
[1:17:14] break his like to uh avoid God's purpose
[1:17:16] in your life for you to be in church.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[1:17:22] Amen. So we see when Moses was born,
[1:17:25] what happened with with Moses? There was
[1:17:26] a proclamation that they would have to
[1:17:28] kill the all the two year olds in and
[1:17:31] under all the men. They have to kill
[1:17:33] them. They had to, if you think about
[1:17:34] it, in that time they had to kill mascul
[1:17:37] masculinity because they they they knew
[1:17:40] that there was a deliverer coming.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Are we seeing the same thing?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; The enemy trying to destroy masculinity,
[1:17:48] fatherhood, motherhood,
[1:17:51] ch children, father relationship. Why?
[1:17:54] Because if if the if if if that is
[1:17:57] working the right way, it will do
[1:17:58] something against the enemy's king the
[1:18:00] enemy's kingdom. So that happened there.
[1:18:02] That's what I'm saying that everything
[1:18:04] that we are living these days, if you go
[1:18:07] back in the scriptures, you're going to
[1:18:08] find it.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And what happened with Gideon, God had a
[1:18:14] plan for him, but he was looking at the
[1:18:16] outer or or the current conditions,
[1:18:19] always being robbed from his harvest by
[1:18:22] the enemy. That was Gideon.
[1:18:25] Let me tell you something today. Your
[1:18:28] current condition is not your future.
[1:18:32] your current condition, where you are
[1:18:34] right now, that's not your future.
[1:18:35] That's not where God wants you wants you
[1:18:37] to be, but is you are a work in
[1:18:39] progress.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Perhaps Gideon thought that he was going
[1:18:43] to to to die trashing the wheat in the
[1:18:45] wine press. He was afraid certainly, but
[1:18:49] God needed to find him. Look, listen to
[1:18:52] this. God needed to find Gileian in that
[1:18:55] state
[1:18:57] to show himself as the God of the
[1:18:59] impossible.
[1:19:03] What's the condition? What's the state
[1:19:05] that you may find yourself this morning
[1:19:08] that he wants to show himself as the god
[1:19:11] of the impossible?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Do you have an impossible situation this
[1:19:15] morning that you have to to come to the
[1:19:17] end of the road that you that you think
[1:19:19] that there is no way out? Well, he is
[1:19:22] here.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He is here today. He's the same God
[1:19:26] yesterday, today, and forever. He's the
[1:19:28] same God. Amen. Now, let's go back to
[1:19:31] David and we have just a few more
[1:19:32] minutes. Okay? Do you love God?
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we see how David was running from
[1:19:38] the king.
[1:19:43] Cuz remember, we need to get to the
[1:19:45] cave, right?
[1:19:47] We went all this all this time to get to
[1:19:49] the cave.
[1:19:51] I wonder if if sometimes during the time
[1:19:54] that from being anoint an anointed to
[1:19:56] getting to the throne the thoughts or
[1:19:58] voices of doubt came to him.
[1:20:02] Aren't you the anointed one?
[1:20:05] Aren't you the king?
[1:20:08] Aren't you a Christian?
[1:20:11] Why are you still doing this? Why you
[1:20:13] still why are you still doing that? That
[1:20:16] may have been the voices that came to
[1:20:18] David to attack him and and to make him
[1:20:20] doubt of the God's of God's calling
[1:20:24] and he may have been you, you know, he
[1:20:26] may have been um um you know
[1:20:29] disappointed
[1:20:32] like Lord why do I have to go through
[1:20:35] all this trouble if you already have a
[1:20:36] king? But it but God was like but you
[1:20:39] are according to my heart. That's a a
[1:20:42] very different thing. I don't I I I as
[1:20:45] the Bible says like that kind of that he
[1:20:47] will not go with the with the proud in
[1:20:50] in in all of those like he wouldn't go
[1:20:52] with those. He will go with the meek
[1:20:54] with the humble
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; in spirit. Amen.
[1:20:59] My prayer today is that you can
[1:21:01] recognize that you have been saved,
[1:21:05] that you have received the Holy Ghost,
[1:21:08] and that if there is something or a plan
[1:21:10] for your life that you may not know
[1:21:13] today, and that obstacles may come,
[1:21:16] temptations may come, voices may may
[1:21:19] whisper to your ear that you will never
[1:21:21] make it. Look at what you did yesterday.
[1:21:25] that trials may come to try to
[1:21:27] discourage you, but rest assure
[1:21:30] he has already made all the provisions
[1:21:34] for you that the plan of God can be
[1:21:37] fulfilled.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Because that's what he did with David.
[1:21:40] The plan of God was already before the
[1:21:43] foundation of the world. It was the the
[1:21:46] plan was like there's going to be a king
[1:21:48] that the people is going to be the
[1:21:50] people's choice but then that's not my
[1:21:52] choice but then I'm going to let that
[1:21:54] king to go the route to go south and
[1:21:57] then I'm going to anoint an a king that
[1:22:00] is going to be after my heart
[1:22:02] and that was David was and we we study
[1:22:07] David and if we study the time when he
[1:22:10] was anointed as a king to the time when
[1:22:13] he became a king. It was 15 years.
[1:22:17] 15 years to transition from being
[1:22:20] anointed as king to reigning over all of
[1:22:23] Israel.
[1:22:26] He was around 15 years old. However, he
[1:22:29] then spent many years in the service of
[1:22:32] of King Saul, often fleeing for his
[1:22:35] life. Just think about it at your
[1:22:38] workplace of often being attacked.
[1:22:43] That was David. That was his job. What
[1:22:46] was his job? He had to play music when
[1:22:47] that that evil spirit was coming and
[1:22:49] possessing Saul. That was his job. They
[1:22:52] will bring him and he will play music
[1:22:54] for them.
[1:22:57] And the word and he was like, "But I
[1:22:58] have a word. I I have been anointed."
[1:23:00] But just think about it. 15 years
[1:23:04] and you're going with one day with one
[1:23:06] sickness and you're disappointed. You're
[1:23:08] like, "Okay, no. I'm throw throwing the
[1:23:10] towel.
[1:23:16] King Saul of offer fleeing for his life
[1:23:18] as Saul became jealous and fearful of
[1:23:20] David's growing popularity.
[1:23:24] And then after Saul's death, David was
[1:23:27] first anointed king over the tribe of
[1:23:30] Judah in heaven. It was not even the
[1:23:31] full kingdom.
[1:23:34] After 15 years, he became the king, the
[1:23:37] king of only one tribe.
[1:23:40] Just one tribe. How come Lord if if
[1:23:42] supposed to be 12?
[1:23:47] And then after that what happened after
[1:23:49] it says which took place in
[1:23:57] when he was 30 years old is when he
[1:23:59] became the the kingdom of Judah and
[1:24:01] seven years seven years later he was
[1:24:05] anointed king over all of Israel.
[1:24:08] So 22 years to become the full king.
[1:24:14] Now let's uh go here to the book of 1
[1:24:17] Samuel chapter 21.
[1:24:21] And um we're going to hurry here a
[1:24:23] little bit.
[1:24:25] And it says, "And the servants of Akish
[1:24:27] said unto him, is not this David the
[1:24:29] king of the land? Did they not sing one
[1:24:32] to another of him in dances, saying,
[1:24:34] "Saul had slain his thousands, and David
[1:24:37] his 10 thousands?" And David laid
[1:24:42] up this laid up these words in his
[1:24:44] heart, and was so afraid
[1:24:47] of Akish, the king of God.
[1:24:51] But I want you to notice something here.
[1:24:53] and he changed his behavior
[1:24:57] before them and feigned himself mad in
[1:25:00] their hands. In other words, he
[1:25:02] pretended to be insane
[1:25:05] and scrabbled
[1:25:07] on the doors of the gate and left his
[1:25:10] spittle fall down upon his be his beer.
[1:25:14] Then said Aish unto his servants,
[1:25:18] "Lo, ye see the man is mad." In other
[1:25:21] words, he's he's crazy. Wherefore then
[1:25:24] have ye brought him on brought him to
[1:25:26] me? Have I need of mad men? Have ye had
[1:25:30] brought this fellow to play the madman
[1:25:32] in my presence? Shall this fellow come
[1:25:34] into my house?
[1:25:37] What was happening with David?
[1:25:40] David was so desperate that he went back
[1:25:43] to the Philistines.
[1:25:46] Didn't he just kill or like he had just
[1:25:48] killed Goliath,
[1:25:50] part of the Philistines, and now he was
[1:25:52] going back with them.
[1:25:55] The same people that he had defeated, he
[1:25:58] went back to them. I just cannot think
[1:26:00] of all the persecution he had by the
[1:26:02] king. We could say the king's complexes
[1:26:05] were so many that he was obsessed with
[1:26:07] David's life that he tried and tried to
[1:26:10] find an occasion to kill him.
[1:26:13] But let me tell you sometimes we can go
[1:26:15] so low because of all the pressure
[1:26:17] within that within that we don't know
[1:26:20] what to do and find our consolations our
[1:26:23] consolation in the things that we had
[1:26:26] destroyed.
[1:26:28] Here was David that's what he was trying
[1:26:31] to find consolation with his enemies.
[1:26:38] If you read that in the book of uh
[1:26:40] Galatians chapter 2:18, it says, "For if
[1:26:43] I build again the things which I
[1:26:45] destroyed, I make myself a
[1:26:48] transgressor." Oh, but we can justify
[1:26:50] David because of all the persecution,
[1:26:52] all of that. Yes,
[1:26:55] perhaps we can do that, but it wasn't
[1:26:58] God's purpose. It wasn't God's plan.
[1:27:03] And as we just read here, you know, he
[1:27:04] started acting insane. And many times we
[1:27:08] do the same. We try to hide our identity
[1:27:12] as sons and daughters of God or be or
[1:27:15] because we try to blend in when the Lord
[1:27:18] has called us
[1:27:20] to be kings and priests. And still we're
[1:27:24] we're trying to blend in. Blend into
[1:27:27] what? To blend in the spirit of this
[1:27:30] age, an erotic age. Amen. So, I just
[1:27:33] want to I'm not going to read it here,
[1:27:35] but like if you study the Psalms, like
[1:27:39] every Psalm, if you think about Psalms
[1:27:41] 91, that was not written by David. Fun
[1:27:43] fact for the kids, it was written by
[1:27:45] Moses.
[1:27:47] And then when you go and read all other
[1:27:50] like other Psalms here, there is Psalms
[1:27:52] 34.
[1:27:55] The beginning of Psalms 34, it says, "I
[1:27:57] I will bless the Lord at all times. His
[1:28:00] praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[1:28:03] You know when was that?
[1:28:05] When he was with Akish.
[1:28:09] When he was acting insane, he was still
[1:28:12] writing, I will bless the Lord at all
[1:28:15] times.
[1:28:17] And then in verse 18, the Lord is night
[1:28:20] unto them that are of a broken heart and
[1:28:22] a and save such as be of a contrite
[1:28:25] spirit. Verse 19, many are the
[1:28:28] afflictions of the righteous, but the
[1:28:30] Lord delivered him out of them all.
[1:28:34] That was David writing
[1:28:36] when he was with Akish.
[1:28:40] But now in the message letting off the
[1:28:43] pressure
[1:28:45] all this together, brother says this
[1:28:47] tension building up then the results of
[1:28:50] it is doing something wrong and acting
[1:28:52] out of place.
[1:28:54] If you think about it, people may act
[1:28:58] and that's where we have to have grace
[1:29:00] for people. People may act out of place
[1:29:05] because of the pressure that they are
[1:29:07] under.
[1:29:09] That's what he's telling us here that
[1:29:11] the tension the tension is building up
[1:29:14] and then people start acting out of
[1:29:16] place. That's right. It will make it
[1:29:18] will make the poor and and not only the
[1:29:20] poor act that way, the middle class act
[1:29:23] that way. It will make the rich act that
[1:29:25] way. It will make the wrong act that
[1:29:29] way. It will make the pretty good act
[1:29:33] that pretty it will make the pretty good
[1:29:36] act that way and it will make the good
[1:29:38] act that way because it is tension
[1:29:42] steaming up.
[1:29:44] That's what we're seeing. David was
[1:29:48] acting the way he was acting because of
[1:29:51] all the pressure that he was under.
[1:29:54] So let me tell you something this
[1:29:56] morning. If you have some pressure this
[1:29:58] morning, it is okay to have pressure
[1:30:01] this morning. That's the good news this
[1:30:03] morning. Why? Because now you can have
[1:30:06] an example of someone in the scriptures
[1:30:09] that was acting as a madman, acting like
[1:30:12] a like as a a person like kind
[1:30:15] of the saliva was kind of falling from
[1:30:17] his mouth and and people were like this
[1:30:19] is the king. What is the king doing? Why
[1:30:22] is he acting that way?
[1:30:25] 15 years of persecution. Wouldn't that
[1:30:28] give him any right to act that way? I
[1:30:31] will say so.
[1:30:33] But still he was saying I will bless the
[1:30:36] Lord at all times.
[1:30:39] Now
[1:30:43] everybody it is just becoming a what a
[1:30:46] neurotic age.
[1:30:48] Everything is building up
[1:30:51] that builds up to a place that it breaks
[1:30:53] up things. It causes people to have hard
[1:30:56] feelings when they snap them off and say
[1:30:59] things you don't mean to say.
[1:31:03] because you are under a lot of pressure.
[1:31:06] Then your your child comes to you and
[1:31:07] then you mistreat your kid. It's not his
[1:31:09] fault, but you mistreat him. Why?
[1:31:10] Because all that pressure that you can
[1:31:12] be under.
[1:31:15] Now, Brother Brandon says, now
[1:31:16] everybody's guilty of it. I'm guilty.
[1:31:20] I'm guilty, too.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We don't We do things under pressure
[1:31:24] that we wouldn't do otherwise.
[1:31:27] There is an excess pressure built up
[1:31:30] today. I believe before I go any any any
[1:31:33] further I I say this. I believe it is
[1:31:36] the enemy coming down and pressing I
[1:31:39] believe it is the devil.
[1:31:42] Amen.
[1:31:44] Now it's a beautiful picture that we
[1:31:45] have here. So that was the picture of
[1:31:47] David under pressure.
[1:31:51] There was no way out. What do I have to
[1:31:54] do now? David,
[1:31:57] well he had to find a place where to go.
[1:32:05] First uh Samuel chapter 22 verse 1 and
[1:32:08] verse 2.
[1:32:11] David therefore departed tense and
[1:32:13] escaped to the cave Adel.
[1:32:15] And if you like to study the meanings of
[1:32:18] the scriptures, Adelm means refuge.
[1:32:24] So David went to a place of refuge
[1:32:29] and not only not only that when you
[1:32:31] study the word adlam it it is it is kind
[1:32:34] of two words at olam and that means
[1:32:36] eternity everlasting.
[1:32:39] Remember those were types and shadow
[1:32:42] shadows of something that that was
[1:32:44] coming
[1:32:45] right. So, and when his, listen to this,
[1:32:48] and when his brethren and all his
[1:32:51] father's house heard it, they went down
[1:32:54] fear to him. And not only his family
[1:32:57] went with him, but everyone that was in
[1:33:00] distress, and everyone that was in debt,
[1:33:02] and everyone that was discontented
[1:33:05] gathered themselves unto him, and he
[1:33:07] became a captain over them. And there
[1:33:09] were with him about 400 men.
[1:33:15] Now, as we as we kind of read at the
[1:33:17] beginning
[1:33:22] after he was pretending to be some
[1:33:24] someone that he wasn't, he went straight
[1:33:26] to the cave.
[1:33:28] And then every time that there is a cave
[1:33:30] in the scriptures, we got to pay
[1:33:32] attention to it. Who went to the cave in
[1:33:34] in in in in another occasion? Elijah. He
[1:33:37] was so depressed. He was so feeling
[1:33:41] persecution from Jezebel that he went to
[1:33:43] the cave. But in the cave is where he
[1:33:45] received the commission to go back and
[1:33:48] and and in in the cave is where he he he
[1:33:50] received food from heaven.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Everything was in the cave. Now we have
[1:33:55] David here in the cave. Something needs
[1:33:57] to happen in the cave. Why a cave and
[1:34:01] not another city? Well, a a cave. It was
[1:34:05] a place where he could hide and perhaps
[1:34:07] find rest from the king's persecution
[1:34:09] looking you know as we we talk about the
[1:34:11] meanings refuge that that that is what
[1:34:14] Adela means
[1:34:16] and we can say that he found himself in
[1:34:18] the cave and he found eternity in the
[1:34:21] cave right why he went to the right
[1:34:25] place he went to the to the like there
[1:34:28] was no other place where he could go but
[1:34:31] to the cave
[1:34:33] he went to the right place at the right
[1:34:35] time that the Lord had for him. Amen.
[1:34:38] Now
[1:34:40] it not only became a place where he
[1:34:42] could hide but also when people realized
[1:34:45] that he was there they joined him. Now
[1:34:48] if you read here who gather
[1:34:52] with him his family his brethren and all
[1:34:56] of his father's house
[1:35:00] for so many years fleeing from the king
[1:35:02] fleeing from his family. This was a
[1:35:04] place of reconciliation
[1:35:06] in that cave. There was a place for him
[1:35:09] to be able to reconcile with his father,
[1:35:12] with his brethren
[1:35:15] because now David was able to recognize
[1:35:19] uh excuse me, David's family now they
[1:35:21] could recognize this is the king of
[1:35:24] Israel because how will they see him
[1:35:27] before? as someone that was an outcast,
[1:35:30] as someone that was good for nothing.
[1:35:34] But now they were like, well, wait, wait
[1:35:35] a second. There is something different
[1:35:37] here. So now the Lord was bringing
[1:35:40] reconciliation
[1:35:42] for David and his family.
[1:35:46] We can say that when we find Jesus, that
[1:35:49] is a place of reconciliation.
[1:35:52] It could take a day or it can take years
[1:35:54] for it to happen. But if you are in the
[1:35:57] right place at the right time, in the
[1:35:59] right moment, it's going to happen. A
[1:36:02] place of reconciliation.
[1:36:05] His family needed to be reconciled. He
[1:36:07] was reconciled there with them.
[1:36:11] Who else was there? People in distress.
[1:36:15] And if you try to find a definition for
[1:36:18] people in distress is emotional, social,
[1:36:21] spiritual, or physical pain or suffering
[1:36:24] that may cause a person to feel sad,
[1:36:27] afraid,
[1:36:29] depressed, anxious, or lonely. That's
[1:36:33] the people that was with David.
[1:36:36] They were so tired of everything that
[1:36:37] was going on and they heard that David
[1:36:40] was there. So, they went to him.
[1:36:43] Not only the people in distress but the
[1:36:45] people in debt.
[1:36:48] What is debt is like when you owe
[1:36:49] something or to someone or an entity.
[1:36:52] How many were dead? We were debt. We
[1:36:56] were full of debt in our sins and our
[1:36:58] trespasses and he made a way for us to
[1:37:01] reconcile.
[1:37:05] Not only that, but people that were
[1:37:08] discontented,
[1:37:10] they are dissatisfied with one's
[1:37:12] circumstances.
[1:37:15] That was the type of people that came to
[1:37:17] David.
[1:37:18] But it was the people that the Lord
[1:37:21] needed, the Lord wanted to be there. It
[1:37:24] was not the best type of people to meet
[1:37:27] David. It was rough people. They all had
[1:37:30] the same purpose. They wanted to find
[1:37:33] refuge. They wanted to find healing.
[1:37:36] They wanted they wanted to find change.
[1:37:38] But let me tell you what happened here
[1:37:40] is that this was the foundation of
[1:37:43] David's future army.
[1:37:46] What about you? What about me? I can
[1:37:48] come to to to to the cave to meet Jesus
[1:37:52] because now he is my refuge. Now he is
[1:37:56] my king. Look now who is part of his
[1:37:59] army?
[1:38:01] the good for nothing, the rejected ones,
[1:38:05] the lonely, the dep the depressed, the
[1:38:09] distressed, the ones that were in debt
[1:38:12] because of their sins. But there was one
[1:38:15] in the cave that could turn on the
[1:38:18] light.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Are you in the cave this morning that
[1:38:23] you can say, "Lord, now you can turn the
[1:38:25] light. You can bring forgiveness. You
[1:38:27] can bring healing to my heart. You can
[1:38:29] bring reconciliation." Father for rel
[1:38:31] relationships that haven't been
[1:38:33] reconciled for years Lord now I can
[1:38:36] forgive and I can let go
[1:38:39] because one thing is forgiving and one
[1:38:41] thing is reconcil reconciling those are
[1:38:44] two separate things because people think
[1:38:45] that when you forgive now now you you
[1:38:47] have to kind of be in in in communion or
[1:38:50] talk with the other person that takes
[1:38:52] time
[1:38:54] forgiving and then people say forgiving
[1:38:56] and forgetting you have to forget let me
[1:38:58] tell you you're still a him and you will
[1:38:59] still remember.
[1:39:01] But when you remember the feelings of
[1:39:05] anger, the feelings of uh pain won't be
[1:39:10] there anymore
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; because now he's come and heal your
[1:39:15] heart
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and you will still remember because you
[1:39:18] remember for a testimony but that
[1:39:20] doesn't mean that when you remember that
[1:39:23] some somebody did you wrong and I can
[1:39:25] remember right now you know somebody did
[1:39:26] me wrong but when I think about that
[1:39:28] person I I just don't feel any any any
[1:39:31] anger against them, a any bitterness
[1:39:34] against them. Why? Because I have
[1:39:37] forgiven from my heart and then now I
[1:39:40] can talk to the people. I have I I I can
[1:39:42] talk to some of that people and that
[1:39:44] brings reconciliation. That's two
[1:39:46] different things. So just think about
[1:39:48] it. Who was making David a king?
[1:39:52] The brokenhearted.
[1:39:54] The worst of the worst were the
[1:39:57] foundation of David's kingdom.
[1:40:01] No other but him. He's our very present
[1:40:03] help in the time of trouble. He is the
[1:40:06] light. He is the king. He is the
[1:40:09] captain. I can say this morning, we have
[1:40:12] arrived because now I can go to the
[1:40:14] cave. I can go to that eternity. I can
[1:40:17] go to that place of refuge. And I know
[1:40:20] that when I go there, I'm going to be
[1:40:22] healed. When I go there, he's going to
[1:40:24] forgive my sins. When I go there, all my
[1:40:28] debt is going to be covered.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; They went into the cave hopeless,
[1:40:33] without direction. But they came out of
[1:40:36] the cave with a king,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; with a kingdom, and with a purpose.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Because now they knew who they had to
[1:40:43] fight for. Now they knew, you know, when
[1:40:45] David was thirsty, he's like, "Oh, who
[1:40:46] shall give me to drink from the well of
[1:40:48] Bethlehem?" Now there was people that
[1:40:50] was willing to die for their king.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; That was a purpose. There was a kingdom
[1:40:55] and that was them. The worst of the
[1:40:57] worst became a a people with a purpose
[1:41:00] and they became part of that kingdom.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; If you feel hopeless that you cannot go
[1:41:06] forward anymore here is here to meet
[1:41:09] your needs. What can you ask that he
[1:41:12] cannot provide?
[1:41:16] And we can also say that in the Old
[1:41:17] Testament that there was a place where
[1:41:19] they buried their loved ones like
[1:41:20] Abraham in the in the cave of Mbpella.
[1:41:24] But that David in other words David had
[1:41:26] to die to himself to his fears to his
[1:41:30] complexes and came out as a new man
[1:41:34] resurrected man. Came out as a king
[1:41:38] a king made made by whom? By the people
[1:41:42] that were with him. And that was to
[1:41:44] fulfill the word that was given by the
[1:41:46] prophet Samuel that there is going to be
[1:41:48] king. There is going to be a purpose.
[1:41:49] There's going to be a kingdom. Amen. But
[1:41:51] we can bring it now to our time when our
[1:41:54] Lord died was also put in a cave or in a
[1:41:56] tomb. Amen. He was also there. And who
[1:41:59] and who who were who who went there with
[1:42:02] him. The ones that were dead in their
[1:42:04] trespasses and their sins, they were
[1:42:06] there. But he came out as a king of
[1:42:09] kings and lord of lords. And now we came
[1:42:11] out with him. And he he he he g he cut
[1:42:15] cap captivity. He took captivity
[1:42:19] captive.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Your captivity. He took it captive for
[1:42:23] you this morning. Now we are now cre we
[1:42:27] are now new creatures in him.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; We have received eternal life.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; From time to time you need to revisit.
[1:42:35] You need to go back to Adelan to keep
[1:42:38] dying to yourself until there is nothing
[1:42:41] nothing left for us but just him this
[1:42:44] morning.
[1:42:46] And one more thing before we finish
[1:42:49] here. It is interesting to know that
[1:42:51] David was David and his men were in the
[1:42:54] cave for nine months.
[1:42:59] Why nine months? After nine long months,
[1:43:02] they became an army ready to fight for
[1:43:04] the cause of David. Is a need the time a
[1:43:08] woman needs to bring forth a child.
[1:43:12] That's why the Bible says that he that
[1:43:14] is in Christ is a new creature.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's why you go to the cave, you have
[1:43:21] to be born again.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; You have to receive salvation. You have
[1:43:25] to be born again. You have to be
[1:43:26] sanctified, justified, receive the Holy
[1:43:28] Ghost and be in a relationship with the
[1:43:30] person of Jesus Christ so that you can
[1:43:33] come out of that cave with a king, with
[1:43:36] a purpose, and with a kingdom.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning? May
[1:43:41] he help us this morning to keep pressing
[1:43:43] on and saying, "Lord, if I have to die
[1:43:45] to myself this morning, let me die. If
[1:43:48] if I have to bring all my distresses to
[1:43:50] you, you know, these type of people that
[1:43:52] were there, Lord, let I'm part of those
[1:43:56] But I know that there is a king, that
[1:43:58] there is a kingdom, and there is a
[1:44:00] purpose that has to be fulfilled. And if
[1:44:02] I am part of God's economy, I'm I'm
[1:44:04] going to make it.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Can we just say thank you? Can we just
[1:44:10] bow our heads and thank the Lord? If the
[1:44:11] musicians will come,
[1:44:23] he's a refuge.
[1:44:27] He is everything to us this morning. If
[1:44:30] I'm afraid,
[1:44:32] I can go to him. If I if I'm stressed, I
[1:44:37] can go to him.
[1:44:39] Cuz now when I'm in his presence,
[1:44:41] everything is gone.
[1:44:44] If you're in your heart there this
[1:44:46] morning,
[1:44:48] there is something that you want to
[1:44:49] bring before him. Would you raise your
[1:44:52] hand and say, "Lord, there's still
[1:44:54] things in my life that I need change.
[1:44:57] There's still things in my heart
[1:45:00] that I that I need you to work the same
[1:45:03] the same way you did it with those men.
[1:45:05] Lord, would you do it for me this
[1:45:08] morning? That I am part of that kingdom.
[1:45:11] That I am part part of of that that you
[1:45:13] are my king. That I have a purpose now
[1:45:16] to what to fight for this morning. Lord,
[1:45:19] would you raise your hand there? Will
[1:45:21] you bow your heart? And will you just
[1:45:23] say, "Lord,
[1:45:25] be my king.
[1:45:27] Provide direction to my life.
[1:45:30] Be my everything this morning, Father."
[1:45:33] Lord Jesus, as we r raise our hands and
[1:45:36] we bow our hearts, Father, we just thank
[1:45:38] you for the word this morning, Lord.
[1:45:40] Thank you for your children that have
[1:45:43] come this this morning, Father.
[1:45:46] Father, we're grateful that you're our
[1:45:48] refuge, that we can find
[1:45:52] help in the time of trouble. Father,
[1:45:55] we see how David's life was, Lord. 15
[1:45:58] years waiting for to receive a kingdom,
[1:46:01] Father. But now, we don't have to wait
[1:46:03] more for that time, Father. We have
[1:46:05] received a kingdom that cannot be
[1:46:07] shaken, Father. We have received a word
[1:46:09] that is a sure foundation in our lives,
[1:46:12] Father. We're grateful for that this
[1:46:14] morning. Lord, may you help the hearts
[1:46:17] this morning that have raised their
[1:46:18] hands, that have a desire in their
[1:46:21] heart, Father, to be more like you, to
[1:46:24] go into that cave and to be changed.
[1:46:26] Father, the same way you did it with
[1:46:28] David. You did it with Elijah, even with
[1:46:31] our Lord Jesus. Father, he was
[1:46:33] resurrected. Father, we want to
[1:46:35] experience that resurrection every day
[1:46:36] in our lives, Father. that change that
[1:46:40] is from glory to glory. Father, until
[1:46:42] we're taken out of this earth, Lord, we
[1:46:47] bless your name. We thank you, Jesus. In
[1:46:49] your name we pray. Amen.
[1:46:53] You are my refuge. Can we all stand? You
[1:46:56] are my refuge.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; You are my sanuary.
[1:47:06] When I feel afraid,
[1:47:11] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:47:15] refuge.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Do we raise our hands and say, "Lord,
[1:47:18] you are my refuge."
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And when the storm is raging
[1:47:25] underneath your wings,
[1:47:29] I rejoice and sing that you are my
[1:47:34] refuge.
[1:47:35] Yes, Lord. You are my refuge.
[1:47:42] You are my sanuary.
[1:47:47] When I feel afraid,
[1:47:52] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:47:56] refuge.
[1:48:00] And when the storm is raging
[1:48:06] underneath your wings,
[1:48:10] I rejoice and sing that you are my
[1:48:14] refuge.
[1:48:17] Oh,
[1:48:19] I have found a place
[1:48:23] I can call my own.
[1:48:28] here in your embrace
[1:48:32] where your mercy overflows.
[1:48:36] Oh, it's here that all my doubts and
[1:48:41] fears just melt away.
[1:48:45] Yes, Lord. I lay my burdens down and I
[1:48:50] look upon your face
[1:48:56] and you are my refuge.
[1:49:01] You are my sanuary
[1:49:05] Lord when I feel afraid.
[1:49:11] You're my hiding place. You are my
[1:49:15] refuge.
[1:49:19] And when the storm is raging
[1:49:25] underneath your wings,
[1:49:29] I rejoice and see that you are my
[1:49:33] refuge.
[1:49:37] M I have found a place
[1:49:42] I can call my own. Yes, Lord. Oh, here
[1:49:47] in your embrace
[1:49:50] where your mercy overflows.
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] Oh,
[1:49:56] it's here that all my doubts and fears
[1:50:01] just melt away. Just let go now. Oh, I
[1:50:06] lay all my burdens down and I look upon
[1:50:10] your face
[1:50:14] that you are my refuge.
[1:50:18] Oh yes, you are my sanuary.
