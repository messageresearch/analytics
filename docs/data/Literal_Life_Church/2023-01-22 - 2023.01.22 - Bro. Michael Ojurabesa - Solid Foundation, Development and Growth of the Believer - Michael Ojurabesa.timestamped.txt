[0:00] hey man you made me sit there for a
[0:01] little while
[0:06] I'm so um
[0:09] excited to be here
[0:11] and also nervous because you know it's
[0:14] not a place to play amen
[0:16] I'm coming behind this place you have to
[0:18] be careful come with the right spirit
[0:20] you know to talk to the people because
[0:22] it's our God's people
[0:24] and you know God don't play you got to
[0:25] play with the people don't go yet I have
[0:27] something to say
[0:30] so good include his people God is very
[0:32] jealous of his people and God improved
[0:34] his servants too amen and on both sides
[0:38] we've got to be careful I would take it
[0:39] we react to each other and the words we
[0:41] say to our to each other is powerful
[0:44] if you remember Moses and the children
[0:45] of Israel remember Moses at the poem was
[0:47] mad
[0:48] I filled with rat and it's a smooth Rock
[0:51] and God said because she did that to my
[0:53] children even though it was God's child
[0:54] God said you make it the other side
[0:57] and that's another point where the
[0:59] children were you know mad against Moses
[1:02] too and God told him
[1:04] you know
[1:05] a new generation so it's just shows
[1:09] clearly how God don't play with other
[1:10] servants
[1:12] children so we have to be careful you
[1:14] know what we say to them and we have
[1:16] hurt them the kind of thoughts we have
[1:17] toward them because God will not spare
[1:19] us being children of ease and Spirits
[1:21] either amen but it's just a pleasure to
[1:24] be here this month before
[1:25] I um go here this morning I have this
[1:28] song
[1:29] if Sister Gina can bring it up you're my
[1:31] refuge

[1:52] you know about that song and I can
[1:54] remember all the words so he didn't send
[1:56] me the words that's a few couple weeks
[1:58] ago and then the words really minister
[2:01] to mind so I hope it blesses this

[6:50] 7 verse 24.
[6:58] said therefore whosoever hear these
[7:02] words this sayings of mine and doeth
[7:04] them
[7:05] I would liken him unto a wise man
[7:09] which built his house upon a rock
[7:12] and the rain descended and the flaws
[7:14] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[7:16] that house and
[7:18] it fell not before it was fun and upon a
[7:21] rock
[7:22] and everyone that here these scenes of
[7:24] mine and do it them not shall be liking
[7:27] unto a foolish man
[7:29] which built this house upon the sand
[7:32] and never understand it
[7:34] and the floors came and the winds blew
[7:37] and beat upon the house and it fell
[7:40] and listen to this great was the fall of
[7:43] it
[7:45] verse 28 and it came to pass when Jesus
[7:47] had ended this Saints the people were
[7:50] astonished at his Doctrine
[7:54] hey man you may be said it everybody
[7:56] psalm 11.
[8:03] psalm 11.
[8:05] because Psalms 11.
[8:17] verse 3.
[8:18] I need three thousands to say the
[8:20] foundations to be destroyed
[8:23] what can the righteous do I read it
[8:26] again if the foundations
[8:28] be destroyed
[8:30] what can the righteous do may the Lord
[8:33] bless everyone of his word this morning
[8:34] in the name of Jesus Christ
[8:37] uh this morning
[8:39] um I wanted to help me first this
[8:41] morning amen don't be quiet on me um
[8:45] every minute to ask the gift of God but
[8:46] if you don't pull that gift it will not
[8:48] bless you
[8:49] amen they have what it takes to feed the
[8:52] people of God but it's now the people
[8:55] that preach because they pulled a gift
[8:58] and it naturally comes out of that
[9:00] Minister and reaches out to you safe
[9:03] don't pull I can't do nothing I'm just
[9:05] going to be talking and talking

[9:33] daughter
[9:34] yeah yesterday was her birthday
[9:37] um brother Jared is telling me back in
[9:39] the back he said it's so funny that you
[9:42] know the ones that have the birth in
[9:43] general are the ones that have a very
[9:45] small birthday you don't really can't do
[9:47] it so much
[9:48] because all the money is gone
[9:51] are the gifts about in December you know
[9:54] at that Phoebe's birthday was a little
[9:55] bit a little bit you know jolly and then
[9:58] I just I was like Daddy can I have a big
[10:00] birthday girl we cannot
[10:02] and she will never understand I said
[10:04] we'll do something later but right now
[10:06] we cannot
[10:07] so we just did a little thin living room
[10:08] but I really wish yeah
[10:12] all right God bless you girl that's my
[10:14] that's my my firstborn the beginning of
[10:17] my strength
[10:18] amen I think for our life and we'll get
[10:20] us done in our life and sometimes she
[10:22] encourages me my daughter a little child
[10:24] she don't understand but she hears in
[10:26] the church and she just tells me what
[10:27] she hears
[10:28] and I really really appreciate that I'm
[10:30] thankful for my wife also and Phoebe too
[10:33] you know for being there for me
[10:35] supporting me and all I do I won't be
[10:37] here or I won't be women I am right now
[10:39] if this that that accrue right that
[10:42] didn't support me so I really appreciate
[10:44] them and every man
[10:46] every woman that has a family the reason
[10:49] why you're where you are right now
[10:50] because your spouse and your children
[10:51] supports you
[10:52] and they give you strength if everybody
[10:54] leave you they'll come there with you
[10:56] and they will you know even when you're
[10:57] in your low even when you you have your
[10:59] mistakes they're there for you because
[11:01] then they they believe in you no matter
[11:03] where you are where you become amen so
[11:05] that's why we don't it's very important
[11:07] to hold on to your family I believe in
[11:09] family so much amen I'm about to the
[11:12] scriptures this morning I want to take
[11:13] our time it's 11
[11:16] trying to make sure I sell my time
[11:18] so I don't preacher like I'm pretty in
[11:20] Africa
[11:21] 11 39 okay all right
[11:24] in Africa last time my wife would tell
[11:25] me the last time I went to Africa it was
[11:27] really
[11:28] so uh fun and then the people who put on
[11:31] the preacher that was preaching and they
[11:33] preached for three hours and they didn't
[11:34] stand up they didn't go nowhere they
[11:36] were just I don't know how to do it but
[11:38] so you know they they really pull on the
[11:40] gift if you go to Africa Africa as a
[11:42] Preacher Man be ready to preach
[11:44] amen so but here in America we're very
[11:48] time conscious and I believe in that
[11:50] because you know basically you want to
[11:52] get attention to people they might start
[11:54] preaching and then they're tired and
[11:56] they want to go then nothing is going
[11:58] anymore so if it's 30 minutes slowly 30
[12:00] minutes I never listen and they take
[12:02] that home that's enough for me hey man
[12:04] so Roberta Brown to keep me
[12:06] just let me know if I'm going
[12:09] behind up behind our schedule all right
[12:12] Matthew 7 24
[12:15] and it says uh if we want to go through
[12:17] that again instead
[12:19] where therefore whatsoever hear these
[12:22] things of mine do it then I would liken
[12:24] them unto a wise man not the word wise
[12:27] which built his house no the word house
[12:30] upon Iraq not the word Rock Amen
[12:34] and the rain descended and the flaws
[12:37] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[12:40] their house and it fell not for it to
[12:42] responded upon a rock not the world
[12:44] found it no the word Rock
[12:47] verse 26 and every and every other and
[12:49] every other one that hear the same the
[12:51] same words I say unto you and do not do
[12:53] them
[12:54] like unto the foolishment so this
[12:56] comparison of two people two different
[12:58] set of men here people the one that
[13:01] heard God's word and did it and the one
[13:04] that heard it and not
[13:06] liking unto a foolish man
[13:09] it's built his house upon the sand
[13:12] and the rain descended and the Lords
[13:14] came
[13:15] note the rain note the floods know the
[13:17] winds and the winds blew and beat up on
[13:20] that house and they fell and grit was
[13:22] the fall of it
[13:24] amen and you know
[13:26] these words Wise House work a very
[13:28] important words to me verse 25 and seven
[13:30] rain floods and wind I'm gonna get to
[13:32] them in a minute and they said the
[13:34] greatest fall of that that house that
[13:36] was built on the sound but note in verse
[13:38] 28 the Santa came to pass when Jesus had
[13:40] entered this saying the people were
[13:42] surprised at his Doctrine surprised that
[13:45] he's teaching like this is different
[13:46] excuse me this is different this is not
[13:49] the same thing we hear from Pharisees
[13:50] because the Pharisees and those they
[13:52] were always preaching Holiness for them
[13:54] and the fake Holiness where you fast and
[13:57] everyone knows you're fasting like the
[13:58] Muslims when they're fasting you can
[14:00] tell they say oh this fast is getting a
[14:02] hold of me and that was kind of teaching
[14:05] that they were used to the teaching that
[14:07] condemns and
[14:09] very legalistic and just condemns the
[14:11] people and make themselves good people
[14:13] and the other people the people bad
[14:15] people and even when they had their own
[14:17] faults that they were sinners in the
[14:18] secret that's kind of teaching that they
[14:19] had but this teaching was hard for them
[14:21] so they were they were you know
[14:23] very confident at his Doctrine and
[14:26] basically that was the foundation of
[14:27] their own belief
[14:29] amen it's very important if Financial
[14:31] demand is very important so this morning
[14:33] I'm going to speak on this on solid
[14:36] foundation development and growth of a
[14:40] believer
[14:41] solid foundation development and growth
[14:43] of a Believer if you notice here
[14:47] there are two foundations in the
[14:48] scriptures
[14:50] and both of them had a bit into a house
[14:52] so on top of this foundations was a
[14:55] house built amen I was trying to
[14:58] understand what the word about
[14:59] foundation and so I went to my favorite
[15:02] dictionary about the premises a lot and
[15:04] I founded that
[15:06] I feel like some of the the editors were
[15:09] Christians and so if we go in there it
[15:12] kind of TAPS scriptures with the meaning
[15:14] of words in English and that's the the
[15:17] Webster dictionary 1828 I love using it
[15:20] because I you know the the the mean is
[15:22] very different from all the modern
[15:23] meaning today so and it also goes back
[15:26] to the Ruth I like going to the rules of
[15:27] War so I found the word foundation
[15:30] in there and he said against somebody
[15:32] the root word foundation in Latin which
[15:36] means to lay bottom it means the base of
[15:39] an edifice edifice is a beautiful
[15:40] structure
[15:42] amen that part of the building which
[15:45] lies on the ground the supports
[15:49] a supported usually a wall of stone
[15:51] which supports the edifice the
[15:52] Cornerstone
[15:53] says also the groundwork on which
[15:55] anything stands and by which it is
[15:59] supported
[16:00] I like that I like this ottoman they say
[16:02] it's also called also called a
[16:04] settlement
[16:06] a settled base
[16:08] I like that
[16:10] it's also said it's also referred to as
[16:13] an establishment sometimes established
[16:15] set
[16:17] place
[16:18] fashion
[16:20] fashion according to certain standards
[16:22] so you can't just make any foundation
[16:24] Foundation has to be to certain standard
[16:26] standards of the engineer as a certain
[16:28] standard if it's uh like in geology at
[16:31] the geology college so I know a little
[16:32] bit in geology the certain places can
[16:34] put certain things certain materials
[16:36] because of the weight
[16:38] um of the way though the mass of the the
[16:40] soil structure you know or the area of
[16:43] the terrain if the basement complex
[16:45] where it's Rocky or where sedimentary
[16:47] rain we have just Sands you have to be
[16:49] careful the engineer determines what
[16:51] kind of structure is there so there's a
[16:52] certain standard that which by which
[16:54] would be the foundation
[16:56] another interesting part about
[16:57] Foundation is that it has to be paid for
[17:00] somebody has to pay for it now and I
[17:03] mean pay for it or something like in
[17:04] cash that's an effort
[17:07] that has to be made towards it and I
[17:10] call that effort sacrifice so someone
[17:12] has to work day and night making
[17:15] measurements measure you know think
[17:17] about how much material is needed to get
[17:19] that Foundation done so note that word
[17:21] sacrifice and that's that's really deep
[17:23] to me that Foundation cannot be made
[17:24] without an effort
[17:26] amen Foundation signifies preparation
[17:30] Foundation means I'm ready to build
[17:34] Foundation shows that I'm ready to
[17:36] progress to the next stage
[17:38] amen and you know foundational associate
[17:40] very funny thing in
[17:42] um
[17:43] in an engineering geology and also in
[17:45] for those who are Engineers but they're
[17:47] Josiah is here and other Engineers they
[17:50] know what I'm talking about the
[17:51] foundation of structure is the base
[17:52] level of the building and it serves two
[17:55] functions one to keep keep moisture
[17:59] and groundwater or seepage out of the
[18:01] structure
[18:03] that means to keep anything that's not
[18:04] supposed to be there to even distribute
[18:07] the weight among the load-bearing walls
[18:10] Amen to keep the balance
[18:12] amen
[18:15] I like that
[18:16] you know the word foundation is very
[18:18] very um common word
[18:21] in every part of our lives
[18:23] in our careers at the world Foundation
[18:26] you um
[18:28] want to do a career you have to you know
[18:30] do certain things
[18:31] you have to you know go to uh
[18:34] kindergarten or if you have to pre-k it
[18:36] depends on how you start and after that
[18:39] you could you finish uh Pre-K then you
[18:41] go to
[18:42] elementary school after elementary
[18:43] school you go to middle school middle
[18:46] school to
[18:48] High School in the British that's an
[18:49] American
[18:50] um uh American setup but in the British
[18:54] setup it's different
[18:55] because it's from from
[18:58] um Nursery which is the cricket to
[19:00] primary the primary is from grade one to
[19:03] six and that's what I did I'm from grade
[19:06] seven to ten you know seven to nine is
[19:09] this junior secondary school which is
[19:11] like our middle school and then from 10
[19:13] to 12 is the uh what do you call it the
[19:16] uh uh senior secondary school and with
[19:18] that happening what you're planning for
[19:20] are you planning to go further now
[19:22] in America you have to do your you pass
[19:25] your diploma pass exams and whatever you
[19:28] do and then uh interpret to people to
[19:30] have a diploma in the British system you
[19:32] have to have your senior secondary
[19:34] certificate which is an example you pass
[19:36] it state of national exam that you have
[19:39] to pass and those those
[19:42] um certificates on both sides American
[19:44] and British have on purpose the purpose
[19:46] is you're building a foundation to where
[19:48] you're attitude when I was in um I think
[19:51] ninth grade I had to do an exam if I was
[19:54] going to science or heart class or a
[19:56] commercial class and if you have good
[19:58] grades in physics chemistry biology
[20:00] then you English and maths and you go to
[20:03] science if you don't really have good
[20:04] grades in them I have good grades in
[20:05] literature and some other history and
[20:07] all that I send it to heart glass and if
[20:10] you can't pass accountant and some other
[20:12] courses into you know commercial class
[20:13] so it's a basis the foundation that
[20:15] everybody you know you're building to
[20:17] get your career now After High School
[20:19] some people decided to go to college and
[20:21] have an associate degree or have a
[20:23] bachelor's degree some decided no I want
[20:25] to go to it you know get a skill it's a
[20:27] skill set and go to trade school so both
[20:30] of both of those said the people who
[20:32] have a foundation to get somewhere so in
[20:35] life generally cannot do almost anything
[20:38] without having a base is a foundation
[20:39] and even before you get to the college
[20:42] or even on having a trade school there
[20:45] are prerequisite that it has for if you
[20:47] don't have them you have to do them
[20:49] again in college and pass I remember you
[20:51] know I had to I did some courses in
[20:53] college I didn't I didn't do in my
[20:55] secondary school and I had to pass them
[20:57] for me to progress and that's just the
[20:59] life for you there's Financial and
[21:01] relationships
[21:02] especially marriage
[21:05] to be married you know there's a whole
[21:06] lot that comes to you know being married
[21:08] there's a spiritual preparation as
[21:11] Believers now I'm talking as Believers
[21:12] right now because I'm out in the world
[21:14] they have their own set of rules which
[21:16] we don't agree with and we're kind of
[21:18] mix with them because the Bible said do
[21:20] not become do not be conformed to the
[21:22] world but we're transformed by the
[21:23] renewable mind so we can't look at
[21:25] things the way the world look at it
[21:27] because we are believers and we have a
[21:29] basis a foundation and we have a goal
[21:32] that we look forward to amen so
[21:35] as a Believer this Foundation of you
[21:37] trying to have a spiritual be rich and
[21:39] first you have to be saved
[21:41] because if a man is not saved and he
[21:43] goes get married this problem
[21:45] if a man is saved then the lady is not
[21:48] saved this problem so if you're a young
[21:50] lady a young brother looking forward to
[21:52] get married or have a spouse and future
[21:54] or have a family make sure you get old
[21:56] ghost first that's that's Paramount
[21:59] because the Holy Ghost is going to
[22:00] suppress every adamic nature and that
[22:02] man or that woman if you marry a man
[22:04] that's not saved and those in the church
[22:06] and you're not sure he has all the girls
[22:08] then you're in trouble
[22:10] is going to be pretending the church he
[22:11] can do everything in church but you're
[22:13] going to be his last victim at home
[22:15] nobody will see what it's doing but it's
[22:17] going to do it to you and you'll suffer
[22:18] so when the pastor is trying to talk to
[22:20] you and say don't marry this boy or
[22:22] don't mind this girl because I don't see
[22:24] any fruit of it listen to the pastor
[22:27] because when you stop facing the problem
[22:28] it's you it won't be there it's just you
[22:30] and her there's a case in Nigeria one
[22:32] time it's not a message case but like
[22:35] you know this Christians are believers
[22:36] out there and then this man has been in
[22:39] church and he was one of the active you
[22:41] know
[22:42] man in church was doing good doing very
[22:44] wonderful and he was not playing
[22:46] instrumental doing everything and
[22:49] he found his sister sister also was five
[22:51] and she was honest she was very you know
[22:53] a good Christian and then she liked the
[22:55] brother the Brother Talks really liked
[22:56] her and then he got married and then my
[22:59] if you see my dad asking that story he
[23:00] would tell you that same story so
[23:02] basically
[23:04] they got married and after they got
[23:06] married I think the 9th of the night the
[23:08] end of the night and then you know she
[23:09] was just say honey let's pray you know
[23:11] like a Believer let's pray thank you for
[23:13] the day and everything I said I ain't
[23:14] praying what are you talking about
[23:15] say you're not gonna pray I don't know I
[23:18] know you believe in whatever no God and
[23:20] they said I'm not going to pray and on
[23:21] there is uh the bed he pulled pulled a
[23:23] pack out
[23:25] it's back up beers
[23:27] why you cut butterlight here in America
[23:28] you know and put it on I said hey you
[23:30] get one I get one if they want it that's
[23:32] fine
[23:33] so what it did was it tricked that woman
[23:34] to it she did not even determine to know
[23:37] that this man was not saved because you
[23:39] can't you can't check your man by face
[23:40] value
[23:41] you can take a Woman by face value they
[23:44] can look beautiful and these look
[23:45] handsome it goes more than that marriage
[23:47] you know ghostman and that if you're
[23:49] really gonna lay that foundation for
[23:50] marriage it goes more than just the face
[23:52] value you have to be able to discern by
[23:54] the spirit of God I'll tell you
[23:56] something if God gives the Holy Spirit
[23:58] it gives the ability to be able to
[23:59] discern everybody
[24:01] sometimes I meet people I don't
[24:03] understand why certain things just it's
[24:05] not clear to me and I tell my wife I was
[24:07] like don't judge people you know we just
[24:08] made them I'm like I feel this way this
[24:10] way about it I don't know them and later
[24:13] I'm gonna find out that what I was
[24:16] thinking was exactly what happened
[24:17] sometimes I tried to like oh that's my
[24:19] first impression I'm just I don't live
[24:21] on the side but I suffer for it when I
[24:23] start getting relationship with that
[24:24] person over time so every child of God
[24:26] that has that goes as the ability to
[24:28] discern
[24:29] anybody come around you amen
[24:32] there's the emotional emotional um
[24:34] maturity before you get married
[24:37] you don't want to be a dad in the house
[24:39] and be quiet baby
[24:41] and why something happened you're the
[24:43] one crying
[24:44] or there's a spider in the house it went
[24:46] jumping on the bed jumping on the chair
[24:48] and your wife is going chasing the
[24:50] spider
[24:51] you want to make sure that you're a man
[24:53] in the house
[24:55] because you know well I'm Excuse me but
[24:57] in Americans where I see men jumping
[24:59] with spiders
[25:02] or or lizard or whatever that runs
[25:05] around but if you want to be a room in
[25:07] the house you can't be jumping on your
[25:09] wife jumping at the same time it's just
[25:11] the emotional part of being a man
[25:13] amen not the kind of man today were
[25:15] sissified I'm talking about every man
[25:17] now
[25:18] excuse me
[25:21] I said man you have to be a financial
[25:22] stable to take care of a family
[25:24] don't marry a man who doesn't have a job
[25:30] you said brother Mike when you move to
[25:31] America you don't have a job I ain't got
[25:32] married I had a job in Nigeria before I
[25:35] moved here I was searching for a job
[25:36] where I plan the wedding
[25:38] after I got married a few months I got a
[25:40] job so I was working
[25:43] to get a job
[25:45] I know I'm just I'm just being honest
[25:47] here
[25:48] so but I did not married that woman I
[25:51] would aim that you know what I just lazy
[25:54] around she can make all the money I've
[25:55] heard people say it in my job but you
[25:56] know what I just work my wife makes all
[25:58] the money she makes six figures I just
[26:00] need to make a little bit that's not
[26:02] what a man should be
[26:03] a man should be the one that killed the
[26:05] woman and she decided to work around and
[26:07] make us extra money it's fine that money
[26:09] says hers the money that you make as
[26:11] demand is for the family
[26:13] amen so you got to prepare for your
[26:15] financial stability you know how to
[26:17] manage bills how to you know not just
[26:19] blow up your credit card how to make
[26:22] sure that you must cater for address is
[26:25] cater for sisters
[26:29] foreign
[26:35] marriage but at least have something to
[26:38] take care of her even if you have a one
[26:39] bedroom house it's fine as long as she
[26:42] believes in you if you slowly walk
[26:45] together you build up to a position I
[26:47] didn't start here today I started from
[26:49] somewhere Ground Zero amen
[26:52] you have to psychologically prepared
[26:56] you know there's so many things that
[26:58] comes in marriage you know that you have
[26:59] to be you know psychology prepared about
[27:01] so that's just you know for for marriage
[27:03] also it is foundations for a home
[27:06] planning like having a family you know
[27:08] having a family I have to plan for your
[27:10] spouse that you can have a spouse you
[27:12] have to plan for
[27:14] kids if you want to have kids and they
[27:16] have to you know plan to be very
[27:18] tolerant video tolerance because let me
[27:21] tell you the one on one person that will
[27:23] give you mad more than anybody to see
[27:25] your spouse
[27:27] I'm telling you they will they will make
[27:29] you mad but an end because they know you
[27:31] very well and then because you are so
[27:32] used to each other they will make you
[27:34] mad there's nothing spiritual about that
[27:36] so you got to be prepared for that to be
[27:38] able to handle whatever comes from your
[27:41] spouse
[27:41] and that's the foundation I mean it's
[27:43] not a fly it's beautiful let me let me
[27:46] not lie to you Mario it's beautiful I
[27:47] will I would never want to be single but
[27:49] basically it's it is effort work but all
[27:54] the foundation that you had in your
[27:55] single Hood learning from your parents
[27:57] land for people around you the preachers
[27:59] and everything builds you to a point
[28:01] where you're ready
[28:04] to face life with our spouse
[28:06] so nowadays it's like oh I can't do it
[28:09] no more I'm out that's the worst
[28:11] standard in the house of God there's no
[28:13] divorce if you can't do it no more you
[28:15] stay there
[28:16] that's what we're believing if you
[28:17] didn't do it no more you go on your
[28:19] knees and pray you chose that woman it
[28:21] shows that man it's time to start
[28:22] working with them
[28:23] amen that's what that's what I I believe
[28:25] in so marriage and and you know Jesus
[28:28] was saying and when they went to him
[28:30] about just wanted to tempt him and ask
[28:31] him oh about the law of divorce and
[28:33] everything and Jesus said
[28:35] Moses gave you their writing because of
[28:37] your stubborn head yeah
[28:39] but in in the beginning it wasn't so
[28:44] God made Man In His Image and gave him a
[28:47] woman God created The Institute of
[28:49] Marriage and it made it so beautiful
[28:51] that the men and men worked together and
[28:54] the man would be the head receiving from
[28:56] God and supported on his wife now being
[28:58] the wife being submissive to her husband
[29:00] doesn't mean that she's a maid or
[29:03] inferior no she has everybody in the
[29:06] team has a position
[29:07] if these sisters will understand that
[29:09] even your position as you submitted your
[29:11] husband you have a better blessing
[29:13] that's what the scriptures say
[29:15] in supporting that man
[29:17] and submitting your will to him not
[29:20] because you're stupid but because you
[29:22] won't go to bless you when you support
[29:24] when you when you when you when you
[29:25] submit your will to your husband and say
[29:28] Lord please teach my husband whatever he
[29:29] says I follow there's a blessing that
[29:31] comes with it maybe someday I'll speak
[29:33] about the sermon that God gave me about
[29:34] authorities and blessings
[29:37] amen so you know that's about that I'll
[29:40] go for it so I don't waste our time is
[29:42] 11 57. so
[29:48] foundations are important in everything
[29:50] they're doing in life but this morning
[29:51] I'm not talking about
[29:53] I'm not really talking about I'm not
[29:55] really focusing on all the foundations
[29:57] I'm trying to focus on the spiritual
[29:59] Foundation
[30:01] Foundation is important as a believer
[30:04] I have some emergency I got to read this
[30:06] out
[30:09] Foundation is important as a believer
[30:14] foundations
[30:16] determine our life
[30:20] you know direction of our life it
[30:22] determines
[30:23] our spiritual growth whether it's going
[30:25] to be increasing or decreasing
[30:28] amen and you know if I start a little
[30:30] bit here
[30:32] but Brown was talking about you know how
[30:34] a child no
[30:36] after a child is born the first teacher
[30:39] is a child has is the mother
[30:41] the mother is the first teacher you know
[30:43] an Irish child and teaching my feet and
[30:46] she's about to walk teach them how to
[30:47] eat using a spoon and Cutlery and all
[30:49] that all that the dad also do but the
[30:52] mother is one always with a child
[30:55] though that is always no most times I'm
[30:57] going to work and thinking of things and
[30:59] come back maybe the moments mothers and
[31:01] a month and release but the mother is
[31:02] the first
[31:03] first uh teacher the child has but when
[31:06] a child is born remember that child I
[31:08] was born with an endemic nature
[31:10] that nature don't change
[31:12] that nature it is not it's not made up
[31:15] it's just in the gene of that child
[31:17] because it was born like that why do we
[31:19] have a diamond nature when man fail all
[31:22] that came in man the man fell from the
[31:24] garden that nature came a man so when
[31:26] the man is born you don't teach a child
[31:28] how to lie he didn't teach us how to
[31:30] steal from the poor that's the key that
[31:32] I remember I still feel important I get
[31:33] some good spanking
[31:35] my mother didn't play with that are you
[31:36] trying to snake in the kitchen and then
[31:37] you you know in Nigeria you have little
[31:39] straws that goes to the key to the
[31:41] door's kitchen and you walk to the
[31:42] stores yeah
[31:43] who's there
[31:46] and then you can't say nothing because
[31:47] you haven't met in your mouth trying to
[31:49] escape you know so nobody teach a child
[31:52] out to do that
[31:53] it is a nature on that child to do those
[31:56] things those another things that I catch
[31:59] him doing sometimes say you're
[32:00] disappointed until that try to save that
[32:02] child was too exhibit that Adam in
[32:04] nature
[32:06] amen
[32:09] but notice that child is under two
[32:13] religion instruction of his parents or
[32:15] Guardian at that point
[32:18] Library Brown said I mean but the Paul
[32:21] was saying he said that you are the Holy
[32:23] Ghost of that child until that child
[32:24] saved
[32:26] amen now that y'all started learning
[32:29] everything around him so fast and you'll
[32:32] be shocked how fast this generation
[32:33] wears almost like they learn everything
[32:36] it's like it's magnetic just speak it up
[32:38] everything that you said something even
[32:40] some some nuances that you use in the
[32:42] house and words vocabulary they pick it
[32:44] up very fast
[32:46] because they learn I mean guess what
[32:47] those things are from the foundations in
[32:49] your life slowly because you don't know
[32:51] about it's Beauty it's beautiful it's
[32:53] like building bricks slowly slowly they
[32:54] get in there
[32:57] that's why it's very important at home
[33:00] that a child is given a Godly example
[33:04] we can't be all Godly in the church and
[33:07] everything but your child knows you
[33:08] better
[33:09] your spouse know whether you see it or
[33:11] not
[33:14] the father and the mother had like
[33:15] always goes to guide our child and if
[33:18] they don't they'll give account Romans
[33:20] 14 12.
[33:22] you're going to give account man will
[33:24] give account of everything
[33:25] everyone will give a kind of himself to
[33:27] God if what God has given them
[33:30] so that's why we have to very you know
[33:32] careful what we're doing in front of
[33:34] those kids how we treat them the words
[33:36] associated them
[33:38] have to very careful
[33:40] now after that after the child is now a
[33:43] little bit matured and is able to go to
[33:45] school you send him to school
[33:47] I want to send them to school
[33:49] you have another teacher with whatever
[33:51] teacher they have in school but even
[33:53] while they are still in school you're
[33:55] still guiding them
[33:57] the spirits are still in position of
[33:59] guiding and guarding this young
[34:01] energetic energetic fellas like the
[34:03] Bible says Trend that child in the
[34:06] admonition of God
[34:08] very very important
[34:11] and I love Ephesians 6 if you want to
[34:13] read that with me Ephesians 6.
[34:17] 6
[34:21] for
[34:36] I love to read I read that and I read
[34:38] the Amplified version I like the way the
[34:40] employee version really places so
[34:41] children will be your parents and Lord
[34:42] for this is right under their father and
[34:44] mother which is the first commandment
[34:46] with the promise that may be well with
[34:49] thee and thou mayest live longer on the
[34:51] Earth and ye fathers provoking other
[34:53] children to rot but bring them up and
[34:55] nurture
[34:57] and what
[34:59] can I hear that
[35:01] admonition of the Lord I'm gonna read it
[35:03] right here the Amplified version in the
[35:05] city really really beautiful and I want
[35:07] to read that
[35:14] it says children
[35:16] to obey your parents and the Lord that
[35:18] is
[35:19] accept their
[35:23] guidance and discipline as
[35:25] Representatives
[35:28] as Esurance if that means you're you're
[35:30] presenting God I see you're nurturing
[35:31] your child for this is right that is for
[35:35] obedience
[35:36] this is right for to teach wisdom and
[35:39] self-discipline
[35:41] verse 2 honor
[35:43] esteem values precious your father and
[35:47] that goes to young people who were still
[35:48] with their parents today
[35:50] especially if you have Godly Parents you
[35:52] got to listen to them
[35:54] if you're married fine you can take care
[35:56] of yourself lady a young lady young man
[35:58] but when she only appearance is very
[36:00] important they extend to unvalue them
[36:03] and be respectful respect to the thing
[36:05] that's lost in in the um in our
[36:07] environment today even you go to work
[36:09] and I work with a lot of young people
[36:11] who are very young and then there's no
[36:12] respect no way
[36:14] and I've ever seen cases of where you
[36:15] have a father and a son you know it's
[36:18] just very respectful and now if a young
[36:20] man or young man can respect their
[36:22] parents how much more would they
[36:24] disrespect on an outsider they will they
[36:26] will say everything to your face they
[36:28] will cost you out whatever
[36:31] because there's no respect
[36:34] I don't care how much your parents say
[36:36] something to you and you don't feel good
[36:38] about it or maybe you feel you were you
[36:40] know a business with there's no right
[36:42] for you to go back and respond to them I
[36:45] really suspect them because you regret
[36:47] it
[36:48] respect your parents
[36:50] remember you're someone to see it
[36:52] and one day you'd be a parent
[36:54] and you get the same thing that is your
[36:55] parents and you remember
[36:58] so this is the fourth Commandment we
[37:00] promise
[37:01] sometimes I need to get a sermon in
[37:03] authorities and the blessings that come
[37:05] at 30s and the curses that come
[37:07] authorities
[37:08] verse 3 says so that he may be well with
[37:10] you so he wants to succeed and lie I
[37:12] want to first to respect your parents
[37:15] and that's why I see what our generation
[37:17] of generation after me are an early
[37:19] successful successful what they're doing
[37:22] and everything they've been doing I mean
[37:23] they're live at school they've just been
[37:24] they're struggling it's like a big gap
[37:27] between generation that's performing and
[37:29] the one behind me that's a big gap I
[37:32] mean they do great things and they're
[37:34] very successful whatever they're doing
[37:36] but the ones you know younger they just
[37:38] can't succeed because Muslim adverse
[37:40] disrespect for their parents and then
[37:41] it's God's words a principle it will
[37:44] never change it goes from generation to
[37:46] Generation The Gospel stays forever it
[37:48] said this is the this is that fourth
[37:49] Commandment with promise that it may be
[37:52] well with you and that you may have a
[37:53] long life on the Earth
[37:55] so even on longevity is also as a result
[37:59] of respect
[38:02] that's interesting verse 4 fathers do
[38:04] not provoke your children to anger do
[38:06] not exaggerate to the point of
[38:07] resentment with demands that a trivia
[38:09] are unreasonable
[38:11] or immediate and abusive
[38:14] nor by showing favoritism or
[38:17] indifference
[38:20] to any of them but bring them up
[38:22] listen tenderly
[38:24] with loving kindness talk about what our
[38:26] birth pastels preaching about love and
[38:28] discipline and instruction
[38:31] amen
[38:33] and when I was looking at the word bring
[38:34] them up in a nurture it means feed them
[38:36] nourish them that's parents now back to
[38:38] the parents nourish them promotes them
[38:42] to grow
[38:45] when you remember to give them food the
[38:48] amount again Raymond remember to buy
[38:50] them give them Christmas remember to you
[38:52] know send them to school and everything
[38:53] remember they got to feed them the word
[38:54] of God too
[38:56] I'm gonna teach them right because the
[38:58] way you're doing you're laying in
[38:59] foundation in your life before the Holy
[39:01] Spirit comes in
[39:04] feed them in the word of life
[39:07] amen
[39:09] I think we're making Pace here
[39:11] um than I expected so I think we'll be
[39:13] here out of here in time
[39:15] establish them in the truth
[39:18] because I'm gonna tell you the reason
[39:19] why I'm here today is because the man
[39:21] and a woman decide to establish me and
[39:24] the truth it's because the man that
[39:25] woman sacrifice to lay a grit Foundation
[39:28] because I won't be here today I'm
[39:30] telling you I've gone through a whole
[39:31] lot you might see me here calm and easy
[39:34] but I was a tougher too way back so but
[39:37] something that was down that this was
[39:39] laid outside of me a foundation that
[39:43] even before the Holy Ghost came and you
[39:45] know I had that fear of my parents a lot
[39:47] of people to see me do this one I don't
[39:49] know what they do what they do and God
[39:50] put that in in me so that you know
[39:52] everyone although the Spirit came I was
[39:54] able to just grow
[39:56] from that Foundation I was able to you
[39:58] know be some of the foundation amen and
[40:01] you know that's why parents should not
[40:03] hold back don't hold back when your
[40:05] sense in them go lead thing lurking
[40:07] around don't hold back in America today
[40:08] is so clear that even the government
[40:10] don't want to you know reprimand the
[40:13] child no more they don't want you to you
[40:15] know talk to them they give them they
[40:17] had their own rights oh they have their
[40:19] own rights to be able to be gay they
[40:20] have their own right to be able to be
[40:22] lesbian they didn't even know what who
[40:24] they are
[40:25] and then we're having schools today we
[40:27] have schools you know bringing out books
[40:30] for them to read that those kids don't
[40:32] want to stand who they are he doesn't
[40:33] even know whether he said grown man is
[40:35] it my short man it's not or mature woman
[40:37] they're not even there yet
[40:41] it's a prayer parents need to be in a
[40:43] very very you know careful run watching
[40:45] jealous over there over their their
[40:48] children because this word is ready to
[40:50] snag those kids from you
[40:52] and then let me tell you something the
[40:55] word they they shove their own standards
[40:58] on our face
[40:59] look at the amount the the level of or
[41:02] the the percentage of
[41:04] the lgbtq in America it's not involved
[41:06] with 10 maybe 20 Max
[41:09] but they shove in our face they don't
[41:11] care what that water would stand for
[41:12] even on my job in UPS they have oh no a
[41:16] whole month no no dedicated to lgbtq on
[41:21] my share SharePoint uh screen every day
[41:23] I see that that in for that whole month
[41:25] they're trying to project everything and
[41:28] you know the government never is just
[41:29] trying to make oh don't don't don't
[41:30] don't make them mad don't make them mad
[41:33] don't just pamper them and then we'll
[41:36] hear Christians they're a larger
[41:37] percentage and we hide them what we
[41:39] stand for
[41:40] you cannot hide your standards brothers
[41:42] sisters you cannot hide the standards
[41:43] you got to show forth what you're made
[41:45] up of
[41:47] I'm not saying you should be
[41:48] disrespectful in any way don't be
[41:50] disrespectful
[41:52] if you have to work with someone
[41:54] that's a job is fine if you have a work
[41:56] people that don't believe in God it's
[41:58] fine I have people at my job like that
[42:00] but at the same time let them know what
[42:02] you stand for it's very important
[42:05] and let your children know what it
[42:06] stands for so that they don't get think
[42:08] that what they're saying because if you
[42:10] don't tell your children someone's gonna
[42:11] tell them
[42:13] amen
[42:16] would love correct them that they might
[42:18] not they might they might even though
[42:19] they don't get it now you're laying the
[42:21] foundation for them Proverbs 22 22 6.
[42:36] perfectly six I'm already quickly
[42:45] said train up a child no church not your
[42:47] upper child admonish up a child and the
[42:50] way he should go and when it's old he
[42:53] would not depart from it
[42:54] you put the furniture in their lives
[42:57] second Timothy 3 14.
[42:59] to 15 I like Apple told Timothy that
[43:02] second Timothy 3 um 3 14.
[43:19] 3 14 and said
[43:22] Paul's talking here about that post they
[43:23] see what was going to happen to you know
[43:25] the people you know being led away and
[43:28] you know
[43:29] doing different things natural without
[43:32] natural affection truth Breakers and
[43:35] false accuses incontinent and
[43:36] high-mended lovers of government and my
[43:39] love is a pleasure lovers of God and
[43:41] then he came down to verse uh verse 14
[43:44] and said But continuing down with things
[43:46] that doubt us learn
[43:49] so Timothy was somebody taught Timothy
[43:51] even before I became a Minnesota if
[43:53] somebody was teaching him something
[43:55] he said continuing those things that you
[43:57] have learned and has been a short of so
[44:00] there's been a basis that's been a
[44:03] structured laid on the life of Timothy
[44:05] even before it got to this point and
[44:08] he's building on that
[44:10] amen and as as my short of knowing of
[44:13] whom thou has learned them from
[44:17] you've learned it from somebody somebody
[44:19] has to teach you something
[44:21] verse 15 is that from a child that has
[44:24] known the holy scriptures
[44:26] which are able
[44:29] now this Foundation is able
[44:31] to make you wise unto salvation
[44:36] through free
[44:37] which is in Christ Jesus
[44:41] now this Foundation laying on them if
[44:43] they are God's seed it will prepare them
[44:45] towards the saving Christ to drive them
[44:47] through it I don't care for the good let
[44:50] them go left and right up and down let
[44:52] them go back in the world because they
[44:54] have gone sit in them goes and bring
[44:55] them back to him
[44:58] if they're not God said we can't help
[45:00] but the rest is God's hands but do your
[45:02] part
[45:03] the reason why you're doing your part is
[45:04] that you want to make sure that you're
[45:05] not accountable
[45:07] for their blood
[45:09] I'm always telling me scriptures I
[45:11] thought sometimes there's this cure for
[45:12] me I remember sometimes in Ezekiel I'm
[45:13] not saying how you know
[45:16] that if you don't say the truth the
[45:18] blood will be upon you so if you're
[45:20] holding back and something they're
[45:22] supposed to do right
[45:23] and he said oh I just you know just let
[45:26] him be it's a new age you're gonna
[45:29] suffer for it
[45:32] then go then you give account for her
[45:34] like you know the Bible said
[45:38] something happened when I you know I've
[45:40] just been been playing here so excuse me
[45:43] for I'm being overly playing
[45:47] we came out of a
[45:49] service sometimes from certain place I
[45:52] want to mention
[45:54] and then we got home and then my
[45:56] daughter had a it's doing a little paint
[45:58] in the hand and my fingers I was like
[45:59] what are you doing
[46:01] and she's been a lot of nothing
[46:03] I saw her I saw a young young sister so
[46:06] I'm so opinion I I finger I was like
[46:09] okay
[46:10] so at that point I was like I told my
[46:12] wife what do I do I mean she's she was
[46:14] three or four I can't remember randomly
[46:16] said okay all right what's going on here
[46:19] so the only thing I could tell her was
[46:21] like you know we don't believe in pain
[46:23] in the fingers
[46:25] if God if God wanted you to have
[46:28] that blue finger it would give you a
[46:29] blue finger
[46:33] if God wanted to have more eyelashes it
[46:35] would give you more eyelashes
[46:39] you're going to have long nails getting
[46:43] here you like giving you that
[46:45] because I know that the Bible said God
[46:47] make made you you and you
[46:51] it made you you're fearfully and
[46:53] wonderfully made
[46:54] it spent time to shape you to a unique
[46:57] person that you are
[46:59] so why so I thought I told my daughter I
[47:01] said hey I mean I said we don't believe
[47:03] in this
[47:04] because the only woman that I know that
[47:05] painted our nails was Jesus upon the
[47:07] Bible
[47:08] I said over the bro but I'm like but the
[47:10] Bible didn't say we should spend our
[47:11] nails or not or fix our nails or not
[47:14] it didn't say that
[47:15] but what does it stand for
[47:17] what does it signify there's certain
[47:19] things that it don't make sense that
[47:22] there's no place in the Bible that the
[47:24] Bible says should do this and that but
[47:25] what a zika note what is it Association
[47:28] associated with
[47:30] because that woman that painted nails in
[47:32] the Bible and painting our lips and you
[47:34] know fix whatever she was doing with
[47:36] that she was disability to God and the
[47:38] suspected God's servant and God's
[47:39] promise and dogs at her up
[47:42] the little blood a man
[47:44] so
[47:46] I'm just laying a plan to you it's for
[47:47] you to desire so I told my daughter I
[47:49] said well don't believe in that I
[47:50] thought my wife I said my wife was
[47:52] telling you know I wouldn't believe in
[47:53] that
[47:54] and then I was then I was thinking this
[47:56] morning because I was up to like 6 30. I
[47:59] could gonna I couldn't sleep because I
[48:01] just started bringing stuff in my mind
[48:03] especially when I have to preach like
[48:04] that I don't really sleep through the
[48:05] night I sleep two hours I'm fine because
[48:07] I want to see I just want to go to tell
[48:09] me exactly what it has I don't want to
[48:10] just make up something
[48:12] so this morning I was now you know
[48:15] starting and then I remember the brand
[48:17] said when he went to hell he saw the
[48:19] same thing in hell of a woman pain in
[48:21] the face and all that and that you know
[48:23] I was like so if I sit up with that
[48:25] sister while you painting your fingers
[48:26] why are you fixing Nails it's up to you
[48:29] what's it what is it Associated what
[48:31] does it signify
[48:34] and then lately also I saw some Trends
[48:37] you know among our young sisters having
[48:38] anklets like on their on the on their
[48:41] toe under on their feet
[48:43] and I was worried about it I was judging
[48:47] anybody else worried about it I was like
[48:49] what's going on parents you gotta say
[48:51] something to your kids
[48:53] don't hold back if you know better let
[48:56] them know
[48:57] if doing any better it's fine but if you
[49:00] know better and you have to turn right
[49:01] because I know the generation of parents
[49:04] older than me about my age we had some
[49:07] good teaching
[49:08] you got to let this new generation know
[49:10] what we stand for
[49:13] so how's words I want to do a little
[49:15] research on what anklets are because
[49:17] it's big English I'm from Africa so I
[49:19] just you know sat down and did a little
[49:21] research I was reading through through
[49:23] different you know ministers
[49:26] International Spirit birming incident
[49:28] about it you know I was just I've
[49:29] written about so I saw an Isaiah where
[49:32] there it was mentioned there and Isaiah
[49:34] 3 you can go read it 3 16.
[49:37] and verse 16 and verse you know 18
[49:41] Isaiah 3 16 16 to 18 and talked I talked
[49:44] about it twice and let's talk about
[49:47] Bengals on their feet
[49:49] so I was just you know reading through
[49:50] it and I did a research I found that in
[49:52] India
[49:54] there is
[49:56] um some marriages there the man gets a
[49:59] woman as you know
[50:00] so it's like I'm you're married to you
[50:02] and everything
[50:04] and I was like okay so what about the
[50:06] cultures and I found out here in America
[50:08] he meant a lot I was discussing my one
[50:10] of my employees the police at work I was
[50:13] telling and I said I said what do you
[50:15] think about no Atlas she was like oh
[50:18] so I wear them I said do you do you know
[50:20] what I did search this is what I found
[50:21] out
[50:22] I found that that ankles had a meaning
[50:25] to swingers this were much or that once
[50:28] I went I don't say more than that other
[50:30] meaning to the lgbtq you know
[50:34] you know group
[50:36] and it means certain things when it's
[50:38] you're wearing your left right over your
[50:40] you know pants or whatever you're
[50:42] wearing it it made it I said I mean I
[50:44] was like this is not godly
[50:47] and then I look at where the scripture
[50:49] talk about it it was talking about the
[50:51] daughter of Zion now that I left God out
[50:53] there were probably talked about Pride
[50:55] it talked about I wrote it somewhere
[50:58] because I tried it talked about
[51:00] arrogance talk about a few other things
[51:03] that was you know as I said with those
[51:04] women
[51:06] they would remember the daughters of God
[51:09] because Zion is is the city of God so we
[51:12] the other side is that us of God but
[51:14] they were
[51:16] off track and they said to you know
[51:19] react to God's word in Iron away and
[51:20] that's what that scriptures keep going
[51:22] we can't read it
[51:25] and I was like wow this is deep
[51:29] so sisters if you still wear your anklet
[51:31] it's okay
[51:33] but check the spirit that comes behind
[51:34] it and if you notice in this war today
[51:36] there's always a spirit that comes with
[51:38] passion
[51:39] Fashion's a big thing it's we're laying
[51:42] foundations here brothers and sisters so
[51:44] please excuse me fashion is a big thing
[51:46] a big Trend that the devil uses accounts
[51:50] to spit very strong Spirits so Believers
[51:53] have to bury watch outside Bible the
[51:55] Bible Bible said the the enemy comes to
[51:57] ask two two three things to do to still
[51:59] kill on Destroy says lock an hour like a
[52:01] land suit it's going to be divorce very
[52:03] smart
[52:04] I hope this question is nice let me tell
[52:06] you fashion is good I like dressing nice
[52:08] I like dressing good but when the spirit
[52:11] if you can discern it certain spirit
[52:13] that comes with certain dressing or
[52:15] accessories
[52:17] it's gonna mess up your spirit
[52:20] so if you want to wear anklets it's fine
[52:21] that's that's your choice but if you
[52:23] have those spirit in you it's something
[52:24] this is going to tell you what is that
[52:26] associated with the go to do so go
[52:27] online just type anklets what it means
[52:30] you just you know check it out but all
[52:33] I'm saying essence you know talking
[52:34] about all this you know pain and all
[52:35] that all I'm saying in essence that
[52:37] parents need to watch out for their kids
[52:39] and also admonish them in Love Don't
[52:42] shout on them don't yell on them
[52:43] sometimes they're very firm which is
[52:45] okay but let them know that you love
[52:47] them I want them to grow in the way of
[52:49] the Lord and you want their life to
[52:51] better because you want them to receive
[52:54] the Holy Ghost
[52:57] if you want them to only goes to go to
[52:59] prepare children to receive it
[53:06] prepare those kids to receive the holy
[53:08] ghosts if you don't do it don't get it
[53:13] tell them the truth
[53:15] it might be hard right now they might
[53:16] not understand it
[53:18] they'll get to understand later sisters
[53:20] let your dress in an accessory glorify
[53:23] God
[53:24] that's what that's all we're doing if my
[53:26] dressing at the point in time you might
[53:28] say oh okay I said brother I don't have
[53:30] any issues with that now I see Brothers
[53:32] in the message now it's the message
[53:33] right now
[53:34] they start growing it turn into I'm not
[53:37] I'm not saying should not take over here
[53:38] as a man too I mean I love when I put
[53:40] some real in my hair and letting it
[53:42] no look good even though I'm losing a
[53:43] little bit don't look at that so but you
[53:45] know I love looking good but I'm not
[53:47] saying you don't take care of your hair
[53:48] I mean if you have to put some like
[53:50] brother Brandon you know sometimes it
[53:51] just brush it's really shiny I know it's
[53:53] why I've lost that I love it dress now
[53:56] is that's the balance to it but when it
[53:57] gets a point where your dressing
[54:00] accessories and things doing is now you
[54:03] know
[54:04] affect and high glorify God I can't look
[54:07] at you and say there is God there's a
[54:08] problem and now in the ranks of the
[54:10] message you have brothers now turn their
[54:12] hair to Crazy Birds and it's going up a
[54:14] little bit now the next thing what
[54:16] they're doing they're not braiding it
[54:18] they're making a converse with it
[54:21] so it's a step it's you know what number
[54:24] error is this you're going you can't you
[54:25] don't go there right away
[54:27] it's just one step out and I step out
[54:30] even but the Browns have been correct it
[54:32] is coming you keep going keep going
[54:34] before you know you you're out there
[54:37] so when there's an error in your life or
[54:39] you send error in the life of your kids
[54:41] don't wait to correct correct you right
[54:43] away because every smile is quick is
[54:45] it's smart it's quick too
[54:48] late to accessories glorify God let's
[54:50] address and glorify God
[54:53] amen
[54:54] excuse me if I'm too if I'm too open
[54:57] this morning but I'm just being honest
[55:02] now of that child when that charged with
[55:04] the age of accountability you know and
[55:07] then they're grown
[55:09] they now have to have their own life
[55:12] then after their own you know you know
[55:14] their own uh what they call it their own
[55:16] uh uh
[55:18] their own foundations as I said
[55:20] Christian and Foundation is it's very
[55:22] very important very important as a child
[55:24] to have your own Foundation
[55:27] I mean as an adult having partnership
[55:29] because now that child is out of your
[55:30] then you know let them left from their
[55:33] right that there's a lot the the age of
[55:35] accountability maybe the 18 or whatever
[55:38] it didn't have they have to receive
[55:39] Christ themselves and you know basically
[55:42] spiritual foundation for that child is
[55:44] not important that that young man or
[55:46] that was a young woman is not very
[55:47] important where they have to grow to
[55:50] have a personal relationship with God
[55:52] amen I heard something I was trying to
[55:55] look for something I wrote that God just
[55:57] put on my heart
[55:58] I guess we're here
[56:02] now spiritual Foundation is a different
[56:04] thing
[56:05] basically because that's that's my aim
[56:07] today I don't know I think I'm gonna
[56:08] finish everything but at least I can I
[56:10] can you know finish I've just run
[56:12] through it and maybe another time go
[56:14] through it I'll be enjoying the service
[56:15] this morning
[56:16] can you say Amen if you enjoying it
[56:20] so this Foundation you know is very
[56:22] important you know when Jesus is talking
[56:24] in Matthew chapter 7 about
[56:28] personal spiritual Foundation
[56:31] now that parents have later foundership
[56:33] foundation for them as a non-oly ghost
[56:36] fifth person now they're growing now and
[56:39] they now see they need the need for them
[56:41] to be baptized to baptize now they said
[56:44] Foundation being laid
[56:45] amen
[56:48] solid foundation is important
[56:50] for every believer
[56:53] no matter the position that you're
[56:55] you're holding the church you might be
[56:57] the the uh this director he might be the
[56:59] musician it might be the an offering
[57:01] taker he might be the officer you might
[57:02] be the teacher you might be even every
[57:04] Pastor your soul needs a solid
[57:06] foundation in God's word and that's what
[57:09] you're just saying in Matthew 7 there
[57:12] was a foundation that you can build on
[57:14] remember we're talking about solid
[57:15] foundation development and growth of a
[57:18] believer
[57:20] you have to grow from being a child
[57:23] now Paul's saying that the babies
[57:25] drinking milk from there to go to be
[57:27] adults
[57:29] that eat bones
[57:33] Believers acting like a chicken have to
[57:35] get a realization of who God has made
[57:37] them
[57:38] to become Eagles manifesting themselves
[57:41] or a chicken and an eagle in a Chicken
[57:45] Barn who doesn't know who he is you know
[57:47] so spiritual Foundation is is important
[57:51] and our foundations go left and right
[57:53] just talk about that rock
[57:55] remember that rock what a rock signifies
[57:58] it signifies that I wrote it right here
[58:00] Iraq signifies
[58:03] Iraq signifies life through the Spirit
[58:06] by grace
[58:08] that's what Roxanne finds so we're
[58:10] staying out the house on that rock
[58:15] the foundation and they asked to build
[58:17] under the wind and the the rain
[58:21] came and the floors came and it was not
[58:23] moved
[58:25] spiritually a foundation in the
[58:28] spiritual you know in the spiritualism
[58:29] is way different from what we're talking
[58:31] about and a million times different
[58:32] because Christ is the foundation that
[58:35] we're talking about
[58:36] is a Chief Cornerstone
[58:38] is the architect is the bricklayer is
[58:41] the engineer he's one that does the
[58:43] framework is everything
[58:44] in the foundation of the foundation that
[58:46] we're talking about physically you know
[58:47] those foundations you know it's it's
[58:49] easy you know for part of a team to pull
[58:52] out and everything Chromebooks but in
[58:54] this Spanish I was talking about it is a
[58:56] strong Foundation that cries and
[58:58] self-build itself in this world I'll be
[59:00] in my church we choose what the
[59:01] Revelation which is Christ himself
[59:04] amen
[59:05] a soul needs to grow to adulthood and
[59:08] manifest Christ full fledge
[59:11] amen
[59:13] Proverbs 23 24 I love this scripture
[59:16] perfectly found really for coming open
[59:18] your scriptures with me verse 24.
[59:34] verse 24
[59:36] I read it in King James I also read it
[59:38] in um
[59:39] in the other
[59:40] um uh version
[59:42] um Amplified I love that Amplified
[59:44] version sometimes the way it you know
[59:46] explains it
[59:48] 20 24
[59:51] from 28 from three verse three to four
[59:53] that's what that's what I'm yeah so
[59:55] through wisdom notice through wisdom is
[59:58] and house beated not on by understanding
[1:00:01] it is established I remember talking
[1:00:03] about Foundation establishment
[1:00:05] and by a knowledge the Chamber of the
[1:00:08] field with all pressures and pleasant
[1:00:10] riches
[1:00:12] now here here what the Amplified you
[1:00:15] know said he said through wisdom James 3
[1:00:17] 15 to 7 talks about two types of wisdom
[1:00:19] remember
[1:00:20] this one that sensual early this
[1:00:22] devilish
[1:00:23] that's not from above
[1:00:25] there's another wisdom that's pure
[1:00:27] Peaceable gentle
[1:00:29] easy to be entreated full of mercy and
[1:00:32] good fruits without partiality than
[1:00:33] without no hypocrisy so look at two
[1:00:36] wisdom here through wisdom not the
[1:00:38] wisdom of the world but the wisdom of
[1:00:40] wisdom of God
[1:00:41] Godly wisdom a house
[1:00:44] in life
[1:00:46] a home
[1:00:48] a family
[1:00:49] is built
[1:00:52] and by understanding
[1:00:54] it is established on a sound and good
[1:00:58] foundation
[1:01:01] and by knowledge verse 4 by knowledge
[1:01:03] not the knowledge of the world but
[1:01:05] knowledge of how I can do it but my
[1:01:06] effort knowledge of the of the same word
[1:01:09] the word of God by Revelation it's rooms
[1:01:12] remember it's a foundation
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:15] enemy wisdom that has to build on the
[1:01:19] established Foundation
[1:01:21] wisdom of God
[1:01:22] and by knowledge
[1:01:25] now in that house their rooms the rooms
[1:01:27] are filled
[1:01:31] its rooms are filled with all precious
[1:01:35] he says of great price value worth and
[1:01:38] pleasant riches not silver
[1:01:40] the richest is talking about is not the
[1:01:42] origin of silver and gold
[1:01:44] oppositions so you've had account or a
[1:01:47] high earning job a big business but the
[1:01:50] riches of God
[1:01:52] is abundant fullness of wisdom is power
[1:01:58] The Riches of God is not what men think
[1:02:00] it is men think about it which is what I
[1:02:02] can you know what I can see he has a
[1:02:04] brand new car has like five cars in the
[1:02:06] yard he has a no big Garden another back
[1:02:08] yes it's nice this is a very good I mean
[1:02:10] they're missing him but they're very
[1:02:11] good the rich stuff guys now are women
[1:02:14] dresses or the kind of job he has it's
[1:02:16] kind of business The Riches of God are
[1:02:18] wisdom and power
[1:02:28] strength and power that gives us of
[1:02:31] mercy so that I will give Mercy to woman
[1:02:33] I have mercy on um
[1:02:35] Exodus 3 19 and also Grace because in my
[1:02:39] greatest option for you that's the
[1:02:41] riches of Christ
[1:02:42] remember you're filling that house up
[1:02:45] Ephesians 3 also said they're about the
[1:02:47] riches of Christ if you want to read
[1:02:48] that with me Ephesians 3 verse 16. you
[1:02:50] can't read that only if you want to buy
[1:02:51] them already real quickly right now
[1:02:52] before I go ahead amen
[1:02:57] if she has 3 16.
[1:03:00] so this is my house is filled with no
[1:03:02] ridges
[1:03:03] The Riches of God wisdom power mercy and
[1:03:06] Grace
[1:03:11] are you with me this morning
[1:03:13] every chance three I'm gonna read it
[1:03:15] quickly too
[1:03:24] three
[1:03:28] I'll start from uh verse 13.
[1:03:40] we're talking about the riches of Christ
[1:03:41] here now and said wherefore wherefore at
[1:03:44] that even know that my tribulations for
[1:03:46] you which is your glory for this course
[1:03:47] I bow my names unto father of our Lord
[1:03:49] Jesus Christ or from the old family in
[1:03:52] Heaven and Earth is named that it will
[1:03:54] grant you
[1:03:55] according to the riches of his glory
[1:03:58] remember
[1:03:59] which is of Glory to be strengthened and
[1:04:01] with might by Spirit the Inner Man
[1:04:05] so this house talking about as a
[1:04:07] foundation the foundation is very
[1:04:08] important as we're saying amen us have a
[1:04:11] spiritual Foundation he has to meet God
[1:04:13] Abram talked about meeting God at the
[1:04:16] back of the desert
[1:04:17] that's the foundation that has to be
[1:04:19] laid because if you don't have it
[1:04:22] we'll talk about the wind in a few
[1:04:23] minutes the winds will come
[1:04:25] flawed will come the Reigns will come
[1:04:29] and you know what you know what's going
[1:04:31] to happen after that
[1:04:32] that Foundation is solid now depends
[1:04:34] I've done that part a Believer I have to
[1:04:36] meet Christ himself and you know the
[1:04:38] foundation of of a Believer you know
[1:04:41] it's not just
[1:04:42] oh I just like this the nation say oh
[1:04:45] Lord I said to them that's my personal
[1:04:46] and savior and that's it you're safe
[1:04:48] nope
[1:04:49] it's women on that there are some
[1:04:51] process to it
[1:04:52] remember Peter Peter was a man that I've
[1:04:55] been with God all that's why it's in God
[1:04:57] face to face it slept with God and I
[1:04:59] went and stepping in the same room with
[1:05:01] God he ate in the same place but God he
[1:05:04] saw everything but you know what when
[1:05:05] the wind came he could not withstand it
[1:05:09] he ran back to his fishing trade
[1:05:13] why because he was there he was a child
[1:05:15] of God remember he was doing all he can
[1:05:17] do but there was no Foundation strong
[1:05:19] enough to build any spiritual house
[1:05:22] remember this Foundation that we're
[1:05:24] talking about this Foundation we're
[1:05:26] talking about the foundation on the rock
[1:05:27] with scratches it's one that needs a
[1:05:29] house to be built on it
[1:05:32] and that house Christ has to live in
[1:05:34] that house live in the house and and
[1:05:36] ship that house to what he sees remember
[1:05:38] he's a designer Peter just you know he
[1:05:41] was doing everything he wasn't even
[1:05:43] feeling even because our demons remember
[1:05:46] but there was no Foundation there
[1:05:48] was nothing solid that because we stand
[1:05:50] the test of time
[1:05:55] so now when a man has been you know
[1:05:58] saved
[1:06:00] you go to Christ you receive Christ in
[1:06:03] your life when a surprise in your life
[1:06:05] there's a step whereby it says to be
[1:06:07] baptized no in the name of Jesus saying
[1:06:10] that means when you say the word
[1:06:11] dependence is saying I'm going this way
[1:06:13] and all of a sudden you change direction
[1:06:16] angles and that's what the word
[1:06:17] repentance means so if you are saying
[1:06:20] I'm repent and then your life hasn't
[1:06:22] changed Direction and something hasn't
[1:06:23] happened yet there has to be a change a
[1:06:25] total change
[1:06:27] from who you are and I remember that
[1:06:29] what brown was saying about but Paul
[1:06:31] writing sometimes about that man who the
[1:06:33] light the the is Pastor or whatever
[1:06:35] they're telling me as demons he has
[1:06:37] issues excuse me and
[1:06:40] but Obama asked him when did you know
[1:06:44] didn't get changed when did you did you
[1:06:46] feel a change in your life now I said
[1:06:48] years ago I said I used to be this and
[1:06:50] then then I talked about the Battle
[1:06:51] system but after that one day I decided
[1:06:53] to just you know receive good and that's
[1:06:56] top right there and I'm newer change up
[1:06:58] in my life and Abraham said that moment
[1:07:00] when you felt that change and you
[1:07:01] couldn't do the things you're doing way
[1:07:03] back you're not doing those things
[1:07:05] normally those habitants said that there
[1:07:07] you go save
[1:07:09] and when a man received Christ the first
[1:07:11] thing you do you got to let go of your
[1:07:12] always you got to realize that you're
[1:07:14] going to let go of those ways repent and
[1:07:17] now follow the instructions of God so
[1:07:19] you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:22] Acts 2 38 and now in the world right now
[1:07:24] you go in the word and I say oh you came
[1:07:26] up Jesus
[1:07:30] they're right and wrong
[1:07:31] I'll prove it to you
[1:07:33] they're wrong because they baptized in
[1:07:36] the name of father son only goes taken
[1:07:37] that's the name of God
[1:07:40] before Matthew Matthew
[1:07:42] um 28 I think 19 they was talking about
[1:07:44] going out in the world baptizing in the
[1:07:47] name singular not plural name of the
[1:07:50] father
[1:07:52] name of what the Sun
[1:07:54] and the Holy Holy spiritual insane this
[1:07:57] is the same name I'm talking about is
[1:07:58] the father is the Son and it's to the
[1:08:00] Holy Spirit so they missed it they're
[1:08:03] right it's to the name of Allah but
[1:08:05] there's a name attached to it
[1:08:12] but that man is the husband's his wife
[1:08:14] as a father says to our brother I saw
[1:08:17] the video that's a beautiful video right
[1:08:19] there I was so touched when I saw you
[1:08:20] walking down with her
[1:08:22] and he's uh
[1:08:25] sound to his father Italian father he
[1:08:26] has Italian jeans on him
[1:08:28] but he has a name
[1:08:30] if I don't call him by that name he will
[1:08:31] not answer me if I say father and walk
[1:08:33] to him he'll just this man is crazy
[1:08:35] I said Brandon I need money this is oh
[1:08:37] yes just call my name and that's
[1:08:40] exactly but that's what it is because
[1:08:42] God has a name that's attached to him
[1:08:45] that at that name every name must bow
[1:08:47] and every tongue shall confess that
[1:08:50] Jesus Christ is Lord and King
[1:08:54] and when that name is mentioned even
[1:08:57] whispered
[1:08:59] do you hear me even when you whispered
[1:09:01] her name even in the depth of your heart
[1:09:03] without even saying now demons tremble
[1:09:06] because they say power to that name and
[1:09:09] that's why we're baptized it's not a
[1:09:11] name that's why we receive that name
[1:09:12] because it's not just a regular name
[1:09:15] that is God's name
[1:09:17] if you receive it you receive life
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:23] so that's why we're baptized in that
[1:09:24] name we receive God as a foundation in
[1:09:25] our life you see God and you baptize the
[1:09:28] name of Jesus Christ you're saying and
[1:09:30] after you do that it's not about this is
[1:09:32] not changing
[1:09:33] it's the obedience
[1:09:35] or to that word so you've been Thy word
[1:09:37] and say you have baptize the name of
[1:09:38] Jesus Christ whatever sin I said Lord I
[1:09:40] believe and I don't do it and then our
[1:09:42] obedience brings you to the to receive
[1:09:45] to for your heart to be prepared now
[1:09:47] there's a foundation you know you're not
[1:09:49] ready to say Lord I'm ready this
[1:09:51] Foundation is ready for you to work on
[1:09:52] and guess what the Holy Spirit coming
[1:09:54] and Peter said that's him Peter we're
[1:09:56] talking about that was scared of people
[1:09:59] that's Saint Peter that I was scared of
[1:10:00] the Paris that was hiding now you know
[1:10:02] said do you know Jesus I don't know me
[1:10:05] I don't know that man
[1:10:07] same Peter
[1:10:09] and you just said you you would deny him
[1:10:11] interested me you know
[1:10:13] Peter was it was a very bold man it was
[1:10:16] full of himself he believed that I could
[1:10:18] do it by his own efforts she just oh no
[1:10:20] I deny I'll be with you
[1:10:22] but guess what when the wind came he
[1:10:24] couldn't he could only stand it
[1:10:26] so that Foundation
[1:10:29] what happened to him he said it said be
[1:10:31] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:10:32] the remyama sin so that the gift of all
[1:10:34] the girls would come to you
[1:10:36] now when you receive that give a give up
[1:10:38] the Holy Ghost it's not only on to you
[1:10:40] you have the power to transmit that Holy
[1:10:43] Ghost
[1:10:44] in geology because we when we call
[1:10:46] something an aquifer if you ever heard
[1:10:48] of the word aquifer Hui fer there's
[1:10:51] aquifer there's aquitard there's Aqua
[1:10:54] glute
[1:10:55] and basically what those words mean in
[1:10:57] geologists in what what are engineering
[1:11:00] or geology what are geology it means
[1:11:02] that you can
[1:11:04] take fluid in and transmit it
[1:11:09] so now the aquifer is only
[1:11:13] settlement or basement or soil that can
[1:11:16] take any fluid that whatever fleets can
[1:11:18] be just keep taking it and transmit that
[1:11:20] same fluid clean water now it's not just
[1:11:22] any kind of water clean groundwater
[1:11:25] to give it to another person so when I
[1:11:27] receive the Holy Ghost when is that
[1:11:29] Foundation has settled and receive all
[1:11:30] it was in your life you have the power
[1:11:32] to transmit it because at that point but
[1:11:34] Paul was saying you're not just any kind
[1:11:36] you're not I'm not a Christ
[1:11:38] the little another one you're able to to
[1:11:40] give life to another person that's why
[1:11:42] the words of your mouth is very
[1:11:43] important what would you say
[1:11:45] because you are not a Christ on two feet
[1:11:47] you cannot just say any kind of word
[1:11:50] that's why James said him because James
[1:11:51] said the three I thought I remember but
[1:11:53] he was saying that this tongue is a
[1:11:55] powerful thing and now when you have the
[1:11:57] Holy Ghost whatever he say is going to
[1:11:59] happen like that just like that
[1:12:01] yesterday I was I need something to get
[1:12:04] thicker than things and I was thinking
[1:12:05] my mind I said you know Lord I know you
[1:12:07] provide for me I'll use this app I just
[1:12:10] spending this money I'll just cover and
[1:12:12] that's Lord if you just provide some
[1:12:13] money before the night falls I just
[1:12:15] believe that you would do it and then I
[1:12:17] didn't tell my wife what happened later
[1:12:18] somebody just sent us some money say hey
[1:12:19] here here it is for
[1:12:22] um it has a birthday and you guys have
[1:12:24] it
[1:12:25] so my wife saw me this morning I said
[1:12:26] you don't know where that money came
[1:12:27] from
[1:12:28] I said I was telling God yesterday I
[1:12:30] needed something to do I said this is
[1:12:32] what I said Lord before night for I want
[1:12:34] you to do something I want to take care
[1:12:36] of this and God provided that money for
[1:12:37] her she didn't know why but I said
[1:12:39] that's the money right there before
[1:12:40] nights of course I went to bed and then
[1:12:42] last night so send the money to me we
[1:12:46] are Christ and two feet
[1:12:50] he said if you believe in Christ that
[1:12:52] Greater Works that you do
[1:12:54] not just then he did
[1:12:57] how many I'm gonna I don't know how many
[1:12:59] I can't remember how many people Jesus
[1:13:00] verse on the dead but I say you do more
[1:13:03] so be careful yourself your actions
[1:13:05] because those things will manifest
[1:13:07] because you have really goes inside of
[1:13:09] you so that's foundation on that
[1:13:11] Foundation has been the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:12] everything I keep going and then now
[1:13:14] when you have the only girls we'll talk
[1:13:15] about the winds now the rain and the
[1:13:16] Florida and the wind's Gonna Come
[1:13:19] man that's why I was gonna come
[1:13:21] you can't hold it back it's inevitable
[1:13:23] that's why I'll come one way or the
[1:13:25] other if it comes even through someone
[1:13:26] that's very close to you God will use
[1:13:29] God can even use your wife to try you
[1:13:30] job was was an example
[1:13:38] you know they were compatible
[1:13:41] but she was so pushed the wall that God
[1:13:43] used his wife to ask in the curse God
[1:13:46] and die
[1:13:48] but guess what Joe Biden Foundation
[1:13:52] I tell you job acid added solid
[1:13:54] foundation
[1:13:55] that Foundation could not be shaken but
[1:13:57] it was not a man or some creative dogmas
[1:13:59] or some church services or some message
[1:14:02] you know affiliation it was based on
[1:14:05] Christ the word he said I know I believe
[1:14:08] and I'm persuaded
[1:14:13] he said this word said mother Mary did
[1:14:15] my leave
[1:14:16] I'm funner than him and Let's cross The
[1:14:19] Rock
[1:14:20] life Giver
[1:14:25] the wind will come Brothers
[1:14:27] sisters the wind will come
[1:14:29] and that's why you look in the message
[1:14:30] today you see people we will look up to
[1:14:32] as examples as good preachers and they
[1:14:35] just fall away
[1:14:37] yeah you wonder but Lord why I'm not I'm
[1:14:40] not I'm not judging them I'm just saying
[1:14:42] but Lord why
[1:14:45] if you go find the verse of it sometimes
[1:14:46] you find out that there was no
[1:14:48] foundation in there
[1:14:49] you know especially I grew up in the
[1:14:51] message I can tell you we can't talk
[1:14:53] message
[1:14:54] we can act messy we can dress message
[1:14:56] and you will not know
[1:14:58] we can you we need to stop doing that
[1:15:00] because it will not save you when the
[1:15:02] wind comes the wind will shake you and
[1:15:05] pull it off your roots because you
[1:15:06] you're just following it's good to
[1:15:08] follow it's fine I mean but there's more
[1:15:10] to it
[1:15:11] there's no power in all the dressing all
[1:15:13] the Talking message you know I'm telling
[1:15:15] you I message kids we for those of us
[1:15:18] who left we left the war we can left the
[1:15:20] war directly to the message we
[1:15:21] understand how the life is but we're in
[1:15:24] the message we don't really you know we
[1:15:26] ain't in church always even though we
[1:15:28] don't do it our parents make us do it
[1:15:30] but sometimes we don't really like honor
[1:15:33] God but let me tell Young Brother young
[1:15:35] sister you got to meet God one-on-one
[1:15:41] Lindsay and a few people here I think
[1:15:43] but then our God took me from alcoholism
[1:15:45] and it revealed himself to me the
[1:15:48] alcohol is not what a Christian should
[1:15:49] have because I like I said there's some
[1:15:51] things that they will not tell the Bible
[1:15:53] will not tell you don't do so don't do
[1:15:54] that
[1:15:55] but the Revelation that's how the
[1:15:58] foundation has to be established in you
[1:16:00] where it's you and God
[1:16:03] one of those days if you want to hear
[1:16:05] the full story I'll tell you if you want
[1:16:06] to meet 101 but one of those days I was
[1:16:09] high and I was in college I was maybe my
[1:16:11] second year
[1:16:12] and I'm gonna tell you this my dad
[1:16:14] doesn't even know about this
[1:16:16] I'm just telling you I'm sure it's here
[1:16:18] for the first time and
[1:16:20] man this is how every young man's life
[1:16:24] goes
[1:16:26] you think you know your child no you
[1:16:27] don't
[1:16:29] we can't really pretend that's why I got
[1:16:31] to pray that that child really really
[1:16:33] really have an into you know uh
[1:16:35] interaction or experience with God so
[1:16:37] that even when you're not there your
[1:16:39] mind is at rest
[1:16:43] I went to college and I was you know
[1:16:44] doing pretty well
[1:16:46] to my jealous and everything then I met
[1:16:48] some young man in the church there's so
[1:16:50] many churches I'll go there and you know
[1:16:53] this is no this is not nothing wrong
[1:16:55] with this and they just
[1:16:57] you know and they use scriptures to even
[1:17:00] tell you certain things I hope Paul told
[1:17:02] too much to drink drink little wine
[1:17:05] be careful when people come to you in
[1:17:07] the name of the scriptures
[1:17:09] and now I even in the message I'm
[1:17:11] telling even message sometimes I'm
[1:17:12] wearing candy I just said this people
[1:17:13] will believe that you can still drink
[1:17:15] that's what I'm saying oh the Bible
[1:17:17] didn't say do or don't do it but that
[1:17:19] what does what does it stand for us it's
[1:17:21] associated with you got to be careful
[1:17:23] so I got into it and now okay A little
[1:17:25] Finance part I never bought it any any
[1:17:27] drinking any alcohol my own money if you
[1:17:30] ask the people can you give me some
[1:17:31] money to hold I got if you say oh okay
[1:17:33] get some drink they'll buy it for a
[1:17:34] drink
[1:17:36] I slowly I got into it slowly I do I
[1:17:38] drink it though you know I was not crazy
[1:17:40] about just okay maybe a little bit five
[1:17:42] percent seven percent just slowly like I
[1:17:44] say error from error to air
[1:17:48] and one day I was I was hung up I had my
[1:17:50] uncle very few I've been there you know
[1:17:51] I'm talking about
[1:17:52] I lay down on my bed in the room I had
[1:17:54] those uh to pick a bed you know when I
[1:17:57] was calling to my dad you know God bless
[1:17:58] him he could provide everything I needed
[1:18:01] and I was laying there now and this is
[1:18:02] the same Bible I'm talking to you I
[1:18:03] bought a cover just to cover it up
[1:18:05] listen bye-bye I'm preaching out from
[1:18:07] open itself
[1:18:10] to progress 20. strong wine is a marker
[1:18:16] up with the message I know exactly what
[1:18:18] happens when this beneath those papers
[1:18:20] sleep
[1:18:22] I know I'm you know exactly what's going
[1:18:24] on guess what somebody taught me right
[1:18:28] I knew when those people asleep
[1:18:30] I'm not playing with that no more even
[1:18:31] though I was kind of what in there no I
[1:18:33] didn't have any issues with girls I
[1:18:35] didn't have an issue with you know
[1:18:36] smoking I didn't have no issues with
[1:18:38] that but you know what the winter come
[1:18:40] to try out
[1:18:42] and check you out and if you don't if
[1:18:44] you're not strong you're going to fall
[1:18:45] for it
[1:18:46] right so I just said hey
[1:18:49] I saw this website wait a minute what's
[1:18:51] that
[1:18:53] so I read it
[1:18:55] if you read that with me I can
[1:18:56] completely read it for you you know she
[1:18:58] can't see what I'm talking about quickly
[1:18:59] so you can not grasp my experience I
[1:19:01] think I'll accept some time
[1:19:03] proverbs 20.
[1:19:13] it says one is a strong
[1:19:15] mocker wine is a marker strong thing is
[1:19:18] original whosoever is deceived thereby
[1:19:19] is not wise so I thought I was oh okay
[1:19:22] okay look maybe just as a regular
[1:19:25] and then someone's
[1:19:27] say I said go to Proverbs 23 remember I
[1:19:29] read the Bible
[1:19:30] I grew up in church I was active in
[1:19:32] church but that part I had no settling
[1:19:35] with God every part of your life has to
[1:19:38] be settled with God or else when the
[1:19:41] wind come it's gonna shake you
[1:19:43] Every Beat every corner of your heart
[1:19:45] every Darkness ever whatever you're
[1:19:47] dealing with habits if that's what to
[1:19:49] sell through with God I thought I said
[1:19:51] every part of my heart and my life but
[1:19:52] guess what that part is not settled
[1:19:54] because I didn't I didn't have an
[1:19:55] understanding of Revelation of what it
[1:19:56] is
[1:19:57] but you know what God had a reason for
[1:19:59] me to go through that
[1:20:00] so that I can explain himself to me so
[1:20:02] now you can't tell me about alcohols
[1:20:05] brother I met with God that's what I can
[1:20:07] say you go to go to go to your
[1:20:09] experience
[1:20:10] so I went to Proverbs 23 I was like
[1:20:14] I didn't really get it
[1:20:16] 23 and I went to verse
[1:20:19] he said he said specifically used to
[1:20:21] convert 28 so I started from 28. so she
[1:20:24] also she's talking about a you know a
[1:20:26] bad woman and everything and talking to
[1:20:27] father that Father tell me something to
[1:20:29] listen and not go to the the horror
[1:20:32] there and he was saying
[1:20:34] for your horse a deep ditch and a
[1:20:36] stranger man is in therapy
[1:20:38] so she also lied and with us for a
[1:20:40] prayer and increases the transgressors
[1:20:42] among men now verse 9 listen to me
[1:20:44] you've been if you haven't been the
[1:20:45] world don't go try I'm telling you but
[1:20:47] don't try it it's better not try but
[1:20:49] also I've been known to know what I'm
[1:20:50] talking about who had War who had Sowers
[1:20:52] Who had contentions who are bablens who
[1:20:55] had wound to that cause who are the
[1:20:57] redness of our eyes
[1:20:59] so now the word god themselves now
[1:21:01] explained himself to me
[1:21:03] what I had just my my experience
[1:21:07] because whoever that's why someone
[1:21:08] that's drinking
[1:21:11] he said did I tiring at the wine you say
[1:21:14] I just think a little bit a little bit
[1:21:16] from a little bit two percent seven it
[1:21:17] goes don't even don't start to try it
[1:21:19] because you keep going
[1:21:22] did I go to me seek mixed wine and that
[1:21:25] was what I was doing
[1:21:28] look not die upon the wine when it's red
[1:21:30] you want to give it this color in the
[1:21:31] cup when they move it is silver right
[1:21:33] at last it battle like a serpent and
[1:21:36] sting it like another
[1:21:38] and that's what it does you have an
[1:21:39] hangover next day Thine Eyes Shall
[1:21:41] Behold stranger let me tell you
[1:21:43] something those times when I got my when
[1:21:45] I when I was in that state
[1:21:47] you could see a woman I can dress a
[1:21:49] woman without her undressing herself you
[1:21:51] on another realm there's another Spirit
[1:21:53] on you
[1:21:54] at that point in time
[1:21:57] to dance that build stranger man to
[1:21:59] actually order a perverse and she just
[1:22:01] said use this stuff in your heart you
[1:22:02] you know it didn't stop there he said
[1:22:04] thou shall be as either lie down in the
[1:22:07] midst of the sea in other words you know
[1:22:09] taking it back and forth
[1:22:11] and or as either lighter on the top
[1:22:15] of the mass
[1:22:17] when you're drunk you feel like you're
[1:22:19] talking about that's why you meet people
[1:22:21] who are that drunk they feel like the
[1:22:22] everything
[1:22:24] but God could work my experience after a
[1:22:27] little after that I struggled a little
[1:22:28] bit with it but go to that desire was so
[1:22:30] much that when I walk around our core
[1:22:31] right now it smells like I want to puke
[1:22:35] you know what dude what God did God took
[1:22:38] that desire totally from even when I
[1:22:39] come to communion right now which I have
[1:22:41] to do but I believe in communion and
[1:22:42] what God I still
[1:22:45] like I don't want to do it because go to
[1:22:48] that desire out
[1:22:49] now if you have anything you're
[1:22:51] struggling with sister brother don't let
[1:22:54] it go away let's go take care of it
[1:22:55] because the winds will come and try out
[1:22:57] you go to school your friends don't tell
[1:22:59] you access dry things that they're gonna
[1:23:01] do nutrition things
[1:23:03] people are only going you you face your
[1:23:05] ass at the job
[1:23:07] the wind will come
[1:23:09] but when you have the right found the
[1:23:10] right foundation in Christ
[1:23:13] nothing will shake it
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:18] remember when it's an Agent of Change
[1:23:20] Reigns beat down flawed The Sweep of
[1:23:24] loose material because it's not
[1:23:26] solidified
[1:23:30] Vlogs take out loose material that can
[1:23:33] think materials they cannot stand the
[1:23:34] test of time
[1:23:38] when to wipe out anything in a way that
[1:23:40] has no roots no root in them
[1:23:43] they appear man destroy them so now if
[1:23:45] the foundation is shaking and losing
[1:23:47] what happens
[1:23:49] Matthew 7 if we lose
[1:23:53] that building is gone
[1:23:57] if you're shaky Sunday is gone
[1:24:00] it's gonna destroy
[1:24:03] if the foundation is solid
[1:24:08] in geology when they say a rock
[1:24:11] Iraq is not just what you see out there
[1:24:14] that's like one one over a hundred
[1:24:18] of four direct release if they dig
[1:24:20] through that's why if they escaping for
[1:24:22] granted that is for countertops and
[1:24:24] everything like Granite yourself
[1:24:25] so uh an ignorance work if you're really
[1:24:28] looking for on a rock like that didn't
[1:24:31] look at what's on top they have to do a
[1:24:32] survey to tell you what's on the bottom
[1:24:34] because the bottom is way I mean the
[1:24:37] size amount of it's way more that was on
[1:24:40] the top
[1:24:41] so when the rock is coming when the wind
[1:24:43] is coming you know to shake your life
[1:24:45] you're not establishing some shaky
[1:24:47] material or something that's not really
[1:24:48] really stable you have a basis
[1:24:52] aim I don't even understand I'm saying
[1:24:54] it's money you have a basis there's a
[1:24:56] there's a basis that's stronger than
[1:24:58] what's on the top and then you cannot be
[1:25:00] moved said Jesus my Savior I cannot be
[1:25:03] moved so on Christ the solidwork I Stand
[1:25:06] All on the ground so wherever you put
[1:25:08] your trust in or you put your
[1:25:10] foundations in or put your building in
[1:25:12] if it's not in Christ it's gonna fall
[1:25:15] if it's based on organization you know
[1:25:17] right and generation students based on
[1:25:19] some good services and great music yeah
[1:25:22] I love great music don't don't get me
[1:25:23] wrong
[1:25:24] but that's not what salvation has built
[1:25:27] that's one of the true foundations is
[1:25:30] built on Christ the world
[1:25:32] when Jesus asked Peter and said who did
[1:25:34] people say I am I said you know someone
[1:25:36] said your your journey of this and that
[1:25:38] but you what do you say I am I God
[1:25:41] remember he said they said you're Christ
[1:25:45] I said Flesh and Blood have not given
[1:25:47] you this relation
[1:25:50] my father's name was Upon This Rock
[1:25:54] I will be in my church upon this
[1:25:56] Foundation I'll beat my church
[1:25:59] the church is not the way we are right
[1:26:01] now it's you
[1:26:03] if God's gonna build it's gonna be on
[1:26:04] that Foundation
[1:26:05] that's some Foundation
[1:26:07] amen
[1:26:09] I'm getting there
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:15] thank you
[1:26:18] now
[1:26:19] remember we talked about the solar
[1:26:21] Foundation now there's a part of
[1:26:22] development and I was looking at the
[1:26:23] word development I was checking you know
[1:26:25] right there
[1:26:26] what development means let's check the
[1:26:28] same web solution I already said to
[1:26:30] uncover to unfold nine years table
[1:26:34] nothing can move you know more you're
[1:26:35] about your own experience now you want
[1:26:37] to unfold
[1:26:39] you want to show manifest the gene of
[1:26:42] who made you where it came from your
[1:26:43] source
[1:26:45] it says the word develop it's a verb so
[1:26:47] the word development growth they're
[1:26:48] about they're about the same you can use
[1:26:50] them in interchangeably but they mean
[1:26:53] different things
[1:26:58] he talks about uncovering and unraveling
[1:27:03] the word growth means change
[1:27:07] from one state to another and that's
[1:27:09] what that's I'll call it transformation
[1:27:12] amen World developments on cover to
[1:27:15] unfold to lay open
[1:27:19] to receive to disclose or make something
[1:27:23] known
[1:27:24] something that's been concealed
[1:27:26] or without some notice to unravel
[1:27:29] to free you from complication or
[1:27:32] confusion
[1:27:34] to unfold what is intricate
[1:27:37] or to develop a plan doesn't God have a
[1:27:39] plan for
[1:27:42] a plan even before the old Waters made
[1:27:44] the other plan
[1:27:46] they wanted to make man his own image
[1:27:48] now when I say the word image but Obama
[1:27:50] was saying in on in Genesis chapter 1
[1:27:52] chapter 2 was the barometer started
[1:27:54] referring to that that image is now the
[1:27:56] flesh that we have right now because the
[1:27:58] image that we are right now is the image
[1:28:00] of an animal the Beast and that's why a
[1:28:02] man doesn't have Holy Ghost
[1:28:04] will always act like a beast
[1:28:06] because it's made that image this is the
[1:28:09] image of it but when they say I want to
[1:28:10] be a man in my own image it's not an
[1:28:12] image that we're looking around it's a
[1:28:13] spirit image
[1:28:14] the spirit of what he wanted to make him
[1:28:16] ask God and the Bible said God is spirit
[1:28:18] and everybody that worship everyone I
[1:28:20] worship your worship Us in what in
[1:28:22] spirit and in truth
[1:28:25] so go to the plan to develop a purpose a
[1:28:29] plan in an orderly fashion
[1:28:32] and God oh my God God is the only one
[1:28:36] that does things in order
[1:28:39] so now if the Earth is coming saying you
[1:28:41] know there's no God how do you wake up
[1:28:43] in the morning and the Sun is just
[1:28:44] Rising coming from the from the ears how
[1:28:46] do you wake up order
[1:28:48] I didn't wake up in the morning and
[1:28:50] Justice movement the sun is moving and
[1:28:51] then you know
[1:28:52] just getting bright and just moving from
[1:28:54] the West
[1:28:56] and then at night the stars are in their
[1:28:58] places no one falls out
[1:29:01] and when I was dating my wife you know
[1:29:03] the day I posed the question to her
[1:29:04] we're watching Stars I remember that and
[1:29:07] it was in the same Stars I was in Africa
[1:29:08] I was just you know chilling at home and
[1:29:10] then I was looking I said oh do you see
[1:29:12] those star and we're walking watching
[1:29:14] the the
[1:29:16] constellation of stars are the birth and
[1:29:19] she could see everything and everything
[1:29:20] I saw she saw and someone said this is
[1:29:23] your time to tell her what you're
[1:29:24] thinking about tell her right now I say
[1:29:26] hey girls
[1:29:27] I like you and I think I want a good
[1:29:29] father
[1:29:31] but what am I talking about God is a god
[1:29:33] of plan and Order
[1:29:35] and as God's people it's purpose is to
[1:29:40] unravel you
[1:29:42] now that you have saved your your life
[1:29:44] has changed you're growing on him he
[1:29:46] wants to unravel it wants to be that
[1:29:48] building on that Foundation
[1:29:50] to resemble him to look like him
[1:29:54] and the scriptures this you know how is
[1:29:56] that done by the word of God the
[1:29:58] scriptures are very Christ
[1:30:00] the word by inspiration by Revelation to
[1:30:03] is bright
[1:30:05] because the Bride is a gene of Christ
[1:30:07] and her to burn our bill first before
[1:30:10] you are we have to know
[1:30:12] who's unreability
[1:30:14] who's doing that Christ
[1:30:16] if you don't know Christ you can't Know
[1:30:18] Who You Are
[1:30:20] there's a teaching I I was I was setting
[1:30:22] up that I was planning to take Sunday
[1:30:23] school maybe sometimes about who God who
[1:30:25] is God who God is
[1:30:27] but the purpose that the reason why
[1:30:29] we're trying to know who God is because
[1:30:30] the more inside tries to know who God is
[1:30:32] you got to know who you really are
[1:30:34] you getting through your capacity your
[1:30:36] power
[1:30:41] like I said earlier the word guard means
[1:30:43] to know the change and increase
[1:30:45] we'll look at this word develop
[1:30:48] I say you know go further
[1:30:52] have you ever wondered that growth
[1:30:54] occurs in Dark Places
[1:30:57] in seclusions
[1:30:59] it's not where there is noise
[1:31:04] things grow our fingers grow when we
[1:31:06] didn't know when you're sleeping you
[1:31:08] know your next time my nails are growing
[1:31:10] it's not on the noise
[1:31:14] so if you don't grow in Christ you got
[1:31:16] to be with him hidden with him alone
[1:31:19] with him
[1:31:20] very very important
[1:31:22] you got to know who you are it's I know
[1:31:25] I believed I'm not I'm persuaded
[1:31:30] so you just not it's not like you you
[1:31:32] hear about somebody or from a distance
[1:31:33] you know him in the power of his
[1:31:36] resurrection
[1:31:37] you know who God is if you don't know
[1:31:39] where you are just try to know who God
[1:31:41] is God's going to reveal who you are to
[1:31:43] you and it's going to reveal the purpose
[1:31:46] that he made you because you have a
[1:31:48] purpose one day the driver at my job was
[1:31:49] just talking to me said Michael you know
[1:31:51] I've been wondering these guys okay by
[1:31:54] the way our drivers make over they make
[1:31:56] six figures give me good money
[1:31:58] because you know it's the hazard on the
[1:32:00] ruin everything you know
[1:32:02] you know you care if I have good
[1:32:03] insurance and everything what's tell him
[1:32:04] he said my God make all this good money
[1:32:06] yeah these guys different cars it brings
[1:32:07] to work he's just doing very well said
[1:32:10] you know what's the essence of living
[1:32:14] I also lived in and finally I get all
[1:32:16] the money I want I have the car one that
[1:32:18] family and that's it
[1:32:20] I'm not trying to talk to you anymore
[1:32:22] but I told them I said there's more to
[1:32:23] it
[1:32:25] there's more to life more than just
[1:32:26] having a big fat account and having a
[1:32:28] career don't just kill being a family
[1:32:30] there's more to it God has the purpose
[1:32:32] of me and you everybody here
[1:32:35] but you cannot know his purpose if you
[1:32:38] don't stay alone with him you know we're
[1:32:40] alone in the garden with him
[1:32:42] spending time with him
[1:32:44] because in the at that point when you
[1:32:46] were in that like I said girl doesn't
[1:32:48] happen and the noise it happens in in
[1:32:50] the quiet
[1:32:52] when you when you were with him always
[1:32:54] you know pointing your heart to him
[1:32:56] telling him no God I'm not this part of
[1:32:59] my life is not it's not still good I'm
[1:33:01] struggling here I'm struggling here he
[1:33:03] knows what's best
[1:33:06] why are you doing that what are you
[1:33:07] doing just developing
[1:33:09] because you have the Jinn of Christ in
[1:33:11] you slow developing
[1:33:13] just having faith and believing God's
[1:33:14] word because I'm gonna tell you this if
[1:33:16] you do not have faith and believe God's
[1:33:17] word right now you will not have faith
[1:33:19] to believe in rapturing the rapture
[1:33:22] you'll never have afternoon Faith
[1:33:23] because what God is doing is slowly
[1:33:25] building your faith
[1:33:27] the monster of your faith slowly until
[1:33:29] you get to a point where you can just
[1:33:32] believe anything that God say well God
[1:33:34] tells you what I believe even though
[1:33:36] even if I don't understand I one day
[1:33:38] you'd be transformed that's what
[1:33:40] happened to Enoch
[1:33:41] the Bible says Enoch walked with God
[1:33:44] until it was found not
[1:33:50] I bet that work was some some so much so
[1:33:53] much
[1:33:56] come on
[1:33:57] I feel good about this
[1:34:00] that if I can walk with God I'll get the
[1:34:02] point that I'm found now
[1:34:03] and I've noticed
[1:34:06] this video that I really know I have
[1:34:07] vaccination with and after their life
[1:34:09] gets so much better and they've walked
[1:34:11] us so much and it just passed onto the
[1:34:13] other side
[1:34:15] because if you're a child of a
[1:34:16] government take you until you're ready
[1:34:18] um but Robin said
[1:34:20] the reason why the Raptor is not taking
[1:34:21] place is because one of the last select
[1:34:24] is not any India it's not at that point
[1:34:27] to be after when it gets there God will
[1:34:30] take all his children
[1:34:32] so because at that point you you when
[1:34:34] you're on revealed you are able to
[1:34:36] crisis the journey you have developed
[1:34:39] you're not fit for this world no more
[1:34:42] the world cannot take you no more then
[1:34:43] what happens God takes the other side
[1:34:45] that's what you feed for
[1:34:48] and that's you know and this development
[1:34:50] does not just happen only
[1:34:53] by Walking with God also it's also also
[1:34:55] no no it comes by also following his
[1:34:59] first his percept
[1:35:02] one of the things is not focus forsake
[1:35:04] that assembly of the Saints doesn't
[1:35:05] matter
[1:35:06] because when we come and come here what
[1:35:08] we're doing is the word of God shaping
[1:35:10] us
[1:35:11] and then go back and you meditate on
[1:35:13] those things and listen you you do your
[1:35:15] personal right now how much is good but
[1:35:16] also this must come together and we say
[1:35:20] we're two or three I got it in my name
[1:35:21] and said yes I've been there amazing so
[1:35:22] that's the purpose for always Gathering
[1:35:24] and God has a function for the powerful
[1:35:26] that I'm going to handle that part
[1:35:35] and
[1:35:37] when we come to the house of the Lord
[1:35:39] we're coming to purge ourselves
[1:35:42] to cleanse ourselves
[1:35:44] that's how I want to come here sometimes
[1:35:46] the pastor the picture hates you hard
[1:35:47] we're not here to play we're here to
[1:35:50] submit ourselves and say Lord this is
[1:35:52] what I have
[1:35:53] you might understand why it might be
[1:35:55] harsh on you but if you just submit to
[1:35:56] it God was going to make a difference in
[1:35:58] your life
[1:36:01] and I remember I was talking to a friend
[1:36:03] about this and it was saying oh you know
[1:36:04] I'm gonna
[1:36:09] I'm gonna he told me I was in Florida
[1:36:10] and said I need a sister I want to get
[1:36:12] married
[1:36:13] I did not reply
[1:36:15] you know I didn't apply if it doesn't
[1:36:17] have a leadership
[1:36:19] you would never be able to rule his home
[1:36:21] right
[1:36:23] sisters don't marry a man who can't
[1:36:25] listen to his pastor
[1:36:29] and I've noticed so much over time and
[1:36:31] just I've been I've been with my dad in
[1:36:33] the ministry of no activists when I was
[1:36:36] I think six or seven up to like nine
[1:36:38] years so I've been actually I've seen
[1:36:40] this cycle when men or young woman wants
[1:36:42] to get married to a point that's what it
[1:36:44] come on really
[1:36:46] the pastor that means they cannot tell
[1:36:48] you what to do no more you feel like
[1:36:50] you're doing trying to to the BET to do
[1:36:52] the best but God explains this man in
[1:36:54] charge to watch it by your soul
[1:36:57] sister's like hey don't marry a man that
[1:36:59] would not fall asleep Amanda I'm not
[1:37:01] respect his parents don't get a marriage
[1:37:02] your man don't respect his Pastor let's
[1:37:04] jump from one place the other a man
[1:37:06] doesn't believe to come to the church
[1:37:07] I'll be like you know I can read bible
[1:37:08] message in the house and just stay it's
[1:37:10] good but God the everything has a
[1:37:12] purpose
[1:37:13] and that's why God gave me five foot I'm
[1:37:15] getting there I'm gonna just pinpoint it
[1:37:17] and I'll I'll be done are we enjoying
[1:37:19] this everybody
[1:37:22] the function of Pi fold is is big
[1:37:27] God's on the prophet yes to throw us
[1:37:29] back to the you know Apostolic fathers
[1:37:32] back to the book of Acts because the
[1:37:34] book of Acts is done in where it was it
[1:37:36] ended we are the Continental book of
[1:37:38] Acts the prophet said so everything that
[1:37:40] was done book of Acts as to be
[1:37:41] manifested and asked you
[1:37:43] but guess what after the prophet left
[1:37:45] the word the food remember we're talking
[1:37:47] about the word foundation
[1:37:49] um uh uh uh um the word the word I was
[1:37:52] talking about earlier about nurture it
[1:37:54] means to feed so now the word has been
[1:37:57] stored now
[1:37:58] now the fight will come to take that
[1:38:01] word
[1:38:02] and feel what do it feed the bread with
[1:38:04] it
[1:38:06] as they feed the bread with you you are
[1:38:08] Dawning or you're dressing I remember
[1:38:09] Esther
[1:38:11] when Esther was you know to be to go
[1:38:13] when that she didn't behave right and
[1:38:15] kicked her out and as I was there Esther
[1:38:17] listening to the chief dresser
[1:38:21] because she he knows exactly what the
[1:38:24] king likes what color is the love what
[1:38:27] kind of flowers he like I love the woman
[1:38:29] to look I love the hair to look like and
[1:38:31] that's what the five-fold is doing to
[1:38:33] the bride
[1:38:36] now that house is built up now it has to
[1:38:39] grow that's a develop the power forward
[1:38:42] as a function on that part now a lot of
[1:38:44] people say oh you know what I can listen
[1:38:47] to the tapes
[1:38:48] he said that but that's not what it
[1:38:50] really means
[1:38:51] it says say what a tape says
[1:38:55] he said just what I mean just whatever
[1:38:57] the word says don't mix it up don't give
[1:38:59] your interpretation this is what it
[1:39:01] means just say it leave it like that
[1:39:02] that's what that means
[1:39:05] the five foot as a function and I'll
[1:39:06] read that scripture and then I'll round
[1:39:08] up and I'll be out of here the password
[1:39:10] as a function to dress to Bright Now to
[1:39:12] take that word
[1:39:14] that's been stored
[1:39:16] and they bring it by their gift God can
[1:39:19] give an ability to discern what the need
[1:39:21] is in the church what you did what I
[1:39:23] need the times I come here and something
[1:39:25] that's just going to my mind I'm just so
[1:39:27] but I'm walking here and the brother
[1:39:28] Paul is preaching exactly what I'm
[1:39:30] thinking about he doesn't even know me
[1:39:33] okay let's say I said you know what why
[1:39:35] is he put a PAW Patrol about me doesn't
[1:39:37] even know about me or is he you know
[1:39:39] checking about me no he's not it's the
[1:39:40] gift in that man's life that's takes in
[1:39:42] that word that's you know that word has
[1:39:43] been stored and applying to the need of
[1:39:45] your life
[1:39:46] that's the only way you can grow
[1:39:51] the five foot has five parts I'm gonna
[1:39:54] read that scripture quickly and then I
[1:39:55] will
[1:39:57] I would um stop right there
[1:40:23] I think it's a bit of efficiency I
[1:40:24] remember hours so I'm sure it's there in
[1:40:26] the book of Ephesians
[1:40:30] evidence four yet thank you
[1:40:32] I heard this sometimes you get here and
[1:40:33] just lost it lost your thought
[1:40:36] please bear with me if you don't support
[1:40:41] and then um Paul was talking here about
[1:40:44] one load on faith on baptism was no just
[1:40:46] talking about The Walking service I
[1:40:47] believe her
[1:40:48] and having as having the spirit and he
[1:40:50] went down and started talking let's talk
[1:40:52] about when G when Jesus left verse seven
[1:40:55] he said but unto everyone is given Grace
[1:40:58] according to measure of the gift of
[1:41:01] Christ talking about the ministering
[1:41:02] gifts now now talking about remember
[1:41:04] we're talking about don't forget our
[1:41:06] line of thought solid foundation
[1:41:09] development growth
[1:41:12] don't forget that
[1:41:14] until every month by seven again born to
[1:41:16] every one of us is giving Grace
[1:41:17] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:41:19] Christ verse 8 wherefore he said when
[1:41:21] yes
[1:41:22] LED captivity captive remember Jesus
[1:41:25] came from hell like Abraham Lincoln he
[1:41:27] left the cross went to hell took the
[1:41:30] keys up here Griffin L and came back to
[1:41:33] Earth
[1:41:34] when it came back to Earth all the
[1:41:35] saints there were an Old Testament they
[1:41:37] were they were in hates then the Ramos
[1:41:39] became example of that aids which is
[1:41:41] also called um
[1:41:43] Paradise we're taken out of there and
[1:41:46] the Bible said that they could see the
[1:41:48] graveyards the grave of sepulchers of
[1:41:51] old saints that died opened up so when
[1:41:54] when what happened was that Jesus had
[1:41:56] taken that key
[1:41:58] from the Devil
[1:42:00] and he led those who are you know those
[1:42:03] who were captive he together it took it
[1:42:05] took it took care of the Captivity
[1:42:07] and they said he gave gift unto man
[1:42:11] excuse me no I'm sorry it's an electably
[1:42:13] captive and gave gift unto man now verse
[1:42:16] 9 thou he has sent now he ascended
[1:42:19] what is it that he also descended first
[1:42:21] into the lower parts of the earth what I
[1:42:23] was saying earlier and either at the
[1:42:24] center is the same also that's an all
[1:42:26] far above all levels that might feel all
[1:42:28] things not verse 11. and he gave some
[1:42:31] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:42:35] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:42:38] teachers
[1:42:44] they're five five they're fivefold like
[1:42:47] I said they dare to feed the bread not
[1:42:49] to the bride to perfection
[1:42:51] you have a teacher
[1:42:53] if you don't know what a teacher is you
[1:42:54] look at brother rap
[1:42:56] am I right
[1:42:58] because they see the gift of God and
[1:42:59] slightness that God bless you brother
[1:43:01] rap
[1:43:02] a teacher comes and takes the word
[1:43:05] takes a message
[1:43:06] balance it out
[1:43:08] that even a baby can understand it
[1:43:10] and that's why when we went to the um a
[1:43:12] winter YouTube treat that because I had
[1:43:14] my friends the girl that took picture
[1:43:15] with you is my wife's friend
[1:43:17] um uh what's her name again
[1:43:19] loon
[1:43:22] he was able to come to the level of
[1:43:24] young people
[1:43:26] and let them understand what the message
[1:43:28] is and the Bible and you tie them
[1:43:29] together
[1:43:31] that they can understand it
[1:43:33] that's what the teacher does
[1:43:35] what does an apostle do
[1:43:37] an about an apostle builds
[1:43:40] he goes to places that has been broken
[1:43:42] and there's not follow ground there's
[1:43:43] nothing in there or people are having
[1:43:44] issues I'm buying them together
[1:43:48] when it's done it was another place keep
[1:43:50] going
[1:43:51] and that's what Paula apostle was that
[1:43:53] Paul the Apostle was a prophet and an
[1:43:54] apostle at the same time yeah it was a
[1:43:57] major prophet I also the spirit of the
[1:43:59] the gift of an apostle sometimes God
[1:44:01] gave a man multiple it gives a man but
[1:44:04] I'll explain that as I go before we know
[1:44:06] round off now
[1:44:09] after the teacher about teacher about
[1:44:10] the apostle
[1:44:13] an evangelist
[1:44:14] I'll talk about let me talk about the uh
[1:44:16] the prophet the father of Heaven is now
[1:44:18] the two kind of prophets the major
[1:44:20] prophet and the minor prophet
[1:44:22] the Major Prophets of look at the Bible
[1:44:23] are the ones that God speak to per age
[1:44:27] per time they're not they're not like
[1:44:30] they might altered by my brother but the
[1:44:31] Major Prophets are the ones like Elijah
[1:44:33] like Moses
[1:44:35] he sent them for a reason
[1:44:37] to his people
[1:44:39] just like Major Prophets and dear Bible
[1:44:41] said they are seers
[1:44:44] immediate Professor this year
[1:44:48] and basically it Sears one that sees
[1:44:50] that ahead of time
[1:44:52] he knows exactly it's not exactly what's
[1:44:54] going on and God is showing him what's
[1:44:57] going to happen
[1:44:58] over time like like in the future and
[1:45:01] like John John of government relations
[1:45:02] saw our time at some time because it was
[1:45:05] a major prophet
[1:45:07] and they can tell you God has given
[1:45:08] ability to even discern what your
[1:45:10] thinking was in your heart what and
[1:45:11] that's that but the problem is also the
[1:45:13] same one a major prophet now there are
[1:45:16] Minor Prophets who can be multiple at
[1:45:18] the same time they are in the church
[1:45:19] remember all those four have a father
[1:45:24] and their father is a pastor
[1:45:27] does it mean that the pastor is greater
[1:45:28] than them no it's not greater than them
[1:45:29] it's just your father the position that
[1:45:30] he is and they have to submit to a
[1:45:33] pastor to lead them
[1:45:36] now the Minor Prophets have the gifts of
[1:45:38] Prophecy
[1:45:39] sometimes that's speaking in tongues
[1:45:42] they can
[1:45:43] sometimes they even have dreams of
[1:45:45] things that are compressing I've got
[1:45:46] people in a church WIll you know who are
[1:45:48] gifted like that we'll go show things
[1:45:50] that happen in church
[1:45:53] those gifts are good but
[1:45:55] we're not led by it by the gifts
[1:45:58] we're led by the word those gifts are
[1:46:00] there to just put the church in order
[1:46:03] now in the world I mean I mean out there
[1:46:06] in no dominations they use that to lead
[1:46:08] ahead of the word to put the word on the
[1:46:10] side and use the gift to lead the people
[1:46:12] and sometimes those gifts who are not
[1:46:14] all right
[1:46:15] now the scripture says when a prophet or
[1:46:18] those Paul was saying one day it's
[1:46:19] supposed to come together this word
[1:46:21] demanding purpose and they say something
[1:46:22] and doesn't come to pass
[1:46:24] that's come to the altar
[1:46:28] because if God didn't say and you say
[1:46:30] God said there's trouble
[1:46:32] so their function is they they have the
[1:46:35] gift to prophesy in the life of people
[1:46:36] and also the gifted with all those gifts
[1:46:39] I just mentioned now the evangelist is
[1:46:41] category it comes and scatters
[1:46:42] everything
[1:46:44] here it doesn't care how your face looks
[1:46:46] whether you're nice or your dress good
[1:46:48] whatever girl puts it doesn't it just
[1:46:50] says it
[1:46:51] all the job the pastor pastors the sheep
[1:46:55] and everything it comes in just
[1:46:58] sometimes upside down
[1:47:00] like with a Cadre
[1:47:02] they don't care how you look they just
[1:47:04] tell you exactly blue black this is what
[1:47:06] it is and that's if they walk away they
[1:47:08] never care how you feel after they walk
[1:47:09] away
[1:47:10] but you know what that's the work of an
[1:47:12] evangelist it's supposed to bring you to
[1:47:13] repentance like to call Sin Sin cosplay
[1:47:17] their Spade
[1:47:19] and walk away
[1:47:21] now I come to pass I love I don't like
[1:47:24] you know being a pastor's kid but I love
[1:47:26] pastors
[1:47:29] a lot I know I'm talking about my dad
[1:47:31] had sacrificed my stipend going to
[1:47:34] college one time because his sister came
[1:47:35] to the house and asked some money
[1:47:37] and took me with the next day and give
[1:47:38] money to the sister
[1:47:39] I didn't like it
[1:47:41] but that's what that's what it takes so
[1:47:42] but I love the Pastoral Ministry because
[1:47:45] he just explains who Christ is
[1:47:47] I I read something I don't have it here
[1:47:50] but the word pessimist appointment I
[1:47:52] think Latin or Greek I'm not sure I'm
[1:47:54] not sure but he talks about being a
[1:47:57] shepherd
[1:47:58] and if you want to see if a troop has to
[1:48:01] look at the Life of Christ I love the
[1:48:02] pastor I bet you we have one here but
[1:48:05] Apollo has been a great Pastor I'm going
[1:48:07] to turn this church to Greatness to
[1:48:09] profession sin that would grow not about
[1:48:12] growing anything else yeah we're growing
[1:48:13] every other part but growing mostly
[1:48:15] mostly in the spiritual part
[1:48:18] the function of the past is when the
[1:48:19] balance has gone everybody has gone he
[1:48:22] brings everything together
[1:48:25] he didn't mean that we was just trying
[1:48:26] to you know
[1:48:28] it makes it sound good he said no this
[1:48:31] is what it meant that's what it meant oh
[1:48:32] you got a broken leg okay I'm on the
[1:48:34] nurse it
[1:48:38] that caused
[1:48:41] yeah it does
[1:48:43] ask for the pop
[1:48:45] and the party it tells you said they
[1:48:47] pass us a boarding bear
[1:48:49] they have so much burden that it just
[1:48:51] borders them and when they say a man
[1:48:54] that's like that it shows the gift that
[1:48:56] is in his life
[1:48:57] so I'll say Pastor here sometimes he
[1:48:59] just has to burden for the people it's
[1:49:01] not him it's a gift in him
[1:49:11] but all these five five on the functions
[1:49:14] are there
[1:49:16] to dress to Bright
[1:49:20] Crisis coming one day people don't even
[1:49:22] talk about it about it no more people
[1:49:24] don't think about you know Jesus come
[1:49:25] back no more this new songs that I hear
[1:49:27] the very few of them talk about Jesus
[1:49:29] coming no more because now it's telling
[1:49:31] some people I tell you the Lord is
[1:49:33] coming one day
[1:49:35] I don't give a kind of all the times
[1:49:36] that we have on her that's given us to
[1:49:39] him
[1:49:40] if you're not ready
[1:49:44] it's in your hands
[1:49:47] but these five
[1:49:49] four that there the Bible said for sure
[1:49:52] for the Perfection of the Saints
[1:49:55] for the work of the ministry
[1:49:58] for they are defined of the body of
[1:50:00] Christ
[1:50:01] two
[1:50:03] it's a class there two we all come in
[1:50:07] the unity of the faith so if they're
[1:50:08] still rank or on different things just
[1:50:10] going back and forth and you know this
[1:50:12] will not believe this one or you can
[1:50:13] play drums or you cannot play drums oh I
[1:50:16] don't like trumpets you like trumpet oh
[1:50:17] I don't like this but a person is too
[1:50:19] many songs there'll be different parts
[1:50:20] around but guess what
[1:50:22] this five-fold is the tool that God is
[1:50:26] going to use to unite the bride together
[1:50:28] because if you know United Christ is not
[1:50:30] coming
[1:50:33] to walk Harmony into our faith
[1:50:36] and listen of the knowledge of the son
[1:50:39] of God
[1:50:40] knowing who God is onto a perfect man I
[1:50:44] remember to bring it to that that sort
[1:50:46] of statutory old church remember I
[1:50:48] really enjoyed that on to a perfect man
[1:50:50] onto the measure of this stature listen
[1:50:54] of the fullness of Christ
[1:50:57] not halfway
[1:50:59] not a quarter fullness
[1:51:05] listen now now we'll talk about growth
[1:51:07] right that we asked for it be no more
[1:51:10] children
[1:51:12] toast for toe and fro and carried away
[1:51:16] with every wind of Doctrine
[1:51:19] we're now on a strong Foundation solid
[1:51:22] foundation on Christ the solid rock the
[1:51:24] acid no no no if a gigantic kind of no
[1:51:28] no no no no no no rock where we're not
[1:51:31] moving about induction when the doctor
[1:51:32] when abduction comes around because this
[1:51:34] Firefall they teach you
[1:51:36] you remember in in Matthew 7 is that the
[1:51:39] people were astonished at his Doctrine
[1:51:41] the teaching
[1:51:43] this life will bring that teaching of
[1:51:44] Christ
[1:51:45] they established them where nothing I'm
[1:51:48] moving no more
[1:51:51] that we answered me no more children
[1:51:53] toes to and fro
[1:51:56] and carried about with everyone of
[1:51:58] Doctrine by the slave of man because man
[1:52:01] I'm telling even in the mess you're
[1:52:02] going to see ministers who are not of
[1:52:04] God don't be shocked
[1:52:07] because the Bible is going to have false
[1:52:09] prophets
[1:52:10] false preachers
[1:52:13] excuse me
[1:52:17] slay of men communists
[1:52:20] and cunning craftiness
[1:52:22] they can have some some license about
[1:52:25] them that
[1:52:26] if it feels good it looks good
[1:52:28] but what is the fruit that comes with it
[1:52:31] be careful when I look at the Minnesota
[1:52:33] three things I look for when I look at
[1:52:34] Minister I'm just being honest with you
[1:52:35] I know when I meet that Minister I'm
[1:52:37] shipping with you judge me too but when
[1:52:40] I see a minister the third thing I'm
[1:52:41] looking for
[1:52:42] I look at the Life of Christ number one
[1:52:45] simplicity
[1:52:48] number two
[1:52:51] what is their goal what are they trying
[1:52:54] to express trying to predict himself by
[1:52:55] their protect Christ number three are
[1:52:58] they accessible can anybody assess them
[1:53:00] like enrich them like oh no you can
[1:53:02] denominations to be a bishop you have to
[1:53:05] become
[1:53:07] it makes it difficult to even talk to
[1:53:09] the man like like a demigod like
[1:53:11] remember
[1:53:12] um in the seven churches the spirit of
[1:53:14] nicolitan where they just want a lot of
[1:53:17] other people but when I say Truman aside
[1:53:19] look at the Life of Christ and look at
[1:53:20] oh no this is this is not a
[1:53:23] so there'll be men like that
[1:53:27] so watch out not every minute status of
[1:53:29] God
[1:53:30] but the right ones will be there to
[1:53:32] perfect the bride that's a joke
[1:53:35] by the slave of men and cunning Crafters
[1:53:38] who whereby they laying with to deceive
[1:53:41] note their aim like I said what is their
[1:53:45] goal
[1:53:46] they want to be known
[1:53:47] do I want to be prominent do whatever to
[1:53:50] know them they want to be fired for them
[1:53:51] to be in every church I'm preaching
[1:53:52] everywhere
[1:53:53] is that the aim or is or is there m
[1:53:56] is the aim to perfect the Church of
[1:53:58] Christ to make sure that our lives are
[1:54:00] better
[1:54:01] is that is that the aim if that's not
[1:54:03] their aim that they're not of God
[1:54:05] because everything that was on Earth
[1:54:07] right now has one purpose one purpose
[1:54:10] to glorify God
[1:54:12] he doesn't glorify God it's not of God
[1:54:15] and guess what where did that Source
[1:54:18] came from that commonness and trying to
[1:54:20] glorified itself came from the Devil
[1:54:22] so when you see that spirit is coming
[1:54:25] straight on the bottom from the Pizza
[1:54:27] Bell an anointing man
[1:54:30] and they they deceived the Bible guess
[1:54:32] what Jesus said you know he said if it's
[1:54:35] just possible they'd like to be disabled
[1:54:37] you know what they will never be
[1:54:38] deceived because they are of God you can
[1:54:40] take them with a little Doctrine or
[1:54:43] teaching for a little bit
[1:54:44] just a matter of time give them time
[1:54:46] that that man is a child of God inside
[1:54:48] of God
[1:54:49] God will break them free from those
[1:54:51] bondages
[1:54:52] false doctrines and guess what I'll send
[1:54:55] them to school what Paul's Doctrine does
[1:54:56] it builds up
[1:54:58] hypocrisy
[1:55:00] fakeness
[1:55:02] and guess guess who suffer the Next
[1:55:04] Generation
[1:55:05] that's why solid teaching is very
[1:55:07] important because when you're passing
[1:55:09] the generation is still solid but when
[1:55:12] it's no fake and it's not it's not it's
[1:55:15] not based on God's word
[1:55:17] it produces a bunch of fake hypocrisy
[1:55:20] called generation next next to next to
[1:55:22] that generation
[1:55:23] that's what happens
[1:55:29] but speaking the truth in love this
[1:55:31] minister is going to tell you the truth
[1:55:33] because it's not their word they're
[1:55:34] taking what God it's not even them
[1:55:36] they're just a mouthpiece that's what a
[1:55:38] minister stands for a mouthpiece
[1:55:40] speak the truth in love
[1:55:43] they may grow up and grow up unto him
[1:55:46] and all things which is head
[1:55:48] even Christ
[1:55:50] from whom the whole body fatally joined
[1:55:52] together
[1:55:53] and compacted by
[1:55:56] that every joint supplied according to
[1:55:59] the factual working in the measure of
[1:56:02] every part making increase of the body
[1:56:05] until it defining of itself in love
[1:56:11] thank you Brian
[1:56:15] so the path would have a purpose
[1:56:18] and that proposes what I read
[1:56:21] and I pray my I have on prayer this
[1:56:23] morning my prayers that God would just
[1:56:24] help everybody
[1:56:27] to have a strong Foundation
[1:56:29] in Christ and I have every parent to
[1:56:32] instill that foundation with the young
[1:56:33] being their kids
[1:56:35] and every young person to realize come
[1:56:37] to a realization of who they really are
[1:56:39] and summon themselves to Christ
[1:56:42] because when they submit themselves man
[1:56:45] you can do exploits the Bible said
[1:56:49] hey man let's buy it
[1:56:54] as the mission has come
[1:57:02] on crisis
