[0:27] [Music]
[0:33] There's torn up pes in this book. Words
[0:37] that tell me I'm no good. Chapters that
[0:42] defined me for so long.
[0:47] But the hands of grace and endless love
[0:51] dusted off and picked me up. told my
[0:56] heart that hope is never gone.
[1:00] God is in this story.
[1:04] God is in the details.
[1:08] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[1:12] heart. He never fails. When I'm at my
[1:16] weakest,
[1:18] I will trust in Jesus.
[1:22] Always in the highs and lows. The one
[1:26] who goes before me.
[1:29] God is in this story.
[1:38] So if the storm you're walking through
[1:42] feels like it's too much, you wonder if
[1:47] he even cares at all.
[1:52] Well, hold on tight to what you know.
[1:56] He's promised he won't let you go. Your
[1:59] song of feelings written in his scars.
[2:05] God is in this story.
[2:09] God is in the details.
[2:12] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[2:17] heart. He never fails. When I'm at my
[2:21] weakest,
[2:23] I will trust in Jesus.
[2:27] Always in the highest, the one who rose
[2:32] before me.
[2:34] God is in this story.
[2:38] And if it like addiction, if it like
[2:45] disease, he's the one who frees the
[2:48] prisoner. He's the healer of all things.
[2:53] And if it
[2:55] like depression, if it broken home, he's
[3:01] the one who holds your sorrow. He won't
[3:05] leave you here alone. Oh,
[3:10] God is in this story.
[3:14] God is in the details.
[3:18] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[3:22] heart. He never fails. When I have my
[3:26] weakest,
[3:29] I will trust in Jesus
[3:32] always in the high and lows. The one who
[3:36] goes before me.
[3:39] God is in their story.
[3:43] [Music]
[3:44] Oh,
[3:47] God is in my story.
[3:50] God is in this story.
[3:54] God is in this story. God is in this
[3:59] story.
[4:01] God is in your story.
[4:06] [Music]
[4:09] And so Psalms 27 and I just want to
[4:12] emphasize just verse four and verse five
[4:15] this morning.
[4:17] One thing David says, "One thing have I
[4:21] desired of the Lord and that will I seek
[4:24] after." I want to focus on that that
[4:27] little sentence there, that beginning of
[4:29] the sentence that David said, "One thing
[4:31] have I desired of the Lord." Isn't it
[4:33] amazing that a man of God can come down
[4:37] to one most important one desire?
[4:41] There's only one desire that I have. How
[4:44] many would like to say, I'd like to get
[4:46] my life to that. That really at the end
[4:49] of everything, I really have one desire.
[4:53] Kind of simplifies life, doesn't it? We
[4:56] have a lot of desires. We got a lot of
[4:57] things we want to do, a lot of things we
[4:59] want to accomplish. But this is when a
[5:01] man is growing in the Lord. You know,
[5:03] you know what? He's he's hit this spot
[5:06] where he says, "One thing have I
[5:07] desired. One thing." And there's no
[5:11] Calvary yet.
[5:13] This is before the New Testament. This
[5:15] is the Old. There's no Holy Ghost yet.
[5:17] And yet he says, "I desire this." And
[5:20] this is what he desires. One thing I
[5:21] have a desire of the Lord that will I
[5:23] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[5:26] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[5:30] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[5:33] inquire in his temple. That's amazing.
[5:37] Remember David's the one now who always
[5:40] talked about how much he enjoyed coming
[5:42] to the house of the Lord. He said one
[5:45] place I was glad when they said unto me,
[5:48] let us go to the house of the Lord. And
[5:50] if you're not there, you ought to pray
[5:52] that you get there. Amen. I was glad
[5:55] when they said unto me, he said, "A day
[5:58] in thy courts is better than a
[6:00] thousand."
[6:02] There was something about David that he
[6:04] loved to be at the house of God. But I
[6:07] want to say it wasn't because of the
[6:09] building. It wasn't because of the
[6:11] temple. He gives why he wants to be
[6:13] there. He said that I may dwell in the
[6:16] house of the Lord all the days of my
[6:18] life to behold the beauty of the Lord.
[6:20] You know what? It's not about the
[6:22] building. It's about who's there. But we
[6:24] elaborated many things on the time of
[6:26] trouble. So that you know that without a
[6:28] doubt, no generation has ever seen these
[6:32] type of pressures. No generation has
[6:35] ever seen the type of trouble that we
[6:37] face every day. And the demonic attacks
[6:40] on God's people. There is no age that's
[6:43] ever had it quite like this. And that's
[6:46] why he called it the time of trouble.
[6:48] All generations have had trouble, but
[6:50] there's been no trouble like the trouble
[6:52] that we face every day. Every demon in
[6:55] hell is against the Christian standing
[6:58] for truth. Every devil in hell has its
[7:01] guns pointed at anybody. Any young
[7:03] person, anybody who tries to take a
[7:06] stand for the message of Christ for the
[7:08] last days, every gun is trained on you.
[7:10] Can you say amen? There is demonic
[7:12] forces and mind battles. There is
[7:14] depression. There is uh confusion.
[7:17] There's and and we elaborate on these
[7:19] things. The the mind and the spirit
[7:21] being confused and being tossed about.
[7:23] And it's not only unbelievers that face
[7:25] that. It's believers as well. There's
[7:27] great mind battles. There's great
[7:29] pressures that go with this age. And
[7:32] this generation has uh is seeing the
[7:34] type of trouble and demonic force that's
[7:36] never been seen before. And uh to be
[7:39] honest with you, I'm still pulled
[7:40] sometimes uh to continue to preach the
[7:44] subtle traps that are in our day because
[7:47] they're not traps that were in Luther's
[7:49] day or Wesley's day or during the the
[7:52] dark ages. They had different pressures.
[7:54] They had different temptations. Uh if
[7:57] they stood for Christ, they could have
[7:58] their head cut off. Uh it was different
[8:00] a different type of pressure. Today,
[8:02] they won't cut your head off, but Satan
[8:05] would try to confuse your mind. Satan
[8:07] will try to bring doubts in your mind.
[8:09] Satan will make you doubt your
[8:10] salvation. Doubt that you have the Holy
[8:12] Ghost. Satan will take a mistake that
[8:14] you've made and even though you brought
[8:17] it under the blood, Satan can still try
[8:19] to use it to keep you defeated. And this
[8:22] is the type of enemy we face. And so I
[8:24] feel pulled to continue to talk about
[8:26] such subtle traps that we have today to
[8:29] hold these last days pressures in front
[8:32] of you and uh and and and and to bear
[8:35] through uh the added pressure that's on
[8:38] a preacher like myself. If I hold these
[8:41] things in front of you, uh quite often I
[8:43] become the bad guy who's exposing things
[8:46] in our lives that the devil's using to
[8:48] defeat us. Quite often I become the bad
[8:50] guy. And I don't like being the bad to
[8:51] be honest with you. I don't like being
[8:53] the bad guy. But somebody has to speak
[8:56] truth. That's right. Somebody has to be
[8:59] willing. Sometimes people look at you as
[9:00] the bad guy, but you see now we have to
[9:02] look at it the right way. But I'm
[9:04] willing to do that. I actually am is am
[9:07] dedicated. I'm called to God not to get
[9:10] up here and tell you what you want to
[9:11] hear, but to proclaim truth whether it
[9:14] encourages, convicts, whatever it does.
[9:16] I've got to speak it all. I've got to
[9:18] say what God told me to say. And I have
[9:21] a responsibility to do that. But it
[9:22] doesn't make you too uh popular.
[9:24] Sometimes it's not a pleasant position
[9:27] uh pray for me. And the reason that I
[9:30] make it is because I have a lot of
[9:31] people praying for me. But it is not a
[9:34] pleasant position to point out all the
[9:37] conditions of evil of this hour and the
[9:40] traps that come to believers lives even.
[9:42] It is not a even easy place. But I'm
[9:45] determined to speak what God gives us to
[9:48] help us in this hour. And there are so
[9:50] many things uh that we could speak
[9:52] about. But you see now um as we come to
[9:55] this, we we we want to uh move on from
[9:58] those scriptures of the time of trouble.
[10:01] And I'm sure more things will come up.
[10:02] But I want to move into the scripture
[10:04] into the next spot here and and to be
[10:07] able to speak about this next part uh
[10:09] which speaks about what his answer is to
[10:12] this. uh we can have uh you know uh this
[10:16] he speaks of a place you know he
[10:19] actually gives the answer for all of
[10:21] this pressure and last Sunday I broke
[10:23] down Psalms 27 and talked about all the
[10:25] things similar to this age that we're
[10:28] going through and I trust that was a
[10:29] blessing to you but God's answer was not
[10:32] that we fight against all the uh
[10:35] politics or fight against things God's
[10:38] answer to this age was he said I'm going
[10:40] to hide you in my pavilion.
[10:44] We wouldn't think that's an answer, but
[10:46] that's God's answer. Often we try to
[10:49] find our own answers, but God's answer
[10:52] to the pressure, the depression, the
[10:55] mental instability. God's answer is that
[10:58] I have a place for you of rest. I have a
[11:04] pavilion. I have a secret. And the very
[11:07] reason he names it secret is that it's
[11:09] not for everybody, but it's for my
[11:12] people so they can come into a place of
[11:14] rest and peace. Kind of like a
[11:16] pre-rapture condition. Can you say amen?
[11:19] I have a place of protection. A pavilion
[11:21] is a place of protection. And as we get
[11:24] along studying that, we'll see a
[11:25] pavilion can also be a royal pavilion.
[11:28] And a royal pavilion is a place where
[11:30] the royal soldiers are given a special
[11:33] place to come back and re refresh
[11:35] themselves from battle and to be able to
[11:37] get in that protected pavilion. I
[11:40] believe God's provided provided not just
[11:42] a pavilion but a royal pavilion.
[11:45] Praise the Lord. It's a place of
[11:47] protection. It's a place of release and
[11:49] refreshment. It's a place of peace. It's
[11:52] a place of stability. It's a place
[11:54] that's insulated from us crashing like
[11:58] the rest of the world. Can you say amen?
[12:01] It's a temporary holding place above our
[12:04] enemies and above our fears. It's a safe
[12:07] bomb shelter from Satan's bombs and
[12:11] missiles that he shoots at us. Satan can
[12:14] buzz around, but he can't really
[12:16] completely get to you like he couldn't
[12:18] get to Job. He wanted to get him. He
[12:21] said, "You can mess with his entire
[12:22] life, his emotions, everything you want
[12:24] to, but you'll never take his soul. I've
[12:27] got confidence in his soul." Now,
[12:28] friends, if God had confidence in Job to
[12:31] say to Satan, "Go ahead, do what you
[12:33] want to to him." If he had confidence in
[12:36] Job before the Holy Ghost, before
[12:38] Calvary, then I believe he's got
[12:41] confidence in what he's deposited in
[12:43] your life,
[12:45] that it's going to weather the storm.
[12:47] Satan, go ahead. God has confidence in
[12:50] what he places within us. God has
[12:53] confidence and Satan can buzz around,
[12:55] but the answer is I'm going to give you
[12:58] a hiding place. I'm going to put you in
[13:00] a place of protection. In the next few
[13:02] weeks, the Lord willing, we'll go into
[13:03] what that means, that hiding place, what
[13:06] it means, all the wonderful things. Been
[13:07] listening to the messages and listen all
[13:09] the things leading up to that. And so,
[13:11] we're we're looking at some wonderful
[13:13] things. Uh it's so wonderful. He says,
[13:16] you know, a man can live so hidden in
[13:19] Christ that the devil doesn't know how
[13:22] to get to him. That's right. This a
[13:25] pretty powerful place to live. He
[13:27] doesn't know how to affect us as much as
[13:29] he affecting the rest of the world.
[13:30] We're emotional, we're going to be
[13:31] affected by some things, but he's got a
[13:34] place that the devil, he said he can be
[13:36] so hidden and all of his channels
[13:38] cleaned out. There's not a place for the
[13:40] devil could to get in because it's been
[13:42] blown out by the Holy Spirit. and all
[13:45] those channels are cleaned up, filled
[13:47] with the Holy Ghost. Can I get an amen
[13:49] this morning?
[13:52] God has a place that he's provided. But
[13:56] before we go into that in the next few
[13:58] weeks, the Lord willing, I can't skip
[14:01] over verse four and verse five in this
[14:05] rapture chapter. And that's the text we
[14:08] read when David said, "One thing have I
[14:12] desired."
[14:13] and that's to dwell in his house, in his
[14:17] presence every day of my life.
[14:22] And if that's the rapture chapter and
[14:25] that's what David gives is the answer
[14:28] from God, if that's David's desire, it
[14:32] ought to be our one desire.
[14:36] Not just on Sundays, but every day.
[14:41] And I I think it's interesting that God
[14:45] gives this hiding place. Listen now. God
[14:48] gives this place for us.
[14:52] But then David desires it.
[14:56] God gives us one place of protection to
[14:58] be in today. And David has one desire to
[15:02] be in there. I believe that it's not
[15:05] going to work if just God provides what
[15:07] we need in this hour. We have to desire
[15:09] it.
[15:13] God, help us that it' be the same
[15:15] testimony. One thing have I desired
[15:19] above money, above retirement,
[15:22] above that new truck.
[15:25] I'm hitting you, brothers.
[15:28] Above that new house, above all these
[15:31] other things. No, no, no. It all fades
[15:33] away. And you can't even trust family
[15:35] sometimes. Oh, don't put all your eggs
[15:38] in one basket in your family. They'll
[15:40] disappoint you.
[15:42] If I can just have my family and you
[15:44] hang tightly onto the family, sometimes
[15:46] they won't always be there for you. But
[15:48] I can tell you a presence that will
[15:49] always be there for you.
[15:52] You can't hang tightly onto anything in
[15:54] this life except what God has provided.
[15:57] And so now if God gives you one place
[16:00] and one answer and one I I want to call
[16:03] it a a spiritual place but I don't want
[16:05] to overspiritualize it but he's provided
[16:07] this position this place that you can
[16:10] come into in Christ and he's provided
[16:13] that one place. It's the one answer for
[16:15] all of the trouble of this generation.
[16:18] Then we ought to have one desire above
[16:20] all desires and that is I want to live
[16:22] in that place.
[16:24] One thing have I desired. His desires
[16:28] were in line with the place that God
[16:30] provided. It would do no good if God
[16:34] provided a secret place if we did not
[16:37] have passion to be in there. This place
[16:40] is mentioned, this phrase is mentioned
[16:42] in other places in scripture and uh it's
[16:45] I'll say it first. It was mentioned to
[16:46] the rich young ruler when he come to him
[16:48] for eternal life. Come to Christ and
[16:50] Jesus said you have you done the
[16:52] commandments? He said, "Yes, I've done
[16:53] all those things since I was a young
[16:55] boy. I've done all that, but I'm still
[16:56] I'm still hungering for something. I'm
[16:58] still looking for something." He was
[17:00] wanting the person of eternal life. And
[17:01] he was standing right in front of them
[17:03] in front of him. And he says, "Come and
[17:05] follow me." And he says, "I want I've
[17:07] done all these things right. I've been a
[17:08] good boy, but I'm still lacking the the
[17:11] the Holy Ghost in my life." You can have
[17:14] everything and still there's a hunger
[17:16] for something real in God. And you have
[17:18] to want that with a great passion. and I
[17:21] want it more than any other thing in
[17:23] life. And so, uh, he said to him though,
[17:27] he said, "One thing," he uses the same
[17:29] phrase, "One thing that you should do."
[17:31] So, now he simplifies it because we're
[17:33] always looking for a list of stuff to
[17:35] do. Yeah.
[17:38] How do I get from point A from point B?
[17:41] Because our bosses will tell us that or
[17:42] we're taught in class in order to get to
[17:45] this degree. You got this semester, this
[17:47] semester. And you know when I looked at
[17:49] that three years that four years that I
[17:51] have it was overwhelming for me. I felt
[17:53] like bailing out because everything we
[17:55] do we got a list in order to get to that
[17:58] you got this and this and you got to do
[18:00] this. You know what the way some people
[18:02] look at church and look at this message
[18:04] they look at as I got this whole thing
[18:07] to go through including what I wear in
[18:10] order to get to Christ. I want to tell
[18:12] you that's not true.
[18:16] God hasn't provided a list for us. God's
[18:19] asked for a surrender.
[18:23] And people don't come and they quit
[18:25] coming because they're going through
[18:26] their minds and they're figuring, I'm
[18:27] going to have to do this. I'm going to
[18:29] have to give up this. I'm going to have
[18:30] to give up this. And so it's just it's
[18:32] too overwhelming. I can't do it. I can't
[18:34] do it. And the very fact you're saying,
[18:35] I can't do it. That's a good statement.
[18:38] Can I get an amen? That's a good that if
[18:40] you really believe that, you can't do
[18:42] it.
[18:44] You can't do it by yourself. You can't
[18:46] measure up. Measure up. You can never be
[18:48] good enough on the outside to make it
[18:50] into the grace of God. That's not how he
[18:52] set this up. But we have a whole list
[18:55] and I have to give this up. And most of
[18:57] the time, people are looking more to
[18:59] what they have to give up than what they
[19:01] get. But you see now when he spoke to
[19:04] the rich young ruler, he honed in on one
[19:07] thing that would be more important than
[19:09] eternal life. He asked him, "Did you do
[19:12] the commandments?" But that wasn't the
[19:13] real big issue. He found and the only
[19:16] reason Jesus is saying, "I'm going to
[19:18] put my finger on the one place in your
[19:19] life that's more important and that's
[19:21] all the riches you have because he know
[19:23] in his heart that's more important to
[19:25] you than eternal life." Even though he's
[19:26] saying, "I want eternal life. I want
[19:28] eternal life." Okay. One thing you must
[19:30] do, go sell everything that you have and
[19:33] give it to the poor.
[19:36] I don't know how many minutes or hours
[19:38] he stood there and thought that through,
[19:40] but he turned it down. Now, a lot of
[19:43] people say, "That's mean. That's mean.
[19:45] That wasn't mean." The rich ruler is the
[19:47] one that's asking for eternal life. He's
[19:49] the one standing in front of found Jesus
[19:51] and asked. He asked. But you see, if
[19:54] we're not willing to give up sometimes
[19:56] the one thing, then we can't come to the
[19:59] simplicity of the one thing that God's
[20:01] going to give us. It's not complicated.
[20:06] It's not a sign. If I can just see a
[20:08] sign,
[20:10] it's not a sign. It's a surrender.
[20:15] Amen. It's just Lord, here I am. That's
[20:18] right. I don't know how to do all this.
[20:20] Amen. But I do know this. I don't want
[20:23] the world anymore. That's right. I don't
[20:25] want to play around anymore. I want you.
[20:28] And if you can hone in to my one desire
[20:31] is to be where you're at so you can
[20:32] change me. That's all God needs. So you
[20:35] have physical desires, you have
[20:36] emotional desires, and then of course
[20:38] you have spiritual desires. Every human
[20:40] being, I believe, has a soul and has a
[20:43] hunger for God, has a hunger to be
[20:45] filled by God. But most human beings
[20:48] will take even that thirst for God. And
[20:51] Satan will try to fill that void, that
[20:53] vacuum for God with other things. uh on
[20:56] Friday night and talking about the young
[20:58] people, talking to the young people
[20:59] about the little bit this and I was
[21:01] talking to them about managing their
[21:03] cravings because they have cravings.
[21:05] They have thirst. They have needs in
[21:06] their life and they become very
[21:08] prominent when they get uh into
[21:10] adolescence and they have these needs.
[21:12] They have these feelings and things
[21:14] going on and they're cravings and
[21:15] they're god-given cravings. And I I let
[21:18] them know my my title tonight is uh
[21:20] managing cravings. And I said, "This is
[21:22] not a little devotion on dieting. It's
[21:25] not what it is. It's it's more about
[21:27] your spiritual and emotional cravings.
[21:30] Uh one time we took a few weeks ago
[21:32] managing our time because Satan would
[21:35] like to us as a young person to waste
[21:37] our time. So we have to measure our
[21:39] time. We have to take a control of our
[21:41] time or Satan will fill our time with a
[21:44] bunch of junk. Can you say amen? So we
[21:46] need time with the Lord. We need to
[21:48] manage our time. Well, just like we
[21:49] manage our time, we manage our cravings.
[21:52] We must bring our cravings and our
[21:54] thirst under control of the Holy Ghost.
[21:56] And if we don't manage it, Satan will
[21:59] mismanage and Satan will abuse our
[22:02] cravings.
[22:05] Very true.
[22:08] And it and it seems like you see it
[22:10] seems like there's a crossover. The
[22:12] basic need of course is for food. But
[22:16] first of all, people when they need to
[22:18] eat, then they get hungry enough,
[22:22] they'll get any kind of food. They'll
[22:23] get in a garbage can and get anything.
[22:26] If they can't find food, they're going
[22:27] to eat out of a garbage can. Well, isn't
[22:30] that similar with every thirst that we
[22:31] have? If we don't get to the right food,
[22:34] the right word for our soul, we'll eat
[22:37] anything. We'll get on the internet and
[22:39] feed our soul anything. And that's not
[22:41] good cuz there's junk food out there.
[22:43] That's right. Can you say amen? there's
[22:45] junk food out there. And so with any
[22:47] need that we have when become become so
[22:50] desperate, we'll eat out of a garbage
[22:52] can. And then they cross over a bit
[22:54] because then you eat because uh you it's
[22:57] been proven that you you eat a lot or
[23:00] you overeat sometimes or you eat the
[23:02] wrong things not because you're hungry,
[23:05] but because you have another emotional
[23:08] need.
[23:12] Uh, don't think that I'm going to talk
[23:13] like an expert on this. I'm not an
[23:15] expert. You wouldn't listen to me
[23:17] anyway. I'm not an expert on the dieting
[23:18] thing, but I am certainly learning. I
[23:21] told you I'm on a journey and I'm
[23:22] learning. And one of the things they've
[23:24] said for years and we're finally
[23:25] listening is that sometimes it's not a
[23:28] food problem. It's that it's a it's a
[23:30] crossover. There's another emotional
[23:32] need that's not being fulfilled and
[23:35] you're trying to fill it with food.
[23:38] How many's heard that before? You see,
[23:41] so if you don't address the emotional
[23:42] need, you can be on 50,000 diets. You
[23:45] can and and I've been on a lot of them
[23:47] myself. You know, the uh I went on a
[23:50] 30-day diet one time and I lost a month.
[23:56] Trust me, I've seen the diets and I, you
[23:59] know, I've been through a lot of them
[24:00] and and you know, I still trying to
[24:04] conquer this thing and I will conquer it
[24:06] by the grace of God because I told the
[24:09] ministers that I have
[24:11] donelap disease. My belly done lapped
[24:14] over my belt
[24:16] and that's the problem. That's it's a
[24:17] disease. But when you start to look at
[24:20] this, you see that it can cross over
[24:23] into another emotional need. Let me say
[24:25] it this way is that when we have
[24:28] sometimes problems come in our lives and
[24:33] we look at the reason for the problem
[24:35] and we look for the answer for the
[24:37] problem. But many of the problems boil
[24:40] back to some emotional need that's not
[24:44] being met or wasn't met early in your
[24:46] life.
[24:48] And now you still have that need,
[24:51] appreciation, significance, a need for
[24:54] significance, a desire for significance,
[24:56] a desire for approval, a desire for
[24:58] praise, a desire for worth. And you have
[25:02] that, it wasn't fulfilled. So now you go
[25:04] about life trying to fill it other ways
[25:06] so you can fill that need. But unless
[25:08] you address the need and the real desire
[25:10] there, then you see now something else
[25:12] can fill its place. So people could eat
[25:15] because there's another emotional need.
[25:17] And that's true in the spiritual need
[25:19] for God. Satan fills other things to
[25:21] fill a spir spiritual need and a desire
[25:24] and a hunger for God. Can you say amen?
[25:28] I'm attracted to Twinkies.
[25:31] And one of the I was attracted real
[25:33] young to Twinkies because I I was so
[25:36] attracted to Twinkies when I was a a
[25:38] little boy that it made me steal them.
[25:40] It was one of my first sins. as me and
[25:43] the the neighborhood boys concocted a
[25:46] plan, as we watched a big uh hostess
[25:50] truck come by the back of the shopping
[25:53] center in Lima every day. And we begin
[25:55] to watch this and we watched it
[25:57] together. Every day it comes the same
[25:59] time. And and the driver goes inside for
[26:03] about a half hour and it was open game.
[26:09] Come on people, you should like me. I'm
[26:11] confessing one of my first sins to you.
[26:14] But I had never went for those Twinkies
[26:16] and we did. And we took a bunch of them
[26:18] and I we went out in the woods and I
[26:19] think we ate them all in one shot right
[26:21] out in the woods. We did it. It's out
[26:24] there. I stole Twinkies.
[26:27] But that wasn't it so much as as much as
[26:29] it I had to have an attraction. I had to
[26:33] have something craving that. So now I
[26:35] know this is real simple, but you look
[26:37] at this and you say, I'm trying to get
[26:39] you to look at the depths of your
[26:40] desires, right? That we want something,
[26:44] but what is it that we really need?
[26:49] How many times do we make choices
[26:52] because we we want something, but we
[26:56] don't really spiritually need it, but
[26:59] because we want it, we go get it. Now,
[27:02] David, come down. there's one thing I
[27:04] desire. He honed in as just one thing I
[27:06] desire. But David, remember David was a
[27:08] man, he had many desires. He he had many
[27:12] things to accomplish in his kingdom. And
[27:14] yet, he could come down to one desire.
[27:15] Matter of fact, some of David's desires
[27:18] were not that great. He actually made
[27:21] mistakes with some of his desires.
[27:23] That's right. And you know about his
[27:25] mistakes. They're not hidden in the
[27:26] Bible. And he went and committed
[27:28] adultery with Basheba out of what?
[27:31] starting with a desire but a desire
[27:33] became perverted.
[27:34] He wasn't happy with his own situation.
[27:37] And so he went to someone else. And so
[27:39] now we find David after going through
[27:42] all those things, he must have come to a
[27:44] place that through all that, God's
[27:46] forgiven me. Psalms 51 is where he
[27:48] repents. God forgives him. God washes it
[27:50] away. But through these mistakes, you
[27:53] learn something. And you should learn
[27:55] about your desires.
[27:58] You should learn that I better bring my
[28:00] desires and keep them pure under the
[28:03] Holy Ghost because Satan can manipulate
[28:07] and abuse pure desires. Thank you for
