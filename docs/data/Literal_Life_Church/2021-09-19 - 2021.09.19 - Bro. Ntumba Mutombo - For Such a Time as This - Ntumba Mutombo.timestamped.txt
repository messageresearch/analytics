[0:00] mississippi
[0:01] but we got a lot of love i'll tell you
[0:03] that and i'm just so honored to be in
[0:05] the house of lord again because the lord
[0:07] said he dwells in the house of the
[0:08] worshipper and i count like a thousand
[0:11] here so god is here and he doesn't go
[0:13] back on his word amen so let's just
[0:16] trust him for that and i'd just like to
[0:18] thank the lafontaine family so much for
[0:20] thinking about us on this day and going
[0:22] out of the way to accommodate us
[0:24] matthew 10 42 says and whoever gives to
[0:28] one of these little ones those who are
[0:30] humble in rank and influence even a cup
[0:32] of cold water
[0:34] to drink because he is my disciple
[0:36] i truly just say to you you would never
[0:38] lose your reward
[0:40] and thank you so much thank you guys so
[0:42] much for just being here and for those
[0:44] people for everyone who traveled here
[0:46] and took their time and did all that
[0:48] just to be here in this in this house
[0:50] and this presence god bless you and give
[0:52] you safe childhood mercies to return
[0:54] home and if he said it
[0:57] i believe it and that settles it amen so
[0:59] let's trust god this morning if we could
[1:01] all just stand to our feet for the
[1:03] reading of the word
[1:04] we can start with esther 4 verse 14.
[1:08] i'll try to keep this as short as
[1:09] possible
[1:11] and my voice is probably going to be
[1:12] gone by the time i'm done anyway so
[1:15] but we trust god
[1:17] amen
[1:19] for if you remain silent at this time
[1:23] relief and deliverance for the jews will
[1:25] arise from another place
[1:27] but for you and your father's family
[1:28] will perish
[1:30] and who knows
[1:32] but that you have come to your royal
[1:34] position for such a time as this
[1:38] and who knows
[1:39] that you
[1:42] have come to your royal position for
[1:43] such a time as this
[1:45] amen you may be seated
[1:48] for a text today i've taken the title
[1:50] for such a time as this
[1:53] and i love this prophet the story that
[1:54] the prophet tells and doors and door
[1:56] preaching 1965 in february he speaks
[2:00] about a pro pastor a minister who every
[2:03] single day for for every sunday and
[2:05] wednesday for 20 years solid who would
[2:07] preach for 20 minutes and then be done
[2:09] and many people couldn't understand how
[2:11] it was and one morning he preached for
[2:13] four hours and so the deacons called him
[2:15] back like
[2:17] pastor um
[2:19] we really love you
[2:21] and oh we think your messages are all
[2:23] wonderful
[2:25] and he said but us as the deacon boards
[2:27] we watched you when you timed you every
[2:29] single day and for exactly 20 minutes
[2:31] every sunday morning but this morning it
[2:33] was four and we just don't understand
[2:35] and the prophet and uh and the minister
[2:37] responded to them and said i tell you
[2:39] brethren
[2:40] every morning when i go to preach
[2:42] whenever you call me to the platform i
[2:44] reach into my pocket and grab a
[2:46] lifesaver and i place it under my tongue
[2:48] and in 20 minutes when the lifesaver is
[2:50] gone
[2:51] i'm finished and i know it's time to
[2:53] quit and he said the mistake this
[2:55] morning was i grabbed the button
[2:57] so he took a button and put it under his
[2:59] tongue and so that four hours and i'm
[3:01] pretty sure this this afternoon i
[3:03] checked and i uh yeah i'm pretty sure
[3:06] and i did not grab a button but listen
[3:08] cozy i came here with a message of hope
[3:11] and a message of truth a history lesson
[3:13] of our present state and i pray that
[3:15] this message with all my heart today
[3:17] will spark a commission for someone in
[3:19] this room or even watching online now or
[3:22] later because i know god would redirect
[3:25] someone by causing a raging storm and
[3:27] redirect his prophet to stop in memphis
[3:29] tennessee to meet a mother of a dying
[3:31] boy
[3:32] my dad he was walking by feet
[3:34] and she had the faith of rashuna my
[3:36] woman and she pulled him and she drew
[3:38] him and she met him at the door and said
[3:40] parsons how would she know it was her
[3:43] faith that drew him to him
[3:44] that's exactly what happened and i know
[3:46] people that their timing was reset by 10
[3:49] seconds because their child ran out the
[3:51] door and grabbed hey mommy i love you
[3:52] and gave them a hug and they miss an
[3:54] accident because their timing was reset
[3:56] by a mere 10 seconds i've heard stories
[3:58] of people stopping to the store on 9 11
[4:00] to grab a band-aid on the foot because
[4:03] right before tragedy stuck out of light
[4:05] at the workplace this is the god that we
[4:08] serve the god that we serve is so
[4:10] analytical he's an absolute author of
[4:12] all things an absolute mathematician
[4:14] he is so technical in his timing he is
[4:16] so technical in his order and i pray
[4:18] that at least one verse and at least one
[4:20] story at least one quote will give you
[4:22] life and it will stick with you and
[4:25] stick in your heart and god is not
[4:27] looking for a theologian this afternoon
[4:29] he's looking for anyone merely anybody
[4:32] who is willing to forego their
[4:33] understanding their ideologies and their
[4:35] beliefs and their traditions and totally
[4:37] put their trust in his word and his
[4:39] promises and god is not a man that he
[4:42] should lie he is looking for
[4:43] availability and not ability he will use
[4:45] you yes you and your environment
[4:48] everything about it he simply asked
[4:50] moses the easy question what is in your
[4:52] hand
[4:53] and i'm asking you this afternoon what
[4:55] is in your hand oh i'm nine years old i
[4:57] just play fortnite and not know what is
[5:00] in your hand ask yourself that question
[5:02] god is not looking for age he doesn't
[5:04] care about how old you are he doesn't
[5:05] care about how much you know what is in
[5:07] your hand
[5:09] he took john right out of the wilderness
[5:11] and he was attacking the the priests and
[5:13] the the patriarchs and everybody with
[5:15] what he preached about trees snakes in
[5:17] the wilderness what else did he preach
[5:20] about
[5:20] to come with the messiah that was it
[5:22] simple as that god uses everything that
[5:24] you have and he manifests your gifts for
[5:26] his glory amen
[5:28] and i pray that this afternoon that god
[5:30] can use a broken man like me and a
[5:32] sinner above all things
[5:35] to share what he's pressing to my heart
[5:37] and who knows
[5:39] that you have come to your royal
[5:40] position for such a time as this
[5:42] amen
[5:44] amen the interesting thing about the
[5:45] book of esther
[5:47] biblical research states this about this
[5:49] book and there's only two books in the
[5:51] bible that are mentioned
[5:53] and the rule is mentioned multiple times
[5:56] and the author always fails to mention
[5:58] the name of god or jesus
[6:00] this book specifically esther
[6:03] the king xerxes or king of hazares
[6:06] is mentioned nearly 200 times and
[6:08] scholars said that his name was
[6:10] mentioned 170 times to be exact in this
[6:13] book 10 chapters in total and god
[6:16] himself was not mentioned once
[6:19] was god present in the time
[6:21] was god still working in the time you
[6:23] asked yourself that question but i know
[6:25] in my heart from genesis to revelation
[6:28] that this
[6:29] is the greatest love story ever told
[6:32] these scriptures in the 66 chapters
[6:34] combined the most beautiful thing in the
[6:36] world just absolute love about a father
[6:39] who loves his children so much that he
[6:40] would even give his own
[6:42] just so that we can live again if you
[6:44] listen to closely to the words you'll
[6:46] see the promises you hear the
[6:47] understanding and you can connect
[6:50] 8 000 promises in the bible
[6:53] and god
[6:54] is picking one for you one for you one
[6:56] for you like oprah you get a promise you
[6:58] get a promise you get a promise he
[7:00] promised you that believe it take him at
[7:02] his word
[7:03] amen this is just the highlights of
[7:05] god's love
[7:06] he's so beautiful
[7:08] according let i just want to kind of
[7:10] bring this into a drama
[7:12] i i don't remember the past about during
[7:14] the uh
[7:15] your installment of the church or the
[7:18] the first week here
[7:19] he speaks about the drama
[7:21] and i feel like the bible is just so
[7:23] beautiful how it to me it's like a movie
[7:25] i look at the words and i can kind of
[7:28] see the characters lining up and do you
[7:29] mind if i just share with you like that
[7:31] for a little bit
[7:32] and so according to historians the story
[7:35] of esther picks up around 486 bc before
[7:38] about 500 years before the birth of
[7:40] christ and there's a few extensions in
[7:43] this book because the persians and medes
[7:45] were at war and they were actively
[7:47] expanding their empire throughout the
[7:49] war with wars and various expeditions
[7:52] at this point in history they were stuck
[7:54] at the lion versus the greek
[7:56] and that was the biggest adversary and
[7:57] their biggest threat this particular
[8:00] character is king of hazaris he's also
[8:02] known historically as king xerxes the
[8:04] son of king darius and the grandson of
[8:06] king cyrus and if you read your bible
[8:08] you would know that king cyrus was
[8:10] famously known for being a very
[8:12] fortunate persian ruler who allowed the
[8:14] jews to return home after 70 years of
[8:17] captivity
[8:18] he knew the promise
[8:20] god told god already wrote it that the
[8:22] jews would never be in captive he told
[8:24] him that they would be out and king
[8:25] cyrus got the revelation he was not a
[8:28] message pastor he was not a message
[8:30] believer but he something just clicked
[8:32] to him he was a pagan worshiper and if
[8:34] we're being honest but something opened
[8:37] up and so he released the jews into
[8:39] freedom and this particular offer was
[8:41] this particular offer of freedom was
[8:43] taken up by many families and many
[8:45] families actually decided to stay in the
[8:47] land and i'll get back to that a little
[8:49] later and so this story takes place in
[8:51] souza and the capital is the persian uh
[8:54] the persian empire and this is the
[8:56] capital of the persian empire king built
[8:58] by king and hazarius father king darius
[9:01] and susa the king the city of susa
[9:03] itself was a beautiful city and there
[9:05] was just so much vibrance in the city
[9:07] the city was full of merchants traders
[9:09] caravans full of goods and full of
[9:11] treasures and neighboring provinces and
[9:14] areas almost like like envy this this
[9:16] was this place was beautiful the city
[9:18] life was unparalleled to anywhere else
[9:20] in the world and it drew people from all
[9:22] over the world to live just and some
[9:25] people just came to visit some people
[9:26] came to stay and the ground was fertile
[9:29] and the livestock was booming so people
[9:31] ate good they laughed they rejoiced and
[9:33] they were just happy all the time
[9:35] because the city was beautiful
[9:37] and even though there was prosperity in
[9:39] the city
[9:40] there was still the rulers and the
[9:42] people of the land at war
[9:44] we're in that situation now now right
[9:46] now our rulers and the people are at war
[9:49] at wits people trying to understand
[9:52] what's going on there's just so much
[9:53] confusion and though even though there
[9:55] was prosperity in everything in the land
[9:57] there was still war within the city
[10:00] and there was still life going on
[10:02] there was a devastating amount of sin
[10:04] that was taking place in this persian
[10:06] empire in hatred there was murder there
[10:08] was idol worship witchcraft racism
[10:11] classism and so many more flaws of
[10:14] mankind
[10:15] don't ever let the presence of
[10:17] prosperity take your mind off the weight
[10:19] of reality the prophet says in the
[10:21] message the way of a true prophet
[10:23] preached in 1963 january 19 paragraph 49
[10:28] he says usually prosperity causes sin
[10:31] many people look upon prosperity as
[10:33] blessings
[10:35] it would be
[10:36] if we could handle it right but at least
[10:39] it usually leads us to sin
[10:42] and dishonoring god
[10:44] paragraph 51 says and how israel drifted
[10:48] off into terrible sin
[10:50] and gotten away from god and gotten away
[10:52] from his commandments his precepts and
[10:54] went off altogether on a tantrum
[10:57] the woman walked in the streets with
[10:59] their fine immodest
[11:01] modest clothes and the men went about
[11:03] gambling and drinking the roadhouses
[11:05] what we would call today a place of
[11:07] amusement
[11:09] a wide open city
[11:12] the capital of souza was inhabited by so
[11:14] many individuals from many different
[11:16] walks of life and there was already
[11:17] inhabitants because it was taken over
[11:20] due to war
[11:21] and many of the residents were actually
[11:23] there because of the result of war and
[11:25] others were forced there because of the
[11:27] detention that took place
[11:28] when jerusalem was destroyed the
[11:30] israelites were captured by the
[11:32] babylonians and brought them to live
[11:34] under the rule and some lived as slaves
[11:37] and some were were brought there and
[11:39] forced to study and train in the ways of
[11:40] the land and you see people like daniel
[11:43] and that's exactly what happened they
[11:45] were brought from royalty and put into
[11:47] royalty just to learn the ways of the
[11:49] politics the laws the magic astrology
[11:52] the trades and the businesses so that
[11:55] one day they could also become rulers
[11:57] and and kings of other provinces
[12:00] and i feel like i've seen that sometime
[12:02] in history before think about that a
[12:04] little bit i digress
[12:06] and there was always constantly a war
[12:09] between identity and i just love that
[12:12] this is always the biggest struggle
[12:15] for us as individuals always the biggest
[12:17] struggle for us as christians is our
[12:19] identity like we learned this morning he
[12:21] already knew who we were
[12:23] he shaped every last moment of our lives
[12:27] why do we question
[12:29] what do we have to question he already
[12:31] wrote it down
[12:34] but this is what happens people are
[12:35] taken from their land and their place
[12:37] into another land and then influence
[12:40] influence influence influence and people
[12:43] forget now they start practicing magic
[12:47] they start practicing all the different
[12:49] astrology zodiac oh i'm a cancer i'm a
[12:52] sagittar come on
[12:54] those sins are small this is the truth
[12:57] this is the truth open it up
[12:59] those things don't matter they're small
[13:01] yeah god uses it but don't depend on
[13:04] that trust in his word
[13:06] this has always been a war
[13:08] the other day i was reading a doctor
[13:10] from like the open university she stated
[13:12] that there was 57 different genders
[13:15] what
[13:18] come on let's think about that for a
[13:20] second 57
[13:22] what is up with the attack on identity
[13:24] what do they what does the world want to
[13:26] do
[13:27] what are they gaining from this
[13:30] they just want to bring confusion
[13:32] they're trying to bring it into the
[13:33] church you have to know who you are
[13:36] 57 there's not even 57 states
[13:40] come on
[13:41] think about it
[13:43] and if you speak out of context if you
[13:46] say something wrong in the class your
[13:48] professor is like whoa whoa whoa
[13:50] i know you're paying 40 000 a year but
[13:53] you can't say that
[13:54] you don't have an opinion here you're
[13:56] paying me you say what i think
[13:58] my doctrine is yours i was just talking
[14:01] to gabby yesterday
[14:02] she was talking about something that she
[14:04] she had wrote and her professor was like
[14:06] nah
[14:07] i don't like your answer not the
[14:08] response and she had to try to mold it
[14:10] in a way
[14:11] in which it would make sense for the
[14:12] professor
[14:14] but the professor himself was like nah i
[14:16] don't like that answer
[14:18] you're paying for an education but
[14:19] they're like no you're taking this
[14:21] doctrine and that's it
[14:23] 57 genders
[14:26] there's so much
[14:28] of a crisis for identity
[14:31] this is our mirror right now
[14:33] take a look
[14:36] church we need to wake up
[14:38] parents
[14:40] teach your children the way
[14:42] of christ and their youth
[14:44] proverbs 20 22 verse 6 says train your
[14:48] child up in the way of god so when he's
[14:49] old he will not depart from it
[14:52] do you know what we are up against
[14:53] church
[14:54] do you know what we're up against do you
[14:56] know who we're up against
[14:59] we we have an adversary who's been
[15:01] fighting
[15:02] since the days of the garden
[15:04] oh actually before that right yeah
[15:06] before that in heaven he was fighting
[15:09] he just wants to be on top he wants to
[15:11] be number one so he's going to find his
[15:13] way into a church he's going to find a
[15:15] way into our schools a government into
[15:17] our homes he just wants to keep doing it
[15:20] but our identities should be in the
[15:21] scripture
[15:22] you should find your favorite character
[15:24] in the bible young guys young girls
[15:27] find it like our pastor preached this
[15:29] morning find them there
[15:31] everything that you've ever been to was
[15:33] already here
[15:35] this is a fixed fight we already know
[15:37] juwan
[15:38] don't give up on god because he won't
[15:40] give up on you
[15:42] he can do exceedingly and abundantly
[15:43] above all that we can ask or think all
[15:46] that all that we can even imagine
[15:49] i i imagine flying but he can do more
[15:51] than that
[15:52] i was talking to justin yesterday he's
[15:54] just like oh i just flew here from maine
[15:56] my arms are tired
[15:58] think about that don't let that go over
[16:00] your head that's beautiful
[16:02] but he says he can do more than that
[16:04] more than that so one day when we get
[16:06] that quickening faith it's because he
[16:08] promised it to do more and more and more
[16:11] stop limiting god
[16:13] he's god he's the creator of all things
[16:16] just trust him take him at his word
[16:19] amen
[16:20] the enemy found eve in the garden
[16:23] and he got it to doubt
[16:26] that's it
[16:27] that's why we die
[16:29] right he got it to doubt
[16:32] eve combated with the word
[16:34] she combated she knew her scripture too
[16:36] but then he said surely you won't die
[16:40] just a little bit of reasoning
[16:42] the prophet says in the contest
[16:44] preaching on in december 31st 1962
[16:49] but even knew the scripture did she not
[16:51] well
[16:52] excuse me the prophet said but god said
[16:54] you would and that settles it that broke
[16:57] the great tug of war and it pulled the
[16:59] human uh human race unto death because
[17:02] eve listened to reasoning against god's
[17:04] word
[17:05] now it's the same that she did but
[17:07] that's in the past
[17:09] that's in the past church
[17:11] eve listened and she failed
[17:13] but you know that she did so don't fall
[17:15] trust his word find somebody that you
[17:17] can trust him
[17:18] find someone that you can lean on so
[17:20] find someone that could help you through
[17:22] this
[17:23] we try to get through this life all
[17:25] alone
[17:26] i i went to school i just graduated two
[17:29] years ago i'm kind of still going so but
[17:32] i was in school and i was in ra
[17:35] i was i was in charge of 32 uh resident
[17:38] assistants they gave me a promotion
[17:40] after one year it was kind of weird i
[17:42] don't know what they were trying to do
[17:43] to me but i was there and it's just one
[17:46] of the most loneliest places in the in
[17:48] the country
[17:49] they give you a freedom of time freedom
[17:51] of space
[17:54] alcohol
[17:55] a lot of bad decisions
[17:58] it's just a challenge and people are
[18:00] trying to find their identity
[18:02] always always and i just always try to
[18:04] remind people
[18:06] that there's hope and there's peace
[18:09] and we should all have that commission
[18:12] and i dealt with students coming into my

[21:03] redirect us from our calling he makes us
[21:05] doubt and forget about
[21:07] and even better yet deny who we are
[21:10] and where we come from
[21:11] and most importantly where we are going
[21:14] our strength is in our identity
[21:17] the many jews going back to this time in
[21:19] esther many jews hid the identities to
[21:22] create a level of comfort
[21:23] with the hope that one day they would be
[21:25] accepted in this great persian empire
[21:29] even with the history of destruction
[21:32] even with the history of abuse even with
[21:35] the history of exile and continuous acts
[21:37] of hate and multiple cases of isolation
[21:42] many israelites actually stuck around
[21:45] even after they were released from
[21:47] detention
[21:48] the law said you can go
[21:50] southwest says you were free to now move
[21:52] around the country

[22:39] mindset and the notion that they're
[22:41] going to begin a new life
[22:43] and i can even say many people denied
[22:45] the message

[26:34] did they forget
[26:35] did they forget about where they came
[26:37] from their name was still the same
[26:40] the only difference was they were out of
[26:42] actual captivity
[26:44] physical captivity
[26:46] but they were still in spiritual
[26:48] captivity
[26:49] stuck
[26:50] stuck in the mud you guys ever played
[26:52] that game
[26:53] no okay
[26:55] i know you have
[26:57] you just don't want to tell me
[26:59] so these borderline believers knew the
[27:01] promises and yet they denied the power
[27:04] not thinking about the results of sin
[27:06] not thinking about the wages of sin
[27:09] the prophet said in the results of a
[27:11] decision preached in 1955 october 8th
[27:14] oh brother

[27:48] went over the border and brought back
[27:50] the evidence that is it's a good land

[27:59] the full bible is here divine healing is
[28:03] here rejoicing is him happiness is here
[28:07] peace is here and everything in the
[28:10] bible as promised
[28:11] is
[28:16] every fruit that is in this land
[28:18] a
[28:19] man
[28:21] but the children of israel were so
[28:23] comfortable
[28:24] that they were starting to become
[28:25] first-class citizens and hold offices
[28:29] become
[28:30] wealthy tradesmen
[28:32] and their goods and their various crafts
[28:34] were highly sought after
[28:37] they finally got a million likes on
[28:40] persian tick tock
[28:44] you got a million replays they finally
[28:45] got to that level
[28:48] think about that word guys tick-tock

[28:54] is he not
[28:55] attacking
[28:57] time
[29:00] [Applause]

[29:16] you're stuck
[29:19] but every promise god made is here
[29:24] not there it's here
[29:27] take your time back
[29:29] what is it going to be church let's get
[29:31] back to this king of hazaris let me
[29:34] describe this character he was known for
[29:36] his extravagant banquets his parties and
[29:39] his festivals and he hosted absolute
[29:41] ragers
[29:43] in today's terms
[29:44] these these rages will last for days on
[29:47] end
[29:48] and this particular festival that that
[29:50] is described in in this in this chapter
[29:54] lasts for 180 days
[29:58] can you think about that
[30:01] 180 days
[30:04] the king of hazaris so king xerxes or
[30:06] some people know him as was in
[30:08] retirement for the time being and he was
[30:11] taking a strategic break from war and he
[30:13] was respect and he was scheduled to
[30:15] return to the front line soon
[30:17] and the final day
[30:19] with a drunken exclamation
[30:22] seven more days
[30:24] they extended the party
[30:26] 180
[30:30] seven
[30:32] 187 days now
[30:35] and on that last
[30:36] on the day before they extended it
[30:40] he calls out to
[30:41] queen vashti to come
[30:46] in that moment
[30:48] it shook up the nation
[30:50] but god needed that moment to happen
[30:56] 180 days that's about let's do them at
[30:59] six months
[31:01] and i know some people here in this
[31:03] building that took six months
[31:05] to get their driver's license
[31:07] but i won't mention his name but i do
[31:09] have the same first name middle name as
[31:11] last name as him
[31:17] don't judge me guys this is church
[31:21] and i was actually wondering like think
[31:23] about it it took me a long time i
[31:25] remember crying one day in my sister's
[31:26] car
[31:29] six months is a long time six months is
[31:32] a long time but these guys they they
[31:35] went to bed
[31:36] drunk
[31:37] woke up
[31:39] i guess i'll drink again
[31:41] and festivities and partying and all the
[31:43] sin that was taking place in this city
[31:46] happening simultaneously simultaneously
[31:48] simultaneously and he just couldn't let
[31:50] it go
[31:53] oh remember the promises of moses
[31:56] moses who's that
[31:59] that's the point that some people got
[32:00] into
[32:01] 180 days
[32:04] the king hosted these festivals with all
[32:06] the rules rulers and the royalty of all
[32:09] the provinces you reigned and governed
[32:10] over and they said he had 127
[32:14] different provinces
[32:15] and his kingdom ruled for modern-day
[32:18] india all the way to ethiopia
[32:20] and that distance was about from
[32:22] portland maine how many people know
[32:23] where portland maine is
[32:25] oh sweet
[32:26] from portland maine all the way to
[32:28] tucson arizona
[32:31] 2700 miles how many people have been in
[32:33] dukes in arizona
[32:35] sweet
[32:36] sorry i hate to use that word twice but
[32:38] i had
[32:39] 200
[32:40] 2 hundred miles in straight distance not
[32:43] even counting the north and south
[32:46] king hazarus was a great king the
[32:48] prophet describes in paragraph
[32:50] 18147 marriage of a lamb preached in
[32:53] 1962
[32:55] january 21st in the evening he called
[32:57] king a hazarist one of the greatest
[32:59] kings in the world of that day
[33:02] this is the king that was ruling the
[33:04] land of people who were
[33:06] sinners and pagans and all these things
[33:08] but the prophet still called him that
[33:10] because the prophet knew
[33:13] this was the rule of the land and a lot
[33:15] of bad things were happening but the
[33:16] prophet still saw him as a great king
[33:20] with that being the matter of fact king
[33:22] xerxes king of
[33:23] was still a man and discipline a man of
[33:25] tradition and ex and excellence and he
[33:28] was very very good at war
[33:30] he was a pagan ruler and his great
[33:33] empire battled
[33:34] was so great his empire was so great
[33:37] even he was the king himself but he he
[33:40] battled with alcohol rage and revenge
[33:42] but he was still a king of the people
[33:44] and he cared for his people and was
[33:46] adamant with the greek army
[33:48] who was his biggest threat was adamant
[33:50] with destroying the greek army who was
[33:52] his biggest threat
[33:53] because his father also failed to do so
[33:57] but king of hazaris was mindful of his
[33:59] abilities and even more his limitations
[34:01] he spent his day and night
[34:04] in the presence of his council and
[34:05] trusted these individuals with his life
[34:08] he always kept great men around him
[34:11] men who exceeded in years and
[34:13] experienced knowledge of the law war and
[34:16] tradition
[34:17] nowadays
[34:20] we know so much guys
[34:22] us as youth
[34:24] we know so much am i wrong
[34:26] we have all the information where's my
[34:28] phone hey
[34:30] on in our phones
[34:32] there is so much data
[34:34] in our phones there's so many resources
[34:36] and everything we know so much
[34:39] but a king
[34:41] a rule of 127 provinces
[34:44] kept great men around him
[34:46] people who exceeded in years and
[34:48] experience
[34:50] i seen ministers nowadays forgetting
[34:52] about where they came from
[34:54] i've seen so many different people
[34:56] starting a new church starting a new
[34:58] beginning even though they grew up under
[35:00] the headship of another another great
[35:02] minister an older minister
[35:04] because it's my time now it's my time to
[35:06] shine i didn't like what he said last
[35:08] week i got to find a new church
[35:13] but the king
[35:14] himself stook stood around these great
[35:18] men with more experience
[35:20] was he not the king
[35:23] the crown was not on his was the crown
[35:24] not on his head
[35:26] did he not carry the scepter in his hand
[35:29] was the final decision not his
[35:33] you have a choice
[35:35] keep yourself around wise counsel
[35:38] stop locking yourself in your room and
[35:40] playing fortnight and tick-tock
[35:42] go be around someone who knows a little
[35:44] more than you
[35:45] learn from them grow with them
[35:48] let them correct you
[35:50] stop being so offended
[35:53] stop being so offended
[35:55] it's that simple
[35:58] because there's going to become there's
[35:59] going to come a time and place when
[36:01] trouble will arise
[36:03] there's going to come a time and place
[36:04] where there's going to be heartache and
[36:06] misery
[36:07] you won't find the answer online
[36:09] you'll find it in faith
[36:11] family and community
[36:15] when trouble shook our house
[36:19] my best friend emanuel mutombo passed
[36:22] away
[36:26] i had an option
[36:30] i had an option
[36:32] i live an hour away from everybody in my
[36:34] house
[36:38] i had an option that day
[36:40] on my way to church
[36:42] i'm frantic oh go pick this person up
[36:46] oh no i'm on my way to church i'm there
[36:47] usually a few hours before just so i can
[36:50] set things up in church they're telling
[36:52] me to go pick somebody up
[36:55] and i'm wondering what's going on i'm
[36:57] driving on the highway
[37:02] and when i saw my brother
[37:07] i had to put it in
[37:09] perspective
[37:12] who was still on the throne today
[37:16] who allowed this moment to take place
[37:24] who said yes
[37:28] who gave him life
[37:31] who gave him breath who gave him
[37:32] strength
[37:33] who gave him love who gave him the
[37:35] opportunity to influence the people he
[37:37] was around
[37:39] who did that
[37:43] who created the heavens and the earth
[37:45] who created the sun in the moon
[37:51] who created all these things
[37:55] it's the god that i serve
[37:58] every day it hurts
[38:01] every day it hurts
[38:04] but i have to look in the mirror
[38:07] every morning before i leave my house
[38:11] every time something gets a little
[38:13] difficult every time something gets a
[38:14] little hard i have to look in the mirror

[39:50] momentous contribution in biblical
[39:53] history
[39:56] was an orphan
[39:57] and an orphan is someone who
[39:59] her parents her dad and her mom died
[40:02] or his mom and his dad died so he has no
[40:06] parents
[40:11] she was an orphan
[40:15] and her parents were killed most likely
[40:17] because of the feud between the
[40:18] amalekites and the israelites
[40:21] there was there was war in that land
[40:22] that she was living in
[40:25] and therefore she was adapted adopted by
[40:27] her uncle mordecai
[40:30] the bible describes esther as wise and
[40:32] beautiful
[40:34] how many here are wise and beautiful
[40:37] come on no confidence
[40:40] come on
[40:42] she was appointed to a queen
[40:44] after a public display of disrespect and
[40:47] disobedience by queen queen vashti
[40:51] a decree was sent out
[40:54] and she was exiled
[40:56] and words spread throughout the whole
[40:57] empire
[40:59] and it was this decree was made to put
[41:01] in place to combat the potential
[41:03] disorder that would take place in the
[41:05] household
[41:07] attack the patriarchy
[41:10] this is real this battle is real
[41:13] that's the attack
[41:15] so the persians people who do not who
[41:18] did not trust in yahweh and god but they
[41:20] trust in their pagan gods they said whoa
[41:22] whoa whoa whoa
[41:25] so if if queen vashti can do this we
[41:27] better tighten up our homes
[41:31] and then people around the house like
[41:33] hey honey
[41:34] oh i'm so tired you mind just cooking me
[41:36] a meal
[41:39] she looked at him
[41:41] he looked to her and she's like
[41:43] cook you a meal
[41:45] at this time
[41:48] if vashti wouldn't listen to the king
[41:51] who are you
[41:54] who are you
[41:56] this demand could have been outrageous
[42:00] the king summoning vashti to the place
[42:03] because everybody in the room was drunk
[42:04] they've been drunk for 180 days
[42:08] so quinn vashti
[42:10] was a lady of honor she was a queen
[42:13] she had a high position and she knew
[42:15] these guys were drinking all four
[42:17] hundred six months
[42:18] my goodness these guys got some kidneys
[42:21] for six months
[42:24] in the last week they tell her hey
[42:26] vashti come here the king summons you
[42:29] she's like bro
[42:31] it's been six months
[42:33] and now you want me to because i'm
[42:35] guessing that he didn't even go to her
[42:37] place or her that area the bedroom at
[42:40] all he was in his drunkenness
[42:42] away from her
[42:44] for six months he probably didn't even
[42:45] talk to her one time
[42:48] and now just out of the blue he's just
[42:50] like ah call vashti here he's been
[42:52] drinking for six months bro
[42:55] and now he said bring her here
[42:59] and she's like no she wouldn't do it
[43:01] but god
[43:03] the god of heaven
[43:04] needed that exact instant to take place
[43:08] because somewhere
[43:10] somehow in a little small house
[43:14] on the lower side of this city this
[43:16] great city susa in the slums in the
[43:19] projects
[43:20] probably in the hood
[43:22] he was shaping a little individual a
[43:25] young lady
[43:26] he's just like okay
[43:28] he took out the ruler he's measuring the
[43:30] dimensions on her head
[43:34] she was she was being fitted to wear a
[43:36] crown
[43:37] but he needed vashti to be disobedient
[43:41] am i wrong
[43:43] scripture said it
[43:46] he was shaping this girl's head like oh
[43:48] wow perfect dimensions
[43:51] vashti is going to be disobedient then
[43:52] i'll bring her
[43:56] this is a redemption story
[43:58] this is a love story
[44:00] this was happening the whole time
[44:03] people couldn't see that
[44:06] this old queen bursty oh no oh no
[44:09] the king's like get out of here man
[44:11] he kicked her out
[44:13] he said got out of here that's how he
[44:15] was telling vassa's go
[44:17] he was hurt
[44:19] he was still at war guys let's not
[44:20] forget
[44:23] he was on rece recess or retirement
[44:25] recently you guys know recess he was on
[44:27] recess he was on break
[44:30] he was in the kingdom you know trying to
[44:32] relax decompress they couldn't
[44:34] understand the tactical advancement of
[44:36] this greek military they just couldn't
[44:39] beat them
[44:40] you guys know about the greeks you know
[44:41] about the spartans by any chance anybody
[44:43] know about the spartans these guys are
[44:45] real people
[44:47] this is who king hazaris was fighting he
[44:49] just couldn't get it
[44:51] he needed to be back home he needed to
[44:53] kick vashti out exile her so esther
[44:56] could one day step in
[44:58] because god wanted to redeem
[45:01] the israelites who stayed
[45:03] in susa
[45:06] do you hear that
[45:09] god wanted to redeem the israelites who
[45:11] stayed in susa
[45:16] everyone in susa
[45:18] was not following the trade we're not
[45:21] following the the faith the practices in
[45:24] the religion they were not doing it at
[45:26] all
[45:27] they were living their own life working
[45:29] at nine to five making a little bit of
[45:32] breeze making a little bit of money
[45:34] they started to get a little comfortable
[45:36] driving the mercedes
[45:38] oh i just got the new lexus they were
[45:40] feeling good they will feel
[45:41] uncomfortable
[45:44] but god didn't promise them susa
[45:47] he didn't promise him that area
[45:50] the promises are here
[45:53] joshua and caleb the two smallest guys
[45:55] they weren't even kid they were 40 years
[45:56] old that's what the scripture said he's
[45:58] a grown man but they were tiny
[46:00] they were looking they were climbing
[46:02] climbing climbing
[46:03] whoa this is a place that god wanted us
[46:06] there was a group that of them that went
[46:07] there
[46:08] but only two believed
[46:10] only two believed that they could take
[46:12] that land they looked over you said the
[46:14] big grapes who eats big grapes big
[46:16] people
[46:18] these there were giants there
[46:21] 40 years old grown men
[46:24] were on the commission of a little scout
[46:28] he said whoa look at those big grapes
[46:30] you know
[46:31] they were tweaking they're trying to
[46:32] figure it out
[46:34] and then they saw one guy walking boom
[46:36] boom like
[46:38] and other people the other group that
[46:39] was with him like wow time out
[46:43] god this is what you promised us
[46:46] we
[46:47] us the children of israel are going to
[46:48] defeat those guys
[46:50] oh lord
[46:51] let me pray about that
[46:56] [Applause]
[47:00] the promises was already wrote guys
[47:03] it was already written
[47:06] god doesn't say pray about it
[47:09] some things you just don't have to pray
[47:10] about
[47:12] go and get it
[47:13] go claim it
[47:16] stop fearing
[47:20] don't be afraid
[47:23] fear is paralyzing
[47:26] fight flight
[47:30] stuck
[47:33] psychology right vicky
[47:35] you have options
[47:37] freeze i think that's the words that
[47:38] freeze
[47:39] fight fight or freeze
[47:42] there's always three options god works
[47:44] in threes over and over and over again
[47:47] it's you can fight
[47:49] you can run away
[47:51] or you can
[47:53] you can be stuck
[47:56] we are the people of the open book
[48:00] this is about action church
[48:03] this is about action
[48:07] you gotta move
[48:10] physics say it
[48:11] object emotion stays in motion into a
[48:13] world into rest by some object
[48:16] it's written
[48:18] not just in scripture but in physics
[48:20] you guys will get to physics soon it's
[48:22] an awful time
[48:25] but it's already written in scripture
[48:28] you can trust god about that
[48:31] amen
[48:33] god needed that exact
[48:35] event to take place
[48:37] somehow
[48:39] somewhere
[48:40] some small house
[48:41] in the side of a lower level city
[48:44] who was shaping one individual to wear a
[48:47] crown
[48:49] that literally could be you
[48:51] that literally could be you
[48:55] so after this oh i got to be careful on
[48:57] time too but after this young after this
[49:00] time
[49:01] in estra in esther 2 verse 3 please can
[49:04] i get that esther chapter 2 verse 3.
[49:15] and let the king appoint officers
[49:18] in all the provinces
[49:20] that they may gather
[49:23] together all the fair young virgins onto
[49:26] susan the palace to the house of women
[49:28] unto the custody of heej and the king's
[49:31] chamberlain
[49:32] keeper of woman and let their things for
[49:34] purification be given to them
[49:38] so this is
[49:39] the decree that is written
[49:41] after queen vashti
[49:43] blatantly disrespects the king
[49:49] all the eligible bachelorettes
[49:54] some of you guys know what i'm talking
[49:55] about
[49:57] you need to you need to repent
[50:00] the king sought out a new queen
[50:02] and they were to report to susa
[50:06] let's think about it how many people
[50:07] like math in here
[50:10] i know
[50:12] very far a very small number
[50:14] let's do some math here for a second
[50:17] if this province had 120 if this empire
[50:20] had 127 provinces
[50:23] and they say roughly about 50 million
[50:25] people
[50:27] what what do you how many women do you
[50:28] think there is
[50:30] because in this earth there's about
[50:31] probably 50 percent right 50 women
[50:34] probably even a greater amount
[50:36] so there's 25 to 27 million women that
[50:40] were brought into this selection process
[50:41] for a new queen
[50:44] that's a lot
[50:45] 127 provinces about 25 million women
[50:50] this process was egregious and it was
[50:52] very selective
[50:54] to be a queen was not just to be a wife
[50:56] of a king
[50:58] it was a political position
[51:00] of power and she was also a judge by
[51:02] persian law
[51:05] it's in the bible
[51:07] people like oh there's no way a woman
[51:08] can be a judge
[51:11] the bible says it
[51:13] paragraph 53
[51:15] the prophet says and knoweth it not
[51:19] paragraph 53 says i believe it was
[51:21] esther one of the judges in the bible
[51:26] think about it
[51:29] so words spread about this decree
[51:33] that they're picking a new queen
[51:35] so they snatched esther out of her house
[51:38] like well you qualify as one of the 25
[51:40] million women
[51:42] she didn't have a choice
[51:44] but god was already shaping her crown
[51:46] knowing that one day she will find
[51:48] favor in the presence of the king
[51:52] mordecai her uncle
[51:54] takes her reign from a young age and
[51:55] builds her up
[51:57] teaches her the way of the lord
[51:59] just like blind batmais his grandmother
[52:02] was in his ear
[52:03] speaking to him over and over about the
[52:05] coming messiah
[52:08] who would have thought that he would
[52:10] get his vision back after giving up his
[52:12] dove after giving up his his lamb
[52:15] he gave up his income he gave up his
[52:17] eyes
[52:20] everything everything he could touch
[52:22] everything he could see he gave it all
[52:24] up
[52:27] and who would have thought that just
[52:28] those words that his grandma told him
[52:31] over and over and over again that one
[52:33] day he would bump into the messiah
[52:36] what was that attraction on the mountain
[52:39] why were people gathering
[52:41] people expected him to come on a chariot
[52:44] blazing fire with the sword on fire i'm
[52:47] here to save you i'm here to deliver you
[52:50] but he came on a donkey
[52:54] young people
[52:56] it might not be the way that he came to
[52:58] your father
[52:59] it may not might not be the way that he
[53:01] comes to your mother
[53:03] those moment that you can meet god
[53:06] blind baltimore has met him on a donkey
[53:09] in a packed city crowded what were the
[53:12] chances do the math
[53:15] right
[53:17] very limited
[53:18] the chances were just so small
[53:21] but he was able to grasp onto the
[53:23] promise and receive his sight again
[53:26] mordecai
[53:28] he's working in the kingdom and in the
[53:30] in the palace and i believe he got to
[53:32] that position because
[53:34] of esther you know esther had a little
[53:36] clout now she had a little pull now
[53:38] she's like oh you know that you know
[53:39] that jewish guy who lives on the outside
[53:42] there ah
[53:43] just bring him into the into the
[53:45] into the kingdom i think you would do a
[53:48] you'd be a good writer you'd be a good
[53:49] scribe
[53:50] no one knew the relationship
[53:53] promotion came
[53:55] and he overhears the plot from the
[53:57] king's chamberlain's big thin and
[53:58] terrorists to assassinate the king
[54:01] because of mordecai's vigilance the plot
[54:03] was spoiled
[54:05] and haman the last character i'd like to
[54:07] introduce
[54:09] his plot
[54:11] was to destroy the jews
[54:14] and if you can pull up esther chapter 3
[54:16] verse 1
[54:20] esther chapter 3 verse 1.
[54:27] after these things
[54:29] did king hazarus promote haman the son
[54:31] of hemetha
[54:33] the agagite and advance him to
[54:36] and advance him and set his seat above
[54:38] the princes that were with him
[54:42] haman himself
[54:44] was an aggregite
[54:47] and if you really unders like if you get
[54:49] a little deeper into the scripture you
[54:50] understand and you kind of look at the
[54:52] history i like history a little bit and
[54:55] you kind of break that down again was a
[54:57] was a family that snuck into this
[55:00] kingdom
[55:01] to grow and rule with his persians
[55:07] they had a warm smile
[55:09] you know they probably had like a little
[55:11] flow or something i don't know
[55:13] whatever warm smile it's like
[55:15] but they carried blood in their hand
[55:19] had vengeance on their mind
[55:23] and they came from the amalekite family
[55:26] this particular man came from the
[55:27] malachite family who was supposed to be
[55:30] wiped away if you remember
[55:32] let's go back a little bit first samuel
[55:34] verse 15
[55:38] chapter 15
[55:40] verse 17
[55:42] said the lord anointed you as king over
[55:44] israel he sent you on a mission saying
[55:46] go and completely
[55:48] destroy those wicked people and
[55:50] malachites make war on them until
[55:52] they're wiped out
[55:54] and the prophet lines it up with sin he
[55:57] calls malachite sin
[55:59] it's a deeper thing than that
[56:01] he was the descendant of aggie and his
[56:03] point and his joy his job was to destroy
[56:06] the the jew the israelites in the land
[56:12] they had nothing but hatred in their
[56:14] mind and their bodies
[56:16] and after these things
[56:18] those royal decree
[56:20] and everything that was taking place and
[56:22] happening haman was lifting himself up
[56:25] and growing up in stature and glory and
[56:28] he was just like yeah i'm the man now
[56:31] the blood of my forefathers i will
[56:33] avenge
[56:34] i will get revenge
[56:36] he probably said when he got that job
[56:38] and his whole purpose was destroy the
[56:41] israelites
[56:42] he had nothing else on his mind
[56:45] he was given a signet to write a decree
[56:48] after his sweet spoke to the king he's
[56:50] like ah let's destroy all the jews that
[56:53] live in the land
[56:55] because they're hoarding all this kind
[56:56] of money all this resources we need to
[56:58] take those resources and bring those and
[57:00] use them for war
[57:03] and that's what he told the king and he
[57:04] convinced him and the king was like all
[57:06] right
[57:07] here
[57:09] verse 10.
[57:12] so the king took his signet ring from
[57:15] his finger
[57:16] and gave it to him and son of hamedthar
[57:18] the aggra guy the enemy
[57:20] of the jews
[57:23] after he proposed i'll give you ten 000
[57:25] talents which is in calculation 3.48
[57:28] billion dollars in u.s money today if we
[57:31] calculate that
[57:33] i'll give you that if we can just wipe
[57:35] away the jews
[57:37] this is the same adversary that was in
[57:40] heaven this was the same adversary that
[57:43] was in the garden
[57:45] the same exact spirit
[57:47] jumped to one another jumped to one
[57:49] another
[57:50] with his purpose to annihilate god's
[57:52] people
[57:53] you are god's people you are god's
[57:55] chosen one
[57:56] the enemy is adamant he has all the
[57:59] resources
[58:01] they're at his disposal
[58:02] the land is his but our heart your heart
[58:05] is god's
[58:07] and that's what he wants to take away
[58:08] from us
[58:10] the decree was sent out through the land
[58:12] there was no email back then there was
[58:13] no snapchat there was no twitter not
[58:15] even facebook
[58:17] even i know it sounds a little old but
[58:18] so they went on horseback to 127
[58:21] provinces and told them about this great
[58:23] day oh no there's a decree they're going
[58:25] to kill us they're going to kill all the
[58:27] jews and this wasn't just in susa
[58:30] haman's purpose was to kill the jews
[58:32] that left the land
[58:34] that are inhabiting in jerusalem the
[58:36] people in the promised land
[58:39] he wanted to kill them too that's what
[58:41] he wrote down
[58:42] the king said here's my ring
[58:45] vesti left me
[58:48] he was in a hard place his mind was was
[58:50] he wasn't thinking straight he gave his
[58:53] power to a man who wanted to kill and
[58:55] annihilate the enemy comes to kill steal
[58:57] and destroy
[58:59] and sometimes he's given the ring
[59:01] on your life
[59:03] but do you know whose army you're
[59:05] fighting
[59:10] every province and every ruler
[59:13] understood this edict
[59:15] and that day when the word spread around
[59:18] there was great mourning with fasting
[59:20] and weeping and wailing many laying
[59:23] sackcloth and ashes
[59:25] many people had their burning bush
[59:27] moment when that decree came out in
[59:29] these provinces
[59:32] and that day they finally remembered who
[59:34] they were
[59:36] amnesia
[59:37] disappeared
[59:39] they just said oh
[59:41] yeah
[59:42] i'm an israelite
[59:44] god called me for this purpose he
[59:46] already gave me a promise and he already
[59:47] gave me all those things
[59:50] ah okay lord please please god almighty
[59:52] please of heaven
[59:54] i promise you that if you give us life
[59:57] we won't sin
[59:58] anymore just like we learned this
[1:00:01] morning we make these empty promises
[1:00:06] chapter 4 verse 14
[1:00:09] just have one more scripture and one
[1:00:10] more quote in conclusion
[1:00:12] for if you remain silent at this time
[1:00:15] relief and deliverance
[1:00:17] for the jews will rise from another
[1:00:19] place
[1:00:20] but for you and your families will
[1:00:21] perish
[1:00:22] and who knows that you have come to your
[1:00:24] royal position for atomic this
[1:00:27] haman was at the gate
[1:00:29] he tore his clothes at the noobs
[1:00:31] he was rocked he was shook
[1:00:35] he said they're coming to kill us the
[1:00:36] british are coming
[1:00:38] in his mind like they knew it they set a
[1:00:40] date they set a time they said this is
[1:00:42] your annihilation
[1:00:45] this is the end time church
[1:00:49] the annihilation draws not
[1:00:52] not all the time it has to be physical
[1:00:54] it's spiritual annihilation
[1:00:56] we can be dead spiritually but alive
[1:00:58] physically
[1:01:01] it's coming it's already here
[1:01:05] it's already here
[1:01:08] and finally when they took the news to
[1:01:11] heart
[1:01:12] that's when they began
[1:01:13] fasting
[1:01:14] they began weeping and crying out
[1:01:17] the bible doesn't say they prayed
[1:01:20] that's kind of that to me that was like
[1:01:21] whoa i was looking i'm trying to read
[1:01:23] i'm like whoa where did they pray
[1:01:25] but they were crying out
[1:01:27] sometimes it's the tears
[1:01:30] sometimes it's the tears
[1:01:34] god is not looking for an illustrious
[1:01:36] prayer he's not looking for a theologian
[1:01:37] to break things down into details and
[1:01:39] details and details
[1:01:41] john the baptist came out of the
[1:01:43] woods with
[1:01:44] with with a big beard
[1:01:46] terrible looking clothes
[1:01:48] but that fire that laid within his
[1:01:50] stomach
[1:01:53] that commission make way make way
[1:01:57] the coming of the messiah jose
[1:02:00] everywhere he went
[1:02:02] he was taking down these big places and
[1:02:04] telling them the messiah is coming the
[1:02:06] messiah is coming make way
[1:02:10] he was telling people warning them about
[1:02:12] the coming annihilation
[1:02:14] for some people believe that but peace
[1:02:16] was actually coming
[1:02:18] it's crazy
[1:02:20] god keeps his word
[1:02:24] paragraph 127
[1:02:26] and 128
[1:02:28] i actually go there
[1:02:29] what would your grandfather ever said
[1:02:32] if your great-grandfather told him
[1:02:34] that there will come a time when
[1:02:36] carriages would go on the street without
[1:02:38] horses
[1:02:40] we would have laughed at him maybe
[1:02:42] but they're right
[1:02:45] what 129 what about these other things
[1:02:47] that would take place
[1:02:49] all of these great prophecies has been
[1:02:51] made out but here
[1:02:54] and someday jesus will come all that
[1:02:56] glorious majesty of the son of god he
[1:02:58] promised he would do it he promised he
[1:03:00] would judge sin and brother brennan cuts
[1:03:02] his hands together two times
[1:03:05] thank you
[1:03:06] brother will you either accept god's
[1:03:09] provided sacrifice for sin or you will
[1:03:11] stand in judgment alone

[1:08:41] she tells her chamberlains and she tells
[1:08:43] the children of israel and the bland
[1:08:46] let's fast

[1:09:10] she remembered who she was
[1:09:12] for a time like this she was called
[1:09:17] so she walks into the kingdom
[1:09:20] she bows her head
[1:09:23] defies all the laws defies all the rules
[1:09:26] and a sword comes towards the head
[1:09:28] because it doesn't matter if she's a

[1:09:31] cannot override it it just can just add
[1:09:35] more to it

[1:10:18] so many different things
[1:10:21] he didn't need to be with esther
[1:10:23] but her her her beauty
