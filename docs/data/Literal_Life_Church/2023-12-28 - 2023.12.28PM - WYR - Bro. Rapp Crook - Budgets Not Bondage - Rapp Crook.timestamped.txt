[0:01] [Applause]
[0:04] well I'm grateful for the Applause it's
[0:06] not usually what you get when you start
[0:08] talking about budgeting you might get
[0:10] Applause at the beginning but not at the
[0:12] end so uh anyhow well welcome um so
[0:17] we'll try to jump right into things I
[0:19] don't want to take anybody's uh take too
[0:22] much time this this afternoon you were
[0:24] all very patient with me this morning I
[0:26] appreciate that but um our OB itive uh
[0:31] this afternoon is uh try to introduce
[0:33] you to some some good habits I'm by no
[0:35] means a uh a a fiscal Guru or a
[0:38] financial uh know at all I'm not that at
[0:40] all um this was one of those sessions
[0:43] that the Lord had kind of put on my
[0:44] heart but I was thinking man I could uh
[0:47] name a number of folks who' be much
[0:48] better uh doing it than I am but um you
[0:52] got you get me today um this kind of
[0:55] comes out of an assignment that I give
[0:57] my senior economics class when we're uh
[1:00] um going through the last semester
[1:03] before they graduate so I give my
[1:05] apologies I've got a couple former
[1:06] students here today but usually you
[1:09] forget everything after you get your
[1:10] diploma anyway so it'll probably be okay
[1:13] we'll we'll uh we'll see but um before
[1:16] we uh before we start maybe we can just
[1:18] stand and uh take a look in our Bibles
[1:21] to the Book of Luke chapter
[1:26] 14 our uh our title today if I have to
[1:29] do a title would be um budgets not
[1:31] bondage uh usually people consider a uh
[1:34] a budget a form of bondage but uh we
[1:37] trust it uh it
[1:41] isn't Luke chapter 14 and verse
[1:46] 28 for which of you intending to build a
[1:49] tower sth not down first and count the
[1:52] cost whether you have sufficient to
[1:54] finish it lest happily or avoiding the
[1:57] situation that after you've laid the
[1:59] found foundation and not and you're not
[2:01] able to finish it although behold it
[2:03] begin to mock him saying this man began
[2:06] to build and was not able to finish it
[2:10] so our our Focus here this morning is
[2:12] from that first verse in 28 it's
[2:15] important to take the time to count the
[2:17] cost whether we have enough uh to finish
[2:20] what we've started upon and then uh our
[2:23] next scripture will be on the screen
[2:24] Proverbs 22 and: 7 the rich rule over
[2:28] the poor and the borrower is servant to
[2:31] the lender and our Focus today is we
[2:34] want to avoid that kind of bondage
[2:37] because debt is bondage let's pray
[2:41] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[2:42] goodness to us thank you for your grace
[2:44] thank you for the opportunity Lord uh to
[2:46] come and gather together here at the
[2:47] Turning of the Year Lord I pray that
[2:49] this would be a time we can kind of get
[2:51] uh recalibrated um refreshed and ready
[2:54] to go into the new year Lord I pray that
[2:56] you would grant us uh wisdom this
[2:58] afternoon and Grant me Clarity I pray in
[3:00] Jesus name amen you may be
[3:03] seated so I kind of look at the uh at
[3:05] the phase of time U of Our Lives that
[3:08] we're in um kind of at the beginning of
[3:12] a race that we're running we finished
[3:14] high school or close finishing High
[3:16] School uh we're starting to uh um have
[3:19] the responsibility of uh paying for our
[3:22] own some of our own stuff we get some of
[3:24] our own money and things like that and
[3:26] we're ready to start out and we want to
[3:28] be able to start off and run the race
[3:30] without dragging this ball and chain of
[3:33] debt behind them I uh um just a short
[3:37] anecdote as we get started um I know of
[3:40] a um a friend of mine um he got married
[3:44] and it was a wonderful uh wedding
[3:46] ceremony um they were absolutely bride
[3:49] and Grom were completely in love and
[3:50] they are still in love but um after they
[3:54] got married the husband found out and
[3:57] they could have just easily been the
[3:59] other way around in this case the
[4:00] husband found out that the wife's car
[4:02] wasn't paid for they thought they had
[4:05] everything planned for all of a sudden
[4:07] they realized hey I've got $10,000 in
[4:09] debt but I didn't know was there I've
[4:12] got a car payment I didn't realize was
[4:14] there and all of a sudden we thought
[4:16] things were going to be one way starting
[4:17] off and they weren't we just kind of
[4:20] want to uh share some uh principles to
[4:22] hopefully we can avoid that kind of a
[4:25] situation ourselves we kind of introduce
[4:27] ourselves to a good habit which is is
[4:29] budgeting so we can avoid the bad habit
[4:32] which is debt just uh I was this is a a
[4:36] Christmas Eve article on the credit card
[4:38] spending in the United States for many
[4:41] US consumers maintaining their
[4:43] Lifestyles while grappling with
[4:45] inflation means relying more on credit
[4:47] cards how many of us have realized or
[4:49] felt prices going up in the last
[4:52] year yeah um definitely even if you
[4:54] don't pay for your own groceries you
[4:55] still feel prices going up when prices
[4:58] go up and you want to maintain your
[5:00] lifestyle you've got um you would think
[5:02] you had two options you could either
[5:04] increase your income to continue paying
[5:07] for the same things you're used to
[5:08] paying for or you could decrease your
[5:10] spending that would be the normal way of
[5:12] looking at it but Americans have come up
[5:14] with a third option and that's just
[5:17] increasing your debt it's interesting
[5:19] comparing the uh our our American
[5:21] mentality uh with a European mentality
[5:24] my my wife is Dutch we've got lots of we
[5:26] live there for seven years and um in
[5:29] holl uh a year or two ago heating prices
[5:32] went through the roof it was very very
[5:34] expensive they had great inflation when
[5:36] that kind of thing would happen in
[5:38] America prices go up really high we just
[5:40] get an extra line of credit and pay for
[5:43] it in Europe they actually did something
[5:46] revolutionary they were turning their
[5:48] thermostats down they were wearing
[5:51] sweaters wearing extra extra clothes
[5:53] around the house cuz the normal two
[5:56] options is either increase income
[5:58] decrease spend spending that was what
[6:00] the Europeans looking at Americans we
[6:02] just grabbed another credit card and
[6:04] increase our debt and if you look at a
[6:09] here's a a little graph about uh
[6:11] American credit card debt you see after
[6:14] 2020 credit card did actually
[6:17] spiked as much as I'd like to believe it
[6:19] it wasn't because of good American
[6:21] spending habits all of a sudden it was
[6:23] because covid relief we get all these
[6:25] checks from the government uh for Co
[6:27] relief and instead of spending them like
[6:29] we were supposed to to keep the economy
[6:31] going um people paid off credit cards
[6:34] with them but you can see once the co
[6:36] relief
[6:37] died American spending went back to the
[6:39] old habits and credit card debt has
[6:41] increased even before the preco um level
[6:45] so the average individual credit card
[6:46] balance in the United States and I
[6:48] apologize for uh Canadians South
[6:51] Africans um other folks of other
[6:54] nationalities this is going to be a an
[6:56] American Center topic the principles
[6:57] will be more or less uh uh convertible
[7:00] though $6,000 in credit card debt for
[7:04] household that's over
[7:05] $10,000 and what is the average uh um
[7:09] interest rate for credit cards uh for
[7:12] mid December according to Forbes
[7:13] Magazine the average interest rate for
[7:15] credit cards if you carry your balance
[7:17] over is
[7:20] 27.8% that's a
[7:22] lot that's a a lot of money um and more
[7:27] and more people are turning to that
[7:30] um 84% of Americans have at least one
[7:33] credit card most of us do how many of us
[7:36] have a credit card I yeah a lot of us
[7:39] have have have have a credit card 84% of
[7:41] us have at least one um
[7:44] 48% of people who have at least one
[7:46] credit card also have a balance that's
[7:50] being carried over each month so how
[7:53] many you have a credit card raise your
[7:55] hand okay you folks on this side put
[7:57] your hands down that side is carrying a
[8:00] balance over each month that they're
[8:01] spending 27.8% on that's what the
[8:04] proportions are like half of the people
[8:06] who have a credit card actually carry a
[8:08] balance over each month that they're
[8:10] spending um that they're not able to pay
[8:13] off and uh 14% of people who have these
[8:17] credit cards um have to use credit cards
[8:21] in order to pay for a
[8:23] $400
[8:24] emergency $400 emergencies aren't that
[8:27] big of an emergency there are a lot of
[8:29] emergencies that are cost a lot more
[8:31] than 400 bucks and what happens if if
[8:33] it's an emergency and you have to get uh
[8:36] new tires 400 bucks for a set of new
[8:39] tires it's probably on the low side but
[8:41] um we put it on our credit card because
[8:43] we couldn't afford paying it off at the
[8:46] end of the month do you think we'll be
[8:47] able to pay off the credit card balance
[8:50] for $400 if we didn't have the money at
[8:52] the beginning of the month to start off
[8:54] with we probably don't have it at the
[8:55] end of the month either so all of a
[8:57] sudden that $400 set of tires we don't
[9:00] we're not able to pay it off we just pay
[9:02] the minimum off 27.8% interest gets
[9:05] charged on that I think that $400 set of
[9:08] tires just cost
[9:10] $500 and if you pay the minimum balance
[9:12] again the next month that $400 set of
[9:14] tires going to cost six within a few
[9:17] months that's a really expensive set of
[9:19] tires that you uh if we just saved up a
[9:22] little bit we could have saved ourselves
[9:23] a lot of
[9:24] misery so this beautiful couch sticker
[9:27] price might be $1,200 I'm probably
[9:29] dreaming on that but um say we don't
[9:32] we're not able to afford it we put it on
[9:34] our credit card we miss the first
[9:36] payment how much does this said that how
[9:38] much does this beautiful couch actually
[9:40] end up costing us well after missing the
[9:42] first payment with a 27% interest rate
[9:45] that $1,200 couch is now
[9:48] $1,500 a month later it'll be
[9:51] $1,800 a month later it'll be over
[9:53] $2,000 it was a gift that just keeps on
[9:56] giving and this couch you could put it
[9:58] on Marketplace and and try to sell it
[9:59] but you're not going to get the $1,200
[10:02] out of it so credit is a way of uh
[10:05] getting what we want now but you're
[10:08] gradually just it's kind of like uh in
[10:11] the old days if a patient was sick they
[10:14] bleed them right and just hope that they
[10:16] bleeding them they'll they'll they'll
[10:17] get better well that's what credit is
[10:19] doing it's just gradually bleeding us
[10:22] and we're living the life we want to
[10:23] live now and then hopefully we can pay
[10:26] for it in the future that is however
[10:34] unlikely Jin Z let's see what j z as to
[10:37] how jinz is taking uh handling credit
[10:39] those are 18 to 29 year olds between
[10:43] 2021 and 23 Jin Z increased its credit
[10:46] card balance by
[10:51] 174% that's a lot a lot more credit is
[10:55] being uh used the average jzer owes over
[11:00] $166,000 that's the average one in here
[11:03] is about $116,000 in debt of that
[11:06] $116,000 $3,000 if it's from credit
[11:09] cards what could the rest of it be
[11:13] from Cars student loans those are all
[11:17] things that uh we we'll talk about cars
[11:20] here in a little bit but um cars can eat
[11:23] up your budget and it might not be the
[11:25] car that you actually need it might be
[11:28] the car that you want
[11:29] but it's just sucking um sucking the
[11:32] life out of your your budget for this
[11:34] $3,000 credit card de that the average
[11:37] gen Zer OES this $3,000 Visa balance
[11:40] let's just go through this uh game
[11:43] again at the end of the month you're
[11:45] proud that you're able to actually put
[11:47] something on that you you put $100
[11:49] toward that minimum monthly payment what
[11:52] happens to your Visa balance it's not
[11:55] $2,900 we wish it were we just paid $100
[11:58] of a off but that 27% interest kicks in
[12:02] and no longer is it 3,000 or 2900 it is
[12:07] now drum roll
[12:12] $3,683 and you wonder what was on the
[12:16] Visa balance what do we use our credit
[12:19] cards for we use it to go to McDonald's
[12:24] all of a sudden that Big Mac is getting
[12:25] more and more expensive we used to buy
[12:27] some new shoes we used us to buy gas we
[12:30] used to buy all kinds of things because
[12:31] we get points for right we get points
[12:33] for this points for that points for that
[12:36] the more points we get from a card
[12:37] usually the higher the interest rate is
[12:39] and but if we're not able to make that
[12:41] monthly payment and half of the people
[12:43] who have one credit card don't pay off
[12:46] the balance so they're paying something
[12:48] else on that you're just digging a hole
[12:50] deeper and deeper and deeper at a time
[12:53] in their life and we're trying to set
[12:55] off on our race into adulthood and we're
[12:58] laid down by this big chain of debt at
[13:00] the end and that's what we want to
[13:03] avoid so Visa balances credit card
[13:07] balances that's a a favorite way of
[13:09] achieving what we want now um however um
[13:13] uh The Lending uh sharks are are great
[13:15] at coming up with new products to help
[13:17] us out and I had not heard of this until
[13:19] relatively recently shop and slay with
[13:23] afterpay buy now pay later anybody ever
[13:26] heard of buy now pay later
[13:29] I actually had to grabb some articles
[13:31] and read about what this is but um in
[13:35] order to do this byy now pay later just
[13:37] sign up for this kind of a service um
[13:40] and I'm not recommending it um all you
[13:42] have to do all you have to do is that
[13:46] when you check out at Amazon or go to
[13:48] cooh whever else you can have the option
[13:50] buy now pay later they say it's like the
[13:52] old fashion layaway anybody here
[13:54] remember layaway from yeah but when you
[13:56] put something on layaway you put put the
[13:58] money and then once you finished paying
[14:00] it off then you got the item right that
[14:02] was oldfashioned layaway well buy now
[14:05] pay later you get it now but you just
[14:07] it's divided into several monthly
[14:09] payments the first thing you do you put
[14:11] in your credit card information or if
[14:13] you don't have a credit card you can put
[14:14] your debit card information in and that
[14:17] service conveniently will automatically
[14:19] charge you whenever the date for that
[14:21] installment loan is due so if you buy a
[14:23] $200 pair
[14:25] of shoes do shoes cost $200
[14:29] wow wow wow $200 pair of shoes so they
[14:33] say hey 200 bucks is a lot to pay at one
[14:36] time for a pair of shoes I would say
[14:37] that as well um so they would say let's
[14:40] just split this up into four monthly
[14:42] payments you pay 50 bucks today and
[14:44] you're able to take your beautiful new
[14:46] shoes home in time for the banquet and
[14:49] then in 3 weeks you'll get charged
[14:52] another
[14:53] $50 in six weeks you get charged another
[14:55] $50 and the nine weeks you'll get
[14:57] charged the last your dollars and you
[14:59] got your shoes paid for hopefully
[15:01] they're still good as new and that's how
[15:04] the buy now pay later scheme works all
[15:06] you do is put your information in and
[15:09] the service will conveniently charge you
[15:11] at those dates they won't uh trust that
[15:13] you will remember the time period
[15:15] because you probably won't um they'll
[15:16] just take the money out of your account
[15:19] and make sure that it gets paid off no
[15:22] interest charged here and they're and
[15:24] they're billing it as uh no fees no
[15:27] interest Etc but let's just kind of see
[15:30] how it works a little bit more a quarter
[15:33] of respondents when who were surveyed
[15:35] about the B now pater app said their
[15:37] total debt increased after using the app
[15:40] that makes sense who actually pays for
[15:42] it uh the buy now pator apps aren't
[15:45] doing it out of the goodness of their
[15:46] heart and they're charging the store for
[15:48] the service because the stores no people
[15:50] who use buy now pay later are going to
[15:52] buy a lot more stuff so the stores will
[15:54] be paying about 9% I think of the
[15:57] purchase price will go from the store to
[15:59] the buy now pay later app and
[16:02] everybody's trusting because it's on
[16:03] credit you'll end up buying more more
[16:06] than 20% ended up using credit cards to
[16:08] pay down their buy now pay later
[16:11] balances so we're doing this as a way to
[16:13] avoid the dangers of credit card debt
[16:16] but at least one and five don't have the
[16:18] funds at the end of the period anyhow
[16:21] and they're still putting it onto a
[16:24] credit card and what's more um when you
[16:27] go into a store and they ask ask um
[16:30] you're buying a bigger ticket item and
[16:32] they ask you hey how about would you
[16:34] like get 20% off your purchase or 10%
[16:36] off your purchase yeah I'd love to get
[16:37] 10% off my purchase what's the easiest
[16:39] way to get 10% off your purchase at
[16:41] Macy's or pennies well get the store
[16:42] credit
[16:43] card so you do that um as they're hoping
[16:47] that you'll come back and put more and
[16:48] more things on um credit um you get that
[16:52] store credit card and I forgot where I
[16:53] was going with
[16:56] that right when you go and get that
[16:58] credit card uh that new one they'll do a
[17:00] credit check on you are you actually
[17:02] able to um are are you worthy of getting
[17:05] an extra line of credit you may or may
[17:07] not be approved buy now pay later it's
[17:10] pretty much automatic approval because
[17:13] the system is separate from the credit
[17:14] card bureaus so it's easy then for you I
[17:17] mean this easy in a bad way it's easy to
[17:20] get the extra money because we're not
[17:22] checking to see whether you'd be able to
[17:24] pay it off in the end anyhow so um
[17:30] they talk about hidden interest with the
[17:32] buy now pay later plans it's hidden
[17:34] interest because a lot of the time
[17:36] you're not able to pay it off after the
[17:38] period of time so the hidden interest is
[17:40] because you're ending up paying it off
[17:42] with a credit card that's charging your
[17:44] interest
[17:46] anyhow also like I said when you get a
[17:49] bay now buy now pay later um app going
[17:52] you can get one going and you've got one
[17:56] payment schedule and then I go somewhere
[17:58] else I get a second Bal payador app
[18:00] going with a second set of deadlines I
[18:02] can get a third Bal payador app going
[18:04] with a third set of deadlines before you
[18:06] know it I've got like three or four or
[18:08] five different deadlines I've got to
[18:10] make sure I've got money in my account
[18:11] to meet it's hard keeping all that stuff
[18:15] straight and a lot of the time it is
[18:17] going to uh it is going to sync you
[18:19] because um you're going to miss
[18:21] something you'll uh the money will be
[18:24] drawn from your checking account anyway
[18:26] and before you know it you might have a
[18:27] check Bal ing extra fees and things like
[18:30] that but all it's doing is helping us to
[18:33] maintain our lifestyle um and promising
[18:36] us little difficulty along the way
[18:38] however Jin Z that's most of us in here
[18:42] has nearly tripled its overall debt load
[18:45] in the past two years a recent Lending
[18:48] Tree survey shows and this is that that
[18:51] that's us tripling our debt load and at
[18:54] the time in their life and we're just
[18:55] starting our race into adulthood we're
[18:58] starting it like this and this is
[19:02] something I this is the picture that I
[19:04] want us to avoid I don't want us to
[19:07] enter into adulthood enter into marriage
[19:10] um with these uh with these debts some
[19:12] debts we take on um you can look you
[19:16] might be able to look on as more of an
[19:17] investment like a a student loan however
[19:20] I'd say with even with student loans be
[19:22] very I wouldn't go into student loan
[19:24] debt to get your major in art history
[19:27] you need toay have something you can
[19:29] actually be going into and using and
[19:31] being aware this is money is I I will
[19:33] need to be paying off soon and uh um
[19:37] you're you're uh you're you're going be
[19:40] paying off on this in your future and if
[19:42] you if you can uh avoid it by all means
[19:45] uh by all means do
[19:48] so twice as many marriages are starting
[19:52] off with death than they used to 43% of
[19:55] people married 25 years or more start
[19:58] started off with
[20:00] debt but people married 5 years or less
[20:03] so recently married 86% of them almost
[20:07] all of them are starting off with debt
[20:10] and again some of that um now it might
[20:13] be hard to avoid but if we can avoid
[20:15] getting off starting off with debt like
[20:17] this B that's that's a great thing to
[20:20] avoid because um most conflict within
[20:22] the marriage I know this isn't a
[20:24] marriage seminar this is not a a young
[20:26] couple seminar this is a a young people
[20:28] similar but we're looking to the Future
[20:30] most conflicts within the marriage are
[20:32] about money and all the married people
[20:34] said amen or is it just my marriage
[20:37] that's
[20:38] that no um most conflicts in the
[20:42] marriage are about money and after
[20:44] adultery money is the leading cause of
[20:47] divorce so I'm thinking hey I'm in this
[20:50] age of life where I'm getting ready to
[20:52] sit off my race into adulthood let's
[20:54] clear the table of all these things that
[20:55] could trip me up because we if if we can
[20:58] avoid this debt let's do
[21:01] that speaking of marriage heading into
[21:03] marriage over half of Couples married 5
[21:07] years or less say that some of their
[21:09] wedding expenses were covered with a
[21:11] credit
[21:12] card and 73% of those couples say they
[21:16] regret the
[21:19] decision why does it have to be that
[21:21] expensed I I'm all for a beautiful
[21:23] wedding I think marriage is something
[21:25] that that should be prized and we should
[21:27] make a big deal about it this something
[21:29] people have been true to each other
[21:31] they're doing things right they're going
[21:32] to get married let's let's show why this
[21:34] is special it doesn't have to cost
[21:36] $50,000 though there are a lot of other
[21:40] ways of of of of of doing that and we
[21:43] can have a have a great to a great
[21:45] wedding but do I really want to go
[21:47] $5,000 in debt $10,000 in debt just to
[21:50] have a nice evening when I will be
[21:53] paying on that evening you don't want to
[21:56] be talking about that how expensive your
[21:58] wedding evening was on your fifth
[22:00] anniversary that's not the situation you
[22:02] want to get
[22:09] into so like I said more couples in the
[22:11] younger Generations accumulated debt to
[22:14] pay for their wedding than older
[22:15] generations and that
[22:18] 41% say they felt pressured to spend 41%
[22:21] of those married 5 years or less say
[22:23] they felt pressured to spend more than
[22:24] than they could afford on their wedding
[22:27] I just when I read the that what would
[22:29] be pressuring us to spend more than we
[22:30] could afford on our wedding my hunch
[22:34] would be Facebook Instagram Etc because
[22:39] you see the beautiful weddings are so
[22:41] and so ad so and so ad so and so we got
[22:42] to keep up with the Joneses it's not
[22:44] worth it but that is the observations of
[22:48] somebody who's over the hill I feeling
[22:50] like but the the uh the purpose of this
[22:53] is we need to be intentional with our
[22:55] money if we don't tell our money
[22:57] anywhere to go our money's going to be
[22:59] the boss over us if we don't Master our
[23:01] money our money will Master us and you
[23:03] can see here the guy pulling this
[23:05] beautiful nice car this is his his his
[23:07] dream car but it becomes his burden
[23:09] after a while you got the the the lady
[23:11] pulling out this beautiful iPhone that
[23:13] she sprayed P SP an iPhone new iPhone
[23:17] does it cost $1,000 is that really true
[23:20] $1,000 for an iPhone I that's incredible
[23:24] so you you you pay for it then you're
[23:26] just driving that's a that' be like
[23:28] carrying a 10 pound lump of gold in your
[23:30] pocket all day long it's an expensive
[23:32] thing and then your kid drops it um but
[23:35] yeah this is a lot of money uh you got
[23:37] this great house your dream house or
[23:39] this great couch but you're chained to
[23:41] your stuff and your stuff becomes your
[23:43] master and of you become a master over
[23:46] it and that just is illustrative of the
[23:49] principle that the borrower is servant
[23:52] to the
[23:52] lender now what I want to talk about
[23:55] today is uh hopefully we can kind of see
[23:57] now that there is a a need to talk about
[24:00] finances a need to talk about uh
[24:03] stewardship um I want to talk about um
[24:05] budgeting I like to go to this script
[24:07] here from Proverbs
[24:09] 27:23 as the reason why we budget be
[24:14] thou diligent to know the state of your
[24:15] flocks and look well to your herds
[24:18] you've got to know how your household's
[24:21] going on if you got a farm you got to
[24:23] how are your cows doing how are your
[24:25] sheep doing is there an infection going
[24:27] rampid you want to jump on it take care
[24:29] of it as soon as you can we're not
[24:30] Farmers now because this this agrarian
[24:33] symbol might not speak to us so much but
[24:36] um how many of us subscribe to
[24:39] things yeah um how many of us try those
[24:42] uh um one week um uh test period and
[24:46] then you forget about it happens
[24:49] sometimes too you have we don't have a
[24:51] herd of cattle but we might have a herd
[24:53] of subscription plans that we forget
[24:56] about and does that cost cost us money
[24:58] it sure does so be diligent to know the
[25:01] state of your finances because what you
[25:03] don't know can hurt you so it's
[25:07] important for us to we apply this going
[25:10] through our monthly expenses seeing
[25:12] what's where the money is going um
[25:15] what's left if anything what we're going
[25:16] to do with it uh Hosea said my people
[25:19] are destroyed for lack of knowledge and
[25:21] um our budgets are destroyed for lack of
[25:23] knowledge also it's a really really good
[25:26] practice uh to have to go through your
[25:29] bank accounts and I use a I use a
[25:33] budgeting app it's called every dollar
[25:35] it's a I pay $45 a year to have it
[25:38] connected to my uh to my bank account so
[25:41] every transaction gets dumped right in
[25:43] there 45 bucks a year that's a lot of
[25:45] money yes but I just give up nine
[25:47] cappuccinos throughout the year and I've
[25:50] paid for it that's how you take care of
[25:52] that um coffee costs a lot but if I
[25:56] could get this budgeting app and it
[25:58] works nice I can see everything that cuz
[26:00] you know what
[26:03] sometimes we're not always um we buy
[26:06] things without always checking with the
[26:07] other spouse not the big ticket items
[26:11] but um you know what Amazon Prime it's
[26:14] so easy to order things on there and you
[26:16] could forget to talk about it but if
[26:18] it's on that budgeting app it gets
[26:20] connected you can see where your money
[26:21] is going because a lot of the times um
[26:23] usually in a marriage in a relationship
[26:26] one partner is the spender the other
[26:27] spouse is the uh is the is the saver and
[26:31] the spender they're just doing what
[26:32] comes naturally to them they really
[26:34] don't mean anything bad by it they just
[26:37] don't
[26:38] realize that maybe the money is not
[26:40] there right then so this is where it's a
[26:42] partnership that hey we've got this got
[26:44] to see where the money is and hey if we
[26:45] can we can get it let's go get it if not
[26:47] we just kind of wait because what you
[26:51] don't know can hurt you so I'd like to
[26:54] see if we can um get some participation
[26:57] paent here I passed out a budgeting uh
[27:00] worksheet and I'd like to uh fill this
[27:03] in um somewhat interactively I am I'm
[27:06] happy to hold a monologue but my
[27:07] students give me like negative ratings
[27:09] for my monologues so we will be a little
[27:12] more interesting if I get some feedback
[27:14] from you um we're going to kind of walk
[27:17] through the budgeting worksheet usually
[27:20] when you make a budget you start with
[27:21] your income in this case we've got so
[27:24] many people here we don't we're not
[27:25] going to put income in there yet we're
[27:26] just going to see what does it actually
[27:28] cost to live in
[27:30] 2023 U this is what this is assignment I
[27:33] give my senior students they have to um
[27:35] go home with their parents to their
[27:37] parents and they work on this for an
[27:39] evening or two and they have to figure
[27:42] out what does it cost for a um a family
[27:45] of two a couple to live on and think
[27:47] imagine yourself 5 years after you
[27:49] graduate what might it be costing you to
[27:52] live and that's what we want to uh take
[27:55] a look at now so can we switch over to
[27:57] to the Excel sheet uh so we will uh
[28:01] since we don't know our know our income
[28:04] I'm going to leave our tithe and
[28:05] offering blank for the moment but what
[28:07] is a uh what is our principle of giving
[28:09] how much should we be giving in in
[28:12] tithes yeah very good that's our that's
[28:14] our our 10% 100% of our income comes
[28:19] from God everything we receive
[28:21] everything we have comes from the Lord
[28:24] God asks for just 10% of it back and
[28:27] then we can give offering on top of that
[28:29] because if we've given the 10% back we
[28:31] really haven't offered anything yet
[28:32] that's just what God has asked us to
[28:34] give back to them and then we are
[28:36] stewards over the the other
[28:38] 90% And that's what we're going to talk
[28:40] about now what what happens with the
[28:42] other 90% so we'll leave the tithe and
[28:44] offering for for a moment we'll leave
[28:46] savings for a moment but um what does it
[28:50] what uh any any any ideas what it might
[28:53] cost to uh for a young couple to be to
[28:55] have a have a small mortgage that's the
[28:57] amount of debt you have to buy a home or
[29:00] rent for a small apartment any ideas I
[29:02] know we live in different regions so
[29:04] we'll be taking rough estimates here um
[29:07] what might we expect to pay for a uh for
[29:10] a small apartment or or a home any ideas
[29:12] if you have an Apartments we
[29:14] can
[29:16] $1,400 14 and this is
[29:19] where like uh urban areas so say he said
[29:23] $1,400
[29:25] $1,500 that's a that's a that's a pretty
[29:27] hefty chunk of change um so let's go
[29:30] Ahad and put in $1,500 in there uh Ian
[29:34] if you're from a little more rural area
[29:36] like where I live I know little
[29:38] one-bedroom apartment or something that
[29:39] some of our starters might have you're
[29:41] looking looking at close to $1,000 but
[29:44] um it's not cheap it's not cheap so uh
[29:47] we got uh so let's go and scroll up a
[29:50] little bit so we're expecting mortgage
[29:51] or rent to be uh $1,500 and rent yeah
[29:55] that it could be that it could be
[29:57] have the lights
[29:59] on I don't know about you guys but I
[30:01] have a thing with lights being left
[30:04] on my wife loves the the uh the
[30:09] warmth the that it makes all the
[30:11] decorations look better and I and my
[30:14] kids have inherited that I walk through
[30:15] the room I see a room nobody's in there
[30:16] lights off lights off lights off I'm
[30:19] like the the Angel of Darkness all the
[30:21] lights off my wife likes these types cuz
[30:24] she's the angel of Light she literally
[30:26] brightens up every room she's in thanks
[30:28] to American Electric Power no I'm
[30:32] teasing anyhow what does it cost for the
[30:35] electricity any any any ideas here 300
[30:38] bucks a mon 300 bucks a
[30:40] month uh maybe in maybe in the summer
[30:43] with with air conditioning really high
[30:44] another another thought 100 bucks a
[30:47] month maybe in the winter would bundled
[30:49] up really well 30 bucks that's on the
[30:52] really low side but of course it it it's
[30:55] all going to depend what kind of house
[30:56] you have because some houses will heat
[30:59] with
[31:00] electricity and that's going to cost
[31:02] extra if your house is heated with
[31:04] natural gas then your electric bill will
[31:06] be uh lower but um say electrical bill
[31:11] for a for a small family I bet you're
[31:13] talking a good $150 anyway and you're
[31:16] not in the summer yet so let's put 1007
[31:19] let's put it's
[31:21] 175 because how do you budget um you
[31:24] know what you look for an average cost
[31:26] over your over the entire year so
[31:28] ideally and our family just moved like I
[31:31] said so I'm still trying to figure out
[31:33] what my monthly costs are going to be
[31:34] like because we're entering into a a new
[31:37] season I won't know exactly how much
[31:39] it's going to how much I should be
[31:40] setting aside each month for electric
[31:41] cost after a whole year has gone by this
[31:44] is what we'll start off with gas again
[31:46] it'll depend is it natural gas is it
[31:49] propane propane I am discovering is much
[31:51] more expensive than natural gas any
[31:55] ideas what let's say Natural Gas what
[31:57] what might might we pay to heat our
[31:59] homes to cook Etc with natural gas any
[32:04] ideas 75 bucks in the summer
[32:09] maybe okay maybe yeah I bet the that's
[32:12] on the really low side maybe a single
[32:15] guy could do that but um as soon as a
[32:18] woman came into my life all my my joy
[32:21] went up we'll just leave it like that um
[32:23] we'll just leave it like that um now
[32:26] you're probably going to talk talk about
[32:28] yeah 120 150 bucks easy for natural gas
[32:32] and propane if you're looking at propane
[32:34] I just had to pay
[32:36] $270 to put my propane tank from 50% to
[32:42] 75%
[32:44] $271
[32:46] 63 it hurt so let's put in gas let's put
[32:49] in 200 uh let's put in 200 bucks it
[32:52] could be give or give or take a little
[32:54] bit again water will kind of go quickly
[32:56] any idea what water might cost for a
[32:58] month again it could depend if you're
[33:00] City water well water um well water City
[33:04] Water what what somebody say 30 bucks a
[33:07] month that's that's pretty that's what I
[33:09] paid when I was on City Water we I
[33:11] thought when I went to the country oh
[33:13] good I've got well water it's going to
[33:14] be
[33:15] free no I've got sulfur in my well so uh
[33:19] I'm paying $75 every 3 months or so and
[33:23] getting it softened so 25 bucks a month
[33:25] that's not bad but that in there for
[33:27] water
[33:29] sewage it's got to be getting rid of
[33:31] somehow guys um uh sewage any ideas what
[33:36] what what what your monthly sewer bill
[33:37] is costing your parents or is costing
[33:39] you 100 bucks somebody say something I
[33:44] think that's a pretty high one I think I
[33:46] was paying $75 every quarter or so so
[33:49] let's say 30 bucks a month or something
[33:51] like that for uh for for your sewer bill
[33:54] trash bill that was something similar 30
[33:57] bucks a month uh we kind of U property
[34:00] taxes it's something you you have to pay
[34:02] every half I think I pay property taxes
[34:04] in the February and July and depending
[34:07] what kind of house you have if you're
[34:08] renting it'll be different um any ideas
[34:10] what property taxes might cost us where
[34:13] the Jack 7,000 no way wow and again it
[34:18] depends what part of the country 7,000
[34:20] per year or
[34:22] half wow so that means you got to start
[34:25] setting up $3500 per half well I moved
[34:29] to Florida that's right
[34:31] $7,000 goodness um I think mine are
[34:34] about Le about half of that but uh
[34:37] goodness let's put in for property taxes
[34:40] uh 275 a month I'm just putting that
[34:43] aside every month I don't and I put it
[34:45] in my own bank account that way I can
[34:47] earn interest on it you can also have it
[34:49] automatically set up where it's called
[34:51] escrow where with with your mortgage
[34:53] your taxes are set up on top of that but
[34:55] you don't earn the interest on that if
[34:57] you do it that way housing Insurance
[35:00] it'll depend what kind of house you have
[35:02] if you're renting if it's riddle
[35:03] Insurance um let's say uh 120 bucks a
[35:08] month 150 bucks a month something like
[35:10] that let's say 150 bucks a month for
[35:12] that life
[35:14] insurance like why why do I need life
[35:16] insurance I'm young that's exactly the
[35:19] time to buy it because you want to buy
[35:22] life insurance as young as you can for
[35:25] as long as you can
[35:27] um so I think uh 30 Buck depending on
[35:31] what age you're getting it at brother
[35:34] Jack whole
[35:38] life okay yes
[35:41] um I I I think term life insurance is
[35:44] the better way to go because you're
[35:47] going um you can um you're buying it for
[35:50] that time of life that you need it so if
[35:52] you buy term life insurance you might be
[35:54] getting it for uh 20 years and now be
[35:56] that time of life I I bought life
[35:59] insurance I was 25 years old uh say
[36:01] something like that um I just got
[36:04] married I'm starting to have children
[36:07] and I'm going to I think I got like a 20
[36:08] year 30-y year plan whatever would the
[36:10] max would be there so from 25 up
[36:13] to 45 or 50 I've got life insurance I'm
[36:18] I'm I'm covered then and after that
[36:21] amount I might need
[36:22] less because my kids might be close to
[36:25] being out to the home
[36:27] I will have gotten more saved so that if
[36:30] something were to happen I've got a nest
[36:32] egg that would support my wife and
[36:34] family more but at the very beginning at
[36:37] 30 years I don't have much of anything
[36:38] saves if I were to die my wife would not
[36:41] be celebrating because she's got the
[36:43] budget all to herself now she would
[36:44] really be in mourning for me of course
[36:47] of course um and then she's but she's
[36:50] got you want to make sure the house can
[36:51] be paid off you got enough to get pay
[36:53] off your house you want enough on your
[36:55] life insurance guys to put some kids
[36:57] through college if you have to because
[36:59] you want to make it as easy as possible
[37:02] for your your your wife and children
[37:05] afterwards because you don't want to
[37:06] create a situation where a wife feels
[37:09] pressured then to enter into a marriage
[37:12] relationship than uh just just to pay
[37:14] for bills so get some term life
[37:16] insurance that that takes you for as
[37:18] long as you can for as little as you can
[37:20] and you can get a good policy I think
[37:22] for 30 bucks a month if you're if you're
[37:24] a good healthy guy super 30 bucks a
[37:27] month your life insurance okay now this
[37:30] is the scroll on down here we can do a
[37:32] little bit better help me out guys um
[37:35] how much does a cell phone bill charge
[37:37] cost you each month I'm I'm interested
[37:39] doing finding out what do

[37:46] okay

[38:36] with with Verizon for a three-year plan
[38:39] so much a month that thousand phone see
[38:41] how much that actually cost you after
[38:44] three years it cost a lot more so my
[38:47] hunt somebody said 50 bucks a month
[38:49] something like that if you were to go
[38:51] with a um if you're like a a three gig
[38:54] data plan for two people you're probably
[38:56] talking 70 bucks a month 80 bucks a
[38:58] month if you're getting an unlimited
[39:00] data plan for two people you're probably
[39:03] getting close like what David said to
[39:04] about a thousand to about $100 a month
[39:07] and that's if you own your
[39:08] phone if you don't own your phone you're
[39:11] probably going to be paying on top of
[39:13] that that pretty
[39:15] fair Wi-Fi want Wi-Fi at
[39:20] home 40 bucks 65 so somebody yeah do you
[39:24] need Wi-Fi home or would you rather go
[39:26] with a
[39:27] um hotspot
[39:29] option like the Wi-Fi okay um I bet
[39:33] Wi-Fi 70 bucks a month pump them like
[39:37] that and phone cell phone 100 bucks a
[39:40] month fair enough health insurance
[39:43] unnecessary evil um man it's it can be
[39:47] expensive what does health insurance
[39:49] cost any thoughts here any want
[39:53] to 200 bucks a month for solo do you
[39:56] have cop pays on top of
[40:02] that okay
[40:05] okay 200 bucks a month um that's for one
[40:08] person um I think I've got a um I've got
[40:13] a plan like through the Brotherhood or
[40:15] Good Samaritan it's like $500 a month
[40:17] for two people and that's a uh the gold
[40:19] plan but let's put let's put 450 in
[40:21] there kind of average that out co-pays
[40:24] that's if you go to the uh depending on
[40:25] what kind of insurance you have to go to
[40:27] the doctor's office to walk in the door
[40:29] they might require you to pay a co-pay
[40:30] which is your portion of it you might
[40:32] have to pay 50 bucks before even see the
[40:33] doctor before you even get a bill you
[40:35] just have to pay 50 bucks to go in go
[40:38] into the doorway other health costs uh
[40:42] what other health costs are there
[40:43] besides health
[40:45] insurance
[40:47] glasses
[40:48] um dental insurance uh a teeth clean I
[40:53] just have to pay for my kids to get
[40:54] their teeth clean was 85 bucks per kid
[40:58] $170 last month went for teeth
[41:02] braces several thousand but we'll just
[41:05] we'll leave braces for now but um copay
[41:08] other health class how do you budget
[41:09] going to the
[41:11] dentist I would say hey you're going to
[41:13] go $170 say 200 bucks twice a year for
[41:16] $200 you put 15 10 uh $15 $20 down each
[41:22] month just put that right away an
[41:24] envelope let's put 20 let's put
[41:26] 30 40 let's put $35 for co-pays other
[41:29] health
[41:30] costs and then yeah you got to get your
[41:33] cold medicine you what what kind of
[41:36] prescriptions do you have I don't go to
[41:37] the doctor I don't get things but I bet
[41:39] you go to the chiropractor I bet you get
[41:41] your essential oils I bet you get your
[41:43] health supplements I bet you get your
[41:45] vitamins I bet you get organic foods my
[41:47] son and I are figuring out a system just
[41:49] to get organic stickers to put on the
[41:52] food so my wife it's a lot cheaper guys
[41:55] it's a lot cheaper cheap because I think
[41:57] organic is half the sticker that's
[42:00] that's just my uh that's just my uh my
[42:02] two cents worth there but yeah Health
[42:04] supplements that's not cheap those
[42:06] vitamins um so I don't know vitamin
[42:09] folks how much can you expect to spend
[42:12] keeping uh uh keeping two people healthy
[42:15] a month with
[42:19] vitamins let's say uh let's say 50 bucks
[42:22] let's say 50 bucks 50 bucks a month good
[42:27] groceries this is where my wife likes to
[42:30] save money say honey why you have to
[42:31] save money on groceries that's my
[42:33] favorite part of a budget but that's
[42:35] where she saves her money groceries um
[42:38] but what does it cost for a any the
[42:40] ideas what it costs for a family at two
[42:42] for
[42:45] groceries $300 for
[42:48] two
[42:50] 300 depends it will depend on where you
[42:52] live 300
[42:54] anybody 500 for two yeah um let's go
[42:59] with 300 think it's
[43:04] possible okay very good um the the four
[43:08] walls of the budget the four most
[43:10] important pieces of of of your budget
[43:12] first one is is food you got to take
[43:14] care of yourself because if you're if
[43:15] you're not eating you can't earn income
[43:17] but food you get it from multiple places
[43:19] you can get it from Aldi and I'm not
[43:21] being paid by Aldi to mention their name
[43:24] but you can also eat out each month and
[43:26] I'm talking right now just groceries so
[43:28] if we um let's just say do what sister
[43:31] Duff says 300 bucks let's go with that
[43:34] Rebecca you mentioned that too as well
[43:36] 300 bucks for our our groceries but um
[43:39] are we as a young couple going to be
[43:40] eating out after church on Sunday we're
[43:42] going to go out with our friends aren't
[43:44] we probably so where do you want to go
[43:46] out you can go out to Taco Bell and get
[43:49] like their $2 value option I like the $2
[43:52] value option from Taco Bell I really
[43:54] like that one I can get uh I like the
[43:56] the never mind we won't go there um you
[43:58] can do really well if you go to
[44:00] Applebees if you go to Olive Garden what
[44:02] can you expect to drop for lunch 50s for
[44:06] two of you for two of you you could
[44:08] spend 50
[44:10] bucks if you give out especially if you
[44:12] give it a a tip and everything it's
[44:14] pretty easy if you go to Applebees that
[44:17] sort of restaurant three times in the
[44:18] month you're looking at $150 pretty
[44:21] quick aren't
[44:22] you so let's put our eating coffee trips
[44:26] how many times a day do we go to
[44:29] Starbucks how much does a trip to
[44:31] Starbucks
[44:34] cost
[44:37] yeah very good very good so I bet um
[44:42] will we get three cappuccinos a week
[44:43] from a
[44:46] restaurant wa
[44:49] four go with four $5
[44:54] cappuccinos wow Wow Let's Go 6 * 4 is 24
[45:00] * 4 that's $96 a month on
[45:05] coffee plus uh $75 in the month that
[45:10] right $150 a month going out to
[45:13] restaurants to be with our
[45:14] friends that's uh so uh 150 plus
[45:19] 96
[45:23] $246
[45:24] entertainment
[45:26] entertainment what do we do for this
[45:28] this could be our uh our subscriptions
[45:32] Spotify Apple
[45:34] music whatever other things there could
[45:37] be gy yeah um is it Amazon Prime are we
[45:43] talking $25 $30 a monthly subscriptions
[45:45] is
[45:46] that $100 a monthly
[45:49] subscriptions $100 monthly subscriptions
[45:52] really wow

[45:58] wife so let's say uh 100 bucks a month
[46:00] of
[46:01] subscriptions man
[46:04] gifts that's one of those necessary
[46:06] evils this time of year
[46:09] right so
[46:11] uh what do you give let's say you have
[46:13] you have a man your friend uh bachelor
[46:16] party or baby shower or bridal shower as
[46:19] the case may be what do you give to
[46:20] those things you come from a large
[46:22] family what do you give for presents I
[46:24] mean you're going to have to give at
[46:25] least $5 that's what a card costs
[46:27] nowadays at least
[46:30] $5 pick your favorite family MERS you
[46:33] pick your favorite family members I'd
[46:34] like the just kind of like drawing
[46:36] putting in hat names in the Hat and
[46:37] everybody draw one name for the whole
[46:39] year and that's who you buy a really
[46:41] nice present for but I bet hey you could
[46:44] spend I'm probably showing how cheap I
[46:46] am but you could
[46:47] probably mean $40 a month for gifts
[46:51] that's not that
[46:53] much not that much
[46:57] put 40
[47:01] bucks no no I'm talking for a month I'm
[47:05] talking for a month no yeah yeah and of
[47:10] course 40 bucks a month and December's
[47:12] not going to cut it probably not so this
[47:16] is includes like Christmas so there'll
[47:17] be some months man this is not very much
[47:19] it's brother Paul no goodness
[47:22] gracious man I bet you could
[47:29] I bet you to be easy do $200 a month and
[47:33] that that include your Christmas for
[47:35] your
[47:37] friends let's say let's go conservative
[47:39] and say 100 we'll just see how it goes
[47:42] uh wrong wrong field gifts yep vacation
[47:45] camps things like that do we like we
[47:48] like to take trips we like to take uh
[47:50] traveling around the country traveling
[47:51] around the world things like that like
[47:53] going to youth retreat um you probably
[47:56] spent at least $200 getting here right
[47:59] at least and you might go to another
[48:02] couple camps and you might take a
[48:05] vacation with some friends uh somewhere
[48:07] uh around somewhere here in North
[48:09] America or outside of North
[48:12] America what $2,000 like to take through
[48:16] nice travels hey you can be real be
[48:19] realistic I'd really like to be able to
[48:20] take a nice vacation how much does it
[48:22] cost for a hotel room you're talking at
[48:25] least bucks for hotel room when you go
[48:28] go go somewhere and I'm not talking
[48:30] Motel 6 you might do Motel 6 by yourself
[48:33] I will not do it with that
[48:35] lady no um so you go out so you go for a
[48:39] weekend away two nights no you're $500 a
[48:43] couple meals a weekend away you're
[48:45] probably going to be5 $600 out pretty
[48:49] easily you want to do that a couple
[48:51] times a year let's budget
[48:53] $1,500 and that's pretty
[48:57] that's less than our sister to the right
[49:00] was hoping for $1,500 uh $1,500 per per
[49:04] year so divide that by 12 thank you
[49:07] Ian
[49:09] that's that's going to be pretty cheap
[49:12] that's going to go pretty low let's say
[49:17] 2,000 divided by 12 we'll just kind of
[49:23] see see I bet this fund is going to get
[49:27] robbed every month when you're up short
[49:30] you're going to be robbing this fund
[49:31] going on
[49:33] down car
[49:36] payment what is the average car payment
[49:40] for a new
[49:42] car I hear $500 $600 both are in the the
[49:47] average car payment for a new car is
[49:51] $575 for a new car that's average car
[49:55] payment for a used car what's the
[49:57] average car
[49:59] payment depends on what kind of
[50:02] use a used car average car payments with
[50:06] $430 you go out to the used car you get
[50:09] a finance average car payments with
[50:12] $430 so you're just putting dumping
[50:14] money into your car are there other ways
[50:16] to get the used
[50:18] car there's a junker you go get get a
[50:21] get a junker of a car um and yeah then
[50:24] you're paying nothing per month I know
[50:27] some people like and I I get it um I get
[50:31] it that some folks would rather have a
[50:33] not get the old junker used car because
[50:36] you don't want the maintenance costs I
[50:39] understand that but let's say 400 $430 a
[50:43] month is the average used car payment
[50:46] what's that times 12 that's 4,000 say
[50:49] close to $5,000 a year yeah $5,000 a
[50:54] year that's a lot let's say in that year
[50:59] you have to replace all four of your
[51:01] tires and your air conditioning and do
[51:05] something
[51:05] else you're still
[51:08] cheaper than the used car payments
[51:11] you're still cheaper so I know and and I
[51:14] know especially uh I wouldn't want one
[51:17] of you your sisters driving the junker
[51:19] and getting stranded on the highway
[51:22] after a night shift I wouldn't do that
[51:24] you want to have a good reliable car
[51:26] going to be be be safe in in situations
[51:28] but um I wouldn't I would avoid car debt
[51:32] because as soon as you drive that car
[51:34] off the lot the average car is going to
[51:35] lose 20% of its value in the first year
[51:38] you're not going to get it back and
[51:40] within the first five years that car is
[51:42] going to be that will be I think worth
[51:45] half of what it was when you bought it
[51:47] whereas if you go out and buy a
[51:50] 15-year-old Toyota Corolla you go out
[51:53] and buy one of those you might spend 6
[51:55] or $7,000 on it a year or two later
[51:58] you've driven it you've saved up enough
[52:00] money you can probably sell that Corolla
[52:03] for a little less or close to what you
[52:05] bought it for depending on the condition
[52:07] and then you've got cash to go out and
[52:10] step up a car that's the way to do
[52:12] that's not the American way the American
[52:14] way is I want it now I need it now I
[52:16] need it uh I put it on on on on credit
[52:20] but set yourself up what's called a a
[52:22] sinking fund so we could we could Del a
[52:25] car leave the 430 there now but leave
[52:27] the car payment there right now but if
[52:30] we were to put it at zero all of a
[52:32] sudden we pay ourselves $400 a month and
[52:35] we put it into a separate account at the
[52:38] end of the year we've got $5,000 and we
[52:41] can go car shopping at the end of two
[52:43] years youve get over $10,000 you can get
[52:46] a nice car with that so the the the
[52:50] purpose here is uh godliness with
[52:52] contentment is great gain you can really
[52:56] accomplish a lot by putting off
[52:58] immediate satisfaction so leave that for
[53:00] let's put four let's leave that there
[53:02] for now uh we'll kind of hurry through
[53:05] for fuel depending how far you have to
[53:06] drive let's say 250 a month depending on
[53:09] what what gas prices are like auto
[53:11] insurance I think average price of auto
[53:13] insurance for minimum liability coverage
[53:16] and depending on what your accident
[53:17] record and things like that the minimum
[53:19] amount is like is like 50 $50 $52 a
[53:23] month but let's up that to be like 70
[53:25] bucks a month um car expenses you're
[53:29] going to have to change your oil uh have
[53:31] to get your tags renewed every uh every
[53:35] year so I would put money each month
[53:37] aside at least probably $40
[53:39] $50 uh just in case you have um the
[53:43] expense thing come up
[53:44] clothes what do clothes cost us guys
[53:48] nothing right we're having food in
[53:51] rayment we are content um but um how
[53:55] much should we plan to spend in
[53:57] clothes zero yeah nice nice nice
[54:01] um yeah Goodwill hey hey Goodwill is a
[54:05] you can get some really good Bargains at
[54:07] uh the Goodwill however you got to you
[54:10] want to get a pair of shoes every every
[54:12] couple years that'll put you back $100
[54:15] at least 150 bucks you're going to be
[54:18] getting the you're going be getting
[54:19] something every now and and then and I
[54:22] thought $50 a month was a lot of money
[54:25] for
[54:26] clothing that's really not that bad I
[54:29] didn't say 15 I said 50 oh so I uh
[54:34] that's pretty conservative is that
[54:35] really conservative 50 bucks a
[54:39] month let's put let's put
[54:42] uh let's put
[54:47] 75 no no um and of course I I had to add
[54:51] this for some of my students who are
[54:53] really into pets but
[55:00] yes brother Enoch this is the budget for
[55:01] both of you your wife does not have a
[55:03] separate
[55:04] [Laughter]
[55:06] budget no um we can leave the pet food
[55:10] part but this was for a former student
[55:12] of mine and like pets are expensive
[55:15] they're very expensive so scroll all the
[55:17] way to the top
[55:20] in our expenses this is after taxes
[55:25] this is after taxes this is our this is
[55:27] our take-home pay based upon our
[55:30] expenses right now we've got to have to
[55:33] have at least
[55:36] $5,000 so Ian go to the second
[55:40] sheet right now we want to see what do I
[55:42] have to do to get to
[55:43] the and that's without tithe that's
[55:46] without savings that's without a lot of
[55:50] things um so let's say here I've got up
[55:53] the top where we're going to figure out
[55:54] what this go throws hourly wages up
[55:56] there how much do I need to be earning
[55:57] working how many hours a week how many
[55:59] weeks of the year to cover this
[56:02] budget 14 bucks an hour how much do I
[56:04] have I do 14 bucks an hour for 40 hours
[56:07] a week 50 weeks of the year so we have
[56:10] B5 our yearly wage is 28,000 our monthly
[56:14] wage is 2,300 it's not going to cut it
[56:17] because our expenses were
[56:19] 5,000 so uh
[56:22] McDonald's Walmart
[56:25] it's not going to work let's try
[56:28] 25 let's try 25 bucks now I think that
[56:31] is about the hourly wage for a for a
[56:34] starting welder I think that's at 20
[56:36] bucks 20 uh so that's 20 so if you get
[56:39] $25 an hour working 40 week 40 hours a
[56:42] week two weeks vacation you get
[56:45] $50,000 is that enough Ian go back to
[56:48] the other page it's not enough is it
[56:51] we're still almost $1,000 in the red we
[56:55] still and taxes are in there too go back
[56:57] to the other let's let's up to $35 a
[57:00] month $35 an hour
[57:04] rather here we might have something we
[57:07] can work
[57:08] with so now our question is let's let's
[57:12] plug it in
[57:14] here let's let's call this $6,000 a
[57:17] month go back to your first
[57:19] sheet put $6,000 in the income section
[57:23] yeah
[57:25] so now we've got $1,000 we haven't paid
[57:28] anything for go down to
[57:30] tithes so if we have $6,000 we got 600
[57:35] bucks in
[57:38] tithes uh no just put 600 uh yeah that's
[57:43] fine yeah and offering I'll leave that
[57:47] uh I'll leave that to your discretion
[57:49] there but we've got
[57:51] $489 left for
[57:53] savings and uh tax I bet $66,000 a month
[57:58] is going to still be on it's going to be
[58:00] cutting it close but uh financial
[58:02] advisor suggest pay um saving 10 to 15%
[58:06] of your
[58:07] income each month for retirement
[58:10] planning and the advice is unless you
[58:12] really like dog
[58:14] food save for
[58:16] retirement so how much is uh 15% of
[58:20] 6,000 so $600
[58:23] $900 so put that in under
[58:29] savings all of a sudden we're in the red
[58:32] again so our uh our salary needs to go
[58:36] up let's uh let's go to the second
[58:38] sheet let's get a $40 an hour $80,000 go
[58:43] back to the first
[58:45] sheet okay and what was that amount fill
[58:49] that in the in there we can look at this
[58:51] a couple ways guys because we're what I
[58:56] wanted to show us is what what kind of
[58:58] work we need to be having a vision
[59:00] for but there's other ways of cutting
[59:03] some of these things because yes we can
[59:05] try to increase our income but we can
[59:07] also try to cut some of our expenses too
[59:10] and some of these expenses could be cut
[59:12] we could uh we we we we we could do some
[59:15] trimming and I just want to say as we
[59:17] think about um about career plans and
[59:21] things like that think man it's be
[59:22] really really expensive my I was talking
[59:26] to my wife about this um session and she
[59:29] said rap what do you do with somebody
[59:31] like brother John le
[59:32] Fontaine who basically just left his job
[59:36] and went to be a traveling evangelist
[59:38] with with his family with a very
[59:39] uncertain
[59:41] income and I thought wow what a legacy
[59:45] he has not a big Financial Legacy I
[59:49] think brother Paul sings a song about uh
[59:51] what my father left me and the brother
[59:54] John le Fontaine left a very rich Legacy
[59:58] that can't be measured in dollar figures
[1:00:01] and if we just go about pursuing what we
[1:00:04] were just talking about well I I I I put
[1:00:06] this here on the screen so we can kind
[1:00:08] of be realistic about the decisions that
[1:00:09] we make and seeing what uh what life
[1:00:12] cost for we enter into it but we're
[1:00:15] looking at all these categories this is
[1:00:17] what I have to have in order to main the
[1:00:19] life maintain the lifestyle I want to
[1:00:21] have but there's a lot more things more
[1:00:23] important than the lifestyle we might
[1:00:24] want to have because a life of
[1:00:28] ministry it has to cover these Basics
[1:00:30] you have to be able to provide for your
[1:00:32] family but um there can be other
[1:00:35] priorities sometimes as well that might
[1:00:36] require some sacrifice and but when you
[1:00:39] see that how how how the Lord can move
[1:00:42] and can work and be effective through
[1:00:44] you even though you might be earning
[1:00:46] less than you might be able to it does
[1:00:49] make it worthwhile so don't just go
[1:00:51] about pursuing higher numbers
[1:00:55] the salary with the higher numbers
[1:00:56] that's where I have to go because yes
[1:00:58] that will put a lot more things on your
[1:01:00] plate but you might you don't want to
[1:01:03] buy into the world's lie you have to
[1:01:05] have all these things in order to be a
[1:01:09] happy successful family because that's
[1:01:11] buying into another form of the LIE can
[1:01:14] we go back
[1:01:15] uh scroll back up there so yeah if we
[1:01:17] have a close to $60 $700 a month then uh
[1:01:22] you've got some left over you can give
[1:01:24] that to uh offering you can give on some
[1:01:26] more to savings let's go back to the
[1:01:29] PowerPoint and I want to uh um kind of
[1:01:33] you've been very attentive when to draw
[1:01:35] this to a to a close sometime here
[1:01:39] soon so like I said we don't want to buy
[1:01:42] into the lie that we have to have all
[1:01:44] these things and have to have a job that
[1:01:46] pays for all these things because um
[1:01:49] increasing numbers that's another form
[1:01:51] of the of of just serving laia um have
[1:01:54] have an eye for Ministry what God wants
[1:01:56] you to do John Wesley said make all you
[1:01:58] can save all you can give all you can
[1:02:02] that's a very different Creed than loud
[1:02:04] to see which is make all you can buy all
[1:02:06] you can those are very two two two very
[1:02:09] different things but just as a rule of
[1:02:12] thumb and I have this on the slide in
[1:02:14] there when you're when when you're
[1:02:15] budgeting and trying to get estimate
[1:02:17] what what cost will be yeah housing is
[1:02:20] generally going to cost you about uh um
[1:02:23] let's go back a slide
[1:02:25] oh we're good hey this is
[1:02:29] good up
[1:02:32] one
[1:02:35] y God's blessings are real they really
[1:02:39] are if you honor the Lord with your
[1:02:40] substance if you honor the Lord with
[1:02:42] your tithe he will provide for you and U
[1:02:46] you can recount many examples of that I
[1:02:48] just a couple years ago we were getting
[1:02:50] ready to go on vacation as we're pulling
[1:02:52] out of the driveway I closed my garage
[1:02:54] door and it won't go
[1:02:56] down and oh man the garage door was
[1:02:59] busted had to just put on manual put it
[1:03:01] down and we'll figure out when we come
[1:03:03] back when I got home I had a check in
[1:03:05] the mail from somebody um um who knew me
[1:03:10] and it was sent you can see the postmark
[1:03:13] on the envelope was sent before i' left
[1:03:15] for vacation and it was a check for
[1:03:18] $500 I my wife's like yes we have I said
[1:03:21] honey I bet that's going to be about
[1:03:23] what the Gage short costs are fix and
[1:03:25] that's what it was God takes care of it
[1:03:28] you might think man I can't afford to
[1:03:30] pay tithes this month I can't afford to
[1:03:32] do it we really can't afford not to do
[1:03:34] it because God's blessings are real he
[1:03:37] does he does honor
[1:03:40] you but you can look on the uh look on
[1:03:43] the slid they're on the uh if you look
[1:03:45] at they're on the drive you can access
[1:03:48] with with the QR
[1:03:53] code
[1:03:55] we don't want to get into this thing we
[1:03:58] got to work harder work harder so we can
[1:04:00] get the money that we need so we can
[1:04:02] earn more money because all the money
[1:04:04] that we need happiness is just around
[1:04:05] the corner so we can buy the things that
[1:04:06] we need because happiness is just around
[1:04:08] the corner this is just the rat race
[1:04:10] that's the allow to see in Rat Race we
[1:04:12] work harder earn more money so we can
[1:04:13] buy more things so we can be happy and
[1:04:15] it just keeps on going uh the only tonic
[1:04:18] a way to counteract this is godliness
[1:04:21] with contentment is great gain that is
[1:04:23] the
[1:04:24] let us with food and rment let us be
[1:04:26] there with
[1:04:30] content yeah so yeah here's the the two
[1:04:34] hens talking to each other I'm depressed
[1:04:36] let's go out shopping and that's what
[1:04:37] they're counting on us to do the accy is
[1:04:40] counting on our continued
[1:04:42] unhappiness consumerism versus
[1:04:45] contentment here we're going to uh wind
[1:04:47] up consumerism is an economic and social
[1:04:50] system that encourages the consumption
[1:04:52] of goods and services as a mean means of
[1:04:55] attaining
[1:04:57] wellbeing and this is the system that we
[1:05:00] live with in our world today and it
[1:05:02] reminds me of La DEA I'm rich increased
[1:05:05] with Goods I don't have need of anything
[1:05:08] I think I've got everything it's all
[1:05:10] about what you have and it kind of looks
[1:05:13] like this I've got everything I want yet
[1:05:18] you don't realize that you're actually
[1:05:20] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[1:05:23] that is a describing our our times they
[1:05:27] think they're rich yet they've missed
[1:05:29] out on true gold they have so many Goods
[1:05:32] they think they don't need
[1:05:34] anything yet they don't realize they're
[1:05:36] so destitute that they're naked and when
[1:05:38] they discover the truth and people today
[1:05:40] young people today in the world today
[1:05:43] discover sometimes their life that I've
[1:05:45] been sold to Billet Goods by the world
[1:05:47] none of this gives me with the happiness
[1:05:49] I hope for and when you find somebody
[1:05:51] who's discovered that that is a prime
[1:05:53] witnessing a opportunity because they've
[1:05:55] come to the realization I need something
[1:05:57] more than what this world has to offer
[1:05:59] they're driven to Despair and um
[1:06:02] sometimes they realize hey everything I
[1:06:04] put value in has been a mirage there's
[1:06:06] no purpose for living left and that's
[1:06:08] when God can uh reach them because they
[1:06:10] realize they have a
[1:06:12] need this this idea of consumerism is
[1:06:14] like the old Fable of the donkey but
[1:06:16] when the donkey is pursuing the carrot
[1:06:18] he never really gets it the only winner
[1:06:20] is the person driving the
[1:06:22] donkey and if we're not careful when we
[1:06:25] pursue well-being in the consumption of
[1:06:28] goods and services we are modern donkeys
[1:06:32] we'll never get the carrots the only one
[1:06:34] who's being benefited is the person
[1:06:35] who's taking our money promising us
[1:06:38] happiness but they're not able to to
[1:06:40] give
[1:06:42] it consumerism this is just buy just buy
[1:06:45] just buy the zombies going to just buy
[1:06:47] get get their happiness this is the
[1:06:49] world we live in I just have to get my
[1:06:51] next thing get my next thing but this is
[1:06:53] what we really need I counsel thee to
[1:06:56] buy of me gold tried in the fire that is
[1:07:00] of True Value and white r you may be
[1:07:03] clothed the shame of your nakedness not
[1:07:05] appear and anoint th eyes with isav that
[1:07:08] they that you may actually see this is
[1:07:11] what we really need and God is send us a
[1:07:14] a prophet in this day to help us see the
[1:07:17] time that we're living in help us see
[1:07:18] that the the world's perception of value
[1:07:21] is indeed a mirage and he's trying to
[1:07:24] Shake us awake stop stop this jump off
[1:07:27] of this Rat Race get out of it and
[1:07:29] repent put your value what is truly
[1:07:32] valuable and then in uh in closing you
[1:07:34] just want to uh look at uh the book of
[1:07:37] Hagi and uh the book of Hagi he's a Hagi
[1:07:41] is a prophet um that is prophesying
[1:07:44] right in the middle of the book of Ezra
[1:07:48] and you can read think in Ezra 5 this is
[1:07:49] when hai's prophecy comes forward the
[1:07:52] people um the the Jews who left Babylon
[1:07:56] with Ezra they've started rebuilding the
[1:07:58] temple but they get discouraged after a
[1:07:59] few years and I think for a period of
[1:08:02] almost 15 years they stop completely and
[1:08:05] they just start working on their own
[1:08:06] houses building themselves up great
[1:08:09] things kind of focusing on what our
[1:08:11] budget was like what do I need to make
[1:08:13] to be living my dream to be living to be
[1:08:17] to be to be funding everything I want I
[1:08:19] want I want want to do and they were
[1:08:21] working really hard on their houses but
[1:08:23] they weren't making a lot of progress
[1:08:25] and God sent Hagi to him is it time for
[1:08:27] you to dwell in your beautiful houses
[1:08:30] and this house the temple to lie waste
[1:08:33] thus said the Lord consider your ways
[1:08:35] and this is my invitation to us today
[1:08:37] consider our ways how can we establish
[1:08:40] good financial habits
[1:08:42] now he says you've swn much and bring in
[1:08:45] little you eat but don't have enough you
[1:08:48] drink but aren't filled with drink you
[1:08:50] get clothes but there's still n none
[1:08:52] warm and he who earns wage Wes earne
[1:08:54] wages to put it into a bag with holes
[1:08:56] you work so hard end of the month you
[1:08:58] have nothing left over and God says to
[1:09:00] them and US consider our ways so my
[1:09:04] encouragement here to you and brother
[1:09:06] Paul you can get ready to come uh my
[1:09:07] encouragement to us is start uh start
[1:09:11] off now with a uh with with with a a
[1:09:14] budget start off now tracking your
[1:09:16] expenses start off now uh saving money
[1:09:19] it would be great if when you uh go into
[1:09:22] marriage that you don't have to go ones
[1:09:24] but you have savings coming into a
[1:09:25] marriage that' be a wonderful thing uh
[1:09:28] do that kind of thing um advice is to
[1:09:30] have a $1,000 emergency fund make make
[1:09:33] sure that you have $1,000 an emergency
[1:09:35] fund that you would be able to access
[1:09:38] right away in case there were an
[1:09:39] emergency because then you don't have to
[1:09:41] put on a car that you might not be able
[1:09:42] to pay off you'll avoid the 27% interest
[1:09:45] consider our wage when to be good
[1:09:47] stewards God has given us everything he
[1:09:50] asks us to be good stewards of the other
[1:09:53] 90% % amen let's
[1:09:56] pray heavenly father I thank you Lord
[1:09:58] for the uh principles you have on your
[1:10:00] word Lord that are both uh both uh can
[1:10:03] be both deep and also very very
[1:10:05] practical Lord father I pray that you
[1:10:08] would help us to apply some of the
[1:10:10] things that we've heard today and start
[1:10:11] making good Financial choices so that we
[1:10:14] can prepare uh for the future and being
[1:10:16] good stewards Lord I pray that you'd
[1:10:18] help us not to um buy into the LIE of
[1:10:20] loud DEA that well-being is just uh by
[1:10:23] the consumption of goods and services
[1:10:25] but may we lord follow your word repent
[1:10:28] anoint our eyes with eyesa that we can
[1:10:30] see Lord and by the true gold of real
[1:10:33] value father and Lord I pray that you
[1:10:34] would help us not to jump on this Rat
[1:10:37] Race and and follow the big numbers but
[1:10:39] Lord to be like our brother John LEF
[1:10:41] Fontaine father who years back made
[1:10:43] Financial uh uh sacrifices to to do
[1:10:47] Kingdom Minister that is still paying
[1:10:49] off great dividends today Lord I pray
[1:10:51] that you'd give us not just a a
[1:10:53] financial vision for our lives Lord but
[1:10:55] a spiritual vision for our lives too oh
[1:10:58] God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:00] amen God bless you thank
[1:11:09] you thank you rap I appreciate it so
[1:11:12] much um I wonder if you'd be available
[1:11:14] if anybody wants to stay over in the
[1:11:16] corner here and come and ask rap any
[1:11:18] personal questions about your finances
[1:11:20] and thing would you be available for
[1:11:21] that I'll be the first one in line want
[1:11:23] ask
[1:11:24] you but um yeah so if you do hang around
[1:11:27] if anybody does have any questions they
[1:11:29] want to ask you can do it there that way
[1:11:30] we can let the other ones go they that
[1:11:32] want to go um I didn't I I guess I
[1:11:36] missed the memo or maybe sent it and I
[1:11:37] forgot it but I was so glad that he took
[1:11:40] a session about this I didn't know he
[1:11:41] was going to do that but I always love
[1:11:45] uh to see the realities put in front of
[1:11:47] the young people of these this thing
[1:11:49] this is I like to I like for the young
[1:11:50] people to see real numbers and actually
[1:11:53] the these are a bit conservative what he
[1:11:55] put up today but uh these are real these
[1:11:58] are I'd like you to see it because it's
[1:12:00] a reality reality that you're maybe not
[1:12:02] into especially getting married my wife
[1:12:05] poked me on the arm whisper she says
[1:12:07] nobody's going to you know nobody's
[1:12:08] going to want to get married after this
[1:12:10] presentation
[1:12:11] today so it was more of a reality check
[1:12:14] than a teaching on money but uh what I
[1:12:17] liked is we had brother rap um married
[1:12:20] now and so he's a he's a good one I'm in
[1:12:22] a different season of my life now
[1:12:24] uh although i' I've done my best to live
[1:12:25] by some of these principles we had we
[1:12:27] had some school debt coming into the
[1:12:29] coming into the marriage and we had some
[1:12:31] things like that and then because we
[1:12:32] didn't make very much it was kind of
[1:12:34] hard but so I'm in a little bit
[1:12:36] different season it took me a while to
[1:12:38] catch up and catch things but uh they're
[1:12:40] at a great stage to be talking to you
[1:12:43] for the next stage of your life if God
[1:12:45] should have that for you because they're
[1:12:47] uh young married with three children so
[1:12:49] they're right in the right in the middle
[1:12:51] of reality of expenses coming up and
[1:12:53] that'll continue as they the kids get
[1:12:55] older and so I'm really glad and then
[1:12:58] also he's married to a Dutch girl and
[1:13:01] like you said they are I love the Dutch
[1:13:03] people I love them to death they're
[1:13:05] great matter of fact I whispered over to
[1:13:07] her leiz Beth I said you know the saying
[1:13:10] that if you're not Dutch you're not much
[1:13:13] that's just the way they feel about
[1:13:15] themselves and but they're frugal people
[1:13:17] they're not Frugal they're tight
[1:13:19] wads they are so tight with their money
[1:13:22] you know and that that's
[1:13:24] how I heard that's how copper wire was
[1:13:27] invented is two Dutchmen fighting over a
[1:13:34] penny you haven't heard that one Le Beth
[1:13:37] you haven't heard that one yet
[1:13:40] um but I I like to see um you know it's
[1:13:44] it's good to hear these things to hear
[1:13:45] the real numbers and also to hear that
[1:13:49] we know that God will God is our
[1:13:51] provider so we don't live in fear and a
[1:13:54] lot of young people with the economy uh
[1:13:57] my son just got married in March my son
[1:13:59] Solomon gine is getting ready married
[1:14:01] and the them and other ones that are
[1:14:03] heading into that it it is it is can be
[1:14:06] scary the environment of the financial
[1:14:08] thing because it is a lot of
[1:14:10] responsibility to take on to have a home
[1:14:11] today it is very expensive but I don't
[1:14:14] think we should live in fear um but we
[1:14:17] can't all we can't say to that uh and
[1:14:20] not be in action to pray and do
[1:14:22] something about our finances we can't
[1:14:24] just say well you know God will provide
[1:14:27] and and uh we'll just live on
[1:14:31] love and you know I don't like to hear
[1:14:34] those things cuz you have to you was
[1:14:38] wrong it's it's not reality and God
[1:14:41] wants us to have a sound ma mind and
[1:14:43] think about these things and uh you it
[1:14:46] does take things to be able to live in
[1:14:48] this life but God can provide for you
[1:14:50] and I've often said that God provides
[1:14:53] for the birds and and all those things
[1:14:56] God provides every day for them so why
[1:14:58] should we worry he provides that he does
[1:14:59] provide but for the birds they have to
[1:15:01] go out and find the worms they have to
[1:15:03] find their food and you have to do that
[1:15:04] as well you have to work you have to
[1:15:06] employ you can't just uh let these
[1:15:08] things go and expect uh nothing on your
[1:15:12] part expect things to come out of it so
[1:15:15] um you know real quickly uh we're in a
[1:15:18] little bit different season but when we
[1:15:19] were there it was tight it was hard and
[1:15:22] I think I gave my my wife a budget of
[1:15:24] this was 30 years ago cuz we just
[1:15:26] celebrated uh two weeks ago we
[1:15:28] celebrated our 30th Anniversary my wife
[1:15:31] and I yeah so thank you thank
[1:15:37] you yep it's awesome and we got these
[1:15:40] nice little mother of pearl rings for
[1:15:42] our 30th and um so we had it was nice
[1:15:46] because we had money to buy that now we
[1:15:48] didn't have that early on but we there
[1:15:51] was one year um we' always go try to go
[1:15:54] do something for anniversary even though
[1:15:55] we had the three three kids at that time
[1:15:58] and one year we one year we had enough
[1:16:00] bonus points at a motel for one night in
[1:16:02] Flint Michigan one night to go away so
[1:16:04] we got a babysitter it was probably Ike
[1:16:06] and Amanda babysitting our kids because
[1:16:08] we always left our kids with them one
[1:16:10] night the next year we did not have a
[1:16:12] dime to go out the year before we went
[1:16:15] that free Motel one night and we had
[1:16:16] some gift cards so we ate out with that
[1:16:18] the next year we didn't have anything so
[1:16:20] we decided to just do something and just
[1:16:22] stay home a St station Gideon and uh so
[1:16:27] the kids were downstairs we had our room
[1:16:29] upstairs and we just kind of Becca kind
[1:16:31] of dressed up the room nice you know and

[1:16:59] what are you guys trying to do start a
[1:17:06] fire oh man that was
[1:17:09] funny but
[1:17:11] um even when you get started a little
[1:17:14] late and you shouldn't start late you
[1:17:15] got an opportunity here to hear these
[1:17:17] things to put them into practice stay
[1:17:19] out of debt that's what it says if you
[1:17:21] at all possible in a debt driven age try
[1:17:25] to stay out of debt try to pay cash for
[1:17:27] things uh don't get Bound by credit
[1:17:30] that's what we encourage you and you
[1:17:31] have an opportunity to set order your
[1:17:33] life according to that right now instead
[1:17:35] of starting with thatt in a marriage or
[1:17:37] or any other thing don't get on these
[1:17:39] layaway plans because if you're on the
[1:17:41] layaway plan my dad used to say the
[1:17:44] layaway P plan is if you get out you pay
[1:17:46] for it till they lay you
[1:17:48] away and it's true so um I'll make make
[1:17:53] one more comment before the fall in the
[1:17:56] garden God's son and God's
[1:18:00] daughter Adam and Eve they were in
[1:18:03] control of everything as a Son of God
[1:18:07] nothing controlled them they controlled
[1:18:10] things with the power of God and with
[1:18:13] who they were they controlled the
[1:18:15] atmosphere they controlled the Earth
[1:18:17] this Earth was created for them to
[1:18:19] control after the fall things begin to
[1:18:22] try to control them so if God's
[1:18:25] restoring us through Redemption he's
[1:18:28] bringing Sons back to living in a way
[1:18:31] that things are not controlling us
[1:18:33] before you come to Christ before you
[1:18:34] have a birth if you got a sexual habit
[1:18:37] it can control you if you've got a lust
[1:18:39] problem it controls you if you got a
[1:18:41] financial problem it'll control you but
[1:18:43] when we come to the Lord and He redeems
[1:18:45] us and we're coming back to sons of God
[1:18:47] we should say Lord I don't want anything
[1:18:49] in this life to control me including my
[1:18:52] time
[1:18:54] but I want to walk as a son and daughter
[1:18:56] of God I want to be in control with
[1:18:58] God's help of everything in my life and
[1:19:00] the Dominion you've given me that I with
[1:19:03] the Lord's help will be in control of
[1:19:04] that dominion and I believe that's what
[1:19:05] Redemption is doing to uh For Us Praise
[1:19:08] the Lord let's stand I'm going to
[1:19:09] dismiss you we've already prayed brother
