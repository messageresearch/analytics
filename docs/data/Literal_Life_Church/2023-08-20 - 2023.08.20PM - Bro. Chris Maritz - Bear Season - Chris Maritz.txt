TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen praise the Lord my I could just do this all night long I don't think we need a sermon we'll just tell tell the things that the Lord has done for us and we can just praise him we can sing songs and I I would feel just really happy with that but um maybe we'll just say a few things I'm not sure just how the Lord will will lead us tonight in the in the in the sermon but we just want to give him the Reigns let him have full control this evening it's so nice to see all your youth together like this and praising God and worshiping him and you know it's what we live for we live to worship Our God Amen and when we worship Him it brings a presence into the to where we are and and we we are born to live in that presence you know we were made for that and so we just feel really good in his presence tonight just want to say thank you again to brother Paul sister Rebecca just been a lovely host to us and just been really generous and very kind and just praising God for for their example to us as a young pastor and wife and just really appreciate you brother Paul it's been a real strength to be here with you and just praising God for what he's is doing through his ministry amen amen let's just turn to the word and we'll just see where the Lord takes us with us tonight um man I just I've just been so moves with the testimonies and the singing and the and the worship you know it's hard to change gears like this but we'll just see where the Lord takes us tonight and and see what he has for us amen I want to speak on the subject um a bear season bear season and there's uh that's not a teddy bear that is the grizzly bear and they have a really bad temper you do not want to mess with grizzly bears and uh but you know this is maybe what it's what it feels like maybe if we could if we could exchange the the bear we could put your school there maybe that's what school feels like for you you know we're going back to school and that's kind of how it feels you got this big bear sitting there and and it looks like this big enormous thing and you know we've had such a wonderful summer amen and we've have we hear the testimonies and we we hear what God has done and and uh and it's amazing and praise God and we're around around friends of like Precious faith and and this is a good feeling amen this is where we feel strong this is where we feel encouraged and so when we think of going back to school you know it's like um I'm gonna be alone I'm gonna be with friends again that don't believe the same way I believe and and maybe you you're dreading going back to school and and it's like this big bear just waiting you know but you don't have to be afraid amen it's bear season so we're just going to look at this a little bit adjustable encourages first Samuel 17 and 32 the Bible tells us and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth how many is a youth here tonight and he a man of war from his youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him and thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing Heath he hath defied the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee amen let's burn our heads One More Time Lord we just thank you for your word we see what you did for David just little David a Shepherd boy oh God but you called him for a great work and so we see how you moved upon his life and you took care of the needs that he had and the challenges he faced Lord we asked that you would just come tonight and Lord you see the youth that are here this evening may you meet the challenges that that they face so God we know you will meet them may you give us courage and Faith oh God as we step forward into the change of seasons Lord as we go into this fall season and we're going to school again Lord will you would encourage us through your word tonight Jesus Christ's name amen maybe seated so David had a had a great challenge it was a great boast that had been made and and David witnessed this this boast and even though David was a youth you know he wasn't trained in the in the Art of War and and maybe he was not a deacon in the church and maybe he's not a preacher or something like that just just a youth you know just one of the the local Youth and you know maybe just maybe he's afraid to speak out or maybe he's just a little guy you know he's the little guy behind the scenes and even his brothers were kind of like what are you doing here David you know you're just trying to get out of your chores and trying to get out of the work you're supposed to be doing and you know but he was about his father's business he was bringing them their food you know but here's David and he's just a he's just a youth we we say it so casually just the youth well I want to tell the youth tonight that you are you are greatly feared from your enemy because if you had to recognize who you are if you had to stand your ground and recognize who the enemy is and recognize what God has done for you amen the enemy would be shaking in his boots and so he's going to do everything in his power to keep you afraid to keep you subdued to keep you feeling like you've got nothing to offer that you're not strong enough that you don't have enough Faith but my brother and sister tonight I wanted to let you know he's afraid of you he is scared out of his mind of you you know back home we we are coming into hunting season and I don't know when the hunting seasons are like here but but back home coming into September it's hunting season so the brothers back home you know they they're they're um they're cleaning their rifles you know if those bears in our mountains there could see what our brothers are up to man they would be shaking in their boots right why because it's bear season and you know you have every right as a hunter when you go and buy your tag that tag has been paid for right it's you you had to exchange money for it it was a purchase made and so now you've paid for your tag now you've got a license to Kill Bear right you are fully qualified you don't have to worry you don't have to fear the law or anything like that you have been you have been put into into you've been engaged you've been you've been activated you are now a bear hunter and you've got every right to go hunting bear so what do you do you go home because of your anticipation of this you go and prepare for the hunt right so what do you do you go and find all the right bullets for the right for the right rifle maybe you have a a 30 odd six and so you get your 30 odd six out and and you start you know shining the barrel up and you start making sure the Scopes mounted just ride and then you get all your bullets right you start loading in the the ammunition into your rifle you know you're you're checking all the magazines making sure everything's working making sure you've got the right caliber right and that's what we're doing here tonight we are loading our guns right we are sharpening our swords we are shining our Shields we are we are girding ourselves up for the battle that lays ahead but we don't have to be afraid for this battle that we are facing amen is bear season we're allowed to destroy the enemy we don't have to be afraid of the enemy and so that's what David you know as a youth he comes on the scene here and he realizes that there's fear this fear has gripped the army of Israel and he doesn't understand what this fear is because he has seen God work in his life now you got to remember David you know he was he was anointed to be a king and you might say well I wasn't anointed to be a king but the Bible does say that God has made us Kings and Priests okay so we have the same Authority in our kingdom so we each and every one of us has has a little kingdom that God has given us authority over so we have been made Kings and Priests over our our families or the situations or our friends or lives our little kingdoms that God has given us to govern over and so but God has called us and and he doesn't just call us and say well go do this and in and then hope for the best no he knows what's inside of you he knows what he's prepared to do for you also you've got all the Angels you've got the word you've got everything to back you in your journey but isn't that amazing how that God sends Samuel a prophet to go and identify the next king of Israel and so he sends a prophet with a word to come and identify this young man then he says God has chosen you to be the next king over Israel now I'm sure the little boy standing there would be like wow that's amazing that sounds like a lot of fun but you know what he had to wait there was a lot of training that had to happen before he could become king see God had to prepare this man for the work that he had allotted to him right so God prepares him and he and and isn't this amazing that as David goes through his life that that David has this experience where he kills the lion and a bear a lion and a bear as a youth and God Was preparing him so that when he came to this great moment in front of all Israel and there's this Philistine a giant how many is facing Giants right he had this giant he had to face it was it was it was an impossible thing you know this is a giant this is someone who's bigger he's stronger he has been trained from his youth he knows the Art of War he's skilled at it you know the Devil he's been at this business for a long time he knows how to set traps he knows how to scheme and plan and lie and manipulate he knows how to do all that stuff right so what are we going to do as a youth well we've just seen what God has done for us in our walk with the Lord amen so God gives us experiences so that we can have confidence in the Lord when we Face our Giants but see we have to we have to be willing to go after that bear and the lion in our life thy servant is if I just go back maybe one thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smote him most of us I think would run the other direction right but there was something in David see God put something in us we don't understand it but we we see a need we see somebody who's crying out and we start praying and we get behind that cause or we read our Bible and we find a scripture to fortify someone you know there's something inside of us that that wants to defy the works of the enemy we want to fight against that that's just it's a it's a nature of a Christian to fight against the works of the devil to stand against wrong amen and so this this little youth he goes after him and he smites him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose against him I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him and my servants slew both The Lion and the bear now I've seen Lions face to face okay we have there's a lion in South Africa brother Brian Jones's Farm and and his name is big boy and that's the reason they call him big boys he's really big and this Lion Man you come walking up to the cage that he's in and he gets up on that cage and he gets his big claws up on the fence like that and he does that big low guttural kind of growl man you feel really little and then you think of David grabbing him by his beard you see we don't we don't we underestimate the power that is inside of us we underestimate the god that we serve and he's with us everywhere we go you know we underestimate you know these things The Lion and the bear can seem so big so overwhelming right so insurmountable but it's it's just not the case for the believer because God is with you so the bear is a type of the enemy you'll find this throughout the scriptures we normally associate a lion as a good type in scripture but remember Satan copies God and so Satan is also typed as a lion he goes around as the Bible tells us as a roaring lion be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil uh adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour our enemy is a roaring lion he's always got something to say he's always making a lot of noise always making a big boost just like this Philistine was making a big boast so The Lion and the Bear in scripture is typed as animals or beasts that destroy men we know that they are used many times to type the powers that are used by Satan like in we find in Daniel 7 and in Revelation 13 I've got a scripture here from Revelation 13 2 and it says and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet whereas the feet of a bear see it uses the the analogy of a bear the metaphor and he's his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority so we see how that even the Bible will use lions and bears to show the great power or the great strength of the enemy right the Beast made up of all the powers into one form so if it wasn't bad enough that it was just a bear or just a lion hear this Beast system right which we face every day which you're going to face in your schools right that thing has become one one creature and it is God a lion and a bear mixed in there this Beast would be a composite of all the powers in Daniel they represent the Gentile kingdoms and the the medes and Persians and and the Greeks and Babylonians right all coming into one image right and here we see that this is the thing that we face in our lives in our walk as Believers is the system but it's it's comprised of these different animals right different characteristics different powers and it looks a certain way like a lion and a bear you will find many times in the Bible that The Lion and the bear being used together you know as of one like if as if one isn't bad enough Lamentations 3 10 says he was unto me as a bear lying in weight as a lion in secret places showing that the devil sets a snare he sets a trap for the believer my dad was telling a story when they were walking through the Wilderness in South Africa and and here they are and they and and they're just on foot walking through the bushfelt and my dad said he saw a lion on their on their right hand side a lioness and my dad goes over to Brother Brian he says hey there's a lioness over here you know I mean these are real lions okay this is not a zoo or something you know so this lioness is is is just walking off to the distance here and he says yeah yeah I know and so as they're walking they see another lioness on the left so he tells brother Brian hey brother Brian there's the Lioness on the left-hand side now he says yeah I know and so he noticed brother Brian is getting nervous also and he's watching this and he says he says if you haven't noticed there's lionesses behind us also right so they're forming this this like a shoehorn right the lionesses are smart you know they're hunters and they and they know how to scheme and and set snares and traps and and if you're not watching for those things before you know it you've walked into this big trap right so God's given us eyes to see so we can recognize the dangers around us so when you're in school and and a friend asks you over to some place or you or you're supposed to go to do something you know don't get caught in the Trap somewhere right have your eyes wide open and be aware of the of the lionesses around you right and so you'll see how how they were walking like this and and and and my dad said they were just walking a little way and this Brian turns around he says he says what you don't know is that there's some lionesses waiting up ahead as well right so we're boxed in so he says because that is their Instinct that's how these animals work they know how to communicate to each other and form a box like this and then push you into into an ambush like that he says what we've got to do is break their Instinct see they think they're in control and they think that we are going to based on our Instinct we are going to run at the first sign of trouble that's exactly what the Lioness wants you to do is run right because when you run you isolate yourself from the group and then and then you're an easy target for the lioness right and so he was saying you know we're going to we need to break that we need to break this this mode they're in hunting mode they're in they're in in kill mode you know they're they're all fixated on this one plan he says we need to show them there's a higher plan there's a different plan at work there's another Instinct working together we got to stay together he says get all the coffee coffee mugs together and get all the pillows together and we'll just pick a side and let's start pushing through this way right we don't want to get to the end we want to we want to break out of this thing right now and so they what did they do they they took all these these coffee mugs and they they picked what they thought was the weaker side and they went after this lioness on this side and just started throwing coffee mugs at it and and pillows and all kinds of things this lioness now it doesn't have a clue what's going on this is different I've never been treated like this no one's ever stood up to me like this before right this is unusual why aren't they running why aren't they afraid hallelujah amen why are they scared of their minds you know we we do this with the Impalas and we do this with the other animals and man they just we just scare them practically to death you just give a little Roar and the animal almost faints you know from from Fear right you know the Devil comes and it gives a little Roar and everybody shotters and we're not Mage like that my brother and sister we've been made more than Overcomers it's bear season amen so so it's time to break out if you see that you're you're in a trap or something like that just break out and the enemy doesn't know what to do with you just like that that poor stain huh Goliath when he was standing there he didn't know what to do with this little boy who Do You Think You Are huh I'm a Son of God and you're defying the armies of the Living God you've come against my God you've come on my turf you've come on on my grounds this is my ground this is my family this is my school this is my education right claim your ground my brother and sister you know we were we were just before we came here at some friends over from New Zealand and uh he wanted to go on a little day trip and so we we you know we wanted to go see some sightseeing so I took him to Hell's Gate I know that sounds really weird having a pastor take another young man to Hell's Gate now it's not literally Hell's Gate obviously right I know it sounds funny but it's just a location called Hell's Gate okay so they called it housegate because of how dangerous it is in this location it's a big canyon there between the in the big mountains there in British Columbia and in this massive Canyon there's this kind of like a pinch point where the water's really uh increase in speed and in turbulence and in current and so this little Point here it became impassable for the people that were navigating this and trading and you know and so forth and so this became a very dangerous area it became dangerous even for the for the animals and for salmon and so forth you know it's just because of its strong currents and and the fact that people can't even get through there with a little boat so it's called House gate for this reason it is a dangerous location right and here I thought it was so funny here we are visiting Hell's Gate you know we have complete Authority there we we bought our ticket we went down for it's the first time I went down with a gondola you know it's kind of a weird sensation normally you're going up the mountain with a gondola right but here we're going down into this Canyon into house gate and it's a it's an interesting kind of feeling you know this is Hal's gay but I'm not afraid I can walk all over the place here we are possessing the gates of our enemies right so we we just we just had complete Authority we didn't have to worry about anything we could stand right there we we noticed the dangers we saw those things but they made a bridge to get over the danger God bridged a gap for us right so we don't have to fear those things and even though there's great danger and there's great trap set and there's great great obstacles that need to be overcome God has made us more than Overcomers greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world you know there's such an amazing thing that I I saw there with the salmon everybody here knows what salmon is and and they it's a fish by the way right so they said just make sure everyone's awake so the salmon you know they they're out there in the vast ocean you know we can call that their summer right in the summertime they're just out there in the big Ocean and the salt water they've got all this room to move and and feel free and and feel relaxed and eat all that they can possibly eat and they feel really good but then there comes a season there comes a time when when something starts to pull something starts to call they were made for a reason my brother and sister they there's something on the inside that that there's a purpose there's an instinct that has to be manifested in in their lives and and even though there's great dangers that are ahead it doesn't matter that that manifestation that purpose has to be accomplished otherwise there will be just it'll they'll just die right so these these salmon they have to swim up these currents so they'll find you know here they are in salt water and and they'll find these little rivers that go up into the mainland in British Columbia especially the Fraser River but you know it's like think of the mentality here out there in the ocean there's no current there's there's really nothing to to Really worry about in that sense you know you've got all the space you need and you can swim to your heart's content and you're happy and there's lots of food now you're going to make a decision to go swim up some current some River that is fraught with Danger where there's Bears right where there's humans fishermen and to boot it's up River I've I've been in that Fraser River that current in that Fraser River is incredibly strong why would something make a decision to go swim upstream against all the current you know I I was gonna have I'm not going to do it we just don't have time tonight but you have a brother standing over here and we put like I don't know 10 Brothers over here and we have these brothers Walk This Way and this brother's got to walk this way through them right it's uncomfortable it's uneasy you're going against the flow it's not normal right just you know this world wants us to go with the current just go with the current you know just accept everything and just just be just be tolerant and just be this and just be that and and this is the way the world is and just accept it and and be tolerant of all those things you know you can fill in the gaps tonight but you know we're not made that way my brother and sister we were made to swim against the current not to be different and not to be awkward but there's a purpose there's a reason there's a new birth that's waiting for us at the end of of the of the Stream you know they called out for the salmon they call that homecoming season that's when when the salmon decides I'm going north I'm I'm done swimming around in this big ocean it's nice but but I want to fulfill my purpose I've got enemies to conquer I've got things to do for the Lord and for his Kingdom's sake to preach the gospel to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and and and to believe and to have faith and pray and all those things and that includes all of us we all have that Ministry amen we all are are pulling them out of the fire so to speak and and so there comes a time when we realize it's time for me to swim against the current it's time for me to become who I was called to be I've been raised for such a time as this we don't have to be afraid don't worry you know if you had to start thinking about man I know around that certain band there's this great big grizzly bear and he gets a lot of them you know he gets over into that Creek and he just gives a big SWAT like that and he knocks all those salmon out of the creek and and then he eats them alive you know and you could start you know creating these stories in your mind your imagine nation and he can really scare yourself you know this is going to be hard this is going to be tough and my brother and sister we've been made to do this this is inside of us and you will never be happy you will never reproduce you will never have a new birth or a new life until you've gone through those experiences and you've conquered the bear and the lion in your life face your Giants don't be afraid of them just like Joshua and Caleb but you know when they when they heard the reports and they were in the minority don't be don't be surprised when you're in the minority regarding these things but you know he recognized that is my land that's where I belong that's my home that's my territory and I want to gain my land back and so what did they do they put the word first and they go and fight the Giants Drive the Giants off your land see it's one thing to be afraid of the Giants it's another thing to recognize Who You Are you are more than a match for the bear you're more than a match for for your Giants amen so we see this little salmon they start to swim upstream it's it's it's an incredible thing to witness they've got all the food and all that nutrition and everything they have need of already inside of them and then they start swimming Upstream this is like going to school now it's literally when you go to school you are going the opposite direction that everybody else is going spiritually speaking right and so you go to school and and you go up the stream and and you'll notice how that some of these areas it looks impossible how does a fish how does a salmon about that big you know get through some of these areas it looks so impossible unreasonable or unfair but yet they salmon make it every year there's salmon going up that River it's an incredible thing what a testimony if a fish can do that with a Basic Instincts that he has what can a son and daughter of God do but you know some of these areas you get into some of the these these Waters right and you can imagine what I'm talking about but you get into some of these Waters where it gets really shallow right and and you start to find that there's less and less water to swim in you know maybe you come around the corner and and and and this in the trial has been set for you you know this has been all planned out by the devil you know he's got just the right trap just the right thing and before you know it you find yourself in really shallow water and it's really hard to get swimming and get some momentum and get moving but you can't go back because if you're going back or if you stop the prophet tells if you stop you're backsliding so if you stop swimming what happens you're backsliding you're losing ground you're giving ground back to the enemy don't stop swimming don't ever stop swimming you'll make it through it might take a little longer to get through the shallow areas and it might be a little rougher and you might bump up against some rocks and get a little scrape here you'll scrape there but you'll make it through you're made for that that's what that salmon is made for it has just the right characteristics to get through those little shallow Waters and if you ever watch it man it's incredible they just kind of bounce around and flip-flop this way and I know it looks ridiculous sometimes our lives look ridiculous huh and we kind of flip this way and flop that way and you know we're just we're just trying to get Upstream we're trying to get home right and so we do everything we can to make it home we take we dig deep for that strength to take us home you know and these little salmon they just they just have an amazing ability but you know God has has these little safe havens also in the in the river as they're going Upstream you'll find that there there'll be little pockets so you know all the salmon will converge and come around a Bend or something and then there'll be a big rock and there'll be just this little area where there's no current you know and you'll see the salmon will make their way into this little this little pocket of water and and they'll just rest there for a little while they're just getting ready right and then another salmon will come in there and says how are you doing praise God we're gonna we're gonna keep pressing the battle I had such a good year at camp and and God did something for me and I and I've put it under the blood and I've been healed and this and that and you're just talking what are you doing you're you're strengthening one another because you're gonna you have to keep going you can't stop there's as nice as this is as nice as an evening like this is where we can sing and praise my brother and sister we can't stop here we weren't made to just stay here we were made to go worship Him in school we're made to worship him in our places of work and be a testimony and be a bright and a Shining Light and a dark crazy world so it's nice these little little safe havens God gives us we appreciate them and we encourage one another maybe you'll see someone come in and oh man he got really hit hard by that last Rock back there and you know and so you just kind of get up close to him and say Hey brother I'm praying for you you know I noticed you got you got hit really hard with that last one but you're still swimming praise God you're still swimming you're you're gonna make it right because we've already we are we've been made more than Overcomers and we don't have to be afraid you're going to make it this is what we do one for another we gird each other up lift up the feeble among you right pray one for another and I think that's so admirable and such a good idea brother Paul to to pray for the Youth is to go to go to school this year amen why we we're in that little puddle of water there we're in that little moment where we have a little rest a little time to strengthen one another but you can't stay there we've got to we've got to decide okay you take a deep breath I'm gonna do this Lord I'm putting my life in your hands I'm trusting in you right greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world I don't know what's around this next Rock I don't know what's around this next Bend I don't know there's maybe a grizzly bear or maybe there's maybe there's a fisherman and he said a trap or a net there's something there oh God but but I can't give up now I can't give up now I don't know what this is inside of me I don't know why I'm why what would make me go against the flow like this what makes me like this my brother and sister God puts something inside of each and every one of us we will never be happy until we have that full New Birth have that experience with the Lord keep swimming anyway these little fish oh it's not in my notes I don't know why I'm going in this direction by these little fish you know they they start to get upstream and they get to Hell's Gate Hell's Gate takes a lot of the salmon out a lot of them fall by the wayside there because the current is just too strong but you know maybe they would have a little conversation amongst themselves and say this is coming up Hell's Gate is coming up but we have a scripture that we shall possess the gates of his enemies and I want to I want to say to you youth remember when you're talking about Siege and you're talking about someone someone's Gates Right who is the defender and who is the aggressor right the one with the gates is the one trying to defend himself he's the one that's boxed in okay and the other one is the one who's the aggressor he's the one who's the one who is sieging besieging the city right so when we say we are we we are possessing the gates of our enemy I mean he's the one who's trying to defend himself he's the one who's cowering behind a little wall right he's the one with the gates not you you're the one who's free you're the one who has the siege weapons you're the one who is free to roam and to move and and and to muster food and all these kinds of things the enemy is the one who's running out of time right you ever seen a Siege before right so we we get to this place at Hell's Gate and these little salmon they just it's quite a remarkable Story how that how that someone had to intervene on their behalf to ensure that they would survive so so God allowed it you know in his great plant for a man to come down right and to build a bridge to build a system for those little salmon it's a little way around Hell's Gate and so if you look down into Hell's Gate there you'll see these big concrete structures okay at first I thought they were for Gates and for for damning up the water maybe you know in case there's flooding or something like that but that's not what it's for it's for the fish this massive like I can't imagine the the the the feat it would be to build these massive concrete structures in Hell's Gate like that in a place that is where where no human being should be you know it is a very dangerous place and yet somehow somebody made a way Somebody went down there and engineer he saw the need of those fish and he knew this was this this little spot here is a bad spot this little spot here it gets a lot of fish so I'm gonna build something oh my is the Waymaker amen his name is power amen just like we sang that song and so what do they do they they built this little Weir system so that the fish will still have to swim he's not he's not taking the fish out of the water and and you know and and and taking all your trials away and taking all of your struggles away that's not what he's doing right but he makes a way for you to go around the death trap that's what our Lord does for us amen just like he will do for you at school God makes a way for you everything you're going to face at school you are going to be stronger you're going to be more than capable to handle the situation there's no trial that God allows to come by your way that you are not capable of handling right and God makes a way of Escape every single time we just have to recognize that right so this little salmon come up there and they find those little side walls and they go around right and then they go all the way they go all the way around right and they find that little Homeland you know what happens to that salmon they actually go through a physical change when before they get to their place of birth a physical change they actually become red all over totally red you know that really spoke to me covered the blood of Jesus Christ right when they get there they are totally red their whole body has changed they they get this hump on their back like this and their whole form has changed I think of Jacob when he met the Lord right his his walk changed right he they noticed when they looked at Jacob from that day on they knew he was a prince with God amen praise the Lord all right well I'm not gonna I'm not going to finish my sermon tonight I just I don't know why we went that direction but but you are salmon okay you are the salmon we are we are we are swimming Upstream but we don't have to be afraid we don't have to worry about the The Lion and the bear and if I can just close maybe with this you know the prophet talks about Bear Country and he says how that even there's a there's a forest you know and he says even the the trees you know they sway a certain way and and it's even the trees that area is called the the place of the Giants and he says those trees move a certain way and it's kind of an eerie place you know it's just a a just an eerie place right and he's a hunter and so he knows you know he was called to go and hunt this bear and and he and it's amazing that brother Brandon when he's called to go hunt that bear and take care of that that issue that was in the woods there remember when he's when he's doing that he comes across a lion a bobcat a mountain lion right that's what he comes across first and so he sees this mountain lion and then he and then he goes after the bear it's amazing just how God allowed that in his life when he goes to destroy this bear and even there's this man that comes to him and he starts kind of making fun of him and says negative things to brother Branham not realizing brother brother Branham is therefore his as a courtesy to him right see sometimes we we don't realize what God has done for us in our day God sent us a hunter right a Woodsman somebody understands the woods somebody who is a ranger right and he knows the the the quirks and the the snares and the little characteristics of the bear and those things he can read the signs right he's got eyes to see all those things God sent us somebody as a courtesy to take care of the Bear in our life and how did he do that he gave us the ammunition he gave us the word that is how we overcome we overcome with the word amen let's Stand Together the prophet says that won't stop David he'll go right on out there after that fellow with a little slingshot you might say brother Chris I don't even have a slingshot that's okay because he can make something out of nothing with a little slingshot of ask anything in my name and it shall be given I don't care the doctors can laugh everybody else can make fun of him he'll go after him anyhow bringing that sheep back to the fold yes sir is God's child take your hand off of him knock this line down then the line rose up he grabbed him by the beard and killed him excuse me a little bitty Ruddy boy probably weigh 80 or 90 pounds right I don't know just how you feel and what's going on in your hearts or maybe if you have something that's nagging at you or you've got a fear of going back to school or work or you know just maybe sad that you know this beautiful summer has ended but my brother and sister don't forget this summer was here to give us strength for the journey that we're about to face and I personally am a little more excited about what's ahead than what is behind us because we have been raised for such a time as this God has God's word will meet every condition God's word will meet every condition there's nothing that you're going to face in school this year that his word cannot take care of his holy spirit cannot lead you through we have been made more than Overcomers amen praise the Lord Brother Paul amen
