[0:00] thank you
[0:16] I'm not sure if we're seeing each other
[0:31] but we'll see how far along we get give
[0:33] me a
[0:34] sign if you think we're good to go
[0:37] uh Revelation chapter 3 verses 5 and 6.
[0:43] um reads heated overcometh the same
[0:46] shall be clothed in white raiment and I
[0:48] will not blot out his name out of The
[0:51] Book of Life
[0:52] but I will confess his name before my
[0:54] father and before his Holy Angels he
[0:57] that hath an ear to hear he that has an
[1:01] ear let them hear what the spirit saith
[1:03] unto the churches
[1:04] we just asked the word of prayer here
[1:07] Heavenly Father we just uh thank you for
[1:09] your goodness and your grace to us Lord
[1:10] I Thank You for Your Presence you're
[1:12] among us I just pray oh father that you
[1:14] would just uh be with us this evening
[1:16] Lord I just pray that you'd anoint my
[1:18] words anoint your understanding father
[1:20] we might see more clearly about the book
[1:23] of life and your characteristics of of
[1:26] justice and mercy Lord and grace of God
[1:28] in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:31] you may be seated
[1:42] we'll see if this works or not
[1:44] what I wanted to start out by pointing
[1:46] out in this in this scripture it shows
[1:49] the importance of of overcoming in the
[1:52] age because the Imp it starts out heated
[1:54] overcometh uh the same will be clothed
[1:57] in a white Raymond his name will be
[1:58] blotted out of the book of life so the
[2:01] importance of overcoming because if you
[2:03] overcome your names in The Book of Life
[2:05] and then the implication is if you don't
[2:09] overcome
[2:10] then it has it has a serious result your
[2:13] name could be blotted out of the book of
[2:15] life and then verse six how do we
[2:18] overcome it says he that hath an ear let
[2:20] him hear what the spirit says to the
[2:22] churches so we we overcome by hearing
[2:25] what God hearing and receiving what God
[2:28] is speaking and continuing to hear
[2:30] continuing to listen as God speaking
[2:32] that in each age the message to Sardis
[2:36] ends the way every message every Church
[2:38] age ends without all important reminder
[2:41] hear what the spirit is continuing to
[2:44] say to the churches
[2:47] um it's like we talked about last time
[2:49] and this will be on page one in the
[2:51] notes
[2:52] um we talked last time about names that
[2:55] are in the Book of Life and then names
[2:58] aren't recorded all in the Book of Life
[3:00] I read from a
[3:02] read from the quote from the sardisian
[3:04] church age brother Branham says we'll
[3:06] certainly will actually show by
[3:07] scripture that multitudes who are not
[3:09] even born again will go into eternal
[3:11] life as strange as that may sound and I
[3:13] think that's interesting to see because
[3:15] as we look at the topic like the book of
[3:17] life it could almost
[3:19] um especially a topic like this season
[3:21] we're going to focus on that how some
[3:23] names are blotted from the book and
[3:26] sometimes God's justice can seem
[3:28] overwhelming
[3:30] and sometimes when you're dealing with
[3:32] kids either as a parent or as a teacher
[3:34] it seems you get caught in the Catch-22
[3:36] I'm either going to be just or I'm going
[3:39] to be merciful and you've got there's a
[3:41] good comp and there's a bad cop but
[3:43] they're not mutually exclusive it's not
[3:45] that God is either just or merciful he's
[3:48] both and sometimes we feel like we get
[3:50] in a position where I'm going to either
[3:51] be just or merciful that's not how it is
[3:53] at all and as we look at the book of
[3:55] life we see God's justice
[3:59] but we also see his Mercy like we saw
[4:03] last time there are people's names who
[4:04] were who who weren't who who were like
[4:08] Christ when the parable and he sowed the
[4:11] the wheat seed then someone else came
[4:13] along
[4:14] um the the evil man came along after
[4:16] that and sowed tears but those tears
[4:19] still enjoy the mercy of God in this
[4:21] life it's not like God is throwing
[4:23] thunderbolts at them the whole time the
[4:25] rain falls and they have they can have a
[4:28] good life too God they still enjoy God's
[4:30] mercy now
[4:32] and then we're going to look at names
[4:33] blogger from The Book of Life we're
[4:35] presented people are presented with a
[4:37] choice
[4:38] um
[4:39] like in Joshua 24 15 choose you this day
[4:42] whom you will serve you can choose bail
[4:44] if you want to serve week or or as for
[4:46] me and my house will serve the Lord and
[4:49] God is just to let you make that choice
[4:52] and then let you enjoy the results or
[4:54] the consequences of that choice
[4:57] First Kings 18 21 says this is at this
[5:00] is at Mount Carmel Elijah said how long
[5:02] will you halt between two opinions if
[5:05] Baal be God will serve Baal but if God
[5:07] be God to serve him and we can't we
[5:10] can't stay on the middle of the fence
[5:11] for a long time the only get we the only
[5:13] thing we get by sitting on the fence is
[5:15] splinters in our behind we have to get
[5:17] off the fence and make a decision which
[5:19] way are we actually going to uh to make
[5:21] a stand because what we're going to see
[5:23] this evening as we look at why names get
[5:26] blotted from The Book of Life is the
[5:28] idolatry and the Book of Life are two
[5:31] things that aren't going to go together
[5:34] you you can't choose your own God and to
[5:38] also expect God to let everything work
[5:41] together for good idolatry in The Book
[5:44] of Life they just don't go together I'll
[5:48] take a look at the couple Old Testament
[5:49] scriptures here perhaps we can turn in
[5:52] our Bibles
[5:53] um sometimes it could be nice not having
[5:55] a screen because we actually have to get
[5:56] our Bibles out and we can then we can
[5:58] open them and look at them
[6:00] um the book of Deuteronomy chapter 29.
[6:03] when we look in the Old Testament we see
[6:06] that when the Old Testament speaks of
[6:08] names being blotted from The Book of
[6:09] Life
[6:10] it's almost always in connection with
[6:13] involvement and idolatry
[6:16] and we'll see uh the first example we'll
[6:19] take a look at this from the book of
[6:20] Deuteronomy chapter 29
[6:24] and verse 16.
[6:30] for you and this is a Moses speaking to
[6:33] the children of Israel for you know how
[6:35] we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and
[6:38] how we came to the Nations which he
[6:40] passed by you have seen their
[6:42] Abominations and their Idols wooden
[6:44] Stones silver and gold which were among
[6:46] them we went by and saw them you've seen
[6:49] their Abominations you've seen all that
[6:51] then he says lest there should be among
[6:54] you man or woman or family or tribe
[6:56] whose heart is turned away this day from
[6:59] the Lord Our God to go and serve the
[7:01] gods of these nations lest there should
[7:04] be among you a root that beareth Gall
[7:06] and world he repeats that Lester should
[7:08] be among you Lester should be among you
[7:10] because we have seen so much of God
[7:12] we've seen so much of his goodness and
[7:14] Grace for us he provided for us on the
[7:16] way through the Wilderness he did all
[7:18] these things for us and lest as we go
[7:21] through the mall unless as we go through
[7:23] these shopping centers and we see these
[7:24] other things of this world that we want
[7:25] to go after lest we should have that
[7:27] this listen he says Lester should be
[7:30] that
[7:32] and it come to pass when he hears the
[7:34] words of this curse that he should bless
[7:36] himself in his heart saying hey I'll
[7:38] have peace even though I walk in the
[7:40] imagination of my heart I'll have the
[7:43] story of the ends happily ever after
[7:44] even if I do what I want to do
[7:47] even when I'm going away from turning my
[7:49] back on God I'm going to get the best of
[7:51] both worlds that's what Moses is talking
[7:53] about though I walk in the imagination
[7:55] of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst
[7:58] he says the Lord will not spare him you
[8:03] can't have the best of both worlds
[8:04] because then the anger of the Lord and
[8:07] his jealousy shall smoke against that
[8:09] man and all the curses that are written
[8:12] in this book shall lie upon them
[8:14] and the Lord shall blot out his name
[8:17] from under heaven
[8:19] and here is the first place where we see
[8:21] but one of the first places we see in
[8:23] the Old Testament where the name being
[8:25] blotted out from the book has this
[8:27] connection with involvement in idolatry
[8:31] and brother Brandon says in the church
[8:32] age book he says here in Deuteronomy 29
[8:35] is pronounce the curse against idolatry
[8:38] or spiritual fornication if we think
[8:41] about the sin of fornication that's a
[8:44] serious sin that this is a complete
[8:46] betrayal of a trust relationship that's
[8:49] exactly how serious it is to God when we
[8:52] turn our heart away from him as just
[8:54] like your boyfriend or girlfriends are
[8:56] are are cheating on you and and and that
[8:59] happened the pain that God's heart has I
[9:01] think the book of Jeremiah talks about
[9:03] how how God cries in his heart God
[9:05] suffers pain he can have that and that's
[9:08] how the sin of fornication affects God
[9:10] that's what idolatry is
[9:13] is the tribe that turned to idolatry was
[9:17] to have its name blotted out and this
[9:20] warning that we see in the book of
[9:22] Deuteronomy is actually it actually
[9:25] happens
[9:26] there are there are there are two tribes
[9:29] that have um several times I they they
[9:32] give in to the tendency for idolatry you
[9:35] see first of all in the book of um
[9:37] judges I think it's chapter 17 at the
[9:40] end of the Book of Judges
[9:42] um Israel is characterized in those days
[9:45] there was no king in Israel there was no
[9:47] absolute but every man did that which
[9:49] was right in his own eyes and I listened
[9:52] to that summary and that reminds us of
[9:54] the world that we live in there's no
[9:56] absolute everybody does what's right in
[9:59] their own eyes and they think they
[10:00] should have the best results in spite of
[10:02] the decision that they make well on
[10:04] Judges chapter 17 you have a young man
[10:07] named Micah and I think he's a I think
[10:10] um I think he is an ephraimite and um he
[10:14] ends up stealing some money from his
[10:17] mother and then he ends up getting
[10:20] caught I believe for and he or feels bad
[10:22] about me confesses it to his mother and
[10:24] she says oh wow you're such a good boy
[10:25] do you confess that you can have the
[10:26] money anyway and they end up making an
[10:28] idol in their house
[10:30] and this is an Ephraim and later he ends
[10:34] up getting a another man to come and be
[10:36] his his priest that's not a uh the other
[10:39] man that comes along is a levite so
[10:41] Micah recognizes this man is a better
[10:44] priest than I am because I'm not a
[10:46] levite
[10:47] but um the the Dan Knights who had their
[10:52] possession in the southern part of
[10:54] Israel that's what they were given they
[10:56] were having a hard time possession of
[10:57] the land that God had given them so they
[10:58] said let's go somewhere easier and they
[11:00] go all the way up to the north part of
[11:01] Israel
[11:02] and as they're going along they see this
[11:05] man Mike and I see this priest I said
[11:07] let's get this priest to come with us
[11:09] the priest moves out he goes to the
[11:11] highest bidder takes his false gods with
[11:13] him and they go up and smite the danites
[11:16] so this idolatry begins in Ephraim and
[11:19] then it's transported up to Dan and
[11:22] these seeds of idolatry are sown and
[11:25] they start to Fester
[11:26] later the children of Israel after after
[11:29] David dies after Solomon dies Solomon's
[11:33] son rehoboam becomes king
[11:35] and 10 of the tribes follow rehoboam
[11:37] Judah sorry 10 of the tribes followed
[11:40] jeroboam and just Judah and Benjamin I
[11:43] believe it is stay with King rehabalam
[11:46] Solomon's son
[11:47] well there's a place in Ephraim that's
[11:50] Bethel that's pretty close to Judah and
[11:52] Jerusalem and King jeroboam has this
[11:55] fear that if I don't give the people a
[11:57] place to come and offer their sacrifices
[12:00] they're going to keep going to Jerusalem
[12:02] and they're going to slowly trickle out
[12:04] of my church and go to rehoboam's church
[12:06] and I don't want that so jeroboam he
[12:10] ended up instituting a system of
[12:11] idolatry they're in Bethel in the
[12:13] southern part of Israel close to where
[12:15] Jerusalem would be and he does the same
[12:18] place in the north part of Israel Dan
[12:20] which is really far away he says these
[12:22] people it's too much for them to try to
[12:24] make the trip all the way down to
[12:25] Jerusalem too much for them to make
[12:27] their way all the way down to Bethel I'm
[12:29] just going to make another altar up
[12:30] there so it's a religion of convenience
[12:34] and these two tribes they completely go
[12:37] into the system of idolatry Lock Stock
[12:39] and Barrel and the the they had been
[12:43] warned against this you think you can do
[12:45] whatever you want and enjoy God's
[12:47] blessing at the same time it's not that
[12:49] way
[12:50] and in the Book of Revelation the
[12:51] warning was if a tribe does this they
[12:54] will have their name blaunted out and
[12:58] you see in first in the middle page of
[13:00] the notes you see that the reference
[13:02] from First Kings 12 about how the one
[13:04] altar set up in Bethel the other one set
[13:06] up in Dan but if we can turn it over to
[13:08] Revelation chapter 7
[13:10] we can see
[13:13] this is the uh
[13:16] this is the ceiling of the 144 000 and
[13:20] we can see which names are sealed and
[13:24] there'll be two names that are missing
[13:25] because we don't we don't mess around
[13:28] with with God's warnings
[13:31] we can have a mom or dad sometimes we're
[13:33] gonna teach in the classrooms if you do
[13:34] this this will be happening and all of a
[13:36] sudden you get merciful you don't do
[13:38] anything if God has a line and we cross
[13:41] the line he's gonna he's gonna follow up
[13:43] on on his warning and Ephraim and Dan
[13:46] crossed that line
[13:48] so in Revelation chapter 7 this is the
[13:51] ceiling of the hundred forty four
[13:53] thousand Jews
[13:54] verse verse 4 it says I heard the number
[13:57] of them which were sealed and there were
[13:59] sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the
[14:02] children of Israel it says all the
[14:04] tribes of the children of Israel but
[14:05] we're going to name them verse 5 of the
[14:08] tribe of Judah
[14:10] of the tribe of Reuben of the tribe of
[14:12] GAD each one were stealed twelve
[14:14] thousand for six of the tribe of Asher
[14:16] and naftali and Manassas were sealed
[14:19] twelve thousand
[14:21] of the tribe of Simeon Levi and izakar
[14:24] were sealed twelve thousand verse 8 of
[14:27] the tribe of zebulun and Joseph and
[14:30] Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand
[14:33] nowhere do we see in Revelation chapter
[14:35] 7 of the tribe of Dan and of the tribe
[14:38] of Ephraim were sealed twelve thousand
[14:40] because God had said if you do this I'm
[14:43] warning you don't play around with
[14:45] idolatry because if you do that I will
[14:48] lot your name out from under Heaven out
[14:50] of the book of life so we see this
[14:52] connection very clear here between
[14:53] idolatry and having a name blotted
[14:57] from The Book of Life
[15:00] another example that we see is in the
[15:03] book of Exodus chapter 32 this past we
[15:05] can turn there
[15:07] and here you see Israel is hardly on
[15:10] their way out of Egypt they hardly get
[15:14] through the uh through the Red Sea and
[15:17] through the Wilderness and then they
[15:18] come up
[15:19] in Exodus chapter 32. are you running it
[15:22] up there
[15:24] okay very good thank you I do get
[15:26] control that's important
[15:29] and Exodus chapter 32 Moses has been up
[15:32] on the mountain and he comes back down
[15:34] and he sees uh just the chaos it is
[15:37] ensuing down below and Moses he tries to
[15:42] intercede for to God for the people and
[15:44] Moses says to the Lord oh this people
[15:46] have sinned a great sin they've made
[15:49] them gods of gold and yet Lord if you'll
[15:52] forgive their sin and if not block me I
[15:55] pray the out of thy book which thou West
[15:57] written this is Moses just entering into
[16:01] the spirit of Moses wants to give mercy
[16:04] so much he wants to offer himself up in
[16:06] place of the people but God says Moses
[16:09] whoever had sinned against me him will
[16:12] eye blood out of my book
[16:14] God's one who does the blooding out not
[16:16] Moses but God's grace God shows this is
[16:19] serious someone they're committing
[16:21] adultery uh spiritual fornication I will
[16:24] be the one who takes care of blotting
[16:26] them out of my book so again that
[16:29] connection idolatry and the Book of Life
[16:32] just can't
[16:35] um coexist
[16:39] and brother Branham comments on this
[16:41] when Israel rejected the leadership of
[16:43] God in the pillar of fire and turned to
[16:46] worship the golden calves their names
[16:48] were removed from The Book of Life
[16:51] and then he says now if such turning the
[16:54] idols in the Old Testament demanded the
[16:56] penalty of removal of names from The
[16:58] Book of Life
[16:59] then most assuredly it follows that
[17:01] Israel's rejection of Christ is the
[17:04] Messiah would demand a severe penalty
[17:07] and we'll find out that it does because
[17:12] we can see that idolatry in The Book of
[17:15] Life don't go together and rejecting
[17:18] Christ and the Book of Life don't go
[17:20] together because the Book of Life is
[17:21] Christ's book and the first example that
[17:24] we see of that is um is a is is Judas
[17:29] um and the disciples in Acts chapter 1
[17:34] after uh after they go up to the up into
[17:37] the upper room they're waiting for the
[17:39] promise of uh of the father to come upon
[17:41] them and as they're as they're waiting
[17:43] with teaching about this my Bible class
[17:45] today they've had a lot to process in
[17:48] the previous weeks their world has been
[17:50] turned upside down and then back right
[17:52] side up again as they see as Christ
[17:54] appears to them and then they're just
[17:57] waiting and praying for the for the Holy
[17:59] Spirit to come upon them they don't know
[18:01] exactly what to expect but they're told
[18:03] you can be expecting something you shall
[18:05] receive power just go and wait
[18:08] and as they're waiting
[18:11] um they just have to let God interpret
[18:13] his word by bringing it to pass they
[18:15] don't know what to expect they're just
[18:16] they're waiting and they've been praying
[18:19] and they're waiting and praying and as
[18:21] they're waiting the Lord starts
[18:23] quickening scriptures to them to explain
[18:26] why did you just do what he did why did
[18:28] this happen why did that happen pieces
[18:30] start to come together and they say
[18:33] Judas was somebody they all trusted
[18:36] there's not many people I'd be giving
[18:38] all of my bank account to but that's
[18:40] what they did they gave Judas all of
[18:41] that and let him take care of it and um
[18:44] now that trust was broken and Peter
[18:46] stands up as they're waiting and he he
[18:48] says this it's written in the Book of
[18:50] Psalms let this habitation be desolate
[18:53] and let no man dwell there and his
[18:54] Bishop another take and Peter's saying
[18:57] this is talking about Judas
[18:59] and when you look at a scripture like
[19:01] they think it's in Psalm 69 it's amazing
[19:04] how prophecy can work because if you
[19:06] look at the context of Psalm 69 I mean
[19:09] there's a it's definitely a Messianic
[19:10] Psalm there's a few things that Jesus
[19:13] Christ quotes them about
[19:15] um I I first they give them vinegar to
[19:17] drink that that verse is in Psalm 69 but
[19:20] you wouldn't see anything to think of
[19:21] this would be talking about Judas
[19:23] but the Holy Spirit connects it yes
[19:25] that's talking about him so when the
[19:27] Holy Spirit wants to make a connection
[19:29] he makes the connection
[19:31] we can only we can study as hard as we
[19:33] want we can try to make them but we
[19:34] can't do it we can force connections but
[19:37] the holy spirit makes real connections
[19:40] and I think it's interesting they've
[19:41] been praying things are starting to come
[19:43] together and they're understanding and
[19:44] Peter sees this look it let this
[19:47] habitation be desolate let no man take
[19:49] it let no man dwell during his bishopric
[19:51] let another take and now the disciples
[19:54] think ah
[19:56] there's no more 12th disciple there's
[19:57] just 11 his his habitations desolate
[20:01] says let someone else take his place and
[20:03] they think we have to pick somebody
[20:05] and here they think fulfillment of
[20:08] Prophecy is never our problem
[20:11] God's going to take care of it they see
[20:13] something here but it's not our problem
[20:15] just like waiting on the waiting on the
[20:18] promise to come they didn't know what
[20:19] was going to happen the winner is going
[20:20] to happen they just do God said it was
[20:22] going to happen the how and that's not
[20:24] our problem we're just going to wait
[20:25] like he told us he's going to fulfill it
[20:27] well they end up casting lots in the lot
[20:29] falls on falls on Matthias and they make
[20:32] Matthias the 12th Apostle but you never
[20:34] hear anything more about him they did it
[20:36] with the best of intentions they'd been
[20:38] praying they'd been seeing Pieces come
[20:40] together and then they decided to
[20:42] interpret God's word themselves that
[20:44] they had they had they had half of it
[20:46] right but then they wanted to fill the
[20:48] second half themselves let Gods fulfill
[20:50] his word by bringing it to pass
[20:53] and God did that by picking somebody
[20:56] that nobody would have picked
[20:59] The Saul was on nobody's top 10 list to
[21:02] be the vice presidential candidate he
[21:04] would nobody was going to pick him but
[21:06] look at Saul says man if there was hope
[21:07] for Saul what great there could be hope
[21:10] for anybody you could say God shows that
[21:12] nothing's impossible with him but you
[21:14] see in verse 25
[21:16] they make Matthias and then that he may
[21:18] take part of this ministry and
[21:20] apostleship from which Judas by
[21:23] transgressions fell that he might go to
[21:26] his own place
[21:28] he's not his and his name is in blotted
[21:32] from The Book of Life
[21:34] brother bam says there are people who
[21:36] seem 100 involved in things of God or
[21:39] almost 100 they're like Judas
[21:42] the disciples didn't expect that at all
[21:45] when Jesus says at the Last Supper one
[21:49] of you here who takes us up with me will
[21:50] will betray me and they all looked at
[21:52] each other wondering if it were
[21:54] themselves
[21:55] they were doubting themselves they
[21:58] didn't suspect Judas
[22:00] no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind
[22:02] of a person Judas was
[22:04] so the day came that Judas did exactly
[22:07] what Israel did at belper he decided he
[22:10] wanted to join with the false find
[22:12] forces he had to do the financial
[22:13] political organization of anti-word
[22:16] antichrist religion and he did so so
[22:19] when Judas left and betrayed the Lord
[22:21] his name was removed from The Book of
[22:26] Life
[22:27] because rejecting Christ and the Book of
[22:31] Life don't go together
[22:33] because when it's like when you reject
[22:34] Christ you're rejecting the story he has
[22:37] you want to write your own story you
[22:38] want to write your own book for your
[22:40] life and
[22:42] where we we are free moral agents we're
[22:44] Made In His Image we have free moral
[22:46] agency we he lets us make that choice
[22:48] and he's just enough to let us live with
[22:51] that choice
[22:55] look in psalm 69.
[22:58] and we'll we'll kind of zoom in on it
[23:00] because it's not just Judas who is
[23:04] referred to here
[23:06] in Psalm 69 like I said David makes
[23:09] multiple statements that that Jesus
[23:12] either later quotes or that the the
[23:14] gospel writers quote
[23:17] to Psalm 69 and verse 9 for example
[23:22] David says for the Zeal of thine house
[23:24] hath eaten me up and John quotes this
[23:27] scripture after Jesus goes in and
[23:29] cleanses the Temple of those who are
[23:31] buying and selling
[23:33] and then in verse 21 they gave me also
[23:35] Gall for my meat in my thirst they gave
[23:38] me vinegar to drink
[23:40] and then verse 22 I think is is uh is
[23:45] significant it says let their table
[23:47] become a snare before them
[23:51] and that what should have been through
[23:53] their welfare let it become a trap
[23:57] and when I read this I imagine in every
[24:00] place where there would be a synagogue
[24:02] there's a table where the Torah is
[24:04] spread before it the Torah was for their
[24:08] welfare
[24:09] it was given to them for to uh to grow
[24:13] by to be a benefit to them
[24:15] however as they take their
[24:18] interpretation of that that which had
[24:21] been given to them for a good thing
[24:23] actually becomes a snare to them because
[24:26] they say Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth
[24:29] there's no way that he can be the Christ
[24:31] and they'll give you a dozen places in
[24:33] the scripture this that show that that
[24:35] that's impossible let there and so their
[24:37] their table with God's word upon it
[24:40] because they've been misapplying it all
[24:42] these different places it becomes a
[24:44] snare to them they are ensnared by their
[24:46] interpretations by their uh by their
[24:49] perceptions of how the prophecies have
[24:51] to be fulfilled instead of this becoming
[24:53] a light to them it becomes a snare to
[24:55] them
[24:56] so if Judas is had this name blotted
[24:59] from The Book of Life because he's
[25:01] turned his back on Christ think about
[25:03] the things that Jesus says about the
[25:05] religious leaders he says you Whited
[25:07] walls you um you uh you you Snakes in
[25:10] the Grass um but you you Generation of
[25:13] Vipers these are pretty strong words and
[25:18] it's saying the table with with God's
[25:21] word on it
[25:22] it has become a snare to you it's become
[25:24] a trap then you go on in verse 28
[25:27] further down
[25:28] actually we'll just go to 26th they
[25:30] persecute them whom whom you have
[25:31] smitten they talk to the grief of Those
[25:33] whom you have wounded add iniquity to
[25:36] their iniquity let them not come unto
[25:37] your righteousness verse 28 let them be
[25:40] blotted out of the book of the living
[25:42] and not be written with the righteous
[25:46] because rejection of Christ and the Book
[25:49] of Life don't go together
[25:53] and Christ said some pretty strong words
[25:57] about the religious leaders like we just
[25:58] quoted and this scripture seems to be a
[26:02] pretty
[26:03] blanket condemnation of the Orthodox
[26:06] Jewish leaders who were party to Jesus's
[26:09] death
[26:11] and
[26:12] we can see here God's justice but like I
[26:15] said Justice and mercy are not an either
[26:18] or proposition God is both just and
[26:21] merciful
[26:22] because if we were to focus just on
[26:24] these couple verses just on statements
[26:27] that Jesus made why did walls sepulchers
[26:30] Generation of Vipers you wouldn't expect
[26:32] a single of the Jewish religious leaders
[26:35] and single Jewish priests to become a
[26:37] follower of Jesus not not in your
[26:40] wildest dreams however in the book of
[26:43] Acts
[26:44] the word of God increases after the day
[26:46] of Pentecost and it says a great company
[26:49] of the priests were obedient to the
[26:51] faith
[26:53] who would have
[26:55] ex focus on these scriptures from Psalm
[26:57] 69 that they're all these Christ
[26:59] rejecters let their name be brought out
[27:01] of the book of the Living God is just
[27:03] but there's Mercy there too because God
[27:06] can see there's more in that cyst of the
[27:08] meech's eye it looks like a completely
[27:10] dastardly black system Christ Killers
[27:13] everything like that but God sees not
[27:15] everybody that was in there knew what
[27:17] was going on there was a party to it and
[27:19] he's
[27:20] it was hard for the I bet it was hard
[27:21] for those disciples and those early
[27:22] Christians to accept even Saul
[27:25] think about Saul
[27:27] had Saul ever heard the gospel
[27:30] I bet Saul was there in the hall when
[27:32] when the when Stephen goes to preaching
[27:35] he heard that I bet he heard that he he
[27:38] hears Stephen saying I see I see Christ
[27:41] and they're they're at God's right hand
[27:43] Saul sees that and I bet that there were
[27:46] some people who were who were Believers
[27:49] in Christ and you could take the quote
[27:50] to say if you've rejected the message
[27:52] that you've heard the message you've
[27:54] rejected that there's no more grace for
[27:55] you and they would have crossed saw out
[27:58] of their book
[27:59] thinking we're just but God's justice
[28:01] and mercy they go together because Saul
[28:04] was in the book
[28:06] he would he was a party to to Stevens to
[28:09] Stephen's death but he did it without
[28:10] realizing any of it and his name wasn't
[28:13] plotted out
[28:14] God can go into the worst system he says
[28:17] there are still some of mine that are
[28:18] there we're gonna go pluck them out and
[28:21] he has something much more and much more
[28:24] greatly in mind than we ever have and to
[28:27] me this is just a testimony of the truth
[28:28] where the Branham says it's always in an
[28:31] individual only an individual never a
[28:34] group you can't save by a group
[28:36] Association you can't condemn by group
[28:38] Association because there's a God looks
[28:41] at the individuals in both circumstances
[28:44] it's an individual not in the group his
[28:46] identification is with an individual you
[28:49] get that now with the Methodist with the
[28:51] Baptist with the Presbyterian the
[28:54] Lutheran the Pentecostals the message
[28:56] it's as an individual it's not as a
[28:59] group of personal Vindication of a
[29:01] pregnant child of God filled with the
[29:04] Holy Ghost so surrendered to God he
[29:06] doesn't care about anything else and the
[29:09] Holy Spirit is living its life we don't
[29:12] live the holy spirit's life we don't
[29:14] live Christian Life on her own we just
[29:16] get frustrated doing that but Christ
[29:18] comes in to live his own life through US
[29:21] pulsating through US showing the
[29:23] personal Vindication of the word itself
[29:24] expressing itself to the people and to
[29:28] the world
[29:29] so if you take a few of these quotes you
[29:31] say man there's no way to any of these
[29:33] priests could ever commend to the
[29:36] kingdom of God
[29:38] but God is just and merciful they are
[29:42] not mutually exclusive
[29:47] I just think that's a special thing
[29:50] so that's just a challenge for all of us
[29:52] even as Believers in an end-time message
[29:55] we rejoice when any individual leaves
[29:58] the group walk
[29:59] and introduce into a personal individual
[30:02] walk because that's what it's always
[30:03] about we're not condemned by association
[30:05] you're saved by association it's an
[30:08] individual affair
[30:11] so rejecting Christ and the Book of Life
[30:14] don't go together and this principle
[30:16] continues on further into the book of
[30:19] Acts so here you have Paul and Barnabas
[30:21] there the the pattern they have when
[30:24] they first start their Ministry is they
[30:26] go into synagogue after synagogue and
[30:28] trying to to make the first connection
[30:30] with with with with with the Jews and
[30:34] the Jews don't appreciate it by and
[30:35] large
[30:36] and um
[30:37] when the Jews saw these multitudes who
[30:40] were actually listening to Paul and
[30:41] Barnes they were filled with envy and
[30:42] spake against those things which were
[30:44] spoken by Paul contradicting and
[30:46] blaspheming and then the spirit must
[30:49] have descended upon Paul and Barnabas
[30:50] they waxed bold and said it was
[30:52] necessary that the word of God should
[30:54] have first been spoken of you because
[30:55] you were the people of God it was
[30:57] necessary for me first to come to you
[30:59] but seeing that you put it from you God
[31:02] is offering to it to you again and again
[31:04] and again but you are pushing it from
[31:06] yourselves you are judging yourselves
[31:09] Unworthy of everlasting life
[31:11] so we're turning to the Gentiles again
[31:14] rejecting Christ in The Book of Life
[31:17] don't go together it's impossible
[31:21] and then on the notes on page four Paul
[31:24] talks about how Demas hath forsaken me
[31:27] having loved this present world it's in
[31:29] second Timothy 4 verse 10. and brother
[31:31] Branham tells a story how uh um he's
[31:34] talking with Dr Baxter
[31:37] and Dr Baxter there there's talking
[31:40] about Demons Imagine why would the why
[31:43] would Demus leave Paul and Dr Baxter
[31:46] says you know when I get up to heaven
[31:48] the first thing I'm going to do I'm
[31:50] going to walk right up to Demas and slap
[31:52] him in the face as hard as I can
[31:54] and brother Branham says well
[31:56] you really think he'll be there Ern be
[31:59] careful of your desire to slap in the
[32:00] face because I wouldn't want to be where
[32:02] he was at
[32:04] because when Demas walks away from Paul
[32:08] he's loving this present world
[32:11] that's he's putting something else
[32:13] before God an idolatry in The Book of
[32:15] Life don't go together rejecting Christ
[32:17] in The Book of Life don't go together
[32:19] rejecting the gospel and the Book of
[32:21] Life don't go together you can't have
[32:24] them both
[32:29] so as we kind of summarize this section
[32:31] brother Graham looks at Psalm 69 and he
[32:34] says it's the wicked or unrighteous
[32:37] rejecters of Christ and the Destroyers
[32:40] of his people who are removed
[32:44] we're going to bring this up
[32:46] um the best we can into our time because
[32:50] idolatry isn't just something of the Old
[32:52] Testament rejecting Christ isn't just
[32:55] something of 2000 years ago the Book of
[32:57] Revelation talks about at the end time
[32:59] there's going to be an antichrist Spirit
[33:01] rise up a beast rise up and even an
[33:05] image to the Beast and people will be
[33:07] worshiping the Beast image and that's
[33:09] also a form of idolatry and worshiping
[33:11] the Beast image
[33:13] and the Book of Life they don't go
[33:16] together
[33:17] so I want to take a look at um what is
[33:20] the the Beast and the and and also into
[33:23] the Beast image and brother Brandon will
[33:25] look at a couple things people are going
[33:27] to be worshiping the Beast thinking
[33:29] they've been so deceived in their
[33:31] thinking thinking they're actually
[33:32] worshiping God
[33:37] though whose names did not remain in the
[33:40] Book of Life those of the world system
[33:42] churches who fought the bride will be
[33:45] those whose names are removed
[33:48] so the Beast and the Book of Life don't
[33:51] go together Revelation 13 prophesies all
[33:55] that dwell upon the Earth are going to
[33:57] worship Him
[33:58] whose names are not written in the Book
[34:01] of Life of the Lamb
[34:03] slanting the foundation of the world but
[34:05] everybody in the world will be
[34:06] worshiping this Beast
[34:08] except those whose names written in the
[34:10] book of life because the Beast and the
[34:12] Book of Life don't go together
[34:15] and there's also an image of the Beast
[34:17] we'll read about that shortly in
[34:19] Revelation 13. and again this image to
[34:21] the Beast is it's just another form but
[34:24] it's the same Spirit anointing it and if
[34:26] you worship the image of the Beast you
[34:28] say I'm not worshiping the beast but if
[34:30] you're worshiping the image of the Beast
[34:31] it's the same thing it might look a
[34:32] little better look a little more
[34:34] innocent it's the same thing because
[34:35] you're worshiping The Same Spirit that's
[34:38] behind them both
[34:40] and this is a this is a quote the first
[34:43] time I I read it it just kind of blows
[34:47] us away that's how it worked on how the
[34:49] impact they had on me
[34:51] as Israel the chosen people of God in
[34:54] majority they forfeited their rights to
[34:57] the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus
[35:00] then he says so the majority of the
[35:03] Gentile church will also come into
[35:05] condemnation
[35:07] with the result and removal of their
[35:09] name for the Book of Life by rejecting
[35:12] the word and entering into the world
[35:13] ecumenical movement which is the image
[35:16] erected unto the Beast
[35:18] and I I saw this this is a huge
[35:21] statement the majority of the Gentile
[35:25] Church would come in the condemnation
[35:28] it was it's hard to get it's hard to
[35:30] wrap the mind around
[35:32] and the one quotation that helps me with
[35:35] this I've shared this with you before
[35:37] William Booth beginning of the 20th
[35:39] century he says the chief danger that
[35:40] confronts the coming century is a
[35:43] Christianity as religion without the
[35:46] Holy Ghost
[35:47] you know what if you have if you have a
[35:49] religion but you don't have the Holy
[35:50] Ghost you can have the best name on your
[35:52] church
[35:53] but your name can't be in the Book of
[35:56] Life
[35:57] I mean you can have Christian you can
[35:59] you can take the name of Christianity
[36:01] and have a cap and have have that and
[36:03] have have a cross and have a nice
[36:04] inspirational message but if Christ
[36:06] isn't at the heart of that message you
[36:08] might leave feeling good about yourself
[36:10] but Christ isn't here to make us feel
[36:13] good about ourselves sometimes he's here
[36:14] to make us feel bad about ourselves so
[36:16] we see how much we need him
[36:18] but that's not that's not popular that's
[36:20] the chief danger that will have
[36:22] Christianity without Christ we want
[36:24] forgiveness we all want to be forgiven
[36:26] but how many people want to say I'm
[36:28] sorry
[36:29] this is the religion of the world today
[36:31] salvation without regeneration we all
[36:34] want to say we're saved I saw a clip
[36:36] recently about the uh this Omega Church
[36:38] in California who wants to be Seeker
[36:40] friendly
[36:41] and they and and the pastor and his wife
[36:44] come out at the worship service service
[36:46] dressed as Toy Story figures
[36:50] and they're just making jokes at the
[36:51] beginning and and they have banter back
[36:54] and forth and they're making and trying
[36:55] to have laugh and and and and the
[36:57] backdrop of all the Toy Story and think
[36:59] this is this is a huge mega church and
[37:02] they can have the best name at the front
[37:03] but you're you're you're you're
[37:06] trivializing the gospel how could how
[37:08] could you even call this
[37:10] the gospel you're not saving anybody
[37:13] you're making people feel better about
[37:14] the position that they're in without
[37:16] actually giving them anything to to
[37:17] correct it and that's how salvation
[37:21] quote unquote without regeneration
[37:23] that's not salvation that's just giving
[37:26] you morphine to make you feel better and
[37:29] die that's all that is
[37:31] politics without God heaven without hell
[37:34] and this William Booth was completely
[37:37] accurate he saw it and that's what you
[37:40] see all throughout the
[37:42] Church world today so you can see
[37:44] brother Brandon made a comment in 1960
[37:48] whatever the year was that would have
[37:50] caused people's mind to spin how can he
[37:52] say the majority of the Gentile church
[37:54] will have their names removed from The
[37:56] Book of Life what who are you to say
[37:58] that but when you see the situation that
[38:01] the church is in you can hardly
[38:05] hardly called call it a church and it's
[38:07] not being arrogant but it's just like
[38:09] Lord help us because you see this and
[38:12] you and you see Lord this is terrible
[38:14] people are coming to a church like that
[38:16] with needs for some kind of hope and
[38:19] they're settling for
[38:20] Toy Story
[38:22] I mean that how how cheap it is and they
[38:25] try to make connections between chory's
[38:27] story and the gospel you can probably
[38:28] make some really stretched connections
[38:30] but so can my junior high students make
[38:32] stretch connections and essays it
[38:34] doesn't work
[38:36] this is a it's a sad situation if we can
[38:39] we can
[38:41] diagnose it but I I don't intend to say
[38:44] anything in arrogance about it
[38:47] but uh
[38:48] so the majority of the Gentile Church
[38:51] being condemned because it's a church
[38:53] that doesn't have Christ in it a church
[38:55] that hasn't been regenerated or actually
[38:58] saved
[39:00] and I I shared this before but in in
[39:03] 2010 an Evangelical Pastor David Platt
[39:07] publishes this book uh radical taking
[39:09] back your faith from the American dream
[39:11] and he says um he says he critiques the
[39:15] church recruitment like a corporation
[39:16] offering all kinds of benefits like
[39:18] social centers daycare Etc to increase
[39:21] their market share and he says
[39:24] Christians are just pursuing a
[39:26] spiritualized version of worldly goals
[39:28] and his solution is to surrender our
[39:30] material dreams and spend less give more
[39:34] do Mission projects in a third world
[39:36] country which are all great goals
[39:38] but that doesn't necessarily get to the
[39:40] heart of the issue
[39:41] which is a a change in the heart
[39:44] and he says we're starting to redefine
[39:47] Christianity we're giving into the
[39:49] dangerous temptation to take the Jesus
[39:51] of the Bible and twist him into a
[39:53] version of Jesus that we're more
[39:55] comfortable with
[39:57] a nice middle class American Jesus a
[40:00] Jesus who doesn't mind materialism and
[40:02] who would never call us to give away
[40:04] everything we have
[40:06] a Jesus who doesn't expect us to forsake
[40:08] our closest relationships so that he
[40:10] receives all our affection to Jesus who
[40:13] is fine with nominal devotion that does
[40:15] not infringe in our comfort because
[40:17] after all he loves us just the way we
[40:20] are
[40:21] but he loves us enough but let us stay
[40:24] the way we are
[40:27] a Jesus who wants us to be balanced
[40:28] avoid dangerous extremes and avoid
[40:31] danger altogether a Jesus who brings us
[40:33] comfort and prosperity as we leave out
[40:35] our live out our Christian spin on the
[40:37] American dream
[40:38] but do you and I realize what we're
[40:40] doing at this point we're molding Jesus
[40:43] into our own image
[40:46] and when I read this I think back to
[40:49] Exodus 20 and the Ten Commandments Thou
[40:51] shalt not make unto thee any grave and
[40:54] image and we're not putting any image of
[40:56] bronze here but we're making an image in
[40:59] our minds of who we want Jesus to be and
[41:01] that's the Jesus we're going to serve
[41:03] and that's a Jesus of our imagination
[41:06] when we're doing that we are
[41:08] constructing an idol and we saw from the
[41:11] very beginning idolatry and the Book of
[41:13] Life they don't go together we're
[41:17] rejecting to Jesus of the Bible and
[41:19] making another G another image and
[41:22] putting Jesus's name on it but it's not
[41:25] the same he's beginning to look a lot
[41:27] like us because the bat is who we're
[41:29] most comfortable with and he says the
[41:31] danger now is that when We Gather in our
[41:33] church building to sing and lift our
[41:34] hands in worship
[41:36] we may not actually be worshiping the
[41:38] Jesus of the Bible
[41:40] instead we may be worshiping ourselves
[41:44] he says a lot of really strong good
[41:47] things here
[41:48] one thing I might want to add we really
[41:51] don't have a choice of worshiping
[41:53] ourselves
[41:54] it's either God or Satan we can't really
[41:58] worship ourselves so when we think we're
[42:00] worshiping when he said we're worshiping
[42:02] ourselves no we're not if we're not
[42:03] worshiping God we're worshiping the
[42:05] devil and we're thinking we're and we're
[42:08] trying to deceive ourselves and thinking
[42:10] this is this is right
[42:12] and
[42:13] if you have a whole group of people who
[42:16] are in churches with Christ's name on
[42:20] them but they're living a completely
[42:22] different gospel living a completely
[42:24] according to a different world and they
[42:26] might be singing some of the same songs
[42:27] raising their hands but if they're not
[42:30] worshiping the same Christ
[42:33] they're worshiping an idol
[42:35] idolatry and the Book of Life don't go
[42:38] together and that's that that's just the
[42:42] that's just the the truth of the
[42:43] situation
[42:45] because revelation 22 19 says if any man
[42:49] take away from the words of the book of
[42:51] this prophecy God will take away his
[42:53] part out of the book of life because as
[42:55] we mess with the book we're changing who
[42:59] we're talking about it's complete
[43:01] becomes a completely different Christ
[43:03] and the penalty of this as we as we take
[43:06] make take reject Christ and take a
[43:09] different image even if it looks a lot
[43:11] like Christ it's still a different image
[43:13] and that is still idolatry and
[43:17] idolatry and the Book of Life don't go
[43:21] together
[43:23] now David Platt uh I think he's a
[43:26] Baptist pastor he says some good strong
[43:28] things here brother Brandon said pretty
[43:31] much the same thing in 1965 says the God
[43:35] of this world today the worshiped person
[43:37] of this world today is Satan and people
[43:39] are ignorant of worshiping because it's
[43:41] a say of worship being Satan because
[43:42] it's Satan impersonating himself as the
[43:45] church they worship Satan thinking that
[43:47] they're worshiping God to the church
[43:49] but it's the way that Satan has done it
[43:52] he's saying the same thing
[43:54] 40 50 years before David Platt writes
[43:57] the book and it would have been a lot
[43:59] harder for brother Branham to have seen
[44:01] it that he there's not very many people
[44:03] in 1965 who are saying that but he saw
[44:05] the Spirit
[44:07] and there and and he diagnosed it right
[44:11] on he's not saying you're worshiping
[44:12] yourselves you're worshiping
[44:14] Satan
[44:16] now when in the in the Book of
[44:18] Revelation actually I want to go back on
[44:21] further here we go
[44:23] and how can Satan be receiving Worship
[44:26] in in the church because second
[44:28] Thessalonians 3 4 says that he asked God
[44:31] sits in the temple of God showing
[44:34] himself that he is God he's the man of
[44:37] sin the Son of Perdition he's opposing
[44:39] and exalting himself of all that's
[44:41] called God or that's worshiped and he is
[44:43] sitting the temple of God so that he can
[44:45] receive that worship as the Antichrist
[44:48] and here you see the Antichrist being
[44:50] described in Revelation chapter 13 we
[44:52] went I think through this a little bit
[44:54] we've talked about that woman Jezebel
[44:56] this is there's this Beast coming out of
[44:58] the water with the mouth of a lion the
[45:00] feet of a bear
[45:02] um beast like a leopard and this woman
[45:05] Jezebel sitting astride the Beast and
[45:08] and that this is this anointing and and
[45:10] everybody's wondering at the Beast even
[45:12] even John is amazed of the Beast and the
[45:16] dragon is giving the Beast his power and
[45:19] it says all the people are worshiping
[45:21] the Dragon
[45:23] they they might be worshiping the beast
[45:25] but it's the dragon anointing him and
[45:27] the dragon is the one receiving that
[45:30] worship perhaps we can turn over in our
[45:32] Bibles to Revelation chapter 13.
[45:40] so we can see this describes some bet a
[45:42] little better
[45:48] at the beginning of Revelation 13 we see
[45:50] this this Beast come up out of the water
[45:52] that's the Antichrist system that's uh
[45:55] Rome
[45:56] um and it looks bad ferocious terrible
[45:59] all those uh all those bad things it
[46:02] looks really really bad
[46:04] but in verse 11
[46:07] John says
[46:09] I beheld another Beast
[46:13] coming up out of the earth and he had
[46:17] two horns like a lamb
[46:20] yet he's fake as a dragon and it says he
[46:24] exercises all the power of the first
[46:26] Beast before him and it causes the Earth
[46:28] and then what's through all the rain to
[46:30] worship the first Beast whose deadly
[46:32] wound was healed and brother Branham
[46:34] talks about uh the the the the the
[46:37] second this this the innocent looking
[46:39] Beast rising up out of the Earth the
[46:42] first Beast comes up out of the Sea and
[46:44] the Sea of multitudes of people
[46:46] the Earth looking more like an
[46:48] unpopulated area and these talks this is
[46:50] about uh this is speaking of the of the
[46:52] United States and this Beast it looks
[46:54] like a lamb John doesn't know exactly
[46:56] what it is but he says it was a it was a
[46:59] baby buffalo and John had never seen if
[47:01] you pull up pictures of a baby buffalo
[47:03] yeah you could it could be mistaken for
[47:06] a lamb if you'd never seen one before it
[47:09] looks innocent and yet this this Beast
[47:12] that rises up out of the Earth
[47:15] it has for a while it seems like its own
[47:17] identity but what it does it causes
[47:19] everybody in the earth to point their
[47:21] worship back to the first Beast it
[47:24] causes everyone who dwells on the earth
[47:26] to worship the first Beast whose deadly
[47:28] wound was healed and that's a reference
[47:30] to to Rome
[47:32] he does great wonders he makes Fire come
[47:35] down from heaven on the earth in the
[47:36] sight of men so this this this innocent
[47:40] looking Beast can do great signs and
[47:43] wonders it deceives verse 14 them that
[47:45] dwell on the Earth by means of the
[47:46] Miracles that he had to do in the sight
[47:48] of the Beast saying to them that dwell
[47:51] on the earth that they should make an
[47:52] image to the Beast which had the wound
[47:54] by a sword and did live
[47:56] and
[47:59] there so here's this this first Beast
[48:03] that looks terrible ferocious you don't
[48:05] want to mess with this Beast
[48:08] but the second but the the second beast
[48:10] that comes up looks a lot better
[48:14] let's just all love one another
[48:17] yes this is this is who could be who
[48:20] could be against this
[48:23] but it's anointed by the very same
[48:26] dragon
[48:27] one of them is in your face powerful
[48:29] ruling by fear the other one putting at
[48:32] ease call me yeah he listened let's just
[48:35] love one another
[48:37] what's that loving one another means
[48:39] that we have to change the god that
[48:41] we're serving
[48:42] will really have our hearts in the wrong
[48:45] place because God is the one that we owe
[48:48] our love to first and foremost
[48:54] he's like a lamb like this sweet little
[48:56] teddy bear I thought the teddy Bear got
[48:58] the a got the idea across he's like a
[49:00] lamb but he speaks as a dragon
[49:03] it has the same anointing it might not
[49:05] roar like a dragon to breathe fire like
[49:07] a dragon but the message the same is
[49:10] going to get you to the same place
[49:13] and here I send a link
[49:16] um to um
[49:18] uh to the folks upstairs and I mean our
[49:21] our audio video crew
[49:23] um but I just want to introduce it for a
[49:25] minute
[49:27] um the
[49:28] in 2014
[49:31] um
[49:31] a man named Tony Palmer visited Kenneth
[49:35] Copeland's Word of Faith Ministries and
[49:38] he came with a with a special message
[49:40] and Kenneth Copeland knows what the
[49:43] message is he introduces Tony Palmer and
[49:45] you're going to listen to Tony Palmer
[49:47] and he's going to say some things that
[49:49] sound really really good it's like who
[49:52] could who could be against this but he
[49:55] says this mess that we're going to hear
[49:56] this evening we have a special messenger
[49:58] this evening and I'm going to come
[49:59] introduce this messenger and he's
[50:02] speaking as an acumenicist wanting to
[50:05] bring everybody together and it sounds
[50:08] like the teddy bear so let's listen to a
[50:10] few minutes of it
[50:12] [Music]
[50:16] this is the first pope in history that
[50:18] took the francis's name
[50:21] because he's openly charismatic
[50:23] and this is history that we've got a
[50:25] pope who recognizes us as brothers and
[50:29] sisters speaks to us as brothers and
[50:31] sisters and has sent a message to us and
[50:34] you'll see what the message is about
[50:38] and I need you to at least understand a
[50:40] little bit of the the history behind
[50:42] this
[50:42] because we are living in an incredibly
[50:45] important generation amen
[50:48] I believe that God has brought me here
[50:50] to this year's ministers conference in
[50:52] the spirit of Elijah
[50:56] let me explain
[50:58] if you look carefully the spirit of
[51:00] Elijah was on John the Baptist to turn
[51:03] the hearts of the sons to the fathers
[51:09] and to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[51:11] the sons to prepare the way for the Lord
[51:15] and we know that prophecy always has a
[51:18] double fulfillment and we know that
[51:20] Elijah will come before the second
[51:21] coming as well
[51:23] and I've understood that the spirit of
[51:25] Elijah is the spirit of reconciliation
[51:29] to return Hearts to each other
[51:33] this is very important
[51:36] we know that the first thousand years
[51:38] there was one church it was called the
[51:40] Catholic church and the word Catholic
[51:41] means Universal it doesn't mean Roman
[51:44] Catholic means you if you're born again
[51:46] raise your hand if you're born again
[51:48] you're a Catholic
[51:53] take back redeem what belongs to you
[51:56] we are Catholics
[51:58] and then there was the split at the end
[52:00] of the first Millennium we had the
[52:01] Orthodox east and west
[52:03] two churches then 500 years later we
[52:07] have Luther and his protest
[52:09] three churches in 1500 years
[52:12] three denominations not three churches
[52:15] and then from Luther's protest onwards
[52:19] 33 000 new denominations
[52:29] I've come to understand that diversity
[52:31] is divine
[52:32] it's division that's diabolic
[52:39] it's true what you were saying about the
[52:41] glory I agree with you of course it's
[52:42] true
[52:43] the glory that the father had he gave to
[52:46] Jesus the glory was the presence of God
[52:49] what is the charismatic renewal it's
[52:51] when we experience the presence of God
[52:54] and he said and I give them the glory
[52:56] pragmatic reason so that they may be one
[53:02] it's the glory that glues us together
[53:04] not the doctrines
[53:07] sorry if you accept that Christ is
[53:09] living in me and the presence of God is
[53:11] in me and the presence of God is in you
[53:13] that's all we need
[53:15] because God will sort out all our
[53:17] doctrines when we get upstairs
[53:20] therefore Christian Unity it
[53:23] there's a lot that can be said there but
[53:25] what you see there
[53:27] he's anointed
[53:29] he's got it anointing on him and and I
[53:32] think he feels that you can see he makes
[53:33] his pauses looks there and there's and
[53:35] the reception's amazing what you have
[53:38] there
[53:39] that's a big teddy bear
[53:41] he's saying all kinds of really nice
[53:43] things he's he's a lamb who would want
[53:46] to oppose a man we have 33 000
[53:48] dominations that's a good thing nobody's
[53:50] going to say that but man all this
[53:52] division is bad he's saying a lot of
[53:54] good things he's even recognizing some
[53:56] good things he's talking about there's
[53:57] going to be a prophet uh Elijah's going
[54:00] to come with the last days and he's
[54:02] going to say in just a minute I'm coming
[54:03] like Elijah to introduce this important
[54:06] messenger who is this guy
[54:09] it's just so many things that that is
[54:11] mixing truth and error so subtly so
[54:15] subtle he's like a lion sorry like a
[54:18] lamb this is so subtle so suddenly he
[54:21] says you know what
[54:22] God gave us the glory it's the glory
[54:25] that unites us and that and it's not the
[54:28] doctrine what are you saying is it's not
[54:30] the word that unites us it's the it's
[54:32] the glory no it's not it's the word that
[54:35] United it's the exactly the wrong thing
[54:37] that he's saying but it sounds so good
[54:40] it's not the glory that unites us it's
[54:42] God's word that unites us that's the
[54:45] important thing is God's all he has it
[54:47] all backwards
[54:48] and you know that I hadn't seen it quite
[54:50] like this until even as we were reading
[54:52] Revelation 13 a few minutes ago but um
[54:56] the the Pope says that the Catholic and
[54:58] charismatic renewal it's the hope of the
[55:01] church the Catholic Church loved
[55:02] charismatics it's the hope of the church
[55:04] because they've got the signs the
[55:06] Wonders let's make the spirit moving
[55:07] among them it looks like a great thing
[55:09] and you see in Revelation 13 the image
[55:12] of the Beast this ecumenical movement
[55:14] the image of the Beast does great
[55:16] wonders he makes signs come down from
[55:19] everything wow it looks like we've got
[55:21] the glory here this is it the image to
[55:24] the Beast everybody's attracting it
[55:25] coming right to it because it looks like
[55:27] we it looks like we've got the glory
[55:29] there but if you've got Glory without
[55:30] word you got to wonder where the glory
[55:32] is coming from it's not the same thing
[55:34] it'd be false fire verse 14. he deceives
[55:37] in the dwell on the Earth by the means
[55:40] of those Miracles which he had power to
[55:42] do in the sight of the Beast and the
[55:44] charismatic renewal is doing these kinds
[55:46] of miracles in the side of the Beast
[55:48] everybody's like wondering wow this is
[55:50] it let's bring everybody right back like
[55:53] this pied pipe I think wow this we're
[55:55] going right back because we're all
[55:57] Catholics anyway it sounds so good and
[56:02] Pope Francis
[56:04] he says let's give each other a
[56:06] spiritual hug and let God complete the
[56:09] work that he has become
[56:12] I don't know that God started the work
[56:14] that he's talking about
[56:16] but the spiritual hug the is talking
[56:18] about ah that's the teddy bear
[56:21] this is this is the Lamb he's speaking
[56:24] like a lamb but watch the anointing
[56:26] behind him it's right there the
[56:28] anointing is right there Inspire
[56:30] inspiring inspiring and there are so
[56:32] many who you will think would know
[56:34] better
[56:36] uh as as Tony Palmer was uh speaking his
[56:41] wife is Italian
[56:42] and he tells the crowd a little bit
[56:45] later here that when my wife saw that
[56:47] she could be Catholic and charismatic
[56:50] and Evangelical and Pentecostal and who
[56:53] has absolutely accepted the Catholic
[56:55] Church Tim it's a big deal that the pope
[56:57] calls us Brothers he's not
[56:59] excommunicated in us anymore he's
[57:00] calling us brothers let's go back I
[57:03] don't care if the pope calls us Brothers
[57:04] I want God to call me his son that's the
[57:07] important identification it doesn't
[57:09] matter what what some religious
[57:10] Authority says when my wife saw that I
[57:13] could be all these things and absolutely
[57:15] accepted in the Catholic church she said
[57:17] that she would like to reconnect her
[57:19] roots with the Catholic culture that's
[57:21] not a Ministry of Malachi 4. it's not
[57:24] reconciliation of Father and Son it's
[57:26] being reckons under the same faith that
[57:28] they had it's gold going back to the
[57:30] word it's not just a human
[57:32] reconciliation putting differences under
[57:34] the rug and he says may the lutherans
[57:36] and the Catholics signed an agreement
[57:38] about justification as though we believe
[57:40] the same thing but the Reformation was
[57:42] about a lot more than that is about
[57:43] people Authority about what is it was
[57:45] church Council there's the authority
[57:46] it's the word of God they're not
[57:48] touching that it is a lot that you can
[57:50] say it and the crowd cheers you heard
[57:52] them clapping
[57:53] they should know better and Kenneth
[57:55] Copeland he says Heaven is thrilled over
[57:59] this
[58:00] he probably said it more slowly in his
[58:02] text and draw but that's what he said
[58:03] and you know what's so thrilling to me
[58:06] when we went into the ministry 47 years
[58:09] ago this was impossible
[58:13] I don't know that things have improved
[58:15] then
[58:15] but darkness is covering the Earth and
[58:18] woe to them who who love Darkness rather
[58:20] than light and say evil is good and the
[58:22] other way around
[58:24] this is this is a sad sad case
[58:29] and then they even went to the Vatican
[58:31] these uh these Pentecostal charismatic
[58:34] leaders
[58:35] and they're working together to deceive
[58:37] all that was on the earth saying to them
[58:39] to dwell on the earth that they should
[58:40] make an image to the Beast which had the
[58:43] wound by a sword and did live who's the
[58:46] sinner
[58:47] it's not Christ we're going back to Papa
[58:50] we're going back to to Father Rome
[58:54] and
[58:55] it talks about an image to the Beast
[58:57] worshiping an image to the Beast and
[58:58] you've got so much of the Evangelical of
[59:01] the Christian professing world doing
[59:03] that we have to remember idolatry and
[59:07] the Book of Life
[59:08] don't go together
[59:11] when you go after idolatry names are
[59:13] bothered from the book names are blotted
[59:15] out blotted out and that's the same
[59:17] thing that's promised here
[59:22] brother Branham says today the
[59:24] Pentecostals are throwing themselves
[59:26] together in The ecumenical council in
[59:28] the idea what it was like now
[59:31] doing the same thing grafting in
[59:33] tradition of man instead of taking the
[59:35] word of God which is Thoroughly
[59:37] identified by the Holy Ghost
[59:39] and we can say that even still today how
[59:42] tempting it can be to take tradition of
[59:44] men the thoughts that come up first on
[59:46] their Instagram feed the thoughts on my
[59:48] personal Facebook feed the thoughts that
[59:50] we've put in we ask Google how should I
[59:52] do this how should I raise my kids what
[59:53] what what should I watch what should I
[59:55] not watch we might be taking traditions
[59:58] of men instead of the word of God
[59:59] because woke things are going to sound
[1:00:02] good
[1:00:03] the woke the wokeness is going to speak
[1:00:06] like a lamb but it's anointed by that
[1:00:08] Dragon it'll lead you the same place
[1:00:10] take the word of God that which is
[1:00:12] Thoroughly identified by the Holy Ghost
[1:00:14] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:16] forever and he's saying the church today
[1:00:18] stands in the balance and it's found one
[1:00:20] and you're back in pilate's judgment
[1:00:23] Hall yes sir and what shall we do with
[1:00:25] Jesus called Christ
[1:00:27] what does this movement do this
[1:00:29] ecumenical movement it's making an image
[1:00:31] unto the Beast it's a satellite to Rome
[1:00:34] when The ecumenical council is forcing
[1:00:36] and will force every Protestant
[1:00:39] denomination into it and it's
[1:00:40] practically all there is now Full Gospel
[1:00:42] on all and the folks who identified this
[1:00:44] Full Gospel are the ones who were in
[1:00:46] Tony Palmer's audience clapping and
[1:00:48] thinking this is a wonderful thing but
[1:00:50] the hour is going to come we'll have to
[1:00:52] come or stay out and at that time when
[1:00:55] that Force come you've already
[1:00:57] identified yourself with the mark of the
[1:00:59] beast
[1:01:00] then you're
[1:01:01] worshiping that image to the Beast
[1:01:04] and image worshiping images idolatry in
[1:01:07] The Book of Life they don't go together
[1:01:09] it's like oil and water
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:17] but the message to Sardis it brings up a
[1:01:20] uh a rather sobering theme in the the
[1:01:23] prosperity of name is being blotted from
[1:01:25] The Book of Life God's justice is a
[1:01:27] sobering thing
[1:01:29] but it ends with a promise
[1:01:32] and the promise is he that overcometh
[1:01:35] and how can we overcome
[1:01:37] by having an ear that hears what the
[1:01:40] spirit is continuing to speak to the
[1:01:42] church that's the only way to overcome
[1:01:44] and he did overcometh will be close in
[1:01:47] white raiment will be righteous his name
[1:01:50] will not be blotted out his name will be
[1:01:52] confessed before the father and before
[1:01:54] his angels Christ will stand and say I
[1:01:56] identify myself with him they identify
[1:01:58] with me on Earth I identify with them
[1:02:01] now we are one
[1:02:04] that's a wonderful wonderful promise
[1:02:07] so when we when we discuss the subject
[1:02:10] of the book of life it can feel rather
[1:02:12] heavy but you can all it explains
[1:02:16] what we see in the church world today it
[1:02:20] explains it and that does that that that
[1:02:23] does establish and subtle us
[1:02:26] The Book of Life does emphasize God's
[1:02:28] attribute of justice but that justice of
[1:02:31] God does not do away with the mercy of
[1:02:34] God
[1:02:35] and first off we can see
[1:02:38] um that I would think the one when the
[1:02:40] compass Revelation 3 17 anoint your eyes
[1:02:42] with isaf God is merciful the evenness
[1:02:45] deceit is going all over the place we
[1:02:47] can anoint our eyes with isaf so that we
[1:02:49] can see we can be thankful that we don't
[1:02:51] have to be deceived and we can go in and
[1:02:54] and and believe the truth we don't have
[1:02:56] to worship an image of the Beast we
[1:02:58] don't have to worship an image of Christ
[1:02:59] we can worship Christ himself
[1:03:02] but uh
[1:03:04] God's justice does not do away with
[1:03:07] God's mercy
[1:03:08] next time when we talk about the book of
[1:03:10] life I want to focus more we'll see how
[1:03:12] the mercy of God does endure forever
[1:03:17] as we'll see that multitudes who never
[1:03:19] came to the same Revelation as the bride
[1:03:21] might have come to
[1:03:23] God still has Mercy on many and many
[1:03:27] will enter into eternity with God
[1:03:28] there'll be 144 000 Jews who are who
[1:03:32] come unto eternity before God there will
[1:03:35] be a sleeping virgin who was dilatory
[1:03:38] who didn't who didn't have take oil with
[1:03:40] him yet God still has mercy upon them
[1:03:44] just like you would have said man who
[1:03:46] could come out of those uh of the Jewish
[1:03:49] religion and believe with those
[1:03:50] condemnations written over Ichabod and
[1:03:52] everything but there were still priests
[1:03:54] a great multitude of priests were joined
[1:03:56] to the church and there's going to be a
[1:03:58] great multitude of foolish virgins who
[1:04:01] might have been in the system but didn't
[1:04:02] realize what they had signed up for the
[1:04:04] last one said this is not what I want
[1:04:05] I'm willing to give my life for what's
[1:04:07] true and they'll do that the mercy of
[1:04:10] God endures forever he who receives the
[1:04:14] a righteous man the name of a righteous
[1:04:16] man receives a righteous man's reward
[1:04:18] God's mercy endures forever and we see
[1:04:21] God's mercy even in this theme
[1:04:23] of The Book of Life
[1:04:27] amen let's pray
[1:04:29] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:04:31] goodness to us O Lord
