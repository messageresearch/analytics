[0:00] help us Lord to think like you Lord help
[0:02] us to think like you hallelujah praise
[0:05] the lord it's good to be here tonight if
[0:07] you turn in your Bibles with me to
[0:08] Psalms 119 we're going to look at that
[0:11] Psalm tonight I asked you on Sunday to
[0:13] read that it's a long chapter but I just
[0:16] trust you were able to read some of it
[0:18] we're going to pull from it just a
[0:19] little bit tonight for our texts we
[0:21] greet you in the name of the Lord It's a
[0:23] joy to be a Christian tonight to be in
[0:24] the house of the Lord and we're thankful
[0:26] for his grace and mercy to us we want to
[0:29] remember all the prayer requests that's
[0:30] been mentioned and it looked like there
[0:33] was a flyer that came in for a special
[0:35] meeting next week this coming weekend as
[0:37] well in Murfreesboro Tennessee Brother
[0:39] Joseph Hammonds he's having brother
[0:41] Daniel Gibson Danner for Saturday and
[0:43] Sunday and I just got the fire today so
[0:45] it's a bit short notice I'll put it on
[0:46] the back if anybody would be down in
[0:48] that area you're certainly welcome to
[0:50] take that in so I want to announce it
[0:52] for Brother Joseph we appreciate him and
[0:54] their their meetings as well amen you
[0:57] know I was reading in August 9th in the
[0:59] in the a devotional I don't know if he
[1:01] was reading it but it's just really
[1:02] inspiring here the other day and I won't
[1:05] read all of this but I thought this was
[1:07] really good and it's my heart's desire
[1:09] and this is the way we want it I was
[1:11] reading this to my daughter and my wife
[1:13] just an hour or so ago and the prophet
[1:17] said in the devotion I don't know if you
[1:18] read this one on August 9th he said he's
[1:21] he's never trusted me with too much
[1:22] God's never trusted me with too much
[1:24] because I wouldn't know how to take care
[1:25] of much
[1:27] I guess he just gives me what he will
[1:29] but what I have I freely give to glorify
[1:32] him and his church I'm just here to try
[1:35] to represent him to you by a Divine gift
[1:37] just like if he gave me a hand I want to
[1:40] use that hand the best that I can if you
[1:43] give me my eyes I don't want to look at
[1:45] the evil things I want to look at his
[1:47] bible I want to look at things that's
[1:49] right if they happen to run into evil
[1:51] things my eyes I want to turn my head
[1:53] till I look off somewhere else because
[1:55] he gave gave me my eyes
[1:58] then he talks about being healed he was
[2:01] almost blind and he was healed but his
[2:03] last comment here said oh it's amazing
[2:05] grace how good he is I love him though
[2:09] he condemns me at the end I still love
[2:12] him
[2:14] how many how many people
[2:17] I want to be there
[2:19] that if I served him and loved him my
[2:21] whole life and he condemns me to hell at
[2:23] the end I'll still love and serve him
[2:26] see that's when it's not about God
[2:28] paying me something or God God doesn't
[2:31] really owe us anything
[2:33] but when we love him like that we love
[2:35] him anyway that's how deeply I want to
[2:37] love the Lord tonight when I read that I
[2:39] thought Lord that's what I want I want
[2:41] to be able to love you that deeply in my
[2:43] heart let's pull out a few scriptures
[2:44] here tonight Psalms 119 and if you get a
[2:47] chance read the whole chapter it's I
[2:49] think it's the longest one in the Book
[2:51] of Psalms so there's a lot in there but
[2:54] I want to just look at a couple things
[2:56] here in Psalms 119 we'll just do 65 to
[3:00] 72 first thou Hast dwelt well with thy
[3:03] servant O Lord according unto Thy word
[3:05] and I just missed an announcement wait
[3:07] look up here wait stop
[3:09] I got the cart before the horse so we're
[3:12] praying at 7 30 tomorrow morning whether
[3:14] in your homes or here at the church
[3:15] you're welcome to join us we're praying
[3:18] that God will just lead us and guide us
[3:19] God will give us Revival in our hearts
[3:21] we'll be praying for the camp that
[3:23] starts tomorrow night so if you join us
[3:25] at 7 30 in the morning we'd appreciate
[3:27] that for a half hour we'll be praying
[3:28] together or as long as you want to pray
[3:30] that would be great and brother Brandon
[3:33] mentioned to me that at state line Mr
[3:34] Newbold actually ordered when you bring
[3:37] your kids to school is it first day
[3:39] tomorrow Tiffany
[3:43] okay so he's set a prayer time as well
[3:45] about the same time so when the kids
[3:47] come so that's good uh we'll we'll join
[3:50] together with them as well and pray
[3:51] together amen so thou now I can read the
[3:54] scripture everybody look at your Bibles
[3:57] thou Hast dealt well with thy servant O
[4:00] Lord according to Thy word teach me good
[4:03] judgment and knowledge for I have
[4:05] believed thy Commandments before I was
[4:07] afflicted I went astray
[4:10] before I was afflicted I went astray but
[4:12] now have I kept Thy word thou art good
[4:15] and do us good teach me thy statues the
[4:19] proud have forged a lie against me but I
[4:21] will keep thy precepts with my whole
[4:24] heart their heart is as fat as Greece
[4:26] but I Delight in thy law it is good for
[4:30] me that I have been Afflicted that I
[4:33] might learn thy statues look at the good
[4:35] that comes out of being Afflicted going
[4:38] through things that's a pretty strong
[4:40] word being Afflicted he said it's good
[4:43] for me to be afflicted because what I
[4:45] learn out of it is your statues
[4:47] the law of thy mouth is better unto me
[4:49] than a thousands of gold and silver
[4:52] verse 97
[4:54] skip to verse 97.
[4:57] oh how I love thy law it is my
[5:01] meditation all the day
[5:04] oh how I love that's what I'd like to
[5:05] title this tonight loving his law
[5:09] because law and the the talk about the
[5:13] law of God
[5:14] has a bad connotation to it
[5:18] right and Satan's done that has a bad
[5:21] connotation but here's a man of God
[5:23] especially after he had sinned now he's
[5:26] saying Lord I love thy law
[5:30] I love the law of God I love the
[5:32] precepts of God there's not too many
[5:34] people say that but he's come to a place
[5:36] that I want to come to Lord I love thy
[5:38] law
[5:39] you'd have to understand the power
[5:41] behind God's law in order to say that
[5:46] I love thy law you know people saying it
[5:49] you don't hear too many people that are
[5:51] Lawless saying it I love the law they
[5:53] want to get rid of policemen and be a
[5:56] lawless nation and sometimes you're her
[5:58] teen are teenagers you'll never hear
[6:00] them saying I love the rules of this
[6:02] house
[6:04] I love the laws of this home you rarely
[6:07] hear it saying you don't hear people
[6:08] saying concerning the laws of God but
[6:10] David's saying it Lord I love thy law it
[6:13] is my meditation all the Day verse 113
[6:16] if you would
[6:17] 113 I hate vain thoughts but thy law do
[6:22] I love
[6:25] verse 163.
[6:27] verse 163.
[6:31] I hate and abhor lying but thy law do I
[6:35] love in verse 165 great peace have they
[6:39] which love thy law
[6:43] how many want peace tonight
[6:45] great peace have they that love thy law
[6:48] and nothing shall offend them amen Lord
[6:53] Jesus thank you for your word tonight
[6:54] thank you for your precepts thank you
[6:57] that we have this people gathered here
[6:59] and listening online and I pray the
[7:01] anointing of the Holy Spirit would come
[7:03] as we've expressed our hearts to you
[7:05] Lord in the songs of worship lifting our
[7:08] hands lifting our voices Lord just
[7:11] bringing a jubilant Heart Tonight Lord I
[7:13] remember our choir when they sing that
[7:16] song Hallelujah in the valley Lord
[7:18] hallelujah in the in the Saint in the
[7:21] weak times Lord there's something you
[7:23] get Glory when someone just reaches out
[7:25] and Praises God in the weak times and
[7:29] sings Hallelujah you can hear the
[7:30] hallelujahs coming out of the valleys
[7:32] not just the mountains but coming out of
[7:34] the valleys you love to hear your people
[7:37] sing during those hard times and I pray
[7:39] Lord tonight your word would go forth in
[7:42] power and demonstration Lord we pray
[7:44] that it would bring forth the fruit that
[7:47] it was meant to do we're thankful we
[7:48] offer all your blessings from the
[7:50] weekend and just the last few weeks has
[7:52] such a just been an outpouring and we're
[7:53] thankful for it may tonight be no
[7:55] exception and may the camp this week be
[7:57] a wonderful time for the young people
[7:59] Lord to enjoy the presence of the Lord
[8:01] to be able to get something solid in
[8:03] their lives we pray for we pray for the
[8:05] anointing of the ministers and and the
[8:07] camp directors and all of them may you
[8:09] bless it keep everyone protected there
[8:11] Lord I pray and we commit the service
[8:13] here tonight to you now in the name of
[8:16] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated
[8:19] God bless you now this Psalm 119 is set
[8:23] apart in very special uh in in itself
[8:26] because of it keeps having a theme to it
[8:30] and the theme is in all uh 176 verses of
[8:35] it that's the amazing thing if you read
[8:37] it the theme runs through all uh 176
[8:41] verses it's I believe I think it's the
[8:43] longest you'll have to correct me if I'm
[8:45] wrong but I think it's the longest Psalm
[8:47] that's in the Book of Psalms and it's
[8:49] the 119th Psalm but what's interesting
[8:52] is about it it has a theme in every
[8:54] verse and we're going to talk about this
[8:56] really the theme is loving his law
[8:57] loving his precepts David's saying I
[9:00] love your Commandments and so you
[9:03] correct me on this as well if you read
[9:05] it through I could only find two verses
[9:08] that don't mention these things every
[9:12] verse besides two and I mean it now
[9:15] coming correct me if you find me wrong
[9:16] okay that's fine I only found two verses
[9:18] that didn't have these things in every
[9:21] verse his his law his word his precepts
[9:26] his testimonies his Commandments his
[9:29] judgments and his statutes are in every
[9:33] verse but two
[9:34] so I think we know the theme
[9:37] and that is he has come to a place that
[9:41] he loves his law he loves his precepts
[9:43] he loves his Commandments everything
[9:45] that's come from God he's in love with
[9:48] him and he's not running from them he's
[9:50] not questioning them
[9:52] he's come into the world that this is
[9:54] the only world to live in is God's
[9:56] precepts God's quotes God's what do you
[9:59] ever want to whatever you want to call
[10:00] him they're quotes from God and they
[10:03] come through God's prophets there's
[10:05] quotes of Moses that's the quotes of the
[10:07] prophet and so he's living on all the
[10:09] quotes and he's valuing all the quotes
[10:11] he's saying this all has meaning to me
[10:13] and I'm not running from it I'm not
[10:15] resisting it I'm not bucking up against
[10:17] it I may want to understand some of them
[10:20] more but there's one thing for sure I
[10:22] have learned I love your law
[10:26] praise the Lord I love your statues I
[10:29] love your commands and you find those
[10:30] words you find those words in every
[10:32] verse but two I found so all these
[10:34] things are what God spoke to his people
[10:37] through his Prophet all these things are
[10:40] things God spoke to his people through
[10:43] his Prophet back at that time and I
[10:45] don't know if he had uh had this strong
[10:48] love for them before he broke the law
[10:51] himself how many original and say David
[10:52] broke the law himself David brought
[10:55] broke the thing that thou shall not
[10:57] commit adultery and he was with another
[10:59] woman that was not his his wife and not
[11:02] taken as his wife so he broke that so I
[11:04] don't know if David come into this
[11:06] deeper love for the law of God after he
[11:09] made a mistake a lot of times we do if
[11:11] we're really broken and we're real
[11:13] sincere about our sin then we develop a
[11:16] deeper love for what we ignored in other
[11:18] words he had to trample upon a bunch of
[11:21] precepts as a king he had to ignore and
[11:24] say this doesn't apply to me and and
[11:26] it's not important he had to make it
[11:28] less important in order to commit
[11:30] adultery with Bathsheba he had to
[11:33] trample upon or he didn't forget because
[11:36] he knew but he had to say you know what
[11:38] I'm I'm taking a vacation
[11:41] I'm taking a vacation from certain laws
[11:44] of God because I want this woman
[11:47] sometimes after we make a mistake and we
[11:50] defy and go against God's law we pay for
[11:53] it because how many know David paid for
[11:54] it we can pay there's something but
[11:57] there's something good that we get out
[11:59] of it can you say man and that is maybe
[12:01] what David got was such this deep deep
[12:05] love for the law of God I don't want to
[12:08] ever ever resist it again I don't want
[12:11] to trample upon it these things are not
[12:14] just words in a book they're just not
[12:16] words in the tablet but God gave them to
[12:19] me to protect me
[12:22] God gave them to me to keep me guarded
[12:25] from the things that I would get into
[12:27] and now I'm not looking for ways around
[12:29] them I love them
[12:32] somebody say praise the Lord
[12:34] I am through with looking aways around
[12:36] them I'm through with taking 10 years
[12:38] and trying to explain this quote I'm I'm
[12:41] through with it because if I know that
[12:43] it's come from God I'm good with it I
[12:45] love it I trust him because I trust God
[12:49] we're talking about the prophet's word
[12:50] now not just any wisdom that's on out
[12:53] there wisdom of the world we're talking
[12:54] about what we know is Vindicated to come
[12:57] from God how many know this Bible came
[12:59] from God
[13:00] it's the Vindicated word of God and it
[13:03] came from God so we can trust it because
[13:06] it came from God not man's
[13:07] interpretation of it but we can trust it
[13:09] so I don't know if David became this
[13:12] strong in his love for the law uh after
[13:14] his mistake
[13:16] we don't know that
[13:18] I'll I'm gonna ask him someday
[13:21] I really am I'm gonna ask him someday
[13:23] because I can't ask him now but I'm
[13:24] going to ask him did you come into a
[13:26] deeper love after you defied the law of
[13:29] God and now you're coming into Psalms
[13:31] one team David I heard you say every
[13:34] verse you're crying out I love his
[13:36] precepts I love his testimonies I love
[13:38] his Commandments there's not one of them
[13:40] I don't love there's some I may not
[13:43] understand but I love them I want them
[13:45] in my life I want to keep them before me
[13:47] I want to order my life
[13:49] order my steps in your word
[13:55] may we all come may we all lose every
[13:58] bit of of distrust
[14:01] and may we come into this kind of love
[14:03] for his word amen
[14:05] all I know is that he is life was 100
[14:08] trustworthy of what God said there's not
[14:11] an ounce of question or resistance in
[14:14] David he's basically saying I may not
[14:17] have been all in before but I'm all in
[14:19] now I love your precepts I love your law
[14:22] so this this life of David that he come
[14:26] into it would be another extreme of what
[14:28] we see in the world today
[14:31] and even around us sometimes with some
[14:34] in that's going to a message church or
[14:36] going to church as a Christian
[14:39] um this would be the Other Extreme of
[14:41] what we see in the world because the
[14:42] world is mocking the precepts of God the
[14:45] world is saying it's out of date the
[14:47] world is saying it doesn't work world
[14:49] the world says many in the world say
[14:51] there you know there is no God number
[14:53] one but then a lot of them are saying if
[14:55] this is God this has no value anymore
[14:57] that's crazy stuff that's stupid stuff
[14:59] so this is if you have that extreme that
[15:02] you live in in the world that there's no
[15:03] value for the precepts of God in other
[15:05] words God says something and they decide
[15:08] whether it's relevant or not and they
[15:10] dump it out that's the world we live in
[15:12] I think David is the Other Extreme of
[15:15] the world we live in and that is he's
[15:17] not just in between but he's actually
[15:19] saying they're saying I hate God's laws
[15:21] I don't need God's laws I don't need to
[15:24] live my life according to God's word and
[15:26] David's saying I can't live without the
[15:28] laws of God I can't function without out
[15:31] of the precepts of God the littlest
[15:34] little detail on how to live I need it
[15:36] to live by
[15:38] I want to be that way it's the other
[15:40] extreme of what the world is there's a
[15:42] there's extreme there's an extreme now
[15:45] of disrespect for God's word and
[15:47] disrespect for God's prophet
[15:49] can I hear it amen
[15:52] we've reached higher and higher levels
[15:54] of people mocking quotes of the prophet
[15:58] and mocking what the message says and
[16:00] it's his opinion that's increased and
[16:02] the problem is is when it increases it
[16:05] can plant seeds in your mind that make
[16:07] you back off and have your wall up
[16:08] towards it but see that's Satan's work
[16:10] to do that and so people become extreme
[16:13] in their disrespect for God's word I
[16:16] think on Judgment Day there's some
[16:17] people that is even left the message
[16:19] they're in a rough spot on Judgment Day
[16:21] because of the disrespectful Blasphemous
[16:24] things that they're saying I would never
[16:26] put them in hell but I just know some of
[16:28] it's blasphemy and they should be
[16:29] careful what they say respect it
[16:31] disagree with it but respect it be
[16:34] careful what you boast can you say mom
[16:36] be careful what you do with God's
[16:38] prophets whether it's in the Bible or
[16:40] what God has said be careful what you do
[16:42] because if it's God's prophet and it's
[16:44] his word you may disagree but certainly
[16:47] respect it things he said are mocked
[16:50] they're in derision look at a scripture
[16:52] sure if I can find it here in 119 if you
[16:54] still have your Bible open let me see if
[16:56] I can find that one he says in 119. in
[17:00] verse
[17:01] I didn't write this down but there was
[17:03] something about the word derision they
[17:05] had me in derision
[17:07] um
[17:08] yeah of course oh here it is verse 51
[17:11] David says the proud have had me greatly
[17:15] in derision and that means they have
[17:18] mocked what I'm standing for they are
[17:20] mocking what I believe they're mocking
[17:22] these precepts but look what he said
[17:24] even though he's being mocked and the
[17:25] words being mocked the proud had me in
[17:27] greatly in derision yet have I not
[17:30] declined from thy law
[17:33] they've posted a lot of stuff against
[17:37] this message and against me and yet I
[17:41] have not declined from your law
[17:44] I still respect the quotes from God's
[17:47] prophet
[17:49] amen
[17:50] so some are in Rebellion some are
[17:53] provoking God when you leave a service
[17:55] like Sunday and you go and do the
[17:57] opposite and post the opposite boy
[17:59] where's it come when you're provoking
[18:00] God then can I get an amen
[18:03] but some it's not provoking a rebellion
[18:05] some it's just sarcasm about certain
[18:08] quotes and things God says but here I
[18:11] love the law and guess what this is
[18:13] David's saying this before Calvary so
[18:16] before the possibility is the holy
[18:18] spirit coming in in an individual and
[18:20] living the law by the spirit this is
[18:23] before the spirit is on the soul yet
[18:25] oh it says before count
[18:27] this is way before there's any
[18:29] possibility of of the laws being written
[18:32] in the heart or in the Soul by the Holy
[18:35] Ghost before that David's already saying
[18:38] I love it I want to live by it
[18:40] that's amazing friends because we've got
[18:43] the blessing of calvary
[18:44] we've got the blessing of living a holy
[18:47] ghost life the amen are on the inside
[18:49] that in the soul when the flesh even
[18:52] says I don't want it the soul says amen
[18:55] Lord I want it I desire thy laws I want
[18:57] your word I want what your Prophet said
[19:00] I want it I want it it was sent for me
[19:02] it's not sent for everybody
[19:06] that's the reality of it I wish the
[19:08] whole world could receive it but it's
[19:10] not sent for everybody I want the love
[19:12] of God in my heart that I know that it's
[19:14] set for me and I want to embrace it I
[19:16] want to take all of it can you say amen
[19:18] and so they had nothing to live it by
[19:20] the spirit but David loves it anyway he
[19:23] Embraces it David changes his attitude
[19:25] towards the statues and precepts of God
[19:28] his mind had changed to love them and
[19:31] not to try to get around them because
[19:33] human nature and the serpent nature is
[19:36] to get around the laws of God
[19:40] Eve only had one thing from God to
[19:43] believe and follow and Satan got her
[19:45] around it
[19:46] Satan reads with reason with it
[19:49] so something has to happen to us to say
[19:51] I'm not looking for ways around it
[19:54] anymore
[19:58] I'm not looking for ways around it I'm
[20:00] I'm looking to for God to keep opening
[20:03] it to me because I love it he gave it to
[20:06] me it's for us can you say Amen now
[20:08] picking up from Sunday a little bit
[20:11] it was years after the prophet Moses
[20:13] gave his law that David had put some
[20:15] other things in place as I was speaking
[20:17] Sunday he gave some other things in
[20:18] place because different situations would
[20:20] come up and the high court or the
[20:22] Supreme Court of David and different
[20:24] ones would would bring laws as as a as a
[20:28] as a further interpretation I would say
[20:31] of what Moses said because there are
[20:33] situations that come up when as I was
[20:35] saying Sunday a husband being with
[20:37] another woman alone in a locked room
[20:39] um so they said we need to address that
[20:41] so they put in there a precept they put
[20:43] in there a thing that says uh and I gave
[20:45] you the law for it on Sunday I can't
[20:47] remember the name just now but it was it
[20:49] was to forbid that to happen for a man
[20:52] who wanted to be alone somewhere by
[20:53] themselves because it sets them up for
[20:55] Temptation and so they just made a law
[20:57] and then I mentioned to you after
[20:58] amnon's case then they had another thing
[21:01] with the high court and said now we need
[21:03] to we need to extend this to single guys
[21:06] and single girls because they're under
[21:08] sexual Temptation too and you put them
[21:10] long enough in a room something could
[21:13] take over if they're in a locked room
[21:15] and nobody's watching them so if it's an
[21:16] open place and people can see them or
[21:19] someone could surprise them that's the
[21:20] law as well if there was a possibility
[21:22] of something coming in and surprising
[21:24] them then it was okay see because
[21:26] they're open but if they're
[21:28] intentionally locked in a room together
[21:30] or in some place together and no one can
[21:33] see them and get to them you're setting
[21:34] yourself up for Temptation these laws
[21:37] were put in place after amnon for single
[21:39] people and then it trickled down and
[21:41] kept going and I'm not speaking on that
[21:43] again but it was very important to me
[21:45] that I found it in the scripture to see
[21:47] something that I've always encouraged in
[21:49] young people don't set yourself up for
[21:51] Temptation don't give yourself places
[21:53] that the flesh can take over but live
[21:55] with Integrity lived honorable can you
[21:58] say man honor that guy honor that girl
[22:01] and have some boundaries in place that
[22:03] God can honor according to the word of
[22:05] God and I think God will bless you for
[22:07] that can you say Amen
[22:09] praise the Lord so I um I I in talking
[22:13] about that I thank God for the message
[22:15] of the last days for our time how many
[22:17] thanks God for the message
[22:20] I thank God for the message because you
[22:22] know you have uh uh brother Brandon was
[22:25] mentioning something to me in the office
[22:27] there is that even sometimes when when
[22:29] you have something like the spirits
[22:32] taking over of lesbians and homosexuals
[22:34] and the spirits you may not have taken
[22:36] that Spirit but we have warnings to keep
[22:38] us from those Spirits coming in and so
[22:40] in the Bible days they greeted one
[22:42] another with a holy kiss men kissed men
[22:44] on the neck and actually brother Branham
[22:47] he says now we're not doing that because
[22:48] that's not our greeting today we're
[22:50] going to shake one another's hands
[22:53] you see now now you either believe he
[22:56] has the authority to adjust that
[23:00] he hasn't changed the the core of what's
[23:02] in God's mind
[23:04] hasn't changed but now for our
[23:06] generation now he says that's not going
[23:08] to work for the men to be kissing one
[23:10] another why because the spirit of
[23:12] homosexuality is present he said you
[23:15] start to open the doors to those Spirits
[23:17] so we're not going to kiss one another
[23:19] we're going to shake hands
[23:21] look at the authority now if you did not
[23:24] see the authority of God's man or the
[23:26] hour pulling from the thoughts of God
[23:27] for our day if you didn't see that
[23:29] you're going to Buck up against it but
[23:31] you see now God breathes on a generation
[23:34] to give us precepts and principles that
[23:37] are meant for the generation as well
[23:38] that's just the way I believe it because
[23:41] the people in Moses day would have had
[23:43] to believe the same thing the people
[23:45] that Nathan's day would have had to
[23:46] believe the same thing the people in
[23:48] Isaiah and Jeremiah because there were
[23:50] other prophets and some of them would
[23:51] have said no you know what I'm sticking
[23:53] with what he said back there but yet
[23:55] Jeremiah it was addressing the children
[23:57] of Israel going into idols and different
[24:00] things so now he had to address what was
[24:02] going on for the day can you say amen
[24:04] and so you couldn't say well I'm going
[24:06] to believe this prophet and not this one
[24:07] no because God's breathing on a
[24:10] generation saying I love my people that
[24:12] I may give some precepts for them to be
[24:14] able to understand for their day
[24:17] in their own language you ought to thank
[24:18] God it's in English for you
[24:20] a lot of countries don't have that don't
[24:22] have so much access but God breathed on
[24:25] this generation
[24:26] God
[24:27] brought his word to our generation
[24:31] and it's more up to date I think I said
[24:33] this Sunday I preached this Sunday and I
[24:35] don't have
[24:36] as many here but I'm going to preach
[24:38] anyway tonight
[24:39] this word is more up to date than
[24:42] anything I've found
[24:44] it's more up to date than it ever was
[24:45] it's more relevant than it ever has been
[24:47] he gave us his word and he's put
[24:49] Protections in place and you start
[24:52] playing with them then you're going to
[24:53] have you're going to open yourself up to
[24:55] Spirits in your home in your mind in
[24:58] your life God's put Protections in place
[25:02] and so so that's when you say
[25:04] I'm not strong enough to protect myself
[25:08] so I love thy law I love this quote and
[25:12] I'm going to apply this because I know
[25:14] going with the word comes a protection
[25:17] God can give me
[25:19] God loved me enough to put that there is
[25:21] that okay with everybody amen so you
[25:24] know what I'm just going to keep
[25:25] preaching this I'm going to keep
[25:26] preaching practical I'm going to keep
[25:28] preaching all the quotes
[25:30] I have some even in my assembly I think
[25:33] if I never talked about dress like I did
[25:35] Sunday they would love it love to come
[25:37] here they would like certain stuff it's
[25:39] interesting I received probably more
[25:41] response and support than I ever have
[25:43] for what we talked about Sunday
[25:44] undressed and I appreciate it very much
[25:46] but sometimes then other ones are have
[25:48] gone completely silent
[25:51] curiously not a word set about it
[25:54] because and that's a shame that's not
[25:56] fair to me as a minister I should be
[25:58] able to freely Minister all this message
[26:00] this is the message of Christ for the
[26:02] last days I'm not going to just talk
[26:04] talk about just Doctrine or just the
[26:06] things that uh that bring emotion and
[26:09] just Redemption I love to preach about
[26:11] Redemption and it makes me when you
[26:13] preach hope and Redemption that's
[26:14] wonderful can you say Amen but sometimes
[26:16] correction is needed and if you put me
[26:18] in a place that I can only preach on
[26:19] certain plots and if I get on the other
[26:21] parts you go silent on me on your
[26:23] support that's not fair to a minister
[26:27] but I'm going to keep doing it
[26:29] because brother Brian said I went out to
[26:30] Phoenix I go out there every year he
[26:32] says I preach it the standards and it
[26:34] gets worse and worse he said but I'm
[26:36] going to keep on preaching it
[26:38] it's because of the spirit of this age
[26:40] and the wave has taken people through
[26:41] all the social media and Fashions of
[26:43] this world it's trying to grab a hold of
[26:45] our girls it's trying to get over the
[26:47] minds of the people as they preach
[26:48] Sunday and listen listen God has sent us
[26:51] his word with the power of protections
[26:54] with it
[26:55] he said well they need the holy ghost
[26:56] first yes they need the Holy Ghost but I
[26:58] believe there's a power in the world
[27:00] until they get the Holy Ghost if they
[27:02] say Lord I'm going to follow your
[27:03] precepts I think there's a protection in
[27:05] place for it
[27:06] that's just the way I believe it and I'm
[27:08] going to keep preaching this because
[27:09] look at what Luther said Luther Martin
[27:11] Luther said this if you preach the
[27:14] gospel with all of its aspects with the
[27:17] exception of dealing with the issues
[27:19] specifically for your time you are not
[27:22] preaching the gospel at all
[27:27] read it again okay I will if you preach
[27:30] the gospel with all of his aspects with
[27:33] the exception of dealing with issues
[27:35] specific for your time you are not
[27:37] preaching the gospel at all
[27:40] because the convictions of the Gospel
[27:42] the gospel is the good news when you
[27:45] preach Redemption when you preach it's
[27:47] for your age too and when you preach it
[27:49] you're going to be blasting out and
[27:51] warning people of The Temptations of the
[27:54] age
[27:55] but you're not just going to keep
[27:56] preaching The Temptations and keep
[27:58] preaching that this world is all dirty
[28:00] and the spirits are there you're going
[28:01] to bring around a hope and Calvary and
[28:03] the good news I've got an atonement for
[28:06] you I've got an answer for you it hasn't
[28:08] changed since Calvary I don't care how
[28:11] bad the modern day gets his blood is
[28:14] powerful enough to change a life it
[28:17] never loses its power can I get an amen
[28:19] tonight his blood reaches to the deepest
[28:22] Mirey clay his blood has the answer for
[28:25] any depression his blood has the answer
[28:28] from any mental breakdown can you say
[28:30] man his power is there for us he gave it
[28:33] to us we just have to receive it
[28:35] we just have to say Lord I want it I
[28:37] love it take me Lord can you say Amen
[28:40] so we love the law of God but I want you
[28:42] to look at Joseph just before we go into
[28:45] some other things Joseph here
[28:47] uh being a type of Christ he was in a
[28:50] situation where he was tempted or I
[28:52] should say he was in a room and they did
[28:55] not have that law yet that said a man
[28:57] and woman shouldn't be alone in a room
[28:59] and pontiver's wife was all trying to
[29:01] get a hold of Joseph and get him locked
[29:03] in a way in a private place and so then
[29:05] she appealed to him you know the story
[29:06] with Joseph but Joseph with no heart
[29:09] laws hardly at all except for Abraham
[29:11] this was before Moses now so there's no
[29:13] Ten Commandments there's no things put
[29:15] in place yet okay and this is actually a
[29:18] type of this is a type of Joseph is a
[29:20] type of Christ and that is that if you
[29:23] have Christ in your life you've got the
[29:25] law Giver within you
[29:28] and somehow him being a type of Christ
[29:31] before he had any specific laws about I
[29:34] need to get out of here because the Ten
[29:35] Commandments says for me to get out
[29:36] Joseph didn't have that
[29:39] and so here he is and with this highly
[29:42] uh how should I say this he's a young
[29:45] man he's a young and strong and she's
[29:48] she's attracted to him a married woman
[29:50] and now she appeals to him in a room
[29:53] alone can you say amen and she's coming
[29:55] and and that combination I'll tell you
[29:57] it the story could have read altogether
[30:00] different the story could have read uh
[30:02] like David's story the story could have
[30:04] read like a lot of the stories in the
[30:07] news today
[30:09] because there's no Holy Ghost there
[30:11] there's no precepts there there's
[30:13] nothing there you're not young people
[30:15] you're not in that place
[30:17] you're not in the place of the world
[30:19] that you have no escape and nothing to
[30:21] go on
[30:22] there's the Holy Ghost there's the
[30:24] protections of the Holy Ghost there's
[30:26] the principles that we're preaching
[30:28] there's the principles of God that you
[30:29] know about
[30:31] so you won't have an excuse because
[30:33] you've got those things you can cling to
[30:35] Joseph's in the room alone and he didn't
[30:38] know this was going to happen she starts
[30:39] to come after him and in in and the
[30:43] scripture says four words there wasn't a
[30:46] long law for him to go by he loved the
[30:48] Lord he loved the Lord he's a type of
[30:51] Christ
[30:52] and it just says he did one thing four
[30:54] words Henry forwards he got him out
[30:59] just profound
[31:02] he didn't try to witness to her
[31:04] he didn't try to get her to turn to
[31:06] Jehovah God
[31:07] he didn't say can we have a Bible study
[31:09] first here and just try to point you to
[31:11] the Lord
[31:13] he got him out
[31:19] you know why I mentioned Henry because
[31:21] there was one time I was preaching this
[31:23] years ago
[31:24] when both of us were single probably and
[31:26] I said if we would just live by those
[31:29] three words he got him out
[31:32] just those three words and I held up
[31:34] three fingers the whole time
[31:36] and Henry's back there doing what he's
[31:37] doing now he's counting the words and
[31:39] he's he's counting four and I've got
[31:42] three fingers up see Henry it's just
[31:45] Wednesday night here Henry has all of my
[31:47] preaching bloopers if you ever want to
[31:49] hear him he's heard me for umpteen years
[31:52] here and they're like he he's got he
[31:55] can't remember a lot of things but he
[31:57] can remember all of my bloopers for all
[31:59] of my sermons sit down take an hour with
[32:01] him and he'll tell you all of them and
[32:02] that's one of them I'm saying just live
[32:04] by brothers and sisters young men live
[32:06] by those three words he got him out and
[32:10] there's Henry's back there going one two
[32:12] three
[32:14] so I got it straight tonight I got my
[32:16] math right
[32:19] and I'll keep it to four and I'll
[32:20] continue to say that's all the scripture
[32:22] says he got him out there was no
[32:24] explanation there's nothing he said he
[32:27] said I can't do this sin against my God
[32:31] it wasn't about what they would do he
[32:34] was so in love with God I can't do this
[32:36] sin because he was so close to God can I
[32:39] get an amen tonight he was so dedicated
[32:42] to his God I can't do this offense
[32:45] against not you not me against my God
[32:50] that's the way we need to live that's
[32:52] when Christ is living within us because
[32:54] everything we do is not living by a law
[32:56] we can live by law but it's that I don't
[32:58] want to do anything to offend this
[33:00] Christ within me I would not do this
[33:03] and so here's let's bring it up today he
[33:06] got him out that's what he did that's
[33:07] all he did he got him out he told her no
[33:11] four words
[33:14] young girls she told him no
[33:18] that's it
[33:22] he turned it off
[33:26] come on friends I'm bringing it up today
[33:31] he turned his head
[33:36] never clicked that page
[33:40] oh I should be getting some more amens
[33:42] tonight never click that page I'm
[33:45] bringing it up today
[33:47] I I never touched that girl
[33:52] he got him out never touched that girl
[33:55] he had a principle in place and a
[33:59] conviction in place and he put feet on
[34:02] his convention and he got him out
[34:05] you can talk about convictions all day
[34:07] long but In the Heat of the Moment you
[34:09] better apply them and get out like
[34:11] Joseph got out somebody ought to say
[34:13] praise the Lord
[34:15] now Josh McDonald says some things here
[34:17] a couple things about the principles of
[34:19] God and we'll just bring it to a close
[34:20] two teenagers
[34:22] board on a hot summer night
[34:25] remember that a neighbor has a backyard
[34:28] pool
[34:29] they also remember that the neighbors
[34:31] are on vacation they decide to sneak
[34:33] over to enjoy a refreshing swim they
[34:35] giggle as they clamor over the tall
[34:37] backyard fence willfully ignoring the
[34:40] posted signs no trespassing and no
[34:43] swimming
[34:45] the girl cautiously makes her way across
[34:47] the unlit backyard as her boyfriend
[34:48] races to the diving board with one hard
[34:51] bounce
[34:53] he hits his body he throws his body high
[34:56] into the air the girl's laugh turns to a
[34:59] shriek as she reaches the pool's Edge
[35:01] and realizes there is no water in that
[35:05] pool
[35:06] the impact of the boy's dive snaps his
[35:09] neck instantly paralyzing him for life
[35:15] so Josh McDowell makes the comment the
[35:17] homeowners didn't post the warnings to
[35:19] make to take the fun
[35:21] from the boy's life
[35:24] but to protect those who are around the
[35:26] pool
[35:28] in choosing to disregard the posted
[35:31] warnings he moved himself into a
[35:35] dangerous spot
[35:39] I say it again in choosing because it's
[35:41] a choice everybody right
[35:44] when God has his precepts in front of us
[35:46] and the world the wisdom of the world
[35:47] it's a choice it's a choice after what I
[35:50] preached Sunday it's a choice
[35:52] got to choose
[35:54] and in choosing to disregard posted
[35:57] warnings because as I preached Sunday
[35:59] some things are not you have you've
[36:01] sinned already but this has the
[36:04] potential to lead you into sin this is a
[36:06] warning sign this is something be
[36:08] careful of this that could lead in this
[36:10] direction can you say Amen they ignored
[36:12] and by choosing to disregard posted
[36:15] warnings I think the message has a lot
[36:17] of posted warnings for us in doing that
[36:20] he this kid moved himself into Danger
[36:23] and so he's like this young man we often
[36:26] don't see the looming dangers or we
[36:28] minimize the consequences of stepping
[36:30] into sin how much can it hurt
[36:33] we asked ourselves
[36:35] unfortunately you and I have a very
[36:37] limited perspective
[36:40] God on the other hand sees every
[36:42] possible scenario and their resulting
[36:45] joys
[36:47] and sorrows
[36:49] how many would agree tonight
[36:51] that
[36:52] we have a very limited perspective
[36:59] come on now let's be humble
[37:02] we have a very limited perspective
[37:04] but God has the greatest perspective
[37:08] and God sees every possible scenario and
[37:13] the resulting Joys and sorrows
[37:17] Joyce you should say Joys or Sorrows
[37:19] because the scenarios could be joys
[37:22] or could be Sorrows God sees all that he
[37:25] sees the scenarios
[37:27] he says have you ever entered one of
[37:29] those corn mazes
[37:31] and they're having those now I don't
[37:33] know if you've been through a corn maze
[37:34] yet
[37:35] but at every Junction in the corn maze
[37:38] you're saying should I turn right should
[37:40] I turn left perhaps and you're trying to
[37:42] figure out the corn means okay trying to
[37:44] go through it and with every Wrong Turn
[37:46] and Dead End you get more confused about
[37:48] where you are in the maze
[37:50] and the location of the correct path
[37:52] leading to the exit if you only had a
[37:55] bird's eye view it would be a lot easier
[37:58] can you say Amen if you had a guide a
[38:01] trustworthy Source perch the top of a
[38:04] real high ladder you'd have help in
[38:06] making the right choices to successfully
[38:09] navigate the maze in life we can
[38:12] consistently make right choices and
[38:14] enjoy much good in life by following
[38:17] God's guidelines and God's boundaries
[38:21] can you say Amen
[38:24] he has a much taller ladder he's looking
[38:26] from a much taller place
[38:28] and he sees this maze how many would
[38:31] agree we're in a maze of this world how
[38:33] many would agree that the young people
[38:34] are in her maze a corn maze trying to
[38:38] navigate which direction to go
[38:42] way worse than it was 20 years ago way
[38:44] worse than it was 10 years ago it's a
[38:46] corn maze
[38:48] how wonderful it would be and how
[38:50] wonderful it is I can tell you tonight
[38:52] we've got a god with a bird's eye view
[38:56] let's take it further we got a guy
[38:57] within we got a god with an eagle's View
[39:01] because God the Great Eagle is looking
[39:03] from the top and he can see go this way
[39:06] go this way go this way and this will
[39:08] get you out of this world and bring you
[39:10] to a rapture
[39:11] I said it'll bring you to a rapture this
[39:14] word this word is not just to keep us
[39:18] holy Christians it's to bring us to a
[39:21] rapture
[39:22] it's to bring us to The Great Escape
[39:24] that our children and us can get out of
[39:27] here and friends I said it to you Sunday
[39:28] we might we must be close one of the
[39:31] greatest things that hit me on Sunday
[39:33] and I didn't drive it home enough I
[39:34] don't know if I did but it hit me when I
[39:36] got only been thinking about for two or
[39:37] three days is that how can somebody
[39:39] stand and admit that we are at the full
[39:41] manifestation of Sodom and Gomorrah in
[39:44] the 60s he preached two things flashing
[39:46] red light I don't know how many listened
[39:47] to it two things that are a sign of the
[39:49] coming of the Lord is soon number one in
[39:51] the days of Noah the sons of God saw the
[39:53] daughters of men that they were pretty
[39:55] and they fell by it pornography all the
[39:58] increase in Beauty and the modesty in
[40:00] women
[40:03] we've seen that start in the 50s and 60s
[40:06] and we've seen that but we didn't see
[40:07] the full manifestation yet of the Sodom
[40:10] and Gomorrah spirit that had to come
[40:12] because Jesus said as in the days of
[40:15] Sodom we are here and my thought was how
[40:18] could anybody buck up against me talking
[40:20] about modesty
[40:23] to the sisters of our church and the
[40:25] brothers as well
[40:26] and still admit that we're in the time
[40:29] of Sodom where we're rubbing shoulders
[40:31] with it every day how could anybody say
[40:33] I don't know if that's I think that's
[40:35] overboard I think that's cool how could
[40:36] you be too extreme
[40:39] with the spirits as prevalent they are
[40:41] trying to take our children I'm not sure
[40:43] that you could be of too extreme unless
[40:44] you make it just legalism and not preach
[40:46] it by the Holy Spirit
[40:49] but don't buck up against preachers that
[40:51] would seem they're making an extreme not
[40:53] when the homosexual spirit is so
[40:54] prevalent time to trying to take our
[40:56] daughters trying to take our sons trying
[40:58] to pervert our minds
[41:01] I'm here to tell you that God put in
[41:04] place his precepts his word his statues
[41:08] even in the message of this hour to
[41:11] prepare us to be able to go through this
[41:14] time and here's the point if we've got
[41:16] the full manifestation of song Gomorrah
[41:18] here where some of us I know some of us
[41:21] are sick of it
[41:24] it's just it's grieving me more and more
[41:29] I say this we must be very close
[41:33] to the coming of the Lord
[41:37] said we must be very close to the coming
[41:40] of the Lord and so be it even so come
[41:43] quickly Lord Jesus I'm ready to go you
[41:45] got your plans you got this you got to
[41:47] do this next weekend you got this plan
[41:50] for retirement go ahead and do it and
[41:51] and I do it too but listen my heart says
[41:54] I'm ready to step out of this any moment
[41:56] God calls us home I'm ready to get out
[41:58] of here
[42:00] and we are close friends can you say
[42:02] Amen
[42:03] do you believe that
[42:06] he's he's he's saying God says that this
[42:09] way do you believe that I love you and
[42:11] want to bless you with provision and
[42:12] protection then commit to my boundaries
[42:14] they are good they are for your good
[42:16] because I am good
[42:18] from God's Eternal perspective God does
[42:21] life with us asking
[42:24] do you want to avoid heartache in your
[42:25] life
[42:26] follow my precepts don't deviate you
[42:29] want to avoid addiction
[42:31] follow my precepts don't deviate you
[42:34] want to be successful in business follow
[42:36] my precepts don't deviate from it you
[42:39] want to experience true meaningful love
[42:43] follow my precepts and don't deviate
[42:47] from them
[42:48] you might have to wait for genuine real
[42:51] love but don't ever go away from his
[42:53] precepts
[42:56] but sometimes we get in our heads that
[42:58] we know better than God
[43:00] so we make willful choices outside of
[43:02] his boundaries and then must suffer the
[43:04] consequences so we should spend time
[43:07] reflecting on our life and how choosing
[43:09] to live with God's boundaries has
[43:10] protected you but also look at the times
[43:12] you willfully Step Beyond his umbrella
[43:14] of protection and had to endure the
[43:16] Fallout here's the thing about Sin the
[43:18] repercussions aren't always immediately
[43:21] evident sometimes we think we've gotten
[43:23] away with it but sin eventually demands
[43:25] our payment unless we each come to
[43:28] understand and this is important unless
[43:30] we each come to understand God loves me
[43:32] and I can trust him
[43:34] we will never walk through life
[43:36] dependent on the character of God to
[43:39] make the right choices
[43:41] I'm going to say it again I'm not you
[43:43] see this is before you can talk about
[43:44] dress you can talk about boundaries you
[43:47] can talk about rules all you want to but
[43:51] something has to drop deeper and this is
[43:53] what d That's what I said about David he
[43:55] said I love thy law
[43:59] David's not saying I have to do this
[44:02] he's saying I love it he come to a place
[44:04] I love it I love your precepts the more
[44:07] the more detail that God's made it for
[44:10] me the better I embrace it I love it I
[44:12] haven't I'm not bucking up against it
[44:15] when I read that quote of Moses when I
[44:18] read that quote of the Prophet Nathan
[44:20] when I read that thing I'm all over it
[44:23] I'm saying Lord you said that for a
[44:26] reason and I would never dump that out
[44:28] there's got to be a reason that you said
[44:30] it
[44:31] I love it because of this unless we come
[44:35] to understand that God loves me and I
[44:38] can trust him
[44:41] don't talk about all the details
[44:43] addressing to you do you trust God
[44:45] do you know that he loves you
[44:48] unless we get that we will never walk
[44:50] through life dependent on the character
[44:51] of God to make the right choices aren't
[44:55] you glad God gives us another mind
[44:58] aren't you glad he sent us the mind of
[45:00] Christ
[45:02] so if he sent us his mind through the
[45:03] thoughts of God and the mind of Christ
[45:05] which is in the soul brother Abraham
[45:07] says we must fill our hearts with his
[45:09] word
[45:10] fill our hearts with his word not fill
[45:12] our hearts with entertainments all the
[45:14] time
[45:15] we need a Revival in our hearts and
[45:18] filling our hearts with the word we need
[45:19] a Revival of repentance and we need a
[45:22] Revival in our thought life and we need
[45:24] as brother Brown says a Revival now
[45:26] friends I know there's things promised
[45:28] further for the bride but I don't look
[45:31] for that as much as and I say that
[45:33] respectfully I'm under expectation of
[45:35] what God would do in our lives before we
[45:37] get out of here
[45:39] but when you read about Revival brother
[45:41] Bradham says there's other things that
[45:43] we are doing for God to come and do
[45:46] those things
[45:47] we're not trying to make a Revival
[45:49] happen and one of the things he said as
[45:51] he was watching Lake Michigan in Chicago
[45:53] he says I noticed over there he said
[45:55] this great he said the the waters coming
[45:58] up with Great Waves because the wind was
[46:00] coming but he says what it was doing is
[46:02] brushing up all the trash that was in
[46:04] the water and blowing it up on the beach
[46:07] and blowing up in the side and he said
[46:09] that's a Revival when God begins to move
[46:11] and move all the trash out of our lives
[46:15] then the water's clean then you can have
[46:17] a real Revival
[46:19] and God clean up all the trash in our
[46:21] lives then we start to have a Revival
[46:24] not we work it up by the music
[46:26] now that we were you know we're not
[46:29] totally living right but we're just
[46:30] gonna we want to get a good feeling I
[46:32] want you to have more than a good
[46:33] feeling
[46:34] I want it to be genuine to be real when
[46:37] you shout when you dance and listen
[46:39] you're welcome to do it and some people
[46:41] don't give them themselves enough
[46:42] freedom to do it but you I want to know
[46:44] when you do it there's a life there
[46:46] that's saying I love his law I love his
[46:48] word I'm stimulated by the revelation of
[46:51] his word I'm not sure you get a
[46:53] revelation there's not if there's not a
[46:54] stimulation that goes with it
[46:56] God's word has a stimulation that goes
[46:59] with his word when it's revealed to your
[47:01] heart but we never are working up these
[47:04] things
[47:06] we're never trying to make the the
[47:08] Dynamics work or try to push to try to
[47:11] make those work
[47:12] we're we're ordering our lives by the
[47:15] word of God we're saying Lord make me
[47:18] more prayerful God let me just be more
[47:20] sincere these are the things that God
[47:23] would come down and tell his Prophet if
[47:25] he could just do this or didn't know it
[47:27] was if you could just have more prayer
[47:28] lines no no he said the prophet
[47:30] personally if you'll be more sincere
[47:34] if there's something wrong in your life
[47:36] correct that correct it
[47:40] let all the trash be washed to the to
[47:42] the side and then watch the other things
[47:46] happen in your life
[47:49] don't
[47:50] be dependent upon the other another
[47:52] person's experience they may be shouting
[47:55] and rejoicing and getting something from
[47:57] God but we never compare ourselves we
[48:00] know where we're at with God
[48:02] we want the conviction of God in our
[48:04] heart and then when you know you've got
[48:07] something solid there if it makes you
[48:09] rejoice if it makes you shout if it
[48:11] makes you dance praise be to God
[48:16] but only you know if it's genuine on the
[48:19] inside only you know if you've made
[48:21] contact with God really made contact we
[48:23] don't want to borrow or
[48:25] imitate somebody else we want to know in
[48:28] our heart Something's Happened to me and
[48:30] now I want to rejoice in that
[48:32] we need to move all the trash out and
[48:34] then watch the other things happen get
[48:36] rid of this constant resistance if you
[48:38] have it tonight if you're listening you
[48:40] have a resistance to the quotes a
[48:42] resistance to the guidelines we need to
[48:45] be embracing them trusting them God
[48:47] breathed on this generation somebody
[48:49] somebody's broken the trust in this
[48:52] message somebody's done it the enemy's
[48:53] done this thing the things that the
[48:56] prophet said were for a reason they were
[48:58] for this age it was for our protection
[49:01] don't mess with God's boundaries
[49:06] don't mess with God's precepts
[49:09] say God
[49:12] put something within me that David had
[49:14] that my love
[49:16] is such a love for your law for yours
[49:19] statues for your principles all those
[49:22] things
[49:23] I broke it down a few years ago I'm
[49:25] closing now I broke it down a few years
[49:26] ago precepts
[49:30] um statues the law the testimonies
[49:34] there's five or six different things
[49:35] there and actually they are similar but
[49:38] they all have a little bit different
[49:39] meaning some of the precepts are some of
[49:40] the breakdown of practical things that
[49:42] come off off of the law
[49:44] and so David said David didn't leave any
[49:47] of them out when he said I love all
[49:49] these things I failed I I made a mistake
[49:52] but I'm I'm I'm I'm backlord by your
[49:55] grace
[49:56] how many knows that his repentance was
[49:58] there in Psalms uh uh somebody help me
[50:01] out Psalms 50 I think it was 53 where
[50:03] his repentance he Lord he said Lord
[50:05] Purge me with hyssop Lord build the
[50:09] walls of Jerusalem God I Repent before
[50:11] his repentance was thorough Lord never
[50:13] let me do this again
[50:16] and it's so deeply moved him after his
[50:18] mistake that he's saying Lord I am no
[50:20] longer going to take the risk of trying
[50:23] to get around certain precepts I'm going
[50:26] to Value every one of them is anybody
[50:28] listening here tonight I love them
[50:31] because I love you
[50:34] I trust them because I trust you
[50:38] I trust that there's a power behind them
[50:40] and there's a protection that goes with
[50:42] them there's an umbrella that goes with
[50:44] them that will protect me even when I
[50:46] can't see things in the corn maze myself
[50:49] you're watching over me and you gave me
[50:51] this word at this age
[50:54] so that you could Hew out a people Hew
[50:56] out a bride to mold a bride a
[50:58] masterpiece in this age that will escape
[51:01] pornography that will escape these
[51:03] things of this Earth that will escape
[51:05] the homosexual spirit that will escape
[51:07] the sexual dirty spirit in this age
[51:10] there's gonna be a group of young people
[51:13] there's gonna be a bride that escapes
[51:16] all these things that overcomes all
[51:18] these things and why because God was
[51:21] faithful to bring his word to this
[51:23] generation
[51:25] God was faithful to not only bring his
[51:27] word but to pour out his spirit in the
[51:29] last days can you say amen he said the
[51:31] Holy Spirit had been bound for almost 2
[51:34] 000 years by Creeds and dogmas but he
[51:37] said it's to be released in the evening
[51:39] time by the evening time messenger
[51:41] friends it wasn't just doctrine that was
[51:43] released to us it wasn't just the Seven
[51:45] Seals but through the ministry of the
[51:48] last days I'll release my Holy Ghost to
[51:50] the people they'll have full access to
[51:53] the holy spirit in their lives and then
[51:55] there will be a bride rise and say I
[51:58] love this word I love his laws I'm not
[52:01] dumping out any of this scripture it all
[52:04] has relevance to me
[52:06] I don't want to be a one-man
[52:07] denomination because denomination starts
[52:09] picking and choosing what they want out
[52:11] of this the days of Miracles are passed
[52:13] that doesn't apply today First
[52:15] Corinthians 7 doesn't play to a woman's
[52:16] hair today it only applied them we don't
[52:18] make those decisions we say if God
[52:20] valued it and God accurately echoed it
[52:22] again through his Prophet his age we
[52:24] value it we're leaving it alone we're
[52:26] not messing with it
[52:28] if God said it I believe it that settles
[52:30] it I love his law
[52:33] I love his word Lord I want you to know
[52:37] tonight I may not understand every
[52:40] detail of this word but I want him to
[52:41] know I love this word I trust this word
[52:46] I have a full confidence in it and
[52:48] that's what we need in young people we
[52:50] need a group of people to rise and say I
[52:52] have one honor 100 confidence in this
[52:55] word and the message of Christ for the
[52:57] last days and I'm all in I'm all in
[53:00] let God see see I can't see that in you
[53:04] sometimes there's characteristics in us
[53:06] to say Well they're playing they're
[53:07] playing games with this thing because
[53:08] they're up and down from one week to the
[53:09] next they don't know where they stand
[53:10] but you see God sees
[53:13] that that resonating thing out of you
[53:15] say God
[53:16] I I may be
[53:18] I may not feel like the strongest
[53:20] Christian today
[53:22] but he looks inside and the Soul says
[53:24] they're all in
[53:27] let God look at my life on the inside
[53:30] and he can say they're all in
[53:33] they're not exiting they're not leaving
[53:36] in their hearts they're all in Let God
[53:38] see that in me tonight he really loves
[53:41] my word
[53:43] he he failed last week he he he he made
[53:47] a decision that was maybe not my perfect
[53:51] will he was in my permissive will
[53:53] but he repented he recognized what he
[53:55] did wrong but overall I can look at his
[53:58] heart and I can see he's all in
[54:01] he's not leaving
[54:06] Hallelujah
[54:10] I love him tonight and I love his word
[54:12] let's Stand Together
[54:21] Charles
[54:23] Wesley
[54:24] wrote A Hymn and risk going to read the
[54:27] the lyric to you I don't think we know
[54:30] it here sometime I'd like to get in the
[54:31] lyrics and sing it
[54:34] applies a little bit to this I just I've
[54:37] always enjoyed it the Collinsworth
[54:38] family sings it
[54:40] traditional hymn Charles Wesleyan they
[54:42] wrote thousands of hymns
[54:44] but this one's called I want a principle
[54:46] within I want a principle Within Me
[54:49] of watchful Godly fear
[54:53] a sensibility of sin
[54:56] pain to feel it near
[54:59] I want the first approach to feel of
[55:01] Pride or wrong desire to catch the
[55:05] wandering of my will and quench the
[55:08] kindling fire
[55:10] the second verse says from thee that I
[55:12] know more may stray no more thy goodness
[55:16] grieve grant me the foul follow all I
[55:20] pray the tender conscience give quick is
[55:23] the apple of an eye oh God my conscience
[55:26] make Awake My Soul When sin is nigh and
[55:30] keep it still awake
[55:32] the third verse says almighty God of
[55:34] Truth and Love
[55:36] to me thy power in part
[55:38] the mountain from my soul removed the
[55:41] hardness from my heart o May the least
[55:44] Omission pain my reawakened soul and
[55:48] drive me to the blood again which makes
[55:51] the wounded whole
[55:54] praise be to God I want a principle deep
[55:57] within
[55:59] that temptation as soon as it's there
[56:01] I'm so awakened to what's in my soul
[56:03] that I would sense it right away say
[56:06] Lord protect me from that that's how we
[56:09] want to live friends

[56:16] for your precepts we love your precepts
[56:20] we love this word I say it to you often
[56:22] now that if we if we didn't have
[56:26] the words of a prophet
[56:29] throughout the scripture where would we
[56:31] be
[56:33] and Lord I wouldn't have anything to
[56:34] instruct to order my family or my home
[56:38] and order my life I wouldn't have
[56:40] anything to go on and you have given us
[56:43] your Commandments your precepts your
[56:47] words Lord the spoken word is the
[56:49] Original Seed and in the original seed

[57:15] direction Lord makes us want to love you
[57:17] deeper and know you deeper father and I
[57:20] pray Lord
[57:21] that my heart as a pastor would come
[57:25] closer and closer and closer to these
[57:28] things not just by mechanics or
[57:31] intellectual but closer to your presence
[57:34] Lord let the congregation see a deeper
[57:38] walk with God in the pastor
[57:42] let the congregation let my children
[57:46] I know Lord they respect me and those
[57:49] things but Lord let my children and my
[57:52] wife see even a deeper walk and a closer
[57:56] walk with you

[58:00] the David had here let them see there's
[58:04] a man
[58:06] if he has one great love in life
[58:08] he loves the precepts and the words of
[58:12] God he loves it it is his obsession
[58:17] Granite father
[58:18] I may not be a success in money or other
[58:21] things
[58:22] but let me in this
[58:24] Journey with the success of my children
[58:28] being able to see the presence of the

[58:36] granted Lord
[58:38] and bless your people tonight as we

[58:42] we're thankful for the the steps that
[58:44] you can order in the word of God the our
[58:46] steps can be ordered every day because
[58:49] you give us what to walk in thank you
[58:51] Father thank you that you help us make
[58:54] it through the corn maze because of your
[58:56] Eagle's eye view
[58:58] thank you Lord for the posting signs of
[59:01] warning
[59:02] thank you when you send someone even the
[59:04] body of Christ and they give us a little
[59:06] warning thank you for those little
[59:07] things Lord so you're still speaking
[59:10] you're still watching over us you're
[59:12] still protecting us
[59:14] Lord we don't do these things to be mean
[59:17] and the convictions and things that we
[59:19] try to share with not only our youth but
[59:22] our sisters and brothers here Lord
[59:25] you didn't intend for those things to be
[59:28] trapping or putting the people in
[59:31] bondage that's not what your intention
[59:32] was
[59:33] and it's certainly not my intention
[59:35] either Lord they'll never let the enemy
[59:37] tell that to the people in congregation
[59:39] here
[59:40] or may they see my heart that I'm
[59:42] echoing and saying again what the spoken
[59:46] word has said putting it up before the
[59:48] people and we know as Paul taught us
[59:51] Lord if we keep beholding and looking at
[59:54] that into that law of life and into that
[59:58] word where chains Lord our countenances
[1:00:01] change our life has changed just by
[1:00:04] continuing to be looking at it and
[1:00:06] beholding it Lord
[1:00:10] because Lord You're Beautiful
[1:00:13] your face is all I see
[1:00:18] when your eyes are on this child
[1:00:22] your grace
[1:00:24] Your Grace abounds in me
