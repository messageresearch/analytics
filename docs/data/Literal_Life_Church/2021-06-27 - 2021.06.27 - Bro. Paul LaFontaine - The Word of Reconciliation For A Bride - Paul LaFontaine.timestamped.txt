[0:00] section of scripture the last few weeks
[0:02] and
[0:03] we would like to read from it again
[0:05] second corinthians chapter 5
[0:07] and verse 19 and verse 20.
[0:13] second corinthians 5 verse 19 and verse
[0:17] 20
[0:18] to wit that god was in christ
[0:21] reconciling the word the world unto
[0:24] himself
[0:26] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[0:30] and hath committed unto us the word
[0:33] of reconciliation everybody saved the
[0:35] word of reconciliation
[0:37] [Music]
[0:40] the word of reconciliation
[0:43] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[0:46] as though god did beseech you by us
[0:50] we pray you in christ said be ye
[0:53] reconciled to god so if you i'll bring
[0:56] you back to the theme here
[0:58] and that is god was in christ so there
[1:01] was a vessel on earth
[1:02] and through that vessel god was calling
[1:05] and reconciling
[1:06] his children to himself and then when
[1:09] christ finished his work and
[1:11] resurrected and sent back the holy
[1:13] spirit then paul's putting them himself
[1:16] in the place
[1:16] in christ's stead now that the work of
[1:19] reconciliation is going on but it's
[1:21] going on through
[1:22] paul and he's preaching and he says i
[1:25] have this ministry of reconciliation you
[1:27] have it
[1:28] and it's called the word of
[1:29] reconciliation reconciliation in other
[1:32] words
[1:32] the word that i'm preaching is not just
[1:34] a sermon
[1:36] it's the father calling his children
[1:40] can you say amen it's the father calling
[1:43] his children
[1:44] it's the father being reconciled with
[1:46] his children again so that's what's
[1:48] happening
[1:48] and we want to speak today a little bit
[1:50] on the word of reconciliation for the
[1:52] bride
[1:53] heavenly father we just pray that you'll
[1:55] bless this word and
[1:57] lord the two songs that were sung and
[1:59] the worship that today
[2:00] has been such a joy in our hearts and
[2:03] lord
[2:03] good music anointed of you
[2:06] has the power to drive away evil spirits
[2:10] it has the power to refresh our spirits
[2:13] like when david came before
[2:14] saul and his spirit was refreshed lord
[2:18] we're thankful for that and the two
[2:19] songs we heard
[2:20] has already preached a sermon to us as
[2:22] it were and so we're rejoicing in that
[2:24] father
[2:25] we pray that you'll just get in your
[2:27] word now and minister to your people
[2:29] and father we're thankful that you have
[2:30] just pray brought all these precious
[2:32] visitors with us today

[2:36] traveling mercies lord on their trips
[2:38] and we just commit the whole day to you
[2:40] we're thankful we want to say thank you
[2:42] lord for
[2:43] your anointing coming down last night
[2:45] lord in such a special way
[2:47] brother rap speaking there lord and we
[2:49] know your presence just come lord and
[2:51] made yourself
[2:52] known in front of those children lord
[2:55] may it never get away from them lord
[2:57] that
[2:57] that different feeling that they felt
[3:00] when you come in the room lord
[3:01] and there's just something special may
[3:04] never leave them i pray
[3:05] god may they be drawn to you whether
[3:07] wherever they went today whatever
[3:09] situations they're in
[3:10] parents and different things may it just
[3:13] draw their hearts lord and find them one
[3:15] day
[3:15] and bring them back to you we just
[3:17] commit them to you all those lives
[3:19] precious to you lord and we commit the
[3:21] day to you now
[3:22] in jesus name amen god bless you once
[3:25] you shake somebody's hand
[3:26] just before you seated say god bless you
[3:29] and
[3:29] once again thank you for all the
[3:31] visitors that are here with us today i
[3:33] haven't even mentioned all of them but
[3:35] melodies in with the children and so
[3:38] many that grew up in our church that
[3:39] come back for
[3:40] kids days and such are just glad to have
[3:43] you
[3:43] you were in kids days yourself and then
[3:45] you bring back come back
[3:47] 10 20 years later with all of your kids
[3:50] the kids days so
[3:50] just families are growing amen and uh
[3:54] jared and betsy aren't here today but
[3:56] they have a new baby a new baby boy
[3:58] and so we're happy for what the lord has
[3:59] done for them
[4:01] amen so we want to uh
[4:04] just take a few moments this morning and
[4:06] speak on this subject again of
[4:08] reconciliation
[4:10] and um paul is standing with a word
[4:15] uh that is is not just to save people
[4:19] and not just to forgive people although
[4:22] it's a wonderful thing to know that when
[4:24] the word is preached
[4:25] then we realize it draws the people to
[4:27] repentance and if they'll repent
[4:29] then god can save that person salvation
[4:32] is a wonderful gift
[4:34] and we're thankful for that and when the
[4:35] word is preached and somebody responds
[4:37] there's repentance and then there's
[4:39] forgiveness
[4:41] but paul is preaching the ministry of
[4:44] reconciliation and he says we have
[4:47] the word of reconciliation what paul
[4:50] preached was more than just to bring
[4:52] someone to be saved
[4:54] but it was a complete restoration
[4:57] bringing sons and daughters of god back
[4:59] where they fell from
[5:01] before they fell in the garden in the
[5:03] garden
[5:04] man had a an unhindered relationship
[5:08] with the lord he'd come down in the cool
[5:10] of the evening
[5:11] there was no sin there was no hesitance
[5:13] there was no adam and eve feeling
[5:15] unworthy there was no hesitation
[5:19] it was complete comfortable peace and
[5:21] fellowship with the lord he'd come down
[5:23] they could speak to him openly about
[5:25] anything he could speak back to them
[5:28] and there was this unhindered oneness
[5:30] and unity
[5:31] with the with the father and his
[5:33] children there in the garden of eden but
[5:35] when sin came in that was all broke away
[5:37] and man become distant man become
[5:40] way far away uh uh and there was a chasm
[5:43] between them and god
[5:44] there wasn't grounds for that type of
[5:46] fellowship but i'm here to proclaim this
[5:48] morning that calvary has restored
[5:51] fellowship between sons again and the
[5:53] word of reconciliation is not
[5:55] just to save us when god gives us this
[5:58] word is to bring
[6:00] all that we lost from god and bring us
[6:02] back
[6:03] into a position in fellowship with god
[6:05] when god gives you his word it's not to
[6:08] bring you halfway
[6:10] god doesn't do anything halfway
[6:13] god does not save you to lose you god
[6:15] does not save you to say oh i made a
[6:17] mistake
[6:18] god does not draw you in in order for
[6:21] somehow you just to bring you halfway
[6:23] if you go halfway it's not god's fault
[6:26] it would be your fault that you only
[6:27] come halfway
[6:29] god's word is bringing you back to a
[6:31] complete
[6:32] reconciliation that there's unhindered
[6:34] fellowship with you and god
[6:37] and i want to talk about this morning
[6:39] several things that are related to that
[6:40] and hopefully
[6:41] one of the things maybe we'll minister
[6:43] to you and bring you along in your
[6:45] christian journey
[6:47] the word is not to take you so far but
[6:49] it's to bring you back completely into a
[6:51] relationship with christ
[6:53] that adam and eve had lost in the garden
[6:55] before
[6:56] the fall and fellowshipping with brother
[6:58] johnny green a little bit yesterday
[7:00] or uh friday we were just talking about
[7:02] this new generation
[7:04] and uh just the the new generation of
[7:06] ministers coming along
[7:08] and i stand amazed and he would say he
[7:10] stand amazed at at just
[7:12] where we're going and where this word is
[7:14] taking the people and we're rejoicing in
[7:17] the
[7:17] the quality of the brothers the purity
[7:20] and the untainted way that they're
[7:21] bringing the
[7:22] the bible and the message it's just been
[7:24] astounding to watch the new ministry
[7:27] rising up
[7:27] and it gives us great confidence to know
[7:30] that the future is bright can you say
[7:32] amen
[7:33] that god knows where the bride is at he
[7:36] knows what to speak to his bride
[7:38] and if we have several years before the
[7:40] rapture we don't know
[7:41] that we got confidence that if i'm out
[7:43] of the way someday
[7:44] god's word is going to take the people
[7:46] beyond and further
[7:47] even than where we're at today and i
[7:50] mentioned to him a quote you know uh
[7:53] if you guys want to bring it up in the
[7:54] back there it's in what is the holy
[7:55] ghost i mentioned to brother johnny this
[7:57] quote
[7:58] and i was saying to him we see things
[8:00] advancing and it's because of the nature
[8:02] of the kind of word
[8:04] through the message that we're under
[8:06] it's not the kind of word that is given
[8:07] that just fizzles out
[8:09] it's not a word that becomes a
[8:11] denomination
[8:12] it's not a word that just goes in a
[8:14] revival and after 450 years
[8:16] it fizzles out somewhere this is not
[8:18] that kind of word
[8:19] this is a word that keeps advancing and
[8:22] advancing and advancing
[8:24] and taking us beyond what we were last
[8:27] year
[8:27] beyond what we were 10 years ago
[8:31] it's just short quote but brother
[8:33] branham says it this way i love this
[8:35] quote
[8:35] especially speaking to youth conventions
[8:37] and such that we do
[8:38] luther walked in one light wesley walked
[8:41] in another
[8:42] well excuse me wesley walked in one
[8:44] light pentecost walked in another
[8:46] but we're walking on higher than that
[8:49] today this is 1959
[8:51] we're walking in a higher light than
[8:52] pentecost
[8:55] and if there's another generation it'll
[8:58] go beyond us
[9:00] [Applause]
[9:02] praise the lord that shows us that
[9:05] there's a word
[9:06] that's never ending to take us on
[9:08] further can you say amen
[9:10] i quoted something to brother johnny
[9:11] that brother eugene braun said to me he
[9:13] says
[9:13] i'm training my young men and mentoring
[9:16] my young man
[9:16] the ministers and all the young men that
[9:19] someday they can take the people with
[9:21] their gift and the word
[9:22] they can take the people further when
[9:25] i'm gone
[9:25] than what i could take them they can
[9:27] take them further i've never heard a
[9:29] minister say that
[9:30] a lot of times older ministers it stops
[9:32] with them it's over with me
[9:34] they hold on to the congregation hold on
[9:36] it's all about me
[9:37] that's not this type of word when i'm
[9:39] when i kick the bucket someday
[9:41] and we're still here this word will take
[9:44] this congregation and this bride
[9:46] on to know him in a greater way
[9:52] because of the blessing of how powerful
[9:55] this word of reconciliation really is if
[9:58] i could just preach that and get you to
[9:59] see it
[10:00] do you realize the magnitude of the kind
[10:03] of word that we're
[10:04] under this isn't just church
[10:07] this isn't a denomination we have been
[10:11] given the word
[10:12] of reconciliation and it'll bring back
[10:16] every son and daughter of god back to
[10:18] their position as sons again
[10:21] blessed be his name so we have a word
[10:24] that is to bring souls back into
[10:26] fellowship to god's thoughts of them
[10:28] and when he says we have this ministry
[10:31] of reconciliation
[10:33] be reconciled to god we have a word of
[10:36] reconciliation
[10:37] it's not just to bring people so that
[10:39] they'll be saved and that's still going
[10:41] on and we will always see that go on
[10:43] but it's actually a word to bring them
[10:45] further than salvation
[10:47] and to bring them back into fellowship
[10:50] with the thoughts that god had about
[10:53] them
[10:53] before the foundation of the world do
[10:56] you realize this morning that we've
[10:58] through this word tapped into the very
[11:00] thoughts god had
[11:01] before the foundation of the world god's
[11:03] thoughts that he had of you
[11:05] that we have been able to tap into what
[11:07] god was thinking of you
[11:08] before the foundation of the law first
[11:10] of all you were in god's thoughts before
[11:12] the foundation of the world
[11:14] that's a blessing in itself if you're a
[11:17] christian you were in his thoughts
[11:20] but what thoughts did he have of you
[11:24] what was he thinking of you what purpose
[11:26] did he have in this age for you
[11:28] god's already thought it through yes sir
[11:31] god already knew
[11:32] and to think that the word that i
[11:35] preached and that's been bought brought
[11:36] through the message
[11:37] can tap sons of god into the very
[11:40] thoughts that god had for them that's
[11:43] pretty powerful
[11:46] not preaching a sermon and we're just
[11:48] bringing the people just so far along
[11:50] no it's deeper than that it's much
[11:53] deeper than that and that's why we said
[11:54] last sunday
[11:55] to reconcile and i heard a minister
[11:58] teach this a few years ago
[11:59] his brother tim dodd who did even
[12:01] teaching at the men's meeting
[12:03] and i may refer a little bit to that i
[12:05] was looking over my notes yesterday
[12:06] i may refer to it because it was so
[12:08] powerful i never knew this
[12:10] but reconciling and he read this
[12:12] scripture to the word of reconciliation
[12:15] reconcile is a deeper uh relationship
[12:19] or a coming back it's deeper than
[12:21] repentance
[12:22] and it's deeper than forgiveness
[12:27] i thought about that that's amazing
[12:29] because god's blessed us with
[12:30] forgiveness
[12:31] and when we repent well we can't even
[12:34] repent until we're led to repent
[12:36] it's god that leads you to repentance he
[12:39] leads you to repentance
[12:41] then he forgives you and all these
[12:43] things are great things that we enjoy
[12:45] but reconcile when he says the word of
[12:47] reconciliation
[12:48] is to go deeper than just being forgiven
[12:50] because somebody
[12:51] can repent somebody can say i'm sorry
[12:54] and somebody can be forgiven but the
[12:57] relationship isn't restored yet
[13:00] how many is that okay let's how many had
[13:02] that happened in your life
[13:04] when there's a sorry done but there's no
[13:06] reconciliation of the relationship
[13:09] the worst case of it when we're raising
[13:11] kids and one sibling does something to
[13:13] the other
[13:14] and you make them go say sorry because
[13:16] you're trying to tell
[13:17] you're trying to teach them to say sorry
[13:19] and to repent of what they'd done wrong
[13:20] you just went over and bashed your
[13:21] brother's head
[13:22] or you tripped them and they fell down
[13:24] and so you need to go say sorry well
[13:26] they don't want to do it there's nothing
[13:27] in their
[13:27] heart to go say sorry so you're teaching
[13:30] them so it's all mechanical but you're
[13:32] trying to teach them anyway how many has
[13:33] ever had those
[13:34] emotionless cold
[13:38] sorries from your kids
[13:41] and you want so much to get it from
[13:42] their heart but you're teaching so it's
[13:44] all mechanical
[13:45] it's all in the head and the last thing
[13:47] they want to do my mom made me do that
[13:49] one time my mom's here today
[13:50] and i did something wrong to sharon and
[13:52] we were fighting and bickering back and
[13:54] forth i know you'd never believe that
[13:55] sharon my my sister and i
[13:57] but uh we still still do it every now
[13:59] and then but anyway
[14:01] we we had a big fight and mom did did
[14:03] not tolerate
[14:04] fighting and treating one another wrong
[14:07] because she came from a home
[14:08] and i don't know i'm sure she don't mind
[14:10] me saying this but she came for a home
[14:12] with a lot of fussing
[14:13] a lot of stewing a lot of treating each
[14:14] other bad and and fighting and things
[14:16] she can't see that she had no tolerance
[14:18] for it so the things that she
[14:19] disciplined us with
[14:21] when there was just fussing going on and
[14:22] treating what i mean we don't want to
[14:24] talk about it i mean she really got into
[14:26] it
[14:27] but one day i remember distinctly she
[14:29] must have got tired of the i'm sorry
[14:32] and she made me kiss my sister on her
[14:34] cheek
[14:38] i mean she's going to extreme measures
[14:40] because there is no brother
[14:42] that is gonna kiss his sister you talk
[14:45] about the grossest thing you could ever
[14:47] come up with
[14:56] awkward more than awkward just
[15:00] gross mom i'll kiss you
[15:03] but not my sister but it's these extreme
[15:07] measures to get the point across
[15:09] and it worked because you realize but
[15:11] you see these motionless
[15:13] cold things and then when you get it
[15:14] from adults it's even sad can you
[15:17] it's even more sad because it's i'm
[15:18] sorry so you tell you say sorry to her
[15:20] stay sorry
[15:21] i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
[15:24] well that's real sincere i'm sorry
[15:30] we know it's got to be deeper than that
[15:33] but then when someone comes to the lord
[15:35] or someone comes in a repentance you can
[15:37] repent
[15:38] but there's not a reconciliation of the
[15:41] position
[15:42] and the relationship again and this word
[15:45] has the power in it not just to bring
[15:47] you to repentance
[15:49] and god forgiving you that this message
[15:51] is so much more than that
[15:54] matter of fact i'll just say safely the
[15:56] almost the entire church world
[15:58] in christianity can only bring people to
[16:00] that certain thing billy graham was
[16:02] gifted at it he could bring that
[16:04] audience a whole stadium
[16:05] to a sincere repentance in god and i
[16:08] thank god for it
[16:09] and i would never ditch that and say
[16:10] it's wrong it's wonderful
[16:12] we need repentance we need holy spirit
[16:15] repentance and forgiveness
[16:17] but this word is not just to get you to
[16:19] repent and then you just go on living
[16:21] life without a relationship with the
[16:23] lord
[16:23] this is the power to bring you back
[16:26] into the position you fell from and
[16:29] that's unhindered
[16:30] fellowship with the father
[16:34] reconciliation is a a stronger word than
[16:37] forgiveness
[16:38] or repentance not to minimize these
[16:41] things
[16:42] we have to have repentance and
[16:43] forgiveness to have a start
[16:45] to relationships to get back in
[16:47] relationship but it only goes so far
[16:50] far the church world may preach parts of
[16:52] the word and they led to repentance and
[16:54] forgiveness and it's wonderful
[16:55] but but but there's more to it than this
[16:58] this is a complete work to bring
[17:00] sons back to glory this is a positioning
[17:03] message
[17:03] this is an adoption message and if you
[17:06] understand adoption
[17:07] that's not just that you're birthed into
[17:09] the kingdom but you come to your
[17:11] position as a son
[17:12] that you're trusted by the father this
[17:15] is a word of reconciliation this is a
[17:17] message
[17:18] of adoption and position
[17:21] you're under that this is the opening of
[17:23] the book of redemption
[17:25] amen and thus if it's the opening of the
[17:28] book of redemption
[17:29] there's power in it to put you back into
[17:32] the place again
[17:33] as you were in his mind before the
[17:36] foundation of the world
[17:39] now the bible says that we are i've read
[17:42] these scriptures in the last few weeks
[17:43] we were far off we're referred to as
[17:47] aliens we're referred to as strangers
[17:51] estranged from god we're referred to
[17:54] as as being enemies of god if you're not
[17:57] in relationship with god then the peace
[17:59] is lost
[18:00] we're referred to as enemies of god
[18:02] before we have the lord in our lives
[18:03] we're an enemy of god
[18:05] if we love the world then we're enemies
[18:07] with god
[18:08] you never see yourself as that but when
[18:10] if we don't have the lord we're just
[18:11] working against the lord
[18:14] and so we're referred to these things
[18:16] and then his love and his power and his
[18:18] grace comes in our lives
[18:19] and his power goes out to call you and
[18:22] to bring you
[18:23] out of this uh uh aliens and strangers
[18:27] and afar
[18:28] off back into a relationship with him
[18:30] that you're invited into his house
[18:33] that's a special thing to be invited
[18:34] into his house
[18:36] and then i'm going to take it further
[18:37] today that if you have the term bride
[18:39] and bridegroom
[18:40] you're not just invited into his house
[18:42] but you're invited into a special
[18:45] intimate relationship spiritually into
[18:47] the bed chamber with
[18:49] christ as it were and and i just say
[18:51] that because the bible refers to
[18:53] when you talk about a bride and
[18:54] bridegroom that is one of the most
[18:56] intimate close relationships on the face
[18:58] of the earth or at least should be
[19:01] and this is the term he begins using
[19:03] spiritually in our lives
[19:05] bride bridegroom you're not just invited
[19:08] in the church
[19:08] you're not just invited into his house
[19:11] but you're invited in to share a close
[19:13] relationship with him
[19:16] not a distant relationship not friends
[19:19] of the couple
[19:21] but the couple
[19:25] so when he reconciled
[19:28] whenever you have reconciliation you
[19:29] have an atonement that price has to be
[19:30] paid
[19:31] and he paid the price to bring us back
[19:33] into reconciliation again
[19:35] and the power to pull us back all the
[19:37] way not just halfway
[19:38] to bring us back all the way not just to
[19:41] an altar
[19:42] of repentance but actually the bible
[19:44] refers to us to be seated
[19:47] in heavenly places with christ
[19:52] now that's friends that's not inviting
[19:54] you to come into his house
[19:56] and to repent and to be forgiven
[19:59] that's a that's a position to be seated
[20:02] together
[20:03] with him in heavenly places and the
[20:06] prophet taught us
[20:07] that's not someday i know i'm going to
[20:09] heaven someday that's now it's the
[20:11] believer's position in christ
[20:13] that we are reconciled not just to a
[20:16] place of salvation and repentance
[20:17] but we're reconciled to sit in heavenly
[20:20] places
[20:22] with christ now
[20:26] talk about a power of reconciliation
[20:28] question is are you there today
[20:31] oh now we're going to be the evangelist
[20:32] and be convicting
[20:34] where are you at you've been some of you
[20:36] sent out this message for years
[20:37] where are you at in your relationship
[20:39] with jesus christ
[20:42] well i've been in the message for years
[20:44] you know i've got the eagle belt buckle
[20:45] i've got the whole deal those
[20:48] you know that's that's not pertinent
[20:49] anymore i don't think it ever was but
[20:51] it's not pertinent anymore
[20:54] where are you if this message is to
[20:56] restore us back to complete relationship
[20:58] with jesus christ
[20:59] on an everyday basis where are you at in
[21:01] your relationship with him
[21:03] are you still afar off and going and
[21:05] believing the message
[21:08] it's okay i'm prepared for you to get
[21:09] quiet
[21:12] where are you at in your relationship on
[21:14] a scale of one to ten where are you at
[21:15] today
[21:18] only you can answer that question in
[21:20] your relationship with the lord where
[21:21] are you at
[21:22] from one to ten i might start asking
[21:25] that personally to you
[21:26] because i'm the pastor and i want to get
[21:28] you from a 3 to a 10.
[21:31] i want to get you this 7 to a 10. if
[21:33] you're at 9 i'm not going to stop
[21:35] preaching to you i'm going to get you
[21:36] from a 9 to a 10.
[21:38] why because the word says we can be
[21:41] there
[21:42] there isn't anything holding that back
[21:44] calvary has
[21:45] purchased the full price for you to be
[21:48] completely
[21:49] reconciled and fellowship with him
[21:54] and you say oh i just don't feel worthy
[21:56] well i'm going to deal with that today i
[21:58] don't feel worthy to be there it's not
[21:59] your worthiness it's the price he paid
[22:01] at the cross
[22:02] and that price was fully paid and that
[22:05] price
[22:05] brings you complete if you'll respond it
[22:08] brings you back into heavenly places
[22:10] with jesus christ
[22:12] not a far off that's right not
[22:15] strangers no longer strangers no longer
[22:20] alienated away aliens i don't even like
[22:22] those terms
[22:23] i don't like to be alien has a bad term
[22:25] today especially
[22:26] i don't like the bible calls me an alien
[22:28] before god i don't want to be called an
[22:30] alien
[22:31] i know i'm weird but i don't want to be
[22:33] called that anymore
[22:35] but no longer will we have these these
[22:38] terms but to be brought back
[22:40] into it would be like an example
[22:43] of someone being a way away
[22:47] afar off and wanting to address this
[22:50] we must see this we must see this or we
[22:53] will stop short
[22:54] of where the lord can take us
[22:58] so brother johnny uh
[23:01] slackly didn't know that his song would
[23:03] go with this example i want to give
[23:06] great example in the scripture of the
[23:07] prodigal son that he sang about
[23:10] so we find that
[23:14] uh the prodigal son been preached about
[23:16] a lot
[23:17] but there's so much in there about
[23:18] predestination
[23:20] he was always a son can you say amen got
[23:23] away from the father
[23:25] and so this is predestination people
[23:27] look people preach it sometimes that
[23:29] they have a wayward son
[23:30] and it's a prodigal son coming back to
[23:32] them that's fine that's true
[23:34] but it's a deeper meaning jesus is
[23:37] preaching
[23:37] predestination jesus is preaching what
[23:40] we should already know
[23:42] let me get simple for you okay my four
[23:45] children are here today
[23:47] there was a day that we didn't know them
[23:48] my wife and i didn't know them
[23:50] but they were in me in seed form
[23:54] through the betting round of marriage
[23:56] now today i can fellowship with my sons
[23:59] and my daughters i can see them i can
[24:01] have fellow i can have them over
[24:03] and talk to them i can hug them like i
[24:05] just did my daughter when i came up
[24:07] i can fellowship but before i couldn't
[24:08] do that but they were always in me if
[24:10] that's true
[24:11] if with you naturally it's true with you
[24:14] spiritually if you're a christian today
[24:17] you were
[24:18] always in the mind of the father you
[24:20] were in him
[24:23] redemption is not just getting something
[24:25] brand new
[24:26] redemption is to bring you back from
[24:28] what you were in the beginning
[24:33] so let's take the prodigal son a minute
[24:35] solomon
[24:37] come up here a minute if you would so
[24:39] solomon i want you to go afar off like
[24:42] the prodigal son was all right
[24:43] i want you to go far off once you go
[24:45] back to the back of the church
[24:47] go run run away no running in the church
[24:50] okay he's reminding me
[24:51] all right unless you're shouting
[24:57] go as far as you can go go up in the
[24:59] balcony i want you to go afar
[25:01] off okay and this is what happened with
[25:03] the prodigal son and
[25:04] what happens with us this is this is our
[25:07] life story
[25:08] all of us without god and you were so
[25:11] far away there was no fellowship with
[25:14] father and
[25:15] and you were so afar off and it didn't
[25:18] seem like being that far away that you
[25:20] could come back again
[25:21] i want to make a point again today i
[25:23] want you to catch something there's
[25:24] something in the prodigal son
[25:26] story that we we don't want to miss and
[25:28] that is
[25:29] that uh the prodigal son had a mindset
[25:33] as soon as he started to come to himself
[25:35] he had a mindset
[25:37] that said i'm thinking i'm going to go
[25:40] back to the father
[25:42] i was a son but i i'm unworthy to be a
[25:45] son still
[25:46] so in his mind if i could just come back
[25:49] and enter and just be a servant
[25:52] or just work or just get some food and i
[25:56] want you to just notice that now when we
[25:57] come back
[25:58] a lot of times we only have a certain
[26:00] place that we want to come to
[26:02] you know when we come to god we have
[26:03] needs and we're coming to god for a
[26:04] reason
[26:05] sometimes tragedy can drive people to
[26:07] god so we all have reasons why we come
[26:09] to him maybe you're hungry maybe
[26:10] you're spiritually hungry we come for
[26:13] different reasons so
[26:13] we come and god provides that but we
[26:16] have to remember
[26:17] that this is a word of reconciliation to
[26:19] take you completely back
[26:21] to all that you lost not just to
[26:23] repentance
[26:24] and he's saying if i could just come
[26:25] back and if i could just repent of what
[26:27] i've done
[26:28] then maybe there'll be a job for me in
[26:30] the estate
[26:31] where i can be a servant that's his
[26:33] mentality
[26:35] that's it so as the song sang this
[26:37] morning it wasn't that solomon started
[26:39] to come back
[26:40] it was that the father when he seen him
[26:43] afar
[26:43] off he began to run
[26:47] towards oh i might have to sing yet
[26:50] again johnny
[26:52] he ran to us he didn't wait
[26:56] and say i'll see if he runs to me let's
[26:58] see how serious
[26:59] he is about things the father soon as he
[27:03] see him
[27:04] he ran to him right some i'm going to
[27:06] run in the church
[27:07] because i'm the pastor and i can
[27:12] son come come to me son come to me
[27:15] i bet your cameras can't get over here
[27:19] come on
[27:24] we better get out here in front of the
[27:25] video
[27:33] thank you cameras coming i love you
[27:40] come on
[27:49] he has an unworthy uh mindset so
[27:52] he's just already thought this is only
[27:55] only going to go so far
[27:56] and he's happy just to become a servant
[27:59] he's happy to come
[28:00] and be right here at the altar and his
[28:03] father
[28:04] he's going to repent at this altar and
[28:06] his father goes back up into his
[28:08] position
[28:10] and he's standing over him he's thankful
[28:12] he's repenting
[28:13] this is all wonderful but in his mindset
[28:16] that's
[28:16] all the further he goes
[28:20] but this is a word of complete
[28:21] reconciliation
[28:23] and he's a son he's my son
[28:28] if he's my son he can never
[28:31] stay in the category of a servant
[28:36] he may try to keep himself there in his
[28:39] humility
[28:40] but there is no way that the father is
[28:42] going to leave a son in a category of
[28:44] servant
[28:45] when he's predestinated to be restored
[28:48] completely back
[28:49] to his position again so
[28:53] you know he's he's staying in that thing
[28:56] but the father says no no no no i wanna
[29:00] i want you restored back i want you to
[29:02] be back in fellowship
[29:04] just doing some uh furniture rearranging
[29:07] here this morning
[29:08] you're all gonna think i'm crazy
[29:12] so this is the father this is where he
[29:14] is okay
[29:16] and he said no son i am glad to have you
[29:19] back
[29:20] you you're not a servant you're my son
[29:26] i want you back in fellowship i want you
[29:29] back in your position
[29:30] completely sit here with me and we'll
[29:33] have some fellowship together
[29:36] this is your christian walk it's not
[29:39] just repentance
[29:40] it's back with unhindered fellowship
[29:42] with the father because you are a son
[29:46] amen so then
[29:49] he says he goes beyond he's happy
[29:53] he's happy he's already happy he said i
[29:55] didn't deserve any of this
[29:57] i don't deserve any of this dad but he
[29:59] says
[30:00] let's have a celebration let's get my
[30:03] robe
[30:04] son this is my robe i'm so glad to have
[30:07] you back

[31:08] calf
[31:10] my son has come back home to me
[31:14] amen this word
[31:18] is not just a word to bring you to
[31:20] repentance your christian walk
[31:21] you came to the message 10 years ago you
[31:23] came to the message 20 years ago
[31:25] where are you at today where's your
[31:28] fellowship with the father
[31:30] it's not just to get your dress all
[31:32] right and you're wearing the right
[31:33] dresses and
[31:34] you have your devotion every day it's
[31:36] called fellowship it's called being
[31:38] completely
[31:39] sitting in the father's house
[31:43] back into fellowship with him and nobody
[31:46] can keep you from that fellowship not
[31:49] even the older brother the older brother
[31:51] was resentful about this i've been
[31:53] sitting around here working for years
[31:54] this guy comes back he's spoiled every
[31:56] event of inheritance he's done all this
[31:58] other stuff
[31:58] he gets this position back again just
[32:01] like that
[32:02] yes he does so the servants made fun of
[32:05] him
[32:05] his elder brother made fun of him people
[32:07] wait make fun of you
[32:10] but god has called you to a relationship
[32:12] teenagers god's called you to a
[32:14] relationship
[32:16] not a religion not smearing the message
[32:19] on the outside
[32:21] where are you at in that relationship
[32:22] today it's you and him personally
[32:24] exclusive
[32:25] together can you say that
[32:29] i love you bud it's good to be back in
[32:31] fellowship with you again
[32:32] amen you better take that and put it in
[32:34] the freezer out back
[32:36] let's give them a hand
[32:44] [Applause]
[32:51] anybody ever heard the story of the
[32:54] talking about value anybody heard the
[32:57] story of
[32:59] the uh
[33:03] the man that went on the island in the
[33:04] pacific and
[33:06] wanted this wife and i'm only
[33:10] saying this because some of the older
[33:11] ones know it but the younger ones may
[33:12] not know it
[33:14] and on an island in the pacific lived a
[33:16] woman named sarita
[33:19] who on the other islanders agreed was
[33:20] quite plain and lacked any of the social
[33:22] graces expected of women on the island
[33:24] she was in the eyes of the islanders and
[33:26] even her own father not likely to marry
[33:28] because he was a woman
[33:29] without worth then one day a man named
[33:32] johnny lingo
[33:33] isn't that interesting his name is
[33:35] johnny we have somebody johnny's here
[33:36] today
[33:36] johnny lingo appeared and offered her
[33:38] father the unheard sum of eight
[33:40] cows to marry sarita the islanders were
[33:43] shocked because no one had ever paid
[33:44] more than five or six
[33:46] cows for a wife not even the most
[33:49] valuable woman of the island got more
[33:51] than six cows
[33:54] johnny however paid the eight cows and
[33:56] took his new wife home to his own island
[33:58] months later a visitor to the islands
[34:00] heard the story of john lingle and his
[34:01] eight cow wife
[34:02] and decided to visit the couple to find
[34:03] out why johnny would pay such a high
[34:05] price
[34:06] for a woman viewed as having little or
[34:07] no value and to his surprise he met
[34:10] sarita
[34:10] and found her to be stunningly beautiful
[34:13] and one of the most
[34:14] graceful woman he had ever seen confused
[34:16] he asked johnny why his wife seemed to
[34:18] be
[34:18] so different than the other island women
[34:21] had described to him
[34:22] johnny's answer was simple the change
[34:24] happened the change in her took place
[34:26] was because i have an eight cow
[34:30] wife and i paid eight cows for her and
[34:32] when she
[34:33] knew that she was of that value she
[34:35] started to act
[34:36] like an eight cow wife
[34:38] [Applause]
[34:41] jesus christ has paid the ultimate price
[34:44] for you can you say amen and you have to
[34:46] know
[34:47] how valued you are can you say man
[34:52] yes sir how many of you husbands have a
[34:56] eight cow wife raise your hand very good
[34:59] very good
[35:04] praise the lord
[35:07] so let me go into this just a little
[35:09] different way if you got time this
[35:10] morning
[35:11] it was a husband and a wife
[35:14] at the beginning that
[35:18] relationship of husband and wife becomes
[35:20] the ultimate one
[35:22] in the end spiritually because we know
[35:25] there was a first adam
[35:26] there was a first eve and then jesus
[35:28] christ is referred to the second adam
[35:30] through redemption and we're referred to
[35:32] as the second eve
[35:34] so what happened back there in that
[35:35] marriage was a type and shadow of what
[35:37] god was going to do spiritually
[35:39] and that there would be a relationship
[35:41] at the end in revelations
[35:43] called the marriage supper of the lamb
[35:45] the bride the lamb's wife has
[35:47] made herself ready the beginning of the
[35:50] book
[35:51] talks about a marriage husband and wife
[35:53] relationship not
[35:54] an uncle and aunt not family not sisters
[35:57] not
[35:58] no it's a husband and wife which is the
[36:00] most intimate
[36:01] close exclusive relationship
[36:04] and the bible starts with a marriage and
[36:07] the bible ends
[36:09] with that type of relationship not
[36:11] servants
[36:12] not slaves can you say man it doesn't
[36:16] say at the end the slaves have made
[36:18] themselves ready for their master
[36:20] it speaks of this relationship of a
[36:24] bride
[36:28] and so now you have a picture of that
[36:30] husband and wife at the beginning
[36:31] the bride the bridegroom speaks of a
[36:33] close intimate relationship and
[36:35] fellowship
[36:36] not shared with anyone else it's
[36:40] exclusive
[36:41] it is a fellowship and a relationship
[36:44] like
[36:44] no other it is special
[36:47] or i should say it it should be
[36:51] special let me take a moment to say that
[36:54] the world
[36:55] has cheapened the exclusive
[36:59] relationship of husband and wife bride
[37:02] and bridegroom
[37:03] the world has cheapened marriage the
[37:06] world has
[37:07] cheapened sex that is meant to be only
[37:10] in a marriage
[37:15] the world has cheapened even those
[37:19] terms of husband and wife they don't
[37:21] even have
[37:22] bride and bridegroom they don't have the
[37:24] commitment anymore
[37:25] they don't have the value to them
[37:27] anymore people are already doing
[37:28] prenuptial agreements before they're
[37:30] even married
[37:31] they don't have the commitment so satan
[37:34] has taken that very term that's supposed
[37:36] to be an exclusive
[37:38] unadulterous relationship only an
[37:40] intimate that's only shared between the
[37:42] two of you
[37:42] and satan has even taken those terms and
[37:45] watered them down
[37:48] but god hasn't done that it's still an
[37:50] exclusive relationship
[37:52] it should be a special relationship and
[37:55] this is what we teach young people here
[37:56] and we're going to remind you of it
[37:58] young people here in our church
[38:00] that the world has cheapened things that
[38:02] are meant to be special
[38:04] an intimacy of touching a woman or
[38:06] touching a man
[38:08] or in any way intimately is to be
[38:11] reserved for one place
[38:13] one place and one place only and that's
[38:15] within a marriage vow
[38:19] and you're not to touch a woman or a man
[38:22] not to talk to a woman not to touch a
[38:24] man
[38:24] to kiss before marriage to touch one
[38:26] another in an intimate way before
[38:28] marriage
[38:28] they're not to do that until they made
[38:31] the commitment of marriage why
[38:33] because god allows certain special
[38:35] things
[38:36] to be only in an exclusive hidden
[38:39] quiet relationship between husband and
[38:42] wife
[38:43] after they are married now you look at
[38:46] my world and you can see that's all
[38:47] messed up now
[38:49] and i teach our young people that dating
[38:51] come along in the 19
[38:53] 20 30 right about the time we got cars
[38:55] is when we had the term dating come
[38:57] along
[38:58] and dating come along every since before
[39:00] that was called courtship
[39:02] and courtship was something that the guy
[39:03] was interested in the girl he came over
[39:05] and visited the girl at the at the
[39:07] family's house and so he didn't have a
[39:09] choice
[39:09] if he wanted time with that girl he was
[39:11] around the family so
[39:13] it was there's a book that i you can
[39:14] read it was written years ago
[39:16] from the front porch to the back seat of
[39:18] the car that's when dating changed from
[39:20] around the family in open area
[39:22] it changed from the front porch sitting
[39:24] on the front porch and maybe maybe you
[39:26] could get the dad and the mom and
[39:27] everybody and the siblings
[39:29] to get out of there a while so you could
[39:30] talk to her privately
[39:33] but that's where it all mostly happened
[39:36] but when the car came along and a guy
[39:37] got a car
[39:38] then they took off out which which
[39:42] is is not necessarily wrong but what
[39:44] they're saying it made a big transition
[39:45] on our country
[39:46] because it changed from just this thing
[39:49] of going out and having
[39:51] marriage relations and petting and doing
[39:54] all these things
[39:56] that belong to head towards a marriage
[39:59] type intimacy
[40:01] am i am i being general enough and plain
[40:03] enough at the same time
[40:06] it all changed so we try to teach
[40:08] younger teens especially
[40:10] but all young people to be mindful
[40:13] of your hormones and to be mindful of
[40:16] how god's made you
[40:17] he's made you to be married he's made
[40:19] you to have intimacy with somebody
[40:21] but god has put it in a blessed place
[40:25] and it's called marriage it's within the
[40:28] world we got all kinds of partners and
[40:30] okay
[40:30] girlfriends and dating the dating game
[40:33] is that
[40:33] you share this intimacy with your heart
[40:36] with like 10 or 12 people by the time
[40:38] you get married
[40:39] god never intended for you to give your
[40:40] heart and your body to that many people
[40:46] god really has called you to be young
[40:49] guys
[40:50] a one one-woman man
[40:56] and he's called you girls to be a
[40:57] one-man
[40:59] woman now you're going to have
[41:02] friendships you're going to have
[41:03] affections for different ones and
[41:05] might take you a little while to figure
[41:07] out which one is the right one
[41:08] that's all fine you're going to have
[41:10] friendships
[41:12] but friendships is different
[41:15] talking and friendships and
[41:17] complementing one another
[41:18] all that's normal it's right i don't
[41:20] want to be the bad guy here to say it's
[41:22] it's abnormal to have attractions to the
[41:25] opposite sex and
[41:26] don't you dare have it if you don't have
[41:28] an attraction to the opposite sex
[41:30] you got a problem you're not
[41:33] normal i need to pray for you
[41:38] it is every bit normal to have an
[41:40] attraction to the opposite sex
[41:42] god put that thirst within you
[41:45] to have that kind of fellowship
[41:50] am i being good fellowship with
[41:54] a man or a woman but he intended it to
[41:57] be within the blessed place
[41:59] called marriage and whenever you take
[42:02] anything related to marriage intimacy
[42:06] outside of marriage and do it before or
[42:09] do these things over here
[42:10] you cheapen it
[42:14] you keeping it and god wants it to be
[42:17] special god wants it to be exclusive
[42:22] because of the world we live in we're
[42:24] thankful for the grace and the
[42:25] blood of jesus christ because there's a
[42:28] lot of people sitting here
[42:30] that did not know these things and
[42:31] sometimes knew them and overrode them
[42:34] and his grace has forgiven them their
[42:36] mistakes and they have great marriages
[42:38] today
[42:39] they have great families today god can
[42:42] forgive and wash you clean
[42:46] but i'm speaking to the ones who have
[42:49] the opportunity
[42:51] to keep it special to keep it real and
[42:54] i'm telling you young people
[42:55] keep it special keep it real hold your
[42:59] heart
[42:59] and hold your body until that day on the
[43:02] wedding day
[43:03] and after that that's where god says
[43:04] it's blessed the barrier
[43:06] the bible says the marriage bed is
[43:07] undefiled the marriage bed is undefiled
[43:10] not the dating bed
[43:11] not to be in college in bed with
[43:13] somebody that's not undefiled that's
[43:15] defiled but the marriage bed
[43:17] it's undefiled
[43:21] none of this is in my notes up there i
[43:23] don't even know what my notes say right
[43:24] now
[43:26] but i just want to make the point again
[43:28] that this
[43:29] marriage husband and wife this was to be
[43:32] special
[43:34] and i encourage young people to keep it
[43:36] special
[43:37] you're going to fall in love with
[43:39] somebody someday you might be in love
[43:41] right now i don't know
[43:43] but you are going to have an attraction
[43:45] and you're praying for the will of god
[43:47] you you do that we encourage you to just
[43:50] follow the lord
[43:51] and all that's going to happen and it's
[43:53] and it should happen according to his
[43:55] will
[43:56] all that is of god but when you're real
[43:59] young teens
[44:00] you tend to say i'm going to go date
[44:01] somebody then i might be dating somebody
[44:04] different next year and you just kind of
[44:05] play in the field a little bit
[44:07] we don't do that around here another
[44:09] thing we don't do around here is a lot
[44:10] of
[44:11] touching and hugging
[44:15] in the world and in certain churches
[44:19] it's become normal for everybody to hug
[44:21] one another
[44:22] it's an expression of love i understand
[44:24] that but we don't do a lot of that
[44:26] around here because
[44:28] because we like to have some boundaries
[44:30] because if we kept it going
[44:31] we'd be constantly hugging and we'd have
[44:33] husbands
[44:35] hugging bear hugs to another man's wife
[44:41] so it's it's it's about where it goes
[44:44] it might be all innocent to start but it
[44:46] doesn't stay innocent
[44:48] so for the married folks and for the
[44:50] younger folks and i'm saying this
[44:52] because we've had a little hugging going
[44:53] on lately
[44:54] we just don't want to bring that in here
[44:57] and you can shake that
[44:58] girl's hand and say god bless you
[45:02] say i'd like to talk to you a while you
[45:04] can you can
[45:05] stand out there and talk to her till 11
[45:08] 00 until we kick you out
[45:09] you can talk to her all you want to to
[45:12] get to know her
[45:13] and then later on you can ask the father
[45:15] can i talk come over and talk
[45:17] you can go over and talk to her and the
[45:18] father gives us permission you can go to
[45:20] and then eventually down the road you're
[45:22] going to go out for a nice coffee or
[45:25] something together the father gives
[45:26] permission
[45:27] you're going to do that it's all but all
[45:29] of that can happen
[45:30] so purely and so right without bringing
[45:33] in
[45:34] what belongs in marriage
[45:37] is that okay none of this is none of
[45:39] this is in my notes this is
[45:41] this is free this is all free
[45:45] but this is the way we teach it here it
[45:47] is good for a man
[45:50] first corinthians 7. some of you
[45:52] visitors aren't even going to come back
[45:53] ever again
[45:56] but we live in a world you know i got to
[45:58] be counter culture here
[46:00] i got to tell the truth first
[46:01] corinthians 7 says it's good for a man
[46:03] not to touch a woman
[46:06] keep your hands off until the ring is on
[46:09] the finger
[46:14] i'm talking about sexually it's all
[46:15] about things that lead to sex
[46:17] that's what i'm talking about keep your
[46:18] hands off and it's all right there in
[46:21] the bible
[46:22] black and white it's clear don't listen
[46:24] to the cultures
[46:25] and watch the way the culture culture's
[46:27] doing listen to the word of god
[46:30] can you say amen is that okay with
[46:31] everybody dating has keeping things to
[46:34] take the specialness out of
[46:35] so it's special marriage husband and
[46:37] wife should be kept that way it's
[46:38] wonderful i would
[46:40] you know i love marriage listen i love
[46:43] the closeness between me and my wife the
[46:45] intimacy that we have
[46:46] and fellowship together i wouldn't go
[46:49] back to single life for no money in the
[46:51] world
[46:52] i love it and hopefully she loves it
[46:58] it's great to be on this side
[47:01] i wouldn't go back to sing a life for
[47:03] nothing
[47:04] because it's a special relationship
[47:08] and god's going to give that to you
[47:09] young people someday
[47:11] wait until it's the right thing
[47:14] don't be in a hurry but wait till it's
[47:16] the right thing when it's the right
[47:17] thing
[47:18] go for it because it'll it'll be good
[47:22] it'll be good praise the lord
[47:25] so you know because the world has
[47:28] cheapened the word bride
[47:31] i don't think that we should let it
[47:33] become common among us as well
[47:35] amen because we've used it for years as
[47:39] a term the bride
[47:41] but it can lose its meaning and lose its
[47:43] close relationship that that means
[47:45] between you and christ
[47:47] the bride becomes the people that are a
[47:50] part of a movement for the last days
[47:55] i think about this last night it becomes
[47:58] also it becomes just those that are part
[48:01] of a movement
[48:02] part of the message it becomes only the
[48:04] ones that message conventions
[48:06] are the bride it's only
[48:09] message churches the bride because they
[48:12] got a message sign on the door
[48:13] that's the bride that's the only bride
[48:18] or i'm in the bride because i go to this
[48:21] church
[48:23] i say we cheapen the term bride
[48:32] i'm in the bride because i go to this
[48:33] church or i become i go to its camp
[48:35] meetings
[48:36] so bride becomes a pride
[48:41] instead of a relationship because i'm a
[48:45] part of this church that i must be bride
[48:47] i'm sorry my friend i'm here to tell you
[48:49] just because you go to a message church
[48:51] does not make you bride the bride is the
[48:53] term of an intimate relationship
[48:55] with christ that's going on just between
[48:57] you and christ
[48:59] it's not a convention it's not a camp
[49:00] meeting it's not a movement
[49:02] you're not in the bride because you go
[49:04] to a message church
[49:05] or you believe god sent a prophet you're
[49:07] not in the bride because of that
[49:09] you're in the bride because the blood of
[49:11] jesus christ has
[49:12] brought you into a marriage with the
[49:15] husband jesus
[49:16] christ and you're in that relationship
[49:18] every day
[49:19] let me say it to those that are
[49:21] listening around the world
[49:23] that's who the bride is it's the wife of
[49:25] the husband
[49:26] jesus christ the word
[49:30] it's not a church it's not a movement
[49:33] it's not a group of people i know it's a
[49:36] mini-member bride
[49:38] but it's a relationship and we should
[49:40] never forget that
[49:43] and if you're not in a relationship with
[49:44] this husband that i'm preaching
[49:46] every day you're not reaching the full
[49:49] potential of what this
[49:50] is if you're afar off there's something
[49:53] wrong
[49:56] is that okay to say see
[49:59] you're the bride because i want to
[50:00] remind you everybody it means you have a
[50:02] new birth
[50:03] it by his word and have been washed by
[50:05] the blood of the lamb
[50:06] and have come into personal intimate
[50:08] special relationship every day with him
[50:10] you live in his house you took on his
[50:12] name can you say a man
[50:14] a bride takes on her husband's name
[50:18] and that means you represent everything
[50:20] that he represents in the word
[50:22] you don't say i'm a confess christ and
[50:24] you go out here and live like the world
[50:26] no
[50:27] you take on the very name of jesus
[50:28] christ so everything you do
[50:30] and say and watch and listen to
[50:32] represents christ
[50:35] you are his wife and you represent him
[50:37] my wife today represents me
[50:39] everything that i preach everything that
[50:41] i stand for you'll see it reflected in
[50:43] her
[50:43] and the bride of christ what the word
[50:45] says she stands for
[50:47] and you'll be able to see it in her life
[50:50] she's not another woman she's not a
[50:52] harlot spiritually
[50:55] the book of revelation speaks about the
[50:57] mother church and it's harlots
[51:00] but the bride is not that harlot she has
[51:03] an intimate
[51:04] exclusive relationship with the husband
[51:06] jesus christ the word
[51:08] is that okay with everybody now god
[51:10] begins to refer to
[51:13] i hope you give me just another
[51:17] i'm just buying some time here because i
[51:20] can finish
[51:21] some of it next sunday so we're only 20
[51:23] minutes to one give me about 15 minutes
[51:27] praise the lord
[51:32] turn with me to isaiah 54. god begins to
[51:35] use the term husband and wife
[51:37] in isaiah 54 when his people have
[51:40] backslidden got away from him
[51:43] and they were his servants israel he was
[51:45] referred to as
[51:46] god referred to him as the the children
[51:49] of israel
[51:50] how many knows that he referred to them
[51:51] the children of israel
[51:53] all those throughout the old testament
[51:54] the children of israel
[51:57] but in isaiah 54 when restoration begins
[52:00] he has to really build up his people
[52:03] in speaking to them and referring to
[52:04] them and the relationship changes
[52:06] they're no longer going to be the
[52:07] children of israel
[52:09] but he's going to take on and it's the
[52:10] first time we begin to hear from god
[52:13] the term husband and wife referred to in
[52:15] a spiritual relationship with god
[52:18] isaiah 54 and verse 5 says
[52:21] for thy maker is thine husband the lord
[52:25] of hosts is his name
[52:26] and thy redeemer the holy one of israel
[52:29] the god of the whole earth shall be
[52:30] he be called for the lord hath so
[52:33] so notice what he says now i'm changing
[52:36] relationship with you now
[52:38] it's not just that you're my children
[52:40] and i'm your maker
[52:41] but now i want you to refer to me as
[52:44] thine husband
[52:46] for the lord hath called thee as a woman
[52:48] forsaken and grieved in spirit
[52:50] and a wife of youth when thou was
[52:52] refused saith the lord so now
[52:54] there was a marriage relationship he
[52:56] looked at but as a wife of the youth she
[52:58] rejected the lord the days of jeremiah
[53:00] prophesied you were going into captivity
[53:02] all these other things but isaiah speaks
[53:04] of the restoration
[53:05] the reconciliation and when she comes
[53:07] back he starts to use the term
[53:10] husband refer to me as husband for a
[53:12] small moment have i forsaken thee
[53:15] but with great mercies will i gather
[53:16] thee in a little wrath i hid my face
[53:19] from thee for a moment
[53:20] with everlasting kindness will i have
[53:22] mercy on thee say of the lord thy
[53:23] redeemer
[53:24] for this is as the waters of noah unto
[53:27] me for as i have sworn that the waters
[53:28] of noah should no more go over the earth
[53:30] so have i sworn that i would not be
[53:32] wroth with thee nor rebuke thee
[53:35] for the mountains shall depart so we'll
[53:37] just stop right there
[53:38] so i have sworn like i swore with no i
[53:40] won't destroy the earth by water anymore
[53:42] but now i'm swearing to to you that i
[53:45] will no longer
[53:46] be wrath with thee nor rebuke thee and
[53:49] then
[53:50] there's so much more there but i just
[53:51] want you to get the boy this is where he
[53:53] begins to refer to
[53:54] husband isaiah 62 just a few chapters
[53:57] over
[53:57] isaiah 62 and verse 1 for zion's sake
[54:00] will i not hold my peace
[54:02] and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest
[54:03] until their righteousness there
[54:05] or i go as a brightness and the
[54:08] salvation thereof as a lamp
[54:10] that burneth and the gentiles shall see
[54:12] thy righteousness in
[54:13] all kings thy glory and thou shalt be
[54:16] called by a new name which thy mouth of
[54:18] the lord shall name
[54:19] thou shalt also be a crown of glory in
[54:22] the hand of the lord and a royal diadem
[54:24] in the hand of god now
[54:25] we haven't heard much of this kind of
[54:27] language coming from god
[54:29] referring to his people royalty diadem
[54:33] it's kind of like bringing someone back
[54:34] up here to the throne with his father
[54:36] coming back with the robe and the royal
[54:38] ring and the fatigue have all these
[54:40] things being restored
[54:41] he's referring to his people with these
[54:44] terms
[54:45] so that they can know that you're coming
[54:47] back into a place of reconciliation and
[54:49] royalty again
[54:51] you will be my wife i will be your
[54:53] husband can you say amen
[54:55] thou shalt verse 4 verse 4 thou shalt no
[54:58] more
[54:59] be termed forsaken neither shall thy
[55:02] land any more be term desolate but thou
[55:04] shalt be called hazzaba
[55:06] and thy lambula for the lord delighteth
[55:10] in thee
[55:10] and thy land shall be married for as a
[55:13] young man
[55:14] married a virgin show shall thy sons
[55:17] marry thee and as the bridegroom
[55:18] rejoiceth over the bride
[55:20] so shall thy god rejoice over thee i'm
[55:22] telling you the children of israel who
[55:24] were called forsaken
[55:25] who were called desolate that's the term
[55:28] that they have took on for years
[55:30] because of their rebellion you're the
[55:31] forsaken you're nothing
[55:33] god has to restore say i will no longer
[55:36] refer to you
[55:37] as the forsaken bride but you are the
[55:39] restored bride
[55:41] and like a young man has a virgin and a
[55:44] bride
[55:45] and he rejoices in her i want to let you
[55:47] know i am not wroth with you
[55:49] i am no longer angry with you you are my
[55:52] wife
[55:52] i am your husband you're not no longer
[55:55] called forsaken
[55:56] but you're called my wife
[56:01] and i delight in you and i rejoice in
[56:05] you
[56:08] i delight in you i rejoice in you you're
[56:10] my wife
[56:11] all right it's wonderful
[56:16] i love the book of isaiah as it comes
[56:17] into redemption that way
[56:19] it begins to build the people back up go
[56:21] over with me says it also in hosea
[56:23] chapter 2
[56:24] another prophet speaks it if you can
[56:27] find it hosea chapter 2.
[56:34] and verse 1 through 13 is all referring
[56:37] to
[56:38] israel's adultery spiritually she is an
[56:40] adulteress
[56:41] look what happens though in our adultery
[56:43] you know spiritually you're an
[56:44] adulteress
[56:45] we're an adulteress against god right so
[56:48] she's in adultery but look at verse 14 i
[56:50] believe is where it picks up
[56:53] therefore behold i will allure her and
[56:55] bring her into the wilderness and speak
[56:57] comfortably unto her
[56:58] and i will give her vineyards from dents
[57:00] in the valley of acor for a door of hope
[57:02] and she shall sing there as in the days
[57:03] of her youth and as in the days when she
[57:05] came up out of the land of egypt
[57:07] and it shall be at that day saith the
[57:09] lord that
[57:10] thou shalt call me ishii and shall
[57:13] call me no more valley
[57:17] for i will take away the name so let's
[57:19] just stop right there
[57:21] once again just like isaiah says you
[57:22] shall no longer call me bally
[57:25] which means master
[57:29] but you shall call me ishi which means
[57:38] husband
[57:44] first seal yes as the word begins to
[57:47] open up
[57:47] come on brother brother brown's talking
[57:50] and he just says
[57:52] i i won't refer to you as church
[57:56] i call you bride and that's at the
[57:59] opening of the seals
[58:01] i call you bride
[58:05] you no longer address me as master
[58:09] but is she husband
[58:13] i just i know we're getting a little
[58:14] tired but listen listen now
[58:16] i just hope you don't miss it the
[58:19] powerful
[58:21] relationship that that means
[58:26] a servant and a slave is nowhere near
[58:29] in their intimate relationship as
[58:31] husband and yet god says
[58:34] i'm reconciling you and i'm bringing you
[58:37] into this relationship
[58:39] because i love you
[58:44] moving into the new testament now jesus
[58:47] begins using the term bride and groom
[58:48] you remember the one time
[58:50] it's familiar to you the prophecy for
[58:51] the end time he says there'll be ten
[58:53] virgins in the end time
[58:54] five foolish five wives wise
[58:58] and then he says all of them heard the
[59:01] call behold the bride groom cometh
[59:03] this when jesus begins to refer to bride
[59:05] and bridegroom
[59:06] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[59:08] to me him
[59:09] the foolish virgins didn't have oil
[59:11] which means the holy spirit
[59:12] they tried to go but didn't have holy
[59:14] spirit to go with right
[59:16] so this is all about the end time what's
[59:17] it about bride bridegroom
[59:19] the bride who cometh go out to meet the
[59:21] bridegroom but only five virgins have
[59:24] oil
[59:25] they're the ones that meet him so that's
[59:27] one place he refers to it but john
[59:29] 3 if you would turn with me to john 3
[59:32] john the baptist refers to it and i
[59:34] referred to this last sunday
[59:35] we have to catch this john chapter 3 and
[59:37] verse 25 if you would
[59:40] john chapter 3 verse 25
[59:44] then there arose a question between some
[59:46] of john's disciples and the jews about
[59:48] purifying
[59:48] and they came unto john and said unto
[59:50] him are everybody still awake
[59:54] i shouldn't have a kids days that long
[59:55] and then preach this long the next day
[59:57] i'm getting ready to close i promise
[59:58] just in a few minutes
[1:00:01] but the word is good amen not me but the
[1:00:03] word is good
[1:00:04] everybody stand up with your body stand
[1:00:06] up for a minute
[1:00:09] say praise the lord raise your hand
[1:00:10] stretch a little bit
[1:00:13] amen this is a little spiritual exercise
[1:00:18] i would have you do what josh my
[1:00:20] son-in-law does to me every day but
[1:00:22] you'd be dying by the time i got done
[1:00:24] all right praise the lord sit down
[1:00:33] look at this there was a question
[1:00:35] between john's disciples and the jews
[1:00:37] about purifying and they came unto john
[1:00:38] and said
[1:00:39] rabbi he that is with thee beyond jordan
[1:00:41] to whom thou bearest witness
[1:00:43] behold the same baptizeth and all men
[1:00:44] come to him
[1:00:46] john's disciples say the one you said is
[1:00:48] the lamb
[1:00:49] he's over there he's baptizing too so
[1:00:51] the question is about
[1:00:52] first of all about purifying with the
[1:00:54] jews they were having discussions about
[1:00:56] it
[1:00:56] how is a person purified and they're
[1:00:59] asking why is he baptizing over there
[1:01:01] jesus has disciples he's baptizing
[1:01:03] and we still have disciples we're
[1:01:04] baptizing this is john's disciples they
[1:01:07] were
[1:01:07] disciples of john the baptist who by the
[1:01:09] way had the spirit of
[1:01:10] elias on him how many believe that
[1:01:14] so there's disciples of the people who
[1:01:16] are following the guy that has the
[1:01:17] spirit of elias on him
[1:01:19] and they're staying with john and still
[1:01:21] helping him baptize
[1:01:22] and this was john's response john
[1:01:24] answered and said a man can receive
[1:01:26] nothing except be
[1:01:27] be given from heaven so first of all he
[1:01:28] answers the question about purification
[1:01:30] you're not purified because you're
[1:01:32] baptized
[1:01:33] you're not fearful if you receive
[1:01:35] anything it's because a man can
[1:01:37] resiliently accept he'd be given him
[1:01:39] from heaven
[1:01:39] you're given this purification you're
[1:01:41] given something from god
[1:01:43] in your soul it's not baptism that does
[1:01:46] it
[1:01:47] right then he goes and he says you
[1:01:49] yourself bear witness that i said i am
[1:01:50] not the christ but that i am set before
[1:01:52] him
[1:01:53] he that half the bride is the bridegroom
[1:01:56] but the friend of the bridegroom which
[1:01:58] standeth and hearing him
[1:02:00] rejoice greatly because the bridegroom's
[1:02:02] voice
[1:02:03] this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:02:07] do you know that john the baptist just
[1:02:09] said that there's two groups
[1:02:15] under the whole ministry of elijah
[1:02:17] because he had the spirit of elijah and
[1:02:19] jesus coming
[1:02:20] and all the movement going on john says
[1:02:23] there's two groups
[1:02:29] there's the bride who will be married
[1:02:32] to christ and then there's the friends
[1:02:35] of the bridegroom now don't go away
[1:02:37] saying that i'm saying that john the
[1:02:38] baptist was just a friend of the
[1:02:39] bridegroom
[1:02:40] he was elect but he's the one making the
[1:02:43] separation saying
[1:02:44] there's the friends of the bridegroom
[1:02:46] but then there's the bride
[1:02:47] at a wedding there's the best man
[1:02:49] there's the maid of honor
[1:02:51] there's all the other people there's the
[1:02:52] friends of the family there's the
[1:02:54] friends of the bridegroom there's a
[1:02:56] friend of bride and they sit on both
[1:02:57] sides and they do this
[1:03:01] but there's only one bride standing
[1:03:03] there
[1:03:06] and john says there are those that are
[1:03:08] friends of the bridegroom
[1:03:10] that rejoice just because of the
[1:03:12] bridegroom's voice
[1:03:15] but there's a deeper group there's a
[1:03:17] there's a there's a group that goes
[1:03:19] deeper than just rejoicing
[1:03:20] in the bridegroom's voice
[1:03:23] respectfully i believe that there's been
[1:03:26] many conventions through the years
[1:03:27] with a lot of people rejoicing over the
[1:03:30] bridegroom's voice but my question to
[1:03:32] you is
[1:03:33] just because you're rejoicing over the
[1:03:36] bridegroom's voice
[1:03:37] doesn't mean that you're the bride of
[1:03:40] jesus christ
[1:03:44] i don't know about you but i want to be
[1:03:46] the bride
[1:03:47] i want to be in fellowship with him i
[1:03:49] want to be in relationship with him
[1:03:52] i love his voice i love to hear his
[1:03:53] voice too but i don't want to just be
[1:03:56] going and shouting over the voice that's
[1:03:58] come
[1:03:59] i want to be intimate close spiritually
[1:04:02] with that who that voice is yes
[1:04:06] john was a voice and he says you were
[1:04:09] willing for a see jesus said you were
[1:04:10] willing for a season
[1:04:11] to rejoice in that light to rejoice in
[1:04:14] john's voice
[1:04:15] but that's not the voice we're looking
[1:04:17] to today and there are movements that
[1:04:19] are
[1:04:19] building up and keep building up the
[1:04:22] prophet and building up the prophet and
[1:04:24] keep pointing the people to the prophet
[1:04:26] and i'm here to say this scripture says
[1:04:27] there's two groups
[1:04:28] we're not just to continue to emphasize
[1:04:31] just the voice that came through the
[1:04:32] prophet
[1:04:33] but this message has called us to come
[1:04:36] into a relationship
[1:04:37] with the husband jesus christ
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:43] it's not a movement it's a relationship
[1:04:48] it's not a movement it's a relationship
[1:04:53] and then john says the words verse 30 if
[1:04:55] you still have it up
[1:04:57] i know i'm ending in a minute john says
[1:04:59] the words in verse 30
[1:05:02] he christ must increase
[1:05:05] but me the prophet must decrease
[1:05:12] that transition is happening today too
[1:05:17] where he the prophet as far as
[1:05:20] personality and all that
[1:05:21] must decrease and christ must increase
[1:05:24] the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:05:27] the invisible union has come you find
[1:05:30] everything i'm saying in the message i
[1:05:31] don't have time to read the quotes today
[1:05:33] but when he has titles like the
[1:05:34] restoration of the bride
[1:05:36] tree that's what i'm preaching the
[1:05:37] reconciliation of the bride
[1:05:40] when he has titles like the invisible
[1:05:41] union of christ with christ and his
[1:05:42] bride
[1:05:43] it's speaking of this marriage that's
[1:05:45] taking place
[1:05:46] it's beyond just a message can you say
[1:05:48] amen so when i said at the beginning i'm
[1:05:50] going to try to wrap this up
[1:05:51] so i don't have to do it next sunday
[1:05:52] listen when i said at the beginning when
[1:05:54] we come to god
[1:05:55] we come to him for certain things at a
[1:05:58] certain level can you say amen
[1:06:00] and but we don't expect that he when we
[1:06:02] first came
[1:06:03] we didn't know that he wanted us to be
[1:06:04] his bride there are women in the bible
[1:06:07] if you go through the bible that realize
[1:06:09] when they came to god
[1:06:10] they were expecting certain things from
[1:06:12] god but they didn't realize that they
[1:06:14] would become his wife
[1:06:16] when rebecca watered isaac's campbell's
[1:06:19] camels in the mind of god she was to be
[1:06:23] isaac's wife but she didn't know that
[1:06:26] so she just politely and humbly she says
[1:06:29] i'll water
[1:06:30] all of your camels for you and she
[1:06:32] didn't know in the mind of god
[1:06:34] the man of god had already spoken and it
[1:06:37] says
[1:06:37] the girl who waters all my camels and
[1:06:40] it offers to do that willingly she'll be
[1:06:42] the one she didn't know it
[1:06:44] she just did it she just did that to
[1:06:46] service and she didn't realize
[1:06:48] she would be the bride
[1:06:51] ruth came with naomi and there was a
[1:06:53] famine in the land
[1:06:55] they were just hungry they just needed
[1:06:56] food we're going to have to get out of
[1:06:58] here
[1:06:58] so both her nanome and naomi left she
[1:07:00] didn't know the mind of god she didn't
[1:07:02] know the thoughts of god
[1:07:04] and so she gets in the middle and naomi
[1:07:06] says that's my kinsmen over there
[1:07:07] see if he has any food get around him
[1:07:09] start to go work in his food
[1:07:11] so ruth says i'm going to go work in his
[1:07:12] fields i'll just get close start working
[1:07:14] around him and all that
[1:07:15] she just wanted food she just wanted to
[1:07:16] be sustained during a famine
[1:07:18] she didn't know that she would become
[1:07:20] the wife
[1:07:21] of boaz
[1:07:25] everybody see what i'm seeing sure we
[1:07:28] come to god for certain things
[1:07:31] but he doesn't want you to come just for
[1:07:32] forgiveness
[1:07:35] he's invited to be his bride
[1:07:40] you getting it should i go
[1:07:43] abigail she's married to another guy
[1:07:46] nabo
[1:07:46] he's a mess he's saying disrespectful
[1:07:49] things to david who's the type of christ
[1:07:51] and she's going what am i going to do
[1:07:52] with this man he's a mess so she goes
[1:07:55] secretly because david's going to
[1:07:56] destroy all of them she secretly goes
[1:07:58] and talks
[1:07:59] just bows before david as a servant
[1:08:01] you're handmade she keeps using the term
[1:08:03] handmade
[1:08:04] your servant your slave and she's
[1:08:06] respectfully saying do this
[1:08:07] if you did this and she she talks david
[1:08:10] out of destroying her husband
[1:08:12] and the whole family she's just coming
[1:08:14] with a cr
[1:08:15] request to christ
[1:08:18] but in the mind of god
[1:08:22] in the mind of god she would become his
[1:08:25] wife
[1:08:28] isn't that wonderful
[1:08:31] because her husband passes away i think
[1:08:33] in a heart attack and that
[1:08:35] bang bang bang and the bible says david
[1:08:38] takes her abigail
[1:08:39] to be his wife she didn't know that she
[1:08:42] didn't know it'd be that type of
[1:08:43] relationship
[1:08:45] so let's so listen when you come to the
[1:08:48] lord
[1:08:49] and maybe even today i'm convinced a lot
[1:08:52] of us don't realize
[1:08:54] how close the lord wants you to him
[1:08:58] you young people i don't know if you
[1:09:01] realize
[1:09:02] how close the lord wants to be to you
[1:09:06] and it's only your limitations that
[1:09:08] keeps you going just so far with him
[1:09:10] but he's reconciling you to a much
[1:09:12] closer relationship
[1:09:14] than what you have today
[1:09:18] they came to god with a certain need
[1:09:22] god met the need but they didn't realize
[1:09:26] i don't want you just to be my handmaid
[1:09:30] i want you to be my wife aren't you
[1:09:33] don't you feel good today don't you feel
[1:09:35] love of god
[1:09:37] from the very songs this morning don't
[1:09:39] you feel loved by god
[1:09:41] he ran to me he wants me to be his bride
[1:09:46] he wants to be infested i say to message
[1:09:48] believers or whoever's listening and
[1:09:50] streaming whatever it is
[1:09:51] i challenge you today where's your
[1:09:53] relationship
[1:09:54] with this christ this husband this word
[1:09:58] on a scale of one to ten where are you
[1:09:59] at today because to me this message
[1:10:03] is about relationship
[1:10:06] not rules not religion
[1:10:09] this isn't another movement this isn't
[1:10:11] another dress code
[1:10:12] amen it's not what the message is about
[1:10:15] it's
[1:10:16] part of it but it's not what this is
[1:10:17] taking us to if we can just get all the
[1:10:20] women dressed right
[1:10:21] and all the men just dressed perfect
[1:10:23] then we're the bride
[1:10:24] no no no no no it's a about relationship
[1:10:27] with the husband
[1:10:30] you young people come into close
[1:10:31] relationship with him and
[1:10:33] feed on his word every day and talk with
[1:10:35] him and you with him and have communion
[1:10:37] you don't have to worry about things in
[1:10:39] your life god will show you how to live
[1:10:42] god will bring the things in your life
[1:10:44] that you need just come into
[1:10:45] relationship with you
[1:10:47] can you say praise the lord
[1:10:50] into thy chamber

[1:12:37] don't have to go through a priest or go
[1:12:39] through

[1:12:43] directly to the lord
[1:12:45] from your own lips and your own heart
