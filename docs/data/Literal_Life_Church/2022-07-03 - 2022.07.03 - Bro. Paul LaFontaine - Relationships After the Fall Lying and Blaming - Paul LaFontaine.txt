TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to hear any other visitors we're just glad to have you this morning i noticed brother holt's girlfriend there good to have you sis and all that's joined in with us genesis chapter 3 if you would with me this morning genesis chapter 3 and i know i read this a couple weeks ago but i'm going to read through it again until 2 13 and pull some things out of it here again do you love the word of god amen i love the word of god it's the absolute it's the anchor in our lives and that's why we need more and more of it we need his revelation this morning the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said in the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil i want you to notice the first thing that's happened here is a misinterpretation of the word but you can really technically call it a lie it's a lie even though there's 90 percent truth to it if it's got air in it this way it's misinterpretation it's still called a lie and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the uh she took of the fruit their oven did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord walking god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden so now we get to see some of the fallout of then of leaving the word and a lie told against the word now we have the fall taking place the great thing that's called the fall of man and so this is the attributes that start to come from it and that's hiding from god the fellowship the union the oneness they had walking in the cool the evening with him has been broken there's guilt there's shame all the oneness has been broken and they're hiding and the voice of the lord is still trying to come and find them verse 9 and the lord called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have i commanded thee that thou should not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat this is something the prophet starts to refer to and starts to show passing the buck or blaming it's another attribute of the fall and that is instead of taking ownership and telling the truth himself because remember now the spirit of lies is consuming everything now and so now they become liars himself he should have been answering yes i took of it instead now he's blaming his wife so nobody starts to answer truthfully because you're under the spirit of lies now so now in in this in lies spirit of lies will never work in oneness in relationships only the truth and he said who told me that that was naked verse 12 and the man said the woman thou gave was to me she gave me a tree and i did eat and the lord said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat and so now it's a trickle-down effect father bless your word today you know lord what you need to say to your precious people your sons and your daughters they are here they are hungry lord and they're listening and so i pray you'll give us ears to hear spiritual ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church we commit it to you we're thankful lord and once again we are thankful for a life like brother tom we honor him today pray you'll bless his life give him health give him strength and i pray he'll just have a wonderful week and a wonderful day and we commit the day to you whatever plans that we have on this independence weekend lord as the the nation celebrates their own way with no doubt alcohol and all these other things but lord we remember the many millions of lives that have died for our freedom and we're thankful for it you died for our spiritual freedom and we've had many men and women die for our freedom to be free in this country still so we're thankful for it and we rejoice in it lord may you help us lord to keep that in mind in jesus name amen god bless you once you shake your brother and sister's hands before you're seated god bless you each one now i'm preaching this morning again on relationships i'm going back to the subject of relationships and it's amazing how if you look real deeply at the actions of adam and eve after the fall and literally right after the fall it's amazing to look at the characteristics that these are characteristics right just i don't know if it was a few minutes or a few days i don't know that but it's right after the fall it's amazing if you look very deeply you can see that there are characteristics coming out that are so revealing of how broken relationships function today if we if we can be honest and we can see our fallen condition and the broken conditions that we live in today if we would just look honestly at that then we can see it back where it started at the beginning and not just to look honest and to be honest and to see we're in a fallen condition and uh we're in broken conditions with our families and there's such a uh such a so many things we can talk about as far as broken families and broken relationships the hour that we live in i think it's the worst age that we've ever had for that and so but when we look at the beginning we can look and honestly see where our fallen condition came from and that also there is no way to get on the road to redemption and restoration unless we are honest about the condition that we are in unless there's repentance unless there's an acknowledgement of the condition that we're in first and that's why when the kingdom of god opened up in the book of acts it began with repentance you'll never get into the channel or god's redemptive power unless there's repentance first unless there's an acknowledgement of the condition that you're in and that i need help from god that i need help my relationships are broken i i'm at i'm at a loss here i don't know what to do unless there's a repentance and say lord i need help you'll never find the path to redemption but once you begin repenting and saying i acknowledge the condition i'm in i see it in the garden i see it now in my family i see what i've done i see what i've done wrong and when you begin to get in that kind of mode then you open yourself up to a great great power and the road to redemption and restoration and the only way we have that is through the blood of jesus christ at calvary that he made a way to redeem us back and to restore broken relationships not only with god but with one another as well let me proclaim at the outset that whatever i say on relationships in your life that are in a still in a fallen condition if i get specific today and talk a little bit about things that make it uncomfortable for you let me say that whatever i talk to you about in the relationships in your life being maybe still in a fallen type condition no matter how ugly no matter how bad it is you need to know that however fallen the power of redemption can come to sons and daughters of god and give them the right thing and restore the worst conditions and if we don't believe that we shouldn't even be at church this morning there is a power of redemption that comes from calvary that has the power for every impossible situation every marriage that's broken every family that's broken anything that has been broken calvary has the power to restore if we don't believe that we shouldn't be a church because we're about the blood of jesus christ here we're about the power of god here this isn't just word but it's the word and power paul even said he said i don't preach enticing words of man's wisdom but through power and demonstration of the holy ghost in other words god has the power to come and do something about it and preachers many times preach under conviction because they tell our problems the conviction comes lord i'm in a state that i need your help but it's a good thing we're not left in a state that we're left without help there's a power that comes through preaching and if we'll reel to him can you say amen every broken thing can be restored i could safely say though that we're in the worst condition of any generation that the world has ever been in everything has become corrupted families minds everything and hatred and bitterness and distrust and divorce has filled our age and not only all of this brokenness and this hatred and this bitterness and we've we've reached another level in our country of divide and hatred towards one another people who used to get along in our world politically the lines are being drawn and it's not just that they disagree anymore there's a hatred towards one another there's a hatred when political laws are changed and each side becomes digging in their heels even more how many read the news and understand we're in a different we're in a civil war in this country can you say amen and the divide is getting bigger that's the spirit that's in our nation it's the spirit in the world god have mercy if we let that spirit come in the church but it's in the end that he sends a word of restoration it's in the end when relationships are broken like they are it's in the end when when 60 of marriages end up in a divorce it's in the end when everything has been broken it's in the end that god has prophecies of a restoration of his word and that word will have power in it it just needs to be believed with all of your heart and then we watch it do its work can you say amen the conditions that i i deal with uh sometimes even as a pastor in these days i would not even attempt and i wouldn't even attempt to try to help unless i knew that there was a power and to watch that power go to work you say well i'm not i can't get back my husband i can't get back with my wife that's over that's done they're married to someone well i'm not talking about that type of restoration i'm talking about god restoring you that you can live victorious i'm talking about a power that you can live above it and you can go on in the lord no matter what's happened to you in your life the power redemption says i can raise up above it i can overcome it the holy ghost can overcome it can i get any help this morning can i get an amen thankfully we can preach a power of redemption that will bring us out of it and the prophet uh the prophet uh isaiah said it this way and i'm just going to mention this prophecy it become real inspiring to me yesterday this week as i'm studying about on some services at the youth camp a couple classes wednesday and thursday morning at byc this week been studying for that but this became real real to me i know it's a scripture that you've heard all many many times but this is how the prophet isaiah and by the way i'll be quoting other prophets today but this is how the prophet isaiah in isaiah 59 19 if you want to pull it up isaiah 59 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun now you know the rest of the scripture but let's just read the first part again so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun you know what group of people that's talking about that's the bride of jesus christ because we are in the western hemisphere we are in the west part of the world and so shall they fear the name of the lord there's going to be a bride in the west now jesus was born in the east the gospel started in the eastern part of the world that it began to rise and the light shine there and then that light began to start shining and it went into europe and it went into india and went in all those places and then finally the gospel traveled over with the pilgrims and come into our country and now it's traveled all the way west west west but he said there will be a people in the west that fear the name of the lord i believe that's the bride of jesus christ and his glory from the rising of the sun why did the prophet have to preach the rising of the sun because it's in this last hour it will be the rising of the son of god again his word will come back again can you say there'll be a resurrection of his word so this is a prophecy but here's the part that is happening in our day that is you've read it before but in that day when the enemy shall come in like a flood our enemy today is not coming in like a trickle or like a rippling brook maybe in other area ages he came as just a rippling he came as a river maybe a fast flowing river maybe in other ages he came in a different way but in your age in your time the enemy shall come in like a flood and a flood i don't know if you've ever been in a flood most of us probably haven't but if you watch videos of seeing people in a flood it's a very dangerous thing and the flood that water has power it swipes i've watched some of the things from the the typhoons and different things in the philippines and some videos our brother sends us and that power behind the water coming in like a flood i tell you you better get somewhere because it's going to sweep away everything and the enemy is wanting to sweep your life away from everything good young people the enemies come in like a flood not a trickle not a little river but like a flood and if you're not holding on to something that flood will sweep you away can i get an amen this morning the enemy you're dealing with and we're dealing with internally is a flood it's not just a little thing but we're dealing with something deeper and you'll be swept away unless you got the rest of the prophecy when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against it i'm so glad for the other part of the prophecy because when this flood takes place you know if you've never been there you people talk you've never been in a flood but spiritually you're really in a flood because it's the enemy trying to take your children it's the enemy trying to flood your home it's the enemy tried to get in through all the movies it's the enemy flooding to sweep away and somebody that's in a flood has watched their home swept away they've watched their cars sweep away everything gets swept away because it's a flood you don't have anything within you to stop that happening the only thing we need is a standard a bander something to hang on to and you've watched those people's in those clips sometimes they grab a hold of something that will hold something that'll stay and for hours and days they have to hold on to that i say if you have the token today you've got this word i say you ought to hold on to it for dear life you ought to grab a hold stronger than you've ever grabbed because the enemy is rushing like a flood say it again if we can if we can't be honest and acknowledge our broken conditions we'll never tap into the redemptive power i'd like you to turn with me to first john chapter one as we see john first john here and um i want to go into a little series later on on the antichrist because it's only in first second third john that the antichrist spirit is mentioned revelation that exposes them but it's not called the antichrist spirit and the antichrist himself when it comes incarnate so i've been studying this and so i'm only going to hit the first few scriptures i'm not going to talk about that today but i like john because if he is the one that has to tell us about dealing with the antichrist spirit at the end and how to deal with it he's going to draw some very clear lines to how we can tell this is the antichrist spirit and this is not john is so straight you remember a scripture later on in the book that says he that loves the world or the things of the world hath not the love of the father in him my goodness that's straight that's strong you've got the love of the things of the world something's wrong and he makes it clear because why does he have to make it clear because if you're dealing with the antichrist spirit that's so close and by the way it's not out there somewhere in denominational systems it's not out there it's not in the the pope and everything that we talk about no no no no the antichrist spirit is so close and it's working right among us i'm not too popular today but anyway don't you ever attribute it out there somewhere it's working to try to cause things within us and if we have to be ready for that antichrist spirit we better read first second and third john we better get a hold of the the anchor because we need to know so john draws some clear lines here first john 1 verse 5 says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that here we go here's the distinction clear-cut god is light and in him is no darkness at all don't ever blend all this together and say well there's a little bit of darkness there no he's light and there's no darkness in him if we say that we have fellowship with him oh now he's talking about fellowship if we have fellowship if we say well i've got fellowship with the lord i'm oneness with the lord and walk in darkness we are lying good grief i'm not come on guys i'm not as strong a preacher as john here my goodness if we're saying we're in fellowship with him and we're in oneness and we're walking in our daily life in darkness we're lying that's a lie you're lying to yourself because god is light and in his no darkness we're we're running from the darkness we're walking in the light every day not just a church we want to live in the light and light exposes lies light exposes darkness and if you live in it there's no hidden closets [Music] praise the lord this is where they're at see because the antichrist spirit it just blends it all together and you're okay and that's all right yeah a little this a little of the world that'll be fine that's the antichrist spirit that works in denominational systems and let the people do it no preachers will preach against it i don't blame the people no preachers will stand up and preach against the things of the world but when you're dealing with antichrist spirit you better preach against things of the world you better make distinctions because in this word in this light in this message if you're preaching it god is light and in him is no darkness at all and if you fellowship say you fellowship and you walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in light as he is in the light we have noticed his presence is there too can you say amen if we walk in light as he is in the light we have fellowship now i'm preaching on relationships i'm preaching on oneness how do we find oneness how do we find true fellowship how many would raise your hand the story don't raise your hand unless you mean it is that i want to try i want to find true fellowship with one another true holy ghost fellowship if we walk in the light he's eating light we have fellowship one with another so so fellowship only comes by walking in the light not in lies in in light that's the only way you can have true fellowship and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sins if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us now he's initially talking about somebody who won't confess that they're a sinner that they have sin in their life that they're born with a serpent nature and anybody that doesn't take the first step and will not confess and acknowledge that they have sin in their lives they'll never find the path of redemption because why because it says if you say you have no sin you're deceiving yourself it's self-deception and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins so now now we're looking at what we're preaching on and that's confession and truth if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all righteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make god a liar so you're deceiving yourselves you're lying yourself i don't have any sin for god to deal with you're deceiving yourselves and you're actually calling god a liar i haven't done anything wrong i've been a good person i've lived a decent life i don't need christ i don't need the lord i'm a decent person i have no sin in me i've lived a good life you're making god a liar and his word is not in us so thank you john for shooting straight with us my goodness but light goes with truth and us telling the truth light will always be with truth and telling the truth confessing i'm a sinner i'm in this condition don't make god a liar but say i'm a sinner i need him i i need god's redemption in my life i need god's grace now going back to genesis redemption uh redemption actually if you want to turn to genesis 4 redemption actually the path to redemption was caught by abel here the path to redemption was caught by abel adam and eve's son the true path to redemption was not caught by cain the serpent's son but it was caught by abel and he brought he caught a revelation that the way back was through blood the only way back was not through fruits not good through good things we do the only way now that we have to deal with this sin is through blood and to have a blood sacrifice a substitute that stands in your place he caught that revelation right away when he grew up and then all of a sudden now the two boys grow up this this boy of adam and eve he caught a revelation from god didn't know all the details that you know today didn't uphold the story he just caught a revelation our path to redemption our path back is through a substitute through a blood something stands in our place so but i want you to notice though even though he caught it and then you know what happened he brought the sacrifice of blood he was accepted by god yes you've got it right this is the way back cain's over here tries to bring his own fruits tries to justify himself his self-righteousness and you know what cain gets mad at abel and his righteousness that god gave him in his sacrifice he gets mad he gets angry which is another attribute of the fall why in the world is he angry at his brother for finding the right path back he should have been saying praise god abel i'm running over there to you bud let me go get a lamb you found it you got a revelation man i don't have it yet but i'm gonna get it and god actually said if you'll do what abel does i'll accept you that's a serpent seed come from the serpent and god offers him mercy but he ain't going to do it you know what he does the fallen nature he turns against abel he persecutes abel he puts him down and eventually murders him where does that come from that's why the prophet said elect this here's another distinction like john elect does not persecute elect it's a clear thing from our prophet of this hour elect does not persecute elect where does that come from where does killing come from where does anger come from where does persecuting somebody who's got a revelation come from it comes from the other side it never comes from god amen praise the lord so look at here genesis chapter four he caught the revelation genesis 4 and verse 25. i've got a lot of hay in my fork and fork and that's why i'm clipping along so i'll read fast and you listen quick as my dad used to and they say him to his wife again so now here we go abel gets killed by cain and adam knew his wife again and she bears son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom king slew so now seth is born and so then look at now abel had a revelation it was blood but i want you to notice something it wasn't good enough just to recognize that it was blood look what this third generation finds seth is born verse 26 and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then then began men to call upon the name of the lord so even though there was a generation who knew it was the blood sacrifice it wasn't good enough god needed man to rise up and say i'm calling on you lord i need you lord i need you to change me lord i'm calling upon you lord seth didn't call upon the first generation passed he didn't call upon it but i tell you there's a new generation that came up and then they said lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you i know my grandpappy i know my grandpappy he talked about the blood and we need the blood i know that i noticed the blood of calvary but i need it for myself and i'm calling out to you i need you i'm not running from you i'm running towards you then listen friends listen may god put in our hearts to call upon the name of the lord every day because we need the lord he needs you to say i need you not just we come to church but i'm i'm a mess i need you i need you it wasn't seth's generation it was the one after that that began to call upon the lord and how many remember from last sunday when i said that whole generation in the wilderness whole generation thank you for your comments about last sunday the whole generation god said because here they are complaining they said our children let me quickly say something about this two weeks before kids days sister sharon was in there writing songs for kids days and she fell upon that scripture that i read sunday she fell upon it that said here they are ready to go in the promised land and they complained they said we can't do it. but the worst thing that they said that sharon really called is that they said our children we need to go back to egypt but if we can't go back we're not going in because our children will be pray so they're speaking on behalf of the children if we go all the way in then our children pray well one of the translations says our children will be victims and she just begin to just weep because she feels like when god said now they're calling their children victims she thought of and she's away so i hope she don't mind me saying this she thought of the people that has left our ranks and actually has said we want to apologize to our children for raising them in the message we've made them victims just exactly what those under moses said so they feel like a victim they're going to make the children victims and they said we're not going in but god raises up this is part that inspired sharon god raises up and he says you know what joshua can go in because he has the right spirit caleb can go in because he has the right spirit and also those little ones that you said would be victims i'm letting them in the promised land somebody say praise the lord so if some parents don't get a hold of these things and i'm not knocking the parents i'm just saying if there's a bunch of parents in this generation that don't grab a hold of this holy ghost in this message god says i'm not going to hold the children accountable for that i'm going to deal with their hearts and i'm going to bring them into their land yeah go ahead and clap because that's what god is doing i'll bring those little ones and the presence of the lord she felt like that was the goal and the purpose of kids days that if god calls these young hearts and she said the presence of the lord came in that practice room and filled the whole place and last sunday she wept the entire service as i did not talk to her took the same text and preached on it she wept the entire service god is gonna bring the little ones in god says i don't care what the last generation has done i'm going to bring in the little ones it was the third generation that began to cry out to the lord not just that it was the blood but they needed to cry out to the lord to cry i need you see it's not just that you know about the blood it's when you admit that you are in a mess and say i need you lord i need you lord right now that's what god needs and he didn't just need that 20 years ago when you came to the altar he needs that every day paul said i die daily to myself i die daily i need the lord more than i've ever needed him before and he needs to hear that cry in your heart i need you lord i'm crying out to you lord this whole generation millions of people they don't need the lord they're not crying out but there's a bride that's crying out i need you lord i need your blood but i need i need your blood to have power in it to change my life god wants you to hear that you need him god needs you to speak the truth god needs honest truthful confession not a religion not to just know it was the blood it's when true redemption takes place that redemption power kicks in it's when true repentance takes place that true repentance and fellowship kicks in if you stay self-sufficient and refuse to to didn't refuse to and deny you have a problem and you you can't be helped if you keep you know denial is more than a river in egypt some people know that that was the only denial that's the only denial they know is the denial no no the worst kind is is that you're in denial that you need help that you're emotionally fragile my wife she a couple weeks ago she signs me up for she signs me up for a hearing test and i'm going wait a minute she comes across the kitchen she says she says i signed you up for a hearing test both of us you and me i've signed you over here i go huh what and i wasn't saying that because i couldn't hear i really i said what did you sign me up for because you know to be honest with you is that the last couple years i haven't had the hearing problem she's had the hearing problem and i'm wondering why if she has the problem why i have to go and be tested too i don't have time to do this i got other health issues i deal with and i know i don't have a problem with hearing i just don't we're going we're going to the hearing test we're going to go we got to do this done you have a problem you have a problem with comprehension you have a problem with this and you have a problem with that all right i'm going i don't have time to go but hon you've had the issues and i think you're in a bit of denial here you you you're the one and so we we go along and thinking both of us have had issues with hearing it just remind you just now of that uh 50th anniversary of that couple 60th anniversary and they're in the banquet and the husband wants to give a toast to his wife and he says dear bertha bertha i just want to say that after 60 years you have been tried and true and she goes eh i said after 50 years i found you to be tried and true and she goes what and then he just yells it after 50 years i wanted to say i'm happy with you you've been tried and true and she raises up and she says well i just want to let you know after 50 years i'm tired of you too she still didn't hear it i go to this lady and i'm i'm in this thing i don't know why i'm there so she says let's let's test you first mr lafontaine i said all right go right ahead no problem susie's crossing she has siri back here on the machine and she says siri play us some m uh not ambulance sounds ambient sounds right play as some ambient sounds and siri comes back and says i did not understand the question i said it sounds like your machine has problem hearing i ain't got the problem here you know so she'd test me she does a test and she's taken the score down and becca can hear what she's asking for me to respond and she can see what's going on is that they're both laughing he's coming here in denial and he's the one with the problem so it was kind of embarrassing and so then she takes her test and sure enough hers ends up not being as big an issue as mine and she loved that she enjoyed it thank the lord to just to end the story right we don't have hearing issues we both have fluid on our ears that we need to get drained off probably me from my swimming and i don't know what hers is from but that's all we have thank the lord she did say though in looking at the direction you're headed mr lafontaine your wife will never have hearing problems in about 10 years you're going to have to start to have issues i said well my dad had hearing aids so probably in my family so i'll probably issue in my dad you know after my dad died at the hospital there they called me a week later and said your dad left his uh good hearing aids here do you want them obviously dad didn't need him anymore he has perfect hearing now and he left them i said i'll come and pick him up so anyway uh you know so she says you're going to have issues down there so anyway you know what there's no sense of being denial you gotta admit you're the one that's got the problem you listening so i said that to open up and to talk about let me look at my title and remember what i'm talking about i want to talk about relationships after the fall this is part two but i want to talk about lying and blaming others for a few minutes so those who don't want to hear any more will close this part of the service for you if you want to go so let's start to break this down first thing they both started to do is lie and the other thing they start to do is blame the other person that is a relationship that is not healthy and normal it's a fallen condition when you lie and when you blame other people and don't take personal responsibility for what you've done that is a fallen condition that's from your fallen nature and you will act that way from a fallen nature never never is that within what christ is trying to be in your life so brother brahm says here and now when adam and eve listen to the die of the devil the holy image of god left them their fellowship was broken with god their fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very minute they listened to the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of god like she did is when you fail to take god's word just as it is so everybody understands the foundation to this oneness message is to realize when you listen to the lie of the enemy it breaks oneness with god it breaks fellowship with god and it breaks fellowship and the minute you listen to life the devil he says it'll break your fellowship so what's the thing that establishes fellowship what's the thing that strengthens fellowship your fellowship with god what's the thing that solidifies what's the thing that brings it back certainly when we stay close to the word of god and we listen and obey the word of god and we're living on the word of god and not the lie of the enemy not his interpretation of the word going on in the oneness message now he takes it further he says now the oneness in fellowship was broke between god and his children the minute she disbelieved one little paragraph one little word of god everybody get that say amen congregation says amen not a not a bible say i don't believe the bible at all i believe half of it she had to believe all of it every bit not only that but the oneness between husband and wife was broken i don't believe there's any marriage can be what it ought to be without a union between husband and wife and god i don't care what marriage it is a marriage cannot be what it's intended to be without a union between husband and wife and god i love these things that's right they'll bring up children in the world and make them illegitimate give them cigarettes whiskey play cards in their site drink liquor before them no matter how loyal they are to now so no so the brother brain goes from the marriage now and he goes to the trickle-down effect to the children the next generations and that is that if god is not the sinner if there's not oneness with god in that marriage if a a three uh a three-part court is not easily broken in other words it has to be you and god and the wife and oneness with one another and with god and his word for this to work right and so then he talks about the children if they don't then they may have a marriage but there will be an effect on the children no matter how loyal they are to their marriage vows that's just sexually that's flesh could i take a while on this yes because how many marriages are based upon just sex how many marriages are loyal to stay together because their vow binds them together but not by a unity of god or unity with one another not a oneness in spirit not an intimacy in spirit but basically just sex holds them together excuse me for being just so straight the the sexual experience is the only thing and that's the only reason they stay in the marriage and these days they don't stay in it they're unfaithful because they can get that anywhere you see so but but you don't have a marriage if it's only based upon that you see why are people deceived in that because the bond of a man and woman coming together in marriage in the sexual experience is a certain bond there's a bond to it and god knew that and satan also knew that there is a bomb that happens a unique bond that's why the world without the holy ghost without finding out what god said a marriage was we'll gravitate that because there's something special in there i call it special but it's something there's a bond there and so when people are wanting to be bonded they're wanting to feel someone loves them they'll reach suggest the sexual experience because there is a certain bond that takes place and so they cling to that thinking that's the only bond they need but if you go to god marriage is so much more than just that experience can you say it and they never go to god to find out and sometimes even in our own ranks friends that sometimes that's the only thing that holds people together sometimes young people it's a lust for one another and not a genuine love for one another that's not a good foundation for a marriage it has to be respect and honor can you say amen it has to be a union with christ young people you must be in union with christ fully by the holy ghost before you marry one another or it will be hell on earth got to be a strong union with him and then when you come together it's not sexually first that's what i teach young people they get it all backwards they're they're together the first night the first thing they do is intimate one another that's the thing that's the worldly way is they there's three ways to bond body spirit and soul they bond in body first maybe they bond in emotions where they have some likes for one another but most of them never bond in the soul i say in the kingdom of god it's the other way around that's why i teach courtship is the first bond and attraction you have one another is the holy ghost and one another can i get an amen if that's not their first attraction to that young boy in his consistent life you know does he own a bible is he consistent in church does he talk about the lord if he doesn't talk about the lord then i wonder if the lord's in his life but if you can talk about every other thing and you find a bond that way great you're going to like the same music you're going to like the same colors oh it's so nice we like the same things but where is that person's experience with the holy ghost the bond of the soul has to be first then in courtship you start to bond in spirit and emotions and you start to get to know one another oh that's fine notice i haven't said the body yet notice i haven't said bonding in kissing and touching and feeling i haven't said it because it belongs in one place and that's after you're married and when young people get it all backwards you you might get married but the foundations are all shaky just take the example of the two met together out in the world met in a bar slept with one another that night and now they think they love one another and they got some foundation for marriage there's some in this room that the redemptive power of god has brought you out of the miry clay you were in those bars you slept with those people because you weren't raised by a preacher that told you right and wrong like i'm doing now you weren't raised in a home or maybe you were amazed in a legalistic home and you ran away from the precepts of god but there's some in here that didn't get that but the redemptive power of god has them sitting here this morning learning about what real marriage is after 60 years old after being married 30 the grace of god they're even sitting together this morning and they're sitting like sometimes like children saying i messed up oh god forgive me for messing up but this is so good to hear and some some of them will probably like to stand up and turn back at all you young people and say listen to the what the man is saying please of course if you said it that way they're probably going to be turned off but anyway listen i hope these young people listen let me tell you my testimony of of of the scars and the pain and sleeping with all kinds of different women and all the thinking that's the bond or that's the craving of love i needed and i've learned today no that can't be first god has to be first as the foundation god the holy ghost and i'm only quoting brother branham who says if you do that he said if you marry that boy he'll make hell on earth for you that's his own words because he didn't have the birth yet and it'll be hell on earth for you my dear sister amen praise the lord praise the lord it's the word of god and you'll bring up children so now see i told you i could preach another around that no matter how loyal they are to the marriage office that's sexually that's flesh but there's a spirit in there that spirit of sinner papa and mama no matter how loyal they are children will come wrong you say well i know men and women that didn't teach your children the principles of god and they wasn't christians the very thing they're probably saying i know a lot of families out there they don't teach the christians of christ they seem to be doing all right the very thing of the not leading them to christ was the wrongest thing they ever could do besides the other not to lead them to christ see you can't have a correct union without it the fellowship broken then as soon as the fellowship was broken between adam and eve as soon as their fellowship was broken between god and them then their fellowship between each other was broke make it clear you can have a correct union without going to christ there can be no correct relationship with family or any other humans without the right one with god believing the word knowing the person of christ through a new birth through a personal relationship remember the garden of eden was not just a place it was a relationship and it was not just the word god said don't eat of that tree you can eat of all the trees but don't eat of that tree that was his word there's only one word to live by that was his word but eden was not just we got the commandments we got the word it wasn't just a word it was a relationship every day his presence came down it wasn't just said god gave us this bible and it's very short it's like two lines don't eat of this tree and we're just living by this living by this it wasn't just that he himself came down in fellowship and communed with him and said other things as well it's not just the word it's power with the word amen so then everything unravels after the fall guilt shame condemnation hiding sexual sin is there adultery respect is gone anger temper selfishness everything everything that held the relationship together with her husband was broken and the biggest thing that changed is they begin to lie why the you know satan's the father of lives the devil lied about the word the devil misinterpreted the word but we can call it a lie even if it's 99 truth in it so something misinterpreted excuse me something misinterpreted is really a lie and not the truth you can't have lies in every good right relationship you can't have blaming in relationships we must stay with it until the full truth comes out we must love how many of the marriages will that's been married many years will raise your hands down you can't have a solid marriage unless you live on truth and the truth comes out and you speak truth to one another anytime there's secrets any kind of secrets it breaks the fellowship anytime this little dabbling over here in adulterous pornographic things you don't even have to tell your wife you'll start to feel the oneness break and the wife starts to sense something's wrong and there's a break and there's a pride and there's there's uh he's getting more angry about stuff what's going on i'll tell you what's going on what brother brahman said here you break your with a fellowship with god you dabble in sin you break your oneness with one another we must love god by loving the truth not half truth paul said speaking the truth in love with one another when full truth is not pursued you're getting on to satan working among you when full truth is not pursued you're getting onto satan working among you praise the lord 12 34 i'm doing good i'm doing good on time so now watch next brother bram says what eve her thinking changed oh yes her thinking changed next quote her thinking so in the fall her thinking changed and her thinking towards adam changed and her thinking towards everything changed her fellowship with her husband wasn't right they begin to pass the buck see her thinking was actually changed why she had the life of the devil in her exactly as soon as she disbelieved god's word she accepted the life of the devil because she accepted his teaching interesting you accept satan's teaching the antichrist teaching of the of the bible if you accept it then you're accepting the life of the devil that goes with it so here's here it is the blame game the next quote and then we're done with the quotes watch now her union between her and her husband was broken quickly as soon as god said adam how did you do this instead of taking up for his wife he passed it on to his wife the woman now gave us me union broke what did she do instead of loving her husband and telling the truth she lied she should have said he's innocent i gave to him she didn't say that but that was the truth so it's just nobody's telling the truth it's just it's become just a feeling things it's avoiding punishment it's whatever it is but they're in the realm of lies they're not owning up to it he's saying what she should have said is adam is innocent i gave to him amen the bible said she gave to her husband she should have said the man's innocent i gave to him and then he did eat but i was the one that gave it to him instead of that she passed it on to the serpent closest bypass that's the same thing they tried to do today the husband wife the union broken husband and wife fellowship was broken between them how many heard brother ramsey say there that's the same thing marriages do today it happens in marriages today instead of speaking the truth well i don't want to hurt his feelings i don't want him to leave me whatever happens you're always better to own up to the full truth i would rather deal with the fallout to be truthful to my wife you know brother brown said he said if i went to another country and i flirted with another woman he said and it was with another woman he says now they'll come my comforter would keep me from doing that it's not going to be with another woman sexually the power of the holy ghost to keep you from that but he said one time he said just flirting with the other woman and then i come back and he says i said oh honey our dear i i didn't mean to do that i'm sorry i was i was just you know and and so then she says brother bryan says he says now she could leave me she could leave me over that she can't leave you over that no because she's hurt the relationship's been broken and you broke it but when he comes back and says you understand don't you do he's kind of insincere about it you know women don't take to that very well men don't take to it too well you're not being truthful i would rather be truthful and deal with the fallout like the woman who was all these years had nervousness and the prophet exposed to the holy spirit she had an affair with a man years ago and says you got to tell your husband she said well i told god that he said you don't owe that to god you owe it to your husband but if i do that he'll leave me he said whatever happens you got to tell the truth you see you're always better to be truthful even if it hurts get to the truth and then he says your husband's got to confess the same thing so they went and they confessed it to one another 20 years later to invest that marriage come back together and rest it was restored the bible says jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free you'll never be free in continuing to tell half truths to one another in your marriage the whole thing was marred it broke the fellowship the oneness within when there was broke the whole thing was marred because one word was disbelieved oh brother yeah she should have told the truth the oneness with her husband was gone and the oneness of them and god was gone and every church that doesn't take the whole of god's word the same thing happens you can have unity under some world council of churches and have half truths that you're preaching you've got to preach the word to have true unity in the body of christ amen but really it comes back to looking at yourself brother burleigh priesthood he says when something happens you look at yourself first so now i want to talk a little bit about blaming others because when something happens when sin happens when mistakes happen the first person you look at is yourself but we don't do that in our carnal nature in the fallen nature we're looking for reasons to blame somebody else under pressure we resort back to blaming to fighting to fussing to anger but brother burley said the first person that he looks at through this whole thing no sense in getting angry by everybody else look at yourself first it really comes back to that because if you're in fellowship you won't let someone pull you out of that fellowship not you're got not not going to protect everything over you're not going to excuse me you're not going to project everything over to others you're not going to say it's that other person that needs help and not me the first thing you say is i need help the first thing that you sing is that it's me it's me it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer not my brother not my sister but it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer there's an ownership that you take and it's a person that you look at first isn't it interesting that something happens and right away the first reaction the first reaction is to figure out who's to blame for this and within hours phone calls are made and everything let's try to figure out who's to blame i'm trying to teach you let's look at ourselves first before you go blaming somebody else blaming is a result of the fall it's not right it's not the christ-like way there's a young man in jail that said it's not my fault the other guys stole the stuff but they accused me the comedian flip wilson i remember this as a kid he used to say the devil made me do it so people blame other people they blame the devil and they blame god and you got a lot to you know you got a lot to blame there you know lots of people you blame god you can blame the devil flip wilson said the devil made me do it the devil why'd you do that the devil made me do it you've heard kids say that sometimes if they're growing up in church it's like diablo made me do it and that's not always good to shift the blame on him when you got to own up to what you did we blame fast food restaurants for making us fat we blame tobacco companies for giving us cancer we blame the church for our lack of spiritual growth we blame god for results of our poor choices oh god why is this happening to me we are in a culture where blaming others for our failures happens all the time but how does god view this blame game could it be a form of idolatry where our feelings of pride are elevated above any sense of responsibility we expect blame shifting from a child we expect it from a child how many has ever seen a child do that they're exposed it's it's there and they're still gonna say johnny johnny did it he did it we expect children to act this way but not adults many adults never grow to mental and emotional maturity still blaming others for their mistakes grown-ups acting like children counselors call this blame-shifting we come by this blame game honestly it's inherited sin i'm reading some things some writers have said here hope you don't mind it a lot of things that happened to us are the result of multiple contributing factors and can be caused by a mix of our own actions i'm going to read through these things i believe they're things to think about i'm going to read through them and i'm going to finish with something the lord gave me last night and i'll be closing a lot of things that happen to us are the result of multiple multiple contributing factors and it can be caused by a mix of our own actions and those of other people for example if you were to hit a pothole in the road and fall off your bike it was probably partly due to the fact that the road has been poorly maintained but also that you were cycling too fast and not looking where you were going if that were you you might be ranting and raging about your taxes are spent on these roads now that one was just too close to home with me it's just too convicting i had to repent right here ranting and raging about what your taxes are spent on these days and or would accept the part that you played in it and vow to learn from your mistakes if you find yourself trying to pass the buck for every mistake you make then it's probably gotten you into trouble in the past especially if you try to shift the blame onto your partner your marriage partner family best friends or people you have to work closely with no matter how much people love us there's only a certain number of times people will tolerate taking the blame for something that genuinely genuinely wasn't their fault you're only going to do that so long it's going to catch up with you and i'm talking to all of us here you're going to do that for so long it's going to catch up with you because people aren't going to tolerate being blamed for your mistakes as well as weakening our relationship being unable to take responsibility for our mistakes can damage us in other ways so now we have some reasons we blame others for our mistakes just so we we don't know sometimes the reasons why we do it you may have your own reasons but here's reasons why we choose to blame others for our mistakes all right number one to explain why something happened as humans it's our default to always look for something called it's our default to always look for the cause of something we like to have narratives that explain why things happen so that we can add these to our mental story of life rather than turning the light on ourselves or looking at the bigger picture in context we can explain things more quickly and easily by attributing them to others so one of the reasons that we do it is we explain it's to explain why something happened we like to find a story get a story quick and we like to find the fault and put it on somebody and we stick with that story even if not if it's not completely the truth number two the reason why we blame others to attack someone shifting the blame onto someone who is a subtle way to attack them we might do it so unconsciously but if we hold a grudge against someone for some reason perhaps we feel you've they've wronged us or blamed us in the past then if an opportunity to blame them presents itself it can be very tempting to take it blaming them for something is also a tactic we may use to hurt our partners whether we're aware of doing it or not number three why do we blame others it's a great defense mechanism shifting the blame directly onto someone or something else is the perfect way to avoid having to reflect on your behavior or delve deeply into your uh psyche that way that way you can remain blissfully unaware of your own shortcomings which can help maintain a fragile eagle i'm not talking about god's ego i'm talking about ego it's easier number four it's easier that way to blame others why would we bother doing all the tricky self-analysis and taking steps to fix the situation if we can just take the blame off of our own shoulders and place it on someone else sometimes we convince ourselves that it's really someone's else's fault but sometimes we know we're lying but we often decide on the spur of the moment that it's easier to tell a lie than it is to deal with the consequences of truth we learn to lie early on in life how many would say amen we are taught to lie we learn to lie early in life and most of us get pretty good at it we weigh the possibility of people finding out we've lied against the consequences we have to face if we own up and often take the easy option i'm just reading these to show you this is all from a fallen nature this is how we can rea react if it's from the fallen nature but christ does not react this way as a matter of fact i might as well say it christ took the path of calvary and to actually take the take the pain of our sin on himself we were to blame would you say man we were to blame and christ took that blame on himself number five we blame others because it removes inhibitions blaming other people can provide us with an excuse to act in a hurtful manner it's a way of justifying our actions excuse me it's a way of justifying our actions to ourselves to remove our brains natural inhibitions that are there to prevent us from having behaving poorly towards others it means we can build a thought pattern that allows us to act in a way that our moral compass would normally prevent so that's the that's the five that came from other writers i'm adding six and seven you blame others because you come out looking good self-righteous talking about other people makes us feel better about ourselves if we can tell what they did we don't look so bad that's why people talk about other people many times and god convict us all i'm guilty of it may we all do you think that i'm preaching that someone no no no no i'm preaching to every one of us here this morning we do these things for a reason and that is these reasons but also is that it feels much better if we can talk about other people and what they've done wrong because it puts us just a notch above and if anybody was listening wednesday night brother eli very masterfully brought what the key is and that's jesus humbled himself we need to humble ourselves and not think of ourselves higher than anybody else thank you brother eli you blame others because you come out looking better you come out looking pretty good any man that diagnoses themselves always comes out looking good number seven the reason you do is you're more interested in being right than the full truth or oneness with that person relationship must not be that important if you're always trying to put the blame on somebody else and not own up to it yourself you're more interested in looking out for yourself than the other person you're happy to hold on to a half truth then whole truth thus if you have hold on to half truth instead of pursue the whole truth thus half victories and not full victories how many did raise your hands i want full victories amen i want full directives and god has given us the victory god has given us full victories but we if we live on half truths then we're going to have half victories and sometimes not even any victories at all but the truth shall set you free so the father of lies has always i'm going to change this now and and wrap it up you know that the father of lies satan has always fought against the truth in every generation how many know that brother abraham said that the the enemy satan has had a success in always destroying the value of god's promise word for the age he's always destroying this trying to destroy the word for the age and the power of the word for the age he's always speaking against it he's always coming against it he's always saying things about it there's even people that blame the message and blame the prophet for the condition and the things that they've come to i'm a victim because of the blaming we were in a a a a a lunch with a minister and uh brother barry and i and we were talking to him and he spent about 20 minutes talking about all of his troubles in life and all the troubles he seen within the message and all the fanaticism he spent a lot of time talking about you tell he was down by it well everything he described i knew i i've seen it i've watched it for 20 30 years that's just human human nature human spirit coming out i don't judge the message by that i don't judge god by that can you say amen i'm not bailing out because people say stupid things and act stupid ways and fanaticism i don't do that but he spent all this time and brother brother barry saying to him straight listen all of these problems the message is not to blame for your problems and i'll echo that here this morning this precious message the word of god god himself is not to blame for your problems bring your problems to the lord and admit you're wrong you'll never be able to use it on judgment day to stand there and say but they did me wrong and this happened and this preacher and lord did you know about this situation it'll never stand up in court on the other side because at the end of the day it's about you and the word can you say mine i understand hurt i've been hurt i understand pain people have abused people have done wrong even preachers there's ministers that said things about me recently and i just say lord i put that in your hands that's between them and god i'm not going to lose sleep over this i'm going to pray for them i'm going to love them i'm not going to get caught up in this thing who's accusing me can you say amen we've got better things to do we've got the kingdom of god there's people being helped here i can't be distracted by things that are trying to cause division i've got to stay focused on the people who need help and in strength and so satan i'm i'm ending this in a minute but satan has always through every age blamed blamed blamed the message of the hour blame the prophets you you do you wonder why there's so much criticism towards our prophet we'll look to the bible they were always criticized nobody believed them hardly at all the pharisees garnished the tombs of the prophets and jesus said you're garnishing and polishing their tombs and you're the one who put them in the tomb put them in the tomb this prophet isn't the first one to be criticized and satan behind putting the word down putting the present truth but i got something to say as i closed this this morning i got something to say to the devil who is you know let me say to him first he is always blaming you he is always blaming the message he was always blaming others and he is convicted satan is guilty in every generation he's guilty he's a guilty creature this morning he's been condemned he's under the judgments of god his days are numbered that's why i believe that he's fighting so much internally and uh in in every way fighting our church fighting you think it's the only one satan is fighting churches i just talked to a pastor yesterday and they were saying this that and we're talking about different splits and different things going on is there's an intensity and satan trying to cause splits and everything and brother barry he just said to me this there's no sense in us talking about those he said i've got it in my church i said i got it because why it's not people it's the devil his days are numbered he's trying to split oneness [Applause] i got news for this convicted creature this this one that's under judgments are hanging over this diablo judgments are hanging over him and he's still trying to blame the message and blame everybody else he won't take responsibility for what he's done throughout the ages i got this news for satan this morning and for you and me as well the truth is marching on satan isn't it amazing that he's always blamed the truth and the prophets of every generation and guess what the truth is still here in this bible there's prophets that satan condemned and spoke against and tore down and fought against and guess what the truth marched on and they're still in this bible and we're still feeding on it satan i want to remind you you can never destroy the truth of god's word can't do it and so i can use that to say in situations sometimes when i'm counseling you be patient because the truth will always come out god is a defender of truth the hardest thing is to wait till it comes out we want to act quickly but the truth is marching on you can't destroy this message you can't destroy the prophets that they came from god you can't destroy the influence of it you can't take children and sons and daughters of god and cause you can't do it you can't satan you couldn't do it throughout generations you can't do it today the truth is marching on can you say that why am i saying that because the way that we can live life is to be lovers of truth and waiting till the truth comes out because the truth will set you free why don't you do this why don't you do that i'm waiting for the truth to come out you say you got a young girl you're in school somebody somebody blamed you for something somebody's accusing you the young ones in school you just told studies you pray you've been falsely accused you hold steady right there i'm encouraging you because the truth will always come out you'll be vindicated god you stand by god god will stand by you someday there's criticized for your dress and your long hair and all this stuff and you go to that strange church whatever you hold steady right there because god will back up and stand behind what he teaches his young girls to wear what he teaches them to be what he says he will back you up he'll stand by you julia ward howell 1819-1910 gave the united states and the world some of the most inspirational words ever written and she penned the battle hymn of republic public i don't know if you have that sister genie up there she pinned the battle hymn of republic in november of 1861 during a wartime tour of washington dc as americans realize with gloom that the seven month old civil war would be longer darker and deadlier than it was anticipated so she's right there in the middle of it she's watching she's watching the campfire she's watching the things and they realize this isn't going to be over any time school anytime soon this can be a fight it's going to be a fight a lot of lives are going to be lost and they knew that they knew thousands of lives one of the worst wars ever and more lives lost than just about any other war and they knew it and it was coming but you know what the fight was over you know what the fight was over the truth that all men are created equal but there's going to have to be a fight there's going to have to be men give their lives for truth how many know your freedom today wasn't free but this war was fought for truth i would like to say lord help me and help us that if we go to fighting that we fight with the right spirit and that our fight is not a personal fight but it's a fight for truth can i have some resolve from some soldiers here this morning when i fight i'm going to fight with the love of god i'm going to fight the right spirit but i always will fight for the truth i know i'm on the right side if i'm fighting for truth she pinned this song how's masterpiece has been called america's fight song glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on it's been called the fight song its lyrics inspired the united states to spiritual resolve and sacrifice the words tell the biblical heroic story of the union soldiers marching to their death in the name of christ to vanquish slavery so they're marching in the name of christ and her songs in the lyrics we won't go through all of them their lyrics intertwine with scripture especially when she says the word as he died to make men holy we die to make when free it's a link between what christ has done for us spiritually and what we have to do in war sometimes to fight for a truth and lives are lost and so this is all intermingled and it says the words tell the biblically um heroic story of union soldiers marching to their death in the name of christ to vanquish slavery as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free his truth is marching on and she describes being in these camps and in history in the civil war describes them men learning this song by memory and singing this song the night before they were ready to go into war most of them knowing they would die the next day there was hundreds of thousands that knew we will not survive this battle tomorrow but we're going to sing this song because if we die truth will march on if i have losses in it it doesn't matter i'm gonna fight anyway and i'm gonna die because i'm not fighting against a person that was the nice thing about the civil war a few people it became personal but most people it wasn't personable it wasn't a personal thing against their brothers in the south there was great respect it was a fight for truth i pray we can do that i pray we can do that because friends his truth my knives have seen the glory of the coming of the lord he's trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored he has loosed the faithful lightning of his terrible swift sword his truth is marching on you'll never crush truth it will always keep marching on praise the lord in relationships let me run back up here and finish the last two sentences and i'll be able to say after many many sundays that this sunday i finished everything in my notes brother stephen does it ever happen you're probably feeling too yeah i know he's finished now blaming others will only bind you but the truth will set you free fighting is okay if you're fighting to get to the truth not fighting one another and against one another but we rest that the truth will always win you start blaming the message you're blaming everybody else you're on your promise you're fighting against the wrong thing we fight together as believers for truth and no matter how much the devil tries to knock it out his truth here we are friends he's never been able to trample out the truth it's still here despite what you would think of me and what i would think of you we go through seasons or whatever the truth keeps marching on the truth is marching on and we'll go back to that one let's stand together go back to the other one i've seen him in the watchfars back i've seen him in the fires seen him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps they have built in him an altar in the evening dews and danced i can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lights his day is marching on glory glory hallelujah [Music] [Music] making a march here's truth solomon give me that snare he has sounded forth the trump that shall never sound retreat he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat oh be swift my soul to answer him be jubal in my feet our god is marching on [Music] hallelujah [Music] his truth is christ was born across the sea with the glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me as he died to make minerals let us die to make men free while god [Music] you'll never destroy truth it'll keep marching on [Music] [Music] one more time glory glory hallelujah hallelujah [Music] you bow our heads and pray with me would you speak to the lord convicting i know i know i see it convicting me and the only right response is just say lord i cry out to you and i need you i'm wrong lord and you're right i repent help your people here lord to find that kernel of truth that i'm preaching today that it never helps lord to blame you or the devil or the whole world never helps to do that but lord that we would own up to our part confess lord we don't even want to make you a liar as john said make god to be out of liar we don't want to do that lord you speak truth how disrespectful that would be my father to make you out the liar that somehow you lied to us you've never lied to us lord you're you're the source and the fountain of all truth it's satan that's lies to us it's satan that twisted misinterprets things forgive us lord forgive me how many years and how many different incidences that i took something that was said and i didn't pursue the truth on it and i concluded the wrong way forgive me father every time i did it i ended up in bondage ended up breaking relationship forgive me lord but may i be in all these be patient waiting may we be lovers of the truth we know the bible says in the last days they would be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god may we not just be lovers of god but lovers of truth always always seeking the truth and that's where we'll be free that will always march on that will always prove itself it will always come out lord even someday at judgment day the truth will be revealed on a lot of things so help us lord as christians bring the true conviction in our hearts lord in our marriages i've talked about marriages i've talked about children i've talked about brothers and sisters just trying to talk about all the interactions with other human beings that we have we want good solid healthy free relationships with one another and we can only find that when we're rooted and anchored in our relationship with you i pray lord that if there's a wall up between the person that's listening to me and you i pray you'll break that wall down lord i pray that they would access to you they break that wall down casting down imagination everything high thing that exalts itself above the knowledge of god that there'd be open communion and fellowship with all sins under the blood and we could freely talk to you lord and then lord may it bring such a divine love breaking in our hearts that we'd be able to reach out and say i love you no matter what you have done to me and no matter what you have said no matter what it is i'm gonna love you anyway and if i have to own up to anything i'm gonna own up to it help us lord to grow in maturity as the the lady there said on the quote from the one person that i read it's children sometimes that we see these immaturities and blaming others but when it comes up on our adults lord please forgive us help us father help us to mature as sons and daughters of god look at the deeper level look at the bigger picture i pray would anyone like to raise your hand and say i want to give my heart the lord more access to my heart during this service i feel like i need to yield and give him more let go of more things thank you just let go and let god have his way this morning let go and let god have his way i don't want it to be just a sermon to you i want it to the lord to become real to you lord jesus bless those hearts and those hands as we committed their lives holy to you in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you me be dismissed this morning if you need prayer just come and remember the service wednesday night at 7. i'd like to sing that song freedom to worship how many is god for the freedom that we still have in this country it's going away quickly but we're thankful for today you can fellowship or be together or whatever you're going to have the hot dogs and hamburgers but we still enjoy freedom that many countries don't have and i appreciate it the men that give their lives that we can still enjoy that we have some veterans even in the church that have given their service and we are thankful for them but all the men that have died we appreciate them that we still have these freedoms but we have a freedom in jesus christ and we want to walk in that freedom amen
