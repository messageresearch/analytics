welcome to retreat 2023 thank you Jesus you may be seated don't get carried away all right she'll be around after service we're thankful to be here good to be here at Retreat 2023 and uh been an honor uh to have served over the last 31 years doing Retreat and uh brother Paul and I have been doing this a long time a really long time as a matter of fact now when we look at facilities to hold a camp we look at you know how nice it a wheelchair ramps I mean we want to we kind of want to know those things we have had um you know generations of kids actually come uh to retreat over the years and now we even have grandchildren of early Retreat members that's how old brother Paul is and it's it's just a a thrill to see that over the years and I think one of the uh one of the positive things that have uh that has uh brought the blessing of God upon this meeting is uh you know it's it's different it's diverse uh look around and we have a diverse group come from all kinds of different churches and all kinds of different backgrounds but that don't matter very much and uh we try to do things uh you know a little bit differently and have uh sessions where we teach and and talk about practical things and things right where you are at your stage in life and uh then have one ful ministers who uh minister in uh evening services and it it's just been a blessing over the years uh but I want to say just at the outset here I thank you for praying for uh I think it was mentioned this morning the reason I was not here last night this morning is that my grandson Henry I was 10 years old he was in the hospital and had surgery uh this morning I was able to go down early and be with him before he went into surgery uh first time and he asked me before he went in because he was kind of nervous and he said BBY he said have you ever had anesthetic and I said oh yeah every chance I get and he said he said what's it like I said oh man that's the best part of having surgery I said you just try real hard to count to 10 when they when they give you that anesthetic I said if you can count to 10 I'll give you 10 cents I said you won't be able to do it and I said they you'll be asleep during the whole thing and so he came through fine and we're thankful for that he's home and recovering and we're very thankful for that so we appreciate that sister Becky is with him tonight so she's not here and uh she wanted to spend as much time as she could with Henry and Lord willing if possible she may come tomorrow uh and be here for the afternoon the banquet so uh we'll we'll just see whether she gets to make it or not I wanted to say this about Retreat I I'm I assume you've probably heard the rules right yeah Riot Act and uh and the one thing I like to reiterate is you know you don't want to wander off a night cuz it's dark and there's not many things will hurt you but bears bears will kill you so don't wor don't mess with the bears but I think it's really important for all of us to to use the retreat as a retreat and use it as a time where you know you kind of step back from uh the Mad pace of things and hey our world is going nuts our world is changing it's different than it was last year and uh you know there's several major trips this year one to Israel that we're supposed to do in November and one in Africa and December and you know things getting cancelled and and there's less less movement it's less safe to travel and it's because our world's falling apart and so things are different and it's really nice to take time in meetings like this to retreat and just step away a little bit from the maddening pace and all the demands that you have in life and just spend that time not only with your friends and Associates but spend that time alone with God and this is one of those meetings where you can do that and we like to build in time for you to do that come early before service or linger a little bit afterwards uh we have great U ministers here you can talk with if there's a need and use it as a retreat don't don't just uh don't just get drawn into the pace of things use it as a time where you can just step back from uh from ordinary things and and just have that communion with God and that's a that's a uh a rare opportunity these days because uh there's not many times through the year when we're able to do that so it's it's really nice to take advantage of that this is always a special time of year for me because uh December 23rd I celebrated my 44th year of being a Christian and December 23rd 1979 I gave my heart to the Lord I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in December outside and it was cold and uh I my my only regret after all of these 44 years my only regret and I have one is that I didn't do it early earlier I would have loved to have done it earlier and gotten a few more years in uh because now that I'm 45 you know it's that's a bit of a regret but I will tell you this it's I've enjoyed every moment of it I'd do it all again if I could and wouldn't hesitate and uh it's been it's been a wonderful Journey wonderful experience and so we welcome all of you here and uh it's just U an honor to have you with us and to be able to enjoy what we're going to go through over this uh weekend here but without any further Ado we're going to invite brother Sam to come and 10 years ago we invited Brother Sam to come for the first time and he ministered here for us and it was just a real blessing just a fit just a real fit and he ministered so well to the young people we thought wow what a great resource to have and um we we want to give Brother Sam his Liberty tonight he's going to do two services and this is the second one and so we want to let him have his have his way but you you got to remember now that you're half the gift right so you got to pull and you got to be sitting there saying Lord I don't know what that Minister has got in his notes and stuff but I know that you are greater than his notes and you can pull him in a direction right down my street and have him speak to my heart and Lord I'm asking for this and I'm asking for that specifically and that's what you should do Hey Brother brandom taught us to ask big because your asking is not bigger than God so you should ask big and ask for for things that you may consider to be impossible but With God all things are possible right we believe that let's stand to our feet tonight God bless you all let's sing that little uh chorus I have a maker and he knows my name I think it's key of F I think it is but you're the music man so uh let's sing it here that's going to stick I have a maker and he knows my name you got to believe that tonight you got to believe that he knows mind he knows he knows what I'm going through he knows what I left when I left home he knows what I'm struggling with and he knows the questions that I have in my heart even before I asked them am so make this your prayer tonight as Brother Sam comes I have a maker he formed my heart and be before even time began my life was in his hands he knows my my name yes he does and he knows my every thought yes Lord Jesus and he sees each tear that falls oh and he hears me when I call sing this that I have a father Yes you Lord Jesus he calls me his own he said he never leave me and he'll never leave no matter where I go ring it out now yes he knows my he knows my name and he knows she say take your Liberty I'll take it back when you're done you keep it as long as you want [Music] to that falls and he hears me when I call and he hears me with one more time oh he hears me with I call Hallelujah aren't you glad for that so thankful for his Mercy once again God's given us another opportunity to man another day to serve him and uh I just certainly want to say I I just have so enjoyed the the sessions that were already here this morning and it's just you know it's always unique when I I step back and sometimes I know the uh Brethren around me too that are are ministers you go into a meeting and you haven't conversed with other brothers what what are you studying on what what are you looking at but I you just sat there and you watch how God is putting things together even with certain words and things and you I don't know to me I just stand in awe and say who could do this but God who could do it with God and and if you see how God is so mindful of every detail like that he does that because he's showing you and me he cares amen he's mindful aren't you glad for that tonight amen we just want to just uh as we prepare to look into the word here I want to say it's just certainly been an honor we'll continue to be here and certainly looking forward to brother Jack and tonight God gives me Grace I'm done but I ask you would you pray with me tonight and I it's such an honor to be here I I really I enjoy being with you new faces this time some familiar faces and uh but you're just the cream of the crop and we love you anything we can ever do for you we certainly would do it amen could we just pray together and like that last words of the song we sang he hears me when I call let's just go to the Lord in pray pray Heavenly Father Lord how thankful Lord that confidence that we have Lord that indeed you hear us when we call Lord we're approaching the Throne of Mercy we're approaching Lord as Paul would write the throne of grace that we might find help in the time of trouble Lord we're coming in that alls sufficient name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ where every question is settled where every doubt is dismissed and Lord where everything that we have need of rests and lays for us Lord we just ask Lord here this evening as we would just come into the word just to take a few more moments today I pray that God that you would just anoint us together not just not just myself all Al though I need it greatly Lord but I'm asking that you would anoint this congregation Lord father anoint us to see beyond what we see Lord anoint us to think beyond what we think Lord oh God may your grace just come by as your Prophet said grace us with your grace may you Lord take control Lord oh God I I need you tonight Lord these young people need you Lord Lord we can do absolutely nothing without you lord you're the only one that can solve Lord these needs Lord and you've already made a way for it I just ask Lord that you would just help me to know Lord and to follow you tonight Lord God let me get out of the way Lord that it can just be you Lord and what needs to be said let it be said Lord that you might in all things Lord receive the glory Lord let us know when we you said enough Lord granted Lord we pray father have your way Among Us Lord just pour out of your spirit for every need we pray and we give you the thanks in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen well if you'll turn with me let's go back to the Book of Jonah and U I want to say it is an honor to stand here and the confidence I I don't take that lightly that brother Paul and brother Barry would would would ask us to stand here and brother Paul and brother Barry I i' certainly they certainly are are pillars in my life and have certainly been instrumentally used of the Lord and just so appreciate the the friendship and and the confidence Jonah chapter 2 and um if you bear with me here I just want to read um just a few verses of scripture here and we'll just start right there with verse one the Bible said then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice for thou had us cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods compassed me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped around or about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with her bars was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainteth within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities for forsake their own Mercy going to read that one again they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy if anyone had the poetic license to say this statement he did right they that observe look at focus on lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land just like to take just a simple thought here tonight looking at the right thing looking at the right thing may God bless you bless the reading the word as you're being seated as we were looking at it last night that Jonah he was headed in the direction away from the presence of the Lord he didn't feel like that they would hear him him being a Jew the prophet said that in his thinking he looked at it and said I'm a Jew they're a gentile they'll never receive what I'm about to say but you you know anytime that God calls you and I to do something or even as God draws upon your heart as we looked at last night God is not looking at our human ability that's one of the greatest things that gets in our way time and time again it's something that we constantly have to deal with I I don't know about you but when when I was growing up my mom it was just in our country house it was kind of a habit to have rugs when you came in the door and rugs around the kitchen but they weren't the kind of rugs that you could really wipe your feet on they were meant to collect dirt but you know you ever had one of those rugs you go to wipe your feet on it and it seems like it wants to follow you all the way through the place sometimes there's things that when we look at it there that in our life that what God has has called us to do and it seems like that well I I just don't think that this will happen I I don't think that this will come in this way but it's always that human ability and human ability is much like that rug I described we've constantly have to master the thought of human ability in our lives and it's things that even in your coming to serve the Lord It's mastering that thought of ability it's not about what you can do you and yourself can never perfect yourself you can never live in your own self a perfect life this is why we needed a perfect sacrifice that his life could be offered up that that perfect life could be released to you and I and then Perfection would be begin on the inside and work its way to the outside ultimately with the change of our body God has made a way for that so even when God has come to do a full work in your life uh where he's changed your very desires changed your nature yet you realize of the imperfection that lays around you but there's a perfection in your life of God's desire that's working and and that's where you're drawing your strength from when you're facing the ch challenges and what you're called to do the responsibilities things that you're to face up to and it's always something that uh is always so much uh right around us and uh when we look at this of the thought of looking at looking at the right things I think it's very important that we are looking at the right things uh because we can look at a lot of things that might seem factual they might seem very uh truthful but remember what what Paul wrote to you and I the things that we're to think on are not just things are just true it's not just it's not it's not that's not the only attribute with it but it has to have virtue in it it has to have praise in it it has to be of a good report all of these things are are Avenues or things for you and I to look and to judge everything by I tell you I I just thought when brother rap was ministering there this morning I thought well we might as well just go ahead and say all right for the night's service but uh you know when you look at at these things how God come and turn Jonah's Direction around and I believe right here even tonight or even last night how God has come by our way there's direction that God has turned in your heart from where you looking at something as maybe an impossibility or this cannot be and God just breathing upon your life to where there there Comes A A refreshing there comes a strengthening there is coming before you a fresh Vision to where you are not looking upon yourself as a defeated subject but you begin to see there indeed is victory for me that I can be a partaker of and so when I I look at this of how that God even of things that you know we've we've had things in our life that didn't turn out the way we thought it was going to turn out and sometimes when things are don't turn out the way we've got it figured out well you know sometimes we get disappointed and you know it's we we need to be uh strengthened and and encouraged and I think about the disciples they were walking on the road to emus and my they you know their whole thing was we thought that he should have been the one and indeed he was but it just it it wasn't they didn't have it figured out the way that God had already had it laid out in the scripture and sometimes the way that we figure things out can lead to that moment or a time of discouragement it's just like you know here you come to a camp and maybe this is your second third Camp of the year or whatever more and there's things that you have expected and no doubt God has dealt with your heart drawn upon your heart and you said maybe you came to the altar maybe you were right there in your seat maybe you prayed with a counselor and you looked and you thought I I I just I I believe it's settled right now or I believe there's things you know that I'll never have any problems anymore I'll never have any issues and then you find out there's still struggles there's still battle and then if you're not careful you'll walk away in a moment of discouragement but just because it didn't happen the way you thought it ought to happen does not mean that you're to throw away any experience that you ever receive from God every experience from God is just that it's god making known his love and his care God does not waste his time giving you an experience you might say well brother Samuel I know that I haven't had the depth of experience in my life well don't throw away all those other experiences because remember the baptism of the Holy Ghost is more of the same Spirit coming into your life the prophet would say it in another way it's more of the same Grace it's God going deeper in our lives and he will do that as we will allow him and invite him you know the Bible says it like this God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble goes on to say humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you like how the prophet when brother Brandon would take this in the in the message you know preaching he cares do you he's brother Brown when he preaches this message you see let me just let me just take my time here just a moment when I'm looking here at the message and I I look at the scope of things when the prophet after the opening of the seals he's seeing a condition among the people where he says it seems like he says if if the message would have come like this in method in in in Luther's day or Wesley's day he said they just took what they had and went with and he says it it kind it seems like we just sit around and we have a thought and say wonder if it could be me wonder if it could be talking about me and brother bramy takes that in the message prisoner and he says now the Lord has given me something to address that and he preaches the following Sunday he cares do you care and brother Brion would take that now he's already preached he carth for you along the same thought line back in 1960 but here he is ministering this and let me just say this to you this message is not the ideas of William brandham it's not William branham's thoughts it's clearly expressed brother B says it this is the expressed thoughts of Jehovah and I want to remind you what God thought of you before there was atom Stardust or molecule he hasn't changed his mind there's nothing you've done that's changed his mind God always has his thought and his thought it might be beneath Darkness it might be beneath failure but his thought is still his thought it's Eternal and God always harvests his word you can spray paint it you can graffiti it you can put everything else over it but you cannot destroy the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about where Satan would try to take even in my life raised raised right in a church my daddy a pastor and even of things that was taking place in my life in circumstances and places that I would not even want to address here or call out but I could finish quotes when I was half out of my mind how did I do that because I've heard them but what I'm trying to tell you is is that it had to be something deeper than just kn the message it had to be something deeper than just hearing about it let me tell you we're not here under an affiliation we're not here just to associate around the message we're here to get into the message we're here to get into the word of God and let the word of God so saturate our lives and change us and bring out of us what God intended for you and I to be that's the purpose of God calling us together that's the burden when God give a burdens brother Barry said 31 years ago that burden did not come just from origination of of Brethren sitting down and hammering things out that burden came from almighty God to put it in their hearts that you and I might be benefited from this word oh how God cares and the prophet would bring it down in this message and speak to you and I showing us God's care you know it's one thing for somebody to tell you I care about you or I love you but this is why when God said don't just let it be in word or deed God manifested his love toward us he expressed his love and not just has or in the past but he has made known to you and I not by going to Calvary again but by opening up that way that had been veiled off from man and making himself known to you that the same almighty God that came down and walked the shores of Galilee has been revealed again in this end time and he's made himself known to you and I and dealing with your heart as though you're the only one setting in this room and your thoughts are on that screen only God can do that and he does it not to shame us he does it to let us know he cares about us I know you and if he cares so much for that I think we should care if he cared enough to vindicate this word I think we should care brother Bram said it like this he made a way that we might care I that that statement to me just sends me around the worlds he made a way that we might care if he hadn't made a way there's no way you could care but he made a way that we can sit here tonight and care about these things care about our life to take the word of God and let it be and reflect upon it in our life but here's how we care about it is we're got to be sincere about it to be sincere about the things be sincere about the word because he already cared enough to conquer every enemy for us let me just say it like this me just let me just kind of moving here into this thought of of Jonah and here the prophet would say it like this cuz I'm sure that in this room right here setting and gathered there's not one person in here that is free from failure and free from mistakes and that's one of the areas that Satan would like to trap you on before you've received the Holy Ghost and after you receive the Holy Ghost because just because you've received the Holy Spirit this guy did not get born again out here I'm not making an excuse I know where I'm standing but God gives you strength that then what happens there's a growing on the inside the prophet said it's Christ in you pressing his way out now think about this brother BR said I got a lot of respects for a man when he does make a mistake he's got courage enough to rise and try again we're all going to make mistakes the best makes mistakes but a soldier is not one who will lay down when he's knocked down but will rise up again he said oh God In Prayer we're all guilty of doing things wrong we are gathered here tonight along with the rest of the great visible Body of Christ here on Earth may we rise and try again he goes on to say in another message and you you've heard this here here A Man shows up to get a job interview I think well how how arrogant he shows up with a pencil without an eraser I don't know about you but when I was in school I carried one of them separate erasers too you know them nice pink ones and then then we got some doodads that you know you could push out and they would come out like that and you could hold them I because the Eraser on the pencil wasn't enough I'm glad that God's given us more than enough this man showed up and Mr Ballard said you don't have no eraser Well I don't he said no he said I don't make any mistakes Mr Ballard said then I can't use you cuz you ain't going to do nothing if we don't make mistakes were not doing anything but what I like about a person listen to a Vindicated Prophet what I like about a person is that when you make a mistake a real Soldier is ready to rise and try again and another place any good soldier is apt to get wounded or hurt so sometimes it's a mistake failure sometimes it's a wound sometimes it's a hurt but what are we going to do do about it Lord let me rise and try again listen the greatest thing that we can do in the presence of God is just simply be honest Lord I need you let me rise and try again Lord I I want a fresh chance brother Samuel is he the god of Second Chances he's the god of third chances seventh chances 10th chances he's the god that gives you chance after chance after chance because he's not going to give up on his word you might say I've been in service after service and it seems like it keeps coming down my pathway that's God and God's letting you know he's not giving up on you he's not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that she should repent he did not make a mistake when he brought you here upon this Earth you're not an experiment to God you're here by Design God has work Illustrated it that you're here by Design now these things that we've just spoke about I say let's be Godlike let's be Godlike because when the fall took place in Eden God didn't just W it up and say that was a nice try but he came down and you know what he didn't even send an angel he came himself let me tell you he comes right to your life comes right to where you're at he don't send somebody else he comes to where you're at Jonah was here in the belly of a well but like we read last night whether shall I flee from thy presence oh God God was right there everywhere that he turned God was right there in the boat in the ship and that's why the prophet could say until you face responsibility you will be missed miserable brother Samuel why am I trying and failing let me just give you just a simple simple statement it's called surrender I don't say that demeaning only but I would say it in this way God help me to come to a full surrender help me Lord to lay down my will lay down my life Lord help me to come to that place Lord of surrender and to continue to surrender what brother rap was ministering on in the second service it may not have seemed very spiritual but you know many times it's the carnal things that we allow to get in the way jobs of the trustees at church not a real spiritual job but if they don't take care of the property watch out and make sure the light bills paid make sure everything is set where you going to have church at so sometimes the things that we discount or say oh it's minor if God intended when you got the holy ghost that you no longer needed any teaching he wouldn't have put it in the word cuz he didn't put it in the word for unbelievers or make Believers he put it in the word for you and me who are believers order my steps in thy word oh lord well that was free Godlike courage I say we God need some get up in us watch this brother Bram said in the great sculptor when he saw the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing to just leave it lay there face down in ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated he went to work immediately and be to build again until his own image a man so that word the word of God it's Unstoppable you can't hinder you can't stop the word of God the word of God will come to pass and is coming to pass do you realize we're sitting right here even when the wars themselves God will only allow encroachment of Wars to go so far to a certain place until why until every one of his children are sealed into the kingdom even in armer day they still don't understand how did that war get stopped 11th month 11th day 11th Hour still don't know I tell you it was because you and me you and I we were not on the scene yet but God in his grace and mercy saw us our names were in the Lamb's Book of Life God was mindful that you and I would be in a service like this tonight he knew you would be here Desiring his Mercy Desiring the Holy Ghost Desiring deliverance and he made a way that you could receive what The Thirst is longing for in your life I don't care how much when you've one walked away or whatever that you've said you can't get away from the plan and program of God God hunts you down all the failures all the mistakes of His prophets never stop the word of God when Moses failed and ran into the Wilderness God didn't throw in the town and think here this goes again I mean he already had Noah God didn't look at Abraham when he told the second line think come on man and you know as we said last night God didn't try to polish up people's lives he could have done it he could have edited and made it just so pristine but you and I would have looked at those lives and that's why the prophet could say he said I never could understand how Abraham being a prophet could do thing like that he said but then I got to understanding he that was done and God had it recorded that you and I might know the grace of almighty God all along our journey we need God's grace oh my now you see look how brother BR describes this with the Eagles I love this statement out of the message and Eagles teth her nest brother R says them little Eagles when they begin to fly look how Mama Eagle take them out there she will holler that that southern for speaking loudly she'll holler flop your wings children just keep flopping your little faith up and down you're high enough now that you won't hit the Earth you know what then what she does she darts out to one side to watch them she sails right around and here they are just exactly like a Pentecostal Revival Topsy turby one over another just flopping to all they can act they don't care they got supreme confidence in their mamy that's out there watching them did you hear what he said their their confidence is not in their wings their confidence is in their mother she wouldn't have taken them out there if she didn't have confidence in them God knows what's inside of you and when God has brought you here in this generation God has given a message to you God himself has confidence in his seed in his word that's in you brother Samuel but I failed that's not what God was looking at I love how brother brandom I don't know who brother Mike is one day we get to the other side Lord willing I'll meet him but question answer is 1959 brother br look over he said Thank of it brother Mike he said God chose us before the foundation of the world knowing every mistake we would ever make you should have some Elbow Room right now brother B said now how ought the church do if one of them little Eagles got out of balance she sweeps right down with them big wings picks him up bears him up into Grace uh again wow not giving up so it brings him right back up shakes him off again and let him start a new them Eagles has got confidence in their mother Supreme confidence that that mother will help them and bear them up again you'll bear them up on wings of an eagle and take them there shake them off and let them start again God's Got Confidence God is not one let's just put this straight God is not the one who rubs anyone's nose in the dirt for failing he's never been guilty of that God does not come to point out all your failures when his presence comes our failures are made known many times we already know our failures but when his presence come his presence is to draw us out into a place above our failures that we can see his grace coming to you and I and not looking at our failures as long as you look at your failures and your mistakes you're looking at the wrong thing let me just say this God's not a quitter oh he knew what he was getting himself into when he got a hold of my life God wouldn't like me when I get into a project and all of a sudden at home and I realize I really did need a plumber yeah I I needed one I was going to save a few dollars here brother W's budget sheet and you realize I've got myself into a bigger situation than what I can handle but God has never got himself into a situation that he's not bigger and greater that's why I like that song My God Is Bigger oh my think of this you know Jonah he was in the situation he was in you know maybe tonight the reason we're here maybe the situation you're in maybe you didn't do what God told you to do you know brother B will make a statement about choices and you know you think about a choice right here tonight but you know brother BR would take a statement and say the choice that you make tonight will affect where you'll be five years from now I mean you you see the difference is like we look at the the painting that of the Last Supper the man that was chosen to represent and and he painted of the Lord Jesus he used him just five years just a period of time I think I don't know if it was five years or just months down the road but then he needed somebody to paint as Judas it end up being the same person because of choices that individual made and the effect it had upon his life you see Satan himself he everything that he does every trap that he sets this is why he does it is to try to get you in a place of isolation you no longer want to be around your family you want to go hide in your bedroom you want to go isolate why it's condemnation and it's Satan that's trying to pin you in a corner and God's letting you know hey there is great for you there is Grace that is sufficient if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us brother Samuel you don't know how many times I'm repentant get back up and repent again don't lay there get back up you're not a quitter I know I'm speaking to young men and young women tonight that maybe you are deliberating about coming to this Camp you already paid your fees but maybe you've deliberated about it but there's something in you moving you that's greater than your own determination brother Samuel it sounds like you've got a lot of confidence in the word I do I've got a lot of confidence in almighty God it's God who's watching over his word it's God that's aligning things God when he comes he comes to minister love courage courage and ability he don't come to tear you down Brother Sam why are you saying this because I'm trying to help you to see God does not come in with thoughts in your mind to tear you down you'll never hear God where God has ever spoke to somebody in the scripture and called him a failure never even when the 10 spies God never even called them failures they believe that lie oh my think about it even within in Joshua and Moses God told God told Joshua he wanted him to know this there's no man going to be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee B says it like this he says if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me I don't have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try let me just say this to you I put it in my own words and then I'll quote Churchill success is not permanent failure is temporary are you hearing me Brother Sam how does that how does that how does that relate well look when Israel went into the land they had to fight there was battles the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has come I it's not come that we sit down in a nice recliner drink sweet tea and everything's finished you've been equipped for battle there's molding and shaping in your character there is possessions to be taken every moment of your life it's a it's a fight it's a battle but it's worth it they won it Jericho but right after Jericho they went to AI artificial intelligence I don't they went to AI but they carried a little something with them that was hidden a little wedge of gold a little patterning of the world of Babylonian G just a little patterning like the world brought feet and Joshua himself didn't throw up his hands and say my goodness I must have just been all blown up here I must just been out of my mind I I don't know what happened I mean we had one good one good campaign but he knew his confidence was in the word of God and listen your confidence my confidence has got to be in the word of God your confidence is not in your success it's not in your failure your confidence is in the word of God La those Little Eagles but God gave them a way back and so the success they had at Jericho like when you leave out of these meetings the success that you experience even in your daily life I know there's young people sitting right here that has that has completely surrendered your life and you know what I'm talking about as well everybody does where you can come out of having there such a successful moment a successful time and you know if you're not careful you'll let down your guard and the moment you let down your guard that's just what Satan was wanting and then you want to step back and look on and say well was was there something that that really took place did I really have success yes Jericho was a success but that is only something that it's not permanent you've got to keep walking with God Church Hill said it like this Success is Not final failure is not fatal I like that it's the courage to continue that counts I'm not lifting Churchill up but these are things that men have said even when Churchill would stand in a great time of War got to looking at this success and failure and mistakes talking about being knocked down I mean no one no one like to be knocked down remember as brother Bram I just read you some of these quotes it's it's it's not about if you just get knocked down do you get back up and there was a man one time when you just to look it up of who was knocked down the most like boxing who was knocked down the most back in 1909 there was a fighter by the name of Joe Janette who was knocked down 27 times in a match fought 40 9 rounds lasted three and 1 half hours longest match that's ever been he actually in one round was hit and it looked like he was going to be out for the count but he got back up eventually his opponent in the 49th round would not come out of his corner and said he'd had enough Joe Janette was knocked down 27 times What mattered was is he got back up it ain't about how many times you've been knocked down get back up let's look at the right thing God given you and I strength to get back up let's just look at a few people Abraham Lincoln only one to go to a war as a captain and in the middle of that war going out to battle it comes back in from the Army demoted to a private woo that's real elevating for self-esteem Abraham Lincoln how many times did he fail running for political office multiple times and finally here he is standing as the President of the United States this is what he said my great concern is not whether you have failed but whether you are content with your failure Babe Ruth I know this is quoted a lot for the young sisters Babe Ruth was a chunky baseball player he's known for the home runs that he hit he hit 714 home runs but he struck out 1,330 times the strikeouts is not what's highlighted it's the home runs brother Samuel I need some scripture when God got over into the New Testament he never recorded Abraham's failures you know why cuz it can't make it through the blood and when you confess your failures you've confessed your sin when you've confessed your mistakes even in the natural of life like even what brother rap was presenting him that second time when you confess it then God's grace moves down into your life and you know what it's not on record it's not on record Michael Jordan individual that basketball player won multiple Awards NBA championships I I'm just referring to a couple of these things but you know he didn't even make the varsity team when he tried out for in his sophomore year a man that has all these accolades but he didn't make it you know this is something that as I I go on to read about that this is what he said about it it was embarrassing not making the team he said he went home and he locked himself in his room and he cried then he picked himself up and turned the cut into a motivation whenever I was working out he said and I got tired and I figured I ought to stop I'd close my eyes and see that list in the locker room without my name on it that usually got me going again you see he wasn't looking at that list in a terms of defeat he had a confidence when he felt like giving up that's when he went the extra mile let me just tell you something right now there's times that you don't feel like praying but that's the times you got to press through there's times you don't feel like reading times you don't feel like going to church times you may not feel like sitting down and reading in the scriptures but let me tell you something don't let your feelings dictate your life we're living in an age where everything's about feelings well I felt this way or I felt this way your feelings will lie to you and it takes for us to press beyond that I say God give us Grace to press beyond our feelings all of us Walt Disney you brother Brown will quote this one I didn't say woke Disney I said Walt Disney this is old school this is not woke Disney Walt Disney he was fired from his job at a newspaper because they said he lacked imagination and had no good ideas imagine if he had believed that you know there was a man by the name of Einstein his daddy told him he wasn't smart there's no doubt there's been some things that you've heard or things that's been whispered your way but God comes to encourage you and let you know you don't have to dwell there that's not who you are he opens up an animation studio after a period of time it eventually goes banket R brother BR said how he kept on going he said but eventually he said now he said when he came to see that little mouse in the garage and he drew that little comic he said now he's a multi-millionaire this is what I want you to catch why why was that because he had something in his hand and he knew he held it he know he could do it and that's the way every great achievement is made when men and women have something in their hand that they know they can do it and you have something in your hand God encouraging you I I think if there's one thing that we should come to that resolve and ask God for his Mercy that the only quit that should be in US is I am going to quit letting Satan have any rule over any area of my life he listen the mind is no man's land it'll only be filled with what you or I allow it to be filled with sometimes you wonder why you feel in defeat you wonder why you don't have the strength you've got to look at what you've been feeding on if you don't look at the right things feed on the right things you realize if you don't feed your experience in you it will dwindle you've got to feed your experience on the word of God I'm sure every one of us in here there's times where there are things fixed that may not be your favorite meal I don't know that's how it was when I was growing up there's still certain things I mean my wife you know I meals are an important thing to me when I finish one I want to know what's coming for next why want to be under expectation motivation for the next meal but you know sometimes there there's things where I can look at and she'll say we're having soup now listen this is just me this ain't Doctrine it ain't nothing spiritual about this but just a point soup to me belongs with salad before the meal but I've learned to eat soup and so sometimes when it get I I listen I love winter time I like snow and things like that but there's one thing about wintertime that I'm not too fond of is soup now there's some soups that my wife has made that she she's really hit it there I I I like it a lot the zupa Tuscana all those my Lord I mean some of those things my I got to stay focused here there's some of those things right there that it's kind of helped me but you know what I'm trying to say is there's things about it that sometimes that maybe you're not rejoicing or I'm not rejoicing about man I'm really ready and going to sit down for dinner there's times in in your flesh and in your life that it might seem like when you're setting even in service what does this have to do for me where is this at in my life rather sit there and say God I'm going to press Beyond where my thoughts are at right now I'm not going to let my thoughts take me hostage and away from the house of God that I miss what you have for me hope we're not having souit tonight just easy every area of my life I'm going to quit looking at my failures and at my mistakes coming back to our text where Jonah said I'm cast out of thy sight but yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple no matter the circumstances Jonah had a confidence in a word that Solomon had prayed under inspiration and he knew that was the word of God no matter the circumstance that he was in and he makes this statement which we read and we read from it twice in verse eight of Jonah 2 they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy that word observe is to keep to guard to give heed to to watch over to treasure up in memory this is why the scripture when we can look at things as he's saying forsake those that observe lying van in other words give them time give them place like what brother rap was presenting here in the morning service there's things at times that are presented facts it might be a fact right here tonight that you're battling pornography it might be a fact in your life that there's things that you've battled from a childhood those are facts but it's not the truth they're lying vanities it's Satan's objective to however that trap was laid however those things got started even the stumblings that can be in your life and Satan wants you to observe that he would love to keep you just like brother rap gave that example tonight at the end of a service where there was something there that it seems like he didn't understand what was being said but he begin to look to the Holy Temple he begin to reflect on what God had done for his life I am saved I am filled with the Holy Ghost you see you've got to stand on your experience that God has given you in your life even your failures if you've Fallen if you trapped well I really thought I was delivered of this just because you have fallen and made a mistake doesn't mean that you weren't delivered I'm going to preach now it's still there's battles that's all around you you're still going to be tempted you're still going to be tested but just because you're tempted and because feelings want to sweep over you does not mean that you're not delivered but you've got to stand there submit yourself to God and resist the devil and he'll flee from from you that's your god-given word well brother Samuel I've heard it preach where you can't make no mistake I'm preaching the word of God and this right here while you live in this flesh you will have to continually bring it subject to the word of God this is why when it says in the word casting down imaginations remember what what are you doing look let me just read the scripture casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled you see it comes back to what what's your desire what's your desire in your heart listen if your desire is still within for the things of the world then you need to invite God to go deeper you see you still you need to say God I want to go deeper say well brother Samuel sometimes you know well I have pools out here but I know what my desire is in here listen you have to bring everything things subject to the word of God if the desire in your heart is Lord I just want to please you Lord I love you you're standing upon that word you're bringing then it's to bring every thought that is coming into subjection to that on the inside brother Bram says he says here's here comes a man and he says he's walking down the street and somebody says he said you're singing a song and they say look at that Holy Roller brother Bram say says the first thing is the thought comes to your flesh get even with him then he says from the flesh it goes to the spirit your flesh and your spirit are not your buddies they're not your buddies then he said the spirit suggested to the soul let's get even with him but the soul will reain out and say vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord see that's why you want to make sure you're feeding that white dog you want to make sure that you're feeding your experience come on friends sometimes our failures and our mistakes is not any lack on God's part it's our part where we have failed to feed on the word of God brother B goes on with that same example talks about a woman going by all he moves with that example now I want you to think about this in the message voice of a sign brother BR says now here's what I want you to do he says I want you to take every unbelief you've got and every unreasonable thought and lay it down on the floor and put your foot on it and say Lord Jesus I'm going to believe you take every thought of unbelief every unreasonable thought and put it on the ground and put your foot on it and say Lord I'm going to believe that clip that brother rat showed there of that sister brother Paul came back around and was speaking what gave that validity or seemingly made it somewhat valid or something that that sister would even entertain see Satan wants to do it so that in a way you'll entertain it you'll entertain the thought that sister was not a witch but in her thinking she had entertained that thought that seemingly came from a credible source and that had affected her in her health in her body it had affected it it had there had been an effect through the whole church listen that's the same way that the enemy can come to you with your failures and your mistakes and want to present it as though this is who you are but that's not who you are failures and mistakes yeah there's a lot of facts if you could say like that the other other example brother rap was referring to when brother Bram stood by that bedside and how Satan came up next to him and he said you seen it on the screen this morning everything that he said was the truth reasoning everything that Satan had come right up there and said was the truth there's a lot of things that he said concerning you as far as you can say well he's right about that he's right about that I I've got a problem here or I've got an issue here but what's greater than that is the truth of God's word concerning your life facts mean nothing in the face of the truth of almighty God do you realize brother brandom said that the devil is nothing but a password to a man that'll stand and accept God's word you know a password is it's to keep you out of something I could give you my iPad and you could try and try and they probably lock it up we couldn't get into it why even though there is all sorts of contents in here messages and everything that I have but if you don't have the password you can't get into this right here and the prophet puts it in such simple terms that the Devil Himself is a password what opens that up is to accept what God has done for you to accepted the 10 spies you you know the story they looked at the Giants all they could see was Giants that's all they saw all they could talk about was Giants that's all that's it became their whole conversation all they could all they could see was this of the impossibilities but here came two men back that though they saw the Giants and let me just tell you something God didn't God didn't rebuke the 10 spies for them talking about Giants God's not asking us to pretend that we don't have problems he's not asking you to make believe well well I really don't have anything no that's not how it works but God's asking you when you see this recognize greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world is that right David and Goliath my goodness all Israel was was was afraid of Goliath they were looking and he was a champion he was a warrior but David chose to look at the right thing David said I'm circumcised he's uncircumcised I've got a covenant he don't have a covenant David looked at the right thing while the rest of them all they could see was his size me tell you the circumstances in your life right now the size may seem so overwhelming but just say God just release Lord a pulsation in My Heart Lord help me to see see it Lord as you see it let me just try to come here to the place of closing our symptoms REM says oh if we can get away from our symptoms they're lying vanities he said say to them I won't believe you anymore Jesus Christ has healed me when he died at Calvary you tell me I have to keep smoking cigarettes you can put whatever you want to put in there you tell me I have to keep smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey you're a liar I refuse to see it I look to your Holy Temple Lord where Jesus the son of God stands at the right end of the father making intercessions for me they're lying vanities don't receive them you realize when the Bible tells us of how important and Power powerful our confession is it says consider Jesus Christ the Apostle of our profession which is our confession consider the high priest and Apostle of our profession you realize how important it is to confess what God has done for you listen this is not mine it's not mind over matter brother B says if you can take a promise and you begin to take that promise he said and he says it even like this he says if all the further you can receive it is just mentally he said take it in your mind and begin to repeat it over and over say it out loud sometimes we we you see sometimes it's way we we want things in a certain way listen friends I believe with all my heart that God is here to do for you and I what we have need of I believe that I believe God is working all the way through in every one of these services and I believe with all my heart that when we look at this that we could have such an assurance that if maybe I don't see what I want to see right now but I've seen God's word and I'm going to stand on that word I'm going to confess it until it's made manifest in my life it works the same way with healing brother brand said it works the same way with salvation you confess it and he said you watch it work righteousness when God does something for you whether it's any devotion any session confess what God has done for you begin to thank him for what he's done for you when he's dropped a word your way and it's something that you know that man don't know nothing about me God knows me God knows about my circumstance take that word and begin to thank God for your healing thank God God for your deliverance brother Samuel I'm wanting the Holy Ghost thank God for the Holy Ghost it's a sure promise when they went back to Jerusalem they didn't go back sad the Bible said they went full of joy because they knew what God made a promise he would pour out the holy spirit that God indeed will fulfill his word every time this is why the prophet would say it over and over he says don't have a negative testimony it's a miracle in this age everything is negative everything I mean Medias all around us is all negative things flying thoughts will come in and you you and I cannot stop the thoughts from coming in but we can stop them from remaining there brother BR says when you begin to say I'm not a very good Christian I've got weak Faith he said you're talking talk in the devil's language when you begin to speak and to confess it that way then you're talking his language always have a positive confession I am saved I belong to the Lord the Holy Ghost is mine I'm a Child of God let me just let me just turn it here one point I want to come to here sometimes there's things that can be emotional bondage that looks very real and it is our feelings feelings are real then nobody nobody makes light of that from events and circumstances just like when we talked about sister Georgie Carter last night re gives an example of a sister how that she had been healed of heart trouble as a young lady and then brother Bram tells us she had a different kind of a heart trouble later on in her life and the Heart trouble that she had is it okay if I just read this part said last night she had a different type of a heart trouble it was a spiritual heart trouble her lover had run off and married some other woman and yet she was still in love this is how powerful that words are emotions and words that can be exchanged she was still in love and this boy was telling that he telling her that he was still in love with her and his father is what caused it to where that he got married to this other girl brother brandham said oh nonsense oh nonsense he didn't have to marry that other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you but notice he says being all wound up into that the girl sat there in such a stoop oh Johnny loves me I know he does that's all she could see she lived in that one little world by herself she had formed herself in there the B said I took a hold of her hand and said listen to me the Lord showed a vision that she know I didn't know nothing about something had taken place some transaction between them and when that was said that snapped her right quick and I said while you're out from there look to Calvary says you're going out here and you're starting to drink what was she trying to do drowned it why it hurt emotional trying to drown it sometimes your drowning may not be drinking you might be trying to drown your failures in just now absorbing more and more and more and more content but you'll never find the peace and relief in that but there is a God I I don't know how I don't know what your situation is but there's a God just as he snapped out this young lady broke that spiritual Veil that she couldn't see out of that world that she was formed that had been formed around of her life but God in a moment revealed something that had taken place that she knew only the other person and it would have to be God that would know this it snapped her right out of it and at that moment the direction was look to Calvary I'd say right here tonight in these moments that we have where God's come by we're going to pray here in a moment but what God has come come by and would deliver his word and speak to our hearts to break that Veil maybe it's a veil of doubt maybe it's that Veil let me just tell you what it is it's a spirit but greater is he that's in you greater is the spirit of Jesus Christ that's Among Us than that Spirit or that Veil that would want to hold you back he's greater and he loves you and he cares about you and in that moment if you can just just look to him even to invite him to say Lord break this over my life Lord and invite him to come and let's look at the right thing let's let's invite him he's here he's here he's here to move for us he's here to do for us I friends listen there was just even a testimony was given to me here after the one of the other services of a sister that was here last night thought she was going to have to leave the service and go back to her room because of stomach condition and she said something was mentioned I don't I don't remember mentioning anything about stomach condition but something was said that it just something that God spoke that it resonated and it was gone I I can't help it but I walked away from here I said God there's if you cared about stomach conditions which he does God cares about whatever your need is I I believe there's been things dismissed right while the word's being preached I know that but as I stand here tonight I also know that if there's needs that's even where you feel in your heart that there's not a settledness I'd say this is an opportunity while you are away at a moment of retreat while God is giving you Grace to step away from the circumstance and the situation why God himself has breathed in courage for you to stand and say yes I will rise and try again I'm going to look even though I'm in this situation I will look again once again to thy Holy Temple oh god let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord just pieces Lord I Lord as we speak Lord and God it takes you to bring it together Lord in this thought here tonight a little thought Lord Jesus you're mindful of every need and every circumstance sometimes lord it's things that you come by our way to Lord to help us that we can see Lord our failures where we can see in a way that Lord where we need to be strengthened areas that maybe we've let down and we might wonder Lord why has this come about why has this happened Lord just how that you would bring it so simple sometimes it's the simple things that we neglect and we leave undone Lord sometimes Lord we can get to a place and just feel Lord the to a place of being overconfident then Lord we find ourselves Lord failing we find ourselves relying on our own human abilities and our own strength Lord that'll never do Lord you come to help us and to show us Lord to speak to us because you care Lord your desire Lord you have called us and ordained us to walk and live as Overcomers in this hour made us to be more than conquerors Lord strengthen us Lord that we can do all things through Christ Lord Jesus you know lord of the many needs that Lord have gathered here in this meeting sometimes Lord the the needs are well lord they're just like this little sister here Lord they were beneath the surface Lord in that emotional realm Lord so something so deep that Lord she couldn't get out of that world that she was in on her own but you sent a word to break that Veil Lord Lord I pray God here tonight Lord I believe Lord that you have moved Among Us Lord you've spoke to our hearts Lord I pray tonight God may you give courage to hearts and lives that maybe Lord if if they Fallen Lord along the way may they receive courage Lord to stand back up and to try again no matter how many times they failed Lord wherever they're at in their Journey May Lord I pray they put their eyes on you Lord looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith let us lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beet us let us run this race with patience that's set before us Lord we just ask you tonight that you would come Lord minister to your needs Lord father you're more than enough Lord and you care you care so much Lord you would allow these things to be included Lord to be recorded that we could hear them Lord it would be spoken in this generation because you know that Lord there would be lives and hearts Lord that would need

thing it's really important for you to be looking at the wrong thing at the right thing because there's all kinds of Temptations be looking at the wrong thing but you got to be looking at the right thing yes Lord nowhere in the Bible even does it say for you to look at yourself and judge things by yourself or looking at friends looking at other people and what they're doing you got to be looking at the right thing to me the only right thing that there is in this crazy world is God's word that's the only right thing there is and we got to be looking at that cuz that's the way God looks at you he looks at you through through the blood of Christ and he sees what he predestinated from before the foundation of the world he doesn't polish up our lives like Brother Sam said he doesn't Polish people up and then uh present them in scripture doesn't do that takes them just as they are takes them just in their rawness and in their natural way takes them and begins to use them and mold them and shape them for the glory of God that's what he does he made a way so that we would care yes Lord what a great statement he made a way that we would care yes as you wouldn't care less if God hadn't made a way for you we wouldn't be caring about how we measure up we wouldn't be caring about the things of God we wouldn't be caring about making 2024 a better year and drawing closer to God we wouldn't care about that at all we'd be caring about making money we'd be caring about our careers and we'd be caring about all kinds of other things but you know when you begin to look at the right thing long enough that right thing begins to affect your thinking about things and you realize that a whole lot of stuff in this life doesn't matter but what God said about you that's what matters and I'm thankful for how God sees me I'm thankful for how he sees me I'm sometimes confused at how I see myself but I'm thankful for how he sees me yes Lord and He forgives us and he and he forgives us over and over again and I'm so thankful for that let's sing that little chorus he has forgiven me then we're going to let Gideon sing some chuses here while we're just worshiping tonight what a nice atmosphere what a great word that God's given us tonight he has forgiv me my sins have been washed from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of Cal and he has [Music] forgiv me oh he he has forgi me my
