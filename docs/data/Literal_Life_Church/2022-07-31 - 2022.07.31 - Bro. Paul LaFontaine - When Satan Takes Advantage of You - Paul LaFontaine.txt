========================================

said we want to give the Lord time if we can't give him time speak to us then we we have something different going on we just want to give him all the glory and we want to give him he had time for us to go to Calvary he had time for us so we had time for him this morning second Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 11. I'm just there's just the whole section of scriptures but I'm just reading one for time's sake and this is the only thought that I wanted to get to Paul says lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices it's a good scripture for what I just talked about let me read that again I didn't tie that to get together until just now lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen father bless your word today and may you stir up Lord the Holy Ghost within the people and if they don't have that father I pray you'll give them the new birth this morning they would yield their lives completely to you we Believers don't want to live lukewarm or even cold you said Lord you'd rather have us either hot or cold not lukewarm but Lord you would rather have us burning with the fires of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives I pray it be so bless this word today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask him amen once you shake somebody's hand before you're seated today God bless you in the blessing of the Lord now I want to take a subject this morning a short subject and talk along the lines of this scripture and we've been in much prayer spent the entire day yesterday telling the Lord we are completely and totally Available to You Lord the entire day no distractions nothing talked about a half hour with these precious young people that want to be baptized just popped over to the church and talked to them they were very receptive to the things we said in the instruction but other than that we just been before the Lord so we want to speak a little bit on this scripture and also one in the Old Testament so Paul expresses here that the way things that are supposed to be in a Christian walk and that is uh the normal way in a Christian believer's Life is that Satan should not have the advantage over us we know it should be the other way around that we should always have the advantage over Satan and and so he expressed as the less Satan should and if you want to read this week uh the preliminary scriptures and what led up to him saying that is actually based upon forgiveness and forgiving one another and forgiving a man who sinned in the church in First Corinthians he sinned and that he was openly coming to church still and taking communion and it was sinning and so they weren't dealing with it they were immature they weren't dealing with the sin in the count and so he rebuked them in First Corinthians and said deliver one up and deal with that sin while they dealt with it and the boy repented and then now he's talking about restoring him and bringing him back and forgiving him and if you forgive him then we'll forgive him so he's in that subject and then he comes we want him he says we want to make sure that's all clear lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices Satan is not to have an advantage in a believer's life we're not called for him to take advantage of us we're not called for the devil to slap us around we're not called called for the devil to bully us we're not called for the devil to intimidate us [Applause] can I get an amen this morning we're not called for the devil to slap us around and take advantage of us and intimidate us and I I'm reminded of a quote that says overcoming means recognizing the devil at every one of his tricks in other words we want to live a life that's such ahead of the game that even before he brings the Temptation we know what it is we know the path that Satan's going down we know what trap he's trying to bring us in I would like to be able to live I'm just speaking to my wife the other day and was talking about the blood of Jesus Christ and I said hun it has to be two sides of the blood of Jesus Christ that it has the power to forgive us when we make a mistake how many believe it has the power to forgive us when we make a mistake how many is glad for that power but we also know there's another side in the blood of Jesus Christ and that is it has the power in it to protect us and keep us from sin and so many churches only preach this side of it that he forgives us when we sin but they Don't Preach enough on the other side that it's powerful enough to even keep us and protect us from sin best case scenario is we're living close to the Lord and there's less and less mistakes happening because we're living under the power of God every day to protect us from sin I can give you scriptures for that but that's the case we don't want to preach either side because a lot of times churches will preach the one side where if you get this and you have this experience you're going to do this and you're never going to make a mistake again that's not true then why would we need the blood of Jesus Christ because we're still in these bodies and we make mistakes but if we keep preaching this side we'll go on and on keep making mistakes and not call upon God say God let me ask forgiveness from you but God put a power in my life that I would never do that again can I get a greater amen this morning the blood of Jesus Christ has covered it all for the believer's life and he is not supposed to be intimidating and taking advantage of Satan is not supposed to be taken advantage of us to have the advantage means this dude to have the advantage means a condition or a circumstance that puts one in a favorable or a superior position I'm going to read it again it means that a condition or circumstance that puts one the devil in this case it that condition or circumstance has put the devil in a favorable or a superior position in your life in other words something happens some incident happened a condition happen you got under the right atmosphere excuse me you got to understand maybe a wrong atmosphere because it goes both way right atmosphere a wrong atmosphere is going to put either God or the enemy in a superior position in your life so conditions or circumstances someone has a trial someone has a lost loved one someone has something bad happened to them even if a Christian circumstances or certain conditions if we're not careful it's not just what happens to us it actually elevates and promotes Satan in a superior position in our life I'll make it simple you make a mistake and the devil's beating you up and putting you down you're nobody you're not a son or daughter of God and keeps even though you have forgiveness you're beating yourself up the devil's beating yourself up and so now you stay there and guess what the devil has used your mistake to put himself to give himself a promotion or you gave him a promotion to a superior place in your life that he's taken advantage of the situation a lost loved one oh God you know we there's hard things to go through but the worst part of it is to give Satan through that situation a superior position in your life he's taken advantage of you he's beating you up he's keeping you depressed he's making you question the word of God and so to take advantage means a condition of circumstances that puts him in a superior position things happen and Satan gets in a superior position over you through that many circumstances happen in life and in a church many circumstances happen many different Spirits can come in a church and then at the end of it he if Satan takes advantage of the situation then we got a problem because we're going to have situations we're going to have circumstances but if Satan gets the advantage in it that's the problem can I get an amen he binds things up he kills unity and it was just a situation but if it turns into Satan getting a promotion in your life let me say it clearly if a situation or a trial or something wrong you've been done wrong or a mistake you're made that's one thing we can bring it to the Lord can you say it back but that's one thing but if if it makes you give Satan a promotion in your life and his position that's where you're going to have a problem he does not have a right unless you give it to him for a superior position to take advantage over you somebody said praise the Lord he doesn't have a right for that position we got to kick him out can you say man sometimes Satan takes little things and makes them huge things sometimes Satan takes something little and you can deal with it and he makes them big things and he gets the victory he gets dominance over you in the end result he's defeating you and we should say no devil no devil we're not going to let you do that you have not been given any Superior position in my life you're not going to take advantage of me you're not going to use any extreme situation to take advantage of my life he doesn't belong in that position he doesn't belong in your thoughts can you say Amen who gave him a place at the table in your thoughts he doesn't even have a right for a place at the table in your thoughts and you give them a place at the table he doesn't have a right it's like when he comes in your thoughts you should be saying what are you doing here I didn't invite you what are you doing here get out here's the door get out can I get an amen trying to make it simple for all of us is that you give them a place in the table and he doesn't have a right in the believer's life have placed at the table he doesn't have an opinion he doesn't have an appeal why are you listening to Satan's opinion he doesn't get an opinion Paul says we also live that where Satan does not take advantage but we also live where we are not ignorant of his devices and that's why he can take an advantage is because we are let me word in a different way Paul says we are not ignorant of devices we are not dumb to Satan's schemes we are not dumb I'm rewording it so we can understand it better is that we do not live as Christians being in being dumb to the schemes of Satan sometimes the person is truly ignorant they didn't know they didn't understand how Satan got in because they didn't know he could come in that way he didn't understand they didn't understand they're truly ignorant sometimes a person is truly ignorant but sometimes people choose to be ignorant sometimes people don't know want to know the word of God on something and every warning is in their way every believer warning them Pastor warning them mom every warning has been put their way parents warning them and they can't see Satan in the device that Satan is using or they don't want to oh that's just a little thing and that's just a little guilty pleasure of mine and it's an innocent thing I'm not really affected by it it's just something I escape into those romance novels you know that's something I've had in my life a long time they don't bother me at all it's my private world and yet Satan finds any way that he can to get into your house because how many knows the Bible says he's a thief he finds ways to come through the back doors of your life or even the basement window and you're saying I got that secured I got that locked there's no way he could have got in there listen if you're dealing with the professional Thief I don't care how much you've secured your house a professional Thief they have ways you're not a professional Thief but professional thieves It's amazing And you think they never get in there they never get in that basement window nobody could fit through that basement window don't underestimate the thief don't underestimate the thief that Satan is trying to get in your house I said brother Paul what's my house hold up your hands point back at yourself this is your house and the Bible says it's a temple of the Holy Ghost it's and and it's not a temple of the Holy Ghost but you rent out rooms to the devil it's not a you can't call it the temple the mind the spirit the body everything and you can't say God is allowed in my soul but my body or my eyes every once in a while I rent out for other things no no if it's to be filled every fiber is to be filled and controlled by the Holy Spirit but Satan is a professional thief and he knows how to get in the back door now when we the house that my kids were raised in on Bancroft there is Bancroft guest house now it's an Airbnb and so but for years for years we had little environments and critters that were up in the attic and I'm here to tell you I work for countless years probably 15 years at the problem with varmints in is that a new word environments the young people know what environments is something was up there squirrels or Chipmunks or some type of creature and they were in the attic and they just set up housekeeping up there ever every winner they would come in and they used my house they didn't pay any rent and they're up there and it's like so every summer I'd attack it again and I'd I'd have this and I'd have this person look at it and and we'd find holes okay the problem solved and we've solved the problem and then we're the worst place they came they must have knew me because the worst place that came was right above me in Becca's bed that was their party ground at night and you know chewing and so we're laying there you know just getting ready to go to sleep stuff being moved around and I don't it's no telling what they were doing up there and for years I'm not talking about I don't know how these things got in because I was doing everything to keep them out I don't know how they got in and and and and you're there and you're going what are they doing and so I get so mad after I've done everything to keep them out and then all of a sudden you know and so you know my wife can tell you I yelled out some nights I said get out of my house this is my house I did not invite you or I would get a chair and I'd be just pounding on the ceiling didn't I hon I just go oh I want to get some sleep and when I do that if I yell or if I'd hit the ceiling it got real quiet Who's down there the owner the owner dies my authority I don't hear anything you're as quiet as a Mouse anyway I got this professional company and they guaranteed it for five years we guarantee we'll come back every time until we find that problem had to pay him a lot of money to get a five-year warranty and guess what I found it was out front they found it one day after coming back three or four times they couldn't even find it and I kept calling and saying listen you guys guarantee this I still got varmints in this up there and they've come out and one day he was out there in the front and just underneath the siding they hadn't looked before they hadn't seen it just this little tiny hole in the front of the house you know how I need to get to my sermon here but this is an irritation to me it's like why didn't they come in that hole and just stay in the front of the house in Solomon's room somebody else's room besides mine how who put it what devil put it in their minds to come up that wall and travel all the way back to my bedroom if a thief is a professional he can find many ways into your house that you did not expect because he's good at sneaking in can you say Matt for there is now I want to talk about a little bit today uh the what's on Satan's mind brother Burley and I were fellowshiping about that a couple weeks ago and he got so inspired about it and I did too I think he went down and preached that BCF a couple Wednesdays ago if you want to hear it I'm sure it's a tremendous message he always breaks things down real good but he says he said we're talking about what's do people realize what's in the devil's mind what's his agenda what he wants to do and we're living in the last days where God said he would restore his word through Elijah and not so much restore not just restore the word but actually bring the mystery Revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be completely revealed as he has declared to his servants the prophets at the end time he reveals the complete mystery of God and that means that we're going to go into not just restored word but we the Believers will be able to tap into what was in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world see his purpose see his plan and see you were in him before the foundation of the world that's what we're blessed to hear can you say Amen we're just not preaching little sermons here we're hearing what was in God's mind before the foundation of the world the message has revealed what was in God's mind but I want to tell you something the message has also revealed what's on Satan's mind his agenda what he's thinking about every day and the Bible tells us many places but here's one you're familiar with the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and destroy you know what that scripture said brother Billy and I were talking about it you know it says the thief cometh not but to do these things in other words he doesn't even show up unless he's out to kill to steal to destroy what the believer has to kill you to make you quit serving God to steal the good things God has given you and if he can just destroy he doesn't even show up unless he's stealing killing and destroying and you say Amen I ask you a question you're sitting here I'm glad to have you here but for many of you many years the devil stole things from you and you haven't taken them back yet he stole things from you you had a heart to serve God you were serving him you were going along you were lining up with the message in the word of God but somehow Satan mixed mess with your mind and now he stole things from you and you don't even realize it it's time for you to rise up and take them back time for you to realize that what's on the devil's mind is he's out to take advantage of you and he's taken advantage of you in your life right now and he's not to do that you have to rise in faith to stand against it can you say Amen quickly go with me to second Samuel chapter 13. much more I can say about that but I hope you get to the point that the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy can you say Amen we're learning what's on Satan's mind and you have to know you can't be ignorant of Satan's devices you cannot be dumb concerning his schemes that he comes against you you can't not shut every window and every door of your household it has to be protected by the blood and by the word every day can you say Amen because there are too many devices that Satan is in control of and he'll gonna he's gonna come in that basement window he's going to come in through that phone he's going to come in to that app that you have on your phone he's going to come in through that new app that just came out he's going to come in through the movies that you're watching he's going to come in through the music you're listening to he's going to come into what you're listening to on the radio any place that he's given he's going to try to sneak in your house second Samuel chapter 13. and you know friends I get up here and preach these things but something's been happening I just want to post the church okay there's some there's some reason there's one reason that I'm speaking these things and got off my subject on relationships because I feel like something's changed a little bit in our assembly and I feel like he's used situations and Satan is taking a little bit of advantage of us and the thing is is that I've been keeping that to myself for the most part but other Holy Ghost Field Believers have sensed it I had somebody text me this week and say I I hear you're going to preach something here on Sunday I don't know what you're going to preach but I'm going to stand together with you in prayer for this Sunday of service because this is a spiritual battle with the devil that's taken advantage of people there's a Godly sister who had a a dream and she was afraid to share it with me but uh and I'm not here to share dreams to make you afraid but I can tell you that about half of it has come to pass and she doesn't know anything about what's going on the congregation like I do half of it's come to us God through the Holy Ghost showed her through a dream things that's going on things that's taken place privately and I'm just waiting for the rest of it to be fulfilled but I'm just I'm not saying to scare you I'm saying to say this if you think that the Holy Spirit does not know what's going on privately you're greatly mistaken and he will expose it in his loving corrective way but you can't be around the Holy Spirit and continue to hide things some of it is some of the young people are not serving the lord privately and living a double life so I cry and I my spirits grieved that Satan would not get an advantage in their lives I love you and I'm going to tell you the truth praise the Lord II Samuel 13 this is related a little bit to that and it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar Tamar Tamar however you want to pronounce it he had a fair sister whose name was in other words he was pretty whose name was Tamar and amnon the son of David loved her so this is a half-sister and he loved her so it would stop right there if that scripture was left alone by itself then we could all look at it as a pure love for this girl although he couldn't have her anyway uh when you use the term love for peer Believers you think of pure okay he loved this girl okay so just stopping right here now this story of amnon what's going to happen in this story and I'm not reading the whole thing today I'm going to break it down in further services but I'm I'm I'm what's going to happen is if you don't know the story I'll tell you the summer summary this son of the this this uh this um amnon is going to take advantage of a daughter of the king I said this amnon is going to take advantage in the story take advantage of a daughter of the king so when I read that and I read it through the years but I've never got so much out of it as reading it now currently is that when I read this and read the story then I realized my question was is that this is an extreme violation here that he's going to carry out but my question is is what's in the mind of that boy and how did he get to that point because you don't get to the point of overriding all these things because remember he's he's a religious boy he's around King David he's around he's he's a one of the lineage of David how in the world does it get in his mind and where was what was he feeding on and what was taking place in This Boy's Life to carry out to take advantage of a daughter of the king and I'm not going to read all that today you should read it though because I'm exploring what's in amnon's mind I'm also going to explore uh the family because it was related to some family issues two chapters before is David's sin which you can break down David the king's sin and this something began through the family here that that wasn't completely resolved and so now we have a sexual problem going on and so but I want to explore what's in amnon's mind as I just talked about the devil's mind a lot of this is associated with amnon's mind because you just asked how did he get there in his thinking what what his plan was we understand how he carried it out but how did he get there in his thinking because I have a mind the same type of Mind as amnon you have a mind like Eminem you have a brain and so we are susceptible to what goes on in our thought life we are susceptible to receiving things that would bring us to things later on down the road that we have allowed in our minds so the problem here is definitely of a sexual nature because he's going to carry out a rape to this daughter of the king and sexual things um there's something unique about them and as I keep talking it gets quieter and quieter and quieter and you have to know that I've been praying about this for a month and I'm prepared for that part because when you talk about sexual things and I will do it tactfully when you talk about it people are going to get quiet and some of it that's good that's healthy okay because it's a tight subject but I will not I will not allow the devil to privately defeat people's lives by not I'm I'm I want to hit this from a different flank as it were in war and to where the devil doesn't even know what hit him and I would love for some of you to stand with me in prayer every Thursday morning we're gathering with a few of the brothers in the area 7 30 and Thursday mornings for the needs of the church for some of these issues every Thursday morning if you want to join me with that on Thursday mornings at 7 30 in your home I would love for you to do that because I will not stand by and let the devil take advantage of people's lives sexual things they're unique because they tend to embed themselves in our minds deeper than other things music has a great power to slip through uh because music has a power on the mind that dismantles the the reasoning and so Spirits can come through music easier than they can come through somebody just walking up to you and telling you to do something wrong and telling dirt to you through the music realm it dismantles our emotions and makes us softer and more gentle so we don't reason what's coming through so then the lyrics come through of the worldly songs and the spirit comes through and someone can take a demon Spirit by the music of the world [Music] but it goes in a little easier because the mind and our spirit and our emotions get kind of dismantled especially as a nice soft song that it's got orchestration and it's just it it just pulls the heartstrings and it it kind of dismantles any reason you guys that's so lovely that's so good but Christians need to be still on their feet to say what are they saying in this song you know there's an old Barry Manilow song which the young people wouldn't know but he wrote a song I write the songs I write the songs that make the whole world sing I write the songs of love and special things I write the songs that make the young girls cry I write the songs I write the songs I won't sing anymore because there's I can feel the demon Spirits coming in even without but it was just all guitar it was this is nice this is a very Universal thing and he writes the song it's Barry Manilow and then you read the first verse and you realize it says I've been alive forever and I wrote the very first song well Barry Manilow hasn't been alive forever and he didn't write the very first song So if you lose just a little bit of reasoning use your brain just a little bit and you have to ask who's talking here who's blatantly telling the world I'm the originator of this and I'm gathering you in for the battle of Armageddon and I'm using beautiful music to do it and Christians need to be on their toes and check everything that you're feeding on including some Christian music because Christian music today is some of it's very worshipful and some of it gives glory to God but some of it you better read the lyrics because you could take the lyrics and apply them to your boyfriend there's nothing of Christ in there there's nothing of the love of Christ there's nothing about serving the lord There's No Redemption there's no blood and you can take the lyrics and use it for your boyfriend or girlfriend that's why they can use songs over there for love songs Taylor Swift and they some of them they can use over here talk about the Lord I think there's a big problem with that but I didn't expect to say all that this morning but I did but the spirit and the the lyrics get through because we're dismantled a bit sexual things are even more embedded in our minds deeper than just about anything and Satan knows that Satan knows it so what would it be in Satan's Eden what would this be his main thing to try to destroy young boys and young girls and get them under a guilt and shame so that they don't even feel worthy when God begins to deal with them they don't even feel worthy to even come to God because their mind at an early age has been filled with sexual dirty images who's the author of that the same one who said I wrote the very first song I understand human beings I understand their brains and Friends there's a problem when the devil understands your brain and how it works and what you feed on when the devil understands that better than you that's a problem and we're not ignorant of Satan's devices we're not dumb or we shouldn't be dumb so this is why God has put Protections in place how many believe God's put Protections in place for our soul yes but God has put Protections in place in the Bible God has put Protections in place for our brains and if you're going to preach about the protections of the Soul then you got to preach about the protections of the brain not a lot of preaching like that in our ranks about the brain how it works and when I jump onto it and read quotes of the Prophet read scriptures some some ranks I get labeled let me not I just get quickly labeled something other than the norm that I'm preaching psychology and I'm just using scriptures in the message to show that God has put Protections in place for our brains not just our souls and you can ignore them all you want to but you are what you are and we may pay the consequences great consequences if we ignore that part there's a writer here Ted Roberts who words it this way I don't know if you ever thought about it but isn't it amazing how we are able to remember certain events in our lives and totally forget others for example can you remember what you ate for lunch on this date five years ago I can't yet we are able to remember nearly every detail of an incident in which someone deeply embarrassed us five years ago what are the differences between those two events is their depth of sensory impact so there's certain things that have a depth of sensory impact and there's other things that don't that's why we tend to remember the ones that have a deeper sensory impact how many of our senses were involved and How Deeply that's the question the embarrassment involved all of our senses and was also underlined with a strong adrenaline flow we wanted either to fight or to run in response to the disgrace that we felt because we were so affected in our brain in the adrenaline that flowed from somebody embarrassing us five years ago we wanted to either fight or to run in response into to the disgrace and the embarrassment we felt oh he says when I am in into a good book I always read it with a highlighter pin in my hand so I can find the critical information quickly in the future with the highlighter similarly our brains chemically highlight certain events for instance referral separating the significance from the insignificant I'm going to read that again similarly our brains chemically highlight certain events for instant referral separating the significant from the insignificant a major aspect of sexual activity is a strong release of adrenaline and endorphins which is why sexual events become imprinted in our brain almost completely more deeper than any other thing whether good or bad whether holy or dirty it has an effect and so I'm being real with you this morning and I'm asking you to be real I'm asking you to go back to the scripture that Paul instructs us as Believers we should not be ignorant of Satan's devices we should not be ignorant of how these things affect the brain can you say amen and we should live that the devil does not have an advantage over us in any area of our life he does not belong in that place can you say Amen now in in amnon as I try to bring this down a little bit now in verse 1 and 2 uh let's read verse two now so he says he loves Tamar okay he loved her verse two and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Damar for she was a virgin stop right there how do you have that he loved her in verse one and he was so vexed that he got sick in verse two it's real clear here he thought this was love but this isn't love and we know we were living a generation that's messed up the word love you don't even know what love is anymore homosexual says he loves his partner lesbian says she loves her partner you don't know what love is if you're listening to me today I loved you enough in the love of the Lord to tell you that somehow love has been perverted because anything that's not God ordained and he ordained all this he created us as human beings and if you're getting off to and denying even the way God made you as a male or a female if you're denying that you're denying the god that made you and you can't twist love into those perverted things God's the Creator Satan is the perverter of what he creates Satan never created anything he would love to have the power of creation he's never had it he never will he only takes what God has and perverts it and so God is the Fountain of pure love can you say amen God is the Fountain of pure love between a man and a woman God is the Fountain of pure love for God God is the fountain to keep pure can you say Amen Satan takes it and perverts that down this down this down this until you have a homosexual lesbian saying I really love them I truly love them I'm sorry that's not true that's a perverted love why was amnon vexed I've been pondering it for two or three weeks how can he have love it just to me uh it's confusing these two verses are confusing unless you know the long-term damage lust does them to the mind if you understand the long-term damage that lust does to the mind and twist everything that's the only way you can understand this that his love what he called love because love does not have vexation to it can I get everybody a degree pure love does not have vexation what what does vexation mean glad you asked Vex in the Hebrew is yassar vexed in the Hebrews yasar throughout the Old Testament it means to be distressed to press to be narrow in other words this thing has become and has another word for uh vexation is obsession this is not love anymore it doesn't have freedom anymore it doesn't have respect anymore it loses all the boundaries loses all respect and everything else in life becomes falls into Oblivion and this becomes an obsession this is a narrow thought I must have her I must have her and he's calling it love and it's vexation with it brother and sister that is not love young people that is not love don't put love to that one thought how can I have this woman how can I nothing else matters in life how can I have this woman then you feed on these video games which have women in them and it only just fuels the the wrong kind of fire that's in you the obsession that's in you feed on those things are not becoming very popular today but I'm going to speak the truth you sit there and feed your mind of that and say you're not affected and I'm going to tell you again young brother you are affected by it and the devil is taking advantage of your spiritual walk when you sit there for countless hours hidden in secret playing those video games I tell you in the name of the Lord you better hit an altar because Satan's taking advantage of your life He Has Lifted himself in a position he's controlling you but it's narrow it's an obsession and becomes everything that's not love obsessed thinking was what he was all about he was obsessed about her that's not love when somebody's obsessed with somebody now I know romance can make you just really you know act funny I understand that that's a pure romance for somebody that's you know you you know my wife says when I first came to her house for the first time um uh the uh there was something about was asking for uh a a drink or something I can't remember what it was asking for something to drink and and I was the first visit so kind of in la la land that uh I can't remember the story now so it's not important and I know my wife doesn't want to get up and tell it today but I was in so much of La La Land that I just forgot to serve for a drink or I can't remember what it was but anyway oh no she was in la la land and my brother-in-law Henry was there and she served me a drink but Henry never got nothing she was the one that was la la not me walked right by him you know brought me a drink and it was like Henry wasn't there I know there's a romance but obsession is a different thing that's not love and a matter of fact romantic love will get you in trouble if there's not a solid respect of genuine love worldly songs are filled with romantic love have her sexually how he and and and so this is something that I would I'm just elaborating on because vexation of spirit and here's what he said to in verse two and Ammon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin stop right there already right there is a protection in place if it's upheld that he knew there was a boundary there that a god-ordained boundary and then he says then it says and he thought it hard for him to do anything to her in other words this Criminal Mind of amnon was standing there knowing I can't have my obsession but I'm not going to quit until I can get around because it's hard to get to her so I have to form a plan to get around because it's so hard to get to I say if a girl is hard to get to by the life she's living she's playing hard to get I say praise the Lord praise the Lord is this okay with everybody because that's God ordained and so here's this here's this mind it's going to figure out a plan and influence from a friend how can I do this and get around all this I want to tell you that's the devil's mind this is the devil's mind you want to know what he's thinking every day God's got Protections in place for the daughter of the king I'm preaching to the daughter of the king today I'm preaching to the Bride of Jesus Christ and God has put Protections in place for her and every day the devil is trying to ponder and scheme to get around those protections you ought to know that and you ought to say I'm not ignorant of his devices or what's on his mind I'm Gonna Keep the Protections in place I'm gonna read the word to my kids you know I almost weep because you might some of you older ones may resist this I don't know what you're gonna what you're gonna leave saying today it's fine with me but you know what I'm preaching to a lot these young lives that's going to be baptized today these young children they're gonna hear from this pastor because they're going to go into a world that is perverted and dirty everything that's good they're gonna hear a holy man of God tell them what truth is because I care for the future if we're here another 10 years they need to hear truth they need to Value the Protections in place they need to Value when a pastor says don't be alone together in a car with a guy or girl they need a pastor who says don't be doing these things don't touch one another don't kiss one another until you're married I don't care what standards you've developed the message says it the word says it and I'm going to preach tell keep preaching our young children this beautiful God I just I'm tired of the devil taking advantage [Applause] excuse me for my anger I'm not angry at you but I'm standing I trust you stand with you I stand against the enemy who takes advantage you don't want him to take advantage of us how can I get around these things how can I take advantage of her this is the mind of Satan and the mind of a lot of our men in this generation is how can I get around the boundaries because of what they're feeding on if you find a boy I'm gonna say something positive now if you find a boy that loves this word with all of his heart and you can see the spirit of God in his life and he respects the boundaries of parents both parents he respect the boundaries of virginity and the boundaries that's been in place to protect rigidity he respects that he's not trying to find a way around it with you and it doesn't bother him that it's hard to get to you it doesn't bother him a bit he's not trying to get around it he's not trying to find a way it doesn't bother him that you have bounties and protection around that doesn't intimidate him at all he's thanking God for it and he still likes you he still loves you he has respect for your feelings and the god ordained rules that's in place for a virgin I'm going to save you that's a boy to consider seriously because that's hard to find today he needs a job too [Laughter] you know w-o-r-k is more than just a radio station boy needs to know how to work boy needs to go get a trade he needs to go get a degree or a trade boy needs to put the time in so he can support a family some of you don't like this they're in love they'll make it the Holy Ghost will get them through get so tired of hearing that I know the Holy Ghost will get you through but without a vision the people perish without a vision the boy don't have a vision and he just wants to jump to something he don't have a vision he's not preparing at all there's a problem with that so I'll get off the work thing but you know he needs a job but if you got a boy that's comfortable with the Protections in place and with the daddy that's protecting and it don't bother it's not amnon it's trying it's it's hard to get to her how can I get around these things if you got a boy that's doing that I'll tell you how to you know consider that's really seriously but a guy or girl who's looking for a way around the principles and protections that's being preached of virginity you better run from that boy you better stay single for a few more years man brother Paul praise God it was hard for him to get anything to her at least say something that's the way that I want to live before the devil I want to live every day that the devil what he's thinking is that I'd like to get him but he's so hard to get to come on people raise your hand how many would like to live a life where the devil gets up Monday morning and say I have issues with this guy because I've looked at his life he's got every door covered everything locked up it's going to be hard for me to get a plan together because he's hard to get to the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ might I remind you that brother Branham said that they the bride Jesus himself the reason the Devil Couldn't get to Jesus is because he had been sprayed with the repellent of predestination he knew his position he knew he was in the mind of God he knew he was predestinated to come to this earth and that strength was a protection and a repellent against Satan I'm preaching to a bride in this age and a bride that's listening online there's been protections put in place the repellent of predestination has been preached and when she stands in her position in the word it's hard for Satan to get to her [Applause] I'm playing hard to get with the Enemy Hallelujah a couple more quotes and I'm finished thank you for your attention thank you for your love thank you for loving me amen it's hard to get to this bride this is the way he said it and uh our brother Branham said it you're not familiar with him sometimes we quote him quoted another Minister today but the brand was a great man of God in the in the last generation and uh was used in a mighty way so this is a quote from him the word said he was the Son of God the spirit proved he was the son of God Isaiah 9 6 was fulfilled and the other night many of you of the broadcast heard that he would give 60 some odd scriptures here almost I believe that proving that the scripture said that it was him so you know Jesus is in a pretty confident place because there's some 66 Old Testament scriptures that speak of his position he's standing pretty strong in his position I believe about proving that the scripture said that that was him oh Satan tried and tried again to do everything one night laying on the back of a ship he's seen him to sleep and he said I'll destroy him right now but he couldn't he tried to tempt him in doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it why he had been sprayed with the repellent of predestination they can't be deceived no no the word said he would be here amen they there ain't no devil going to bother him and no other Son of God that's predestinated to take his place he is sprayed with a repellent Satan's poison denominational doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing going to bother him see it didn't have an effect on him somebody say praise the Lord bride is living in a place that if she'll stay behind the protections of God's word God has made it hard to get to this bride unless you open the doors and ignore the word of God you say well we don't have anything today we don't have anything for the Modern Problems yes we do God has sent us a message of Christ of the last days God has restored us back to the word don't ever let the devil tell you that there's not something in the word for a protection and place against the enemy God has made it hard to get to this bride look at all the word he gave to us in this hour and if you'll respect it and you'll live it Satan can't take advantage of your life amen go ahead stand I'll quit preaching if you stand God has made it hard I'll comment on amnon and Tamar this is the exciting thing if you read later Tamar's life went on in amnon's life ended that's the end of the story Tamar went on with the Lord amnon days were numbered can you say Amen praise be to God guess what Satan's days are numbered Satan will come to an end someday but the bride will not come to an end this isn't the end for the bride you make a mistake it's not the end for you but there will be an end to Satan someday there will be an end to him accusing us there will be an end to his thoughts he's putting in our mind that one day the accuser of our Brethren will be cast down that's promises in the Bible aren't you glad today that there will be an end to this mind that's coming against you every day there will be an end to that but to the bride who's living in the protections there will be no end to her she's going from here she's going in a Rapture she's going in a thousand years of Peace honeymoon and then she's going to a new heavens and a new Earth she does an end she keeps going on for eternity even though she makes mistakes even though she's went through things even though she lived right in the middle of Satan's Eden with his mind just conniving things constantly conniving scheming what can I do to get around all this there's certain things in place brothers and sisters I know what you say about yourself but you can just say God's put things in place if I'll read it I'll feed on it I'll put that in my mind there's Protections in place Satan will not be able to get around I say praise the Lord I don't really know how to end this except for you bow on your heads and closing your eyes and praying and I'm going to ask you in the next well this service I don't mean to put it off so in this service I'm going to ask you to be very real the only reason that people you have enjoyed a lot of the services later lately I've enjoyed them we've heard some good things but I feel in my spirit the one thing that's really lacking is repentance and confession if we don't have repentance and confession we give the devil the advantage in our lives the only really two reasons people don't confess things that they've done wrong is because of Pride or because they're too afraid and embarrassed and I understand that but what would it be if you kept it hidden kept it quiet and Satan kept occupying a position of dominance in your life and he stayed right there there's a woman that committed adultery and brother Branham discerned the heart through the Holy Spirit and said 10 years later here she is teaching Sunday School and under the Holy Spirit it discerned but you did something in a car 10 years ago you committed adultery against your husband she was shocked by it it was exposed she said how did you know that nobody knows about that Holy Spirit knew about it not any man the Holy Spirit how did you know about that he said you're going to have to go confess that to your husband she said well I confess that to God years ago I I repented to God it's over now I said you need to confess it to your husband because you sinned against your husband when she went and did it confession completely made the devil move because for years she started to have illnesses and problems diseases and all this comes because she had unresolved unconfessed sin as soon as she confessed it to her husband Freedom came and this was the prophet's comment the devil has a right to sit right there when there's unconfessed sin now I don't know about you but I don't want to have the devil have a right anywhere in my life that's the way he said it now this is set up where the devil has a right to sit there and dominate and take advantage of you when there's things that's laying secret so I'm encouraging you in the love of the Lord take today take the coming days examine your life by the word of God and say brother Paul I have nothing to hide before the Lord before I pray would you raise your hand if you want to say I want to submit all of my devices completely to the Lord we're not going to get around some devices because we have to use them but we don't want Satan to abuse them how we will raise your hand and say I'm going to be really praying that all of my devices are not being used of the devil thank you [Music] you see that's a personal decision with you and God it's a personal decision [Music] thank you Jesus oh God you know think God loves us when he gives a sister a dream he has people calling the sense that something's hindering and restricting our worship how many one more time just raise your hand and say I don't want anything to restrict our worship in this congregation I want the devil to be exposed we have to do it together friends we have to stand together against the enemy Thursday mornings if you join with us at 7 30 for prayer Thursday mornings we're going to stand with the banner the blood of Jesus Christ and we're not going to let Satan take advantage of us heavenly father would you
