of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] Lord you seem so far away a million miles or more it feels [Music] today do I have lost my faith I must confess right now now that is hard for me to pray but I don't know how to say I don't know where to start but as you give the grace with all that's in my heart I will saying I will pray even in my darkness night through the sorrow and the pain I will say I will pray lift my hands to onor you because your worth is true I will sing lord it's hard for me to see all the thoughts and plain you have for me but I will put my trust in you knowing that you died to set me free but I don't know what to say I don't know where to start but how you give the grace with all that's in my heart I will sing I will pray even in the darkest night through the sorrow and the pain I will sing I Will will pray lift my hands to run all you because your word is true I will sing I will pray even in my darkest night through the sorrow and the pain I will sing I will pray lift my hands to honor you because your word is true I will [Music] sing I will sing I will [Music] sing amen we're going to read from Matthew chapter 24 and start reading in verse four and the setting here is some actually some prophecy of Jesus as he talks about our times and our conditions of our time there's several places that he talks about that but I want to just H in on this section here on Wars and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many so we learned something about the end time time that Jesus said and that is it'll be a time of deception there will be many false Christ come and false anointed ones and faults that are meant to deceive people so uh I always like to say though if there's false Christ if there's something false there has to be a real for them to make the false off of Amen so uh you can't have a counterfeit dollar unless you have a real dollar for it to go off of so thank God that we have the the real living Christ here tonight the word uh this is not a deception but it's the real Christ and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places now it doesn't take very much discernment to know this is exactly what's going on in our times the last 40 years and especially the last 10 years what Jesus said is happening before our very eyes and these are all the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another what a time to live in and many false prophet shall rise and shall deceive many so you have false Christ now you have false prophets if you have false prophets there has to be something real for them to make that off of verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved how many wants to endure until the end if it puts it in there somebody's going to endure all this Wars rumors of wars being hated can you sayen persecution but somebody's endure it Jesus said he that shall endure to the end shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come now I'd like to add one more scripture before we sit down because I'll refer refer to it at the end if you don't mind one more in Romans chapter 5 and verse 5 just one verse there because we want to plant that in our minds so we can have in our minds for this study tonight Romans chapter 5 and verse 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us I want to read it again hope maketh not ashamed in other words that means the hope and the promise of God you will never be disappointed now are we disappointed in governments today are we disappointed with politics are we disappointed at Nations Rising against Nation uh do people disappoint you there's a lot of things that disappoint us but the promise of God will never disappoint you it says it says here in verse 5 we just fin Romans 5 and verse 5 I'll read it again hope maketh not ashame because the love of God is poured out shed abroad in our hearts by what by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us there's several places that Jesus is specific of the conditions for our time and that is the last days and so here is he gets very specific about certain things and uh I'm glad tonight that I can say that I'm not in the dark about what's going on in the news and we're not in the dark because Jesus speaks of it here Jesus knew what was going to happen and Jesus prophesized the people that are going to live in the end times this is what they're going to experience and so we're not in the dark how many are glad tonight you're not in the dark about what's going on uh sometimes it brings fear sometimes we're scared but we're not in the dark because the word tells us this is exactly what would take place and so one part of our security though is knowing that our Lord warned us of all this that's happening in the world that that's I want to talk about security a little bit tonight in different things but one part of our security is the Lord already warned us the Lord already said it the Lord has already proclaimed what's taking place right now and so that brings a security to me that God knows what's going on God knew from the foundation of the world he knew the wars and rumors of wars he knew Israel would be at War right now God knew all that I didn't know that but God knew that God said it in his word so it brings a security to me tonight to know without any shadow of a doubt that our Lord knows what's going on and then he speaks it in his word and it makes it all all the more comforting but I want to hone in on tonight this part about wars Jesus says here that uh about the wars you will hear of it and that it that in itself sometimes just hearing of War can be unsettling to us how many would say Amen just hearing of War can be unsettling to the individual it is unsettling and uh then then Jesus says you shall hear of Wars ye shall hear rumors of wars but then he says but see that you're not troubled about it see that your heart is not troubled so so living in the middle of this and hearing or watching it on the news or seeing these things take place it it can bring the reason Jesus said that is that it can bring a troubled heart but Jesus is saying I don't want you to have a troubled heart I don't want you to live in fear now tonight I want to get to the reason why Jesus saying that because if our Lord says don't be troubled when you hear these things happen don't be nervous don't be afraid that our Lord has to provide some type of source that our hearts would be calmed during this time I would say that to the Lord Lord if you said don't be troubled then what are you going to give me so I won't be troubled because if I'm on my own my heart's scared my heart's troubled the wars and rumors of wars and all the conditions and the and the things mounting up in the in the world conditions the way they are your heart is going to be troubled but our Lord says as we see it don't let your heart be troubled so if our Lord says don't be troubled in other places he says it many times let not your hearts be troubled let not now Jesus must be living himself in a place of perfect faith that even when he hit certain persecutions and pressure was coming on him and there's so many incidences in the four gospels that we could go to now but Jesus lived in a realm of perfect Faith he was calm all the time he never got upset at what was happening to him Jesus was on a ship one time and there was a big storm and all the disciples are scared to death you know what Jesus is doing he's sleeping he's sleeping during a storm and the disciples wake him up and said Lord don't you care that there's a storm we're all going to die here there something's going to happen and and you know what he said to him oh ye of little faith he wasn't worried at all by the storm he wasn't worried about the wars he wasn't worried about demons coming up against him he stood faithful in his realm of perfect Faith he knew who he was he knew where he stood and there was an any demon power or any storm that could ever destroy his life until God said so glory be to God I want wherever Jesus was living I want to live there whatever Faith Jesus was partaking of I want that every day in my life perfect Faith Masters every circumstance and guess what we can live there because he says where I am you can be also am we need it so Jesus is there and and and he's saying don't let your heart be troubled in other places he says it and uh he wouldn't say that unless he could provide for us something or someplace that we can go for strength for Hope for peace all of these are are things that we seek after God has to provide some place or something in these times for our strength for Our Hope For Peace for security can you say amen he could not say uh you know when you begin to feel uh insecure when you feel these insecurities come from the wars and from the pressure and and people hating you when you start to feel that then just maybe go uh through some mental exercises and it'll help you out he didn't say that uh I feel good I feel great I feel wonderful I feel good I feel great I feel wonderful you just convince yourself you're doing you're calming your nerves Jesus didn't say that uh he didn't say uh take up some extra yoga classes when it gets real bad in the world to calm your nerves take some extra yoga classes he didn't stay take more pills he didn't say that here when you hit that last days in all the wars he didn't say try to find more pills he didn't say that not against pills if they help a person but he didn't say he didn't say that he he he's got to give us something greater than a pill can you say man greater than a yoga class he didn't he didn't say go buy yourself something real nice and spend a lot of money on yourself so you can call calm your nerves he didn't say take a few days and binge watch Star Wars series of course he didn't say that this will calm you nerves he didn't say any of that but I I if he said don't be troubled he must be providing something deeper than a movie to calm our nerves you know why I say that you know why I say it because Americans and the world have so many things to calm their nerves but in these conditions it's going to take more than a movie it's going to take more than binge watching some series it's going to take some source that God provides by the holy spirit that we can feed on and we can rest on to calm our nerves and say I know where I stand in this hour I am not afraid God knows the hour that we have because he knows the hour and the trouble that it can cause our hearts he provides something deeper than this world he says I give you peace not as the world gives I give peace but I will give you peace so now I want to say something about war here okay because uh we we have to know some things about war when we hear of war the the war in Israel war comes because hate increases so he had to have the word in there that many shall betray one another many shall many shall uh condemn one another many shall be offended many not it used you know we've always had people offended but he says many will be offended there'll be an increase in people getting offended there'll be an in increase in people uh maybe uh leaving the Church of God and leaving Christ there'll be an increase because it's too much of a nervous time and so they they leave Christ there will be an increase in people that hate haters and because you have hate then you're going to have War because hate is the thing that starts War you're not going to have a war if you don't have hate more war is because we have more hate and there's nothing to stop it there's no place for go for people to go to relieve their hate if hate is in a if hate is not resolved D it leads to all sorts of things including War Nations shall rise against Nation kingdoms shall come against Kingdom why because hate and jealousy has increased how many can say Amen tonight hatred unresolved hat hatred hatred brewing for years that's why we've had a lot more fights that's happening even in the political world because all that thing is just festering there all that disagreement is all festering and so now it begins to come to the surface and it manifests at hatred and then so many countries and Nations it manifests into a becomes a war but we must know where it starts it starts with hatred it starts with something festering within us against somebody else we can take a lesson from that you cannot hold on to your hatred or else you become like them you cannot hold on to your resentment you cannot hold on to your bitterness can you say Amen you cannot hold on to hatred it will eat you up and it'll cause War so we learn a lesson is that when we come to more war we come to an increasing of hatred Nations Rising against more and more being against something people more and more being against something and they're saying it I'm against that I'm against that and jealousy Rises one preacher said it a couple weeks ago I like what he said he said we preach so much about what we were we are against we're preaching about what we're against but why not preach what we're for can I get a witness there's too much preaching about what we're against but why don't we preach what we're for and then if somebody's hungry for more truth if there's a heart that's already hungry you don't have to force that person they're just being honest I'm hungry for more truth I want God in my life I got to have a reality of God I got to have more than a religion more than a form more than just a baptism but something that puts me in touch with allmighty God it's got to be more than a religion religion people are still scared but when the Holy Spirit comes in when the Holy Ghost comes in then it's just didn't he call the Holy Ghost when he first said it in in John didn't he says I'm going to send you the Holy Ghost and he said it will be a comforter didn't he call the Holy Ghost a comforter isn't man looking for a comfort from things a comfort from pleasures and entertainments but that's not going to get us through these hard times we need a deeper comforter the comforter and then it says many shall be offended many shall be betrayed many shall betray you and then hate and many means it'll increase it we've always have hatred we've always had from the time that Cain slew his brother Abel we've had a Cain was a murderer where did that come from didn't come from God Cain killed his own brother after the Garden Eden of Eden Cain that did not come from God when Cain killed his brother where did murder come from came from hatred how did Cain get the hatred why did he get jealous at his brother Abel so right from the very beginning of the Garden of Eden we've had hatred but he says in the end time many it'll increase many shall be offended many shall hate one another that's the climate that we live in hatred and I'll just say it you may be a Christian but if you don't stay covered up in the peace of God and his spirit of in the spirit of God some of that hatred will rub off on you some of that bitterness is trying to come in your heart and you get bitter towards the guy that's sitting next to you where the sister or brother sitting next to you you get bitter about them you get bitter toward your boss you get hatred towards your boss we cannot let the spirit that dominates this world this nation this end time we cannot let it into our heart we have to have something to relieve it we have to have something greater is anybody listening to me tonight we have to have something deeper than just what the world provides I want to read and take this just a step deeper here uh turn with me to James 4:1 from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lust that wore in your members so do you know what he says here I'm going to read it in the Amplified actually I'm going to read it in three different um three different uh versions I guess of the Bible the Amplified and a couple other ones because I want you to understand this from whence comes Wars and fightings among you so now we take it a little bit more personal it's not happening in Israel not happen in Ukraine but there can be war and strife that happens in your own home in your own church in your own family War Strife contention what is the source but he says what is the source of wars and fights among you now come on I'm just G to stop in wait a minute you know there can be Strife happened between brothers and sisters you know that Satan would like you to war against one another to fight against one another to fight against other churches and and and shoot you know misguided missiles over the pulpit to other churches and you see it all goes back to the same Spirit of resentment and jealousy and hatred and their church is not as good as our church all that is there's nothing in that in the kingdom of God we need to get rid of all of that there's no perfect Church can you say Amen there's no perfect Church anywhere there there's we're we're flawed individuals we're flawed human beings that n we all need the same Christ that every human being needs in this world and we need the reality of him but there isn't it's Baptist Pentecostal whatever Church it is here here Among Us it's it's it's all the same because people are the same we need the same God we need the same word that comes from the Lord but you see now he says now so we're all admitting now we can have wars among us we can have Strife in our own home a marriage can have Strife a marriage could have War until there's a divorce right sometimes irreconcilable differences and it's because you had War for 20 years in your marriage somebody said let's just stop the war that's it it's over instead of clinging into Christ to try to get an answer and so you have war in a marriage you can have war in a home you can have war with your children you can have strice Strife that happens among you even in the church but here's what he says in a couple places what is the source read it with me uh James 4:1 and I'll read it in this ver version here what is the source of wars and fights among you don't they come from your passions that wage war within you what is the source of conflict among you what is the source of your disputes don't they come from your Cravings or that are at war in your own lives what is causing all the quars and fights among you isn't it your desires battling inside you so there's a truth here in Scripture that we must admit that if you're complaining about strife and War among you in your home in your family in your church the first place you need to look as the problem is with within your own heart and he says if you're having war and struggles in the marriage and family or with other people with your boss if there's constant struggles and you're being affected by it then you need to look at your own heart because there's actually a war going on in you and there's not supposed to be a war going on in us we're supposed to be carriers of the peace of God we should we're supposed to hold so much peace within us and so much of God within us and the love of God shed abroad in our hearts that it doesn't matter what environment someone could spit in our face and by the way there was a man that spit on David one time and disrespected David and his because David was a type of Christ will never understand this response but it's a Christlike response he spit on him and one of his soldiers David soldiers says he disrespected the king that's it he's done took a sword out ready to do something and David said don't kill him leave him alone God told him to do that Christ coming out of David that response does not come from human beings that comes from Christ David says if I go to the lowest hell God is there he would be with me there it's almost like we live in hell today it's almost like we've already reached it it's just so much so much to it so much hatred Satan's Eden that we live in can you say Amen it's just this whole world is wrong it's it's it's not right there's a few good people in it and I thank God for them I thank God for real people and real Christians and there's some good people thank God for that but the world because they've left the word they're they're getting off track more and more and it's becoming more and more evil all the time and there's more hatred but war on the outside means there's there's war and conflict on the inside unresolved bitterness resentment jealousy see I have to bring this down to our own lives unresolved jealousy unresolved bitterness unresolved anger and Lust For against someone else or towards someone else it's it's it's saying that I I I'm at peace and rest inside with myself with God that's where we need to be is that we need that peace and rest and Holy Spirit dwelling there shed abroad with the love of God in our hearts inside of us can you say Amen towards God towards others and if we have that there'll be less war and strife in our family it's because you're James says you're you're lusting and you're you're struggling within yourself there's something going on within you you need to settle that struggle before you try to settle other Wars you could have all the peace talks that you want to you could have all the family dinners to try to make peace but if you walk into that and your heart is not resolved of the hatred and bitterness it will do no good where is my security that I would be one that could endure all of this endure what endure the hatred endure the people offended endure the the evil that's around us endure the struggle sometimes that's even Among Us Lord how you said endure to the end somebody's going to endure it how do I do it what have you provided for me and in this Romans 5 and verse one therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ if you want to talk about the source of peace in the soul you have to talk about how the great judge said you were guilty but Christ Our lamb went to Cal and paid the price for our sin you can't find a greater peace rise up in a heart to realize I've been justified by God thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting
