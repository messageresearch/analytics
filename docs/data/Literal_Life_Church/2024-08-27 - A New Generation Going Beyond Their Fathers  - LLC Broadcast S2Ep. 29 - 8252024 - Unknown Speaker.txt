Cross The Wonder of his love that's the beauty of the [Music] blood the beauty of the blood Zachariah 1 and uh verse two the Lord hath been so displeased with your fathers and um that term your fathers is something we've been emphasizing because it's throughout the scripture when the new generation is referred back to your fathers the Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers therefore say unto them say unto the new generation thus sayith the Lord of hosts turn ye unto me sayith the Lord of hosts and I will turn unto you saith the Lord of hosts so though the Lord had was displeased with the generations before them and their unbelief he could tell the generation here is your answer you get your eyes off your father's and turn to me and when you turn to me I'll turn and look at you I'll turn to you what a promise amen be ye and this goes further be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have cried saying thus sayith the Lord of hosts turn ye now from from your evil ways and from your evil doings he gave them the same message you need to turn to me and they didn't do it turn you now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor hearken unto me saith the Lord your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live forever so these are questions that he's asking them but my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they returned and said like as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with us I have uh felt moved by the Holy Spirit again to stay in this theme once again of the fathers and uh more specifically moving on the new generation moving on from the mistakes of the fathers and you know when the image of the fathers has not been right uh it can hinder the faith of the next Generations uh it's so powerful this image of the father it's so powerful that it applies both naturally and spiritually in other words when I say the effects of the image of a father not being quite right or being extremely wrong the effects are upon the new generations not only naturally but Also spiritually as well I'm dealing with mostly the spiritual part but in the natural if someone does not have the right image as a father it has long-term effects upon the human being and it can hinder the faith and the and the confidence and the the positive look at life for the Next Generation most of my time has been spent on the spiritual side uh but so much could be said uh on the natural side and uh the victory that comes when someone rises above the damage of a daddy there's great Victory when someone can get a hold of something real and they rise in their life above the damage that their Daddy has done that's the Victory and that's why I like to preach about it is because it's not just to talk about the damage that's done but to talk about the victory in Jesus Christ there's Victory in Jesus Christ there there's healing in Jesus Christ there's healing in his word can you say Amen damages you you we ought to take all of our damages in life emotionally mentally in our Soul we ought to take all the damage and we ought to bring it to one person and that's the Lord because he knows how to not only repair it but heal it so so much could be said about this but the but the wounds in the heart that were left by a daddy can be healed and we see that that can take place the answer is never to bury those damages inside of your spirit um that's not the answer it is so powerful sometimes you can hide it you can bottle it up this this damage from a father you can try to hide it you can try to cover it up but but that damage will stay there it doesn't go away easy it stays with you can can I get an amen this morning this these things are not things that are theories these are things after 6,000 years of human history that then when there's Damage Done to the spirit particularly by a father it doesn't go away easy it stays with you because the image of our father actually becomes if it's tainted becomes our image of our heavenly father we we associate it together in other words it gets Blended together especially for a young child if the image is not right then we we tend to associate it when somebody introduces us to the heavenly father if it's tainted with our Earthly father sometimes not always but it can be tainted that we don't trust this heavenly father and so now that's a real uh that's a real work of the Lord and the the answer is never to buried inside it is so powerful it won't go away that's how much effect it has on the human being there is a a normal incredible love that is supposed to come from our human fathers but most can't provide all of that love the fathers most of them cannot provide all of it because they didn't get that normal love themselves so how can they provide it all unless Christ comes in their life how can they fill those voids when they didn't get the proper love the themselves amen so we're talking about generational things here but I'm one who believes in the healing of the blood of Jesus Christ I'm one who believes that the Christ blood was not just the for the healing of the body or for the healing of the soul but Christ's blood was for the healing of Wounded Spirits on the inside as well our atonement is a complete atonement when he went to Calvary he didn't just provide for physical healing for us or to heal our soul his atonement is a complete atonement when he said it is finished then the healing for mankind is completely finished I believe in it and and then we should be I believe it heals all of the spirits that are been become wounded and damaged and then we we should be open to whatever way God uses to bring healing sometimes one word from an unexpected source can heal you just like that and basically it doesn't have to come through preachers it can come through anyone but you see you have to be open to how God heals because sometimes it's one word spoken by somebody a a word fitly spoken Solomon says a word fitly spoken in due season is like ashes of gold and pictures of silver it's a word fitly in other words a word that's anointed something that's said and that's it it drops it in there heals the heal human heart sometimes it happens instantaneously like that in other words it's it's very sometimes it's very quick but sometimes it's a healing that takes place over time God uses different sources sometimes it's music do you know God heals through the right kind of music sometimes it's a word sometimes it's preaching sometimes but we get all the credit we give all the glory back to God's power that is able to heal often I think of having prayer lines not only just for physical healing but for mental healing for emotional healing this seems to be not as emphasized but I guarantee you when we went through the healing Revival and we had so many healing campaigns most of them sparring off of William brandham when we had all the healing campaigns there was a great thrust to see the power of God be able to heal someone of the worst diseases even raise the dead there was a great thrusts for that but you see now after 40 50 60 years of uh of what people have been feeding on and what they and the breakdown of the American family it's not just physical healing that we need but there's a mental breakdown in our society and now we need more than ever the blood of Jesus Christ to bring healing to the human Spirit can I get an amen this morning we could have a healing campaign for that because there's a lot of people that we counsel and we deal with even within the church sometimes and they need something and I can know sometimes I don't have the answers except this that his atonement is complete he has provided what we need and it's for you this morning Hallelujah and so then we we should be open to how God uses it you know and so I've looked at a lot of information in the last few weeks I've studied the behavior of someone who did not have a father the behaviors that come from someone when they grow up who who was mistreated by their father uh I've studied someone who has a uh has had a a father physically in the home but they're not emotionally connected they've had their father there their whole lives around them but he really wasn't around he was home but he wasn't really home and so I've studied the behavior that comes in the adults that comes from this and all this behavior of course is documented and I haven't spent a lot of time bringing it up here uh but it brings holes in the heart it brings trait sometimes and I like to understand this behavior and these traits why why brother Paul why do you study that why do you understand the traits and the behavior well uh because I like to help people right that's the simplest answer I like to help people I like to relate to people I like to understand if I can what they're going through and where things come from so if that that's just a a feeble answer then uh that it is what it is I the reason I do it is I like to help people I like to understand PE people I like to get down where they are but I like to study things because I like to get where people at why why do I study this so so you know here's another reason so that I can judge them with Godlike judgment because if I take a quick conclusion about something and I don't understand better I can quickly conclude even about the answers and think that's the answer but I have to pray about the answer because sometimes the answer for one person may not be the answer for the next person so I want to understand better so I can administer Godlike judgment to the situation and you all know that we're supposed to administer Godlike conclusions Godlike discernment and Godlike to judgment Godlike judgment in matters that are rated related to human beings in Corinthians Paul said the people were going to law with one another and SU one another he said you shouldn't have to do that if you have the right to zern with among one another you would judge manners in a mature way but because they didn't have the maturity they judged things in an immature way and they were judging one another and so now I like to judge people with a Godlike judgment and a Godlike love can you say Amen that doesn't quickly judge them and write them off because they're having this problem it's another reason I like to study it not not to draw a quick conclusion to love people on a deeper level God always tries to get to the cause God is a doctor who gets to the cause and I want to be that type of doctor I want to be that type of believer you should want to be that type of person as a Christian can you say Amen is that you don't want to just quickly judge somebody by the symptoms that you see but to pray and say God but what is the cause of this and then you can love deeper amen then it's not just the quick answers like I've heard from ministers all due respect every answers you need the Holy Ghost you just need the Holy Ghost you just need the Holy Ghost come and be a pastor with me 35 years and deal with some people who go through seasons of their life they have the Holy Ghost in their life but they go through Seasons so that's not the answer you just need the Holy Ghost sometimes it is sometimes people need the Holy Ghost but it's not to catch all answer for everything yes why because God has a great Gospel of good news here and he has a great atonement here and it doesn't just it covers everything but you see God wants to get the cause of the problem and heal it that's how much he loves religion is a covering that covers up things sometimes the reason I like to get to the bottom of things is and how the Lord helped me do that is because if the person comes in the office and they know all the the quotes and they've already got the answers sometimes I don't know why they're in there cuz they're already and they're quoting this and and they already got it figured out but if they're real extremely spiritual in their talk sometimes they can be covering up through that religion it's not real spirituality it's a religion and religion is a covering religion is not Deliverance religious is just covering it up I know this is really striking with some of you this morning but I want to be open and honest we are not called in this message message to another religion religion is only a covering to cover up the real problem this message is not religion can you say Amen this message is deliverance and total Deliverance but religion covers up and when they go into that oh that super I'm just sitting back and saying oh we got to get over this thing because this is what Adam and Eve did in the garden they were hiding they were hiding in with their fig leaves which is a religion covering they're hiding from God because of the guilt of their sin and God took that situation and said you've got the wrong thing covering up you're trying to hide you're you're trying to cover this up that's not the way I deal with things I deal with things through blood I don't deal with with you covering up so he had to call them out of hiding in this case they were hiding behind the piano and say Adam and Eve you got to come out here you've got to take those fig leaves off that will not work can you say Amen first thing you got to do is come out of hiding and guess what it was the grace of God to call them out of hiding I might be preaching to you this morning to call you out of your hiding I might preach to you five years before you come out of your hiding but don't sit and hide behind a religion I'm in the message I'm okay I dress right I say all the right things but don't hide things that are unresolved in your life because the Holy Ghost will call you out of hiding because he has something better for you somebody ought to say Amen this morning because when you're hiding under religion and under the quotes and under I'm in the message for 30 years you might be hiding something but this isn't a hiding gospel this is a gospel of Deliverance it's openness it's honesty before our God come out from there come out of there get rid of those fig leaves goes over there and brother bra talks about it rips that animal skin apart it's all bloody it's dirty takes that animal skin and throws it over there to them and said put that on and he's starting to say what the answer will be it'll be blood you cover yourself in the blood of the Lamb oh somebody ought to praise the Lord for the blood of Jesus Christ this morning the atonement the token of God and guess what it wasn't Adam and Eve running towards God asking for help they were hiding you know they did the same thing in the days of Gideon there so afraid of the enemy they were hiding in caves and hiding in in all kinds of hideouts and all God's people were scared to death and they were hiding that's not the answer to hide people miss church for four and five years they go they go into hiding and think that's the answer that's not the answer the answer is to expose yourself to the presence of God whether it's church or anywhere else to say Lord here I am it should have been Adam and Eve coming out of hiding and saying Lord we messed up we sinned hallah help us Lord but it wasn't them running after like us human beings it was them running back towards God it was God running towards them trying to find him Adam Adam where are you it wasn't Adam saying God God where are you at I got to find you was God saying Adam where are you my sons and daughters of God where are you where'd you go are you did you run away to California did you run away to Texas try to get away from everything and God's saying Adam where are you he's coming and finding you and so God Ran after them to get him out of their hiding and uh the Fig Leaf conversations happen a lot I shouldn't say a lot of times but sometimes in my office it's fig Leaf conversations and God had to get Adam and eat out of their fig leaves to the blood don't act real religious when there's stuff way hidden unresolved in your hearts why because it's not over till it's over it's the simplest way to say it there's another one that says it's not over to the fat lady sings but I won't use that one this morning it's not over till it's over in other words unless you come to the resolve and you're delivered completely it's not over till it's over so you stay with it until it's over good open honest real raw conversation is a good place to start but then I'm not staying there I like to study the behavior to not only help me be able to see people the right way but not just to stay there and study the behaviors of uh children of fathers that weren't there or fatherless children that's not the reason I studied just so I can understand that but to point them to and to watch a real victory of people with daddy issues to watch a real Victory come in their lives I not only study the behavior but the keys that unlock the door to their Victory because the keys that unlock the door to Victory are in the lord they're in the word we have the keys to the kingdom can you say amen and so now in Zechariah 1 I believe is one of the keys in my text it says in and it's it's not the only reference to your fathers he says your fathers I was displeased with your fathers don't be like your fathers and then the key turn to me and I will turn to you turn to me this is a key it's that your fathers have done this I don't want you to be like your fathers I don't want you to act out what they did they displease me and throughout the scripture he talks about I was grieved with that generation and remember friends in this series that I'm preaching it was the generation that come under a prophet that he became grieved with wasn't worldly people it wasn't in Egypt it was the generation who for 40 years in the wilderness had a lack of faith to go on to the promise they they had unbelief they had complaints they never would rise in faith to say let's stop doing this let's stop circling the mountain and let's move on to our full inheritance in this they never would do that they Circle the mountain and God said you've circled it long enough it's time to go northward it's time to get past your past it's time to get past what your fathers have made of this law and this messag it's time to find out what it's really about can you say amen and so he says in this key he says turn to me and I will turn to you if your eyes are on just your father's it won't work could this be a key if you keep your eyes your whole life on your father and maybe what he did wrong you'll never get Victory but Christ says here's the answer turn to me right look at me and if your eyes are just on that it won't work turn and look toward me and uh there's a scripture in the New Testament you're familiar with looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith get your eyes on Jesus look unto Jesus the author your originator when you came in he was the originator the reason you came in but he's not just the originator he's the finisher of the work so look unto Jesus so he can finish the work in your life get your eyes off your fathers get your eyes off the past turn and get your eyes on me it turn and look towards me and I will turn and look at you now can you imagine friends the power of this that you're actually you're looking at him and he's looking at you you have turned only towards him he is an it's an audience of one where you shut everything else out when you shut the past out when you shut everything else all I need you to do is get your eyes looking at me turn to me and I'll turn to you notice the power of this I just I I don't know why I have an image of my mind but a father and a son or a father and daughter they can't even look each other in the eye after all the years of bitterness and then all of a sudden they get the trust to do that and there's repentance and there's heartfelt conversations and there's a beginning of some type of restoration and finally they can look one another in the eye and when that child looks in the Father's Eyes they see love coming out of his eyes eyes can say a lot can you say Amen you don't have to say something sometimes times but the eyes tell a lot that's why all the scriptures talking about we're beholding him we look at him we're b beholding in a glass with this message we're looking at something it's transforming us it's changing us well who we looking at not a bunch of laws and rituals we're looking at the person of Christ and as we look it changes us even without us trying to change ourself you keep looking at him he changes you from glory to glory you have the opportunity to rise to the occasion is that whatever is smudged from the past and wrong from the past I can leave that I can exit that and I can come to a real relationship with the father and the one thing I want to have is a relationship every day with my father I want to look into his eyes amen I wish above all things that you'd prosper and be in good health as your soul prospers God wants to prosper us God wants to bless us God wants to multiply us but what did he really want to do he wanted to pour himself into his son and pour himself into his sons and daughters you can go live your life you can get your career you can do all these things but the most essential thing young person in your life is that you come to this place of Oneness with the father and he pours his Spirit into you thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by
