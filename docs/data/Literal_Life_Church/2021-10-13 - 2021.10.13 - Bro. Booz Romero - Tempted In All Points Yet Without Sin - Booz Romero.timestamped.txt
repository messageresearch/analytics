[0:00] have the scripture there so you don't
[0:01] have to turn on it if you don't want to
[0:03] but it's good for you to bring your
[0:05] bible to the house of the lord
[0:07] amen
[0:09] when you have it you can say amen
[0:14] all right it says for we have not unhide
[0:16] priests which we which cannot be touched
[0:19] uh with the feeling of our infirmities
[0:22] but was in all points tempted like as we
[0:25] are yet
[0:27] without sin
[0:29] let us therefore come baldly unto the
[0:31] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[0:34] and find grace to help in time of need
[0:38] amen
[0:39] another scripture here on second
[0:41] corinthians chapter second chapter verse
[0:44] 11
[0:46] and paul writing to the corinthians he
[0:49] tells them least
[0:50] satan shall get an advantage of us for
[0:53] we are not ignorant of his devices amen
[0:57] if we can bow our heads tonight heavenly
[0:59] father once again we're we're so
[1:01] grateful or we're so glad to be in your
[1:04] house lord thank you for this
[1:05] opportunity that you have given us
[1:08] for us that we can be here lord and hear
[1:10] from your word lord if there is a desire
[1:13] in the heart of your children and if
[1:15] there is a desire in my heart lord is
[1:17] that you speak to us tonight lord that
[1:20] may i be able to step out of the way so
[1:22] that you can use me lord for your glory
[1:25] not for me to be just here and and and
[1:28] give a speech lord but that that
[1:30] wouldn't bring anything good lord but if
[1:32] you are here as we were hearing on
[1:34] sunday just one word from you lord that
[1:37] will be sufficient that will be enough
[1:39] for us tonight father we love and give
[1:41] you thanks we commend our lives and
[1:44] everything from this uh moment onward in
[1:47] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:48] pray and we can say amen
[1:51] you may have your seats
[1:58] it's kind of
[1:59] interesting for me because it's the
[2:00] first time that i have to
[2:02] um i i would say preach
[2:05] in this specific facility so it's a
[2:09] little bit kind of intimidating you know
[2:11] it's like you see well it's a good thing
[2:13] it's not on a sunday
[2:16] but anyway the lord is good amen so
[2:19] again uh is
[2:21] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[2:23] so um
[2:26] good
[2:28] so
[2:29] if we can put here the first quote that
[2:30] we have here is in uh
[2:33] i would like to title tonight tempted in
[2:36] all points yet without sin
[2:40] tempted in all points
[2:42] yet without sin so as we were singing
[2:45] there is nobody like you lord certainly
[2:48] there is no one like him amen
[2:50] he was tempted in all points yet without
[2:53] sin so
[2:54] i want to bring it in from a different
[2:56] perspective maybe
[2:58] this what i would like to talk to you
[3:00] tonight so
[3:02] uh the prophet of god uh
[3:04] he says god always deals
[3:07] he kind of he god is kind of you know
[3:09] the numerology of god is beautiful he he
[3:12] talks about 3 4 5
[3:14] 6 7 8 10 12 24
[3:18] 40 50.
[3:20] i hope you you know all of those uh so
[3:23] tonight we're gonna be focusing on this
[3:25] what what is number three he says like
[3:27] there's three things god always deals in
[3:30] trees we know the third pole and we know
[3:33] all those things in always in three men
[3:36] we know that he is perfected in three so
[3:38] we can say that three is a number of
[3:40] perfection amen remember in the days of
[3:43] noah they went in the ark and in the
[3:45] days of of sodom jesus was speaking of
[3:48] these two days of sodom they went out
[3:51] they went in in noah's time
[3:54] they went out in sodom's time and then
[3:57] we are going up in this time yes go you
[4:01] go in you go out but now we're going up
[4:04] amen that's what we need now we need a
[4:06] going up affair amen we need a going up
[4:09] from these things and worldly things
[4:11] that's got us bound down here amen so
[4:15] again number three as i said is a number
[4:18] of uh perfection number of uh that god
[4:21] will always deal like father son and
[4:22] holy ghost is only one amen a god in
[4:26] three offices amen and then when when
[4:29] when god came through the fro through
[4:31] the prophet it was uh the first second
[4:34] and third pool amen and then uh when
[4:37] when when we're talking about the work
[4:39] of grace we're talking about
[4:41] justification sanctification and then we
[4:43] need to have the baptism of the holy
[4:45] spirit amen so you see god works in
[4:48] three all the time and if you're in
[4:49] number two you need to have a number
[4:51] three amen if you are living under
[4:53] sanctification that is not enough if
[4:56] you're if you're living under
[4:57] justification that is not enough you
[4:59] need to get to a third except which is
[5:01] being filled with the holy ghost
[5:04] amen that's why his word is perfect god
[5:07] never fails amen there was one bible
[5:09] that was written where was it written in
[5:11] the skies and then there was one bible
[5:14] written where in the the pyramids and
[5:16] then now we have this bible
[5:18] and even greater now the same bible is
[5:21] being made flesh in our hearts
[5:24] amen
[5:25] so now
[5:27] praise the lord that feels good amen
[5:30] amen so now if we think a little bit and
[5:33] we're going to if you have your bibles
[5:35] we're going to put it here as well but
[5:36] uh we're gonna be going to the book of
[5:38] uh luke chapter four
[5:41] and and then we're gonna be focusing our
[5:42] evening amen if we we may take 45
[5:46] minutes 40 minutes i don't know five
[5:47] minutes when god was with moses he did
[5:49] with him five minutes and he took away
[5:51] everything that he learned in 40 years
[5:55] so if it is five minutes tonight praise
[5:57] the lord if it is 40 minutes praise the
[5:59] lord but somebody said
[6:01] we should be we it should be an hour
[6:03] because we are in the message of the
[6:04] hour
[6:07] get that brother paul
[6:13] it's not a doctrine
[6:15] sorry we cannot take it
[6:17] amen
[6:18] so now
[6:20] luke chapter 4. so and then it says in
[6:23] jesus being filled of the holy ghost he
[6:25] returned from jordan and was led by the
[6:28] spirit into the wilderness
[6:30] that's where we want to start there
[6:32] first of all so every single time
[6:36] the enemy wanted to deal with people he
[6:38] will always stay take them to the
[6:40] wilderness or god will take them to the
[6:42] wilderness for them to be tested number
[6:45] one if you think about the children of
[6:46] israel in in the in the wilderness when
[6:49] they were out in the wilderness we don't
[6:50] have the scripture here but if you want
[6:52] to take note is in exodus 17 chapter uh
[6:56] chapter 17 verse one through three and
[6:58] it says that the the people they were um
[7:02] they were thirsting for water and they
[7:05] were moses gave us water so they failed
[7:07] the task because they could just say
[7:09] speak to the rocket and moses was was
[7:12] angry and what did he do he he smote the
[7:15] rock amen so in the wilderness they
[7:18] failed the test
[7:19] amen and then in lukas 8 in luke 8 29 it
[7:23] says for he commanded the unclean spirit
[7:26] to come out of the man for oftentimes it
[7:28] had caught him and he was kept bound
[7:31] with chains and in fair in feathers and
[7:33] he break the bands and was driven of the
[7:36] devil into where the wilderness
[7:39] children of israel they failed the tests
[7:42] in the wilderness
[7:43] this demon possessed man was always
[7:46] taken by the devil into the wilderness
[7:48] and then if you read david he was in the
[7:51] wilderness when he was uh was facing
[7:54] saul and then when he was there then
[7:56] he was got the opportunity to kill that
[7:59] anointed of the lord but what did he do
[8:02] he's like no i
[8:04] saved me lord or
[8:06] forbid me lord to kill the anointed of
[8:09] the lord
[8:10] in the wilderness
[8:13] so
[8:15] as we we have heard you know it's like
[8:17] um christ
[8:19] there is a antitype the old testament
[8:21] was the antitype but then christ was he
[8:24] came to fulfill all those types of the
[8:26] old testament he he came now to tell us
[8:29] that even though he will go to the
[8:31] wilderness but he was going to have to
[8:33] prove something
[8:36] so as we see here luke chapter 4 he was
[8:39] taken into the wilderness but one thing
[8:43] he was filled with the holy spirit
[8:46] so if there is a wilderness in your life
[8:49] tonight make sure that the holy spirit
[8:52] is with you
[8:53] and not just with you within you amen
[8:56] and then luke chapter 4 verse 2 it says
[8:58] being 40 days tempted of the devil
[9:02] and in those days he did he did nothing
[9:05] and when they were ended he afterward
[9:08] afterward hunger
[9:12] number is a number of judgment is an is
[9:15] a number of that the lord has to to try
[9:18] someone you know 40 days 40 nights was
[9:20] was raining when when uh uh
[9:23] noah was was in the ark and now we see
[9:26] jesus 40 days he was fasting and then he
[9:29] was praying and then all of a sudden
[9:31] filled with the holy spirit now the lord
[9:33] take him to the wilderness and there
[9:35] satan was waiting for him
[9:37] so i was reading this scripture and
[9:39] never had seen this before because we
[9:41] always hear that you know the first
[9:43] attempt second attempt third attempt but
[9:45] i've never noticed that he was he was in
[9:48] the wilderness 40 days tempted by the
[9:51] devil
[9:52] and then if you think about your about
[9:54] your life how many days have you been
[9:56] tempted by the devil if it is one then
[9:58] you are defeated
[10:00] but as we read he was tempted in all
[10:03] things without sin in other words he was
[10:06] able to prove that even though you can
[10:09] have a a a constant
[10:12] test or trial or tribulation but
[10:15] out of all of those the lord will
[10:17] deliver you
[10:20] amen
[10:21] amen
[10:23] amen the devil will always
[10:25] always come to challenge you in all the
[10:27] areas of your life when you're tired
[10:29] when you're hungry when you feel
[10:30] defeated when you feel sad
[10:33] where are you drawing your strength from
[10:35] when you are feeling defeated where are
[10:38] you drawing your strength from when when
[10:40] you are feeling feeling tempted are you
[10:43] are you drawing it from the word of god
[10:45] or are you yielding to that temptation
[10:51] and simple you know how many people have
[10:53] we heard that they were feeling sad and
[10:54] they committed suicide or committed
[10:57] murder
[10:58] why because they gave the enemy
[11:00] opportunity to work through them
[11:04] but look before jesus was tempted he was
[11:06] filled with the holy spirit he was
[11:08] filled with the holy ghost and that was
[11:09] the only way he could overcome his enemy
[11:12] so tonight if you don't have the holy
[11:14] ghost it is time for you to say lord
[11:16] give me of that
[11:18] that in the time in the day of my
[11:20] temptation i can be an overcomer
[11:23] [Music]
[11:24] same things for us tonight we have to be
[11:26] filled with the holy spirit
[11:28] to be able to overcome the enemy as paul
[11:30] says i die daily
[11:32] how many can say tonight lord i want to
[11:34] die daily to my desires i want to die
[11:37] daily to to my cravings to do the things
[11:40] that i love to watch lord i want to lie
[11:42] daily to those
[11:45] amen
[11:47] and then this is beautiful because do
[11:48] you know that god also made us intrigue
[11:52] amen body spirit and soul in the youth i
[11:55] talked to them about it like a few
[11:56] fridays ago but we added more so please
[11:58] don't don't fall asleep on me
[12:04] these three
[12:06] these three bodies spirit and soul these
[12:09] three they have senses that if they are
[12:10] not controlled by the spirit of god
[12:12] there is where the enemy is going to get
[12:14] ahold of it and make us fall
[12:18] what's in the in our body we have five
[12:20] senses that see you you know you see you
[12:22] taste you feel you smell and you hear
[12:24] and then in your spirit you have five
[12:26] you have memory you know how beautiful
[12:28] it is when we remember the things that
[12:29] the lord has done for us but how bad it
[12:31] is when the enemy tries to remind us the
[12:34] the mistakes or or our past sins
[12:38] memory imagination conscience conscious
[12:41] conscience affections and reasoning
[12:45] that's my car
[12:46] memory imagination conscious affections
[12:49] and reasonings
[12:52] then we have the soul
[12:54] in your soul you either have faith or
[12:56] you have doubt
[12:58] amen
[13:00] so god made us in three parts as well
[13:02] but he wants to dwell in the soul
[13:04] because if he dwells in the soul then
[13:06] there's gonna be faith and it won't be
[13:08] just any type of faith but it will be
[13:10] perfect faith
[13:12] and the perfect god now is dwelling in a
[13:14] perfect people
[13:16] amen
[13:18] so body
[13:19] spirit in the soul
[13:22] in this first challenge the enemy came
[13:24] in how jesus was feeling so now we go to
[13:27] the first challenge it was like how do
[13:28] you feel jesus and the bible says that
[13:31] he was feeling hungry
[13:33] imagine that he haven't had a a piece of
[13:35] bread in 40 days
[13:39] how many days do we fast
[13:41] if we fast one day they were feeling
[13:42] tired and hungry and
[13:46] that we're to die
[13:50] but jesus was 40 days
[13:55] can you imagine that god being in a
[13:56] human form
[13:57] how hungry he must he must have been but
[14:00] there was a time to eat
[14:02] there was a time to fast
[14:05] and but this is not when
[14:07] in in this specific challenge is not
[14:10] when the the enemy wanted him to eat is
[14:13] when he was feeling that it was his time
[14:15] to eat
[14:17] amen
[14:19] but
[14:20] but he's when when jesus wanted to eat
[14:22] and and and in other words as brother
[14:24] has said before you have been called to
[14:26] control things
[14:28] and not letting things to control you
[14:31] if we can say those things could be the
[14:33] enemy trying to attack you every day but
[14:35] you have the power of god that you can
[14:37] say hey hey this is this this prop this
[14:40] is this belongs to jesus so guess what i
[14:42] have to control it i have to control my
[14:44] emotions i have to control my my spirit
[14:47] and all i know and all the senses that
[14:49] are there that need to have some control
[14:53] so the enemy first he came through how
[14:56] jesus was feeling
[14:58] and then he says and the devil said unto
[15:00] him if thou be the son of god command
[15:03] this this stone that it be made bread
[15:06] and jesus answered saying it is written
[15:09] that men shall not live by bread alone
[15:12] but by every word of god
[15:16] god has always equipped us with
[15:18] something that will always defeat the
[15:20] enemy and this is what the prophet of
[15:22] god said
[15:23] he said in the in the quran he says
[15:25] satan take him up on the temple
[15:28] and and and white watch the scriptures
[15:30] for him he says as it is written
[15:33] again he taking him up on the mountain
[15:35] show him all the kingdoms and jesus said
[15:37] it is written that was his answer and
[15:40] and he and he defeated the the devil by
[15:43] the word
[15:45] amen
[15:47] he defeated the devil by the word of god
[15:50] he never used any power at all
[15:53] he was bringing every divine blessing
[15:56] down to to the rich of the humblest and
[15:59] weakest of christians so what is it that
[16:02] you can answer back to the devil and say
[16:04] it is written
[16:05] it is written
[16:07] amen
[16:08] as long as you believe that that is the
[16:10] word of god as it is written you will
[16:13] defeat satan anywhere anytime and on any
[16:18] condition
[16:19] so tonight it doesn't matter the
[16:21] condition that you may find yourself
[16:25] the word of god will defeat it
[16:27] if it is something that is coming
[16:29] against his work against his work he
[16:31] will be defeated because the word of god
[16:34] will defeat the devil anywhere anytime
[16:37] in under any condition or any
[16:40] circumstance
[16:42] and that is the word of god
[16:44] that's what we were saying that jesus
[16:45] was filled with the holy ghost is what
[16:47] we're looking for that we have to read
[16:49] the book we have to read our bible we
[16:52] have to come to church
[16:54] [Applause]
[16:56] people want want to live victorious
[16:58] lives but then you you look at their
[17:00] prayer life you look you look at how
[17:03] consecrated they are and then there is
[17:04] nothing then that's why they feel
[17:06] defeated all the time
[17:08] but it is time for us to be serious with
[17:11] god and say lord if there is something
[17:13] that i am lacking tonight may you help
[17:15] me to recognize it because once you
[17:18] recognize that he is willing to give you
[17:20] what you're looking for
[17:22] amen
[17:24] amen
[17:27] feels good
[17:31] now listen brother branham says
[17:33] listen to this closely
[17:35] any divine promise of god
[17:37] then he says the right mental attitude
[17:40] towards any divine promise of god
[17:43] will bring it to pass
[17:45] what's your attitude towards the world
[17:47] what is your attitude when you the
[17:49] pastor is preaching here what is your
[17:51] attitude when the pastor says that
[17:53] they're going to be special meetings and
[17:54] people set up trips and everything
[17:56] knowing that there were going to be
[17:57] special meetings
[17:59] i get it when you have vacation fine but
[18:01] when you know in advance
[18:04] just letting you know
[18:11] that's what they say at work you know
[18:13] you have already set a vacation before
[18:14] and then they set up a meeting then we
[18:16] understand
[18:18] but if if you set up a meeting or you
[18:19] said something that you don't want to be
[18:21] in the house of the lord there is not
[18:22] the right mental attitude towards the
[18:24] promises of god
[18:29] because many times when when a person
[18:31] you know people is living defeated lives
[18:33] and then when they need god then they
[18:34] come and they are the first that are
[18:36] asking for prayer
[18:38] but when you ask them where is your
[18:39] prayer life when you're where is your
[18:41] reading life and there is nothing so how
[18:43] how do you want to overcome if we're
[18:44] saying here that the only way that can
[18:46] overcome the devil or that can defeat
[18:48] the devil is the word of god
[18:50] there's nothing else
[18:52] there is not a five step a 10 step 100
[18:54] step to to to to be saved no it is the
[18:57] word of god
[19:01] if you look at the word of god right and
[19:03] believe it and that's the way it is
[19:05] written say god it is your word
[19:08] and take the right mental attitude
[19:10] towards that divine promise it will
[19:13] bring it to pass
[19:14] i was thinking lord if you have given a
[19:16] promise then i am a carrier of that
[19:19] promise now you have to bring the
[19:21] promise to pass in my life
[19:26] if whether it is your children where is
[19:28] it whether it is a new job where
[19:31] whatever it is if i'm taking the right
[19:33] attitude it will bring it to pass
[19:37] then you say god it is your word
[19:40] and take the right mental attitude
[19:41] towards that divine promise it will
[19:42] bring it to pass because there is no
[19:44] defeat
[19:46] faith cannot be defeated
[19:51] there is no defeat to faith
[19:54] amen
[19:56] there is no defeat to faith
[19:59] amen
[20:00] now that was the first challenge for him
[20:04] coming
[20:05] to how he was feeling coming to his
[20:08] outer outer feelings that he was feeling
[20:10] hungry
[20:12] he was coming to his body and saying he
[20:13] was like hey you're hungry you haven't
[20:15] had a chick-fil-a for 40 days
[20:19] to bring it to our days you know
[20:21] the lord's chicken amen
[20:25] making some commercial there i hope they
[20:27] break they they
[20:28] edit it amen
[20:31] you know you haven't had a meal for 40
[20:32] days now you can have it but it's like
[20:34] it's not when you want it said
[20:37] it's when i want it because i i am now
[20:39] in control of all things
[20:43] that's the promise for us today amen we
[20:45] are not here to be defeated
[20:48] the children of god are overcomers amen
[20:53] and that was the first challenge amen
[20:55] he was coming to him through the outside
[20:57] amen and the second challenge in in luke
[21:00] chapter 4 chapter four i mean yeah
[21:03] chapter four verse five
[21:04] and the and then it says and the devil
[21:07] taking him up into an high mountain
[21:10] show him
[21:12] all the kingdoms of the world in a
[21:14] moment of time
[21:16] and then the devil said unto him
[21:18] all this power
[21:20] will i give thee and the glory of them
[21:24] for that is delivered unto me
[21:26] and to whosoever i will give it
[21:29] if thou therefore will worship me and
[21:32] shall be dying
[21:34] all shall be dying
[21:36] and jesus answered and said unto him get
[21:39] thee behind me satan for it is written
[21:42] thou shalt worship the lord thy god in
[21:44] him only shall thou serve
[21:48] it is written it is written it is
[21:50] written
[21:51] now look what was the second challenge
[21:54] it was it was about power
[21:56] it was about authority what we have been
[21:59] hearing from our pastor amen it was
[22:01] about worshiping something we know by
[22:04] the word of god that worship is not
[22:06] about just raising our hands or singing
[22:09] or or or or or
[22:11] things like that
[22:12] that is the result of worship but
[22:15] worship is about submitting to something
[22:20] as the enemy is telling hear jesus i can
[22:23] give them to you but you have to worship
[22:25] me or you have to submit yourself to me
[22:30] amen
[22:31] that's how the enemy sometimes comes
[22:33] against us every day
[22:35] you know if you worship me
[22:38] i can give you more popularity i can
[22:39] give you more kingdoms i can give you
[22:41] whatever you want you just have to
[22:43] submit yourself to my bondage because
[22:46] that is what the enemy gives
[22:48] he gives depression anxiety anxiety
[22:52] loneliness sadness bitterness
[22:57] but when we submit ourselves to the
[22:59] right kingdom
[23:02] and jesus said
[23:03] that there was a kingdom coming
[23:06] and then he says the kingdom of the
[23:08] kingdom of god is among us
[23:12] he was referring about what the holy
[23:14] spirit that can live in the heart of a
[23:16] person and that can can that can control
[23:19] the body the spirit and the soul
[23:22] because that's a result when you receive
[23:24] the holy spirit now you're under under a
[23:26] headship now you are under a new 30 and
[23:29] that that is the authority of the lord
[23:31] jesus christ
[23:34] what can that submission bring to you it
[23:36] will always bring good things
[23:38] even when we pray and we don't get what
[23:41] we desire but but as we are submitted to
[23:44] him we will be content with the results
[23:47] [Applause]
[23:48] lord i want this red car well what if
[23:50] door gives you a black car
[23:53] that's okay
[23:54] you should be content with the results
[23:59] this is this second challenge
[24:01] was about submitting
[24:04] what's about who is my authority
[24:07] so if i ask you tonight who is your
[24:09] authority
[24:10] jesus says jesus said they shall be
[24:12] known by their fruits
[24:17] i i'm like i'm going to take this off
[24:18] sorry
[24:22] i don't like it i always tell my tell my
[24:24] wife this is like my like the uniform
[24:25] you know when you go up there you have
[24:27] to just stay in your your coat on
[24:30] this worm here it was like just make
[24:33] sure that your ties it's okay it's long
[24:35] enough and the shirt is nice and
[24:37] everything
[24:39] forget about it and let's speak about
[24:40] the word of god
[24:44] my question to you is would you like to
[24:46] give him give god control over
[24:49] everything you have
[24:51] or over everything you are
[24:54] lord
[24:55] all that anxiety all that depression all
[24:59] everything lord i just bring it to you
[25:03] amen that was the second challenge first
[25:04] challenged the outer man second
[25:07] challenge was authority the third
[25:09] challenge and it was luke 4 chapter
[25:12] verse 9 and he said he brought him to
[25:14] jerusalem and he said
[25:17] set him on a pinnacle of the temple and
[25:19] said unto him if thou be the son of god
[25:21] cast itself down from hands
[25:23] for it is written
[25:25] he shall give his angels church over
[25:27] thee to keep thee
[25:29] how beautiful that sounds right
[25:32] and in their hands they shall be verdi
[25:34] up
[25:35] lest list that any time that thou dash
[25:38] thy foot against a stone
[25:41] oh wow that's beautiful because we were
[25:43] saying that jesus was saying it is
[25:45] written and it is written and all of a
[25:47] sudden now the enemy is like it is
[25:49] written
[25:51] how interesting
[25:54] look
[25:55] when the enemy cannot get you through
[25:57] your feelings when he cannot get you
[25:59] through your your submission to god he
[26:02] will try to get you by using god's word
[26:06] partially
[26:08] because then that is what brings
[26:09] confusion
[26:11] what satan was quoting jesus he was
[26:14] quoting it sounded very good however in
[26:17] this third challenge satan was just
[26:20] quoting psalms 91 chapter 11 um i mean
[26:24] chapter
[26:26] 91 verse 11 and verse 12.
[26:30] contrasting
[26:32] because the enemy didn't quote the rest
[26:34] of the chapter and if you read psalms 91
[26:37] 13 in the amplified version it says like
[26:40] this
[26:41] you shall tread upon the lion in adir
[26:44] and the young lion and the serpent
[26:48] show
[26:49] shall you trample
[26:51] under your feet on their foot or oh you
[26:53] will gonna you're gonna put the serpent
[26:55] under your feet
[26:56] why didn't satan quoted that to do to
[26:59] jesus because he was talking about him
[27:03] and that's the beauty of the word of god
[27:05] that we have to take it from cover to
[27:06] cover
[27:08] there was this guy brother branham says
[27:10] he says sure i do believe it this his
[27:13] name was musee and he says i believe it
[27:16] from giver to giver
[27:18] and i will leave and i believe the
[27:20] keyword also because it says holy bible
[27:24] how many can say tonight i believe the
[27:26] bible from keeper to giver
[27:28] because if it says something here those
[27:31] 66 books cannot contradict themselves at
[27:34] all
[27:35] and that is what satan wanted to bring
[27:37] to jesus he was tasting the water he was
[27:40] testing the waters and he wanted to see
[27:43] who was he
[27:45] but he was just answering with the word
[27:47] as we just read that he didn't have to
[27:49] use any power
[27:51] because he had it all
[27:54] but he was just saying you know what
[27:55] satan it is written satan it is written
[27:58] this is my position tonight i believe
[28:01] this bible from kiever to giver or from
[28:04] cover to cover even the first giver that
[28:07] says holy bible
[28:10] amen
[28:12] and when the people is doubting god's
[28:14] word
[28:16] it will always be because they are not
[28:17] reading the entire book
[28:20] when somebody comes with a question
[28:22] brother branham says that if there is a
[28:24] biblical question there will always be a
[28:26] biblical answer
[28:28] but you have to come with a humble heart
[28:30] you have to come you you have to come
[28:32] home humble and say i don't understand
[28:35] this
[28:36] amen so satan cannot if he cannot get
[28:39] you through your feelings he will try to
[28:41] get you through your authority or he
[28:43] will try to get you through what through
[28:44] the word of god
[28:46] and some people say well it's because i
[28:48] was in the old testament
[28:52] what do we say do we read the the old
[28:54] testament and say that was that was kind
[28:56] of it is it is kind of obsolete
[28:59] by any means amen jesus came to fulfill
[29:03] the law and he also came to what to
[29:05] magnify the law
[29:07] amen so that's why we believe the bible
[29:10] that's that's the purpose of the
[29:11] messenger of revelations 10 7 malachi 4
[29:15] 5 that is a purpose to restore us back
[29:18] to everything of the word of god
[29:21] not just one verse of the bible not just
[29:23] the new testament but to every word that
[29:26] cometh out of the word of god
[29:29] so that when we are when you are facing
[29:32] the enemy now you can say it is written
[29:35] it is written satan you are not gonna
[29:37] get me through my feelings satan you're
[29:40] not gonna get me get get me through who
[29:42] am i worshiping satan you're gonna get
[29:45] me through just a portion of the word
[29:47] because i am the word
[29:50] are you the word tonight
[29:52] amen
[30:00] listen the last
[30:02] answer that jesus gave him
[30:04] and jesus answered and said unto him it
[30:07] is said thou shalt not tempt the lord
[30:08] thy god
[30:09] and when the devil had ended all the
[30:12] temptation
[30:15] he departed from him for a season
[30:19] when you have had
[30:21] a a a huge bottle then the enemy is
[30:24] going to leave for a season
[30:26] be ready for that because when when
[30:28] there was a conflict between god and
[30:29] satan he says where where do you want to
[30:31] dwell and he says jesus was like jesus
[30:34] christ was i'm gonna dwell in the heart
[30:36] and he's like well i'm gonna do it in
[30:37] the mind guess what's gonna happen you
[30:39] will still have to fight in every day
[30:41] with your thoughts
[30:44] that's a great that is the greatest
[30:46] conflict that we're gonna face every day
[30:48] of our lives
[30:49] because now the conflict is do i go to
[30:51] church do i serve the lord do i commit
[30:54] my life to god or do i go to in the
[30:56] world
[30:57] and then jesus helping you you're like
[31:00] i'm gonna go to church even though i
[31:01] feel tired i i feel like not worshiping
[31:04] i feel that not not submitted not
[31:06] submitting to the lord but i will go
[31:08] anyway
[31:09] and guess what you have made the right
[31:11] choice
[31:14] and then look what happened in jesus
[31:15] returning the power of the spirit
[31:17] into galilee and there went out of it
[31:20] went out of fame of him through all the
[31:22] regions round about and he thought he
[31:24] thought in their synagogues being
[31:26] glorified of all that was jesus amen
[31:28] look after all the challenges challenges
[31:30] he faced there was victory as you can
[31:33] see there was power of the spirit that
[31:35] brought him to galilee
[31:37] after we face challenges in our lives
[31:40] when the challenge is over and we want
[31:41] through jesus christ we get more power
[31:44] of the spirit
[31:46] every you know every youth meeting we go
[31:49] every time we go to church the lord is
[31:51] preparing us you know as as we read that
[31:53] we are not ignorant of satan's devices
[31:56] anymore because now guess what that's
[31:59] what's gonna happen every time that
[32:00] satan come against you now you can you
[32:03] can respond with the word
[32:06] the enemy can take advantage of us if we
[32:09] are ignorant but we can be satisfied
[32:12] tonight that the lord has cast us not
[32:15] ignorant anymore
[32:17] because now we know how the enemy is
[32:19] going to come because that's the same
[32:20] way the same way he came to jesus 40
[32:22] days and then these three major
[32:24] challenges
[32:26] saying i'm gonna challenge you in your
[32:27] body i'm gonna challenge you in your
[32:29] spirit and i'm gonna question your faith
[32:32] are you gonna respond to that satan it
[32:35] is written i am a child of god
[32:37] satan it is written that everything
[32:40] works for good to them the law of the
[32:42] lore
[32:44] amen
[32:47] why are we saying this that god always
[32:49] works in three in in three
[32:51] satan was doing the same because he's
[32:53] always imitating what god is doing
[32:56] brother and i was listening brother
[32:58] branham was like if there is always a
[32:59] bogus dollar there have to be a real one
[33:02] a real dollar
[33:04] if there is a a a challenge from the
[33:06] enemy and if he's trying to use the
[33:08] number three if he's starting to use the
[33:10] number four or whatever there is always
[33:12] a real one
[33:14] amen
[33:16] and we can say that david also had the
[33:18] same challenges before he faced goliath
[33:21] amen
[33:22] he fought he fought against the bear he
[33:24] fought against a lion and then goliath
[33:27] but guess what he was always ready to
[33:29] fight
[33:30] goliath didn't make any difference
[33:33] why because to god it doesn't matter if
[33:36] your trial if you think that your trial
[33:39] is small or your trial is big is big for
[33:41] god everything is the same
[33:45] we're fighting against listen to these
[33:47] we're fighting already against a
[33:48] defeated satan
[33:52] how should we leave tonight
[33:54] how should we leave tonight
[33:59] the prophet of god says if god
[34:03] who can give me victory over myself
[34:06] and i highlighted that in red
[34:09] because god can give you victory over
[34:12] yourself
[34:13] and guess what this is the prophet of
[34:14] god talking the people the the guy that
[34:17] was almost like god here on earth but he
[34:20] sinned
[34:21] he was a man
[34:24] but if god who can give me victory over
[34:26] myself how many can say amen
[34:29] can surely give me victory over the
[34:32] disease that is trying to take me from
[34:34] him
[34:35] the god that can save me and make me
[34:38] something when i i was not a christian
[34:41] he can make me a christian out of me by
[34:44] believing his word
[34:46] but now we have come to a point that
[34:49] he's not just believing he's putting
[34:51] that belief in action
[34:53] because i was thinking he's like the
[34:55] enemies and the devils the demons they
[34:58] also believe and they tremble
[35:01] but now the children of god have a
[35:03] greater promise that when this world is
[35:05] being materialized it is becoming flesh
[35:08] in their lives now it is not just by
[35:10] believing it is by acting on god's word
[35:14] and guess what
[35:17] it won't be hard
[35:19] why because now i have a prayer a a life
[35:22] of prayer
[35:23] now i have a life consecrated that every
[35:26] time he asks me something i'm gonna do
[35:29] it because it is written
[35:31] amen
[35:33] amen
[35:35] and we who are dead in christ are
[35:37] abraham's seed the other quote please
[35:39] and we are more than conquerors through
[35:41] him who conquer everything for what for
[35:44] me
[35:46] no reason for us to have for us to have
[35:49] to overcome anything because it is
[35:52] already conquered
[35:55] the last enemy sickness death temptation
[36:00] amen temptation what else we have here
[36:03] sorry
[36:06] the prophet of god says temptation all
[36:09] things are put under his feet and we are
[36:12] the seed of abraham being dead in christ
[36:14] we are abraham's seat marching on to
[36:18] victory to victory to victory
[36:23] isn't that interesting that the prophet
[36:24] of god had to say it three times i don't
[36:26] know don't want to make a doctrine out
[36:28] of it but it sounds good
[36:31] holding god's promise out before us and
[36:34] going on
[36:36] abraham's seat with a sworn promise by
[36:39] jehovah god that you will possess
[36:42] the gate
[36:43] of
[36:44] every enemy
[36:46] and that you are gonna
[36:48] put your feet under that serpent
[36:51] if i can tell you something write down
[36:53] that thing that bothers you every day
[36:55] and put it under your foot under your
[36:56] shoe and every day you walk you're
[36:59] saying i am possessing what is mine
[37:01] [Applause]
[37:03] we start by being a mechanic but then
[37:05] the dynamic we'll have to we have to uh
[37:09] make that confession we'll have to
[37:11] quicken that confession
[37:13] amen
[37:15] that feels good
[37:24] you will possess the gates of your enemy
[37:27] the prophet of god says this is not an
[37:29] option
[37:31] you will
[37:34] you are you are possessing the gates of
[37:38] your enemy every day sorry that was my
[37:40] note it's not the prophet of god but
[37:42] it's the same thing
[37:43] not that i'm the prophet but he doesn't
[37:45] receive a prophet there they will
[37:46] receive the prophet's reward amen
[37:49] however you want to call it people call
[37:51] it my depression
[37:53] my lust
[37:54] my anxiety my my my mind
[37:58] you know in the world now they talk
[37:59] about an inclusive language
[38:01] so what if the children of god will use
[38:03] an inclusive language and we start
[38:05] changing our language instead of saying
[38:07] my sickness
[38:08] we send it back to its owner and say the
[38:11] sickness the depression the anxiety the
[38:14] anxiety they don't belong to the temple
[38:17] of god on earth
[38:20] that's me what is his where is his
[38:22] temple or what is in his temple in his
[38:25] term in his temple there is my peace
[38:28] there is my joy there is my forgiveness
[38:32] it's not my sickness it's not my cancer
[38:36] it's not my headache it's not my stomach
[38:38] cake
[38:40] or my cake or whatever
[38:42] it's not my hair ache
[38:45] no it is the enemies and i take it back
[38:48] to him
[38:50] and i and i declare myself tonight he is
[38:53] my joy he is my peace he is my healer he
[38:57] is my healing
[39:00] [Applause]
[39:01] that's a very inclusive language no
[39:06] you can possess all things through
[39:07] christ
[39:09] i was thinking what does it mean to
[39:10] possess the gates of your enemy
[39:12] jesus possessed them
[39:14] he because there was a promise abraham
[39:16] was given a promise and your seed will
[39:19] possess
[39:20] the gates
[39:22] of his enemies
[39:24] in the old day
[39:26] whenever they will go to war
[39:28] against another kingdom that they had
[39:30] gates that nobody could come in or go
[39:33] out of that specific
[39:35] specific city you know if we go back to
[39:36] the to the book of um
[39:40] when they they were in jericho when the
[39:42] people of israel was about to possess
[39:44] jericho and amen it was what was the
[39:46] gates it was a way to protect their city
[39:49] or kingdom from the enemy's attacks
[39:52] when abraham was given a promise that
[39:54] his seat was going to possess the gates
[39:56] of his enemies these enemies this is
[39:58] what the lord was referring to that
[40:00] every time they will face a challenge
[40:02] they will possess and overcome the
[40:04] challenge
[40:07] who is the seed of abraham here tonight
[40:09] amen
[40:11] as soon as the gates were removed from
[40:12] the city
[40:14] then the conquerors were able to get in
[40:17] that city and possess all what was in
[40:19] that city
[40:21] many times the devil will come against
[40:24] against you with gates of identity
[40:26] crisis
[40:29] so that you doubt who you are
[40:32] but let me tell you as you as as soon as
[40:34] you possess that gate then you can see
[40:36] who you are in christ because now you
[40:38] can see what's in the city
[40:42] he wants you to miss out on what god has
[40:45] in store for your life
[40:47] amen but his seed
[40:49] has been called to possess
[40:52] all things
[40:54] all things
[40:55] can you say with me all things
[40:58] amen this is not just a little something
[41:00] a little victory here a little victory
[41:03] over here no all victory victory victory
[41:07] is for the children of god
[41:11] amen
[41:13] the end of the book says revelations 19
[41:16] verse 7 it says let us be glad and
[41:18] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[41:21] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[41:23] wife had made herself ready in other
[41:27] words he is already saying that there is

[42:43] just as you have to be tempted so was he

[46:45] testimony

[47:03] overcome i can the only way that i can
[47:05] overcome is by my testimony

[47:26] then i add more and then i add more and
[47:28] i was like this is gonna be
[47:30] i hope it's not long for you
[47:35] but notice this i want you to look at
[47:37] here after jesus was tempted in all ways
[47:40] he went straight to preach at the
[47:41] synagogue
[47:43] in the same chapter
[47:45] maybe the day after
[47:47] and look the book was given to him
[47:51] he read from an open book
[47:55] only the people of god can partake of
[47:57] the open book
[47:59] in other words only the overcomers can
[48:02] partake of the open book
[48:04] if jesus hadn't overcome the temptation
[48:07] during those 40 days he wouldn't have
[48:10] come to open the book
[48:12] the ministry of reconciliation the
[48:14] ministry of restoration to the people
[48:18] he was able to cry with a loud voice
[48:21] this day
[48:22] this scripture was has been fulfilled in
[48:26] your ears
[48:28] why he said it why your ears because
[48:31] faith cometh by hearing and hearing what
[48:34] the word of god
[48:36] because he just had an encounter because
[48:38] he said it is written satan it is
[48:40] written satan now i can tell to the

[49:03] my children are coming back
[49:05] [Applause]
[49:07] this day
[49:09] this scripture has been fulfilled
[49:11] but he had to go through the wilderness
[49:14] with the holy spirit in him
[49:16] if you're going through your wilderness
[49:18] ask him lord fill me more with you holy
[49:20] spirit

[49:28] luke 4 17-21 it says and there and there
[49:31] was deliver unto him the book of the
[49:33] prophet isaiah
[49:34] and when he had opened the book he found
[49:36] the place where it was written the
[49:38] spirit of the lord is upon me
[49:42] and then there were six things that he
[49:43] was sent to the he because he had
[49:45] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[49:47] poor
[49:48] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[49:52] why is he saying these words because
[49:54] maybe during those 40 days he was going
[49:57] through those situations in his life
[50:00] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[50:03] he has sent me to preach deliverance to
[50:06] the captives
[50:08] and recovering of sight to the blind
[50:13] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[50:17] to preach the acceptable year of the
[50:20] lord
[50:21] and
[50:22] this is
[50:24] six things that he was sent to do and
[50:26] then where's the seven he was the seven
[50:29] i am the i am moses that's the i am this
[50:33] day this scripture is being fulfilled
[50:35] this day i am opening the book so that
[50:37] you can partake and you can see what's
[50:40] inside of the book
[50:43] amen
[50:45] and number seven is a number of
[50:47] completion
[50:48] number three is a number of perfection
[50:50] number four is a number of deliverance
[50:52] number five is a number of grace number
[50:54] six is a number of of men number seven
[50:57] is the number of completion number eight

[51:17] 50
[51:18] is the year of jubilee
[51:20] amen
[51:23] amen
[51:25] and he closed the book
[51:27] and he gave it again to the minister and
[51:29] he sat down
[51:31] after he dropped that bomb to satan
[51:35] after he opened the book
[51:37] after he revealed what was his mission
[51:39] there then he just sat down
[51:43] and the eyes of all of them that were in
[51:45] the synagogue they were
[51:47] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[51:51] them this day is this scripture
[51:54] fulfilled
[51:56] in your ears
[51:57] amen
[51:59] and amen
[52:00] i want to finish with
[52:02] this the ego
[52:05] does not fight the snake on the ground
[52:09] it picks it up into the sky
[52:11] and changes the battleground
[52:14] and then it releases the snake
[52:17] into the sky
[52:19] the snake has no stamina no power and no
[52:21] balance in the air
[52:23] it is useless
[52:25] weak
[52:26] and vulnerable unlike on the ground
[52:28] where it is powerful wise
[52:31] and deadly
[52:33] and i in this is what i learned
[52:36] take your fight
[52:38] into the spiritual real realm
[52:41] by praying and when you are in that
[52:44] spiritual realm god takes over your
[52:48] battles
[52:50] don't fight the enemy
[52:53] listen don't fight the enemy in his
[52:56] comfort zone
[52:59] that's why
[53:00] james said nobody said that he has been
[53:03] tempted by god because what we are
[53:06] tempted by our own lust
[53:10] because you are in the in the wrong
[53:11] battleground
[53:13] but why aren't you tempted when you're
[53:15] in church
[53:16] why aren't you tempted when you're
[53:18] reading your bible
[53:20] because you're in the right battleground
[53:23] don't fight the enemy in his comfort
[53:25] zone
[53:26] change the
[53:27] battleground like the ego and let god
[53:30] take charge through your earnest prayer
[53:34] and you'll be assured of a clean victory
[53:39] that's why the prophet of god says that
[53:41] even when the weakest of christians
[53:44] kneel down and pray the enemy is
[53:47] trembling the devil is shaking why
[53:50] because somebody is taking a step and
[53:52] saying i am possessing the gates of my
[53:54] enemies i am possessing the gate of my
[53:57] temptation not my temptation of his
[54:00] temptation that i am sending back
[54:04] this is not just an emotion but this is
[54:06] just an excitement to see what the word
[54:08] of god can do in our lives
[54:10] that you can live a victorious life
[54:12] every day
[54:14] you haven't been called to be defeated
[54:18] just take the enemy on the right
[54:20] battleground
[54:21] confess it to the lord and say lord i am
[54:24] coming to you tonight if there is
[54:26] something that needs to be forgiven lord
[54:28] forgive me
[54:29] lord i'm just bringing it to the right
[54:31] battleground and i'm just bringing
[54:32] taking all my burdens all my my trials
[54:36] or my temptations i'm just bringing them
[54:38] them bringing them to you tonight
[54:40] how many can say that tonight lord i
[54:43] bring my life to you i surrender all
[54:45] that i have if the musician saying come
[54:47] i'll surrender all my life all that i
[54:50] have
[54:51] all my desires lord
[54:53] if there is anything lord
[54:56] that i am not overcoming
[54:58] may i bring the enemy
[55:00] to the right battleground
[55:03] and as we read what's gonna happen
[55:06] you are assured a clean victory
[55:09] yes sir because that's his promise
[55:12] you have been given
[55:13] promises in the scriptures and in in the
[55:16] scripture says that his promises are in
[55:18] him they are yay and they are amen
[55:20] and what is amen is thus said the lord
[55:24] that's that's for us tonight
[55:26] this is not something that is coming in
[55:28] the future
[55:29] this is something that is in present
[55:31] tense the word of god will defeat the
[55:34] enemy and anytime anywhere in under any
[55:39] any circumstance
[55:41] and he was tempted in all
[55:44] areas of his life in all points yet
[55:47] without sin
[55:48] and now we're his children
[55:50] and now we can enjoy that promise of the
[55:53] hour
[55:54] amen izbar hits you want to stand up
[55:57] let's pray
[56:05] if you have something in your heart
[56:06] there build an altar
[56:08] in your where you're
[56:10] standing
[56:11] you say lord whatever it is
[56:14] you have given us promises lord you have
[56:16] you have given us your word
[56:18] that we can respond back to the enemy

[56:23] not my temptation devil it's not my lost
[56:26] the devil
