[4:23] [Music]
[4:24] [Applause]
[4:30] [Music]
[4:31] [Applause]

[5:59] mind and having compassion one of
[6:02] another love as Brethren be pitiful be
[6:06] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[6:10] railing for railing that's not how we
[6:12] respond is that they were evil to me so
[6:14] I'm going to respond with the same thing
[6:16] they deserve it but contrary wise
[6:19] blessing knowing that did he just say
[6:22] that we respond with the blessing to
[6:23] somebody being evil to us yes he did
[6:27] not many amens on that one but yes he
[6:29] did that's what he said that's how we
[6:31] respond contrary wise a blessing knowing
[6:34] that ye are there in two called so this
[6:36] is a calling as a Christian did you know
[6:38] as a Christian it's not just being a
[6:40] Christian that you're called to what the
[6:42] scripture says you're called to that
[6:43] this is a calling the rest of the world
[6:45] doesn't have a calling you have a
[6:46] calling you also have a calling to take
[6:49] this gospel into the whole world you
[6:51] have a calling to be a witness can you
[6:53] say Amen you don't live in your own
[6:54] little your own little world but we're
[6:56] called to be witnesses to everybody and
[6:59] so we're called to this type of Life of
[7:02] responding and blessing instead of evil
[7:04] for evil that ye should inherit a
[7:06] blessing verse 10 for he that will love
[7:09] life and see good days let him refrain
[7:12] his tongue from evil and his lips that
[7:14] they speak no guile let him issue evil
[7:19] and do good let him seek peace and ensue
[7:24] it and this series is called the bride's
[7:26] more excellent way because Paul
[7:28] introduced something greater than the
[7:29] gifts and all these other things
[7:31] something better a more excellent way
[7:34] and I'm preaching that more excellent
[7:36] Way To You Paul introduced it to the
[7:38] church back in First Corinthians 13 and
[7:40] so I'm going to hold up more of the
[7:43] attributes of the image of Christ First
[7:45] Corinthians 13 just to bring you into
[7:47] the channel that we've been speaking of
[7:49] First Corinthians 13 in your Bible to me
[7:51] is a window it's a window into the
[7:54] deepest place a Christian can enter
[7:56] First Corinthians 13 is the deepest
[7:59] place that a Christian can enter in
[8:01] their Christian wall it is deeper than
[8:04] all the other manifestations of the
[8:06] spirit and what it does it's deeper than
[8:09] all the other manifestations of the
[8:10] spirit in the church and what it does
[8:12] what he presents is the more excellent
[8:14] way is beyond faith how many believe
[8:17] that we preach Faith how many believe
[8:19] that just stay back at the other screen
[8:21] we preach faith and we believe in faith
[8:24] how many believe that you can have faith
[8:25] to move mountains how many believe God
[8:27] can raise the Dead
[8:29] how many believe there's enough faith in
[8:31] this word that come that the blind eyes
[8:32] can be open cancer can be healed God is
[8:35] nothing impossible with God and we need
[8:37] perfect faith we need Faith to do that
[8:39] so we're not dumping out Faith how many
[8:42] believe that's important for us to read
[8:43] our Bible and to get knowledge of the
[8:45] word of course it is how many believe
[8:46] it's important important just to have
[8:48] knowledge read the word but to ask God
[8:50] to give you Revelation the word because
[8:52] reading is is one thing but Revelation
[8:54] is another of the word Jesus talked
[8:56] about Revelation the disciples asked him
[8:58] why do you speak in Parables why do you
[9:01] speak in Parables why don't you just
[9:03] come out plainly he said because it's
[9:06] given to you disciples to know the
[9:08] Mysteries Behind The Parables but it's
[9:09] not given to some and so I speak in
[9:12] Parables to draw the attention but if
[9:14] we'll ask God he'll give you the meaning
[9:16] for the parable and you'll understand
[9:17] the word can you say Amen so we believe
[9:20] in knowledge we believe in reading our
[9:21] Bibles we should do that we believe in
[9:24] faith but what Paul introduces here is
[9:27] deeper than the manifestations of the
[9:30] spirit deeper than the gifts it's beyond
[9:32] faith it's beyond knowledge it's beyond
[9:35] good works
[9:38] this is something for a Christian Beyond
[9:40] good works and how many believe we
[9:42] should do good works of course we should
[9:44] that's part of our Christian Journey as
[9:46] well we should do good things we should
[9:48] give to the poor but when he says though
[9:50] I give my body to be burned and give all
[9:52] my goods to feed the poor and have not
[9:54] charity I am nothing this more excellent
[9:56] way has to be our pursuit or all the
[9:59] good works that we do mean nothing
[10:02] so we can't pursue those things and a
[10:04] lot of those things sometimes feel
[10:06] better is to give to the poor you feel
[10:08] good about yourself it feels good when
[10:10] you're Anointed with some type of gift
[10:12] to the spirit you know all it's it's
[10:13] some it's it's it feels good but yeah
[10:16] listen Paul says you can have all that
[10:17] and not have Divine love
[10:19] and sometimes when you preach on Divine
[10:21] love what I'm going to do today it
[10:23] doesn't feel very good let me just warn
[10:25] you when I get into the traits today
[10:27] it's not going to feel very good because
[10:29] most of us most of us are going to leave
[10:30] the service today saying Lord I I need
[10:33] help
[10:35] can you say man I need help
[10:38] but nevertheless it feels better to give
[10:41] to the poor it feels good when you rise
[10:43] to a faith and pray for somebody lay
[10:44] hands and they're healed of cancer that
[10:46] feels better and God will continue to do
[10:48] those things but we if we ignore in our
[10:51] Christian walk this more excellent way
[10:53] we are a troubling person because we're
[10:55] ignoring the most excellent way and the
[10:57] the better thing for the Christian to
[10:59] pursue
[11:00] and so it's beyond faith it's beyond
[11:03] knowledge it's beyond good works it's
[11:05] beyond of what true Christianity has
[11:08] always produced for 2000 years it's this
[11:11] this love is greater than hope it's
[11:15] greater than Faith Can you say Amen let
[11:17] me ask you this this morning if we are
[11:19] in the end time and if we are on the
[11:21] finishing the Capstone of God's work in
[11:25] a people for two thousand years
[11:26] Christianity started 2 000 years ago and
[11:29] so now God has been in this work to take
[11:32] out a people for his namesake to take
[11:34] out a people to to bring them to a a
[11:37] culmination to a Capstone if we are in
[11:40] that finishing Capstone work on God's
[11:43] people then shouldn't we be entering
[11:45] into the best expression of who he is at
[11:49] these Final hours I'm asking
[11:51] shouldn't this be the time
[11:53] that we enter the final Capstone and the
[11:56] final expression of who Jesus is in a
[12:00] people
[12:01] and if Paul opened to us the more
[12:03] excellent way shouldn't this be our
[12:05] desperation more than any other thing
[12:08] that this be our expression as a
[12:11] Christian that this be if Paul opened it
[12:13] up to us shouldn't this be our
[12:16] desperation more than anything
[12:19] I think it's a good question
[12:21] shouldn't this be our Pursuit more than
[12:23] possessions
[12:26] more than careers
[12:29] more than School
[12:31] more than education
[12:33] don't dump any of that out but there's a
[12:36] Pursuit more than more than that
[12:39] that fishing boat that your brothers
[12:41] want
[12:45] more than that new
[12:47] address that new outfit your sisters
[12:49] want and you're you're given hints to
[12:51] your husband the next few weeks
[12:54] more than any other Pursuit
[12:58] this as a Christian should be Lord I got
[13:01] this lane from me God this is the final
[13:04] age is the final time God let the people
[13:07] see this Divine love in my life but you
[13:10] see that's the pursuit it is the more
[13:12] excellent way that a Christian will live
[13:13] We tend to fall back on our known our
[13:16] ways that are known to us of gifts in
[13:19] the church and knowledge in the church
[13:21] and good works we tend to fall back on
[13:22] that but this is a whole other thing
[13:24] altogether and it's also I've been
[13:27] preaching to you that this Divine love
[13:30] is not just a giving to the poor this
[13:32] Divine love is not a human effort it
[13:35] doesn't originate in us as humans it
[13:38] doesn't originate in our minds this
[13:41] don't try to mechanically put this on
[13:43] this morning this Divine love only comes
[13:45] through one source and that's the Holy
[13:48] Ghost himself living in the soul
[13:50] there's a lot of groups of people a lot
[13:52] of churches let me just say it this way
[13:55] and I think I said this when I started
[13:57] the church in Toledo 30 33 34 years ago
[14:01] I kept saying this because I was looking
[14:03] up in the phone book and I I was saying
[14:06] there's like seven or eight pages of
[14:08] churches well on one side you could say
[14:10] praise the Lord you know there's
[14:12] Christian churches that are preaching
[14:15] but then I thought as the Lord began to
[14:18] show me that that God wants something
[14:21] more than just more churches
[14:24] God's not looking for another church to
[14:26] start
[14:27] he's looking for a bride
[14:32] and then I was wondering where the
[14:33] statement holy Toledo came from
[14:37] holy toledo
[14:39] and I found out I researched and I found
[14:42] out that Toledo had more churches per
[14:45] capita than any other city I don't know
[14:47] if it's the same but at that time 30
[14:49] years 30 years ago Toledo had more
[14:51] churches per capita than any other city
[14:53] in the United States and that's where
[14:55] the term came from holy toledo
[14:57] but I've lived here for 33 years and
[15:00] Toledo is not holy
[15:03] it's not holy there's there's a lot of
[15:06] Unholy things that happen every night
[15:09] every day
[15:11] and so you can't so how you have to be
[15:15] honest and say if you have more churches
[15:17] doesn't guarantee you have more holy
[15:19] people
[15:21] if you have more churches that are using
[15:23] the Bible even praise the Lord we thank
[15:25] God for that but we have to have a
[15:26] result that God is calling a people for
[15:29] his namesake he's not calling another
[15:31] church he's not calling people to
[15:34] religion but he's calling a bride to
[15:37] Mary in this last days how many want to
[15:39] be a part of that bride finally all of
[15:41] you be like-minded United in spirit
[15:43] sympathetic brotherly kind-hearted
[15:46] courteous and compassionate towards each
[15:49] other as members of one household he say
[15:52] no there's a lot of households here no
[15:54] really you got your household but you're
[15:56] when you become a member of the body of
[15:58] Christ you're a member of One household
[15:59] the body of Christ
[16:01] so now that's why we treat each other
[16:04] because this is brothers and sisters
[16:05] this isn't just some uh Alien that's
[16:08] sitting next to you here this morning
[16:09] maybe you might treat him like an alien
[16:11] I don't need that person I don't need to
[16:13] shake their hand I don't it makes me
[16:14] uncomfortable shaking hands I just want
[16:16] to come if you want to come for a while
[16:18] and you don't want to just talk to
[16:20] anybody then you you should come and sit
[16:22] on the front seat
[16:25] and then you'll be undistracted by
[16:27] people and you just look at me
[16:31] you're welcome to do that now you don't
[16:32] have to sit in the front seat you say
[16:33] whatever you want but listen now people
[16:35] kind of get this way but you you if
[16:37] you're born into by a new birth into
[16:40] Christ you're born into a household
[16:42] you're born into a body
[16:44] so just like at home when you got a
[16:46] household with all different brothers
[16:48] and sisters and kids uh young or old and
[16:52] it doesn't matter you're a household so
[16:54] now we see every day what it takes to
[16:57] make a household rung and I'll tell you
[16:59] you're not going to have a good
[17:00] household without without courteous
[17:02] compassionate
[17:05] forgiving kind-hearted brotherly if you
[17:08] if you violate those things what kind of
[17:11] home are you going to have
[17:12] so if it works in a you know it has to
[17:15] ask you have to have certain boundaries
[17:17] of respect you have to have certain
[17:19] things you have to love one another when
[17:21] somebody is unlovable you have to repent
[17:23] you have to talk it out if you want a
[17:25] functioning household well that works
[17:27] the same in the household because he
[17:29] says be sympathetic be brotherly
[17:31] kind-hearted courteous and compassionate
[17:33] towards each other as members of one
[17:35] household and humble in spirit and never
[17:38] return evil for evil or an insult for an
[17:41] insult
[17:43] avoiding scolding avoiding scolding
[17:47] berating and any kind of abuse it's
[17:51] interesting that abuse any kind of abuse
[17:53] but it's interesting abuse is used with
[17:56] something you're saying it's your words
[17:58] it's when you're scolding you're using
[18:01] your tongue your words when you're
[18:02] berating you're using your tongue your
[18:04] words can you say Amen so those when he
[18:07] says the abuse today abuse abuse is not
[18:11] just physical abuse there are many forms
[18:14] of abuse and verbal abuse is one of them
[18:16] so in our words we got to bring our
[18:19] tongue under subjection to those that
[18:21] we're supposed to be honoring
[18:25] and it has to express itself in being
[18:27] courteous and compassionate even when we
[18:30] disagree now some of you might have
[18:32] households where you you you agree on
[18:35] everything
[18:38] and everybody's laughing
[18:40] you know if you do meet me in the office
[18:44] because I'd like to ask some questions
[18:45] what you're doing right
[18:48] all right but listen so we don't agree
[18:51] on everything but when we disagree you
[18:53] don't have any right as a Christian to
[18:56] go the direction of abuse verbally just
[18:58] because you disagree and just because
[19:00] somebody's not doing what you want to do
[19:02] want them to do can you say Amen so so
[19:05] berating any kind of abuse I'd like to
[19:07] talk more on that because we have way
[19:09] too much abuse going on today even
[19:11] sometimes in Christian homes and because
[19:13] because people don't know what abuse is
[19:15] they don't know what they're doing
[19:16] they've developed habits over time
[19:18] habits in their home that they come from
[19:20] and they just do it because they think
[19:22] it's normal and it just passes on from
[19:24] generation to generation what your
[19:26] household was normal this is the way we
[19:28] did it so you just start abusing you
[19:29] start lashing out whatever comes from
[19:32] your past home and but as a Christian
[19:34] God stand still and say now wait a
[19:36] minute I'm the one by the grace of God
[19:37] would like to break the cycle of homes
[19:40] being in such a disarray giving it a
[19:42] normal status that it's normal to just
[19:44] scold somebody and walk away and never
[19:47] repent of it I need to know Lord help me
[19:49] because you're presenting to me a what a
[19:52] Christian home is and a Christian Body
[19:54] of Christ this is the way we should
[19:56] function if you want to leave today and
[19:58] ignore just this scripture and say
[20:00] nobody can live like that you go right
[20:02] ahead but for a Believer he's saying
[20:04] Lord I don't have all that yet but it's
[20:06] your word and the word does not come in
[20:09] just word only but power and
[20:11] demonstration and I want to see the Holy
[20:14] Ghost bring a demonstration of this word
[20:17] in my life
[20:18] avoid scolding berating in any kind of
[20:21] abuse but on Con on the contrary give a
[20:25] blessing pray for one another's
[20:26] well-being contentment and protection
[20:30] for you have been called for this very
[20:34] purpose this isn't just an instruction
[20:36] that you intellectually okay I'm going
[20:38] to go home and do this this is a calling
[20:42] you've been called by God to this
[20:45] you ever hear of somebody running from a
[20:47] calling
[20:48] a minister can run from years from a
[20:51] calling and he feels this
[20:52] urgency in the inside something's there
[20:53] I don't know what it is and and but they
[20:56] can run from a calling and usually the
[20:58] one that's running has the calling
[21:01] and you're never going to get away from
[21:02] it if God's called you you can fight for
[21:05] 10 20 years but if it's a calling he's
[21:07] called you to you're going to have to
[21:08] address that someday and unbelievers
[21:11] don't care about this but Believers you
[21:13] have a calling to live this way and to
[21:15] treat people this way and from the
[21:17] pastor down to the Pew from the pastor
[21:20] to the janitor whoever it is this is our
[21:22] calling
[21:26] for you have been called for this very
[21:28] purpose that you might inherit a
[21:30] blessing from God that brings well-being
[21:34] happiness and protection so love one of
[21:39] them today is love is not rude and the
[21:42] second one is love is not self-seeking
[21:44] this is in First Corinthians love is
[21:47] never rude Love Is Never self-seeking
[21:51] because it's not about you
[21:53] right lane
[21:55] it's not about you it's about Christ
[21:59] so
[22:01] love is not rude and love is not
[22:03] self-seeking both of these are complete
[22:05] opposite both of these tied together
[22:08] because they're the complete opposite of
[22:10] a self-centered person
[22:12] God's love is never selfish and never
[22:15] self-centered
[22:18] can I say it again
[22:20] you'll never find in the true genuine
[22:22] love of God
[22:23] self-centeredness or selfishness you
[22:27] can't find it in the love of God
[22:30] so if you still have some of that then
[22:32] it's not coming from the the Divine love
[22:35] that's in the Holy Ghost it's not coming
[22:37] from that it's coming from something
[22:38] else
[22:40] and it's hard to move into a life of
[22:42] divine love when you have
[22:43] self-centeredness or selfishness so now
[22:46] we're going to go into the first one
[22:47] which is love is not rude so First
[22:50] Corinthians 13 5 says does not behave
[22:52] itself unseemly that's the way it's
[22:54] worded in First Corinthians but it means
[22:55] love is not misbehaving love is not
[22:58] behaving it's about behavior when you're
[23:01] acting rude to somebody you're you're
[23:03] treating that person bad you're more
[23:05] about yourself than their feelings and
[23:07] it's about Behavior does not behave
[23:10] itself unseemly which means it doesn't
[23:12] love does not behave itself
[23:15] dishonorably or improperly
[23:19] Divine love of God is not rude to
[23:22] someone else Divine love of God is not
[23:24] rude to someone else it is not
[23:26] dishonorable it doesn't dishonor it's
[23:29] not behaving improperly and I'll add
[23:32] Titus 3 2 in the ESV to speak evil of no
[23:36] one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and
[23:41] to show perfect courtesy toward all
[23:45] people
[23:46] and so now love does love does not
[23:50] needlessly offend love has good manners
[23:54] love is courteous it is polite it is
[23:58] sensitive to the feelings of others and
[24:01] always uses tact
[24:06] the reason we are not courteous of
[24:08] course is that we are thinking only of
[24:10] ourselves and not of others not honoring
[24:12] the other person and so now this is
[24:15] bringing us into saying Lord help us
[24:17] this morning because every person has a
[24:19] right of my honor as we preached a few
[24:22] months ago every person I owe the love
[24:24] of God to every person I owe it I'm in
[24:26] debt to every person that's what the
[24:28] Bible says you owe somebody say well
[24:30] they I they don't owe me nothing and I
[24:32] don't owe them nothing you can't say
[24:33] that as a Christian
[24:36] you stay over there I stay over here I
[24:39] don't owe you anything it's not true if
[24:40] you have the love of God you owe them
[24:42] you're in death you owe everybody the
[24:44] love of God
[24:45] you're in debt to them because God gave
[24:47] it to you and it's not just for yourself
[24:49] can you imagine now I've got the love of
[24:51] God for myself but it becomes selfish
[24:53] with the love of God
[24:55] there's no selfishness in the love of
[24:57] God
[24:59] there is no holding back in the love of
[25:01] God so then this description of Love In
[25:04] First Corinthians 13 includes a list of
[25:06] what love is not and love is not rude we
[25:10] read that love is not rude in verse 5
[25:12] love then has good manners the Greek
[25:15] phrase could literally be translated
[25:18] does not act unbecomingly that's why it
[25:21] says does not behave itself unseemly
[25:23] because in the Greek it says love does
[25:25] not act unbecomingly or does not act
[25:28] inappropriately notice it's not what
[25:30] you're thinking it's how you're acting
[25:32] this isn't about what you're thinking
[25:34] because you could say do you love them
[25:36] and you say your mind saying yeah I love
[25:38] them it's not how you think
[25:40] it's not your words
[25:43] but it's your behavior and your words
[25:44] that are expressed to say whether you
[25:46] love them or not love has honor love has
[25:48] respect love has a tolerance not for
[25:52] something off the word but it has a
[25:54] tolerance for that person's growth may
[25:57] God help us may God help me to have a
[25:59] tolerance for persons growth in the Lord
[26:01] and where they're at our attitude has to
[26:03] show something in our behavior that love
[26:06] cannot ever be rude to someone no matter
[26:09] what state they're in and no matter how
[26:11] rude they're treating you
[26:16] the Greek phrases does not act
[26:18] Unbecoming it doesn't act
[26:20] inappropriately Christian love does not
[26:22] seek to cause problems or it does not
[26:24] belittle others Christian love involves
[26:26] choosing appropriate actions and
[26:29] responses that help other people
[26:32] rudeness is finding more and more
[26:34] Acceptance in today's culture I'm
[26:36] reading from a writer now a few things
[26:38] on rudeness and I agree with this
[26:40] completely rudeness is finding more and
[26:42] more Acceptance in today's culture
[26:44] things have changed in the last 10 20
[26:46] years in rudeness people are becoming
[26:49] more rude
[26:51] stay at a light too long texting and you
[26:55] find out how rude we get
[26:58] rudeness is more and more accepted today
[27:01] and become normal but it's not normal in
[27:04] God's Kingdom
[27:06] love is not rude and love is not
[27:08] self-seeking seeketh not her own
[27:13] Philippians 2 3 that's how it's word in
[27:15] the Bible seeketh not her own love is
[27:18] not self-seeking Philippians 2 3 and
[27:20] they have I do nothing do nothing
[27:23] from selfishness or empty conceit
[27:25] through factional motives or Strife but
[27:29] with an attitude of humility being
[27:32] neither arrogant nor self-righteous
[27:35] regard others as more important than
[27:39] yourselves can you say Amen
[27:42] it is not it is not selfish does not
[27:46] demand its rights one writer says the
[27:49] secret of every Discord in Christian
[27:51] homes communities and churches is that
[27:53] we seek our own way excuse me the secret
[27:56] to every Discord in Christian homes
[27:58] communities and churches is that we seek
[27:59] our own way and our own Glory rch
