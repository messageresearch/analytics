at verse 24 for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all of your filthiness and from all of your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and ye shall keep my judgments and do them ye shall dwell in the land that I gave your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God I will also save you from all your uncleanness and I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and I will multiply the fruit of the tree I don't know if any of you are sitting there saying this is for me this morning but you ought to take this promise for you individually say whatever he said he's going to do and I receive it I will multiply the fruit of the tree and increase the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the Heathen then shall you remember your own evil ways and doings that were not good and shall loath yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities for you and for your Abominations not for your sakes do I this sayith the Lord God be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways oh House of Israel thus sayith the Lord God in the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the waste shall be builded and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight uh of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the Garden of Eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced are inhabited did anybody catch after he does all of this to Israel then it doesn't stop he said I'll restore you back back to what it was at Eden again I'll restore it completely back to Eden again I'll tell you you're under a restoration that doesn't go halfway this is significant today cuz it doesn't look like Israel is heading in a good place there physically but this is God's promise right here and someday the desolate place will come back like a Garden of Eden again for God's people apply this to yourself and we say thank God that you're doing this work in my life speak we left off with the first reference to the holy ghost in the Old Testament the first main reference and that was in Isaiah 28 where it says for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there's no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall you make to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken so the text says when this Holy Ghost comes there'll be many resist it and resist the Holy Ghost but thank God there will be some to receive it so the conclusion of Isaiah 28 just to summarize is that in these scriptures we find that what is tied to the Holy Ghost is it is the fresh food coming it's not it's a fresh word of the hour that he sends the Holy Ghost to make real and so if it's old food vomit he says your tables are full of vomit that's all regurgitated food so when God sends the Holy Ghost it's to identify himself with the word for that hour and it is a fresh word that comes it is the word for the hour so when we're looking at the evidences of the Holy Ghost and wanting to know what it is it's tied to the word of God it's evidence is tied to the word cuz it keeps saying line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little it's tied to the word being line upon line not outside of the not the outside manifestation of stammering lips that will be the outside manifestation but the inside is it's tied to the word the people will come for the word of that day the Holy Ghost will fill them to make that word live that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and then it says it's the rest how many believe the Holy Ghost is a rest it's the refreshing can you say Amen if it's a rest then it's it's not something that's complicated if it's a rest he don't send the Holy Ghost to make your life more confused Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I'll give you rest he's talking about the Holy Ghost so when he comes he doesn't make a struggle over works and I got to gain my entrance into heaven no the Holy Ghost when it comes into your life is to bring rest it is the refreshing it is the rest that comes to your life and the biggest rest is in your soul that I don't have to work my way into heaven that he comes changes your nature can you say amen and I'm at peace with God going in a Rapture that's a rest Jesus God when he when he spoke from the beginning he had to rest in his own word after six days of creating then he went into a Sabbath and you know what he was resting on the word that he already spoke right God has already spoke his word and the Holy Ghost as you enter into rest that he's already spoken and it'll be done that's what the scripture is saying and then the last thing some would reject the line upon line for word for their day and this fits with step's rebuke just before he was stoned by the Jews he looks up and he says these words which is pretty Stern and we might get get back into this in a subject of the Holy Ghost ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did he's speaking to religious leaders you're resisting the word for your hour you're resisting the Holy Ghost as your fathers did and the the opposite then of resisting is what the opposite of resisting the Holy Ghost is believing it's just that simple God needs a believing heart God needs you to believe God needs you to trust all the stuff that he wants to do to you here in Ezekiel and change your life it it comes by his person that begins to believe not up but really believe it I believe it and you start saying Lord I believe this I don't see it yet in my life but I believe it now we move to the next place in the Old Testament that emphasizes the Holy Ghost and that's in Ezekiel 36 the scriptures that I read to you and of course the scriptures is Naturally Speaking of Israel's restoration as a nation what he will do in the last days for his people what he does to Israel as a nation he does to you as an individual he worked as an individual to the Gentiles and he works as a nation to Israel true true so whatever he does in Prophecy to Israel as a nation he's doing to you as an individual always forget that always we always forget the fact that we that we are somehow uh looking at this like a group effort I'm in the message I'm I go to the message meetings I'm this that and the other but we should never look at this I want to see more Unity If the message churches I want to see more unity in the bride and when I think of the Bride I don't just think of certain churches under a certain label that's not how he deals with the Gentiles oh if they could all just come I'm not so sure every technical church is going to come in Oneness and unity but the bride will individuals will I don't even know if everyone in our own assembly I'd like everybody to but would come into the Oneness like Pentecost again I don't know if you will because this is not a church effort this is an individual effort and he will have a bride from every Nation from all the churches can you say amen I don't know who his bride is but she will come into unity and she will be in a Rapture so be careful that you w always you're just looking for everybody and all the preachers to agree and all this I think that's not what God looks at it he deals with Israel as a nation he deals with you as an individual that's why he could say if you want your church to have a Revival don't wait around for everybody else let the Revival start in you that's right and it'll break out other places so what God does to Israel as a nation he does to the individual and the end result to Ezekiel 36 is that I the end result is in verse uh it would be 27 I will put my spirit within you that's what he wants to do now don't let that become common to you please that is that is a huge thing that God in our sin in our Humanity in our Brokenness in our flub UPS if in in our nature that we're born with because everybody knows from what I've been preaching you were born with the wrong nature in you but with all of our baggage with everything that we got God said I'm going to take that all that baggage I'm going to take you on and I'm going to click you I'm going to take you from the Heathen I'm going to I'm going to cleanse you with sprinkle you with water and then I've got to change your Stony heart and then I've got to do this is what I want to talk about today and all of it there's you have nothing to do with it I'm taking you on as my masterpiece Lord and my end result is to prepare a place a tabernacle In Your Vessel that I would actually put my spirit within you this is the Holy Ghost amall I say praise the Lord so we've already learned in this that we are his workmanship so we see here how he leads and does the work from the beginning he does it all I mentioned nine times in these verses he mentions the word I I will bring you from the other countries I will give you a new spirit I will change your Stony heart I will change your spirit I is mentioned nine times and you're not in there there except what God's doing to you you didn't go to any seminars to make yourself better you didn't put any bandaids on it you don't own there some Theologian God said I'm I'm it's a personal pronoun I love you so much I'll take you as you are but I won't leave you as you are and God can take the worst sinner give me your worst cases God says I will take you on and I will love you out of your mess and then when I'm done I will actually put my spirit within you somebody ought to sh shout and say praise the Lord you better not take that for granted that you're just a church M cuz I preach to some church MERS I preach to the body of Christ I preach to church members but God wants to make you more than a church member more than ones that just comes and raises your hand God says I want to put my spirit within you we are his workmanship so he says I'll do it it's not your works from start to finish it's him if you will believe and receive put yourself for your in other words the only thing that you can do is put yourself in an obedience to him say Okay Lord I'm going to climb up on the potter's wheel because you're the Potter it's quiet here but I want to ask every person in this room I don't care if you're a visitor or you've been with me 305 years how willing are you to bring yourself and put yourself up on the Potter's will and don't leave you stay there for the rest of your life how many would trust God and say I'm ready to put myself on The Potter's will you mold me you cuz when when that Potter he's got all that stuff and you see that big lump of clay there and he just starts to work his hands on your life and get off all CU he sees the image of what you'll be you don't but he sees it and he just keeps working and keeps working and tearing things off your life tearing that smoking drinking and gambling and gaming bad gaming and and and pornography and all that and you just you just you just all you did was get up on the Potter's will I'm not perfect today except for the blood of Jesus Christ but I've kept my life on the Potter's will God comes and does the work he doesn't make us go against the will but he makes us willing to go that's what I see here in Ezekiel 36 and don't put yourself in your own time frames of when God's going to do this that's where we get in trouble I I do see a process here of God working on us to get us ready to receive his spirit I believe it's a growth I believe it's a process but nobody knows the time fras frames and the process for you and the process for me and if you put your own time frames on it say okay I need to reach this I've had Minister say okay I have how can I come up to the pyramid okay so I've got faith I need virtue now I need knowledge Temperance patience I got this and and and so they're trying to work it all out and brother BR says God births everything every one of those things he births into you so he's still doing it so I could okay got virtue now on to the next one Lord we don't know what he's doing we just submit ourselves we know when we got more patience you like wow something's happened to me cuz I would have bit that guy's head off before Something's Happened to me the love of God has taken over am so we don't put time frames because it I just say in his it's in his time in his season we just submit ourselves to God can you say amen and I do believe we offer a desperation to God that was the message after the token the Holy Ghost is desperation because God likes to see a desperation God let me just say it this way to be simple this morning how can you receive his Spirit the holy ghost in your life if you haven't even asked for it he likes to hear you ask he likes to really want it oh Lord he just give it to me whenever he feels I'm not preaching that this morning I'm looking for a desperation to say God I'm asking for this thing of your spirit I need it now more than ever the time is short and I'm not doing it just to to evade hell I'm doing because I need this in my life there's too many demon powers trying to lead me into pornography and into the things of the world and lust and all these other things I need your spirit living in me asking you shall receive knocking it shall be open to you he likes us to be desperate and the asking but we don't do the work and let me say you something about your time frames okay that you put on God and try to diagnose where you're at and diagnose where the rest of the people are we're so good at diagnosing where people are in their Christian walk can I get an amen we're professionals we're we're Fruit inspectors we're going to examine the fruit in everybody else but they're not too good at it as far as ourselves but we do it in everybody else and then we think no we know where we're at and I you know one fell sometime in the office says we're in a really good place right now yeah we're we're in a good place we're in a good place and and I'm seeing otherwise I'm trying to share with them as a pastor now there's something you know there's some things you need to take to the Cross I'm encouraging you there's a pastor some things you you you need to talk about with your family and such but to him hey everything was everything's hunky dory but you see now oh you can only pray because it's in God's timing God would Open the Eyes of every one of us to see where we're at but God has his own timing and let me say this God can do more in one moment that's right you say all this process he can do it he can do it just like that right right we know that that new birth just like sin happened in a moment and we all of sons after the first Adam we were born in sin by a Moment of going against the word of God now all of a sudden in a moment all of humanity fell under Adam and Eve we didn't even do that we inherited it in a moment that happened well if it can happen in sin in a moment in a moment God can change a life when you open your heart a moment he can do a lot of things because he's doing it so in a moment he could do more than you could ever do polishing yourself up for years don't put time frames of God just say my life is in his hands if you don't put it in his hands you can slow up God's work how many knows if you don't put your life in God's hand you'll slow up his work in ezel Ezekiel 36 I think you can slow down this process go God wants to do it but if you don't put your life completely in his hands you slow up the process but I remind you of a promise all the father have given me will come that's what I preached the first time in the in the uh series on the Holy Ghost all the father given and I always say this those have been me with with me for years if you're a son or daughter of God you're either going to come hard or you're going to come easy but God's God's not going to let you go when I read Ezekiel 36 again last night I thought Lord I'll just say it to you guys you're a piece of work now I look that up and that can have an A positive connotation but today it has a negative because when somebody's mad he say you're a real piece of work and Ezekiel 36 36 must say to us all of us he's got to pull you from the me he's got to give you you got a Stony heart you got a spirit that won't get along with anybody or God you got a a a a will that says I'm going to do my own will and not God's you got all of that you are a piece of work yeah and then God says but I'm taking this piece of work amen and I'm going to do something with it that's right you're a lot of work but when he moves into your life he can take the worst cases blessed be the name of the Lord he can take the worst cases bring me your worst case hallu well I'm not a worst case but I'm here to tell you you're still a piece of work you got things friends I could take the next hour start with myself and start to go through when you come you come with a mind that's been against God you come with a bitterness you come with people hurting you you've got baggage Galore right true you come with a lack of trust trust you come I minister to people the Holy Spirit ministers through me to a lot of people that come from hurtful situations Hallelujah and I hear their past erupt when they get angry about something or when I would preacher when something would happen similar to their past this volcano erupts and they spill out this thing and they're they're not healed from it yet right yeah I'm glad God's put me in this place to minister to people who need healing by the Holy Ghost cuz you're all a piece of work and I am too so God is determined to take the worst cases God's determined to live in you it's not a problem for God you see you're not determined when you come in he's determined thankfully somebody's determined here because when you first come to him you're not that determined you're not determined to receive a spirit you're not determined to change but God was determined for your life you went way out somewhere you went you said I'm leaving this thing I'm leaving this truth but guess what and when you weren't determined when you weren't determined even to come back God was determined for you God had a determination for your life hallelujah hallelujah and so we see then you see it's what we can it's not what we can do but it's what we believe when we submit to him to let him have his way to get desperate for ourselves to get desperate for God I want this this Holy Ghost living in me say it to him this morning I want this Holy Ghost living in me I want to be filled with this Holy Ghost you see do you know this work is a sec this work of the Holy Spirit moving into our lives because I want to talk about when the holy spirit moves into your life just like he moves to bring a message he moved in the days of Christ for his birth and he began to move he gave Joseph A Dream the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was doing a lot of things but it was the Holy Ghost moving because he's getting ready to bring the Messiah and do something great so the when the the Holy Ghost begins to move into your life eventually eventually great things begin to happen but when he begins to move it's so similar do you know that when the Holy Ghost moves in your life we find it in the second verse of your Bible what I'm preaching and teaching on a series on the Holy Ghost is in the second verse of your Bible that says you should know it because you learned it in Sunday School in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void empty and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of those Waters Glory he already did it for this Earth that's the condition it was in that's the condition you were in but I was raised in the message Darkness was Upon a face of your deep Darkness was on the face of your deep your soul Darkness covers it and you you you would have stayed that way but guess what happened the Holy Ghost moved in might have happened 10 years ago might be happening this morning but when he begins to move upon the face of the waters what begin to happen he took chaos are you listening he took darkness when he moved on it he took chaos and he made it in Eden so if he did that to the Earth why would he just do it to the Earth you're his people so if he moved upon the face of the water and he began to do something for for the earth to make an Eden to take a chaos to take a piece of work like you and turn it into an Eden a fruitful place where God can speak through you and God can use you and you can be cleansed and and all these other things if God did that to the Earth then he can make an Eden in your life as well by what the holy ghost moving upon your life thank you for watching
