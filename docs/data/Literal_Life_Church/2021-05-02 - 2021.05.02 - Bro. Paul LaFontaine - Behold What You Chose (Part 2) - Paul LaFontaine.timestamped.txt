[0:00] lord and we believe the lord is
[0:02] with us in guiding us and giving us
[0:04] leadership
[0:06] uh one of the last services full
[0:08] services actually the last full service
[0:11] that brother branham preached was
[0:12] leadership i think it's very significant
[0:14] that that's the last thing he said
[0:16] because if we live here just another as
[0:19] we're living here another 40 50 60 years
[0:22] which we didn't expect
[0:24] the one thing that we need more than
[0:25] ever is holy ghost leadership
[0:28] we need it every day can you say man
[0:31] and uh if you turn with me to first
[0:32] samuel we're going to continue to talk
[0:34] about leadership a little bit
[0:36] again
[0:37] and i'd like to continue on a little bit
[0:39] in talking about saul today and the
[0:42] people's choice for leadership in their
[0:43] lives
[0:44] we're going to turn to first samuel
[0:46] chapter 12
[0:47] and
[0:48] we'll just read from a couple verses
[0:50] there
[0:51] and you might want to keep your bibles
[0:53] handy we're going to
[0:55] just refer to several scriptures if you
[0:57] didn't want to do that i'm sure they'll
[0:59] be able to put it up if they keep up
[1:01] with me upstairs there and
[1:03] put the scriptures up so you can read
[1:05] them on the screen first samuel chapter
[1:07] 12 and we read this a couple weeks ago
[1:10] because just talking about god telling
[1:13] the people to behold the king they've
[1:14] chosen verse 12 says and when you saw
[1:17] that nahash the king of the children of
[1:19] ammon came against you
[1:21] you said unto me nay but a king shall
[1:24] reign over us when the lord your god was
[1:26] your kin the lord your god was your king
[1:29] now therefore behold the king whom ye
[1:31] have chosen
[1:32] behold the king you have chosen and whom
[1:34] ye have desired and behold the lord hath
[1:38] set a king over you so we're taking that
[1:41] now the the prophet saying here's your
[1:43] king you've chosen behold the king whom
[1:46] you have chosen
[1:47] and whom ye have desired so this was
[1:49] their desire to have a king like this
[1:52] that resembled the other nations this is
[1:55] all their desire this is all their
[1:57] choosing
[1:58] and god told them that
[2:00] therefore behold
[2:02] the king whom you have chosen and the
[2:05] one that you have desired
[2:07] let's pray heavenly father we pray that
[2:09] you help us lord to stand
[2:12] firm upon the word of god today
[2:14] heavens and earth will pass away but
[2:16] your word is eternal lord god it is the
[2:20] stability it is the strength
[2:22] it is the lord the the the stronghold
[2:25] against the enemy
[2:27] and father i pray that you'll use your
[2:29] word as it's thus saith the lord spoken
[2:32] by the prophets lord it is thus saith
[2:34] the lord and thus it has the power in it
[2:37] to be able to transform to be able to
[2:39] change
[2:40] to be able to stabilize families to be
[2:42] able to bring the holy ghost and bring
[2:44] salvation whatever we need is in the
[2:47] word of god so i trust every age group
[2:50] here this morning would give attention
[2:52] to it
[2:53] in our busy lives that we have lord we
[2:56] we don't give enough attention all of us
[2:58] lord would say we don't give enough
[3:00] attention to the word of god so when we
[3:03] have these moments we want to seize the
[3:05] opportunity lord and just sit quietly at
[3:07] your feet and hear what you want to tell
[3:10] us this morning bless every heart we
[3:12] thank you for healing our brother lord
[3:14] and to for his report that's come back
[3:16] clean we thank you for answering prayer
[3:18] lord and all the other things that
[3:20] you're doing answering prayer left and
[3:22] right just so many things we don't want
[3:24] to overlook it but we want to lord give
[3:25] the devil a black eye and show him that
[3:28] the power of god is working in the
[3:29] people of god the faith of god is
[3:32] working in the people and lord we can go
[3:34] to your atonement and trust in your
[3:36] blood and your healing through calvary
[3:38] we're thankful for it lord and we just
[3:41] pray you'll give us boldness and the
[3:42] spirit of god today to minister your
[3:44] word and we ask it in jesus name amen
[3:47] god bless you each one as you're seated
[3:49] this morning
[3:51] now
[3:52] we want to speak this is part two of
[3:54] behold the king that you chose behold
[3:57] the king that you chose
[3:59] part two
[4:00] and we realized that israel desired
[4:04] something
[4:05] and i'm going to have them pull up a
[4:06] quote it'd be the only quote that i have
[4:08] today but i was listening to a service
[4:10] yesterday
[4:12] called the rejected king and this
[4:14] incidentally is when the prophet
[4:17] introduces that whole picture of israel
[4:19] rejecting the king and it wasn't just
[4:22] the prophet because
[4:24] the prophet samuel said to the people
[4:27] to tell the people god said you have not
[4:30] rejected me because the prophet was
[4:32] saying they've they want a king
[4:34] and they've rejected me as god's prophet
[4:36] but god said you have not rej they have
[4:39] not rejected you samuel they've rejected
[4:41] me
[4:42] so in choosing their own king they
[4:45] actually rejected the king of kings
[4:48] that's that's quite a choice in choosing
[4:50] their own choosing they rejected and so
[4:53] listen to it if you can and rejected
[4:54] king but i'm going to read a few things
[4:56] from it as he says it was a time that is
[4:59] in all times that people
[5:01] has never wanted god to lead them they
[5:03] want their own way of leadership and
[5:06] this story this morning and when you go
[5:08] to your home it would be good for you to
[5:10] read it all the way through it was
[5:12] during the time of the days of samuel
[5:15] the man of god the prophet and he had
[5:17] been a just man
[5:18] a good man honorable reputable
[5:21] true and honest with the people never
[5:23] deceiving them telling them nothing but
[5:25] straight thus saith the lord but the
[5:27] people had come to a place where they
[5:29] wanted to change this program they had
[5:32] looked upon the philistines and the
[5:34] amalekites and amorites and hittites and
[5:37] the other nations of the world and they
[5:39] had seen that they had kings that ruled
[5:41] them and governed them and guided them
[5:44] and fought their battles and so forth
[5:46] and this seemed to be that israel wanted
[5:48] to pattern themselves like these kings
[5:50] and like these people
[5:53] but it has never been in any age
[5:56] god's intention for his people to act
[5:58] like the people of the world or to be
[6:01] governed or controlled like the people
[6:03] of the world
[6:04] god's people as always has been a
[6:07] peculiar people a different people a
[6:10] called out a separated and all together
[6:14] different in their action in their ways
[6:17] in their manner of living than what the
[6:21] peoples of the world has
[6:23] so let's make it real clear this morning
[6:25] is that this is the lesson out of this
[6:27] is that israel wanted to be like the
[6:29] other nations but as christians we're
[6:32] not to be like other nations we're to be
[6:34] different in our manner of life our home
[6:37] should be different our dress should be
[6:39] different our conversation should be
[6:41] different can you say man and we're just
[6:44] like israel if we start to get on the
[6:46] internet and start to copy what the
[6:48] world is doing and still want to be a
[6:50] christian you need to know god has
[6:53] blessed us to be a peculiar people a
[6:56] different people we don't take our cues
[6:59] from what everybody else is saying and
[7:01] doing
[7:02] we take our cues from the word of god
[7:07] you know a lot sometimes especially
[7:09] young people but a lot of people they
[7:10] don't get out of that mode that childish
[7:12] mode that they don't want to be
[7:13] different they don't want to look
[7:14] different they don't want that word
[7:16] peculiar they want to fit in with the
[7:18] world but once you go into revelation
[7:20] you realize it's a blessing to be called
[7:22] to be a christian to be different in
[7:24] this world i don't want to be a
[7:26] statistic i don't want to be like them
[7:28] be somebody different
[7:30] dare to be different young person i dare
[7:32] you to be different than the world i
[7:35] dare you to give your life to christ and
[7:37] be different than the world
[7:38] it doesn't take very much for you to fit
[7:40] in with what they're doing everybody's
[7:42] doing that the crowd's doing it but what
[7:44] it takes is the holy ghost chris field
[7:46] christian to say listen i don't mind
[7:48] being different for the lord i don't
[7:50] mind expressing the image of god
[7:54] can i get a bigger amen than that
[7:57] and so he finishes he says
[7:59] god's people has always been a peculiar
[8:01] people different people are called out
[8:02] separated all together different in
[8:04] their action in their ways in their
[8:06] manner of living than what the peoples
[8:08] of the world has
[8:09] their appetites for things and all that
[8:12] their makeup is has always been it has
[8:15] been always contrary to the things of
[8:18] the people of the world and he goes on
[8:20] later to say the people said
[8:22] after
[8:23] samuel said if if you get this king he's
[8:26] going to do this he's going to do he's
[8:27] going to take your daughters he's going
[8:29] to take your sons and put them in the
[8:30] war he said all the stuff that's going
[8:32] to happen and the people said but we
[8:34] still want to be like the rest of the
[8:37] people
[8:37] there's something about men
[8:40] and women
[8:41] that they long to be
[8:43] like
[8:44] one another
[8:47] now that's a profound statement
[8:50] and we don't know all the reasons why
[8:52] but we got six thousand years of history
[8:54] to see that human beings have something
[8:57] in them that they want to be like
[8:59] somebody else like another human being
[9:02] and then we come along in the lord and
[9:04] and the prophet says
[9:06] jesus was the perfect example if you're
[9:08] going to pattern your life after
[9:09] somebody pattern it after jesus christ
[9:12] i want to be like him
[9:15] but there's something in our nature and
[9:17] i wish i had just another time to talk
[9:19] about
[9:20] comparisons to talk about this thing in
[9:23] our human nature to want to be like
[9:25] everybody else it starts when we're
[9:27] young we're disappointed with the way we
[9:29] look how god made us and so we do all
[9:31] these things to try to copy some sports
[9:33] star some movie star or someone even
[9:36] that we're we like in the church that
[9:37] dresses better than us and we start
[9:39] copying because there's something in us
[9:41] that wants to be somebody else other
[9:43] than ourselves and then we get older and
[9:45] we think we get out of it but we don't
[9:47] get out of it because the neighbor will
[9:49] get something the neighbor get a nice
[9:50] new deck and all of a sudden you'll see
[9:52] the next neighbor get a nice new deck
[9:54] ain't that right my daughter's smiling
[9:56] at me because once she started to do all
[9:58] of her stuff in the backyard her
[9:59] neighbor's
[10:00] doing more in her backyard ever since
[10:02] ryan started to do it and it's just this
[10:04] brother brown called it comparisons he
[10:06] says we're always trying to copy we're
[10:08] always trying to be like someone else
[10:10] someone gets a swimming pool and all the
[10:12] rest of the in the neighborhood
[10:14] everybody's got to get one and so
[10:15] there's something in human nature
[10:17] and god has to deal with this in our
[10:19] lives because even as christians we can
[10:21] strive and have such a drive in our
[10:24] lives but we better check our motives
[10:27] for what we do because if our motive is
[10:30] rooted to be like the world and to be
[10:32] accepted and to be praised and and to do
[10:36] it for that reason it's the wrong motive
[10:39] we would be just as wrong as israel to
[10:41] say we want a king like other nations we
[10:45] want our church to be like other
[10:46] churches we want to have all this modern
[10:49] stuff going on and we want all this
[10:50] stuff listen we're not interested in
[10:53] copying any other church
[10:56] i remember when i was a when we just
[10:58] started the church being a young man and
[11:00] just learning and different things and
[11:03] by the way i'm still learning actually
[11:05] sometimes i feel like i don't have a
[11:07] clue what i'm doing the more we grow we
[11:09] realize what we don't know
[11:11] and we we know less and less but when i
[11:13] started i wanted to be like and i was
[11:15] invited certain places you know and
[11:17] brother biscuits and brother donny
[11:18] reagan's in different places you know
[11:20] and it seems like that they were had the
[11:22] things and they had a nice function
[11:24] there and all that so as a young man you
[11:26] know you try to copy yourself just we're
[11:28] going to do this we're going to do that
[11:29] we're going to make it just like then
[11:31] i'll tell you the lord corrected me in
[11:32] such a such a
[11:34] straight way one time after a few years
[11:37] of that and he just spoke to my heart
[11:39] says i haven't called you
[11:41] to do what they're doing
[11:44] i haven't called you to copy yourself
[11:46] after what you think is the right way to
[11:48] do it in the message
[11:51] i've got a vision for you what to do
[11:53] with the people in this area and how to
[11:55] teach the people in this area can you
[11:57] say amen and boy the lord corrected me
[11:59] you don't compare you don't copy well
[12:01] there's church this message church this
[12:03] is doing this that's the way this
[12:04] preacher does it and i've shared with
[12:06] you before you got to remember when i
[12:08] was married my wife came for brother
[12:10] donnie reagan's church and because i'm
[12:11] his friend i can say this publicly my
[12:13] wife came from brother donnie reagan's
[12:15] church and so she moved to mine and i
[12:17] became her pastor but i was kind of just
[12:19] jokingly saying she had two pastors for
[12:22] a very long time it was me and brother
[12:24] donnie even though she was here because
[12:26] i was always compared with how brother
[12:28] donnie does things
[12:30] anybody got a wife like that
[12:32] anybody got a husband that's always
[12:34] comparing you with the other
[12:36] how clean the other houses are in the
[12:37] church i hope not
[12:39] oh and and
[12:41] all of a sudden you can't it's just as
[12:43] quiet as ever
[12:44] nothing worse than being you being
[12:46] compared with somebody but you know that
[12:48] took that was a little while and then i
[12:50] think after a while she just had my wife
[12:52] just had one pastor which is a blessing
[12:57] but i would sometimes i just say to her
[12:59] you know i just say but you know he he
[13:01] did it this way
[13:02] well i'm not brother donnie
[13:04] and he's doing what he's called to do
[13:06] and look man is the lord blessed it but
[13:09] if i try to copy someone else it will be
[13:11] blessed
[13:13] if you try to copy somebody else it
[13:14] won't be blessed because god hasn't
[13:16] called you to do that
[13:18] can you say amen
[13:19] god has gifts within you god has things
[13:21] within you and we live our lives this is
[13:23] such a profound statement he says
[13:25] there's something about men and women
[13:27] they long to be like one another but
[13:30] when we get the holy ghost we say god i
[13:32] want to be like the nature of christ i
[13:35] want to be like the lord i want to
[13:37] follow what is your example
[13:39] and your identity can be found in the
[13:43] word your identity in jesus christ so
[13:46] you don't live your whole life trying to
[13:48] be some other brother some other sister
[13:51] can i get an amen this morning
[13:53] praise the lord so we have to do
[13:55] something brother brad says check our
[13:57] motives for what we do check your mode
[14:00] everybody say that check your motives
[14:02] that's a quote
[14:03] check your motives we should always be
[14:06] doing it notice he doesn't say check
[14:07] your actions
[14:09] not check your actions
[14:11] motives are deeper than actions
[14:14] what you do and what you say is your
[14:16] actions but there's a motive for what
[14:18] you do
[14:19] there's a motive for what you choose
[14:21] there's a motive for what you wear
[14:24] so when he says check your motives it's
[14:26] not checking your actions it's checking
[14:29] what's your motive for doing it and are
[14:31] you copying somebody
[14:34] can you say that
[14:36] everyone has a personal responsibility
[14:38] to say lord
[14:39] i want to check my motive for doing this
[14:41] what's my motive and if it's tainted a
[14:44] little bit with i want to be like
[14:46] somebody else i'm trying to be praised
[14:48] from the people i'm trying to look good
[14:50] in the world standards
[14:53] you ought to ask the lord to purge that
[14:54] motive because it's the wrong motive
[14:57] you want your character to be expressed
[14:59] sisters be pretty be pretty but don't
[15:02] emphasize the outward so much that the
[15:05] n-word is smothered out
[15:08] god is featured
[15:10] in character
[15:12] and when you when you are have the
[15:15] character of the holy ghost in christ
[15:17] it will reflect in what you wear
[15:20] can you say amen
[15:22] so it's choices we make and i'm about to
[15:24] move swiftly along along today because i
[15:26] there's a point at the end i want to get
[15:28] to
[15:29] but we got to talk a little bit about
[15:30] this i'd like to delve deeper into
[15:32] saul's life
[15:34] and quickly because many of you read
[15:36] this and if you haven't read all this
[15:39] this section of the bible brother brahm
[15:40] says it in the quote you should take
[15:42] some time and read it all the way
[15:43] through when saul's anointed read what
[15:45] happened afterwards and watch in the two
[15:48] or three years that he's king watch
[15:49] things come out of him that become the
[15:52] fruit that become the the actions of
[15:55] their choice and and it's why god's
[15:57] saying behold your choice behold this is
[16:00] what you choose and they started to
[16:02] watch characteristics come out of saul
[16:04] they realize we have made the biggest
[16:06] mistake what have we done because they
[16:09] realized they wanted a king to go with
[16:11] them in battle they wanted a leader they
[16:13] want somebody to leave their lives but
[16:15] they didn't realize they didn't judge it
[16:17] by the character that was in him
[16:20] and if we're not judging things in our
[16:22] decisions by character we're going to
[16:24] get in trouble
[16:26] i said we're going to get in trouble
[16:28] and i talked a few weeks ago about
[16:30] marriage and choosing of a bride such a
[16:31] significant message brother brown
[16:33] preached the choosing of a bride because
[16:35] christ is choosing a bride at the last
[16:37] days the kind of bride he's choosing but
[16:39] it goes down to couples and young ones
[16:40] that would choose that's a second most
[16:43] important decision in your life you
[16:44] better pray you better have the holy
[16:46] ghost both of you can you and i'm not
[16:48] threatening you saying that i said
[16:49] that's what you need to do you need to
[16:51] say lord help me to choose the character
[16:54] of the word in my mate then brother
[16:56] branson if she's pretty fine but choose
[16:58] character first
[17:00] how does she relate to the word of god
[17:02] how does she respond
[17:04] to the word of god brother brad says a
[17:06] pretty spirit will come here in meetings
[17:08] like this and sit and listen to the word
[17:09] of god and respond to it and give her
[17:11] life to god that's a pretty spirit
[17:14] and then if she's pretty naturally well
[17:16] you get a double bonus
[17:20] praise the lord
[17:22] so i want to talk about saul a little
[17:23] bit
[17:24] and
[17:25] i hope you have a lot of time because
[17:27] i'd like to i'd like to talk about him
[17:29] behold your choice it reveals so much
[17:31] when we see over time
[17:33] what saul manifested and there's a
[17:36] principle here that we
[17:38] we also learn it's actually a law
[17:40] and that's the law that you're familiar
[17:42] with the law of soul reaping and sowing
[17:45] sowing and reaping
[17:47] we reap what we sow
[17:49] and what we sow is decisions many times
[17:52] we sow decisions we make decisions every
[17:55] day and all of those decisions we will
[17:58] reap a harvest from those decisions
[18:01] whether good or whether bad how many
[18:03] believes in the law of sowing and
[18:04] reaping how many has lived out the law
[18:06] of sowing and reaping
[18:08] amen so it's a law you can't get around
[18:10] it that's thinking about the laws of god
[18:12] and the laws of nature you can't change
[18:14] these laws they work whether you get a
[18:16] good harvest or you get a bad harvest
[18:18] everybody's under the same laws you're a
[18:20] 16 year old boy you're under the same
[18:22] law of sowing and reaping
[18:24] your dad is i'm under the same law
[18:27] everybody's the same so you make
[18:28] decisions as a 16 year old boy you're
[18:30] going to reap from what you sowed in
[18:33] those years oh he's sowing his wild oats
[18:35] give him time he's sowing his wild oats
[18:37] well every wild oats that he sows he's
[18:39] going to reap a harvest from it so it'd
[18:42] be good to catch this law when you're
[18:44] young about 14 13 even 12 it'd be good
[18:47] to catch this law this applies to you if
[18:49] you sold the wrong seeds in your life
[18:51] you're going to have a harvest from it
[18:53] you're going to reap what you saw oh you
[18:56] might embarrass your parents and every
[18:57] other thing but you're the one that sold
[19:00] the wrong seed
[19:01] you're going to reap a harvest
[19:03] but it goes both ways the law works when
[19:06] we sow good things in our lives
[19:08] the law still works we sow the right
[19:11] principles and we stay close to the word
[19:13] of god we're going to reap a harvest
[19:14] from that we're going to reap a good
[19:16] holy ghost-filled mate from that
[19:19] we're going to reap a good marriage from
[19:21] that we're going to reap a good family
[19:22] from that the decisions you make now
[19:24] when you're young so now you reap what
[19:27] you sow you will you will eventually see
[19:29] the fruit i'd like you guys to turn up
[19:31] proverbs chapter 1 if you would verse
[19:33] 24. you will eventually see the fruit of
[19:36] your choices
[19:37] god
[19:38] this is how it is now listen
[19:40] god will let you see clearly over time
[19:44] the fruit of your own choices and he
[19:46] says here
[19:47] turn you go back to 23 if you would
[19:51] turn you at my reproof a reproof is a
[19:53] rebuke a reproof is a a correction and
[19:57] he's saying you should listen to my
[19:59] correction you should listen to my
[20:00] rebuke turn you at my reproof behold i
[20:03] will pour out my spirit unto you i will
[20:05] make known my words unto you
[20:08] next because i have called and ye
[20:11] refused i have stretched out my hand and
[20:14] no man regarded so this is someone who's
[20:17] rejecting the reproof and the counsel of
[20:19] god i've i've stretched out my hand to
[20:21] you i've given counsel but ye have said
[20:23] it not all my counsel you you won't
[20:26] listen to my counsel and with none of my
[20:29] reproof
[20:30] and i i also will laugh at your calamity
[20:33] so when calamity comes and you eat of
[20:35] that i will laugh your calamity i will
[20:38] mock when your fear cometh
[20:40] when your fear cometh that's desolation
[20:43] and your destruction cometh as a
[20:44] whirlwind when distress and anguish
[20:46] cometh upon you then shall they call
[20:49] upon me but i will not answer they shall
[20:51] seek me early but they shall not find me
[20:53] this is why this is a serious thing
[20:54] because you can reach a point where
[20:56] where you so push god's counsel off that
[20:59] that
[21:00] i know god is always listening but it
[21:02] appear to you now god says go back to
[21:05] the other one if you would
[21:06] go back to what then shall they call
[21:08] people but i will not answer they shall
[21:09] seek me early but they shall not find me
[21:11] that's a serious state to be in
[21:14] you can cross the line where you turn
[21:16] down counsel enough that all of a sudden
[21:19] god withdraws a little bit
[21:21] so the next one says
[21:23] for they that hated knowledge and did
[21:24] not choose the fear of the lord the next
[21:26] one they would none of my counsel they
[21:28] despised all my reproof next one
[21:30] therefore
[21:32] shall they eat of the fruit of their own
[21:35] way
[21:36] first person i heard preach on this was
[21:37] brother lonnie jenkins and so open up
[21:40] the word to me
[21:41] therefore shall they eat of the fruit of
[21:44] their own way they're going to not just
[21:46] see the fruit of their own way and their
[21:48] own choice but they're going to eat the
[21:50] fruit of it
[21:52] not the fruit of the lord
[21:54] not the fruits of the spirit you're
[21:55] going to eat of your own fruit therefore
[21:58] shall they eat of the fruit of their own
[21:59] way and be filled with their own
[22:03] devices
[22:06] is this this this is a
[22:09] scripture to really ponder
[22:11] you're going to eat of your own devices
[22:16] the cell phone
[22:17] the internet
[22:21] you feed on the wrong things you might
[22:23] eat of your own devices
[22:27] devices can get us into trouble
[22:30] all the new devices can get us into
[22:31] trouble
[22:33] but you keep feeding on certain things
[22:35] you eat of your own devices your own
[22:37] plans your own way israel wanted their
[22:39] own king eventually there's a principle
[22:41] that if you keep going that direction
[22:43] you're over time you're going to see the
[22:45] fruit of your decisions and you're going
[22:47] to eat of the fruit of your own way
[22:49] there's another scripture brother lonnie
[22:51] brought up and this is an extreme one
[22:53] but it's the truth in romans chapter one
[22:54] if you guys would bring up romans 1
[22:58] but this is the same principle and he
[22:59] brought it up i thought it was amazing
[23:01] romans 1 verse 21 romans 1 verse 21 if
[23:04] you had that because that when they knew
[23:06] god they glorified not as god neither
[23:09] were thankful but became vain in their
[23:11] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[23:13] darkened
[23:15] professing themselves to be wise they
[23:17] became fools
[23:19] and changed the glory of the incorrupted
[23:20] god into an image made like unto
[23:22] corruptable man and to birds and
[23:24] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[23:26] wherefore god also gave them up to
[23:30] uncleanness now catch that that's what
[23:31] brother lonnie read after a while god
[23:34] gave them up to what they wanted
[23:37] god gave them up to their uncleanness
[23:39] through the lust of their own hearts to
[23:40] dishonor their own bodies between
[23:42] themselves so we have it happen in a day
[23:45] people turn so far away from god the
[23:46] only thing left of this lust and women
[23:48] lust towards women men lust towards men
[23:52] you know why they do that because god
[23:53] has removed anything from them to keep
[23:56] them from doing it because they wanted
[23:58] it so bad god just gave them up to it
[24:01] i don't want to be in that state
[24:05] who change the truth of god into a lie
[24:07] and worship and serve the creature more
[24:08] than creator who is blessed forever amen
[24:11] for this cause god gave them up unto
[24:13] vile affections for even their women did
[24:16] change the natural use into that which
[24:18] is against nature so this is the second
[24:20] time he says god gave them up god gave
[24:23] them up and likewise also the men
[24:25] leaving the natural use of the women
[24:27] burned in their lust one toward another
[24:29] men with men working that which is
[24:31] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[24:33] that recompense of their heir which was
[24:35] meat
[24:36] and even as they did not like to retain
[24:39] god in their knowledge god gave them
[24:41] over to a reprobate mind to do those
[24:44] things which are not convenient listen
[24:47] there's something being said in this
[24:48] scripture is that there's certain
[24:50] protections and certain things that god
[24:52] can keep you from through his counsel
[24:54] and through his word but if you keep
[24:56] fighting for your own way and going in
[24:58] this case towards lust lust lust turning
[25:00] god's reproof down there's a place god
[25:02] gives you up god gives you up and god
[25:05] gives you over even to a reprobate mind
[25:09] now that's an extreme case i pray none
[25:11] of us would reach there but the
[25:13] potential is there
[25:15] god just says you're going to eat of
[25:17] your own fruit of your own way now you
[25:19] just go right ahead it's very uh
[25:23] jolting for me to hear brother lonnie
[25:24] speak on these things it helped me as a
[25:26] young christian man to realize this is
[25:28] the world without god and turns god down
[25:30] doesn't want god in their knowledge
[25:32] you don't do that without fruits coming
[25:35] from it
[25:37] sin
[25:38] debauchery
[25:39] lust
[25:41] and then all that comes from the
[25:43] homosexual lesbian and all these other
[25:45] things but where did it start somebody
[25:48] turned down the reproof and corrections
[25:50] of god
[25:51] and finally god said i have tried my
[25:53] best to keep warning you over and over
[25:56] again and don't forget god can warn you
[25:58] through a donkey if he has to
[26:02] i said god can warn you through anything
[26:06] but it's mostly the word of god but if
[26:08] he's giving you a reproof that's god's
[26:11] protection you better listen to it
[26:12] because if you keep turning it down i'm
[26:14] going to take my own choice my own way
[26:16] then this is the type of things that
[26:18] comes from it can you say amen that
[26:20] closes that part now let's move to saul
[26:23] if you turn with me in the bible to
[26:24] first samuel chapter 10. i want you to
[26:26] notice something here and we're studying
[26:28] the word together i may not get to
[26:29] preach this as much as just
[26:31] teach just a little bit here because i
[26:32] want to see just a few things i pulled
[26:34] out first samuel chapter 10 and verse 6.
[26:38] it says here a couple things that were
[26:39] interesting and the spirit of the lord
[26:41] will come upon these talking to saul and
[26:44] thou shalt prophesy with them with the
[26:46] other prophets and shalt be turned into
[26:49] another man
[26:51] and then if you go down to verse 9 and
[26:54] it was so that when he had turned his
[26:56] back to go from samuel
[26:58] god gave saul another heart and all
[27:01] those signs came to pass that day now i
[27:04] thought this was interesting because the
[27:06] people chose
[27:08] saul to be the king for them they did
[27:11] not choose on character they did not
[27:14] choose on the heart like david was
[27:16] saul was not a man after god's own heart
[27:19] but the people wanted him because
[27:20] remember we talked about it he was head
[27:22] and shoulders above the rest he was tall
[27:24] dark and handsome and david was
[27:27] small
[27:30] fair freckleheaded and ruddy so the
[27:34] people chose by looks remember that
[27:37] and so so then they chose him because of
[27:39] his looks but there was no heart and
[27:41] look what god has to look at all god has
[27:44] to do to this guy just to make it work
[27:46] for israel
[27:49] he's got a he's got to turn he shall
[27:52] turn he shall be turned
[27:54] into another man
[27:58] and
[27:59] god gave him another heart
[28:01] he didn't even have in his heart
[28:04] what was needed to lead the people
[28:06] correctly
[28:07] he didn't have none of it
[28:10] and god somehow said because it's your
[28:12] choice i'm going to change this man's
[28:15] heart and make him another man on the
[28:17] inside because he has nothing that i
[28:20] need on the inside to lead god's people
[28:24] and sometimes friends it reminds me of
[28:27] not just the lesson of choosing the
[28:28] wrong leadership and choosing something
[28:30] wrong to lead you but it reminds us to
[28:33] say this statement
[28:35] you can be
[28:36] you can put on
[28:38] on the outside
[28:40] the message
[28:43] you can turn yourself into another man
[28:45] and wear all the right clothes and say
[28:47] all the right things if you grew up in
[28:49] the message you know how to act
[28:54] but how terrible it is when you have to
[28:56] be changed from what you really are in
[28:59] the inside the seed laying on the inside
[29:01] for david he had something within him
[29:04] already
[29:05] and if you work off of that you got a
[29:08] seed on the inside you don't transform
[29:10] yourself into some putting something on
[29:12] the outside you let that seed grow on
[29:15] the inside by the holy ghost and you
[29:17] will by nature be
[29:19] who you are
[29:22] i'm not going to spend more time on that
[29:23] but it's something for you to look at
[29:25] and study that god actually had to go so
[29:27] far as to take their choice he looked at
[29:30] that and looked at his heart and said he
[29:32] has nothing within him that i can use to
[29:34] lead my people but because you chose him
[29:36] i'm gonna have to change the man that he
[29:38] is i'm gonna have to change his heart to
[29:40] make this work for you
[29:44] it's incredible
[29:45] and so they wanted this though so bad
[29:47] they they turned god turned him into
[29:49] another man gave him another heart then
[29:52] we never see those scriptures in david
[29:55] where god had to change his heart or
[29:57] change him into another man
[29:59] he was the man
[30:01] god had for the job
[30:03] he was all he already had what he needed
[30:06] anything god doesn't choose in your life
[30:10] are you listening
[30:12] you must be because it's quiet
[30:16] don't forget i got a i got a real good
[30:18] part at the end end of this
[30:20] this might be convicting here but i got
[30:22] a real good ending to this sermon and i
[30:24] hope you all stay for it
[30:26] you're hanging on aren't you
[30:29] this is going to end really good
[30:31] but i got to just really plow here a
[30:33] while to show us
[30:36] we can see the decisions we make and we
[30:38] can learn from them and god lets us
[30:40] behold
[30:42] and learn from them
[30:46] david didn't need to change himself he
[30:48] already had what he needed anything god
[30:51] doesn't choose in your life
[30:53] becomes put on
[30:55] it becomes phony
[30:57] can i make that point out of that
[30:58] scripture
[31:00] if it's not god's choice and it's your
[31:02] own you have to make it work and even
[31:04] god's making it work and it becomes
[31:06] phony it becomes put on you had to make
[31:08] saul into a different guy
[31:10] and you have to keep being phony but
[31:12] with god
[31:13] if you get a hold of what god wants in
[31:15] your life it's real
[31:17] it's genuine
[31:19] it's the seed weighing within you
[31:21] how many want something real
[31:23] this is literal life church the real
[31:25] life
[31:26] it's the reality it's not anything put
[31:28] on it's the real deal
[31:31] god when he does something and his
[31:33] choice in your life it's not he doesn't
[31:35] have to put on anything it's real from
[31:37] the very core of what it is
[31:39] i want to be a real christian
[31:41] i want to be real can you when i make a
[31:43] mistake i want to be real say god i've
[31:45] made a mistake
[31:46] i want to read a genuine holy
[31:48] ghost-filled christian i don't want to
[31:50] be phony and put everything on in front
[31:52] of everybody to try to meet all the
[31:54] other things and what people want in my
[31:56] life i want it to be from my heart
[31:59] i want to love this message from my
[32:01] heart
[32:02] and i want it to be
[32:04] real nothing put on can you say it
[32:07] because my god is real my god is real
[32:10] he's really real in my soul
[32:13] my god is real for he has washed and
[32:16] made me whole
[32:18] his blood for me is like pure gold my
[32:22] god is real
[32:23] for i can feel
[32:25] him in my soul
[32:28] god is real his people are real what
[32:31] they have within him is not phony it's
[32:33] the real seed of god it's the real holy
[32:35] ghost you don't have to put on anything
[32:39] somebody say praise the lord
[32:42] say god i want the real thing
[32:45] god i don't want you to have to work
[32:47] around all my decisions and make it work
[32:49] and make it look holy change somebody no
[32:52] god shouldn't have to do that if it's
[32:54] the real heart of christ the heart of
[32:56] david it will do the right thing because
[32:58] it is what it is
[33:00] so we look at saul
[33:02] now real quickly what did he produce
[33:04] over time even though
[33:06] he was anointed what did he produce in
[33:08] his life you don't see it in the first
[33:10] year of his life everything was going
[33:12] good he was winning battles he seemed to
[33:14] be a good captain of the army he seen me
[33:16] going but it was over time you begin to
[33:18] see things pop up in saul brother samuel
[33:21] browning brought him out friday night
[33:22] here while he was preaching but over
[33:24] time you see the character of saul pop
[33:26] out and start to manifest itself i'm
[33:28] just going to summarize because most of
[33:30] you probably in sunday school heard the
[33:31] stories of saul and what he did one
[33:34] significant one is he disobeyed god with
[33:36] what the prophet told him to to do
[33:38] but there's a couple other things here
[33:40] that show his character and so why am i
[33:43] saying them and let me just summarize
[33:44] this by saying
[33:46] israel chose someone
[33:48] because this is what i found yesterday
[33:50] when i was studying this in the summary
[33:53] of what saul really was and what he was
[33:55] doing
[33:56] israel chose someone to lead them that
[33:59] slowly moved away from god's true
[34:04] prophet
[34:09] and now we can preach on that
[34:12] israel chose leadership in their life
[34:16] that they didn't recognize would slowly
[34:18] move them away from
[34:20] god's prophet and obey god's prophet
[34:24] now don't we have a world full of
[34:26] influences and leadership like that
[34:30] never mind denominations
[34:32] in our own ranks we have people become
[34:35] leaders
[34:36] and if you choose their leadership they
[34:38] seem like such a fine christian and all
[34:40] that be careful
[34:41] because the agenda is to lead you away
[34:44] from the authority of the prophet of god
[34:48] i didn't discover that till last night
[34:50] until i was studying i said my look at
[34:51] this
[34:52] and here here's what happens first
[34:54] samuel 9 9.
[34:56] just let me lay in a principle here okay
[34:58] let me say any other leadership you
[35:00] choose besides the holy ghost in your
[35:01] life will lead you away from
[35:03] the word of god that a prophet brought
[35:05] i'm going to say this again
[35:07] any other leadership you choose in your
[35:08] life to lead your life if it's not the
[35:10] holy ghost
[35:11] it will
[35:12] lead you away from the word of a true
[35:15] prophet
[35:17] that's its main agenda
[35:19] to disqualify it to discredit it to
[35:21] disrespect it now how important was the
[35:24] prophet back in saul's day for samuel 9
[35:26] 9 do you have that brother first samuel
[35:29] 9 9 says before time in israel when a
[35:31] man went to inquire of god
[35:33] thus he spake come and let us go to the
[35:37] seer
[35:38] for he that is now called a prophet was
[35:40] before time called a seer
[35:44] so those that who went to inquire the
[35:46] lord and listen now we're still human
[35:49] beings
[35:50] we have questions
[35:53] and so once you have a question about
[35:55] anything in life
[35:57] you're going to inquire
[35:59] if you're smart you should
[36:02] inquiring minds want to know
[36:06] you're going to inquire and when the
[36:08] people in israel wanted to inquire they
[36:10] went to a man called the seer it was now
[36:12] called a prophet now it switched over to
[36:14] a prophet but because he could see he
[36:16] was used of the lord to see things we
[36:18] can't see they depended i said can i set
[36:20] up an interview with the seer they
[36:22] called him a seer because i have some
[36:24] questions i'd like to know some things
[36:27] and it was so important that's the
[36:29] source that you went to
[36:31] if you had a question and wanted to
[36:32] inquire about something back in that day
[36:35] you set up an interview with the seer or
[36:37] the prophet you said this is what i need
[36:39] to know can the lord show you anything
[36:42] because god could bless that man where
[36:45] he could see and get the right answer
[36:46] this is what you should do this is where
[36:48] you should go this is where you should
[36:50] move this is what should take place it
[36:52] was a blessing to have that can you say
[36:53] amen and so that was the spirit so this
[36:56] is a principle that's established is
[36:58] that we should live our lives we should
[37:01] live our lives as they did and that is
[37:03] we should consult the lord and his word
[37:07] about things that we're inquiring about
[37:09] i would do everything you can in your
[37:12] decisions financial decisions family
[37:14] decisions decisions about who to marry
[37:17] whatever it is i would use this
[37:19] principle that you're looking for the
[37:22] word of god from the prophet that has
[37:24] eyesight to see
[37:26] beyond what you can see
[37:29] the counsel of the lord consulting the
[37:31] lord
[37:33] millions of decisions are made every day
[37:36] without the counsel of the lord
[37:41] but this is what israel did
[37:43] when we got to inquire about something
[37:45] let me be basic about it
[37:48] we still do it
[37:50] but when there was a question in our
[37:52] family about something
[37:54] should we do this should we have this
[37:55] should we do
[37:56] and just counseling other families say
[37:58] if they ask me what should i do research
[38:01] the word get your bible and get the
[38:03] message
[38:04] search program and search everything
[38:06] that the prophet said about it and every
[38:08] scripture you can find and after you've
[38:10] done all that pray about it
[38:12] and then make a decision for your family
[38:14] but don't you dare make a decision
[38:16] without reading everything that you can
[38:18] in the word about about it because why
[38:20] the word is still a seer
[38:23] the word has discernment
[38:25] that's the z say well we don't have a
[38:26] prophet living today but listen we've
[38:28] got a bible that's full of the prophets
[38:31] and god blessed us with the prophet in
[38:32] the end time and preserved it that we
[38:34] can find out what he said about thee
[38:36] you'd be surprised what the prophet of
[38:38] this hour says about a lot of things
[38:41] somebody one time was trying to
[38:43] justify a social drink i don't think
[38:45] it's wrong to have a social drinking now
[38:47] now again every once in a while i think
[38:49] that's our personal liberty and paul did
[38:51] it and they always bring the scriptures
[38:53] up and all these other things and so i
[38:54] don't think it's wrong to do that what
[38:55] do you think so i just went back to the
[38:57] house and me and becca said well we need
[38:59] to find out and all the way back early
[39:01] on he just makes a little comment he
[39:02] says some of you christians think that
[39:04] you can take a little social drink
[39:07] i mean it was the exact words the person
[39:09] asked me about
[39:12] it's getting quiet in here
[39:14] and there it was now for us i don't know
[39:16] what that person did i gave them the
[39:18] quote it's up to them it's their own
[39:20] choice
[39:20] but for our family that's all we needed
[39:23] just a little hint i'm not going to try
[39:25] to get into what paul drank and there
[39:27] was no water back then that was good so
[39:28] they had to drink wine and all these
[39:30] other things for social i'm not going to
[39:32] get into that discussion god sent to me
[39:34] a prophet in this hour and the way that
[39:35] he leaned us towards that's what i want
[39:38] to do drinking any kind of alcohol today
[39:40] has no good connotation for your
[39:42] testimony can you say amen and that's
[39:45] why the prophet probably said we stay
[39:47] away from it as christians because of
[39:49] what it represents
[39:51] it's not so much the alcohol because
[39:53] when you take nyquil you're pretty
[39:55] pumped up with it
[40:00] but if i order a drink in front of
[40:02] everybody or try to do it privately just
[40:04] with a few people i've got the whole
[40:07] testimony of everything that represents
[40:10] and i value my testimony so i'm not
[40:12] going to get into this discussion about
[40:14] what paul drank back in the bible i got
[40:16] a prophet at this hour that lead me in
[40:18] the right direction
[40:19] and i'm comfortable with it people
[40:20] struggle with that oh you're giving him
[40:22] too much authority i don't struggle with
[40:24] it at all i'm thankful to have a word
[40:26] from a prophet i'm thankful to have some
[40:28] type of absolute to tie me back to the
[40:30] absolute of the word god
[40:32] and most the time he's quoting a
[40:34] scripture to tie us back to avoid the
[40:37] very appearance of evil
[40:42] man this isn't in my notes this is free
[40:44] this morning
[40:45] avoid the very appearance of evil
[40:48] so
[40:49] i could give a hundred more examples of
[40:50] stuff like that that people ask me about
[40:52] this that even like the bedroom you know
[40:55] and i'm not going to talk about that but
[40:57] just like the bedroom and the privacy of
[40:58] the bedroom and you know what this and
[41:00] what to wear and all this stuff listen
[41:02] you have to pray but don't you dare make
[41:06] a decision based upon what the world
[41:08] does
[41:10] or what you see in magazines or what the
[41:13] leaders of the world said this is okay
[41:14] to do get your bible
[41:16] get in a spirit of prayer with your wife
[41:18] your husband and your family and get
[41:20] into that message every one of you can
[41:22] have it on an app now and do a search
[41:24] within seconds on every subject and
[41:26] every word
[41:29] it's a pitiful shame when people won't
[41:31] search they don't want to know what the
[41:32] prophet says probably
[41:34] but i encourage you as families and
[41:36] heads of your home if you're going to
[41:37] base your life on the word of god you
[41:39] grab your bible you grab that message
[41:41] and say we're going to base this home on
[41:43] what the word of god says we're going to
[41:45] consult the lord
[41:50] in the old time when people inquired of
[41:52] the lord
[41:53] they sought out the seer
[41:55] to get answers
[41:57] everybody understand
[41:59] we're blessed today
[42:01] to have the word preserved for us
[42:03] that we can search and find out what he
[42:05] said about it
[42:06] so first samuel chapter 11 says
[42:09] 11 7 first samuel 11 7
[42:12] and you took a oak of oxen and hewed
[42:13] them in pieces and sent them throughout
[42:15] the coast of israel
[42:16] by the hands of messengers saying
[42:17] whosoever cometh not forth after saul
[42:21] and after samuel so shall it be done
[42:23] unto his auction
[42:24] and the fear of the lord fell on the
[42:26] people and they came out of one consent
[42:27] brother brahm commented on this
[42:28] scripture this is the first little sign
[42:30] you see of saul and he's actually been
[42:32] told of the lord to speak because
[42:33] there's an army coming against them and
[42:35] they're going to do all this stuff but
[42:37] he
[42:38] saw in his own
[42:39] there's a there's a tad of arrogance
[42:41] showing here because he cuts up an oxen
[42:44] hewed them in pieces sent them
[42:45] throughout all the coaster of israel by
[42:47] the hands of messages saying whosoever
[42:49] cometh not forth after saul and after
[42:51] samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen
[42:54] and the fear of the lord fought on the
[42:55] people did anybody notice that early on
[42:59] he's using his name first
[43:03] before the prophet
[43:04] now that might not seem very much and we
[43:06] might be getting technical here
[43:08] but to me it says something about the
[43:11] way he's thinking
[43:13] i'm the leader now
[43:15] and so i'm going to put a fear over the
[43:16] people but it's not just going to be the
[43:18] fear of the prophet's word
[43:20] i'm going to put my name in there you
[43:21] need to fear me too
[43:24] you need to fear me
[43:27] and he actually puts his name
[43:29] before the prophet
[43:31] might not be a big thing but it's the
[43:33] start of him going all the way over one
[43:36] or two years later
[43:37] where he just basically disobeys
[43:40] what the prophet said how many knows he
[43:42] did that
[43:44] where does it start well here he is
[43:45] putting himself in front of him and
[43:47] putting his self before the people he
[43:49] was self-centered as brother sam
[43:50] browning preached he was self-centered
[43:52] he only cared about himself his own
[43:54] kingdom he started to build up his own
[43:55] kingdom and so it's very subtle here but
[43:57] it showed his character coming out first
[43:59] samuel 13
[44:00] 8-11 i'm moving through these quickly
[44:03] first samuel 13 8-11 and he carried
[44:06] seven days according to the set time
[44:08] that sammy had appointed but samuel came
[44:10] not to gilgal and the people were
[44:11] scattered from him
[44:13] and saul said bring hither a burnt
[44:15] offering to me and peace offerings and
[44:16] he burnt the offer and he offered the
[44:18] burnt offering and it came to pass that
[44:20] as soon as he made the end of the
[44:21] offering the burnt offering behold
[44:22] samuel came and saul went out to meet
[44:24] him that he might salute him
[44:26] and samuel said what hast thou done so
[44:28] we stop right there we understand from
[44:31] whatever we have read
[44:33] in the scripture in sunday school
[44:34] whatever here's what samuel did the
[44:37] second thing that shows that something's
[44:39] wrong is that is when he got impatient
[44:42] and when samuel didn't show up quick
[44:44] enough there was an army coming on him
[44:46] he felt the pressure to make a decision
[44:48] quickly and so now in in patience he
[44:51] don't wait for the prophet to get there
[44:53] to bring the sacrifice he says bring it
[44:55] and i'll do it myself
[44:58] it's pretty serious he's stepping out of
[45:00] his position
[45:01] prophet was supposed to do that
[45:04] so once again it's this disrespect
[45:08] i don't need the prophet
[45:11] i can do this on my own now friends
[45:14] be careful of the leadership that you
[45:16] choose in your life that's saying the
[45:18] same thing
[45:24] subtly
[45:26] you know
[45:27] you can function just fine
[45:29] there's a message the minister who left
[45:32] the message the other day said something
[45:33] to one of our people here
[45:35] i just said grieve my heart
[45:38] it's a typical message believer
[45:41] he was slamming them for putting brother
[45:42] branham what brother brahman said just
[45:44] slamming him for a typical message
[45:45] believer i felt like saying to him okay
[45:48] i'm a typical message believer and i'm
[45:49] not ashamed of it
[45:51] but that little subtle thing says you
[45:53] know what he said i'm functioning fine
[45:55] believing in the blood of jesus christ
[45:57] i'm functioning fine
[45:59] and i don't have to acknowledge
[46:01] what he said
[46:03] that's fine you have a it's a free
[46:04] country
[46:05] you have liberty to do it
[46:08] but a man that used to preach this
[46:10] message and i guarantee you he knows
[46:12] more than that on the inside he's just
[46:14] taken another spirit
[46:18] slamming the sisters for quoting the
[46:21] prophet of god that we love and we
[46:23] believe that led us in this hour and the
[46:25] holy ghost is still leading us through
[46:27] the word that he spoke and the ministers
[46:29] are speaking for him to belittle that
[46:31] that's pretty sad it all stayed
[46:33] respectful i i watched it it was
[46:35] respectful but those little subtle
[46:37] things there
[46:38] to to throw out you know you can do this
[46:42] and ditch
[46:44] the whole idea of this
[46:46] prophet
[46:48] that's what saul's doing
[46:51] give me that sacrifice i can't wait you
[46:52] know what else it speaks of everybody
[46:54] listening
[46:55] an unaccountable
[46:57] relationship an unaccountable life
[47:01] if i get in a jam i can go do it myself
[47:04] and once again not consult the lord not
[47:06] wait on the lord
[47:09] don't make decisions too hastily without
[47:11] consulting the lord and this is what
[47:14] saul did the last one moving quickly
[47:18] the last one
[47:20] he outright disobeyed the prophet's word
[47:22] as we turn to first samuel 15 15
[47:27] verse 2.
[47:30] final stage
[47:34] of saul's life
[47:37] israel's looking at what america israel
[47:39] is saying by now what in the world have
[47:41] we chosen
[47:42] what in the world is this man doing
[47:44] he's disrespecting the prophet
[47:46] and we chose him
[47:50] slowly away from the prophets first
[47:51] samuel 15 2 and 3 says thus say the lord
[47:53] of hosts i remember that's what
[47:55] ambulance did to israel how he laid
[47:57] weight for him in the way when he came
[47:58] up from egypt
[48:00] now go and smite amalek and utterly
[48:02] destroy all that they have spare them
[48:04] not but slay both man
[48:07] and women
[48:08] infant and suckling ox and sheep camel
[48:12] and ass stop right there
[48:14] that's the
[48:15] word that's the word from the prophet go
[48:17] slay them
[48:18] amla kites and don't spare
[48:21] slay both man women infant suckling ox
[48:24] sheep camel and ass that's the word from
[48:26] a prophet
[48:28] but you know the story he goes
[48:31] and then the prophet comes up to him
[48:34] and he says what have you done he says i
[48:36] have done the word of the lord.
[48:39] and the prophet says why is there
[48:41] bleeding of sheep in my ear
[48:44] so now he goes this process this prophet
[48:47] explaining
[48:48] i love when kids are
[48:50] just listening to me because they've
[48:51] been taught these things
[48:54] he's explaining himself saying
[48:58] that i've done the word he's actually
[49:00] come to self-deception
[49:03] because he's deceived into thinking i
[49:04] did the word of the lord
[49:06] but you didn't do it according to the
[49:08] prophet's word
[49:09] what meaneth this bleeding in the sheep
[49:11] in my ear what are all these spoils from
[49:14] the what is all this thing what is all
[49:16] this so verse 9 please first samuel 15
[49:20] verse 9
[49:22] but the saul and the people but saul and
[49:24] the people spared a gag spirit in the
[49:26] best of the sheep and the oxen the
[49:27] fatlings and the lambs and all that was
[49:30] good and would not utterly destroy them
[49:31] but everything that was vile and refuge
[49:34] that they destroyed utterly
[49:36] verse 20 please
[49:39] then came the world understandable and
[49:40] sam saul said and said yeah i have
[49:42] obeyed the voice of the lord and have
[49:44] gone the way which the lord sent me and
[49:45] have brought back agag the king
[49:49] wait stop
[49:51] he's going on i have did the word of the
[49:53] lord i have gone the way the lord sent
[49:55] me and i have brought back to in this
[49:57] prophecy stop right there what you
[49:59] brought back the king
[50:01] i didn't tell you to do that
[50:05] so he's proclaiming
[50:07] what the prophet said
[50:09] but he gets off track listen friends
[50:12] we need leadership that stays with what
[50:14] the word of god says
[50:19] so much could be said
[50:21] about people getting under leadership
[50:23] even sometimes in our own ranks
[50:26] that they do what saul did they start
[50:29] injecting their own way to do things
[50:32] we need leadership that has the balance
[50:34] of the word but we need leadership that
[50:36] gives the full counsel of the word
[50:38] and not holds back anything
[50:40] and we don't need brothers interpreting
[50:42] what brother branham said and trying to
[50:43] add to it and trying to make out all
[50:45] these things after the seals brother
[50:47] braham says don't interpret anything
[50:48] leave this alone if god wants you to
[50:50] know anything he'll bring it to pass why
[50:52] is brother ryan saying that because men
[50:53] will mess it up trying to interpret
[50:55] themselves trying to take the lamb and
[50:57] he steps forth he leaves the mercy seat
[50:59] all these other things be careful how
[51:00] you handle it
[51:02] and for years in this message we have
[51:04] people taking that and it gets off track
[51:06] and we see the fruit of it now then
[51:08] you'll have ministers pick it up again
[51:09] and go down the same path and you're
[51:11] like saying no no we know what that
[51:13] produces don't go there
[51:15] been there done that got the t-shirt no
[51:17] we see the fruit that that produces
[51:20] don't mess with that leave it alone
[51:22] preach it the way the prophet said it
[51:24] but don't try to add to it or or make up
[51:26] some mysterious thing that people walk
[51:29] out of the surface and they can't even
[51:30] understand what's being said i had a
[51:32] dear sister telling me that just the
[51:34] other night saying we just couldn't do
[51:36] it because i'd walk out and i couldn't
[51:38] he's preaching quotes but i didn't
[51:39] understand what he was saying i said
[51:41] sister that's the tragedy is that if you
[51:44] don't understand what's being said then
[51:45] what good is it to be there
[51:49] god help me as a minister god help me
[51:51] that even the smallest child can get
[51:53] something out of the sermon
[51:55] we're not here to preach up here so
[51:57] nobody has a clue and just as long as
[51:59] you come here you're in the elite god
[52:01] help us friends that's a soul spirit for
[52:03] a man to lift himself up above brother
[52:05] branham was never that way he wanted the
[52:07] people to understand
[52:10] and if you don't understand it trust it
[52:12] believe it and god he says will open
[52:14] your eyes to things
[52:16] you know what it'll produce it'll
[52:17] produce more of the life of christ
[52:20] the difference is how people view the
[52:22] message some people reveal is just some
[52:23] movement but i view it as the revealing
[52:25] of jesus christ if it doesn't bring more
[52:27] of christ to you then we're missing
[52:29] something
[52:30] somebody ought to clap their hands and
[52:31] say praise the lord because that's needs
[52:33] to be said
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:36] god hastened the day when he gives us
[52:39] more true leadership in this message to
[52:41] lead the people properly can you say man
[52:44] there's been way too many people get off
[52:46] track injecting their own thing in their
[52:48] assault type leadership
[52:51] god raise up more davids
[52:53] that have the heart of god for the
[52:55] people
[52:56] and then
[52:58] verse 22 he deceived himself did i get
[53:01] verse 20 yet brother
[53:03] verse 20
[53:06] and saul said unto samuel yeah i obeyed
[53:08] the voice of the lord gone away brought
[53:09] gay and have utterly destroyed the
[53:11] americans it's just subtle in there
[53:14] but the people took the spa sheep and
[53:16] oxen the chief of things which should
[53:17] have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice
[53:19] of the lord thy god in gilgal verse 22
[53:22] and samuel said hath the lord as great
[53:23] delight and burnt offerings and
[53:24] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[53:27] the lord behold to obey is better than
[53:30] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[53:32] rams we find the principle to obey is
[53:36] better than sacrifice
[53:38] see saul thought he would get credit
[53:40] because of all the sacrifice and all the
[53:42] things he did do but when he got off the
[53:43] word that's where he messed up
[53:47] god doesn't judge us by our sacrifices
[53:49] that we make
[53:51] can you say amen
[53:53] i love this little part here if you guys
[53:54] have it there i didn't put it on my
[53:56] notes but look what he says here it's so
[53:58] interesting chapter 13 and verse 12
[54:00] when he's still
[54:02] in his explanation therefore said i the
[54:05] philistines will come down
[54:08] and upon me to gilgo and i have not made
[54:11] supplication of the lord i forced myself
[54:14] therefore and offered a burnt offering
[54:16] that's going back when he offered the
[54:17] sacrifice i forced myself
[54:20] i didn't want to do it but i was in a
[54:22] hurry and you didn't show up samuel and
[54:25] i forced myself
[54:27] it sounds the devil made me do it
[54:30] i was in a hurry and i had to do it now
[54:33] i know i didn't weigh to the lord but i
[54:35] i forced myself how do you do that
[54:39] self-deception self-glorification
[54:42] it's all in the character of saul and
[54:46] don't forget this isn't a worldly man
[54:49] this is the man leading the children of
[54:53] israel
[54:54] anointed
[54:55] by god's prophet
[54:58] see we're coming down to
[55:01] a razor blade edge
[55:03] can you say man
[55:05] and we have to say lord give me the
[55:07] right leadership in my life
[55:09] because it's so easy it can just get off
[55:11] track
[55:13] anybody learning anything this morning
[55:15] let's change this whole thing now
[55:17] as i promised
[55:19] because none of us like to talk about
[55:21] all the bad decisions we've made in our
[55:23] lives i trust that you have behold and
[55:26] like israel behold your king look what
[55:28] he's doing look at his disobedience look
[55:30] at him taking you away from the prophet
[55:31] till he disobeyed look at and and behold
[55:34] i trust that you've done that and i
[55:36] always
[55:36] i always desire for you to apply it to
[55:38] your own life lord help me in my
[55:40] decisions that i make
[55:42] help me and my choices i make let me
[55:44] choose you let me have your choice
[55:46] can you say amen
[55:48] but we don't want to go all day here
[55:49] saying beholding our bad choices and
[55:52] beholding the fruits of them and we're
[55:54] eating the fruit of our own choices
[55:56] let's change this around let's talk
[55:57] about behold let's behold a little bit
[55:59] the grace of almighty god
[56:03] because god never leaves us there
[56:05] hanging with just our choices as a
[56:07] matter of fact brother barry said one
[56:08] time the way that we can reverse a bad
[56:10] harvest of bad seeds that you have sown
[56:13] wrong seeds you've sown is to stop there
[56:16] you're still going to reap some of that
[56:17] harvest but to start planting the right
[56:20] seeds
[56:22] you can't change things there's some
[56:24] things you're never going to be able to
[56:26] change friends
[56:27] but you can start getting into the word
[56:29] and planting the right seeds and just a
[56:32] few years from now sometimes it takes a
[56:33] while talking with brother rap in the
[56:34] office sometimes it takes time for
[56:36] people to be purged of the wrong seed in
[56:38] their life they've been under the wrong
[56:40] preacher been under the wrong thing it
[56:42] doesn't happen overnight but if you
[56:44] start planting the right seeds you're
[56:45] going to see a harvest from it
[56:47] in your family in your marriage in your
[56:49] lives can you say man thank god for the
[56:51] law of harvest works the other way for
[56:53] us
[56:54] and i can apply the word of god and
[56:56] plant the right seeds if i was a rough
[56:58] man with my children i can start being
[57:00] nice to my children start being good to
[57:02] them start planting and praising
[57:04] themselves always criticizing them i can
[57:06] change and start planting the right seed
[57:08] and get a harvest from that
[57:10] it may take a long time but the law of
[57:13] harvest still works can you say amen
[57:16] and so here's what i wanted to say to be
[57:18] positive this morning to talk about
[57:20] let's behold not just ch let's change
[57:23] this beholding our choices let's behold
[57:25] his grace as if you would turn to first
[57:28] samuel chapter 12
[57:30] and then we'll wrap up with this but i
[57:32] know you're gonna love this you're gonna
[57:34] i promise you we're gonna get to
[57:35] something here that's really good and
[57:37] then we're gonna close the service but
[57:38] listen first samuel chapter 12 and verse
[57:41] 14
[57:43] now here is is god speaking through his
[57:45] prophet now to israel if you will fear
[57:47] the lord and serve him and obey his
[57:49] voice and not rebel against the
[57:50] commandment of the lord then shall both
[57:52] ye and also the king that reigneth over
[57:54] you continue following the lord your god
[57:56] this is after they had chosen saul but
[57:59] if you will not obey the voice of the
[58:00] lord but rebel against the commandment
[58:01] of the lord then shall the hand of the
[58:03] lord be against you as it was against
[58:05] your fathers now therefore stand and see
[58:07] this great thing which the lord will do
[58:09] before your eyes is it not weed harvest
[58:12] today i will call unto the lord and he
[58:15] shall send thunder and rain that ye may
[58:18] perceive and see that your wickedness is
[58:21] great which you have done in the sight
[58:22] of the lord and asking you a king
[58:25] so here
[58:26] samuel says i'm just going to go the
[58:28] extra here and i'm going to prove to the
[58:30] people to show them how bad your choice
[58:34] was for saul
[58:36] and he says i'm going to call for
[58:38] thunder right now and reign right now
[58:41] and you're going to see how evil your
[58:42] choice was boy i tell you god can really
[58:45] show you the message you got yourself in
[58:49] and you just want to take a moment and
[58:51] capitalize on it and say i'm going to
[58:53] see show you what great wickedness this
[58:55] was in the king you've chosen and guess
[58:57] what happened verse 18 so samuel called
[58:59] him the lord and the lord set the
[59:01] thunder and rain that day and all the
[59:03] people greatly feared the lord and
[59:05] samuel right then crimp
[59:08] rain thunder i don't know how to make
[59:10] the thunder sound don't laugh at me
[59:11] grace it's hard to make a thunder sound
[59:14] i'm big enough but i don't have the
[59:15] voice to do it right at that moment
[59:18] christ
[59:19] you know just everything's stunning and
[59:21] israel's going
[59:23] ah and it just takes it even deeper kind
[59:25] of how we feel this morning he's like
[59:27] lord have mercy
[59:29] god
[59:30] i have really messed up
[59:34] see god has to take us
[59:36] to real true conviction of what we've
[59:38] done or we'll justify it
[59:41] we'll smooth it over it wasn't that bad
[59:43] things are no it was bad so they're
[59:46] they're seeing this thunder and rain and
[59:48] here's what they say
[59:50] verse 19 and all the people said unto
[59:52] samuel pray for us thy servants unto the
[59:55] lord thy god that we will not die for we
[59:58] have added unto all the sins this evil
[1:00:00] to ask a king they were really convicted
[1:00:03] and they said samuel after this thunder
[1:00:05] listen
[1:00:07] would you just pray for us because
[1:00:08] besides all of our sins now we've done
[1:00:11] this chosen saul
[1:00:13] would you pray for us please
[1:00:15] we're basically finished here
[1:00:17] the only hope we got is your prayers
[1:00:19] would you pray for us
[1:00:20] boy he's really got him in a spot here
[1:00:22] of conviction
[1:00:25] this is what i love next
[1:00:27] and samuel said unto the people
[1:00:30] fear not
[1:00:31] ye have done all this wickedness
[1:00:34] yet turn not aside from following the
[1:00:36] lord but serve the lord with all your
[1:00:38] heart and turn ye not aside
[1:00:41] for then should ye go after vain things
[1:00:44] which cannot profit nor deliver for they
[1:00:46] are vain you know what he's saying you
[1:00:48] get all these choices and you got saul
[1:00:50] and all this but he's still in his grace
[1:00:52] instructing them
[1:00:54] don't let this go any further
[1:00:58] you can start planting the right seeds
[1:01:00] right now
[1:01:02] for the lord read verse 22 with me loud
[1:01:06] for the lord will not forsake his people
[1:01:10] say it again for the lord will not
[1:01:13] forsake his people
[1:01:16] for his great namesake because it hath
[1:01:20] pleased the lord to make you
[1:01:23] his people if you don't get anything
[1:01:26] else today get this
[1:01:27] god in all your bad choices god will
[1:01:30] never forsake his own people

[1:01:41] you know i just i know that the lord
[1:01:43] blessed me to be here to to see healing
[1:01:45] come because there's been so many past
[1:01:47] situations just and sometimes they share
[1:01:49] the stories and but this is where this
[1:01:51] message come this morning this last part
[1:01:53] of it is listening to their stories
[1:01:55] saying you know what these people have
[1:01:57] been through so many things so many ups
[1:02:00] and downs within our own ranks it's

[1:02:05] been said about him some of the wrong
[1:02:06] leadership that they've been underground
[1:02:08] and yet i'm sitting here and see they
[1:02:10] have the greatest love for the lord they
[1:02:13] have a great love for the message can

[1:02:49] that way i don't want to darken another
[1:02:51] church door especially a messenger i'm
[1:02:53] not going to darken the door ever again

[1:04:05] says i no longer call you forsaken
[1:04:08] he says it looked like i forsake you for
[1:04:09] many years 70 years in captivity
[1:04:13] to babylon you know what all they
[1:04:14] rebelled against god saviour's captivity
[1:04:16] it looked like god forsaken i don't
[1:04:18] think god forsakes his people he just
[1:04:19] withdrew himself but he had a promise
[1:04:21] he's going to commit he said you used to
[1:04:22] be the forsaken
[1:04:24] can you can you pull up can you give me
[1:04:26] just two minutes

[1:04:31] and go there
[1:04:33] i'm having a good time god won't forsake
[1:04:35] his people friends
[1:04:36] all the bad decisions all the choices
[1:04:38] and how many once or he said i've got a
[1:04:40] lot of them i'll raise mine i've got a
[1:04:41] lot of them
[1:04:43] sometimes i think the only good ones i
[1:04:44] made is the lord and my wife i know i
[1:04:47] made a good choice in my wife and i have
[1:04:49] to
[1:04:50] grab onto that sometime lord but this
[1:04:52] was a good choice i prayed about it this
[1:04:54] was a great choice he's a beautiful lady
[1:04:57] and beautiful character
[1:05:00] who praise the lord
[1:05:03] what did i say oh okay isaiah 49
[1:05:06] i got caught up there in how beautiful
[1:05:07] that choice was that i made of my wife
[1:05:10] and how beautiful she is
[1:05:12] all right
[1:05:14] isaiah
[1:05:16] chapter 49. isn't that right some of you

[1:05:26] so if the devil's beating you up over
[1:05:28] your choices look at some of the right
[1:05:29] ones you made
[1:05:31] one is to choose the lord for this hour
[1:05:34] can you say man some of you for sick
[1:05:36] your whole family and your old family
[1:05:38] turned you out back then
[1:05:40] but it was the right choice

[1:05:45] all right it's hard to stop preaching
[1:05:46] today isaiah chapter 49 i'm going to
[1:05:48] give you the verse here brothers up
[1:05:49] there in a minute
[1:05:51] if you read through the book of isaiah
[1:05:52] it's wonderful because it just really
[1:05:53] talks about god's redemption
[1:05:55] and when you come back into the joy of
[1:05:57] the lord
[1:05:58] after he is forsaking you
[1:06:00] and he says here
[1:06:02] oh boy i didn't write the verse down
[1:06:09] oh boy
[1:06:12] you know what i'm gonna have to i can't
[1:06:14] find that
[1:06:19] oh verse 14. but zion said
[1:06:22] verse 13 single heavens and be joyful
[1:06:25] old earth and break forth into singing
[1:06:26] oh mountains for the lord had committed
[1:06:28] his people and will have mercy upon his
[1:06:30] vixen but zion said the lord hath
[1:06:31] forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten
[1:06:34] me and the lord says can a woman forget
[1:06:37] her suckling child that she should not
[1:06:39] have compassion on the son of her womb
[1:06:41] yea they may forget it's a possibility
[1:06:44] they may forget it's a hard thing for a
[1:06:46] mother to forget her child being born
[1:06:49] they may forget yet will i
[1:06:51] not forget thee
[1:06:55] you've been birthed by him you're in his
[1:06:56] family
[1:06:58] and then isaiah 54
[1:07:14] i wish i wrote these down okay yes
[1:07:17] verse 5
[1:07:18] for thy maker
[1:07:20] is thine husband
[1:07:22] the lord of hosts is his name and thy
[1:07:24] redeemer the holy one of israel the god
[1:07:27] of whole earth shall he be called for
[1:07:29] the lord hath called thee as a woman
[1:07:31] forsaken and grieved in spirit and a
[1:07:34] wife of youth when thou was refused
[1:07:37] saith thy god
[1:07:38] for a moment have i forsaken thee but
[1:07:42] with great mercies will i gather thee
[1:07:48] i say praise the lord
[1:07:51] for a moment and i don't even believe
[1:07:53] you for some reason for a moment i
[1:07:55] forsake thee i don't think he did but in
[1:07:57] our eyes he does but he says i'll gather
[1:07:59] you with great mercies
[1:08:02] why he won't forsake his people he'll
[1:08:05] withdraw himself from churches who will
[1:08:06] draw himself from denominations when
[1:08:09] they shut him out he'll withdraw himself
[1:08:11] saul tried his hardest friends
[1:08:14] after god rejected him he tried his
[1:08:16] hardest to get under the anointing and
[1:08:17] keep the keep the kingdom going and once
[1:08:20] he was done he was done
[1:08:22] god may remove leadership
[1:08:24] god may change church situations
[1:08:26] god may deal with men that you feel have
[1:08:29] abused you
[1:08:30] god will deal with those men
[1:08:34] but he won't ever forsake his people
[1:08:39] amen let's stand together
[1:08:48] i have a maker
[1:08:52] he
[1:08:54] for my heart
[1:08:57] before
[1:08:58] even time
[1:09:00] began
[1:09:02] my life was in
[1:09:05] his hands
[1:09:08] he knows my name
[1:09:16] he knows
[1:09:18] my head
[1:09:20] every thought
[1:09:23] and he sees
[1:09:26] each tear
[1:09:27] that
[1:09:28] falls
[1:09:30] and hears
[1:09:36] second verse
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:40] i have
[1:09:42] a father
[1:09:45] think about it now he calls me his own
[1:09:53] oh yes
[1:09:55] he'll
[1:09:57] never
[1:09:59] leave me
[1:10:02] no matter where
[1:10:06] i go
[1:10:08] sing it now oh
[1:10:12] he
[1:10:13] knows my name
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:28] he sees
[1:10:30] each tear
[1:10:32] that falls
[1:10:34] and hears me when
[1:10:38] i call
[1:10:41] you bow your heads just a minute and
[1:10:42] think about
[1:10:44] the leadership that you were under
[1:10:46] one day
[1:10:48] some of you are sitting here maybe
[1:10:50] thinking of the fathers that you were
[1:10:51] under and it
[1:10:52] wasn't a godly man
[1:10:54] maybe the mom wasn't a godly woman and
[1:10:56] so you endured loving them as a father
[1:10:59] and mother and yet at the same trying to
[1:11:00] work through all the confusion of being
[1:11:03] under that wrong type of leadership
[1:11:05] but look how you hear today by god's
[1:11:07] grace you can tell the devil i'm still
[1:11:09] here
[1:11:10] because god will not forsake his own
[1:11:13] god didn't forsake you
[1:11:15] under the wrong ministers under the
[1:11:16] wrong influence
[1:11:18] but god didn't forsake you you're still
[1:11:20] here this morning and how we can raise
[1:11:21] your hand and say i have something
[1:11:23] within me that has a pure love for god
