[Music] I'm gonna see nothing [Music] else oh God [Music] please [Music] thank you I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me so he's he's already describing as as nice as they're having a time together here of course you know the disciples really don't have a clue what's going to happen the next few hours in his life he's told them but because they don't have a revelation they don't understand what's going to transpire to me it's going to be one of the greatest sacrifices anyone's ever made it's going to be the greatest pivotal time in history for The Souls of men and they don't have a clue they're just having this time and they don't know it's the final time with Jesus at least for that time and so now while he's sitting there there's another thing going on and he begins to describe it and that is he uses the scripture in the Old Testament he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now I tell you before it come that when it has come to pass ye may believe that I am he verily verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I sinned receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth me receiveth him that sent me when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me remember he only has 12 disciples there it's a small crowd there but he said one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one to another doubting of whom he spake now there was one leaning on Jesus bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him that he should should ask who it should be of whom he's fake he then lying on Jesus breast saith on him Lord who is it who is it Jesus answered he it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it and when he hath dipped us up he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of Simon and after the stop Satan entered into Judas then said Jesus unto him that that thou doest do quickly in other words in our language whatever you need to go do you should go do it now now he's never made that statement before even though one thing I want you to know tonight he's known what's in the heart of Jesus the entire Journey the entire three and a half years he knew he had to know but it wasn't until the hour come and the time come that Jesus began to expose it and actually gave him gave him the Liberty okay this is in your heart you need to go do what you need to do now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him for some of them thought because Jesus Judas had had the bag he took care of the money Judas had the bag that Jesus had said unto him by those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor that's once again the disciples are in the dark about what's really going on and so but Jesus knows exactly what's going on and that's why his spirit is troubled and the rest of them don't have a troubled spirit all this is going on and Jesus has a troubled spirit because he knows what's taken place and so he sends him off they think he's going just for food or something but he knows you need to go do what he you need to do verse 30 and he then having received the stop went immediately out and it was night and I'll get to this at the end of the service tonight but we're just 31 says therefore when he was gone out when Judas left Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him and from that point on when Judas exited from that point on chapter 14 chapter 15 chapter 16 is all an intimate time speaking just with his disciples and so it and he didn't he didn't do that before in quite this way now he changed and so now it's going to be a more intimate speaking just with his elect amen so I want to talk about Jesus in his hour of betrayal in this journey this week as when they come into the crucifixion Friday night and the Resurrection Sunday so I want to talk about Jesus in the hour of his betrayal and I just want to get into it a bit deeper tonight so that maybe we'd understand it maybe you have a a good understanding of it but I think it's relevant to talk about uh as Jesus went into we know that times that Jesus was rejected and Jesus was turned down by the religious leaders and so he he lived a life of rejection by many people he was accepted by his disciples but then as this hour come and it's described as when you come into this hour this this last hour it became a time of great betrayal that everyone was betraying Jesus not just Judas now because a few scriptures later Jesus after Jesus left then he actually says all of you will be offended so it's it's not just a spirit that is just on Judas now but the the spirit of betrayal is all around so much so that even his own elect are affected by this I'm scared I don't know what to do and so I'm just I'm gonna back off from this even as elector doing that but there's a difference in the elect in Judas can you say Amen there's a big difference even though sometimes they come under the spirit that's prevalent around but I just want to say tonight praise be to God there was one person there that did not bow or did not come under the spirit of betrayal and that was Jesus Christ himself can you say a man he was not going to betray God he was not going to betray the word he was not going to betray what the word said about him can you say ma'am and and I think that's a wonderful thing because I want to be like Jesus I want to be that one that's not the one that betrays him can you say amen I want to be loyal to our Lord I want to be loyal to the message of the hour I want to be faithful to him can you say Amen no matter what kind of spirit of compromise is around I want to be faithful to my Lord and and be better at that praise the Lord so now moving into this next phase we see Jesus spirit is troubled not only is he the only one who sees the next step that's coming and that is to end his life on Earth and to go to Calvary and he would go and carry uh every sin of the world on his shoulders and bear it and that includes your sin that includes my sin that includes every sin of the world so you can imagine someone's spirit being troubled because he's the only one there that really knows God knows that this is the next step he knows this is the next step Jesus knows this is where I'm headed within hours now this is what in the scripture proclaims of me but but can you imagine now bearing it alone he's the only one who knows he's the only one that sees it and so you know a lot of it he's bearing alone within himself so I would think that if you're headed to Calvary if you're headed to a Calvary bearing the sins of the world I would say that would be enough to trouble your spirit but but when we we take a look at this that would be enough pressure in his Spirit but to top it off to top it off now the scripture that says his spirit is troubled is tied with saying one of you shall betray me so on top of going to Calvary on top of bearing the sins of the world on top of the pressure of bearing that alone he's got one of his disciples sitting there and nobody knows it but he's fixing to betray him and I believe that's why his Spirit was troubled as well I believe it made it worse can you say Amen one of his own chosen disciples has made a deal secretly to betray him he has known it all along Jesus has known along and if you don't get anything else tonight just think about that a minute all the three and a half years of Ministry Jesus has known this from day one of of being with Judas yet he never exposed him he called he called Judas he sent him out to cast out devils and everything I'm saying I was going to read tonight to you but you know it if you know the scripture if not you can look it up Jesus caught Jesus called Judas as one of his disciples he sent him out to cast out Devils to heal the sick to raise the Dead he watched Judas as he shouted and he rejoiced and and they said when they come back casting out Devils they were all rejoicing they were shouting Jesus watched Judas and all the time he never said nothing he let him shout he let him rejoice and all the time he knows down the road where this boy is going but it's something interesting about Jesus that he didn't just jump on it even what he knew sometimes it's not wisdom to just jump on it can you say man sometimes you got to let it manifest itself and so he lets him go on he's rejoicing he's shouting and by the way I might say that to you is that just because somebody's shouting higher than you and somebody's dancing all over the building doesn't mean they have something real all the time sometimes it's real sometimes they're getting deliverance and sometimes they're just emotional and shouting because everybody else says but they're not getting anything I've talked to a lot of people who have shouted and screamed and did everything and when they walk out and you counsel with them there's no Deliverance yet there's nothing delivered yet can you say Amen so Jesus watch this in Judah says he shouted with the others but listen friends we want to have a substance can you say amount we want to have the real thing in our hearts and then when you got the real thing then shout then dance then Worship the Lord praise the Lord but he was able to watch this boy and watch him come along watch him fellowshipping with all the brothers on the boat Sea of Galilee watch him with all the rest the power of God come on him to cast out Devils fellowshipping with the rest of the brothers serving and working with handling the the whatever he did there and handling all the meetings of five thousand people serving as an usher whatever he did he watched him and then he watched him new one night he snuck away and he made a deal with all the church leaders the council to join them to come up against him and catch Jesus to catch him in something and Jesus knows all of this all the time and he holds it all within himself and lets him go on and my point tonight my point tonight to you there must have been something very much stronger in Jesus to know all of this and to endure It Whatever Jesus had to endure because remember Jesus said to us now about the end time he that shall endure to the end shall be saved there's an endurance but it's not an endurance in our own energy because I can't tell you we're not going to survive this the last day's Spirit we're not going to survive any of this but he had something that he could endure this intense pressure he could endure betrayal he could endure watching someone come along and and maybe mistreating or betrayal and especially at the end he could endure it and whatever Jesus had I want that tonight can you say amen I want to be able to act appropriately I want to be able to act in love because that's what I believe he had he had the Father's Love living within him and there's only one thing that can override betrayal in our lives and that's Divine love everybody has experienced betrayal isn't it amazing that our Lord did too no betrayal has been like Jesus betrayal and he stood alone betrayed by everybody how many has ever felt alone before your lord was alone more than anybody the whole world it seemed like was against him everything that moment when he went to Calvary he stood there alone by himself bearing the sins of the world he had no support he had no brothers and sisters around him he had no friends his own friend and he calls him that at the end he calls Judas he calls him friend even at the end these the ones that's closest to him and now they all run they all scatter and he stands there completely alone at the most pivotal point in history and he does it and there's no way ever a human being could do that except he's got God living with him and he's been baptized with the Divine love of God he's holding to the word can you say he's holding to the promise of God and that's why he could endure because there was something stronger in him to override the Betrayal might I say to you there's something stronger that you can have in your life that will override every betrayal that you've experienced can I get an amen tonight I'm here to preach you there's something stronger that can come in your life that will override and be stronger than any way that you have been betrayed it must have been something stronger in Jesus to know all of this and to endure it especially at this hour when his Spirit was troubled we can't endure anything unless God puts something in us to endure it I say we can't endure any of this we are we would react just like the world does right except God I like that term that song is heaven but it says but God we were lost but God we we didn't have any hope but God rich in Mercy but truth will prevail how many believe that the truth will come out you you it will no matter what we hide it will be exposed God never forgets unjust injustices that are done unless they're repented of if somebody repents that's when it's washed away but if there's been an injustice of any kind and it hasn't been repented of it's going to come back to haunt somebody someday God will take care of Injustice God will do it if you read the book of Psalms and David you certainly see that is that he talks a lot about his enemies he talks a lot about being persecuted David talks a lot about all these this that's against him and yet he kept really keeps releasing it to God releasing it to God saying I'm going to give it to him he's he's in control can you say Amen God will take care of it but the holy spirit is his nature he won't let you hide anything and he just brings it out and actually if people would mature and be know things that's the greatest thing that can happen to you whether it's bad or good Let It manifest let it come out even it's a bad desire God oh now I see my desires are wrong God you've got to change my desires if it was all hidden in here you don't know but when it's manifested maybe you have a sin maybe you do something all of a sudden it becomes public and everything well my goodness sometimes say oh I want to hide it I don't want it to be become public but sometimes God has to do that because it jolts you to say here it is you got to deal with it now you got to give it to me no the nature of the holy spirit is to to lovingly bring it to the surface so God never forgets no matter what we hide it would be exposed and what's in US truly will come out it may take years but it will come out and I don't mind if it's bad or good that comes out because the truth sets you free being betrayed may be the worst pain that happens in our spirit Jesus Spirit was troubled there's one of you should that betray me and his Spirit was very troubled by it being betrayed I think affects human beings in the worst pain sometimes betrayal means to break Trust to let down somebody let you down to break one's promise that means someone broke their promise to be disloyal and it actually means to deceive you know first of all I think of Judas and all those things to let down to break one's promise to be disloyal to break trust and to deceive because that's what Judas did there was a deception to us but see when you're on the other end of betrayal now it does not feel good when you've been the one who's betrayed somebody you have to repent you have to make it right but I'm talking about the ones are on this end of being betrayed being let down someone's broken their promise and guess what guess what because we're human beings don't ever think that in some fictitious World we'll live in this world and never be betrayed amen it's it's human beings you're going to be betrayed people are going to break promises and he uh he's there three and a half years knowing Judas and he leaves it alone he never treated Judas any different and he knew what he was anybody listening just don't don't turn the channel off yet I was still there he was with Judas and knew all this for three and a half years and he never treated treated Judas different than the rest of believers so much so the disciples could never detect anything indifferent in treatment he could have added attitude toward Judas and the disciples pick up on everybody Lord I noticed you got a little attitude towards Judas sometimes what's going on that night they didn't know who it was Judas is acting out something he's being a hypocrite Jesus is letting it alone he never treated treated judicity different and at the end when they come to the garden and the Bible says Judas is standing with the soldiers he's standing with them instead of with Jesus after three and a half years he stood with his disciples through everything and now he's standing with the soldiers against him that's some people that have exited this truth who are you standing with and he he comes over I'm closing he comes over and he grabs Jesus and he kisses him Judas kisses him as a sign to show them he's the one but yet he would go so far as to give something that's it's a kind of a close intimate friendship thing to kiss someone right Embrace him kisses him that was a sign but it just it reminds me sometimes of people that have completely turned against you and they just give you a big hug and everything's okay and it's all phony Judas they're not being real it's a Judas kiss but talk about a moment to be angry it's like why is he kissing me why is he greeting me this way and here's his response even now friend called him friend where have you been maybe his convicting say why are you with these guys well he knew why he was with them but friend why is he calling him friend because he has something greater in him than Judas ever had that's the only way he could do that something stronger than Jesus and whatever he has I want more of it tonight I want more of it tonight thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website
