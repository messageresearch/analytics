TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] You say hold every thought captive, but my thoughts have chains on me. You say faith can move a mountain. God help my unbelief. Every doubt keeps pulling me under. Every fear keeps dragging me down. How long, oh Lord, till you pull me out? Then I see reach for me. In valleys, dark in deep. I'm overwhelmed. I'm overrun. But it's not over. If the night should carry on, remind me where my strength is from. I'm overwhelmed. I'm over but I'm holding on cuz soon I'll come. I can hear a million voices that are filling up my mind. All the lies I keep believing. All the fears I try to hide. [Music] Every doubt keeps pulling me under. Every fear keeps dragging me down. How [Music] long I see you reach for me in the dark ocean. I'm overwhelmed. I'm overrun. But it's not I should carry on. Remind me where my strength is from. I'm overwhelmed. I'm overrun. But I'm holding [Music] on cuz soon I'll [Music] [Applause] [Music] overcome. You are the rock of my sal. [Music] You are the world on which I stand. And when the world is rise around [Music] me, I'm overwhelmed. I'm over. Remind me where my strength is from. I know. I know. But I'm holding [Music] [Applause] on cuz you're [Music] not [Music] soon. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Psalms 46, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will will not we fear, though the earth be moved, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with swelling thereof. Sa there is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the only the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her and that right early. How many you know that when he's present and he says he's in the midst of her. It's interesting that's speaking of the city, but it's also speaking of the bride. He's in the midst of her. And the reason she can't be moved is because he's in the midst. God is in the midst of her. He shall not be moved. God shall help her. And that right early the heathen raged. The kingdoms were moved. He uttered his voice. The earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Sailor like to go back and look at the elements of his kingdom here. And that is that you have him in the midst of her. You have her not moved. You have the heathen raging. When you have his kingdom and you have these elements, the heathen is raging and other kingdoms became uh crushed and become moved. And then you have the element of him uttering his voice. And when he utters his voice, the earth melted. Now, when we go to Hebrews 12 in the New Testament, you're going to find exactly the same language here in speaking about his kingdom breaking up other kingdoms. So, I want to read it and see how you know the Bible is inspired by the Holy Ghost. And as David wrote that inspired by the Holy Ghost, then we find uh Paul here in Hebrews writing exactly the same thing in continuity. Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 25. See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escape not, who refuseth him that spake on the earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven, whose voice then shook the earth. So I want you to notice there's the voice that David talked about. The voice is present. The voice is speaking. What's it doing? It shook the earth. But now he promised saying, "Yet once more, I shake not the earth only, but also heaven." at this word yet once more signifyth the removing of all those things that are shaken. This voice is so powerful it will shake every other kingdom on the face of the earth. Th those things that are shaken are the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain and that's the kingdom of God. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. This is the way we should live if we've received a kingdom. How many believe that we have received his kingdom? This is thy kingdom come part two. And I want to continue on it because I I'm discovering more things um that even though this prayer, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, is probably quoted by millions of people, probably a majority of those people don't know what that means to pray, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven." We have so many things that become popular, including Christmas time. But how many people don't know the true meaning of it? And so I've been looking at this prayer again uh and looking at over and and and many people and believers quote this uh and know that since Christ, they'd actually know we we have had in phases uh for when Christ came from that point we've had the kingdom coming to us in phase phases. In other words, his kingdom coming back to earth. He has to redeem the earth and he has to redeem his people before his kingdom can be established back on earth again. But it's a process. It's been quite a long process, a couple thousand years. And God promised back in the garden there would be a redemption. There would be a restoration. But then we find when Jesus came, uh, that was the beginning of the kingdom. It wasn't just Jesus standing there, God in flesh, but he was bringing something with him. He was the king and he was bringing his kingdom to this earth. And that's the first time we get to see what God looks like in human flesh. What God looks like on the earth in a full manifestation. And he's actually carrying the principles, the word. He is the word and he's bringing that to earth. That's God's desire to bring himself in his kingdom back to earth again. And so this morning I want you to look at it because we realize that uh that it's well known that his kingdom is coming and many know that when Christ came he was bringing his kingdom. He talked about it so it's in the Bible. They know that his kingdom is is coming. John introduced him by saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. So he was saying the kingdom is coming through this uh through this Messiah coming. And so we need we need to repent. That's what he called for is repentance as a prerequisite to the kingdom coming. We need to repent. I wonder if it's the same today. If you're interested in his kingdom coming to you and you have the kingdom within you, it starts with repenting. It starts with a true repentance. If you want something more of God, it starts with a true repentance. And so, uh, then it is also well known that the kingdom relates to after the last days, uh, there will be an ushering in of a new age and it's called the kingdom age. And that's the millennial reign of Christ for a thousand years. And so many Bible scholars, many people that maybe don't read their Bibles much, they kind of have that in their mind. They know that. And then we realize what we spoke about last Sunday. His people come a bit early into that kingdom before the millennium. There's a people who come into uh his kingdom by revelation. And that's because in Revelations 5, the book of redemption, the book, the title deed that was to the earth that Adam had got lost, went back into the hands of the original owner and it was lost from Adam and he fell. Him and Eve fell and they lost the authority. They lost the title deed. They lost the the inheritance that they had. They lost the power. And so now they become weak because sin came in the picture. Everything that they had that was given to them by God was lost there in the garden. His authority, his power, and his title deed that he actually owned the earth and ruled and reign over it. It got lost in the file. And then God starts to say, "I'm going to bring that all back. I'm going to bring my kingdom back on this earth. I'm going to purge it from every sin and every spirit. I'm going to bring it back. But before I bring that kingdom back to the earth, I'm I'm going to spiritually put that kingdom in the hearts of the people. And that's why in Revelations 5, after that book is opened and our kinsman takes that book, we realize that the last thing they said is we shall rule and reign. That's quite a proclamation. I thought the king was supposed to rule and reign. I thought it was Jesus. Well, he is the king of kings. But they're saying after the book is open, we shall rule and reign as kings and priests. That's a pretty bold statement. But they had a it it takes a revelation. They had never said that. They would have been more of the past religions that would say our king is going to be the king and he's going to rule and reign in the millennium. But they weren't saying just that. They were saying we shall rule and reign. Can you say amen? We shall rule. something happened in Revelations 5 and a revelation come to their hearts to say we as his people shall rule and reign. Can you say amen? So it would it would take a a revelation of the entire view of his kingdom coming to make that statement. We shall. Anybody ever had uh somebody say we? Like for example, you know, a husband saying, you know, to his buddies, he's saying, you know, uh me and my wife, we we had a baby and it was real hard. And the wife hears and she goes, "What you mean we? What you mean we?" Or the wife's on the phone say, "Yeah, we cleaned the whole yard today. It looks beautiful." and and the husband's listening in the corner saying, "What you mean we?" I I drive up my driveway and I have kind of a long one there. And I I drive up and I have to I hear my wife saying, and I hate to say this, but it's like, "We need to do that. We need to cut those trees down. We need to" And we get up to the house and we need to move those flowers. We And I'm going, "What you mean we? You mean I do that?" you but it's it's polite to say we we need to do that. It's like a you know we we go together but you know what uh Christ said where I am you may be also everything that he overcome he's called you to overcome. Every kingdom power that he's come to in authority he's given that to his people as well. So they were allowed by revelation to say it's not only our king but we shall rule and reign. Can you say amen? And so it it's it's because uh uh after the book was taken and the seals were taken off, we become joint hes with Christ. And that's why we can say we shall rule and reign. Can you say amen? So because of the revelation in the bride, she is the one calling for the kingdom to come. Millions and billions may say the Lord's prayer, thy kingdom come. That's fine. That's fine. But it's the ones that have received the kingdom by the word that are qualified to call for his kingdom to come. Can you say amen? It is the ones who have already received and taken possession of the kingdom of the word that are qualified to say the prayer, thy kingdom come, thy will be done. It's us that's qualified to pull it from the other dimension and bring it to earth. Not only to say say it, but to live it. That your your will, Lord. Your will that's been unwelcome in the earth, unwelcome in homes, unwelcome in governments, unwelcome in people's minds, unwelcome with everywhere. There's been a rebellion for 6,000 years. And his perfect will has been unwelcome. Finally, there's a people that receive his kingdom and they say the prayer by revelation. Thy kingdom come and your will that's not welcome will be welcome in my life. Your word, if it's not welcome in any other place, it'll be welcome in me. It'll be welcome in my home. It'll be welcome in my thoughts. I receive it and I possess it in Jesus name. This is the people that can pray that prayer by revelation. Uh to not only say say it, but to live it. Your kingdom of your word is being pulled from the word and implemented on earth wherever we can establish it in every area of our life. our homes, our churches, our businesses, if we own a business, our domain that God, every place that we can bring his kingdom and his word, our relationships, every place we call upon his will to be on earth as it is in heaven. Praise the Lord. And last Sunday I was drawing a clear distinction about just knowing his kingdom is coming and calling for it, praying for it, pulling it down. When Jesus did the multiplying of fishes and loaves, they wanted to make him a king because they seen his kingdom was coming. They did miracles like that. So they got excited. This is our Messiah. This is our king because he's doing these miracles. The kingdom must be coming to us. But what they didn't realize, it's not in the way they were thinking. and they were thinking his kingdom is coming. I want to draw that distinction. When Jesus did those miracles, they wanted to make him king. And he actually got in a boat and got away from him because it wasn't time yet for him to set up his kingdom as king that way. There was a whole 2,000 years that he would bring his elect Gentiles into this kingdom and they would rule and reign with him. So, it wasn't time. So, but they want they they knew this is something different. this is the kingdom. And they wanted to make him king and he ran away because they seen his kingdom was coming. But they did not want to go deeper than that. Here's my point. People can see that his kingdom is coming. But I think we should desire to go deeper than that. I see a distinction in receiving the kingdom and even deeper than that possessing it. Next week maybe I'll go into Daniel where three or four places in prophecy it says that the saints shall possess the kingdom. It doesn't say they just receive it. It says they'll possess it. They'll take it as their own. This is a possession. This is not just saying nodding your head and saying, "Yeah, I agree. Yes. Yes." This is taking hold of it yourself. When somebody possesses something, they take it as their own. It's mine. If you call and you you hear you've got something down at the pawn shop and you call him and say, "Hey, you know, uh, I've got this. Jesus has paid the price for me. He gave me this gift." You can tell it on the phone all day, but you haven't possessed it yet. You just said, "It's mine. You've claimed it is yours." But you got to get in your car and go down to that before you possess it. When you go in that store, it's been paid for. Jesus paid for it. And now I'm here to possess it. I'm here to take it as my own. And guess what? I'm going to take it home. I'm going to put it in my home. It's going to become a part of my home. Can I get an amen? This message is not just to go to church and nod your head at. It's to take it and possess it and take it home with you. This message is the kingdom of God come to us and we pull that kingdom down into oursel and we establish that in our homes and in our lives. David started the kingdom. And so Saul was anointed. He was anointed the same anointing, but he was the wrong man because God didn't choose him. And later on when he messed up, then God said, "I'll send my prophet again and I'm going to anoint this this young boy." And here he anoints David, that young boy that day. And the prophet anoints him. But the prophet was only part of it. The prophet was only part of it. That was only just a small segment of the process. Once his prophet anointed him, then you enter in the kingdom age. David becomes the king who was a type of Christ. Can you say amen? And guess what? He was anointed, but it wasn't until about 10 or 15 years later. Theologians dispute over this, but it's about 10 to 15 years before David actually took the throne. So, I just want you to look at your lives. You can be anointed by the Holy Ghost, but David had to go through some real learning and hurtful times and Saul trying to kill kill him and all kinds of stuff before he actually took the throne. What are we doing here? Well, we're be we're anointed for the throne. Can you say amen? The Holy Ghost has anoint you for kingship, for for kings and priests. It's to anoint you to the throne. But were you ready when you were first saved? Oh, there's no response. Maybe you were. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. And I'm The very reason I'm still here this morning still shows I'm still not ready. But somebody's making me ready to rule and reign. Somebody's molding my life and he's put people in my life. He's put trials in my life. He's put people that's hurt me. All these other things. Saul, if you haven't been through a Saul, David situation, you probably will eventually because I see that cycle of Saul and David play in churches in this message, in family relationships, in all kinds of things dealing with headship and things. You watch that Saul. And why is it that happens? There's a Saul. There's a David. There's a mistreatment of Saul. There's him holding on to his kingdom. All that plays out. And what was it for? To groom David for the throne. Every trial that is allowed in your life is not just wasted. It's to groom you for the throne. It's that you rule and reign with Christ. Can I get an amen this morning? Don't you devalue any mistreatment that you've received. Don't get bitter about it. Because as Joseph said to his own brothers who put him in a pit and sold him and did all after he recognized the predestinated plan of God, he said, "What you did in evil, God has meant it for good." And guess where it took him? To the throne as a king. He had to go through the brothers persecuting him that way to be ready for the throne. Amen. I see a distinction in actually from receiving it to possessing it to claiming it to owning it. Amen. If you win a prize, you can say call and say it's yours, but it's another thing to possess it and go home, bring it home with you and use it. Can you say amen? This is what's happening is that we receive his kingdom and then we begin to put it to practice in our homes. Matthew 13 and verse 19. When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not, can you imagine this? They hear the word of what? His kingdom and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away. That's what is sown in his heart. Talked about this in the youth meeting at my house Friday night. I had a wonderful discussion on friendship. And if you form the wrong friendships, they always steal something away from you. something will get stolen. And I asked the young people, "What will get stolen?" Well, they knew exactly. If you go in that crowd and hang with that crowd, you're going to lose precious things that you have. And uh it was a tremendous conversation. And so this is what happens is if if you don't move from hearing the kingdom like you are this morning to understanding the kingdom and then embracing the kingdom, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which is sown in his heart. This is he which receiveth seed by the wayside. Verse 20. But he that receiveth seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word. So here's another start. They heard the word of the kingdom, and Aon with joy receiveth it. So their first response is different than the guy that doesn't understand it. And the wicked one steals and catches away what was swn in his heart. This one receives it very good. He's a big amener. Ah, I hear the word of the kingdom. Glory. He might be the biggest shoutter in church. the biggest amener because he receives it with joy. Praise be to God. This is his kingdom being preached to me. And you think this guy's going to go on forever. He's the loudest amener. He shouts all over the building cuz he received this preaching with aon of joy. But look what happens. Yet he hath no root in himself, but endureth for a while. But when tribulation or persecution arises because of that word by and by, he is offended. There's a lot of different categories here, but they're all sitting there hearing the word of the kingdom. His offense become greater than the kingdom. Is anybody listening this morning? people can get a place that their bitterness and their offenses and being offended become greater in their life than the kingdom. And when it does, bitterness comes in. Bitterness comes into families and then they're gone. They're gone. You don't see them. There's a lot of families here. You don't see them again because something happened and their offense or the persecution or the preaching that was correcting them and that become an offense to them and it become greater than the word of the kingdom. There's a big picture here this morning in this service. There's a bigger picture besides this uh uh little bit overweight preacher here and besides what you see in me and all this and looking over and seeing your neighbor. There's a bigger thing that's going on. The kingdom is being preached to us. And at the end of the day, it's about you receiving that kingdom and possessing that kingdom. When you walk out of here, if you don't get that, then everything else is a waste. Can you say amen? Let me finish the scripture because he's not the only one that receives it with joy. Glory. And then he's gone. He's offended. He also, verse 22, that receive seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word of the kingdom, and the care of this world, the worries of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. Here's another guy. All these people receive, all these people hear it. But here's another guy who he gets worried about maybe gets worried about the finances or he gets worried about the worries of this life and it overtakes him and that becomes more important than the kingdom the riches. What how did it the deceitfulness of riches? Oh my god my can it be that this happens that the deceitfulness of riches can choke the very kingdom of the word and something stops and all of a sudden now riches become more important and then they're gone. They're not here because you know why? Riches and the cares of life and those goals become more important than the kingdom. And the family and the children will suffer for it years down the road because why? Daddy wasn't about the kingdom. Daddy fell to the pressure of riches. But he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it, which I believe is a revelation. They got a revelation of it. But look what happens. Which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth. What does that mean? That means the kingdom came in their lives. The word was not just the word. It came into their lives. And you see fruit of the message coming from their life. You see the kingdom in their lives. If I want to see what heaven looks like, if I want to see the atmosphere of heaven and what it looks like, I should be able to see it in people's lives. And let me say that this king of this kingdom, brothers and sisters, never forces you to do what you need to do. He never forces his headship on you. He never forces his rulership over you. Joseph never forced the people to come under his reign in Egypt. They slowly in the famine all begin to come to him, including their brothers, and they all begin to surrender willingly. Joseph, we need your help. You're our king. And that's our king. He never forces anybody to do anything. They come willingly and say, "If this is your kingdom, then I want to see your kingdom in me."
