========================================

hallelujah i'm so glad to be here with you this morning i'm gonna uh let lay a little bit of foundation the word as we start out um i i think you all know that i'm not a lengthy preacher so i'd like to just take a little bit of more time here than usual to set a word foundation we'll be reading here in psalms 91 and psalms 32 and 2nd peter chapter 1. and just as you're turning your bibles there i'd like to say a heartfelt appreciation for your tuning in this morning i know it's one thing to to come here in the congregation and to sit in the church but i think it's even more personal for you to invite me into your homes and i i pray that that's not out of an obligation to a church or out of favor to any man but i i believe that it's your desire to invite jesus christ into your homes this morning and so on behalf of our lord jesus i want to thank you for joining with us and playing the word and giving reverential respect and setting the dishes aside and trying to quiet your children as best as you can i know it's a struggle especially when there's distractions in the home for you with little ones god bless you and we just are going to all do our best this morning brother isaac and brother michael and i will do our very best to preach to you as if you were here with us and we believe that you'll do your best to just receive the word as if you were here with us without the distractions that might surround the home environment but thank you for inviting the lord jesus into your home this morning psalms 91 and verse 5. pardon me we'll just start with verse 5 he says thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestleth pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall by thy sign and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee i think we've heard this verse many times this year as we've turned to psalm 91 for comfort but i don't want to just focus on that verse but if we can go back to verse 1 and look at the scripture here it says it's it's addressing this chapter to a certain kind of man a certain kind of believer it's not just anyone that has these promises but the address the opening address of this scripture is he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i want you to hold that in your hearts this morning as we go along we'll turn over to psalms 32. and brother isaac i'm sorry if we can just get a little bit less in the the high feedback there i'm hearing my s's just a little bit too much and it's distracting me i think with all the bodies we have those sound absorptions but it's a little bit of a difficult technical challenge this morning first time we've dealt with quite this environment in the new sanctuary so you'll just be patient with us as we work through some of the sound issues here psalms 32 and 5. it says i acknowledge my sin and thee and my nicu have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin see again this is the prerequisite to the next verse a man that confesses and acknowledges his sin to the lord gets his whole heart clear before the lord knows that his heart has been forgiven and he says for this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee and a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters those great waters shall not come nigh unto this man in second peter chapter one just to find give a final context to the subject that we'd like to take this morning second peter 1 and verse 19. peter saying here reminding us we have also a more sure word of prophecy where do you do well to take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark day in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar arise in your hearts dear lord we just pray that you'd bless the reading of your word lord as we sit at your feet this morning may you take it and break it to our hearts in jesus christ's name amen for a subject this morning i'd like to take the thought living in a time of certainty living in a time of certainty and you might recall last time we were shut down i i had the the honor and privilege to be able to break the word with you and we we broke it along the lines of finding certainty in uncertain times so if you if you remember that you might be thinking i'm i'm kind of contradicting myself from the last time that we had fellowship together in this way to take a topic of living in a time of certainty but i i believe that there's a different side of it that i just like to take because on one hand these are very uncertain times but if we take the other side of it we're actually living in the most certain time that the gentile church has ever lived and i'd like to look at the positive side of it this morning how many would like to look at the positive side of the word of jesus christ this morning did you know that for the believer there's no there's no side of the gospel that's not positive for the believer it's like our precious brother paul says the future is so bright i have to put sunglasses on just to look at it and we're looking at a gospel we're looking at a word of jesus christ that when when moses looked at the hindu parts of a man it made his face naturally to shine so bright that the children of israel couldn't even look upon them but we're not looking at the hindu parts of a man this morning we're looking at the revealed word of god so on one hand yes we can say these are times of uncertainty like never before man's hearts are failing them for fear it's a time of anxiety more people are on on anxiety pills and medications than ever before it's a it's a billion dollar industry i'm sure it's a time of depression and suicide rates and man trying to find some escape somewhere and even as they try to find some escape the the government braces to allow it they open up the doors for marijuana and open up the doors for drugs because people are looking for an escape somewhere as a society the waves are turning they say whatever it takes i'll let anything into my life i'll let anything into my home just so i can find some sense of relief that's the world that we live in but that's not the world that we're a part of and i want to remind you this morning that the world that we're a part of does not require the solutions of man because god from the foundation of the world has provided a solution for his little bride if shall just take hold of it with all of her heart we're living in a time when man does not know what to believe we listed what we to believe will fluctuate depending on what internet site we go to depending upon what multi-media we partake in depending upon what instagram account we load or depending upon what channel and news source we get our information from and then that result is man's mind is divided the bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and we find that this entire nation is divided and double minded and nobody hardly could be honest and say they certainly know what's going on they might take an opinion here they might take a stand here but there's always some little shadow of a second guessing there's no place for a man to find shorty there's no place for a man to escape the uncertainty there's no place for a man to escape the unstability of double mindedness except for the word of god this morning and that's why i i'm so happy i'm so pleased i'm so excited this morning to be able to preach the only thing that a man can put his feet upon and say i know that i know that i know that i stand upon the rock of ages and from here i shall not be moved i'll be moved from fox news i'll be moved from cnn i'll be moved from politics but there's one thing i cannot be moved from and if i just place my life upon the word of god forget the conspiracy theories forget what man is trying to conceive we know what god conceived from the phone base of the world oh hallelujah i see some brothers and sisters posting on facebook and i know that the times are are wearing on you brother the times are wearing on you sister because i see there's a strain to try to figure out what it is that man's trying to do get your eyes off of that let's get our eyes back on jesus christ looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith you'll wear yourself out trying to figure out what man is trying to do but we live in a certain time where god has made it plain before us he's written the vision playing upon the tables if you'll just look at it and you'll find certainty in the voice of god i believe he'll do that for you this morning all things natural are now uncertain those that had stable jobs we don't know what this next year holds we don't know where our bread might come from we can look back to the previous financial crisis he is 2009 in the economic collapse we know that a bubble happened before that too much optimism too much falseness that was built in the economic system now we look and we see our economy hindered and haltered shut down and yet the stock market continues to rise it's all a farce you can't put confidence in it i can tell you i i can't put confidence in it you you want to be able to make natural decisions but there's no confidence in it we can look back to the 2009 economic collapse and i can say my employer weathered it okay i should be fine for this one but there's never been a time like this one naturally speaking there's no precedent for what we're going through we don't know what will be on the other side of this though biden and politicians and man says peace and safety yet we know that peace and safety is becoming less and less and this world is becoming less stable so as we preached last time all things natural are now uncertain our jobs our finances our own health our family's health you can't be sure about any of that and as we preached last time just some some natural things for you to help with that just the way that we look at the lord and the way that we where we put our confidence we we preached about those things and try to sympathize with the natural state that we're in because we still within this frame we're still a human frame but this morning i like to preach the other side of it i'd like to preach where we're really at spiritually oh i'm gonna need some water for this you're praying for me this morning aren't you praise the lord got my amen bench here brother brother isaac and brother michael i hear those so on the one hand everything is uncertain but on the other hand everything is still certain spiritually speaking as we read in the scripture we've received a more sure word of prophecy we've received something that will hold us through this time i just think about the sure word of prophecy that and down through the church ages how how god in his in his time and in his sovereignty injected himself into the church age through his messenger just exactly what they needed for that age to hold them you look at even down through mark martin luther and then justification then wesley with sanctification and and and pentecostal age starting out here with laodicea and the baptism of the holy ghost and the restoration of the gifts all those things gave them certainty in their time and i i'd like to take a moment and just say there's still certainty for those people i just think about martin luther here he was nailing 95 pieces to a door of a church over 500 years ago talking about the justice the just shall live by faith in a time of uncertainty think about that how uncertain the dark ages were even spiritually speaking the church was selling indulgences that you could buy off your sins and and buy off your mistakes and and buy off that your your perverted nature and you could still find a way to heaven if you could just buy your way into it the church was all offering indulgences and if you couldn't afford the indulgences well i suppose you could do enough penance that that you would somehow earn your way into heaven but during that time of uncertainty god provided a messenger for that day that came and preached that the just shall live by faith that is not by works but salvation is a free gift of god oh hallelujah and there were men and women that grabbed a hold of it in that age and that message of the day saved them hallelujah and i'd like to say this morning that there are still millions of believers around the world millions of those that are holding on to one thing that was preached 500 years ago the just shall live by faith they may not take a rapture with you with just that revelation but there's a promise to them that if they'll hold on to that revelation then they'll see them all the way through a tribulation oh hallelujah you want to see that in the word this morning let's let's take a moment to establish that one turn over to revelations chapter 7 with me i was enjoying this so much last night re-reading it i i gotta share it with you again revelations chapter seven and verse nine here john is seeing the vision and he says after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man can number of all nations and kindred and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hand verse 10 and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb go down to verse 13 and it says and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these things what are these which are rave and white robes and john said well you know he said once came they the man asked him and john said sir thou knowest and the ansel said unto him these are they which came out of the great tribulation and have washed the robes and made them white with the blood of the lamb friends your your friends that might be in a baptist church somewhere and you've been trying to witness this message to them they might be in a methodist church somewhere and you've been trying to witness this message to them and maybe you you're like me where i was out one day and i wanted to know what will be their end if they don't get more revelation from this last day if they don't come along underneath this message of malachi 4 5 and 6 what will be their end here it is you can find your friends in scripture you can find your family members in scripture here's their end revelations 7 15 therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they're not pushed out for his prayer from his presence they're not some lower tier that don't even get to come into the presence of god they're not some way midway between being cast out of the presence of god in hell or but not quite being in his presence for here at the very throne of god and he's dwelling amongst them oh hallelujah that doesn't make you happy this morning friends i i want to say that this message is not something that sets up a religious structure and says you've got to believe what we believe or else you're out this message is jesus christ it is the revelation of god the mighty god unveiled before us the same god that sent his son jesus to this earth that we could not perish but where we could believe on him because he wanted to save the whole world i don't know that we'll know how far this message this jesus christ this great god draws his circle until we get to the other side but he's not a god that draws people out he's a god that draws people into himself i've got friends there in the catholic church this morning and they would probably tell you that unless i come to their way of seeing things but they were honest with their beliefs and told me straight they don't believe there will be salvation for me but i can tell you this morning that i know that for them so long as their faith is in jesus christ for by faith are you saved through christ and their faith is not in the system alone then i believe seeing this scripture that i'll see them there in the presence of the almighty god and that their end is continued and said in verse 16 they'll hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto the living waters oh hallelujah you may not have been able to lead them fully unto the living waters but there is a day coming if they'll just hold on to a revelation that was instructed 500 plus years ago by a faithful messenger martin luther the just shall live by faith if they just hold on to that simple scarlet red thread it'll carry them all the way through and one day the lamb himself shall be able to do what you cannot do for your friends and your family he'll lead them unto the living waters oh think of it friends pause and think of that for a moment but here we have a message that was given 500 years ago and yet today as we face the greatest tribulation this world has ever faced before the great tribulation that's been promised since the very beginning of christendom a 500 year old revelation given underneath a past church age will be strong enough to see them through it oh hallelujah remember brother branham said i never condemn the people that are in the systems but i condemn the systems and it will be that very tribulation that condemns the systems and judges those systems and out of the ashes of that system out of the ashes of that system there will be a people rise just like rahab who was holding on to a scarlet red thread and now the ashes and the rubble of jericho she was preserved there will be a people hallelujah that will rise out of the ashes of tribulation out of the ashes of the baptist system out of the ashes of the methodist system out of the asses of the pentecostal system out of the asses of the catholic system of the ashes of all those things previously believers that were bound by creeds and dogmas will rise free and liberated and they'll be led unto the fountains of living waters by the lamb himself oh friends that makes me joyous this morning that makes me so happy you might say of your family members this morning they're unbelievers total unbelievers and their life is so far removed from what we live it seems like it would be such a long journey to get them from their drinking and their crowsing on and the way they dress and the way they act to what we hold dear here friends remember the first thing is getting them to jesus christ get them to calvary get them to the cross that's never lost its significance brother branham himself said the whole old testament looks towards the cross and the whole new testament looks back towards it we're never beyond the cross friends i'll tell you what if you can't get them to darken the door of a message church don't give up on them don't give up on that unbelieving friend of yours don't give up on that unbeliever that's a family member or what have you just preaching to them like peter did when he met the uh the eunuch there he said he preached unto him jesus just start preaching there friend just start sharing what hope you have in christ start sharing a picture of calvary the here we just came through christmas great time to reflect upon the gospel story that the mighty god came down and revealed himself in a little babe spent his time amongst us took off the layers as it were and showed us who god was and then went to calvary that our sins would be forgiven he would be the perfect sacrifice and arise again in triumph over everything that we find guilt in every sin every abomination every fallen nature you may not be able to get them any further than that friends but get them to that at least it'll it's powerful enough it may seem old-fashioned to some of us but it's powerful enough that though it's 2000 years old and it came and was revitalized in the dark ages still 500 years ago it's powerful enough to get them through a tribulation that we're certainly facing now think of that if you can't get them to darken the doors of a message church get them to darken some old good baptist church somewhere that preaches the word still get them to preach get them to darken the doors of a methodist church that still thumps the bible as it were make sure in getting them there though that you bind their hearts and souls not to that system because it will perish in the tribulation but bind their hearts and souls to calvary if they'll hold fast there no matter what happens the whole thing can fall apart around them just like jericho fell apart around rahab and yet they'll be standing at the last day because the scripture says they'll be dressed there in robes of white oh hallelujah praise the lord remember those people that are in those systems there they're not potential believers they may be blinded by their systems they may be bound by creation dogmas but they're still our brother and our sister and many of them the bible here says millions an untold multitude is what it says could not be numbered we'll be there and we'll get to be able to fellowship with them without creeds and dogmas without the binds and the fetters oh i'm looking forward to the day friends not the day that we can say i was right and you were wrong but we have the day that we can both all sit together in unity as a body of jesus christ oh i hope that picture of the other side brightens your souls this morning amen but we want to preach the other side of it still the certainty of god's word here we have justification that just shall live by faith think of it that message alone that if someone can just tie their souls onto it and hold fast no matter what happens it'll carry them all the way through a tribulation how much more powerful then is a message that was promised from time immemorial even to the time of the prophets that it would be able to dress the bride for a rapture how much more effective how much more powerful is this malachi 4-5 ministry that you are under that your children are under that your grandchildren are under we're living now within a laodicean age surrounded by a lukewarm church with only tribulation laying before her for the lukewarm church the church cardinal that is the only certainty that she has and i might say this the promise is if she can hold fast through that tribulation then she'll be able to be dressed in white but without the seal of god upon her there's still no certainty think of that that they could let go of that revelation that somehow they could be shaken from it that they could be shaken from the revelation of justification when everything starts letting loose they can be shaken from it that's why we don't want to leave people that justification there's no certainty there the only thing that's certain is that they or they will be a tribulation there will be a shaking and if they can hold on if they can be victorious in that time then there's a reward waiting for them at the end but now is the day of your salvation now is the day that god can be found now is the day that god has revealed himself and said there's more of me still there's there's more of me than just justification sanctification there's a seal of god that's waiting to be set upon your forehead if only you'll be obedient to me and follow after my word that's been revealed in this age oh hallelujah that is the certainty that's waiting for the believer that's the certainty that i want friends not the certainty of tribulation not the uncertainty of my job but i want to focus this morning on making sure that my life is standing certain before god hallelujah for in this bright age i'd like to say with confidence this morning that there is no more certain age in all of the church history an age within an age as it were though we're surrounded by the laodicean church age by this message of malachi 4 the bride has been caught up into a special place where she's been presented the certainty of a rapture the certainty of fellowship with her husband the certainty of a wedding shepherd the certainty of a millennial reign and in that certainty if you can just become lost in that certainty all the uncertainty down here at earth will just fade away underneath of your footsteps as you look towards jesus christ and his promises this morning for the laodicean church the lukewarm believer there is no certainty but for the bride those who have yielded themselves to the call that have made sure that their oil is not gone out in their lambs there is a certainty that's waiting for you you might ask me this morning brother josiah how can you say that how can you say that there's no other time in history where things have been more certain it's because today we can look back through this malachi 4-5 ministry and know exactly where we're at the churches in martin luther's time didn't know what church stage they were in the churches in the time of paul were looking towards the coming of the lord they were hoping that it would be soon but now we can look past all the confusion and look back and see the whole plan of god laid out before us through the seven church ages and know positionally exactly where we are at today we know that we are at the threshold of god's great promise of a rapture to wrap up these this gentile church and turn towards israel so i can say there is no more certain time in the church history we know exactly where we're at this morning oh hallelujah amen brother think of that so don't get lost in all the uncertainty that's surrounding you but up here caught up with jesus christ you have a precious certainty not only do we know positionally where the church is at but like never before we know who all the other players are the seven seals have been revealed we know who the white horse rider is we know what his horse is down to the ages the white horse and the black horse and the red horse and the pale horse we know who all the players are we know who the souls underneath the altar are we know who those that are that who go through the tribulation and we know who those are that are caught up with jesus christ we may not be able to point them out on the street but we know who the actors are it's more clear than ever before and more clear than ever before we know the mind of jesus christ hallelujah more than ever before god has revealed himself the very mystery of god has been revealed god has it's no longer as i said it's no longer looking at the hinder parts of a man but through this malachi 4 5 ministry god has revealed himself more plainly than ever before and you can go and you can look upon him like man has never been able to look upon him before we know that who jesus christ is that it's god himself made flesh and the the vehicle or the the vessel that god used to reveal himself to our just not the third person of eternity when we when we pray we're not praying one day to god and one day to god the father and one day to god the son one day to god the holy spirit we know who it is that we're praying to we know who it is that we're serving and we know who it is that's beckoning us to a marriage supper because right now in this present time the bride is making a marriage union with that lord jesus christ she knows who he is she knows that it's god himself she knows that he's the tree of life and she can recognize the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and run from it she knows that he is the one that's sitting upon the throne in revelations she can find him in scripture though he was hidden in scripture all this time she can read from genesis to revelation and find her lover her lord but it's not only that she knows who he is but she knows who she is this bride like never before knows positively who she is as the bride of jesus christ oh hallelujah she knows that she's baptized into his body that she's made one with him for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body the body of the lord jesus christ oh hallelujah she knows that she's a partaker of his spirit that she's in union with him she knows that she's in union with him the word there's no question in her mind who he is or who she's coming into union with because that word has been made plain through this last day message and she's found her identity in this lord jesus christ oh i hope you can say that you are seed this morning friends i hope that you can have that certainty that you found your identity in christ this bride has the opportunity to put off the old man and put on the new jesus christ to take on a new identity that's not defined by her genetics and how she looks naturally and what the kids at school said about her when she was growing up and what evil things she did when she was a young person sowing her wild oats she's not defined by her past she's not defined by what other people did to her that was wrong or mean or harmful she's not defined any longer by her old nature because that old nature that carnal man has been destroyed she's not defined any longer by being four eyes or being fat or too skinny or or not being a good singer or not being good at this or that but she has come into the presence of one who's never done her any harm she has come into the presence of one who tells her there is no spot in you thou art all together beautiful my love oh heavenly lover covers now i pray and he has covered her he's covered her inside a little place like a tent where it's pushed out all the other lovers of her past life it's pushed out all the naysayers it's pushed out all the denominational sisters that maybe spit in her eye it's pushed out all the kids at school that said the mean things to her it's pushed out the voice the boss at work it's pushed out every single distraction she's come into the presence of one one person who matters more to her than any other and she has laid aside everything for this one lord jesus christ and he came and revealed herself himself to her got down on one knee as it were and propose to her would you take my token the god of all mankind making himself vulnerable to a gentile bride and asking her would you come and be my bride and take this token and this woman she's accepted it oh hallelujah i hope i'm talking about you this morning she's accepted a token of the holy ghost a seal hallelujah she's accepted a seal she's not holding on to just a revelation of justification where if she can just hold on long enough it'll bring her all the way through the tribulation but seas received the seal of god wherein god will say no no you can't touch this oil you can't touch this wine you can't touch this precious bride i'm taking her out of here coronavirus might surround her it might even rack her physical flesh but she will not be a partaker of this tribulation she will not have to go through it and she will not have to feel her fear for her soul because she has come into my presence and she has received me as i am and i have received her as she was from the foundation of the world and your identity friend as a bride is no longer dictated by what happened on this earth but how god saw you from the foundation the world and if you can't identify with with that this morning i want to invite you i want to invite you to come up from this cosmos this morning and choose not just faith over unbelief not just faith over fear but i want you to choose this morning to have certainty instead of uncertainty before you this morning for before some of you there lays before you still yet the choice of whom you will serve the devil and his pleasures offer certain pleasure like a flash in the pan but after that is certain death but god is here offering his blood and his holy spirit life eternal what will you choose in an age of uncertainty choose now to live in a time of certainty with jesus christ with a certain salvation and a certain relationship do you know that there's never been a time like this time the bride knew exactly who she was in relation to god sure down through time we understood that there was a bride down through time i believe that there were those that recognized that they were members of this bride but there was never a time when the bride stood so certain of her relationship with jesus christ because you cannot stand certain of a man until you know fully who he is and there's never been a time like this time that god has so mightily revealed himself through jesus christ that the bride stands certain of her lover and like never before that certainty of the man that has invited her to take the wedding token of the holy ghost by having that certainty she stands even more certain of herself because he is her headship and her covering and when a woman is certain of her husband and that man is in his place she is sure more certain of herself there's never been a time of certainty like today hallelujah oh just let's praise the lord for a minute that we could stand in times of uncertainty when the newspapers are filled with headlines like grim and all sorts of of words that paint a dark picture we can stand forth in a little room off to the side with our lover and say i don't know anything about it i just know one thing and that's my lord jesus christ i'm staring into his face and he's staring into mine and one day all this is just going to disappear but i'm not paying it any mind in the meantime he's provided a hiding place like our scripture at the beginning in psalms 91 said he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty it is a secret place but he's invited you to it this morning he invited you to it when he began to break forth the seals and began to preach forth a message through a last-day messenger he said come come away my little bride oh hallelujah come away with me the words of solomon come back to me take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vine let's deal with those now friends we don't want this precious relationship with jesus christ to be spoiled but let's enjoy it while the world is falling apart let's enjoy the certainty of the relationship of this hiding place that he's invited us to he's invited us underneath his cloak and he's made himself fully plain to us he's put himself in plain sight now the devil has been busy and where i look at jesus christ i can say off over here is the plainest picture of jesus christ that has ever been painted through the church ages or through all of time but between me and him and him satan has put up a lot of decoys and distractions to obfuscate your vision if you're having a hard time seeing jesus christ can i just encourage you start drawing towards him there's the picture of jesus christ there's a decoy here and a distraction over here just push it all aside get through there the bible says that if you'll draw an eye unto me i'll draw an eye unto you it's not just a picture of jesus christ on a wall that you've got to get to but it's a person of jesus christ if you draw an eye to him and push past all those distractions push past all that confusion push past all those decoys you'll find he's doing the same on his side he wants to be in relationship with you this morning friends maybe you feel like you've become distant from him for whatever reason i i don't know maybe because you've been distant from the church itself distant from the body distant from your bible i want to tell you this morning start pushing past it all because just beyond that false mirage of distance stands a very near jesus christ he says i am near to you a very present help in the time of need oh hallelujah there's a god standing near you it's like a false mirage like a little painting that satan's put out here makes him look way far away but if you just push past it you'll find that god standing right there you might have to push past a little bit of sin push past a little bit of iniquity like the psalmist and psalm 32 said i had to admit my mistakes i had to admit my iniquity but on the other side of that i found a very present god that promised me that these waters will not come nigh unto me oh friend don't let satan's mirage for you you might have said oh i i'm months out of the presence of god it'll feels like months to get back into his presence that's nothing but a lie of the enemy this morning he is just a call away a phone call away if i can say the bible says that if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray i will hear from heaven and i'll come and heal their land i'm a very present help in time of need don't live in a time of uncertainty when there is a time of certainty available to you amen let's go before the lord dear lord i just come before you father thanking you so much lord for a time of certainty thanking you so much lord for making yourself so plain in this last day lord that we couldn't miss it lord so plain that we couldn't miss it but yet satan's been busy he's put up a lot of decoys i pray lord if there's anyone that feels like they're missing the revelation of jesus christ that they're missing out on a relationship with you that they're missing out on having certainty of their salvation certainty of their position with you certainly of knowing who they are and where they're going and where they came from and who you are oh lord i pray that you would fill them with certainty this morning lord not just a feeling lord but by a revelation as they draw an eye to you and you draw nigh to them this morning granite lord we pray in jesus christ's name lord in jesus name we thank you lord amen praise the lord praise the lord brother michael plays something softly i encourage you to think about what's been preached this morning [Music] i encourage you to remember that this message is not something that draws people out but it draws people in and it's god's grace to you this morning that's trying to draw you closer god has not cast you off this morning but god has given you a hiding place in him enjoy it if you're not enjoying it then go find it it's not hidden it's hidden from the world but it's not hidden from you little bride god has given you a way of escape from this world of uncertainty a pathway into his presence and their certainty and security await his little bride god bless you now friends pray you would enjoy your sunday let's worship the
