[1:41] going to touch on that a little bit uh
[1:43] today and just um FYI this is part of a
[1:47] pretty lengthy series and um I intend to
[1:50] do the whole series today
[1:56] huh
[1:58] nah
[1:59] um I I
[2:00] promise that I won't do that
[2:04] um I can't promise much else but I can
[2:06] promise that so um I uh yes so just to
[2:10] fill in what brother Paul mentioned um
[2:12] our house listed
[2:14] um yesterday in in Des Moines we had the
[2:18] photos taken on on Thursday
[2:21] and it's been a hectic miserable couple
[2:26] of months getting the place cleaned out
[2:30] um you know for photos and for for
[2:32] viewing
[2:35] um so yeah pray pray for us uh Kathy's
[2:38] really not doing well with some uh joint
[2:41] hip problems and so forth quite a bit of
[2:43] pain and so please remember her in
[2:46] prayer as well
[2:47] um obviously
[2:49] um
[2:50] you know made worse by all the
[2:52] activities of this past few weeks
[2:55] um the we were very very fortunate we
[2:58] got some good help to come and assist
[3:01] and so that was that was nice
[3:05] um
[3:07] um but yeah it's going to be a trying
[3:09] couple of couple of weeks
[3:12] um and one of the things that just
[3:13] happened this morning that is a little
[3:16] bit trying is the house listed yesterday
[3:18] and I sent a message to the uh the agent
[3:23] that's working with us very reputable
[3:25] guy and can highly recommended by some
[3:28] friends and I said um and he said
[3:31] something about I don't remember and I
[3:35] said no viewings on Sunday leave us
[3:37] alone on Sunday and that especially goes
[3:40] for tomorrow because I'm not there
[3:42] Kathy's not well I gave him the reasons
[3:44] and I said you know let's start on
[3:46] Monday because
[3:48] yes they they we hope there will be a
[3:51] fair demand so I get an email a few
[3:53] minutes ago is three o'clock today going
[3:56] to work for you
[3:59] I didn't even bother to reply so
[4:02] so anyway
[4:04] um so these are the kind of challenges
[4:06] that we're going to face
[4:08] um going forward so we'll really
[4:11] appreciate your prayers and if anybody
[4:14] hears of a of a double wide going in
[4:17] intoledo area let us know
[4:21] uh Kathy's not going to settle for that
[4:23] I can assure you
[4:25] um but if you do hear of a property that
[4:28] you think we might be interested in
[4:29] please please let us know
[4:32] um it's very very difficult to find
[4:34] suitable properties in this area there
[4:36] was one I was going to look at this
[4:38] afternoon and they got an offer
[4:41] yesterday
[4:42] which is how it goes they've only listed
[4:44] on Thursday I think or Wednesday so if
[4:47] things are going very quickly
[4:49] um and then also had a bit of difficulty
[4:52] getting
[4:53] what they call a pre-qual or something
[4:56] and that was a little bit of a challenge
[4:59] because as you know I'm self-employed
[5:02] now and they don't really like that so
[5:04] we'll be uh earnestly coveting your
[5:08] prayers on a whole range of topics so
[5:13] please don't feel that you have to limit
[5:16] it to the Sweet Hour of Prayer you can
[5:18] go a little bit longer so I uh I I know
[5:23] there's there's a lot of prayer going on
[5:26] at the moment and I thank those who are
[5:28] already praying and then of course I
[5:30] can't neglect to mention
[5:33] um brother Solomon
[5:36] wow there's a step
[5:41] and I can congratulate you brother
[5:45] because the you know you you you have
[5:48] the taste uh in this uh setup sister
[5:52] Lily hmm
[5:55] But congratulations uh really uh it's a
[6:00] delight to to see and that's another one
[6:02] that are you know watched growing up so
[6:05] it's fun so we're ready for the word of
[6:07] God this morning let's stand and uh
[6:10] let's approach his throne I so much
[6:12] enjoyed the song
[6:14] of its
[6:25] just a little emotional
[6:31] the Lamb of God
[6:35] thanks brother Chuck
[6:37] all right
[6:39] let's open our bubbles turn to First
[6:42] Timothy chapter 3 verse 16.
[6:46] and you you all know
[6:49] that sometimes uh the way these Bible
[6:52] verses were constructed obviously that's
[6:54] not you know they didn't write the
[6:56] verses this way but uh that's how
[6:59] um they organized it to make it easier
[7:01] uh to read and to reference and so forth
[7:04] but the three sixteens are quite amazing
[7:08] in scripture you obviously John 3 16 but
[7:10] when you come across a 360 pay a little
[7:13] bit more attention to it because there
[7:15] could be something really you know
[7:17] interesting because it's 360 14 7.
[7:21] that's another one 714 that's another
[7:24] one you can see you know
[7:26] um uh in the in it shall be light in the
[7:29] evening time that's fourteen seven you
[7:31] know so these uh these verses um somehow
[7:34] were inspired the way they they're built
[7:36] so whenever I see a 316 my eye sort of
[7:39] just stops and okay you know it's like
[7:42] somebody's saying pay attention uh so um
[7:44] this is one of those and without con
[7:49] so I have the wrong 316. it's uh Second
[7:53] Timothy 3 16.
[7:56] yes
[7:58] oh
[7:59] I told you I was nervous
[8:01] all right second Timothy 3 16 all
[8:05] scripture and I just want you to to
[8:07] concentrate in a little three-letter
[8:09] word all
[8:10] you know that doesn't mean only the
[8:12] parts of and the land
[8:14] you know uh it means all I mean brother
[8:17] Brandon says we can find Jesus from
[8:18] Genesis to Revelation he means every
[8:21] word
[8:22] that proceeds from the mouth of God you
[8:24] you're getting the picture right and
[8:25] this is going to be something that I'll
[8:27] I'll pick up again right at the end but
[8:29] I want you to notice all scripture is
[8:32] given by inspiration of God and is
[8:34] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[8:36] correction
[8:38] for instruction in righteousness so what
[8:42] this tells me is I used to be a a
[8:45] teacher College teacher and um I was an
[8:48] instructor and instructed and what you
[8:51] know is that when you're instructing
[8:53] somebody it's because they don't know
[8:55] what you're telling them if they knew
[8:58] what you were telling them you wouldn't
[8:59] need instruction all right so this is
[9:02] Construction in righteousness what what
[9:04] does that tell us it doesn't come
[9:07] naturally right this isn't a normal
[9:09] state in our foreign condition
[9:12] righteousness we need to be instructed
[9:15] in righteousness and it says all
[9:18] scripture is given for that point now if
[9:20] you'll turn with me just to
[9:22] um let me see if I get this one right
[9:24] this time first uh First Corinthians and
[9:28] I believe it's uh it's 15 verse 46.
[9:33] and you might think my memory is really
[9:36] amazing but I just wrote it down a
[9:37] minute ago so you'd think I'd remember
[9:39] all right First Corinthians chapter 15
[9:42] verse 46.
[9:47] um yeah let's read from 46 and I better
[9:49] put my glasses on uh how be it that was
[9:53] not first which is spiritual
[9:55] but that which is natural and afterward
[9:58] that which is spiritual the first man is
[10:00] of the earth earthy the second man is
[10:03] the Lord From Heaven as the as is the
[10:06] earthy such are they also that are
[10:09] earthy and as is the Heavenly such are
[10:11] they also that are Heavenly and as we
[10:14] have borne in the image of the earthy we
[10:17] shall also bear the image of the
[10:20] heavenly
[10:21] amen so let's bow our heads say a word
[10:24] of Prayer
[10:27] our heavenly father
[10:29] Lamb of God
[10:31] we just appreciate this role this office
[10:35] that you occupy in our lives at this
[10:38] time as the lamb
[10:41] that was deemed worthy to take the book
[10:45] and to redeem us and Lord we we feel
[10:50] that we feel that every day we we feel
[10:53] the need for that every day we need the
[10:57] cleansing of your blood
[10:58] we need the the comfort of knowing that
[11:02] you undertook before the foundation of
[11:05] the world to have a sacrifice that we
[11:09] could rely on today
[11:10] and so Lord Jesus we just pray that as
[11:14] your as your bride as your your body
[11:17] this morning that Lord you would let
[11:19] your life
[11:21] be manifest in US you would let your
[11:23] life flow through US Lord that we would
[11:26] indeed bear the image of the Heavenly
[11:28] and so lord it's our prayer that each
[11:31] one would would receive what they have
[11:34] need of today Lord and bless my wife at
[11:37] home and Heather and and and each one
[11:39] Lord that is watching online we just
[11:42] pray that they too Lord would we
[11:44] inspired they would feel your presence
[11:46] and that your word would speak to them
[11:48] again this morning we ask it in Jesus
[11:51] name amen you may be seated
[11:55] now just while we were singing that song
[11:57] and you know I just asked brother
[11:58] Michael a few minutes before service and
[12:00] uh I'm so amazed at the musicians here
[12:04] they can pull things off at a moment's
[12:06] notice but I really enjoyed that so it
[12:08] was um it I loved that but it did give
[12:11] me a little inspiration for reverse I
[12:13] wanted to mention and this is all by way
[12:15] of background and by the way this wasn't
[12:18] in my notes so you know you're getting a
[12:20] bonus
[12:22] um Romans chapter 1.
[12:24] uh and uh you know this verse very well
[12:27] but I want to just spend a few minutes
[12:29] on it Romans chapter 1 and verse 10.
[12:33] you know there's some verses that are
[12:36] good to memorize for
[12:38] um comfort
[12:39] uh for
[12:41] um uh faith
[12:44] um you know a word in the time of need
[12:48] and sometimes that's helpful if you have
[12:50] that verse at hand no weapon formed
[12:53] against me can prosper you know we just
[12:57] need those those those scriptures at
[13:00] times just to to speak to to speak to
[13:02] our need at that particular moment and
[13:05] for some reason the way I'm built
[13:08] um not physically this verse means a lot
[13:12] to me and it always has ever since I
[13:14] first read it so we're going to read it
[13:16] together and I'm going to go through it
[13:18] once and then quickly uh step back into
[13:21] it for the invisible things
[13:24] of him from the creation of the world
[13:28] are clearly seen
[13:30] clearly seen
[13:33] you know we talk about through a glass
[13:35] Darkly and we you know then we'll see
[13:38] him face to face but he's given us
[13:41] in this world something that isn't a
[13:45] mystery it isn't disguised it's
[13:48] absolutely plain
[13:49] clearly seen
[13:54] being understood by the things that are
[13:57] made manifested things that are created
[14:00] he says from the creation so we're
[14:02] talking about natural things
[14:05] even his eternal power and godhead
[14:09] so that they are with that excuse now
[14:11] the reason this verse
[14:14] comes to mind quite a bit is because we
[14:18] we often have to discuss the Goddard
[14:20] and if you've ever had the opportunity
[14:22] to share the godded with somebody
[14:26] after a couple of minutes of discussion
[14:29] it's interesting how they this is just
[14:32] an interesting observation of mine over
[14:34] all these years
[14:35] is they
[14:38] they will say they understand the
[14:40] godhead you know they understand the
[14:42] Trinity they know how that works they've
[14:44] got the little triangle diagram you know
[14:46] embedded in their mind and they've got
[14:48] it down and they'll be happy to share
[14:50] that with you
[14:52] um but as soon as you start to
[14:56] uh quit that diagram specifically
[14:59] they'll go oh you know it's a mystery
[15:02] right
[15:03] it's like well two minutes ago it wasn't
[15:05] a mystery two minutes ago you were happy
[15:07] to explain it to me but now it's a
[15:10] mystery
[15:11] and of course that was that verse that
[15:13] we touched on a minute ago first Timothy
[15:15] 3 16. you know
[15:18] great is the mystery of godliness
[15:21] all right and they say you see it's a
[15:23] great mystery
[15:25] I said that's the problem with the
[15:27] public school education
[15:29] that's not what it says
[15:32] it's not a great mystery it's uh it's uh
[15:36] great is the mystery wonderful amazing
[15:40] is this mystery of the godded it's not a
[15:43] it's not a mystery because he goes on
[15:45] this God was manifest in the flesh
[15:48] so so much for the mystery all right so
[15:52] and and that's the that's what this
[15:55] verse is telling us
[15:57] is that we can understand the godhead
[16:00] just by looking at was made now you say
[16:03] okay well what was made uh whoa we're
[16:06] gonna be here all day brother Paul I'm
[16:08] gonna have to go back to the the the the
[16:10] the the the nodes
[16:12] but I just want to mention what do you
[16:16] see every morning when you step outside
[16:19] on a cloudless day
[16:22] the Sun
[16:24] and how many of you know that if you see
[16:27] three sons you need to get some
[16:30] correction
[16:33] because if they're three sons you may
[16:37] have been indulging in something too
[16:39] much
[16:41] because we know there's only one son
[16:45] there's only one light of the world
[16:49] there's only one source of life
[16:52] that comes from the energy of the Sun
[16:57] and the Bible says that he is the s-u-n
[17:02] of righteousness and he or as with
[17:04] healing in his wings
[17:06] so
[17:07] can you see how he says it's clearly
[17:10] seen the other one is there's many
[17:12] religions in the world
[17:15] um especially the Eastern mysticism
[17:17] that's so popular
[17:18] all right
[17:20] and you know how they get around the
[17:22] resurrection problem the sort of laugh
[17:25] after death issue they claim you come
[17:28] back again in some other form
[17:29] reincarnation that's their way of trying
[17:33] to explain
[17:34] life after death
[17:37] the only problem is there's nothing in
[17:40] nature that works that way
[17:43] you don't a goat doesn't die if you're
[17:46] in your uh in your your
[17:50] yard or wherever the goat lives and come
[17:54] back as a sheep
[17:55] all right or come back as a cow so he
[17:58] dies you bury him and you don't have an
[18:00] extra cow the next day all right
[18:03] because that's not natural
[18:07] and so when when the Bible says that
[18:09] these things even his eternal power in
[18:12] Godhead are clearly seen by the things
[18:15] that are made
[18:16] we can go oh you plant a potato
[18:21] and my goodness more potatoes come out
[18:24] of that have you ever dug up a potato
[18:26] after it's been in the ground for about
[18:28] a week
[18:29] it looks a little squishy and it's
[18:33] rotten
[18:34] and out of that rottenness is coming
[18:36] this beautiful green shoot of life
[18:39] that's the gospel
[18:43] though I were dead
[18:45] all right I'll live again and that's
[18:48] what we hold on to that's fundamental to
[18:51] our faith
[18:52] clearly seen in nature
[18:55] and so much so that Jesus uses it an
[18:57] example unless the corner we'd Fallen at
[18:59] the ground abides alone so can you see
[19:01] even all the Parables that Jesus uses
[19:04] the natural typing the spiritual so I
[19:07] know this is common for everybody uh
[19:09] mostly here I would imagine but I just
[19:11] wanted you to see the connection between
[19:13] that and witnessing and being able to
[19:16] express your faith in in a way that
[19:19] doesn't require any interpretation I've
[19:23] had people say brother that's your
[19:25] interpretation
[19:27] I'll say well actually that's the
[19:30] interpretation of nature
[19:32] that's what nature is teaching me now if
[19:34] you've got a different explanation for
[19:36] how a rotten potato becomes a whole crop
[19:39] of new potatoes I'm anxious to hear
[19:41] about it
[19:43] because it's clearly seen
[19:46] so we're going to go back in that verse
[19:48] for a minute for the invisible things of
[19:51] him from the creation so when we talk
[19:54] about a seed Gene of God
[19:56] and you can see the little dnas up there
[19:58] right so you know what I'm talking about
[20:00] when you see when we understand that
[20:03] seed Gene that's been placed in us from
[20:06] the foundation of the world that little
[20:07] piece of God
[20:09] that all of us together make up the
[20:13] Human Side Of God how many know that God
[20:15] has a human side manifested in Jesus
[20:19] all right and all the Believers that
[20:21] came after him the human beings that
[20:23] would have his life in them that makes
[20:26] God a deity but with a human capacity or
[20:31] a human portion of it those are the
[20:33] invisible things of him from the very
[20:36] beginning from the creation that are
[20:38] clearly seen by the things that are made
[20:40] and obviously that's you and I
[20:42] all right ultimately but I think it
[20:45] Amplified
[20:47] not always the most accurate text but in
[20:49] this case it does give us a good word
[20:52] the invisible things it translates as
[20:55] the attributes
[20:58] the the hidden attributes the attributes
[21:01] of from him you know these uh invisible
[21:05] things are attributes and that's
[21:08] wonderful because and I'm going to go
[21:10] through this quickly and then I promise
[21:11] I'll get on to this lady
[21:13] so um if you're an artist or a musician
[21:15] brother Kenny by the way I'm wearing
[21:17] socks in your honor today if you care to
[21:19] take a look I can show you after the
[21:21] service
[21:22] um
[21:23] but if you're a musician
[21:26] and you start to plan brother Brennan
[21:28] uses this analogy if you have the spirit
[21:30] of Mozart you know you would write and
[21:32] play like Mozart compose and and play
[21:35] like Mozart
[21:37] so
[21:40] if you're a musician or an artist or
[21:42] anything expressive like that there's
[21:45] something in you
[21:47] that has to be revealed it has to come
[21:50] out if you're a writer anything like
[21:53] that that has a spiritual component to
[21:56] it and are you mechanically minded or
[21:58] something you know you just can't help
[22:00] yourself it's a trait it's something
[22:02] that it's just it's in you to do those
[22:05] things all right that's an attribute in
[22:08] in the context that we're talking about
[22:10] now
[22:11] so God had attributes within him
[22:15] that were you and I
[22:16] so there was something in God that
[22:20] prompts him
[22:21] to express those attributes all right he
[22:24] wants to express that attribute and that
[22:27] attribute happens to be you
[22:30] all right so how does it come about well
[22:33] that attribute just like an artist or a
[22:35] musician he he will do something in
[22:38] order to express that attribute now you
[22:40] and I can't see the attribute but as
[22:42] soon as brother Kenny sits down at the
[22:43] piano
[22:44] we see the attribute
[22:46] the manifestation of it all right it
[22:49] starts to manifest itself and it pleases
[22:51] us and it it blesses us and and so
[22:54] there's a connection there that God
[22:56] intended for that to happen so this is
[22:59] the important thing the attribute gives
[23:01] rise to the thought
[23:03] the thought is the father of the word
[23:06] you can't say something without thinking
[23:09] about it so the thought is the father of
[23:12] the word that's spoken and then the
[23:15] spoken word becomes manifested
[23:18] and now guess what because God's cycle
[23:22] or Circle
[23:24] is absolutely perfect there's no
[23:28] diminishing of
[23:30] the attribute through the progression
[23:34] so that original attribute in God's mind
[23:38] becomes a thought
[23:39] the logos the thought becomes a word
[23:43] the word becomes manifest and that
[23:46] manifestation is what we read about the
[23:49] image of the heavenly
[23:51] so that means that we have that
[23:55] attribute within us that was in God
[23:58] because there's no change over the
[24:01] course if you if you copy something it
[24:03] gets worse and worse but God copies it
[24:06] it's perfect all the way through so you
[24:08] and I are living attributes of God
[24:11] those attributes that were hidden away
[24:13] in God are now clearly seen right here
[24:17] in front of me today
[24:18] I clearly see you and you were an
[24:21] attribute in the mind of God that's
[24:24] that's what this verse teaches me and
[24:26] it's the godhead so where does that
[24:29] place us it places us right there in the
[24:32] godhead because the Bible says our names
[24:34] are written in the Lambs if we for the
[24:36] foundation of the world
[24:40] all right let's get started so that kind
[24:43] of is the background that I wanted to
[24:46] share with you because I'm going to talk
[24:48] a little bit about DNA
[24:51] and I'm no expert on the subject please
[24:53] anybody who knows about this don't come
[24:55] and ask me about it afterwards I'll just
[24:58] refer you to the slides
[25:00] um
[25:01] but I do understand the principle so
[25:04] we're going to um
[25:07] look at this uh let's see if I've got
[25:09] the right verse up I'm sorry oh
[25:13] my mouse is a bit sticky all right here
[25:16] we go
[25:19] so let's uh what I'm going to talk about
[25:21] this morning is what we started on last
[25:24] time and that was the connection
[25:27] uh the links if you like between the old
[25:30] and the New Testament so last time we
[25:32] talked about it in terms of an arch and
[25:35] brother Brennan talks about a keystone
[25:36] so it's sometimes helpful to understand
[25:40] what if I may say is in the back of his
[25:43] mind when he uses the word Keystone and
[25:46] and there's a particular architect thing
[25:48] called the Keystone that was very common
[25:51] throughout recorded history all the
[25:54] examples in archeology and so forth you
[25:56] see an arch different shapes but they're
[25:59] held together with this Keystone that
[26:01] has both sides press against it it's
[26:04] self-supporting so you build it up with
[26:06] a scaffold but then you can take the
[26:08] scaffold away once you put the Keystone
[26:10] in and obviously Jesus is that Keystone
[26:12] and what I said last time was that the
[26:15] the bricks going up on this Arch would
[26:17] be the Old Testament or if you from your
[26:20] side this would be the Old Testament
[26:21] then you would have the New Testament
[26:24] and in between holding the two things
[26:26] together is Jesus all right so we talked
[26:30] about that now I'm going to talk about
[26:31] it in terms of DNA same principle
[26:34] nothing new
[26:35] but I think you'll I think you'll find
[26:38] it very interesting I certainly did
[26:42] so as you look at Hebrews chapter 9
[26:43] verse 15 and for this cause he is the
[26:46] mediator
[26:48] he's between
[26:49] the of the New Testament that by means
[26:53] of death
[26:54] for the Redemption of the transgressions
[26:56] that were under the first testament or
[26:59] the Old Testament if you like they which
[27:01] are called might receive the promise of
[27:04] Eternal inheritance so what we're going
[27:07] to find is that this link between the
[27:09] old and the New Testament
[27:11] act a part of the promise
[27:15] of our eternal life so
[27:18] far from ignoring one of the if you go
[27:21] to some places they'll tell you oh the
[27:22] Old Testament you know you don't worry
[27:24] about that but you know what would
[27:25] happen to that Arch if you took away the
[27:27] Old Testament all right it just fall
[27:29] down so that's the that's the concept
[27:32] that we're going to look at today you
[27:33] have to have both
[27:35] and there has to be a way to connect
[27:38] them both and so you can probably see
[27:41] where I'm going John chapter 6 verse 63
[27:44] the words
[27:46] the words that are speaking to you they
[27:48] are Spirit
[27:49] thought
[27:50] first
[27:52] and they are life
[27:54] all right so spirit and life are
[27:56] synonymous words why does he mention
[27:58] them both he could just say life he
[28:00] could just say Spirit but now he's
[28:01] saying both
[28:03] and why is that it's because the the
[28:05] spirit is the Unseen part the life is
[28:08] what gets expressed
[28:11] all right
[28:13] now if this was class I'd be asking
[28:16] everybody if they had any questions
[28:19] but I'm not going to do that I've
[28:21] learned my lesson
[28:22] [Laughter]
[28:26] so what we know about this word life
[28:29] is that it can be used literally as you
[28:33] see here on your screen or figure it
[28:35] what's wrong
[28:39] the battery
[28:43] oh sure yep
[28:59] that we don't really know the way we
[29:02] ought to and and this might be one of
[29:04] those things brother that seems that's
[29:06] fine that's fine so and that's that's
[29:09] the idea that this word life can be used
[29:13] figuratively or literally literally in
[29:17] the sense of Romans chapter 1 verse 10
[29:19] that the the life that is expressed we
[29:22] see that that's physical but there's the
[29:25] spirit behind the life
[29:27] and that's the invisible part now up
[29:30] until 1956 or 55 uh DN DNA was invisible
[29:36] all right so they first discovered that
[29:38] in 1850 I said I meant 1855 somewhere
[29:43] around there they uh first um identified
[29:46] the fact that there was this molecule
[29:48] that they call DNA now most of you'll
[29:51] remember Francis Crick
[29:54] um the uh the the the scientist said won
[29:56] the Nobel Prize and I believe it was uh
[29:59] 1955 1955. but what they won the real
[30:03] price was not discovering DNA but was
[30:06] from
[30:08] um finding out or uh probably through
[30:12] electron microscope technology that it
[30:15] was a twisted strand like you saw in the
[30:17] picture you're all familiar with that
[30:19] familiar shape right and that's what
[30:21] they got the Nobel Prize for was
[30:22] recognizing this really weird shape to a
[30:25] to the molecule but it was interesting
[30:28] that it was in the 1950s
[30:30] that they discovered that because
[30:33] there's um there's a mystery in how life
[30:37] works
[30:39] so Zoe God's life but how does it work
[30:43] and how does it work in US basically it
[30:46] works through the word and that's the
[30:49] words that I speak unto you all right so
[30:51] brother Branham says this and contending
[30:53] for the faith
[30:55] Jesus said except a man be born again
[30:57] you cannot see the kingdom you can't
[30:58] understand it it's mystical
[31:02] it's a mythical thing
[31:05] until you're born again mythical meaning
[31:07] it's like a fairy story yeah yeah yeah
[31:09] whatever you know I didn't get it
[31:11] mythical
[31:13] until you're born again
[31:15] and then it's like I Saw the Light
[31:18] yes oh what happened who put that there
[31:21] you know things you never saw before you
[31:24] see because now that life is being
[31:26] expressed through you and your eyes are
[31:28] open all right so when until you're born
[31:31] again there the very life of God comes
[31:36] in you Everlasting
[31:38] eternal life Zoe the Greek word
[31:41] so there's something mystical there's
[31:45] something mythical about this concept of
[31:48] life that hopefully we can unravel a
[31:52] little bit by looking at this mysterious
[31:54] DNA
[31:56] so
[31:58] a couple of fun facts human beings look
[32:01] different but 99 of their DNA is the
[32:04] same
[32:05] and here's a fascinating thing about the
[32:08] size of this DNA molecule if you
[32:12] stretched out all the DNA in your body
[32:15] end to end but
[32:18] join them all together because they're
[32:20] all little separate molecules but you
[32:21] join them all together you'd go all the
[32:24] way to Pluto
[32:25] and then you'd have to come back again
[32:27] before you'd get to the end of that line
[32:30] of DNA
[32:32] it's a little bit beyond us right none
[32:35] of us have been to Pluto I don't think
[32:36] so it's it's a little bit hard to
[32:39] picture
[32:40] three billion miles
[32:43] of a molecule in One Direction
[32:45] and then three billion miles coming back
[32:48] in order for you to understand how much
[32:51] of this DNA is in US
[32:53] so when we think of the life of God in
[32:56] us
[32:57] this uh is a natural
[33:01] example of the supernatural
[33:04] because this is what it looks like in
[33:07] the Supernatural times a million all
[33:10] right to Infinity to have eternal life
[33:12] in you
[33:15] so we don't really fully appreciate what
[33:19] it means to have the life of God in us
[33:22] is life his nature his ability his Joy
[33:27] his peace
[33:30] these are attributes of God that are
[33:33] being expressed in us when we have this
[33:36] life in Us and how do we get this life
[33:39] we get it through the word but that word
[33:42] we wouldn't be born again if there
[33:45] hadn't been a connection between the Old
[33:48] Testament and the New Testament a way to
[33:50] instruct Us in righteousness doesn't
[33:53] come naturally
[33:54] so
[33:56] um afterwards there will be a quiz I'll
[33:57] be standing at the door and some people
[33:59] want to shake my hand I'm going to ask
[34:00] them to pronounce
[34:03] dioxy Rabino nucleic acid
[34:07] all right and there'll be a test so
[34:08] please be practicing it
[34:11] um quietly under your breath
[34:13] and that's the pronunciation there for
[34:15] those that have struggled with my accent
[34:17] d o d o c ribo nucleic acid
[34:25] all right
[34:26] okay you all got it that's wonderful
[34:29] the interesting thing about this word
[34:31] and I'm not going to do it now but it
[34:34] has some divisions that actually are
[34:37] interesting Dio sometimes used for God
[34:40] oxy life rope like the rib taken from
[34:44] Adam uh nucleic meaning the nucleus or
[34:48] Genesis and it ends in ic
[34:51] all right so hopefully by the end of
[34:54] this
[34:55] you can you can say
[34:58] that you see all right so what it is
[35:01] briefly DNA is the genetic information
[35:04] inside the body cells that makes people
[35:07] who they are
[35:09] now by the way I copied that from a
[35:11] reference to explain DNA to kids and I
[35:15] just love that makes it helps make
[35:18] people who they are
[35:20] and that's exactly what the word is
[35:22] doing it's who you really are
[35:25] it's instruction in righteousness where
[35:28] we have the righteousness of God in
[35:30] Christ it's as if we never sinned and it
[35:34] makes us who we are so it's not
[35:36] something that we're creating we're
[35:39] doing we can't do anything to make our
[35:42] DNA different we are who we are and
[35:45] spiritually we are who we are so this is
[35:48] uh also called the program of life it's
[35:51] sometimes called the language of life if
[35:53] you understand computer programming this
[35:55] is the code
[35:57] this is the the code that is that tells
[36:01] uh cells what to do and when to do it so
[36:04] as a cell is multiplying and growing
[36:06] it's saying okay this needs to be a
[36:08] kneecap and this needs to be a sinew and
[36:10] this needs to be a muscle this needs to
[36:12] be skin this is a heart this is a lung
[36:15] and the DNA is actually and I wish I had
[36:18] the video but it's actually unraveling
[36:21] that DNA strand and then there's a
[36:23] messenger RNA that goes along and reads
[36:27] the code it reads the Little Steps along
[36:30] the way of their DNA and that tells it
[36:33] what kind of amino acids to use to build
[36:36] a protein and that protein becomes what
[36:38] you are
[36:40] so there's a messenger in our RNA that's
[36:43] actually decoding the DNA
[36:47] in your body as your cells are growing
[36:50] and that's another topic I told you it
[36:52] was part of a series all right so
[36:56] it controls every living cell when we
[36:59] allow the Bible the word of God to
[37:02] control Our Lives then the word of God
[37:05] is the language of eternal life
[37:09] now if it seems a little mysterious
[37:12] and if it seems that we often have to
[37:14] read between the lines
[37:16] you can understand that if you think of
[37:19] it as part of DNA because none of us can
[37:22] unravel DNA that would be Beyond us even
[37:25] scientists struggle with that they it's
[37:27] been you know gazillion years trying to
[37:29] map out the human genome but the point
[37:32] is
[37:33] it a it's possible but B it's incredibly
[37:36] difficult unless you have an interpreter
[37:39] unless you have a messenger RNA that can
[37:43] read the code and produce the life the
[37:47] protein the the organ within us that's
[37:50] needed
[37:52] for life
[37:53] see how that works all right so you're
[37:55] getting the picture now the question is
[37:59] we know that between the old and the New
[38:01] Testament there are four Gospels
[38:03] the question is why for
[38:07] wouldn't one have been sufficient
[38:10] yeah well there is a scripture says
[38:12] Two's A Witness okay so they we could
[38:15] have been just had two
[38:17] and three of course is perfection and
[38:19] god is perfect and Jesus Is God manifest
[38:24] In the Flesh so why not three
[38:28] that for his Redemption so that does
[38:31] make sense
[38:32] but still why four links between the old
[38:35] and the New Testament and I believe the
[38:39] answer lies in the DNA
[38:45] of course these gospels all tell more or
[38:47] less the same story of Jesus but each
[38:50] one gives us a slightly different
[38:51] viewpoint but obviously they all pertain
[38:54] to eternal life now the thing about DNA
[38:57] is it has two strands you'll see the
[38:59] blue and the red strand that controls
[39:01] our Natural Life
[39:03] but there happens to be four links
[39:06] between
[39:08] the two strands
[39:10] are at and they that's how they're
[39:12] joined together so it takes four gospels
[39:16] following the concept that God intended
[39:18] us to understand in 1950 that there
[39:22] would be this double helix structure to
[39:25] the molecule that would be connected by
[39:29] four links and we'll see some more about
[39:31] that here in a second so it God knowing
[39:35] that because he knew he would have four
[39:37] gospels and you see how with God that
[39:40] attribute that becomes a thought the
[39:42] word the manifestation it's all
[39:44] consistent God's not learning he's not
[39:46] he's not going I should try this this
[39:49] time it's all perfect because it was
[39:52] perfect to begin with all right so
[39:54] that's a big difference between God and
[39:56] us and what are those four links Matthew
[39:59] Mark Luke and John now is that order
[40:02] important we'll see whoop that was the
[40:06] important quote so I read this quote
[40:10] and I don't know if you're like me but
[40:14] when I'm listening to a sermon
[40:16] it's very difficult for me because I
[40:19] keep stumbling over something that makes
[40:22] me hit stop
[40:24] and then I struggle to go back to where
[40:26] I left off and so I end up reading the
[40:28] book or online because I want to what
[40:32] what did you say before that because you
[40:33] know you're not always tracking and this
[40:36] just comes out of nowhere
[40:38] and I don't know if any of you have ever
[40:40] worried about the two little strings
[40:43] I never did until I thought about it
[40:46] that link the new and the Old Testament
[40:50] holding Jesus between them
[40:54] isn't that amazing
[40:56] and I I don't think brother Adam ever
[40:59] mentioned DNA that I know of
[41:02] although you would have known about it
[41:05] so
[41:07] this is our scientific diagram
[41:10] all right let the left hand you know
[41:12] like from geometry or whatever let the
[41:14] left hand curly Red Line represent the
[41:17] Old Testament and the right hand curly
[41:19] blue line represent the New Testament
[41:21] and half the children here I think they
[41:25] they're back in school all right
[41:29] but now that we understand that now
[41:31] let's look at those two little strings
[41:33] that red and the blue string they're
[41:35] joined by four links called bases and
[41:37] they're named atgc
[41:40] now what's what's amazing about these
[41:43] base pairs
[41:45] is that only a and t can join with each
[41:48] other and only G and C can join with her
[41:52] so a can't go to C and G can't go to T
[41:54] so the way those four gospels are
[41:57] structured even remember mentioned 316
[42:00] you know the way they've done the verses
[42:02] is actually quite interesting well this
[42:04] is the same thing this order is a little
[42:07] bit arbitrary because it's not in
[42:09] chronological order the Way It Was
[42:10] Written they believe Mark was the
[42:12] earliest gospel that was written and uh
[42:15] and then uh Matthew and Luke and that
[42:18] there's just doesn't seem to be any
[42:20] Rhyme or Reason to the order of the
[42:22] gospels John at the end the spiritual
[42:25] gospel yes okay that sort of makes sense
[42:27] but the first three there could have
[42:29] been in any order except we'll find out
[42:33] in a minute that the order is absolutely
[42:35] critical to what's written in those
[42:38] gospels all right and so a and t go
[42:41] together and G and C go together and in
[42:44] no other way
[42:47] so you can choose any two base pairs to
[42:50] represent the link between the Old
[42:52] Testament right base pairs being you
[42:54] know each of these two rows that you see
[42:56] there
[42:57] and then the four colored links the you
[43:00] know the the ones Matthew Mark Luke and
[43:02] John join the old in the New Testament
[43:04] together and remember this is the
[43:06] language of eternal life so there's
[43:08] something CR I mean eternal life nothing
[43:10] more critical than eternal life so this
[43:13] is somehow critical to our understanding
[43:14] of eternal love and it's the four
[43:17] ministries of Christ and people say why
[43:19] are there four gospels here's part of
[43:21] the answer
[43:22] all right in order to link the old and
[43:24] the New Testament together there had to
[43:27] be a certain pattern that was going to
[43:29] be important and so when we think of uh
[43:32] DNA in the four gospels we see Matthew
[43:35] and Marco joined together and Luke and
[43:38] John are joined together and why is that
[43:41] because Matthew has 28 chapters and Mark
[43:45] has 16. adds up to 44 chapters for that
[43:49] link
[43:51] and if you add Luke and John together
[43:53] you get about the same number 45 I don't
[43:57] know who slipped up there but
[43:58] it's 45 and that's normal for types by
[44:01] the way we talked about this once uh
[44:03] times are not perfect right 20 pieces of
[44:05] silver Joseph was sold four versus
[44:07] Thirty those kind of things happen but
[44:10] this is too close to be coincidental so
[44:14] the first link Matthew and Mark that's
[44:16] 44. the second link is 45.
[44:21] so the order that they were placed in
[44:23] based on the number of chapters actually
[44:26] lines up with the way the natural cell
[44:29] works the DNA in the cell the natural
[44:32] molecule and these are the only pairs
[44:36] that are virtually the same length to
[44:38] bind the twisting strands of the old and
[44:41] the New Testament together
[44:43] now here's another little fun fact
[44:46] this is where I sometimes get criticized
[44:48] so if you feel like criticizing me I've
[44:51] already gone there so you don't have to
[44:53] bother
[44:54] but they begin to look like the rings of
[44:56] a ladder I learned that by the way as a
[44:59] teacher I used to go into my first year
[45:01] class and all these people are looking
[45:03] at me and none of them are writing
[45:05] anything down they're just staring and
[45:07] I'm busily writing away on the board and
[45:10] talking and
[45:11] I turned around this was my first year
[45:13] and I was like what is wrong with these
[45:15] people then they seem to have something
[45:17] else on their mind I quickly found out
[45:19] what it is I'd made a mistake
[45:22] and they were just quick to jump on that
[45:25] mistake oh you that's not right
[45:30] that's what they were waiting for
[45:31] they're waiting for me to make a mistake
[45:33] so now I learned my lesson next time I
[45:35] had a first year class I did something
[45:38] purposefully wrong
[45:39] and they quickly jumped on it and they
[45:41] said oh that's wrong I said now that
[45:42] we've gotten that out of the way I'm not
[45:44] perfect I'll make mistakes now you can
[45:46] concentrate on the lesson
[45:49] worked really well brother rapper anyway
[45:52] so
[45:53] these look more and more like the rungs
[45:56] of a ladder now I just thought I was the
[45:59] one that thought this of this but I'll
[46:01] tell you what I looked up again on
[46:03] online for how to tell kids about this
[46:06] and they use the same phrase they said
[46:10] when these links get put together they
[46:12] look like a letter so I felt I felt
[46:14] Justified
[46:16] climbing this ladder
[46:18] takes us upward to Heaven as we get more
[46:21] of the word more of the DNA of God more
[46:24] of the attributes of God it's like
[46:27] you're instructed in righteousness and
[46:29] you're climbing this ladder all right
[46:32] which of course we know from Jacob's
[46:35] dream so I always thought it was a
[46:37] stepladder Well turns out it might be a
[46:40] double helix ladder which is more like a
[46:43] spiral staircase right so fun fact not
[46:46] uh any doctrine that I'd like to put my
[46:48] name to all right but it does make sense
[46:52] all right because it's taking us from
[46:54] the earthy
[46:55] to the spiritual all right it's taking
[46:58] us from this life to the next life so I
[47:00] don't feel too bad so we find that the
[47:03] four gospels reveal more and more links
[47:05] between the old and the New Testament
[47:07] and we know that Jesus did both right he
[47:11] he did uh the old and the New Testament
[47:14] he fulfilled more than we realize all
[47:17] right and there's always more to
[47:19] discover we know that job chapter 5
[47:21] verse 9 which doeth great things and
[47:24] unsearchable marvelous things without
[47:27] number so when we talk about DNA until
[47:30] 1855 nobody knew about DNA until 1955
[47:34] nobody knew about the double helix and
[47:37] the way it was structured so these were
[47:39] things that would have been unknown
[47:41] unsearchable but now
[47:43] are made clear
[47:45] even his eternal power and godhead by
[47:48] the things that are made so Ephesians
[47:51] chapter 3 verse 8 unto me who am less
[47:53] than the least of All Saints is this
[47:55] Grace given that I should preach among
[47:57] the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[48:00] Christ so you say well brother Stephen
[48:03] I'm not sure all this DNA stuff it's all
[48:06] part of those things that we read
[48:08] between the lines
[48:10] all right the Love Letter the searching
[48:14] the unsearchable riches of Christ and
[48:16] we're going to have to have something to
[48:18] do in eternity by the way
[48:21] and these are some of the things that we
[48:23] would unravel that have mystified us
[48:26] here in this life but in that life
[48:28] everything will be revealed so we want
[48:32] to look at the emphasis of these gospels
[48:33] and I'm going to speed up a little bit
[48:35] because I know this is familiar to you
[48:40] let's read this Jesus is is
[48:44] very different from other human leaders
[48:48] he's our King but he's also our servant
[48:52] all right he's an ox he's a servant he
[48:54] carries our burden come unto me all you
[48:56] that labor in the heavy land I will give
[48:58] you rest all right he's willing to take
[49:02] the load of Sin from us
[49:05] all right and praise God for that all
[49:08] right and that's in spite of our
[49:10] weaknesses so now we're going to zip
[49:11] through this very quickly because you're
[49:12] all familiar with this so you know the
[49:15] lion oxman and Eagle the four living
[49:16] creatures and we know that those are
[49:19] paralleled by the gospels and I'll tell
[49:21] you very quickly so you got the picture
[49:22] Matthew repres is represented by that
[49:25] lion spirit that lion attribute Mark is
[49:28] the the servant attribute the the ox
[49:31] attribute right and then uh Luke uh was
[49:35] a doctor so he looks at things from a
[49:38] man's perspective right so when God's
[49:40] using him to write his gospel it's using
[49:44] Luke's attributes things that interested
[49:47] Luke and we'll see why that's important
[49:49] in a minute and then John of course is
[49:51] the eagle attribute of God the the the
[49:54] four living creatures around the throne
[49:57] four different ways in which God
[49:59] operates and we know that through the
[50:02] seals and so John is that eagle got
[50:05] gospel right he he doesn't look at the
[50:07] natural things he's soaring high in the
[50:10] beginning was the word the word was with
[50:11] God and the Word was gone was nothing
[50:13] made that was not made by that word I
[50:16] mean
[50:17] that's pretty heavy for the first couple
[50:19] of verses sometimes people tell new
[50:21] Christians to start in the Book of John
[50:23] hmm
[50:25] I think that might be a little bit tough
[50:27] when you start with
[50:29] the concepts of logos and the word and
[50:32] God so
[50:36] Matthew emphasizes Jesus as the king
[50:40] and if you notice the way Matthew starts
[50:42] in the beginning
[50:44] right uh John sorry John starts in the
[50:47] beginning God created so he goes way
[50:50] back
[50:51] Matthew starts somewhere in the middle
[50:55] he says Jesus Christ
[50:57] the son of David the son of Abraham now
[51:01] if you were always saying that we'd say
[51:02] Jesus the son of Abraham the son of
[51:05] David but David has the second most
[51:08] important name in the Bible
[51:10] it's the first mention other than Jesus
[51:14] in the New Testament and it's the last
[51:16] name mentioned in Revelation except for
[51:19] Jesus he's the root in The Offspring of
[51:22] David so David has a very prominent
[51:25] position in in the scripture and of
[51:29] course what's important about that oh
[51:33] I will get to it so Mark emphasizes
[51:36] Jesus as a servant he's the one who gets
[51:38] on with the job and knows exactly what
[51:40] he's doing right and Luke obviously is
[51:42] the ideal man and then John is this deep
[51:45] gospel that looks at Jesus as the word
[51:47] so Matthew emphasizes Jesus as the king
[51:51] the son of David and guess which chapter
[51:54] the genealogy of Jesus appears in
[51:56] Matthew
[51:57] it's in chapter one
[52:00] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[52:02] Abraham
[52:03] and the traces genius Jesus's genealogy
[52:07] back through David to Abraham Abraham is
[52:11] the first mention of the word Kings and
[52:13] the Bible we need to battle against the
[52:15] Kings to get a lot back and David who is
[52:19] Israel's most important King and even
[52:22] though the one that Jesus is going to
[52:25] fulfill that to sit on the throne of
[52:28] David
[52:30] so
[52:31] the fact that it's in chapter one is
[52:33] going to be important because we're
[52:34] looking at this order if you put Matthew
[52:36] and Luke together you would have a mess
[52:39] it it has to be in two separate links
[52:42] and of course he was a tax collector and
[52:45] only Kings Emperors governments
[52:49] presidents
[52:50] collect tax all right so it's another
[52:54] attribute of a king and of course that
[52:57] was very important
[52:59] um when uh to get Mary and Joseph to go
[53:02] to Bethlehem because Augustus was
[53:04] collecting taxes
[53:07] and of course that's the gospel that
[53:10] mentions the three
[53:14] gifts that were brought by the wise men
[53:18] all right it's not recorded anywhere
[53:20] else
[53:20] and why is that because when you go to
[53:23] see a king you were expected to bring
[53:25] tribute
[53:27] when
[53:28] people showed up to see Jesus at the
[53:31] banks of the Jordan in Mark's gospel
[53:33] they weren't bringing any gifts you
[53:36] don't bring tribute to a servant
[53:39] see so Mark represents Jesus as a
[53:43] servant and a sacrifice which is the ox
[53:48] now first thing you notice in the gospel
[53:50] of Mark is there's no genealogy
[53:53] because servants don't have to prove
[53:54] their qualification by their ancestry
[53:57] only Kings have to do that so King
[54:01] Charles was received the crown yesterday
[54:04] and it's because that was passed on to
[54:07] him by Queen Elizabeth who was passed on
[54:09] to her by her father King George and
[54:11] that was passed on you can see I grew up
[54:13] in South Africa I know some of this
[54:14] stuff so that is the genealogy that has
[54:18] to be proven for somebody to say
[54:22] I can be the king because of my lineage
[54:25] but Mark's gospel mentions nothing about
[54:29] a genealogy all right servants don't
[54:32] prove their qualification like that
[54:35] a good servant is known by speed and
[54:38] efficiency
[54:39] it's can you do the job well and can you
[54:43] do it fast
[54:44] so Mark uses the word straightway or
[54:47] immediately 40 times in his little
[54:51] gospel and straightway straightway he
[54:54] had Jesus on a treadmill just one thing
[54:57] after another it's like Jesus never
[55:00] stopped it was just going from one
[55:02] Miracle to the next and that's the
[55:04] gospel of Mark why is that because if
[55:08] you've got an ox a beast of burden one
[55:10] that's eating a lot of hay
[55:12] you want that Ox to perform
[55:15] all right and that's exactly what Mark
[55:17] does in his gospel and servants are
[55:21] expected to work hard and quickly but
[55:24] you have no interest in who his father's
[55:27] father's father was
[55:29] so even if
[55:31] then is where the sacrifice part comes
[55:33] in
[55:34] the ox has high value
[55:38] for its meat
[55:41] for its food
[55:43] to be food for the people
[55:46] so uh Butte we just had the Kentucky
[55:50] Derby yesterday I believe and so I
[55:54] remember that week from the discussion
[55:56] this morning because you guys were down
[55:58] there at the races weren't you weren't
[55:59] you in Louisville you weren't Louisville
[56:01] weren't you brother Paul just checking
[56:04] um but that's fortunately not with the
[56:06] Kentucky Derby is held so you're okay no
[56:09] that was just held now that is
[56:12] interesting because when an old
[56:15] successful horse
[56:17] finishes his career racing he's put out
[56:20] to stud he gets the life of liar I mean
[56:24] just luxury he can do anything he likes
[56:28] he just eats and grazes all day long
[56:30] he's out there in the field not a care
[56:33] in the world
[56:34] no one's going to kill a beautiful old
[56:38] fertile hopefully racehorse
[56:42] all right but an ox
[56:44] an ox
[56:47] can't reproduce anything with an ox by
[56:49] the way and and that's a little question
[56:52] mark in the NIV Bible by the way
[56:57] the King James uses the word heifer
[57:00] The Offspring of a heifer
[57:03] and the NIV says The Offspring of an ox
[57:07] no farmers were doing that translation
[57:12] so this Ox can't be put out to pasture
[57:16] Jesus isn't going to live a long life
[57:19] of ease and luxury
[57:21] after going straight way straight way
[57:23] straight away half The Book of Mark is
[57:26] the passion
[57:27] it's the week leading up to his
[57:29] crucifixion it's all about going going
[57:32] going
[57:33] and being killed
[57:36] that's the Book of Mark
[57:39] so the passion movie is based you
[57:42] remember whoever that was is based on
[57:45] the Book of Mark that's where most of
[57:47] the passion plays come from
[57:49] and it's because his carcass is too
[57:52] valuable to keep alive after it can't
[57:55] work anymore and where that caucus is
[57:58] that's where the Eagles will be gathered
[58:01] you see how the scripture is so perfect
[58:05] I always say this when you see things
[58:08] and I I know this because I've talked to
[58:10] people and I say so what is this where
[58:13] the caucuses there will the Eagles be
[58:14] gathered well what is that about oh it
[58:16] shouldn't be Eagles it should be
[58:18] vultures because vultures are the ones
[58:20] that eat carrion
[58:22] ago
[58:23] you just identified yourself but that's
[58:26] fine so the problem is with the
[58:29] translation because those two words
[58:31] eagle and vulture can be can be
[58:33] translated similarly
[58:34] but if you understand the inspiration
[58:36] behind it Jesus is the sacrifice that
[58:40] had to die in order for us to be fed
[58:43] spiritual food in due season
[58:46] see and that's why we have communion we
[58:49] have the bread that you had last weekend
[58:51] the bread the body that was broken it
[58:54] can't live on the blood represents the
[58:58] wine represents the blood that does live
[58:59] on but the body could not live on all
[59:03] right where are we
[59:06] so I said
[59:08] I I kind of went through this I gave you
[59:11] this ahead of time so Mark's book
[59:14] records the sacrifice in great detail
[59:17] now we go to Luke now Luke you'll notice
[59:19] is number three on our DNA molecule
[59:23] so Matthew and Mark go together the king
[59:25] and the servant by the way you remember
[59:28] David
[59:29] what's the common term used for David
[59:34] those words
[59:35] servant King
[59:37] he was the servant King do any of you
[59:40] know the song There's a beautiful song
[59:42] by Graham
[59:45] British guy anyway and it's called the
[59:48] servant King it's a lovely song by the
[59:50] way and that's what Jesus was and David
[59:53] was a servant King he remember he had a
[59:55] servant's heart he had that that
[59:58] attribute and that that's another story
[1:00:00] but I just want you to realize that in
[1:00:04] the third bases this Luke bases that
[1:00:08] we're looking at in the DNA molecule
[1:00:11] the genealogy that's so important
[1:00:14] doesn't appear in chapter one where you
[1:00:17] and I would have put it like Matthew did
[1:00:18] it appears in chapter 3.
[1:00:21] and why is that it's because it's going
[1:00:23] to trace Jesus genealogy not back to
[1:00:27] Abraham and David but all the way back
[1:00:30] to the first man which was Adam
[1:00:33] and so because he's interested in Jesus
[1:00:35] as a man he wants to show that Jesus had
[1:00:39] those human attributes
[1:00:42] passed on down through the genealogy all
[1:00:45] the way from Adam
[1:00:47] and amazingly it's the third basis in
[1:00:51] our diagram
[1:00:52] Matthew 1 Mark 2 Luke 3 and that's where
[1:00:56] the genealogy appears
[1:00:58] and of course in Luke there's no
[1:01:00] tributes to a King there's just
[1:01:03] Shepherds at the stable
[1:01:06] all right and they're interested in the
[1:01:09] birth of the sacrificial lamb that was
[1:01:12] their uh of their perspective on the
[1:01:16] birth of Jesus he's a young child I mean
[1:01:19] he's a baby he's not a young child and
[1:01:21] he is this lamb that is in a stable in a
[1:01:27] Manger wrapped in swaddling cloth Etc
[1:01:29] playing the the the pot if you like of
[1:01:33] the sacrificial lamb but as the ideal
[1:01:36] man no man can give his life for us that
[1:01:40] would do us any good but the ideal man
[1:01:42] the perfect man could
[1:01:45] and so in the Book of Luke we read about
[1:01:49] Jesus early Boyhood
[1:01:51] we don't read about that in any of the
[1:01:53] other gospels and it talks about his
[1:01:56] progression through childhood
[1:01:59] and that he was uh is it Isaiah chapter
[1:02:01] 11 the seven attributes of the spirit of
[1:02:05] God and those are repeated in Luke
[1:02:07] chapter 3 chapter 2 where it talks about
[1:02:10] Jesus Boyhood
[1:02:13] and up until the age of 12 and he grew
[1:02:16] in stature and the knowledge of of the
[1:02:19] will of God all of those things that's
[1:02:21] all in Luke so as a Doctor Luke was
[1:02:24] interested in Jesus
[1:02:26] human qualities now John
[1:02:29] no genealogy Spirits don't have a
[1:02:31] genealogy
[1:02:33] remember Hebrews talking about
[1:02:34] Melchizedek no father mother beginning
[1:02:36] of days the ending of love right so when
[1:02:39] you're talking about a spiritual being
[1:02:41] you're not talking about ancestry so
[1:02:43] John doesn't have that
[1:02:44] other than a spiritual ancestry if you
[1:02:47] like also Jesus is the one who says I am
[1:02:50] my father are one so the gospel's
[1:02:52] emphasis is on Jesus as the word made
[1:02:55] flesh he's this deity this logos that is
[1:02:59] now clearly seen the Old Testament he
[1:03:03] was hidden the New Testament he's
[1:03:05] revealed why is that it's because he was
[1:03:08] the word made flesh that clearly seen by
[1:03:11] the things that are made even his
[1:03:14] eternal power in God did so when you
[1:03:16] think of Jesus as the Son of God walking
[1:03:20] on Earth
[1:03:21] you're seeing the mystery of the godhead
[1:03:24] revealed
[1:03:26] and we all know how we understand that
[1:03:30] and now this is the most important part
[1:03:33] for me anyway
[1:03:35] this gospel
[1:03:37] leads into the book of Acts
[1:03:40] and we know what that is it's not really
[1:03:42] the book of Acts of the Apostles as the
[1:03:44] King James guys wrote it it's the acts
[1:03:47] of the holy spirit in the apostles
[1:03:50] all right so this book of Acts is the
[1:03:53] work of the spirit
[1:03:55] of Jesus in the church if the Same
[1:03:58] Spirit
[1:03:59] dwell in you
[1:04:00] that raised Jesus from the dead right he
[1:04:03] will also Quicken your mortal body all
[1:04:06] right so it's still the spirit of Jesus
[1:04:09] working in the church
[1:04:12] and so if you take the last verse of
[1:04:15] John the last chapter of John it's known
[1:04:18] as The Unfinished gospel
[1:04:21] many other things which Jesus did
[1:04:25] all the books in the world could not
[1:04:27] contain
[1:04:29] why is that
[1:04:30] because we know
[1:04:33] and you won't read this in a commentary
[1:04:35] we know
[1:04:37] that the church is the next
[1:04:40] manifestation of the body of Christ it
[1:04:45] seems so obvious to us when we say that
[1:04:46] right Paul said we're his body you know
[1:04:48] it just seems so obvious but for the
[1:04:50] time it's a mystery so this proves
[1:04:54] that when Paul ran into Jesus on the
[1:04:56] road to Damascus or vice versa
[1:04:59] he said Lord he said I'm Jesus whom you
[1:05:02] persecute
[1:05:04] and Paul never had anything to do with
[1:05:06] Jesus that we know Saul of tosses didn't
[1:05:08] have anything to do with Jesus but he
[1:05:10] was persecuting the church and Jesus
[1:05:12] said you're persecuting me
[1:05:14] all right so we know that we've got a
[1:05:16] verse for that many other things which
[1:05:19] Jesus did
[1:05:21] not the apostles did that Jesus did
[1:05:25] through the apostles all right that's
[1:05:28] what the book of Acts teaches us and so
[1:05:31] this is the unfinished gospel so you can
[1:05:35] imagine if John came first in in those
[1:05:38] four books that wouldn't make any sense
[1:05:40] would it it has to come at the end
[1:05:42] because it has to go into the book of
[1:05:45] Acts
[1:05:47] and then we read this verse First
[1:05:49] Corinthians 15 46 how be it that was not
[1:05:51] which is spiritual but that which is
[1:05:53] natural and after with that which is
[1:05:56] spiritual well the interesting thing
[1:05:58] about this is that we also have Romans 1
[1:06:01] 10 that says the invisible attributes of
[1:06:04] God so the spiritual gives rise to the
[1:06:08] Natural manifestation that in turn
[1:06:11] reflects the spiritual so remember we
[1:06:15] have to rightly divide the word that's
[1:06:17] what this is about so when scientists
[1:06:19] discovered DNA
[1:06:21] one of the things that they were quick
[1:06:24] to point out
[1:06:25] is that they could only find about three
[1:06:28] percent of the DNA that was actually
[1:06:32] doing anything
[1:06:33] that was actually providing any
[1:06:36] meaningful difference to the cells
[1:06:41] yeah
[1:06:43] I always found that hard to believe
[1:06:46] I just I'm not sure about that it's a
[1:06:49] great evolutionary story because it
[1:06:51] means there's a lot of residual DNA that
[1:06:54] we don't need anymore that came through
[1:06:57] Evolution you might hear the same thing
[1:06:59] about vestigial organs Ah that's a big
[1:07:02] word basically it means your appendix in
[1:07:05] other things but primarily they think
[1:07:08] the appendix when I was growing up up
[1:07:10] whip it out it doesn't do anything
[1:07:12] ah any nurses yet does anybody agree
[1:07:16] with anymore that's not what's taught
[1:07:17] today
[1:07:19] that's not told that they they believe
[1:07:21] that there is function for that appendix
[1:07:24] so these are all the things that people
[1:07:26] like to believe that aren't true
[1:07:28] three percent of it
[1:07:30] so they said that the 97 of the life
[1:07:36] that is in US
[1:07:37] is Just Junk DNA
[1:07:41] ha
[1:07:42] that's what I said when I read that huh
[1:07:47] but unfortunately we do the same thing
[1:07:50] with scripture
[1:07:53] when you open your Bible and you turn
[1:07:56] just one page after another and you
[1:07:58] don't see any underlining and you don't
[1:08:00] see any notes in the margin
[1:08:04] is that the junk DNA that they're
[1:08:06] talking about oh I don't know where
[1:08:10] that's got to do with anything keep
[1:08:12] turning the page let me give you an
[1:08:14] example
[1:08:15] when you talk about the Old Testament
[1:08:18] and you explain that dress is important
[1:08:21] male and female have to look different
[1:08:24] not just we're not wearing the same
[1:08:27] clothes but appear to be the same
[1:08:29] clothes who would have known we'd be
[1:08:31] facing cross-dressing today but
[1:08:33] obviously there's something in the
[1:08:35] scripture about that as well so here's
[1:08:37] the thing
[1:08:38] when they refer to that they almost
[1:08:41] always go to the next chapter I think
[1:08:43] and says oh wait a minute here it says
[1:08:45] you should not wear a garment that is
[1:08:48] made of wool and linen cotton
[1:08:52] so what about that do you apply that as
[1:08:55] well I say oh yes
[1:08:59] what are you talking about we have lots
[1:09:02] of Blended Fabrics today
[1:09:04] so ah but spiritually there's a
[1:09:07] significance
[1:09:09] and that most people they they wouldn't
[1:09:11] get this but you would say the Woolen
[1:09:14] wig
[1:09:15] that Woolen type wig that we read of
[1:09:19] Jesus wearing as he's ju as the judge in
[1:09:21] Revelation chapter one
[1:09:23] ties in with though your sins be
[1:09:25] Israelites call it there shall be as
[1:09:27] white as snow as white as wool wool is
[1:09:31] the representing representation of
[1:09:33] judgment the poor sheep has to be killed
[1:09:36] or at uh if you're going to put his skin
[1:09:40] on as a garment right wool that's
[1:09:43] judgment linen from Revelation is the
[1:09:46] righteousness of the Saints Revelation
[1:09:49] chapter 19 clothed in linen white and
[1:09:53] clean
[1:09:54] all right that's Grace
[1:09:57] so what does it mean to make a garment
[1:09:59] with Will and linen you're trying to mix
[1:10:02] Grace with the law
[1:10:06] and they don't mix if we have life we've
[1:10:11] passed from death and to life we don't
[1:10:14] have them at the same time brother
[1:10:15] Brandon says it beautifully he says you
[1:10:17] can't be awake and asleep at the same
[1:10:19] time you can't be standing up and
[1:10:21] sitting down at the same time it's in
[1:10:24] either or situation you're either under
[1:10:27] the law or you're under grace all right
[1:10:30] so that's what is the the hidden meaning
[1:10:33] if you like reading between the lines of
[1:10:36] those
[1:10:37] um those
[1:10:38] um what's the word ordinances in in the
[1:10:41] Old Testament think about that when you
[1:10:43] read those and say how does this apply
[1:10:46] to Jesus because we know it's good all
[1:10:48] right so that junk DNA that they're
[1:10:51] talking about well it's sometimes what
[1:10:54] we would regard as things we don't
[1:10:56] understand or we don't agree with
[1:11:00] but read up on it and you'll find
[1:11:02] scientists aren't so sure about the junk
[1:11:04] DNA anymore because the more they learn
[1:11:06] the more they realize it's not junk DNA
[1:11:10] and they begin to suspect that 97 of the
[1:11:15] DNA is vital for keeping us alive and
[1:11:18] for instructing the other three percent
[1:11:20] what they should do
[1:11:23] so they don't see a function for that 97
[1:11:27] but now they realize it's actually
[1:11:30] informing the other three percent
[1:11:33] all right so when we read these types
[1:11:36] and shadows when we see the Book of
[1:11:38] Esther giving us this amazing picture of
[1:11:41] the bride and all the the things that
[1:11:43] brother Brendan's been been bringing out
[1:11:46] of the Book of Esther we realize
[1:11:49] that that's not just another interesting
[1:11:52] story
[1:11:53] there's a lot of depth now Ruth is a
[1:11:56] little bit easier but Esther and
[1:11:59] Nehemiah that's another one a little bit
[1:12:01] and by the way you know you've heard me
[1:12:04] say this before please read habakkuk
[1:12:07] and Micah and Zephaniah
[1:12:11] because when you get to heaven
[1:12:15] and Micah comes up to you and says did
[1:12:16] you read my book
[1:12:22] and you go
[1:12:23] Micah who
[1:12:27] uh that's not going to be a nice
[1:12:29] experience so at least read his book and
[1:12:32] you can say oh yes I read
[1:12:35] and I remember a verse from Micah and by
[1:12:38] the way I've got this one stored for
[1:12:40] that occasion Micah chapter 5 verse 5.
[1:12:44] and it says when the enemy comes in like
[1:12:47] a flood all right it's also in Mica
[1:12:51] um God will but there's this other verse
[1:12:53] where you'll raise up a standard but
[1:12:54] there's other verses he will raise up
[1:12:56] vika 5 5 Seven Shepherds and eight
[1:12:59] principal men
[1:13:03] and we will talk about that next time I
[1:13:04] come brother all right so that maybe
[1:13:07] I'll get it next time so that active
[1:13:10] three percent has to be informed it
[1:13:13] needs a basis
[1:13:15] all right in order for it to perform its
[1:13:18] functions so that whole Old Testament
[1:13:21] that people sometimes ignore and even
[1:13:23] parts of the New Testament
[1:13:25] um that isn't junk DNA that's all
[1:13:29] remember the word all scripture is given
[1:13:33] for Doctrine and for reproof and
[1:13:35] instruction and righteousness
[1:13:38] all right
[1:13:41] all right
[1:13:44] and that's the scripture that I wanted
[1:13:47] to to uh
[1:13:49] to leave you with
[1:13:50] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:13:53] God and is profitable for Doctrine for
[1:13:55] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:13:57] and righteousness so please
[1:14:00] as your
[1:14:02] daily meditations
[1:14:05] I encourage you to start in Genesis
[1:14:09] and Page through and look for those
[1:14:11] pages which I did this morning that
[1:14:13] don't have any notes in them
[1:14:16] what part of this should I be reading
[1:14:19] that would inform me because Paul said
[1:14:21] the law was our school Master to bring
[1:14:24] us to Christ
[1:14:26] and so have I been ignored by the brand
[1:14:28] who calls him the tutor have I been
[1:14:30] ignoring the tutor the holy spirit's the
[1:14:32] tutor basing it on the Old Testament hmm
[1:14:35] I need to go back and check those
[1:14:37] lessons which I wasn't paying attention
[1:14:40] and and see what that can do to inform
[1:14:44] me about this gift of eternal life that
[1:14:47] God's given us so this DNA natural all
[1:14:51] right is a wonderful parallel example of
[1:14:55] what that spiritual attribute is like we
[1:14:58] can clearly see how God could put those
[1:15:01] attributes in us and that they would
[1:15:04] have some effect in our lives and the
[1:15:06] only way we can feed those attributes to
[1:15:09] it we can do that is to absorb to
[1:15:12] understand to take in the word of God
[1:15:14] the food for our souls and so I I just
[1:15:19] don't want you to think so much about
[1:15:20] the DNA but I want you to think about
[1:15:22] those words in the Bible that Zoe life
[1:15:25] as attributes that God has placing in us
[1:15:29] through his spirit so thank you all very
[1:15:33] much God bless you you may stand
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:44] so let's bow our heads
[1:15:47] our heavenly father as we turn the
[1:15:49] service over to brother Paul I just pray
[1:15:52] that
[1:15:53] your attributes Lord even those that I
[1:15:56] see here in front of me
[1:15:58] that Lord they just the expression of
[1:16:00] this six billion mile long natural
[1:16:05] cells natural molecules in the cells but
[1:16:08] they represent the infinite
[1:16:11] mercy of God the infinite
[1:16:14] eternal life of God that you have placed
[1:16:17] in each one of us Lord and it's that DNA
[1:16:21] that's informing us it's helping us to
[1:16:24] be instructed in righteousness your word
[1:16:27] is the lamp to our path and a lot to our
[1:16:30] feet and Lord may we use it as a ladder
[1:16:33] to Heaven Lord to the Heavenly places
[1:16:35] may we use it Lord to encourage us to
[1:16:38] walk in those heavenly places Lord we
[1:16:41] just thank you for your word we thank
[1:16:42] you for the Precision of your word we
[1:16:45] thank you for the comfort that it gives
[1:16:46] us to see all of this tied together so
[1:16:50] amazingly it can only be an infinite God
[1:16:53] that can take all of Nature and make it
[1:16:57] consistent with every word in the Bible
[1:17:00] so Lord we we just pray for each one we
[1:17:03] pray for each need we pray Lord you
[1:17:04] would undertake in every case Lord as as
[1:17:08] your word takes a hold in each one's
[1:17:11] life Lord may they receive the
[1:17:13] instruction in righteousness and may it
[1:17:15] be the literal laugh of Christ on
[1:17:18] display we ask it all in Jesus name amen
[1:17:24] thank you so much thanks brother Paul
