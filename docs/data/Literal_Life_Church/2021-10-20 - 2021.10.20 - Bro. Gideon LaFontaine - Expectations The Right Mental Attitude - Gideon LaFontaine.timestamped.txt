[0:00] amen
[0:02] i'll read this here now peter and john
[0:04] went up together into the temple
[0:07] and then in the hour of prayer
[0:09] being the ninth hour and a certain lame
[0:12] man from this mother's from his mother's
[0:14] womb was carried
[0:18] whom they led daily at the gate of the
[0:20] temple which is called beautiful
[0:22] to ask alms of them that entered into
[0:25] the temple
[0:26] who seeing peter and john about to go
[0:29] into the temple ask in alms
[0:32] and peter fastened his eyes upon him
[0:35] with john saying look unto us and he
[0:38] gave heed this man he gave heed unto
[0:41] them
[0:42] he heard them expecting to receive
[0:45] something of them
[0:48] then peter said silver and gold have i
[0:50] known
[0:51] but such as i have give iv
[0:55] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth

[1:01] so let's just pray tonight just ask for
[1:03] a blessing the reading of his word dear

[1:36] people tonight god let the let that
[1:38] worship that was we we had in song with

[1:43] period lord jesus where it softens the
[1:45] heart so that the word now god can come
[1:48] in so smoothly lord jesus and god let it
[1:51] not just stay here in the building lord

[1:55] and every one of our lives outside the
[1:57] building god that's our prayer tonight
[1:59] god we love you lord
[2:01] we give you the service in jesus name
[2:03] amen amen you may be
[2:06] seated amen
[2:10] so i picked the subject of expectation
[2:13] tonight
[2:15] so uh i guess
[2:17] the thought i guess it's always kind of
[2:20] been in my mind this thought of
[2:22] expectation my mom laughs at me all the
[2:24] time
[2:25] because i when i talk about expectation
[2:27] or expectation for for people
[2:31] i said i guess i've changed my mind in
[2:34] the last couple years that i i
[2:36] set my expectations so low for people
[2:39] you know
[2:40] i set my expectations low so i won't get
[2:42] disappointed right
[2:44] it which you know i'm still trying to
[2:46] figure out you know it's not it's a work
[2:48] in progress i don't know if i'm exactly
[2:50] right on that yet
[2:51] but um
[2:53] so this this sermon kind of started that
[2:56] thought but um we have
[2:58] we have a place
[3:00] where we can have a right expectation
[3:03] amen amen so that's kind of what i'm
[3:05] getting at tonight i love i love things
[3:07] that are sure you know i like a
[3:09] foundation
[3:10] i like things that i can i can look at
[3:12] and i can i can see and i'm like
[3:15] that that's for sure you know if we can
[3:17] see those things that are crystal clear
[3:19] that gets me excited and it's in its
[3:21] simplicity that you really have to dumb
[3:24] yourself down amen kind of gotta dumb
[3:26] yourself down sometimes when you're
[3:27] reading your words is it really this
[3:29] simple is it really this simple
[3:31] amen amen
[3:34] this thing is uh so let's let's uh let's
[3:36] sing this i'm song leading still
[3:39] amen so first question tonight where are
[3:41] your expectations
[3:43] so when you think of expectations you
[3:45] think of like
[3:47] i don't know you think of uh
[3:49] i don't know just the expectations you
[3:51] have for individuals you the
[3:52] expectations you have for
[3:54] let's say uh like your children or your
[3:56] spouse or something like that you have a
[3:58] lot of times human nature has a high
[4:01] expectation it's just our nature that
[4:03] sets this high expectation just right
[4:06] off the bat i don't know it could be the
[4:09] the standards we have or just how we
[4:10] grew up
[4:12] but a lot of times even growing up in a
[4:14] christian home i know that you see a lot
[4:16] of things that are so good that your
[4:17] expectation is so high of people and
[4:20] just just a lot of things you know
[4:23] so um
[4:25] i guess
[4:26] when the when the flesh um when the
[4:28] flesh is involved in this world
[4:31] um
[4:31] with high expectations and how things
[4:34] should be we are easily disappointed as
[4:36] i said
[4:37] um
[4:38] because because of our fallen nature
[4:42] we are bound to be fallible right
[4:44] because of this flesh we are fallible
[4:46] right
[4:47] because
[4:48] obviously we have a a seed i believe i
[4:50] have a seed within me that's
[4:52] it's a part of god and it's perfect
[4:54] right it's perfect because it's a part
[4:56] of him but with this flesh we are
[4:58] we are fallible amen so
[5:00] that's kind of where the expectations
[5:03] come and you have the husband and wife
[5:04] scenario right so i don't know too much
[5:07] about that
[5:08] i don't know too much about the husband
[5:09] and wife uh i haven't experienced it
[5:12] myself um i believe i will but um
[5:15] i've you know i've watched a lot and
[5:17] i've seen the right way and i've seen
[5:19] the wrong way but any one of you married
[5:21] people could tell me that
[5:23] you know if you set some sort of
[5:25] expectations for your spouse
[5:28] or a high expectation
[5:30] then there's going to be trouble right
[5:33] there's going to be trouble
[5:35] so
[5:37] i mean i go to the another example would
[5:39] be i go to the fridge
[5:41] i go to the fridge like constantly right
[5:44] expecting something incredible
[5:46] to be in there right open it i go out
[5:50] i go
[5:51] i'm sitting on the couch and it's just
[5:52] this cycle i keep going back to the
[5:54] fridge
[5:56] i open it i keep opening expecting
[5:58] something like a nice chocolate cake to
[6:01] be in there i don't know a nice steak
[6:03] like i said you don't like microwave
[6:05] steak so maybe not a steak but
[6:07] um but you know you know what i'm saying
[6:09] you guys have been there right
[6:12] so what i'm trying to say is if your
[6:14] expectation is high for something or
[6:17] something that is fallible
[6:18] why are you troubled when it doesn't go
[6:20] as planned right
[6:23] so
[6:24] some people expect a sensation or
[6:26] feeling
[6:27] so
[6:29] even this this could go on a spiritual
[6:31] sense as far as your healing you're
[6:33] expecting you're expecting or a healing
[6:36] or um like a deliverance but you're
[6:38] expecting almost like a feeling that
[6:40] goes with it which feelings are up and
[6:43] down right
[6:44] feelings they go up and they're they're
[6:46] everywhere and that honestly should not
[6:48] be our
[6:49] our basis for our expectations and where
[6:52] they should be
[6:53] right and that goes for god too god our
[6:56] flesh we get so excited sometimes and we
[6:58] can be on the mountain in probably one
[7:00] hour and then right back down the next
[7:02] hour it can be that quick sometimes
[7:05] especially on these phones right this
[7:08] this can numb you so quick you know it
[7:10] can i mean it like i know from my
[7:13] experience i've been
[7:14] i've been like i've been like let's
[7:16] let's say i i get home from a meeting or
[7:19] something like that i'm so energized
[7:20] with what god's doing i'll be on this
[7:22] for maybe 10 minutes
[7:24] and there it goes
[7:26] there it is it's gone amen and that
[7:29] affects that alters your expectations of
[7:32] what god is doing right
[7:35] so
[7:36] in this uh this lame man uh in this lame
[7:40] man's case his his expectation all the
[7:42] time was about money right
[7:45] that can be some some person's
[7:46] expectations sometimes and they they
[7:49] live off the next paycheck and they they
[7:51] gotta have it and if i don't have this
[7:53] next paycheck that's their that's their
[7:55] pride and joy that's their their the way
[7:58] they live that's just what they they
[8:00] they dwell on all the time and this this
[8:01] lame man he's seeking satisfaction with
[8:04] with money
[8:06] um
[8:07] that that ain't gonna get you through at
[8:08] all you know that that money is the root
[8:11] of all evil right
[8:12] and it's not it's not your satisfaction
[8:14] at all it may give temporary
[8:16] satisfaction but it is not going to get
[8:18] you
[8:19] get you to a satisfaction
[8:22] that is is consistent amen
[8:25] amen
[8:26] now i wanted to tell you that there is
[8:28] something that you can place your
[8:30] expectations in
[8:31] and never be disappointed because it is
[8:34] infallible and what is that it's the
[8:37] word of god how many believe that
[8:39] tonight it's the word of god amen it is
[8:42] infallible it is perfect amen we have we
[8:45] have a foundation tonight that we can
[8:47] come to
[8:48] and we can say
[8:50] where can i go where's my filter now i
[8:52] can go back right back to this word and
[8:54] i can say all right lord where where's
[8:56] my where's my expectation come from amen
[8:59] this is this word is where my faith
[9:01] where my expectation comes from amen
[9:04] this is the basis we've got to come back
[9:06] to this if we don't come back to this
[9:08] we'll turn to something else and we'll
[9:09] get in this cycle we'll get in the cycle
[9:11] of just going going up and down with
[9:14] just feelings and everything else we've
[9:16] got to come back to the foundation amen
[9:18] hallelujah amen
[9:21] it says the scripture says heaven and
[9:23] earth will pass away but my words will
[9:25] not pass away amen all the things of
[9:27] this world and then all the pleasures
[9:29] and even
[9:31] i think i remember my dad saying at one
[9:32] time even christian music sometimes even
[9:36] christian music can can get you
[9:39] in this high right
[9:40] and it can get i mean it's it's still
[9:42] good words still good things and if you
[9:44] if you keep that maintaining that
[9:47] and you're just on that all the time it
[9:49] can actually be
[9:50] in a lot of ways it can it can bring you
[9:52] down because you're you're going in it
[9:55] so much and i i'm not against christian
[9:57] music you guys know that for me
[9:59] i love christian music
[10:01] but all i'm saying is that that can
[10:04] there's a peak to that right there's a
[10:06] peak
[10:06] and that's when the word of god comes in
[10:09] the word of god is going to
[10:11] to push you through to that next spot
[10:13] amen
[10:14] amen hallelujah
[10:17] amen so in nursing school we have a
[10:19] thing called evidence-based practice
[10:22] okay evidence-based practice
[10:24] is something that has stood the test of
[10:27] time it's been practiced over and over
[10:29] and it's something that works right so i
[10:32] was just thinking how this could relate
[10:34] to even god's word you know we got
[10:36] nurses amen they they're just doing so
[10:39] much all the time that could be up and
[10:40] down like it's
[10:42] it's uh i mean some some of the things
[10:44] you're shocked you know with what some
[10:46] of the what the nurses do i'm not gonna
[10:48] give anything away but i'm just you know
[10:51] you know what i mean i'm sure you guys
[10:52] have that experience of nurses doing
[10:54] things and you're just like this isn't
[10:55] even common sense but they have they
[10:58] have this thing called evidence-based
[11:00] practice where it stood the test of time
[11:01] like this is going to work amen
[11:03] so that's why i related to god's word
[11:06] this is going to work amen
[11:08] hallelujah amen thank you god
[11:12] so
[11:13] your expectation
[11:14] in the word will always be satisfied
[11:17] but not only satisfied
[11:20] but now unto him that is able to do
[11:22] exceeding abundant above all that we ask
[11:25] or think according to the power that has
[11:28] worked in us
[11:29] amen unto him to be the glory of this
[11:32] church of jesus christ amen i love that
[11:34] scripture right there
[11:36] amen he's he's able to do exceeding
[11:39] abundant what we ask or think amen when
[11:42] our foundation's in that word this
[11:45] i mean it's amazing how much this word
[11:47] just i would say in the past years i can
[11:49] past year i can testify of this how much
[11:51] this word has exploded to me like just
[11:54] has come alive to me amen i i gotta
[11:57] testify of that just because that is
[11:59] that's something that you know i i
[12:02] probably have read the bible i've
[12:03] started in genesis just like you have
[12:05] over and over trying to read the bible
[12:07] every year you know
[12:08] and nothing you know you feel like
[12:10] you're just reading words you know and
[12:12] you know now i can it's it's amazing i
[12:14] can see you know just through your
[12:16] scriptures and i'm just like my god this
[12:18] is incredible so always seek that seek
[12:21] revelation brother branham said more
[12:23] than anything
[12:24] seek revelation amen why revelation is
[12:28] because
[12:29] that's that's where we got the the
[12:31] connection with god amen you see abel
[12:34] abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[12:36] than cain why because he had that
[12:38] revelation always stick with that
[12:40] revelation of the word for your day amen
[12:44] amen all the all the other ages
[12:47] you know they they had a light right but
[12:49] now
[12:50] there's there's another light right
[12:52] so we've come to this light and we've
[12:54] got we've got we got to stick with this
[12:57] light we can't just dwell on the other
[12:58] lights right because they've faded out
[13:00] but that those lights have connected to
[13:02] this light and now we're in this light
[13:04] so stick with your delight for your day
[13:07] amen
[13:08] i couldn't say that enough amen that is
[13:10] needed for this day amen
[13:12] people this world and i've been in the
[13:14] i've been in the mental health hospitals
[13:16] for clinicals this this world we're here
[13:19] people we are here we are we're in the
[13:22] insane world amen these people these
[13:25] people know these some of these people
[13:26] they know scripture more than i do
[13:28] they're ranting off scripture just like
[13:29] that amen i mean obviously we know that
[13:33] demons they know scripture too amen but
[13:36] at the same time they you know they come
[13:38] and they they're saying they're god and
[13:39] everything like it's it's just it is
[13:42] crazy if you you if you come to you know
[13:44] and see that i i pray none of us get
[13:47] there you know with uh with the power of
[13:49] the blood i believe no none of us will
[13:51] amen
[13:52] praise the lord
[13:54] so
[13:56] i've got to
[13:57] let's get this next part here
[14:00] all right so we got this uh quote here i
[14:02] have an expectations i love this and if
[14:04] god's words and if god's word's no good
[14:08] then he's no good
[14:10] he's no better than his word
[14:12] and he'll
[14:13] he'll say this
[14:15] that god keeps every word that he said
[14:18] in every promise that he said and if
[14:20] you'll take the right i love this if you
[14:22] take the right mental attitude toward
[14:24] any divine promise god ever made he will
[14:28] bring it to pass if you can just take
[14:30] the right attitude and believe it with
[14:32] all your heart amen if you've got that
[14:35] right men it i love how he says this
[14:36] because he says the right mental
[14:38] attitude amen
[14:40] i was just so astounded we we almost we
[14:42] almost take away in some ways the what
[14:46] god can use through our humanness amen
[14:48] what he can use through our mental
[14:49] attitude amen
[14:51] it's like
[14:52] he he uses that for
[14:54] for his potential amen hallelujah thank
[14:58] you god
[14:59] so
[15:00] see you coming with that the next one
[15:02] the the individual it starts it's it's
[15:05] it isn't that you have to to have
[15:07] somebody to to lay hands on you with a
[15:10] certain sensation as i said before and
[15:12] my
[15:13] there's no many there's so many
[15:15] sensations today it couldn't be right
[15:17] by god's words but god's words still
[15:20] write see it's all right
[15:22] the sensation i have i don't know
[15:24] nothing about them but i do know that
[15:27] the word of god is right so therefore
[15:30] when god says anything it must ever
[15:32] remain that way and that's the way i
[15:34] believe it i've studied it and history
[15:37] and what he said and what take place and
[15:40] through the ages the church ages and so
[15:42] forth and see it just dovetailed
[15:44] together until i'm sad still i'm
[15:46] satisfied
[15:48] that he's god and every word is true and
[15:50] he keeps his word with his people
[15:52] aren't you glad he keeps his word with
[15:54] his people alleluia thank you god
[15:57] amen his word never fails amen it's the
[16:00] anchor amen amen it's the anchor in the
[16:03] storm amen hallelujah
[16:06] it keeps things together when the winds
[16:08] are blowing amen in life when you're
[16:10] in a certain situation i don't know what
[16:12] you're going through tonight but if
[16:13] you're in a certain situation it might
[16:15] be just this little battle it might be
[16:17] this little battle right here amen it
[16:20] doesn't have to be some crazy thing it
[16:21] might be just something maybe someone
[16:23] you're praying for and man a certain
[16:25] situation maybe a loved one's gone or
[16:27] something like that but that anchor amen
[16:29] it holds amen thank you lord
[16:32] amen that's what i want to get to is the
[16:34] faith
[16:35] amen the expectation that's why i love
[16:38] people talk about i'm talking about
[16:40] expectation and people kind of sometimes
[16:42] are scared of the word hope
[16:44] sometimes they're like oh hope
[16:46] that's just like you're hoping something
[16:48] right like it's just up in the air like
[16:50] i hope this happens but really faith is
[16:53] connected with hope hope is i believe
[16:57] the expectation along with the faith
[16:59] amen
[17:00] amen so
[17:02] and if god's word let's see i got okay
[17:05] so now we're getting to abraham i love
[17:06] the story abraham believed and expected
[17:10] for 25 years this is a long time he
[17:13] expected amen
[17:15] 25 years don't be weary and well doing
[17:18] people amen he has something in his
[17:20] heart he had a promise amen he held he
[17:23] staggered not the promise amen
[17:26] faith is not a shot in the dark i love
[17:28] this
[17:30] faith is not a shot in the dark amen
[17:33] it's not something that you let's let's
[17:35] take that right now so you you're
[17:37] shooting at something it's not like
[17:39] you're you ain't got a scope or you're
[17:41] you know you're shooting at nothing
[17:42] right it's not like you're saying oh
[17:45] lord i believe for my healing
[17:47] but you know i hope you know i guess you
[17:49] know i wish it would happen or something
[17:50] it's not like this hope or this uh i'm
[17:52] saying hope which i just said but you
[17:54] know what i mean it's not this like
[17:56] fluffy thing right
[17:57] it's it's uh it's sure so you you it's
[18:00] the it's the sight amen and then faith
[18:03] faith is not a shot in the dark faith is
[18:06] sure amen it's based on the word of god
[18:09] if we have this promise
[18:11] amen it's it's gonna come through amen
[18:14] praise the lord thank you god
[18:16] faith is not a shock shot in the dark i
[18:19] used to pray amen i used to pray for the
[18:21] holy ghost at camps this is kind of what
[18:23] i said before i guess i'll move on
[18:25] see sometimes i write notes and then i'm
[18:27] like i already said this so
[18:30] just bear with me tonight though amen
[18:32] thank you lord
[18:33] amen scripture says face faith is the
[18:36] substance of things hoped for or
[18:38] expected for the evidence of things not
[18:40] seen amen brother
[18:43] i want to come to get uh get to a few
[18:46] things tonight just about
[18:48] what things can maybe hinder your
[18:50] expectation
[18:51] of what god's doing in the church or
[18:53] what god's maybe
[18:55] he's uh he's dealing in your life what
[18:57] can hinder you
[18:58] um during that process of expectation
[19:01] right
[19:02] so i have just a few things here and i
[19:05] love actually what spark kind of this
[19:07] thought was brother barry last this
[19:09] sunday i was there
[19:11] and in whom in human nature
[19:13] sometimes we laugh and can and sound so
[19:16] wise with our worldly wisdom
[19:19] that what we make that what may sound
[19:22] good to others
[19:23] might be backed by fear right
[19:26] i thought this was amazing just because
[19:29] this
[19:30] we we have this this goal this prize in
[19:32] in in front of our eyes but we have
[19:35] obviously so many voices around us
[19:38] telling us what's right and wrong and i
[19:39] know this for a fact with nursing i
[19:41] really had to say lord i know there's a
[19:44] lot of good things in this medical field
[19:46] that can do good but i have to realize
[19:48] that god
[19:50] he's the answer he's the healer amen i
[19:53] have to realize that all this worldly
[19:55] wisdom
[19:56] honestly
[19:57] a lot of it is based by fear amen it's
[20:00] like we've got to protect you know how
[20:01] it is in this coven amen
[20:04] it's all backed by fear there's this
[20:06] fear involved amen that's right that's
[20:08] something that can hold you back from
[20:10] your true expectation of what your
[20:12] promise is amen
[20:14] amen thank you lord
[20:17] amen
[20:19] so a couple of other factors that may
[20:21] cloud or affect
[20:23] and then there's other things that may
[20:24] enhance your expectations right
[20:27] past experiences may affect your
[20:29] expectations what you've been through in
[20:31] the past
[20:33] your friendships it can go either or
[20:35] amen the people that you hang around is
[20:38] going to affect
[20:39] what you say what you what you do amen
[20:42] that can affect your expectations i mean
[20:44] man your faith it can affect
[20:46] i mean if you if you're around a group
[20:48] of friends and i i know this
[20:50] um
[20:51] just based on who you hang around and
[20:53] you want you know you want to
[20:55] be friendly and you want to you know
[20:57] adapt to the company you're in sometimes
[21:00] but at the same time
[21:02] know who you're around amen know
[21:05] know who's going to lift you up amen and
[21:08] encourage you in the faith amen
[21:10] sometimes sometimes you have people you
[21:12] know even bring you down sometimes like
[21:14] they want your empathy or your sympathy
[21:17] um about like a certain issue they're
[21:18] going through and it's like you know no
[21:20] you want my faith you know you want you
[21:23] know what so so be
[21:24] you know look for those people to be
[21:26] around that will encourage you and be
[21:27] there not blowing away the other people
[21:29] because we're supposed to be the light
[21:31] of the world amen amen but at the same
[21:34] time the people that encourage you and
[21:35] the faith amen praise the lord
[21:38] amen
[21:40] family can be family even can be a
[21:43] hindrance to towards your expectations
[21:45] amen
[21:46] the the people that love you so much
[21:49] amen sometimes you know even some
[21:52] mothers will they'll be so involved with
[21:55] you know let's say essential oils or
[21:57] something like that that they get so you
[21:59] know involved with that they that's
[22:01] their first thing they go to amen
[22:04] and let's say let's say you got healing
[22:06] or or something else or they got they
[22:08] got a pill for that or something like
[22:09] that
[22:10] um and not that we you know knock those
[22:12] things off because i am in nursing
[22:14] believe me i believe that these things
[22:16] aid in those those processes right
[22:20] but i i'm getting back to the fact what
[22:23] is our what is our foundation where are
[22:25] we looking amen for our source of
[22:28] strength our source of healing amen
[22:30] it's jesus christ you believe that
[22:32] hallelujah
[22:34] thank you god
[22:36] amen
[22:37] so then we have uh just distractions as
[22:40] i said before your phone that can i mean
[22:42] i know for me that has
[22:44] this this phone amen
[22:47] this is
[22:48] this is a hindrance amen how many can
[22:51] agree to that amen everyone i know that
[22:54] i know i know that's a fact for all of
[22:55] us amen it's it clow it almost clouds
[22:59] your your point of view with where you
[23:01] know where you're going with christ even
[23:03] amen
[23:05] and where he wants you to be even too
[23:07] you know and it may just be innocent
[23:08] stuff on there but it actually can cloud
[23:11] cloud your
[23:13] you know cloud where you're going amen
[23:16] amen
[23:17] um entertainment can do it as well
[23:20] things we feed on really things we feed
[23:22] on
[23:23] amen
[23:25] that can cloud our expectations
[23:27] feeling numb or stagnant may hold you
[23:29] back
[23:30] look to the word the promise amen
[23:34] so now i want to get into this date this
[23:35] story of david and i'm kind of clouding
[23:38] around my first um thought here
[23:41] which let me look at my time here okay
[23:43] we're doing right
[23:45] see i'm too worried about not
[23:47] go you know taking enough time now this
[23:49] is not good all right
[23:51] so
[23:53] um
[23:54] i know you guys support me so that's all
[23:56] right amen
[23:58] so let's uh let's take the story of
[24:00] david so you got david
[24:02] so he's uh
[24:03] i love the story of david because you
[24:05] have this you have this little
[24:08] scrawny kind of
[24:09] red-headed pretty looking kind of a
[24:12] almost you got him like
[24:14] you know he he plays music he's kind of
[24:17] like
[24:18] you know i don't want to use this term
[24:20] it's probably a modern term but he
[24:21] probably would be considered a fruity
[24:23] kind of guy right
[24:25] that's what that's what the term today
[24:27] is you know he would probably and
[24:29] probably to his brothers he he was to
[24:31] this right his brothers probably looked
[24:32] at him and he was like
[24:34] they were just like david oh my goodness
[24:36] this guy's a wacko he's just weird he's
[24:39] out there herding sheep
[24:41] and he's you know he's playing these
[24:44] music trying to serenade the sheep i
[24:47] guess
[24:48] i don't know what he's doing right
[24:50] so i love the story of dave just because
[24:52] you see the simplicity of who god uses
[24:55] amen
[24:57] amen
[24:58] so
[24:59] david i love the story i'm going kind of
[25:02] leading towards the story of you know
[25:04] the giant in your life right so
[25:07] david um
[25:09] david he
[25:10] he comes to the battle and he he kind of
[25:13] he hears what's kind of what's going on
[25:15] right he hears what this philistine's
[25:17] saying
[25:18] and he's he's he's he's basically
[25:21] you know
[25:22] going opposite of what the giants say is
[25:24] like no this is not gonna happen you
[25:26] know it was funny because his brother
[25:28] actually
[25:30] let me see if i got this yeah his
[25:31] brother david's brother seemed
[25:33] embarrassed of him as far as i read in
[25:35] the scripture he actually got
[25:36] embarrassed he actually got angry
[25:38] at his brother for talking like this
[25:41] like for for speaking victory right
[25:44] he's like this is embarrassing i don't
[25:45] want you around right and we're
[25:48] sometimes even for us we can have this
[25:50] whole battle going on in our minds with
[25:53] with our expectations of what god's
[25:55] gonna do we have a little you know
[25:57] voices in our ear that's like
[26:00] you know this is crazy this is this is
[26:02] not this is dumb you know with our human
[26:05] nature we always have these voices
[26:06] coming in that are just like you know
[26:09] this sounds crazy what you're talking
[26:10] about how are we going to take this
[26:11] giant you know it's probably some of the
[26:14] soldiers over there you know they see
[26:16] david and they're just like
[26:18] like
[26:19] david like they're they're probably
[26:21] laughing at them they're honestly are
[26:23] they're probably laughing at them and
[26:25] you know with the with the worldly
[26:26] wisdom some days you can almost laugh
[26:29] at
[26:30] the word right you can laugh at some of
[26:33] the things that say in here and i've
[26:35] been there i've been like how is this
[26:37] how is this even possible
[26:38] but then you got to realize i've got
[26:40] something in me that says no that's the
[26:42] truth amen
[26:44] amen hallelujah
[26:47] so david
[26:48] so you got this the story of david here
[26:50] um you got david going and meeting his
[26:54] giant he takes five smooth stones and i
[26:56] love what the song says even
[26:58] michael belton's song i wanted to i
[27:01] wanted to just you know say it but he
[27:03] said
[27:04] he picked up stones from the river
[27:06] knowing that our god will deliver he had
[27:09] already that expectation going into the
[27:11] battle going into the valley because you
[27:14] see this they're both on top he's going
[27:16] into his valley knowing that his god
[27:18] will deliver amen
[27:20] hallelujah do you believe he's going to
[27:23] deliver
[27:24] amen every single time this world word
[27:27] delivers amen praise the lord amen
[27:31] we've got joshua and caleb
[27:33] and this is kind of the thought brother
[27:35] barry was bringing as well but joshua
[27:37] and caleb you see another giant
[27:39] you know you see the giants they're kind
[27:40] of looking they're kind of looking and
[27:42] you know they're scouting out right
[27:45] and this is kind of the thought where
[27:47] you know the other besides joshua and
[27:48] caleb you've got these other people that
[27:51] are
[27:51] they're they're kind of sounding wise
[27:53] and their own into like they're kind of
[27:54] saying why don't we just
[27:56] why don't we just uh wait till the
[27:58] giants die or something and then we'll
[28:00] go take it right why don't we just do
[28:03] that but that was backed by fear like i
[28:05] was saying earlier it's backed by fear
[28:07] not by faith but what is joshua and
[28:09] caleb saying
[28:10] we are more than able to take the land
[28:13] hallelujah they had a promise amen they
[28:16] take that promise this is your promise
[28:18] now
[28:19] take that promise and believe it amen
[28:22] with all your heart amen praise the lord
[28:25] amen and don't neglect i love this don't
[28:28] neglect the little battles
[28:30] god gives you amen
[28:33] sometimes like i i'm being vulnerable
[28:36] with you this morning but um you know
[28:38] this morning i guess it's a victory too
[28:40] so i can testify this morning but
[28:42] something very simple
[28:44] um unless i have to take me back but
[28:47] anyways
[28:48] one of my clients
[28:50] their niece i believe or their
[28:52] granddaughter gave me a brownie all
[28:54] right
[28:56] gave me a brownie and a lot of times for
[28:58] me and clients when they give food to me
[29:00] i'm like no all right i'm not gonna use
[29:02] i'm not going to do this because it's
[29:04] just you don't know all right
[29:08] you don't know all right i've seen a lot
[29:10] so
[29:11] you don't know but anyways she gave it
[29:13] to me and i was like i just want to be
[29:14] nice i was like yeah i'll take it
[29:16] and then
[29:17] you know i get home
[29:19] and i think dad looks at her something
[29:21] like that and
[29:22] i was like he was asking me about i was
[29:24] like you know i don't really trust some
[29:26] of these
[29:27] clients when they give me
[29:29] when they give me like you know
[29:31] food or whatever so
[29:33] i uh
[29:34] you know i tell them just throw it away
[29:35] or i throw it away or something like
[29:37] that so then the next day i go into the
[29:39] client's house actually this morning so
[29:41] i go to the client's house and i'm like
[29:43] lord please don't let this girl
[29:47] don't let this girl
[29:49] ask me about this this morning or else
[29:51] i'm gonna be
[29:52] i'm gonna be up a creek right
[29:55] so anyways i go in there first thing she
[29:58] says
[29:59] first thing she says is like how do you
[30:00] like my brownie
[30:04] and so i you know i said well
[30:07] i haven't ate it i haven't ate it quite
[30:09] yet
[30:11] right
[30:13] right
[30:14] and so i go into hit you know the
[30:17] client's room
[30:18] fix them up you know clean them up
[30:21] i'm not gonna get in the detail with
[30:22] that um
[30:24] but
[30:25] so i uh i go back in there
[30:28] and you know the whole time you know
[30:30] while i'm cleaning cleaning the guy up
[30:32] and helping them out i you know i
[30:34] realized that you know that was
[30:37] that wasn't the full truth you know that
[30:39] wasn't
[30:41] i mean i don't know what it was within
[30:43] me and even while i'm working i'm
[30:44] messing up i'm doing because i like my
[30:46] my whole minds on that i'm just like
[30:49] and you know i guess as a as a
[30:51] you know young minister too you want to
[30:53] be
[30:54] you want to be very uh
[30:56] how do i say this
[30:57] sensitive to what god's doing in your
[30:59] life and
[31:01] be sensitive of what he's uh
[31:03] accomplishing in your life so you want
[31:05] to be sensitive to that and if if
[31:07] anything comes in between that or
[31:09] hinders you know something even tonight
[31:11] where i'm speaking to you i don't want
[31:13] earlier in the day to affect that or
[31:16] you know come in between that so that's
[31:18] what i'm going through you know in my
[31:19] mind i'm just like lord
[31:21] i think we need honestly i think we need
[31:23] more people like that
[31:25] you know
[31:26] being more sensitive to what
[31:28] being more sensitive what god's doing in
[31:30] your life and men not neglecting the
[31:32] little battles that he's given you amen
[31:35] not neglecting what the little things
[31:37] maybe
[31:38] maybe it's a maybe just just saying
[31:40] sorry to your child maybe you've got the
[31:42] something where you're you know
[31:44] you're talking to your child and you
[31:46] know you just brush them off or
[31:47] something like that you know you got
[31:49] something
[31:50] um going on you're too busy or something
[31:52] but maybe it's just maybe it's something
[31:54] some simple like that but don't neglect
[31:56] those little times or slack off when you
[31:59] can you can come in like that and you
[32:01] can you know be sensitive and say you
[32:04] know i'm sorry about that honey you know
[32:06] don't don't neglect those little battles
[32:08] god give you because that's what he
[32:10] wants to perfect you with amen
[32:12] he's he's perfecting you with the gold
[32:14] so why why i think that all these big
[32:17] things are going to make you this it's
[32:19] it's the detail he's getting into the
[32:21] details of your life amen
[32:23] and so that's just that's something free
[32:25] that you know god was doing with me this
[32:27] morning so i hope it blessed you but
[32:30] i love another quote brother barry said
[32:33] this weekend was
[32:35] your giants become smaller when you look
[32:37] at them through the promise

[32:42] giants through that promise amen

[32:50] through the promise amen this is your
[32:52] this is your filter this is what i'm
[32:53] looking through amen
[32:55] now all those giants
[32:57] they go down amen praise the lord amen
[33:00] it's by the word i love what brother
[33:02] boaz was talking about last week
[33:04] amen in the in the word how it's it's

[34:23] is what i'm going for amen amen do
[34:26] things that will that will keep you on
[34:28] track amen
[34:29] you sometimes you gotta you gotta get
[34:32] creative with it but do things in order
[34:34] to say god it might be it might be
[34:37] healing let's say it's healing but just
[34:39] like this this sister here it might be
[34:41] healing so you you you take it and you
[34:44] you do not shy away you do not have any
[34:46] doubt on your profession you keep
[34:48] believing that with all your heart amen
[34:50] amen you believe for your lost family
[34:52] members as well just as you believe
[34:55] for your lost soul
[34:57] job offered a sacrifice for his family

[35:02] that same thing it's it all has to do
[35:05] with your faith amen god's placing this
[35:07] faith he's giving you a choice amen he's
[35:10] giving you that choice of like what are

[35:24] how can he
[35:26] i'm trying to get my words i guess i'm
[35:28] getting to i know where it's in my notes
[35:29] but i'll get to it
[35:31] so um
[35:33] back to the original scripture so this
[35:35] is where i'm coming to back to the
[35:37] original scripture
[35:39] where you've got this this lame man and
[35:41] he's he's in there
[35:43] he's at the i love how it's called uh
[35:46] gate beautiful
[35:48] amen this is just i don't know why it's
[35:50] named that but it's gate beautiful to
[35:52] see this miracle go on with uh john and
[35:56] john and peter and it's called gate
[35:57] beautiful because i believe god looks at
[35:59] your faith and he thinks that it's
[36:01] beautiful amen he looks at your your
[36:04] desires your real desires in your heart
[36:06] and he thinks that is just beautiful
[36:08] amen hallelujah just like
[36:11] i mean just like the
[36:13] the blood issue woman you know she
[36:16] it took virtue out of the lord amen
[36:18] there's something in him that struck
[36:21] amen
[36:22] praise the lord
[36:23] amen i i've never talked about this
[36:26] really before but we'll just let go
[36:28] um you wonder how even that with that
[36:31] instance you've got the blood issue you
[36:33] know a lot of times
[36:35] people you know
[36:36] a lot of times that comes to the heart
[36:38] you know that's that's where the heart
[36:40] starts you know that's where the blood
[36:41] comes from amen
[36:43] and you can even see nowadays i've
[36:45] noticed this um just you know since
[36:47] starting nursing
[36:49] but what's what's the main cause of
[36:51] disease this year does anyone know or
[36:53] does the main cause of disease um
[36:55] probably in the past 10 years what is it
[36:59] it's heart disease right or what's a
[37:00] cause of death i guess what i'm saying
[37:02] it's heart disease it's heart trouble
[37:04] amen i believe that natural types of
[37:07] spiritual people
[37:08] are struggling
[37:09] with their the working of their heart
[37:12] their heart is getting hard amen they're
[37:14] probably getting you know
[37:16] a spiritual heart a spiritual heart
[37:18] attack spiritual heart disease that's a
[37:20] process amen it's the things you eat
[37:23] it's a it's a lot of different things
[37:24] that affects this heart amen
[37:26] so um
[37:28] i guess
[37:29] give it to god he'll he'll make it he'll
[37:31] make it a heart of flesh amen you
[37:33] believe that tonight
[37:35] that was just something extra too
[37:37] um that god's been laying on my heart
[37:39] but you know you can't help but share
[37:41] something sometimes you know just like
[37:43] just there on the fly but
[37:45] there it is
[37:47] um so back to the original scripture
[37:49] here i come um first he asked for money
[37:53] which i already said before
[37:54] um he asked for money
[37:56] and that's where kind of his
[37:58] expectations was the whole time you know
[38:00] he's he's expecting money from all these
[38:02] people he's in that temple right
[38:04] so then you have i love the scripture
[38:06] amen
[38:08] who's seeing peter
[38:10] and john about to go into the temple ask
[38:13] in alms so he's asking for money
[38:15] initially right
[38:16] and peter fastens his eyes upon him with
[38:19] john right
[38:22] and says
[38:23] look on us he says look on us amen
[38:27] he says and
[38:28] i love this
[38:30] and he gave heed so now he he he's he's
[38:34] catching what's going on he probably
[38:36] this layman probably heard what's going
[38:38] on a couple scriptures behind
[38:40] knowing what's happening in this type of
[38:42] people amen
[38:43] couple scriptures before it even talks
[38:45] about the miracles that's going on
[38:46] within this group of people this book of
[38:48] acts church amen
[38:50] he's seeing what's going on so he
[38:52] probably is hearing this and he's like
[38:53] whoa
[38:54] now i'm seeing
[38:56] he says look on us look who we are amen
[38:59] and
[39:00] i love to see the authority as well
[39:02] dad's been talking about authority the
[39:03] authority peter and john have during
[39:05] this he says
[39:07] you know he says look on us
[39:09] he says he gave heed unto them now he's
[39:11] listening he that hath an near to hear
[39:13] let him hear amen
[39:15] amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[39:18] by the word of god amen
[39:20] who's seeing
[39:22] and he gave heat unto them and now what
[39:24] happens his expectation his expectation
[39:27] has changed amen his expectation to
[39:30] receive something from them he probably
[39:32] didn't even know what he was going to
[39:33] receive right he's probably sitting
[39:35] there he probably he probably knew
[39:37] something was going to happen right
[39:39] he probably heard something like this is
[39:41] this is the people that have been have
[39:43] speaking in authority they they know who
[39:45] they are right
[39:47] and they
[39:48] they uh
[39:50] and then peter says obviously he
[39:52] he says silver and gold have i none but
[39:55] such as i
[39:56] have
[39:57] i have give iv
[39:59] in the name of jesus christ
[40:02] there's no other name amen that's more
[40:04] powerful than his name it's in his name
[40:06] that there's power amen
[40:09] praise the lord of nazareth rise up and
[40:11] walk he's speaking
[40:13] amen to the sky
[40:14] but this guy he had an expectation amen
[40:17] his expectation changed right then and
[40:19] there he's like wow this is this is it
[40:21] this is it
[40:23] could you imagine i mean
[40:25] just just bear with me here how much
[40:28] how much you can affect people's
[40:31] expectations as well
[40:33] how much how how much that can
[40:36] that can affect the people i mean you
[40:38] wonder why people just in the world come
[40:41] to you sometimes and they ask could you
[40:43] pray for this why because they may they
[40:46] probably know that something's gonna
[40:47] happen amen
[40:48] could you imagine that someone someone
[40:51] can actually their expectations can
[40:52] change based on
[40:54] your faith amen and your profession amen
[40:58] i mean they may see they may hear of a
[40:59] testimony i don't even know maybe on
[41:01] facebook and something like that that's
[41:03] like is this really true
[41:05] is this is this the god you serve
[41:07] amen
[41:08] and you know now you've struck an
[41:11] expectation amen can you imagine that
[41:15] hallelujah thank you god praise the lord
[41:17] it actually ignites you are a wildfire a
[41:21] man you are a fire and what does that
[41:23] fire do
[41:24] i remember someone saying this one time
[41:26] i believe it was zach carter if you guys
[41:28] remember him
[41:29] but he he's a good friend of ours and
[41:31] he's
[41:32] he actually says we were at one uh
[41:35] campfire and he says that a fire i may
[41:38] have mentioned this before but a fire
[41:39] actually creates its own atmosphere
[41:41] around it
[41:42] amen
[41:44] and i was just astounded by this i was
[41:45] like lord let that be me amen let that
[41:49] faith
[41:50] let that let that virtue let that those
[41:53] things be expressed that christ to be
[41:55] expressed through me
[41:56] where where i can be willing enough to
[42:00] to come to them and and have faith with
[42:02] them amen
[42:04] praise the lord amen we have we have
[42:06] that kind of power through jesus amen
[42:09] amen it's not not by eye not but
[42:12] not through me but but through him amen
[42:16] it's the christ in me just as david it's
[42:18] the christ within me greater is he that
[42:20] is in me amen
[42:22] praise the lord amen
[42:25] we'll go to uh let's see i got a few
[42:27] more points here where's my time i'm
[42:30] doing pretty good
[42:32] amen i'm probably
[42:34] just overthinking the whole time thing
[42:36] that's what i'm doing
[42:38] um so back to let's see
[42:40] so i got another quote from
[42:43] expectations it's just a small small
[42:46] little sentence here and he said every
[42:47] man
[42:48] that ever believed in god or heard god's
[42:51] voice expected him to do something
[42:55] it's just that simple phrase
[42:59] see you're
[43:00] you're you're caught in this place every
[43:03] every man that believed in god
[43:05] or heard is god's voice expecting him to
[43:07] do something you see this lame man so
[43:09] you heard his voice amen you heard his
[43:12] voice he's expecting to sit that's that
[43:14] could be the same situation as you
[43:16] tonight amen
[43:18] you you need sometimes you need an
[43:19] expectation change amen you need
[43:22] something something happened in your
[43:23] life that that may be troubling you the
[43:26] winds are blowing the storms storms are
[43:28] blowing but you need
[43:30] you need an expectation change and what
[43:32] what is where does that come i believe
[43:34] it comes by the word of god it comes
[43:36] from the word hearing that word amen the
[43:39] more we're in that word
[43:41] oh my the more
[43:42] the more we expect even more of god amen
[43:45] amen and his his expectations don't have
[43:48] any limit amen his word doesn't have any
[43:50] limit amen so expect i love what brother
[43:53] dixon was saying too i guess i'm just
[43:54] bringing all the sermons together that
[43:56] i've heard
[43:57] but brother diggs expect big things from
[43:59] god amen he's a big god
[44:02] he'll only he'll only be that big if you
[44:04] let him amen if you give him control in
[44:07] your life so let him have his way
[44:09] hallelujah
[44:11] praise the lord amen
[44:14] so he knew he was dealing with something
[44:16] different now he may have gone to his
[44:18] family for comfort before
[44:20] money for comfort worldly pleasures to
[44:23] give him some relief but now he
[44:25] recognizes that these men have something
[44:27] different
[44:29] maybe god is waiting for our
[44:30] expectations to change so we can really
[44:33] see
[44:34] what faith in god can do amen
[44:37] you wonder why people out there okay so
[44:39] that's what i see that happened again
[44:42] no one
[44:43] should
[44:45] not only should we have expectation
[44:46] aligned with the word but in right okay
[44:50] not only should we have our expectations
[44:52] lined with the word
[44:54] but in the right channel with god that
[44:55] our faith could be a tool in the process
[44:58] of someone's life
[45:00] or someone else's soul
[45:02] so yeah i've said these things so
[45:05] but if you
[45:06] so this is a few more quotes here but if
[45:08] you come tonight expecting just say lord
[45:11] i come to see you i come to to benefit
[45:14] of you
[45:15] to be healed i come for the benefit of
[45:17] my soul well i expect you to give give
[45:20] it to me because i'm here in this place
[45:22] that's dedicated to you to you and your
[45:25] glory
[45:26] and you'll just
[45:28] you'll get just what you expect that's
[45:30] right you always and you can never go
[45:32] above your expectations you'll always
[45:34] have to do that
[45:36] amen so with god i believe these
[45:38] expectations
[45:40] come to a different battleground i guess
[45:42] you want to say it these expectations
[45:44] because even having some meetings in
[45:46] brother branham's meetings you have
[45:48] people coming as critics amen and even
[45:50] for my testimony i i even
[45:53] i have even been there you know as a
[45:55] critic you know you come at the
[45:56] expectation of a critic you know but
[46:00] but why do that amen when we know
[46:04] we've seen god do it time and time again
[46:06] we know he's coming through for so many
[46:08] situations
[46:10] we see his word we can come we can
[46:12] look through any line in scripture and
[46:14] see
[46:15] these people believed amen amen these
[46:18] people believed
[46:20] we can see in brother's brain all you
[46:22] know all of his tapes you see just the
[46:24] faith that goes along with it i remember
[46:26] grandpa telling me actually one time
[46:28] one of his first sermons was crazy faith
[46:31] that was his title of one of his sermons
[46:34] faith is crazy amen to this world it is
[46:37] crazy thing amen
[46:40] so
[46:41] i mean i was just encouraged by that
[46:43] because at that even at that point in
[46:44] time there probably was
[46:46] you know
[46:48] this expectation even during the healing
[46:50] revivals and all that but their faith
[46:52] was so high i see i hear that from older
[46:54] people so much that their faith and what
[46:57] god can do was just so high it was at
[46:59] such a high place because what is it
[47:01] what is what does healing do a lot of a
[47:03] lot of it was divine healing what does
[47:06] healing do it's it's the it's the bait
[47:09] amen that's all it is the bait right
[47:12] to bring these fish in amen
[47:15] so
[47:16] let that not be the focus healing is a
[47:18] part of this you know god's kingdom it's
[47:21] a part of that let that not be the focus
[47:24] but at the same time
[47:25] don't
[47:26] don't forget the small battles god god's
[47:29] gonna heal you amen
[47:30] based on the word praise the lord
[47:33] amen
[47:34] now you now you want to have an
[47:36] expectation
[47:38] all the way from your heart soul body
[47:40] and mind
[47:41] that that god is going to give us a
[47:43] great outpouring of the holy spirit
[47:46] now i i feel that that it's it's near us
[47:48] and god is willing to give it to us amen
[47:51] he surely will amen if you come
[47:53] expecting some sometimes even for a
[47:55] service you know so i don't
[47:57] for me
[47:58] i mean we can talk about a service so
[48:00] much the real battle i believe is
[48:02] out there right real bad but you know a
[48:04] lot of times you bring it in right where
[48:06] we are amen for a service but come
[48:08] expecting come expecting your service
[48:10] amen as a song leader i'd love it if you
[48:13] come expecting more amen come expecting
[48:15] right off the bat amen it was one of
[48:17] these service a couple weeks ago where i
[48:20] i i come up here and i felt like i was
[48:22] already you know singing for like an
[48:24] hour you know and but there it seemed
[48:26] like there was just this high
[48:27] expectation amen but i mean it was just
[48:30] you know something come with
[48:31] expectations every every time you come
[48:34] in contact with this word whether you're
[48:36] reading a message whether you're
[48:38] listening to our pastor come with
[48:41] expectation right come with the
[48:43] expectation come with a question amen
[48:46] amen he sure surely he he will meet the
[48:49] expectation and do exceeding abundant
[48:51] amen
[48:52] praise the lord amen our god never fails
[48:55] i mean he's a mighty god you believe
[48:56] that tonight he's a mighty god he never
[48:59] fails
[49:00] praise the lord we have something where
[49:02] we can
[49:03] place our expectations amen
[49:06] amen thank you lord
[49:09] when god is involved you get what you
[49:11] expect
[49:13] he actually puts the choice back on the
[49:16] believer amen what are you going to do
[49:18] with this word
[49:20] as i was saying what are you going to do
[49:22] with it take it
[49:23] take it and eat it amen praise the lord
[49:26] let that word become you amen praise the
[49:29] lord
[49:30] god will be as big as you let him be in
[49:33] your life this is what makes him
[49:35] lord
[49:36] when we accept and receive his blessing
[49:39] that's what we need to do accept and
[49:41] receive it amen yeah i remember brother

[49:45] brother junior woosley when i was a
[49:47] little uh you know byc camp was such an
[49:50] awesome picture he uh he brought out

[51:17] this time anxiety that can happen like
[51:20] that amen it can it can rise up so quick
[51:23] i mean i know there's people at home

[51:45] praise the lord he said it his word says
[51:47] it this
[51:49] this is the truth
[51:51] this is the truth amen
[51:53] praise the lord
[51:56] so
[51:58] what will you do with the word amen
[52:00] that's what he asked his word lays
[52:02] dormant without vessels to hold and
[52:04] express him amen
[52:07] so his word really without us it's
[52:10] dormant amen
[52:12] how how can how can uh
[52:14] see
[52:15] um
[52:16] where was i getting to how can a tree
[52:18] grow without water
[52:20] or you know how can
[52:21] i guess what i'm saying is how can a
[52:24] i see grow
[52:26] i'm trying to get my thoughts together
[52:28] here how
[52:30] can this is what makes the lord um
[52:37] so the word lays dormant without uh
[52:39] vessels to use it so
[52:41] you know god has a spirit flowing you
[52:43] know god's poured out his spirit amen in
[52:46] the last days here right he's poured out
[52:48] his spirit but how can
[52:50] you know how can his his spirit you know
[52:53] do anything without vessels amen amen so
[52:56] you're a vessel tonight amen let go and
[52:58] let god have his way praise the lord
[53:01] amen
[53:03] how can a tree grow without water um
[53:07] get in the okay so yeah
[53:09] how can a tree grow without water or the
[53:11] sun how can its roots go deeper without
[53:14] the winds moving to
[53:16] the tree to loosen the soil i love this
[53:18] thought of revival
[53:21] see it's a revival and the christian
[53:23] walk it's revival after a vile revival
[53:26] it's it's a daily dying dying to self
[53:29] dying it's a renewing after renewing
[53:31] amen don't think that one experience is
[53:33] going to do this for you amen it's
[53:35] experience after experience after
[53:37] experience amen
[53:39] amen so don't don't uh
[53:41] this flesh like i was saying earlier in
[53:43] the in the sermon i was talking about
[53:45] just how distractions and everything can
[53:47] get you away from that expectation amen
[53:50] but
[53:52] but always seek for that renewing that
[53:54] refreshing in his holy spirit amen and
[53:56] that comes a lot of times with
[53:59] being involved in your church you know
[54:01] people can
[54:02] people
[54:03] christ uses people amen god uses people
[54:07] he uses people to encourage you so don't
[54:10] neglect the fellowship either here amen
[54:12] don't neglect the fellowship there could
[54:14] be a word spoken out there
[54:16] in that fellowship hall that you may
[54:18] need some sunday i don't know what this
[54:20] you know you may get a few things in
[54:22] this sermon but people of god and
[54:24] fellowship my that has done wonders in
[54:27] my life amen
[54:28] let the people come together when we're
[54:31] all in one accord i'll give you some
[54:33] homework just look at the first few
[54:35] chapters of the book of acts and see how
[54:36] the book of acts church operates amen
