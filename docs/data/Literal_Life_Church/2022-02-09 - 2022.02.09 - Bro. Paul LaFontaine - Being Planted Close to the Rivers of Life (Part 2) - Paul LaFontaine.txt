========================================

the lord and whose hope the lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit amen may god add its blessings to the word god bless you may be seated tonight just want to remind you for the couple's sweetheart banquet saturday night and uh saturday i think at five and if you could just let sister kendall know and make those plans we're really looking forward there's about 70 coming so it's a good turnout and we're very excited about uh what the lord has for us with brother chris and maybe some songs and different things as well so we're looking forward to that time together to just increase our love for our mates more and more through the lord so we're just looking forward to that tonight i'm taking jeremiah 17 and this scripture was sent to me after uh sunday service and i'm just being honest i didn't know that god had referred to this this way again in another book of the bible i did not know this was there but boaz sent it to me so brother boaz actually you should be preaching this because you're the one that found the scripture so we just invite you to come up right now and take the service over how about that but i thought it was very unique that the prophet jeremiah seen the same vision as david in first saw psalms 1 about a tree being planted by the rivers of living water and i thought it was amazing and there's actually another reference to it in another prophet and so when you have prophets seeing the same vision this close then you know god's trying to tell us something amen and i believe it's a vision of the bride tree when they see this tree i believe it's a vision of the bride dream our prophet in this hour seen the vision of the bride tree and he preached the bride tree and the restoration of the bride tree so these scriptures are not just little sunday school scriptures but they're actually foretelling and speaking of the believers particularly of the last day who are thriving and are planted in the right place and that are that are chosen and predestinated to walk in the word and become adopted sons and daughters of god and when they're planted in the right place then they have all these characteristics and i wanted to read it again because i was amazed how much it just elaborated a little bit more than psalms 1 and i want you to read again it says for he verse 8 shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and that's what we talked about sunday and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so it's just it just elaborates just a little bit more on what the scripture says in psalms 1. and so his roots are go have gone down close to the river the roots receive constant moisture from the river and the water and it seems that just it gives more details and i read it today in the amplified i was going to read that to you as well this way this is the way verse 8 is read in the amplified for he will be nourished like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its roots by the river and will not fear the heat when it comes but its leaves will be green and moist and it will not be anxious and concerned in the year of drought nor stop bearing fruit so i thought it was amazing that brother rap elaborated on worry so much last sunday and talked about that subject so much and here we have it right in the scripture for this believer or this tree and type of a believer showing that it will not be anxious and concerned it will not be in worry if you're planted close to the water and receiving that life source then you're not living a life of worry that you're not worried about a drought this tree is not worried about a drought coming because he doesn't have to worry about a drought he's not dependent upon those rains and we'll just get into that in just a minute but his leaves are green and moist and he will not fear the heat when it comes so this is a just amazing how this just is manifested in such a way or brought to us in such a word picture in such a revelation to show us and it should tell us this is where i want to live this is where i want to be this is god speaking of a holy ghost-filled christian this is where when he's planted in the right place this is the fruit that comes from his life and it certainly is taking away our fears it certainly is taking away our worries can you say amen and so um you know when we speak of they're just that part about no fear or no worry it's just not there in this tree even when no rain is on the outside and the rain in the bible saints rain types blessings rain types blessings so this christian is not dependent on the blessings of the lord we enjoy the blessings of the lord but we don't live on the blessings of the lord our our moisture and our are thriving and our growth comes from something deeper because we know the rains can be there but then the rains can stop and sometimes in our life the rain can stop for a long time and that's called a drought and so if this tree was dependent upon that rain of blessings then it would give out in the drought it would be nervous it would become anxious it would begin to die but because it's not dependent on the blessings of the lord and our prophet taught us that the blessings is different than the power of god he elaborated on those things to show us so that we won't be dependent on some just blessings because blessings we can in life we can have we can have things that we think is the blessings of god but sometimes our trials can be blessings in disguise and sometimes when we have a drought if we're rooted in the lord the drought can be a good time to grow as well only in this type of tree now can you say man a tree that's got its roots way down is that we find in a drought sometimes you're through trials and winds and the things that happen on the outside back to you those things can actually be when your roots are deep actually it can make your roots go deeper so what a wonderful thing to see that but people actually depend people live dependent on the blessings of god uh is everything and when everything is right in their life and when the rain is falling and when everything is good then they're happy when everything's working out all right then they can be happy it when everything is just coming together just so well and lining up so well and that's the times we thank god it's just all lining up good and we're happy about it and we thank god for it and we should do that but see growth in the lord maturity in the lord is that when that's not lining up just right and we don't understand why it's not lining up we still are rooted by the tree the tree is rooted by the rivers of water it's not like we're going to die from that it's not like we're losing our joy from that because we know during those times we're a predestinated son of god anyway god's going to direct us anyway god is going to keep us anyway and so people live dependent on the blessings of the lord and i'm not against the blessing i love the blessings of god but a lot of times it's what we view as blessings it's what we view as god's blessings and a lot of times blessings we view it is if things are just going well and coming in line and perfect can you say man so we have to really become a deeper christian to realize what is god's blessings because we look at it that we got a lot of money and we got all the money to pay bills and we look at it as far as financial price prosperity and it is sometimes sometimes we can be just as blessed spiritually and not have a dime to our name and you won't hear that on any tv preachers i guarantee you that it's god's will for some people to be poor and i believe i'm quoting the prophet there it's god's will because we can't view our spiritual life like a lot of the tv preachers tell us we can't view all of our spirituality where we stand with the lord on just finances we can't view it just as that we can't see i'm blessed if that's happening and i'm not blessed we can't view it carnally like that because we realize god he can prosper us but the most important prosperity we receive as a believer is where we're at spiritually and if we lose sight of that we'll view his blessings by natural carnal things are we listening tonight so then i can be if everything's going right then i'll serve the lord that's how some people feel about it if i feel good then i'll go to church you think that you think that's not true people go to church if they feel if everything's happened good for the week and they feel good and they're feeling healthy then we're going to be at church it's it's about feelings it's about emotions if everything's going good with my job then i'll come and sing and open my heart and worship the lord you really should come and worship with more strength towards the lord when you lose your job see this is counter culture isn't it i won't be there tonight brother paul i lost my job and if i lost my job i'll probably lose everything and i don't know where this is going to go so i won't be there i just don't even feel like worshiping now you might chuckle at that but that's the type of conversations in 30 years of pastoring i've had that sometime and sometimes i have to bite my tongue to not say it and correct it and say no if you've gone through this or you lost a loved one or you're going through a depressing time the very place best place you could be is in the presence of the lord you're letting satan rob you of what you really should be doing that's the times we call out on god that's the time job says you know what i don't have a clue what's going on and my wife's telling me to curse god and die but i'm going to go to church and i'm going to worship and i can you say man i'm a little bit angry here but i'm not going to stop my worship before god because the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord that's the time to worship the lord but we can't view his blessings as being the things that come from the outside and this tree is basically saying this believer is saying that i am not afraid of a drought in my life because i am not dependent on the moisture of those rains i'm dependent on the moisture coming from the river the drought hits and there's no blessings and if there's rain in our life it's all good but you see if the drought hits that's when a drought can be a real test it can bring worry if you're dependent on those blessings and this tree is not worried about a drought if it rains or if it doesn't i'm good why because he's planted by the source of moisture it's not that it comes from the top but the roots are way down deep connected to the moisture of the river if there if there's money if there's no money we pray we worship god amen if people treat me right or people treat me wrong we we serve god we worship god if i'm in pain or i'm not in pain it doesn't change my worship before the lord if the job ends or if they like me a lot at work it doesn't matter it doesn't waver can you say amen because i'm not looking to the outside things going good or going bad can you say man i'm not dependent on that and that's not dictating my joy i say that because for all of us we might as well admit that things of life affect and take away our joy and we should never let outside rain or not rain or whatever take away our joy don't let nobody steal your joy don't let anything steal your joy you say well i lost it no you still got it but you're just letting it being clouded over by thinking something was gonna go this certain way i thought the job was gonna i thought it was gonna go this way and so i'm just not happy and and you know you can say with trying to be careful not to offend tonight you can can say it's very much like a little baby who's only happy when it gets with what it wants and when it doesn't get when a two-year-old does not get what she wants she can turn on you pretty quick he can turn on you pretty quick i mean i just i i get in trouble so i gave ellie a sucker where's she at she gone i gave her a sucker in the office because when we left from the house i had to take her to church tonight and we had to get in the truck so this sucker had to be taken away so this smiley girl had it taken away and she changed to a different countenance and so then i thought well let's give we got in the office i gave her another one and then that had to be taken away from her but it's kind of funny to watch because this is christians sometimes this is christian sometimes these are baby christians and they can change in a moment they're so happy it's so smiling something changes in their life somebody doesn't treat them well somebody posted something that they didn't like and in a moment's time their countenance changed and they become this different person that's babyhood that's a baby christian we let things affect our emotions so much family problems and family issues and and marriage issues and god is looking for that consistent being planted staying filled with the word of god staying with our mind on the word of god so that just doesn't bump us around as much and we're not dependent on the blessings or if the drought comes we're still receiving the from the source we have a source and if we're connected to it it never ends that's right it never gives up praise the lord amen so now let me just take this a little a different step here tonight i won't be long but i want you to be listening real well i just finishing this up from sunday if you don't mind and you won't have the quotes tonight up i didn't have time to get them to them i didn't want to i want to give them the night off so just be listening close to a few quotes that i have so now you know that even a good plant as we talked about sunday we're talking about the tree plant you know that even a good plant taken away from water or not getting water can start withering can start getting sticky can start getting brown leaves instead of as it speaks in scripture here of a flourishing a leaf being green we know that a plant can get dried up we know a plant can become ugly when it was beautiful before we know a plant can get hard instead of soft instead of gentle the petals can become gentle but they can become hard and it's all because of a lack of water if that's true in the natural it's true in the spiritual it can be shriveled up it could be it can be closed and look dead and eventually become dead and so i i think sometimes we can see pretty good when a person is not near the water of life i think it becomes pretty quickly evident when someone is not planted close to the rivers of living water there's a clear evidence of someone being distant from the spirit and from the word and feeding on other things i'm going to say it again it becomes pretty quickly evident in our if it does for a plant like some of our plants within just a few days you can see them shrivel up and they've got brown edges on some of the petals and that's for lack of water sometimes if that happens in the natural that's what happens to your life in the spiritual and it becomes real clear in your life in my life is that when we get a little bit too far away from the waters of life then we start to have these characteristics sometimes to show that we're distant from the word we're distant from uh from the spirit of god and we're feeding on other things usually you can tell what a person is feeding on it shows up in the attitude it shows up in the reactions hey how you doing i'm fine [Laughter] i'm doing fine leave me alone these these characteristics of getting edgy and bitter and angry and feeling your feelings are sensitive and you're easily offended for a believer and you say well no believers act like that all right for a believer it's a direct giveaway that you have become disconnected because you will never get a a a a pattern of those results you might have an instant moment where you get angry because that's anger's a part of us it's an emotion can you say amen remember the bible says be angry and sin not our emotions can rise up over things even over sin can you say amen but you see now he says be angry and sin not it's where that anger goes we can have a moment when we see patterns popping up in a life we know that someone in our own lives we know that you can never be completely connected and feeding on the word of life and the spirit of life and staying in there every day and have all of these patterns of sensitivity and easily offended and outraged anger and bitterness and being edgy all the time and becoming bitter even towards god there is no way you get that fruit from a person that's connected to the source of life there's no way you get it doesn't james say that a tree cannot put forth this fruit in that it can't happen it can't bring forth these different things it's not to be so if you're connected to the water of life and you stay connected there are fruits that come from that and so this isn't complicated this isn't complicated we have his word and i want to get into just a little bit we may not have time tonight but you know god told israel when he received the word when he gave the word to moses on mount sinai that's a very signific is where they were in mount sinai and the word came to the prophet it was such a pivotal point for israel and god actually after it happened they received the word to live by he kept pointing them back to that and that was a pivotal point for them but when he talked to them in deuteronomy 6 which we only have time to read tonight when he said it said to them when he spoke to them after they'd received the word it wasn't just they received the word and it wasn't just that they would uh that they would have the word but he said now i'm gonna warn you when you come into the land the first thing you you should give all of your heart to the word of god and you should meditate upon it day and night you should teach it your to your children you should put it upon the doorpost of your house you should put it upon here you should put it and so so you should become saturated with the word of god they could say well we've got the word from a prophet that's enough but to god it wasn't enough because he says when you get into the promised land a couple things will happen you're going to prosper you're going to have goodly lands and guess what if you keep your eyes on that you're going to forget my precepts you're going to forget me so in order not to forget me this word can't just be on tablets this word has to be in your heart every day do you get it and god's saying that you know teach your children from the time they're young teach your grandchildren get it in front of them post it on the door post have the word up everywhere talk about it he says talk about it in your home constantly why is god saying this we've got the word from a prophet that's all we need no it wasn't all you need you've got to get that word integrated into your life you've got to get that word into your mind you've got to get that word into your soul you've got to get it in your spirit and you've got to keep it in your spirit for two reasons when you prosper you tend to forget god listen god knows human nature i said god knows human nature and when people prosper with blessings they tend to forget the precepts of god so the first reason he says you have to keep it you have to integrate it into your life every day speak about it teach it to your children let it be the forefront of your thoughts the second reasons he says so that you won't be overtaken with idols because when your heart gets distant and when your heart is away from the word you're more susceptible to idol worship and god says i am one lord and i want you to be single in your worship towards me that heart beling belongs to me and he says i want you to serve me with all your heart soul mind and strength there's only one way to serve god and that's all of you and god said that because he knows your heart and the heart can be easily swayed by other gods and other things to worship brother paul i don't worship any other gods tonight you don't you don't you have to be careful that because our heart can be swayed to worshiping and giving our attention and given our all and giving our heart to something else and eventually our worship to something else and god said i'm a i've got an exclusive i want an exclusive relationship and i want all my worship from your heart to come to me i am one lord there's not three gods there's not four gods there's a and he doesn't want you sharing the worship of the depths of your heart with other things so that's the reason he warned him and i thought i mentioned that we'll go into it more at another time but this is the reason why we can't live on feelings but we have to be rooted in the word of god and we know when someone is away and so now i'm just going to bring up israel in that wilderness experience we realized they ran out of water and many times the prophet refers to the time when they ran out of water and typed it and showed is that that's in our lives when we when we don't have water coming to our lives he said israel they got to murmuring there in the wilderness and fussing and carrying on cut the water supply off and maybe that's the ma what's the matter with the church tonight doing too much fussing and grumbling around the water supply is cut off you know i travel around the world a lot and one of the most stickiest nastiest places to try to lay down is in the desert everything there has got a sticker on it you know why everything every every kind of little old weed's a cactus you can't lay down nowhere it's sticking you the reason of it is that it ain't got no water water makes it soft where there's lots of water you don't have any thorns and thistles where there's lots of water and i tell you brother you take an old church that's dry in its bone and no holy ghost in it and no salvation and no divine healing no power of god no shouting no joy and it's always this oh she done this and he done this and he done that sticker sticker sticker sticker and what you need is a good old-fashioned outpouring a gusher of the holy ghost hallelujah and soften up a little bit amen that means so be it amen's to be so be it branham tabernacle needs a good dose of that too that's right oh that is right brother brian gets pretty excited here and he goes amen oh i'm having a good time up here my clothes fit me just exactly right brother higa bathum my clothes fit right my collar's not too big my shirt fits just feels good even my wife's not here and i can just have a glorious time oh don't tell her no i just added that and i thought it was comical that obviously she comments on his clothes a lot but he says all my clothes are fitting right his wife's not there to criticize he's having a good time and then don't tell her i said that oh my i'm so happy how can i he says you're happy i said sure i'm happy how can i keep from being happy and know what i know how can you keep from being happy when you know what you know amen christ saved me fill me with the holy ghost gave me a ticket to heaven i'm just having a big time he said hallelujah so you know even these things that he talked about and this joy you can't do it unless you're connected to the water supply way down deep and when you're connected that's when it brings joy that's when you don't let nothing steal your joy away from you you don't let someone else who said something to you steal your joy make you depressed bring you down you can't let people control you like that you can't let the devil control you like that you can't let the devil steal your joy so quickly don't let them steal it at all you let people's comments on the internet and even face to face which they don't do much of it face to face today but their little comments wonder what he's trying to say by that wonder what she's saying by that i think she met me with that and so you let it steal your joy and your happiness and being able to enjoy the day because you've let somebody else's comments control you and i say don't let anybody steal your joy amen so there's a wonderful message that the prophet preached back i can't remember just what year it is um i think it's in 1958 but it's a message i uh commented on sunday it's called the vine and where to plant it i believe it's called and he reads the scripture in psalms 80 and verse 8 and it says thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou has cast out the heathen and has planted it so now that's when i said sunday brother brahm says in that message israel was a good vine but she was planted in the wrong place and so now that is a whole subject within itself to look at our lives and realize there's a lot of good vines there's a lot of good people but it's not just that you're a good vine well they really have a heart for god and they have a love for god praise the lord that's wonderful but if they're planted in the wrong influence the wrong atmosphere if they're not planted in christ can you say man you see they're not being their full potential they're limited and sometimes feeding on things that you shouldn't feed on you might be a good vine but you you can't stay there you're going to have to be planted away from those things sometimes a relationship can be such a hindrance hindrance to somebody who loves god somebody wants to go forward with god a girl that needs to go forward with god and wants to go forward but they don't realize they're just planted in a they're positioned in a relationship that's not right but it's not just that it's all other things of life sometimes you're planted in the wrong church sometimes you're planted in the wrong place so these are good people i want you to see how brother branham words it so so much in this message the vine and where to plant it and he says israel was a good vine but she was planted in the wrong place in egypt egypt represents the world egypt represents denominations can you say amen so whether it's denominations or whether it's the world we can never thrive when we're hanging around things of the world we can never thrive when we're feeding on things of the world we can never become all the way we're supposed to be in christ you might be a good vine but you're planted in the wrong place you're positioned in the wrong place these things are so real to life but i like how he words it and i'm going to read a little bit in the message and then we'll be wrapping it up here tonight it's something like today we've got in the land many great and fine believers and they are mixed in all denominational churches they come from different denominations and different walks of life and that's why in my ministry i have never tried at any time to run down any certain person or any certain denomination because in them all is good people they are called and chosen people could you have condemned israel i was in egypt could you have condemned israel while i was in egypt they just got off the wrong foot they were planted in the wrong place and their sins had separated them from god and they were planted in egypt and that's the way many people are in churches today good people just planted in the wrong place now if a real believer is brought to christ and he's planted in some great denomination that doesn't believe in miracles and signs and wonders of the lord that person may be a genuine christian a catholic a baptist a presbyterian jehovah witness something else in that church a genuine vine of god but the denominational creed cuts off that vine that life of that vine it can't bear its fruit and usually what fruits you get off of a vine that stunted or not in good ground is bad fruits it'll come forth like apples and be naughty and worm eaten apples that are naughty and worm eaten and those are not good apples it's because a subject it becomes subject to insects a good healthy vine doesn't even need to be sprayed it's healthy enough to throw off all of its enemies so it is with a born-again christian you don't have to be spraying them all the time and patting them on the back they are spiritually healthy enough to throw off all of the scandal of the world they are living off the true nourishment a tree sometimes that or a plant that's been into the desert places and doesn't have sustaining moisture it'll bear little naughty fruit and it doesn't look like the fruit that should come from its spine my brother my sister that's what it is with the churches today the sinner comes in notice this now the sinner comes in after maybe at home they came under conviction they go and read their bible and then they go to a church and instead of finding great luscious apples or grapes the life of the lord jesus being reproduced in the church it finds little naughty worm eaten denominational petty thoughts i would just say respectfully that sometimes they go to churches within our own ranks and that's when a setter finds he doesn't see a thriving holy ghost filled church he sees a denominational system anyway because the people are bound and the right fruit isn't coming forth there's nothing to eat on there we baptist and they come in there and they hear we baptist we got it all we got it we're methodists we got it the arms of god reach from sea to sea and from short ashore and can save to the uttermost but that's what we find in places we've this division we've got a monopoly on the truth we've got the truth over here we've got it taking place our doctrine it's the right way it's the only way to come you might be believe the message but you've got to come our way to do it where does all that come from it's a denominational manner it's a denominational way and i can tell you that a sinner that's looking for the life and the reality of god does not want to leave one denomination and come to another atmosphere like that they're looking for the life of the bride tree they're looking for the life of the fruit of god can you say amen they're looking for deliverance they're looking for the spirit of god unhindered unrestricted can you say amen god help us in message churches god help us to get a hold of the life of this thing so that we don't become another system that people are disappointed with but that we actually be the church of the living god that we're supposed to be hallelujah how many raise your hand tonight say god let me be that kind of tree god let me be that plight of a life-giver in this hour people that are hungry for something different shouldn't come and see the same thing they're looking for the realities of god and it's like david said in psalms 1 he said blessed is the man that will not join up with these scoffers and ungodly people not connect with ungodly people not set in the seat with them you know scoffers that say the david's of miracles has passed and the baptism in the holy spirit is just a make-believe blessed is the man that will not do that blessed is the man that will stand forth from such a thing and they don't want to mix those together and you cannot mix those things together blessed is the man who won't assemble himself and unto one of those things that deny the power of the lord the bible said come out from among such for the day will come when they will be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away from such separate yourself the blessed man separates himself from the things of the world and the scoffers and the influences he separates himself from it so he can be a tree he should be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water god has put him in a choice spot his fruit shall not wither he'll bring forth his leaves and fruits in the season watch how david worded that this man is blessed he will be planted not just set out you know i like seeing anything that's been planted not just set out i'd like to see something planted and israel egypt was not planted they were just set out it wasn't their original home ground and a man that's a christian that rests his eternal destination upon some denominational creed he's not in his right place he was born to be free and a child of god to worship god but he's under a creed he can't bring forth his fruit yet something in him is longing to do it he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water rivers plural water singular many rivers coming into one channel in other words he'll be like a man in the scripture that believes all of god's word where the power and the nine spiritual gifts can flow through one god into his innermost being people don't believe in shouting the thing of it is they haven't got a spiritual joy and the joys of the waters of life can flow through that's a whole lot like the that's the matter with branham tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world had bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth that's what's the matter with our nation that's what's the matter with our churches they have no joy and the joy of the lord has departed as was written one time in the scripture the hebrew word ichabod which means the presence of the lord is departed that's over our churches because we left off the original foundation and placed ourselves into creeds and denomination and permitted the things of the world to dry up our experience with god listen to it tonight we permit the things of the world to dry up our experience with god we can't do that we must stand against it we're not called to be a dried up tree you're not called to be a dried up christian you have to separate from the things of the world to become a thriving holy spirit filled the joys of the lord experiencing more and more of the joy of the lord how many want it tonight so the presence of the lord to bar that's over our churches because we left off he said go with me to arizona and let me take you to the deserts which i roam so many years everything in the desert has a sticker on it any little plant you come to you don't get near it it'll stick you it's always got its stickers right out ready to stick anything that comes near it what's the matter what made it a sticker is because it had no water that's what dried it up that sticker is a leaf rolled up for the lack of water it becomes a sticker can you imagine what he's saying now that's supposed to be a leaf that's green and thriving and it rolls itself up so hard and so sticky that it actually how many has ever been stuck by a cactus before yep ryan for sure in arizona you see and but can you imagine that's supposed to be a leaf he's saying and that's how hard it can get that's how pokey it can get i'm using a word i use with my granddaughter pokey and my daughter she called my beard pokies that's what a beard is pokies dad you got your pokeys kyle you got a lot of pokeys can you imagine now something so hard that's become such a it's become a thorn and it's intended to be a gentle green leaf but because of the lack of water it's the way christians can become in their attitudes he said when he gets away from he said the church and thus before the lack of water becomes a sticker and thus when the church today when they get away from the fountain of life when it gets away from the joys of salvation when it gets away from the lord god then that person becomes a sticker always finding fault sticking no sooner you come and then i'm press the bear i'm presbyterian i'm methodist i'm so-and-so i'm in this doctrine of the message don't talk to me about that stuff a sticker it has no fruits you take that same plant cactus and put it into a land for a few generations where there's plenty of water and that sticker will unfold and will become a soft leaf bearing fruit what's the matter with the church today it's been set into a denomination that has put denominational creeds and bound it no joy just a sprinkle now and then of a little revival to hold it what it needs to be is to come out from among scoffers and unbelievers and be planted by the rivers of water can you say amen praise the lord many many more times he referred to this tree planted by the water and all the characteristics that come from a believer that gets himself away from the water flow and all of a sudden his attitude changes and all this fussing and stewing and bitterness and all these things he said it over and over again i don't need to read all the quotes the type is there the shadow is there when we are not connected and our roots down deep close to where the source of life the one source of life we can have the same characteristics in our life we're not predestined to be away from the source of life we're not predestinated to be going off somewhere where there's not a source where you could be under the fivefold ministry i do not believe that that would be the will of god for a believer to move somewhere where there's no source to be fed by the fightful ministry that can't be the will of god and this whole tree thing that can't be the will of god but we are to be planted in christ and that can be anywhere i understand that to be planted in the revealed word for the hour christ and be there and close to it and feeding on it that can be anywhere but then the same bible that you read gave a fivefold ministry can you say amen those that would feed us nourish us by the word of god those that god would use as angels of the church can you say amen there's seven church age messengers seven angels and then under that he gave he gave gifts unto men of a fifo ministry and staying close to that will be the the life source that the life of the word comes through can you say about and he says for the perfecting of the church for the work of the ministry for the edifying and the building up of the body of christ he gave that fivefold ministry for them i'm thankful for him i never would be where i'm at today except the god called fifo ministry that god has provided in the last days i say thank god for them i know there's a lot of counterfeits but there's when there's a counterfeit there's real fivefold ministry there's gods called men and they'll lead us onto a rapture can you say amen they'll take us onto a rapture someday he said if you give your pastor respects he'll help lead you through to the other side that's a pretty important position not as a man but his office he'll lead you through to the other side that's wonderful so now i would like us to read something here at the last few verses of the bible if you would and i'm going to close this and i'm going to connect with that thought that brother abraham says that a sinner and a thirsty person comes into the church and all of a sudden they don't they don't find they can't eat from the fruit of that and they should be able to but i want you to notice this theme is at the very last chapter of your bible and um we'll just read it here we first of all in chapter 22 we have the pure river of life and we the water of life verse 1 says and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb now if that's true this remember this is the book of revelation so this is symbolism and if that's true in the the natural someday that there'll be a pure river flowing it's only a reflection of the pure spiritual river that god has had coming from his throne how many believe that you're you're a believer today because you begin to drink from something coming from the throne of god he sent his messengers from the throne of god he sent his word and through that word the the fresh water of god the river of life flowed through those messengers and you're here today because you were able to drink from and plant your life close to that and so here's this subject in the last chapter of the bible and it's the river of life the river of life isn't that wonderful if you skip ahead all the way down to verse 18 the last few words for i testify unto every man that heareth my words let me just go back a little bit back to um verse 16 i jesus has sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root in the offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that is heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely who is the last per the ones speaking to this world this bride tree who is the last one speaking saying come it's the spirit and it's the bride it does not say and i mean this respect that the last thing is that it's a prophet and the spirit no the last thing and the spirit and the bride are the ones saying come on that's why he could say that thus saith the lord is in the bride she has thus saith the lord and she knows what he wants done with the word can you say amen his word will be in his bride she will be the final voice to the final age and you can preach that all day long you can believe it that's fine but unless you have that river of life in you you can't say come to anybody else but i'm here to tell you there is a people in the face of the earth and she's so ta so filled with the spirit and so connected to these rivers of life that she can say anyone anybody who's thirsty let them come i can point you to the river i tell you a person could not say that unless they were connected themselves to this river of life they know they're confident they know i have been connected i have been planted by this river of life i'm receiving from the source so i can confidently say come if you're thirsty come i can show you where it's at it's the spirit and the bride the last voice the final voice to a final age where the world is looking for all sorts of uh places to go and the things of the world and the new movie coming out in sports and and and and and just feeding on all kinds of things trying to satisfy that there's only one river of life there might be many rivers of one source of life one water can you say amen and here's a woman that's so connected to it she can confidently say come on the spirit of the spirit and the bride are saying come yes that's the spirit and the prophet see this thing has trickled down can you say amen and it's about the prophet it's about the prophet it's about the prophet in revelations 10. it's about the seventh angel then and then the seals and then he goes he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that becomes a significant thing because god's gonna pour out and speak things through that seven angel and then it says when he shall begin to sound so you have the voice of the seventh angel but then when he shall begin to sound there's a sound that goes from that voice so it just trickles down and trickles down until he says go in to john type of the bride go and take the little book now that you have it it's been handed to your prophet it's been preached to these people on earth bride take this book and eat it right take the book and eat it and when she does the bible says she is the one at the end thank you for keeping it up it's the spirit and the bride that say come now to me somebody who somebody who doesn't have it somebody who's not connected to it they're not going to be saying come they're actually going to be have their wall up they're going to be hiding isn't that interesting somebody that's ashamed of it they haven't met the source of life yet i'm ashamed of this message i know i want to keep it hidden i don't want anybody to know that i believe it but see here's the bride she's she's a she's a tree that's planted she's so full of life she's so confident she's unafraid there's no worry there's no fear she has thus saith the lord and knows what to do with it and she's not pushing people away she's not closed she's not fearful can i get an amen here tonight this bride tree is not pushing people away from it this pride tree is not hiding and going underground this pride tree is not ashamed of the message of jesus christ this right tree is not on doing searches on google and trying to is this really true or not and just trying to do no no she's already connected and planted to this river and she's not fearful to tell people she doesn't have any walls up she's not hiding and she is saying i am completely tied to this river of life and she is saying by the spirit and with the spirit if you're thirsty come and drink blessed be the name of the lord for i testify unto every man verse 18 that the hearing of the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add to unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man take away from the words of this book of this prophecy god shall take his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen last proclamation of the lord jesus surely i come quickly the last voice is that he is speaking through his bride saying whoever is thirsty come whosoever will let him take the water of life freely that's right so what is this thing about deciding who's going to receive it and who's not going to receive it the same jesus that said in the gospels whosoever will now he's saying he's still saying it through the bride and in the wedding supper when the first ones were called all those were supposedly ones that would be invited to this great feast how many remember the parable and they were invited and with one one accord they all begin to make excuses i can't be there i won't be there i have i have bought a cow i bought a piece of land i bought an organic cow i got to stock up some meat i won't be able to make it to the feast this is the invitation to the king's feast and they're turning it down because their life's not worthy of the gospel they're turning it down for life things i've got to go over and get an organic cow i have bought a piece of land and i cannot come the third one was that i have married a wife he's the only one that had kind of an ex no he didn't have an excuse i've married a wife enough with all my worries with that and all i just don't have time anymore for the lord because i've got married and i've got to provide for my family and i got we just don't have time to be there brother paul and they all begin to make excuses for why they couldn't come to the invitation and so god said all right then call the lame call the halt call the blind open up the doors if they won't do it they're supposed to be the ones that receive it but if they're making excuses going to live that way there's going to be some new ones come and i'll tell you they really need it they really need it and then they said their house is still empty there's still some room to come in the invitation and he says all right go out into the byways go out in there go and whosoever will let them come i'll give them this invitation and others started to show up at church that we wouldn't expect to be there well these aren't the normal ones it's coming from the other churches you might look over in another seat and see somebody you don't know it's been kind of comical lately it's the people meet people in the bathroom the church and they said well where do you go to church where i go to church here i haven't met you yet somebody said that happened recently you might look over and you see somebody my they're a stranger they may not look all together right but i'm telling you the third poll and the final call is the bride saying who's ever thirsty let them come and drink we have access to the source of life don't be surprised of who shows up because the final call is the bride is saying come and the final calls go out into the byways and hedges and have them invite them to come and the final god did not get rid of i'm going to close god did not get a rid of the whosoever will even with all of our truth of predestination that god knows who he's going to call god knows who his elect are but the problem with too much of that doctrine in the people in the message is they start selecting who's going to come who will come and if they turn you down the first time well they're they're not the seed of god we don't have a right to do that we're supposed to say come we have the source of life in the word of god and we're not and we're supposed to say whosoever will let him come he's still saying whosoever will you think well that's just a a baptist talker that's not a back response that's a scriptural doctrine and the last thing he says is the bride will be proclaiming if you're thirsty and you need something to drink i'm planted by that water of life and because i'm planted there and connected and my roots go way deep i can say to you come and drink whosoever will that uncommon drink none of this i don't think they're a type of person that would receive this i just i don't know about that particular one and there might be a lot of surprises when we get on the other side of people that make it and we didn't think ever was going to make it and as brother brown people who didn't make it we thought for sure we're going to be there my i can't believe that brother bram says there'll be a lot of surprises on that day because you know what it's going to come down to not what church you're a part of not just say i'm in the message movement it's not going to come down to any of that did you take your tree and was planted by this source of life and whoever is really thirsty they're looking for it today they're looking for it they're tired of religion they're tired there are some people even weary of some of the facets that happen in our own ranks they're tired of it i just got a book from somebody and they were writing about it but my my feeling about it is that the person just tired of all the different denominational spirits that come in our own rings oh god help us this thing is the simplicity of jesus christ paul said i fear lest any would beguile you as the serpent did eve from the simplicity of jesus christ this message is the simplicity of jesus christ but men have complicated it men have complicated it i just want to be a pure fruit-bearing tree of god that can say don't complicate this thing if you're thirsty come and drink come and drink amen come to the water and drink can you stand together with me do you love the lord tonight praise the lord thank you brother boaz for giving me that scripture thank you for
