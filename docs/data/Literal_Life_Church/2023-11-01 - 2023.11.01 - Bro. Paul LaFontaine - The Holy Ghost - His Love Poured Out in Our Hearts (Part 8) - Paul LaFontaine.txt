and what God has given us in this time and what he's doing in our lives and service by service and Sunday was such a wonderful service the the last couple Sundays the Lord just really has really been real to us and we appreciate that so much good to have you all out tonight and and uh we know that greater portion of the congregation listens in streaming I think it's 50 or 60% drive at least an hour and a half or more and so a lot of them are listening we greet you all tonight in your homes or wherever you're at but we're glad for the ones that are here as well and uh just to be in Fellowship around the word of God we're glad to have Emily Hammer visiting tonight God bless you good to have you with us makes you feel welcome and you make her feel welcome tonight wanted to say tomorrow night we have a courageous Bible study for the brothers who want to get together at 7:30 here at the church and it's been a real good study just uh looking at the attributes of true fathers and just leaving a legacy uh for your family it's just been real good good study so we'll be here tomorrow night doing that at 7:30 and then don't forget on Sunday it's daylight savings time which I I enjoy it because I get an extra hour of sleep Saturday nights an extra hour to study as well but uh uh one thing about it if you forget it that's why I'm reminding you if you forget it um you're going to be to church early Sunday morning which wouldn't be a bad thing at all I mean you're not going to get anybody uh if you come an hour early the pastor is going to be going wow this is great praise the Lord so uh in the spring when you have daylight s then you're late an hour for church if you miss it but but we're announcing announcing it tonight so you don't miss it let's let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 in our Bibles and we'll do a study together tonight in the word of God I know that we're hungry for his word and uh we live by it Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word most of us have had supper whatever you ate we had spaghetti at home and so but Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so we spiritually live by his word and feed on his word so we're happy to have that tonight and be able to present it to you and we're going to read from Matthew chapter 24 and start reading in verse four and the setting here is some actually some prophecy of Jesus as he talks about our times and our conditions of our time there's several places that he talks about that but I want to just hone in on this section here on Wars uh verse four of chapter 24 and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many so we learn something about the end time that Jesus said and that is it'll be a time of deception there'll be many false Christ come and false anointed ones and faults that are meant to deceive people so uh I always like to say though that if there's false Christ if there's something false there has to be a real for them to make the false off of Amen so uh you can't have a counterfeit dollar unless you have a real dollar for it to go off of so thank God that we have the the real living Christ here tonight the word uh this is not a deception but it's the real Christ and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places now it doesn't take very much discernment to know this is exactly what's going on in our times the last 40 50 years and especially the last 10 years what Jesus said is happening before our very eyes and these are all the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another what a time to live in and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many so you have false Christ now you have false prophets if you have false prophets there has to be something real for them to make that off of verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved how many wants to endure until the end if it puts it in there somebody's going to endure all this Wars rumors of wars being hated can you say person persecution but somebody's going to endure it Jesus said he that shall endure to the end shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come now I'd like to add one more scripture before we sit down because I'll refer refer to it at the end if you don't mind one more in Romans chapter 5 and verse 5 just one verse there because we want to plant that in our minds so we can have in our minds for this study tonight Romans chap 5 and verse 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us I want to read it again hope maketh not ashamed in other words that means the hope and the promise of God you will never be disappointed now are we disappointed in governments today are we disappointed with politics are we you disappointed that Nations Rising against Nation uh do people disappoint you there's a lot of things that disappoint us but the promise of God will never disappoint you it says it says here in verse 5 we just finished Romans 5 verse 5 I reading again hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is poured out shed abroad in our hearts by what by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us father we pray you'll bless your word tonight may we we stand behind it Lord with all of our hearts may we trust it father I pray that Lord you will Minister and you show up tonight and show your presence among us we pray we've worshiped you we've given our hearts to you Lord and just to express how much we love you tonight that's what worship is all about Lord now you come and just speak through your word and teach us something father and stabilize us in your word tonight we pray we pray give that you'll you'll get glory for all that's taking place here tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated there's several places that Jesus is specific of the conditions for our time and that is the last days and so here is he gets very specific about certain things and uh I'm glad tonight that I can say that I'm not in the dark about what's going on in the news and we're not in the dark because Jesus speaks of it here Jesus knew what was going to happen and Jesus prophesies the people that are going to live live in the end times this is what they're going to experience and so we're not in the dark how many are glad tonight you're not in the dark about what's going on uh sometimes it brings fear sometimes we're scared but we're not in the dark because the word tells us this is exactly what would take place and so one part of our security though is knowing that our Lord warned us of all this that's happening in the world that's that's I want to talk about security a little bit tonight and different things but one part of our security is the Lord already warned us the Lord already said it the Lord has already proclaimed what's taking place right now and so that brings a security to me that God knows what's going on God knew from the foundation of the world he knew the wars and rumors of wars he knew Israel would be at War right now God knew all that I didn't know that but God knew that God said it in his word so it brings a security to me tonight to know without any shadow of a doubt that our Lord knows what's going on and then he speaks it in his word and it makes it all all the more comforting but I want to hone in on tonight this part about wars uh this is what I've been reading about because we know that we're in war now in the Middle East and it's it seems to be getting more tense and so I've been thinking about that it's it's actually burdened me quite a bit to see this because it's so much a part of end time events as we know the war is not so much around any other area of the world we know the Ukraine war is going on and but we see then when it happens around the Middle East then then prophecy starts to play in even though Jesus said there'll be Wars and R rumors of wars there'll be many wars begin to take place and they'll accumulate many earthquakes these different things they'll accumulate they'll get they'll multiply but when we have the war taking place where it's at now and possibly growing then any Bible reader knows that there's something significant about this because there's too many prophecies that talk about this mounting and ending in a war around the Middle East and surrounding Israel so now that's very important to to us but uh Jesus says here that uh about the wars you will hear of it and that it that in itself sometimes just hearing of War can be unsettling to us how many would say Amen just hearing of War can be unsettling to the individual it is unsettling and uh then then Jesus says you shall hear of Wars you shall hear rumors of wars but then he says but see that you're not troubled about it amen see that your heart is not troubled so so living in the middle of this and hearing or watching it on the news or seeing these things take place it it can bring the reason Jesus said that is that it can bring a troubled heart but Jesus is saying I don't want you to have a troubled heart I don't want you to live in fear now tonight I want to get to the reason why Jesus saying that because if our Lord says don't be troubled when you hear these things happen don't be nervous don't be afraid that our Lord has to provide some type of source that our hearts would be calmed during this time I would say that to the Lord Lord if you said don't be troubled then what are you going to give me so I won't be troubled because if I'm on my own my heart's scared my heart's troubled the wars and rumors of wars and all the conditions and the and the things mounting up in the in the world conditions the way they are your heart is going to be troubled but our Lord says a as we see it don't let your heart be troubled so if our Lord says don't be troubled in other places he says it many times let not your hearts be troubled let not now Jesus must be living himself in a place of perfect faith that even when he hit certain persecutions and pressure was coming on him and there's so many incidences in the four gospels that we could go to now but Jesus lived in a realm of perfect Faith he was calm all the time he never got up upset at what was happening to him Jesus was on a ship one time and there was a big storm and all the disciples are scared to death you know what Jesus is doing he's sleeping he's sleeping during a storm and the disciples wake him up and said Lord don't you care that there's a storm we're all going to die here there something's going to happen and and you know what he said to him oh ye of little faith he wasn't worried at all by the storm he wasn't worried about the wars he wasn't worried about demons coming up against him he stood faithful in his realm of perfect Faith he knew who he was he knew where he stood and there wasn't any demon power or any storm that could ever destroy his life until God said so glory be to God I want wherever Jesus was living I want to live there whatever Faith Jesus was partaking of I want that every day in my life perfect Faith Masters every circumstance and guess what what we can live there because he says where I am you can be also we need it so Jesus is there and and and he saying don't let your heart be troubled in other places he says it and uh he wouldn't say that unless he could provide for us something or someplace that we can go for strength for Hope for peace all of these are are things that we seek after I appreciated the songs tonight they didn't know what I was going to preach but the songs living by faith peace of God cover me they're all songs related to what I was going to preach on the Lord must be wanting to tell us something amen so but God has to provide some place or something in these times for our strength for Our Hope For Peace for security can you say amen he could not say uh you know when you begin to feel uh insecure when you feel these insecurities come from the wars and from the pressure and and people hating you when you start to feel that then just maybe go uh through some mental exercises and it'll help you out he didn't say that uh I feel good I feel great I feel wonderful I feel good I feel great I feel wonderful and you just convince yourself you're doing your calming your nerves Jesus didn't say that uh he didn't say uh take up some extra yoga classes when it gets real bad in the world to calm your nerves take some extra yoga classes he didn't stay take more pills he didn't say that here when you hit that last days in all the wars he didn't say try to find more pills he didn't say that not against pills if they help a person but he didn't say he didn't say that he he he's got to give us something greater than a pill can you say man greater than a yoga class he didn't he didn't say go buy yourself something real nice and spend a lot of money on yourself so you can call calm your nerves he didn't say take a few days and binge watch Star Wars series of course he didn't say that this will Cal you nurse he didn't say any of that but I if he said don't be troubled he must be providing something deeper than a movie to calm our nerves you know why I say that you know why I say it because Americans and the world have so many things to calm their nerves but in these conditions it's going to take more than a movie it's going to take more than binge watching some series it's going to take some source that God provides by the holy spirit that we can feed on and we can rest on to calm our nerves and say I know where I stand in this hour I am not afraid and whatever comes my way whatever our way our country would change in the next because I I don't think Life as we know it is going to continue the same I meant to say that Sunday I think we're in a spot things will not continue as convenient as we've always had them our life will become more inconvenienced I do believe that question is where do you stand do you have God in your heart when this is all Stripped Away what do you have in your heart when it's all gone when you you say well I got Security in my job no no you don't not really I got Security in who's going to be the next president not really there's nobody can fix these problems because God God knows the hour that we have because he knows the hour and the trouble that it can cause our hearts he provides something deeper than this world he says I give you peace not as the world gives I give peace but I will give you peace so now I want to say something about war here okay because uh we we have to know some things about war when we hear of War the the war in Israel war comes because hate increases so he had to have the word in there that many shall betray one another many shall many shall uh condemn one another many shall be offended many not it used you know we've always had people offended but he says many will be offended there'll be an increase in people getting offended there'll be an in increase in people uh maybe uh leaving the Church of God and leaving Christ there'll be an increase because it's too much of a nervous time and so they they leave Christ there'll be an increase in people that hate haters and because you have hate then you're going to have War because hate is the thing that starts War you're not going to have a war if you don't have hate more war is because we have more hate and there's nothing to stop it there's no place for go for people to go to relieve their hate if hate is in a and if hate is not resolved it leads to all sorts of things including War Nations shall rise against Nation kingdoms shall come against Kingdom why because hate and jealousy has increased how many can say Amen tonight hatred unresolved hat hatred hatred brewing for years that's why we've had a lot more fights that's happening even in the political world because all that thing is just festering there all that disagreement is all festering and so now it begins to come to the surface and it manifested hatred and then so many countries and Nations it manifests into a becomes a war but we must know where it starts it starts with hatred it starts with something festering within us against somebody else we can take a lesson from that you cannot hold on to your your hatred or else you become like them you cannot hold on to your resentment you cannot hold on to your bitterness can you say Amen you cannot hold on to hatred it will eat you up and it'll cause War so we learn a lesson is that when we come to more war we come to an increasing of hatred Nations rising in more and more being against something people more and more being against something and they're saying it I'm against that I'm against that and jealousy Rises one preacher said it a couple weeks ago I like what he said he said we preach so much about what we were we are against we're preaching about what we're against but why not preach what we're for can I get a witness there's too much preaching about what we're against but why don't we preach what we're for and then if somebody's hungry for more truth if there's a heart that's already hungry you don't have to force that person they're just being honest I'm I'm hungry for more truth I want God in my life I got to have a reality of God I got to have more than a religion more than a form more than just a baptism but something that puts me in touch with almighty God it's got to be more than a religion religion people are still scared but when the Holy Spirit comes in when the Holy Ghost comes in then it's this didn't he call the Holy Ghost when he first said it in in joh didn't he says I'm going to send you the Holy Ghost and he said it will be a comforter didn't he call the Holy Ghost a comforter isn't man looking for a comfort from things a comfort from pleasures and entertainments but that's not going to get us through these hard times we need a deeper comforter the comforter this is what he provides and so now if hate is increasing then we realize that we we even in our in our rank sometimes we can take this hate hate and be more emphasizing what we are against because we we grow in hatred and then it says many shall be offended many shall be betrayed many shall betray you and then hate and many means it'll increase it we've always have hatred we've always had from the time that Cain slew his brother Abel we've had a Cain was a murderer where did that come from didn't come from God Cain killed his own brother after the Garden Eden of Eden Cain that did not come from God when Cain killed his where did murder come from came from hatred how did Cain get the hatred why did he get jealous at his brother Abel so right from the very beginning of the Garden of Eden we've had hatred but he says in the end time many it'll increase many shall be offended many shall hate one another that's the climate that we live in hatred and I'll just say it you may be a Christian but if you don't stay covered up in the peace of God in his spirit of in the spirit of God some of that hatred will rub off on you some of that bitterness is trying to come in your heart and you get bitter towards the guy that's sitting next to you to the sister or brother sitting next to you you get bitter about them you get bitter towards your boss you get hatred towards your boss we cannot let the spirit that dominates this world this nation this end time we cannot let it into our heart we have to have something to relieve it we have to have something greater is anybody listening to me tonight we have to have something deeper than just what the world provides I want to read and take this just a step deeper here uh turn with me to James 41 or they can put it up on the screen as well just take this a step deeper and I won't be long tonight I just wanted to lay these things in about hatred and how we respond James chapter four and James is the one that we got to live what we preach and live what we say as Christians James is from Missouri the show me state he said if if you got True Religion he's saying show me so James was from M Missouri not really but I don't have any historical documents for that to prove that but he he was a a a show me type preacher he was a show me type preacher if you're a Christian show me the the show me the works from it amen show me what you got and so James chapter 4 verse one he says from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lust that wore in your members so do you know what he says here I'm going to read it in the Amplified actually I'm going to read it in three different um three different uh versions I guess of the Bible the Amplified and a couple other ones because I want you to understand this from whence comes Wars and fightings among you so now we take it a little bit more personal it's not happening in Israel not happen in Ukraine but there can be war and strife that happens in your own home in your own church in your own family War strife contention what is the source but he says what is the source of wars and fights among you now come on I'm just going to stop in wait a minute you know there can be Strife happened between brothers and sisters Bo sure got quiet right there you know that Satan would like you to war against one another to fight against one another to fight against other churches and and and shoot you know misguided missiles or over the pulpit to other churches and you see it all goes back to the same Spirit of resentment and jealousy and hatred and their church is not as good as our church all that is there's nothing in that in the kingdom of God we need to get rid of all of that there's no perfect church can you say Amen there's no perfect Message Church there's no perfect Church anywhere there there's we're we're flawed individuals we're flawed human beings that n we all need the same Christ that every human being needs in this world and we need the reality of him but there isn't it's Baptist Pentecostal whatever Church it is here here Among Us it's it's it's all the same because people are the same we need the same God we need the same word that comes from the Lord but you see now he says now so we're all admitting now we can have wars among us we can have Strife in our own home a marriage could have Strife a marriage could have War until there's a divorce right sometimes irreconcilable differences and it's because you had War for 20 years in your marriage somebody said let's just stop the war that's it it's over instead of clinging to Christ to try to get an answer and so you have war in a marriage you can have war in a home you can have war with your children you can have stri Strife that happens among you even in the church but here's what he says in a couple places what is the source read it with me uh James 4:1 and I'll read it in this version here what is the source of wars and fights among you don't they come from your passion that wage war within you what is the source of conflict among you what is the source of your disputes don't they come from your Cravings or that are at war in your own lives what is causing all the quars and fights among you isn't it your desires battling inside you so there's a truth here in Scripture that we must admit that if you're complaining about strife and War among you in your home in your family in your church the first place you need to look as the problem is with within your own heart is that okay Jame I told you he's from the show me state it's like listen he's he's straight as ever he just tells it like it is I'm not as hard a preacher as James he lays it out flat and he says if you're having war and struggles in the marriage and family or with other people with your boss if there's constant struggles and you're being affected by it then you need to look at your own heart because there's actually a war going on in you and there's not supposed to be a war going on in us we're supposed to be carriers of the peace of God we should we're supposed to hold so much peace within us and so much of God within us and the love of God shed abroad in our hearts that it doesn't matter what environment someone could spit in our face and by the way there was a man that spit on David one time and disrespected David and his because David was a type of Christ we'll never understand this response but it's a Christlike response he spit on him and one of his soldiers David soldiers says he disrespected the king that's it he's done took a sword out ready to do something and David said don't kill him leave him alone God told him to do that perhaps it'll be a blessing for me down the road Christ coming out of David that response does not come from human beings that comes from Christ take the worst case scenario somebody's somebody's taking you for something somebody's suing you somebody is doing you wrong somebody's gossiping destroying your testimony none of us want that you know I value my testimony there's a scripture in the Bible in Proverbs that says a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches my name I I I don't care about riches I don't care about houses and lands my name is something to be valued and my I want my name to Bear the name of Jesus Christ and I want to have a good testimony but you all you don't always get that sometimes people put you down persecute you do different things to you but you see now how do we respond to it and when we have war in our home and War in our churches it's because there's something unresolved in us had a fight today with my uncle I didn't have a fight with my uncle I'm just using a scenario here oh boy he really got mad at me he went at it you know I don't know why this guy for years I don't know why he doesn't like me and you see now you're going to have that but you see if you have some type of response that's back that wants to get a Revenge I know none of you ever feel that at all it's only me that feels that you want to get revenge listen I'm not perfect friends I failed this Monday I I failed I always try to watch and be careful of certain things and I text somebody and I let a little bit more out of my feelings than of Christ and wasn't right I had to apologize I had to make it right before God because sometimes we get in the flesh but my desire is every response everything would be the right response and say the right thing to bring peace help us Lord I know none of you failed and none of you had anything but I'm just being honest with you it's that you know let's not sit with our Halos tonight let's let's be real okay is that if you're complaining say my uncle somebody they're doing me wrong they're trying to war with me they're fighting with me it's tension every Thanksgiving dinner it's tension and I can't stand this you got to start looking if there's something within you that's unresolved because I can tell you if you're at peace if you're comfortable if you know where you stand and you know that the love of God is is poured in your heart you can walk into that hatred and respond with the love of God I don't think that there can be any situation even David says if I go to the lowest hell God is there he would be with me there it's almost like we live in hell today it's almost like we've already reached it it's just so much so much to it so much hatred Satan's Eden that we live in can you say Amen it's just this whole world is wrong it's it's it's not right there's a few good people in it and I thank God for them I thank God for real people and real Christians and there's some good people thank God for that but the world because they've left the word they're they're getting off track more and more and it's becoming more and more evil all the time and there's more hatred but war on the outside means there's there's war and conflict on the inside unresolved bitterness resentment jealousy see I have to bring this down to our own lives unresolved jealousy unresolved bitterness unresolved anger and Lust For against someone else or towards someone else it's it's it's saying that I I I'm at peace and rest inside with myself with God that's where we need to be is that we need that peace and rest and Holy Spirit dwelling there shed abroad with the love of God in our hearts inside of us can you say Amen towards God towards others and if we have that there'll be less war and strife in our family it's because you James says you're you're lusting and you're you're struggling within yourself there's something going on within you you need to settle that struggle before you try to settle other Wars you could have all the peace talks that you want to you could have all the family dinners to try to make peace but if you walk into that and your heart is not resolved of the hatred and bitterness it will do no good you have to start resolving the war within you a lot of you tonight I know your testimonies you come to the Lord and you lived your whole life with a struggle got a uh brother Jason here just I I'm just I can mention all kinds of names the struggle the just the the war on the inside and then he comes to Christ a couple years ago baptizing him still growing in the Lord you see now the war within is settled peace comes on the inside can you say Amen you're sitting amongst people here that come from all kinds of strife where inside their hearts I was at battle against God I was battling God I was was struggling I was insecure I didn't know who I was but but and and the world is still a mess the world my family some of them still don't like me but inside it's been settled I know who I am and by the way you can't solve world problems without solving heart problems not too many people would say that you can't solve world problems without solving heart problems you can't solve violence unless you solve the heart that Lust For more violence with movies and video games I'm always amazed in the news as you watch this violent act and somebody mows down somebody with a gun and they're always trying to find what was the motive what was going on you know what they're trying to do where was this person where was their mind what made it do it was it anti-Semitism was it what was it and they're trying to get to bom sometimes they feel better if they can find someone to blame I find it interesting that they always leave out that this teenage boy that went into a school they conveniently leave out the 12 13 14 years that he sat at home feeding on the worst violence on a video game that he could ever do and then you get the this result say why did he do this why did he do this you can't put two and two together you can't solve the violence problem unless you solve the problem with the heart amen it's tied together and statistics prove that but he that shall endure to the end Lord how do I do that what have you provided for me where is my security that I would be one that could Ure all of this endure what endure the hatred endure the people offended endure the the evil that's around us endure the struggle sometimes that's even Among Us Lord how you said endure to the end somebody's going to endure it how do I do it what have you provided for me and in this Romans 5 and verse one I'll just start at verse one and I'm going to read it along you can put it up on the King James version on the the screen James 5 and verse uh excuse me Romans 5 excuse me I was in James Romans 5 got the wrong one Romans five look at this look at these scriptures here because I'm answering the question as we bring this down I'm answering it from the scripture tonight and that is Lord where do I get the strong security where what have you provided for me and I can't think of better scriptures than this to describe what God has given to us chapter 5 and verse one therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I haven't even got to the rest of scriptures yet but because we know by Revelation he has Justified us which means means he has cleared us of all of our sin the judge has declared us innocent because Christ blood was shed for us now if you want to talk about the source of peace in the soul you have to talk about how the great judge said you were guilty but Christ Our lamb went to Calvary and paid the price for our sin and the judge gets up and declares they are righteous by the blood of the Lamb they have been cleared and Court they are sinless before me you can't find a greater peace rise up in a heart to realize I've been justified by God that ought to be enough to just make us shout amen right there but it's not over therefore since we have been Justified that is acquitted of sin declared blameless before God by faith let us grasp the fact that we have peace with God and the joy of reconciliation with him through our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah the anointed verse two through him we also have access by faith into this remarkable state of grace in which we firmly and safely and securely stand so now we've been Justified we've been forgiven and now we stand in a place of security we stand in a place firmly safely securely We Stand can you say Amen where are we standing in the grace of God I'm standing in His Grace Grace is unmar favor so I'm standing there it goes on here it says let us rejoice in Hope and confident Assurance of experiencing and enjoying the glory of our God the manifestation of his excellence and power verse three and not only this but with joy let us exalt in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships knowing that hardship distress pressure trouble produces patient endurance only a Believer can look at things this way that we rejoice in Trials because uh pressure can make us bitter or it can make us better but a Believer is like Joseph and all of his brothers hated him and and they sold him into Egypt if you know the story maybe some of you remember it from Sunday school or whatever but they sold him into Egypt his own brother sold him as a slave took him down to Egypt put him in a pit brought him out sold him as a slave of Egypt his brothers hated him because he was uh had some dreams and the Lord was with him and such hatred Venom and they just just sell him get rid of him and so they did that he went to Egypt he served there then he rose up right side of pharaoh there and so then he has to meet his brothers again after for many many years and the normal human being would say I'm in a position of the right hand of pharaoh I can get Vengeance on these boys that's a normal human being but we find Christ manifesting in Joseph and when he stood there before his brothers and they didn't know who he was because he had you know he had got older he wasn't a teenage boy anymore he had gotten older and they stood before this right hand of pharaoh and he reveals himself to his brothers I'm Joseph your brother of course they're all scared they know their lives are over they know it's going to be finished and Joseph he just begins to weep and you know what he says what you meant in evil God meant it for good that's not within a human being that's something greater that's coming forth of Christ that's manifesting that your hatred could have made me hateful is anybody listen here tonight if you don't get anything get these last points looks at him and says your hatred could have changed me into having the same hatred your hatred could justify a response of Vengeance on your life I have power to end your lives right now your hatred your evil has turned out to my good so I won't kill you I won't get Vengeance I'll actually bless you I'll send you back with your father and I'll bless your family and I'm G to take care of you guys anybody listening tonight there's got to be a response to this hatred there's got to be a response to this bitterness L we become that way ourselves L it rubs off on us let me finish this it's not done yet because he says and not only this verse three but with joy let us exalt in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships knowing that hardship distress pressure trouble produces patience patient endurance only for believers do we see that suffering can bring joy to us and we should have joy during our suffering verse four and endurance proven character if we endure we come out of it with character spiritual maturity and proven character hope and confidence and its Assurance of Eternal salvation verse 5 such hope in God's promises never disappoints us because God's love has been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Ghost who who who was given to us so I'm I'm I'm finishing this tonight saying to you yes he's provided a source there's a fountain open in the House of David in the last days there's a fountain open in the House of David and it's not just your Bible it's the Holy Spirit making the Bible live there's a fountain that you can drink from that all of this hatred has a response it's the love of God shed and brought in our hearts it's the love of God poured out in Us by the Holy Ghost if you don't leave saying any other thing you say God pour out by the Holy Ghost pour out your love in my heart because you're going to hit some days you're going to need it life won't stay the same I I don't prophesy things that's not my calling but I'll say from the scripture and what's going on I'll say safely I don't think life is going to continue the same this coming year I think things are going to change you say well I'm I'm scared they're going to come to my door with guns don't be afraid of that Jesus said don't be afraid of those who can kill the body but be afraid of those who can kill the soul so our concern is not what they can do to kill us physically but to to bring us doubts and and fears to cause us to doubt God's promises we can't doubt God's promises during this time he says his promises he says such hope in God's promises never disappoints us we're disappointed in politics we're disappointed with this world you're disappointed with your uncle because he keeps fighting with you but my friend you will never be disappointed in the promises of God never be disappointed in the promises of God aren't you glad tonight you have something you'll never be disappoint pointed in you say well I don't understand God didn't answer God that didn't seem like God didn't answer God always answers and his people if we can have them come up from the grave tonight which we don't believe in that until the resurrection we're not preaching Halloween here that's for sure last night was Halloween but if if if Christians who's died and went on and they're just in another dimension Christians don't die they're in another dimension but you see now if they could testify to you they they went through times where they were beheaded they went through times of persecution from Rome all the way through they went through if they could rise and talk to us tonight I'd let them speak not I'd let them say testify you know what they say to you you know what they say there's something greater than what hit me in my problems that I had and you know what they'd say mostly God never disappointed me he always came through we're living now and so we have a lot of disappointments but we need to remember God's promises will never disappoint Hallelujah you will never be disappointed with God's promises we will with people how many's been disappointed in people before we'll be disappointed in people we'll be disappointed with family they will fail us we will be disappointed with government sometimes but she'll never dis be disappointed tonight my friend wherever you're listening my brother and sister where whoever you are I can tell you there's a fountain that you can drink from there's a love that can be shed abroad in your hearts by the holy ghost that you will never be disappointed in him you'll find a security you'll find a strength you'll find a stability in this hour of fear something will grip your heart that's greater than fear something will pour in your heart the Holy Ghost is provided as an answer and what is it doing it pours out his love within us the comforter has come and he'll pour out his comfort and his love that we be able to respond as I read to you the scriptures Sunday we can pull him up and close on this Matthew 5 Matthew 5 he said ye have heard that had been said verse 43 ye have heard that had been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemy bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and on sendeth his Reign on the just and on the unjust and if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others you know his point saying we're not called to be like others we're not called to hold hatred in our hearts we're not called to respond with the same hatred that they have there has to be another Holy Spirit response be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect going back to verse 38 he says ye have heard that it had been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law let him take thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that Ask Of Thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not away what is all this what is that a different response than what we humanly could come up with it's it's his life his life that has come in a human being by the Holy Spirit and it is the only proper response to the wars to The Strife to the pressure this may be just a Wednesday night with just us here those who are listening online doesn't matter if there was five people here it doesn't matter this word is still the same you have a hope tonight you have something to tie to that's secure tonight that you don't have to be nervous and scared and Afraid you don't have to hold bitterness in your heart you don't have to hold hatred in your heart one of my prayers is lately has been oh Lord you see people act a certain way I say Lord please if anything don't let me go that direction and I think of what I just close on this I didn't expect to say this but I just wanted to say I think it was one place that brother bradam said he said Lord don't Crown my life as an old crabby man and a grouch he said as I get older and he says as you get older he said you've seen so many disappointments of life you get bitter you get angry you know what I see young people at 21 years old 22 they're already bitter about life they're already lashing out they already hate somebody somebody posted something they didn't like but the older ones he said oh don't let me me die and go and end up crowning my life with an old crab that's complaining all the time and seeing so many disappointments in people that you're just crabby he said Lord Crown my life with the glory of almighty God Crown my life with the glory of almighty God the peace of God the stability of God the love of God can you say Amen friends the true Holy Spirit In Our Lives the true gentleness of the holy spirit all the fruits of the spirit manifesting through gentleness and goodness you know those aren't just psychological things that we study it's in the holy spirit it's in the Holy Ghost and you got it within you it'll start coming out and manifesting in the worst of hatred in front of you I tell you friends let's start forgiving really forgiving those who've hurt us those have done us wrong let's say Lord I'm tired of being tired I'm
