[32:04] in his presence and I just um just
[32:08] pondering over just of the moments even
[32:11] on the drive over here is we all have so
[32:15] many
[32:16] needs and our needs are so
[32:20] diverse
[32:22] God we need him to come and to minister
[32:25] to every every need
[32:27] and I believe that's what we've come for
[32:29] we we need to hear from him there's
[32:32] lives and hearts Among Us that truly
[32:35] God's here to give you a real
[32:38] experience and there's lives and hearts
[32:41] that God is here to give us a fresh
[32:44] experience and to direct us and help us
[32:48] that our lives might move on further and
[32:50] deeper in him the real truth of the
[32:54] matter is it's it's not so much us
[32:57] in our own selves walking as though oh
[32:59] I'm going deeper it's actually just
[33:02] opening and letting him come
[33:05] deeper it's because you you and me we
[33:09] are the Tabernacle of the Living
[33:12] God we just want God to go deeper we
[33:15] want him just to work and move through
[33:17] every area of our life and I say Lord if
[33:18] there's any channel that's that's
[33:20] hindering it all show me help me Lord
[33:25] that that channel might be yielded to
[33:28] you that's what we want you know many
[33:31] times I my father he dealt with some
[33:34] different medical issues and I remember
[33:36] at a certain time we would at times I'd
[33:39] get ready to go out and preach and I'd
[33:41] see him in the in he had an office that
[33:43] was adjacent to mine and he just would
[33:45] be sick to his stomach and we would
[33:48] pray and the Lord would move for him
[33:51] each time but it what it was is that
[33:54] when you got to taking a combination of
[33:57] Medicine sure the Lord would touch him
[33:59] but we had to figure out what was the
[34:02] cause because every time it was the same
[34:04] reoccurrence and so I believe that's how
[34:07] it is in our life is Lord I I know
[34:09] you're my deliverer I Know You're My
[34:11] Healer I know you're my all in all but
[34:13] just help me Lord that the areas of my
[34:16] life that in those areas I can yield
[34:18] them to you and I can better understand
[34:22] what you have for me and how that I'm to
[34:25] live and operate as a son son and
[34:27] daughter of God don't you love him amen
[34:30] so good to be here with you and uh so
[34:32] thankful for the privilege to be able to
[34:35] stand before you it's certainly a
[34:37] counted a great honor and certainly have
[34:39] a lot of high regards for brother Paul
[34:42] and brother Barry and uh I think about
[34:44] it you know brother Paul I thought 10
[34:46] years ago was the first time that I had
[34:50] ministered in a winter youth retreat and
[34:52] boy I didn't know that my life was going
[34:55] to change after that it was right right
[34:57] after that where the decision was made I
[35:00] stepped away from teaching my I didn't
[35:02] know 10 years ago but who what God has
[35:06] in store who knows but I just want to be
[35:10] ready just want to be ready amen let's
[35:13] just go to him in a word of prayer

[37:32] name of Jesus Christ
[37:34] amen amen if you would I'd like you to
[37:38] turn with me in the in the scriptures
[37:41] here
[37:42] to Jonah chapter
[37:55] 1
[37:58] and I just want to we want to read just
[38:00] a few verses of
[38:01] scripture as we're gathered here in um
[38:05] just beginning in verse
[38:08] one now the word of the Lord came unto
[38:11] Jonah the son of am saying arise go to
[38:16] Nineveh that great City and cry against
[38:20] it for their wickedness has come up
[38:22] before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto
[38:26] tarus from the presence of the Lord and
[38:30] went down to japa and he found a ship
[38:33] going to tares so he paid the fair
[38:36] thereof and went down into it to go with
[38:39] them unto tares from the presence of the
[38:42] Lord I want you to notice this in verse
[38:45] four but the Lord sent out a great wind
[38:49] into the sea and there was a mighty
[38:51] Tempest in the sea so that the ship was
[38:54] like to be broken then the Mariners were
[38:58] afraid and cried every man unto his God
[39:01] and cast forth the Wares that were in
[39:03] the ship into the sea to lighten it of
[39:07] them but Jonah was gone down into the
[39:10] sides of the ship and he lay and was
[39:13] fast asleep so the shipmaster came to
[39:16] him and said unto him what meanest thou
[39:19] Oh
[39:20] Sleeper everybody else is alarmed Jonah
[39:24] is the only one
[39:25] sleeping
[39:27] what meanest thou Oh Sleeper arise call
[39:31] upon thy God if so be that God will
[39:33] think upon us that we perish not and
[39:37] they said everyone to his fellow come
[39:39] and let us cast lots that we may know
[39:42] for whose cause this evil is upon us so
[39:45] they cast lots and the lot fell upon
[39:48] Jonah then said they unto him tell us we
[39:51] pray thee for whose cause this evil is
[39:53] upon us what is thine occupation and
[39:56] whence comest thou what is thy country
[39:59] and of what people art thou and he said
[40:03] unto them I am in Hebrew and I fear the
[40:06] lord the god of Heaven which made the
[40:09] Sea and the dry land then were the men
[40:12] exceedingly afraid and said unto him why
[40:15] hast thou done this for the men knew
[40:18] that he fled from the presence of the
[40:20] Lord because he told them just like to
[40:25] just speak just a very simple thought
[40:28] that's actually a question what are you
[40:32] doing
[40:33] here what are you doing here amen may
[40:38] God bless you and bless the reading of
[40:39] the word as you're being
[40:43] seated I think it's one thing that is
[40:45] very clear that the message of the hour
[40:48] has brought us so aware of and we can
[40:51] see it through the
[40:53] scripture that we realize that the
[40:55] presence of the Lord Lord It's the very
[40:58] person of Jesus Christ it's God himself
[41:03] so it's more than a feeling it's more
[41:05] than an emotion oh how we love to feel
[41:07] him how we love that but the presence of
[41:10] the Lord is him that's who he is it's
[41:13] his word and so we find that as it
[41:16] brings it so simple that we see over and
[41:19] over through the scriptures that when a
[41:21] person themselves comes into the
[41:23] presence of God and really will humble
[41:26] themselves in God's presence then there
[41:28] is a change that comes into that
[41:30] person's life that can never be gotten
[41:34] away from it's something that changes
[41:36] them from just time to Eternity we find
[41:40] it within Moses Moses had heard the word
[41:44] he had been around the word but when he
[41:45] got into the presence of almighty God
[41:49] then his life was changed God began to
[41:51] speak to him regarding that word that he
[41:54] had heard he had rehearsed he even had
[41:57] tried to live it and then he had got to
[41:59] such a place he was so frustrated in
[42:01] that he wasn't seeing things turn out
[42:04] the way that he thought it should turn
[42:06] out so he just thought I'll just get
[42:08] away from it and I'll just forget all
[42:10] about it so he tried to occupy himself
[42:15] going out there we know he fled and he
[42:17] went out from Egypt and he tried to get
[42:19] away from everything and what he had
[42:21] known and what he was looking at and he
[42:23] was trying to run from was his failure
[42:27] but God you know one thing about it is
[42:29] that what God has a promise for you and
[42:32] you're a part of that promise you're
[42:34] never going to escape that promise and
[42:37] purpose that God has for your life so
[42:41] when you think about that question that
[42:43] we look at here tonight what are you
[42:45] doing here and and I'm not just so much
[42:47] talking about at this at the winter
[42:49] youth retreat I'm talking about where
[42:51] you are in your own life where you are
[42:55] in in your part part in your journey no
[42:57] matter what age you are no matter how
[42:59] long you've been serving God no matter
[43:01] where you're at in your journey with the
[43:03] Lord there's still a question that
[43:04] arises what are you doing here because
[43:07] we understand that God has a purpose in
[43:09] us being here God is not God has not
[43:11] just brought us here to see if he could
[43:14] do it but God has a purpose in it and
[43:17] the prophet tells us like this in why
[43:18] Christ speak he says if we can find the
[43:21] purpose that God has brought us here for
[43:24] oh how that we'll save ourselves a lot
[43:27] of trouble and we'll save God a lot of
[43:30] trouble and you know even when God makes
[43:33] known his purpose because we realize the
[43:35] ultimate purpose when we talk about the
[43:37] will of God and I want to know God's
[43:39] will for this and I want to know God's
[43:41] will for this well there is many
[43:43] different Avenues of things in our life
[43:44] that I believe as a Believer and as a
[43:47] child of God there's a reverence in our
[43:49] life to see that there's a value in
[43:52] knowing God's will you can even look at
[43:54] examples maybe it's examples you've had
[43:56] had an extended family it's examples
[43:58] you've had before you where you've been
[43:59] able to see my I I look at that
[44:02] situation maybe if they would have only
[44:04] been a little bit more careful but
[44:05] anytime you ever see anything like that
[44:08] it's always an opportunity for you to
[44:10] look at it not down on the person but to
[44:13] look and say God help me and teach me
[44:15] what it is that I can glean from that in
[44:17] my life if I am seeing it in this way
[44:20] you've not did it so that I could be
[44:22] critical or become lifted up but it's
[44:24] something about it I need need your
[44:26] grace to teach me Lord and help me
[44:28] that's what the prophet even when he
[44:30] would go into his own life even as we
[44:33] look down through the scriptures God
[44:34] never chose through the scriptures to
[44:37] ever hide the humanity of the men that
[44:40] he chose to use down through the
[44:42] scriptures God could have chose to do
[44:44] that but God wanted you and I to see
[44:46] that so that you and I could receive
[44:48] comfort and strength and realize in our
[44:51] own life that God in Me is greater than
[44:54] all of my Humanity he's greater than all
[44:57] my mistakes he's greater than all my
[44:59] failures he's greater than even what my
[45:01] own thoughts are concerning my own life
[45:05] God is so far greater and so when we
[45:08] consider this and look at the question
[45:10] what we're doing here it brings us back
[45:12] to always looking in our own lives I
[45:15] find the prophet doing this over and
[45:17] over think about brother randam laying
[45:19] in his bed and then he receives the
[45:21] visitation beyond the curtain of time
[45:24] and when he thinks he's laying on the
[45:26] bed and he asked he asks he looks to
[45:28] himself he says here you are 50 years
[45:31] old and what have you done for the Lord
[45:34] now I don't know about you but I I would
[45:36] never expect the prophet to have asked
[45:38] that question to himself yeah probably
[45:40] if I had been standing there that day I
[45:42] would have said hey wait wait wait wait
[45:43] wait let me give you a list of what you
[45:46] have done let me give you an
[45:47] accomplishment of the word that's been
[45:49] ministered that would reach and the
[45:51] healing and all the Miracles that's been
[45:53] done but you see it's something about
[45:55] with the the child of God when God moves
[45:57] upon your heart there's always a desire
[46:00] knowing there's a next move there's
[46:02] another Tomorrow there's a purpose it's
[46:05] if I'm still here then God's purpose is
[46:08] not finished and so if I'm here there's
[46:11] nothing can take me out of this Earth
[46:13] until the purpose of God is finished so
[46:17] if we can bring that into the context we
[46:19] realize that there's nothing else in
[46:22] this life that really matters or should
[46:25] take PR idence or preeminence outside of
[46:28] the purpose of God and once we've caught
[46:31] a hold of the purpose of God which is to
[46:33] be filled with the spirit of God and
[46:36] allow God to begin to unfold in your
[46:38] life what he has for you to
[46:41] do God will begin to unpack that in our
[46:44] life and he doesn't do it all at once he
[46:46] does it little by little and when what
[46:49] he's calling us to do he prepares us to
[46:52] be able to handle it that's the same way
[46:55] it was was in the days of creation what
[46:57] good would it have done to have created
[46:59] all the wonderful uh uh uh you know uh
[47:02] Wells and things like that if there was
[47:04] no water for him to swim in but God
[47:07] makes preparation one day to sustain
[47:10] what's coming on the next day that's
[47:12] frankly why you and I are here in an age
[47:15] that is totally unfit for humans to live
[47:18] in an age of neurotic pressure and
[47:21] tension but God himself by his word that
[47:24] he already has promised in here and now
[47:27] in this generation he sold that word
[47:30] through him by the mouth of a prophet
[47:33] and here we are benefiting from the word
[47:36] in this hour living by God's grace with
[47:39] a San
[47:40] mind that's the grace of almighty God to
[47:44] be able to look at things with a clear
[47:46] purpose you as young men to be able to
[47:48] recognize the responsibility that's set
[47:51] before you as a young man as a young
[47:53] lady recognizing this and being being
[47:56] able to overcome the thoughts of Lady
[47:58] oia Satan zeden I'm telling you right
[48:01] now you may not feel like a miracle but
[48:03] you're a
[48:06] miracle God has provided for you he
[48:10] provided for me that we could live sane
[48:14] in this hour and not just sane but
[48:19] Victorious and so when we find this that
[48:22] you know like Moses Moses when he he
[48:25] felt like that you know I've been a
[48:27] failure and so he just ran away and
[48:30] that's listen this when we look at
[48:32] things many times we all all of us come
[48:35] under the same pressure like Jonah was
[48:38] under when it comes time to face
[48:42] responsibilities it's not hard when
[48:44] everybody's patting you on the back it's
[48:46] it's really it's not hard to serve God
[48:48] right here in this atmosphere that we're
[48:51] in that's not hard it's not hard to be
[48:54] bubbling over in this atmosphere now you
[48:57] might have went through something and
[48:58] you might say brother Samuel you don't
[48:59] know my condition but just hold on I
[49:02] believe that God has Grace to break you
[49:04] right out of that situation and not only
[49:07] can you come out of it but you can go
[49:09] deeper and further than you've ever been
[49:12] before don't set any limitations on
[49:16] God what you receive this morning say
[49:18] God I want more tonight when devotions
[49:22] come tomorrow I want more when the
[49:24] afternoons when the morning session I
[49:26] want more afternoon session I want more
[49:28] I want to be so filled like a sponge
[49:32] when I have come to a point of
[49:34] saturation when I walk out of here there
[49:37] is no more that I can hold I can say God
[49:40] I've been
[49:45] overwhelmed things that I can pray about
[49:47] and things that I can take with me from
[49:50] here I've been
[49:52] encouraged you see Moses when he he ran
[49:55] away I don't know how we're here but
[49:57] we're here Moses when he ran
[50:00] away but you know what he couldn't
[50:02] escape God's plan for his
[50:05] life God knew right where Moses had to
[50:09] be you know God knows how to get you in
[50:11] I into a place of
[50:14] surrender let me just let me just point
[50:16] it to you like this you can be a you can
[50:18] be individuals Holy Ghost filled sitting
[50:21] right in the church and God is calling
[50:23] you to do something and you look at and
[50:26] say this one would be better this
[50:29] person's more qualified this person
[50:31] listen that's not anything new the
[50:34] prophet when he was when it was made
[50:35] known to him what his commission was he
[50:39] told the angel of the Lord I ain't going
[50:41] to be able to do that you need to find
[50:44] somebody
[50:45] else you see it's always something when
[50:47] God ask us to do something we look at it
[50:50] through our own human abilities but God
[50:54] is not calling you based on your human
[50:57] abilities God is calling you because he
[50:59] knows what he has placed inside of
[51:04] you if that's what he's talking to sure
[51:07] we have ears on our head sure we have a
[51:09] mind that the word when we hear the word
[51:12] the word has to pass through our mind
[51:14] and come down into our soul but listen
[51:17] that's not the stopping place it's
[51:19] coming down to the soul it's that part
[51:22] of God that he always
[51:24] knew that's what God's speaking to and
[51:27] sometimes we're the ones who get in the
[51:29] way and we look at our own lives and say
[51:31] that's not possible let me tell you
[51:33] everyone down through the scripture that
[51:35] God has ever asked to do something it
[51:38] has been individuals that you and I
[51:40] would have never qualified as candidates
[51:43] for the
[51:44] job who would call a man and a woman to
[51:47] receive a son who the woman had been
[51:50] Barren all
[51:52] along who would do such a thing as that
[51:55] who would call a man who was a scaredy
[51:57] cat and call him a mighty man of Valor I
[52:01] tell you who would do that the same God
[52:03] that's called you the same God that
[52:06] spoke to your
[52:09] life so I just say we need to just right
[52:13] here
[52:14] tonight the prophet would say it over
[52:16] and over he said you're wanting
[52:19] somewhere to put your foot you've been
[52:21] praying for a moment to put your foot
[52:24] down this is your
[52:26] moment he said whatever you have been he
[52:30] said you've been a failure he said maybe
[52:32] as a housewife a failure as this maybe
[52:34] you've been a failure as a student maybe
[52:36] you've been a failure as a Christian a
[52:38] failure but listen let me tell you what
[52:40] a Vindicated Prophet said he said let
[52:43] that be a has
[52:46] been and start fresh
[52:48] tonight I thank God for Fresh Starts
[52:51] that's the promise of the scripture
[52:53] renewing of our mind
[52:58] Hallelujah so here we are in the
[53:00] presence of God you know Cain went out
[53:02] of God's presence that's the biggest
[53:04] mistake he ever
[53:06] made he went out of God's presence and
[53:08] the prophet just simply said it just
[53:10] like this he says when we go out he said
[53:12] of God's of God's presence that's where
[53:14] you or I will make our own
[53:17] mistake sometimes let me just speak just
[53:20] a moment here sometimes we understand
[53:22] that there's times that a person from
[53:24] the beginning we can see it when man
[53:26] can't stand justified in God's presence
[53:29] he will run if there's sin in his life
[53:32] if it's condemnation is that right but
[53:35] there's also a part of it too as we were
[53:38] just saying that sometimes a person can
[53:41] run or flee and try to move away from
[53:45] the responsibility or the issue that God
[53:48] is calling them to
[53:50] face and you never go any
[53:53] further than that that word that you
[53:56] fail to
[53:58] obey God can never go any deeper unless
[54:02] you allow him to move
[54:05] deeper and you know why Jonah brother
[54:07] Bram I love this why Jonah himself he
[54:11] didn't
[54:12] go his
[54:14] thinking brother BR says he thought he
[54:17] looked at himself I'm a Jew you're
[54:19] calling me to go speak to Gentiles
[54:21] they'll never receive it now I'm not
[54:23] going to ask you but I'm sure there are
[54:26] some professional Bridge builders in
[54:27] here tonight some people who you've got
[54:30] some things right now that that'll never
[54:32] happen that'll never be you know
[54:34] negative NES I hope nobody's name
[54:37] Nancy positive pets you know we but but
[54:41] sometimes there's just listen you we're
[54:43] surrounded by
[54:45] negativity come on you you don't even
[54:47] have to look too deep in your app you
[54:49] get notifications that are
[54:51] negative emojis upside down frowns
[54:55] headstands and whatever more negative
[54:58] all around you are a generation that is
[55:02] being bombarded like no other
[55:05] generation help me now if Satan is doing
[55:09] that then what do you think and how much
[55:12] greater Is God
[55:15] moving brother Samuel it don't seem like
[55:18] I should receive from God thumbs up like
[55:21] you or that smiley face emoji but God
[55:24] knows who you are and God's here to
[55:27] encourage
[55:28] you Hallelujah he knows how to
[55:31] discourage you in the wrong things and
[55:33] encourage you in the right
[55:36] things you're his son you're his
[55:40] daughter
[55:42] amen and he was thinking I can't go down
[55:45] there because if I go down there they're
[55:47] not going to receive it so he ran from
[55:52] the presence of the Lord what what God
[55:55] had called him to do but just because he
[55:57] ran from it did not mean he could Escape
[56:02] it he tried to drown it he tried to get
[56:06] away he tried to go as far as he way
[56:08] away that he could from that but you
[56:11] can't get away from God let me read you
[56:14] the scripture out of Psalms 139 I I love
[56:16] the I love this chapter David said in
[56:19] Psalms 139: 7 I mean when David says you
[56:23] know my up my upright in of my
[56:25] downsitting you know my you you be set
[56:28] me all around in other words David said
[56:30] God you know all about
[56:33] me God knows every detail about your
[56:36] life and about my life and you know what
[56:40] God is not trying to perform plastic
[56:42] surgery on your life the holy oh my let
[56:46] me preach now the Holy Ghost is not a
[56:49] performing of plastic
[56:52] surgery it is God coming in and raising
[56:55] up a son and daughter of God and it's
[56:58] God living through your Veil God living
[57:01] through your
[57:04] temperament God don't want you to be
[57:06] like nobody else he's made you the way
[57:08] he has for a purpose for a reason just
[57:12] say God I'm tired of being frustrated
[57:14] with it and looking at this and trying
[57:17] to do this and trying to do that Lord I
[57:19] would just start right here say God
[57:21] deliver me of a from that part to where
[57:24] I feel under the pressure to be like
[57:26] this pressure to be like that just be
[57:29] honest with him say Lord let that so
[57:32] drop in my life
[57:38] Lord David said in Psalms 139:7 whether
[57:43] shall I go from thy Spirit or whether
[57:45] shall I flee from thy presence where can
[57:48] I where can I
[57:51] go if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art
[57:54] there if I make my bed in hell behold
[57:57] Thou Art there if I take the wings of
[58:00] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[58:02] parts of the sea even there shall thy
[58:06] hand lead me and thy right hand shall
[58:08] hold me you know what I love about this
[58:12] we were all like sheep gone astray you
[58:16] can walk here and walk there but God
[58:20] never leaves
[58:23] you
[58:26] it doesn't matter how low you are he'll
[58:29] go right down there and bring you right
[58:31] out oh you may not be low in sin maybe
[58:34] you're low in your spirit maybe you're
[58:36] low in your mind but God knows just
[58:39] exactly where you are he knows just how
[58:41] to find you and give you a fresh
[58:43] strength give you a fresh courage and
[58:45] that you yourself can take dominion over
[58:48] your own nature instead of letting your
[58:51] nature have dominion over
[58:53] you amen that's
[58:56] right you know God had to help sister
[58:59] Bruce with that God wasn't going to
[59:00] change her temperament but he helped her
[59:03] and equipped her to be able to see this
[59:05] is how you're natured you get somebody
[59:07] on your heart and you got to pray for
[59:09] them you can't you you can't stop until
[59:11] you go do it it'd be like you know
[59:13] somebody probably there's some of us in
[59:14] here tonight oh if you feel like man my
[59:16] car my car was left open or this was
[59:19] happen you try to go to sleep I'm just
[59:20] going to commit it in the hands of God
[59:22] and then you realize sleep ain't coming
[59:24] I better go up and check out what's
[59:27] going on you're made that
[59:30] way now some of you were like not me I
[59:33] said
[59:34] Glory praise the Lord but you see how
[59:37] Satan then would want to work on sister
[59:39] brues brother Bram said how God works
[59:41] now Satan wants to work that same way he
[59:44] said he'll put a thought in your mind to
[59:47] make you think you're not a Christian
[59:50] pointing out all your mistakes all your
[59:52] failures all your all those things what
[59:54] is it it's learning what brother Brown
[59:56] was trying to do is help her by the word
[59:59] see the Dominion that is given to her as
[1:00:02] a daughter of God that she doesn't have
[1:00:05] to live in defeat any longer I have no
[1:00:09] doubt if she had been there with brother
[1:00:11] Bram let's say Sunday after Sunday after
[1:00:13] Sunday she would have walked out of that
[1:00:15] office Victorious but you need something
[1:00:17] more than just say well I I feel real
[1:00:20] good you need to know how to battle the
[1:00:23] enemy
[1:00:26] Amen to know how to battle him to
[1:00:28] understand even how you're made
[1:00:30] up Lord have mercy how did we get
[1:00:36] here
[1:00:39] my nonetheless David said right there
[1:00:41] I'm just got to move on David said
[1:00:43] you're right
[1:00:45] there I want to just just say it in this
[1:00:47] way because there's there's an eternal
[1:00:50] quality to you that's what that's what
[1:00:53] David was expressing this thought that
[1:00:55] God has of you let me just say it like
[1:00:58] that that Eternal part of you is that
[1:01:01] seed that thought of God on the inside
[1:01:05] that's what God is working on you ever
[1:01:08] seen a nail that has maybe a piece of
[1:01:10] plastic around it sometimes we have that
[1:01:13] for uh different uh uh uh tasks that we
[1:01:15] do you know you bring that nail if it's
[1:01:18] iron or I believe it's iron you bring it
[1:01:20] near a magnet it'll stick to that magnet
[1:01:22] but it's not because the plastic
[1:01:26] it's because of the properties in the
[1:01:28] nail that are magnetized to the mag to
[1:01:31] the magnet and that's the same way it is
[1:01:33] in your life it's not my flesh not my
[1:01:36] spirit that is magnetized to the word of
[1:01:39] God it's my
[1:01:42] soul that's that Eternal part and that's
[1:01:45] the part that God is working on to bring
[1:01:49] into
[1:01:50] cooperation with the purpose that he
[1:01:53] always had of you
[1:01:59] Hallelujah this is why brother Brandon
[1:02:01] would just say it you know in this way
[1:02:03] he says if I can if you don't mind me
[1:02:05] quoting this he says if you're a true
[1:02:06] Christian and truly called like Jonah
[1:02:08] was God has already got your fair paid
[1:02:11] get off of the ship going to Tarsus God
[1:02:14] predestinated you to this life if you're
[1:02:16] a true called child of God come to
[1:02:19] Christ come into the fullness of
[1:02:22] him oh my your way is paid to where it's
[1:02:26] paid to Nineveh not to tarus you're
[1:02:29] predestinated and there's a ship leaving
[1:02:31] right now only thing you've got to do to
[1:02:33] get on it but if not you'll never have
[1:02:37] no
[1:02:39] peace Hallelujah brother Bram you know
[1:02:42] he goes on he says remember he draws our
[1:02:44] attention to the scripture I love this
[1:02:46] God was in the
[1:02:50] boat the first the scripture we read in
[1:02:53] our text but the Lord caused the strong
[1:02:57] wind God knows how to get the attention
[1:03:00] of his
[1:03:01] children you know and sometimes God will
[1:03:04] let you go through things just to let
[1:03:07] you see the value he's already saw in
[1:03:12] you I'm telling you God ain't wasting
[1:03:14] his time with you he's never wasted his
[1:03:17] time you have value in the sight of
[1:03:20] almighty
[1:03:22] God Amen there's no way of getting out
[1:03:25] of it God was there in the boat was in
[1:03:27] the storm was in the fish everywhere he
[1:03:30] turned God was
[1:03:33] there Hallelujah I think of a brother
[1:03:36] there back in our assembly older brother
[1:03:39] now brother rap you would know him older
[1:03:42] brother and here he here he was he he
[1:03:45] told me that when he was out there in
[1:03:47] the world and he said here I am he said
[1:03:49] I came up around that bar and they were
[1:03:51] you know they served another another
[1:03:53] drink and and he said all of a sudden
[1:03:55] there begin to be a playing of a hymn on
[1:03:58] on a piano he said' I told him that
[1:04:00] don't belong
[1:04:02] here something begin to call out at that
[1:04:04] moment things begin to turn and to
[1:04:07] change in his life and he's been a
[1:04:10] pillar around this message I think he's
[1:04:11] in his 80s now but I look at that how
[1:04:14] that God you can't get away from the
[1:04:17] presence of almighty God I don't want
[1:04:19] to I don't want to but yet there's
[1:04:22] pressures that come our way than that we
[1:04:24] have to face up to I think as you as
[1:04:27] young people in this in this day and age
[1:04:29] you are faced we all are but there's
[1:04:32] more and more pressure that is being
[1:04:35] placed upon you not just from social
[1:04:37] media and all these other things but
[1:04:39] even the way and the direction that the
[1:04:41] world is going where you are already no
[1:04:44] doubt some of you have had to take a
[1:04:46] stand on your
[1:04:47] jobs and different stands you've had to
[1:04:50] make and I can tell you this here that
[1:04:52] if you stand for God he'll stand for you
[1:04:56] but the way you stand for him is make
[1:04:58] sure your attitude is also in right with
[1:05:00] the word you're standing
[1:05:02] on that's very important not just well
[1:05:05] this is the word but your attitude must
[1:05:07] be right upon that
[1:05:11] word is that all
[1:05:13] right so you know brother B says he's
[1:05:15] after you he says Jonah and where Jonah
[1:05:18] went God was in the boat in the storm in
[1:05:20] the fish he went on being right along
[1:05:22] with Jonah until his perfect will was
[1:05:25] done brother B said if he's after you
[1:05:27] you might Dodge here Dodge there but
[1:05:30] you'll be miserable until you do the
[1:05:32] thing you started out for him to do at
[1:05:34] the first place don't go run from the
[1:05:37] presence of God face up to
[1:05:41] it that's the thing face up to it face
[1:05:44] the issue nobody else could do it for
[1:05:47] Jonah is that
[1:05:48] right Jonah had to do what God told him
[1:05:51] to do well Lord there's a bet not Jon
[1:05:54] out called you to do this so you don't
[1:05:56] want to get out of his presence you want
[1:05:58] to move into his presence brother B said
[1:06:02] that's what we're here for he said if
[1:06:04] you've been a Jonah if you've been
[1:06:06] wondering which way to go or what to do
[1:06:08] come on get on the ship with us tonight
[1:06:11] we're going down to Nineveh to cry out
[1:06:14] we're letting that tarous ship go on
[1:06:16] down if they want to we've got a duty
[1:06:19] before God that's a message that we're
[1:06:22] responsible for so there's a
[1:06:25] responsibility that has come with this
[1:06:28] word a responsibility that God calls us
[1:06:31] to there's things that were issues to be
[1:06:33] faced maybe the issue that's to be faced
[1:06:36] is something that you've tried to run
[1:06:38] from maybe it's to make something right
[1:06:40] that you've looked at and said that
[1:06:42] really don't matter this really don't
[1:06:43] matter but you've got to face the issue
[1:06:46] and say God give me the courage to face
[1:06:49] the issue in the right way because I
[1:06:52] want to be pleasing to you
[1:06:55] I want to walk fully with you
[1:06:59] now here I want to just kind of just
[1:07:02] just just divert just a moment here on
[1:07:04] that thought what are you doing here you
[1:07:08] know there was a man a Prophet by the
[1:07:11] name of
[1:07:12] Elijah and Elijah Oh my he was he he had
[1:07:17] been so anointed when he stood there on
[1:07:20] Mount Carmel everything he had done he
[1:07:23] had done it at the word of the Lord I
[1:07:27] mean there was such a confidence that he
[1:07:30] had but then when the mind of Christ
[1:07:34] when it pulled back off of off Elijah
[1:07:37] the presence of the Lord just you know
[1:07:39] kind of lifted you you you all know what
[1:07:41] I'm talking about when you you walk out
[1:07:42] of service man sometimes on a Sunday or
[1:07:45] maybe you're coming out of camp and
[1:07:46] you're thinking whoa where is that devil
[1:07:51] at he don't worry he's still there
[1:07:55] I'm not telling you that to hunker down
[1:07:57] I'm just letting you know that God is
[1:07:59] strengthening you and equipping you and
[1:08:02] helping you to see the armor that's
[1:08:04] already provided for you and no doubt
[1:08:07] some of you already have he's trying to
[1:08:09] help you to learn how to use
[1:08:13] it because what you don't want to be you
[1:08:16] don't want to go on in your life and
[1:08:18] then your life become up and
[1:08:20] down because God's called you to lead a
[1:08:23] home
[1:08:25] sisters you you God terries here you are
[1:08:27] you're going to be the Fifth Gospel
[1:08:29] there's got to be a standard and what
[1:08:31] I'm talking about a standard an
[1:08:34] absolute and mama can't be the absolute
[1:08:37] daddy can't be the absolute you've got
[1:08:39] to know Jesus Christ in a personal way
[1:08:43] to where now you yourself are yolked and
[1:08:46] high and harnessed and tied to the word
[1:08:48] of God why if not it'll be however the
[1:08:52] wind's blowing right now
[1:08:54] we go this
[1:08:56] way we go this way after this move and
[1:09:00] then a you've got to have an anchor in
[1:09:02] your
[1:09:03] life something to wear that you know
[1:09:06] where you're standing let me just put it
[1:09:08] to you like this that there's no quote
[1:09:11] that can be given to you that will shake
[1:09:14] you but you can say man that's a good
[1:09:16] one and so is this
[1:09:18] one is that all
[1:09:21] right I don't think we're cherrypickers
[1:09:23] here
[1:09:25] how in the world how what are we doing
[1:09:28] here here's
[1:09:31] Elijah
[1:09:34] man and God asked him the
[1:09:37] question what doest thou
[1:09:40] here h e r e
[1:09:45] here and Elijah said I'm the only
[1:09:49] one I'm the only one he felt all alone I
[1:09:53] want ask you to raise your hand but
[1:09:55] sometimes you can be in the midst of a
[1:09:57] crowd of people and feel all
[1:09:59] alone you know me just say like this you
[1:10:02] know Satan can can re he's very
[1:10:04] masterful at it hey I'm not bragging up
[1:10:06] the devil that old that old older little
[1:10:08] sister said he's a good adversary I'm
[1:10:11] just trying to expose and tell you what
[1:10:13] he'll do he can get right into your mind
[1:10:16] don't underestimate that oh the mind's
[1:10:19] nothing the Mind listen the word has to
[1:10:22] pass through the mind
[1:10:24] and if the word has to pass through the
[1:10:26] Mind Satan could have never got to even
[1:10:28] the beginning if she hadn't opened up
[1:10:30] her mind and started to
[1:10:33] listen and then it went down that's the
[1:10:35] same way that he'll come the same way
[1:10:37] that he'll try to lead you away from the
[1:10:39] word if he can't get you away from the
[1:10:42] word then he'll try to isolate you so
[1:10:44] there becomes your own little world you
[1:10:46] start living
[1:10:47] in well the rest of them really don't
[1:10:50] care for me at church so and so listen I
[1:10:52] know what I'm talking about
[1:10:54] I know if you say well brother Samy
[1:10:56] you're just talking to young people
[1:10:57] listen what I'm saying right now can go
[1:11:00] and be applied no matter how old you are
[1:11:04] we still have to battle against thoughts
[1:11:07] like
[1:11:08] that it never
[1:11:12] stops but Elijah this seemed real I mean
[1:11:16] when you got somebody that after what
[1:11:18] has been done on that mount you would
[1:11:20] think my Lord who couldn't who wouldn't
[1:11:23] believe
[1:11:24] but you see what Elijah couldn't
[1:11:27] see he couldn't see that there was a
[1:11:31] courage that had come into 7,000 he
[1:11:34] couldn't see it let me preach now
[1:11:37] sometimes even I can stand as a pastor
[1:11:40] and sometimes there's things that I may
[1:11:42] not see here but God don't always start
[1:11:45] out here God starts in
[1:11:49] here right here in this service in these
[1:11:52] services in my just start out for you
[1:11:56] wiggling that little
[1:11:57] pinky yes Lord I'm a Child of God pretty
[1:12:02] soon you keep wiggling that pinky you'll
[1:12:04] be doing two fingers pretty soon it'll
[1:12:06] be a hand pretty soon the hands will be
[1:12:07] up what it is it it's contagious the
[1:12:11] spirit of God will move as you let him
[1:12:13] move in your life but he brings courage
[1:12:17] to the Inner Man Hey listen those that
[1:12:19] were up up there praying for the
[1:12:20] prodical son his mom and dad never saw
[1:12:22] one fist physical
[1:12:24] evidence but the prophet tells us the
[1:12:26] angel of the Lord went there and dealt
[1:12:28] with his
[1:12:30] heart so let me say this to you that's
[1:12:33] what God is getting lined up is your
[1:12:35] heart is your thoughts is your
[1:12:43] life but I'm the only
[1:12:46] one now I don't think any of us I'm not
[1:12:48] here I'm not here picking on Elijah I
[1:12:51] know what have lik to where you feel
[1:12:52] alone
[1:12:54] and it's real you don't just walk up you
[1:12:57] know Sister Gabby you don't walk up and
[1:12:59] just say hey snap out of
[1:13:01] it God don't work that way sorry God
[1:13:05] don't work that way you know we talk
[1:13:08] about well I ain't going to preach name
[1:13:09] and claim it God don't work that way
[1:13:10] either snap out of
[1:13:12] it God works by his word what we saw in
[1:13:17] the beginning when God wanted to create
[1:13:18] an atmosphere he spoke his word and then
[1:13:22] his presence moved in behind his word
[1:13:25] and created the conditions for
[1:13:31] relationship I'm glad God knows how to
[1:13:33] break down our will without stomping on
[1:13:36] us but he knows how to draw us out I'm
[1:13:40] glad about
[1:13:42] that aren't
[1:13:45] you what are you doing here
[1:13:49] Elijah well you know Elijah after he
[1:13:53] said what he said then the Bible
[1:13:57] said God told him to go stand before the
[1:14:00] Lord stand upon the mountain before the
[1:14:02] Lord and the Lord passed by and a great
[1:14:05] strong uh great and strong wind rent the
[1:14:08] mountains and break in pieces the Rocks
[1:14:11] before the Lord but the Lord was not in
[1:14:14] the wind and after the wind and
[1:14:16] earthquake but the Lord was not in the
[1:14:19] earthquake now it didn't say that those
[1:14:22] things weren't
[1:14:23] effects from him passing by but God
[1:14:27] wasn't just coming by to see if he could
[1:14:29] cause an
[1:14:31] earthquake God wasn't coming by just to
[1:14:33] see can I create a fire that was not the
[1:14:38] purpose you see Elijah needed help oh my
[1:14:43] Elijah was in more than a cave he was in
[1:14:46] here in his own self he was in a cave
[1:14:50] and he needed to be let out and the only
[1:14:53] the only one that could lead him out was
[1:14:55] his God his God that has spoke to him
[1:14:58] time and time again it would take a
[1:15:01] still Small
[1:15:06] Voice I'm not against noise I mean it's
[1:15:10] I think it's kind of evident the way
[1:15:11] that I'm not against noise but I can't
[1:15:13] help but I I am who God has made me to
[1:15:15] be but you know what I don't want you to
[1:15:17] be like me I want you to be how God has
[1:15:18] called you to be you might Worship the
[1:15:21] Lord in such a way there may not be you
[1:15:23] may never be one that shouts that
[1:15:25] doesn't have one thing to do with
[1:15:28] it what it has to do with is has there
[1:15:31] come a still Small Voice in your
[1:15:37] life I hope I can have just a little bit
[1:15:39] of time
[1:15:41] now here he was being being being God
[1:15:45] was Desiring to lead him out of that
[1:15:48] cave now I want you to think about this
[1:15:51] you know off of the Earth
[1:15:53] just today there has been billions of
[1:15:57] water gallons I've got the exact
[1:16:00] number that has
[1:16:04] evaporated did you hear
[1:16:07] it did y'all did you all drive here
[1:16:09] today and say man listen to that water
[1:16:12] evaporating text Brother rap brother rap
[1:16:14] did you hear
[1:16:18] that what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:16:21] sometimes the things that are the
[1:16:22] greatest things that are happening
[1:16:24] happen without any noise out
[1:16:29] here now let me just preach for a little
[1:16:31] bit we understand that the silence
[1:16:34] itself at the opening of The Seven seal
[1:16:37] I believe as young people we understand
[1:16:39] that part that's the coming of the Lord
[1:16:40] his presence Among Us that's why we
[1:16:44] worship that's why we can praise when we
[1:16:46] see our names in the
[1:16:49] book John himself John saw the 4 and 20
[1:16:53] Elders roll their crowns it didn't move
[1:16:55] him John heard the angels didn't move
[1:16:58] him but when John saw his name boy
[1:17:03] that's where John tore loose in his own
[1:17:06] way in his own way so John wants moved
[1:17:09] by the Angels was not moved by the 420
[1:17:11] Elders John was moved by the word where
[1:17:15] John the prophet said it like this John
[1:17:17] looked and said there's
[1:17:21] John that's what bring real Worship in
[1:17:24] your life not a worship that ends when
[1:17:27] the music ends not a worship that ends
[1:17:30] when Camp ends but a warship that goes
[1:17:33] through your life when you go to school
[1:17:36] when you go to work you are a true
[1:17:44] worshiper Elijah what are you doing
[1:17:48] here this is what I always I don't know
[1:17:51] I guess I'm probably just a little bit
[1:17:53] slow some of these other brothers are
[1:17:55] smarter but you know I I just brother
[1:17:58] rap being honest I've always looked at
[1:17:59] that when brother bradam when he
[1:18:00] preached the message brother brand says
[1:18:02] what doest thou hear h e a
[1:18:08] Elijah but the scripture says what doest
[1:18:11] thou here h e re
[1:18:18] E I mean that to me is what strikes me
[1:18:21] because you see I I had always pondered
[1:18:23] that but I want you to think of this
[1:18:25] what you hear will speak to where you
[1:18:28] presently are
[1:18:32] here are you hearing me what you hear
[1:18:35] will presently speak to where you are
[1:18:38] here and what and and and now with what
[1:18:41] you can what what you're able to grasp
[1:18:44] then then with love courage and ability
[1:18:47] he'll give you Grace to catch where you
[1:18:50] need to be see God is Not coming to
[1:18:53] Elijah said what in the world are you
[1:18:55] doing here what in the
[1:18:58] world what come on man you're still
[1:19:03] here you're still here in justification
[1:19:06] or you know wherever you're at in your
[1:19:07] States I mean here what are you still
[1:19:09] doing here you've been filled with the
[1:19:11] spirit of God and here you are just just
[1:19:13] kind of just wandering around just
[1:19:15] moping around what are you doing here no
[1:19:17] God just listen God don't come to shame
[1:19:20] us God doesn't have to Guilt Trip us
[1:19:23] come on we just come through that kind
[1:19:25] of a season right now are you going to
[1:19:27] get a gift for so and
[1:19:29] so
[1:19:34] no come on everybody knows it everybody
[1:19:36] got family members that are guilt
[1:19:40] Trippers oh Lord hope that clip don't
[1:19:43] get out but notice but if you'll yield
[1:19:46] to that still small voice but it was as
[1:19:49] the Lord passed by there was an effect
[1:19:51] surely upon on the surroundings but it
[1:19:54] was the still Small Voice that brought a
[1:19:57] settl in
[1:19:59] Elijah brother Bram says if you're
[1:20:01] listening for anything but the still
[1:20:03] Small Voice get back in the
[1:20:06] cave that's that the straight words
[1:20:09] brother BR tells us he says you know he
[1:20:11] says here we come he said men and women
[1:20:12] can grow up shouting and praising God
[1:20:14] speaking in tongues belonging in the
[1:20:16] church dancing in the spirit paying ties
[1:20:18] how many knows brother BR believed in
[1:20:19] all that how many of us believe in all
[1:20:22] that
[1:20:23] but he says and still not be in their
[1:20:25] heart that still small voice of God's
[1:20:28] Rich deep
[1:20:30] love a still Small Voice that speaks
[1:20:33] down in your heart that changes every
[1:20:36] attitude makes the nature different and
[1:20:39] you become a new creature in
[1:20:41] Christ I'm not going to I'm I'm just
[1:20:43] going to say something but I want you
[1:20:44] raise your hand because I want your
[1:20:45] friends get mad at you but no doubt
[1:20:46] everybody's got
[1:20:48] friends that's somewhere along the line

[1:21:04] you talk that yeah yeah
[1:21:07] but but you see sometimes with us we're
[1:21:11] too busy telling God why we
[1:21:14] can't we're too busy telling God how
[1:21:16] unqualified we are let me just tell you
[1:21:19] something you're you're talking with him
[1:21:22] who knows you you're talking with a God
[1:21:26] who knew you listen and has directed
[1:21:29] clear from his mind has directed the
[1:21:32] course of life and has even watched over
[1:21:35] your great great grandfather he's
[1:21:37] watched over your father he watched over
[1:21:39] your mother God has watched over his
[1:21:41] seed because his seed is him it's his
[1:21:46] word and he's taken that kind of care to
[1:21:49] watch over it then let me tell you don't
[1:21:51] you think that he'll take that kind of
[1:21:53] care to see that the word itself comes
[1:21:56] to full fruition in your
[1:21:59] life sure he
[1:22:05] will just say it like this his voice is
[1:22:08] his
[1:22:09] word that effect of that still Small
[1:22:12] Voice let me tell you what it did it
[1:22:13] brings and instills a deepness of Faith
[1:22:16] that'll stand firm in the midst of every
[1:22:20] storm in the midst of the time of
[1:22:22] Temptation you might say well brother
[1:22:24] Samu I I have fallen in temptation but
[1:22:27] it will give you strength to get back up
[1:22:29] and to
[1:22:32] overcome because it's
[1:22:35] true see we want to we don't want just
[1:22:38] to have an earthquake or a fire we want
[1:22:41] the effect of the word in every area of
[1:22:45] Our Lives let me tell you when God gets
[1:22:47] on the inside they'll bring some
[1:22:49] earthquakes going on there'll be some
[1:22:51] fire going going on where God is doing
[1:22:54] what consuming more and more and more of
[1:22:57] our life where there's some Earth being
[1:23:00] moved where there's character being
[1:23:01] molded it'll be God working from the
[1:23:05] inside of our Lives because God knows if
[1:23:10] that still small voice and it becomes a
[1:23:13] settl in your life don't worry about
[1:23:15] thunder your life will be Thunder
[1:23:18] against the devil brother Bram said oh
[1:23:20] how we need thousands
[1:23:23] of lived voices in Jeffersonville
[1:23:26] thundering out Purity you might be a
[1:23:28] sister that maybe you don't shout a bit
[1:23:31] maybe as the sister you're one the say
[1:23:33] well brother Samuel I'm T I'm a little
[1:23:34] bit timid ain't nothing to be afraid of
[1:23:36] and ashamed about being timid because I
[1:23:38] guarantee you when push comes to shove
[1:23:40] if the devil wanted to try to back you
[1:23:41] up on the word you'd stand right there
[1:23:43] and say I'll give my life for this word
[1:23:45] that's worship right there sis that's
[1:23:48] real worship sure ain't nothing wrong
[1:23:50] with shouting ain't nothing wrong with
[1:23:52] with all that but listen with the real
[1:23:54] reality of it there's got to be a
[1:23:56] thunder that when you walk on the school
[1:23:59] you walk into the job you may not say
[1:24:02] one word right here but your life will
[1:24:04] Thunder
[1:24:07] out Purity
[1:24:10] Holiness that's the kind of Thunder I
[1:24:12] want I thank God for the Thunder oh my I
[1:24:15] love the fire I love the earthquakes but
[1:24:17] I I I I need to be moved in here that's
[1:24:19] why I need to be moved sometimes I get I
[1:24:21] can get settled in my ways anybody ever
[1:24:23] get settled in your ways maybe I'm just
[1:24:25] the only one maybe I'll take four or
[1:24:26] five people and we'll just go preach to
[1:24:28] ourselves here for a minute you get
[1:24:29] settled in your own ways and we need God
[1:24:32] lord I want you to come by Lord move
[1:24:34] over my life but you realize you can't
[1:24:36] create that that's why the prophet could
[1:24:39] say in a message before the new year
[1:24:41] recognizing your day in its message God
[1:24:44] create in me what's lacking in my life
[1:24:49] help me to be a more humbler servant a
[1:24:52] better servant more willing I'll say God
[1:24:56] help
[1:25:01] me see that sadl you think about it
[1:25:05] brother Welch Evans was one of
[1:25:07] those he was one that he couldn't get he
[1:25:11] couldn't get settled in his life brother
[1:25:13] Bram said brother brother Welch said you
[1:25:15] know brother bramy said I would go over
[1:25:16] here and go over to brother Jagger
[1:25:18] school and I'd go stay there three
[1:25:19] months and I'd go here and I'd go there
[1:25:22] and he says I never got to any place
[1:25:25] that I could ever have any Assurance if
[1:25:28] I do this if I do that or what I might
[1:25:30] do here I am or I am not till I heard
[1:25:34] your
[1:25:35] teachings that settled it once for all
[1:25:38] for the worshipper once purged from his
[1:25:40] sins has no more conscience of sin no
[1:25:45] more
[1:25:47] desire on the inside Satan can come out
[1:25:49] here and tempt this but there's no more
[1:25:51] desire in here
[1:25:52] remember don't try to then put this guy
[1:25:54] back in the picture remember this guy is
[1:25:57] the plastic over that
[1:26:01] nail you don't want to get that plastic
[1:26:04] get you know really built up no we don't
[1:26:06] want that plastic get built up just let
[1:26:07] the plastic serve its place its purpose
[1:26:11] to just be a
[1:26:13] display for the glory of God to show
[1:26:17] forth this is why again I hope this all
[1:26:19] right this is why you have then here's a
[1:26:21] man brother tells you about in a couple
[1:26:23] different places of the message word

[1:26:47] raise my hands and say you know that
[1:26:49] that that I accepted the Lord he said
[1:26:51] then he said I went for a little bit but

[1:26:55] Methodist he said man they said you got
[1:26:57] a shout he said I got so happy he said I
[1:26:59] started to shout and they said bless God

[1:27:03] there's something that still just wasn't
[1:27:04] settled he said then I got over there he
[1:27:06] said with the Pentecostals and they said
[1:27:08] you got to speak in tongues and he said
[1:27:10] I tell you he said the anointing of the
[1:27:11] spirit of God came in there and I
[1:27:13] started speaking in tongues he said but
[1:27:15] you know it just seems like I'm just not
[1:27:17] able to get where I need to be and
[1:27:19] brother random says it's so simple he he
[1:27:22] said brother he said the problem is you
[1:27:26] weren't straightened out right in the
[1:27:28] beginning he said now think about it sir

[1:28:16] a mistake but they can see here's
[1:28:18] somebody that can say forgive me I said
[1:28:20] that wrong I shouldn't have said said

[1:28:24] that they're looking at a standard of
[1:28:26] the word being lived out in your
[1:28:29] life he said was there a time that you
[1:28:32] didn't love the Lord hell he said well

[1:31:12] an afternoon stroll or a nature hike in
[1:31:16] a place that's
[1:31:19] prickly but I want to just see see this
[1:31:22] right here that the prophet is waiting
[1:31:24] through
[1:31:26] this and he's coming through there
[1:31:28] because there's a call that's going out
[1:31:30] come to miltown brother Bram gets up
[1:31:34] tells the congregation he said there's
[1:31:35] going to be a letter or something coming
[1:31:36] in here because there's there's a need
[1:31:37] down in
[1:31:39] miltown nobody knows where mil Town's at
[1:31:43] I know it's hard to believe in this
[1:31:44] Young Generation you'd say give me my
[1:31:46] phone right now I'll should know they
[1:31:47] didn't have none of that then I don't
[1:31:49] even know if ran Rand MCN had been born
[1:31:51] yet
[1:31:56] it goes to the next Sunday a week passes
[1:31:59] by finally here's a man that stands in
[1:32:00] the congregation says hey I know where
[1:32:02] that's at you see sometimes the answer
[1:32:05] to your request may not come in the time
[1:32:08] that you're looking for it it may not
[1:32:11] even come with the people that you're
[1:32:12] looking for it but God can bring
[1:32:14] somebody in and it isn't that that
[1:32:16] person is special it's God you know what
[1:32:18] God's trying to help you and I see trust
[1:32:21] me
[1:32:22] I know who to put in your
[1:32:24] life to bring Direction bring
[1:32:27] help value I I
[1:32:31] know now you find a situation that's
[1:32:34] down this is what I I want to trying to
[1:32:35] move to what are you doing here here She
[1:32:37] is in a situation she's got TB she's
[1:32:41] been laying in a bed for nine months
[1:32:42] most of you have been around the message
[1:32:44] you you've heard this story over and
[1:32:45] over but for me it wasn't until I think
[1:32:47] within the past year I stumbled across
[1:32:49] this this this quote where I was looking
[1:32:52] at it and brother Bram tells us why she
[1:32:54] would had the condition she had of TV
[1:32:58] she had that condition of TB not because
[1:33:00] of any choice that she had
[1:33:05] made are you hearing me listen Daniel
[1:33:09] and Joseph were in
[1:33:12] situations that they didn't choose to be
[1:33:14] in now listen they could have chose and
[1:33:17] took on victim
[1:33:19] mentality I'm always oppressed they
[1:33:21] could have took that on now listen it
[1:33:23] don't mean that they didn't battle
[1:33:26] that but where they were at God they God
[1:33:30] was working with them and they had to
[1:33:32] submit to overcome Daniel could have
[1:33:34] said what did I do to get down
[1:33:36] here I was walking with God and here I
[1:33:39] am snatched away and taken down here in
[1:33:41] Babylon I didn't ask for
[1:33:43] this he could say I wouldn't like a lot
[1:33:45] of these sorry outfits of one serving
[1:33:47] God
[1:33:48] no Joseph look at Joseph Joseph going to
[1:33:51] say what do I deserve to be
[1:33:54] here now you think listen to me you
[1:33:57] think that he didn't those feelings
[1:33:59] didn't come to him they
[1:34:02] did Brother brandham tells us in a
[1:34:04] message a prisoner he said he cried and
[1:34:07] cried and cried and cried but you know
[1:34:11] why God had Joseph down there in that
[1:34:13] prison the prophet tells us in a
[1:34:15] prisoner because there was a little
[1:34:17] speck in Joseph's life that he felt like
[1:34:21] he was
[1:34:23] somebody and God couldn't use that
[1:34:28] feeling in his life God said it's got to
[1:34:31] be totally
[1:34:36] surrendered that's why the prophet could
[1:34:38] say that the gift he put in Joseph life
[1:34:40] is finally what got him out of
[1:34:42] there now think about this you and I why
[1:34:45] is this why is this I'm probably sure
[1:34:47] nobody in here says that why me flat
[1:34:50] tire why by
[1:34:53] me probably nobody nobody says
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:58] no well just in case I say that
[1:35:02] sometimes man again everything was lined
[1:35:05] out perfectly date night tonight and
[1:35:08] this comes
[1:35:09] up I don't know I love date night my
[1:35:12] wife I'm talking about my wife let's
[1:35:16] clarify that
[1:35:17] one oh yeah I still get the butterflies
[1:35:20] for it boy
[1:35:22] I love
[1:35:26] it but you know she was in the condition
[1:35:28] she was in this is what struck
[1:35:33] me the Brier she had was a church that
[1:35:37] didn't believe in Divine Healing but she
[1:35:40] was in the condition she was in because
[1:35:42] her uncle had taken her to piano
[1:35:45] lessons and had ravished
[1:35:48] her he had exploited her she didn't ask
[1:35:52] for
[1:35:55] that I just read remember how brother
[1:35:57] Ram talks about Marilyn Monroe he said I
[1:35:59] knew what she needed if I could have
[1:36:01] just got to her I just had done some
[1:36:04] reading on different ones of certain
[1:36:06] ones down through time I never had known
[1:36:10] this before when I was reading on
[1:36:11] different individual she was even an
[1:36:13] individual that had been ravished over
[1:36:15] and overpassed from foster home to
[1:36:17] foster home to foster home you see what
[1:36:20] Satan will do he'll try to take an area
[1:36:22] of your life and exploit
[1:36:24] it let me tell you what the healing
[1:36:26] power of God will do she took a hold of
[1:36:29] a word and said if God Did It for that
[1:36:33] person he can do it for
[1:36:35] me this is what I stands out to me not
[1:36:38] only did God raise her up off of that
[1:36:40] cot but immediately she goes in the yard
[1:36:44] and starts just thinking the Lord and
[1:36:46] right after that goes right over to the
[1:36:48] piano and starts playing usually
[1:36:51] something you've been traumatized by
[1:36:53] you'll say I can't say I don't want to
[1:36:55] be around that but she went right
[1:36:57] through to that how did she do it it
[1:36:59] wasn't mind over matter but God's mind
[1:37:02] had come down and broke the complex
[1:37:06] broke the fear broke that where Satan
[1:37:09] was wanting to hinder in her
[1:37:10] life brother BR said there she stood as
[1:37:13] my piano player in miltown from there on
[1:37:16] take that
[1:37:17] devil that's the same way in your life
[1:37:20] Hallelujah
[1:37:22] we could go on but I'm just going to
[1:37:24] close there's channels there's areas in
[1:37:28] your life but you know where it's got to
[1:37:30] come to it's like finally those guys
[1:37:32] said to Jonah Jonah
[1:37:37] hey what what what do we have to do
[1:37:39] because you're you're here and it's
[1:37:41] nothing but
[1:37:42] trouble he said got you got to get me
[1:37:45] out of the ship I'm going the wrong
[1:37:48] direction see that's important that you
[1:37:50] know
[1:37:52] you're headed the wrong
[1:37:54] way because when you can face up to that
[1:37:58] then God can help you to get right back
[1:38:00] on
[1:38:02] track no matter where you're at in your
[1:38:04] journey but so those guys they weren't
[1:38:06] going to throw Jonah out you know how
[1:38:08] this how the scripture goes they started
[1:38:10] roolling to
[1:38:13] shore they weren't going nowhere to no
[1:38:16] avail finally it came to this Jon Jonah
[1:38:20] said you got have to throw me
[1:38:22] over you know what you know what had
[1:38:24] happened Jonah had finally come to a
[1:38:27] place to say Lord I'm G to stop
[1:38:30] running I'm GNA stop
[1:38:32] running it's time that these are issues
[1:38:35] that I've been I've been running from in
[1:38:37] my
[1:38:39] life maybe there's a an issue that
[1:38:42] you've run
[1:38:44] from of really a real repentance with
[1:38:49] God maybe it's an issue of a
[1:38:54] relationship maybe it's an issue in your
[1:38:57] life that you're running from and God's
[1:38:59] got a call on your
[1:39:05] life maybe what you're running
[1:39:08] from the enemy has wed to make you
[1:39:11] ashamed of it like he'd have likeed to
[1:39:12] put Georgie Carter in a place and locked
[1:39:16] her away as if it was her
[1:39:20] fault
[1:39:22] I can't explain it to you tonight
[1:39:24] because I don't have words to explain it
[1:39:26] but I can tell you what God did for
[1:39:28] Georgie Carter that same God is here
[1:39:33] tonight and that same God what he did
[1:39:35] for her I can't explain that how how
[1:39:38] that a little a little girl brother Bram
[1:39:41] said 37 pounds brother Bram said it like
[1:39:43] this he said I don't know how she even
[1:39:44] got the strength to get off that bed he
[1:39:48] said the only thing I know is when God
[1:39:51] is moving you and calling you he said
[1:39:54] he'll give you the strength you
[1:39:56] need I believe God will give you the
[1:39:59] strength and is giving you the strength
[1:40:02] to face some issues right here
[1:40:05] tonight let's just say to Lord beginning
[1:40:08] right here
[1:40:09] tonight maybe there's some channels in
[1:40:12] your life that you've not surrendered to
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:16] Lord maybe there's some things like I
[1:40:18] said you've you've run from and you need
[1:40:20] to say Lord I I I I'm I'm running from
[1:40:23] because it's it's fearful remember Jonah
[1:40:25] his thinking his thinking was they'll
[1:40:28] not receive
[1:40:29] me but if you can just
[1:40:31] receive God's
[1:40:34] thoughts God's thoughts have never
[1:40:36] changed about you God don't see you as a
[1:40:39] coward God don't see you as a
[1:40:42] quitter God sees you as his son and
[1:40:45] daughter of God that he's called and
[1:40:47] called upon with a responsibility it
[1:40:50] might be tough to face the issue but
[1:40:52] listen if you will let the Holy Spirit
[1:40:55] just even in this moment the courage
[1:40:57] that he's given you God will give you
[1:41:00] the strength and you watch how the Holy
[1:41:02] Spirit Will begin to go down in that
[1:41:04] area of your life let me just tell you
[1:41:05] something the Lord is not one who says
[1:41:08] you need to go down in that area of your
[1:41:09] life but here's what he'll do he will
[1:41:11] come right down there and he will take
[1:41:14] your hand and he will walk right through
[1:41:18] the channels of your life
[1:41:22] he'll say let's let's go face this
[1:41:25] together let's let's take this together
[1:41:27] now it may not be something that's just
[1:41:29] like that you could look at Georgie
[1:41:31] Carter and said well for her it was just
[1:41:32] like that but it begin with a word that
[1:41:34] she took a hold of it's got to you got
[1:41:37] to take a hold of the word first and you
[1:41:39] take a hold of the word the word has
[1:41:42] within it the strength to bring the
[1:41:44] change that's needed in your
[1:41:47] life God is more than enough to change
[1:41:51] your
[1:41:52] circumstance it's a moment that we can
[1:41:54] have right here tonight to face the
[1:41:57] issues I'd say God I don't want to run
[1:41:59] from it I want to run to him the fair's
[1:42:03] already been paid you you don't have to
[1:42:04] work anything up you don't have all you
[1:42:06] have to do you have to accept what God
[1:42:08] has already provided for you he's
[1:42:09] provided an escape and a liberty that
[1:42:13] you can walk from where you're at to
[1:42:16] where you need to
[1:42:17] be let's just bow our heads
[1:42:26] Heavenly
[1:42:27] Father
[1:42:29] Lord I know was a
[1:42:34] strange thought
[1:42:37] but what are we doing
[1:42:40] here Lord I I don't believe that even in
[1:42:44] this camp that we're here by
[1:42:48] circumstance I believe we're here by
[1:42:50] design
[1:42:51] Lord father I thank those same stairs
[1:42:54] that I walked down moments
[1:42:57] ago I
[1:43:00] remember nine years ago walking down
[1:43:03] those stairs I still remember that young
[1:43:05] man's face when I walked down to begin
[1:43:08] to pray with different
[1:43:11] ones that young man stood there and said
[1:43:13] brother
[1:43:14] Samuel I came to the camp and I I didn't
[1:43:17] come for the right reasons I just came
[1:43:19] because of all my friends were here he
[1:43:22] said but
[1:43:24] something has
[1:43:26] changed I I want to know God in a
[1:43:30] personal
[1:43:32] way Lord I I've often thought about that
[1:43:37] because it just shows that sometimes
[1:43:38] Lord you're not even bothered with
[1:43:41] sometimes the reasons that we would even
[1:43:43] come to Camp or come to a meeting I know
[1:43:46] we we understand how important it is to
[1:43:48] have the right motive to have the right
[1:43:50] objetive Ive but Lord you know what it
[1:43:52] is to get us into your
[1:43:56] presence and it might have been because
[1:43:58] we've come for a friend maybe it was
[1:43:59] because a parent had urged us maybe it
[1:44:01] something but God once in your presence
[1:44:05] the motive and objective things begin to
[1:44:07] change in your presence Lord begins just
[1:44:11] Lord just to just Lord a melding away of
[1:44:14] any of the hardness Lord that's buil up
[1:44:16] maybe from circumstances of Life maybe
[1:44:20] Lord from Lord things that haven't gone
[1:44:23] like we thought they should have gone
[1:44:25] maybe there's things Lord to wear lives
[1:44:27] Lord right here that God right here
[1:44:31] tonight Lord they can look back and they
[1:44:35] Lord maybe they're just so caught with
[1:44:37] looking Lord at
[1:44:38] failures but may they Lord just look to
[1:44:42] you who's dealt with their heart you who
[1:44:45] spoke to their life maybe there's an
[1:44:47] area Lord in their life that they
[1:44:49] themselves could say oh I I don't know
[1:44:52] if I could go there but Lord Your Grace
[1:44:55] is here tonight to bring healing in
[1:44:59] every area of the life your presence has
[1:45:02] come down
[1:45:04] lord and you let us know Lord the
[1:45:08] value that we have in your
[1:45:10] sight you were willing not only to come
[1:45:13] from Glory but to shed your blood and to
[1:45:17] send back the Holy Ghost to send Lord a
[1:45:20] message Lord in this generation that
[1:45:23] really opens the real clear view of
[1:45:26] Calvary what it was all about where men
[1:45:29] had tried to close it off and opens it
[1:45:31] back to a place to realize that God has
[1:45:35] come in order to have a
[1:45:39] relationship with
[1:45:41] me maybe here
[1:45:43] tonight it's a facing an issue maybe
[1:45:46] you've just become busied with the cares
[1:45:48] of life maybe there's a lot of things
[1:45:51] that are there that maybe it's with
[1:45:53] school and other things don't listen
[1:45:55] don't don't feel condemned about that
[1:45:57] but allow the Holy Spirit why don't you
[1:45:59] just allow him to bring a renewing in
[1:46:02] your
[1:46:03] heart bring a renewing and a
[1:46:06] refreshing maybe right here this as this
[1:46:09] this meeting it's already started in an
[1:46:11] afternoon session maybe we could just
[1:46:13] say Lord just tenderize us Lord in your
[1:46:16] presence soften us up
[1:46:19] Lord
[1:46:21] father I
[1:46:23] pray God
[1:46:26] may you move Lord by your
[1:46:29] spirit Lord any hold I think of that
[1:46:33] little
[1:46:34] lady your Prophet walked into that
[1:46:36] insane
[1:46:37] institution why she didn't look abnormal
[1:46:41] she didn't even look like she belonged
[1:46:43] there but your prophet he looked around
[1:46:46] he said where do I even
[1:46:48] start and she looked up up at him and
[1:46:50] said
[1:46:53] sir start here with
[1:46:56] me start with
[1:46:58] me Lord there were situations there were
[1:47:01] things that had taken place in her
[1:47:04] life and had led her down paths she was
[1:47:07] ashamed of never wanted to go down those
[1:47:11] paths but because she had been taken
[1:47:13] advantage of then she just said she just
[1:47:16] went to wasting her
[1:47:18] life Lord life is a precious thing
[1:47:22] you've given it to
[1:47:24] us I pray heavenly
[1:47:26] father that as you went down to that
[1:47:29] little
[1:47:30] lady you raised her from the condition
[1:47:32] she was
[1:47:34] in turned her life around so completely
[1:47:39] Lord father right here
[1:47:41] tonight I know the needs Lord among us
[1:47:44] they're so they're great
[1:47:48] Lord but you're greater
[1:47:51] you're greater Lord may you just just
[1:47:54] breathe Lord upon every life and every
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:58] heart may you move Lord I pray just for
[1:48:01] every single need Lord I believe you
[1:48:03] already have right through the word I I
[1:48:05] believe that I've Got Confidence in that
[1:48:06] Lord but I pray tonight Lord if there's
[1:48:09] any that Lord would maybe they Lord
[1:48:11] would be in need of prayer maybe Lord in
[1:48:14] their heart Lord just in their heart
[1:48:16] Lord just wanting to Lord just say Lord
[1:48:20] I I just want to rededicate myself
[1:48:24] Lord to
[1:48:26] you one we couldn't just stand in his
[1:48:32] presence I think that'd be a good thing
[1:48:34] right
[1:48:41] now just to really just to say
[1:48:45] Lord I just want to commit everything
[1:48:48] into your hands maybe it's a situation
[1:48:52] maybe it's your
[1:48:53] life maybe it's an area of your life
[1:48:56] could we
[1:48:57] just as we're gathered together and
[1:48:59] respectfully maybe brother to brother I
[1:49:02] know we've got husbands and wives in
[1:49:03] here but in a respectful Godly manner
[1:49:06] maybe just a lay hand on that one next
[1:49:08] to you if it's a brother to brother a
[1:49:10] sister to
[1:49:12] sister let's just offer a word of
[1:49:17] prayer Heavenly Father
[1:49:22] we're here for a purpose
[1:49:24] Lord our heart's desire Lord God is Lord
[1:49:28] that every one of our hearts Lord May
[1:49:31] every channel of our life Lord from our
[1:49:34] heart to every Avenue to every faculty
[1:49:36] Lord that it would be dedicated to you
[1:49:39] Lord father I pray that God May Lord
[1:49:43] Jesus as you have spoken Lord here
[1:49:46] already Lord in these services today
[1:49:49] Lord God that that it would just come to
[1:49:51] such a settled place if there's a Heart
[1:49:53] Lord that maybe they haven't been
[1:49:54] settled up to this place but Lord may
[1:49:57] that be the moment Lord that they would
[1:49:59] be able to look Lord in their life CU
[1:50:01] sometimes Lord when we hear that of a
[1:50:03] still Small Voice we wonder well how
[1:50:06] will it sound how will it be but it's to
[1:50:08] notice the effect after that voice has
[1:50:10] spoke to us our life has been
[1:50:13] changed now Lord I pray that God that
[1:50:16] you would speak in the depths of the
[1:50:19] hearts of your people may you encourage
[1:50:22] maybe any Elijah that is Lord hidden
