[38:17] why after all these years is the promise
[38:21] the promise of his returning enough to
[38:24] hold their faithfulness
[38:26] I just
[38:28] I don't understand it
[38:31] but never mind that
[38:33] it doesn't matter
[38:35] soon I will be the king
[38:37] and hope or no hope
[38:39] they will have nothing to say on the
[38:42] matter
[38:45] wait
[38:49] there's more isn't there
[38:52] I demand to know what it is
[38:55] well my Lord
[38:57] there's a rumor we heard the townspeople
[39:01] talking about it yes what of this rumor
[39:04] well the word is
[39:06] that the king
[39:08] is indeed alive
[39:11] and furthermore he's coming back to sit
[39:14] on that throne
[39:18] [Laughter]
[39:23] oh that's we've been hearing that for
[39:26] years it means nothing it's just a
[39:28] peasants fairy tale that they wish would
[39:30] come true just forget about it
[39:32] yes my Lord but
[39:34] this is different this word came by one
[39:38] the people call eaglehood
[39:43] he is their messenger of Hope
[39:49] the message he brings they are never
[39:50] false
[39:55] good heavens
[39:57] he is coming
[39:59] what am I to do we have we have to think
[40:03] of something you think help me think
[40:05] think start thinking start thinking okay
[40:07] we just need to think of something to do
[40:09] and we can think about it we think about
[40:11] it long enough oh just get out of my way
[40:14] oh stop touching me oh
[40:19] do you have an idea how much this cost
[40:22] my my Lord
[40:27] my Lord I have an idea
[40:30] you
[40:31] you have an idea yes my Lord all right
[40:36] well let's hear it this time well
[40:45] even if the old one does return
[40:49] [Laughter]
[40:56] that is my father most ridiculous idea I
[41:01] have ever heard in my life get back to
[41:04] just don't stand in the corner
[41:06] and leave the thinking to those who are
[41:08] used to it
[41:14] wait a minute
[41:16] turn around don't look at me no no in
[41:18] the corner don't even look at me
[41:20] I've got it
[41:23] I can make them love me
[41:25] I could win their hearts and their
[41:26] devotions even before their King returns
[41:29] that is it
[41:31] I didn't tell you to turn around
[41:33] actually you can turn around now
[41:35] that's it that's a good one but
[41:39] how will you make them love you my Lord
[41:43] oh I don't know how you're supposed to
[41:46] be thinking help me think
[41:49] think
[41:54] my Lord this isn't working people get up
[41:58] watch
[42:01] I should think that if you were to offer
[42:04] the people something they've never had
[42:06] before something flashy and high-tech
[42:08] like that new Gadget that da Vinci had
[42:10] that might make him love you flashy and
[42:13] high-tech huh
[42:15] it's not a bad idea
[42:16] but that would cost me a fortune you
[42:18] fool who do you think I am sir Gates
[42:30] now how many think of ideas that are
[42:31] more feasible
[42:36] hey hey
[42:39] Hey listen hey I got an idea I got an
[42:43] idea spit it out we could
[42:46] we could write up a decree
[42:49] that says that the people like you the
[42:52] best I am the best you are and we have
[42:56] them sign their name on it yes
[42:58] and if they don't sign it then we pound
[43:01] them
[43:03] yeah I like them
[43:06] I do enjoy a good pounding
[43:09] hmm
[43:11] foreign
[43:13] that might just work
[43:17] we make them think
[43:19] they're getting a choice
[43:21] but all the while we will lure them in
[43:25] with the feast and honor of the loyal
[43:28] people of Kingstown
[43:30] and while at the feast I will then ma
[43:33] the good reputation of The King and I
[43:36] will win their devotions with food in
[43:39] attainment and pleasures
[43:43] beyond their wildest dreams
[43:45] and while no longer in their right Minds
[43:48] we shall have them vote
[43:50] for who they want to be the next king
[43:51] and they will undoubtedly
[43:53] choose me
[43:55] [Laughter]
[43:57] I'm good
[44:01] yes no I am the best
[44:04] [Laughter]
[44:07] my Lord
