TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] waking up another heavy heart and burdens I can't bear does anybody care see anymore [Music] so close when I'm in prayer that's when I close my eyes take some time to relax that he was always there the truth is he never [Music] that is what the spirit says [Music] and so much is on my mind [Music] don't deserve [Applause] this you know you know love you best open up so he can breathe again and put the storm to rain that's when I close my eyes I take some time and realize that he was always there truth is what the spirit says [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's when I close my eyes and take some time and relax that he was always there and Truth is what the spirit says and I believe it's so I never have to be alone oh I never have to be alone then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I have a hungered hungered and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in now notice Jesus is using this he's using the word I and as if he was the one that's hungered he's the ones that's thirsty in these conditions he's saying I was hungered you gave me me I was thirsty and you gave me a drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and ye clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when Saul we thee a hundred hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked in clothe thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in so much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me after Sunday we we're very blessed to be able to see Mary Magdalene and to see the the special place that God gave Mary Magdalene and that special calling or that special place that he gave her kind of surprised us all I never looked at it that way maybe you had before but we were very blessed and very surprised to see who it was the least likely person at the end at the very closing hours of Jesus Earthly journey and just before the the Resurrection the least likely person at the end got to got the first view of his glory in the Resurrection the least likely person and uh it's not because that Mary Magdalene was better or it's not because she had a good past because she did not have a good past it's not because that she had done anything better than the disciples it's not because of any of her Merit it's not because of any of her background uh it wasn't because any of that it was just God's grace and God's mercy but it teaches us something that God is not a god of position and rank and how much you do or how little you do or we how many know that this gospel is not based upon how many works you do to gain entrance into the kingdom and God doesn't judge you according to your Works can you say man uh uh God does not look at things that way and this is an example that surprised us to see her to be able to view the glory of God as the first one in the resurrection not because she was better or she had a great past but I believe it was because she was just simply focused on the right thing Mary Magdalene in the closing hours of Jesus life was focused on the right thing and incidentally the other disciples were not focused on the right thing they were focused on their carnality they were focused on losing Jesus they weren't focused on the promise and I don't know how much Revelation that Mary had but she had enough of her that she wanted to stay close to the Lord stay close to his body even though he had already passed on as what we know it it was a lifeless body but she she was focused on the right thing and she was faithful to the right thing and she was staying close to the right thing I wonder if God looks at it that way it's not so much that we have a lot of Works to bring to him but that we in this closing hours and how many believe were in the closing hours of time that we would be focused on the correct thing that we would be faithful to the right thing that we would stay close to the right thing and to not judge ourselves someone was asking for prayer last week is that they continually be be beat up by the enemy and beat themselves up that I'm not doing enough and I don't seem to be enough doing enough to please the Lord and the devil's always doing that but in when it comes to God's grace friends God is not judging by our works but I wonder if it's just as simple as Mary Magdalene she just basically focused on the right thing at the right hour she was focused on the right thing how many would raise your hand this morning say God in these closing seconds of time don't let me be diverted by anything of this world don't let me try to work my way into heaven but Lord let me just be focused on the right thing and let me be faithful and consistent to you Lord even when it looks like the Lord's gone and it looks hopeless let me be faithful anyway can I get an amen even though it looks like that's why the other disciples they're disappointed I'm going back to my career I'm going back to this but there was something about hers even though his body was dead I'm gonna stay faithful to him I'm gonna stay close to him even though tragedy has happened in my life I'm gonna stay consistent with the Lord I'm gonna can you say my I'm gonna stay coming to church I'm gonna stay close to him even though I might not feel him right now I'm gonna stay close to him because when Jesus body was dead he couldn't touch her like he used to he couldn't lay his hands on her like like he used to it was a lifeless body but nevertheless something in her said listen he raised me up one day there was something in him that raised me out of my dirty life it raised me something Raised Me Up there's something about this man and even though he's dead I know there's resurrection power in that I want to stay close to the right thing like she did can you say Amen because if it could raise and raise her life out of sin that he could do more so the least of the followers of Jesus got written in the story of the Resurrection the least of the followers of Jesus got written in the story of the Resurrection I'll tell you don't let my name be in anything else except for let it be in the closing hours at Resurrection time let my name be attached to that and let me be in that Resurrection my name don't have to be in lights they're not anyway but my name don't have to go I don't care I don't have to be invited to another convention I'm perfectly happy just to preach the gospel here to my own people this morning and serve the Lord I am so happy to be here and just feeling this presence with you I don't need my name out I don't even know I just want my name attached to the Lord I want to be close to him so it's it's it's she was chosen the least of the followers how many of you kids or how many of you adults experience uh when the team got chosen brother Tom was just talking about this the other day when the team is lined up there and all the people are lined up and you're going to choose him it's kind of the worst way to do it to choose him out because somebody always ends up the last one and you can't help but judge there's a reason that they were chosen last they just don't have what it takes they don't have the talent so how many would say I'm one of those because I'm raising my hand right away I was the young redhead that was chosen last most the time so there's three or four of us come on be honest now and there's nothing worse than that feeling is that that that coach or that person goes through I'll take you and then the other team says I'll take you and I'll choose you I'll choose you and it's just going down and you're looking around going and it's becoming more lonely all the time and all of a sudden you're the last one there and you're you're chosen you are chosen but you're the last one chosen it's not fun but it's terrible but but the surprise in God's choosing is he picks the least first in God's kingdom he and I can show you other examples in scripture he he seems to choose the least uh the the least that would have the credibility for it or that would have the background for it or that would have what what they need for it that's when you're playing baseball or volleyball these different things you're being judged about your talent and so you're the last one to get chosen because you don't have what it takes like the other ones have and the coaches are choosing based upon I got to get this done so I'm choosing the very best of the best based on that but when we come into the kingdom of God then God looks at character God looks at what he needs God looks at somebody teachable and you can take somebody you don't have a clue about volleyball and you can start teaching them all of a sudden within a few months they can Excel everybody else in volleyball and surprise everybody but in the Kingdom he chooses even even though you would think think like you're the worst player even though you would think like you're the worst Christian the thing about it is is that this coach he sees your potential he sees what you will become and so we find this in other places in the Bible um related to the end time and I'm going to reference a couple of them today related to the end times related to the last closing hours we see very other examples where of God's choosing and also we see the least of the Brethren that's kind of my theme this morning finding him and the least of the brethren we find that at the end there's a choosing there's a there's a choosing the least of the brother of God emphasizing that and we find other places related to the end and so one of the one of them I'll reference right now and that's the parable of the wedding invitation given by the King Jesus talks about there was a king he sent out invitations to a wedding feast and so we we find that the who was chosen first as the normal people to be chosen the normal ones that get would get an invitation to this wedding and this wedding feast and so he sends out the invitation it's how Jesus said there was invitations that went out to the normal people and all of a sudden the normal people begin to make excuses it says I I too busy I can't come I've got this to do and I've got that to do and an invitation has come to this great way and it's a great privilege and honor to be invited to this king's Feast but and it used to be an honor to some of these people it used to be an honor to be invited to this King this is pretty important and so it used to be top priority but something happened in their lives that it's not a priority anymore I can take it or leave it it's at the bottom of the list now because their lives have become busy their life had become so busy where the invitation to the king's Feast was not quite as at the top of the priority as it used to be so the Bible says they all with one Accord begin to make excuses I have bought a piece of land I need to go view that I need to look at the closing papers I need to view that I just I can't make it I can't come I've got this another one says I've purchased a cow a big cow and I'm that's gonna bring beef for my family and it's going to be great for me and I've got to go and I've got that appointment set at that date so I'm not going to be able to make that invitation and they made an excuse of that and this is the subject now is is your life Worthy is your life deserving of the invitation is your life responding that's worthy of the imitation you're getting the third one made an excuse I have married a wife and he's really the only one that had an inch of a value to his excuse just kidding so you can see those three things kind of cover all the stuff that we can be distracted by a wife the busyness of getting the cow the business the purchase of a piece of land but in all that is perfectly fine okay but when it makes you turn down the invitation that's another story these parables are for the end time because why we're headed to a marriage feast he invites you to a feast a wedding feast and so now we've come to the word the full opening of the word he's invited you to a feast he's invited you to the full word and then there's a marriage supper of the Lamb this every time I preach I'm giving an invitation to you to come to this wedding feast every time I preach and it's a calling to you can you say Amen every time we meet together every time God you get in the word of God God is calling you he's inviting you can you say amen and so then what we have happened I've got to move along this story I've got a lot of hay on my fort today but you see now what happened is that the king said if they won't come he says I want you to go out I want you to get the lame the hall the sick all the ones out there that you can find and I want you to invite them those people to the wedding Feast because the rest of them wouldn't come so I want you to go out and get others that surprise surprise they wouldn't normally be invited to the feast but the king says I'm going to invite them because of the excuses of other people he said now I want you to go out into the highways into the byways I just want you to go out and make the invitation to them so a servants they go out and at least the least expected to be invited now God at the end time starts to call them because a bunch of others turned it down many every service you're being invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb some feel they don't need it that they're different they're under a different category all this is fine Brother Paul but I'm under different rules I don't need to RSVP to this oh yes you do so they made excuses and God begins to fill it it still was not enough so God says I want you to call and I want you to call and and all the the other people that rejected him all of a sudden these others from the highways and byways begin to come a reference another scripture of first Samuel 22 and verse 2 and these are the people in David's rejection who's a type of Christ in David's rejection as a king when all the normal people the normal Israel rejected him as king then this is what it says about the people that gather around him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves together unto David and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men First Corinthians 1 26 says for you see your calling Brethren how that many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh I'm going back to verse 27 but God hath chosen the foolish things in verse 26 for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh so in other words in our view of who should be called it's different than what God would choose not you said not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called and then you jump to the end verse 28 base things of the world things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring in not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence there there is a a word of the Lord I believe for you today to realize that at the end at the end no flesh no talents no gifts no position will glory or take any Glory away from him he will choose based upon who he chooses and it will bring Glory only to him but who he chooses is a surprise to us sometimes it'll be by Revelation that they catch the parable the disciples ask him one day and says why do you speak in Parables and he gave the reason he says because I speak in Parables on some things because it is given to you to know the Mysteries so it's given to a certain group to catch it by Revelation so he doesn't throw it out there real plane he throws it in a parable because it can't come by just intellectual learning especially this mystery it cannot it will not come by intellectual so those are beating yourself up I don't have another knowledge of the scripture I'm not getting enough keep feeding on it keep reading on it can you say Amen but don't you ever judge yourself by how much you have knowledge of this because especially this mystery will not be based upon some intellectual capacity that you have it will be a soul Revelation once God thinks Rapture and the bride connects with that thought it's a done deal oh my glory be to God it's not based upon theological learning how much you know the message don't stop studying the message don't stop studying your Bible because it's good to get those things in your mind that can drop to your heart but he hides it because this will not be something that will be how much intellect you get through it this will be something different so he he puts it in Parables it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom it's given but it's not given to some so that may be unfair to you but that's just the way it is because if God left it up to intellectual knowledge then anybody that was smarter than you could catch these things but it's not based upon intellect it's based upon Revelation and he's because if he didn't do that then a smarter person than you would make it in the Rapture before you you might not even make it it was based upon intellect as I've said if it was based upon who was smart probably not a lot of you would make it in the Rapture it was based upon those who are good looking I wouldn't even make it and you that are laughing wouldn't have made it either thank God this isn't based upon what clothes I wear or how beautiful I look or how much intellect I have or how disciplined into my life thank God this is not based upon how disciplined in I am in my Christian walk thank God it's not based upon that thank God I find one of the most confusing things that Satan still confusing people over is the new birth and the Holy Ghost I I want people to be able to understand because Satan does his job to confuse people about it God is not the author of confusion that there's such even till today such different Slants on the new birth and what the Holy Ghost is and the evidence sometimes people preachers will preach and if you do this then you'll then you have the Holy Ghost and it becomes a sanctification thing and we need to preach the balanced word of God for the people's sake for the young people's sake how many want to know what the Holy Ghost is how many want the holy ghost in your life without a shadow of a doubt God bless you God bless you I mean you pray you'd say Lord and you got evidences of you in your life praise the Lord say God and then you that have it say I want more of it see the thing is friends God doesn't just make it confusing to us that we're always in this I'm lacking I'm lacking I'm lacking no it's just whatever we do like just keep going before God and say Lord whatever I lack fill me with it if it is the holy spirit fill me with it let me be obedient to you make me ready Lord we're living in a time that people are coming and there's there's situations people share with me that I'm overwhelmed sometimes to the the the damage that Satan has done to the emotions and the people's lives there isn't anybody even sitting here that's had a perfect background had a perfect family spoke on betrayal there isn't anybody that hasn't been betrayed by somebody you will be betrayed but it's not about that it's about what you're going to do with it but we're having broken people come to us and guess what I'm one of them you're one of them and the quicker we can quit judging people on the other side and say I'm coming broken they're coming broken the quicker we can see what our calling is these people are coming naked and destitute and bound by addictions and bound by things and under depression can't beat somebody up from that but I can tell you this I can tell you this if that's who's coming if that's the last group there's a there's a there's a bride who has eternal life she has the answer and there isn't any addiction there isn't anything that you went through in your past or present there is anything plague in your mind that is too big for the message that I'm preaching and the power of God that's available there isn't anything too big for it to do we need to let God do what he wants to do and not pull it our way just let God do what he wants to do let him do his work and that might be a very exuberant emotional service but it might be just a quiet service when God dropped some real solid bombs on the enemy can you say man and some Revelations Into the Heart of the people that overcoming power is going to make them stand their sons and doctors of God don't ever stop entering into worship remember the Bible says the sacrifice of praise so you need to come and bring the sacred it's the sacrifice work out all that tiredness and work out all that thing all the week has been a rough week you come and the song leaders gotta come you know he's singing and pulling sometimes he shouldn't have to do that you should say this is my time to Worship the Lord and you should enter in sometimes you shout sometimes a person just sits and cries sometimes they just Ponder don't look to the next person and try to copy the next person just yield to the Lord and worship him we don't have to work anything up because eternal life is working through the word of God and the new birth of the people and he can come and deliver somebody in a moment's time without any emotion involved I'll say this too that we must be careful how we misdirect our young people sometimes because someone who's crying for God might think that if I get it I have to get it like that person over there that's just screaming and shouting they may be getting the genuine thing but you should never feel like I have to do that in order to get something real we have to be so careful of that because he got sincere Hearts looking for God and crying for God thank
