========================================
hey man you made me sit there for a little while I'm so um excited to be here and also nervous because you know it's not a place to play amen I'm coming behind this place you have to be careful come with the right spirit you know to talk to the people because it's our God's people and you know God don't play you got to play with the people don't go yet I have something to say so good include his people God is very jealous of his people and God improved his servants too amen and on both sides we've got to be careful I would take it we react to each other and the words we say to our to each other is powerful if you remember Moses and the children of Israel remember Moses at the poem was mad I filled with rat and it's a smooth Rock and God said because she did that to my children even though it was God's child God said you make it the other side and that's another point where the children were you know mad against Moses too and God told him you know a new generation so it's just shows clearly how God don't play with other servants children so we have to be careful you know what we say to them and we have hurt them the kind of thoughts we have toward them because God will not spare us being children of ease and Spirits either amen but it's just a pleasure to be here this month before I um go here this morning I have this song if Sister Gina can bring it up you're my refuge You're My Sanctuary when I feel afraid amen I just uh I love the way Gideon sings it it's not here this morning bless his heart but you know it's just uh one day I was you know just going around driving around and then my son came to me and I was just thinking you know about that song and I can remember all the words so he didn't send me the words that's a few couple weeks ago and then the words really minister to mind so I hope it blesses this morning if we can go into work [Music] I have found a place a high can call on my own hearing your embrace will your mercy your birth loves us it's here that all my doubts and tears just melt away I Lay My burdens down I salute upon your face You Are My Sanctuary when I feel afraid you're my Hiding Place you are my refuge and when the storm is Raging pondering it your wings I rejoice and sing you are my refuge a higher found a place I can call my own the hill in your embrace will your mercy overflows it's here at all right now disappears just mouths away Lord I lay my birth is down I gotta look upon your face you are my refuge You Were My Sanctuary when I feel afraid you're my Hiding Place you are my right feet and when the storm is Raging underneath your wings a higher Rejoice I'm gonna sing it now you are my refuse You Are My Sanctuary when I feel afraid you're my Hiding Place and when the storm is Raging underneath your wings I rejoice and say you're my referee and praise the lord it's our refuge this morning hey man I don't whatever you're going through he's a refuge the only place you got run to amen that's how I run for safety amen there's no safety anywhere else but in Christ take my praise the Lord God bless you musicians thank you so much you may be you've been standing on your feet that's a really good word this morning let's spare one more time lord Jesus we we're here to look through your word Lord Jesus not just to look but to see what you have and stuff first you're the only one that has the power to unreville the Ministries were in this book lord Jesus so we can read through it and we can summarize it and you know just sit in our own ways we will think best but if you don't give a revelation in this word Lord we just blame Lord please help us to stay Lord don't mind see this word receive it have a revelation of it and leave it Lord Jesus we pray bless your children help them to be able to receive this morning father I pray in Jesus name amen Matthew Matthew 7 The Book of Matthew chapter 7. verse 24 if you're there with me to put Matthew 7 verse 24. said therefore whosoever hear these words this sayings of mine and doeth them I would liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the flaws came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not before it was fun and upon a rock and everyone that here these scenes of mine and do it them not shall be liking unto a foolish man which built this house upon the sand and never understand it and the floors came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and listen to this great was the fall of it verse 28 and it came to pass when Jesus had ended this Saints the people were astonished at his Doctrine hey man you may be said it everybody psalm 11. psalm 11. because Psalms 11. verse 3. I need three thousands to say the foundations to be destroyed what can the righteous do I read it again if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do may the Lord bless everyone of his word this morning in the name of Jesus Christ uh this morning um I wanted to help me first this morning amen don't be quiet on me um every minute to ask the gift of God but if you don't pull that gift it will not bless you amen they have what it takes to feed the people of God but it's now the people that preach because they pulled a gift and it naturally comes out of that Minister and reaches out to you safe don't pull I can't do nothing I'm just going to be talking and talking to help me purchase more than amen uh Pastor is out this morning and just keeping my prayers on this journey back um appreciate um is um confidence in me to come to pretty word this morning and also um I appreciate all the ministers that prayer me this morning I'm just too long give me strength we need each other amen him and also I want to um say happy birthday to adasa my daughter yeah yesterday was her birthday um brother Jared is telling me back in the back he said it's so funny that you know the ones that have the birth in general are the ones that have a very small birthday you don't really can't do it so much because all the money is gone are the gifts about in December you know at that Phoebe's birthday was a little bit a little bit you know jolly and then I just I was like Daddy can I have a big birthday girl we cannot and she will never understand I said we'll do something later but right now we cannot so we just did a little thin living room but I really wish yeah all right God bless you girl that's my that's my my firstborn the beginning of my strength amen I think for our life and we'll get us done in our life and sometimes she encourages me my daughter a little child she don't understand but she hears in the church and she just tells me what she hears and I really really appreciate that I'm thankful for my wife also and Phoebe too you know for being there for me supporting me and all I do I won't be here or I won't be women I am right now if this that that accrue right that didn't support me so I really appreciate them and every man every woman that has a family the reason why you're where you are right now because your spouse and your children supports you and they give you strength if everybody leave you they'll come there with you and they will you know even when you're in your low even when you you have your mistakes they're there for you because then they they believe in you no matter where you are where you become amen so that's why we don't it's very important to hold on to your family I believe in family so much amen I'm about to the scriptures this morning I want to take our time it's 11 trying to make sure I sell my time so I don't preacher like I'm pretty in Africa 11 39 okay all right in Africa last time my wife would tell me the last time I went to Africa it was really so uh fun and then the people who put on the preacher that was preaching and they preached for three hours and they didn't stand up they didn't go nowhere they were just I don't know how to do it but so you know they they really pull on the gift if you go to Africa Africa as a Preacher Man be ready to preach amen so but here in America we're very time conscious and I believe in that because you know basically you want to get attention to people they might start preaching and then they're tired and they want to go then nothing is going anymore so if it's 30 minutes slowly 30 minutes I never listen and they take that home that's enough for me hey man so Roberta Brown to keep me just let me know if I'm going behind up behind our schedule all right Matthew 7 24 and it says uh if we want to go through that again instead where therefore whatsoever hear these things of mine do it then I would liken them unto a wise man not the word wise which built his house no the word house upon Iraq not the word Rock Amen and the rain descended and the flaws came and the winds blew and beat upon their house and it fell not for it to responded upon a rock not the world found it no the word Rock verse 26 and every and every other and every other one that hear the same the same words I say unto you and do not do them like unto the foolishment so this comparison of two people two different set of men here people the one that heard God's word and did it and the one that heard it and not liking unto a foolish man it's built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the Lords came note the rain note the floods know the winds and the winds blew and beat up on that house and they fell and grit was the fall of it amen and you know these words Wise House work a very important words to me verse 25 and seven rain floods and wind I'm gonna get to them in a minute and they said the greatest fall of that that house that was built on the sound but note in verse 28 the Santa came to pass when Jesus had entered this saying the people were surprised at his Doctrine surprised that he's teaching like this is different excuse me this is different this is not the same thing we hear from Pharisees because the Pharisees and those they were always preaching Holiness for them and the fake Holiness where you fast and everyone knows you're fasting like the Muslims when they're fasting you can tell they say oh this fast is getting a hold of me and that was kind of teaching that they were used to the teaching that condemns and very legalistic and just condemns the people and make themselves good people and the other people the people bad people and even when they had their own faults that they were sinners in the secret that's kind of teaching that they had but this teaching was hard for them so they were they were you know very confident at his Doctrine and basically that was the foundation of their own belief amen it's very important if Financial demand is very important so this morning I'm going to speak on this on solid foundation development and growth of a believer solid foundation development and growth of a Believer if you notice here there are two foundations in the scriptures and both of them had a bit into a house so on top of this foundations was a house built amen I was trying to understand what the word about foundation and so I went to my favorite dictionary about the premises a lot and I founded that I feel like some of the the editors were Christians and so if we go in there it kind of TAPS scriptures with the meaning of words in English and that's the the Webster dictionary 1828 I love using it because I you know the the the mean is very different from all the modern meaning today so and it also goes back to the Ruth I like going to the rules of War so I found the word foundation in there and he said against somebody the root word foundation in Latin which means to lay bottom it means the base of an edifice edifice is a beautiful structure amen that part of the building which lies on the ground the supports a supported usually a wall of stone which supports the edifice the Cornerstone says also the groundwork on which anything stands and by which it is supported I like that I like this ottoman they say it's also called also called a settlement a settled base I like that it's also said it's also referred to as an establishment sometimes established set place fashion fashion according to certain standards so you can't just make any foundation Foundation has to be to certain standard standards of the engineer as a certain standard if it's uh like in geology at the geology college so I know a little bit in geology the certain places can put certain things certain materials because of the weight um of the way though the mass of the the soil structure you know or the area of the terrain if the basement complex where it's Rocky or where sedimentary rain we have just Sands you have to be careful the engineer determines what kind of structure is there so there's a certain standard that which by which would be the foundation another interesting part about Foundation is that it has to be paid for somebody has to pay for it now and I mean pay for it or something like in cash that's an effort that has to be made towards it and I call that effort sacrifice so someone has to work day and night making measurements measure you know think about how much material is needed to get that Foundation done so note that word sacrifice and that's that's really deep to me that Foundation cannot be made without an effort amen Foundation signifies preparation Foundation means I'm ready to build Foundation shows that I'm ready to progress to the next stage amen and you know foundational associate very funny thing in um in an engineering geology and also in for those who are Engineers but they're Josiah is here and other Engineers they know what I'm talking about the foundation of structure is the base level of the building and it serves two functions one to keep keep moisture and groundwater or seepage out of the structure that means to keep anything that's not supposed to be there to even distribute the weight among the load-bearing walls Amen to keep the balance amen I like that you know the word foundation is very very um common word in every part of our lives in our careers at the world Foundation you um want to do a career you have to you know do certain things you have to you know go to uh kindergarten or if you have to pre-k it depends on how you start and after that you could you finish uh Pre-K then you go to elementary school after elementary school you go to middle school middle school to High School in the British that's an American um uh American setup but in the British setup it's different because it's from from um Nursery which is the cricket to primary the primary is from grade one to six and that's what I did I'm from grade seven to ten you know seven to nine is this junior secondary school which is like our middle school and then from 10 to 12 is the uh what do you call it the uh uh senior secondary school and with that happening what you're planning for are you planning to go further now in America you have to do your you pass your diploma pass exams and whatever you do and then uh interpret to people to have a diploma in the British system you have to have your senior secondary certificate which is an example you pass it state of national exam that you have to pass and those those um certificates on both sides American and British have on purpose the purpose is you're building a foundation to where you're attitude when I was in um I think ninth grade I had to do an exam if I was going to science or heart class or a commercial class and if you have good grades in physics chemistry biology then you English and maths and you go to science if you don't really have good grades in them I have good grades in literature and some other history and all that I send it to heart glass and if you can't pass accountant and some other courses into you know commercial class so it's a basis the foundation that everybody you know you're building to get your career now After High School some people decided to go to college and have an associate degree or have a bachelor's degree some decided no I want to go to it you know get a skill it's a skill set and go to trade school so both of both of those said the people who have a foundation to get somewhere so in life generally cannot do almost anything without having a base is a foundation and even before you get to the college or even on having a trade school there are prerequisite that it has for if you don't have them you have to do them again in college and pass I remember you know I had to I did some courses in college I didn't I didn't do in my secondary school and I had to pass them for me to progress and that's just the life for you there's Financial and relationships especially marriage to be married you know there's a whole lot that comes to you know being married there's a spiritual preparation as Believers now I'm talking as Believers right now because I'm out in the world they have their own set of rules which we don't agree with and we're kind of mix with them because the Bible said do not become do not be conformed to the world but we're transformed by the renewable mind so we can't look at things the way the world look at it because we are believers and we have a basis a foundation and we have a goal that we look forward to amen so as a Believer this Foundation of you trying to have a spiritual be rich and first you have to be saved because if a man is not saved and he goes get married this problem if a man is saved then the lady is not saved this problem so if you're a young lady a young brother looking forward to get married or have a spouse and future or have a family make sure you get old ghost first that's that's Paramount because the Holy Ghost is going to suppress every adamic nature and that man or that woman if you marry a man that's not saved and those in the church and you're not sure he has all the girls then you're in trouble is going to be pretending the church he can do everything in church but you're going to be his last victim at home nobody will see what it's doing but it's going to do it to you and you'll suffer so when the pastor is trying to talk to you and say don't marry this boy or don't mind this girl because I don't see any fruit of it listen to the pastor because when you stop facing the problem it's you it won't be there it's just you and her there's a case in Nigeria one time it's not a message case but like you know this Christians are believers out there and then this man has been in church and he was one of the active you know man in church was doing good doing very wonderful and he was not playing instrumental doing everything and he found his sister sister also was five and she was honest she was very you know a good Christian and then she liked the brother the Brother Talks really liked her and then he got married and then my if you see my dad asking that story he would tell you that same story so basically they got married and after they got married I think the 9th of the night the end of the night and then you know she was just say honey let's pray you know like a Believer let's pray thank you for the day and everything I said I ain't praying what are you talking about say you're not gonna pray I don't know I know you believe in whatever no God and they said I'm not going to pray and on there is uh the bed he pulled pulled a pack out it's back up beers why you cut butterlight here in America you know and put it on I said hey you get one I get one if they want it that's fine so what it did was it tricked that woman to it she did not even determine to know that this man was not saved because you can't you can't check your man by face value you can take a Woman by face value they can look beautiful and these look handsome it goes more than that marriage you know ghostman and that if you're really gonna lay that foundation for marriage it goes more than just the face value you have to be able to discern by the spirit of God I'll tell you something if God gives the Holy Spirit it gives the ability to be able to discern everybody sometimes I meet people I don't understand why certain things just it's not clear to me and I tell my wife I was like don't judge people you know we just made them I'm like I feel this way this way about it I don't know them and later I'm gonna find out that what I was thinking was exactly what happened sometimes I tried to like oh that's my first impression I'm just I don't live on the side but I suffer for it when I start getting relationship with that person over time so every child of God that has that goes as the ability to discern anybody come around you amen there's the emotional emotional um maturity before you get married you don't want to be a dad in the house and be quiet baby and why something happened you're the one crying or there's a spider in the house it went jumping on the bed jumping on the chair and your wife is going chasing the spider you want to make sure that you're a man in the house because you know well I'm Excuse me but in Americans where I see men jumping with spiders or or lizard or whatever that runs around but if you want to be a room in the house you can't be jumping on your wife jumping at the same time it's just the emotional part of being a man amen not the kind of man today were sissified I'm talking about every man now excuse me I said man you have to be a financial stable to take care of a family don't marry a man who doesn't have a job you said brother Mike when you move to America you don't have a job I ain't got married I had a job in Nigeria before I moved here I was searching for a job where I plan the wedding after I got married a few months I got a job so I was working to get a job I know I'm just I'm just being honest here so but I did not married that woman I would aim that you know what I just lazy around she can make all the money I've heard people say it in my job but you know what I just work my wife makes all the money she makes six figures I just need to make a little bit that's not what a man should be a man should be the one that killed the woman and she decided to work around and make us extra money it's fine that money says hers the money that you make as demand is for the family amen so you got to prepare for your financial stability you know how to manage bills how to you know not just blow up your credit card how to make sure that you must cater for address is cater for sisters foreign marriage but at least have something to take care of her even if you have a one bedroom house it's fine as long as she believes in you if you slowly walk together you build up to a position I didn't start here today I started from somewhere Ground Zero amen you have to psychologically prepared you know there's so many things that comes in marriage you know that you have to be you know psychology prepared about so that's just you know for for marriage also it is foundations for a home planning like having a family you know having a family I have to plan for your spouse that you can have a spouse you have to plan for kids if you want to have kids and they have to you know plan to be very tolerant video tolerance because let me tell you the one on one person that will give you mad more than anybody to see your spouse I'm telling you they will they will make you mad but an end because they know you very well and then because you are so used to each other they will make you mad there's nothing spiritual about that so you got to be prepared for that to be able to handle whatever comes from your spouse and that's the foundation I mean it's not a fly it's beautiful let me let me not lie to you Mario it's beautiful I will I would never want to be single but basically it's it is effort work but all the foundation that you had in your single Hood learning from your parents land for people around you the preachers and everything builds you to a point where you're ready to face life with our spouse so nowadays it's like oh I can't do it no more I'm out that's the worst standard in the house of God there's no divorce if you can't do it no more you stay there that's what we're believing if you didn't do it no more you go on your knees and pray you chose that woman it shows that man it's time to start working with them amen that's what that's what I I believe in so marriage and and you know Jesus was saying and when they went to him about just wanted to tempt him and ask him oh about the law of divorce and everything and Jesus said Moses gave you their writing because of your stubborn head yeah but in in the beginning it wasn't so God made Man In His Image and gave him a woman God created The Institute of Marriage and it made it so beautiful that the men and men worked together and the man would be the head receiving from God and supported on his wife now being the wife being submissive to her husband doesn't mean that she's a maid or inferior no she has everybody in the team has a position if these sisters will understand that even your position as you submitted your husband you have a better blessing that's what the scriptures say in supporting that man and submitting your will to him not because you're stupid but because you won't go to bless you when you support when you when you when you when you submit your will to your husband and say Lord please teach my husband whatever he says I follow there's a blessing that comes with it maybe someday I'll speak about the sermon that God gave me about authorities and blessings amen so you know that's about that I'll go for it so I don't waste our time is 11 57. so foundations are important in everything they're doing in life but this morning I'm not talking about I'm not really talking about I'm not really focusing on all the foundations I'm trying to focus on the spiritual Foundation Foundation is important as a believer I have some emergency I got to read this out Foundation is important as a believer foundations determine our life you know direction of our life it determines our spiritual growth whether it's going to be increasing or decreasing amen and you know if I start a little bit here but Brown was talking about you know how a child no after a child is born the first teacher is a child has is the mother the mother is the first teacher you know an Irish child and teaching my feet and she's about to walk teach them how to eat using a spoon and Cutlery and all that all that the dad also do but the mother is one always with a child though that is always no most times I'm going to work and thinking of things and come back maybe the moments mothers and a month and release but the mother is the first first uh teacher the child has but when a child is born remember that child I was born with an endemic nature that nature don't change that nature it is not it's not made up it's just in the gene of that child because it was born like that why do we have a diamond nature when man fail all that came in man the man fell from the garden that nature came a man so when the man is born you don't teach a child how to lie he didn't teach us how to steal from the poor that's the key that I remember I still feel important I get some good spanking my mother didn't play with that are you trying to snake in the kitchen and then you you know in Nigeria you have little straws that goes to the key to the door's kitchen and you walk to the stores yeah who's there and then you can't say nothing because you haven't met in your mouth trying to escape you know so nobody teach a child out to do that it is a nature on that child to do those things those another things that I catch him doing sometimes say you're disappointed until that try to save that child was too exhibit that Adam in nature amen but notice that child is under two religion instruction of his parents or Guardian at that point Library Brown said I mean but the Paul was saying he said that you are the Holy Ghost of that child until that child saved amen now that y'all started learning everything around him so fast and you'll be shocked how fast this generation wears almost like they learn everything it's like it's magnetic just speak it up everything that you said something even some some nuances that you use in the house and words vocabulary they pick it up very fast because they learn I mean guess what those things are from the foundations in your life slowly because you don't know about it's Beauty it's beautiful it's like building bricks slowly slowly they get in there that's why it's very important at home that a child is given a Godly example we can't be all Godly in the church and everything but your child knows you better your spouse know whether you see it or not the father and the mother had like always goes to guide our child and if they don't they'll give account Romans 14 12. you're going to give account man will give account of everything everyone will give a kind of himself to God if what God has given them so that's why we have to very you know careful what we're doing in front of those kids how we treat them the words associated them have to very careful now after that after the child is now a little bit matured and is able to go to school you send him to school I want to send them to school you have another teacher with whatever teacher they have in school but even while they are still in school you're still guiding them the spirits are still in position of guiding and guarding this young energetic energetic fellas like the Bible says Trend that child in the admonition of God very very important and I love Ephesians 6 if you want to read that with me Ephesians 6. 6 for I love to read I read that and I read the Amplified version I like the way the employee version really places so children will be your parents and Lord for this is right under their father and mother which is the first commandment with the promise that may be well with thee and thou mayest live longer on the Earth and ye fathers provoking other children to rot but bring them up and nurture and what can I hear that admonition of the Lord I'm gonna read it right here the Amplified version in the city really really beautiful and I want to read that it says children to obey your parents and the Lord that is accept their guidance and discipline as Representatives as Esurance if that means you're you're presenting God I see you're nurturing your child for this is right that is for obedience this is right for to teach wisdom and self-discipline verse 2 honor esteem values precious your father and that goes to young people who were still with their parents today especially if you have Godly Parents you got to listen to them if you're married fine you can take care of yourself lady a young lady young man but when she only appearance is very important they extend to unvalue them and be respectful respect to the thing that's lost in in the um in our environment today even you go to work and I work with a lot of young people who are very young and then there's no respect no way and I've ever seen cases of where you have a father and a son you know it's just very respectful and now if a young man or young man can respect their parents how much more would they disrespect on an outsider they will they will say everything to your face they will cost you out whatever because there's no respect I don't care how much your parents say something to you and you don't feel good about it or maybe you feel you were you know a business with there's no right for you to go back and respond to them I really suspect them because you regret it respect your parents remember you're someone to see it and one day you'd be a parent and you get the same thing that is your parents and you remember so this is the fourth Commandment we promise sometimes I need to get a sermon in authorities and the blessings that come at 30s and the curses that come authorities verse 3 says so that he may be well with you so he wants to succeed and lie I want to first to respect your parents and that's why I see what our generation of generation after me are an early successful successful what they're doing and everything they've been doing I mean they're live at school they've just been they're struggling it's like a big gap between generation that's performing and the one behind me that's a big gap I mean they do great things and they're very successful whatever they're doing but the ones you know younger they just can't succeed because Muslim adverse disrespect for their parents and then it's God's words a principle it will never change it goes from generation to Generation The Gospel stays forever it said this is the this is that fourth Commandment with promise that it may be well with you and that you may have a long life on the Earth so even on longevity is also as a result of respect that's interesting verse 4 fathers do not provoke your children to anger do not exaggerate to the point of resentment with demands that a trivia are unreasonable or immediate and abusive nor by showing favoritism or indifference to any of them but bring them up listen tenderly with loving kindness talk about what our birth pastels preaching about love and discipline and instruction amen and when I was looking at the word bring them up in a nurture it means feed them nourish them that's parents now back to the parents nourish them promotes them to grow when you remember to give them food the amount again Raymond remember to buy them give them Christmas remember to you know send them to school and everything remember they got to feed them the word of God too I'm gonna teach them right because the way you're doing you're laying in foundation in your life before the Holy Spirit comes in feed them in the word of life amen I think we're making Pace here um than I expected so I think we'll be here out of here in time establish them in the truth because I'm gonna tell you the reason why I'm here today is because the man and a woman decide to establish me and the truth it's because the man that woman sacrifice to lay a grit Foundation because I won't be here today I'm telling you I've gone through a whole lot you might see me here calm and easy but I was a tougher too way back so but something that was down that this was laid outside of me a foundation that even before the Holy Ghost came and you know I had that fear of my parents a lot of people to see me do this one I don't know what they do what they do and God put that in in me so that you know everyone although the Spirit came I was able to just grow from that Foundation I was able to you know be some of the foundation amen and you know that's why parents should not hold back don't hold back when your sense in them go lead thing lurking around don't hold back in America today is so clear that even the government don't want to you know reprimand the child no more they don't want you to you know talk to them they give them they had their own rights oh they have their own rights to be able to be gay they have their own right to be able to be lesbian they didn't even know what who they are and then we're having schools today we have schools you know bringing out books for them to read that those kids don't want to stand who they are he doesn't even know whether he said grown man is it my short man it's not or mature woman they're not even there yet it's a prayer parents need to be in a very very you know careful run watching jealous over there over their their children because this word is ready to snag those kids from you and then let me tell you something the word they they shove their own standards on our face look at the amount the the level of or the the percentage of the lgbtq in America it's not involved with 10 maybe 20 Max but they shove in our face they don't care what that water would stand for even on my job in UPS they have oh no a whole month no no dedicated to lgbtq on my share SharePoint uh screen every day I see that that in for that whole month they're trying to project everything and you know the government never is just trying to make oh don't don't don't don't make them mad don't make them mad don't just pamper them and then we'll hear Christians they're a larger percentage and we hide them what we stand for you cannot hide your standards brothers sisters you cannot hide the standards you got to show forth what you're made up of I'm not saying you should be disrespectful in any way don't be disrespectful if you have to work with someone that's a job is fine if you have a work people that don't believe in God it's fine I have people at my job like that but at the same time let them know what you stand for it's very important and let your children know what it stands for so that they don't get think that what they're saying because if you don't tell your children someone's gonna tell them amen would love correct them that they might not they might they might even though they don't get it now you're laying the foundation for them Proverbs 22 22 6. perfectly six I'm already quickly said train up a child no church not your upper child admonish up a child and the way he should go and when it's old he would not depart from it you put the furniture in their lives second Timothy 3 14. to 15 I like Apple told Timothy that second Timothy 3 um 3 14. 3 14 and said Paul's talking here about that post they see what was going to happen to you know the people you know being led away and you know doing different things natural without natural affection truth Breakers and false accuses incontinent and high-mended lovers of government and my love is a pleasure lovers of God and then he came down to verse uh verse 14 and said But continuing down with things that doubt us learn so Timothy was somebody taught Timothy even before I became a Minnesota if somebody was teaching him something he said continuing those things that you have learned and has been a short of so there's been a basis that's been a structured laid on the life of Timothy even before it got to this point and he's building on that amen and as as my short of knowing of whom thou has learned them from you've learned it from somebody somebody has to teach you something verse 15 is that from a child that has known the holy scriptures which are able now this Foundation is able to make you wise unto salvation through free which is in Christ Jesus now this Foundation laying on them if they are God's seed it will prepare them towards the saving Christ to drive them through it I don't care for the good let them go left and right up and down let them go back in the world because they have gone sit in them goes and bring them back to him if they're not God said we can't help but the rest is God's hands but do your part the reason why you're doing your part is that you want to make sure that you're not accountable for their blood I'm always telling me scriptures I thought sometimes there's this cure for me I remember sometimes in Ezekiel I'm not saying how you know that if you don't say the truth the blood will be upon you so if you're holding back and something they're supposed to do right and he said oh I just you know just let him be it's a new age you're gonna suffer for it then go then you give account for her like you know the Bible said something happened when I you know I've just been been playing here so excuse me for I'm being overly playing we came out of a service sometimes from certain place I want to mention and then we got home and then my daughter had a it's doing a little paint in the hand and my fingers I was like what are you doing and she's been a lot of nothing I saw her I saw a young young sister so I'm so opinion I I finger I was like okay so at that point I was like I told my wife what do I do I mean she's she was three or four I can't remember randomly said okay all right what's going on here so the only thing I could tell her was like you know we don't believe in pain in the fingers if God if God wanted you to have that blue finger it would give you a blue finger if God wanted to have more eyelashes it would give you more eyelashes you're going to have long nails getting here you like giving you that because I know that the Bible said God make made you you and you it made you you're fearfully and wonderfully made it spent time to shape you to a unique person that you are so why so I thought I told my daughter I said hey I mean I said we don't believe in this because the only woman that I know that painted our nails was Jesus upon the Bible I said over the bro but I'm like but the Bible didn't say we should spend our nails or not or fix our nails or not it didn't say that but what does it stand for what does it signify there's certain things that it don't make sense that there's no place in the Bible that the Bible says should do this and that but what a zika note what is it Association associated with because that woman that painted nails in the Bible and painting our lips and you know fix whatever she was doing with that she was disability to God and the suspected God's servant and God's promise and dogs at her up the little blood a man so I'm just laying a plan to you it's for you to desire so I told my daughter I said well don't believe in that I thought my wife I said my wife was telling you know I wouldn't believe in that and then I was then I was thinking this morning because I was up to like 6 30. I could gonna I couldn't sleep because I just started bringing stuff in my mind especially when I have to preach like that I don't really sleep through the night I sleep two hours I'm fine because I want to see I just want to go to tell me exactly what it has I don't want to just make up something so this morning I was now you know starting and then I remember the brand said when he went to hell he saw the same thing in hell of a woman pain in the face and all that and that you know I was like so if I sit up with that sister while you painting your fingers why are you fixing Nails it's up to you what's it what is it Associated what does it signify and then lately also I saw some Trends you know among our young sisters having anklets like on their on the on their toe under on their feet and I was worried about it I was judging anybody else worried about it I was like what's going on parents you gotta say something to your kids don't hold back if you know better let them know if doing any better it's fine but if you know better and you have to turn right because I know the generation of parents older than me about my age we had some good teaching you got to let this new generation know what we stand for so how's words I want to do a little research on what anklets are because it's big English I'm from Africa so I just you know sat down and did a little research I was reading through through different you know ministers International Spirit birming incident about it you know I was just I've written about so I saw an Isaiah where there it was mentioned there and Isaiah 3 you can go read it 3 16. and verse 16 and verse you know 18 Isaiah 3 16 16 to 18 and talked I talked about it twice and let's talk about Bengals on their feet so I was just you know reading through it and I did a research I found that in India there is um some marriages there the man gets a woman as you know so it's like I'm you're married to you and everything and I was like okay so what about the cultures and I found out here in America he meant a lot I was discussing my one of my employees the police at work I was telling and I said I said what do you think about no Atlas she was like oh so I wear them I said do you do you know what I did search this is what I found out I found that that ankles had a meaning to swingers this were much or that once I went I don't say more than that other meaning to the lgbtq you know you know group and it means certain things when it's you're wearing your left right over your you know pants or whatever you're wearing it it made it I said I mean I was like this is not godly and then I look at where the scripture talk about it it was talking about the daughter of Zion now that I left God out there were probably talked about Pride it talked about I wrote it somewhere because I tried it talked about arrogance talk about a few other things that was you know as I said with those women they would remember the daughters of God because Zion is is the city of God so we the other side is that us of God but they were off track and they said to you know react to God's word in Iron away and that's what that scriptures keep going we can't read it and I was like wow this is deep so sisters if you still wear your anklet it's okay but check the spirit that comes behind it and if you notice in this war today there's always a spirit that comes with passion Fashion's a big thing it's we're laying foundations here brothers and sisters so please excuse me fashion is a big thing a big Trend that the devil uses accounts to spit very strong Spirits so Believers have to bury watch outside Bible the Bible Bible said the the enemy comes to ask two two three things to do to still kill on Destroy says lock an hour like a land suit it's going to be divorce very smart I hope this question is nice let me tell you fashion is good I like dressing nice I like dressing good but when the spirit if you can discern it certain spirit that comes with certain dressing or accessories it's gonna mess up your spirit so if you want to wear anklets it's fine that's that's your choice but if you have those spirit in you it's something this is going to tell you what is that associated with the go to do so go online just type anklets what it means you just you know check it out but all I'm saying essence you know talking about all this you know pain and all that all I'm saying in essence that parents need to watch out for their kids and also admonish them in Love Don't shout on them don't yell on them sometimes they're very firm which is okay but let them know that you love them I want them to grow in the way of the Lord and you want their life to better because you want them to receive the Holy Ghost if you want them to only goes to go to prepare children to receive it prepare those kids to receive the holy ghosts if you don't do it don't get it tell them the truth it might be hard right now they might not understand it they'll get to understand later sisters let your dress in an accessory glorify God that's what that's all we're doing if my dressing at the point in time you might say oh okay I said brother I don't have any issues with that now I see Brothers in the message now it's the message right now they start growing it turn into I'm not I'm not saying should not take over here as a man too I mean I love when I put some real in my hair and letting it no look good even though I'm losing a little bit don't look at that so but you know I love looking good but I'm not saying you don't take care of your hair I mean if you have to put some like brother Brandon you know sometimes it just brush it's really shiny I know it's why I've lost that I love it dress now is that's the balance to it but when it gets a point where your dressing accessories and things doing is now you know affect and high glorify God I can't look at you and say there is God there's a problem and now in the ranks of the message you have brothers now turn their hair to Crazy Birds and it's going up a little bit now the next thing what they're doing they're not braiding it they're making a converse with it so it's a step it's you know what number error is this you're going you can't you don't go there right away it's just one step out and I step out even but the Browns have been correct it is coming you keep going keep going before you know you you're out there so when there's an error in your life or you send error in the life of your kids don't wait to correct correct you right away because every smile is quick is it's smart it's quick too late to accessories glorify God let's address and glorify God amen excuse me if I'm too if I'm too open this morning but I'm just being honest now of that child when that charged with the age of accountability you know and then they're grown they now have to have their own life then after their own you know you know their own uh what they call it their own uh uh their own foundations as I said Christian and Foundation is it's very very important very important as a child to have your own Foundation I mean as an adult having partnership because now that child is out of your then you know let them left from their right that there's a lot the the age of accountability maybe the 18 or whatever it didn't have they have to receive Christ themselves and you know basically spiritual foundation for that child is not important that that young man or that was a young woman is not very important where they have to grow to have a personal relationship with God amen I heard something I was trying to look for something I wrote that God just put on my heart I guess we're here now spiritual Foundation is a different thing basically because that's that's my aim today I don't know I think I'm gonna finish everything but at least I can I can you know finish I've just run through it and maybe another time go through it I'll be enjoying the service this morning can you say Amen if you enjoying it so this Foundation you know is very important you know when Jesus is talking in Matthew chapter 7 about personal spiritual Foundation now that parents have later foundership foundation for them as a non-oly ghost fifth person now they're growing now and they now see they need the need for them to be baptized to baptize now they said Foundation being laid amen solid foundation is important for every believer no matter the position that you're you're holding the church you might be the the uh this director he might be the musician it might be the an offering taker he might be the officer you might be the teacher you might be even every Pastor your soul needs a solid foundation in God's word and that's what you're just saying in Matthew 7 there was a foundation that you can build on remember we're talking about solid foundation development and growth of a believer you have to grow from being a child now Paul's saying that the babies drinking milk from there to go to be adults that eat bones Believers acting like a chicken have to get a realization of who God has made them to become Eagles manifesting themselves or a chicken and an eagle in a Chicken Barn who doesn't know who he is you know so spiritual Foundation is is important and our foundations go left and right just talk about that rock remember that rock what a rock signifies it signifies that I wrote it right here Iraq signifies Iraq signifies life through the Spirit by grace that's what Roxanne finds so we're staying out the house on that rock the foundation and they asked to build under the wind and the the rain came and the floors came and it was not moved spiritually a foundation in the spiritual you know in the spiritualism is way different from what we're talking about and a million times different because Christ is the foundation that we're talking about is a Chief Cornerstone is the architect is the bricklayer is the engineer he's one that does the framework is everything in the foundation of the foundation that we're talking about physically you know those foundations you know it's it's easy you know for part of a team to pull out and everything Chromebooks but in this Spanish I was talking about it is a strong Foundation that cries and self-build itself in this world I'll be in my church we choose what the Revelation which is Christ himself amen a soul needs to grow to adulthood and manifest Christ full fledge amen Proverbs 23 24 I love this scripture perfectly found really for coming open your scriptures with me verse 24. verse 24 I read it in King James I also read it in um in the other um uh version um Amplified I love that Amplified version sometimes the way it you know explains it 20 24 from 28 from three verse three to four that's what that's what I'm yeah so through wisdom notice through wisdom is and house beated not on by understanding it is established I remember talking about Foundation establishment and by a knowledge the Chamber of the field with all pressures and pleasant riches now here here what the Amplified you know said he said through wisdom James 3 15 to 7 talks about two types of wisdom remember this one that sensual early this devilish that's not from above there's another wisdom that's pure Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality than without no hypocrisy so look at two wisdom here through wisdom not the wisdom of the world but the wisdom of wisdom of God Godly wisdom a house in life a home a family is built and by understanding it is established on a sound and good foundation and by knowledge verse 4 by knowledge not the knowledge of the world but knowledge of how I can do it but my effort knowledge of the of the same word the word of God by Revelation it's rooms remember it's a foundation right enemy wisdom that has to build on the established Foundation wisdom of God and by knowledge now in that house their rooms the rooms are filled its rooms are filled with all precious he says of great price value worth and pleasant riches not silver the richest is talking about is not the origin of silver and gold oppositions so you've had account or a high earning job a big business but the riches of God is abundant fullness of wisdom is power The Riches of God is not what men think it is men think about it which is what I can you know what I can see he has a brand new car has like five cars in the yard he has a no big Garden another back yes it's nice this is a very good I mean they're missing him but they're very good the rich stuff guys now are women dresses or the kind of job he has it's kind of business The Riches of God are wisdom and power strength and power that gives us of mercy so that I will give Mercy to woman I have mercy on um Exodus 3 19 and also Grace because in my greatest option for you that's the riches of Christ remember you're filling that house up Ephesians 3 also said they're about the riches of Christ if you want to read that with me Ephesians 3 verse 16. you can't read that only if you want to buy them already real quickly right now before I go ahead amen if she has 3 16. so this is my house is filled with no ridges The Riches of God wisdom power mercy and Grace are you with me this morning every chance three I'm gonna read it quickly too three I'll start from uh verse 13. we're talking about the riches of Christ here now and said wherefore wherefore at that even know that my tribulations for you which is your glory for this course I bow my names unto father of our Lord Jesus Christ or from the old family in Heaven and Earth is named that it will grant you according to the riches of his glory remember which is of Glory to be strengthened and with might by Spirit the Inner Man so this house talking about as a foundation the foundation is very important as we're saying amen us have a spiritual Foundation he has to meet God Abram talked about meeting God at the back of the desert that's the foundation that has to be laid because if you don't have it we'll talk about the wind in a few minutes the winds will come flawed will come the Reigns will come and you know what you know what's going to happen after that that Foundation is solid now depends I've done that part a Believer I have to meet Christ himself and you know the foundation of of a Believer you know it's not just oh I just like this the nation say oh Lord I said to them that's my personal and savior and that's it you're safe nope it's women on that there are some process to it remember Peter Peter was a man that I've been with God all that's why it's in God face to face it slept with God and I went and stepping in the same room with God he ate in the same place but God he saw everything but you know what when the wind came he could not withstand it he ran back to his fishing trade why because he was there he was a child of God remember he was doing all he can do but there was no Foundation strong enough to build any spiritual house remember this Foundation that we're talking about this Foundation we're talking about the foundation on the rock with scratches it's one that needs a house to be built on it and that house Christ has to live in that house live in the house and and ship that house to what he sees remember he's a designer Peter just you know he was doing everything he wasn't even feeling even because our demons remember but there was no Foundation there was nothing solid that because we stand the test of time so now when a man has been you know saved you go to Christ you receive Christ in your life when a surprise in your life there's a step whereby it says to be baptized no in the name of Jesus saying that means when you say the word dependence is saying I'm going this way and all of a sudden you change direction angles and that's what the word repentance means so if you are saying I'm repent and then your life hasn't changed Direction and something hasn't happened yet there has to be a change a total change from who you are and I remember that what brown was saying about but Paul writing sometimes about that man who the light the the is Pastor or whatever they're telling me as demons he has issues excuse me and but Obama asked him when did you know didn't get changed when did you did you feel a change in your life now I said years ago I said I used to be this and then then I talked about the Battle system but after that one day I decided to just you know receive good and that's top right there and I'm newer change up in my life and Abraham said that moment when you felt that change and you couldn't do the things you're doing way back you're not doing those things normally those habitants said that there you go save and when a man received Christ the first thing you do you got to let go of your always you got to realize that you're going to let go of those ways repent and now follow the instructions of God so you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Acts 2 38 and now in the world right now you go in the word and I say oh you came up Jesus they're right and wrong I'll prove it to you they're wrong because they baptized in the name of father son only goes taken that's the name of God before Matthew Matthew um 28 I think 19 they was talking about going out in the world baptizing in the name singular not plural name of the father name of what the Sun and the Holy Holy spiritual insane this is the same name I'm talking about is the father is the Son and it's to the Holy Spirit so they missed it they're right it's to the name of Allah but there's a name attached to it but that man is the husband's his wife as a father says to our brother I saw the video that's a beautiful video right there I was so touched when I saw you walking down with her and he's uh sound to his father Italian father he has Italian jeans on him but he has a name if I don't call him by that name he will not answer me if I say father and walk to him he'll just this man is crazy I said Brandon I need money this is oh yes just call my name and that's exactly but that's what it is because God has a name that's attached to him that at that name every name must bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and King and when that name is mentioned even whispered do you hear me even when you whispered her name even in the depth of your heart without even saying now demons tremble because they say power to that name and that's why we're baptized it's not a name that's why we receive that name because it's not just a regular name that is God's name if you receive it you receive life amen so that's why we're baptized in that name we receive God as a foundation in our life you see God and you baptize the name of Jesus Christ you're saying and after you do that it's not about this is not changing it's the obedience or to that word so you've been Thy word and say you have baptize the name of Jesus Christ whatever sin I said Lord I believe and I don't do it and then our obedience brings you to the to receive to for your heart to be prepared now there's a foundation you know you're not ready to say Lord I'm ready this Foundation is ready for you to work on and guess what the Holy Spirit coming and Peter said that's him Peter we're talking about that was scared of people that's Saint Peter that I was scared of the Paris that was hiding now you know said do you know Jesus I don't know me I don't know that man same Peter and you just said you you would deny him interested me you know Peter was it was a very bold man it was full of himself he believed that I could do it by his own efforts she just oh no I deny I'll be with you but guess what when the wind came he couldn't he could only stand it so that Foundation what happened to him he said it said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remyama sin so that the gift of all the girls would come to you now when you receive that give a give up the Holy Ghost it's not only on to you you have the power to transmit that Holy Ghost in geology because we when we call something an aquifer if you ever heard of the word aquifer Hui fer there's aquifer there's aquitard there's Aqua glute and basically what those words mean in geologists in what what are engineering or geology what are geology it means that you can take fluid in and transmit it so now the aquifer is only settlement or basement or soil that can take any fluid that whatever fleets can be just keep taking it and transmit that same fluid clean water now it's not just any kind of water clean groundwater to give it to another person so when I receive the Holy Ghost when is that Foundation has settled and receive all it was in your life you have the power to transmit it because at that point but Paul was saying you're not just any kind you're not I'm not a Christ the little another one you're able to to give life to another person that's why the words of your mouth is very important what would you say because you are not a Christ on two feet you cannot just say any kind of word that's why James said him because James said the three I thought I remember but he was saying that this tongue is a powerful thing and now when you have the Holy Ghost whatever he say is going to happen like that just like that yesterday I was I need something to get thicker than things and I was thinking my mind I said you know Lord I know you provide for me I'll use this app I just spending this money I'll just cover and that's Lord if you just provide some money before the night falls I just believe that you would do it and then I didn't tell my wife what happened later somebody just sent us some money say hey here here it is for um it has a birthday and you guys have it so my wife saw me this morning I said you don't know where that money came from I said I was telling God yesterday I needed something to do I said this is what I said Lord before night for I want you to do something I want to take care of this and God provided that money for her she didn't know why but I said that's the money right there before nights of course I went to bed and then last night so send the money to me we are Christ and two feet he said if you believe in Christ that Greater Works that you do not just then he did how many I'm gonna I don't know how many I can't remember how many people Jesus verse on the dead but I say you do more so be careful yourself your actions because those things will manifest because you have really goes inside of you so that's foundation on that Foundation has been the Holy Ghost and everything I keep going and then now when you have the only girls we'll talk about the winds now the rain and the Florida and the wind's Gonna Come man that's why I was gonna come you can't hold it back it's inevitable that's why I'll come one way or the other if it comes even through someone that's very close to you God will use God can even use your wife to try you job was was an example you know they were compatible but she was so pushed the wall that God used his wife to ask in the curse God and die but guess what Joe Biden Foundation I tell you job acid added solid foundation that Foundation could not be shaken but it was not a man or some creative dogmas or some church services or some message you know affiliation it was based on Christ the word he said I know I believe and I'm persuaded he said this word said mother Mary did my leave I'm funner than him and Let's cross The Rock life Giver the wind will come Brothers sisters the wind will come and that's why you look in the message today you see people we will look up to as examples as good preachers and they just fall away yeah you wonder but Lord why I'm not I'm not I'm not judging them I'm just saying but Lord why if you go find the verse of it sometimes you find out that there was no foundation in there you know especially I grew up in the message I can tell you we can't talk message we can act messy we can dress message and you will not know we can you we need to stop doing that because it will not save you when the wind comes the wind will shake you and pull it off your roots because you you're just following it's good to follow it's fine I mean but there's more to it there's no power in all the dressing all the Talking message you know I'm telling you I message kids we for those of us who left we left the war we can left the war directly to the message we understand how the life is but we're in the message we don't really you know we ain't in church always even though we don't do it our parents make us do it but sometimes we don't really like honor God but let me tell Young Brother young sister you got to meet God one-on-one Lindsay and a few people here I think but then our God took me from alcoholism and it revealed himself to me the alcohol is not what a Christian should have because I like I said there's some things that they will not tell the Bible will not tell you don't do so don't do that but the Revelation that's how the foundation has to be established in you where it's you and God one of those days if you want to hear the full story I'll tell you if you want to meet 101 but one of those days I was high and I was in college I was maybe my second year and I'm gonna tell you this my dad doesn't even know about this I'm just telling you I'm sure it's here for the first time and man this is how every young man's life goes you think you know your child no you don't we can't really pretend that's why I got to pray that that child really really really have an into you know uh interaction or experience with God so that even when you're not there your mind is at rest I went to college and I was you know doing pretty well to my jealous and everything then I met some young man in the church there's so many churches I'll go there and you know this is no this is not nothing wrong with this and they just you know and they use scriptures to even tell you certain things I hope Paul told too much to drink drink little wine be careful when people come to you in the name of the scriptures and now I even in the message I'm telling even message sometimes I'm wearing candy I just said this people will believe that you can still drink that's what I'm saying oh the Bible didn't say do or don't do it but that what does what does it stand for us it's associated with you got to be careful so I got into it and now okay A little Finance part I never bought it any any drinking any alcohol my own money if you ask the people can you give me some money to hold I got if you say oh okay get some drink they'll buy it for a drink I slowly I got into it slowly I do I drink it though you know I was not crazy about just okay maybe a little bit five percent seven percent just slowly like I say error from error to air and one day I was I was hung up I had my uncle very few I've been there you know I'm talking about I lay down on my bed in the room I had those uh to pick a bed you know when I was calling to my dad you know God bless him he could provide everything I needed and I was laying there now and this is the same Bible I'm talking to you I bought a cover just to cover it up listen bye-bye I'm preaching out from open itself to progress 20. strong wine is a marker up with the message I know exactly what happens when this beneath those papers sleep I know I'm you know exactly what's going on guess what somebody taught me right I knew when those people asleep I'm not playing with that no more even though I was kind of what in there no I didn't have any issues with girls I didn't have an issue with you know smoking I didn't have no issues with that but you know what the winter come to try out and check you out and if you don't if you're not strong you're going to fall for it right so I just said hey I saw this website wait a minute what's that so I read it if you read that with me I can completely read it for you you know she can't see what I'm talking about quickly so you can not grasp my experience I think I'll accept some time proverbs 20. it says one is a strong mocker wine is a marker strong thing is original whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise so I thought I was oh okay okay look maybe just as a regular and then someone's say I said go to Proverbs 23 remember I read the Bible I grew up in church I was active in church but that part I had no settling with God every part of your life has to be settled with God or else when the wind come it's gonna shake you Every Beat every corner of your heart every Darkness ever whatever you're dealing with habits if that's what to sell through with God I thought I said every part of my heart and my life but guess what that part is not settled because I didn't I didn't have an understanding of Revelation of what it is but you know what God had a reason for me to go through that so that I can explain himself to me so now you can't tell me about alcohols brother I met with God that's what I can say you go to go to go to your experience so I went to Proverbs 23 I was like I didn't really get it 23 and I went to verse he said he said specifically used to convert 28 so I started from 28. so she also she's talking about a you know a bad woman and everything and talking to father that Father tell me something to listen and not go to the the horror there and he was saying for your horse a deep ditch and a stranger man is in therapy so she also lied and with us for a prayer and increases the transgressors among men now verse 9 listen to me you've been if you haven't been the world don't go try I'm telling you but don't try it it's better not try but also I've been known to know what I'm talking about who had War who had Sowers Who had contentions who are bablens who had wound to that cause who are the redness of our eyes so now the word god themselves now explained himself to me what I had just my my experience because whoever that's why someone that's drinking he said did I tiring at the wine you say I just think a little bit a little bit from a little bit two percent seven it goes don't even don't start to try it because you keep going did I go to me seek mixed wine and that was what I was doing look not die upon the wine when it's red you want to give it this color in the cup when they move it is silver right at last it battle like a serpent and sting it like another and that's what it does you have an hangover next day Thine Eyes Shall Behold stranger let me tell you something those times when I got my when I when I was in that state you could see a woman I can dress a woman without her undressing herself you on another realm there's another Spirit on you at that point in time to dance that build stranger man to actually order a perverse and she just said use this stuff in your heart you you know it didn't stop there he said thou shall be as either lie down in the midst of the sea in other words you know taking it back and forth and or as either lighter on the top of the mass when you're drunk you feel like you're talking about that's why you meet people who are that drunk they feel like the everything but God could work my experience after a little after that I struggled a little bit with it but go to that desire was so much that when I walk around our core right now it smells like I want to puke you know what dude what God did God took that desire totally from even when I come to communion right now which I have to do but I believe in communion and what God I still like I don't want to do it because go to that desire out now if you have anything you're struggling with sister brother don't let it go away let's go take care of it because the winds will come and try out you go to school your friends don't tell you access dry things that they're gonna do nutrition things people are only going you you face your ass at the job the wind will come but when you have the right found the right foundation in Christ nothing will shake it amen remember when it's an Agent of Change Reigns beat down flawed The Sweep of loose material because it's not solidified Vlogs take out loose material that can think materials they cannot stand the test of time when to wipe out anything in a way that has no roots no root in them they appear man destroy them so now if the foundation is shaking and losing what happens Matthew 7 if we lose that building is gone if you're shaky Sunday is gone it's gonna destroy if the foundation is solid in geology when they say a rock Iraq is not just what you see out there that's like one one over a hundred of four direct release if they dig through that's why if they escaping for granted that is for countertops and everything like Granite yourself so uh an ignorance work if you're really looking for on a rock like that didn't look at what's on top they have to do a survey to tell you what's on the bottom because the bottom is way I mean the size amount of it's way more that was on the top so when the rock is coming when the wind is coming you know to shake your life you're not establishing some shaky material or something that's not really really stable you have a basis aim I don't even understand I'm saying it's money you have a basis there's a there's a basis that's stronger than what's on the top and then you cannot be moved said Jesus my Savior I cannot be moved so on Christ the solidwork I Stand All on the ground so wherever you put your trust in or you put your foundations in or put your building in if it's not in Christ it's gonna fall if it's based on organization you know right and generation students based on some good services and great music yeah I love great music don't don't get me wrong but that's not what salvation has built that's one of the true foundations is built on Christ the world when Jesus asked Peter and said who did people say I am I said you know someone said your your journey of this and that but you what do you say I am I God remember he said they said you're Christ I said Flesh and Blood have not given you this relation my father's name was Upon This Rock I will be in my church upon this Foundation I'll beat my church the church is not the way we are right now it's you if God's gonna build it's gonna be on that Foundation that's some Foundation amen I'm getting there amen thank you now remember we talked about the solar Foundation now there's a part of development and I was looking at the word development I was checking you know right there what development means let's check the same web solution I already said to uncover to unfold nine years table nothing can move you know more you're about your own experience now you want to unfold you want to show manifest the gene of who made you where it came from your source it says the word develop it's a verb so the word development growth they're about they're about the same you can use them in interchangeably but they mean different things he talks about uncovering and unraveling the word growth means change from one state to another and that's what that's I'll call it transformation amen World developments on cover to unfold to lay open to receive to disclose or make something known something that's been concealed or without some notice to unravel to free you from complication or confusion to unfold what is intricate or to develop a plan doesn't God have a plan for a plan even before the old Waters made the other plan they wanted to make man his own image now when I say the word image but Obama was saying in on in Genesis chapter 1 chapter 2 was the barometer started referring to that that image is now the flesh that we have right now because the image that we are right now is the image of an animal the Beast and that's why a man doesn't have Holy Ghost will always act like a beast because it's made that image this is the image of it but when they say I want to be a man in my own image it's not an image that we're looking around it's a spirit image the spirit of what he wanted to make him ask God and the Bible said God is spirit and everybody that worship everyone I worship your worship Us in what in spirit and in truth so go to the plan to develop a purpose a plan in an orderly fashion and God oh my God God is the only one that does things in order so now if the Earth is coming saying you know there's no God how do you wake up in the morning and the Sun is just Rising coming from the from the ears how do you wake up order I didn't wake up in the morning and Justice movement the sun is moving and then you know just getting bright and just moving from the West and then at night the stars are in their places no one falls out and when I was dating my wife you know the day I posed the question to her we're watching Stars I remember that and it was in the same Stars I was in Africa I was just you know chilling at home and then I was looking I said oh do you see those star and we're walking watching the the constellation of stars are the birth and she could see everything and everything I saw she saw and someone said this is your time to tell her what you're thinking about tell her right now I say hey girls I like you and I think I want a good father but what am I talking about God is a god of plan and Order and as God's people it's purpose is to unravel you now that you have saved your your life has changed you're growing on him he wants to unravel it wants to be that building on that Foundation to resemble him to look like him and the scriptures this you know how is that done by the word of God the scriptures are very Christ the word by inspiration by Revelation to is bright because the Bride is a gene of Christ and her to burn our bill first before you are we have to know who's unreability who's doing that Christ if you don't know Christ you can't Know Who You Are there's a teaching I I was I was setting up that I was planning to take Sunday school maybe sometimes about who God who is God who God is but the purpose that the reason why we're trying to know who God is because the more inside tries to know who God is you got to know who you really are you getting through your capacity your power like I said earlier the word guard means to know the change and increase we'll look at this word develop I say you know go further have you ever wondered that growth occurs in Dark Places in seclusions it's not where there is noise things grow our fingers grow when we didn't know when you're sleeping you know your next time my nails are growing it's not on the noise so if you don't grow in Christ you got to be with him hidden with him alone with him very very important you got to know who you are it's I know I believed I'm not I'm persuaded so you just not it's not like you you hear about somebody or from a distance you know him in the power of his resurrection you know who God is if you don't know where you are just try to know who God is God's going to reveal who you are to you and it's going to reveal the purpose that he made you because you have a purpose one day the driver at my job was just talking to me said Michael you know I've been wondering these guys okay by the way our drivers make over they make six figures give me good money because you know it's the hazard on the ruin everything you know you know you care if I have good insurance and everything what's tell him he said my God make all this good money yeah these guys different cars it brings to work he's just doing very well said you know what's the essence of living I also lived in and finally I get all the money I want I have the car one that family and that's it I'm not trying to talk to you anymore but I told them I said there's more to it there's more to life more than just having a big fat account and having a career don't just kill being a family there's more to it God has the purpose of me and you everybody here but you cannot know his purpose if you don't stay alone with him you know we're alone in the garden with him spending time with him because in the at that point when you were in that like I said girl doesn't happen and the noise it happens in in the quiet when you when you were with him always you know pointing your heart to him telling him no God I'm not this part of my life is not it's not still good I'm struggling here I'm struggling here he knows what's best why are you doing that what are you doing just developing because you have the Jinn of Christ in you slow developing just having faith and believing God's word because I'm gonna tell you this if you do not have faith and believe God's word right now you will not have faith to believe in rapturing the rapture you'll never have afternoon Faith because what God is doing is slowly building your faith the monster of your faith slowly until you get to a point where you can just believe anything that God say well God tells you what I believe even though even if I don't understand I one day you'd be transformed that's what happened to Enoch the Bible says Enoch walked with God until it was found not I bet that work was some some so much so much come on I feel good about this that if I can walk with God I'll get the point that I'm found now and I've noticed this video that I really know I have vaccination with and after their life gets so much better and they've walked us so much and it just passed onto the other side because if you're a child of a government take you until you're ready um but Robin said the reason why the Raptor is not taking place is because one of the last select is not any India it's not at that point to be after when it gets there God will take all his children so because at that point you you when you're on revealed you are able to crisis the journey you have developed you're not fit for this world no more the world cannot take you no more then what happens God takes the other side that's what you feed for and that's you know and this development does not just happen only by Walking with God also it's also also no no it comes by also following his first his percept one of the things is not focus forsake that assembly of the Saints doesn't matter because when we come and come here what we're doing is the word of God shaping us and then go back and you meditate on those things and listen you you do your personal right now how much is good but also this must come together and we say we're two or three I got it in my name and said yes I've been there amazing so that's the purpose for always Gathering and God has a function for the powerful that I'm going to handle that part and when we come to the house of the Lord we're coming to purge ourselves to cleanse ourselves that's how I want to come here sometimes the pastor the picture hates you hard we're not here to play we're here to submit ourselves and say Lord this is what I have you might understand why it might be harsh on you but if you just submit to it God was going to make a difference in your life and I remember I was talking to a friend about this and it was saying oh you know I'm gonna I'm gonna he told me I was in Florida and said I need a sister I want to get married I did not reply you know I didn't apply if it doesn't have a leadership you would never be able to rule his home right sisters don't marry a man who can't listen to his pastor and I've noticed so much over time and just I've been I've been with my dad in the ministry of no activists when I was I think six or seven up to like nine years so I've been actually I've seen this cycle when men or young woman wants to get married to a point that's what it come on really the pastor that means they cannot tell you what to do no more you feel like you're doing trying to to the BET to do the best but God explains this man in charge to watch it by your soul sister's like hey don't marry a man that would not fall asleep Amanda I'm not respect his parents don't get a marriage your man don't respect his Pastor let's jump from one place the other a man doesn't believe to come to the church I'll be like you know I can read bible message in the house and just stay it's good but God the everything has a purpose and that's why God gave me five foot I'm getting there I'm gonna just pinpoint it and I'll I'll be done are we enjoying this everybody the function of Pi fold is is big God's on the prophet yes to throw us back to the you know Apostolic fathers back to the book of Acts because the book of Acts is done in where it was it ended we are the Continental book of Acts the prophet said so everything that was done book of Acts as to be manifested and asked you but guess what after the prophet left the word the food remember we're talking about the word foundation um uh uh uh um the word the word I was talking about earlier about nurture it means to feed so now the word has been stored now now the fight will come to take that word and feel what do it feed the bread with it as they feed the bread with you you are Dawning or you're dressing I remember Esther when Esther was you know to be to go when that she didn't behave right and kicked her out and as I was there Esther listening to the chief dresser because she he knows exactly what the king likes what color is the love what kind of flowers he like I love the woman to look I love the hair to look like and that's what the five-fold is doing to the bride now that house is built up now it has to grow that's a develop the power forward as a function on that part now a lot of people say oh you know what I can listen to the tapes he said that but that's not what it really means it says say what a tape says he said just what I mean just whatever the word says don't mix it up don't give your interpretation this is what it means just say it leave it like that that's what that means the five foot as a function and I'll read that scripture and then I'll round up and I'll be out of here the password as a function to dress to Bright Now to take that word that's been stored and they bring it by their gift God can give an ability to discern what the need is in the church what you did what I need the times I come here and something that's just going to my mind I'm just so but I'm walking here and the brother Paul is preaching exactly what I'm thinking about he doesn't even know me okay let's say I said you know what why is he put a PAW Patrol about me doesn't even know about me or is he you know checking about me no he's not it's the gift in that man's life that's takes in that word that's you know that word has been stored and applying to the need of your life that's the only way you can grow the five foot has five parts I'm gonna read that scripture quickly and then I will I would um stop right there I think it's a bit of efficiency I remember hours so I'm sure it's there in the book of Ephesians evidence four yet thank you I heard this sometimes you get here and just lost it lost your thought please bear with me if you don't support and then um Paul was talking here about one load on faith on baptism was no just talking about The Walking service I believe her and having as having the spirit and he went down and started talking let's talk about when G when Jesus left verse seven he said but unto everyone is given Grace according to measure of the gift of Christ talking about the ministering gifts now now talking about remember we're talking about don't forget our line of thought solid foundation development growth don't forget that until every month by seven again born to every one of us is giving Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ verse 8 wherefore he said when yes LED captivity captive remember Jesus came from hell like Abraham Lincoln he left the cross went to hell took the keys up here Griffin L and came back to Earth when it came back to Earth all the saints there were an Old Testament they were they were in hates then the Ramos became example of that aids which is also called um Paradise we're taken out of there and the Bible said that they could see the graveyards the grave of sepulchers of old saints that died opened up so when when what happened was that Jesus had taken that key from the Devil and he led those who are you know those who were captive he together it took it took it took care of the Captivity and they said he gave gift unto man excuse me no I'm sorry it's an electably captive and gave gift unto man now verse 9 thou he has sent now he ascended what is it that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth what I was saying earlier and either at the center is the same also that's an all far above all levels that might feel all things not verse 11. and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers they're five five they're fivefold like I said they dare to feed the bread not to the bride to perfection you have a teacher if you don't know what a teacher is you look at brother rap am I right because they see the gift of God and slightness that God bless you brother rap a teacher comes and takes the word takes a message balance it out that even a baby can understand it and that's why when we went to the um a winter YouTube treat that because I had my friends the girl that took picture with you is my wife's friend um uh what's her name again loon he was able to come to the level of young people and let them understand what the message is and the Bible and you tie them together that they can understand it that's what the teacher does what does an apostle do an about an apostle builds he goes to places that has been broken and there's not follow ground there's nothing in there or people are having issues I'm buying them together when it's done it was another place keep going and that's what Paula apostle was that Paul the Apostle was a prophet and an apostle at the same time yeah it was a major prophet I also the spirit of the the gift of an apostle sometimes God gave a man multiple it gives a man but I'll explain that as I go before we know round off now after the teacher about teacher about the apostle an evangelist I'll talk about let me talk about the uh the prophet the father of Heaven is now the two kind of prophets the major prophet and the minor prophet the Major Prophets of look at the Bible are the ones that God speak to per age per time they're not they're not like they might altered by my brother but the Major Prophets are the ones like Elijah like Moses he sent them for a reason to his people just like Major Prophets and dear Bible said they are seers immediate Professor this year and basically it Sears one that sees that ahead of time he knows exactly it's not exactly what's going on and God is showing him what's going to happen over time like like in the future and like John John of government relations saw our time at some time because it was a major prophet and they can tell you God has given ability to even discern what your thinking was in your heart what and that's that but the problem is also the same one a major prophet now there are Minor Prophets who can be multiple at the same time they are in the church remember all those four have a father and their father is a pastor does it mean that the pastor is greater than them no it's not greater than them it's just your father the position that he is and they have to submit to a pastor to lead them now the Minor Prophets have the gifts of Prophecy sometimes that's speaking in tongues they can sometimes they even have dreams of things that are compressing I've got people in a church WIll you know who are gifted like that we'll go show things that happen in church those gifts are good but we're not led by it by the gifts we're led by the word those gifts are there to just put the church in order now in the world I mean I mean out there in no dominations they use that to lead ahead of the word to put the word on the side and use the gift to lead the people and sometimes those gifts who are not all right now the scripture says when a prophet or those Paul was saying one day it's supposed to come together this word demanding purpose and they say something and doesn't come to pass that's come to the altar because if God didn't say and you say God said there's trouble so their function is they they have the gift to prophesy in the life of people and also the gifted with all those gifts I just mentioned now the evangelist is category it comes and scatters everything here it doesn't care how your face looks whether you're nice or your dress good whatever girl puts it doesn't it just says it all the job the pastor pastors the sheep and everything it comes in just sometimes upside down like with a Cadre they don't care how you look they just tell you exactly blue black this is what it is and that's if they walk away they never care how you feel after they walk away but you know what that's the work of an evangelist it's supposed to bring you to repentance like to call Sin Sin cosplay their Spade and walk away now I come to pass I love I don't like you know being a pastor's kid but I love pastors a lot I know I'm talking about my dad had sacrificed my stipend going to college one time because his sister came to the house and asked some money and took me with the next day and give money to the sister I didn't like it but that's what that's what it takes so but I love the Pastoral Ministry because he just explains who Christ is I I read something I don't have it here but the word pessimist appointment I think Latin or Greek I'm not sure I'm not sure but he talks about being a shepherd and if you want to see if a troop has to look at the Life of Christ I love the pastor I bet you we have one here but Apollo has been a great Pastor I'm going to turn this church to Greatness to profession sin that would grow not about growing anything else yeah we're growing every other part but growing mostly mostly in the spiritual part the function of the past is when the balance has gone everybody has gone he brings everything together he didn't mean that we was just trying to you know it makes it sound good he said no this is what it meant that's what it meant oh you got a broken leg okay I'm on the nurse it that caused yeah it does ask for the pop and the party it tells you said they pass us a boarding bear they have so much burden that it just borders them and when they say a man that's like that it shows the gift that is in his life so I'll say Pastor here sometimes he just has to burden for the people it's not him it's a gift in him but all these five five on the functions are there to dress to Bright Crisis coming one day people don't even talk about it about it no more people don't think about you know Jesus come back no more this new songs that I hear the very few of them talk about Jesus coming no more because now it's telling some people I tell you the Lord is coming one day I don't give a kind of all the times that we have on her that's given us to him if you're not ready it's in your hands but these five four that there the Bible said for sure for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for they are defined of the body of Christ two it's a class there two we all come in the unity of the faith so if they're still rank or on different things just going back and forth and you know this will not believe this one or you can play drums or you cannot play drums oh I don't like trumpets you like trumpet oh I don't like this but a person is too many songs there'll be different parts around but guess what this five-fold is the tool that God is going to use to unite the bride together because if you know United Christ is not coming to walk Harmony into our faith and listen of the knowledge of the son of God knowing who God is onto a perfect man I remember to bring it to that that sort of statutory old church remember I really enjoyed that on to a perfect man onto the measure of this stature listen of the fullness of Christ not halfway not a quarter fullness listen now now we'll talk about growth right that we asked for it be no more children toast for toe and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine we're now on a strong Foundation solid foundation on Christ the solid rock the acid no no no if a gigantic kind of no no no no no no no rock where we're not moving about induction when the doctor when abduction comes around because this Firefall they teach you you remember in in Matthew 7 is that the people were astonished at his Doctrine the teaching this life will bring that teaching of Christ they established them where nothing I'm moving no more that we answered me no more children toes to and fro and carried about with everyone of Doctrine by the slave of man because man I'm telling even in the mess you're going to see ministers who are not of God don't be shocked because the Bible is going to have false prophets false preachers excuse me slay of men communists and cunning craftiness they can have some some license about them that if it feels good it looks good but what is the fruit that comes with it be careful when I look at the Minnesota three things I look for when I look at Minister I'm just being honest with you I know when I meet that Minister I'm shipping with you judge me too but when I see a minister the third thing I'm looking for I look at the Life of Christ number one simplicity number two what is their goal what are they trying to express trying to predict himself by their protect Christ number three are they accessible can anybody assess them like enrich them like oh no you can denominations to be a bishop you have to become it makes it difficult to even talk to the man like like a demigod like remember um in the seven churches the spirit of nicolitan where they just want a lot of other people but when I say Truman aside look at the Life of Christ and look at oh no this is this is not a so there'll be men like that so watch out not every minute status of God but the right ones will be there to perfect the bride that's a joke by the slave of men and cunning Crafters who whereby they laying with to deceive note their aim like I said what is their goal they want to be known do I want to be prominent do whatever to know them they want to be fired for them to be in every church I'm preaching everywhere is that the aim or is or is there m is the aim to perfect the Church of Christ to make sure that our lives are better is that is that the aim if that's not their aim that they're not of God because everything that was on Earth right now has one purpose one purpose to glorify God he doesn't glorify God it's not of God and guess what where did that Source came from that commonness and trying to glorified itself came from the Devil so when you see that spirit is coming straight on the bottom from the Pizza Bell an anointing man and they they deceived the Bible guess what Jesus said you know he said if it's just possible they'd like to be disabled you know what they will never be deceived because they are of God you can take them with a little Doctrine or teaching for a little bit just a matter of time give them time that that man is a child of God inside of God God will break them free from those bondages false doctrines and guess what I'll send them to school what Paul's Doctrine does it builds up hypocrisy fakeness and guess guess who suffer the Next Generation that's why solid teaching is very important because when you're passing the generation is still solid but when it's no fake and it's not it's not it's not based on God's word it produces a bunch of fake hypocrisy called generation next next to next to that generation that's what happens but speaking the truth in love this minister is going to tell you the truth because it's not their word they're taking what God it's not even them they're just a mouthpiece that's what a minister stands for a mouthpiece speak the truth in love they may grow up and grow up unto him and all things which is head even Christ from whom the whole body fatally joined together and compacted by that every joint supplied according to the factual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body until it defining of itself in love thank you Brian so the path would have a purpose and that proposes what I read and I pray my I have on prayer this morning my prayers that God would just help everybody to have a strong Foundation in Christ and I have every parent to instill that foundation with the young being their kids and every young person to realize come to a realization of who they really are and summon themselves to Christ because when they submit themselves man you can do exploits the Bible said hey man let's buy it as the mission has come on crisis drug I stand in all of the ground he sink in sand all along the ground he's sinking help me sing it on cries the solid rock High stands [Music] my hope is built on nothingness then Jesus blood and righteousness I dare not trust the sweetest friend but long or lean on Jesus name on Christ the solid rock ice all on the ground you sink inside all
