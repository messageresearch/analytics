[0:00] jesus christ and i've been around him
[0:03] long enough for these years i know when
[0:04] he's present
[0:06] and he's here there isn't any problem or
[0:09] trouble there isn't anything that you
[0:11] are facing
[0:13] that's too big for the person that's
[0:15] here this morning
[0:17] so i ask you if you don't trust me or if
[0:20] you don't trust
[0:21] people or whatever you trust that person
[0:24] who's here
[0:26] and he'll he has the answer for you and
[0:29] he is the answer
[0:31] he not only has the answers he is the
[0:33] answer for your life
[0:35] amen jonah chapter 4 and verse 9.
[0:40] god said to jonah does thou well to be
[0:44] angry for the gourd
[0:46] and he said i do well to be angry even
[0:49] unto death
[0:52] and then said the lord thou hast had
[0:55] pity or compassion on the gourd for the
[0:58] which thou hast not labored
[0:59] neither madest it to grow which came up
[1:02] in a night and perished in a night
[1:05] you had pity on the gourd and then verse
[1:07] 11 and should not i
[1:09] spare nineveh that great city wherein
[1:12] are more than
[1:13] six score thousand persons that cannot
[1:16] discern
[1:16] between their right hand and their left
[1:19] and also
[1:21] much cattle and that's how jonah ends
[1:24] that's the last
[1:25] verse of it but i pray there will be
[1:27] something in here
[1:29] that we can learn from this morning how
[1:31] many has learned from the book of jonah
[1:33] already
[1:34] amen i trust the lord help us to express
[1:36] it our heavenly father
[1:40] it's one of those services lord that
[1:44] reminds me of when they dedicated the
[1:46] temple
[1:47] in the old testament and the priests
[1:51] could not stand to minister because of
[1:52] the glory of the lord
[1:54] that filled the place i feel that way a
[1:56] bit this morning lord i feel
[1:58] to just go in a corner somewhere and
[2:02] praise you and worship you
[2:07] thank you for what you've done
[2:10] and thank you for what you've
[2:14] thank you how you love each of these
[2:16] people here lord
[2:18] you know how to love us lord
[2:23] so we thank you for your glory and your
[2:25] presence
[2:26] and lord the heavens and earth will pass
[2:30] away
[2:30] but we know when we have your word we
[2:32] have everything
[2:33] so when i minister it this morning i
[2:35] pray that you will take it and
[2:37] anoint it lord let it be for each person
[2:41] as we learn from your word and learn the
[2:44] great lesson that jonah had to learn
[2:46] that your ways are higher than ours lord
[2:49] and we're to trust your ways because
[2:51] your thoughts are higher your
[2:53] ways are higher you know better than us
[2:56] so that's why we can trust you we love
[2:59] you lord
[3:00] put these things in your hands now for
[3:02] your glory in jesus name
[3:04] amen amen once you shake somebody's hand
[3:07] before you take your seat
[3:08] greet them in the name of the lord god
[3:10] bless you each one
[3:27] hey man pull myself together here a bit
[3:29] this morning
[3:30] praise the lord
[3:34] so we're going to go look this morning a
[3:36] little bit at jonah's life and we'll see
[3:38] how far we get we're just going to look
[3:39] at it just towards the end and
[3:41] i wanted to say this that something lord
[3:43] showed me that
[3:45] as he opens up the book of jonah to me
[3:48] and for those of you who don't know back
[3:50] when kovid was hitting so strong last
[3:52] year
[3:53] i started to read jonah and that's when
[3:55] things began to i begin to get curious
[3:57] about it
[3:58] because there's a lot in it that i
[3:59] didn't understand there's still some
[4:01] that i don't understand but
[4:02] it is a very mysterious life and jonah
[4:05] has a very mysterious and
[4:06] strange way that he responded to god
[4:10] and it became very i became inquisitive
[4:13] about it
[4:14] and so it's been that long since last
[4:16] year that i finally get to preach a
[4:17] series on it and it has opened up
[4:19] but one of the things that i seen is at
[4:21] the end of the old testament
[4:24] we know that there came an expression of
[4:27] christ at the very
[4:28] end of the old testament there came a
[4:30] final expression
[4:31] of a mystery that was in the old
[4:32] testament and that was jesus christ and
[4:35] so at the end of the old testament
[4:37] it all climaxed into jesus christ and he
[4:39] came
[4:40] and he everything that the types and
[4:42] shadows were speaking of in the prophets
[4:44] it had a climax time to come to jesus
[4:47] christ coming to earth
[4:48] going to calvary paying for our sins and
[4:50] then resurrecting the third day
[4:52] and so it all climaxed and he paid the
[4:55] price at calvary
[4:56] for us he went into a tomb and he come
[4:58] out the third day
[5:00] and so and then then if we know the
[5:03] scripture then we know at the end of the
[5:05] new testament
[5:06] he will do the same thing in the sense
[5:08] there will be a final expression
[5:10] of the same christ at the end of the new
[5:12] testament
[5:13] but it will be the same christ in his
[5:15] people the bride of jesus christ
[5:18] so it all kind of builds up and mounts
[5:20] up and
[5:21] and it gets explosive and then it
[5:23] explodes and there's this full
[5:24] expression
[5:25] so at the end of it is christ again and
[5:28] and you live during this time when this
[5:31] final expression of christ comes
[5:33] through our lives as the bride of jesus
[5:35] christ and so as we as we looked at this
[5:38] um short story in the bible of jonah and
[5:41] we've seen his flaws and we've seen his
[5:44] running from the lord and we've seen his
[5:46] uh his attitude and his anger his
[5:48] attitude to
[5:49] toward god even for giving mercy to the
[5:52] ninevites and
[5:53] anger and prejudice to the to the
[5:55] ninevites
[5:56] and and justice basically a stubbornness
[6:00] in jonah
[6:01] uh and uh you know his life
[6:05] with all of that stubbornness and with
[6:07] all of that
[6:08] anger his book in the bible his first
[6:11] part of his life the first pattern of
[6:13] his chapter
[6:14] typed the death burial and resurrection
[6:16] of jesus christ
[6:17] and you remember jesus said that he said
[6:20] you're looking for a sign
[6:21] he said i'll give you a sign as jonas
[6:23] was in the belly of the fish
[6:25] for three days show the so shall the son
[6:28] of man
[6:29] be in the earth and come out again the
[6:30] third day so no matter what we think of
[6:33] jonah and how
[6:34] bad it would look his life was a type
[6:37] of christ coming the first time that's
[6:40] pretty good can you say mine
[6:42] and so his his you know we look at all
[6:45] his life but
[6:46] it his life was written the death burial
[6:49] resurrection of christ
[6:50] and that's why jesus said it that way
[6:52] but what what god showed me in this last
[6:55] chapter
[6:56] it also has the mystery written of the
[6:58] bride in the last days the last chapter
[7:00] of jonah's life
[7:01] believe it or not has this mystery
[7:03] written of christ
[7:05] in his bride in the last days and what
[7:08] he lives through and what he's trying to
[7:09] express
[7:10] at the very end and we'll get to that
[7:12] and you'll know why i'm saying that but
[7:14] it isn't wonderful that a guy that
[7:16] uh we would mark off as being he doesn't
[7:18] look like a son of god he's not acting
[7:19] like a son of god
[7:21] he's got all the characteristics that
[7:22] just don't seem like as i said last
[7:24] sunday
[7:25] i would have just stopped the chapter
[7:27] right there
[7:28] at the third chapter and got a new
[7:31] recruit
[7:31] and just ditched jonah i would have
[7:34] ditched jonah
[7:35] completely but then i said it's
[7:37] difficult to ditch him because
[7:38] his name's on the book it's called jonah
[7:41] so you can't ditch him and
[7:43] incidentally your name is on the lamb's
[7:45] book of life too and
[7:47] you can't ditch you either can you say
[7:48] amen hallelujah
[7:52] but we would get rid of him but we
[7:53] couldn't and so now there's got to be
[7:55] something in here towards the end of his
[7:56] life that's expressing
[7:58] if he expressed the first coming of
[8:00] christ then he's expressing the second
[8:02] coming of christ but it's just hard to
[8:04] catch the mystery in it but if you keep
[8:06] looking
[8:06] and reading it becomes so plain that
[8:09] there's something in here
[8:10] that in this last chapter is something
[8:12] for us to draw from
[8:14] it's difficult to draw that conclusion
[8:16] on how this man is acting
[8:18] his anger his stubbornness and so it
[8:21] becomes an example of us
[8:23] all because no matter how perfect that
[8:25] you feel that you are this morning and
[8:26] some people think they're perfect and
[8:28] some people feel they're good people and
[8:30] that's all fine and dandy
[8:31] but if you're a son and daughter of god
[8:33] he's got to
[8:35] work on us and get all of the anger out
[8:37] of us and all the stubbornness out of us
[8:40] i know probably not nobody here is ever
[8:43] stubborn but
[8:44] jonah was and there's a lot of stubborn
[8:46] people that are
[8:47] christians that come a hard way and
[8:49] finally surrender
[8:52] can you say amen and if you think for
[8:54] one moment i've looked at this and seen
[8:56] me perfect i'll tell you i see
[8:58] way too much of me in jonah
[9:01] in this series i told someone the other
[9:02] day this has been a personal reflection
[9:04] for me
[9:05] because i see way too much i'm not
[9:07] perfect
[9:08] at all for sure and i'm not where i need
[9:10] to be
[9:11] but i'm i'm in the right place and i'm
[9:14] in the right presence this morning can
[9:16] you say amen
[9:17] lord people think you're super spiritual
[9:19] as a pastor man you can preach some real
[9:21] masterpieces you must be really walking
[9:23] in the spirit all the time
[9:25] you know i was going to tell you a
[9:26] couple sundays ago i had a dream
[9:29] this is how spiritual i am sometimes you
[9:31] think you have spiritual dreams and i've
[9:32] had spiritual dreams i haven't had a
[9:34] dream
[9:34] that my wife and i and this is just
[9:36] before about a couple hours before i
[9:39] come out to preach i had a dream that me
[9:40] and my wife were invited to go on a ufo
[9:46] this is my dream this you know and i
[9:48] come and preach and we had a great
[9:49] service
[9:50] this is two three hours before and i'm
[9:51] sleeping in a real deep sleep and this
[9:53] is what i
[9:53] that's what i dream about and i get mad
[9:56] i get mad at that i say lord
[9:57] can't i have a spiritual dream before i
[10:00] preach
[10:01] we were invited to go on a ufo and we i
[10:04] seen it come down in the dream and it
[10:06] hovered down and all the stairway came
[10:08] out from the ufo and i said honda
[10:10] we've been invited to go on this ufo and
[10:13] but i got nervous and i begin to delay
[10:16] because i was wondering if there's going
[10:18] to be enough snacks up there
[10:20] i'm serious this is what i'm thinking
[10:23] so we're around a bunch of stores and
[10:26] i'm i start running in these stores and
[10:28] pilfering through these snacks and
[10:30] twinkies and everything i'm
[10:31] i'm buying up and my wife she's out
[10:33] there waiting on me and there's only a
[10:35] certain amount of time to get on the ufo
[10:37] and i'm just buying up these and then
[10:38] when i get all these snacks and i'm
[10:40] thinking
[10:40] now do i do i need a phone charger up
[10:42] there
[10:44] or or does or does it just charge on its
[10:48] own in the ufo
[10:49] you laugh but that's what i'm thinking
[10:51] in my dream buy a few phone chargers and
[10:53] i'm doing this and all of a sudden
[10:55] and i don't know why it ends this way
[10:56] but i got left
[10:58] she went up the stairs and i'm running
[11:00] out with my snacks
[11:02] and the door closes and i miss it
[11:05] she goes without me and that's the end
[11:08] of my spiritual dream
[11:10] before i come up and preach i hate that
[11:14] and i hate the fact i'm even telling you
[11:16] you probably lose respect
[11:17] just be telling you that's how the dream
[11:20] was and i got left
[11:21] with all my snacks if you i tell you
[11:23] this i just saw this if you ask my wife
[11:26] it is the lord trying to tell me
[11:28] something
[11:32] there's a lot of meaning in that dream
[11:34] if you would ask my wife
[11:36] of what's most important in my life
[11:39] going with my wife on the trip or snacks
[11:46] but in jonah's life there's so much here
[11:49] that is just so
[11:50] opposite and we would have dumped him
[11:52] out but i'll tell you one thing
[11:54] god didn't and god kept working with him
[11:56] as we spoke last sunday he kept working
[11:58] with him
[11:59] and he's going to keep working with sons
[12:01] and daughters of god because we're in
[12:03] the time of adoption
[12:04] and we are to mature into adopted sons
[12:07] and we're to embrace
[12:08] all the word of god that he's given us
[12:10] and we're not to compromise on any of it
[12:12] and we're supposed to grow
[12:14] because it's not just that we would get
[12:15] a good feeling in the service or be able
[12:18] to shout and dance
[12:19] we want to be able to live just as high
[12:21] as we shout and we want to be able to
[12:23] see the expression of christ in our life
[12:26] that is the maturity of a a full matured
[12:29] son and daughter of god
[12:30] that's the age we're in the word that
[12:32] we've received is a word of adoption to
[12:34] take the people
[12:35] to adoption and i'm looking to see that
[12:37] in my life i'm looking to see it in your
[12:39] life
[12:40] that's what this message is meant to do
[12:42] not for us to have another healing
[12:44] revival
[12:45] although i enjoy that but it's to take
[12:47] the people as i said last sunday
[12:49] it's not how much you shout on sunday at
[12:51] church it's how
[12:52] your behavior is through the week
[12:57] praise the lord and so now you know it's
[12:59] difficult to draw the conclusion that
[13:01] this man had
[13:02] written in his life christ and in his
[13:04] his biography is our writing of christ
[13:06] himself
[13:07] when we look at the stubbornness when we
[13:09] look at the anger how can the very
[13:11] mystery of christ and the bride
[13:13] come out of all this and you ask the
[13:15] question can any good thing come out of
[13:17] jonah
[13:18] can any good thing come out of this last
[13:21] chapter of this man
[13:22] i want to remind everybody that that's
[13:24] what they said about jesus where he come
[13:26] from
[13:26] they said can any good thing come out of
[13:28] nazareth
[13:29] because nazareth when i was in israel a
[13:31] couple years ago nazareth is still to
[13:33] this day a city that's looked down on
[13:35] it doesn't look that that prosperous at
[13:37] all and back then it was even less
[13:39] prosperous
[13:40] and had some real bad people in it and
[13:42] all these other things and so when they
[13:44] said the messiah come out of there
[13:45] they said can any good thing come out
[13:48] of of nazareth that's what they said
[13:50] about it and that's jonah can any good
[13:52] thing come out of this life the last
[13:53] chapter of jonah i asked you the same
[13:55] question
[13:56] can any good thing come out of your life
[13:58] after all that you've been through
[14:00] can any good think of only by the grace
[14:02] of god
[14:03] something good can come out of it
[14:07] no matter what your life biography has
[14:09] been
[14:10] if he can bring it out of christ and
[14:12] where he come from and that city
[14:14] then he can bring it out of you as well
[14:16] can you say amen
[14:17] so before we're so critical of jonah
[14:20] we're looking at the mirror and
[14:22] and and we're looking to see before we
[14:24] examine
[14:25] the fruit in his life and examine the
[14:27] fruit in everybody else's
[14:28] life because that's what people tend to
[14:30] do they tend to become fruit inspectors
[14:33] and examine the fruit in everybody
[14:34] else's life
[14:36] this series has been a mirror to look at
[14:39] our own lives
[14:41] amen praise the lord
[14:44] and uh the first part reveals christ
[14:48] coming out of the tomb
[14:49] the second part is where we are right
[14:51] now and the mystery of the end time
[14:53] the conditions right now and what is
[14:55] needed and
[14:56] specific i'll say it the conditions
[14:58] right now that we're in
[14:59] the conditions of the bride the
[15:01] conditions of our life and what is
[15:03] needed and how god will deal with us
[15:05] to get what is needed for the hour and
[15:08] we'll elaborate on that what is needed
[15:10] for this
[15:10] particular hour in the final seconds of
[15:13] time
[15:14] we are at the end time if you're a
[15:15] visitor here today we are very
[15:17] we're at the very closing seconds of
[15:19] time we're at the end time it's the wrap
[15:21] up of everything
[15:22] things will not continue as they were
[15:24] before
[15:26] christ is has launched his second coming
[15:29] can you say man
[15:30] we're in the cycle of the second coming
[15:32] of christ so i would encourage you to
[15:34] look to god if you're a visitor this
[15:36] morning
[15:36] look to god if you're anyone this
[15:39] morning look to the lord it's time
[15:41] to seek the lord it's time to get closer
[15:43] to him it's not
[15:44] time to get further away and we're in
[15:47] that cycle but what is he doing right
[15:49] now and what is
[15:50] needed for the bride in this hour how
[15:52] should we respond
[15:54] and then jonah shows how god deals with
[15:57] jonah
[15:57] to get this result out of us and to
[15:59] bring us to a place
[16:01] really to bring us to a place that we
[16:03] realize that anger is one thing
[16:06] but that god himself his love and his
[16:08] compassion
[16:09] is greater than his anger
[16:13] amen how many know god gets angry
[16:18] he has a holy anger but we learn
[16:20] throughout the bible
[16:22] at the end of the day his compassion
[16:25] is greater than his anger
[16:28] i would like to live that way how many
[16:30] would raise your hand
[16:31] that something overrides in your life
[16:33] and your compassion is greater than your
[16:35] anger
[16:39] so all jonah you know really all jonah
[16:42] is eating
[16:43] jonah is needing a victory in divine
[16:45] love
[16:47] how many knows the bride that's what
[16:48] we're looking to a victory in divine
[16:49] love
[16:51] amen jonah needs a victory in divine
[16:53] love that's what he's needed
[16:55] is the same thing that we need a victory
[16:57] in divine love
[16:59] and so if we take a step back from
[17:00] wednesday night god ordered some things
[17:02] to test jonah he
[17:04] he made he he made him look at what he
[17:07] was lacking in his life
[17:08] and so he got real personal to see what
[17:10] he really did it was really to see what
[17:12] jonah was tied to
[17:14] and he was so tied to his anger and his
[17:16] unresolved anger whatever that anger
[17:18] came from
[17:20] god wanted to put a mirror in front of
[17:21] him and take him through things to be
[17:23] able to see
[17:23] this is what you look like this is where
[17:25] you're at of course you're not ready to
[17:27] minister to the ninevites
[17:28] or be happy they're they're repenting
[17:31] because there's some unresolved anger in
[17:33] your life
[17:33] and i want to keep letting you look at
[17:35] this until you die to it
[17:36] and so god touches a certain personal
[17:40] area of his life in other words his
[17:41] convenience
[17:42] it's the hot sun he's in the hot sun and
[17:45] god
[17:45] raises up within a few hours a gourd or
[17:48] a lily plant or a
[17:50] you know a certain type of plant and it
[17:52] it shades him
[17:53] and then the bible says he's extremely
[17:55] happy and then
[17:57] it turns around a worm begins to eat it
[17:59] and it's gone the next day
[18:00] he becomes extremely angry again and so
[18:03] god
[18:04] is really showing what jonah is tied to
[18:07] and where his emotions are going and see
[18:10] what his absolute really was
[18:12] we will have that in our life jonah was
[18:14] up and down in his commitment
[18:16] he was in and out and i'm just
[18:17] rehearsing some things real quickly
[18:19] just for the visitors so they catch up
[18:21] jonah was up and down as
[18:23] his commitment he was never fully in he
[18:25] was in and he was out
[18:26] he was led by how he felt rather than
[18:29] god's will
[18:30] the temperature outside affected his
[18:32] attitude
[18:33] that sounds like some of us sometimes
[18:36] the weather report affects whether we're
[18:37] going to be happy or not
[18:39] the temperature outside affects people's
[18:41] attitudes
[18:42] and this is what was what it was with
[18:44] jonah the ninevites affected his
[18:46] attitude because he didn't really
[18:47] initially like the ninevites and if
[18:49] things were going well
[18:51] in the weather and everything else he
[18:53] was real
[18:54] happy if everything was running smooth
[18:56] he was re
[18:57] he wasn't just happy he was real happy
[19:00] uh
[19:00] and when he was happy he was supportive
[19:03] he paid his ties
[19:05] he did what god told him to do if he was
[19:07] feeling happy
[19:09] and if the week turned out real good he
[19:11] was so pleasant to be around
[19:13] and he was happy but if the week didn't
[19:16] turn out good and things didn't turn out
[19:17] convenient
[19:18] he went back to his angry self again
[19:25] and god in his love tested him to show
[19:28] that he was not tied to the absolute of
[19:31] christ the word
[19:32] he was actually when push come to shove
[19:35] he
[19:36] sweated over the little things rather
[19:39] than
[19:40] the important things and in this case
[19:43] souls
[19:45] somebody i'm i asked you to put your
[19:47] seatbelt on this one because i'm going
[19:48] to be very
[19:49] plain and specific
[19:54] i've been preaching along now and i just
[19:56] it's time to get real
[19:58] specific now let's read the quote from
[20:00] wednesday night because this was a coat
[20:01] that i felt like
[20:02] not just the wednesday night crowd
[20:04] should hear but the sunday crowd as well
[20:06] so we need and we need to hear this
[20:07] agree again so he speaks in the message
[20:10] um in one of the messages here towards
[20:12] the end and he speaks of jonah and he
[20:14] says
[20:14] in the day that we're living now if you
[20:17] guys have that quote back there
[20:19] in the day that we're living in now and
[20:20] everything's so breaking up
[20:22] so fragile and carried away i think that
[20:25] this message would be very appropriate
[20:27] thing especially to christians
[20:28] when they are going through their deep
[20:30] waters now the christian church is
[20:32] passing through the deepest waters it's
[20:35] had
[20:35] for the last 2 000 years so the message
[20:38] he's going to preach is the absolute
[20:40] and he said the christian church is
[20:41] passing through the deepest water it's
[20:42] had for the
[20:43] 2000 years because we are coming to a
[20:45] spot to where there is something
[20:47] presented
[20:48] to christianity something they have to
[20:49] make a decision on
[20:51] and that would be false the antichrist
[20:53] spirit a false christianity
[20:55] that'll be presented and people will
[20:56] fall by that we're not interested in
[20:59] false christianity we want true
[21:00] christianity but we live in an hour that
[21:03] there will be a test
[21:04] of the antichrist spirit to choose false
[21:06] christianity or true christianity
[21:08] and we're coming to the spot that said
[21:10] something that we have to make a
[21:11] decision on
[21:12] and i think that the christian church
[21:13] ought to have something
[21:15] that they know that they are tied to
[21:18] instead of just floating about
[21:20] like a leaf upon the water the wind as
[21:22] the bible said carried about by every
[21:24] wind of doctrine we spoke about the
[21:26] different winds
[21:27] on wednesday night the eastern wind god
[21:29] sent jonah an eastern wind a vehement
[21:31] easter wind
[21:32] eastern wind we have north winds we have
[21:34] south winds and all of those represent
[21:36] spiritual
[21:37] pressures in our lives and to test us
[21:40] whether we will stand through the winds
[21:42] and then in ephesians he says we don't
[21:44] be children
[21:45] carried about with every wind of
[21:46] doctrine the winds come and blow the
[21:49] little leaf this way and then another
[21:50] one comes the north wind the south wind
[21:52] the east wind the west wind you'll never
[21:54] get anywhere you're not stable
[21:56] but the cr the christian life should be
[21:58] a stable life
[22:00] it would be something that's a principle
[22:01] that you are tied to
[22:03] that is more than life itself we need a
[22:06] principle of life
[22:07] that we're tied to that is more than
[22:09] life itself
[22:10] that's why paul could say to for me to
[22:12] live it's christ
[22:14] to die is gain we need an absolute to
[22:18] tie to
[22:19] but look what he says here he said and
[22:21] you must have something that you're tied
[22:23] to
[22:23] some people are tied to their business
[22:28] and that shows up in their life with
[22:30] push come to serve
[22:32] they're tied to their business more than
[22:34] they are to the lord
[22:37] some are tied to their families when
[22:40] push comes to shove
[22:41] they're tied more than their families
[22:43] than they are to the lord
[22:46] and their commitment to the lord some
[22:48] are tied to their creed
[22:50] some are tied to the uh tied to an army
[22:53] post
[22:54] we have a different things that we're
[22:55] tied to but i think as a christian
[22:57] we ought to be tied where we know is
[22:59] right you see because you might
[23:00] be tied to your family and your wife
[23:03] could leave you you might
[23:04] be tied to the army you might get killed
[23:06] you might be tied to any
[23:08] different things and it's got an end but
[23:10] there has got to be a final title post
[23:12] there's got to be something somewhere
[23:14] excuse me be somewhere
[23:15] that man has got to tie for his eternal
[23:18] destination
[23:19] because if you're going to trust in your
[23:20] work when your work is finished it's
[23:23] done
[23:23] when your family is taken it's over but
[23:26] there's only one thing that i think is a
[23:28] final tie post
[23:29] and i believe paul had a thai post in
[23:31] his life here and i'd like to sign
[23:33] in and if we'd call it that way and
[23:34] speak on that typos
[23:36] he said for me to live is christ and to
[23:39] die
[23:40] is gain paul had an absolute in his life
[23:43] paul had the final the final say in
[23:46] paul's life
[23:47] was not family was not business with not
[23:50] the pressures of life but it's what the
[23:52] lord says to do and whether i'm going to
[23:53] obey the lord or not
[23:56] and i'm going to live that way and if i
[23:57] have to die doing it i'll die doing it
[23:59] but i'm going to
[24:00] for me to live as christ to die is gain
[24:03] either way i win but i'm going to serve
[24:06] the lord anyhow
[24:07] how many wants that absolute this
[24:09] morning that's the thai post not your
[24:11] family
[24:12] your family may fail you people have a
[24:15] comfort blanket and resort back to their
[24:17] family all the time
[24:18] but you need to be tied to the lord
[24:20] because your family
[24:21] may not be there someday oh i don't
[24:23] believe that brother but my family all
[24:25] stick with i always stick with me
[24:26] there's a lot of families that learn
[24:28] that's not true
[24:29] especially if you make a real stand for
[24:31] the lord you'll have some family members
[24:33] leave you
[24:34] that's why you need to be tied to the
[24:36] lord tied to his word
[24:38] not your family i love family i love my
[24:41] family but i'm not tied my
[24:42] final tie post isn't to my family it's
[24:45] to the lord
[24:46] and so so for me to live is christ to
[24:49] die so that's where we find jonah we
[24:51] find that
[24:52] he wasn't tied to the right thing and
[24:53] today we're going to find out what he's
[24:55] really tied to
[24:56] and this is where we pick up our text
[24:57] again in verse 9
[24:59] god says i i don't want to get to skip
[25:02] over this part of verse 9.
[25:03] god asked him the question do us thou
[25:05] well to be angry for the gourd so god
[25:08] says
[25:09] is your anger doing you well
[25:12] is it good for you to stay angry god's
[25:15] asking
[25:15] isn't it really amazing when the lord
[25:17] asks us honest questions
[25:20] whether it's anger or anything else he
[25:21] said he said jonah
[25:24] is is it is it really doing you well to
[25:27] stay
[25:28] with unresolved festering anger on the
[25:30] inside
[25:33] when the lord asks you those questions
[25:34] make sure you answer honestly
[25:38] is it really doing you good to stay in
[25:41] this festering anger
[25:43] at me and at other people
[25:47] you may not be angry at god this morning
[25:49] some people are angry at god
[25:51] you just may have had too many years of
[25:53] being angry and festering and
[25:55] with people and how they've done you
[25:57] wrong
[25:59] people in the church people outside the
[26:02] church
[26:03] preachers so
[26:07] anger has a way of
[26:10] in its innocence it has an
[26:13] innocence because our emotion we can get
[26:15] angry at something
[26:17] but we have to be angry at the right
[26:18] things
[26:20] and not angry at the wrong things and
[26:23] anger has a way of growing like a cancer
[26:25] like bitterness does and it just grows
[26:28] and grows and grows and if we don't deal
[26:30] with it
[26:31] then it starts to spill out and control
[26:33] our lives and then we get to jonah where
[26:35] he
[26:36] begins to take up with pity and stupid
[26:38] things
[26:40] and forget the compassion that he needs
[26:41] for other people
[26:43] that's why we got to die to our anger
[26:45] because if it festers it hinders our
[26:47] work of the lord it hinders us being
[26:49] free
[26:49] it hinders us being a free christian
[26:52] anger
[26:53] if it grows on the inside and it's never
[26:55] good and that's why when god said to
[26:57] jonah
[26:57] is it good for you to stay angry you're
[26:59] going to be surprised at his answer
[27:01] but the answer should have been no it is
[27:03] never good to hang on to your anger
[27:06] it is never does any good to hang on to
[27:08] it if it festers
[27:09] you've got to bring it to the cross and
[27:11] say god as you forgive
[27:12] us god help me and send a wave of
[27:15] forgiveness to wash away
[27:17] this bitterness and anger i have got to
[27:19] resolve this
[27:20] if if my dad or my daddy never repents
[27:23] to me or my mommy
[27:24] or the people in my life that's done me
[27:26] wrong i can resolve it through the cross
[27:28] of jesus christ
[27:30] i can see it healed within me so that i
[27:32] can go on and live
[27:35] my anger is not going to hold there
[27:37] until somebody makes it right
[27:39] i'm going to release it to calvary can
[27:41] you say that
[27:43] we have to do it because it's not good
[27:45] it brings
[27:46] bad things if you're a person that
[27:48] doesn't harbor a lot of anger
[27:49] on the inside of you i say praise the
[27:51] lord that's how you should be living
[27:53] but for the rest of us sometimes that
[27:54] lets something sit there and the devil
[27:56] gets a hold of it
[27:57] it can hinder our spiritual spiritual
[27:59] walk and we have to resolve it that's
[28:01] why he says in ephesians
[28:03] he says be angry and sin not
[28:06] don't let the sun go down on your wrath
[28:10] why because it grows it festers
[28:13] and we have to release it we have to
[28:15] forgive
[28:17] so when he asks
[28:20] does it do any good for you to stay
[28:22] angry
[28:23] at others at me at my will at when
[28:26] things go different than you
[28:27] wanted is it right and his answer should
[28:30] have been no
[28:31] anger has never done me well
[28:34] and then you could start explaining what
[28:36] anger has done for you anger has never
[28:38] done any
[28:39] anybody well
[28:42] you should be answering anger has never
[28:44] done me good
[28:46] as a matter of fact it has broken family
[28:49] relationships
[28:51] it has tore kids hearts to pieces
[28:54] it has tore churches up it has split
[28:57] churches
[28:59] it has made preachers abuse the people
[29:04] i'm telling you there's nothing good
[29:06] that ever
[29:07] comes from unresolved anger
[29:11] never been anything good come from and
[29:13] that's why
[29:14] we have to say lord you know what's
[29:17] inside me
[29:18] come lord no jonah should have been
[29:21] saying and once again here responds so
[29:24] he responds so crazy
[29:27] but he should have been saying no my
[29:28] anger hasn't done me good my whole life
[29:31] and lord i'm ready to bring it to you so
[29:34] i can be effective for your kingdom
[29:39] and uh we can list the things that it
[29:43] it destroys and if it destroyed things
[29:47] in your parents or your
[29:48] former church or whatever then it'll do
[29:50] the same work and you if you don't stop
[29:52] it right here and say i'm i'm done
[29:54] with this my dad was an
[29:57] angry man my mom was an angry person my
[30:00] you know and you can point back to that
[30:01] but you got to say lord this has to stop
[30:04] here
[30:07] that's one of the things sometimes i
[30:08] like about young people is that they
[30:09] don't have all the
[30:11] the history sometimes and they're more
[30:13] flexible to work with and
[30:15] more teachable they have less bitterness
[30:17] and less anger and so they're more
[30:19] teachable if you get older
[30:20] you develop all these disappointments in
[30:22] life disappointed in people
[30:24] it kind of grows and it's harder to get
[30:26] to you because you become a
[30:27] overly angry person at things and you
[30:30] put people in compartments and you
[30:32] you don't trust anybody but a young
[30:34] heart and brother brahm says this he
[30:36] speaks about that
[30:36] brother brahm says you know it's easier
[30:38] for the lord to get to you when you're
[30:40] young
[30:41] you see but i find today it's
[30:43] interesting that the devil wants to even
[30:45] poison
[30:46] and make young people bitter
[30:50] so he's going for the young ones and to
[30:51] take their innocence and make them
[30:53] bitter towards life and make them
[30:55] i don't have any thrust of life young
[30:56] people are supposed to be thriving and
[30:58] ready
[30:58] and excited about what's next in their
[31:00] life the devil can discourage them and
[31:02] they're not excited about life they
[31:04] still want to want to sit around and
[31:06] mope around and just watch movies all
[31:07] the time and
[31:08] they don't have that but there should be
[31:09] a vibrance in the holy ghost and then
[31:11] serving the lord
[31:12] there should be a vibrance about life
[31:14] that you're excited about the future
[31:16] that's the way it should be but i like
[31:19] working with young people because a lot
[31:20] of times they'll come and they'll
[31:23] they'll attend camps and they'll come
[31:24] things because they don't have all the
[31:26] history
[31:27] of all the separations that are supposed
[31:29] to be and we're not supposed to be with
[31:30] those people we're not supposed to be
[31:32] with those people
[31:33] they just come to the camp because they
[31:34] don't have those past hurts and
[31:36] experiences
[31:37] and they just come we want to be friends
[31:39] in the lord we want to
[31:40] walk we want to hear from the word
[31:42] that's why i hang around young people
[31:46] praise the lord there's something
[31:48] innocent about it something wonderful
[31:49] but you get some of the older ones they
[31:51] really need to die to those old old
[31:53] bitter battles holding on for dear life
[31:58] i'm never going gonna do this and i'm
[31:59] never gonna be around
[32:01] and that i'm leaving that church because
[32:04] i can't stand being around that person
[32:06] in that church i just they drive me
[32:08] crazy i'm sick of them so i'm gonna move
[32:10] to another church
[32:12] and god will have somebody just like
[32:14] that
[32:15] in the new church
[32:19] because why you're a jonah and you've
[32:21] got to be tested
[32:23] with your bitterness your anger and your
[32:25] you know
[32:26] if you move there if you're looking for
[32:29] the perfect church this is not the one i
[32:31] guarantee you
[32:32] this is not it but if you if you're
[32:35] wanting to move to a perfect church
[32:36] don't move there because when you get
[32:38] there it won't be perfect anymore
[32:40] oh did i just say that
[32:44] no perfect church but when there's a
[32:48] pure innocent people humble humble
[32:52] to say we just want to come hear the
[32:55] word be transformed by the holy ghost
[32:57] we just want to serve the lord we don't
[33:00] want politics we don't want drama
[33:02] i find there's a lot of people telling
[33:03] me that just give me a place a safe
[33:05] place to come
[33:06] just to hear the word of god no politics
[33:09] no drama
[33:10] no gossip praise the lord that's the way
[33:13] it should be
[33:15] we discourage that around here don't sit
[33:17] home and chew up people and
[33:18] no just don't do it don't do it let the
[33:21] holy spirit lead our lives
[33:23] somebody needs to be changed pray the
[33:24] holy spirit makes the change in that
[33:26] person
[33:26] that young person wearing something they
[33:28] shouldn't wear pray the holy spirit
[33:29] deals with their heart
[33:31] let the holy spirit lead the church
[33:34] instead of our own minds so this is
[33:37] where
[33:38] he says no he he's supposed to say no
[33:40] and he know what he answers he says
[33:41] yep he says yes you know what i do
[33:44] well to be angry he was so caught up
[33:47] with
[33:47] the way he was and so used to it he said
[33:49] you know what lord i got a right to be
[33:51] angry and if i die angry
[33:53] i will be fine with that he's a pretty
[33:56] bitter guy
[33:58] pretty angry to speak to the lord that
[34:01] way and just say you know what
[34:03] i got a right to be angry and that's
[34:06] just a huge lie you never
[34:10] have a right to stay angry
[34:13] lord said jonah just look at yourself
[34:15] right now look at you right now
[34:17] look what you just said really
[34:20] and then he goes into this jonah you're
[34:23] having pity
[34:24] on a plant that died
[34:29] but no compassion for the ninevites so
[34:32] now he's gonna he's gonna
[34:34] just in the next sentence he's gonna
[34:37] he's gonna help
[34:39] jonah look in a mirror and see just how
[34:42] pitiful he really
[34:43] is because he's putting emphasis on
[34:46] lesser things like the plant like the
[34:49] gourd
[34:50] and he's got so upset that that
[34:53] little plant has died so quickly
[34:57] and he's having such pity and compassion
[35:01] on his plans
[35:10] i was going to say on his dog too but
[35:12] i'm not going to say that because we
[35:14] have too many dog lovers here
[35:21] i don't know what you call this but this
[35:22] is just a strange awkward
[35:24] weird compassion that he had a
[35:27] misdirected compassion
[35:28] i don't know he has his focus on the
[35:31] wrong place
[35:34] i wonder sometimes we have our focus on
[35:36] the wrong thing and we're sweating over
[35:38] little things
[35:39] and we're getting angry over little
[35:41] things that just don't matter at all
[35:44] am i preaching to anybody this morning
[35:46] we're sweating over we're worried over
[35:48] we're getting we're making a big deal
[35:50] out of little issues
[35:52] and and sometimes that's what jonah was
[35:54] doing and so he has a misdirected
[35:56] compassion
[35:57] he has a focus on the wrong place he
[35:59] allows his care
[36:00] and his anger even to be taken up for a
[36:03] plant that died
[36:04] and less concern for souls we never want
[36:07] to be that way we can't grow into the
[36:09] bride of jesus christ and be who we are
[36:11] if we have more concern about life
[36:13] things and little penalties
[36:14] petty things instead of souls we must
[36:17] have a compassion for souls
[36:19] especially now our children's souls can
[36:22] you say that
[36:23] our other brothers and sisters in the
[36:24] church our own children the brothers and
[36:27] sisters the ones that are unsaved the
[36:28] ones who have left the message
[36:30] right now is the time for us to be
[36:32] focused
[36:33] on prayer and compassion
[36:37] for souls at the time of judgment can
[36:39] you say amen at the time of the end in a
[36:41] few weeks i want to get into lord and
[36:43] abraham and abraham praying for a lot
[36:45] because we see lot was making some great
[36:48] crazy decisions too
[36:49] but his only hope was abraham praying
[36:51] for him and crying for him
[36:53] lord would you spare them that's where
[36:56] we're at right now
[36:57] and if we have our focus on something
[36:59] other than it's supposed to be
[37:00] we're going to miss out on opportunities
[37:03] to be used of the lord
[37:04] to show christ love and compassion
[37:09] so interesting brother braham said
[37:11] yesterday he says we're in a time in
[37:13] shalom he says it my what a message
[37:14] we'll get into that more
[37:16] not in this service but another but he
[37:17] says he says we're in a time people are
[37:19] darkened
[37:20] that means they don't understand they
[37:22] don't know what they're doing and he
[37:23] says they're darkened
[37:24] and so you know what he says some people
[37:27] he says we are living epistles written
[37:28] in red of all man
[37:30] some people will never understand god
[37:33] except through you he said that
[37:36] my in other words they're not going to
[37:38] go on social media
[37:40] and understand who god really is they're
[37:43] going to understand a real god that's
[37:45] living in your life
[37:48] they're going to understand a god of the
[37:51] bible and a god that's real but they're
[37:52] going to understand
[37:54] god better not somebody's impersonation
[37:56] of god
[37:57] not some new new jesus that they created
[38:00] do you know in the churches today
[38:02] they've created their own jesus
[38:04] it's not a jesus of the bible but it's
[38:06] the jesus of their whole
[38:08] idol and concoction can you say a man
[38:11] in this this image this is our jesus and
[38:13] and
[38:14] and and he has all that to it and he
[38:16] lets us where we want what we want to
[38:18] wear
[38:18] he lets us cost he lets us smoke our
[38:20] cigarettes and do all these other things
[38:22] and still be a christian
[38:23] they've created their own jesus
[38:26] but i'm here to tell you there's a jesus
[38:28] of the bible
[38:29] and he's still the same yesterday today
[38:31] and forever he's still living today
[38:34] and where he's living is in his people
[38:37] and people will understand the true god
[38:40] through
[38:41] our lives that's how powerful it is
[38:44] that's where we need to be
[38:45] available but so many times we're like
[38:48] jonah that we're so distracted to petty
[38:50] things
[38:52] and uh praise the lord if you've grown
[38:53] beyond that i'm not preaching at you
[38:55] this morning but so many times
[38:57] we're like jonah we allow the care and
[38:59] anger for something little
[39:01] to override how much are we sweating
[39:03] over small stuff
[39:05] that means really nothing jonah
[39:10] jonas oh you poor little helpless
[39:14] little plant you're dying
[39:18] here's all the ninevites he's been
[39:19] watching from the hill and they're all
[39:21] over there repenting he should have
[39:23] he should have been shouting
[39:26] his souls are coming to the lord
[39:29] you've got people sometimes that i don't
[39:31] mean to be this critical but when the
[39:33] spirit's moving that's when you take off
[39:34] and you don't
[39:35] i tell you sometimes you need to stay
[39:37] and pray if you care about souls
[39:39] more than your dinner that's at home
[39:42] with the holy spirit's movement we
[39:43] should stay with that because souls are
[39:45] more important than your dinner
[39:47] souls are more important than your
[39:49] project at home
[39:52] and jonah said oh you poor little
[39:57] he's having pity on this thing it's
[39:59] starting to dry up and die
[40:01] oh this one isn't because it's fake
[40:05] you poor little network
[40:08] it's just i'm really you know what
[40:10] you're upset and i'm going to be upset
[40:12] with you i'm going to be angry with you
[40:14] because i'm good at being angry
[40:17] poor little thing here's all the
[40:18] ninevites over there and he's
[40:21] god points this out he said you're
[40:23] having compassion
[40:24] on a little gourd plant well it was big
[40:28] but
[40:29] you haven't you're having pity on this
[40:32] little
[40:33] plant and then in one night the worm
[40:36] comes up and these getting angry at the
[40:37] wormholes and worms
[40:39] i hate worms i can't stand those worms
[40:41] what do you think yeah you hate worms
[40:43] too i hate worms
[40:46] this is it's all in this realm of being
[40:49] caught up
[40:50] with this plant that died
[40:53] caught up in the wrong thing obsessed
[40:56] with the wrong thing
[41:03] praise the lord when the holy spirit's
[41:05] dealing with us it makes us squirm a
[41:07] little bit
[41:10] your business you should not be obsessed
[41:13] with your business you should not be
[41:16] obsessed
[41:17] with your new truck
[41:22] it's not important more important than
[41:24] souls your soul or someone else's
[41:28] oh i feel such pity for you
[41:32] i can't believe that the worm did that
[41:34] and all this happened and he's so
[41:36] focused on that and just this ivy pled
[41:40] i love you and you've been a victim in
[41:42] all this and i've been a victim and
[41:43] you've been a victim
[41:46] we're victims in all this you've been
[41:49] done wrong you're mad at that worm i'll
[41:50] be mad with you i hate worms
[41:53] you poor little gourd meanwhile no
[41:55] compassion for the souls coming to
[41:57] repentance
[41:59] angry at all the wrong things
[42:02] consume with all the wrong things
[42:08] i probably need to be more specific
[42:14] jonah a dying plant
[42:19] a dying people
[42:23] what's more important
[42:27] a scratch on your truck
[42:31] or a brother you've not forgiven
[42:37] a bad year for your investments
[42:41] or a huge limitless demand for bibles
[42:44] all over the world
[42:46] that they've never had a bible before
[42:51] that's all right that's right
[42:55] somebody bullied you at your school oh
[42:58] somebody bullied you
[43:00] while jesus was mocked by your social
[43:03] media friends and gamers you hang with
[43:07] custap you were bullied
[43:12] your lord was mocked
[43:15] somebody looked at me critically at
[43:17] church i know they looked at me at what
[43:18] i was aware and
[43:19] they were looking so critical
[43:24] and you miss the presence of the lord
[43:27] over and over again
[43:29] because somebody looked at you
[43:30] critically and god says
[43:33] is that really something to get that
[43:35] hyped up about
[43:42] i didn't like my supper last night it
[43:44] just wasn't what i wanted
[43:46] my drink wasn't made right at starbucks
[43:49] i'm mad
[43:50] are you really you're mad because your
[43:54] drink wasn't made right
[43:56] your supper wasn't you complained to
[43:58] your mom or your
[44:00] wife it just wasn't quite what i wanted
[44:02] they didn't make it olive garden they
[44:04] didn't make it like they usually do i
[44:05] met it really
[44:06] god says you're getting mad at this
[44:10] when 811 million people went to bed
[44:14] hungry
[44:14] last night
[44:17] all of us americans we need this
[44:21] to be balanced out
[44:25] my jobs didn't go well this week i'm so
[44:27] angry about it everything did just come
[44:29] together and i couldn't get them all
[44:30] done
[44:30] i couldn't do this
[44:33] and some of your children need salvation
[44:35] right now
[44:37] which is more important my boyfriend
[44:41] broke up with me
[44:44] i'm so angry with the way he did it i
[44:46] need someone really bad
[44:50] seek ye first the kingdom of god and all
[44:53] these things will be added unto you
[44:56] what about the kingdom just obsessed
[44:59] with the boyfriend the boyfriend the boy
[45:00] it's everything and i got hold on for
[45:03] dear life no
[45:04] you don't
[45:07] i'll tell you the thing that you hold on
[45:09] to for dear life
[45:10] the holy ghost the comforter christ
[45:14] that's what you hold on to for your life
[45:21] should we go on
[45:24] i got about 10 amends i need a little
[45:26] bit more than that
[45:30] i can't wait i can't wait until i'm just
[45:33] obsessed with the next avengers segment
[45:36] coming out i can't wait to
[45:37] it
[45:40] i can't wait till the next service
[45:42] wednesday night
[45:44] can you say man i can't wait till the
[45:46] next service
[45:50] you see how we become obsessed with
[45:52] earthly things
[45:54] i don't feel like worshiping today i've
[45:56] had a bad week
[45:57] i'm not going to stand up when the song
[45:59] leader says to stand up i'm not going to
[46:00] sing
[46:01] i just don't feel like moving i'm just
[46:02] going to sit here
[46:04] if i feel like entering in i've had a
[46:07] real bad week you let your emotions
[46:09] control you
[46:12] god let you look at it say all right go
[46:14] right ahead
[46:15] you had a you're mad you had a bad week
[46:18] and over here
[46:18] let everything that hath breath
[46:21] praise the lord bring the sacrifice of
[46:25] praise
[46:26] you override your tiredness every
[46:29] morning when you go to work at
[46:31] eight or seven or six or whenever it is
[46:33] or five in the morning
[46:34] i never had jobs like that to get up at
[46:36] five in the morning i didn't believe
[46:38] there was a five in the morning like
[46:39] there was at night
[46:41] but there is i guess
[46:45] but no matter how tired you are no
[46:48] matter how
[46:48] much a little sniffle you got
[46:52] you're there like clockwork
[46:59] so committed so faithful
[47:02] and yet you haven't read your bible in a
[47:04] week
[47:06] too tired your eyes start to get droopy
[47:10] too tired to come to church
[47:13] i'm not making too many friends here
[47:15] this morning but i think we should look
[47:17] at what jonah was looking at
[47:23] wonder how many will die from this next
[47:25] phase of kovid
[47:31] i say this politely i wonder
[47:35] over here how many souls are dying
[47:36] without god
[47:41] we become angry at this and obsessed
[47:43] with this over here but
[47:44] we can't do this and forget souls
[47:48] jesus said don't fear that one that
[47:50] would destroy the body
[47:52] but fear him who would destroy the soul
[47:55] and the body
[47:57] we're imbalanced and if we're going to
[48:00] be respectful and concerned about
[48:01] something
[48:02] we ought to throw ourselves in with
[48:03] souls because if that soul is saved and
[48:07] filled with the holy spirit
[48:08] if god takes him we know where they're
[48:11] going
[48:18] walmart didn't have what i wanted i went
[48:20] over there and spent the whole day
[48:22] saturday looking for it they didn't have
[48:23] what i wanted
[48:26] this is the bad side by the way
[48:31] spent the whole day there that's why i
[48:33] was so tired sunday morning i couldn't
[48:34] go to church
[48:35] because i spent the whole day at walmart
[48:36] saturday all my energy got used up but
[48:39] after the whole time i couldn't they
[48:41] didn't have what i wanted
[48:43] and maybe there was a soul at walmart
[48:46] that you didn't have time to talk to
[48:50] slow down and say here's somebody who's
[48:52] interacting with me
[48:54] and i could invite them to church i
[48:56] could say something
[48:57] to them and you didn't have time to do
[49:00] it because you got to get what you got
[49:01] to get
[49:02] because you need to get the project done
[49:03] at home i'm telling you friends we've
[49:05] got to change our lives
[49:06] we're not here to just do projects at
[49:08] home
[49:11] i'm preaching to myself and to you our
[49:14] full calling is not to finish
[49:16] projects at home and all the husbands
[49:19] are saying
[49:19] praise the lord i'm glad you told my
[49:20] wife that this morning
[49:25] they're going to remind them this week
[49:26] honey we're not here to do projects at
[49:28] home
[49:31] he's already saying it to his wife right
[49:32] back there he's always already telling
[49:36] we're not here that's not the obsession
[49:40] our business that's not that's not why
[49:41] we're here it's not why god called you
[49:43] to this message
[49:44] it's to be a holy ghost-filled
[49:46] representative to be available anytime
[49:48] for god to use us for his kingdom not
[49:51] your kingdom
[49:52] his kingdom and any money that we make
[49:55] whether it be
[49:56] ten dollars or a million dollars
[49:58] whatever god blesses you to make
[50:01] even that is focused on the kingdom
[50:07] take what you need to live by but you
[50:09] better have a kingdom perspective on
[50:11] what you're making
[50:12] and i'm not taking it off an offering
[50:14] right now that's how a television
[50:15] preacher would do it right there it's
[50:16] time for the offering
[50:18] no no i don't we don't have to do that
[50:19] here we never have to push for money
[50:22] god's taken care of us for 31 years
[50:24] there's no been no pushes anything like
[50:26] that we let the needs be known
[50:27] and god is taking care of us reminders
[50:30] we have
[50:31] but listen i'm not worried about it but
[50:34] your money
[50:36] all of it belongs to god
[50:40] i made it i worked for it well who gave
[50:42] you the strength to work
[50:44] who gave you the strength to work who
[50:46] gave you strength to go to your job
[50:48] god did so all of it everything that we
[50:51] own belongs to him and it has
[50:52] must be related to his kingdom how can i
[50:55] accomplish something for the kingdom
[50:58] whether it be overseas or whether it be
[51:00] in my own home i want to have
[51:02] a kingdom mind in my in my heart i want
[51:05] to think about the kingdom
[51:06] and the reason i have to say these
[51:08] simple things this may be very simple to
[51:10] some maybe you've grown beyond this
[51:11] praise the lord that you're there you're
[51:13] kingdom minded but you have to say it in
[51:15] this laodicean generation
[51:17] because we have so many distractions to
[51:20] put us on
[51:20] petty little things like the plant that
[51:23] we have pity on and we get angry at
[51:26] and forget the kingdom of god forget the
[51:29] salvation of our children
[51:31] forget what's important
[51:35] amen we should be about the kingdom more
[51:38] than anything can you say amen
[51:41] not petty things that will pass away
[51:43] this will all be gone
[51:44] this world is not my home i'm just
[51:48] passing through
[51:50] so there's a powerful part in here in
[51:52] the last verse that we'll get to and
[51:53] bring this to a close now i'm doing good
[51:55] it's only 20 to 1.
[51:56] you're still with me amen so there's
[52:00] just a real powerful part here i want to
[52:01] end on and it's in this last verse
[52:05] and you remember brother ben says i'd
[52:08] like to speak on jonah sometime and
[52:09] break all these things down the eastern
[52:11] wind and all this stuff
[52:12] and he says you even see jesus christ in
[52:14] there and so here at the last verse
[52:17] we see jesus christ in this last verse
[52:20] express
[52:21] and he says and i and should not i spare
[52:24] verse 11
[52:24] should not i spare nineveh that great
[52:27] city where are more than six score
[52:32] thousands
[52:33] persons that cannot discern between
[52:35] their right hand and their left hand
[52:37] and also much cattle here's what brother
[52:40] bram says
[52:41] jesus christ is expressed here we find
[52:43] jesus christ
[52:45] expressed right here i'll reword it so
[52:48] you understand it
[52:50] i'll reword it the way jesus said it at
[52:52] the cross
[52:54] forgive them father they know not what
[52:57] they do
[53:00] so he points to the ninevites and when
[53:02] he says these words
[53:03] six thousand six four thousand persons
[53:05] that cannot discern between their right
[53:07] hand and their left hand what he means
[53:08] by that
[53:09] if you find other scriptures it means
[53:11] that they don't know what they're doing
[53:13] they don't know
[53:14] the sin that they're living in they
[53:15] don't have any knowledge of god or light
[53:18] of god light is knowledge of revelation
[53:20] darkness is lack of revelation lack of
[53:22] knowledge they don't he's trying to get
[53:24] jones to see
[53:25] they don't know what they're doing they
[53:28] need an advocate they need someone to
[53:30] pray for them
[53:31] because what they're doing they have no
[53:33] discernment
[53:34] to know what they're doing we become so
[53:38] critical of people because they know
[53:40] better than doing that
[53:41] they know what they're doing but i'll
[53:43] tell you in a lot of cases in this hour
[53:45] people's minds and thinking becomes numb
[53:49] by social media by movies and everything
[53:51] they become numb spiritually and they're
[53:53] living a life and they don't know what
[53:55] they're
[53:55] doing that's why jesus said it at the
[53:57] cross forgive them father they know not
[54:00] what they do
[54:02] and yet he still forgave them
[54:06] yet he still had compassion on them now
[54:10] this is where we're at friends and this
[54:11] is where we'll take
[54:12] the next service that we have to talk
[54:14] about compassion because to me
[54:16] this brings compassion to a level a
[54:19] deeper level
[54:20] that i'm a little afraid to go to
[54:22] sometimes but it brings compassion
[54:24] to a whole different level is realizing
[54:26] that person we say
[54:27] they know what they're doing they're
[54:29] adamantly doing it they're in rebellion
[54:30] against god
[54:31] sometimes they don't know what they're
[54:33] doing and they need my
[54:35] compassion and my forgiveness and my
[54:38] expression of christ
[54:40] from calvary and you'll see brother
[54:43] bradham deal with this we'll cover it in
[54:45] shalom
[54:46] because he come through a process even
[54:49] while he was preaching the seals
[54:52] of a complex that he said and he got
[54:55] accomplished people weren't listening to
[54:56] him
[54:57] and he developed an attitude towards the
[54:59] rickies and the requettas that were just
[55:01] in rebellion and these ricky's out there
[55:03] and he said god begin to correct him and
[55:06] he come to the scripture in shalom
[55:08] darkness was a isaiah 60. darkness was
[55:12] upon the face of the deep
[55:13] and gross darkness on the people
[55:16] that means lack of understanding
[55:20] of what they're doing they don't know
[55:23] the sin
[55:24] that they're living in now if you can
[55:26] look at it in that light
[55:28] we should be able to really have more
[55:30] compassion
[55:32] instead of they should know what they're
[55:34] doing they grew up in the church and
[55:36] they know better it's easy to say that
[55:38] but sometimes their mind becomes so dark
[55:40] they don't know what they're doing
[55:42] and that's where they need christ to say
[55:45] i forgive you can you say amen i want to
[55:48] be a light to you you're in darkness
[55:50] i'm the light can you say a man i am the
[55:52] light of the world jesus said you i'm
[55:54] the light of the world
[55:55] ye are the light of the world a city
[55:57] that can sit on a hill
[55:58] we are we are carriers of light this
[56:01] morning i'm going to tell you
[56:03] if you've got some darkness in your life
[56:05] i am a carrier of light
[56:07] you're being exposed to light here this
[56:09] morning which means
[56:11] you're hearing the understanding and
[56:13] revelation of god
[56:14] and you know what it's supposed to do
[56:16] pierce the darkness in your life
[56:18] kill the dark drive it away so you can
[56:20] be free
[56:22] i'm a carrier of light i can help you if
[56:25] you let me help you
[56:29] that's why visitors come sometimes and
[56:30] it's just so different for them
[56:33] to come into the presence of the lord
[56:34] wherever they're at in church and feel
[56:35] the presence of the lord
[56:36] it's just so odd and there's so much
[56:38] darkness in their understanding it's so
[56:40] bound
[56:41] that they don't trust it they know
[56:43] something's trying to pierce through
[56:45] and they block up and they walk out that
[56:47] door i just can't do it it's because
[56:49] you're bound up by darkness
[56:51] your former understanding your former
[56:53] teaching
[56:55] but if you trust him the light will
[56:57] shine through
[56:59] he'll drive away the darkness you know
[57:00] why i know that because when he said
[57:02] let there be light at the beginning
[57:04] that's what he did
[57:07] he spoke the first words he said let
[57:09] there
[57:10] be light and when he spoke it
[57:14] the prophet said it took maybe took
[57:16] thousands of years to pray spread over
[57:18] the earth and
[57:19] bring up all the seeds but when he said
[57:21] that to be light that was it
[57:23] and the quicker that he would respond to
[57:25] that light
[57:26] the darkness is all driven driven
[57:29] driven driven back driven back driven
[57:32] back
[57:33] and you come into the light you become a
[57:35] child of the light
[57:38] we enter a whole new level of compassion
[57:40] when we love and seek souls
[57:43] whose understanding has been so darkened
[57:45] that they don't know what they're doing
[57:47] they don't want to be the way that they
[57:50] are
[57:52] i'm quoting from brother branham and
[57:54] shalom they're nice people
[57:57] and many of them don't want to be in
[57:59] that condition
[58:00] but something binds them to it darkness
[58:03] has a way of binding
[58:05] in an understanding that won't let them
[58:07] see revelation
[58:10] we pick up a prophet who introduced us
[58:12] to this because of his own correction
[58:13] from the lord in our
[58:15] in our correcting and i'll mention in
[58:17] the sermons to you
[58:18] that this is expressed through brother
[58:20] branham and you can listen to them
[58:22] through the seals he's dealing with a
[58:24] complex
[58:25] but he comes to the message after the
[58:27] seal standing in the gap and it's in
[58:28] that message he expresses this complex
[58:31] and that's where he expresses i had been
[58:32] critical of the rickeys and raketas
[58:35] and he says i realized lord you died for
[58:37] them
[58:38] i needed to change my attitude towards
[58:40] them
[58:42] oh they're still rickies they're still
[58:45] slickers they're still worldly and some
[58:47] church people turning against the word
[58:51] so so in order for god to change them
[58:54] he said i need to change a different
[58:58] level of compassion
[59:00] it's so easy for us in the message to
[59:02] label somebody's serpent seed
[59:07] we've got so fine-tuned at this and i
[59:10] wouldn't call it fine-tuned
[59:12] it's some other thing than fine tune
[59:13] because it's not fine
[59:15] we got this word we get so sharp with it
[59:18] serpent seed
[59:20] write them off write them off
[59:25] i'm preaching to you a deeper level of
[59:27] compassion
[59:29] if we want to see people changed and we
[59:31] have to change
[59:34] so he expresses it in standing in the
[59:36] gap then he comes to the message humble
[59:38] thyself
[59:39] and he says i just realized i needed a
[59:40] little change in me
[59:43] not that i was sinning or anything he
[59:44] said but i needed a little change in my
[59:46] heart you know what that change was and
[59:47] humble myself
[59:48] he says i've got this terr wrong
[59:50] attitude
[59:51] towards those he said it seems to me if
[59:53] you would preach and say
[59:55] get out of that river you're headed
[59:56] towards the falls get out of that get
[59:58] out of that
[59:59] and you say it that would be enough they
[1:00:01] would get out of the boat
[1:00:02] and take your warning he said but people
[1:00:04] aren't doing it today and he says to me
[1:00:06] if i gave the warning let him go ahead
[1:00:08] and float down the river and i'll just
[1:00:09] go to
[1:00:10] go to someone else and he said god
[1:00:12] corrected me he said i ought to be
[1:00:14] running down the bank
[1:00:17] and continue to reach out and show
[1:00:20] compassion
[1:00:21] and keep trying he's bringing his
[1:00:24] prophet to a different level of
[1:00:25] compassion
[1:00:26] and that's what he's trying to bring
[1:00:27] jonah to
[1:00:30] he comes and he cares do you care he
[1:00:33] cares
[1:00:35] but do you care god can care and love
[1:00:39] all he wants to but do you care
[1:00:43] because some of us get the place we just
[1:00:45] don't care anymore
[1:00:48] it comes to shalom which we'll speak
[1:00:50] over the next few weeks shalom
[1:00:52] such a powerful thing showing darkness
[1:00:57] it's gross upon the people they don't
[1:00:59] know what they're doing
[1:01:01] but light is shining to still
[1:01:05] draw those out of the darkness oh i want
[1:01:08] a powerful message and he comes into
[1:01:10] 65 god who is rich
[1:01:13] in mercy god who's rich in mercy and i'm
[1:01:17] re i'm listing these services
[1:01:19] because this is where he's bringing
[1:01:21] something to us
[1:01:22] in this subject matter and that is we're
[1:01:25] in an hour
[1:01:26] where people need a god who's rich
[1:01:29] rich in mercy can you say amen
[1:01:34] when the times become severe and extreme
[1:01:37] then we need a god who's rich in mercy
[1:01:41] right we don't need a god rich in
[1:01:43] judgment we don't need a god rich
[1:01:44] writing people off we need to get god
[1:01:46] rich in mercy so salvation can really
[1:01:48] come
[1:01:49] don't you ever limit the mercies of god
[1:01:54] then he comes to the last one i'm going
[1:01:55] to mention god's power to transform and
[1:01:57] even in this
[1:01:58] he's trying to say to us no matter how
[1:02:01] dark
[1:02:02] and under the mud in the beginning when
[1:02:04] he said let there be light
[1:02:05] no matter how dark and how much the seed
[1:02:08] was
[1:02:08] buried under the mud no matter how much
[1:02:11] when he said let there be light
[1:02:13] if light pierces that if light touches
[1:02:17] that seed
[1:02:18] there's a power within the seed to come
[1:02:21] out of any darkness that they're in and
[1:02:24] that's why i say don't write somebody
[1:02:25] off because
[1:02:26] you could say some they are so dark in
[1:02:28] their understanding they will
[1:02:30] never see this they will never they are
[1:02:32] so their walls are up so bad
[1:02:34] there's been so mistaught by
[1:02:36] denominational creeds and dogmas
[1:02:38] they'll never see the light of this
[1:02:40] don't you never say that
[1:02:42] because when he said let there be light
[1:02:44] there was a lot of seeds laying in a lot
[1:02:46] of deep mud
[1:02:48] but they had what he taught us is there
[1:02:50] there was power
[1:02:51] within the seed to transform itself and
[1:02:54] begin growing
[1:02:56] if you're a believer here this morning
[1:02:58] and you may not see yourself a believer
[1:02:59] but if you're a seed of god and that
[1:03:01] you've got that part of god in you
[1:03:03] when light shines if you'll receive it
[1:03:05] you'll come out of any darkness that
[1:03:07] you're in
[1:03:08] you'll be washed of any sin that you've
[1:03:09] done you'll be cleaned by the blood of
[1:03:11] the lamb
[1:03:12] you'll set your life free as a son and
[1:03:14] daughter of god
[1:03:16] and your mind that holds it i'll never
[1:03:18] be that i'll never be even that will be
[1:03:20] crafts where god says
[1:03:21] yes you will be a son of god yes you
[1:03:23] will grow in this
[1:03:25] you will be a child of the light but
[1:03:28] you've got to let the light shine and i
[1:03:30] love the fact if you guys want to bring
[1:03:31] that last
[1:03:32] quote up i love the fact that they can
[1:03:34] be in the deepest
[1:03:36] mud and somehow when that light begins
[1:03:38] to shine
[1:03:39] something in the seed begins to spring
[1:03:42] out of the darkness
[1:03:45] praise the lord let's give them worship
[1:03:48] let's give them praise
[1:03:54] you know why it was brother sister
[1:03:56] because somebody we're the light of the
[1:03:58] world
[1:03:58] somebody had the right kind of
[1:04:00] compassion and love and burden
[1:04:02] by compassion it's not tolerance for sin
[1:04:06] but it's true compassion i forgive them
[1:04:09] father
[1:04:09] forgive them they know not they don't
[1:04:11] even know what they're doing
[1:04:13] they can't even think straight right now
[1:04:15] they're not even in their right minds
[1:04:17] how many know people right now
[1:04:18] you know they're not in the right minds
[1:04:21] let me see
[1:04:23] i'm not in my right mind maybe you're
[1:04:24] saying it about yourself but you know
[1:04:26] people there
[1:04:26] they're just the reason that they're not
[1:04:29] coming along is
[1:04:30] they're not even in their right mind
[1:04:32] this age would go totally insane brother
[1:04:34] said insanity is everywhere people can't
[1:04:37] think with sound minds anymore
[1:04:40] but i got an answer i got a man that was
[1:04:44] the maniac of gadirah that was filled
[1:04:46] with all kinds of demons and insane
[1:04:48] in one moment in the presence of jesus
[1:04:51] christ
[1:04:52] he got his mind back he got his mind
[1:04:55] back
[1:04:55] he could think clearly and brother brad
[1:04:57] says he went to his family and for years
[1:05:00] they hadn't seen him because he'd become
[1:05:01] a maniac
[1:05:02] and he was the changed man by being in
[1:05:03] the presence of the lord one time
[1:05:05] come back to his family fully clothed
[1:05:07] because he was naked he was so insane he
[1:05:08] tore his clothes off all these other but
[1:05:10] he
[1:05:10] he was the bible says he was in his
[1:05:12] right mind and fully
[1:05:14] clothed which made brother branham say
[1:05:17] you're not really in your right mind
[1:05:19] until you come to jesus christ
[1:05:22] you can't think clearly and properly
[1:05:26] without jesus christ
[1:05:29] power of transformation now when he said
[1:05:32] let there be light
[1:05:33] maybe there might have been hundreds of
[1:05:36] years maybe 800 years
[1:05:39] before there ever was a light
[1:05:42] but it come to pass because god
[1:05:45] said so i love this part and god
[1:05:49] is going to have a church i don't care
[1:05:51] how many dark ages we go through
[1:05:54] or whatever more god's going to have a
[1:05:56] church
[1:05:58] he is going to have a church can he come
[1:06:01] he is going to have a church without
[1:06:03] spot
[1:06:04] or wrinkle whether we are part of it
[1:06:07] or not because he has already said
[1:06:11] it was going to happen it's going to be
[1:06:14] there so when you talk about gross
[1:06:17] darkness
[1:06:18] upon the people it looks hopeless
[1:06:22] it looks like there won't be any more
[1:06:23] come in it looks like
[1:06:25] people can't find and accept this word
[1:06:28] of the light of the last days
[1:06:30] it looks so dim but he's encouraging us
[1:06:33] he's going to have a church it's going
[1:06:35] to come out of the darkness no matter
[1:06:36] how much darkness it's in
[1:06:37] whether we are part of or not he's going
[1:06:39] to have a church because he has already
[1:06:40] said
[1:06:41] it was going to happen it's going to be
[1:06:43] there
[1:06:44] you look at after two thousand years and
[1:06:46] they go through the dark ages like they
[1:06:48] did in the church ages
[1:06:49] went through deep dark times and then
[1:06:51] light becomes to come up in luther
[1:06:53] wesley and pentecost and then the full
[1:06:56] light of the opening of the seals
[1:06:58] full revelation understanding expressed
[1:07:00] in this last days
[1:07:02] we live in an exciting time friends
[1:07:05] and that that light just burst forth but
[1:07:08] we are livers of that light we are
[1:07:10] carriers of that light
[1:07:12] you need to hold the confidence and the
[1:07:13] compassion
[1:07:15] in your heart that there's no person
[1:07:18] under the deepest darkness that the
[1:07:20] light
[1:07:21] can't pierce through this is a powerful
[1:07:24] light
[1:07:25] this isn't head knowledge and just a
[1:07:27] bunch of books and tapes and
[1:07:28] cds and on our shelves this is light
[1:07:32] and he gave us that light to shine
[1:07:35] upon others jonah was having to learn
[1:07:40] your compassion is for some little plant
[1:07:44] but you need to redirect your compassion
[1:07:47] needs to be for souls
[1:07:50] not the little petty things of life i
[1:07:52] know i've been corrected this morning so
[1:07:54] i ask you
[1:07:55] have you been corrected a little bit
[1:07:56] this morning lord help us
[1:07:58] if we're lacking in compassion for souls
[1:08:02] move us with compassion instead of the
[1:08:06] petty things of life
[1:08:08] do your responsibilities don't leave
[1:08:09] your job
[1:08:11] if you if you want to leave your job and
[1:08:14] go overseas
[1:08:16] say i'm just going to go serve the
[1:08:17] kingdom if god calls you to do that and
[1:08:19] you leave the job
[1:08:20] you better make sure god's called you
[1:08:21] that's all i can say but if you want to
[1:08:23] do it
[1:08:24] come and let me know because i'll send
[1:08:26] you instead of me going overseas
[1:08:29] i don't want to go i i just like being
[1:08:31] home if you want to do it but i'm not
[1:08:33] telling you to leave your jobs i'm
[1:08:34] saying take the kingdom to your job
[1:08:37] you're there at that job you think
[1:08:40] you're there for your salary
[1:08:43] you think you're there to make money and
[1:08:45] move up the ladder
[1:08:46] you're there to be a son of god and
[1:08:49] serve his kingdom and be available to be
[1:08:51] a witness
[1:08:53] your business no matter how blessed it
[1:08:56] is
[1:08:56] first and foremost has been given to you
[1:08:59] to somehow serve the kingdom of god
[1:09:02] everything we do is for the kingdom
[1:09:04] that's what jonah needed to learn
[1:09:06] it's not about your little ups and downs
[1:09:08] and your plants dying
[1:09:11] your flowers dying whatever you that's
[1:09:13] not
[1:09:15] you may hurt a little bit but don't get
[1:09:16] angry at that and not get angry
[1:09:19] at the souls that are dying
[1:09:22] that's what you need to be obsessive
[1:09:24] about
[1:09:26] lord please move me with
[1:09:32] compassion for
[1:09:35] the lost i pray
