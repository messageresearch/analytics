[20:11] more important in life we're going to
[20:12] have Gideon come back and uh have some
[20:15] specials here by Brother Jack and them
[20:18] and uh I just wanted to say that the
[20:20] future is looking bright and this year
[20:23] because of the grace of God I believe
[20:26] there's good things in store and we
[20:28] should be positive can you say amen God
[20:30] bless the offering this morning as well
[20:32] as they take it up may God just multiply
[20:35] it this
[20:36] morning we were my mom and I I picked my
[20:39] mom up this morning we went through Tim
[20:40] Horton's which is kind of a tradition
[20:43] with us uh and we picked up a coffee and
[20:46] the lady uh that was taking our order
[20:47] was so chipper and so positive and so
[20:51] she was just going on I said you have a
[20:53] super duper year and all these big words
[20:55] I said isn't it nice to hear somebody
[20:57] positive in this world and if anybody
[21:00] needs to be positive it's the Bride of
[21:02] Jesus Christ we don't need to be
[21:04] depressed we're too blessed to be
[21:06] depressed we're too anointed to be
[21:08] disappointed there's too many good
[21:10] things that God is doing and will do
[21:12] that we should be the most excited
[21:14] people on the face of the Earth don't
[21:16] let that Spirit of depression come
[21:17] around you I pray the Lord would just
[21:19] drive it away and how many you raise
[21:21] your hand and say let me not live in any
[21:22] depression this year let me live in the
[21:24] glories of God amen amen praise the Lord
[21:28] we believe that God will do it I did
[21:30] want to say once again about the retreat
[21:32] we uh just had 3 days up there in Grass
[21:34] Lake Michigan and it was such a joy to
[21:37] see such a gathering of young people and
[21:40] some of you are here this morning but it
[21:42] was such a good turnout I think we had
[21:43] about 160 165 and they came from 17
[21:47] different states and four different
[21:49] countries this is the whole group here
[21:52] oh that was too quick go back about 17
[21:55] different states and four different
[21:56] countries we had one from uh are you the
[21:59] boy from Spain but he's in Connecticut
[22:01] now brother from Spain uh a a girl from
[22:06] Ecuador she lives in Toronto now a
[22:08] couple two or three from London England
[22:11] and uh then all of our 17 States
[22:13] represented there and although we had
[22:15] rain all week um we just had rains of
[22:19] the Holy Spirit too and it was just such
[22:20] a super time in the Lord and the themes
[22:23] this week for the young people were just
[22:26] to summarize that the pre teaching was
[22:28] to encourage them that they have a
[22:30] purpose in their life God has a Divine
[22:33] Purpose for their life and not only that
[22:35] do they have a purpose and a design and
[22:37] a blueprint but they need to be
[22:39] confident in what God is leading them to
[22:42] do they need to be confident in their
[22:44] position and they need to be confident
[22:47] in what they do and they need to be
[22:48] confident that God has uniquely made
[22:50] them to do something and their
[22:52] personality and they need to be
[22:54] confident in how they worship don't
[22:56] worship like somebody else
[22:58] I think there was a real piece that set
[23:00] it over the young people that don't try
[23:01] to copy somebody else's worship and
[23:03] think I must not be okay cuz I'm not
[23:05] worshiping like that next person don't
[23:07] do that be confident in how God leads
[23:09] you to worship can I have an amen this
[23:12] morning and so I think that's a
[23:14] wonderful thing oh that's my friend and
[23:16] brother brother Barry coffee who helps
[23:18] us do it and uh so we just had a
[23:21] wonderful time I know there's just a few
[23:24] pictures and um but God really moved in
[23:27] each service and I just want to see a
[23:29] few images of that this morning let you
[23:31] see it that we give glory to almighty
[23:33] God young people 17 and up and looking
[23:35] and hungry for more of the word of God
[23:37] and to grow in Grace and knowledge of
[23:39] Jesus Christ and that is a real
[23:41] encouragement it puts fire under me to
[23:43] see in our generation the kind of young
[23:45] people that we have so Bound by the
[23:47] things of the world and to see young
[23:49] people set free to serve the Lord and uh
[23:51] there the new generation every
[23:53] generation has its Revival every
[23:55] generation God promised a Revival to the
[23:57] new generation and I believe that's
[23:59] happen I believe there's a mighty Army
[24:00] raising up there's a mighty Army to
[24:04] finish this work and I was so privileged
[24:06] to be a part of that this week and see
[24:08] that praise the Lord I want to uh let
[24:11] the local church here know that next

[49:20] little bit from The Book of Luke amen
[49:26] The Book of
[49:28] Luke and
[49:32] um very familiar
[49:35] passage uh that we're we should all be
[49:38] very aware of and and and um talks about
[49:42] the birth of our Lord and our
[49:45] savior here in the Book of Luke
[49:52] 2:8 it says and there were in the same
[49:54] country sh shepherds abiding in the
[49:56] field keeping watch over their flock By
[50:00] Night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[50:02] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[50:05] round about them and they were sore
[50:07] afraid the angel said unto them fear not
[50:10] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[50:13] great joy which shall be to all people
[50:17] for unto you is Born This Day in the
[50:18] city of David a savior which is Christ
[50:22] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[50:26] you ye shall find a bab wrapped in
[50:28] swaddling clothes lying in a
[50:30] manger and suddenly there was with the
[50:33] angel multitude of the Heavenly hosts
[50:36] praising God and saying glory to God in
[50:40] the highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[50:42] toward men and it came to pass as the
[50:46] Angels were gone away from them into
[50:48] heaven the Shepherds said one to another
[50:51] let us now uh even I mean go even unto
[50:55] to Bethlehem and see this thing which is
[50:57] come to pass which the Lord ha made
[51:00] known unto
[51:02] us I I like just the the wording uh
[51:06] there uh these Shepherds that went to
[51:10] find the Christ child uh it was God that
[51:13] made it known to them and the way that
[51:17] he made it known to them is he sent them
[51:21] an
[51:22] angel praise the Lord amen there are
[51:26] certain things that we
[51:28] know and we would not know them if God
[51:33] had not sent
[51:35] us an
[51:37] angel a seventh
[51:41] angel Hallelujah and they came with
[51:44] haste and found Mary and Joseph and the
[51:46] Babe lying in a manger and when they had
[51:49] seen it they made known abroad the
[51:52] saying which was told them concerning
[51:53] his child and and all they that heard it
[51:57] wandered at those things which were told
[51:59] them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all
[52:02] of the things all these things and
[52:04] pondered them in her heart and the
[52:06] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[52:09] praising God for all the things that
[52:12] they had heard and seen as it was told
[52:16] unto them amen the Lord had a blessing
[52:18] to the reading of his word you can be
[52:20] seated um forgot to mention I do bring
[52:23] you greetings from our home Church there
[52:26] in West Palm Beach Florida spirit and
[52:28] Truth Tabernacle I'm happy to have my
[52:31] wife sister Erica along with me and uh
[52:34] my daughter uh Sarah who sang amen they
[52:37] they come there but my my son-in-law and
[52:39] my daughter drove over from uh Indiana

[52:45] and sister Rebecca amen we appreciate
[52:47] them amen this just a a portion of my
[52:50] family I got another daughter and
[52:52] son-in-law and two grandchildren back
[52:53] home in West Palm Beach so
[52:55] uh but we're happy to be here amen and
[52:58] and just uh finishing off the year amen
[53:01] here in Michigan God is good God is good
[53:06] I um I want to just talk on the subject
[53:09] of of worship amen uh on today we've
[53:12] been hearing a lot about that uh over
[53:14] the last couple days and uh just a
[53:17] really simple simple topic uh on on
[53:20] worship and uh but you know just a
[53:23] little uh little I guess underlying
[53:26] theme here in this topic is that we're
[53:29] worshiping based upon what we've seen
[53:32] and what we've heard amen based it's
[53:35] based upon what we have seen and what we
[53:38] have heard now the word worship means to
[53:42] reverence or render homage with body and
[53:47] mind amen and uh I'm I'm looking at this
[53:51] this uh definition from a um a little
[53:55] book that I have called key to the Bible
[53:57] and they they put Genesis 225 in there
[54:00] as a reference to this this definition
[54:02] reverence or render homage with body and
[54:04] mind and we'll we'll get to Genesis 225
[54:07] in a little bit but uh one thing I I'll
[54:11] let me just go a little further here
[54:12] before I say that the anger Bible
[54:14] dictionary uh takes this worship word in
[54:17] Hebrew and the Hebrew word for it is
[54:20] shaha shaha it means to bow down or
[54:24] prostrate oneself before another in
[54:27] order to do him honor and reverence now
[54:31] and uh they refer to Psalms 95 and six
[54:34] we'll come to that in a second but let
[54:35] me just add this little thing here
[54:38] sometimes there is a joke amongst people
[54:40] today where they will come in contact
[54:43] with someone uh maybe a a famous status
[54:47] and then you have all these people that
[54:48] are just kind
[54:51] of y'all seen that I guess right am amen
[54:55] hopefully you're not doing that amen
[54:58] you've seen it but don't do that because
[55:00] our worship if we're going to bow down
[55:02] to anybody it's not going to be to
[55:04] another man it's not going to be to
[55:06] another woman the only person that gets
[55:08] our Glory that gets our worship that
[55:10] gets our praise is the Lord Jesus
[55:14] Christ hallelujah amen but this this
[55:17] this you know uh this this this word uh
[55:20] Shaha in Hebrew that's worship is to bow
[55:23] down and prostrate oneself before
[55:25] another in order to do him honor and
[55:28] reverence and they made a statement here
[55:30] in the anger Bible dictionary says it is
[55:32] as natural to worship as it is to
[55:38] live it is as natural to worship as it
[55:42] is to live all right let's go on a
[55:46] little further uh the the the feeling
[55:48] and expression of high adoration
[55:50] reverence trust love loyalty and
[55:54] dependence upon on a higher power human
[55:56] or Divine is a necessity to man that is
[55:59] a part of the anger uh Bible dictionary
[56:02] definition brother brandom makes a I I
[56:05] like his definition on worship it says
[56:07] to worship is to express yourself to him
[56:12] oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[56:15] now uh I can't worship through
[56:18] you you can't worship through me amen
[56:23] but each one of us have to learn how
[56:25] express ourselves to
[56:28] him hey blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:31] now here you know um I I heard this
[56:34] statement worship is a
[56:36] verb and what that means worship does
[56:39] require
[56:41] action and I know we all worship
[56:43] differently nothing wrong with that
[56:45] don't don't get me wrong but it does
[56:47] require action right and and I'm going
[56:50] to read a couple scriptures that that
[56:51] help us understand what worship is I I
[56:54] want you to want you to realize it is an
[56:56] expression of yourself to the Lord Jesus
[56:59] if he's done anything worthy of your
[57:03] glory and worthy of your honor you ought
[57:05] to express that to him hallelujah amen
[57:09] you know uh many of you all during this
[57:11] season you probably got gifts and all
[57:13] that and you express your thanks
[57:17] hopefully am man you didn't just get a
[57:20] gift and then just look at the
[57:23] person
[57:25] no you you open your mouth with an
[57:28] expression of thank you Hallelujah and
[57:32] if the Lord Jesus has given you anything
[57:35] amen he's given you health he's given
[57:37] you strength he's given you a job he's
[57:40] given you a car amen he's put money in
[57:42] you in the bank he's giv you all these
[57:44] things you can at least come to church
[57:46] and
[57:48] say thank you Jesus everybody ought to
[57:51] be able to express something to the Lord
[57:54] let's let's let's let's let's let's read
[57:55] this uh worship is a verb that requires
[57:58] action and worship does require your
[58:02] participation all right here in Psalms
[58:04] 956 it says oh come let us worship and
[58:09] bow down amen let us kneel before the
[58:14] Lord our maker he deserves that amen
[58:18] another scripture here in in Psalms 100
[58:21] and verse 1-5 it says and and and I and
[58:24] like this I I I like I like this song I
[58:27] mean this Psalm here because uh you know
[58:30] one of the uh one of the other things
[58:32] that uh actually let me go to Psalms 981
[58:35] first before I say that Psalms 981 it
[58:37] says oh
[58:40] sing amen oh sing unto the Lord
[58:47] hallelujah for he ha done marvelous
[58:50] things his right hand and His holy arm
[58:53] have gotten him the Victory and and when
[58:55] we sing unto the Lord we don't sing like
[59:05] this that's not singing if you bought a
[59:08] CD if brother Paul said I got a new CD
[59:12] out and you uh and you went and you
[59:14] bought Brother Paul's CD but on the on
[59:16] on the CD all you heard was music but he
[59:19] says I got a new CD and I'm singing to
[59:21] the Lord but all you heard was music
[59:22] it's not singing if you don't hear the
[59:24] voice being
[59:26] projected hello somebody the Bible
[59:29] declares that we should sing unto the
[59:31] Lord amen so so so if a person just kind
[59:34] of gives you just uh if brother Paul
[59:36] says I got a new CD but he never sings
[59:38] That's not a a music CD that's an
[59:41] instrumental that's all that is that's
[59:43] an instrumental and it's okay for the
[59:45] the the musicians to to Worship the Lord
[59:47] on the instruments but when we sing we
[59:49] open our mouths and we say something to
[59:52] God and you can't even use the excuse
[59:55] that I don't know the words brother Jack
[59:56] so I can't sing they put the
[1:00:00] words on the
[1:00:02] screen and all you have to do is open
[1:00:05] your mouth and sing and then you might
[1:00:07] say well I don't really like the way I
[1:00:11] sound and somebody else is going to
[1:00:14] maybe pick at me when they hear me sing
[1:00:16] well this is the next scripture that
[1:00:18] sets you free from that Psalms
[1:00:23] 100
[1:00:27] it says
[1:00:28] Make a
[1:00:30] Joyful Noise and look look it has to be
[1:00:34] joyful you can't you can't come with a
[1:00:36] sad count you got to make it joyful to
[1:00:39] God make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[1:00:43] All Ye Lands serve the Lord with
[1:00:46] gladness come before his presence
[1:00:50] with everybody ought to be ready to open
[1:00:53] their mouths when they come into the
[1:00:54] house of the Lord You're not holier than
[1:00:56] the next brother when you
[1:00:59] just that doesn't make you
[1:01:02] holy amen singing is what God wants to
[1:01:05] hear and even if it's just a noise God
[1:01:07] wants to hear your noise your neighbor
[1:01:11] might not want to hear but let your
[1:01:12] neighbor know I'm not singing for
[1:01:14] you I'm not singing to you but this is
[1:01:18] my Joyful Noise unto God for all he has
[1:01:21] done for me I come before his presence
[1:01:24] with
[1:01:26] singing know ye that the Lord he is God
[1:01:29] it is he that hath made us and not we
[1:01:31] ourselves we are his people in the Sheep
[1:01:33] of his pasture enter into his gates with
[1:01:36] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[1:01:38] praise be thankful unto him and bless
[1:01:40] his name for the Lord is good his Mercy
[1:01:43] is Everlasting his truth endureth to all
[1:01:45] generations from the reading of that
[1:01:47] scripture we see worship is done with an
[1:01:50] attitude of
[1:01:53] gratitude amen we come before the Lord's
[1:01:56] presence we singing we come with
[1:01:59] gladness we we we enter his gates with
[1:02:03] Thanksgiving Hallelujah and and and
[1:02:05] sometimes we come into the house of the
[1:02:06] Lord and it's hard to lift our hands
[1:02:09] sometimes it's hard to open our mouth
[1:02:10] because of some of the things that we're
[1:02:11] going through but we have to learn how
[1:02:12] to separate amen what we're going
[1:02:14] through and the god that we're serving I
[1:02:17] I I'm I'm a living witness that when you
[1:02:19] enter into worship and you begin to
[1:02:21] praise God uh sometimes your whole
[1:02:23] outlook begins a change on on what
[1:02:25] you're going through and and even there
[1:02:27] you might get a little inspiration that
[1:02:29] you might feel like hey I can make it
[1:02:31] through this thing I know the devil has
[1:02:33] me bombarded but I feel like I can
[1:02:35] overcome this I've seen people get
[1:02:37] healed in
[1:02:41] worship you know I shared the testimony
[1:02:44] a few times but we were a sister was
[1:02:47] streaming our service and um she was
[1:02:50] going through something and her her son
[1:02:52] was there dealing with cancer
[1:02:55] and uh and then all of a sudden this
[1:02:56] lady uh this sister she begin to develop
[1:02:58] a growth in her nose while her son is
[1:03:00] going through these chemo treatments and
[1:03:02] and uh and as she got this growth in the
[1:03:04] nose she went to the doctor and says I
[1:03:05] don't know what to do I don't know where
[1:03:06] this came from he says well we're going
[1:03:08] to have to do surgery in order to take
[1:03:09] care of that she's like I cannot go
[1:03:11] through surgery while my son is going
[1:03:13] through this I I I'm just going to have
[1:03:15] to endure what I'm going through and
[1:03:17] wait till he gets better before I would
[1:03:19] try to go to surgery because how am I
[1:03:21] going to take care of him if I'm trying
[1:03:22] to recover well well you know she she
[1:03:25] decided not to do the surgery at the
[1:03:27] time but she was at home and and uh and
[1:03:29] while she was at home streaming the
[1:03:31] service she started sweeping while she
[1:03:34] was streaming the service and when she
[1:03:36] when she start sweeping the dust begin
[1:03:38] to create a a little issue and caus her
[1:03:41] to sneeze so she sneezed uh really hard
[1:03:44] and and then it kind of Cs a second
[1:03:46] sneeze and when she sneezed the second
[1:03:48] time this thing whatever was in her nose
[1:03:50] came flying out the
[1:03:51] nose and she uh she says wow uh she says
[1:03:56] you know I'm breathing much better I
[1:03:58] think that that that thing is gone it's
[1:04:00] gone and and and she was in the in the
[1:04:02] house just just just just just
[1:04:03] worshiping your goodness is running
[1:04:06] after it's running after me that's
[1:04:09] that's what she was worshiping your
[1:04:10] goodness is running and I I mean in the
[1:04:13] midst of her worship God's goodness
[1:04:15] caught up with her and brought healing
[1:04:17] to her body nobody laid hands on her
[1:04:20] nobody prayed for her but she received
[1:04:23] her healing through her worship I want
[1:04:25] to tell you that's how powerful worship
[1:04:27] is this morning when you can come into
[1:04:30] God's presence with amen a Heart of
[1:04:32] Worship he can do great things for
[1:04:36] you she went to the doctor and the
[1:04:38] doctor said hey you know what happened
[1:04:39] she says uh you know I was sweeping and
[1:04:42] you know and this thing came flying out
[1:04:44] he says look is there any other anything
[1:04:46] in there you think you still need to do
[1:04:47] surgery look like we don't need to do
[1:04:50] surgery and uh the nurse said wow that
[1:04:52] must have been some sneeze
[1:04:56] and the sister said no no no no no that
[1:04:58] was some
[1:05:00] God this is what happens when you begin
[1:05:02] to worship when you worship with the
[1:05:05] right attitude amen here amen the other
[1:05:09] thing that the Bible tells us in Psalms
[1:05:11] 150 it says let
[1:05:14] everything that have
[1:05:16] breath praise the Lord so so so so so
[1:05:20] every Everybody when we come into the
[1:05:22] house of the Lord amen it's our
[1:05:25] expression to him you might not sing as
[1:05:27] loud as the other person my my wife is
[1:05:30] able to kind of discern who the song
[1:05:31] leaders are in the
[1:05:34] audience because what song leaders do
[1:05:36] while another song leaders up here
[1:05:37] singing they're doing all the ad lib in
[1:05:40] the audience that brother's a song
[1:05:43] leader that she can identify them just
[1:05:45] because that's what we do musicians do
[1:05:47] those things but we all Express express
[1:05:50] ourselves to God in different ways it
[1:05:52] doesn't matter how we do it it just as
[1:05:54] long as we we do it that's
[1:05:57] right here there was um a gentleman by
[1:06:02] the name of John Francis Wade and if you
[1:06:05] all have the the lyrics to this song Go
[1:06:07] come all you Faithful just pull those up
[1:06:09] for me I just want to tell the story
[1:06:11] about him John Francis
[1:06:13] Wade he um
[1:06:18] lived I believe in the 18th century
[1:06:21] there and he um he he wrote a song and
[1:06:25] the way he wrote this song he he made
[1:06:27] his living by copying manuscripts by
[1:06:29] hand and became famous for his artistic
[1:06:32] calligraphy he had an act for copying
[1:06:34] music as well and and they said Scholars
[1:06:37] debated whether Wade merely copied this
[1:06:39] Christmas hymn uh or whether he actually
[1:06:42] wrote it but recent Scholars indicate
[1:06:44] that he did in fact write the hymn now
[1:06:47] this man wrote this hymn and originally
[1:06:49] when it was written in Latin it was
[1:06:51] called adeste
[1:06:52] Fidelis and and Wade was a Roman
[1:06:55] Catholic and all services in the church
[1:06:57] were conducted in Latin Oh My My My amen
[1:07:01] uh in 1750 He Slipped this hymn into a
[1:07:05] manuscript he was copying for the
[1:07:07] English Roman Catholic college right in
[1:07:10] liis Buon Portugal over 30 years later
[1:07:13] so this man wrote the
[1:07:15] hym took the hym and slipped it into a
[1:07:18] manuscript 30 years later somebody found
[1:07:21] this and uh and they began to sing it in
[1:07:24] a in a Portuguese Chapel in in London
[1:07:27] and the Duke of Lees heard it sung there
[1:07:29] and included in the repertoire of his
[1:07:31] own singing group it soon became known
[1:07:33] all around the world and even today we
[1:07:36] still sing this
[1:07:38] song right and the the lyrics of the
[1:07:41] song says Oh Come are Ye Faithful joyful
[1:07:45] and triumphant Oh Come Ye Oh Come Ye to
[1:07:49] Bethlehem come and Behold Him born the
[1:07:53] king of angels and it says oh come let
[1:07:56] us adore him that means let's worship
[1:08:00] him oh come let us adore him oh come let
[1:08:05] us adore him
[1:08:09] Christ the lord yes that's what we come
[1:08:13] to do when we come to church we come to
[1:08:15] adore him and and then he wrote a second
[1:08:17] verse it says
[1:08:19] Sing choirs of angels and and now when
[1:08:24] we look at the scripture that we just
[1:08:25] read here in in in Luke Chapter 2 we
[1:08:27] realize it was the angels that began to
[1:08:30] sing at the birth of our Lord and Savior
[1:08:32] Jesus Christ brother brandom told us
[1:08:34] that when a king was born people would
[1:08:36] always sing Hallelujah but there was no
[1:08:39] earthly people there to sing when Christ
[1:08:42] was born but the Angels joined in after
[1:08:46] the message was given to the Shepherds
[1:08:48] the Angels joined in and they began to
[1:08:50] sing about our
[1:08:52] savior oh if if he he's that important
[1:08:54] that Angels would sing We ought to come
[1:08:57] to the house of God ready to
[1:09:01] sing sing choirs of Angels sing in
[1:09:06] exaltation oh sing All Ye citizens of
[1:09:09] Heaven above glory to God all glory in
[1:09:13] the highest oh come let us adore him oh
[1:09:17] come let us adore him oh come let us
[1:09:21] adore him cry
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:25] the
[1:09:26] Lord he goes with the third
[1:09:29] verse and I have to change just one word
[1:09:31] in this verse because I think he had
[1:09:33] just one thing off it says yes Lord we
[1:09:36] greet thee born this happy morning Jesus
[1:09:41] was not born on December 25th he was
[1:09:43] born Amen in the springtime right but we
[1:09:47] say born a happy morning all right Jesus
[1:09:52] to thee be all glory given but he did
[1:09:54] have something really remarkable in this
[1:09:56] verse look at this word of the
[1:10:01] father word of the father he he he sees
[1:10:05] Jesus as the word we see him the same
[1:10:07] way word of the father not only that
[1:10:12] now in flesh appearing and my question
[1:10:16] is who's flesh is he appearing
[1:10:21] in come on now he's appearing in your
[1:10:24] flesh he's appearing in my flesh amen
[1:10:27] now in flesh appearing oh come let us
[1:10:30] adore
[1:10:32] him come let us adore him oh come let us
[1:10:37] adore
[1:10:38] him
[1:10:42] Christ when you realize that he's
[1:10:45] appearing in your flesh when he's going
[1:10:48] beyond your faults and he's going beyond
[1:10:50] your mistakes he's going beyond all that
[1:10:52] and he's still appearing in your flesh
[1:10:54] you have something to worship him
[1:11:00] for brother Brandon makes a statement in
[1:11:02] the message the uncertain
[1:11:05] sound he says now notice in the human
[1:11:08] body or makeup our regular Anatomy that
[1:11:13] we live in here is not made to sin he
[1:11:16] says it's made to do righteous it's made
[1:11:19] to serve God it says God never made you
[1:11:23] just to work and come home and love your
[1:11:26] children all those are good things he
[1:11:28] said but God didn't just make you simply
[1:11:30] for that he says now that's all good
[1:11:32] enough God made you to work God made you
[1:11:35] to come home love your children love
[1:11:37] your wife the wife be loyal to and and
[1:11:39] love her husband the children love their
[1:11:41] father and mother that's all good he
[1:11:44] says but that is just
[1:11:46] background oh my amen loving your your
[1:11:50] family loving your wife loving your
[1:11:52] children amen going going to work paying
[1:11:54] the bills all of those things are just
[1:11:57] background amen amen uh for something
[1:12:00] that God made you to do all of that is
[1:12:03] background for something that God made
[1:12:04] you to do he says God made you to be a
[1:12:08] worshipper a worshipper of him you
[1:12:11] worship something regardless of what it
[1:12:15] is you worship your wife you worship
[1:12:17] your children you worship anything your
[1:12:19] autom you worship your pleasures you
[1:12:21] worship something because it's in
[1:12:23] mankind to worship now we want to know
[1:12:26] what we
[1:12:28] worship and we've seen this people
[1:12:30] worship their careers over God I mean
[1:12:32] it's always the job comes first before
[1:12:35] church we worship our careers sometimes
[1:12:37] we have family members that love to show
[1:12:40] up on the day that church right at the
[1:12:42] time church is going to start or I need
[1:12:43] to leave to get ready to go to church
[1:12:45] that's when they show up to visit and
[1:12:48] rather than you tell them I'm on my way
[1:12:49] to church would you like to go with
[1:12:51] me rather than say that you say well I I
[1:12:55] got caught up tonight I'm going have to
[1:12:56] stay home with the with the family
[1:12:58] you're
[1:12:59] worshiping your
[1:13:00] family you put your family before God
[1:13:04] Amen Church brother randam say you'll
[1:13:07] worship something we want to make sure
[1:13:08] that our worship is pointed in the right
[1:13:09] direction all of our worship goes to
[1:13:12] Christ let me go a little further with
[1:13:14] this he goes on he says Jesus told the
[1:13:16] woman at the well said you worship you
[1:13:19] know not what we Jews we worship we know
[1:13:21] what we know that we worship God because
[1:13:23] salvations of the Jew now and then the
[1:13:25] woman began to explain to him how once
[1:13:27] said in the mountain once at Jerusalem
[1:13:29] he said the hour is coming and now is
[1:13:31] when the father will seek worshippers
[1:13:32] who will worship Him in spirit and in
[1:13:34] truth for God is a spirit and they that
[1:13:36] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[1:13:40] and
[1:13:43] Truth mandatory that if we're going to
[1:13:46] worship we have to Worship in spirit and
[1:13:49] in truth now I
[1:13:51] um I like to to just say it like this
[1:13:55] when Jesus told this woman at the well
[1:13:58] that the father was looking for
[1:13:59] something to Worship in spirit and Truth
[1:14:01] worship was not related to a physical
[1:14:05] place it wasn't in the mountains of
[1:14:08] Samaria or in Jerusalem worship was
[1:14:10] found in spirit and truth and and and my
[1:14:13] question is where is Spirit and Truth
[1:14:17] now that's the name of my church and I'm
[1:14:18] not here saying you got to come to West
[1:14:20] Palm Beach to worship I'm not saying
[1:14:22] that that would be incorrect correct
[1:14:24] Worship in spirit and Truth is not a
[1:14:26] physical
[1:14:27] place but it is a spiritual place that
[1:14:30] you can only find in
[1:14:33] Christ but this is where God is
[1:14:35] accepting our worship it's it's found in
[1:14:39] spirit and Truth Now the children of
[1:14:43] Israel amen they worshiped a golden calf
[1:14:46] and that was not accepted God wasn't
[1:14:48] looking for that uh they they worship
[1:14:51] baale at one time and had to be restored
[1:14:52] back to the world worship of the one and
[1:14:54] true Living God God was not looking for
[1:14:56] them to worship B God wanted to worship
[1:14:58] himself right Cain's worship was not
[1:15:01] accepted you want to be sure that
[1:15:03] whatever you're giving God that it is
[1:15:05] being accepted Cain worship but it was
[1:15:07] not being accepted balam's altars were
[1:15:10] not accepted Dayan even built a
[1:15:14] church he says Moses you're not the only
[1:15:17] one that God is speaking to he's
[1:15:18] speaking to us too so uh Dayan built a
[1:15:21] tabernacle and and his Tabernacle got
[1:15:23] swallowed up in the earth God has a
[1:15:26] specific way that he wants us to worship
[1:15:28] that worship has to be in spirit and in
[1:15:32] truth look at this let's go a little
[1:15:37] further Adam and Eve would Worship in
[1:15:39] the cool of the
[1:15:40] evening Cain and Abel offered their
[1:15:43] sacrifices to worship God Abel's
[1:15:46] offerings were accepted but canes was
[1:15:48] rejected brother brandom says this and
[1:15:50] show us the father and it suffice says
[1:15:52] look in the beginning when C and Abel
[1:15:53] were returned from the garden their
[1:15:56] parents and they both seen that they
[1:15:57] were mortal beings and knowing they had
[1:15:59] to die Cain and Abel both of them wanted
[1:16:02] to worship God and Cain he built an
[1:16:04] altar to God now if an altar is all that
[1:16:07] God requires Cain was
[1:16:10] justified and Cain made a sacrifice upon
[1:16:13] the altar is that right well if a
[1:16:15] sacrifice and an altar is all God wants
[1:16:18] Cain was justified then Cain also he
[1:16:20] built an altar and he worshiped he put a
[1:16:22] sacrifice on it he he knelt down and
[1:16:24] worshiped God but God was displeased
[1:16:26] because he didn't come the right way and
[1:16:29] there's many churches today that are not
[1:16:31] coming the right way God wants Worship
[1:16:35] in spirit and in truth and let me just
[1:16:39] add
[1:16:40] this people that believe this
[1:16:43] message are people that are coming in
[1:16:47] spirit and in truth hallelujah and if
[1:16:51] there's ever a group of people people on
[1:16:53] the Earth that should offer God their
[1:16:55] worship it is people that believe this
[1:16:59] messag look at this he goes on to say
[1:17:02] this he says um but God was displeased
[1:17:04] because he didn't come the right way see
[1:17:05] he built the church an altar he put a
[1:17:07] sacrifice on the altar brought the
[1:17:09] fruits of the land was probably more
[1:17:11] beautiful you must watch this friends
[1:17:13] don't never forget this God did not
[1:17:15] accept what Cain was doing no matter how
[1:17:17] beautiful it was it was not accepted it
[1:17:19] was not in spirit and it was not in
[1:17:22] truth
[1:17:24] I was looking at this word
[1:17:26] worship so we find it in Genesis and we
[1:17:29] find it also in the Book of Revelations
[1:17:31] All Through the Bible but I wanted to
[1:17:32] find hey where was the first time this
[1:17:34] word was mentioned we know that Cain and
[1:17:36] Abel worshiped we know that Adam
[1:17:37] worshiped we know Eve worship they came
[1:17:39] and they did that but where was the word
[1:17:41] itself ever found in
[1:17:43] scripture Genesis
[1:17:45] 225 now before we read this scripture
[1:17:49] the background of this is that Abra abam
[1:17:53] has been waiting for 25 years to have a
[1:17:57] son that God promised
[1:17:58] him he finally gets his son I mean can
[1:18:02] you imagine
[1:18:03] Sarah uh you know 90 years old and
[1:18:06] carrying this baby and you know and and
[1:18:09] and and all that she went through to
[1:18:11] bring forth uh uh
[1:18:12] Isaac and um you know they finally got
[1:18:15] the promise it was manifested before
[1:18:17] their very eyes God had touched their
[1:18:18] bodies and did all these great things
[1:18:20] miraculous things they finally got the
[1:18:22] child and and Abraham one day wakes up
[1:18:24] and says uh Isaac and I uh are going to
[1:18:28] be leaving now I'm pretty sure the Bible
[1:18:32] does not State this but I'm married and
[1:18:36] I understand how this works and and and
[1:18:39] and and I'm pretty sure that Abraham did
[1:18:42] not tell
[1:18:44] Sarah what was getting ready to happen
[1:18:48] especially a woman 90 years old giving
[1:18:50] birth to this baby and now you're
[1:18:51] getting ready to take my son and do
[1:18:54] what no no no that will not happen I can
[1:18:57] I can just I can imagine him not telling
[1:18:59] Sarah what was giv ready to happen not
[1:19:01] only that when we read this verse we'll
[1:19:02] see that Abraham is actually telling
[1:19:05] amen some things to even his servants he
[1:19:06] kept this thing secret from everybody
[1:19:09] look at it in verse 22 I mean uh chapter
[1:19:11] 22: 5 it says and Abraham said unto his
[1:19:15] young men i b ye here with the ass and I
[1:19:19] and the L will go Yonder and worship
[1:19:23] ship and come again to you now this is a
[1:19:29] prophetic word that Abraham is speaking
[1:19:32] and look God never told Abraham to say
[1:19:34] this Abraham said it by faith Abraham
[1:19:38] did not know how God was going to do but
[1:19:40] he knew that uh that in in Isaac this uh
[1:19:43] the world would be blessed through the
[1:19:44] seed he knew something had to happen he
[1:19:46] didn't know what was going to happen but
[1:19:48] me and the young man were going to go
[1:19:50] and worship I want to tell you something
[1:19:52] about about this worship sometimes will
[1:19:57] demand a
[1:20:02] sacrifice sometimes you you got to force
[1:20:04] yourself to open your mouth and give God
[1:20:06] glory now even when you don't feel like
[1:20:09] praising him you still got to give him
[1:20:11] praise sometime you you have to adjust
[1:20:14] your attitude when you're coming into
[1:20:16] the house of God sometimes it requires a
[1:20:19] tremendous
[1:20:21] sacrifice I think that when God has
[1:20:23] pleased the most with our Aroma of
[1:20:29] Praise
[1:20:30] Abraham speaks these words and he goes
[1:20:33] on up the mountain and and and Isaac is
[1:20:36] packing the wood up the mountain and Ma
[1:20:38] he's bringing it up he's like you know
[1:20:40] wait he says okay we see I see the wood
[1:20:43] I see the fire but
[1:20:46] Dad where is the sacrifice and Dad you
[1:20:49] want me to
[1:20:51] worship now
[1:20:53] you mean to tell me I'm the
[1:20:55] sacrifice oh my my my my my my can I can
[1:20:58] I tell you something when you come into
[1:21:00] the house of God you do become the
[1:21:01] sacrifice and you know the Bible
[1:21:04] says present your
[1:21:07] bodies a Living Sacrifice sir holy and
[1:21:11] acceptable unto God that is the way to
[1:21:15] worship amen Isaac is wondering where is
[1:21:19] this sacrifice and he says look son God
[1:21:21] will provide for himself a sacrifice but
[1:21:25] somehow Isaac had to bring himself to
[1:21:27] yielding to what his dad needed at that
[1:21:30] moment as Sons I don't know how God's
[1:21:32] going to do this but I know there's a
[1:21:33] promise laying on you God's going to do
[1:21:35] it somehow but let's just go through the
[1:21:37] process when he lays him down there God
[1:21:39] says okay Abraham Abraham he called out
[1:21:41] of Heaven says I know you love me don't
[1:21:44] do any harm to your son Isaac there is a
[1:21:46] ram over here in the bush you can take
[1:21:49] that RAM and offer him in Isaac's dead
[1:21:52] when we we think about the ram the the
[1:21:54] Lamb of God the ram of God that was
[1:21:56] offered in our stead it ought to bring
[1:21:59] us to a place of
[1:22:02] worship I am
[1:22:05] sure
[1:22:07] Isaac had a thank you Lord glory to God
[1:22:14] hallelujah nobody would have to make Him
[1:22:16] worship God anymore after an experience
[1:22:18] like
[1:22:21] that worship must be pointed in the
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:25] direction in Genesis 225 we find the
[1:22:29] first time where this word worship is
[1:22:30] mentioned in revelation 22 verse 8-9 we
[1:22:35] find the word worship mentioned again
[1:22:38] there in scripture in the last book of
[1:22:40] the Bible the last chapter of the last
[1:22:43] book of the Bible we see something here
[1:22:46] worship must be pointed in the right
[1:22:50] direction look at this
[1:22:56] and I John saw these things and heard
[1:23:00] them and when I heard them when I heard
[1:23:03] and seen I fell down to worship before
[1:23:07] the feet of the Angel which showed me
[1:23:10] these
[1:23:12] things then saith he unto me who sayith
[1:23:15] the angel says unto John and now John
[1:23:17] represents Us in the Scripture it says
[1:23:19] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[1:23:21] for I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:23:24] brother and the prophets and of them
[1:23:25] which keep the sayings of this book
[1:23:29] worship
[1:23:31] God here the angel is telling John no
[1:23:34] don't worship a prophet don't worship a
[1:23:37] fellow servant don't worship a holy man
[1:23:41] don't worship a holy woman don't worship
[1:23:43] your pastor don't worship the
[1:23:46] evangelists don't worship the teachers
[1:23:49] don't worship the apostles don't worship
[1:23:51] the prophet worship
[1:23:56] God we know exactly where our worship
[1:23:59] where we pay our homage to it goes to
[1:24:01] God and God
[1:24:05] Alone we may quot a prophets but we
[1:24:08] don't worship a
[1:24:11] prophet I may quote Spurgeon but I don't
[1:24:14] worship
[1:24:15] Spurgeon amen there's times that I
[1:24:18] quoted Billy Graham but I don't worship
[1:24:20] Billy Graham I've quoted Oral Roberts
[1:24:23] and I don't worship Oral Roberts I
[1:24:26] worship Jesus
[1:24:29] Christ
[1:24:31] Amen brother brandom told us no true
[1:24:33] Prophet would would be worshiped no
[1:24:35] messenger of any kind would stand to be
[1:24:38] worship if you see a pastor or a
[1:24:41] minister or anybody uh uh looking for
[1:24:43] that worship and we have it right here
[1:24:44] in the messages all over other places
[1:24:47] people just worship their Pastor it's
[1:24:49] unbelievable carry them on their
[1:24:50] shoulder to the pull pit and what is
[1:24:53] this this this is this is
[1:24:56] false amen and I seen people just get
[1:24:58] completely offended cuz somebody rebuke
[1:25:01] them for for the worship that they're
[1:25:02] getting the word of God rebukes you for
[1:25:03] that that's right and they get offended
[1:25:05] and want to put out videos they might
[1:25:07] hear me say this and they put out a
[1:25:08] video I me who brother Jack think he is
[1:25:09] I'm I'm just a brother stand with the
[1:25:11] word of God I am going to worship God I
[1:25:13] will worship no
[1:25:15] man no man
[1:25:19] Hallelujah we have to pour our worship
[1:25:22] in the right
[1:25:24] direction here um I want to
[1:25:28] just drill
[1:25:30] back we were reading there in Luke
[1:25:32] Chapter
[1:25:34] 2 where the Shepherds now you got to
[1:25:38] understand these Shepherds would have
[1:25:39] would have never known where Christ was
[1:25:42] had not an angel come to them and shared
[1:25:44] this information they would have just
[1:25:46] been in their fields just doing whatever
[1:25:48] they do as Shepherds but but it's
[1:25:49] because a supernatural event curtain
[1:25:52] Angel showed up brought them a a message
[1:25:55] told them exactly where they would find
[1:25:57] Christ what he would look like
[1:25:59] everything they gave him all the details
[1:26:01] a angel had to give them that and when
[1:26:04] they got the message from the angel I
[1:26:06] love verse uh verse verse2 as we we read
[1:26:09] it uh Luke 2:20 earlier it said the
[1:26:12] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[1:26:15] praising God for all the things that
[1:26:17] they had heard and seen as it was told
[1:26:21] unto them what triggered worship from
[1:26:23] the Shepherds was the things that they
[1:26:25] heard and the things that they seen the
[1:26:29] things they heard from the angel that
[1:26:31] caused them to go to amen the uh uh uh I
[1:26:34] mean the stable and find them in the
[1:26:36] manger the the the things they the
[1:26:37] things they heard caused them to go
[1:26:39] there but when they saw him this is what
[1:26:42] really triggered the worship they
[1:26:44] worshiped based on what they heard and
[1:26:46] what they seen they were
[1:26:49] elected they were chosen people to be
[1:26:52] able to see the
[1:26:54] Savior I mean what an opportunity of
[1:26:57] course when when you've been chosen out
[1:26:59] of all the people on the Earth to go and
[1:27:02] lay eyes on the Savior it should produce
[1:27:07] worship but they're not they're not the
[1:27:09] only ones that produce worship because
[1:27:12] of what they seen and what they heard
[1:27:13] let's pick up the story amen as it's
[1:27:16] found in Matthew Chapter
[1:27:20] 2 now one of of
[1:27:23] the things about the Christmas season is
[1:27:26] that they always bring these guys in at
[1:27:27] the at the stable but he was they never
[1:27:30] showed up at the stable that's right now
[1:27:34] just it's just it's just reading the
[1:27:35] Bible we can see I think I think um
[1:27:39] unfortunately you know people have just
[1:27:41] put the scene together and we just
[1:27:43] people just think it's the right thing
[1:27:44] but according to the Bible is not these
[1:27:45] three Magi did not come until Jesus was
[1:27:48] roughly 2 years
[1:27:49] old amen the the the the the Shepherds
[1:27:53] came on the night that he was born the
[1:27:55] Angels sing on the night that he was
[1:27:57] born but but that's all that was dare
[1:27:59] worshiping but the Magi came later on
[1:28:02] and now let's let's pick this up in in
[1:28:03] Matthew Chapter 2 let's just read this
[1:28:05] really quick we got time amen I I love
[1:28:09] the word of the Lord here it says now
[1:28:13] when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[1:28:14] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[1:28:16] behold there came wise men from the East
[1:28:18] to
[1:28:20] Jerusalem say say where is he that is
[1:28:23] born King of the Jews for we have seen a
[1:28:25] star in the east and are come to worship
[1:28:27] Him Now notice they are based on what
[1:28:30] they
[1:28:31] sing the star in the east is what's
[1:28:35] drawing them to Jerusalem to come and
[1:28:39] worship they're coming bring their
[1:28:41] worship based on what they sing now
[1:28:44] here's the other thing the star stop
[1:28:46] shining when it got to
[1:28:48] Jerusalem the star didn't appear again
[1:28:50] until they actually got to the exact
[1:28:52] spot where Christ was right but here the
[1:28:55] star LED them to what I call
[1:28:58] proximity oh my my my my but as we read
[1:29:02] the rest of the scripture we're going to
[1:29:03] realize that it was the revelation of
[1:29:05] the word oh my that actually brought
[1:29:09] them into the presence of Christ the
[1:29:12] star brought them into proximity but the
[1:29:16] Revelation brought them into
[1:29:20] presence Hallelujah you see the star we
[1:29:24] had a star in this day we have seen his
[1:29:27] star amen he had a star a seventh angel
[1:29:31] a star according to Revelation 1 and 2
[1:29:33] and three amen a a star God had in the
[1:29:37] land we seen a star we recognize that
[1:29:40] but we've come to worship
[1:29:43] Christ the star brings us into amen
[1:29:48] proximity but the
[1:29:50] revelation brings us into the presence
[1:29:53] of
[1:29:54] God let's keep reading
[1:29:57] here verse two saying where is he that
[1:30:00] is born King of the Jews for we have
[1:30:01] seen a star in the east and are come to
[1:30:04] worship
[1:30:06] him when Herod the king had heard these
[1:30:09] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[1:30:11] with him when he had gathered all the
[1:30:14] chief priests and scribes of the people
[1:30:16] together he demanded of them where
[1:30:18] Christ should be
[1:30:20] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[1:30:23] of Judea for thus it is written by the
[1:30:25] prophets so now they're going back to
[1:30:27] the word right thus it is written by the
[1:30:29] prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land
[1:30:32] of Judah art not the least among the
[1:30:35] princes of Judah for uh for out of these
[1:30:37] shall come a governor that shall rule My
[1:30:40] People Israel they found it in the word
[1:30:43] they found where Christ was to be born
[1:30:45] by the word the star LED them to
[1:30:48] proximity but once they got the
[1:30:50] revelation of the word it sent them into
[1:30:52] his
[1:30:54] presence watch this
[1:30:56] now then
[1:30:58] Herod when he had privy called the wise
[1:31:01] men inquired of them diligently what
[1:31:03] time the star
[1:31:05] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[1:31:07] and said go and search diligently for
[1:31:10] this for the young child and when ye
[1:31:12] have found him bring me word
[1:31:16] again that I may
[1:31:18] come and worship him also
[1:31:23] from this
[1:31:24] statement we can see that not everybody
[1:31:28] comes into the house of God with the
[1:31:31] same
[1:31:33] intention as
[1:31:35] others right young
[1:31:37] sister that young man that wants to come
[1:31:41] to church because you go to that church
[1:31:44] he might not be here with the right
[1:31:46] intentions you're coming to worship and
[1:31:48] get closer to God he's coming to watch
[1:31:51] and get get closer to
[1:31:54] you young brother is the same thing amen
[1:31:58] the liila will come to
[1:32:01] church but she's coming not to get
[1:32:03] closer to God she's coming to get closer
[1:32:05] to you watch everybody's not coming with
[1:32:08] the same intention you want to make sure
[1:32:10] you find somebody has the same intention
[1:32:12] as you that loves God more than they
[1:32:14] love
[1:32:16] you look at that verse uh verse 8 again
[1:32:21] he sent to he sent them to Bethlehem and
[1:32:23] said go and search diligently for the
[1:32:26] young child and when you have found him
[1:32:28] bring me word again that I may come and
[1:32:29] worship him also and when they had heard
[1:32:31] the king they departed and lo the star
[1:32:33] which they saw in the East went before
[1:32:36] them till it came and stood over where
[1:32:38] the young child was see it led them to
[1:32:43] proximity they got the word revealed to
[1:32:45] them when they got to Jerusalem and now
[1:32:47] they could come into the very presence
[1:32:50] of the Lord and they're coming they have
[1:32:51] one purpose for coming we they took I
[1:32:53] don't know how long the journey was but
[1:32:55] their Journey their purpose in their
[1:32:57] Journey was so that we could go to
[1:33:00] worship young people when you came to
[1:33:02] the youth retreat I I hope your purpose
[1:33:04] was to come to worship now if God
[1:33:08] blesses me with something on top of my
[1:33:10] worship that's fine amen I hope you
[1:33:13] understand what I'm

[1:33:43] uh wise men that come with this
[1:33:46] intention that they're going to worship

[1:33:52] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[1:33:53] when they were come into the house see
[1:33:56] he wasn't in a Manger he was in the
[1:33:59] house at this time when they come into

[1:34:04] Mary his mother and fell down and
[1:34:08] worshiped him they expressed themselves
[1:34:12] to him and worshiped him and when they
[1:34:15] had open their Treasures they presented

[1:34:51] people take take off and run around the
[1:34:52] building that is a form of
[1:34:56] worship and even sometimes just sitting
[1:34:59] in the pews and saying Amen to the word
[1:35:02] of God is a form of worship everybody
[1:35:07] participate we have something to
[1:35:09] participate for we participate because
[1:35:11] of what we've seen and what we've
[1:35:14] heard look at this these these these um
[1:35:18] Magi based on what they saw they saw a
[1:35:20] star in the east
[1:35:22] and when they got to Jerusalem they
[1:35:23] heard the word reveal and based on what
[1:35:26] they seen and what they heard they begin
[1:35:29] to bring the gifts to the Lord here in
[1:35:31] verse uh verse 11 again when they were
[1:35:33] come into the house they saw the young
[1:35:34] child with Mary's mother and fell down
[1:35:36] and worshiped him and when they had
[1:35:38] opened the treasures they presented unto
[1:35:39] him gifts gold and frankincense of my
[1:35:41] and being warned of God in the dream
[1:35:42] that they should not return to Herod
[1:35:44] they departed into their own country
[1:35:46] another way there's another one I don't
[1:35:47] know if I got any group eight uh people
[1:35:51] that's here here but we talked about
[1:35:52] that in our devotion you you when you
[1:35:54] when you went into the house of let me
[1:35:56] just read that Ezekiel
[1:35:59] 469 put that up there really quick let
[1:36:02] me just read it I think it's e Ezekiel
[1:36:04] 46 and9 just want to uh share this with
[1:36:07] you uh when um the children of Israel
[1:36:11] would go to worship God gave them very
[1:36:14] specific
[1:36:16] instructions we have
[1:36:18] it okay Ezekiel 46 and9 I believe that's
[1:36:22] the right one my daughters can tell me
[1:36:24] whether I'm right or not I'm reading
[1:36:25] from the screen okay there we go when
[1:36:27] the people of the land shall come before
[1:36:29] the Lord in the solemn feasts he that
[1:36:33] entereth in by the way of the north gate
[1:36:35] to
[1:36:36] worship shall go out by the way of the
[1:36:39] south gate he that entereth by the way
[1:36:42] of the south gate shall go forth by the
[1:36:45] way of the north gate he shall not
[1:36:48] return by the way of the gate where by
[1:36:51] he came in but shall go forth over
[1:36:54] against it so if you came in through the
[1:36:56] north gate you couldn't go back out the
[1:36:59] north gate you had to come in the north
[1:37:01] gate and go out the south gate if you
[1:37:04] came in through the south gate you
[1:37:06] couldn't just go back out the south gate
[1:37:08] no you had to go back out the north gate
[1:37:10] and what this is simply saying is that
[1:37:12] you can't come in and leave the same way
[1:37:16] you
[1:37:18] came that's right and even even you see
[1:37:21] it here with with with with these Magi
[1:37:23] they might have come in one way but they
[1:37:24] went out another way Hallelujah and
[1:37:28] that's exactly what God wants us to do
[1:37:30] brother brandham told us that when we
[1:37:31] come to church we leave one of two ways
[1:37:34] Better or Worse make it your
[1:37:39] determination every time I come into the
[1:37:42] house of God no matter who's preaching
[1:37:44] I'm leaving
[1:37:48] better they worship based on what what
[1:37:51] they seen what they heard brother
[1:37:53] brandham was very clear when he told us
[1:37:57] these gifts that they brought gold was
[1:37:58] representing his deity as king of kings
[1:38:02] Frankin say represents a service
[1:38:05] offering you always use this a man when
[1:38:07] you were doing a service offering use
[1:38:09] frankincense in that offering Leviticus
[1:38:11] 2:2 uh talks about it Leviticus 16: 6-15
[1:38:15] talks about it and brother R says we
[1:38:17] find out that's the order of the
[1:38:18] priesthood to make an offering to
[1:38:20] Jehovah when he made the offering it had
[1:38:22] to be made and mixed with frankincense
[1:38:24] for a sin offering they took different
[1:38:26] things and mixed it for the meal
[1:38:28] offering for the wave offering
[1:38:29] frankincense was added because it was
[1:38:32] accepted acceptable to Jehovah if it was
[1:38:35] anointed with frankincense which means
[1:38:37] it's a service to Jehovah and the final
[1:38:40] thing that the Magi brought was myrr and
[1:38:43] that myrr was an anointing for death and
[1:38:46] here they're bringing it to this this
[1:38:47] this Christ child what this is Amen
[1:38:50] brother brandom tells it says it was
[1:38:51] deity in service to die now let me let
[1:38:56] me just ask this question do you
[1:39:00] think the the the the the Magi I mean
[1:39:02] I'm sorry the uh uh well Magi as well as
[1:39:06] the Shepherds didn't have the complete
[1:39:08] understanding of what was getting ready
[1:39:09] to happen with this child here here the
[1:39:12] the uh the shepherds are told there's a
[1:39:14] a savior that is Bor and maybe in their
[1:39:17] mind they're thinking somebody to
[1:39:18] Deliver Us from the Roman Empire no no
[1:39:21] no no this is someone to deliver you
[1:39:22] from
[1:39:24] sin they did not have any idea who this
[1:39:26] child really was and not only amen uh uh
[1:39:29] they worship just because of his birth
[1:39:32] they worship because this child was born
[1:39:33] because they saw a star in the east they
[1:39:35] worship because of those things but we
[1:39:37] worship for something far greater than
[1:39:39] what they worship for it's not just that
[1:39:41] he was born it's not just that he lived
[1:39:44] amen it's not just that he died but he
[1:39:47] rose again they did not get a chance to
[1:39:50] see those but we on the other side of it
[1:39:53] we get a chance to see this is what
[1:39:55] drives our worship we worship based on
[1:39:57] what we see and what we
[1:40:00] heard yes sir oh Hallelujah we got a
[1:40:04] greater perspective we got a greater
[1:40:07] Vision we got a broader picture yes
[1:40:10] which produ produces a greater
[1:40:14] worship we're not the only ones in this
[1:40:17] condition let me
[1:40:19] just
[1:40:23] read a couple things here for you this
[1:40:25] is out of the Church of the Living God
[1:40:27] brother random says when alone came the
[1:40:30] Virgin born Divine Son of God he was
[1:40:32] God's provided
[1:40:33] lamb provided sacrifice Jehovah Gyra the
[1:40:36] provided one and that he was born and
[1:40:39] people of that day of his day especially
[1:40:42] the religious people did not believe him
[1:40:44] because he never come in a classical way
[1:40:47] that they expected him but he came
[1:40:49] humble born in a manger wrapped in
[1:40:53] swallen cloths there was no singing at
[1:40:55] his birth as there is a king's birth
[1:40:58] Mortals when the king is born the people
[1:41:00] sing and have a jubilee but there was no
[1:41:02] King no people to sing at this king's
[1:41:05] birth but the Angels came down and sang
[1:41:08] to the shepherds in the city of David is
[1:41:11] born Christ the Savior and I and I'm
[1:41:13] going tell you when those angels start
[1:41:15] singing I don't think they had their
[1:41:17] mouths
[1:41:19] closed those Shepherds heard
[1:41:21] something they heard something that that
[1:41:24] changed their lives revolutionized their
[1:41:25] lives and let me tell you what we have
[1:41:27] heard in this hour through the
[1:41:29] revelation of the word it should produce
[1:41:32] a
[1:41:33] worship
[1:41:34] amen let's look at something here and
[1:41:37] and and and I want to read a scripture
[1:41:40] and and um I'll find a way to get
[1:41:46] out brother Brandon makes some comments
[1:41:49] about Revelation chapter 5
[1:41:53] in the sermon Revelation 5 part 2 he
[1:41:57] says the seven and last one of the seals
[1:42:01] of these seals when they're
[1:42:03] open it's found in Revelations the 10th
[1:42:06] chapter there was a mighty Angel which
[1:42:08] was Christ came down and put one foot on
[1:42:11] the land and one foot on the sea and
[1:42:13] raised up his hands and says the day is
[1:42:16] finished time has run out it's all over
[1:42:18] time shall be no more
[1:42:23] it says and he said at the sounding at
[1:42:26] this time the mystery of God should be
[1:42:27] finished who God is how he was made
[1:42:31] manifest how when that seal was open how
[1:42:34] we begin to understand now how that he
[1:42:37] was the son of God he was God himself
[1:42:41] made flesh I like to say this we we we
[1:42:44] know the scripture says so God for God
[1:42:46] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:42:48] begotten son but often times we
[1:42:50] misunderstand what he's really trying to
[1:42:52] say right it wasn't that God just sent
[1:42:56] his son come on it was God became the
[1:43:01] son in order to die for our sins he had
[1:43:04] to come in a robe of Flesh this is why
[1:43:08] we worship him because he became the son
[1:43:11] he was a spirit first but he became
[1:43:13] flesh so he could die for us it wasn't
[1:43:16] him sending his son he became the son
[1:43:19] amen amen look at this look at this
[1:43:25] Hallelujah who God is see we know who he
[1:43:29] is how he was made manifest God is not
[1:43:32] three different people amen he's one
[1:43:35] person Hallelujah this is why we're
[1:43:38] we're sure about baptism right even when
[1:43:41] Jesus himself says be baptized in the
[1:43:44] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:43:46] the Holy Ghost so many churches say
[1:43:49] we're doing it exact exactly the way
[1:43:51] Jesus said do it but then Peter 10 days
[1:43:55] after Jesus speak this he says be
[1:43:57] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:59] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:44:00] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:44:02] Holy Ghost the promises unto you amen
[1:44:04] your children those that are far off as
[1:44:05] many as the Lord Our God shall call how
[1:44:07] could Peter get it wrong after 10 days
[1:44:09] on I always like to ask that question
[1:44:11] did Peter get it wrong or did he really
[1:44:13] get it right
[1:44:15] on I I I I let you know today he got it
[1:44:18] right Peter understood who the son was
[1:44:22] first he was walking with the son he was
[1:44:25] talking with the son he knew who the Son
[1:44:27] of God was he could put the other two
[1:44:29] pieces of the puzzle together if if if
[1:44:31] this is the Son and Jesus said when you
[1:44:33] seen me youve seen my father he knew who
[1:44:36] the father was he knew who the Holy
[1:44:38] Spirit was they was the same person one
[1:44:42] God and his name is Lord Jesus
[1:44:47] Christ that's right that's worshiping
[1:44:51] in spirit amen and in truth that's right
[1:44:56] that's serving in spirit and interest
[1:45:03] amen who God is how he was made manifest
[1:45:08] how when that seal was open how we begin
[1:45:10] to understand now how that he was the
[1:45:14] son of God he was God himself made flesh
[1:45:17] and the revelation of who he is that
[1:45:19] should be finished before this angel can
[1:45:21] put his feet upon the land and sea and
[1:45:24] swear that there'll be no more uh when
[1:45:26] when this time comes we're right in that
[1:45:28] front yard of it right now now brother
[1:45:30] brandom is saying this in 1961 we're in
[1:45:32] the front yard of while he was on the
[1:45:34] earth we're in the front yard I'm
[1:45:35] telling you we're all over the are
[1:45:38] now look at this it says the last one of
[1:45:42] them is revelation 10 foot on the land
[1:45:44] and on the sea time had run out
[1:45:46] Redemption is over and now he comes in
[1:45:48] as a lion he was a lamb then now he
[1:45:52] comes in as a lion to of the tribe of
[1:45:54] Judah stay with me just for a little bit
[1:45:56] longer look at this he says now let me
[1:45:58] just read just the rest of this so I can
[1:46:00] get it to you right quick now and the
[1:46:03] eighth verse now I'm going to go back
[1:46:04] and read the whole chapter in a second
[1:46:05] but I wanted you to just catch his
[1:46:07] commentary on the eth verse I'm going to
[1:46:10] Revelation 5 in a second he says this
[1:46:12] when he had taken the book The Four
[1:46:15] beasts TW the four and 20 Elders fell
[1:46:17] down before the lamb having every one of
[1:46:19] them Harps and go golden vows full of
[1:46:21] odors and prayers of the Saints now this
[1:46:22] is the commentary now this is the
[1:46:26] time when
[1:46:29] everything must be worshiped hold up now
[1:46:33] I want us to make sure we get this Jesus
[1:46:35] uses terms like ye must be born again
[1:46:41] that means there is no other option
[1:46:44] there is no other alternative ye must
[1:46:48] not ye must go to church Church you must
[1:46:51] build an altar you must no no you must
[1:46:55] be born again before you can worship he
[1:46:58] must be born again right brother brandom
[1:47:02] uses the same term that after the seals
[1:47:05] have been opened after all these
[1:47:07] Revelations that come forth according to
[1:47:09] the scripture he says now amen it says
[1:47:12] uh this is a time when everything must
[1:47:15] be worshiped let everything that have
[1:47:18] breath praise the Lord it must be be
[1:47:21] worship Oh My My My I I pray as we go
[1:47:24] into the the new year amen we won't have
[1:47:26] anybody coming to church like
[1:47:29] this no no no no no do have you heard
[1:47:32] what I was
[1:47:33] saying based on what we hear and what we
[1:47:36] see that's why we enter into worship
[1:47:39] look at what it says it says this is the
[1:47:41] time when everything must be worshiped
[1:47:44] now remember how appropriate don't let
[1:47:46] us miss this now listen close when all
[1:47:49] the mysteries of the church agents was
[1:47:51] finished when all the mysteries of the
[1:47:53] Plan of Redemption then Seven Seals was
[1:47:55] open right immediately after this now
[1:47:57] look it's time for everything in heaven
[1:47:59] and everything on Earth to worship
[1:48:04] god let's go and read it out of
[1:48:07] Revelation
[1:48:09] 5 based on what we have
[1:48:12] seen based on what we have heard it
[1:48:15] should produce a
[1:48:18] sincere worship
[1:48:21] yes every time the church doors open you
[1:48:24] ought to be
[1:48:25] ready to worship I'm not feeling well in
[1:48:29] my body he still deserves the praise and
[1:48:32] the reason he deserves it is because I
[1:48:34] still have breath in my body and the
[1:48:37] Bible said let
[1:48:39] everything that have breath praise the
[1:48:43] Lord sometimes you have to adjust your
[1:48:45] attitude that's right sometimes it
[1:48:48] requires a sacrifice that's right but I
[1:48:51] I I don't care what I'm going through I
[1:48:53] got enough in me to give God a thank you
[1:48:57] Jesus
[1:48:59] Hallelujah glory to your name I at least
[1:49:02] got that much in me in my tank I got
[1:49:04] enough to say praise you
[1:49:06] father every ought everybody ought to be
[1:49:08] that way brother brandom refers back to
[1:49:11] Revelation 5 and I want us to read this
[1:49:13] and I'll
[1:49:14] uh find a way to get out here soon let
[1:49:17] me just take a little sip of water
[1:49:20] oh blessed be the name of the
[1:49:29] Lord Revelation 5 it says this and I saw
[1:49:31] in the right hand of him now when when
[1:49:33] we're reading this we have to see that
[1:49:35] John is representing Us in this
[1:49:38] chapter and I saw in the right hand of
[1:49:40] him that sat on the throne a book
[1:49:42] written
[1:49:47] within a book written Within and on the
[1:49:51] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[1:49:53] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:49:55] loud voice who is
[1:49:58] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:50:01] seals
[1:50:03] thereof and no man in
[1:50:07] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[1:50:11] Earth was able to open the book neither
[1:50:14] to look there on this was a hopeless
[1:50:19] situation
[1:50:20] verse four says ' and I wept much John
[1:50:23] began to cry because of what he saw
[1:50:28] here I we wept much because no man was
[1:50:31] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:50:33] book neither looked there on let me let
[1:50:34] me tell you John looked he saw
[1:50:38] Abraham wasn't worthy he saw
[1:50:41] Isaac wasn't worthy he saw
[1:50:45] Jeremiah
[1:50:47] Isaiah habach all all of these Micah
[1:50:51] Malachi all of these people nobody was
[1:50:56] worthy John saw
[1:50:58] you you weren't
[1:51:01] worthy John saw brother
[1:51:03] brandom he wasn't
[1:51:07] worthy John be to
[1:51:10] cry because no one was worthy to take
[1:51:14] this book verse four again and I wept
[1:51:16] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:51:20] open and to read the book neither to
[1:51:23] look there
[1:51:26] on the Shepherds worship because of what
[1:51:30] they heard what they
[1:51:33] sing the Magi worship because of what
[1:51:36] they heard they saw I mean what they saw
[1:51:39] the star and then they heard the word
[1:51:41] when they got to Jerusalem they heard
[1:51:43] the word revealed they went to worship
[1:51:44] based on what they saw what they
[1:51:47] heard we're going to find John is in the
[1:51:50] the same position he's going to worship
[1:51:52] because of what he heard and what he saw
[1:51:56] he saw no man worthy but here now he
[1:51:59] hears something look at this verse verse
[1:52:01] verse five and one of the elders sath
[1:52:03] unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the
[1:52:07] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[1:52:09] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:52:11] the seals thereof now he he says the
[1:52:13] lion of the tribe of Judah right so now
[1:52:16] so so here he heard that but now verse
[1:52:18] six and I be hell and lo in the midst of
[1:52:22] the
[1:52:22] throne uh of the four beasts and in the
[1:52:25] midst of the elders stood a lamb so what
[1:52:27] he heard was that a lion prevailed but
[1:52:29] when he saw he saw a
[1:52:31] lamb Hallelujah when you see the lamb
[1:52:35] and what the lamb has done for you it
[1:52:37] will produce a
[1:52:39] worship look at this a lamb as it had
[1:52:42] been slain amen having seven horns and
[1:52:44] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:52:46] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[1:52:47] he came and took the book out of the
[1:52:49] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:52:51] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:52:53] the four and uh the four beasts and four
[1:52:56] and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:52:58] having every one of them Harps and
[1:52:59] golden vows full of odors which are the
[1:53:01] prayers of the Saints and brother
[1:53:03] Brandon say when when we got to that
[1:53:04] part he says everybody ought to be
[1:53:06] entering into worship this is a time
[1:53:08] that everybody should be worshiping
[1:53:10] based on what we have heard and what
[1:53:12] we've seen we ought to be able to
[1:53:14] worship
[1:53:16] am I like
[1:53:18] this and they sung a new song saying
[1:53:21] Thou Art Worthy to take this take the
[1:53:23] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:53:26] thou was slain and H has redeemed us to
[1:53:28] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[1:53:30] and tongue and people and nation and has
[1:53:32] made unto uh made us unto our Gods Kings
[1:53:35] and Priests and we shall reign on the
[1:53:38] earth I want to just say something here
[1:53:40] I'm going to read a little further in
[1:53:41] there I'm going to read the whole
[1:53:42] chapter in a second we only a few more
[1:53:43] verses but I want to just stop and say
[1:53:45] John worshiped because of what he
[1:53:47] heard and what he seen
[1:53:50] John represents us John John John saw
[1:53:53] this whole thing unfold he he saw I mean
[1:53:56] and I'm going to tell you another thing
[1:53:57] about John when John saw that there was
[1:54:01] no one worthy to take this book what
[1:54:03] what it just he knew that that that that
[1:54:05] all creation was
[1:54:08] finished if nobody would step forth and
[1:54:10] take this book so when he heard that the
[1:54:13] lion of the tribe of Judah ha prevailed
[1:54:15] and then he turned and looked and saw a
[1:54:17] lamb John began to worship and way that
[1:54:20] was
[1:54:21] unbelievable we'll read it in a little
[1:54:23] bit but it was unbelievable worship
[1:54:25] based on what he seen and based on what
[1:54:28] he heard amen John began to worship
[1:54:31] verse n said and they
[1:54:34] sung a new
[1:54:39] song I was at a church recently and and
[1:54:43] um brother Burley Williams made a
[1:54:45] comment I was at his church and he said
[1:54:47] you know that new song is songs that
[1:54:51] only message people can
[1:54:56] write because they're writing based on
[1:54:59] what they have
[1:55:00] heard and what they
[1:55:03] see and and and they begin to write
[1:55:05] songs that can't be sung in the average
[1:55:07] denominational church because they
[1:55:09] wouldn't understand the
[1:55:11] lyrics Hallelujah so so here at literal
[1:55:14] life I know there have been a number of
[1:55:16] new songs that have been written not
[1:55:19] only here Amen in literal life but uh
[1:55:22] I'm sure all over my daughters have
[1:55:24] written songs and amen my I have an aunt
[1:55:26] sister Brenda Lewis she wrote some songs

[1:57:13] titled save me from my airing
[1:57:16] way restore me to the faith I pray What

[2:02:46] direction look at this out of the
[2:02:47] message the deity of Jesus
[2:02:51] Christ and that same
[2:02:56] power that same Christ Hallelujah let
[2:02:59] the fundamentalist let the people who
[2:03:01] deny the power of God say it's wrong but
[2:03:03] that same power that spoke the world
[2:03:06] into existence is in those people that's
[2:03:09] got the Holy
[2:03:11] Ghost that's right he says men and women
[2:03:15] it's time that we found out who you are
[2:03:18] the devil Devil's trying to hide you
[2:03:20] back and tell you you're some little

[2:06:03] in the spirit in the human being
[2:06:07] yes you're talking about worshiping in
[2:06:09] spirit and
[2:06:10] Truth the only people that could do that

[2:06:15] are in Christ they don't just they don't
[2:06:18] you know it's a life they live on a
[2:06:19] daily basis it becomes songs that they
[2:06:22] sing come on and so when those songs
[2:06:25] start going forth here in this church I
[2:06:26] tell you what everybody ought to be
[2:06:28] lifting their voices come before his
[2:06:30] presence with singing tonight they said

[2:06:45] way you start off the year is the way
[2:06:46] you end the year I want to start by
[2:06:49] praising him and I want to end by
[2:06:51] praising him and all throughout the year
[2:06:52] I want my life to be just total worship
[2:06:55] to
[2:06:59] godall let's
[2:07:06] pray
[2:07:09] father based on what we have
[2:07:12] seen in
[2:07:15] scripture based on what we have heard
[2:07:20] through the revelation of
[2:07:23] scripture it has
[2:07:26] produced a life that wants to
[2:07:29] worship that realizes that we need to
[2:07:32] express ourselves to you God and we
[2:07:35] don't have to have the greatest
[2:07:38] voice but you told us to make a Joyful
[2:07:40] Noise because you just enjoy hearing
[2:07:42] us just as we enjoy hearing you we enjoy
[2:07:45] seeing you you enjoy hearing us so God
[2:07:49] we bring our worship to you we bring our
[2:07:51] adoration we bring our
[2:07:54] praise because you alone deserve it
[2:07:58] John saw a hopeless
[2:08:02] situation but God when he heard the the
[2:08:05] elders say don't don't weep John don't
[2:08:08] weep the lion of the tribe of Judah ha
[2:08:11] [Music]
[2:08:13] prevailed he's the one that's taken the
[2:08:15] book and he's loosing the seals of John
[2:08:16] realized a man uh uh how important that
[2:08:22] was and it caused them to turn to a
[2:08:25] place of
[2:08:26] worship God help us Lord this morning to
[2:08:29] be able to see God that John represented
[2:08:31] us and we ought to be able to turn to a
[2:08:34] place of worship even when it's from a
[2:08:36] place of
[2:08:39] sacrifice we give it to you
[2:08:43] Jesus because you alone deserve it I
[2:08:46] pray your blessings upon these Saints I
[2:08:48] play pray your blessings upon this
[2:08:50] church God that you would just continue
[2:08:51] to use them and to write these new songs
[2:08:54] that we could sing to your honor to your
[2:08:58] glory we give you Praise
[2:09:03] Jesus amen I didn't really finish
[2:09:06] reading Revelation 5 so let me just
[2:09:07] finish that really quick verse 9 says
[2:09:09] they sung a new song saying thou worthy
[2:09:12] to take the book and to open the seals
[2:09:13] thereof for thou was slain and has
[2:09:14] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[2:09:17] every Kindred and Tong and people and
[2:09:19] nation and has made us into our God
[2:09:21] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[2:09:24] the earth It also says and I beheld and
[2:09:27] I heard the voice of many angels round
[2:09:29] about the throne and the beasts and the
[2:09:30] elders and the and the number of them
[2:09:32] was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of
[2:09:34] thousands sang with a loud voice now
[2:09:37] this is what John heard Worthy is the
[2:09:39] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[2:09:40] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[2:09:42] and glory and blessing but I told you
[2:09:43] John did something that nobody's ever
[2:09:46] done I've never heard anybody worship
[2:09:47] God like this
[2:09:50] verse 13 says every
[2:09:52] creature which is in
[2:09:55] heaven and on the earth and under the
[2:10:01] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[2:10:05] that are in them heard I
[2:10:08] say
[2:10:10] blessing and honor and glory and power
[2:10:14] be unto him that sth upon the throne
[2:10:16] based on what John saw what John heard
[2:10:19] it cused him to enter into worship and
[2:10:21] unto the lamb forever and ever verse 14
[2:10:25] and the four beasts said amen I'm going
[2:10:28] tell you when you get start worshiping
[2:10:30] other people will join
[2:10:32] you the four be said amen and the 4
[2:10:35] and20 Elders fell down and worship him
