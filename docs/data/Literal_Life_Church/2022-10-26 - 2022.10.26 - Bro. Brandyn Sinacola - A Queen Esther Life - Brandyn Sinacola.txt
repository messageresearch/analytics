========================================

chapter 2 and verse 1 and I'm going to read through verse 20. after these things when the wrath of King athazarus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins into shushan the palace to the house of the women and to the custody of hagai the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be Queen instead of vashti and the thing please the king and he did so now when shushan the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of the son of jair the son of shimmyi the son of Kish a benjamite who had been carried away from Jerusalem and the Captivity which had been carried away from with jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom Mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter you can have your seats and we'll continue reading I just want to comment real quick before we continue on that um the the setting of The Story here we know the the story of Queen Esther and we know that it was in the medes and Persian Empire and um we said last time that this this particular King Xerxes or ahazarus he was one of the most uh had one of the most lavish kingdoms out of the Persian Empire his his Reign was one of the most renowned in the Persian Reign and so we see this setting for going into Esther and then I just thought it was interesting it's it's just I can't wrap my mind around the timing of it because it just it crisscrosses so much um probably uh you know somebody like brother Rapp could could really tie it out for us but um I'm just not that smart but you have uh Ezra and then I believe it was Ezra Esther and then Nehemiah if or vice versa but Queen Esther they they kind of their time frames kind of run together and we can see that in verse six uh when there's talking about Mordecai the scripture says who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity so under King Nebuchadnezzar and it switched we know that that was uh prophecy um Jeremiah prophesied of King Cyrus I believe if I've got my Kings right and um he he came and they they demolished the temple and took the Jews captive and that's the setting that we find when Esther is first mentioned here so you know it's it's a it's a time of of of great uh Darkness for the Jews in one sense and yet because it was such an illustrious um it was such an illustrious uh Empire that the Jews actually um I I liken that to our day as I was reading it because it was a lot of soft living for the Jews it was hard they were taken captive that's true but yet they God gave them favor under the Persian Empire to rebuild the Temple to rebuild the wall um they they were actually held it kind of went back and forth as you as you read Ezra and Nebuchadnezzar the the different Kings and then people would rise up and they'd write a letter to the king and they'd say hey these Jews are bad people and the king would say down with the bad people and then somebody else would you know rise up and he'd say oh these are good people and then somebody else would write in and say hey those are bad people and then so it just just kind of went like this back and forth but from as far as I can tell now I don't know exactly why Mordecai tells Esther when she gets when she gets taken here we're going to read in a minute and he says don't tell him you're a Jew now to the best of my knowledge there had to be some hatred to the Jews for him to say hey protect yourself don't tell him you're Jewish so to me there's there's some form of persecution here and yet when you read history in different things around this time frame it's the Jews had had a had an easy lifestyle that in one sense they were they were benefiting I should say by the the lavishness of this Empire so it it really kind of you could you could say it became almost a laodicea you know it was it was a lukewarm and yet they're living among Heathen people so you have God-fearing people living among Heathen people with a lavish lifestyle and it gets really easy to let down the guard and and let go of the standards that the Jews held so dear but Mordecai here is is one that held strong and and raised Hadassah because he said he brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncle's daughter because her parents passed away and so Mordecai raised her in the fear of the Lord so verse 8 says so it came to pass when the King's Command and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together into shushan the palace to the custody of hagai that Esther was brought also into the King's house to the custody of Hagi I Keeper of the women now I was I was I can't even remember what we were talking about but I was telling a couple Brothers a little joke that I had heard about uh you know the the uh ever since I gave my Italian voice over the pulpit I've I've gotten a lot of comp uh compliments but comments about about Italians so um just telling this joke about they said you know back in 9 11 if they would have sent the mafia after Bin Laden it would have been over in 24 hours and uh so I just imagined as I was going through this and thinking of Esther and I was thinking you know this this wasn't you know some Italian Persian walking up and knocking on the door and and you know bonjourno would you like to come to the king's palace with me I I don't think it was like that I think it was more like you know this this comedian said that the Italians the mafia walked up and they kick in the door and and you know hey how you doing we're going to the king's Palace you know she didn't they didn't give her a choice there was there was nothing she was taking captive she was taken by force and you can imagine now from what I can tell Esther wasn't in her in her 20s she was probably from I I remember I've I've tried reading a lot trying to grasp it all and I think at one point I heard she was maybe around 17 and so you can imagine she doesn't have Mom she doesn't have Dad she's just got her uncle um and uh am I okay moving tonight back on the camera or do you need me to stand still okay I think we're I don't we might be a little short-handed but um so she's under the care of her uncle and I imagine being taken from him in such a manner probably at night who knows probably with rough rough soldiers they didn't treat her nicely they didn't they didn't treat her well um you know they just they they come in they grab the fair versions and they take them to the palace and I can imagine that Esther is is extremely afraid she's she's she's deathly fearful not knowing exactly what's going to happen what's it what's it mean to be to be uh up for the running of of Queen and then and then far as I know once these women were taken they weren't going back to their families they were staying in the palace as part of the uh the king's Harem uh they they weren't going home and so I imagine that the fear and and the screams and the crying and the tears and and to make matters worse it says I mean it was a it was there was blessings in it but you imagine even with this she's still scared Esther was brought into the King's house to the custody of Hagee eye Keeper of the women and the Maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification with such things as belong to her and seven maidens which me uh were meat to be given her out of the King's house and he and he preferred her and her maidens unto the best place of the House of the women so there's a blessing in here but let's let's keep reading Esther had not showed her people for her Kindred uh for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it and Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her you see there's a question what's going to happen to Esther there's this even though she was given favor there's this question looming over her head of what's going to happen what's going to be the next step where is she gonna end up what if she gets known that she's a Jew I don't know maybe she would have died then I'm not sure maybe she would have went to slavery uh now when every maid's turn was come to go to the King ahazarus after that she had been 12 months 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to wit six months with oil and myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women and and I and I imagine that you know some of some of the wives are thinking well man I would love a 12-month Spa but you can imagine not knowing what's going to happen after this for 12 months this is this is a year-long trial of questions this is this is a year-long uh uh of of just something looming over Esther every day waking up and and although you had the ex the extravagance and the nice treatment and and the the the the the American living around us um the lifestyle that we live today there's always this question over her head of what's going to happen next so you can imagine that this trial it wasn't a day it wasn't it wasn't a bad day it wasn't a bad week this was 12 months this was a whole year now then thus came every Maiden unto the king whatsoever she she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women under the King's house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shashgas the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name this is a lifelong thing now when the turn of Esther the daughter of uh daughter of abahale the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her first daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what Hagia the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther was taken unto King azarus into his house Royal on the tenth month which is the month to Beth in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in her sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashti then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even Esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then Mordecai sat in the king's gate Esther had not yet showed her Kindred nor her people as Mordecai had charged her for Esther did the Commandment of Mordecai like as when she was brought up with him so I just wanna and for them in the back I'm just going to title this tonight Queen Esther and I just want to I maybe give an introduction last time we spoke on on Queen vashti and and kind of what a queen shouldn't be and tonight by the help and grace of God I'd like to talk a little bit about what a queen should be and I've been trying to catch up on the the services from the men's meeting and and there was one particular that I listened to this week for the brothers who went and and maybe who have gone back and listened it was brother Jack Duff and um he spoke on uh choosing of a bride and it was just I I just took a lot of things from that that was so good um so I'm gonna repeat a lot from it um and just fit it in with the story of Esther because I just he was speaking to Men I'm going to speak tonight to women and and I just pray that God will bring it spiritually to us as well so Esther we find she was she was fair she obtained favor with everybody that she went to right is what the scripture said she was beautiful she was fair she was beautiful and and she just she had that pure virtuous Spirit about her that that that a man would desire that and this King was attracted to a heathen King a Persian king and and yet he was attracted to Esther to it to a Jew even though he didn't know it was her now she was she was uh the last time I just kind of typed it this way um Esther and she was a type of a beautiful branch predestinated and elected to be Christ Queen chosen for her character and that's the type that we see there now the story of Esther's interesting I know I'm bouncing around a lot but I'm just trying to lay into uh Queen Esther here Esther's there's there's a lot of speculation there's a lot of criticism of the Bible there's a lot of back and forth between secular and Christians because God is not mentioned one time in the story of Esther when you read Esther God is not mentioned one time it's not even necessarily I it fits in with the history of Ezra and Nehemiah but there's really nothing um it gives a little bit of History just a brief spot in the Jews where they were going to be annihilated but there's just not much to it in the way of applying uh according to many even Christians applying it to the Christian walk but yet we see all these types and shadows in it and we can see Christ and his bride throughout it and so I thank God for Revelation like this but if we go to Isaiah 4 and verse 1 . and and when I looked at this I saw Queen vashti and Queen Esther and it says in the day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by the name thy name to take away our reproach and I just I highlighted these women saying and we want to wear our own apparel because nowadays not just talking about you know Christian modesty but just talking about the women of this world is they're going to wear what they want to wear you're not allowed to say anything anymore if they want to walk out of the house naked you dare not say anything that's the that's the age we live in and yet they want to be called Christians to take away their reproach verse 2 in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious that's you sisters that's every Christian filled with the Holy Spirit a beautiful Branch but I I just want to lash on to that you sisters tonight it's a beautiful Branch you're glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy foreign these women are Are Holy unto the Lord they're holy the way the way they dress they're presented as a beautiful Branch they're they're holy in the sight of the Lord the way you sisters dress the way you conduct yourselves um let's see even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion I just I see the day we're living in through and through in and out of these verses the the filth of the daughters around us and yet God comes and he takes you sisters and he washes you with his Spirit he washes you in the water of his word Esther Esther was was given to to I'm going to say the prophet haggai to to to dress her to get her ready to go before the king and you sisters we had a Prophet come today and he gave you how to dress he gave you how to wear your hair he he he brought light and he shed light to bring you dignity and to bring you glory and so that you are holy before the Lord and he washed away the filth of the daughters we have filth around us we have we have women who who are just filthy the way they act the way they talk the way they they they smoke and they drink and it's and it's just filthy before the Lord and it's it's it's it's it's filthy to to a holy ghost god-filled brother and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud in Smoke by day and The Shining of a flame Fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense the word Esther means star it's a star shining it's it's a star is bright and and it's beautiful in the darkness of the night sky so in this time when when Isaiah is laying this out by prophecy and and it's a dark time it's a filthy time and yet there's a woman who's going to shine bright in the Darkness there's there's a there's a a a a god called sisters who who are going to shine bright there's a there's a bride of Jesus Christ who's going to shine bright and the darker it is the darker it gets around us the darker it gets around you sisters the brighter You're Gonna Shine that you you say well I don't I don't want to stand out well I got news for you you're going to stand out naturally just by holding God's standard you're going to stand out more than the brothers because because you're a beautiful Branch before the Lord don't let that scare you about standing out that's your your your beauty is is is a natural beauty there's men of the world who who look upon you and they say there's something beautiful about that I want somebody like that amen it takes Darkness for the stars to shine and the darker the night the brighter they shine you go out into the country and you get away from from all the the the the the the the the filth the the pollution the the the the the smog the light pollution they call it you get out into the country you go out into the desert sometime you go out into the woods and when you look up there's no light around and those those stars shine as bright as you've ever seen them you see more stars you see stars that are that are further away and that are closer to you and and you see you see all kinds of things you see shooting stars you see you see stars that normally listen now stars that normally you wouldn't see stars that normally don't appear to be shining as it gets darker they shine no matter how dim they shine and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime for the Heat and for a place of refuge and for a cover from storm and from rain now we know that that God is our is our covering God as our Tabernacle it we know that God speaks of a light and a smoke by day we know that that's the that's a pillar of fire but but I'm seeing the women of the Lord I'm seeing the queen Esters of today I'm seeing that a Godly wife is like a tabernacle for a man for a shadow in the daytime from the Heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storming from rain and I know you think that that might be I I I you might think go ahead and think that I'm lifting the sisters up because I am I'm lifting the women up I'm lifting you sisters up because you are when when your husband comes in from from the world you're a tabernacle you're you're a covering for him you're a you're a peace within the storm you you can you can listen now we know it's God but it's God in you and it's and it's because you're holy it's because you're righteous it's because you're a woman of the Lord that you take away the cares of the world from the man that you you take the stress off of his shoulders that you you you hide him from the storm when he's had a bad day when he's having a bad week when he knows he has to go back into it tomorrow you're you're uh you're a covering your your uh you're a rain in the heat you're a you're a drink of fresh water Esther was a type of that beautiful branch and she was predestinated and elected for that day I don't want to get into it too much because I'm I'm holding this one but she was predestinated for for such a time as this you sisters have been predestinated you were held back through through six thousand years for this day you were held for this day because God had to have the the stars that would Shine the brightest safe for this day think of the value brothers that you should have for these sisters that God saved them for a day that's going to be darker than any other God saved these sisters there's women throughout the ages we look at Esther and we Marvel at her we Marvel at her grace we Marvel at her beauty we we we we we can talk about the women of the Bible but you sisters are writing a new a new chapter you're found in the pages of the Bible and yet you're writing a new chapter because those women back in those days that we looked to and we admire and and we and we lift up they don't they they they they only shine so bright you shine so much brighter because of the day you live in are you with me tonight now this is where I start picking up some of what brother Jack was bringing and like I said he was speaking to the men and I just thought man you could speak this to the women just as much here so I'm giving you sisters a glimpse into the men's meeting Proverbs 18 22. listen watch your position sisters he who finds a wife finds a good thing he that finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord this is your position this is the position that God has placed you in is that when a man finds you and he's blessed to call you his wife he finds a good thing and he obtains favor with the Lord first Peter 3 this is this is I hope you're catching it tonight especially you sisters I want you to see yourself in the scripture I want you to see what God thinks of you I want you to feel the dignity that God has spoken over you first Peter 3 in the Amplified says in the same way you wives be submissive to your own husbands subordinate not as inferior but out of respect for the responsibilities entrusted to your husbands you Sisters You bear a great weight you bear a a a heavyweight like I said the way you the way you dress what's what's been asked of you of God notice I said what's been asked of you you can make whatever decision you want but what's been asked of you by your Heavenly Father by your by your king Christ Jesus and and yet it says that the husband is has responsibilities that's entrusted to him you're one of those responsibilities your husband is responsible for you so you so when you when you get down on yourself and you think well why do I have to do this why do I have to do that why your husband has a great has I hope this is okay to say but this is the way I see it your husband has a greater responsibility because he's been set charge over you he's been set charged to lead you not as something uh inferior but but subordinate me equal but yet out of respect for the responsibilities entrusted to your husband and their accountability to God your account you're held accountable to your husband but your husband's accountable to God amen and so partnering with them so partnering with them not trying to rule over them not even acting inferior to them but but uh partnering with them you're a partner in this journey you're a partner in this life to your husband you're you're a help that's been meat that's been given meat Esther was given Maids maids and and servants that were meat for that means they were fitting for they were they were there to help her you've been given a help meet to your husband uh so that even if some of them listen now even if a husband does not obey the word of God that they may be won over to Christ without discussion by The Godly lives of their wives sister Don't Preach to your husband you'll just turn him off when a man needs respect and when you preach to him when you're trying to to uh uh um win him over with with words only and and and you come off uh religiously Superior that husband will never touch it with a ten foot pole it says without discussion by Godly lives you have the power to win an unsaved husband now I would recommend that you don't go get an unsaved husband and then try to convert them brother Branham said if he doesn't have the Holy Ghost I don't care if he's sitting in this church I don't care if he's preaching In a Pulpit I don't care who he is if that man does not have the Holy Ghost stay away from him I don't care how handsome he is how how Italian he looks how much he can sing like Dean Martin foreign if you don't have the Holy Ghost brother Branham said he'll make hell for you on Earth and I guarantee you sister he'll make hell for you on Earth don't chance it don't don't take it the NIV says wives in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that if any of them do not believe the word they may be went over without words by the behavior of their wives I know I know sisters who's one one particular and I don't want to call her out over the pulpit but I know one and her husband's an unbeliever and that woman is so faithful and and godly and living that way before her husband and and I and I don't I know she says she prays for him but I don't know how much more she talks about the Lord to him she just lives a Godly life and I'll tell you beautiful branch of the Lord Esther by her character and her influence she influenced one of the most powerful kings in the Persian Empire she so won her husband's love that he offered her half his kingdom imagine the trust that the king of the Empire the greatest Empire at the time had in a woman like Esther to say Esther what's your request I'll give you half of my kingdom could you imagine being offered that listen us husbands here we don't have a very big Kingdom so you got to use your imagination a little bit sorry sis but can you imagine she influenced this King so much and and I want to talk about it more later on she influenced them so much the the she lived such a such a life there was such an air about her there was so much character to her that this man offered her half of his kingdom if he had the Proverbs he would have known Esther he would have labored her he probably would have when he celebrated Esther because he he he crowned Esther and then it says he set out a great feast among everybody he gave gifts he was just so in love with her he was so happy he sent out gifts to to everybody but it says but if if he would have had the Proverbs and known him of that day he would have said Esther is a proverbs 31 Queen and US Brothers you Brothers you should be able to say my wife is a proverbs 31 Queen you sisters you should be worthy of the title of proverbs 31 Queen King Xerxes knew Esther wouldn't try to take a kingdom for herself he could offer her half of his kingdom because he knew she wasn't going to abuse it he knew she wasn't going to try to to to take it and and make her own kingdom she would take his kingdom his portion of his kingdom that he offered her she would take that and like a Proverbs 31 Woman she would she would she would make it grow she would flourish it it would probably even do better than what his portion of the Kingdom would do and yet it would all be his it would be theirs Partners as the scripture said it would be partners it would be it wasn't hurt trying to do her own thing and get her own Glory separate from the husband it was something we're a family unit we're we're a family and I'm a reflection of this man and so anything that I do what I say that is going to reflect him and so I want to make it grow I want to make it Prosper I want to bring him glory it would be an extension and a reflection of his Rule and it would have been ruled well are you with me tonight we're doing good on time he knew she would be supportive of what God gave him to do this man didn't know God except through Esther and yet the scripture said that God appoints Kings so whether this man knew God or not God gave him his position so he knew she would be supportive of what he was to do whatever God caused your husband to he calls you two with him if he equips the man now listen I want to I want to encourage you tonight because whatever your husband has been called to do whether it don't matter from from preacher to to from Pastor to evangelist to to missionary to Deacon the trustee to janitor to going to work every day and living a Godly life at your job doesn't matter you don't have to have a position you be the best Christian you can be whatever God's given you to do and and sister whatever God has called that man to do he's called you to do with him so if God equips that man to do a work for the Lord he's going to equip you too so so don't fear whatever it is if he gets up and goes to work every day you'll be equipped to to meet that man's needs to send him to work every day with a lunch just got real quiet you sisters do send your husband to work with a lunch right feed the man it'll win his heart if he's been called to the ministry you've been called with him God will equip that man and God will equip you too whatever this man however this man's been called to serve in the kingdom of God amen Queen asked her to love God more than she loved the king and through that love she could love her husband correctly you sisters should love your love God more than you love your husbands you husbands should love God more than you love your wives because if you live that way you'll love them right you'll love your spouse right you'll love your children right if you're not married it doesn't matter you love God more than you love the people who you go to church with right and you'll love those people right now one of the things that and and I want to make sure I give them all the credit here brother Jack Duff he read through a Proverbs 31 Woman and and broke it down by verse and and I just thought it was beautiful and so some of the things I wanted to say about Esther I just stuck in here and I want to bring it to the to your sisters proverbs 31 10 says just summarizing each verse says she is rare a Proverbs 31 Woman is where don't try to be something that you see in a magazine or online you sisters you know we live in such a wicked age and and Esther would have been in the time in this Palace where this man had one of the largest harems probably of any of these empires of these Kings so there were maybe hundreds maybe maybe thousands of women that she would have had to have felt maybe that she had to compete with and I imagine not all of them are Jewish so not all of them have Godly standards so not all of them are dressing modest I imagine that many of them who went in before the king dressed very sensual to try to appeal to the king so you imagine this woman Queen Esther living in this kind of a day and I and I imagine because the scripture says that he he could call on any of these anyone in this in his Harem at any time if if he desired but Esther being a Jew knew that she she wanted to be the one and only so Esther would have been dressing modest she would have she would have done these things and yet all the women around her would have been scantily dressed probably hardly covered and then we bring that into today and you sisters you should you should you probably I assume that you probably feel like you're competing with worldly women and the way that worldly women dress and the way that worldly women look that's okay you don't have to say Amen I'm gonna preach anyway I imagine that you feel that way if I put myself in your shoes that would be how I feel to see these women around you to see to see what what men what what what men are being attracted to to see what the scripture says that the sons of God saw the daughters of men were were Fair and they and they fell by him and you sisters you see that today you see where pornography is on a rampant you see where and listen I want to say this you man we you know better we we've told you enough you know better than to look at pornography you know better than the than the than the stare you know better shame on us if we're still doing it God help us if we're still doing it but your sisters remember you're a tabernacle for these men you're a tabernacle for your husband you're you're uh you're you're a you're a shelter from these things so for one thing let me just think of how to say this and I because I'm not trying to say it harshly but but be Godly but be attractive for your husband amen uh maybe it was somebody back there could say Amen hello amen be attractive for your husband not competing I'm not saying compete for your husband but I I want to say this too because I was thinking about this today and it's not to give the man a license to sin okay that's not what I'm saying I'm saying pray for your man can I get a louder amen pray for your man I want to say have Grace for your man but I'm not I'm not saying have Grace and is a license to sin you know sometimes you have to have tough love and you have to show tough love and you have to say knock it off choose her or choose me but you only have one of us I'm going to say Amen to myself a little bit louder so I feel better about what I'm saying right now can you can you say Amen or am I completely off have Grace for him have he we're living in an age brother Jared was talking about the mind and the brain and the way that the the brain remembers things and and Lord willing Lord help me I want to bring a little bit more about that because Satan has so calculated his his tactics nowadays that the the brain can be so affected by what we see and by even even as a as a young boy if pornography was presented to to a young boy a a young girl even that so imprints in that in that memory bank of of those brains it literally changes the brain it literally takes the brain you can take a you can take a a a a porn addict and put it next to a heroin addict and the brain looks the same it literally starts a brain under under scan should be solid it should it should be smooth and when you take when you take a man who's feeding on wrong images or you take a man or woman who's who's on heroin and they're addicted uh uh you you start getting deformity in the brain and you start getting literal holes in the brain and what those holes are are where the brain actually shuts off to to give feed to another part of the brain that's that's being fed more it literally shuts that off so on a scan it shows a hole pray for one another because this

raised up and and to to to enter in the ministry preaching to you you guys have made it so easy I know I know you know we'll joke and we get it's it's our nervousness as preachers you know we'll joke and amen to ourselves and you know fear not their faces and things but I just want to say you guys have been the most gracious and and I just I love you and thank you where was I Esther was in the palace okay so we said that we'll skip that but I just want to repeat myself in saying that when the king saw Esther among all the other women that he could have chosen when your husband seen you out of all the women that he could have chosen he chose you that King chose Esther out of every woman that there was in that Palace out of every woman who dressed to appeal to the king Esther came in with her Purity and that's who a heathen King chose proverbs 31 11 she is trustworthy verse 12 she's constant in her love goes back to what we said about this evil age says be constant in your love verse 13 she's industrious she's which means she's diligent and hard-working one of the things brother Jack said and I just thought it was so amazing and I and I thought you know you you young sisters don't sit by and be idle and wait for a husband go do something Ruth was found in the field working when Boaz found her he said Rebecca was working when leaser founder and this was astounding to me because he did the math I guess or something but he said Rebecca when she offered to give Eliezer a drink did I say that right Eliezer okay when she offered to give him a drink and he prayed Lord if that's her then let her water my camels too brother Jack did the math and she would have had to have hauled up 200 gallons of water to water the camels she was hard working don't be idle waiting for a husband sis do do something she's Thrifty using money and other resources carefully and not wastefully and all of us husbands can smile because we know the word thrifting I'm gonna go thrifting you you use money and resources carefully and not wastefully when you Thrift um it's just how often do you Thrift verse 15 she's a self-starter verse 16 she's enterprising which means having or showing initiative and resourcefulness she'll find ways to get something done I I admire that about your sisters and when I'm reading these I'm not saying that I'm not listen to me I'm not saying you don't have these qualities I'm saying you have these qualities I'm so thankful I was I was thinking as I was studying this and I was saying Lord there's I'm thinking of every sister in the church just now

qualities in each of you sisters I see the potential in you you say well I don't feel like I'm there yet will you have the quality in you you have the Potentials in you you are a Proverbs 31 Woman don't don't carry yourself downtrodden don't carry yourself like you're anything less you are a Proverbs 31 Woman all you sisters say I am a Proverbs 31 Woman thank you sister Jane she caught what the preacher's saying you should get up every morning and look in the mirror and say I am a Proverbs 31 Woman I don't care what you feel about yourself get up tomorrow morning go home and before you go to bed look in the mirror so so husband when you hear your wife saying this you say Amen from the other room sis look in the mirror tonight when you go to bed and say I am a Proverbs 31 Woman when you wake up in the morning say I am a Proverbs 31 Woman if if you don't feel like you're pretty go stand in the mirror and say I am pretty I am beautiful I am listen I'll give you a scripture for that you want a scripture you don't feel pretty God said that you're fearfully and wonderfully made God said that you're a beautiful Branch unto the Lord I feel good about what I'm saying so verse 17 she's willing to do hard work Verse 18 she's willing to work long hours if she has to that's rough but sisters if if you don't have children if you're not married yet then then go talk to the older ones or go talk to the married ones go talk to the ones with children you are an on time 24 7. that that's your job 24 7 on call when the kid comes and wakes up he won't wake up daddy he'll wake up Mommy uh verse 19 she's willing to do monotonous work you know why I hate laundry because it's always there you know why I hate dishes because it's always there a man I'm maybe not all men are this way but I like to do something see it get done and move on to something else that sister is the it's just always there the the pile I she can get caught up and at the end of the day there's something there a proverbs 31 is willing to do monotonous work thank you sisters for doing the monotonous work uh verse 20 she's compassionate 21 she's prepared for the future 22 good seamstress uh 23 married to a leader and I added this she's married to a leader she's not married marrying to lead we talked about that with vashti so I'm going to leave that alone verse 24 she's an entrepreneur a person who organizes and operates a business you say well I I'm not business-minded when you have your own home you'll need to organize and operate it efficiently and effectively you'll manage the employees your children you'll manage the the place of business your house all while the CEO is bringing in the bacon and I just thought I would add this brother you better be bringing in the bacon this is a Proverbs 31 Woman you better provide for that woman if you don't the scripture says you're worse than an Infidel and if this is how God sees these women I can understand why if you're not providing for that Proverbs 31 Woman God looks at you you're treating his beautiful Branch awful get up young guy get a get a career get a get a get a job first of all get a trade get an education something that's going to provide for your home later on don't be lazy listen I know some people they get into these things and they can make money playing Guitar Hero and everything else don't do something honorable please you're not going to make money playing video games more than likely you're not good enough I just let you have it brother get off the video games get off your lazy backside and go get a job I don't know who that was for but that felt good too verse 25 she's not swayed by circumstances and he said something brother Jack did and I just thought was profound because we can we can belittle the women we can say she doesn't have the faith of a man I know a lot of women who have more faith than men but she's not swayed by circumstances God could have destroyed Sarah brother Jack brought out because she laughed in the tent at what God Said she laughed at first but at some point she caught the revelation and she caught the faith because she's in the book of Hebrews and it doesn't say she didn't believe it says she believed so she's not swayed by circumstances she's the emotional being she'll seem like she's swayed but I've seen women when they they're emotional at first and they seem swayed and yet they come around they swing around and their faith kicks in so don't belittle her brother you ought to lead her into faith if she's struggling I feel good about saying this so somebody needs it thank you I got I got two she needs she needs lead you you are to be her leader lead her in the faith don't belittle her lead her in the faith where's your leadership where's your faith that's strong enough to lead you that your wife can latch on to your faith I feel good verse 26 wise and kind 27 she's Duty conscious I thought of Esther Esther sacrificed her life for her people she was Duty conscious it goes back to she's not swayed by circumstances Sarah laughed at first but she caught the Revelation Esther was afraid at first but she caught the revelation she went before the king when she could have lost her life she was she was Duty conscious 28 she's blessed by her family 29 she's not satisfied with mediocre mediocre means it's it's mediocre's moderate it's it's ordinary it's medium it's it's fair or to say it bluntly it's not very good quality she's not satisfied with with not very good quality you still with me I'm almost done verse 30 woman of God in verse 31 she's praiseworthy brother she's worthy of your praise sister you should carry yourself praiseworthy worthy of his praise but brother give her a little bit of praise it'll go a long way give her give her some words of affirmation I've got a quote and then I'm done you can stand to your feet you don't have this in the back so I'm just going to read it so but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown she should be honored my mother's a woman my wife is and they're lovely and I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect but if they can respect what uh but if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen you say brother Brandon why are you typing me with Queen Esther because we had a prophet in this day listen if your husband if we're to be called Kings and Priests you're called to be a queen if your husband's called to be a king that makes you a queen brother Branham said if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she is a good wife this is this is your value sis but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a crown but an ornery one or no good one as water in his blood and that's right it's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you've got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do that a real woman and children if you've got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean sends you to school oh now we're talking to the kids respect your mommy sends you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother she's a real wife she's a queen brother that woman should be the queen of your heart another thing brother brother Jack said that brother Branham comments somewhere and he says I wish you'd have I wish I wish something along the lines of I wish you could have a wife like mine you you single Brothers I wish you could have a wife like mine you husband should be able to say I wish you could have a wife like mine amen amen brother Joe I I have nothing on my mind to sing right now so you can come on up why he's coming let's just let's just pray and and while we pray you who are here you who are listening in you who will hear this later especially you women if you're struggling with your self-worth and your self-image and and who God Made You your personality then I I want to pray for you because you are a beautiful branch of the Lord you are a Proverbs 31 Woman sis if you don't have the holy ghost seek it with all your heart don't seek a man seek God seek it with all your heart so you can be a Proverbs 31 Woman but I just think we live in such a dark time and and for brothers and sisters alike but I just I just think of the pressure on on sisters while I'm studying this the pressure that had to be on Queen Esther so I want to pray for you so let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and Lord I know God I a little jokey tonight but I pray father that these sisters especially I pray God that they would catch your heart I pray that they would see themselves through your eyes and I pray Lord that these brothers would look at these women right I pray that you would help me to look at them right to look at my wife right [Music] Lord we live in a Time father where If we're honest pornography has probably been flashed before everybody's eyes [Music] Satan Lord as as I've just heard different things of how the the brain works and how how social media affects us how pornography affects us I think you devil what a devil to know that and to pray on the minds and to try to get it to young people to children what a devil that we're fighting in this age but father you said through all of that we would be victorious we would come out more than conquer so Lord I'm praying for every sister every sister who would hear this every sister who wouldn't hear this I pray for them Lord that you would let Revelation strike their their heart God not not just their mind but strike their heart Lord that it would give them a sound mind it would it would clarify things in their mind but Lord Let It Strike their heart tonight God that they are a Proverbs 31 Woman that they have the potential inside of them that they they are the beautiful branch of the Lord that they are a woman that's to be praised that they are the good thing that a man can find they are the reason a man would find favor with the Lord they are the fountain that a man is to drink from his own fountain that he's to be if I'm not mistaken using the word wrong I believe it's to be ravished in her love that man is supposed to be so in love with his wife I pray God that you would be that you would come and you would speak to the broken marriages that you would speak to the broken homes that you would speak to the Brokenhearted that you would speak to the to the the week in mind the the that Satan's tormenting father I pray with all my heart now with the authority of your word behind me Lord the Bible before me the gospel I pray for these sisters in this age I pray for these brothers in this age grant us your grace we need your grace we love you Lord thank you for the time in your word now we pray in Jesus name amen amen take the word of the Lord God bless you we love you let us know if you
