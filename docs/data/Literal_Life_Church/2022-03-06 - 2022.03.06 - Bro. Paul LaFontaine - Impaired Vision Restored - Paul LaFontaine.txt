========================================

and verse 22 and he cometh to bethesda and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and he led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought so we know there was another incident where jesus spit on some mud and clay and put it in the eyes and i don't know all the science behind this and i don't know i would have to research it to see what was happening but it doesn't matter how the lord does it as long as it gets the results okay that seems kind of dirty to do something like that but this is what he did he spit in the man's eyes and then he touched his eyes and then he asked him i want you to notice now he asked him if he saw all and he looked up and he said i see men as trees walking so his his vision had cleared up a bit but it wasn't perfectly clear yet it just was it was still impaired and so he's seen more but he's seen men as trees and after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly and we can say amen i'd like to speak this morning on impaired vision restored heavenly father we are standing dependent on you this morning and there's only one great one among us lord and that's you we're aware that you're here among us and we we welcome you we've invited you but it's not just that we invite you we welcome you lord you have your place in our hearts today you have your sway with us we trust you lord that you will give us a word from you that would be beneficial to help us along this journey lord because you know all things there isn't anything hidden from you you know our background you know our trials you know wherever we've been we know what god is to this place today and lord because of that we can trust you as a mighty god that if you know our past so clearly then you must know our future too and lord we remember in the prayer lines of the prophet where by vision you could take a man and he could see a person in the doctor's office and a person when they were a child and different incidences that there was no way that a man could know that but you knew it you knew every incident everything and you showed the prophet by vision and lord often the prophet would say don't you think that the god that knows your past and can tell me those things is the same god that knows your future and sees you healed in the name of the lord jesus christ so lord it it it just settles our hearts this morning and we pray that you'll take us that you'll move upon us lord and it shall teach us your ways lord may it be more than an intellectual exercise but lord may lives be transformed by your holy spirit that's here lord may barriers be broken down lord may deliverance come to all of us lord for we need your help at this time lord if someone's feeling shaky from the times that we live in i pray that the peace that passes all understanding would come to their hearts today lord we remember our ukrainian brothers and sisters the russian brothers and sisters all the ukrainian people all of that country lord we remember in prayer lord you hand would guide it we know that prophecy is no doubt being fulfilled but lord watch over put your people into your wings lord i pray and bring this them through this we commit them to you we commit our lives to you and we're glad to be here fellowshipping together to be in the right place at the right time in jesus name we ask him amen amen shake somebody's hand and before you're seated and greet them in the name of the lord amen this text about jesus healing a blind man at this particular part about jesus touching him again it just moves me to see that jesus would not leave this man with a partial vision there's something about jesus that and you know this the scripture that says he who hath begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete the work and what i find is if there's a lot of stuff in between that then god can pick it up again and god when he all he has to do is touch the situation again can you say man but it moves me that he he touched him again and so we could safely say that if you're not fully restored jesus can touch you again if your heart was touched by jesus as a child he can touch you again if you had a good beginning with the lord and a lot of stuff has happened since then i'm here to tell you this morning he can touch you again [Applause] if you had eyesight to see clearly maybe when you were young and you got blinded by the things of the world or blinded by false teaching or blinded by anything else if you had good eyesight but something happened to blind you i'm here to tell you he christ can touch your eyes again how many believe that this morning [Applause] it's the eyes it's the eyes in this incident that he was touching because of the blindness of this man it's the eyes he was touching and i want you to ponder that it was the eyes because the eyes in the scripture have a lot of references of course when he came he was physically healing blindness but the eyes the one scripture says is the gate to the soul the eyes is a very important thing not just naturally but also spiritually as well and most the time in scripture when he speaks of the eyes he's speaking of a spiritual perception to be able to see christ clearly to be able to see prophecy clary uh you know there's a message called moderate events made clear by prophecy that means god wants to make it clear spiritually to you what's happening in world events today god makes wants to make it clear it may not be clear to politicians but to believers it's clear we look this is our glasses we look through the eyes of the word can you say amen that's why we're not afraid this morning that's not why that's why we're not scared can you say about that's why we're at peace because we're not looking through the eyes of politicians and trying to figure it out we're looking through a word that's already prophesied things to take place spiritual eyesight is an important thing and so now here jesus opens up the blinded eyes and i wanted to ask you do you believe that jesus can do this again do you believe that jesus can open up the blinded eyes he did it back then and nobody has a right to say he can't do it again we have people suffering in the church with some blindness i'm still believing god's going to open their eyes i believe if he could do it then he can do it now but you see now we see that's we we believe that he can do that i've actually seen it as a young child i was in a service and god blessed me to be able to see a man who went blind and uh some of the people in this assembly were there if that service i was just a boy but i'm so glad god will allow me to see i know this can happen i believe god can do it i believe he can raise the dead i believe he can heal cancer i believe he can heal any disease i believe god can do anything still today i believe god is able and there's nothing impossible for god to do he hasn't changed but you see now when i was a little boy there was a man that went blind in the church i don't know how long he had been completely blind but i was privileged to see the minister lay hands on him that he struck a dance there and he shouted around the entire building quite a few times that afternoon his eyes were completely open and i was i was down in the front when the minister said i was as a young boy looking up i watched his eyes come open and him take off and run around the church i can tell you god can heal the blinded eyes i'm so glad but you know blessed is he who's not seeing yet believes blessed is he if you haven't seen that god wants you to believe anyway he's able to do it but i want to say this this morning the worst kind of blindness is spiritual blindness i said the worst blindness is spiritual blindness the worst kind of blindness is spiritual blindness or to be spiritually your vision spiritually impaired by something that you can't see clearly and more importantly you can't see christ clearly you can't see christ clearly and if you have that condition i i believe jesus can touch your eyes just as he touched this man's eyes if you if your spiritual vision is impaired i believe god can touch your eyes and you can see everything clear and the best thing you can see claire is to see jesus and it's amazing now that this man he had a touch he had the the spit that come in his eyes and jesus rubbed his eyes and then jesus touched him and he could see better but it wasn't totally clear yet and he said that he's seen men jesus said how's your eyes now how is your vision now and he said i can see a little better because i can see but the men looked like trees and the lord said well it's not completely done yet the lord didn't walk away and leave him with a fuzzy vision and he won't do that this morning praise the lord he didn't say well that's that's that's that's going to be if that's good enough he didn't say that's good enough he said i need to touch this man again because god's interested in him having a a completely clear vision and so he's seen men because because first of all this might just be practical but seeing men as trees is not normal okay you don't want to leave a man like that where he's seeing men as trees if he sees them as trees just if he sees men just like trees he might chop him down someday i wonder if impaired vision causes us not to see people right amen amen i wonder if impaired vision either from our past or from our past hurts our past pains i wonder if it can impair how we look at people i wonder if it causes us to not see people right and even see people within the church correctly i'm prepared for to get quiet right now as i talk about these things i wonder if is that that why we get so incredibly angry at people sometimes i wonder if that's why when someone does you wrong and you say you never you're never or ever going to speak to them again i know none of you have ever said that before but there are people that say they did me wrong they're finished that's done i'm never going to speak to them again i wonder if it causes it it's the cause that you don't see them as flawed human beings with a soul like you but you see them as something other than that this man seen men as trees and i'm trying to show that that's a type i wonder if impaired vision causes us not to see people right to not see them as a flawed human being with a soul like you because you're a flawed human being amen only by the grace of god in his blood that we can call ourselves perfect it's only through his eyes can you say amen and i'm interested in seeing myself through his eyes not the eyes of you not the eyes of myself but through god's vision and it's only through the blood of jesus christ that brother adam says when he looks at you he doesn't see your past he doesn't see what you've done he doesn't see your flaws he sees you through the blood of jesus christ and that's the only way he can see you perfect that's a clear vision can you say amen hallelujah and that's why the first time that jesus looked to somebody through his eyes with blood coming down the first time he looked at somebody through the blood he said you'll be saved today because he said remember me when you come into paradise and he said today you'll be with me in paradise never been baptized never had a chance to do all that that's how powerful it is when jesus looks through his blood that's how he sees the individual amen and i believe friends that we don't see people right sometimes and we don't see them as uh the way we should see them because of impaired visions we we see them we don't see them as faulty a flawed human being with a soul and if we don't see them correctly then we see people i don't know as monsters or or robots he's seen him as trees but we see people as monsters the person who did remo wrong or robots or morons or jerks i don't know what terms you have for it or just some tree to cut down eventually and so i would say to you that our vision is impaired our vision is clouded can you say a man and not only and i'll speak of this not only as our vision impaired of christ sometimes but because our vision of christ is impaired we don't see him right then we don't see other people right now i'm going to just read a couple things to you because in the message standing in the gap um brother branham our prophet went through something after during the seals and just after that and he didn't bring it out clearly and confess it until standing in the gap and by cause confess i mean he was being honest about something he was going through internally and that is he built up a complex he said people he was preaching things the people weren't listening to him they were continuing on getting worse and worse when he went into certain areas but he kept preaching but it was building a complex that he said you know what i'm tired of this you know what i did something in him was was giving up something made his complex say i'm just not going to go anymore i'm going to give up i'm going to go up north i'm going to become a trapper i'm getting ready to leave i won't tell my wife we'll just do it at the top of the hat we'll jump in the car and go i'm finished with ministry and all this was building up because because he had built up a complex and when he comes to stand in the gap he confesses that god had to correct him about his feeling of the people god had to correct him because i'll say it this way he was not viewing these rebellious people correctly he could not help them if he viewed them the wrong way amen and he says in that message if you guys pull up the quote and these rickey's and ricketts because that's what he called them these ricky's and raketas that have so sassed the words and i've called them ricky and ricketta god give me to understand i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that spirit upon them and they're in much they're in much in prison as israel was in prison just as much as moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love jesus christ would serve him if they only know what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't do this and don't do that and what he means by that is it's just a religion don't do this don't do this and you're fine come to church sign shake the preacher's hand sign our membership card dress yourself up with some holiness churches if we can just get them dressed up on the outside and make them wear the right thing then you're a member you're good everything's fine that's religion that's not the power of the holy ghost come on i should get more amens to that it's denominationalism that says if you do this and do this and don't do this and know this you're saved it's fine you're going in a rapture i say that's a lie we don't want religion we want the power of the holy spirit to change our desires we're not about making the message even a religion here even though god has given us more specifics how a believer should live but it has to come through true salvation a heart that says i need you i can't go anywhere else i cry out i humble my pride god forgive me of my sins and start with salvation and then say lord after i'm baptized fill me with the holy spirit there isn't no back door to all of this there isn't no i was raised in it and then i'm okay because i'm raised in it there isn't anything like that to come up some other way and say i'm okay because my parents were in the message you need salvation you need a a a experience with christ yourself and you need the holy spirit and that'll change your desires towards the things of god in the word you'll be in the word because you crave the word of god and the things of the world become strangely dim when you're seeing jesus right am i being real with you amen they they take these souls and they're in slavery because denomination that tells them don't do this and don't do that but the call of god must come the call in a person's life must come through him becoming real to the person there was another place he says here at standing in the gap and i wanted his prayer at the end god bless you each one and we hope to see you again real soon till then will you do this one favor for me now both here and on the tapes also my brother pray that god will place into my heart that something that i lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex later on he says yeah don't lose the feeling of the people he's admitting that even as a holy ghost believer even as a prophet he had lost his feeling for the people and i think if a prophet can go through that and god have to correct him and he gets impaired vision because he's not seeing these people right if a prophet went through that i know that we do come on come on all you holy people raise your hand i know that we do it if a prophet can do it i'm not here to belittle the prophet or put him down i'm gonna say he's real about his mistakes he's real about what he goes through and even a believer can get impaired vision and not see people right he's seen people men as trees just trees but they're not trees and i love this last statement in his he said don't lose the feeling of people see you must remember they're not made out of stock sawdust they are flesh and blood human beings and a soul amen amen can i go further amen so not seeing things as well as god would like to you to see people is an important thing to god god touched his eyes and he looked at those ricky rickies different than he ever looked at him before he had more grace in his heart he had more prayer in his heart he had more uh a ministry in his heart to say i'm looking at these people wrong and it's making him withdraw himself because he's not looking at him they're just ricky's they they've sown their last seed they're finished and none of us have a right to say anybody's finished not even a prophet his attitude had changed he's still a believer but his attitude his vision had become impaired and it's like these guys are just rebellious and they i come and preach the word and they do the opposite they get worse and worse every year that i come and his heart began to just kind of write him off amen amen his vision become impaired god and his grace had to come do correction surgery on his eyesight amen amen seeing things right seeing god's people right seeing jesus right is crucial it's easy to see where the prophet was corrected on this but what about us what about our impaired vision of people this morning we think sometimes we're so much better than everyone else the bible says everyone is righteous in their own eyes everyone is doing good it's interesting when we give our testimony and give our where we're at we most of the time come out smelling like a rose not that bad of a person i'm not that you see but we need people to be honest about where they're at the same is honest god is honest about us can you say amen he'll give us the true diagnosis and when you get to the truth then you can be free because the bible says ye shall know the truth and the truth will set you free if you cover over and say i'm a good person on the inside i would do this and i would give to the ukrainians and i would do that and i would do that but i'm not going to talk to those other believers in my own church but i'll give to all these other needs strangers that you don't know praise the lord god bless you for it but it's interesting to me that you would give to strangers like that and can't even fellowship with your own congregation [Applause] can't have communion with your own local congregation i'll go on and read some more he says in another place here uh in a message here on the road not long ago coming up from a trip in the mountains someone was said here take these glasses and look over here a certain thing well i picked up the glasses i saw three or four different objects now you see i know that there was something wrong with that see now this antelope standing in the field there seemed to be three or four of them standing there but what it was the antelope was just perfectly one antelope the the glass was all right what i had to do was to draw that focus till i got all three of the antelopes into one and made one antelope see later on he says we don't need an organization i have nothing against them but the damage that they do to pull people out and separate brotherhood and things but we only need to look at one thing and that's our substitute that's right that substitute is jesus christ in this message he goes back to cain and abel he talks about wars he talks about jealousy how all this started was a jealousy from cain to abel because abel had the right sacrifice cain did not have the right one and jealousy started up and that's how he killed him and murdered him all wars start with jealousy all wars come because there's something wrong in the heart of man and he says that happened because abel had the right sacrifice it was a blood sacrifice it wasn't something he concocted himself he said that's our problem today that's why we have division today that's why we have fusses with one another that's why we have things that and men just draw inside themselves that's why we have denominations that's why the devil's always trying to fight to divide the people of god and it all starts with jealousies and not seeing jesus right not seeing our sacrifice at calvary and if we would all focus to one thing seeing jesus right then all that division starts to go away [Music] we knew we don't need an organization i have nothing against that the damage that you do to pull people out and separate brotherhood and things but we only need to look at one thing and that's our substitute that's right and that substitute is jesus christ aren't you glad you got a substitute this morning and then today you see how we twist it out in organizations and they say the mess of this is having a revival of course that don't mean the baptist that's the methodist and they're having a revival and so forth and they cut the other fella out all the time but we don't want to see it that way we want to keep pulling that focus till we find out that there's one god when you see three of them out there you better focus the glass a little better you're seeing something wrong you better bring it in and find out that there's one god over us all and he's the god of the human race and he if he's if he's got it all he's interested in every human being because it's his creation and he's interested in the children he's interested in the old age and the middle age he's interested in the color in the colors of us the white the brown the black the yellow and the different shades of our skin from the country that we come from of our forefather he's interested in all of us he's just not interested in the jews alone or the yellow race or black race of white rice whatever it is he's interested in the whole human race and trying to get the human race to focus his word down to one thing and say there's no racism in the spirit of the lord amen there's no prejudice in the spirit of the lord can you say amen there's no looking at some man that has a soul and looking down on him he has the potential to receive god and that's the way we should look at him and we would say well he'll never receive it they left so they they shot their last while they're finished we don't have a right to say that because my god is real your god is real don't write them off and say that's that's you know i don't have to uh minister to that person because they're they we can't do that we have to see it right and he's interested in the whole human race all lives matter amen amen all souls matter to god praise the lord that's what man has tried to do down through the years is trying to get the other fella out of the way when we ought to bring try to be bringing the other fella in the way with him and be a brother you see instead of trying to say oh that little group just rake them out and this over here oh well they are this and that and we label people we put people in categories and we label them out and and all this is be coming because we're not focused to see jesus right i know this might be a simple message to some of you believers but i'm doing it anyway because it's still a problem even in some of our ranks if there's problems like we have sometimes it's because you're not seeing jesus right and this message reveals jesus christ it's so that we can see jesus not through the lens of a denominational creed and dogma but to see jesus clearly and when we see him clearly without the without the cloudiness of our past without the cloudiness of how somebody has hurt us but we say lord forgive me and let me forgive them as they forgive me and get past it lay it down just let me see jesus and when you see him clearly you see everybody else more clear [Applause] hallelujah we should hope bring the whole thing to one solid picture and that's jesus christ can you say amen i'm still reading from there we should bring the whole thing to one solid picture and that is jesus christ you guys still have that quote leave it up if you would it goes on to say a little thing and i always like to read this i know it's a little lengthy but i want you to look at this next next paragraph it starts with a young lady last night if you guys could pull that up a young lady last night in an interview she said she said a minister's and it was a minister's daughter had some kind of a little love affair and she had lost her mind about it she'd gone a breakdown had a nervous breakdown very beautiful young woman about 23 years old it was a spiritual heart trouble her lover had run off and married some other woman and yet she was still in love and this boy telling her that he was in love yet with her he'd already married somebody else he's playing playing along with her too and his father had caused it and i said oh nonsense he didn't have to marry that other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you that's exactly but see being all wound up into that the girl sat there in such a stoop she's in an insane institution over a love affair that failed if if someone's going mental like that then that can't be true love something wrong she's in a mental state and he failed he says no i wish you guys could get that up maybe we lost that but you see being all the girl all wound up into that the girl is in such a stoop like and she said oh i know johnny loves me i know he loves me he's already married to another woman i know she's just holding on to that and the way brother bryan explained to see that's all she could see this trial this broken love affair impaired her vision it's a christian girl in church it's a kid grow up in crit in church and a love affair and a so-called love affair the thing that wasn't right so affected her spirit and impaired her vision that the only thing she could see is this lie that he loves me he still loves me he still loves me and she's being led along like a carrot on a stick into something that wasn't true at all she's so consumed by it she's lost her vision of jesus she's lost her vision of jesus and so being all wound up in that he failed to find where i'm at here she said he said that's all she could see she lived in that one little world by herself she had formed herself in there that's some of the most powerful words i don't preach psychology as any alternative for the gospel but god knows human beings and the way he says this that she when she kept in that mindset and she only seen that one thing it formed herself all by herself it formed herself into this bondage she wasn't seeing things right anymore and she formed herself in there and i'll tell you people get so formed and so bounded into this the only way they see things the only they never get past it and some things are so deep it just takes the power and love and grace of god to reach down and say grab my hand grab my hand because you're not seeing things right now and i'll pull you up here so you can see things more clearly how many has ever had god do that for you see the testimonies amen yes because our vision gets impaired sometimes this was so serious he's there and so now he for she formed herself in there and she lived in that little world by herself interesting this is so typical of so many of us when we get into a world all to ourself and we form ourselves in this thing that's all we can see we just see that and it ruins us for life because we can't see nothing else and i took a hold of her hand i said listen to me and the lord showed a vision you see that she knowed i know nothing about and he said it to you that's something that had taken place some transaction between the two of them and when that was said then that snapped her right quick so by a vision something she knew that he wouldn't have known about the lord says it through him and that jolted her it shook her sometimes we need a jolt sometimes we need god to shake us can i get an amen this morning and it's god's grace to shake us and wake us up because our vision is impaired we're starting to see things and we're starting to get cloudy and everything's looking bad and the church is looking bad and everything and sometimes god needs to shake us i pray god would shake us this morning jolt us because if we're not coming to church to see jesus we're coming for the wrong reason and here's and i have to slow down and just read this here's how he says it now he said now she snapped right quick and i said while you're out here out of there so she's like she comes out of this world he says while you're out of there look to calvary there you're going out there and you started to drink and a minister's daughter a pentecostal minister's daughter and doing things that you're doing trying to drown that sorrow man she's with insane she's out going against what she's been taught she's out drinking because people do that to drown their sorrows instead of turning to the lord it's a no-brainer we know why people do that right you know don't accuse people of doing that because that's the only satisfaction they have because they haven't learned about the true satisfaction in christ yet that's why they turn to those things and so he says you you're drowning your sorrow the man and somebody that don't care a snap of their finger for you and i said look younger calvary girl that's the only way back we've got to get ourselves focused to whether we live or die sink or drown it's calvary christ that's the thing that god wants us to come back to and men in the focus of god's word instead of bringing it together and making it say one thing that god makes us say we look at the natural side later on he says we won't have nothing to do with the rest of them i'm not going to fellowship with them we won't have anything to do with it and that see that's the first thing is presented instead of focusing in to know that it's brotherly love that we should have one for another and to understand one another and to love one another and to worship with one another they degrade a man because of his clothes that he wears or the education that he has or the color of his skin or something like that can anybody see that the prophet is fagging the problems in this nation right now in the 1960s they bring up racism now that spirit raises up again that's the problem the problem is racism i'll tell you the problem goes much deeper than that can you say man every human being without god has the potential to be racist to murder to do all these things wrong it's not one race or one color another that has that more than others no friend it's the problem with god not being in the heart of that man and that's why when i come into junior high school and i realized there was the preppies and they're the ones that weren't there weren't the preppies and guess what i wasn't a preppy i tried to go to kmart and buy a cheap alligator shirt because everybody was wearing alligators then i couldn't afford them at dillard's so i came i found my answer i found a shirt with an alligator on it it wasn't the real brand but i thought i could get by with it dad i gotta have that shirt i got that shirt i wore it because why there was so much of this spirit of putting down if you got a little funny ears or funny nose or your different color and all this and it wasn't just one race or one group that was doing it it was everywhere because why man without god will look at other human beings and belittle them and put them down and find your i don't have to be around you the first time i experienced it i was pretty sheltered until then i realized wow this is how the world functions maybe that's why i got a heart then for the one who wasn't a preppy because i wasn't crappy i wore that alligator shirt and they still put me down because they knew it came from kmart i knew right away i tried my hardest to be accepted i tried to get the right clothes and i'm doing it all because that's what's in the heart of man is put people into categories it's just upon how good-looking you are and how much money you have and what neighborhood you live in and i can deal with that out there but when that starts to come into church i just start to get real righteous ignition you can't fellowship with somebody because of what they wear or because they act a little quirky they're a little nerdy amen i think it's sad there's only one answer for it when you see the blood of jesus christ it washes all that away when you see christ right you see human beings right amen you see the way god sees them can you say amen so i experienced that there but i get so upset when i see it creep in to the church i tell you friends i stand with every believer here this morning no matter how quirky they are no matter what they've been through no matter what past they've had no matter what they're wearing amen amen if they're loving god and trying i stand with them don't you dare put them down amen we don't have nothing to do with the rest of them that's like the first thing is presented instead of focusing on brotherly love we should have one for another to understand one another to love one another to worship with one another they did great a man becomes close he wears and the education he has the color of his skin or something like that or that therefore it separates people and men take off of that it never gives i love this statement too it never gives the inward man a chance to operate when you're seeing things right you're operating every day from the inward man not this right here not your not your head that those quotes are in victory day if you want to read them a few weeks ago i preached on peter james and john being welcomed up to the mountain with jesus when they got up there they seen moses and elijah there talking with jesus and then i'll just summarize real quickly you can go back and listen if you want but it was really effective to me to be able to see that when after it it showed the disciples that moses and elijah moses represented the law elijah represented the prophets and all the law and all the prophets revealed a mystery and that's jesus christ the mystery christ so you couldn't see jesus right without knowing that the mystery of him is revealed in the law and the prophets don't dump out the law don't dump out the prophets but when it was all over with okay and peter wanted to build tabernacles and this is exciting we'll build three type of girls no no no no he's quickly interrupted no no we're not going to build three places of worship here and then as soon as he said that moses and elijah fade away and the only thing they could see is jesus every person needs that experience and even if you read the word for years and read your bible and read the message at the end of it all if you don't see more of jesus because you see this all fade away someday once jesus is revealed to you can you say mom this reveals jesus christ but once you see jesus it's an experience it's an experience it's not an intellectual conception of jesus it's meeting him and the only seeing jesus and i said something in that service i want to say again it's come to back to me and it's become even more real and i've said it already today i'm going to say it again when we see jesus right it's the answer to all things it's the deliverance for all things we live in a world of psychology we live in the world the problem i have with psychology is not that they can't diagnose a human being they've had six thousand years to diagnose a human being they get pretty good at it they can peg a human being in his nature how he thinks his behavior from his thinking they can peg it pretty good god can peg it more than anybody but the one problem i have with psychology is they think they have the answer to correct man amen they didn't create man so they don't have the answer it takes the power and reality of the lord jesus christ to come on the scene to change a man how many can say amen to that and so it it it's it's when we see jesus right it brings deliverance when we see jesus right it's the answer to all things there's no way we can be let me say it this way and and please uh know that i love you this morning and i'm being straight but please know if there's no way we can be looking at him correctly and have division there's no way we can be looking at jesus right and have strife and have habits and have jealousy and have bitterness and anger and pride those things in our humanness are going to pop up but when we keep looking at jesus then that's not the prominent thing can you say man there's no way we can be looking at jesus right and see other human beings the wrong way we've got to see it through jesus eyes and if you see him right with clear vision it makes you broken down and know that you're nothing without him paul said i know nothing except christ and him crucified i'm looking at one thing christ and him crucified that's it it's everything and that's the way that i know him and when i know him then i know that i can look at life right i can look at other people right i can look at the word right i can look at everything the right way it's just that simple this morning can you say man there's a story of a man that was painting i might have been michelangelo i can't remember who it was but i wanted to get the story i couldn't find it but i read it years ago and he got to the place it might have been the lord's supper he was painting but he got the place of painting the face of jesus and he said he walked away and he tried for days sometimes into months to come back to the face of jesus and he couldn't do it he broke down every time he looked into his face and tried to paint it he said no man that looks truly into the face of jesus can ever be the same again and that's just a painting how about the reality of seeing him in all of his glory through the word it changes you it changes your outlook changes your perspective can you say that tight skirts and see through blouses painted toes and fingernails all different colors and eyeliner and makeup caked on you're not seeing jesus correctly yet your vision is impaired by the fashions of this world and you lost your vision of true beauty when you get a vision of what god says true beauty is you don't need to manufacture it can i have a few more amends to that you're a gamer you're tied to that video game screen like a slave it's all right boy i know it's okay but i'm gonna tell you if you're a slave to that you just don't see jesus right yet never get the result you never get that result from seeing him right your passion your satisfaction your trust in life life changes when you see jesus correctly you want to know what the message is the message was to restore the word all the word god sent it through a prophet to restore all the word to us for what reason so we can see jesus right and look into his face how many knows the scripture in corinthians it says when we look into him face to face clearly without any veils without any impaired vision we're changed from glory to glory to glory amen it's not being a church mentor it's remember it's seeing him right i woke up early here a couple days ago about three in the morning and they got to thinking about this subject of the vision impaired i don't know why i kept imagining a parent who got their kids sitting down and they don't understand yet that the kid has a vision problem you might have done this with your kids if you don't understand they have a vision problem then you're requiring certain things of them to see certain things becca and i had my dog first daughter amariah and so she had something how she processed things in her mind and so early on in her school days we were pretty rough on her we'll admit that and so then we went six months to a year and she just wasn't getting it and we were being a bit hard on her and so then we took her to someone to see someone realize she has she has this thing and the way she processes things and looks at and once we knew that first of all we made changes to how she learned and also we we recognized what we were doing wrong we apologized to her because we didn't realize there was a there was a bit of a different way she was possibly processing it i thought of a young boy or a young girl and i just kept imagining somebody just slapping him in the head saying tell me what you see tell me what you see why can't you see that's a drum set why can't you see slapping them on the head i don't know why i had that am i just slapping them and then just god convicted me is that you can't slap people on the head if their spiritual vision is impaired god help me because all that needs to happen is god supernaturally change and take that vision apparently and change it and they can see it clearly and then it's over it's over but how harsh would it be to beat someone and keep trying to do that and god just moved about it that that's and that's maybe why i'm preaching a little bit about it this morning as long as you will listen to me this morning um you know i believe that and that's just that it's just like your vision may be impaired about jesus i don't know where you're at today but your vision may be imperative maybe you're sitting here and and you come to my church and you just don't see everything just right i tell you god so moved me by this that's what actually keeps me preaching i would give up i would go do something different and i don't have a degree so i'd probably be at mcdonald's deck my wife would have to support me what keeps me going is because i've got some corrective things in the word here that if you need corrective surgery i'm going to keep preaching them so your vision can be corrected i thought about the natural vision and eyes that get bad sometimes isn't it interesting that you know eyes get bad eyesight for most people gets bad but your eyesight gets bad over time if you're in here and you're 40 50 60 years old and you still have perfect vision you ought to raise your hand and say thank you lord but most time it what happens is that impaired visions happens now some kids get glasses right away a lot of times it happens over time over years right and your vision becomes worse and comes worse and i remember as a kid i had perfect vision until i was 40. perfect vision and i was blessed but i wanted to wear glasses because they were cool so i kept having my dad take me to the doctor hoping that i have an impaired vision because i already had my glasses picked out preppy glasses finally i just gave up you know i've got thank you lord i got perfect vision and then 40 years old hit how many has ever passed 40 years old everything almost right on my birthday and i'm going i'm reading almost on my birthday the very day and i'm reading and it's it's it's a little blurred it wasn't my birthday just right on the very day it changes and then at 45 other things changed 50 more things change i won't even tell you about some things that change is it type is it a type of the spiritual that even for believers if we're not careful it's over the years of going through hurts and pains and the struggle to be a christian that our vision gets impaired come on now it's a type of the naturalist that it happens over so many years and it kept getting worse and so what i did was and you know the thing is is that i go back in every year every two years and i i can't find my classes now they usually say well they're on your head but you i go in every couple years to to walmart because i'm a member of the first church of walmart any other members here so i go in and the thing is every year you know he does this test and everything and it's just every year there's a little bit it's a little bit worse a little better that's why i had to change my glasses it doesn't say the same it gets a little worse a lot worse and i asked i said is this going to keep happening and what i always think what kind of glasses are am i going to be wearing at 70 years old how are they going to look like the bottoms of a bottle a coke bottle how many how many in here has glasses pretty thick who has real thick glasses give me your glasses brother quinlan not to embarrass you but okay i'll embarrass you then wow these are pretty thick whew pretty thick glasses i've seen thicker but this is pretty thick brother quinlan uh ike um the government may be interested in these things you know these are pretty thick strap them to the bottom of a satellite plane use them in ukraine but you know it just it keeps getting worse and worse and worse and i wonder how and so then but the thing is is i thank god that i have something to go because then i go through this process of sitting in there in the chair and they got these machines and they bring them in front of you first they let you read the letters on the wall and every time i go and do it he has these slides that he puts in front of it and he asks you the question this is it okay can you read that line and the year before i might be able to read it now it's all now it's all blurry there's different impaired vision there's some near side of some farsighted some cloudy there's a lot of different impairment to vision and spiritually there's a lot of different reasons why people get their vision impaired a lot of times it's pat their past and they view everything now through the the lens of their past am i telling the truth and so i look at that machine and he's asked me the questions do you see that can you read that can you read it and i'll read it the year before and now i can't read it so then he takes those little slides and he just keeps going keeps going and then i can read it and then i can read it and then i can read it and it gets clearer and gets clearer and i don't know why i was thinking about that a few mornings ago i just thought that's what the lord in his grace does for us amen amen remember science advances in things that's a type of the spiritual that's happening and through the lens of the message of the hour he just could put anything can you see it now and just like it was a process for you to get in pair vision and it took years it's a process then that he takes to keep putting the right lens in front of you until you can see it clearly that's why i personally believe it's whatever whatever you want to feel i believe most of our growth in the lord happens after we get the holy ghost we're not a perfect person as soon as we get the holy ghost when they entered the promised land a type of the holy ghost when they entered they hadn't overcome anything no yet preachers different ways but that's the way i believe it you need the holy spirit in your life to change your desires you can have it this morning i believe if you surrender your heart but then you begin your battle and the lord begins a growth that you don't see things clearly yet but through the word through gospel ministers he's going to take like that doctor because it's dr jesus can you say amen what do they call a guy that does your eyes like that optometrist god's the great optometrist god's the great counselor how many believe that and he just keeps doing it and i can read the whole line it gets better it gets better it's good i see it i see it i see it that's what he's doing in the bride of jesus christ and i would i would get around that atmosphere just as soon as you could i would get where the gospel is being preached in the message of the hour with the opening of this word through the seven seals i'd stay right there because i'm safe to say all of us have developed some type of impaired vision of some kind amen all of us and we're going to have some more heartaches if we don't see jesus right if you look up here and see me he's just a man you're not looking at me right i yield my gift and pray before the lord to get his word for the people then i have to step out of the way but you have to do that when you come and hear me preach you have to look at me right now that this is the lord speaking to you can you say amen and he takes all the blurry vision can you say amen he takes that and it comes clearer and clearer and clearer and clearer and i can read it better and i can read it better and god takes and does the same thing with us and that doctor just makes it now we're ready to provide you for some glasses that fits that so you can see clearly then i walk out and they charge me four hundred dollars you can try to keep viewing things through your own eyesight through your old glasses through your rose colored glasses through the glasses of your past or you can get up in the chair and say lord start restoring my eyesight the answer can you say amen it was a slow process to lose the clarity in your vision so it's a slow process to restore it back again one lens at a time can you say amen read that to me now now read it and put together now read it read that to me now it's kind of like staying in the word of god i tell young people you might read some sections you don't have a clue what's being said keep reading it keep praying can you say man because this reveals jesus christ and from my experience i read something years ago i didn't see and now i see it crystal clear i know what the lord means by it because this is a mystery being revealed and it's not trying to understand it up here so much as it becomes a revelation to us and we see jesus more clearly when you have impaired vision and you only see men as trees jesus says i'm not done with you yet he can touch your eyes this morning jesus is here to touch your eyes how many believe that if he did it physically to somebody he can do it to us spiritually he loves you this morning he has a care for you he knows your life inside it out and whatever has happened at the beginning if you were as crystal clear as an eight nine year old boy or girl and i find that happens god supernaturally does something in their life and they know jesus is real and it just becomes so real to him back then and sometimes if you don't go on with the lord then you get sidetracked so you have a clear vision and it's simplicity and it's the heart of a child a lot of times it's the simplicity of a child i love my grandbaby i really do not just because grandparents normally love grandbabies but i just look at her and i see innocence i see simplicity i see i have a picture of her just raising her hands in church and she probably don't even know all that she's doing but she's just raising her hands and she's so pure and art she doesn't play adult games that all of us do and guile in their heart to play little games with one another it's just an innocence tire of adult kings and by mean that i mean just the little bitterness and games we play with one another and i i want to be that innocent child-like heart again amen so you have that the beginning and then life just gets in the way and troubles gets in the way all the stuff happens in between and your vision becomes clouded and you're not seeing jesus right you're not seeing other people right that's why brother brown says oh he says i don't want to die an old cranky man i'm paraphrasing but he says just a you know begrudging just a harsh bitter because life has brought you so many disappointments you just become more and more bitter about life he said oh god don't crown my life with just being a crabby old man that's what i said but crown my life with the glory of god let me end this better than the way i began it jesus said you're not seeing it right yet he didn't run away he didn't say that was enough he touched his eyes again and he could see everything clearly and probably the first thing he'd seen was jesus how many want to see jesus right you see jesus right it's the answer to your marriage problems when you see jesus right it's the answer to your domestic problems when you see jesus right it's the answer to your healing when you see jesus right it's the answer to you being washed with forgiveness in your heart towards other people it's everything lord don't let me lose my vision of you let it be cleared by the holy spirit this morning there's an old song that says don't lose your vision of jesus keep your eyes ever on him i just forgot the words many friends and dear loved ones have lost their way they have lost their vision of him don't lose your vision of jesus keep your eyes many friends [Music] their way they've lost [Music] your vision of jesus keep your eyes [Music] have lost their [Music] just lay your hands on somebody next to you may those be the hands of jesus that touched the eyes the blind man can only see men as trees vision hadn't become clear that same jesus is here it doesn't take anything but just a simple heart just a simple heart lord i really need you because my vision is become impaired in your grace and your love i want to be able to look at things through the blood of jesus christ look at things the right way and i especially want to be able to see you jesus and all of your glory without any impairment would you pray for that person next week and i know they're praying for you father you sent the message for the purpose of making things clear to us making you clear to us never before a people has enjoyed revelation of jesus christ and then face to face never before has it been this open we all with open faces beholding in a glass our change from the lord to the glory it's never been this great lord yet we let the things of the world our past cloud us lord from seeing it clearly forgive us lord forgive me lord right now i give my heart fully to you there's some here maybe that just they got so impaired years ago i just they gave up lord i know there's some heroes four or five that i know of they just gave up it's over it's done i just give up lord please love them this morning please touch their eyes lord in the name of the lord jesus christ touch their eyes [Music] let them give hope believe again lord that their life can be transformed and changed they can just see you let them believe again in this jesus that opens up the blinded eyes help us to see you clearly lord forgive us break us when we see your face it's like that painter it's hard to when we really look at you it's hard not to be broken down and become convicted and say lord what have i done to you what a i don't want to hurt you lord just help me wash away my sin help me lord change me i need to see you lord if i can just get a glimpse of you and see you clearly lord i know you can do the other work that i can't do you can do the transforming you can do the changing part for some reason that you're here this morning i believe it's to meet the lord i didn't ask you to do anything to just surrender it's all just this isn't a sign it's a surrender it's not seeing a sign i've been asked to do anything more than just to trust him say lord i trust you touch my eyes this morning touch my eyes [Music] thank you jesus and the things [Music]
