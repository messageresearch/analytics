[0:02] excuse me verse yeah verse 10. First
[0:05] Corinthians 13 and verse 10 but when
[0:07] that which is perfect is come
[0:09] then that which is in part shall be done
[0:11] away when I was a child I spake as a
[0:15] child I understood as a child I thought
[0:18] as a child but when I became a man I put
[0:21] away childish things for now we see
[0:24] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[0:27] face now I know in part but then shall I
[0:30] know even as also I am known and now
[0:33] abideth faith hope charity these three
[0:36] but the greatest of these is Charity
[0:40] heavenly father bless your word today
[0:42] may you anoint us Lord with your true
[0:45] anointing Lord may your word go forth in
[0:48] Clarity and power and may we get a hold
[0:50] of it father in our hearts and draw near
[0:52] to you the Bible says if we draw near to
[0:55] you you'll draw near to us we thank you
[0:58] Lord for this opportunity to be in your
[0:59] house today bless each one that's
[1:01] hearing our Voice May the anointing
[1:03] catch their hearts Lord may they respond
[1:05] because your love is being expressed to
[1:07] them through the word we ask it Jesus
[1:10] name amen God bless you God bless you
[1:13] brother and sister Bauer good to have
[1:15] you with us this morning in the service
[1:16] you may be seated
[1:19] you know I never dreamed that we would
[1:21] enjoy sets Revelations just out of one
[1:23] chapter of the Bible First Corinthians
[1:25] 13 and I'm trying to take this service
[1:28] maybe this service and one other service
[1:30] to bring this series to a close and that
[1:33] is the series on the more excellent way
[1:35] that Paul has preached to us in the
[1:38] Bible here and uh I've just been amazed
[1:40] at all the things that's come out of the
[1:42] chapter ministering an entrance for the
[1:45] last days bride of Christ I believe Paul
[1:47] was ministering an intro an entrance for
[1:50] the Corinthians but especially for the
[1:52] Bride of the last days and entrance for
[1:55] us to come and move from partial
[1:57] Revelation to perfect Revelation how
[2:00] many would want to move from partial
[2:01] revelation of Jesus to perfect
[2:04] revelation of Jesus that's what he's
[2:06] speaking of and if none of the other
[2:08] ages came to that I believe that it'll
[2:10] be this age that there will be a people
[2:12] that comes to perfect revelation of
[2:14] Jesus Christ
[2:16] and that the gifts and the Mysteries
[2:19] just some opening comments for you the
[2:20] gifts and the Mysteries are glorious and
[2:23] they're appreciated but they're never to
[2:25] be the main thing I'm reminding us of
[2:28] things that we learned in First
[2:30] Corinthians 13 and that is the gifts
[2:33] working and prophecy working and even
[2:36] the Glorious knowledge and Mysteries
[2:38] that we receive from God they're
[2:40] wonderful they're glorious they're to be
[2:42] appreciated but they're never to be the
[2:45] main thing
[2:46] they're never to be the main thing the
[2:48] Mysteries are never to be because Paul
[2:50] said I could understand all Mysteries
[2:52] and not have Divine love I could give my
[2:55] body to be burned all the sacrifices out
[2:57] there and not have Divine love so Paul's
[3:00] bringing us an entrance into the main
[3:02] thing that we should be emphasizing over
[3:04] prophecy over the Mysteries being shown
[3:07] us then that is divine love there is one
[3:11] crucial mystery singular there is one
[3:13] crucial mystery under the seventh seal
[3:16] that is Paramount for each individual
[3:19] bride member to catch there's a there's
[3:21] a mystery of Christ in you the hope of
[3:23] glory and that's the Paramount mystery
[3:26] that all of us must receive so when I
[3:29] say Mysteries plural you could
[3:30] understand all those things and not have
[3:32] Divine love but there is one mystery
[3:34] under the seventh seal that all of us in
[3:36] this hour should catch which will bring
[3:39] forth the Life of Christ in a bride and
[3:41] bring forth a victory in Divine love
[3:46] this is the more excellent way of a
[3:48] Christian Sons will come to perfect love
[3:50] in this hour how many believe that they
[3:52] will live in this way in this excellent
[3:54] way they will live there more and more
[3:56] this will be their final Victory before
[3:59] the body change I know we think the
[4:02] final Victory is a body change and I'll
[4:03] tell you when you start getting older
[4:05] then you start to think of the final
[4:06] Victor to me is a new body how many is
[4:09] the old people can raise their hands if
[4:11] you're going to admit you're old today
[4:12] that's the final Victory to me is get a
[4:15] new body but actually it's not the final
[4:17] victory of the Bride it is final final
[4:19] but before that there'll be a victory in
[4:22] Divine love
[4:23] for the bride of Christ
[4:25] we won't be taken to that the emphasis
[4:28] on prophecies or the emphasis on and all
[4:30] the things from Pentecost will have
[4:32] those things but the victory will be the
[4:34] Revival will be a victory and Revival in
[4:37] Divine love
[4:40] we learned all the riches of this Divine
[4:42] love and all the characteristics of it
[4:44] in the first three verses of first uh
[4:46] First Corinthians 13 we learn the
[4:48] characteristics we learned the nature of
[4:50] how he he uh love responds to thing how
[4:53] he acts and that will be manifested so
[4:56] go back and listen if you want I think
[4:58] we've been blessed to be able to break
[5:00] down to you all the characteristics and
[5:03] all the nature of divine love and how it
[5:05] acts and responds to things in life and
[5:07] to people in life and then we moved on
[5:09] and we learned that love never fails
[5:12] everything will fail governments will
[5:14] fail people's human love will fail us
[5:17] people will fail us can you say Amen
[5:19] Even Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[5:22] but love never fails because it is him
[5:26] Hallelujah was so inspiring to me to
[5:29] realize that we can get a hold of
[5:31] something and have something that will
[5:33] never fail in our lives
[5:35] then we learned that we transition from
[5:38] depending on temporal blessings of the
[5:40] Lord too much to living in his eternal
[5:42] love and that's when we get into verse 8
[5:45] charity never faileth prophecies they'll
[5:47] fail knowledge will vanish away for we
[5:50] know in part we prophesy in part but
[5:52] when that which is perfect has come that
[5:54] which is in part shall be done away so
[5:55] there's this transition for the bride in
[5:58] the last days of going from living on
[6:01] temporal blessings of the Lord last
[6:03] Sunday I was more on temporal things
[6:05] than material things of Life are
[6:07] businesses of life our cars our trucks
[6:10] our our our entertainments whatever we
[6:13] do fishing hunting whatever it is and so
[6:16] now we enjoy those things but they're
[6:19] temporal things can you say Amen then we
[6:21] find there are temporal things that are
[6:23] in the kingdom of God and we can't
[6:25] depend on or live on Temple blessings of
[6:28] the Lord too much we must live every day
[6:30] on his eternal love for us and express
[6:33] his eternal love be being loved by him
[6:36] unconditionally and giving unconditional
[6:39] love to others
[6:41] a love that never gives up
[6:44] 11 a love that never stops giving
[6:47] that's the way he loves you
[6:49] can you say Amen
[6:51] think of a Christian only talking to God
[6:53] when they need something
[6:56] think of a Christian only coming to God
[6:58] when there's an emergency
[7:01] that's a childishness that's that's an
[7:04] emotional walk with God
[7:06] running to the Lord when there's an
[7:08] emergency in life
[7:10] running to God but see God wants
[7:12] fellowship and love from us even when
[7:14] there's not an emergency going on he
[7:17] wants relationship with you he wants
[7:19] Fellowship something that's an everyday
[7:21] love relationship with him not something
[7:23] that's I'm running back to you God I'm
[7:25] sorry I've been away from you so long
[7:27] I'm sorry but you see now now I need to
[7:29] get back with you because I got an
[7:31] emergency in my life somewhere the
[7:33] church has got to grow out of those
[7:34] immaturities that there's a consistent
[7:37] love for God no matter what's happening
[7:39] in our lives
[7:42] consider a Christian that says Lord I
[7:44] need you now it's emergency bail me out
[7:45] of this God bail me out living off of
[7:47] temporal blessings of God think about
[7:49] always living in the rush of a prophecy
[7:52] over your life that was from God how
[7:54] many is that a prophecy over your life
[7:55] and it come from God you knew it come
[7:57] from God I've had that and I appreciate
[7:59] those things but I can't live expecting
[8:02] just on a prophecy to live by I have to
[8:04] have a consistent love of God and
[8:06] passion for him if I never get another
[8:08] prophecy over my life if God never does
[8:11] another miracle for me if God never
[8:14] heals the sick again I am here for the
[8:17] duration I stand and I want to let God
[8:20] know and I want to let the devil know
[8:22] this fellow is not moving from his
[8:24] stance in the word of God
[8:27] that's immaturity that's this love
[8:29] working no matter ups and downs blessing
[8:31] God blesses me God doesn't bless me
[8:33] doesn't matter that doesn't change it
[8:35] I'm right here ready to serve him and
[8:36] love him
[8:40] think about a Christian Living off the
[8:42] rush of Prophecy over your life or the
[8:44] prayer or a healing that's come as I
[8:47] said you can receive healing a miracle
[8:49] from God you can receive but you might
[8:51] get sick again and need another healing
[8:52] see it's temporal
[8:55] my heart is on brother Donnie this
[8:57] morning and his daughter Erica who last
[8:58] night he sent out a thing she's feeling
[9:00] weak she needs the prayers of the body
[9:02] of Christ around the world or unless the
[9:05] cancer taker I'm just while I'm
[9:07] preaching I'm thinking of listen we need
[9:09] that atonement that healing we will
[9:11] always need that and it's so powerful
[9:13] how many remember and remember brother
[9:15] Donny's daughter Erica in in the next
[9:17] few days in prayer we appreciate those
[9:19] things or we love it when the presence
[9:21] of the Lord sweets down and baptizes Us
[9:24] in his presence it's glorious isn't it
[9:28] but it's temporal
[9:30] here it's temporal
[9:32] and we can't just live on temporal
[9:34] things with our walk with God and that
[9:36] his love does not change when he doesn't
[9:39] we need to live that his love does not
[9:41] change when he doesn't answer like we
[9:43] thought he should answer
[9:44] it don't change if our healing doesn't
[9:46] come in a miracle form his love doesn't
[9:49] change that if I ever was able to be in
[9:51] another feeling the strong love of God
[9:54] keeps me no matter what I love Laura's
[9:57] Story song She Wrote a few years ago I
[9:59] can't remember what year it was and I
[10:01] was asking Ashley to sing it again it's
[10:03] been a while she's saying it the lyric
[10:05] says and this is the one that says
[10:08] says we pray for blessings we pray for
[10:11] peace and comfort for our family we pray
[10:14] for protection while we sleep we pray
[10:16] for healing for Prosperity we pray for
[10:19] your Mighty hand to ease our suffering
[10:20] and all the while you hear each spoken
[10:23] need yet love is way too much to give us
[10:26] lesser things because if you're in the
[10:28] then the court says what if your
[10:30] blessings comes through raindrops what
[10:33] if your healing comes through tears what
[10:35] if a thousand sleepless nights are what
[10:38] it takes to know you're near and what if
[10:40] the trials of this life are your Mercies
[10:43] in Disguise
[10:46] Joseph even before Calvary Joseph was
[10:49] able to look at life this way at the end
[10:52] when he was completely mistreated by his
[10:54] brothers he had every right to be bitter
[10:57] and write them often at the end of it he
[10:59] he connected to the predestinated plan
[11:02] of God somehow and bitterness was gone
[11:06] and the past was gone and he was able to
[11:08] look at his brothers and say listen what
[11:10] you did God intended you intended it for
[11:13] evil but God has done that for my good
[11:18] what an eternal perspective
[11:21] what a theophany perspective what a what
[11:25] a a deeper perspective that most of us
[11:28] live temporarily affected by temporary
[11:30] things but he tapped into something else
[11:32] there to say listen what you meant and
[11:34] evil God's turning around it's met for
[11:36] good that was supposed to happen in my
[11:38] life that was I've been fighting it
[11:40] saying God why did you let that happen
[11:42] in my life but now that was supposed to
[11:44] happen
[11:45] because I wouldn't be here today
[11:48] somebody listening to me this morning my
[11:52] story is my story I can't change my
[11:54] story but I know some things I wouldn't
[11:56] be here today loving God this way unless
[11:59] my story would have been written the way
[12:01] that it was somebody ought to praise the
[12:03] Lord somebody ought to shouted here this
[12:05] morning
[12:12] it's a great song what if a thousand
[12:14] sleepless nights the second verse says
[12:16] we pray for wisdom your voice to hear we
[12:19] cry in Anger when we cannot feel you
[12:20] near we doubt your goodness we doubt
[12:23] your love as if every promise from your
[12:25] word is not enough
[12:27] and all the while you hear each
[12:28] desperate plea and long that we'd have
[12:31] faith to believe
[12:33] when friends be the the sub says the
[12:35] bridge says when friends betray us and
[12:37] when darkness seems to win we know that
[12:40] pain reminds this heart that this is not
[12:42] this is not our home this is not our
[12:46] home
[12:51] Hallelujah
[12:53] what if your blessings come
[12:56] through raindrops
[12:58] what if your healing comes through tears
[13:02] what if a thousand sleepless nights are
[13:05] what it takes
[13:06] to know you're near
[13:08] what if trials in this life
[13:12] are your Mercies in disguise
[13:19] Ashley please sing that song because I
[13:21] just murdered it
[13:25] his Covenant is love and his Covenant is
[13:29] stronger than anything that can happen
[13:32] in our lives
[13:34] his Covenant of Love is stronger than
[13:36] our mistakes
[13:39] we have something stronger over our
[13:41] lives suffering over our lives than
[13:44] anything life presents to us
[13:48] if his Covenant in isn't stronger then
[13:51] I'm finished but I can say to the devil
[13:53] God's covenant he made with me is an
[13:55] unconditional Covenant and it's stronger
[13:57] than my mistakes it's stronger than what
[14:00] life dishes out to me
[14:02] I'll remind you of this quote if you
[14:04] guys want to put it up
[14:06] read this a few weeks ago it's amazing I
[14:08] read it and a mom was talking to her
[14:10] family and daughter about this very
[14:12] quote
[14:13] that evening before the service and I
[14:15] read this very quote out of a whole
[14:16] message I'm going to read it again and
[14:18] go though in the exposition I the cloudy
[14:21] skies and storms of life are no signs of
[14:24] God's disapproval neither are bright
[14:26] skies and Still Waters signs of his love
[14:28] and approval his approval of any of us
[14:30] is only in the Beloved his love is
[14:33] elective which he had for us before the
[14:35] foundation of the world does he love us
[14:37] ah yes but how shall we know we shall
[14:40] know because he said so and manifested
[14:43] that he did love us for he brought us to
[14:45] himself and gave us of his Spirit
[14:47] placing us as Sons
[14:49] amen
[14:51] I like the rest of the quote and how so
[14:53] I prove my love to him by believing what
[14:57] he said and by conducting myself with
[14:59] joy amidst the trials that he in his
[15:02] wisdom allows to come to pass
[15:06] it's not just about the revelation of
[15:08] how much God loves us it's the
[15:09] revelation of now how do I love him back
[15:13] and it's faithfulness it's consistency
[15:17] it's something that doesn't change
[15:20] day by day
[15:22] can you see it now we're transitioning
[15:24] from Tempo life to eternal life that
[15:26] means I won't withdraw myself a little
[15:29] when he doesn't answer my prayer
[15:33] I won't get angry in the midst of my
[15:35] trials I don't conduct myself like a
[15:37] little child in hard times that doesn't
[15:39] get what he wants and stops his feet how
[15:42] many ever seen Little Johnny in the
[15:43] store stomp his feet because he's not
[15:45] getting what he wants maybe you got a
[15:47] little Johnny
[15:51] Stomps his feet because he don't get
[15:53] what he wants
[15:56] we can see that in children but
[15:58] spiritual children spiritual children
[16:00] can live that way
[16:03] I don't come to conduct myself like a
[16:06] child in hard times I don't get temporal
[16:07] temple with my love for him I don't live
[16:10] on highs and then show a lack of passion
[16:12] for him when I'm in a low his love does
[16:14] not change and does not fail I want to
[16:16] give some faithfulness back to him I
[16:19] don't fade in and fade out with my love
[16:21] back towards the towards him can you say
[16:23] Amen Lord when I was a child and this is
[16:26] why Paul brings it up when I was a child
[16:27] I speak like a child I acted like a
[16:30] child I thought like a child but when I
[16:33] became a man I put away childish things
[16:36] he's typing the childhood naturally with
[16:39] our spiritual walk and he's telling the
[16:41] Corinthians you're childish and how
[16:43] you're doing things you're depending on
[16:45] a prophecy but listen your love has to
[16:48] be tapped into the love of God to love
[16:50] me back and it's consistent it doesn't
[16:52] fade in and fade out with trials can you
[16:54] say Amen Lord when I I was a child I
[16:57] acted that way in my attitude but now
[16:58] I'm becoming a man put away this
[17:01] dependence on feeling temporal things
[17:02] put away child honest things this is
[17:04] what Paul said here when I was a child I
[17:07] spake as a child you know the
[17:08] Corinthians were Christians with the
[17:10] Holy Ghost how many believe that the
[17:12] church that Paul wrote to in the book of
[17:14] Corinthians were a people that have the
[17:16] Holy Ghost
[17:18] yes they were but they were babies
[17:21] spiritually
[17:23] why
[17:25] why were they babies because they spoke
[17:28] and they understood and they thought in
[17:31] spiritually childish ways
[17:34] what were they
[17:37] I had this uh typed in years ago when I
[17:40] went through the whole book of
[17:41] Corinthians and I listed all the carnal
[17:43] babyhood of the Corinthian Church I
[17:45] couldn't find it so I went through and
[17:46] found them again last night here's the
[17:49] Corinthian Church
[17:50] outside of their services
[17:56] don't look at me funny like that
[17:59] if you'd attended a Corinthian Church
[18:01] service my goodness you think this is
[18:04] the most spiritual people on the face of
[18:05] the Earth
[18:07] and remember when I read these what's
[18:08] happening in the Corinthian Church when
[18:10] I read it's all from my King James
[18:12] Version Bible
[18:16] said there's division among you there's
[18:17] contentions among you there's playing
[18:19] favorite preachers
[18:22] you say Amen if you've read this in the
[18:24] book of Corinthians he called them
[18:26] carnal babes I have to feed you with
[18:29] milk among you is envying Strife
[18:31] carnality you walk as men he said you
[18:34] are puffed up fornication is reported
[18:37] among you a man sleeping with his
[18:39] stepmom even worse
[18:41] a man sleeping with his stepmom coming
[18:43] to church taking communion even worse
[18:45] the church the Corinthian Church was
[18:47] covering it up not talking about it not
[18:50] dealing with it too scared to call out
[18:52] the sin
[18:54] I wonder if it was pressure from the
[18:56] family don't talk about the problems in
[18:58] my family
[19:01] they were going to court with one
[19:03] another because when the church should
[19:04] have handled it themselves because the
[19:07] church didn't deal with things maybe
[19:09] they had to go to court and that's what
[19:10] I feel sometimes is that the church
[19:12] should be able to deal with issues
[19:13] outside of worldly courts but sometimes
[19:16] when the church doesn't deal with it
[19:17] properly then sometimes you have to go
[19:19] to court but you see now the church
[19:21] should be dealing they were going to
[19:22] court with one another and Paul said you
[19:24] shouldn't have to do that you should be
[19:25] mature enough to handle matters amongst
[19:27] yourself but you're not mature enough
[19:31] praise the Lord
[19:33] he had to remind and teach the women
[19:35] that they shouldn't cut their hair and
[19:37] he had to remind the men that it's a
[19:40] shame for a man to have long hair it's a
[19:43] shame
[19:43] for a man to have long hair
[19:46] I don't know why he had to remind that
[19:48] generation of it I don't know I could go
[19:50] back into the history I've studied it
[19:52] have you I'd go back to the history and
[19:53] say because the church world has written
[19:55] off that scripture and says that does
[19:56] not that's not relevant today let me say
[19:58] publicly you don't have a right to pick
[20:00] and choose what you want out of this
[20:02] Bible and say that belonged in this era
[20:04] that belonged to that if there's
[20:05] scriptural truth that's generational
[20:07] that's Timeless generation nobody no
[20:10] denomination no man no great preacher
[20:12] has a right to interpret those
[20:14] scriptures leave it alone leave it the
[20:16] way it is and for some reason Paul had
[20:19] to talk about hair
[20:21] that a woman's long hair is her glory
[20:25] it's in the Bible
[20:28] and that it's a shame for a man to have
[20:31] long hair women leave their hair long
[20:33] and uncut men cut their hair
[20:37] amen
[20:40] it's in the Bible
[20:43] men should cut it or it's a shame should
[20:46] it should and then he says there's
[20:48] heresies among you you're getting
[20:49] they're get they were getting drunk at
[20:51] the communion table
[20:53] hmm
[20:55] his Bible letting an unknown tongue
[20:57] manifest without anyone to interpret it
[20:59] Paul had to correct that you know what
[21:01] unbelievers coming in and think that
[21:02] you're mad and it was all a bunch of
[21:04] unknown tongues no interpretation Paul
[21:06] said you can't do that when you speak
[21:08] when you sing a song when there's a
[21:09] prophecy let there be an interpretation
[21:11] because we must be a people of
[21:12] understanding the unbelievers should
[21:14] understand what's going on
[21:18] sing with understanding speak with
[21:20] understanding it's not just about a
[21:22] bunch of unknown stuff and everybody
[21:23] says oh it's such a spiritual thing
[21:25] going on but nobody understands what's
[21:27] being said from God God is not the
[21:29] author of confusion he wants everybody
[21:31] to understand what he said
[21:37] praise the Lord
[21:41] everyone has a song everyone has a
[21:43] tongue when they come together
[21:45] and then he says you're being unequally
[21:47] yoked together some must have been
[21:49] unequally yoked with unbelievers
[21:50] unequally yoked but it doesn't mean
[21:52] marriage you're forming a too close of a
[21:54] union with an unbeliever how can you
[21:56] fellowship with that how can you afford
[21:57] such a close Union with an unbeliever
[22:00] he said that we we shouldn't do that
[22:03] you're unequally yoked when you give
[22:05] your offering he says when you give your
[22:08] offering don't give grudgingly
[22:12] they must have been doing that
[22:24] there's my tithes
[22:27] no don't give begrudgingly give with a
[22:30] cheerful heart
[22:33] this is the Corinthian Church I'm not
[22:35] preaching at you this morning I'm
[22:36] preaching the Corinthian Church not you
[22:39] it's Corinthian Church none of you ever
[22:41] do things like this
[22:44] so
[22:46] he says at the end of Corinthians
[22:48] examine yourself whether you're even in
[22:50] the faith
[22:51] he says I'm using sharpness with you
[22:54] that's the word I'm being sharp with you
[22:55] but I love you and I'm going to tell you
[22:57] the truth if you would have been in a
[23:00] service in the Corinthians you might not
[23:01] have seen all this carnality
[23:03] a lot of good things were going on in
[23:04] the services
[23:07] but there's some childishness going on
[23:09] behind the scenes it's very quiet now
[23:11] and understand that
[23:15] people say we're a book of Acts Church
[23:16] we're a book of Acts Church there's some
[23:18] environments but it looks like the book
[23:19] of Acts Church on the outward
[23:21] but where's the discernment to expose
[23:24] sin in the camp
[23:26] that's a book of Acts church too where's
[23:28] the discernment to start to expose
[23:30] Brothers Bound by pornography and incest
[23:33] going on and rape going on and ananias
[23:36] and Survivor were corrected for for
[23:37] lying to the Holy Ghost if you're a book
[23:40] of Acts Church where's all the other
[23:41] attributes of the book of Acts Church
[23:44] can I ask that
[23:48] he said that the apostolic way the
[23:50] apostolic way was not to have an altar
[23:53] call that came from a Methodist
[23:55] background now do we have them yes
[23:57] please if God's leading you come to the
[23:59] altar because it's about the heart and
[24:01] if he's breaking your heart come to the
[24:02] altar but he was reminding the
[24:04] Pentecostals that was a tradition that
[24:06] didn't come we don't know we have no
[24:08] record in the scripture that they had an
[24:10] altar call in the book of Acts Church
[24:14] you have no scripture for it
[24:17] it came from a Methodist Dogma a
[24:19] Methodist manner of doing it which is
[24:22] fine but don't but but let's say if
[24:24] we're going to be a book of Acts Church
[24:25] in an Apostolic Church from the original
[24:27] Pentecost then let's pray and say we
[24:29] want all of that restored to us can I
[24:32] get an amen this morning
[24:34] so grow up and act like men and women of
[24:36] God where God knows where you stand not
[24:39] up and down doubting all the time and
[24:41] Satan and and live so God knows where
[24:44] you stand every day there's no question
[24:45] about it how many would raise your hand
[24:47] and say I want to know and God wants to
[24:49] go I want God to sense my spirit my soul
[24:52] my attitude I want God to sense he knows
[24:55] exactly where I stand 24 7. there's no
[24:58] question about it my mind is disciplined
[25:01] God knows where I stand but even better
[25:03] Satan knows where I stand I want the
[25:07] devil to know 24 7 where I stand and if
[25:10] I have to vocalize it I'm going to say
[25:12] it so he knows
[25:15] does the devil know where you stand
[25:17] today
[25:18] young Christian men does the devil know
[25:21] where you stand are you in between on
[25:23] the fence or you want to send a message
[25:24] message to the enemy I may not be
[25:27] perfect but I'm going to make a stand
[25:29] today
[25:31] my parents can't make it for me my
[25:32] church I'm not going to go to heaven
[25:34] because I'm in this church and in this
[25:35] youth group I'm going to make a stand
[25:37] for the Lord today I'm going to stand
[25:39] for righteousness I want him to fill me
[25:40] with this spirit because if every all my
[25:43] friends in this church go to hell I'm
[25:45] not going to hell because I accepted the
[25:47] blood of Jesus Christ
[25:52] I want Satan to know where I stand I
[25:55] want my attitude to be right can you say
[25:58] Amen
[25:59] Charles when Chuck Swindoll has a
[26:01] wonderful little paragraph on attitude
[26:03] and it's in harmony with the more
[26:06] powerful statement from our Prophet that
[26:07] said the right mental attitude towards
[26:10] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[26:12] so attitude is extremely important this
[26:16] is this is what Charles Swindoll said
[26:18] about it the longer I live the more I
[26:21] realize the impact of attitude on life
[26:23] attitude to me is more important than
[26:26] facts it's more important than the past
[26:28] than education than money than
[26:31] circumstances then failures then
[26:34] successes then what other people think
[26:37] say or do it is more important than
[26:40] appearance giftedness or skill it will
[26:43] make or break a company a church a home
[26:46] the remarkable thing is we have a choice
[26:49] every day regarding the attitude we
[26:52] Embrace for that day can you say Amen
[26:55] we cannot change our past we cannot
[26:58] change the fact that people will act in
[27:00] a certain way we cannot change the
[27:02] inevitable the only thing we can do is
[27:04] play the one string we have and that is
[27:07] our attitude I am convinced that life is
[27:09] ten percent of what happens to me and 90
[27:12] of how I react to it and so it is with
[27:14] you we are in charge of our attitudes
[27:20] and if you get the right one towards the
[27:22] promise of God and God senses this boy's
[27:25] got a right attitude he's got a positive
[27:27] attitude he's going through a trial but
[27:29] he's got a positive attitude when God
[27:32] senses that the Devils have to back off
[27:34] and God has to step in when Divine love
[27:37] is projected Sovereign Grace will take
[27:39] over
[27:41] it's about attitude
[27:44] I love to preach about and now preach on
[27:46] Hannah here and I'll close
[27:48] I love to preach about Hannah because
[27:51] Hannah her husband had two wives and the
[27:55] one wife started to have a bunch of
[27:57] babies and Hannah couldn't have a child
[27:59] and the worst thing is it's bad for a
[28:01] woman not to be able to have one and God
[28:03] she loves that but she couldn't have it
[28:05] and so now you look at Laura you know
[28:07] all through the years she becomes bitter
[28:08] she had an adversary she had a tormental
[28:11] Tormentor so Hannah started to get
[28:13] bitter about God not answering her
[28:15] prayer
[28:16] uh to have a child and then she looks
[28:19] over and and she sees the other wife I
[28:22] can't remember her name and she's having
[28:23] babies and then she gets complexes you
[28:26] know the other wife is having and she's
[28:28] prospering and God you're hearing her
[28:30] prayer and not my prayer
[28:33] these all this mental stuff going on
[28:35] they must be favored of you I'm not I'm
[28:38] I'm unworthy and and as this this grows
[28:42] it grows in a bad attitude towards God
[28:45] now it's one thing to not understand
[28:47] what God's doing it's another thing to
[28:49] have a bad attitude about it come on say
[28:51] amen and bitterness develops and and and
[28:54] things develop it one what was just a
[28:57] simple hurt by somebody years ago people
[28:59] can hold that Grudge for countless years
[29:03] ask God to help you get over it don't
[29:05] let it taint your whole life
[29:08] let the forgiveness and blood of Jesus
[29:09] wash it away from you but you see now
[29:12] she had this she developed that and then
[29:14] then the Tormentor come it says the
[29:17] torment she had a Tormentor that torment
[29:18] she was in depression she was low but
[29:21] every year her and Alcona her husband
[29:23] that was her husband's name brother
[29:24] Alcona every year they went to the
[29:25] temple to worship God every year they
[29:27] went and they wanted to worship and so
[29:29] every year she went with the same prayer
[29:31] Lord I I don't understand why you're not
[29:34] giving me a child but she started to go
[29:36] towards her towards more bitterness
[29:37] towards it and her attitude and torment
[29:39] her she was depressed all the time and
[29:41] so now when you look at the promise and
[29:42] predestinated plan with God there was a
[29:45] predestinated plan of God for Hannah to
[29:47] have a baby
[29:49] she just didn't know it but her baby
[29:52] would be a special baby
[29:56] she was not to produce just what the
[29:58] other wife was just a baby she was to
[30:01] produce a prophet
[30:04] this bride is not to produce another
[30:06] denominational thing we are meant to
[30:09] produce Christ coming out of us
[30:12] Mary didn't just have another baby she
[30:14] brought forth Christ don't look at the
[30:17] denomination don't look at her don't
[30:18] even compare yourself with other message
[30:20] churches and say well my seems like
[30:22] they're proud there's so many things
[30:23] going on don't look at everybody else
[30:25] don't even look at everybody else in the
[30:28] congregation what is God wanting to do
[30:30] in your life
[30:33] and I can tell you Hannah didn't know
[30:35] that she was not supposed to bring just
[30:37] another baby she was praying for a baby
[30:39] but it wasn't just there was a
[30:41] predestinated plan of God for a life and
[30:43] that's why God was just holding up
[30:45] everything but who was really holding up
[30:47] the promise I can tell you with from my
[30:50] study it wasn't just God holding up it
[30:53] was Hannah's attitude holding it up
[30:57] somebody heard me preach on this before
[30:59] and I'm going to keep preaching because
[31:00] I love this little story it's the type
[31:02] of the bride of Christ you're not called
[31:03] to be a denomination you're not called
[31:05] to be other churches you're not called
[31:06] you don't compare yourself with the
[31:08] other wife there's a foolish virgin
[31:10] don't compare yourself don't borrow can
[31:13] you say Amen
[31:15] don't look at what they're doing the
[31:16] vision said they're following what
[31:18] they're doing don't do that young people
[31:19] don't follow what they're doing we're
[31:21] going to duplicate the same thing here
[31:22] don't do that go directly to the Holy
[31:24] Ghost and get your inspiration
[31:26] songwriters go directly to God and get
[31:28] your inspiration
[31:31] praise the Lord
[31:34] so every year she came
[31:36] and I always say the Hannah probably
[31:38] saying the same special every year
[31:42] can sister Hannah sing is special and
[31:45] after so many years the people just
[31:46] under their breath saying does she have
[31:48] to sing another special because she
[31:49] sings the same one every year
[31:53] and she's she's depressed she pours a
[31:58] wet blanket over that whole service
[32:00] every time she gives up for her special
[32:02] but every year it's the same one and she
[32:04] gets a man that comes up and everybody
[32:05] says do we have to hear him sing again
[32:07] okay just let her sing and and the the
[32:09] priest Eli said can we have sister
[32:11] Hannah come up and sing her special
[32:13] advice please don't please don't ever
[32:15] sing there's other singers please don't
[32:17] get hand she gets up every year and
[32:18] she's got the same song
[32:20] woe is me
[32:24] whoa is me
[32:29] woe is me
[32:33] whoa is me
[32:37] I am sad
[32:40] because the Lord won't give me a baby
[32:46] woe is me
[32:51] whoa is me
[33:01] every year it's the same thing every
[33:03] year she takes her depression home with
[33:05] her she takes everything and what was
[33:07] needed is for Hannah to tap into the
[33:10] mind of God
[33:12] because in the mind of God she was going
[33:14] to have a baby
[33:15] but it was her attitude about it and her
[33:18] depression about it and her prayer was
[33:21] tainted with her now her anger towards
[33:23] God why can't I have a baby I ask you
[33:26] and look at this woman prospering over
[33:28] here she even said to her husband I just
[33:30] you know living with a wife like this
[33:32] every day must have been hard on brother
[33:35] elkana
[33:38] she's in constant depression
[33:41] and it's like honey please pull yourself
[33:44] out of this please this is terrible and
[33:47] she says you favor her more than me God
[33:49] favors her she's having okay I can't
[33:51] have a baby for you and they're just
[33:53] going on he said he said honey listen I
[33:56] love you with a double blessing I love
[33:58] you double more than her I love you
[34:00] anyway and you're you're better than a
[34:03] thousand Sons
[34:05] so just just love me you know what am I
[34:08] chopped liver
[34:10] read the Bible it's what it says
[34:13] I'm ain't I
[34:16] I'm only laughing because this is the
[34:18] kind of things we say to our wives
[34:21] what am I chopped liver ain't I better
[34:23] than 10 Sons
[34:28] you're good but I want a son
[34:33] and then one year she comes and I'm
[34:35] closing she comes to church
[34:38] with a different prayer she Taps into
[34:40] the predestinated plan of God
[34:43] and her prayer now was aligned with the
[34:46] predestinated plan of God
[34:48] and she comes in that year different and
[34:52] she comes in and she raises her hand
[34:54] almighty God and she said Lord I have
[34:56] prayed for years for a baby but I want
[34:59] to bring this prayer to you if you will
[35:01] bless me with a baby I will have that
[35:03] baby I will wean that baby and I'll give
[35:06] that baby completely back to you to the
[35:09] service of the Lord for the rest of its
[35:11] life that was a different prayer that
[35:13] was a humble prayer that was a
[35:15] sacrificial prayer prayer see her prayer
[35:17] before was really selfish
[35:20] I want it for myself but when unselfish
[35:23] just came in her prayer that she was
[35:25] thinking of others instead of herself
[35:27] her attitude changed that year and she
[35:30] said God if you give it to me and and
[35:33] the thing is the Bible says you begin to
[35:35] just get into the flow and the spirit of
[35:37] God so much that she looked drunken from
[35:39] the whole congregation and Eli the
[35:41] priest said what have you done have you
[35:43] been drinking what is going on what's
[35:45] the matter with you and she got a little
[35:47] tiffed at him says I'm not a child of
[35:50] Belial I'm not an empty I don't drink
[35:52] and get myself drunk I'm drunk in the
[35:54] spirit of God I have released this thing
[35:57] read your Bible
[35:59] she got on the priest for saying that to
[36:01] her I'm not drunk with wine I'm not Dr
[36:04] I'm drunk in the spirit because I've
[36:06] released something to God I've released
[36:08] a bad attitude towards God I got rid of
[36:11] my anger right now I got rid of my
[36:13] bitterness and I'm releasing this to God
[36:15] and she's running around shouting and
[36:17] Eli said well why don't you sing a
[36:19] special and everybody goes no no please
[36:22] don't let her sing again
[36:26] but this year she got up and she had a
[36:28] different song she had a new song she
[36:30] had a different special everybody's just
[36:33] expecting the woe is me hit
[36:38] she gets up she said I just want to
[36:40] testify and praise the Lord I've
[36:41] released something to the Lord this
[36:43] morning uh God bless you for praying for
[36:45] me God bless you for an endure enduring
[36:48] my special over here but I got a new
[36:49] song today I just want to say I thank
[36:51] God for saving me filling me with the
[36:53] Holy Ghost God for changing my attitude
[36:55] I just want to give glory to God today
[36:57] in the service praise the Lord and now
[36:59] I'm going to sing every praise is to our
[37:02] God
[37:03] every word of worship in one Accord
[37:08] every praise and everybody's going
[37:10] Something's Happened to Hannah
[37:13] 's changed
[37:18] she didn't have a baby yet though
[37:21] so what's changed
[37:24] her attitude changed
[37:26] because her attitudes change her prayers
[37:28] changed every praise is to our God every
[37:33] word of worship in one Accord
[37:37] everybody's just rejoicing Place comes
[37:39] unglued
[37:41] they get ready they pack up
[37:44] head back home
[37:46] she has no baby yet
[37:48] but it doesn't matter
[37:50] she's anchored into the love of God
[37:54] you remember in the prayer lines
[37:57] where brother Brandon would bring him up
[37:58] this way and the hundreds of prayer
[38:00] lines where he prayed
[38:02] sometimes you could see a miracle happen
[38:04] right there
[38:05] sometimes healing would take place over
[38:07] time
[38:08] and he said healing is better than a
[38:10] miracle
[38:14] healing is better because you have to
[38:16] trust God
[38:18] and believe and confess that he's healed
[38:20] you
[38:22] if we get too many miracles we get too
[38:24] dependent we're expecting miracles
[38:27] but he said that wouldn't be as great as
[38:29] if you just believe with your other
[38:30] heart and he'd tell these people I'm
[38:31] looking he'd look them in the face and
[38:33] listen now go on your way happy
[38:35] rejoicing
[38:37] over and over again look it up on your
[38:39] table app go on your way happy rejoicing
[38:42] confess the word of God go on your way
[38:45] happy it's about attitude
[38:47] come on people say amen it's about
[38:49] attitude go on your way have they
[38:52] weren't healed yet they had cancer they
[38:55] had all these other but just change your
[38:57] attitude go on your way happy rejoicing
[39:01] because brother round knew that there
[39:03] had to be an atmosphere created for the
[39:06] healing to come and you create your
[39:08] atmosphere
[39:10] you create an atmosphere
[39:13] of healing can you say Amen of
[39:15] Deliverance of power you do that by the
[39:17] word you speak in your home by the words
[39:19] just speak to one another if it's
[39:21] positive is right if it's respectful
[39:23] God's going to bless that more than a
[39:25] bunch of just agitation and fighting and
[39:27] anger
[39:29] yeah go on your way happy rejoicing and
[39:33] many of you didn't have their healing
[39:34] yet but they went on to receive it and
[39:37] brother Bradham was teaching us through
[39:38] the prayer lines because we learn from
[39:40] the mind of God even in the prayer lines
[39:42] how God works and he's teaching us that
[39:46] we
[39:47] should be a people that rejoices
[39:50] not when we get the answer to our prayer
[39:55] but we're rejoicing before
[39:59] we get it
[40:02] as if we got it
[40:06] I got a feeling maybe Brother Ray has
[40:08] prayed for two or three weeks ago
[40:10] I got a feeling that he held that
[40:13] attitude and you hold that right
[40:14] attitude I believe God's going to heal
[40:15] me
[40:17] then it comes past like it did this more
[40:19] he can testify to the church my shoulder
[40:21] and my back is healed by the grace of
[40:23] God
