[28:35] and a few testimonies
[28:40] you know I had somebody send me
[28:41] something earlier this week that said
[28:43] love projects and I was thinking about
[28:45] like a flashlight you flick on a
[28:47] flashlight or even this morning this was
[28:49] dark in here until we turned the lights
[28:50] on
[28:51] the lights all came on what's the
[28:53] greater power
[28:55] because we can't turn the darkness on
[28:56] when the lights are on
[28:59] foreign
[29:03] [Music]
[29:06] so the love that we have for one another
[29:08] let's take each of these to heart and we
[29:11] can project our love to the the greatest
[29:12] love the one who died for us and he can
[29:15] take care of these things for us

[34:22] wonderful challenge to us all from the
[34:25] word of God I just still I listened to
[34:28] it again yesterday and I just was very
[34:30] awed by how deep this forgiveness and
[34:33] grace of God goes and it's got to
[34:35] trickle down into our lives as well
[34:38] towards one another praise the Lord just
[34:40] wanted to make a few nonsense I wanted
[34:42] to say first before the announcements uh

[34:47] it's like wow but that really ministered
[34:51] we really appreciate it very much it's a
[34:53] great song and it's perfect for the
[34:55] Lord's supper tonight as well that's how
[34:57] deep that this Calvary calvary's blood
[34:59] goes for every experience in life
[35:01] whatever is the deepest wrong that
[35:03] somebody has been done calvary's
[35:05] calvary's love will reach to it can you

[35:09] praise the Lord there's a concert this
[35:10] Friday in the youth Hall back there in
[35:12] front on Friday if you want to attend
[35:15] that this is a fellow that sings uh
[35:17] religion isn't working anymore I've sung
[35:19] that people thought I wrote it but I
[35:20] didn't write it and he's coming in to
[35:22] sing a few of those songs and I'm sure
[35:24] you'll enjoy him Joseph uh haberdank
[35:26] back in the youth Hall we're going to
[35:29] start usually in the fall I start some
[35:31] in between classes and we did some last
[35:33] fall as the kids go to school that I
[35:36] like to go to school too so I start
[35:38] setting up some different subjects to
[35:40] talk about particularly to the men but
[35:42] also we'll be doing some other ones
[35:43] through the winter here so on the
[35:45] Thursday nights and the Friday nights
[35:47] excuse me the Thursday nights in
[35:50] September and in October we'll be going
[35:53] through the men's bible study courageous
[35:55] and working through that and has some
[35:58] really good things in it scriptural
[35:59] things and Powerful things for True God
[36:02] Godly men and so we'll be studying that
[36:05] together those who want to come are
[36:07] welcome to come and having you set a
[36:09] time yet I suppose Boaz or someone can
[36:11] help me with is at seven do we set a
[36:13] time somewhere around seven o'clock if
[36:15] we need to make at 7 30 to make it
[36:17] easier on Brothers to come after work we
[36:19] will do that but we're going to be going
[36:20] through that the month of September and
[36:23] October on Thursday nights courageous
[36:25] Bible study for men amen
[36:29] if you'd stand let's go to Genesis
[36:31] chapter 15 Genesis chapter 15.
[36:46] reading in the Blessed word of God in
[36:48] Genesis chapter 15 if you would read
[36:50] with me
[36:51] after these things the word of the Lord
[36:53] came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
[36:57] not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[36:59] exceeding great reward and Abraham said
[37:02] Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I
[37:05] go childless and the steward of my house
[37:07] is this aleiser of dismascus and Abram
[37:10] said behold to me thou Hast given no
[37:13] seed and lo one born in mine house is
[37:17] mine air so he's pointing to a leiser
[37:19] I've got servants here I've got a great
[37:20] servant a loser of others but I have no
[37:23] heir of my own and remember he's kind of
[37:25] reminding god of the promise that he
[37:27] would have a son himself I don't know
[37:31] why you have to remind God of his
[37:33] promise because he remembers his promise
[37:35] it just hasn't happened yet
[37:37] but he's kind of wondering what's going
[37:39] on here and and so maybe pointing a
[37:42] little bit to is my servant I don't have
[37:44] an heir he's asking the question this is
[37:46] how God answers them and behold the word
[37:48] of the Lord came unto him saying this a
[37:51] loser and these others this shall not be
[37:54] thine air but he that shall come forth
[37:57] out of thine own bows shall be thy near
[38:01] he had to remind him the promise said it
[38:04] would come from you
[38:07] not through someone else and he brought
[38:09] him forth abroad and said look now
[38:12] toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou
[38:16] be able to number them and he said unto
[38:18] him so shall thy seed be talking about
[38:21] blowing your mind God likes to blow our
[38:24] minds you want to see your future you
[38:26] want to see how far my promise can go
[38:28] look to the stars and try to count them
[38:31] and that's how your seed will be
[38:34] and he believed in the Lord and he
[38:36] counted it God counted it to him for
[38:39] righteousness he believed it and God
[38:41] said you're righteous before me because
[38:44] he believed and he said unto him I am
[38:46] the Lord that brought thee out of the UR
[38:48] of Charities to give me this land to
[38:50] inherit it and he said Lord God whereby
[38:53] shall I know that I shall inherit it and
[38:55] he said unto him take me a heifer of
[38:57] three years old and a shego of three
[38:59] years old and a ram of three years old
[39:01] and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and
[39:04] he took unto him all these and divided
[39:07] them in the midst and laid each piece
[39:10] one against another but the birds
[39:12] divided he not he laid out the perfect
[39:15] pure sacrifice of worship because altar
[39:18] has to do with worship the right
[39:20] sacrifices on the worship that God has
[39:21] asked for now he's getting ready to
[39:23] worship and ask God to answer by fire
[39:25] the sacrifice is perfect next first look
[39:28] at this and when the fouls came down
[39:31] upon the carcasses
[39:33] Abram drove them away
[39:38] he actually had to keep chewing the
[39:41] wrong thing getting on the sacrifice
[39:45] and I just got to believe that the sons
[39:47] of Abram have to do the same thing
[39:49] amen father bless your word today I
[39:52] humbly tell you Lord and I mean this as
[39:55] I tell you often I don't know why you
[39:57] called me for this I feel unqualified
[40:00] many times Lord but I know your word is
[40:03] true I know you put a gift in me and I
[40:06] know I'm speaking to Believers in seed
[40:08] of God seeds of Abraham Lord I know I'm
[40:11] speaking to them that your word will not
[40:13] return void and it'll have its place in
[40:15] the people's lives that's what we're
[40:17] doing here this morning and I pray
[40:19] father that every wrong would be made
[40:22] right every question would be answered
[40:24] everything Lord that we don't have in
[40:27] our own strength that your strength
[40:29] would come from the word of God Lord
[40:31] that you'll keep our spirit right in a
[40:33] receptive Spirit not only today in the
[40:36] service but for the Lord's supper
[40:37] tonight we pray father you'll clean our
[40:40] hearts and make us one with you and we
[40:42] ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you
[40:46] may be seated
[40:47] whenever we explore Abraham's life we
[40:50] find a wealth of riches and Revelation
[40:53] because Abraham's life and what happened
[40:55] to him is related to us because we are
[40:58] the children of Abraham not only uh the
[41:01] the Jews are children of Abraham
[41:03] naturally but we are the children of
[41:05] Abraham spiritually how many believe
[41:07] that you're a a son of Abraham this
[41:09] morning and so now we are his faith
[41:12] children we are actually from the Royal
[41:14] Seed of Abraham because the Royal Faith
[41:17] seed actually was Jesus Christ and so we
[41:20] our lineage is in that we are from the
[41:22] Royal Seed of Abraham coming from Jesus
[41:24] Christ that is our true identity so
[41:27] whenever we look at Abraham's life we
[41:29] say it's so important to us because
[41:30] whatever happened in Abraham happens in
[41:33] The Bride especially at the last days it
[41:35] happens in his seat as well and so we
[41:37] realize that at the beginning of
[41:39] Abraham's life in Genesis chapter 12 is
[41:41] when God called him he said I'm calling
[41:43] you out of your Kindred I'm calling
[41:45] y'all your idolatry and I'm I'm giving
[41:48] you a promise you'll be the father of
[41:50] many nations all that began to happen in
[41:52] Genesis 12 and he did come out he obeyed
[41:54] the call of God he come out from his
[41:56] Kindred left his family left everything
[41:58] and then not only did he leave and act
[42:01] upon that to come out of all that but an
[42:03] unbelievable promise was given to
[42:06] Abraham that he would be the father of
[42:08] many nations because this was
[42:10] unbelievable because he couldn't have
[42:12] children but God took a man that
[42:14] couldn't have children and said you're
[42:16] going to have enough Heritage here and
[42:19] you're going to have heirs and it's
[42:21] going to grow until the stars that are
[42:23] in heaven talk about the god of
[42:26] impossibilities
[42:27] praise the Lord so he got his call in
[42:30] Genesis 12 but what he did not know is
[42:33] how long it would take for the promise
[42:34] to come to pass God did not tell him
[42:37] that but he had the promise he believed
[42:40] the promise but there we know there were
[42:42] times that the promise took so long that
[42:45] it's written in the Bible that that that
[42:47] Abraham and especially his wife Sarah
[42:50] they begin with to have slight doubts
[42:53] about it and they begin to wonder how is
[42:55] this because of the time frames of the
[42:57] promise coming to pass and he had to
[43:00] learn you got to hold on to the promise
[43:02] incidentally in the New Testament none
[43:04] of that weakest is written of it's only
[43:06] the strength of Abraham it's only his
[43:08] positive testimony oh I hope today
[43:10] that's written to me not my mistakes let
[43:13] them be washed in the blood of the Lamb
[43:14] not my thoughts of doubt about things
[43:16] but let it be that I stand in a
[43:18] confession for my heart I believe it
[43:20] with all my heart let that be my
[43:22] testimony but you see now God was had a
[43:25] long time before he brought the promise
[43:27] to be fulfilled even though God was
[43:30] speaking to him along the way and it
[43:32] wasn't every day that he spoke to him
[43:34] but he would speak to him in this he
[43:36] would speak like he did here in a vision
[43:37] he would speak in a dream he would every
[43:39] once in a while reaffirm and revisit
[43:42] Abraham to affirm what the promise
[43:46] to reconfirm the promise and it's a good
[43:49] thing God does that with us every now
[43:51] and then can you say man you may not
[43:54] feel his presence every day but every
[43:56] once in a while in a service or when
[43:58] you're by yourself God comes and his
[44:00] presence comes near and he reaffirms his
[44:03] promise to you
[44:05] Hallelujah because he did it Abraham
[44:07] he'll do it to us that way as well so
[44:09] God is speaking to him different ways
[44:11] not every day but periodic times God
[44:14] would revisit him confirming the same
[44:16] promise it's coming it's coming I said
[44:18] it and then as uh brother Billy Paul
[44:21] used to say he said he said it I believe
[44:23] it and that settles it well that's the
[44:25] way it's got it he said it I believe it
[44:27] and that settles it and we I may not see
[44:29] the full thing yet but it settles it
[44:31] because it settled in My Heart by a
[44:33] revelation how many know that faith is a
[44:34] revelation it's not just intellectually
[44:37] believing it but something dropped in
[44:39] Abraham's heart
[44:40] and he believed it so uh but I wanted to
[44:43] say I find it interesting that this in
[44:45] this chapter he reminds God as if God
[44:48] needs to be reminded that God I have no
[44:51] Heir so now we're in chapter 15. he's
[44:53] come through a different incidence he's
[44:54] delivered a lot and you can just read
[44:56] his story but now in in 15 he's he's
[44:59] coming back to God because the Lord
[45:01] comes to him in a vision and he speaks
[45:04] to God as if God needs a reminder Lord
[45:08] do you remember I have no Heir here I
[45:11] have a servant at leisure and this uh
[45:14] this pressure of waiting till God does
[45:18] it has moved into his thinking
[45:21] the pressure of the long wait before the
[45:24] promise is fulfilled is a pressure if
[45:27] we're going to be honest enough that
[45:29] enters into US sometimes when this when
[45:31] is this thing going to be wrapped up
[45:33] when is the end of his promise when is
[45:35] the final Vindication because I like to
[45:37] say God's Vindicated this word God's
[45:39] Vindicated this message but the final
[45:42] Vindication is still coming
[45:44] because he's going to show the whole
[45:46] world this message was true this was my
[45:49] prophet and he's going to vindicate the
[45:51] whole thing
[45:54] everybody's Gonna Know
[45:56] the devil's going to know can you say
[45:58] man the whole world the Bible says that
[46:00] all every tongue shall confess that
[46:03] Jesus Christ is Lord
[46:06] they'll have to say this was truth this
[46:08] is what he said but he's going to do
[46:10] that but you see now I find it
[46:12] interesting that he's saying Lord I have
[46:14] no Heir and then in his thinking he gets
[46:17] to the place that you know I'm reminding
[46:20] you that I'm the father of many nations
[46:22] and maybe it's Elisa I got a good
[46:24] servant here uh and then later the next
[46:27] chapter his wife encourages them to go
[46:29] to Hagar and that produces Ishmael and
[46:31] Ishmael is a reflection of the human
[46:33] efforts to try to produce it's a
[46:36] slightly doubted promise and even though
[46:39] something is slightly doubted the
[46:40] promise is slightly doubted and it has
[46:43] fruits like Ishmael that come from it we
[46:45] slightly doubt and we're going to have
[46:47] fruits come from that
[46:50] just a slight doubt
[46:52] makes fruits come from it but God never
[46:55] ever endorsed or blessed
[46:59] the fruit that was produced in a slight
[47:02] doubt
[47:04] foreign
[47:06] he received Ishmael as Abraham's son he
[47:09] received him sent him and his wife laid
[47:11] her away with gifts
[47:14] means that the blessings and and all the
[47:16] stuff that goes around the Holy Ghost
[47:19] move of God can come on anybody
[47:22] can you say Amen
[47:24] but there's a difference in that the
[47:25] seed shall not be aired with the shock
[47:27] that's God's law
[47:29] the seed shall not be aired with the
[47:31] shock and if it's the shock if it's
[47:33] something holding the seed but it's not
[47:34] the seed yet we can't say well we'll
[47:36] just go with the shot no the seed shall
[47:38] not be aired with a shock I told you you
[47:41] would have a son it's going to come for
[47:43] you through your own loins it's going to
[47:45] come out of you you don't choose
[47:46] somebody else like a loser you don't do
[47:48] that you don't doubt it it's got to be
[47:50] believed 100 percent to see the Promise
[47:53] come to pass and I will bring it to pass
[47:55] God says
[47:58] praise be to his name so now Ishmael
[48:02] reflects the human efforts to try to
[48:04] produce the promise with human efforts
[48:07] God has to speak clear to him
[48:10] and this is what I want you to get more
[48:12] than anything this morning God has to
[48:14] remind him but he has to speak something
[48:15] very clear the promise cannot be
[48:19] impersonated the promise cannot be
[48:22] copied the promise can be not worked up
[48:25] or produced in your own strength leave
[48:28] it alone don't mess with it can you say
[48:31] Amen This Promise came from me and the
[48:33] way it's going to come to pass is going
[48:35] to come from me don't try to impersonate
[48:37] it don't try to produce an end smell
[48:39] don't try to work it up
[48:42] come on people
[48:44] don't get nervous about it's not
[48:46] happening it's not happening so try to
[48:48] work something up yourself leave it
[48:50] alone believe with all your heart I will
[48:53] bring this to pass the way that I want
[48:54] to bring it to pass
[48:57] Hallelujah
[48:59] So This Promise cannot be impersonated
[49:01] copied or worked up so I find something
[49:03] out of this this is this this is a devil
[49:07] that you are aware of his work is to try
[49:10] to impersonate the real thing before it
[49:14] comes
[49:16] I mean Say Amen
[49:17] that's the enemy's work
[49:19] to try to impersonate the real thing
[49:22] before it comes
[49:23] is there's a reference to the other
[49:25] prophets calling themselves with the
[49:27] spirit of Elijah other than John the
[49:29] Baptist but John the Baptist was sent
[49:31] from God
[49:32] but there were other men they rose up
[49:34] and they said they got the spirit of
[49:35] Elijah because that was the promise for
[49:37] the hour so Satan's jumping out there
[49:38] and saying I'm Elijah and I'm Elijah
[49:40] even in the last days and under the
[49:42] Pentecostal Azusa Street we had Elijah's
[49:44] right up we still have Elijah's we still
[49:46] have prophets right up and that's fine
[49:48] I'm respectful to that but listen God
[49:50] chose one and I want to find out who
[49:51] that one is
[49:54] it's not because you say you have the
[49:56] spirit of Elijah God put the spirit of
[49:58] Elijah on you and you're the one
[50:02] the devil has a work to try to
[50:04] impersonate the real thing before it
[50:07] comes but I want you to get this point
[50:09] that it can't be lived through someone
[50:11] else
[50:15] let me be simple young people you can't
[50:18] get in
[50:20] on your parents coattails
[50:26] you can't say their Heirs of this thing
[50:28] you can't say there so I'm going to get
[50:30] in and so I'm going to come up some
[50:32] other way and say no no no though what
[50:34] what God is saying to Abraham you're
[50:36] trying to come up and go through someone
[50:37] else through this promise but I'm saying
[50:40] to you that it's going to come out of
[50:42] you
[50:45] yeah
[50:48] it's going this promise is going to be
[50:51] fulfilled in you
[50:55] notice how God always is personalizing
[50:57] it because we feel doubt about ourselves
[51:00] we feel the promises coming we we
[51:02] question we get doubts about whether we
[51:04] have something we have all that but you
[51:06] see now God has to remind us no
[51:08] everything I'm doing in this age is
[51:10] related to you it will come out of you
[51:13] it's not going to just because a
[51:14] preacher is preaching it over the pulpit
[51:16] and you're part of the message no
[51:18] everything of the promise and the
[51:20] Mystery from this hour is going to be
[51:22] can I say it Christ in you the hope of
[51:25] glory
[51:26] and because it's worded that way it's
[51:29] never in a group it's never in a
[51:31] movement it's not a worldwide thing it's
[51:34] Christ in you the hope of glory This
[51:38] Promise of this hour will happen and
[51:40] come out of you
[51:42] Gabriella Hannah brother Joe
[51:45] Holden
[51:47] This Promise will come through you
[51:54] why do we have to be reminded Abraham
[51:56] had to be reminded of it
[51:58] so we have to be reminded of it so that
[52:00] we don't try to go through the mystery
[52:03] can't be fulfilled by another person
[52:06] than you Abraham Eliza was a great
[52:08] servant the promise could not be
[52:09] fulfilled in a Leisure can you say Amen
[52:11] there are great Servants of the Lord
[52:16] there are great preachers
[52:20] there are Mighty gifts Even in our own
[52:23] ranks there are Mighty gifts but I want
[52:24] to remind everybody
[52:27] Abraham is trying to point to the
[52:30] servant we have Servants of Christ but
[52:33] the air it's not that they're a servant
[52:35] The Heir The Inheritance the promise
[52:38] will come through individuals it's going
[52:41] to come through you so don't have your
[52:43] dependence on a preacher don't have your
[52:45] dependence on a great preacher the
[52:47] promise of the messes of the hour will
[52:49] be fulfilled through individuals through
[52:51] your life
[52:53] and if preachers come and go if people
[52:55] come and go if families Fall by the
[52:57] wayside that's why you got to look at
[52:58] what God's doing in you everybody might
[53:01] fall to the Wayside but it's not to
[53:03] everybody can you say Amen you say this
[53:06] is my promise and if nobody else is
[53:09] living it I know it's going to come out
[53:10] of me somebody say praise the Lord this
[53:12] morning
[53:14] ready
[53:15] Hallelujah
[53:17] and so it's not a servant Abraham I'm
[53:21] still revisiting you to confirm my
[53:24] promise to you you can't depend on them
[53:26] you can't depend on servants you can't
[53:28] depend on them and see your part
[53:30] fulfilled but Abraham I'm visiting you
[53:33] to confirm the promise but you need to
[53:35] know it'll come out of you from the
[53:37] inside out it can't live through someone
[53:39] else it's got to come out of you
[53:42] so I've been asking people lately I've
[53:45] been a little bit bold to ask them
[53:47] just asked a young man the other day
[53:49] and uh and so I've been asking them
[53:52] and they'll say things like I've been
[53:54] I've been wanting to get back to church
[53:57] I've been wanting to do this I've been
[53:59] wanting to get this right in my life and
[54:02] I've been asking them I'm going to ask
[54:04] you and I want you to ask the honesty is
[54:06] this is this I want to get back in
[54:08] church
[54:09] what are you coming for
[54:17] are you coming because you miss your
[54:18] friends
[54:19] are you coming because we have a good
[54:21] volleyball team
[54:24] come on
[54:25] are you coming because the potluck food
[54:28] is pretty good
[54:29] are you coming because we got a big
[54:30] church are you coming because you like
[54:32] the music you better check why you're
[54:34] coming
[54:35] because I'm asking these questions
[54:37] because if you can say that I've missed
[54:40] the word I've missed the presence of God
[54:42] I miss being there I was getting fed and
[54:46] now I know I'm starving and now I'm
[54:48] coming if you can answer honestly that I
[54:50] came back because I'm starving and I
[54:53] want to hear the word that's a good
[54:54] reason to come back
[54:57] because not it's not about friends at
[55:00] the end of the day it's not about the
[55:01] social thing in a church
[55:03] oh I wish I could preach this for a
[55:05] while the core of why we attend this
[55:07] assembly is not all the other stuff that
[55:09] goes with it not Sunday school all that
[55:11] where that's all ministries of this
[55:13] church we thank God for it but if you
[55:15] had all that and not catch the core of
[55:18] what God is speaking to us
[55:21] last Sunday the Lord spoke so directly
[55:23] to this congregation did you catch it
[55:27] did you miss it
[55:29] because the core we have nothing except
[55:32] we have this message to preach
[55:34] this church is unstable without the
[55:37] stability of the word of God that's been
[55:39] put in place
[55:40] and if you can't make it a priority that
[55:42] this is the core where I bring my family
[55:44] to sit here and to teach my children to
[55:46] sit here and take this hour hopefully
[55:48] not an hour and a half hopefully an hour
[55:50] hopefully brother oh it's only an hour
[55:51] but if I can't take this hour and
[55:53] completely focus and give my life and
[55:55] say I want to receive What the Lord Has
[55:57] for me your life will become shaky
[56:01] help me Lord
[56:04] and you'll be concerned about all the
[56:06] gossip in the church and all the things
[56:07] and everything else about the church and
[56:10] whether they're making administrative
[56:11] decisions right you'll be distracted by
[56:13] the core of who we are I'll tell you as
[56:16] a pastor I can't stand administrative
[56:17] stuff I never liked doing any of it I
[56:20] wish we could just come to church play
[56:22] the tambourine and the piano Worship the
[56:24] Lord and hear the word and that's it
[56:27] can't have a church this big without
[56:29] having an administration of people
[56:30] helping you in different departments and
[56:32] different Ministries you have to have it
[56:33] but I don't like I like just this right
[56:36] here I like just this
[56:38] is the core of what we are
[56:41] if we didn't have a tambourine I could
[56:43] still have church if we didn't have the
[56:44] excellent playing of these musicians we
[56:47] got the very best I believe
[56:49] we've got the very best God has blessed
[56:51] us with if we didn't have any of that we
[56:54] can still have church
[56:56] why are you saying that why are you
[56:58] saying that because all this is
[56:59] Ministries it's all ministering to you
[57:00] these guys are dedicated they pray and
[57:02] they give their gift to God they're
[57:04] dedicated to you and to this assembly so
[57:06] it's not a bad thing but I'm just saying
[57:08] I'm trying to get you back why do we
[57:09] come the core is the word the core is
[57:12] because we will go nowhere without
[57:14] receiving the the foundation and the the
[57:18] completion of the adoption of where this
[57:21] word is taking us
[57:24] I'm asking the Lord help me not to be
[57:27] mean but to be direct
[57:34] I asked him some people do you do you
[57:36] come with your friends
[57:37] did you wear
[57:39] did you do the right thing or did you
[57:41] start wearing the right thing because
[57:43] you're you're dad is the pastor or your
[57:47] dad is the deacon
[57:50] or is it coming
[57:52] out of you
[57:54] from the depths of you it's a huge
[57:56] question
[57:58] and I just don't mind saying it because
[57:59] I know I love them to say it
[58:01] find out if it's this is what he's
[58:03] saying to Abraham I want to remind you
[58:05] this promise will come from the depths
[58:07] of your bowels in you
[58:09] not anybody else
[58:13] and so you can't copy another man's
[58:15] Spirit I've been reading some of the
[58:16] quotes about uh brother Brian referring
[58:18] to the congregation uh picking up on the
[58:21] pastor's spirit and I've just balanced
[58:23] it out by saying he said that the pastor
[58:26] uh can jerk his head a certain way and
[58:28] the rest of the congregation does it the
[58:29] same way then he says Pastor be can be
[58:31] so starchy he said the church acts the
[58:34] same way
[58:37] the point is
[58:38] is that you take someone else's Spirit
[58:41] ex and not the holy spirit for yourself
[58:46] and we get into the rush of a movement
[58:49] and everything and everybody's doing
[58:50] something if you're doing it because
[58:51] somebody else is doing it that's a big
[58:54] deal because you shouldn't do it because
[58:55] someone else is doing it worship should
[58:58] be spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost
[59:00] worship should be stimulation of
[59:02] Revelation you don't have to work up
[59:04] worship I've never had to work it up
[59:06] this morning I preached the word and
[59:08] stimulation of Revelation automatically
[59:10] spontaneously happens if you're in the
[59:12] word you're going to get excited about
[59:14] what I preach and you may not death you
[59:17] may sit there and just weep over the
[59:18] word that's your way of worshiping
[59:21] that's your way of worshiping
[59:25] all right praise the Lord can't copy
[59:28] another man's Spirit you can't
[59:29] emotionally try to duplicate what others
[59:31] are doing you can't put on a show and
[59:32] act like you have the Holy Ghost
[59:35] the promise is to you and it will come
[59:38] forth from you and only you how many
[59:40] knows the promise of the Holy Ghost is
[59:42] to you and to your children he says
[59:44] those words he didn't say the promises
[59:46] to your children the promises to your
[59:48] church his first words this promise of
[59:50] the Holy Ghost is unto you
[59:53] you
[59:55] and to your children so I'll take that
[59:57] promise I'm going to keep praying I'm
[59:59] going to give my children to the Lord
[1:00:01] because in the promise it's not only for
[1:00:03] me but you can pray for your children as
[1:00:05] well
[1:00:06] and don't stop praying for him can you
[1:00:08] say Amen they didn't get the right thing
[1:00:10] whatever it is don't stop praying for
[1:00:12] them hold on to that promise
[1:00:16] and to many as far of even as the many
[1:00:18] as the Lord Our God shall call but I
[1:00:20] like it it starts the promises unto you
[1:00:25] why that's personal
[1:00:26] you can't copy you can't put on a show
[1:00:29] the problem is unto you it'll come forth
[1:00:30] from you the mystery of Christ is in you
[1:00:33] is the hope of glory blending in is not
[1:00:35] the way can you say Amen blending in
[1:00:37] with the group is not the way comparing
[1:00:39] your experience with another's
[1:00:41] experience is not the way God gives
[1:00:43] everyone an experience and and it's the
[1:00:45] same Holy Ghost but it's a different
[1:00:46] experience
[1:00:48] it's different how God brings you and
[1:00:51] forms you I can tell you last Sunday and
[1:00:53] we might have to cut this part out I
[1:00:54] don't know but I can tell you there's no
[1:00:55] way a man could preach that anointed of
[1:00:58] a message and speak from his the depths
[1:00:59] of his heart unless and I know this of
[1:01:02] what he's been through the last three or
[1:01:03] four years of his life
[1:01:06] because you see
[1:01:12] seed thing
[1:01:13] God bless sister Kelly she knows she
[1:01:16] just went through it
[1:01:17] God allows almost getting killed in a
[1:01:19] car wreck a few weeks ago
[1:01:21] and also a shooter if she'd have been
[1:01:24] there she'd have been shot with her with
[1:01:25] her uh employee or the other employee
[1:01:28] had to go to the funeral this week or
[1:01:30] last week right
[1:01:31] testing time but you know what
[1:01:33] God just forms things
[1:01:36] to bring out
[1:01:37] just the right ding of the Bell
[1:01:41] in your life
[1:01:43] God will take a pastor through things
[1:01:45] for 15 20 years and it might end up in
[1:01:51] one sermon
[1:01:54] that's how committed God is to your
[1:01:56] lives he'll form that man Until It
[1:01:59] Breaks off into one sermon all those
[1:02:01] trials for one sermon
[1:02:05] and you weren't there oh
[1:02:11] I'm making the point if God is committed
[1:02:13] to you that way
[1:02:15] then we should be committed to him
[1:02:19] sloppy commitment it's a time we live in
[1:02:22] it's just sloppy commitment
[1:02:25] but God is really committed to us can
[1:02:27] you say Amen so now can't take another
[1:02:30] man's spirit in verses 5 and 6 I got to
[1:02:32] move along here uh verses five and six
[1:02:35] are mind-blowing if you read it again
[1:02:37] chapter 15 5 6 and he brought him forth
[1:02:39] and said look now toward heaven and tell
[1:02:41] the Stars if thou be able to number them
[1:02:43] and he said unto them so shall thy seed
[1:02:44] be my Boingo I want you to see the power
[1:02:47] of this Abraham I want you to see where
[1:02:49] this message is going this promise is
[1:02:51] going look up and count the Stars try to
[1:02:53] count them that's the potency of This
[1:02:56] Promise Abraham I'm going to do it
[1:02:58] you're not going to do it I'm going to
[1:02:59] do it matter of fact I'm giving you the
[1:03:01] promise I'm giving you the promise I'm
[1:03:03] making a covenant with myself over your
[1:03:05] life this is the Abraham Covenant it
[1:03:07] wasn't between the people and him it was
[1:03:09] God making swearing by himself
[1:03:12] is the Covenant it's a good thing it
[1:03:14] doesn't deal with you it's god making
[1:03:15] his own Covenant over your life the
[1:03:18] Grace Covenant I'm going to give you a
[1:03:20] promise I'm going to give you a covenant
[1:03:22] I'm going to give you a sacrifice to
[1:03:24] confirm I'm going to give you all these
[1:03:26] things and now I'm going to show you
[1:03:28] where all this is going look to the
[1:03:30] stars and try to count them and guess
[1:03:32] what your Heir from your own loins
[1:03:34] what's going to come out of your life
[1:03:36] try to count them in the stars because
[1:03:38] that's what's coming from you
[1:03:43] that's the potency of this promise I'm
[1:03:45] going to do it you're not going to do it
[1:03:46] I'm going to do it as you believe me
[1:03:49] probably most of us in this church and
[1:03:51] online are living way below what the
[1:03:53] promise
[1:03:54] can do in US
[1:03:58] but every once in a while God comes on
[1:03:59] and tells us where's this go where is
[1:04:01] this going in your life
[1:04:02] and you have to reach out and believe it
[1:04:04] I know where I'm at today
[1:04:06] you say I know what my past is and
[1:04:07] actually you got to get past your past
[1:04:11] but every once in a while God shows you
[1:04:12] you know what I have in you this is
[1:04:14] where it can go
[1:04:18] I can't even have a baby
[1:04:21] I can't even have a baby and he's
[1:04:24] telling me my heirs my children my
[1:04:27] family will grow more than the Stars
[1:04:31] God likes to blow our minds
[1:04:33] God likes to build our faith God likes
[1:04:36] to challenge our faith
[1:04:38] are you going to believe that
[1:04:40] and guess what there's the next
[1:04:42] scripture and Abraham believed
[1:04:45] he said all right I got a revelation of
[1:04:48] this because it wasn't just in his
[1:04:50] intellectual God dropped a revelation he
[1:04:52] said you know what
[1:04:53] my seed will be as the Stars that's what
[1:04:56] you said I don't see it yet but guess
[1:04:57] what Lord I'm going to tell you 100 that
[1:05:00] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:05:04] yeah
[1:05:06] that but the truth
[1:05:08] I believe it with all my heart and guess
[1:05:11] what the next scripture says and God
[1:05:13] said because you believe that way he you
[1:05:17] are righteous before my eyes
[1:05:20] I just took all the debts and all the
[1:05:23] sin out of your account and cleared it
[1:05:26] wiped it clean and the only way that I
[1:05:28] can see you from here on out is
[1:05:30] righteous before my eyes because he had
[1:05:33] works because he did something no he
[1:05:36] believed by revelation
[1:05:39] I don't see my my seed yet I don't see
[1:05:41] where it's going but I believe my seed's
[1:05:43] going to go that far I believe this
[1:05:45] promise in me of the Holy Ghost is going
[1:05:47] to go that far in my life I see the
[1:05:49] potential of where this can go I'm not
[1:05:51] there yet but I see the potential and I
[1:05:53] believe I'm gonna be a full matured
[1:05:55] adopted son of God a pillar in the house
[1:05:58] of God
[1:06:02] and he put it on his account
[1:06:06] clear paid in full righteous before my
[1:06:10] eyes and Satan can never have access to
[1:06:13] the account
[1:06:17] I should close and we
[1:06:24] that our names remember I've creased on
[1:06:27] the motive for our worship is not that
[1:06:29] the devils are subject to us but that
[1:06:32] our names are written in the last book
[1:06:34] of life
[1:06:35] that ought to make us Shout
[1:06:40] that he has the power not only to speak
[1:06:42] your future in front of you but to say
[1:06:44] because you believe this way
[1:06:47] your account has righteousness I can
[1:06:50] never look at you except righteous
[1:06:51] before my eyes
[1:06:52] did Abraham deserve that no he didn't
[1:06:55] but it's unmerited Grace
[1:07:02] then Abraham asked for an Evidence
[1:07:06] that's common to us
[1:07:08] Lord
[1:07:10] what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:11] what's the evidence that I have it
[1:07:13] Lord is there some way that I will know
[1:07:16] that I shall inherit it it's hard to
[1:07:18] believe Abraham's asking for that but
[1:07:20] it's like us as human beings
[1:07:22] can I know the evidence of the Holy
[1:07:24] Ghost can I know the evidence I have it
[1:07:25] then it's going to can I have something
[1:07:27] you know what God gives them a blood
[1:07:29] sacrifice
[1:07:30] and that means he just wants us to keep
[1:07:32] looking at the sacrifice
[1:07:35] he shows him his future he asks him to
[1:07:37] believe it but then when he asks for can
[1:07:40] can you he ask whereby shall I know that
[1:07:42] I shall inherit it he want an extra
[1:07:44] confirmation all he gives is a blood
[1:07:45] sacrifice and you worship you come and
[1:07:48] worship me every day you come and
[1:07:50] worship me at this perfect sacrifice and
[1:07:52] I will come and answer by fire I will
[1:07:54] confirm all this but I need you to
[1:07:56] worship now it becomes about worship and
[1:07:58] I think it's interesting I'm having time
[1:08:00] to get into this now I promise we won't
[1:08:02] be long today but I I can I have just a
[1:08:04] few more minutes
[1:08:05] because this is this is really good I
[1:08:07] can't pass this part up even though I
[1:08:09] got another probably 25 messages the
[1:08:11] rest of the year pastors have that
[1:08:13] right
[1:08:16] but we like to preach it all in one
[1:08:17] service and get it done
[1:08:20] but you see uh when when he was there
[1:08:24] and and so now God points him to this
[1:08:26] right sacrifice lays it out God lays out
[1:08:29] these these different ones that type
[1:08:30] Christ if you study your Bible the the
[1:08:33] turtle dove the the she-goat three years
[1:08:35] old all these things type perfectly of
[1:08:37] Christ laid there he split up he didn't
[1:08:39] split up the birds I don't believe but
[1:08:40] he split up the other animals blood's
[1:08:42] all over there and so God points him to
[1:08:44] a sacrifice the right sacrifice of blood
[1:08:46] so in the meantime his worship can be
[1:08:48] right to stay here and worship under
[1:08:51] this pure sacrifice and I will answer
[1:08:54] completely and he did come and answer
[1:08:56] later in in a dream or a vision he'd
[1:08:58] come back and there was a light that
[1:08:59] come and a furnace that come and passed
[1:09:02] between those two pieces confirming to
[1:09:04] Abraham you can read it later but until
[1:09:05] then he set the right sacrifice how many
[1:09:07] believe this morning we have the right
[1:09:08] sacrifice how many believe it's a
[1:09:10] perfect sacrifice how many believe
[1:09:12] without it we're lost
[1:09:14] and he wants us to worship under that
[1:09:17] sacrifice there's no other place to
[1:09:19] worship where my God accepts the worship
[1:09:21] that under the shed blood of Jesus
[1:09:23] Christ that's it it's simple it's not
[1:09:26] any more complicated than that and the
[1:09:29] message came to remind us of that
[1:09:31] sacrifice oh Hallelujah the message came
[1:09:34] to push back all the fouls and all the
[1:09:37] traditions and all the Creeds that was
[1:09:38] messing with the pure sacrifice once he
[1:09:41] gets all that out of the way we can
[1:09:42] worship freely we can worship purely
[1:09:46] Hallelujah
[1:09:50] so in this time of worship
[1:09:53] to being right you stay here and worship
[1:09:54] under this pure sacrifice notice God
[1:09:56] gave the promise God gave a covenant God
[1:09:58] gave the sacrifice let me raise your
[1:10:01] hands we're blessed with the same thing
[1:10:02] we've got a promise of this hour to be
[1:10:04] fulfilled we've got a Covenant of Grace
[1:10:06] over our lives we heard about last
[1:10:08] Sunday and we've got the right sacrifice
[1:10:11] we got everything that we need
[1:10:13] to worship Him freely and purely
[1:10:19] and then
[1:10:20] my final subject is out of verse 11
[1:10:23] perfect promise the pure Covenant the
[1:10:28] pure sacrifice and verse 11 speaks
[1:10:31] volumes because guess what Abraham had
[1:10:34] to drive away fouls
[1:10:37] from trying to taint the sacrifice
[1:10:43] I just believe that if Abraham had to do
[1:10:46] that
[1:10:47] and we're Abraham's seed
[1:10:49] we have to do it as well
[1:10:54] and I'm going to say some things this
[1:10:56] morning that are relation to this that
[1:10:58] I've been wanting to say the lord gave
[1:10:59] me the scripture a couple months ago and
[1:11:02] now I'm just getting to it I just was
[1:11:04] struggling yesterday said Lord what do
[1:11:06] you want me to speak I don't want to
[1:11:07] speak my own mind I want to speak you
[1:11:09] give me something fresh had to wait till
[1:11:10] tomorrow last night till about six seven
[1:11:13] o'clock I stayed in all day I didn't go
[1:11:15] I was supposed to take some paint cans
[1:11:16] to the recycle completely forgot it
[1:11:19] because I started studying at eight in
[1:11:20] the morning stayed all day and I I
[1:11:23] couldn't get the mind of the Lord until
[1:11:25] finally something struck through about
[1:11:26] six seven o'clock and he spoke to my
[1:11:29] heart and he led me back to this
[1:11:32] scripture
[1:11:34] I thank the Lord for speaking to me
[1:11:38] when I was a young Minister and I went
[1:11:40] to Brother Lonnie to Europe I don't know
[1:11:41] if I ever told you this but I got the
[1:11:43] greatest lesson for a young minister
[1:11:45] I wrote her brother Lonnie I went to the
[1:11:47] trip just to carry his bags for the rap
[1:11:49] just to carry his bags because I knew
[1:11:51] nobody knows asked me to preach because
[1:11:54] well
[1:11:56] I was young in Europe they didn't use
[1:11:57] young ministers then they didn't believe
[1:12:00] in them now they do and they're having
[1:12:02] me and brother rap
[1:12:04] which I'm so glad in in Holland at a
[1:12:07] family camp in no in November second
[1:12:09] week in November so guess they're having
[1:12:11] young ministers now rap they changed
[1:12:13] when I was around young ministers they
[1:12:15] didn't believe in them it had to be
[1:12:17] older seniors
[1:12:18] and so I don't know why I said that but
[1:12:20] anyway I was there right in the car and
[1:12:23] I got in the car because this other
[1:12:25] Pastor from Norway brother Ryerson was
[1:12:27] sitting in the seat he rode to church
[1:12:28] with us so we're sitting there beloney
[1:12:30] and them and I got in the car and they
[1:12:32] let me do a youth meeting that morning I
[1:12:34] was preaching a youth meeting I had
[1:12:35] studied all night getting ready for it
[1:12:36] and
[1:12:39] we get in the car and the car's quiet
[1:12:40] and sister Ryerson
[1:12:42] she looked over to me in like a glow on
[1:12:45] her face and she you could tell she had
[1:12:47] been praying for the service herself
[1:12:48] very Godly woman had reached just the
[1:12:52] levels of just a walk with the Lord that
[1:12:54] I I so loved that and desire that and
[1:12:57] she looked over at me and she goes
[1:12:59] hath the Lord spoken to you this morning
[1:13:02] brother Paul
[1:13:07] I don't know if you knew her brother
[1:13:08] Stephen but hath the Lord spoken to you
[1:13:12] this morning brother Paul you talk about
[1:13:13] a challenging question
[1:13:16] and I got more wisdom as a young
[1:13:18] Minister because it was like it was like
[1:13:21] she was saying
[1:13:22] if the Lord hasn't spoken to you I'm not
[1:13:24] even sure I want to go to church
[1:13:26] [Applause]
[1:13:28] because she had grown like this isn't
[1:13:31] about you just putting things together
[1:13:32] as a sermon and preaching sermon and
[1:13:34] trying to impress everybody hath the
[1:13:36] Lord spoken to you brother Paul
[1:13:38] talk about a seminary I learned a lot
[1:13:41] and that's what my desire has been three
[1:13:43] years I don't want to preach sermons I
[1:13:45] don't want to be the greatest preacher
[1:13:46] in the message I don't want to compete I
[1:13:48] don't want to fight I have nothing to do
[1:13:49] with that I just want to find the mind
[1:13:52] of the Lord and preach it to my people
[1:13:54] it's just that simple
[1:13:57] and that's why the Lord spoke to me I
[1:13:59] like to say that not to make myself
[1:14:00] spiritual but you wait on the Lord you
[1:14:02] labor in the Lord I would love for some
[1:14:05] of you instead of some of the other
[1:14:06] things you do Saturday night oh boy do I
[1:14:09] need to get on this I would like you to
[1:14:11] prepare your hearts
[1:14:15] instead of watching a bunch of movies or
[1:14:17] whatever you do and this that and the
[1:14:18] other maybe settle down Saturday and
[1:14:20] join in prayer with me that there might
[1:14:23] be somebody that needs the Holy Ghost
[1:14:24] there might be somebody in these
[1:14:26] Deliverance I'm praying that God deals
[1:14:28] with the minister this morning and I'm
[1:14:30] going to come pray it up for the service
[1:14:33] instead maybe you gossiped about
[1:14:34] everything that's going on and made it
[1:14:36] normal in your life I think we should
[1:14:38] become spiritual and prayer warriors
[1:14:39] that we should start joining in with the
[1:14:42] rest of the body of Christ
[1:14:46] and maybe I'll ask you
[1:14:48] hath the Lord spoken to you this morning
[1:14:50] people of God
[1:14:57] so Abraham he's got to drive away the
[1:15:01] fowls from the sacrifice there will
[1:15:03] always be an enemy that's trying to
[1:15:07] taint our worship
[1:15:11] as a matter of fact he's at the point of
[1:15:13] worship he's at the point
[1:15:16] he's he's there around the sacrifice and
[1:15:20] the worship to imitate it to misdirect
[1:15:23] it because if it's the right sacrifice
[1:15:26] and it's the right worshiper with the
[1:15:28] right heart a lot of powerful things can
[1:15:30] happen right there
[1:15:34] so we have an enemy by this type that's
[1:15:36] flying around coming down
[1:15:39] and Abraham has to keep he has to keep
[1:15:43] shoeing this stuff away from the
[1:15:46] sacrifice to keep it simple to keep it
[1:15:49] pure
[1:15:50] amen
[1:15:53] there will always be an enemy trying to
[1:15:55] attain our worship
[1:15:56] trying to defile our worship
[1:15:59] and I think it should be pure
[1:16:02] I think it should be simple I think it
[1:16:04] should be sincere and if anything else
[1:16:06] comes around I got some stuff Wednesday
[1:16:08] night talk about uh
[1:16:12] uh
[1:16:13] a minister saying
[1:16:16] Spurgeon and he elaborates on this and
[1:16:19] he's just elaborating on all the
[1:16:20] thoughts that come to us while we're in
[1:16:21] church
[1:16:23] I'm gonna read something to you it's
[1:16:24] powerful
[1:16:25] evil thoughts and thoughts of business
[1:16:28] and
[1:16:30] when you come in you got to shoot all
[1:16:33] that stuff away so you can worship
[1:16:35] freely
[1:16:37] it's powerful I want to read it praise
[1:16:40] the Lord but you know what we have to
[1:16:42] keep this off of our sacrifice you know
[1:16:44] I'm always looking for a little cue
[1:16:46] especially yesterday on what to preach
[1:16:48] you know and I remember yesterday
[1:16:49] morning something triggered in my heart
[1:16:51] something one of my daughters said
[1:16:53] and I wouldn't say the name and I want
[1:16:55] to embarrass him but they said something
[1:16:56] really stuck with me and it's related to
[1:16:58] this subject a little bit I'm always
[1:17:00] like I'm always looking for a little cue
[1:17:01] for a sermon maybe that's why people are
[1:17:04] nervous to be around me
[1:17:06] foreign
[1:17:09] but uh
[1:17:11] this subject opened up a little bit
[1:17:13] because my daughter said just and not
[1:17:15] not bitter but I'm so tired of all the
[1:17:18] drama and the stuff and the fighting
[1:17:21] that goes on in our ranks in the message
[1:17:27] I don't want to hear any of it she said
[1:17:29] I just want to stay simple serving the
[1:17:31] lord
[1:17:35] and I've spoken from the heart
[1:17:42] and brother Chris addressed it he said
[1:17:44] the unbeliever May hesitate coming if he
[1:17:47] gets online
[1:17:49] or if he comes in and sees there's
[1:17:51] nothing but Division and device of
[1:17:52] things being said the lack of love and
[1:17:54] respect they might not even come and he
[1:17:56] said what a shame they would even darken
[1:17:58] the door because they've already
[1:17:59] concluded they don't know the doctrines
[1:18:01] we believe they don't know they don't
[1:18:02] even know the prophet we believe they
[1:18:04] don't they're going to base it upon the
[1:18:05] Harmony and the unity and the love and
[1:18:07] the respect they see amongst the people
[1:18:09] not a device of spirit
[1:18:14] I think he was right
[1:18:16] Paul Harvey I'm trying to track this
[1:18:19] down but I was told by a reputable
[1:18:21] Minister one time that Paul Harvey who
[1:18:23] was a radio host in the nation he's
[1:18:24] passed away now he was presented with
[1:18:27] the message and he was presented with um
[1:18:30] what the group that believes the message
[1:18:32] of the last days through the prophet
[1:18:34] William Branham and he he so he he
[1:18:37] looked into it and this was his comment
[1:18:39] Paul Harvey about it he said don't worry
[1:18:41] about that group they're no threat to
[1:18:44] anything because there's so much
[1:18:45] division among them that they can't even
[1:18:48] get it together among themselves
[1:18:51] now I don't like to say things like that
[1:18:53] because I don't like to present in a
[1:18:54] negative I like to talk about the
[1:18:57] positive because there's more positive
[1:18:58] going on than there is negative
[1:19:00] I don't like to say that because people
[1:19:02] take that yeah that's right and they
[1:19:03] become negative themselves and you know
[1:19:05] there's been even people say because all
[1:19:06] that you know I'm ditching the message
[1:19:08] when you don't know what the message is
[1:19:10] because it's not that it's the message
[1:19:13] of Christ for the last days to bring us
[1:19:15] back to Bible faith
[1:19:17] that's the message
[1:19:20] but I don't want to be too negative but
[1:19:22] here's a man saying it's no threat
[1:19:24] because there's just so much going on in
[1:19:26] so many different doctrines and things
[1:19:28] so I only say that to say that was the
[1:19:30] rules great statement by my daughter
[1:19:32] because I get the same thing and so uh
[1:19:35] when you hear that I could get angry I
[1:19:37] could close in my shell uh I I I I could
[1:19:40] have take a certain attitude towards
[1:19:42] that I don't want that but I do want to
[1:19:45] reflect what my daughter said that I
[1:19:47] really want to keep this simple what the
[1:19:49] message is and I just don't want to part
[1:19:52] be part of any fighting I want to just
[1:19:54] serve god with sincerely sincerity and
[1:19:57] godly fear and just let him speak to me
[1:20:00] through the message and keep it simple
[1:20:02] and keep the fouls off the sacrifice
[1:20:06] Hallelujah
[1:20:09] I have to realize there's a true thing
[1:20:11] that God sent it's a pure word it's a
[1:20:13] pure message it's a pure promise it's a
[1:20:15] strong Covenant
[1:20:17] the person of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:20:20] we love has been revealed through this
[1:20:21] message I'm answering a question here
[1:20:23] it's his word it's God's word this
[1:20:26] message brought me closer to the person
[1:20:28] of Christ and it revealed more of him
[1:20:31] it's not any more complicated than that
[1:20:33] you say the message is Christ the
[1:20:35] message revealed Jesus Christ the person
[1:20:37] of Christ
[1:20:40] pull up Hagee eye 1 and verse 13. I love
[1:20:43] this scripture if you wanted to know if
[1:20:45] the term the message is in the Bible
[1:20:47] yes it is Hagee eye 1 and verse 13. hege
[1:20:50] I one verse 13. then spake haggai the
[1:20:55] Lord's messenger in the Lord's message
[1:21:03] oh I liked it anyway
[1:21:05] then spake hagai the prophet the Lord's
[1:21:08] messenger in the Lord's message unto the
[1:21:11] people saying I Am with You saith the
[1:21:15] Lord so here we have the messenger and
[1:21:19] the message
[1:21:22] that's what we have in the last days
[1:21:25] but I want to remind everybody
[1:21:27] whose is it
[1:21:34] it's the Lord's
[1:21:35] it's the Lord's messenger
[1:21:37] and those are really two different
[1:21:39] things even though they're coordinated
[1:21:40] together but they're two things
[1:21:41] especially when the messenger goes off
[1:21:42] the scene the emphasis is not in the
[1:21:44] messenger's life as much it's on the
[1:21:46] message that he brought
[1:21:47] you see you understand but they both
[1:21:50] come from the lord it's this is not
[1:21:53] William branham's message
[1:21:57] this is not my message
[1:21:59] this is actually the message the Lord
[1:22:02] Jesus Christ this is Christ and he sent
[1:22:06] the messenger and he sent the message
[1:22:10] this is why the devil fights against
[1:22:13] this more than anything else this shout
[1:22:15] to be a Vindication and Confirmation to
[1:22:16] us why is it that this thing has fought
[1:22:20] against so much has come against so much
[1:22:22] and there's so much fighting going on
[1:22:23] around it and there's so much doubt now
[1:22:25] he's not the messenger of somebody else
[1:22:27] there's some why is there so much
[1:22:28] controversy for all these years around
[1:22:31] this messenger and around this message
[1:22:33] it could be the reason that it's the
[1:22:37] Lord's
[1:22:39] did you ever think it's the Lord's and
[1:22:42] that's why the devil is fighting it so
[1:22:44] much
[1:22:48] so if we know that we're not going to
[1:22:50] get rid of it we're not going to get rid
[1:22:51] of the controversy but we are going to
[1:22:54] be part of shoeing the fowls away
[1:22:58] that complicated
[1:23:01] is anybody on board with me there's
[1:23:03] anybody picking up what I'm laying down
[1:23:05] we are part of shoeing these fouls that
[1:23:08] try to pervert the sacrifice and pervert
[1:23:11] our worship and get us off to one side
[1:23:13] of fanaticism or one side to starchism
[1:23:16] I'm telling you I want the middle of the
[1:23:18] road of this word
[1:23:20] said the powers in the middle of the
[1:23:22] road the powers in the middle of the
[1:23:24] road not to one side he says you come to
[1:23:26] the Lord and he says over time he said
[1:23:28] the devil will try to take you off into
[1:23:30] fanaticism or take you off into
[1:23:32] starchism and intellectualism but he
[1:23:34] says the real power of God is right in
[1:23:36] the middle of the road I want to stay in
[1:23:38] the middle of the road
[1:23:40] I want to worship freely with all my
[1:23:42] heart and I want to be taught as a son
[1:23:44] and daughter a Son of God the principles
[1:23:46] of God
[1:23:48] praise the Lord
[1:23:53] because it is from the Lord there will
[1:23:55] be a lot of imbalances and fanaticism
[1:23:57] because the devil even knows it's the
[1:23:59] Lord's messenger and message in fact it
[1:24:02] should be assigned to us that it is
[1:24:03] right it's so misused and so attacked
[1:24:08] I don't believe other prophets and I
[1:24:10] don't believe other ministers
[1:24:12] even Billy Graham or any of the
[1:24:15] prominent Ministers of that generation
[1:24:16] are attacked
[1:24:19] like this messenger has been attacked
[1:24:23] but I'm like my father Abraham chewing
[1:24:25] the files off this keep it pure and
[1:24:26] simple the fowls what are we shooting
[1:24:28] off
[1:24:30] why are we shooting off the table of
[1:24:32] sacrifice the fowls
[1:24:34] the fouses
[1:24:36] files of worldliness you're creeping in
[1:24:41] get off of there
[1:24:43] and remember I was taught this as a
[1:24:45] young Minister worship worship
[1:24:48] is more than just raising our hands in
[1:24:51] church
[1:24:52] worship is your everyday life worship
[1:24:55] before God it's your life that you live
[1:24:58] I want to remind everybody of that it's
[1:25:00] not just you clap your hands and you
[1:25:01] sang loud in church worship is so much
[1:25:04] deeper than that
[1:25:06] it's keeping the the fowls of
[1:25:08] worldliness
[1:25:11] preachers Don't Preach on modesty and
[1:25:14] clothes
[1:25:16] and movies every once in a while
[1:25:22] if we don't
[1:25:25] say it every once in a while
[1:25:28] then then the files are going to take
[1:25:30] over
[1:25:34] somebody's got to say it
[1:25:37] if he doesn't talk about music the wrong
[1:25:39] kind of music if I'm asking you to join
[1:25:41] me because ministers true ministers do
[1:25:43] this they're shoeing the files off the
[1:25:46] sacrifice my worship can't be tainted
[1:25:48] with Christian rock music and country
[1:25:51] music and rock and roll music and
[1:25:53] Christian rock My Worship can't be
[1:25:55] tainted because that's tainted worship
[1:26:00] that's tainted worship
[1:26:02] even for our own assembly I have no
[1:26:05] problem correcting I rarely have to
[1:26:07] correct it because I see the heart of
[1:26:08] the musicians but if there's a boundary
[1:26:10] or something is something overrides the
[1:26:12] true pure worship and it goes too far
[1:26:15] I'm all over it
[1:26:18] become the bad guy sometimes I rarely
[1:26:20] have to do it thank the Lord here but
[1:26:21] I'm willing to do it because
[1:26:23] everywhere worship's going on the
[1:26:25] devil's there to taint it
[1:26:28] come on you don't think the devil's
[1:26:30] around music
[1:26:32] around worship of music
[1:26:34] Satan trying to taint music
[1:26:36] change it to a performance change it to
[1:26:39] celebrities
[1:26:40] to take the Purity and the sincerity out
[1:26:43] of worship
[1:26:49] I'm always at my post to watch something
[1:26:51] sneak in
[1:26:55] I think we need the balance of free
[1:26:56] worship and borrowing from what others
[1:26:58] do too much
[1:27:00] borrowing from others who don't have the
[1:27:02] absolutes that we have
[1:27:05] everything is not okay
[1:27:07] music is not immoral
[1:27:10] I mean by that
[1:27:12] is that people say that music by itself
[1:27:14] without words music is immoral there's
[1:27:16] no morality or immorality with it that's
[1:27:19] not true music by itself can have an
[1:27:22] immoral spirit with it
[1:27:24] so you keep this
[1:27:25] let me get off of that
[1:27:28] you you're shooing away all the wrong
[1:27:31] doctrines that's come around the message
[1:27:32] the deity doctrine that makes brother
[1:27:35] Branham Jesus Christ
[1:27:40] the doctrines that say we're already in
[1:27:43] the millennium
[1:27:47] you're in the Millennium already
[1:27:49] I'm in the millennium I'm very
[1:27:51] disappointed
[1:27:55] I'm shooting that one away
[1:27:57] that's tainted and you use quotes to
[1:28:00] prove it but I don't want to hear your
[1:28:02] quotes
[1:28:03] that's a foul trying to make this thing
[1:28:06] complicated from the Simplicity of this
[1:28:09] sacrifice can you say man
[1:28:13] doctrinal fouls competition
[1:28:17] legalism coming off the message
[1:28:22] come on say amen that's exact
[1:28:25] ly and we've had a lot of it people say
[1:28:28] there's they're not supposed to be doing
[1:28:29] that and I say well where's it at where
[1:28:30] show me where it's at and they say well
[1:28:32] it's somewhere well show me where it's
[1:28:34] at because I want to preach that to my
[1:28:36] whole congregation and they're all going
[1:28:37] to be doing that I better know that it's
[1:28:40] there
[1:28:41] there's a lot of things years ago
[1:28:43] that people quoted I don't know for the
[1:28:45] kins here today but we love to go over
[1:28:47] this because he was in the early years
[1:28:48] in the message and we always bring up
[1:28:51] those things that was quoted across the
[1:28:53] pulpit somebody does yes brother Brandon
[1:28:55] said this brother and you go find it you
[1:28:57] can't find it
[1:28:58] you need to wear this and and that was
[1:29:00] legalism coming from a Holiness
[1:29:02] background attaching itself to this
[1:29:05] message no no don't add your stuff to it
[1:29:07] don't add or take away I believe what he
[1:29:10] said and I believe everything's
[1:29:11] important that he said but don't add to
[1:29:12] it
[1:29:14] you just chew it away
[1:29:16] I shoe way legalism I shoe away
[1:29:18] formalism intellectualism
[1:29:21] I believe in the moving of the spirit of
[1:29:23] God
[1:29:25] some people don't think I believe that I
[1:29:26] believe with all my heart we've had it
[1:29:27] here for 35 years we're going to keep
[1:29:29] doing it preach the word you want to
[1:29:31] shout dance if you want to whatever you
[1:29:33] need to do but if you get excited about
[1:29:34] the word and God changed in your life
[1:29:35] worship as the Lord it dictates to you
[1:29:38] I don't want formalism I want I don't
[1:29:40] want just quotes I don't want you coming
[1:29:42] and bringing your iPad like I got and
[1:29:44] just going through all the quotes and
[1:29:45] checking me and making sure that I'm
[1:29:48] saying everything right and
[1:29:51] I say something wrong then you go nope
[1:29:54] not in here
[1:29:58] this is about the Holy Spirit working in
[1:30:00] our lives it's not about intellectually
[1:30:01] understanding all the quotes and
[1:30:03] scriptures
[1:30:05] formalism intellectualism extreme
[1:30:08] emotionalism we're shooting those fouls
[1:30:10] off bitterness
[1:30:12] yeah
[1:30:14] anger
[1:30:16] we got some Angry Birds that come around
[1:30:20] playing some Angry Birds
[1:30:22] some of you older ones don't know what
[1:30:24] I'm talking about
[1:30:26] get some Angry Birds around the
[1:30:28] sacrifice there's angry people I'm
[1:30:30] shooting those anger Spirits away
[1:30:32] disrespect
[1:30:34] Pride of the message I'm shooting it
[1:30:36] away get rid of that Pride
[1:30:39] that says we're the only ones that have
[1:30:41] truth and we're the only ones that's
[1:30:43] right
[1:30:44] you ought to Rejoice what God is doing
[1:30:46] wherever it's at my wife showed me a
[1:30:48] testimony of a black man that was
[1:30:50] baptized in an Apostolic Church the
[1:30:52] other day he was completely blind had
[1:30:54] been blind for a long time when he come
[1:30:56] out by to being baptized in the name of
[1:30:57] Jesus Christ his eyes were open and they
[1:31:00] began to shout
[1:31:04] Hallelujah
[1:31:07] that didn't happen in our own ranks but
[1:31:10] God did it
[1:31:11] God did it and I Rejoice on what God
[1:31:14] does
[1:31:15] wherever it may be they might not preach
[1:31:17] the full truth they might do that but
[1:31:19] I'm not going to label them whatever God
[1:31:21] does in a life we ought to celebrate it
[1:31:22] can you say man you never get that Pride
[1:31:25] to belittle somebody get behind me this
[1:31:27] morning this is hard to preach but I'm
[1:31:29] tired of the The Pride that comes around
[1:31:31] that we've got a a monopoly on truth and
[1:31:34] we're the only ones that's right and I
[1:31:37] don't like that Pride can you say Amen
[1:31:38] we need humility in the Holy Ghost
[1:31:42] we need the true sincere look at this
[1:31:45] message and what it is and to manifest
[1:31:46] what it really is
[1:31:51] chew away the fowls
[1:31:53] of unforgiving spirits and Hate
[1:32:00] I always wonder why I was
[1:32:03] years ago there was a boy that come to a
[1:32:05] youth meeting and he
[1:32:07] was jumping on top of one of the girls
[1:32:09] or she on top of him I can't remember
[1:32:10] now
[1:32:12] but I was all over that
[1:32:14] I said that's not what we do around here
[1:32:17] there's not some people offended about
[1:32:18] about it I said I'm supposed to leave
[1:32:20] that alone when he's acting
[1:32:21] inappropriately
[1:32:24] I always feel bad about these things
[1:32:27] but I realize now scripture hits
[1:32:29] it's the pastor
[1:32:31] keeping the fouls away
[1:32:34] I didn't tell him to leave I just said
[1:32:35] don't do that again
[1:32:36] but he left he's not serving the lord
[1:32:38] today because he couldn't take
[1:32:39] correction but I'm not going to let that
[1:32:41] go by and I've had to do tons of these
[1:32:43] things you don't realize sometimes what
[1:32:44] has to be just just brought back in
[1:32:47] place so we can enjoy even this
[1:32:49] sanctuary
[1:32:51] we don't bring coffees in here
[1:32:54] we dedicate this place as holy unto the
[1:32:56] Lord we worship in here we're not going
[1:32:58] to have lunch in here
[1:33:01] but if I didn't shoo that away because
[1:33:03] of the modern Church some of you would
[1:33:05] be bringing your coffees eventually and
[1:33:07] asking if you can bring them in
[1:33:10] you don't think that's true it's true
[1:33:13] somebody's got to shoot that far away
[1:33:16] the worship needs to stay pure and
[1:33:18] simple before God
[1:33:20] untainted it's not that coffee's evil
[1:33:25] boy I'd really be in trouble if I preach
[1:33:27] that
[1:33:28] man I'd have a bunch of people leaving
[1:33:30] my church
[1:33:31] and I'd leave myself
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:40] what am I doing when I have to speak up
[1:33:42] and correct our young boys for
[1:33:43] inappropriate foolish sexual talk in the
[1:33:46] youth group
[1:33:48] I'm shooting the fouls away
[1:33:51] you don't start that in here
[1:33:53] stop I don't know where you learned that
[1:33:54] stop talking like that stop texting
[1:33:56] people like that
[1:33:59] somebody's got to do it I I wish me to
[1:34:01] be more people help me
[1:34:05] the files away from the sacrifice
[1:34:10] I love him this morning I love you I got
[1:34:12] to end this now
[1:34:13] and I'm going to go now into
[1:34:16] a little bit of not right now but I'm
[1:34:18] going to go from this point
[1:34:19] into
[1:34:21] worship and into
[1:34:23] the evidence of the Holy Ghost there's
[1:34:25] many subjects that break from here
[1:34:28] and I want to go into those things and
[1:34:31] talk about them
[1:34:33] clearly and plainly
[1:34:37] but
[1:34:39] I think that we need to we're in a time
[1:34:42] where we want to bring pure
[1:34:45] we're coming to communion tonight
[1:34:49] Paul said eat the bread
[1:34:51] of sincerity and Truth
[1:34:55] unleavened bread

[1:35:01] communion that's the last thing brother
[1:35:03] Bram says before he leaves this Earth as
[1:35:06] a car accident the Lord takes him his
[1:35:08] last sentence is let's just be reverent
