========================================

as you're seated god bless you yeah i be i began to read this a few months ago and as i've told you before i'm intrigued now by the minor prophets and the prophets in my early christian journey those were books i kind of stayed away from because there was so much symbolism and it's so difficult to understand now i love really to read the prophets and the minor prophets and see those things and if you take some time god can open those things to you but i begin reading this about jonah towards the end of his life and it's um it's quite mysterious uh it's quite a mysterious way that jonah's second chapter of his life ends very mysterious uh very and many commentators and many people have tried to comment on it and bring out different things about it and i think it's quite interesting the way that really really the whole story of jonah is a bit a bit of a strange story and you know when you have god directing a big fish to swallow his son and transport him back to his will that's kind of a strange story already and then the bible says that god spoke to the fish and tells him to spit him out and vomit him on the shore god spoke to a fish so you know this is not a normal story by any means but we don't serve a normal god we don't serve a god who does everything uh like we expect it sometimes we don't serve a god that is just catering to make outcomes the way that you want them and there's one thing that i find in the in the book of jonah and the story here is he is a son of god and so because he is a son of god god continues to deal with him it's not like he's a serpent see her as something he's not a son of god he is his son and brother brahman says he's not even a backslider we say oh he's just being a jonah and we call him backside her brother said i stand up for jonah he wasn't backsliding he he said he actually becomes an example of all of us in some of his actions and some of his running away from the presence of god might as well admit it we're the same way sometimes but one thing that i learned and i hope i can bring many things out of the book of jonah the next few sundays or whatever but one thing that you need to catch is that there's certainly a theme here that if you are expecting god to do a certain thing with your own mind and not open to the holy spirit god can come around and do something completely opposite of what you're expecting and yet his ways are higher than our ways and we have to learn as sons to submit to the way god wants to do things so it's a strange story and god speaks to the fish and and you know there's a lot of strange things going on and there's things that you would not see god in many times and the prophet said what a sad ending when he's when he spoke of uh even jonah when he when he was told go to nineveh and preach to them and he got on a ship to tarshish running away from it and going on vacation he said he said it's very strange and he also said it's very sad that's the way he comments he says it's a very sad ending and then as you read the rest of the book of jonah it gets to me even more sad how jonah responds to god's power and god doing things the way he decided to do them it's really sad how jonah responds to it and so it kind of gets worse as you go along but and you know we americans we are used to um we've been taught we're used to happy endings stories uh we like stories that have happy endings we're we're the disney culture we've grown up on disney world and disney world got us in a flow of you know these these things and there's a story line and then uh then there's trouble in the middle and but but all of them all of them all of them end in a happy happily ever after can you say amen so you know and i'm not against that i don't think a a person's life can live in any happier than a christian that's filled with the holy ghost i believe in but i believe in true happiness i don't believe in fake happiness can you say amen i believe in god's happiness i believe in god's joy not the worldly type joy but we have been taught that every story needs to end a certain way and we've been taught to expect things to end a certain way and this is where people get in trouble with god and get angry with god is because your story line of your life if it's not turning out to what you expect you can develop feelings of resentment and anger not just towards people but towards god because why you had a certain thing in your mind and you prayed for a certain thing and you had it kind of set the way things were supposed to turn out i believe god has his way that things are supposed to turn out and the quicker that we can say lord i submit to that and i am happy with your will no matter what it may be that's when we're coming to maturity as sons and if you're not there this morning i'm not fully there yet but if you're not there that's when you say lord i come to the altar this morning i want to be there that i trust your ways are higher than mine your thoughts are higher than my thoughts that's where we need to grow to so you know and i believe there is a true happy ending for the bride of jesus christ but i i would say this that if there's a happy ending for the bride i don't think it's the complete happiness in this world because this world does not give us final and true happiness but when you talk about a rapture when you talk about a change of a body when you talk about this holy ghost that we love and are living by is going to turn into a new body and go into a millennium a honeymoon with the lord that's a happy ending but happy endings don't always happen on this earth every once in a while we have a temporal thing and we rejoice in it and god gives us true contentment and joy in this life that's because of the holy ghost not because you got a new car or a new truck or a new house or a new job that's not our contentment but when the lord gives you a revelation and something settles in your heart that's when true happiness comes but ultimately we're not going to have it in this world there's not going to be a complete happy ending in this world there's going to be trouble there's going to be persecution there's going to be family problems and it will continue because of the world that we live in but there is a happy ending for the holy ghost filled believers can you say amen there will be a change of the body there will be ultimate healing where you'll never get sick again there will be relationships restored can you say amen and there will be a millennium that we spend with perfect peace on this earth hallelujah so uh the the the the bible doesn't end it here in a normal thing at least in our eyes so i kept loving it leaving along and going back to it and pondering it and and so much of this is related to a son which has been spoken about the brother burley and different brothers now so much of this related to a son being corrected by the father and that's related to adoption a son being corrected by the father to cause him to grow and mature this is if if we want to see adoption we can see it in the life of jonah we're in the age of adoption we're in the time of adoption we're not in the time of the birth of the church we don't just emphasize salvation in christ although today you can be saved in jesus christ but it's not the age of just salvation that's why we have a church world that mostly emphasized salvation as long as somebody comes in salvation that's it that's the end and even pentecost did that brother brown says pentecost that's where you failed you thought because of the birth of the son that was it he said but no there's an adoption there's a placing of the son and in that placing in maturity the father deals with the son as a son and takes him through things to teach him how to become more mature through his trials we're in that time right now can you say amen you can go on and say well i was saved 30 years ago at the camp and god dealt with me back then i'm okay now you can go and do it all you want to but the time where the holy spirit is dealing with us as sons and he's looking for mature sons and daughters to carry out his kingdom in a mature way and we learn that through the trials that we go through in dealing with our specific predestinated trials that he gives us so this is the father dealing this special way with his son jonah i want to remind us of what the prophet said he says jonah becomes an example of us all that's the way he says it jonah becomes an example of us all i think all includes oh so you can't look over to your neighbor this morning and say how yeah he's been a jonah for sure this is this service is for him brother brahm says jonah is an example of us all right preachers deacons everybody so when we look at his life then we don't say well he's a jonah he's a backsider he's a you know he's a worldly person now he's a son of god but he sure is not acting like a son of god and he's got issues with running away from the presence of the lord and he's got issues with anger and that's the title of my sermon this morning jonah's anger and attitude so i don't know it'll be a shouting revival service but it all depends on how you relate to it so now you know he becomes an example of us all so no one is left out this morning he's a his life is the type of our life as a son and in other words this this writing in the bible is part of your spiritual biography it's laying right here in the bible it's part of your spiritual journey and part of your spiritual biography the prophet said he wasn't a backsider uh he was not an unbeliever but but jonah gets a bad rap many times that he's a he's a backslider but he but but brother brown says i i'm taking up for him i've always took up for jonah uh and in the first chapter of his life he had a problem running from the responsibility that came with the word that god give him and the word was given to him and he run from it he run from the presence of the lord he run from the word that was given he run from responsibility and brother brown brings out in running from the presence of the lord it he takes an easy route he says that's the type of us all we're always looking the for the easy way out of things an easy an easy christian walk an easy way and he took he took that and to serve the lord isn't always an easy way so he come through a great lesson and god taught him that he can run and he teaches us that you can run but you can't hide you can run from god and from his presence but god is everywhere trying to bring you back to the word because you are a son you can run from god all you want to but brother braham said to us god is in everything when he jumped in the boat god was in the boat when he was in the whale god was in the whale can you say a man i don't care how far you run if you're a son of god god going to be in every little thing to bring you back why because you are a son because you are his daughter somebody else can run away and that's not going to be a big deal but a son and daughter of god god is going to be out there somewhere looking for you god's going to be speaking through some neighbor can you say amen god might speak through a donkey god may speak through a fish but he's doing it because he's got a son that's rebellious and running from the presence of the lord you can run but you can't hide you young people you go and you've got thoughts so i'm tired of this i want to get out of this cage that i'm in listen if you're a son and daughter of god you're better off to submit now because god is your life you can run from your parents you can think you're running from god but he's going to love you right back to his throne to love you back and that's our god that's how he deals with sons a lot of other people might give up on you but god's not going to give up on you he don't run his kingdom like that god's not an indian giver he doesn't give something then take it back god doesn't do anything halfway god doesn't save you to lose you in the end he's serious about it he's serious about his work and those that continue in my word they are not my disciples he that hath begun a good work in you he will be faithful to complete it oh i love him this morning so he come through the great lesson god told him you can run but you can't god taught him you can run but you can't hide it's grace that keeps dealing with such unfaithfulness and i'll say that for my own life and yours it's grace that god continues to deal with our unfaithfulness and like i said a few weeks ago i don't want to be unfaithful to him i don't want to be unfaithful anymore he's faithful to me but i want to be faithful to him so let me just skip some of this so when he is supernaturally survive he survives supernaturally three days in a big fish he's vomited out on the shores of nineveh god providing transportation even back to his responsibility he didn't have jonah going back and getting off the ship swimming his way to shore and then take the chance of him running away again god provided uber an uber whale they had it back then you know god paid the fare and it said he spoke to the fish you know and directed him and god provided transportation to his son and took him right back to the shores of nineveh and that worked out well because nineveh had a fish god so you can imagine now jonah's being vomited out of a big fish god knows what he's doing he already had favor with the people and so now god brings them back and you knew like i said i want to move on because i know you know that part of the story but i want to bring wanted to bring some points out of it that that that the correction that god gave brings them back as a on in the fish and transports and that that that's all the correction that he needed because then we we find that he he got back to the commission and he did what he was told to do and we know that part of the story but there's obviously from the story there's more deeper things in jonah that's quite surprising and i'll just say it this way we would think that that's all the correction jonah needed and that's quite a correction that's quite a that's quite a story and it's quite a thing from god imagine jonah being vomited out of this fish now and he's seen god in all of it and you say you got to be able to conclude and say god is in my life it's time to surrender and thank you lord for correcting me guess what jonah still needed there was other things in him that needed to be corrected there were more inner things not outward things that he would pay a fair and go to tarshish instead of nineveh they were more inner things that needed to be corrected that maybe you couldn't see they were deeper things in jonah that was quite surprising and they had to be manifest and come out and he had to be corrected for those things it would be nice if jonah just settled down now but but he's not settled yet he's not settled he's still up and down in his attitude he's still unfaithful in his attitude that should have been enough but still he's unsettled in his spirit he's unfaithful in his spirit he's up and down may god help us if there's anything been resonating in me god lead me by the holy spirit as a pastor and as a people may we move ourselves out of this unfaithful up and down go for a few weeks in church and then you're out for a few weeks and one day you're reading your bible and you don't look at it for another six months may god in his mercy somehow use me or use somebody in your life to pull you out of that unfaithfulness god have mercy on us that we stay in relationship with him every day and so now we see then that uh brother brahm says in this first quote he said the principle the reason the principle reason that i believe that he did this thing right here was because jonah was a jew so now brother adam and these messages starts to get in the reasons why jonah did things and in the first quote that i sent you guys there if you have it the reason the principal reason that i believe that he did this great thing here was because jonah was a jew and he was asked to go to a gentile city to cry out against it thinking that he would not be received because the gentiles would think what's this jew got to do with us but you see another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that god not only is a god of the jew but he's god also of the gentile he is god of all people now i know this is a simple lesson but if we have prejudice or if jonah had prejudice and he thought he was a jew god calls him to speak to people that are gentiles which you know the issue that jews had with gentiles they never gave them the time of day they were just godless people can you say man they just they didn't know and even that prejudice continued in the book of acts after they had the holy ghost peter still had prejudice towards the gentiles after he had the holy ghost i've preached this before and you can't believe that someone has the holy spirit and he's still got prejudice so what did god do same thing with jonah he said to peter i want you to go down to the house of cornelius to all those gentiles and i want you to preach the gospel to them because they're going to come in god has ways of putting us into situations we don't want to be in and it's part of us dying to our prejudice i believe brother brown if you put that quote up and leave it up for a minute i believe he's trying to teach us the same lesson that he told jonah and that is what's this jew got to do with us he had a fear of going to the gentiles because they're going to say i won't receive you get out of here jew so he didn't he had a hesitance to go do it and to be a faithful witness to the message and what god said sent him to do you see another here's another lesson it gives us a great thing to see that god not only is the god of the jew but he's god also of the gentile he is god of all people you know that this morning he's oh we can't possibly jonah had some pride that this is not for them this is not for everyone i don't think that we should ever think this message is exclusive now brother paul i thought that the this message is only sent for the elected people the bride yes i know that but i don't want you to have that attitude that's the truth but when but what happens is if we take that truth and we become proud in it then we start to be selective of who we're going to give the message to i mean raise your hand seeing this in the message oh god help us may it may it go out this morning may i proclaim it i don't have any fear of proclaiming it there's been imbalances around our ranks to take the truth of election and all of a sudden now that person serpentine and this person's elect and this is bride and we're bride listen let me tell you i'll go with what he said he's the god of all people and if somebody will receive him that's not up to you who receives it [Music] just because somebody rejects him completely doesn't mean he's still not their god they may serve other gods but he is the god of all human beings just most people won't acknowledge it and come to it a lot of you this morning have come to it praise the lord glad to be in fellowship with you amen so he's the god of all people and we can't everyone deserves a chance at truths and uh we have preached the elected so much the elect the elect the bride the bride the message is only for the elect that's true but you don't know who that elect is brother perry green who was a mentor of mine and brought many people to the message he used to have a little saying and he witnessed to everybody he could see on the planes everywhere he witnessed and brought so many people to this light and it's because he had a principle this message is for everyone and everyone deserves to hear it at least once so he talked and talked and talked and talked and talked see sometimes we hold back like jonah did because we think this is only for a selected people and i don't know if they could receive this there's a lot to this and then you look at them what they're wearing they're cussing like a sailor that woman she's no doubt she's been with all kinds of men and now we say wow you know this message is a lot it's going to overload her and right there we become selective and i think that we should grow up and stop doing that jonah did it and run from the presence of the lord and his responsibility to bring it because those gentiles will never receive me it's not up to you to decide that there's a god that's bigger than all this there's so much to it brother pawn i'm going to get off my notes here a minute because i just like to elaborate on this there's just so much to it you know there's the truths and you start the beginning and it it wasn't an apple that they ate back there but it was a sexual act oh my god that's a tough that's a tough sell and god's not a trinity but he's one god in three offices it's a tough oh when almost all of christianity believes there's three persons in the godhead and there's not there's one person you got that so you go through all the doctrines predestination and there's no eternal hell oh my goodness no eternal hell no there's an everlasting but there's an into hell someday you go throughout and then that's the restored truths that we're enjoying and then you start getting into god restoring the dignity of a woman and what a man is and what a woman is and how a woman should dress and how a man should dress and you got this and it's in complete contrary contradiction to the entire culture that we live in today so you that grew up in this you got all this you know and you're saying this is this is a tough sell well it isn't you that sells it say well i don't know how to talk about it just tell how your candle got lit tell what happened to your life just be real they ask you a question you don't know the answer say well i don't know the answer i can't do that yeah you can that one i don't know i'll get back with you on that one i'm sure enjoying serving the lord under the message of the last days we don't have a right to say this is too big for somebody this may be exactly what the person needs i know it's big because it's the i tell you it's the greatest revealing of christ that's ever hit planet earth that's big that's wonderful but i'd take it any day to just some partial truth of jesus christ if god gave me at all i'll take it all see you got all of something and you want to hoard over it and keep it back from people no give it to somebody else the word of god he said will destroy this place in 40 days and moving on with jonah now the word of god will destroy this place in 40 days now he says it all right he speaks the word of god thus saith the lord this this nineveh will be finished god told me to tell you this nineveh will be destroyed in 40 days thus saith the lord and then when he spoke that then out of the clear blue that's not what happens out of the clear blue they start repenting the king starts repenting i think god has surprises from some of you sometimes well i invited him and they came to church i can't believe it how many people have you invited to church you go to this church you believe this message but how many people have you invited to come here and why won't you i know some of you live a long ways away and getting somebody to drive three hours or two hours to church i know that's a but depending how hungry the person is we got people traveling a long ways to church friends even on wednesday nights you know what it is it sure ain't this buddy that's preaching it's a hunger for the lord it's a priority so when's the last time you invited someone and it's 40 days this place will be destroyed they started to repent they started to come around the king starts to repent the king orders an entire national repentance and maybe god will turn his fierceness away from us and and give us deliverance and so now we have something happen contrary now you just put yourself in jonah's shoes now he's been commissioned to say thus saith the lord thus saith the lord this place is finished in 40 days now i want to stop there because the prophet teaches us something here when it comes in the message warning then judgment and he says god gives a warning he gives every man a warning but sometimes there's a delay in the judgment coming based upon their repentance so it appears like sometimes that thus saith the lord was not the saith the lord but because god is merciful and god knows whether they'll repent or not god gives mercy and gives an extension of time to somebody who repents and guess what if god does that we shouldn't be hung up trying to figure out i thought that was thus they at the lord i thought it was supposed to be just this way i thought it was supposed to happen just this way we shouldn't get hung up on that because it's the grace of god in his timing that does something. so now you've got people saying oh i wasn't going to get into this but okay he said this he said that and he said that there was a bridge and a certain man fell from a bridge and he had a vision and we can't find enough articles to prove that and he said there was certain thousands of people in this meeting in south africa and there's no records that show that and we get hung up on how prophecies come to pass and some people have dumped the message out because of it but god is not interested in proving to us how it's supposed to happen our own way when he says something he means it can you say man and he'll fulfill it the way that he wants to fulfill it not the way you want to do it leaving the message over that and you got prophets in the bible were inspired to say something but it ended up coming out quite different than they expected if that happened with prophets in the bible then it can happen with the prophet today people get hung up okay this there's nothing to this thing i'm i'm leaving this thing my you know what you're doing you're living by your own will you've exercised your own will this thing better better tally up perfect with no flaws in it or i'm leaving it you go ahead and make that statement and see where you stand with god expecting perfection out of the man who's bringing the message but you wouldn't expect perfection that kind of perfection out of you am i allowed to say these things so in here we find some real lessons about people who just leave on a whim i didn't i don't understand why god said it that way and it didn't come to pass that way so i'm scrutinizing that and jonah responds so let's move on now so that's what happens out of the clear blue this whole country begins to repent that's not how the prophecy was supposed to happen that's not how thus saith the lord was supposed to happen jonah was you know if if an entire nation repented over a minor prophet like jonah coming in saying repent or perish it's like it's going to be over jonah should be shouting in his boots jonah should be rejoicing over what god has done the next chapter chapter 4 and that's why when i read it i'm going jonah what in the world are you doing what kind of an attitude is this where in the world and anger anger what in the world are you angry about and that's what i begin to ask what in the world is he angry about he's not supposed to be angry he's supposed to be happy he's supposed to be rejoicing and he's not because he's got inner anger to deal with maybe wednesday night i'll talk about anger in depth because what is one of the biggest issues is unresolved anger internally in somebody that you can say you're over it all you want to but if you're holding it it's faster see anger has a way to fester praise the lord glory be to god what a service today and rejoice in all the wow angers festering even from 30 years ago and paul tells us in ephesians to deal with our anger to not let the sun go down on our wrath we have a place to bring our anger and we have a healing balm from calvary that can heal all anger i'm not talking about the emotion and we we get we have the emotion of anger that's a part of us i'm talking about festering anger it just lays there and that's what jonah had and i don't know what all it comes from but it's such a surprise to have him respond this way to people repenting an entire nation repenting i can't believe i cannot believe that this response is from this minor prophet it's unbelievable that's why i begin to look at and say what in the world is going on with this man so now some of these reasons are unveiled in the message and when he begins to speak warning the judgment i already mentioned there are two message two messages to you that you can study this number one is running from the presence of the lord listen to that read it in 1965 and now the one i'm commenting now from is warning then judgment and this is in the message where he explains from isaiah 38 that isaiah told god told isaiah the prophet to go to hezekiah and say thus saith the lord set your house in order you're going to die thus saith the lord so isaiah obeys just like jonah did he goes he says to hezekiah i'm sorry to tell you this but thus saith the lord your days are numbered you're going to die real soon and you need to set your house in order because it's almost over okay now just to lay down some foundations here a little bit for the way he's going to look at this this next quote in god warning and judgment god warning a man before bringing him into his death not everyone has this we might say well we might say well this fellow died without a warning no no no god never you don't know what was in that man's heart you don't know what's being so you know what he's saying is that god never sends a man to judgment without first warning him and we may think man that guy never got a warning he he went on and he died and i know god always for every human being gives them a chance you see well i didn't see anything happen well god's not trying to make you see things happen he didn't come the way i thought he should come well that's up to god that's right now i'm not trying to put people in heaven you know there's nothing worse than preaching a funeral and and you know these preachers putting people in heaven and you know they didn't i don't know it's pretty rough i don't like being in those situations i just talk to the family and encourage them to serve the lord and do what i can i've been in those situations and it's rough but one thing that we don't want to do too is all of a sudden go the other thing and just say that person's burning in hell right now god gives everybody a chance and it's how they respond they may have turned it down but we don't know how god got to that person and we may say this fellow died without a warning no no no god never you don't know what was in that man's heart you don't know what's been going on in his life you see god never brings any man to his death without first warning him about it telling him it's something a preparation god is sovereign and he knocks at the heart of every man giving him the opportunity to come can you say praise the lord he knocks at the door of every man giving him the opportunity to come he might warn away and turn it down and shake his head and walk away and say oh it's just a funny feeling that's what that man say oh that's just a funny feeling and he walks away i'll get over it but anyhow it was god god speaking to him in a funny feeling they had and they turned it down but that was god speaking to him god always gives a man a chance so hezekiah does what nineveh does he goes to repenting before god said god i'm not ready i don't have my house in order and i need more time god forgive me i need more time and so god says to the same prophet go back and talk to hezekiah and tell him thus saith the lord i give you 15 more years because repentance our friends true repentance does a lot with god god is not the kind of god that is looking for ways to make things difficult for you in the sense of nope finish like some of us parents are to our kids sometimes we're just you know no you're done that's it i don't care how much you say i'm sorry you're done god is not looking for ways to say that he's looking for true repentance and he responds to it amen so hezekiah you know he's he's given 15 more years but put yourself in the prophet's shoes isaiah going down how does it make him look how does it make jeremiah look excuse me isaiah look when he says thus say the lord and come back and it appears like god has changed his mind you get 15 more years thus saith the lord the prophet goes on to say all right we find out the next quote he sends his prophets without warning excuse me he sends his prophets with warning he doesn't change his way his method of doing things he does not always strike when he warns i want you to watch this quotation god gives a warning but he don't always strike the same time he warns did you notice that and then when he doesn't strike when he sends a warning then the prophet is mocked you didn't have it you told a lie you wasn't right that's the same same thing might have been said to isaiah what do you think that that man thought when he went up there and prophesied the king was going to die then come back down and said he no he's going to live what about jonah going through the street saying oh this city is going to be destroyed within so many 40 days and then god didn't do it you see you have to watch god don't always strike when he warns are you learning but but he there's one thing then the prophet is mocked the prophet is mocked interesting our prophet is mocked and a lot of the reason is because they want to see things turn out the way they want to see them turn out so isaiah is mocked jonas thinks he's going to be mocked because this thus the lord is not turning out the way that i thought it was supposed to turn out the prophet is mocked but but if he is a vindicated prophet with the word of the lord see signs of god vindicated as god said the prophet would be vindicated which these men were see his word is not his but it's god's and it will come to pass it's got to come to pass if it's god's word there's only one thing can stop it that's a quick repentance praise the lord so not too much more i say about it but we have to approach the message the same way god's not trying to work it all out so it works out the way that we think it should work out and that's for years we take a quote and we think we're going to apply a quote to something apply be careful how you apply a quote something to a quote to something so quickly it may not be the right quote that applies be careful using it as ammunition so quickly god didn't extend his word to use ammunition against other people the ammunition is against the devil our weapon of the word is for the devil not your husband or your wife or your children or your person that did you bad this week the weapon of the word i got some quotes for him buddy i'm going to come down with some quotes i got a book of them here get ready partner i've got you the word was not intended to use for a weapon against other people but for the enemy and here this prophet is he could be embarrassed it doesn't say isaiah is but the prophet is mocked on the internet for the last three or four years especially four or five years the prophet of this age has been mocked and continues to be mocked just simply because people see that it hasn't come out the way they thought it was supposed to come out and he tells billy paul he says someday notice that sign in los angeles yes dad the may company he says you won't be an old man before there will be sharks swimming in this through that building the may building it's not just something he said to his son this is not on t so now people wait they look for all this to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen but there's been two or three times that los angeles has had flooding and floods the may building and they reported there was sharks swimming in the may building already so in our we're waiting for something to come but we don't know maybe it's already happened now that's just between us here you know don't go and make doctrines out of that just between us and the whole world on the internet but you understand another minister brought that out that's a great point and it's all about this god that hasn't left it up to us to figure all this out how it's supposed to happen it's up to us to believe it and he's either god's prophet for this hour or please somebody come and tell me who's the prophet for this hour because the bible says there's supposed to be one and if this one isn't it wasn't it please somebody tell me i'm desperate for my spiritual life i need to know who malachi 4 is but i don't have an identity crisis i know who malachi 4 wifi was and i know who i am i'm not struggling whether this is still struggling with us and if you're struggling just pray because you need to settle it in your heart the devil has all kinds of voices settle it this is truth this is the man god sent and now that man is gone and the truth that he restored i'm living in the glory of it can you say amen and i'm gonna be a witness to it i'm gonna live it i'm gonna testify of it i'm gonna believe it with all my heart i'm not a clone of the world can you say amen i'm an image of jesus christ in his word i'm a message believer of this last days and i'm unashamed to say that i am the greatest message that's ever come praise the lord so then uh he goes on to talk a little bit about jonah 12 30. i got plenty of time here praise the lord i'm doing good so the next question says why he commissioned isaiah to go tell him thus saith the lord then if there's a change in that or a lingering notice that word lingering okay it's going to happen anyhow he died just the same hezekiah died just saying but if there's anything in that then he's obligated to come back to the man that he sent thus saith the lord he told isaiah go back out there and tell him now jonah took a different attitude now what you just that that's why i titled my message jonah's anger and his attitude because ram says in this message he said jonah took a different attitude than isaiah isa isaiah just went with it i don't know why i'm going back over to hezekiah's house and saying you got 15 more years thus saith the lord but i'm not going to figure it out god is god but he said jonah took a different attitude he got mad he got angry see lord i told you did anybody have their bible open to chapter four verse one but it displeased jonah keep that quote up keep that quote up i need that but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee verse 2 of chapter 4 oh lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art gracious god and merciful soul to anger and the great kindness and repentance of the he actually said when he was commissioned to go back there he told the lord see god if i go down there they might repent and look see i told you they repented this guy has issues he's got a problem they all repented see lord i told you they would repent because you're a merciful god my goodness brother brahm says jonah had a different attitude than than isaiah because isaiah said you told me go down give him 15 more years i'm just i'm just a messenger i'm going to try to figure out thus saith the lord and what it meant all the intricate details i just know you're god and i know i'm the prophet i'm going to do what you said to do jonah didn't do that he took a different attitude and he says jonah took a different and gets up on the top of the hill and says well it'd be good if i was never born that's what he says in verse 3 verse 3 keep the quote up he says therefore now verse three got your bible oh lord take i beseech you my life from me take my life from me lord for it is better for me to die and don't have just just take me lord i don't want to face the ninevites i don't want to face you i look like an idiot i said they were going to be destroyed and they're repenting just take me lord i just want to die and brother brian says well it's jonah said it'd be good if i never was born and oh how he went on and god had a little gourd to come up and make him some shade until he got cooled off a bit cooled off up there so this is the rest of the story and uh if you want to hear it you have to come back next sunday we'll get into the gourd he cooled off a bit but he said now here i went down there and they're going to say i'm a false prophet jonah's saying god i went down they're going to say i'm a false prophet and god spoke to him and said look at that city down there lookie john look at that whole city is repenting with sackcloth and ashes and then he told him about the little gourd and the worm that cut it down one day the lord willing i want to come to the tabernacle and take a series just on jonah oh there's so many great things that east wind blowing and oh there's so many things in there it's thrilling them nuggets when i read that and i'd been studying this for six months when he said that praise the lord there's something in here i just don't know what it is yet but brother bram says there's nuggets in here that you can preach on for weeks i'm going lord in jonah what in the world can i preach out of that but if he said it then i'm studying it them nuggets are in there at all types for perfectly fit it even brings jesus christ in it and everything else of course every line in the bible brings jesus christ so i'm going on with the quote now i didn't have them put that up and i'll bring you into the quote here in a minute because there's so many quotes but listen to this and i will close on this final thing because brother brown gives a story here about his own life and it's very teaching for all of us in this jonah situation we'll end here i want you to ponder this and then we'll go on with jonah's life next sunday anybody get anything out of this today amen amen praise the lord i like those big amens that keeps me going through the week let me hear that again god bless sister abigail praise the lord he said i want to show you another jonah that's in the platform tonight one night there was a people that come in here and the lady maybe some of their people here tonight so i won't call the name but you would probably know who it is but they come in here a fine bunch of people from down in kentucky and they come here for years but the people being very fine people good friends of mine they were they were real good friends of mine but just one of those kind of people that when a revival was going on they could come to church and when the revival was off and the load was pulling nobody would pull and uh i'm just i would love to stop there and preach a whole sermon on that i think you should have your families in church especially in the times we're living in this a family is real close friends with them great people great people but he said they'd come and then they'd they wouldn't pull the load and they'd stop coming all the children was here on the crater roll and they when we had our classes and things and one day come to sunday school one day i come home about four years ago or five something like that and this young girl which was about eight years old when she was in the cradle role she had been married had two children and she was laying out in the hospital out there at the point of death and she was about four months five with a baby and the baby had died and they couldn't operate because she had anemic and they couldn't operate so had to let the mother die too can't operate and see the baby would kill her like that and she was just dying that's all wasn't no chance for her i went out to see her she had sent for me and i went to the hospital and there was a she was under an oxygen tent and i raised up the little flat and talked to her a little bit and i said you remember me she said sure brother brown i remember you i said how how is it do you understand how sick you are she said i do said that's why i sent for you brother branham i said well why how is it with you and the lord she said brother bill i'm not ready to go. and there we got down and prayed and her mother and her husband and many of them in the room and her mother and husband started crying and then i asked her and she got right with god paid her vows and come back and made god the promise and if she'd be forgiven how she loved him and sorry for her sins the way she had lived and went on with her repentance and crying and after a while i got up and went out of the building and the next morning they called me up to come back up there and to find out come to find out they come in the morning for a test and see how the anemia condition had uh advanced and found out she didn't have a speck of it left it was all gone every bit of that anemic poison had left her the doctors were so excited until they said my why is this we got it's something very strange see well we'll get her ready and said if it's still that way by the morning we'll keep giving her penicillin and whatever it was giving her and keeping the affections down we'll operate and take that take the dead baby before it set in something else see if she's all right well two or three times that day they tested it again and that night late she tested nothing was wrong perfectly all right and they prepped her took her out from under the oxygen tent everything was fine they was going to operate on her the next morning take the baby well i went out there and because this was done now i knew i never knew it i never knew the lord never told me nothing about it you could ask the people if you wish they said he never said it would but oh my to see such a thing her husband being a sinner come over and said brother branham i want to give my life to jesus christ remember these are people that come in and out of church raise their kids in sunday school but hadn't given their life to jesus christ brother bryan i want to give my life to jesus christ and i said all right just kneel down here and take hold of your wife's hand and then walk this straight life together mother come back she said brother branham you know here's me and my children we've all been in and out and around the tabernacle in and out of church we sat and listened that you preach and we go up to the altar and come back said i'm backslid too brother branham she said i want to come back to the lord jesus for his goodness to my child well you see that's very nice but you don't come to the lord jesus because of that along towards midnight 12 1 o'clock her mother dozed off to sleep and she said called and said mother daughter said mother she said yes honey what do you want she said you know i'm so happy she said i'm so glad of being happy said i'm at peace with god said oh how fine it is in a few minutes again she called back she said mother in a few minutes i'm going home and she said i know you are she said yes sweetheart the doctor will take the baby tomorrow and then after a day or two when your incisions heal up you get away from here and you go back home and be happy again you and your hubby and the little children and be a christian and live for god and she said mother i mean i'm going to my heavenly home she said sure honey at the end of the journey she said this is the end of the journey oh she said now what's the matter with you she said this is the end of the journey so said yes mother within a few minutes i'll be gone while she thought she had just got nervous and delirious she called the nurse the nurse taking her respiration everything was normal and within five minutes she was gone she was dead and then when i come back home in a week or two after that i think brother graham preached the girl's funeral and when i come back home and media told me that the girl died that night i couldn't i went to see the mother the next quote and i don't know what caused me to do it but i said lord god you owe me an understanding after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the lord after you've done these things for him and all like that and then take that girl's life like that i said you owe me and understanding when you tell god something like that he'll leave you sitting alone he don't owe me nothing i'm in debt to him can we learn the lesson this morning god doesn't owe us anything god doesn't owe us an explanation of what happens in our life there are a lot of things we will not ever know why they happened in our christian life until we get to the other side amen and the quicker you come to peace with that and go on with the lord the happier you'll be you start get demanding from god in your anger lord you owe me an explanation for this and if you don't show me then a few months from now i'm i'm i'm leaving you you start threatening like that you do it out of your anger it's anger it's what jonah had as we heard last sunday we got to quit functioning and making decisions based upon our anger and our emotions and start being led of the holy spirit when you tell god something like that he'll leave you sitting alone he don't owe me nothing i'm debt to him well he just let me pout it out for a few days you know and after about three or four months one day i was out on the creek bank and the lord spoke to me in a vision and said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek and a picnic on a picnic she should have went at that time but i had to take her when she was ready to go and that's why all this happened and why you went out there and then i got down and i cried and i said lord jesus forgive me your poor stupid servant i should have never said that lord we say things in our anger we say things because we want a certain thing to happen and those who are still micromanaging your life the outcome of everything in your children and everything you need to let go and let god have his way no matter how afraid you are you need to let the spirit lead sorry i i can't read those words already without breaking down i cried i said lord jesus forgive me your stupid servant i should have never said that it goes on to say and this is not with you guys up there and i had went back down to the lady she lived over there on market street and i went over to her and said i want to ask you a question she said sure brother bill i said is it true that this girl almost drowned and she said that's right brother branham her husband and they had her out in a creek and they had to use artificial respiration and put on pressure and they had to get a machine and pump the water out of her she had her skirt on and they was having a picnic she was out there and stepped in some sand slipped off over her head and strangled in the water they didn't notice her directly they seen her coming up and down and they run in and got her and brought her out and said she almost died and i said to mom that was her time to go but god in his mercy waited until the family got right his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts next quote says so god knows what he's doing next quote one that starts god knows what he's doing let me say that again can i get an amen back back to that one please back to the one before god knows what he's doing if you don't get anything else today grow up mature settle down and anchor in the truth that god knows what he's doing let him do it his way the lord probably would have told me that if i hadn't taken the attitude that i did lord you owe me to tell me about that he don't owe you nothing i stood in a meeting one night and heard an evangelist praying for a sick person said god i command you to heal this person who command god it isn't even intelligent because that god he does what he wants to can the clay say to the potter why did you make me thus see certainly not but if the prophet will keep still and then seek the lord for the answer there's the answer there i say amen keep still and seek the answer there's the answer i could word that that way seek sit still and seek the answer and that's the answer he may not give you all the details but there's the answer amen praise the lord i really i really love the lord this morning i trust that you love him amen i really love him and i i want to i want to grow i want to trust him more i don't trust a lot of people and you don't either and if i trust people i trust the god that's in them but i have a god that i can trust when everyone else fails i have a god i can trust and i want to be faithful to him no matter what outcome is happening and if i'm i i'm not against it all in faith believing that something for the impossible i'm not against that we should do that but don't predetermine the outcome the way it's going to happen if it lingers if you've been praying about something for 10 years you just keep praying that's right because it may linger but if it's of god it will come it will come i want to be a real christian i want to be a growing christian i want to be led by the spirit of god not my own mind not my own emotions i want them to heal the hurt that would be within me and the anger i was telling the young people friday night we had such a really nice time friday night at the house just such a holy spirit really came down and just just a precious time i just i was honest with the youth and i said you know what i was angry at a few people today and i had to bring it to the lord i just but i want to get to the place that i admit there's an emotion there of anger i can't deny it but i don't want to let it eat at me and what growing me out of it is just saying you know what i get the opportunity to spoke to speak to the next generation tonight so i'm going to forget all those people who've done me wrong and i'm looking to the new generation to teach them how to deal with their anger how to get married what good friendships are what bad friendships are i get the opportunity to influence the next generation and that's a wonderful thing it brings joy to my heart but i want them to see me always growing whether i'm 80 years old i want them to always see me if i do wrong to repent i make it right if i'm unfaithful i'm praying saying lord bring more faithfulness in me the children and the young people are watching us older ones our lives are priorities they're watching us we can't be like jonah and act alone self-focused it's all about jonah his anger his outcome how he looked through it all got to forget all that there's other eyes watching and i want to be a real christian this morning i trust that you do don't really know how to end this service except to stand quietly and keep it real quiet and just speak to the lord in to my heart into my heart come into my heart lord jesus come in today coming [Music] to stay come into my heart [Music] lord jesus my into my my heart lord jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] would you reach out to the one who's present with us this morning i know the word is corrective for all of us but just something about his correction that just has such overwhelming pulling power and grace and love i don't have any problem with taking it this morning he loves you his just asked you to reach out and say lord don't pass me by i know you love me while you're here not this real don't pass me by to and anybody understands what i'm going through except the lord so that's why i cling to you this morning because you understand what i'm going through you just reach out your hands say brother paul pray for me this morning when you pray i could find that subtle place got a lot of anger in my heart it's amazing young young people 18 19 years old and have so much anger already i just asked you to reach your hand towards me if you would i got a lot of anger towards people who've done me wrong maybe even message people just ask you to reach the only thing there's only one way to heal it that's through the lord's healing there's only one way to resolve it reach your hand towards beyond prayed for you this morning got to heal that anger [Music] precious jesus they reached out to you you reach out to them embrace them heal them break down all the walls and petitions and barriers anger resentment we talk about forgiveness lord but it really comes flows from your throne can't mechanically forgive somebody something that flows from calvary because you said those very words on the cross father forgive them they know not what they do that's why forgiveness flows from the cross let it flow into us this morning to heal that anger heal that hurt heal that pain do it lord do it lord come into that heart may their minds not get in the way and interrupt this moment we don't have to think everything through we don't have to figure everything out we don't have to have the answers for everything we just need to trust you then we do it lord so we commit these precious lives in your hands we trust in you lord jesus name i can trust you
