========================================

your scriptures this evening to matthew chapter 6. and then we'll go to psalms 118. this is a very familiar portion of scripture and i'd like for you to help me with it if you will and after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen psalms 118 and verse 22 the stone which the builders refused it's become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes [Music] whether you realize it or not this night was orchestrated by god this meeting was orchestrated by god this building was orchestrated by god this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it amen you can be seated this afternoon i'd like to just speak for a little while this afternoon on when god takes responsibility he is totally committed hallelujah when god takes responsibility he is totally committed john chapter 14 and verse 20 at that day ye shall know that i'm in the father and ye and me and i in you brother branham would speak christ the mystery of god revealed and the mystery was you and when you realize that you were the mystery that was in him you've already walked with him and you've already been inside of him now he wants to live inside of you more than a beautiful building but you're the tabernacle that he's interested in you see we're very familiar as message believers familiar with a silver tip grizzly bear familiar of an animal with 42-inch horns exact familiar of squirrels familiar of the boy in finland when people would write it down for two years before and then it would take place you know we all can enjoy those visions because we look at them backwards and we can see it's easy to look back decades ago and see that that happened exactly and it was totally accurate then we watched the prophet of god as he stands in the pulpit and he begins to deal with one patient after another and he would begin to tell them that that what their name was they knew that tell them their condition they knew that maybe even tell them that when they were on the operating table while that they were asleep there was a heavyset doctor with thick glasses and he's got he's he's he's got your organ in his hand and he's shaking his head and and he doesn't give you any hope now he wasn't reading their minds because they were totally asleep when that operation took place and then tell them that you've got something on your heart it's for your little girl or or for your mother at home and one right after another he was reminding them that it was more than a man that was standing at the pulpit now where the church world got off was they thought it was a gift they thought it was the read of a mind or or the gift of knowledge but it was the mighty angel himself it had never been on display since the days of jesus christ and up to that time it had never been on display until back when abraham and sarah was sent in an attempt but god thought so much of you he so wanted you to get the message maybe you didn't walk in a prayer line but god called your name he knew where you were at maybe you were in a bar room maybe you were in some dead church somewhere another and god came and found you where you were let me just say this to you god's not ashamed of where you were because he knows what he placed in you before the foundation of the world there is where that he placed the the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace on you before the foundation when you are in god's photo album so if i could bring you up to date you are in the vision it's not a man's vision to where that you can read into it and try to figure it out it's what caused so many people so many problems a few years ago they were trying to figure out the vision in a carnal realm you can't figure out god with a carnal mind amen but you're in the vision of god now you're in the vision of god god knew this day would come he knew this hour would come he knew the service would come he orchestrated it sometimes we feel as men and women that we think that we're making the choice how silly how silly it's god that's working it all out bringing it all together there's sometimes that we think well how can this possibly happen remember god is the great provider now if god could take 2 million people through a red sea then take them through the wilderness for 40 years and they never have to buy clothes imagine that they never have to worry about food they never have to worry about water it's mind-boggling the preparation that humanity would have had to make to get those people through that condition but god is a great provada [Applause] now you say brother ron you're standing there preaching with fourth stage cancer you know as long as the devil wants to be stubborn he's going to have to hear these sermons hallelujah [Applause] and if i didn't know better that devil just might get converted now let me just let me just background just for a bit john 14 and verse 1 jesus is standing there in his mortal flesh and he's speaking with the inner group of his disciples and he's talking about two worlds and he's talking about multiple dimensions and he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you in this evening hour brother branham would stand about four hours and speak on future homes and in future home if you if you've listened lately you remember brother branham talks about the people that have came into the city for the meetings and and he talks about the restaurant owners and the hotel owners and the people that run the stores and he says what a good people that you you have that comes to your meetings and what a wonderful group we just love to take care of them you see he was not just spending 45 minutes of time in preparation and you know admiring the people for their conduct he was actually talking about citizens from another kingdom and this is the way that they conduct themselves [Applause] you know if you want to know what's not in heaven just go read in in in revelations 21 where it tells the people that'll be left out murderers and adulterers and i dollar churchill gives a really nice list of what's not going to be there are you with me but i want to tell you what is going to be there i'm going to be there streets of gold walls of jasper that's incredible to hear gates of peril parks and avenues and the river of life running through every piece of property but what's really important is when you hear your name [Applause] it's okay for you to have your favorite preacher i know that's probably under the order but there you know everybody's got a likes and dislikes whether it's chocolate white chocolate coffee tea whatever you've got but let me let me just let me just share this with you god knows exactly what you like [Applause] and brother branham said he goes to prepare a city just to your liking well you say well brother ron that's that's that's not so big really then why do you paint your walls over and over again different colors get a couch get another one later buy a car a few months few years to get another car you you sometimes don't know what you like i'm taking you somewhere now especially if you're married if you're a bachelor all you needs a bowl and a spoon and a gallon of milk and a bowl of cereal but once you get married that changes you see in the garden of eden eve wanted things moved around it's like a man and a woman when they come to the wedding we really couldn't see the inside of that man until he chose a wife and you see she reflects the character that lays on the inside of that man and she's the lady the queen of the house listen just look around and you can see what god likes because you're a reflection of the inside of god his own very character so there was something about you that god liked brother jonathan now you see we are pre-planned by god we're built to overcome laodicea we're built to live in this age that has fallen apart it was a sermon decades ago a world falling apart but you're watching with your eyes like abraham watch the smoke rise there was a day where there was a conversation about if there's 50 there will you save it if there's 40 there will you save it if there's 20 there will you say that if there's 10 abraham was negotiating with god and the two angels went to sodom and what a condition that it was we live in a day where we're watching the the world fall apart governments education the economic system falling apart around us they don't have an answer even the other day when a vision was fulfilled and there stood uh a woman in a purple dress even our critic said it was blue it's the same spirit that moses had to face they can't look at a vision for itself when it fulfills and it's just so plain god didn't need ten thousand angels standing on the the podium of the stage to fulfill a vision the vision happens it's over with and it's a sign for us it's just a sign that we're getting closer today in your fox news you you you could you could read the article of word that the government now says that they have videos of ufos taking place that's nothing new for us and they said that they have a super intelligence much more than what we've got i'd say they do they have an agenda and we are the agenda [Applause] now god's not going to have just a group of people that are that are going to just live in this age but we're going to overcome this age this age is not going to be an age to where that we're going to be escape free from problems or situations but god has equipped us with the greatest weapon that we could possibly have and not only equipped us with his word that is filled with every precious promise but it is our open book now to to read it and to take it in well brother ron that's just another statement well just think about all the schools that have been built throughout the ages to try to figure out this book i might as well scald the devil's height he gives me a hard time and he don't need me letting up on him they built tremendous schools of theology and literally maybe millions of preachers has come out of there that never could open this book but in our generation god himself came down even when the prophet said that was against this better judgment or he thought that this is the way tomorrow night would be that god came in the room who better to explain the book than the one that wrote the book and you are god's crowning achievement in this day your bone of this bone your life of his life your spirit of his spirit [Applause] brother branham would explain how the mechanics and the dynamics now don't try to go figure that out by some scientific fear listen god knows exactly the formula amen go through all kinds of steps to get born again just meet jesus just me jesus it's not so great you don't have to read 52 books just meet jesus [Applause] and welcome jesus to your home let your home be filled with jesus [Music] you don't have to go through every kind of rehab in the world you don't have to go through every kind of psychologist to figure you out jesus knew how to fix the woman at 12. in just a little bit of a conversation she went and told the city come see a man who told me everything she never went back to that lifestyle again you say well brother ron there's no hope for me there was no hope for lashes but jesus pre-planned the meeting as a matter of fact jesus went out of his way [Applause] in god's orchestration he couldn't go pray for him until he was dead so i'm not giving up i don't care what the report is i got another report i've got another physician now let me just say this to you and we're not looking for some great revival to come it's happening [Music] obviously this mic's not working we're not looking for some great revival to come it's happening it's not just happening here it's happening all over the world because who is among us the mighty angel himself we're not looking for some great preacher some superhuman being to come on the scene the mighty angel is healed but the man said you're not feeding on the mind of a man are you with me neither should we feed today on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man that's where our diet is jesus should say blessed are your eyes for you see blessed are your ears for you here and you realize being one in a million your neighbor don't see it your parents don't understand it but your ears are open we live in a very heavily offended age where everybody's offended everybody's got a blog everybody's got an opinion but jesus said blessed are ye which are not offended [Applause] and he would turn and say except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me [Music] hallelujah now brother branham would speak a sermon on recognizing your day and its message it's still an important sermon i would say it's an important service for tonight and he he went back and he talked about a group of people that had the hurdle of his coming said they're good people and they're constantly saying fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray and and he later says the reason they do that is because they've not recognized the awakening of the bride and i'm afraid there's still too many today that that quote still appears to they're looking for something to come that is already happening are you with me i'm not trying to work you up into something listen this should cause a greater excitement than ohio state football or michigan football this is not some carnal something that'll fill you for a day or two you know so many times when you were in the world you went you had great expectation for something to be so exciting and then it was a letdown i've never been in a search i've never been in a place where i was under expectation for god to come that he didn't meet my expectation now understand this that god has taken responsibility for you he's taken responsibility for you so that means that he has watched over you since the foundation of the world are you with me now i want to remind you of some things that you already know god wanted you to be red-headed brown-headed whatever hair you've got he wanted you to be so tall come on so heavy [Music] he wanted you to be the way that you are and even with certain strings in your life and certain complexes and he wanted you to be born on a certain day at a certain hour at a certain minute to be under the constellation of the sky are you with me and he knew that you would be alienated from god because you have to come from the sexual birth so god has to watch over you all the way back from the days of adam and he had this one to marry this one and this one to marry this one and this one to marry this one all in the same time he has to watch over your parents as they went through wars and plagues and coveted in every kind of situation he had to watch over every situation moving from one nation to another nation moving here moving down brother ron god don't do that don't tell me when he was to be born on the earth he caused taxation and he forced joseph to go back to his birthplace [Music] god knows how to move an entire nation for you whether you know it or not my god's a great big god he's so much bigger than you make him it's you that limits god it's not god that limits he feels all time space and eternity he said let there be and he spoke to that which was not and it became a consolation of stars [Applause] and he said it is good he even complemented his own work it is good [Applause] and whether you know it or not when he looks at you in all of his vision all the way since the photo album and now you're sitting here on this night blue suit black suit whatever dress that you've got on he said it is good sometimes you ask the question why does god let me go through difficulty brandon preached this message for decades with a condition in his body and seeing some of the most phenomenal miracles that has happened since jesus and yet fought with his own humanity god was bigger than brother branham's problems god was bigger than brother brown's mistakes i know that's almost blasphemy in some places but aren't you thankful that he's bigger than your mistakes aren't you really thankful that god has mercy allocated in his great provision he had it allocated i'll take care of their mistakes some of you were the woman at the well some of you were naked on a boat cursing hopefully not but some of you but some of you were some real doozies i never get really i get amazed sometimes after people been a christian for 20 30 years they they get amnesia and they forget about grace the grace that brought them in will take the same grace to take care of their children the blood that paid the price of redemption for them it'll take the same blood this is more than just handing your children a books or go play a tape and you'll get it it's going to take the same acts 2 experience that it did for you may this church be a place where people can weep their way to calvary and truly repent of their sins and be filled with the holy ghost you can't live this without god listen we don't want to have service without god we don't have a singing without god i don't want to set an appeal without god [Applause] well brother ronnie if you would just kind of preach and not raise your voice or scream at us it's because you're an unconverted baptist sentinel in the message [Applause] and what you really need is a pillar of fire are you with me brother brown said the modern church don't wanted them acts 238 speaking youngins around them whooping and crying and screaming said the modern church won't have it you think that's going to stay out there and the baptist church are going to come right in amongst you where you can't raise your hands where you can't praise the lord where you've just got a religious demon bigger than a bullfrog don't sit on me i'm not the kind of preacher you want to sit on [Applause] but god has provided a birth for you [Applause] where he can take your drug addict kids and turn them around in a moment's notice [Applause] you don't need a seminar on how to overcome pornography just get saved just get a baptism of the holy ghost and truly repent of your sins and never go back never go bad brother man said if mary had to go to the upper room so will you but too many times the devil offers us sitting on these pews without a birth he don't mind you walking in this building and being part of the attendance and crossing your arms and sitting there he don't mind you coming here because he needs a ride but what he does mind is when you get a part of god inside of you and it becomes reality and it's more than things that are to be and god's provided way of worship now you're that place that god has chose to live inside of brother walked to the pulpit there was many times that he was speaking before audience that had no clue what he was talking about and he speaks a subject of things that are to be and it's more than a sermon it's more than a vision and it's more than a prophecy this is not what might be this is what will be there he begins to explain that you are in the pre-planning of god you never was just a thought or some myth you were in the infinite god's mind before the foundational world before he ever created this celestial globe you will stand now if you was there then he explains eternal life to have eternal life you had to be in his mind then to be where you are now you didn't bring yourself to church god brooded over you and brought you you wasn't looking for god god came looking for you then brother branham will come down just a few just a few sentences in that and he said there's nothing out of cater and then he begins to say even this night was pre-planned my god now think about that that's bigger than sometimes we even well brother paul was thinking about a meeting no when george washington was fighting in the delaware god had this night on his mind when charles finney was preaching he had this night on his mind when jonathan golfer was overseas and he was doing missionary work he had this might on his mind when peter cartwright was inside of a building and and brother dan goes back in the greatest battle ever fought and he picks him up out of all the stories of history brother man picks up peter cartwright and he said he he went to a town and he he began to clean out the building and wash the women's and the you know the bully of the town came in and he was the sheriff of the mayor or whatever he was and he came in and said you can't have a meeting here until you get permission from me and you'll have to whip me first god had somebody there that would climb down off of the ladder [Applause] he needed a church to be there and he needed a pastor and he needed a people so he had a preacher to climb up there and clean the windows and get it ready and when it came time for the pastor to walk in and be a bully he simply took his coat off and said well that's the next thing i'll do then how would you like that to be your preacher well this church was started on a fight i got converted in the service that night after peter cartwright preached i got converted he whipped me then i came back to church and i met god i'd like for you all to meet the same god that i met oh brother ron all those things are by chance really [Music] a man who's himself a a sepulcher because he has the ability and the provisions to do it and he works diligently in the hardest rock in the world to dig himself out a grave one day i'll lay him not knowing that jesus was going to need one only for three days it was more than coincidence i can hear him tell his wife she said you worked so hard you did so much work to try to build that for yourself and now you're gonna let this prophet some call it the messiah you're gonna let him lay there i can hear his answer he's not gonna lead it but for three days i find it that jesus is very detailed in his planning jarius comes makes his journey and on the way home they tell him his daughter's dead and jesus is operating in two worlds fear not did i tell you fear or not and it reminds him of who he is then he goes there and he gets all of the mourners to leave gets all the unbelief out of the room and then he speaks to her and she comes to life and then jesus tells him feed her she needs to eat you see he was mindful of you so he provided you a ministry where you could come on whatever your services are and eat because he knows that you need to eat to overcome laodicea you're not going to do it on your own you're not going to do it on your own energies so you need to eat so he will begin to deal with the pastor or the minister of the evangelist and maybe just in just a couple of words they'll be nervous for two or three weeks getting a subject together all different kind of things walk to the pulpit and it don't go nothing like they thought it would because you were here to eat and it's your need that gets god's attention are you with me listen jesus knows there's coming a woman that's going to touch the hem of his garment he don't know who it will be but he knows that as he walks somebody's going to touch it but he's got to wait on her to do it on the way brian bartimaeus cries out no way he could possibly hear but god knows your need he's a great provider understand something about god god is infinite and god has never been in a crisis he has the answer and he's always on time you don't have to prove god god will prove himself [Music] understand no doubt you have confidence in god but god's got confidence in his seed job is not the only one that god's had a testimony service about no doubt you've been sent through the ringer in your life and satan was trying to wreck your plans and wreck your marriage and wreck your life and god knew the seed that he planted and deposited in you would hold he don't have to send reinforcements to that seed that seed will hold no doubt as this building was being searched out god knew exactly where it was at no doubt it had a lot of other tenants that did all the a lot of the hard work to make this this place happen no doubt he grinned as they were preparing it you know kind of like he watched you when you were drunk and you said i'll never go to church and then he comes to your will hallelujah brother kelly he knows how to walk to a well he's not ashamed of where you're at what your past is what your he's not ashamed of you he's not ashamed of where you're at he's not ashamed of how scarred that you are in your life maybe you wouldn't want the woman that had five husbands to sit under your pew but once she meets jesus she's harmless maybe you don't want the biggest drug addict in the city to be here but once he meets jesus he's harmless [Applause] he knows how to clean fish so many times we preach the laws of do's and don'ts and it just becomes a legislation we're conforming people to it this is the way we do it this is the way we do it this is the way we do it and then later down the road they get tired of the way we do it but if they ever meet jesus and the life of god is poured inside of them there's no argument about a closet there's no argument about media there's no argument about the what god wants in your life you have a desire to please him [Applause] jesus said these words are in book of revelations 21 forgive me he said i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea future event but it's going to happen what's going to happen with this world it's getting ready to get a transformation just like you got [Music] the birthing process is on for this world are you with me now there's a groaning in the earth that is taking place in in israel there's a groaning that's taken place they have been gathered they are a tremendous nation one of the most powerful nations in the entire world yet they're itty-bitty but because god has pre-planned it there's not an army in the world that can destroy them because you were pre-planned now i'm getting ready to preach to you i've laid my foundation let me preach because you were pre-planned there's not an army of devils in the entire world that can destroy you you may not agree with this but i'm going to say it i believe that satan sent his best cancer devil that he could to attack my body but i also believe that god sent his best i thought last night's sermon was so tremendous and timely here we are at the end of the end of the end and the people of god are being moved into another channel because we've got to have faith more than just to cure cancer we've got to have faith that this mortal becomes immortal in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this flesh gets changed because this is a rapture message and god will leave nothing undone god's not just gonna bring us out this far to leave us his angel is among us to see this message through and every detail and every promise hallelujah it's not here for rapture it's going to happen it's not if a resurrection there's going to come a resurrection [Applause] satan tries to corrupt you he tries to corrupt you and send every avenue to try to corrupt your life but i got a statement for him when jesus was laying in the grave 2000 years ago god would not let corruption enter his body then and i was in there then he couldn't corrupt me 2 000 years ago he don't have enough weapons to corrupt me now [Applause] the message is not if i overcome i'm going to overcome it because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world it is not up for debate and it's not up for negotiation it is not up for challenge [Applause] god will prove his word there will be a bribe there will be a people [Music] [Applause] i've heard this for decades no doubt the people in noah's day thought they'd heard it for decades but one day there came a flood and god proved his word god will prove his word in this day you'll see your mom and daddy come down your your sidewalk he's coming he's not going to be old he's coming he's going to be a young man hallelujah and this message will be more than a book it'll be more than a promise it'll be a reality i want to remind you when brother john last year took his last breath his first breath was in heaven and he was not old because jesus said i go to prepare brother braham said it wasn't houses of stone and brick and mortar your body [Applause] my mama's not a gray-headed woman today your loved ones are not sitting in a wheelchair no more they're waiting on another dimension and they know this message is right cause the moment that your father went to that realm everything that he preached was in front of him praise the lord one day i was in my office on december the 22nd and the spirit of the lord spoke to me and said if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before i did not realize that in a few days while i was at brother bischo's preaching three sermons one was encouragement one was naaman was a leper and the third was take it back it wasn't until the last service just before walking to the last service we get a call you have cancer in your lung and i thought how fitting brother mitchell from my area had cancer in his lung and brother bristol interviewed brother mitchell it was at a a tv station where they did political uh advertisements political stories and it would take half a day to do a politician and when brother biscuit and brother mitchell goes there charlie i would grew up at charlie as a preacher and and they go and they sat down and in less than an hour they're done and so the producer said how could you do that and he said well we tell the [Applause] truth as i look back at the year before god gave me sermons like encouragement take it back where david was stripped of all of his possessions the enemy came in and attacked and the enemy would come in and attack me we we were preaching at that convention together and the enemy would attack me and give me a death sentence brother roy shrewsbury called me and is this okay brother royce roosevelt called me about two months into the journey and he said brother ron he said god spoke to me last night to give you these words he said you're like daniel going into the mouth of the lion's den where no man has ever survived and he said but daniel told the king i'll see you in the morning the first doctor that saw me without any stands without any x-rays without anything he said you have cancer and i said how do you know that he said you're a preacher you can see certain things and he said i can see cancer on you before i left the office he he told me these words he said ron i want to tell you something this will be the greatest documented miracle of modern time hallelujah so i'm not afraid and i'm not asking for pity and i don't want you to feel sorry for me because we're going to win so now i've told you a piece of my testimony now i want to give you some encouragement for yours these words stuck out to me i've been sick before but i made it i've been broke before but i made it i've been brokenhearted before but i made it i've been betrayed but i made it i've been lied on but i made it i've been destitute i i've been rejected but i made it i need a scripture good behold i have created the the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work i have created the waste to destroy in god's great provisions he creates his own enemy amen but he also created you to be an overcomer [Applause] when he was molded and fashioned in you and your attributes he did not fashion backslider running back afraid he created you as an overcomer of this age and the scripture says that no weapon no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper now you see this is not my first rodeo i was laying non-responsive and the doctors had given me up i'd been in a coma almost a month and one day sister connie was called by brother biskell and brother bischo was told by god they had bought mount baker bibleway camp and i was laying in that condition follow me i was laying in that condition and god speaks to brother ed that i'll be the speaker next year let me just say this you this ain't about me tonight this is about you god has saw you through your problems are you with me he's called you by name your name might be bethany your name might be wayne he has saw you through your trial your problem is not too big for god it may be too big for you to handle but it's not too big for god to handle [Applause] i'm getting close to an end god knew he was going to have lunch with lazarus all the mourners did not matter his sister's doubting did not matter he knew tomorrow we're going to have lunch together they're actually going to threaten to kill him tomorrow i'm going to have lunch together [Applause] we're going to need a place to have the last supper so i want a couple of you disciples to follow a man and he's going to have a he's going to have a picture in his hand you follow that man that's got that pitcher of water in his hands and he's going to walk down to a certain room by the way i'm going to need to ride off of the mountain today and so you need to go over there's a man over there that's got the cult the fall of an ass just tell him the master has need of it it's never been road to ever before it's not in his nature to let no man on it but don't you just wear it the bible said the bible said i was going to right off of this mountain on the cult of a following ice today we're going to fulfill it when they told them they were going to beat him like no other man has ever been beaten he had you in his mind whether it was cancer tuberculosis high blood pressure depressed in every situation of your life he was making provision isaiah 53 had to be fulfilled he walked into this service with problems he knows i have financial debt brother ron he knows yeah i have a situation in my life i have a situation in my marriage he knows brother ron if i could only get to you in counsel with you for a few hours it would fix it just counsel with god most time people go to preachers because they really ain't prayed over it anyway and they don't want the fix that the preacher gives them what you really need is an old-fashioned backwoods hot skinning pentecostal prayer meeting the scripture says in first john chapter 4 year of god little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world last night we heard about david david did not look for a cemetery to bury him he was not thinking about how bad the death's going to be he was not even measuring how big goliath was the lie told him don't you worry about telling how big your devil is he'll tell you how big he is he's nothing but a bluff to start off with just start picking up promises of stones and don't even worry about your ability to turn it loose it will find its targeted place [Applause] don't pick it up brother well i've had it it was two weeks of misery but he lost isn't the devil stupid just it'd be stupid he knows you're going to whip him yet he keeps coming back brother branham said he he heard him get in the car with him he was going to take a trip in arizona going to cheer to church take a trip he said he got him and shut the door he said you're going to ride with me i'm going to sing to you he said i sung to him all the way so if the devil's gonna ride you give him a real ride romans 8 says who shall separate us from the love of christ it's tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness a peril of sort god's got it all in his preparation he knows you're going to have to go through some of these things but as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're counted as sheep and for a slaughter nailing all these things now and all these things why don't you say it it wasn't whatever's going on in your life nay and all these things i can hear the devil saying man we showed up at the wrong meeting this weekend we started getting killed the first night and this guy ain't letting up none neither we are more than conquer us [Applause] through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities no powers nor things to come nor things or things nor things present or things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us there's not even a thought about going back think about that's the kind of people that you are all that he puts on you and there's not a thought about going back i know where i stand i know what i'm doing and i'm settled should god heal me i'm going to preach till the day i die should i go by the way of the grave i'm going to preach to the way that i die and if i die hell will self will celebrate

satan's thrilled that i'm coming to an end to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame so he's reminding you when i was here and i had you in me i okay it's a little bit reversed right now you're here and i'm in you [Applause] now it's not your flesh it's gonna overcome but he that is in you is the one that accepts the challenge because what god deposited god's got confidence in it so when god says i am committed to the end he won't take you halfway and then lead you he won't desert you in your journey he is committed brother ron but why did we have to have such a big building there's a lot of seed that's still got to come in and the table's going to be full and something's going to be lame and something's going to be halt and something's going to be blind they're not qualified to sit at the table but god's going to make them qualified let me finish now some are going to be drug addicts and prostitutes and bad people but god knows how to clean them up he's got a ministry here that's ready he has prepared this place this is a prepared place for prepared people this is the day that the lord has made we will rickshaws [Music] hallelujah this
