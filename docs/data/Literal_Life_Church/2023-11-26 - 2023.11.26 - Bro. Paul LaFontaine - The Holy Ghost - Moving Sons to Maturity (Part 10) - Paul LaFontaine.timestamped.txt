[34:08] has kept us alive all these years Caleb
[34:12] said he has kept me alive all these
[34:14] years and God has certainly kept us
[34:16] alive and still believing with all of
[34:18] our hearts if you would turn with me
[34:20] this morning to Ephesians chapter 4
[34:22] we're going to read some verses of
[34:24] scripture together and once again we
[34:26] welcome all of our visitors today those
[34:29] from out of town those who are in for
[34:30] the holidays and uh we appreciate you
[34:32] joining in with us may the Lord bless
[34:34] the word anoint our words with the
[34:37] anointing of the holy spirit that we can
[34:40] all be fed this morning from the word of
[34:42] God Ephesians chapter 4 and verse
[34:47] 13 Ephesians 4 and13 till we all come in
[34:52] the unity of the faith and of the
[34:54] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[34:58] perfect man unto the measure of the
[35:01] stature of the fullness of Christ when
[35:04] it says until we come into the unity or
[35:07] till we come it means until that means
[35:09] that we still have something out in
[35:11] front of us that the Holy Ghost is
[35:13] taking us to so how many know that the
[35:16] Holy Ghost is a growth into something
[35:19] it's not a a one night deal but it's
[35:21] something he's taking us to and here it
[35:23] echoes that in the scripture as it does
[35:25] in many places we were read today that
[35:28] the scripture takes of the Holy talks of
[35:30] the Holy Ghost taking us somewhere and
[35:31] this is about Unity till we all come in
[35:33] the unity of the faith of the knowledge
[35:35] of the Son of God unto a perfect man and
[35:38] perfect in the scripture does not mean
[35:40] Flawless perfection in the flesh it
[35:42] means growth to maturity so that's what
[35:46] I want to speak on as well unto the
[35:47] measure of the stature of the fullness
[35:49] of Christ that we henceforth be no more
[35:53] children tossed to and fro and carried
[35:56] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[36:00] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[36:02] whereby they lie and wait to deceive so
[36:06] now this is we this is Paul saying we're
[36:09] growing towards the unity but one thing
[36:11] that we have to do is be not be children
[36:14] who have a distinction of being tossed
[36:16] to and fro by every wind of Doctrine and
[36:19] the only way that you're not tossed that
[36:20] way is that you know where you stand you
[36:23] know where your stance is in the word
[36:25] and you are standing solid in that as a
[36:27] mature Christian that you're not tossed
[36:29] about believing one thing one day and
[36:31] the next day believing something else
[36:33] that's a child spiritually and we're to
[36:36] mature out of that being tossed about by
[36:39] every wind of Doctrine we're not driven
[36:41] by the winds but we're driven by the
[36:43] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost holds us
[36:47] stable to for all the Winds of doctrine
[36:50] that come
[36:52] through but speaking the truth and love
[36:54] may grow up into him him in all things
[36:58] which the which is the head even Christ
[37:01] verse 15 again speaking the truth in
[37:04] love we may grow up into him how many
[37:08] want to grow
[37:09] up into him in all things we are to grow
[37:14] up in all things not just Doctrine but
[37:19] in all things we are to mature and grow
[37:23] up and be mature Sons and Daughters of
[37:26] God I love that and we do it by speaking
[37:28] the truth in love we speak the truth we
[37:32] grow up into him in all things which is
[37:34] the head even Christ Heavenly Father we
[37:36] ask you to bless and uh just cleanse our
[37:39] lips this morning that we would say
[37:42] those things that are needful for the
[37:44] people Lord that you would remove any
[37:46] hindrance in the service today that your
[37:49] spirit would have preeminence today and
[37:51] Lord we've already given our hearts in
[37:54] worship Lord as we felt your presence
[37:56] here we pray Lord that you will deliver
[37:58] us and help us and strengthen us in your
[38:00] word and we ask it in Jesus name amen I
[38:04] bless you can have your
[38:07] seats I'm just picking up another
[38:10] section on the series on the Holy Ghost
[38:12] and I want to title this the holy ghost
[38:15] moving Sons to maturity and we touched
[38:18] on it a little bit a few weeks ago when
[38:20] we talked about uh the the word of
[38:23] adoption that comes out of Romans
[38:25] chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 Paul called
[38:29] the Holy Spirit the spirit of adoption
[38:32] that's the first time it was mentioned
[38:34] that way that we receive the spirit of
[38:37] adoption whereby we cry ABA father so he
[38:41] is the first one that called it called
[38:43] the Holy Ghost the spirit of adoption
[38:45] that is not referred to in the book of
[38:48] Acts at all the Holy Ghost is not
[38:49] referred to as the the it's the spirit
[38:52] of adoption and uh we realize that's for
[38:55] a reason because and it's only mentioned
[38:57] five times in the Bible Paul mentions it
[39:00] and it's because that Paul he has a
[39:02] truth behind what he's in introducing
[39:05] and that truth is that that this Holy
[39:08] Ghost will not just bring you a new
[39:11] birth will not just bring a change of
[39:13] your nature in your soul will not just
[39:16] make you a new creature in Christ Jesus
[39:20] but this same Holy Ghost will lead us
[39:23] and guide us
[39:25] somewhere ultimately to a Rapture how
[39:29] many's interested in that so he's he's
[39:33] going to begin using the word adoption
[39:35] because adoption has the connotation
[39:37] it's not your birth adoption has to be
[39:39] growing into something growth into
[39:42] something coming to uh uh something else
[39:44] in other words he's saying that the same
[39:46] holy ghost that birthed you the same
[39:48] holy ghost that changed your nature the
[39:50] same holy ghost that gave you a new
[39:52] birth is the same holy ghost that will
[39:55] lead us and guide us somewhere we are
[39:58] growing into something can you say amen
[40:02] and in Romans 8 Paul expresses it later
[40:04] on in the scriptures where he says under
[40:06] this teaching uh under this teaching of
[40:09] the Holy Ghost we're waiting on
[40:10] something two things he says we're
[40:12] waiting on he said all creation and we
[40:14] ourselves are waiting on the
[40:16] manifestation of the sons of God and
[40:20] then he says we're waiting for our
[40:21] adoption to ITT the change of our bodies
[40:24] our new bodies so this holy ghost that
[40:26] we received at an altar or in your home
[40:29] wherever you receive this Holy Ghost
[40:31] it's taking us somewhere and we're still
[40:34] waiting on
[40:36] something so because he words it that
[40:38] way adoption has the connotation this
[40:40] Holy Ghost is not just a one-time deal
[40:43] at an altar but it's actually growing us
[40:46] and taking us into something and and
[40:48] that is the manifestation of the sons of
[40:51] God and then the Redemption of these
[40:53] bodies it is only the holy ghost that
[40:56] takes you to the manifestation of the
[40:58] sons of God it is only the holy ghost
[41:00] that brings you into full mature son and
[41:03] daughter of God and it is only the holy
[41:05] ghost that takes you to the
[41:08] Rapture there's no other way into a
[41:10] Rapture except by the Holy Ghost but do
[41:12] you get my simple thought this morning
[41:14] it's taking us somewhere it's growing us
[41:16] into something can you say amen and so
[41:19] if we are all done at the altar when we
[41:21] receive his Spirit then why is Paul
[41:24] teaching that we're still waiting on
[41:26] something because this Holy Ghost is
[41:29] taking us somewhere it is a
[41:35] journey so if you don't have it this
[41:37] morning seek God with all your heart and
[41:40] get in this journey with
[41:42] us it's the Journey of the Holy Ghost
[41:45] and it's taking us somewhere and even
[41:48] though in God's eyes we are a finished
[41:51] work uh my son Gideon preached a couple
[41:54] weeks ago on uh it is finished and when
[41:57] when when Christ said that at Calvary as
[42:00] far as the sacrifice being paid and as
[42:03] far as the completion of what will
[42:04] become in God's eyes we're a finished
[42:07] work because Calvary did a finished work
[42:10] so any born again Christian who comes
[42:12] along then in God's eyes it's already
[42:14] finished because he's paid the price
[42:16] he's paid the price all the way from
[42:18] your beginning all the way to the
[42:19] Rapture all the way to the Millennium it
[42:21] is finished can you say man so that
[42:24] truth is there we we rest in the the
[42:26] finished work of Calvary we should rest
[42:28] in that the price has been paid can you
[42:30] say Amen the power to complete us is in
[42:34] us right I said the power to complete us
[42:39] is already in us because we receive the
[42:43] spirit of
[42:45] adoption amen and so now uh in Christ I
[42:49] am complete how many you raise your hand
[42:50] and say in Christ if I'm in Christ by
[42:52] the Holy Ghost I'm already complete in
[42:54] God's eyes amen already Justified
[42:57] already Sanctified already Justified
[43:00] already seating as far as positioning in
[43:02] my soul already seating with Christ in
[43:04] Heavenly places the believer's position
[43:06] in Christ we know that but you see now
[43:08] because we're in a human experience
[43:11] because and I want to get into this next
[43:12] Sunday I didn't have time last night it
[43:14] all opened up and I won't have time to
[43:16] get into it today but but there's a
[43:18] truth in in in the mystery of MDC of our
[43:22] theophanies and that is this is the
[43:24] truth is that we entered we we bypassed
[43:27] our theophany our word body and we came
[43:30] to this life in this Human Experience to
[43:33] be tempted can you say Amen because we
[43:36] bypassed because of sin in the garden we
[43:38] bypassed the normal way and we came to
[43:41] our human bodies before we went to our
[43:44] word body say where in the world are you
[43:45] getting that preacher maybe you're
[43:47] asking on the internet on the broadcast
[43:49] where are you getting that I'm getting
[43:50] it from the Bible if this Earthly
[43:52] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[43:54] waiting in the heavens Eternal in the
[43:57] heavens we have an eternal
[44:11] theophonic Sunday's
[44:14] message I can't get away from it it's
[44:16] I'm fired up about it because we came
[44:20] the wrong way then our kinsman redeemer
[44:23] has to step down into the human
[44:25] experiences as well now he didn't bypass
[44:28] his theophany Christ he came from the
[44:31] very mind of God to theophany body and
[44:34] then to an Earthly body but because he
[44:36] had an Earthly body he had to experience
[44:40] this human Journey not by Eternal he was
[44:43] already done he had to grow into mature
[44:48] into the the the the the uh the the uh
[44:52] manifestation that God wanted to be and
[44:54] so now he had had to grow say where you
[44:56] get the scriptures for that he learned
[44:58] obedience by the things he
[45:02] suffered he he lived out all the agees
[45:05] we do he was born a
[45:07] baby now if he was the offen he wouldn't
[45:09] have to be born a baby he's a full
[45:11] matured body he'd come that way but
[45:13] because he had to come in the human
[45:14] expence he had to go through baby
[45:15] teenage years uh adolescent years he go
[45:18] you know he went through all the stages
[45:20] that we go through because he had to
[45:23] experience that can you say Amen so now
[45:26] it's it's he had to come through that so
[45:28] now when we come into these bodies by
[45:31] the Holy Ghost we hold all the
[45:34] potentials within us to come to complete
[45:37] adoption can you say Amen but we have to
[45:40] go through those stages of growing we're
[45:43] already Justified before God's eyes it's
[45:46] already a finished work but we have to
[45:48] live out maturing in God's
[45:53] grace because guess what you're your
[45:55] Soul's born again but your body's
[45:58] not your mind is not I wish my mind was
[46:01] born
[46:02] again that I wouldn't have all these
[46:04] thoughts and things and let my mind get
[46:06] off track you see my mind's not born
[46:08] again but the growth of a Christian is
[46:10] that he brings this body under
[46:13] subjection to the Holy
[46:15] Ghost that's why we're here did you know
[46:18] did you know that our Prophet had that
[46:21] this age of Satan's Eden is to prove to
[46:24] Satan that this Eve that I'm preaching
[46:27] to you this morning this Eve is not like
[46:30] the first Eve in the
[46:32] garden for the bride we're here to prove
[46:35] something to the enemy is that we're
[46:38] going to grow into manifested sons of
[46:41] God praise the
[46:43] Lord amen and so now even though we're
[46:46] let me just pass that section because I
[46:48] think I said enough on that the Holy
[46:49] Ghost is the Journey of coming into all
[46:51] truth Jesus said this is what it is it's
[46:54] not a feeling the Holy Ghost is is not a
[46:56] tongue it's not a feeling it's not a
[46:58] sensation it's the life in you that
[47:01] seeks truth and all truth it never stops
[47:04] seeking truth about you about the word
[47:07] about the world about everything else we
[47:09] have to find truth the Holy Ghost if you
[47:11] have it will make you constantly for
[47:13] your whole life seek more truth because
[47:16] it's called the spirit of Truth John
[47:19] 14:26 but the comforter which is the
[47:22] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[47:24] my name he shall teach you all things
[47:27] what the Holy Ghost is going to teach
[47:29] you things yes the Holy Ghost is a
[47:31] teacher who is who is he teaching Sons
[47:34] and Daughters of God and he gives us
[47:37] this Holy Ghost you don't hear this
[47:39] preaching a lot but he actually says it
[47:41] will teach you all things he gives you
[47:43] the Holy Ghost to teach you
[47:47] something it's not just to give you a
[47:49] feeling or an emotion or no no it's it's
[47:52] he will teach you all things and bring
[47:55] all things to your remembrance what so
[47:57] I've said unto you John
[47:58] 15:26 John 15:26 but when the comforter
[48:02] has come whom I will send you from the
[48:04] father even the spirit of Truth which
[48:07] proceedeth from the father he shall
[48:10] testify of me he'll bring us back to
[48:13] Christ the Holy Ghost will point you
[48:14] back to Christ always back to Christ
[48:16] John
[48:18] 16:13 excuse me John 16:13 how be it
[48:21] when he the spirit of Truth is come
[48:24] what's it called a Spirit
[48:26] of what's it called Spirit of Truth the
[48:30] Holy Ghost is a spirit of Truth he will
[48:32] guide you into all truth how many can
[48:34] say Amen to that what will this Holy
[48:37] Ghost do will guide you into all Truth
[48:39] for he shall not speak of himself but
[48:42] whatsoever you shall hear that shall he
[48:44] speak and he will show you things to
[48:47] come all three of these scriptures they
[48:49] sound like a journey to
[48:51] me it doesn't sound like a one night
[48:53] thing it sounds like a journey
[48:56] I will lead you and guide you into all
[48:59] truth it sounds like a growth to
[49:03] me there's too many places in Paul's
[49:05] teaching he refers to it being a growth
[49:08] as he begin to lay this teaching in of
[49:09] adoption growing to maturity as opposed
[49:12] and listen friends I'm just only doing
[49:13] this because I'm on a series on the Holy
[49:15] Ghost and I've tried to take it from
[49:17] many perspectives but I can't teach on
[49:19] the Holy Ghost and preach on it unless I
[49:21] talk about adoption a maturity can you
[49:24] say Amen and where it's taking
[49:27] us I can't just preach it what it does
[49:30] to us to change our souls and our
[49:32] desires I've also got to preach about
[49:34] where it's taking
[49:36] us growing to maturity as opposed to
[49:39] Growing to maturity as opposed to
[49:40] staying babes spiritually he called the
[49:42] Corinthians babes carnal ye are babes in
[49:45] Christ ye are carnal Paul called them
[49:47] that they were Christians they were they
[49:50] had the Holy Ghost the Corinthians but
[49:52] they were babies with the Holy Ghost
[49:58] in Hebrews Paul said that your babes
[50:00] needing to you need your babes because
[50:03] you need to keep hearing the elementary
[50:04] principles but you need to leave those
[50:06] things and move on to Perfection just to
[50:08] so uh the way he said it Hebrews chapter
[50:10] 6 therefore leaving the principles of
[50:13] the doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[50:16] Perfection Hebrews chapter 6 therefore
[50:19] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[50:20] of Christ let us go onto Perfection once
[50:23] again grow to maturity not laying again
[50:26] the foundation of repentance from dead
[50:28] Works uh of Faith towards god of the
[50:32] doctrine of baptisms on the laying on of
[50:35] hands of the Resurrection or the
[50:36] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[50:38] judgment and this we will do if God
[50:40] permit he's saying that if you keep
[50:43] dwelling in that that's Elementary
[50:45] teachings we should know that and we
[50:46] should be moving on from that it's wrong
[50:49] to M uh to emphasize and major on a
[50:54] minor
[50:56] wow just the major on healing is the
[50:59] major on a
[51:00] minor are we dumping out the minor no we
[51:04] need the minor of healing because we get
[51:07] sick how many get sick okay four or five
[51:11] of us still getting sick so we still
[51:12] need healing we still need the atonement
[51:16] right so so now Paul when he says let's
[51:19] leave these things it doesn't mean we're
[51:21] we're ditching them we're does doesn't
[51:23] mean we're ditching the birth in the H
[51:25] ghost that doesn't mean we're ditching
[51:27] baptism and ditching no no no we have to
[51:29] have those we need the nine spiritual
[51:31] gifts in the
[51:33] church and they do work in the church
[51:36] because they don't happen in a service
[51:38] doesn't mean the nine spiritual gifts
[51:39] aren't working do you know what they are
[51:41] the word of wisdom the word of faith
[51:44] healing and it may not necessarily
[51:46] happen here in a service all the time
[51:48] but I can tell you in this body a Word
[51:51] of Wisdom a Word of Faith a word of
[51:53] encouragement healing is happening
[51:55] happening all the time we have the nine
[51:58] spiritual gifts in the
[52:01] church amen so now I read a quote to you
[52:06] from desperations Pentecost that's where
[52:09] you failed you thought because you were
[52:10] born of the spirit of God the birthright
[52:13] that settled it but it only starts it
[52:15] you remember in the message of hear him
[52:16] how that child after it was born in the
[52:18] family became a son it has rights to the
[52:20] birth but has to be proven child trained
[52:23] so did the Pentecostal the later on in
[52:25] the quote he says so do the Pentecostal
[52:27] people and they begin to organize the
[52:29] Oneness threeness and trinitarians and
[52:32] all kinds of organizations and fussing
[52:35] and pulling at one another prove that
[52:38] the token wasn't showing malice eny
[52:42] Strife see but that's where it's got to
[52:45] go friends listen now Paul is is made
[52:49] the distinctions and the prophet is
[52:51] making a distinction Pentecost this is
[52:53] where you have failed is that you did
[52:56] not bring this Holy Ghost as an adoption
[52:59] that it's taking you to maturity because
[53:02] you don't there's fussing there's
[53:04] pulling it what do all that it's
[53:05] immaturities malice Envy
[53:09] Strife amongst the ministers amongst the
[53:12] people
[53:15] immaturities but oh you could have a
[53:18] service and boy have the have the the
[53:20] power of God and have the emotion of God
[53:23] and all that you could have it so much
[53:25] but when characteristics of immaturities
[53:27] are still there something's missing
[53:29] that's right can I get an
[53:31] amen organizing into denominations
[53:34] Oneness Tess threeness trinitarians it
[53:37] becomes organizational becomes
[53:39] denominational when we fuss and Ste one
[53:41] another and divide over
[53:43] Doctrine we're just like a denomination
[53:46] when we divide over
[53:49] Doctrine praise the Lord so if Paul
[53:51] makes these distinctions in the New
[53:54] Testament about growing into adoption
[53:56] and that our Holy Ghost experience is
[53:58] growing into something then our
[54:00] Messenger will do the same thing because
[54:01] our messenger said the seventh angel
[54:03] messenger preached the same thing as the
[54:05] first Angel
[54:06] messenger and he said that he says I'm
[54:09] I'm glad because I preach the same thing
[54:10] Paul preached and he makes a pretty a
[54:14] bold statement here towards the
[54:16] Pentecostals Pentecost that's where you
[54:18] failed that's a pretty bold statement to
[54:20] say Pentecost you failed and then he
[54:22] says what you failed in that's pretty
[54:24] bold say that that Pentecost that's
[54:26] where you fail fail and that is that
[54:28] they were overlooking or skipping the
[54:31] adoption part of the Holy Ghost can I
[54:34] get an amen this
[54:36] morning Pentecost you're failing because
[54:38] you're skipping you're overlooking the
[54:41] other parts of the Holy Ghost with an
[54:44] emphasis only on the birth only on the
[54:46] gifts not where it is to take you to
[54:49] sunship to mature Sons to a placing of
[54:52] sons and to a Rapture can you say Amen
[54:55] Jesus himself his adoption time was not
[54:58] the same as his birth he had a birth he
[55:00] had midlife he had a he had a he had uh
[55:03] uh excuse me middle life at 12 years old
[55:05] it shows him he had his baptism he had
[55:07] his placing he learned obedience by the
[55:09] things he suffered until then a word
[55:12] came I'm pleased with my son this is my
[55:15] son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[55:18] in blessed be the name of the Lord the
[55:21] Greek word for adoption is heresia and
[55:24] it comes from two Greek words which
[55:26] means the placing the placing of a son
[55:29] and it occurs only five times in the New
[55:31] Testament this Greek word of aesia which
[55:35] it adoption it means placing of a son it
[55:38] does not mean the birth of a
[55:42] son it means placing and Paul used that
[55:48] term for a reason where the Holy Ghost
[55:51] is taking us when you see your placing
[55:54] his position as as a son when you see
[55:56] your placing in position as a son you
[55:59] come into power you come into Authority
[56:03] and you also you're growing in your
[56:05] character can you say
[56:07] Amen at the end time the Seven Seals
[56:10] were prophesied to be revealed for what
[56:13] why were the seals revealed to show Sons
[56:16] their position their place when he open
[56:19] the seals he hath made us Kings and
[56:21] Priests he hath made us he's making us
[56:24] into something something and so to show
[56:26] show it now he reveals himself the seals
[56:28] are himself as he reveals the son Christ
[56:31] he takes the seals off of himself to
[56:34] show Sons their place to position them
[56:36] the Mysteries then he gives all the
[56:38] Mysteries the serpent seed uh the future
[56:40] home all these Mysteries that have been
[56:42] revealed is to to place sons that they
[56:45] know who they are why do Sons need to
[56:48] know where they are in the word because
[56:50] the end time is the time for the
[56:52] manifestation of the sons of God
[56:55] all creation is
[56:58] waiting for the manifestation of the
[57:01] sons of God Malachi 45 and Revelations
[57:05] 10:7 which scriptures you're familiar
[57:07] with you should be Malachi 45 and
[57:10] Revelations 107 has been already
[57:13] fulfilled but it is to produced produce
[57:17] Romans 8:19 the manifestation of the
[57:20] sons of God can I say it again the
[57:23] scriptures already fulfilled
[57:25] God met our
[57:27] expectations we were expecting we were
[57:30] looking for God to fulfill his word in
[57:32] sending
[57:33] Elijah but I'm telling you that's been
[57:35] fulfilled but it's not all fulfilled yet
[57:38] all of those scriptures Revelations 10
[57:40] Matthew uh Malachi 45 and 6 Luke 17 all
[57:43] of them are being fulfilled now is to
[57:46] bring us to Romans 8:19 say that Romans
[57:52] 8:19 that's the scripture you need to
[57:54] pray about and and hone in them because
[57:55] this is the scripture that the message
[57:57] is
[57:59] producing that we're under the
[58:02] expectation for what the Holy Ghost is
[58:04] going to do not another healing
[58:10] Revival you with me this morning too
[58:13] much turkey on
[58:16] Thursday we're waiting and under
[58:19] expectation for the Holy Ghost what it's
[58:21] going to do not another healing Revival
[58:23] but all creation is waiting for the
[58:27] manifestation of the sons of
[58:30] God not just
[58:32] us but all of
[58:35] creatures let me wake you up a little
[58:38] bit do you ever wonder what the animals
[58:41] could tell us if they could talk to us
[58:44] right and they can't talk to us by the
[58:47] way I know there's some dog lovers that
[58:49] feel like their dog talks to
[58:52] them and dogs you know what what I feel
[58:55] about dogs dogs you want you what's on
[58:58] the minds of these animals what are they
[58:59] thinking well for dogs it's about
[59:03] food which I can relate to a little
[59:05] bit but you ever wonder what the animals
[59:08] are thinking because the Bible tell us
[59:10] here it's a mystery being open to us
[59:12] that all creatures all creation all have
[59:15] this sense in their conscience it's not
[59:17] they don't have a soul but they have a
[59:18] spirit you know animals can sense when
[59:20] there's there's a storm
[59:22] coming so they have a sense they have a
[59:25] a sick sense there they can tell
[59:26] something's happened and so they all
[59:28] sense probably sense one thing is that
[59:30] back about 6,000 years ago Adam a Son of
[59:33] God was in charge of this Earth there
[59:34] was no sin there was no scare there was
[59:36] no fear there was no animals that would
[59:38] come and eat them because there was no
[59:40] fear in this world because a Son of God
[59:43] was in his position and in control of
[59:45] everything then Eve fell and Adam fell
[59:48] with her and all of creation was lost
[59:50] everything comes under the bondage of
[59:52] fear everything goes arai everything for
[59:55] 6,000 years but God said I will restore
[59:57] I will redeem it I'll come to Calvary
[1:00:00] when he redeemed us at Calvary he
[1:00:02] redeemed the whole earth I'll bring the
[1:00:04] whole thing back I'm going to bring Sons
[1:00:06] back in their position and I'm going to
[1:00:08] bring the Earth I'm going to burn it
[1:00:09] with fire and it's going to come back to
[1:00:12] a Garden of Eden again and I'm going to
[1:00:14] put my sons on it and I'm going to
[1:00:16] restore everything back the way that it
[1:00:20] was so somehow all of creation knows
[1:00:23] this fall is taking place but they know
[1:00:25] in order to get it back the
[1:00:28] manifestation of the sons of God has to
[1:00:30] take place
[1:00:33] first and all creation's groaning we're
[1:00:35] groaning for
[1:00:37] it brother Randy we're groaning for
[1:00:39] something we're groaning in our hearts
[1:00:43] There's Something That We're and guess
[1:00:45] what all of creation is groaning for it
[1:00:47] as well you ever ask them if they would
[1:00:49] talk to you I wonder what they would
[1:00:50] tell us sons of God who believe this
[1:00:52] message I wonder what tell us
[1:00:55] if a squirrel talks to you what would
[1:00:58] they say I'm wondering if they would
[1:01:03] say why don't you Sons get your act
[1:01:08] together we're all waiting for this to
[1:01:11] wrap up hi
[1:01:15] Heather what in the world are you doing
[1:01:18] I'm wonder if they're tired of our
[1:01:20] immaturities just like I get tired of
[1:01:22] them and God gets tired of them and
[1:01:24] they've been waiting for 6,000 years and
[1:01:27] it's like guys get your act
[1:01:30] together take a hold of this word let it
[1:01:34] fill your whole being let it bring you
[1:01:36] to the place that your Rapture Ready and
[1:01:38] let it Rapture because we're waiting for
[1:01:41] this they're not concerned about the
[1:01:43] next president they're not concerned
[1:01:44] about what the next movie coming
[1:01:47] out they're not groaning waiting for the
[1:01:49] next movie like some of us Americans do
[1:01:52] they're not worried about Christmas
[1:01:54] they're not worried about where's the
[1:01:55] next money because the Bible tells us
[1:01:57] they have a conscience of God that takes
[1:01:58] care of them that says they're not
[1:02:00] worried about what's where the next meal
[1:02:01] is coming from they're completely
[1:02:03] dependent on God they have things
[1:02:05] probably better without a soul
[1:02:08] sometimes it's a dependence on God but
[1:02:11] what are you guys doing I wonder if if
[1:02:14] they could say something to us and
[1:02:16] they're groaning for this they could if
[1:02:18] I could just say something to these
[1:02:20] people stop fussing stop fighting stop
[1:02:24] haggling over
[1:02:28] Doctrine quit all this
[1:02:32] stuff chatter from a squirrel just stop
[1:02:37] it find your place stand there as a son
[1:02:41] and daughter in power in authority and
[1:02:44] in
[1:02:46] maturity get your act together it's a
[1:02:50] finished work so walk into the finished
[1:02:52] work let's get this thing wrapped up I
[1:02:56] wonder if the Lions and all the ones
[1:02:58] over at the Zoo today and all of
[1:03:00] creation everything is groaning and
[1:03:02] waiting for the manifestation of the Son
[1:03:05] of God I wonder if they could tell you
[1:03:06] let's let's finish this up we're tired
[1:03:10] of this world we're tired of the
[1:03:13] fear
[1:03:15] right praise the Lord let me know if a
[1:03:17] squirrel talks to you this week let me
[1:03:20] know what he says or
[1:03:23] she
[1:03:25] David Weber a Christian writer says the
[1:03:27] traditional Hebrew view of the adoption
[1:03:29] of a son has absolutely nothing to do
[1:03:31] with the placement of an orphan in a
[1:03:33] foster home rather it has to do with a
[1:03:35] young man coming into a place of
[1:03:36] maturity whereby the full Authority and
[1:03:38] resources of his father are bestowed
[1:03:41] upon
[1:03:42] him when it says manifestations of the
[1:03:45] Son of God it means a revealing in
[1:03:46] Romans 8:19 the word for re
[1:03:48] manifestation is apocalypsis which
[1:03:51] simply means disclosure manifestation
[1:03:53] means disclosure in other words
[1:03:55] throughout the whole new testament it is
[1:03:57] also translated appearing coming
[1:04:00] Enlighten Revelation the definition
[1:04:02] assigned to its root word is to take off
[1:04:04] the cover therefore when we come across
[1:04:06] this word apocalypsis in the Scripture
[1:04:08] it has to do with exposing of something
[1:04:11] that has been hidden from view or
[1:04:13] bringing into light that which has been
[1:04:15] kept OBS in obscurity In this passage of
[1:04:17] scripture it should be pretty clear that
[1:04:20] what God has been hiding and has been
[1:04:23] held in obscurity is the sons of God
[1:04:27] he's been hiding the full potential and
[1:04:29] what the sons of God are and so now it's
[1:04:31] in a great revealing of his son Christ
[1:04:34] Seven Seals in a great revealing at the
[1:04:37] end time of his son Christ in the seven
[1:04:40] seal he is those seals and he reveals
[1:04:43] himself himself for his sons to see
[1:04:47] themselves as
[1:04:49] well it's all about seeing yourself it's
[1:04:52] all about seeing your position
[1:04:55] and walking into that position in in
[1:04:57] maturity so it's it's it's when he this
[1:05:00] is the wonderful thing about the Seven
[1:05:02] Seals and the revealing of Christ when
[1:05:04] he fully uncovers himself then he
[1:05:07] uncovers all the sons because wherever
[1:05:09] he's going that's where all the sons are
[1:05:12] going the revealing of his son in the
[1:05:16] company of his sons it was is what
[1:05:19] brings us to a climax if you want
[1:05:20] scripture for that it's 1 John 3 and: 2
[1:05:24] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:05:26] it do not yet appear what we shall be
[1:05:29] but we know that when he shall appear a
[1:05:33] apocalypsis when he shall appear we
[1:05:37] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:05:40] as he is when we see him as he is then
[1:05:43] we see ourselves as who we really
[1:05:47] are manifestation of the sons of God now
[1:05:51] now you take the Greek work I'm not a
[1:05:52] big Greek word person we let the teach
[1:05:54] teachers do that this was very
[1:05:55] interesting that in the Bible in the New
[1:05:58] Testament there were three different
[1:05:59] Greek words for Sons if you guys want to
[1:06:01] put that slide up three different Greek
[1:06:03] words for Sons number one is Tech neon
[1:06:06] which means an infant or a baby and
[1:06:07] you'll find places when it says sons in
[1:06:10] the New Testament that refers to this
[1:06:13] Greek word okay secondly is techon youth
[1:06:17] or teenagers or Adolescent and you'll
[1:06:19] find that Greek word referring to uh
[1:06:22] that age group when Jesus was 12 years
[1:06:25] old and so that's what refers to that
[1:06:27] those situations but then this last one
[1:06:30] is the Greek word for sons in Romans
[1:06:35] 8:19 uh is that what the scripture is
[1:06:37] yes in Romans 8 where it says the
[1:06:39] manifestation of sons this Sons is the
[1:06:42] Greek word Paul used and he had to use
[1:06:44] this Greek word hus uh who us which
[1:06:47] means fully matured Sons so when he says
[1:06:51] the manifestation of sons he don't mean
[1:06:54] an infant or a baby he doesn't mean a
[1:06:56] teenager when this comes it's fully
[1:06:59] matured
[1:07:03] Sons Paul was very careful if you want
[1:07:07] to take a picture of that course you're
[1:07:11] not supposed to have your phones in
[1:07:17] church this is the places that it
[1:07:19] mentions Sons but Paul is very careful
[1:07:21] in his choice of words for the word Sons
[1:07:24] Paul chose the word whoos rather than
[1:07:27] the word techon which means infant or
[1:07:30] techon which speaks of a child or youth
[1:07:32] because he was not referring to Mere
[1:07:35] children
[1:07:37] whoos specifically speaks of matured
[1:07:40] fully developed sons are those who have
[1:07:42] come of age into full maturity of the
[1:07:44] three words hos is the only word that
[1:07:46] the Holy Spirit inspired Paul to use
[1:07:48] when he spoke of those to be manifested
[1:07:50] as sons of God in Romans 8 it's all by
[1:07:53] the the same holy ghost in other words
[1:07:56] all of these Sons is all by the same
[1:07:59] Holy Ghost it's all stages by the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost being in you these are the stages
[1:08:06] of
[1:08:07] it but it's all this Sons that's born h
[1:08:11] a reference to that is is in uhh John 1
[1:08:16] those who received him to them gave he
[1:08:19] power to become the sons of God well
[1:08:22] that Sons is not a mature son that's
[1:08:24] something different that's either a baby
[1:08:25] or infant that's a different meaning to
[1:08:27] it so you when you receive him then you
[1:08:31] receive the power to become a Son of God
[1:08:34] but in Romans we find a different thing
[1:08:37] now let me just uh read a little bit
[1:08:40] more from some writers this is from uh
[1:08:44] Mary Kay I don't know where her La last
[1:08:45] name is but she said a few good things
[1:08:47] there I wanted to read in relation to
[1:08:49] some of the quotes that I want to read
[1:08:50] as well spiritual babes who are carnal
[1:08:53] and immature 1 Corinthians 3 are easily
[1:08:57] influenced by teaching and schemes of
[1:08:59] men because they have not exercised
[1:09:01] their senses to discern both good and
[1:09:03] evil Ephesians 4:14 neus also fed on the
[1:09:08] Milk of the word of God neus also feeds
[1:09:11] on the M of word and are unskilled in
[1:09:12] the word of righteousness that's one of
[1:09:14] these Greek words here not the last one
[1:09:16] although they have received a revelation
[1:09:18] of who God is and have entered into New
[1:09:20] Life nepus are inclined to the Natural
[1:09:23] and flesh life
[1:09:24] they are those who are quick to gossip
[1:09:26] cause conflict and division are
[1:09:28] self-centered and enter into Strife they
[1:09:31] are spiritual babies and that is what
[1:09:33] babies do they whine fight scream and
[1:09:37] always cry when they do not get their
[1:09:41] ways so this is the reference to that
[1:09:44] first uh word if you just leave that up
[1:09:46] for a couple minutes this is a reference
[1:09:48] to babies in Christ that have the
[1:09:51] characteristics of self-centered and
[1:09:53] strife and cause Division and quick to
[1:09:58] gossip spiritual babies W whine and
[1:10:01] fight and scream and always cry when
[1:10:03] they do not get their
[1:10:05] ways in John 215 the word children in
[1:10:09] the verse implies that there's an
[1:10:10] existing relationship but a deficiency
[1:10:13] in maturity and reveals the childish
[1:10:15] nature of the disciples at that time
[1:10:17] these disciples had slipped back and
[1:10:19] disconnected from their assignment as
[1:10:20] followers of Christ after the death of
[1:10:23] Jesus by going back to the usual routine
[1:10:25] fishing when we disconnect from our
[1:10:28] assignment following a an offense a
[1:10:30] heartbreak or a bitter moment we are
[1:10:33] still
[1:10:34] children oh can I read it again when we
[1:10:37] disconnect disconnect from our
[1:10:39] assignment being in the line of duty it
[1:10:41] would be the way brother Brandon words
[1:10:43] it following an offense or a heartbreak
[1:10:46] or a bitter moment we are still acting
[1:10:49] like spiritual
[1:10:52] children Patty are under the to to uh
[1:10:56] toage or excuse me the um the teaching
[1:10:59] of a spiritual father in the church
[1:11:01] because they are not ready for the world
[1:11:03] on their own so this is all all in the
[1:11:05] category of Christians that are babies
[1:11:07] and not growing up but I want to go back
[1:11:09] to that incident that she brings up in
[1:11:11] John 215 because that's that's the
[1:11:13] teenager that's the spiritual teenager
[1:11:16] that these disciples had Walk With Jesus
[1:11:18] all these years and these three three
[1:11:20] and a half years and seen his miracles
[1:11:22] and done all these things under the sun
[1:11:23] a man and all of a sudden now when when
[1:11:26] he's gone they don't know what to do so
[1:11:29] Peter they're just all depressed and
[1:11:31] discouraged and this trial has come and
[1:11:33] they don't know where they stand anymore
[1:11:35] then then we see that he said Peter says
[1:11:39] I'm I'm going fishing so they're
[1:11:41] defaulting back to their old thing they
[1:11:43] used to do for maybe a relaxation and
[1:11:45] there's not a problem with using fishing
[1:11:47] as a relaxation but these guys were in
[1:11:49] their doubt and their fear I'm giving up
[1:11:51] I'm I'm going away I just need to go
[1:11:53] fishing I know some of you men say that
[1:11:55] on some
[1:11:56] days I need to get out of this house so
[1:11:58] I'm going fishing so it's not really bad
[1:12:00] it's just when you lose your position as
[1:12:02] a Son of God and you get away from the
[1:12:05] word don't take a vacation from the
[1:12:07] word I'm going on vacation don't take a
[1:12:10] vacation from God and all everything you
[1:12:12] believe don't start wearing things that
[1:12:14] you wouldn't normally
[1:12:15] wear we're still a Christ on vacation
[1:12:20] right
[1:12:21] Glory so here they are and they I go a
[1:12:25] fish it and so they go out there and
[1:12:27] they fish all night and they don't catch
[1:12:30] anything brother
[1:12:34] Tom the master comes they didn't even
[1:12:36] know who he was they got so far away
[1:12:38] from him they didn't even know was Jesus
[1:12:39] yet but he says hey how's it going the
[1:12:41] fishing we've fished all night and
[1:12:43] haven't caught a thing sometimes it's
[1:12:46] that
[1:12:47] way and so we we're we're we really need
[1:12:50] some fish here we really need to you
[1:12:52] know that but we haven't got nothing
[1:12:54] listen when you choose to in your
[1:12:57] immaturity walk away from God and go do
[1:13:00] your own thing for a while don't ever
[1:13:02] expect God to bless what you're
[1:13:06] doing CU he knows how to get your
[1:13:10] attention and our God the creator of the
[1:13:13] fish can direct those fish away from
[1:13:17] your
[1:13:18] net come on can you say Amen you think
[1:13:21] you're gonna walk away from God or maybe
[1:13:23] take a vacation from God or maybe I'm
[1:13:25] going to be on the fence for a while I
[1:13:27] don't really know if I really believe
[1:13:28] this so I'm going to take a pause take a
[1:13:30] that's a let's take a pause from this
[1:13:33] relationship we're going to take a break
[1:13:35] from our relationship whatever that
[1:13:37] means and so you take a break from your
[1:13:39] relationship from the message from the
[1:13:41] word from Christ and all that listen
[1:13:43] God's got your
[1:13:44] number God knows how to get you he had
[1:13:47] Jonah's number when he ran away from the
[1:13:49] presence of the Lord and because he was
[1:13:51] a son can you say man he wasn't gonna
[1:13:54] get away from God God was gonna find him
[1:13:57] he will find you no matter where you go
[1:14:00] because his love did not go just because
[1:14:02] you measured up his love goes all the
[1:14:04] way until the end for your
[1:14:06] life and they do they we fished all
[1:14:08] night and God will not bless what you do
[1:14:12] when you're all in a a tizzy because of
[1:14:15] someone disappointing you what did the
[1:14:17] the Christian writers say here said that
[1:14:19] something's happened to you something
[1:14:21] has uh you know what she called it a
[1:14:24] heartbreak an offense somebody offended
[1:14:26] you or or you had a bitter
[1:14:31] moment why do we why do we distance
[1:14:33] oursel from God then sometimes because
[1:14:36] our spirit has been damaged by somebody
[1:14:39] hurting
[1:14:40] us but we don't need to run from
[1:14:44] God so they're not acting like disciples
[1:14:46] at all they're acting like Teenage
[1:14:52] believers
[1:14:54] you ever wonder how teenagers you know
[1:14:56] how they act it's it's amazing teenagers
[1:14:59] all due respect to you teenagers today
[1:15:02] you know I love
[1:15:03] you but teenagers have this
[1:15:05] characteristic that they want all the
[1:15:09] Privileges of an
[1:15:11] adult and they want to be treated like
[1:15:14] an adult but then they want to act like
[1:15:17] a 5-year-old
[1:15:19] sometimes not many amens especially from
[1:15:22] the teenagers but listen I've lived this
[1:15:24] out my dad said you haven't raised kids
[1:15:26] until you raised teenagers they are very
[1:15:28] unique they are very special I actually
[1:15:30] have ministered more to them around the
[1:15:31] world in my Ministry than anybody else I
[1:15:33] love the youth I like to be around them
[1:15:35] I like to stay young that's one of the
[1:15:36] reasons I like to be around the young
[1:15:38] people I like when they go through these
[1:15:40] stages but then when I went through my
[1:15:42] own I thought this is a challenge this
[1:15:44] is different dad you were right you
[1:15:47] haven't raised children till you raised
[1:15:48] teenagers because it's all up and down
[1:15:51] of emotions and everywhere and here and
[1:15:53] there and they want the Privileges of
[1:15:55] being an adult they want the car keys
[1:15:58] but the way they're acting you're scared
[1:16:00] to give them the car
[1:16:02] keys because they're acting like a child
[1:16:05] grow up a little bit I give you the car
[1:16:08] keys tough guy you
[1:16:13] know I'm in my room and you just come
[1:16:16] and get me I want to be showed some
[1:16:18] respect
[1:16:19] here I can bench
[1:16:22] 150 yeah pick up your
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:32] socks yeah yeah it's it's real and you
[1:16:36] know it's real that's why a lot of
[1:16:37] parents are laughing it's real okay it
[1:16:40] happens it's just the adst but listen
[1:16:42] I'm going over to the spiritual I won't
[1:16:44] say any more about teenagers because I
[1:16:45] love you to death but I'm going over you
[1:16:47] can go through a stage spiritually as
[1:16:51] teenagers and the discip IES were going
[1:16:53] through it and they were acting very
[1:16:57] embarrassing probably to the master but
[1:16:59] his love held true to him am and
[1:17:01] actually they didn't deserve but he said
[1:17:03] you know what turn bring your nets over
[1:17:05] to the other side and that was kind of
[1:17:07] crazy he always asks us to do something
[1:17:10] crazy can you say Amen from our mental
[1:17:13] no that's never going to work I've been
[1:17:15] a fisherman all my life just do what he
[1:17:17] says just do what God says cuz he'll ask
[1:17:20] us to do something very little that
[1:17:21] seems very crazy to the world but you
[1:17:23] better follow it cuz he's going to show
[1:17:25] you something he's going to show the
[1:17:27] disciples something that you can't ask
[1:17:29] me to bless anything that you that you
[1:17:31] have ran away from me and unless God is
[1:17:35] in your life nothing prospers the right
[1:17:38] way can you say Amen unless God is in
[1:17:42] your business and he's the priority in
[1:17:44] your life don't come and pray and ask us
[1:17:46] to pray that God Prosper your business
[1:17:50] true that God multiplies the fishes that
[1:17:53] but he they didn't deserve it but he's
[1:17:55] going to show them a lesson he says cast
[1:17:56] your nets on the other side all right
[1:17:58] they cast them over and then God
[1:18:00] supernaturally directs all those fish
[1:18:03] within a about a mile radius he directs
[1:18:06] all those fish by the power of the Holy
[1:18:11] Spirit here's sons that can't even be
[1:18:13] led by the Holy Spirit and fish are just
[1:18:16] being led by the Holy Spirit and they
[1:18:17] all come into Peter's net and they all
[1:18:20] get caught in there and they can't
[1:18:21] hardly bring it out of the water because
[1:18:23] there's so many fish listen everybody
[1:18:26] God is in control of your life and God
[1:18:30] can direct the fish he can direct a
[1:18:32] whale he can direct anything in your
[1:18:34] life and put his hand on
[1:18:36] it to cause you to mature as a Son of
[1:18:40] God because now he's in the work of
[1:18:43] maturing
[1:18:44] Sons through trials through tribulation
[1:18:48] through
[1:18:50] losses oh my
[1:18:58] from the age of 12 until 30 Jesus
[1:19:00] remains subject to his father and mother
[1:19:02] until the appointed time to begin his
[1:19:03] Heavenly father's assignment as a mature
[1:19:05] son hiis which is the last word here
[1:19:09] hiis they're ready for
[1:19:11] commissioning they're ready for
[1:19:13] commissioning does this sound like the
[1:19:14] pattern ministers follow today most
[1:19:17] often when some ministers begin to taste
[1:19:19] of the sweetness of God's anointing they
[1:19:21] never want to submit under anyone's
[1:19:23] Authority again sometime they don't care
[1:19:25] whether they are mature enough but once
[1:19:27] they know they have a calling and feel a
[1:19:29] radical Zeal to serve they just take off
[1:19:32] to fulfill it by failing to submit under
[1:19:34] a Spiritual Authority and waiting for
[1:19:36] the appointed time it is possible that
[1:19:39] one cannot sustain that fire and Zeal of
[1:19:42] their calling without a guardian even
[1:19:45] for a half a decade more like the
[1:19:46] prodical son in Luke 15 she it's a good
[1:19:50] point here friends is that it's a
[1:19:52] teenage thing I got a calling now I'm
[1:19:53] just going to run with it I'm going to
[1:19:55] go but you're not under the authority of
[1:19:56] a pastor you're not accountable to
[1:19:58] anybody I'm just going to go with this
[1:20:00] you're not submissive to the local
[1:20:01] church and in a body that doesn't work
[1:20:04] that way there is a maturity there's an
[1:20:06] accountability for God to identify your
[1:20:08] gift right it's not just that you can
[1:20:10] preach it's not just that you have a
[1:20:13] gift it's that can you mature into a
[1:20:16] full Son of God can you be under
[1:20:18] Authority can you be
[1:20:21] corrected if you got that attitude right
[1:20:23] way I know everything I've got a gift
[1:20:25] I'm a preacher now you've got that going
[1:20:27] on right away I might I'm not going to
[1:20:29] preach you that much because you're
[1:20:30] growing in the word you're growing in
[1:20:32] your gift but you're growing into
[1:20:33] maturity as well you can be corrected by
[1:20:36] the word of
[1:20:38] God I want you to notice can I have a
[1:20:41] little time
[1:20:42] today it's still good time here I want
[1:20:45] you to notice in the message if Paul
[1:20:46] preached those two things or three
[1:20:48] things then notice in the message how
[1:20:50] the prophet preaches all three of this
[1:20:52] all right here's this infant stage
[1:20:55] neither does the modern church this is
[1:20:58] in the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:21:00] Christ 1965 neither does this modern
[1:21:03] Church want any of these here screaming
[1:21:06] shouting tongue speaking acts 238
[1:21:09] youngans around her yeah yeah she don't
[1:21:12] want any of them whooping and crying and
[1:21:14] screaming amen hallelujah why such a
[1:21:17] child would immediately put her out uh
[1:21:19] put her out of their denomination they
[1:21:21] had one like that one in the churches
[1:21:22] why they throw her out right quick why
[1:21:24] are you letting such as that stuff go on
[1:21:26] so you see she's pregnated with
[1:21:28] something cuz she's pre bringing forth
[1:21:31] more members all the time but she don't
[1:21:33] want none of them screaming hollering
[1:21:35] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[1:21:39] that that she thinks they
[1:21:41] are that is the modern
[1:21:44] Church shame on any church that would
[1:21:47] put down the birth the birth is a mess
[1:21:50] can you say Amen you're born as a baby
[1:21:52] BBE can you say amen and you might get
[1:21:54] emotional in different ways and a birth
[1:21:57] Shane on on us if we become a modern
[1:21:59] Church where we put that out that is
[1:22:01] part of the work of the Holy
[1:22:05] Ghost it would embarrass her to keep her
[1:22:08] around it would ruin her in her educated
[1:22:09] ethical scientific Society churches
[1:22:12] belong to her they would throw her out
[1:22:14] as the next Council she can't have it so
[1:22:17] she don't want to be pregnated with the
[1:22:19] word because that's the only kind that
[1:22:22] the word can bring
[1:22:27] forth you get all starchy and say I
[1:22:29] don't want to hear any of that mess
[1:22:31] going on and that screaming and shouting
[1:22:33] somebody getting happy something wrong
[1:22:36] with
[1:22:37] you this he said this is the kind of
[1:22:39] word produces right I know I teach you
[1:22:43] here that everybody worships the
[1:22:45] different ways don't feel like well that
[1:22:47] person cuz they're dancing the aisles
[1:22:48] they got something they may not have got
[1:22:50] something we don't know we we can't
[1:22:52] assume what they get but don't you dare
[1:22:54] criticize it and you may have emotion
[1:22:56] you just joy in your heart happy that
[1:22:58] God's done something just standing there
[1:22:59] crying we all worship different can you
[1:23:02] say Amen but if we ever get this starchy
[1:23:04] Church in this box that we put that we
[1:23:06] don't want we need to create an
[1:23:08] atmosphere for birth to take
[1:23:10] place our children need to be born again
[1:23:14] you say well I don't want any emotional
[1:23:15] with you don't choose what you get with
[1:23:16] you say I just want the Lord and if he
[1:23:19] embarrasses me whatever happens I want
[1:23:21] him with all my heart
[1:23:24] so you have this and then when when the
[1:23:27] prophet was return referring to his
[1:23:29] dreams about the third pole you remember
[1:23:32] the first pole and he was fishing and he
[1:23:34] he put out a line and he was teaching
[1:23:36] these preachers how he did the gift and
[1:23:38] in the second pole discernment he was
[1:23:40] kind of teaching this is how you do it
[1:23:42] this is how you get the fish like that
[1:23:44] and he was rebuked by the angel of the
[1:23:46] Lord and it said you can't teach
[1:23:50] Pentecostal babies Supernatural things
[1:23:52] things and he's trying to show him now
[1:23:54] when you get to the third poll don't try
[1:23:57] to teach this this won't be a public
[1:23:59] show don't tell the ministers what
[1:24:01] you're doing don't tell anybody else you
[1:24:03] know why because you can't teach
[1:24:05] Pentecostal babies real Supernatural
[1:24:09] things they are teenagers
[1:24:12] spiritually they're not wanting to grow
[1:24:15] into the third pole like a teenager
[1:24:17] wants all their privileges but wants to
[1:24:19] act CH childlike and behavior so so the
[1:24:22] pentec OST Les they want to stay in
[1:24:23] their baby form or their baby way with
[1:24:26] just emotion but they do not want to
[1:24:28] grow into real true Supernatural
[1:24:32] things in the same message we see in our
[1:24:36] message that God sent us we see adoption
[1:24:40] sermons the same message that says that
[1:24:43] you don't want those acts 238 miserable
[1:24:46] creatures being born in your church that
[1:24:48] way but in the same message we have
[1:24:51] messages of adopted Sons like why cry
[1:24:56] speak and go
[1:24:58] forward and like when I was listened to
[1:25:00] last night Paul a prisoner of
[1:25:05] Christ so he's the one that referred to
[1:25:07] himself in his letters Paul an apostle
[1:25:09] of Christ Paul he's got all these
[1:25:13] references to who he
[1:25:14] is and he's referring to himself what he
[1:25:17] did and all of them the rest of them
[1:25:18] sound glorious but when he came to Paul
[1:25:20] a prisoner he was was not referring to
[1:25:23] him being in prison which he was all the
[1:25:24] time he was saying I have come to the
[1:25:26] place that I willingly give up my free
[1:25:32] will because the prophet starts that
[1:25:34] message saying we all have a free will
[1:25:35] God doesn't override our free will we
[1:25:37] have a choice but then he goes on to
[1:25:39] this whole mystery of Christ saying I'm
[1:25:43] giving all that up my ambitions what I
[1:25:46] wanted to do that's all secondary to the
[1:25:49] will of God for my life and I become a
[1:25:51] slave a PR prisoner to the will of God
[1:25:53] and to his word and to everybody else's
[1:25:56] will as well because there was two
[1:25:57] things you can be swayed by your own
[1:25:59] will but you can be swayed by the
[1:26:01] family's will come on now familes
[1:26:05] coaching you to do something cousins and
[1:26:08] mother-in-laws and mothers and everybody
[1:26:10] you should do this you should this what
[1:26:12] you should do is listen to their counsel
[1:26:13] you should pray for the will of God
[1:26:15] because you can be swayed by their will
[1:26:18] instead of the will of
[1:26:21] God and a mature son comes to the place
[1:26:24] that Paul's giving it up saying I no
[1:26:26] longer want my own choice I want God's
[1:26:29] choice friends that's
[1:26:32] maturity I would ask the question if any
[1:26:34] of us are there this
[1:26:36] morning that we've completely come to a
[1:26:38] place of full surrender that the will of
[1:26:41] God is the word of God and I'm looking
[1:26:44] every day to find his perfect will for
[1:26:46] my life and if something comes up and
[1:26:48] hears his will and he's showing me and I
[1:26:50] have my own will at Battle I I lay down
[1:26:52] my own will and I take the word of
[1:26:55] God I no longer want my choice brother B
[1:26:58] says Sons and Daughters of God no longer
[1:27:00] want their own choice because they we
[1:27:02] see where it got us in the garden that's
[1:27:05] right so there's so much in it now with
[1:27:09] all these adoption messages that I've
[1:27:11] mentioned to you the Holy Ghost is put
[1:27:13] in us not to leave us as babies it's to
[1:27:15] mature us into Authority and character
[1:27:18] can you say that you can't can you can't
[1:27:21] preach just one one meaning to the sons
[1:27:23] you can't just preach one of these
[1:27:25] meetings you have to preach all of these
[1:27:28] CU all of them are in the scripture and
[1:27:30] all of them are in the message can I get
[1:27:31] an amen if I'm going to be a gospel
[1:27:34] preacher I have to preach all of these
[1:27:35] to be a right message preacher can you
[1:27:37] say Amen you can't just preach the birth
[1:27:40] side all the time you can't just preach
[1:27:42] the power of sons all the time you can't
[1:27:44] preach that young ones got the power if
[1:27:47] there's no repentance in their life no
[1:27:49] you can't say you've got power you've
[1:27:50] got power and they've never repented and
[1:27:52] they don't even have the Holy Ghost they
[1:27:54] don't even have salvation yet you can't
[1:27:56] tell them and they're up on the stage
[1:27:57] shouting and jumping that they got power
[1:27:59] if they haven't truly repented they
[1:28:01] don't have the power yet so don't tell
[1:28:03] them they have the
[1:28:06] power shouting everywhere saying we got
[1:28:08] the power we got the power you can't
[1:28:10] preach power of the Holy Ghost without
[1:28:12] preaching also the character the growth
[1:28:15] the maturity of the Holy Ghost for me a
[1:28:18] minister who leans towards preaching and
[1:28:20] teaching more about the op option side I
[1:28:22] know I'm that way I lean that thank God
[1:28:24] for other fivefold Ministry that
[1:28:26] preaches other things as well and we try
[1:28:28] to bring them in but you see now for a
[1:28:30] minister it's hard for me to say things
[1:28:31] because I lean more towards the adoption
[1:28:33] side I like to see people living what
[1:28:36] they're dancing about I like to people
[1:28:38] people walk out of here with something
[1:28:40] real something genuine can you say Amen
[1:28:44] it's not that you danced or shouted but
[1:28:46] deep down inside you really have a
[1:28:48] relationship with Christ and you have
[1:28:50] been delivered from from
[1:28:53] things it's hard to preach this way
[1:28:55] because you get criticism for it they
[1:28:58] think you're just leaning one way but I
[1:28:59] trust God that I'm not but it's hard to
[1:29:01] preach on this side because you're tired
[1:29:03] of the immaturities and you're wanting
[1:29:05] to see real genuine birth real genuine
[1:29:10] growth to maturity real genuine
[1:29:14] Supernatural
[1:29:17] lives preaching just the first two
[1:29:19] meetings preaching just the birth is a
[1:29:21] lot more exciting and you get a lot more
[1:29:27] response
[1:29:32] amen there are things that I can preach
[1:29:34] that would really encourage you and make
[1:29:36] you you see you can't just preach the
[1:29:38] things that preach
[1:29:39] good and make you feel good not when
[1:29:42] you're maturing
[1:29:44] Sons can't always do that maturity is
[1:29:46] what we look for maturity is where the
[1:29:48] Holy Ghost is taking us Power Authority
[1:29:50] but not without humility maturity and
[1:29:52] character what does it look like one
[1:29:54] Christian writer said maturity isn't
[1:29:56] about age can I take a minute and say
[1:29:58] just show what maturity looks like
[1:30:02] now what does it look like maturity
[1:30:04] isn't about age you can be a Christian
[1:30:06] for 50 years and still not be
[1:30:09] mature maturity isn't about appearance
[1:30:11] some people may look spiritually mature
[1:30:13] but they aren't just because someone
[1:30:16] appears dignified it doesn't mean they
[1:30:17] are holy maturity isn't about
[1:30:19] achievement you can accomplish much
[1:30:21] without being mature in your faith
[1:30:23] maturity isn't about academics a
[1:30:25] seminary degree or a bible college
[1:30:27] degree doesn't make you spiritually
[1:30:29] mature you don't get to be mature by
[1:30:32] comparing yourself to anyone else you
[1:30:33] become mature by comparing yourself to
[1:30:35] the word of
[1:30:37] God and this writer says the Book of
[1:30:39] James becomes almost a manual on how to
[1:30:41] be mature it gives five marks of
[1:30:43] spiritual maturity number one a mature
[1:30:45] person is positive Under
[1:30:47] Pressure dear brothers in James 1 when
[1:30:50] Troubles of any kind your way considered
[1:30:52] an opportunity for Great Joy when
[1:30:53] troubles come your
[1:30:55] way Lord help us to respond with joy in
[1:30:59] the midst of our trials this is going to
[1:31:01] be for my good I can't stand it I don't
[1:31:04] want it to go this way but I'm going to
[1:31:05] say Lord I bring my joyful heart before
[1:31:07] you because I know this will be for my
[1:31:09] good that takes maturity to do that
[1:31:12] Hallelujah just because you come you
[1:31:15] became a Christ follower doesn't mean
[1:31:17] you won't face troubles the question
[1:31:18] isn't whether you experience problems
[1:31:20] it's about how you respond to the
[1:31:21] problem s don't you do you get nervous
[1:31:23] do you get uptight do you get Negative
[1:31:26] do you
[1:31:28] Grumble you can be full of Bible
[1:31:30] knowledge and still be grumpy while
[1:31:32] Under
[1:31:35] Pressure oh Lord we'll take this
[1:31:38] rebuke you can be full of the message
[1:31:41] quotes and still be a grumpy person when
[1:31:45] a trial hit
[1:31:49] you number two a mature person is s
[1:31:51] sensitive to people James 2 says it is
[1:31:54] good when you obey the Royal law as
[1:31:55] found in the scriptures love your
[1:31:56] neighbor as yourself when children are
[1:31:58] immature they are completely
[1:31:59] self-focused I say that's true when
[1:32:01] children only think about theel they're
[1:32:03] not going to share that candy with
[1:32:04] somebody else they're not going to give
[1:32:06] it when children are immature they are
[1:32:07] completely self-focused but mature
[1:32:09] people don't just see their own needs
[1:32:11] they see the needs of
[1:32:13] others number three a mature person has
[1:32:15] mastered his mouth all of us make a lot
[1:32:17] of mistakes if someone doesn't make
[1:32:19] mistakes James says when he speaks he
[1:32:21] would be perfect he would be able to
[1:32:22] control everything that he does James
[1:32:24] 3:2 one thing doctors often say when you
[1:32:27] go for a checkup is stick out your
[1:32:30] tongue that's why I preached on last
[1:32:33] Sunday and doctors will say first thing
[1:32:36] stick out your
[1:32:40] tongue should we do that at the door
[1:32:42] when you come in on Sunday
[1:32:45] mornings stick out your
[1:32:48] tongue the doctor uses your tongue to
[1:32:51] check your health God does that
[1:32:53] spiritually too James 3 gives several
[1:32:55] illustrations regarding the tongue we
[1:32:57] can bridle horses we can put utter in
[1:32:59] the ship spark to a fire no one can tame
[1:33:02] the tongue it is an UNC uncontrollable
[1:33:04] evil filled with dead deadly poison
[1:33:06] what's he saying saying the same thing I
[1:33:08] said last Sunday is that when we our
[1:33:10] tongue has been brought un control of
[1:33:12] the Holy Spirit we are maturing into a
[1:33:14] Son of God number four a mature person
[1:33:16] is a peacemaker not a troublemaker what
[1:33:18] causes fights and quarrels among you
[1:33:20] James says in James 4 don't they come
[1:33:22] from your desires that battle within you
[1:33:24] when you're fussing and suing and you
[1:33:26] think it's the other person's problem no
[1:33:28] there's something battling inside of you
[1:33:30] because if you were at peace you
[1:33:31] wouldn't be fussing so much with
[1:33:32] everybody else come they not of your own
[1:33:35] Wars within
[1:33:36] yourself we all know Christians who make
[1:33:39] make trouble more than they make peace
[1:33:42] conflict isn't a Christian virtue in
[1:33:44] fact the opposite is true it's a sign of
[1:33:45] immaturity conflict all the time is a
[1:33:48] sign of immaturity James tells us
[1:33:50] selfishness and judgmentalism as the two
[1:33:53] biggest sources of conflict in our lives
[1:33:55] both of those things prevent us from
[1:33:56] Christlike maturity Jesus asked us to
[1:33:58] pursue Pride keeps us from admitting
[1:34:00] we're wrong judgmentalism puts us in the
[1:34:03] place of God Christian maturity means
[1:34:05] learning to say no to a selfish
[1:34:08] judgmental attitude that regularly
[1:34:10] causes
[1:34:11] conflict I say Amen number five a matur
[1:34:15] person is patient and prayerful because
[1:34:17] James says be patient unto the coming of
[1:34:19] the Lord see how the farmer waits for
[1:34:20] the land to yield his valuable crop
[1:34:22] patiently waiting for the autum and
[1:34:24] spring rains you two be patient stand
[1:34:26] firm because the Lord's coming is near
[1:34:28] patience and prayer go together as James
[1:34:32] 5 wrote It's a posture that farmers
[1:34:34] understand farmers do a lot of waiting
[1:34:36] you won't find any overnight crops we
[1:34:38] have to wait for God to work in our
[1:34:41] lives if you can't wait you can't be
[1:34:43] patient patience is the key element of
[1:34:46] maturity amen as you're trying to help
[1:34:48] people grow spiritually and seeing these
[1:34:50] things you see these are the marks of
[1:34:52] maturity and there's many many many more
[1:34:54] that I don't have to talk about you
[1:34:56] should research it in your own Bibles to
[1:34:57] realize this part of the Holy Ghost this
[1:35:00] adoption part this maturity part of
[1:35:02] adoption is so crucial to look at in the
[1:35:05] scripture say God where are my
[1:35:09] immaturities burn them out of me Lord
[1:35:13] grow me m mature Christians
[1:35:20] are
[1:35:22] try if you're trying to help people grow
[1:35:25] spiritually don't fall victim to trap
[1:35:27] into the Trap of thinking people in your
[1:35:30] church that just know the scripture are
[1:35:32] the most mature instead of look how God
[1:35:35] is changing their
[1:35:37] character ask yourself how does this
[1:35:39] person handle problems is this person
[1:35:41] sensitive and respectful to other people
[1:35:42] does this person manage his or her mouth
[1:35:44] right is this person a troublemaker a
[1:35:47] peacemaker does this person pray without
[1:35:49] giving up make decisions too hasty waits
[1:35:53] for direction of their father does
[1:35:55] nothing except the father shows him
[1:35:57] that's Jesus son who come to that place
[1:36:01] I do nothing except my father shows me
[1:36:04] that's where we need to come we act so
[1:36:06] hastily without prayer with okay we're
[1:36:07] going to go with it sons of God sett
[1:36:10] down and said now wait a minute let's
[1:36:11] pray about this there are a few
[1:36:13] decisions in life you have to make a
[1:36:14] quick decision you just pray but if you
[1:36:17] can most of your decisions get counsel
[1:36:20] go to the word of God and be patient and
[1:36:23] wait for God to put the green lights to
[1:36:26] it or the red lights to it I'm getting
[1:36:28] married I'm getting married put it to
[1:36:30] prayer you should pray more earnestly
[1:36:32] than you've ever prayed God will give
[1:36:34] you little green lights as if if this is
[1:36:36] the one that you're supposed to marry or
[1:36:37] he'll give you red lights and then you
[1:36:39] have to be honest and say this isn't the
[1:36:40] will of
[1:36:42] God mature Christians are correctable
[1:36:44] and
[1:36:46] teachable mature sons are not arrogant
[1:36:49] about their position and know their
[1:36:50] power is in the word and in Christ not
[1:36:54] necessarily in
[1:36:56] themselves so they lead by that word in
[1:36:59] their lives not emotion intimidation
[1:37:01] threats or complaining not led by money
[1:37:04] not led by demanding obedience from
[1:37:06] other people controlling by sheer will
[1:37:08] or force it sounds like many of
[1:37:10] ministers sometimes controlling by force
[1:37:14] or controlling by opportunity or
[1:37:15] privilege or personality controlling by
[1:37:17] your personality it's all immaturities
[1:37:19] and I tell you wish I had time all these
[1:37:21] things we see sometimes even our own
[1:37:23] ranks leaders leading controlling by
[1:37:26] privilege or by personality or by
[1:37:28] abusing The Authority they have as a
[1:37:32] pastor if they have the authority as a
[1:37:34] pastor which they do but they have
[1:37:36] immaturity they won't lead properly
[1:37:39] because they'll Abus their Authority
[1:37:41] mature Sons know that they are
[1:37:44] completely dependent on God and nothing
[1:37:46] else mature sons are truly led by God's
[1:37:48] Will and not their own will or their
[1:37:50] feelings or their emotions or their
[1:37:52] family's emotions mature Sons know that
[1:37:55] suffering is to teach them something to
[1:37:57] bring more of God's glory in them and
[1:38:01] they take joy in it can you say Amen now
[1:38:04] this last quote says and I want to bring
[1:38:06] in one more thing and I'm closing here
[1:38:08] we wonder today what why the gifts and
[1:38:11] things are not in the church operating
[1:38:13] the way they should be why the gifts are
[1:38:15] put in the church to separate well
[1:38:17] excuse me the gifts are put in the
[1:38:19] church to separate to take sin out to
[1:38:20] keep the Church clean it's God's toxin
[1:38:23] that gives the church it's his
[1:38:24] disinfectant that he puts into the
[1:38:26] church to kill out the parasites that
[1:38:28] tear up the church and God sprays his
[1:38:31] church over with his word are you glad
[1:38:33] for the word and the nine spiritual
[1:38:35] gifts it's to keep the church clean
[1:38:39] right and that keeps all the termites
[1:38:42] out you know so the church can grow a
[1:38:43] plant and God knows what to take to do
[1:38:45] it you say see it's just a little baby
[1:38:47] crying for a Razor when you're shaving
[1:38:50] your little baby was hollering give me
[1:38:52] that razor Daddy give me that razor your
[1:38:54] little son two or three years old just
[1:38:56] screaming jumping up and down on the
[1:38:57] floor give me the
[1:38:59] razor well you know better than to do
[1:39:01] that well you wouldn't give that baby
[1:39:03] that razor he doesn't know how to handle
[1:39:06] it that's the reason we don't find more
[1:39:09] Divine gifts than what we
[1:39:12] do it's not be the gifts aren't there
[1:39:16] sometimes just because people are
[1:39:19] quenching the spirit or people are
[1:39:20] preing ing against them or that can be
[1:39:23] that can be but he's saying the reason
[1:39:26] we don't find more Divine gifts now how
[1:39:29] many would say as a Christian I want to
[1:39:30] be used by and available for any of the
[1:39:32] nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:39:34] church and you realize you're not born
[1:39:36] with those a prophet is born a prophet
[1:39:39] but the nine spiritual gifts it can fall
[1:39:40] on you one time and never be used on you
[1:39:42] again that's why he said Pentecost fail
[1:39:44] because he said we're going to get
[1:39:45] together and pray this person has this
[1:39:46] gift this person okay we want to use
[1:39:48] these gifts it may be you may be used
[1:39:50] one time and that's it
[1:39:52] so you don't make it across theboard
[1:39:53] thing and then you're constantly looking
[1:39:55] for oh this person has a gift of tongu
[1:39:57] so we're looking we're hoping they'll
[1:39:58] speaking tongues as service completely
[1:40:01] go to 1 Corinthians 14 friends none of
[1:40:03] that is is the right Church order at
[1:40:07] all but we want God's gifts working
[1:40:10] through us and we want to be filled with
[1:40:11] the spirit ready and available for all
[1:40:15] nine available if if whatever God wants
[1:40:18] to use us for so what we're here for by
[1:40:20] the way
[1:40:22] it's only 12:40 I
[1:40:25] know it's what we're here for on
[1:40:29] Earth to be used by the Holy Ghost to do
[1:40:34] whatever he wants to do through us to
[1:40:36] see someone come to the kingdom to see
[1:40:38] some with a word of wisdom to see some
[1:40:40] with a Word of Faith to lay our hands on
[1:40:42] somebody I said last Sunday you don't
[1:40:43] have to wait the preacher comes through
[1:40:44] town and have him lay hands on you in
[1:40:47] healing line you can have your brother
[1:40:48] and sister next to you lay hands on you
[1:40:50] you can have your wife lay hands on you
[1:40:52] you see this is the way the prophet
[1:40:53] pointed us it's mature Sons it's not
[1:40:55] looking to the big preachers it's saying
[1:40:57] all Sons come to maturity I have the
[1:40:59] power in the name of
[1:41:02] Jesus that's the reason we don't want to
[1:41:04] find no more Divine guess what we do
[1:41:06] they push it off on some kind of a
[1:41:08] tradition over in some denomination they
[1:41:09] don't know how to handle it God knows
[1:41:12] what to do with it well you might say
[1:41:15] the little boy might say to you you
[1:41:16] refused him the razor say I see you
[1:41:19] handling it Daddy but see your older you
[1:41:22] know what to do with it so the the son
[1:41:25] saying I see another person he's
[1:41:27] handling it Daddy you're handling it I
[1:41:29] want it I want it I want it but you you
[1:41:31] see you're older you know what to do
[1:41:33] with it our father knows what to hand
[1:41:35] out as far as power to his
[1:41:38] people I want him to trust me if he
[1:41:41] never uses me or if he uses me I'm
[1:41:44] available but I want him to trust me as
[1:41:46] a mature son that I'll handle that sword
[1:41:50] of the word
[1:41:52] correctly that I don't take the sword of
[1:41:54] this word and start
[1:41:56] slicing people up with it but slicing
[1:41:59] the devil that I as a preacher is not
[1:42:02] using the word to slice up other message
[1:42:05] churches God forgive us God forgive us
[1:42:09] using the word to slice up everybody
[1:42:11] else I thought and and pushing the
[1:42:14] people to become in this big frenzy to
[1:42:16] try to speak against other messes
[1:42:19] churches I didn't know we were going to
[1:42:20] come to that but listen friends that's
[1:42:22] immaturity the sword God gave us in this
[1:42:24] message is not to use on one another on
[1:42:27] other preachers it's to use on the devil
[1:42:30] if you don't want to rile people up and
[1:42:31] get them excited get them The Sword and
[1:42:33] the word and that Holy Ghost to come
[1:42:34] against our
[1:42:37] enemy not one another and that's the way
[1:42:40] when the church becomes from a little
[1:42:42] baby toddling around to a real virtue of
[1:42:45] Sons and Daughters of God then things
[1:42:49] are going to be different yes sir the
[1:42:52] church ought to be acting as Sons and
[1:42:57] Daughters the message is full of all
[1:42:59] three things I want it all don't you yes
[1:43:03] but I emphasize to you today that Paul
[1:43:05] said let's grow up into him in all
[1:43:07] things let's let's not be children that
[1:43:11] are tossed to and fro by every wind of
[1:43:13] Doctrine and tossed by this and maybe
[1:43:15] you're tossed by you're feeding too much
[1:43:17] on social media and you're tossed by it
[1:43:21] there are things that'll plant seeds in
[1:43:22] your mind in there just for a second
[1:43:24] plant the wrong seed in your mind be
[1:43:26] careful of that because you could be
[1:43:29] tossed as a child we don't want to be
[1:43:32] children but he says exercising
[1:43:35] discernment he says he that uses milk
[1:43:37] and the word is unskillful in the word
[1:43:39] of God but meat belongs to those who
[1:43:41] have their senses exercise to discern
[1:43:45] both good and evil that's a mature
[1:43:47] Christian not going to watch that
[1:43:49] because I've learned that tears me
[1:43:53] down that's there's only two Spirits in
[1:43:55] this world right that's from the Dark
[1:43:58] Side not going to feed on that that's a
[1:44:00] mature Christian say well teenagers
[1:44:03] can't oh yeah a teenager can come that
[1:44:04] kind of maturity that they're making
[1:44:06] their own choices I don't feed on that

[1:46:33] and even the grumpiness sometimes Lord I
[1:46:37] come

[1:46:41] that way Lord because we should be
[1:46:44] further along than that and you see that
[1:46:46] Lord but today we see the the image of
[1:46:50] the word in front of us the image of
[1:46:52] Christ in front of us we see where you
[1:46:54] lived out all the stages and you learned
[1:46:57] obedience by the things that's the one
[1:46:59] main thing you learn is how to be an
[1:47:02] obedient son how to follow the will of
[1:47:05] God how to not be motivated by just
[1:47:08] emotion or by what people wanted or what
[1:47:11] you wanted but you submitted your will
[1:47:13] to the heavenly father and Lord in that
[1:47:15] human experience that human part you
[1:47:18] lived out a life of
[1:47:20] Perfection and growing to Perfection and

[1:47:30] revealed we Sons and Daughters of God

[1:47:41] we come to you run to you say forgive me

[1:47:47] help me to grow out of that thing Lord
[1:47:49] we will always come to you or we
[1:47:52] should but Lord you mold us you give us
[1:47:56] the trials and the and the challenges
[1:47:59] Lord that we need to mold us into
