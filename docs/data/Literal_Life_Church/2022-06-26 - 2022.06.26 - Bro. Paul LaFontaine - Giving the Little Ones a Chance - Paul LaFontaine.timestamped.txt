[0:00] the little ones a chance
[0:04] deuteronomy chapter 1 and verse 35
[0:09] surely there shall not one of these men
[0:12] of this evil generation see that good
[0:15] land which i swear to give unto your
[0:17] fathers
[0:19] save caleb the
[0:20] save caleb the son of jephena
[0:24] he shall see it and to him will i give
[0:26] the land that he had trodden upon and to
[0:28] his children because
[0:30] he hath wholly followed the lord so
[0:33] catch what he's saying here that that
[0:36] god is saying through moses that none of
[0:38] that generation of the parents will go
[0:41] into the full promised land and he ex
[0:44] he'll explain it later but none of them
[0:46] will go in save caleb and his children
[0:49] and verse 38 but joshua the son of ma
[0:52] son of none he'll go in which standeth
[0:54] before me he shall go in thither
[0:56] encourage him for he shall cause israel
[1:00] to inherit so god says none of that
[1:02] generation will go into the promise but
[1:04] caleb and joshua verse 39
[1:08] moreover your little ones which ye
[1:11] said should be a prey
[1:13] and your children which in that day had
[1:15] no knowledge between good and evil they
[1:19] shall go in thither and unto them will i
[1:22] give it and they
[1:24] shall possess it
[1:26] i want to speak on giving the little
[1:28] ones a chance
[1:31] heavenly father bless your word bless
[1:34] the precious souls that have come to
[1:35] hear your word
[1:37] some here and some online and i pray
[1:39] you'll find them where they're at in
[1:41] their lives and minister to them lord
[1:43] because your word when it's spoken lord
[1:45] it's already been spoken by the prophets
[1:47] it's spoken today it's re-spoke again
[1:49] today through
[1:51] one of the members of the fifo ministry
[1:53] but lord when it is spoken it is so
[1:55] powerful that you said it will not
[1:57] return void it will bring a fruit from
[2:00] it so i pray it would go forth today
[2:03] with no agendas with nothing tainted
[2:05] nothing none of my motives in it lord
[2:07] just appear just the way that you said
[2:10] it and may you give revelation and
[2:12] strength to every person here every
[2:14] person here has a story every person
[2:17] here has a background they have
[2:19] something that they're comfort they've
[2:21] come from whether bad or good or
[2:23] whatever it is every person has their
[2:25] own story but lord how how wonderful
[2:29] when you interrupt that story and bring
[2:31] redemption into their story there's
[2:33] nothing lord that you can't redeem
[2:36] there's nothing lord that you can't
[2:38] restore and you're the one that says i
[2:40] will give you beauty for ashes you give
[2:43] me your ashes i'll give you beauty back
[2:46] and i'll give you the garment of praise
[2:49] for the spirit of heaviness these are
[2:51] the things in the trade that you give us
[2:53] lord we come and receive it this morning
[2:55] may your anointing come and speak
[2:57] through us we pray in jesus name we ask
[3:00] him amen amen once you shake somebody's
[3:02] hand before you're seated god bless you
[3:04] all in the name of the lord
[3:09] now the setting here this morning is of
[3:12] course god's prophet moses
[3:14] and he is
[3:16] saying to the people of god in
[3:18] deuteronomy that
[3:20] god is angry and he's expressing that to
[3:23] say i want to let you know that god is
[3:25] angry with something and what god was
[3:27] angry with was the the generation that
[3:31] didn't take a hold of god's promise they
[3:34] didn't want to go into god's full
[3:36] promise they they sell themselves
[3:38] shorter they complained and they said we
[3:40] can't go in even though it's been
[3:42] promised by god there's too many hurdles
[3:45] to it and so god over time in the
[3:47] wilderness became angry with this
[3:50] particular generation because they
[3:52] wouldn't go take the land they wouldn't
[3:54] take a hold of this thing they wouldn't
[3:56] take the promise and go take the promise
[3:58] that god had said this is your land and
[4:01] it doesn't matter the obstacles it
[4:03] doesn't matter what's in front of you
[4:05] i've promised it to you and so you can
[4:07] go take that land but we see there's a
[4:10] whole generation that's that that cut
[4:12] themselves short in other words they
[4:14] wouldn't take a hold of the whole thing
[4:16] they stayed in the wilderness and they
[4:18] they wouldn't go take the full promise
[4:20] god was actually uh grieved uh hebrews
[4:23] says i was grieved with that whole
[4:25] generation and i want you to remember
[4:27] this is the generation that's not out in
[4:29] the world or not in egypt this is the
[4:31] generation that come in under a prophet
[4:34] under a message and took them out of
[4:36] egypt and yet they stopped short of the
[4:39] full promise and god said i was grieved
[4:43] with that generation i was grieved with
[4:45] him and he still showed them miracles he
[4:48] still delivered them he still gave them
[4:50] water when they needed water he still
[4:52] gave them food when they needed food he
[4:54] performed many supernatural things but
[4:57] why was he grieved because the people
[4:59] that generation refused to go all the
[5:02] way into their promise
[5:05] and so now god says through the prophet
[5:07] god is angry and god's displeased with
[5:10] that generation because they didn't go
[5:12] in and catch this they even sent spies
[5:16] agents
[5:18] he had to be there yesterday
[5:20] they sent spies into the land to see if
[5:24] it was true what moses the prophet had
[5:26] said so catch this now everything moses
[5:28] said they sent spies in and they went
[5:31] and and they come back and they said
[5:32] they said it's all there the promise is
[5:35] there and here's the evidence they
[5:37] brought back evidence what the prophet
[5:39] said is true and here's the evidence of
[5:42] it
[5:43] and still with the evidence there was
[5:46] men that influenced these parents
[5:49] there was men that said yes it's there
[5:51] but we can't do it well why can't we do
[5:53] it because there's an enemy there's
[5:55] obstacles there's giants there's great
[5:57] walled cities and that intimidated them
[6:00] and so the parents became influenced by
[6:03] certain people on the internet that was
[6:06] bringing a bad rap on the promise
[6:10] i said the parents were influenced to
[6:13] hold them back from going completely
[6:15] into their land because somebody
[6:18] influenced him to say nobody can go that
[6:20] far we can't make it into that there's
[6:23] too many obstacles no person can live
[6:25] that way and so they made a decision
[6:28] actually our children are actually safer
[6:30] here in the wilderness
[6:35] because i i looked that up in numbers 14
[6:38] 3 because he says here he said you said
[6:40] that your children will be a prey if you
[6:42] go into the land your children the
[6:44] parents are saying if i go do that my
[6:46] children will be a prey to the enemy and
[6:49] so they said the children my children
[6:52] won't be safe and they i was wondering
[6:54] if they said that and of course if god
[6:55] said they said it they said i just had
[6:57] to find it and in numbers 14 3 numbers
[7:00] 14 3 this is what they said and
[7:02] wherefore hath the lord brought us into
[7:04] this land this is what the people were
[7:06] saying this generation wherefore hath
[7:07] the lord brought us into this land the
[7:10] wilderness to fall by the sword that our
[7:13] wives and our children should be a prey
[7:17] were it not better for us to return to
[7:21] egypt
[7:23] can you imagine the mentality and
[7:25] attitude that god supernaturally brought
[7:28] them out opened the red sea drowned
[7:31] pharaoh's army and now they're
[7:32] complaining and saying our children are
[7:34] not even going to be safe out here or in
[7:37] the promised land wouldn't it be better
[7:39] if we go back to egypt no wonder god was
[7:42] grieved with those people
[7:45] no wonder god was grieved that they
[7:48] would pass down this doubt to their
[7:50] children and say stay away from that
[7:53] that's not a good thing that's not a
[7:54] good influence and you'll be a prey if
[7:56] you get around that too much let's just
[7:58] stay right here and so they the parents
[8:00] were influenced by other people who put
[8:02] a doubt on god's message of the land i
[8:05] said the parents were influenced by
[8:07] other people who put a doubt on god's
[8:10] message of the promise
[8:14] the obstacles are too big we can't do it
[8:17] fear gripped their heart and they said
[8:18] we can't do it and if we do our children
[8:21] will be a prey they actually said in the
[8:22] wilderness it'd be better for us to go
[8:25] can you imagine parents saying that our
[8:27] children are safer and better off in
[8:30] egypt under pharaoh
[8:36] i'm going to preach it
[8:38] i had a whole subject last night and the
[8:40] lord completely changed i know this is
[8:41] what the lord said for me to say and i'm
[8:43] going to tell you how how can how can
[8:46] message believers under moses message
[8:49] make a decision about their children to
[8:51] actually say our children were actually
[8:54] safer back in egypt under pharaoh what
[8:57] what a mentality that's a
[9:00] mentality that's a lie of the enemy that
[9:03] your children are safer back in egypt
[9:07] that's one of the greatest lies your
[9:09] children the safest place for your
[9:11] children is under the promise of the
[9:14] hour sent through a prophet
[9:15] [Applause]
[9:20] can you imagine parents saying that and
[9:21] following this prophet moses
[9:24] we're safer back in egypt and then
[9:26] following this prophet moses on some
[9:28] wild goose chase out here in the
[9:30] wilderness
[9:31] following this prophet we don't even
[9:33] know where we're going here we don't
[9:34] know if the land is there this is before
[9:36] they had evidence this we're just on a
[9:38] wild goose chase with and then then we
[9:40] got all these laws and rules that came
[9:42] from the mountain and every every time i
[9:45] turn around there's another commandment
[9:46] and there's another precept and it's pat
[9:48] and this and moses message was packed
[9:51] he's packed us with all kinds of laws
[9:53] how to live and even what to wear
[9:59] all this holiness from moses is legalism
[10:04] we were better in egypt were you
[10:08] if you label all of holiness legalism
[10:10] you're greatly deceived because when god
[10:14] brings true holiness first of all in the
[10:16] soul in the spirit and then on maybe on
[10:18] the outside god never brings it to make
[10:21] you a legalist god brings it for
[10:24] protection for safety for for gender
[10:27] separation can you say amen
[10:29] god knows human beings because he
[10:31] created human beings and when he brings
[10:34] a precept it's for our good and it's for
[10:37] our children's good
[10:41] i ought to be getting some greater amens
[10:43] than that
[10:46] it was a lie because their families were
[10:47] safer out in the wilderness
[10:49] with the pillar of fire by night and a
[10:52] cloud over them
[10:54] by a cloud by a day and a pillar of fire
[10:56] by night they were safer much safer even
[10:59] with the enemy fighting them against
[11:01] them
[11:02] fighting against them they were safer
[11:05] in the wilderness and safer in the
[11:06] promised land
[11:08] under a pillar of fire
[11:12] even in goshen just the outskirts of
[11:14] egypt
[11:15] when the death angel came
[11:17] they were safer there with the token
[11:19] applied to their home
[11:21] and he said that death angel won't
[11:23] strike your kid your firstborn if you've
[11:25] got the token the safest place for your
[11:28] children is under god's word
[11:32] now i'm preaching to parents first here
[11:34] but i'm going to get to real quickly
[11:36] that god has grace for the little ones
[11:40] and when the parents won't get a hold of
[11:41] this
[11:43] god says i'm gonna grace give grace and
[11:45] i'm gonna give a chance to the little
[11:47] ones can i get an amen this morning when
[11:50] parents mess it up and don't think i'm
[11:51] just preaching and beating up your
[11:53] parents this morning because remember
[11:54] there was a joshua there was a caleb of
[11:57] the older generation that went into the
[11:58] promise as well
[12:00] most of the parents just stayed in the
[12:02] wilderness but there were some parents
[12:04] there that said i want my mountain i
[12:06] want my land i'm taking me and my
[12:08] children into it i'm not afraid of this
[12:12] somebody's saying man this morning
[12:14] that's exactly the place that my
[12:16] children need to be is in the promise of
[12:18] the holy ghost and i'm going to keep
[12:20] them in the right environment i'm going
[12:22] to keep them in church i'm going to keep
[12:24] them around good fellowship and i'm
[12:25] going to pray them through to the
[12:27] promise which is the holy ghost because
[12:29] the promise is for me but it's not just
[12:32] for me it's for my children it's to a
[12:34] media far off even as many as the lord
[12:37] our god shall call
[12:40] amen
[12:43] so when these parents listened to other
[12:44] voices of doubt on the internet they
[12:46] said we're not going all the way in
[12:47] we're staying here in the borderline
[12:49] borderline believers borderline
[12:50] lifestyle we can't go back all the way
[12:52] to egypt now but we can stay here and
[12:55] they would not fully repent and take a
[12:57] full hold on the promise and that
[12:59] angered god and he said none of that
[13:01] generation will go in except
[13:03] except caleb joshua and another group
[13:07] your little ones your little ones your
[13:08] children i will give the little ones a
[13:12] chance at my word
[13:14] god's grace said
[13:16] i'm gonna give the little ones a chance
[13:18] now this is amazing because you know
[13:21] that there is a precept that moses said
[13:24] several times that the iniquities of the
[13:27] fathers would be visited upon the
[13:30] children unto the second and third
[13:31] generation how many reasons they hadn't
[13:32] heard that precept the iniquities of the
[13:35] father so there is a trickle-down effect
[13:37] of what you do as parents if if you
[13:39] don't get deliverance if you don't
[13:41] overcome things it'll trickle down to
[13:43] further generations
[13:45] oh yeah
[13:46] god said it can you say amen so the
[13:48] iniquities of the fathers will be
[13:50] visited upon the children until the
[13:52] third and fourth generation so even with
[13:55] that principle that's there god still
[13:57] says i will steal even though that's
[14:00] there i will still give grace to the
[14:02] little ones i'll give them a chance at a
[14:05] revival i'll give them a chance of the
[14:07] promise
[14:08] it doesn't matter that the parents are
[14:11] toxic parents
[14:14] it doesn't matter that the parents are
[14:16] borderline believers
[14:19] i'm going to give them a chance to break
[14:22] the curse
[14:24] [Applause]
[14:25] and you know you sit here and say well
[14:26] i'm not a i'm not a dysfunctional parent
[14:29] we're all dysfunctional people because
[14:32] our parents adam and eve were
[14:33] dysfunctional
[14:35] come on now
[14:37] our parents adam and eve were
[14:38] dysfunctional toxic parents
[14:41] and we're children all that we inherited
[14:44] the the nature of the serpent because of
[14:46] our parents adam and eve falling
[14:48] everybody one of us inherited that no
[14:50] matter no wonder we get into trouble can
[14:52] you say that and so so so like as i said
[14:55] i'm not belittling this morning i'm just
[14:57] saying god says if the parents mess up
[15:01] i'm going to give grace to the little
[15:03] ones to have a chance to take the
[15:05] promise themselves and we see it today
[15:08] in many cases where a child or teenager
[15:10] rises up and said listen my my parents
[15:13] only went so far and that's fine that's
[15:15] between them and god but i'm gonna take
[15:17] a hold of this promise i'm gonna take a
[15:19] hold of this word god fill me with your
[15:21] spirit i'm gonna take a hold of this
[15:23] word
[15:24] the people are putting it down the
[15:26] people are putting motorists down
[15:27] there's all kinds of internet sites
[15:29] about it they're calling it this that
[15:31] and the other but listen god spoke
[15:33] through this man god is above us in a
[15:35] purifier god has been in a pillar of
[15:38] cloud and so god is in this and i'm
[15:41] going to take a hold of it for myself
[15:47] praise the lord
[15:49] none of that generations of parents will
[15:51] go in but the little ones will
[15:54] and i was inspired by this by sister
[15:55] cher and my sister
[15:57] as she shared this to her volunteers a
[15:59] couple nights ago
[16:01] that part of her vision and she said god
[16:03] said that the parents would not go in
[16:05] but i'm going to leave a promise for the
[16:06] kids i'm going to promise them i'm gonna
[16:08] give them a chance sharon mentioned it
[16:10] and it just triggered me first of all i
[16:12] was saying
[16:13] i need to go check that out i need to
[16:14] check her out see if that's in there
[16:17] and i did and it was
[16:19] and i read it to you this morning
[16:22] god said
[16:24] that generation
[16:25] that just confused things
[16:30] that generation has all the stuff and
[16:32] trust me you know me as a pastor i could
[16:34] take the next hour and show the
[16:36] the the the complication and the
[16:40] the lack of simplicity and to and the
[16:42] trouble and the bitterness
[16:46] that's in parents today
[16:48] and what the shame is is they pass that
[16:50] down to their children to carry on and
[16:52] i'm going to say to you clearly this
[16:54] morning that's not fair to do that they
[16:56] deserve a pure chance at this message
[16:59] they deserve a trust in the preachers a
[17:02] trust in the right men of god there's
[17:04] wrong men of god there's right men of
[17:06] god and your children my dad used to say
[17:08] it this way be careful what you say
[17:09] against the preachers because he said
[17:11] when you're not able to help your kid
[17:13] someday
[17:14] someday that minister may be able to
[17:16] help your kid
[17:17] and if you put them down then you lose a
[17:20] chance for them to be able to minister
[17:21] when you can't minister to them
[17:28] the kids are going to rise up i'm going
[17:30] to give them grace i'm going to give
[17:31] them a chance they can break this curse
[17:33] handed down by their parents i'm going
[17:35] to give them the promise a chance at the
[17:36] promise none of that generation and
[17:38] parents will go in but the little ones i
[17:40] will i will give them and god said the
[17:41] parents would not go in but i'm leaving
[17:43] a promise if god i'm moving along now if
[17:45] god gives them a chance listen if god
[17:48] gives them a chance i think we should
[17:50] give them a chance
[17:52] can i get it amen
[17:53] if god gives them a chance despite
[17:56] what's happened in the past i think we
[17:58] should give them a chance
[18:01] i think we should give them a fresh
[18:03] start
[18:04] untainted
[18:07] not mixed with anything
[18:10] you come from things that were mixed up
[18:12] and diluted
[18:14] i think the kids deserve a better chance
[18:16] to take a look at it
[18:18] and a chance specifically
[18:20] at receiving christ
[18:26] a fresh start
[18:27] to not carry on with all the bitterness
[18:29] from the past and carry on the same
[18:30] grudges
[18:32] i don't think it's fair to pass our to
[18:35] pass our past ju
[18:37] our past
[18:39] grudges onto our children
[18:50] i don't think it's right
[18:51] to pass
[18:53] pass our past judgments and grudges
[18:56] to our children
[18:58] there's an andy griffith
[19:01] episode that i like
[19:03] and
[19:05] it's an episode where there's two
[19:08] families from generations feuding with
[19:10] each other
[19:11] it's not called the hatfields and mccoy
[19:12] we know that was a real feud that took
[19:14] place somewhere in west virginia but
[19:15] this was the names were different i
[19:17] don't remember the names but these two
[19:19] families are fighting for generation
[19:20] after generation you know in north
[19:22] carolina and so they're going back and
[19:24] forth so so then
[19:26] uh two young people wanted to get
[19:27] married from both sides
[19:30] and i love this episode because annie
[19:33] griffith starts to get into it he's
[19:34] going to marry him they show up with
[19:36] guns at one another pointing guns at one
[19:37] another this ain't gonna happen we've
[19:39] never married that other family we're
[19:41] staying this is a tradition carried on
[19:43] this is a feud and they were expecting
[19:45] their children and the next generation
[19:47] to carry on the same feud from all the
[19:49] generations back
[19:54] and so
[19:55] andy uh the sheriff he researches it and
[19:58] goes back into the history books
[20:00] found some things out and he talks the
[20:02] heads of these two families and brings
[20:04] them together and he says i've done some
[20:06] research
[20:07] and come to find out in all the years of
[20:09] the threats between these families
[20:11] nobody's ever taken a shot and killed
[20:13] another one
[20:15] but there's a lot of threats i'm going
[20:17] to kill them i'm going to get rid of
[20:18] they're holding their guns at one
[20:20] another i'm going to take a
[20:21] anybody here that's offended at me
[20:23] bringing up andy griffith
[20:28] give me grace please
[20:30] just write it off as my
[20:32] problem
[20:35] it's just to bring a point
[20:37] and a point that should be received
[20:39] because
[20:40] boy do we ever get feuds
[20:43] between families
[20:47] and threats but the worst part of it is
[20:49] you pass your feud onto your children
[20:54] that's why i've always said about young
[20:55] people i like them because they can get
[20:56] together and sometimes parents can't
[20:58] come together in a meeting because
[20:59] they're different beliefs and all these
[21:00] other things i'm not going to meet i'm
[21:02] not going to do that but the young
[21:03] people they can get together because
[21:05] they don't have all those pa that
[21:06] history can you say man they can get
[21:07] together and worship and accept one
[21:09] another and get a hold of god i like
[21:11] that about the young people
[21:13] i don't know what happened to you 20
[21:14] years ago but i'm gonna go fellowship
[21:16] and enjoy the word of god i can be with
[21:18] those people i can handle those people i
[21:20] can pray with those people sometimes
[21:22] brotherly love shows up more in the
[21:24] young people
[21:29] and so we find they were fighting and so
[21:31] he says listen guys there's no history
[21:34] of anybody actually taking out this is
[21:36] that true no that can't be true and so
[21:37] he said we're going to settle this
[21:38] forever we're going to have you guys
[21:40] walk away from one another with your
[21:42] guns and you're going to turn around
[21:44] you're going to shoot and you're going
[21:45] to we're going to get a shooting because
[21:46] you always talk about there's going to
[21:48] be a shoot and there's going to be a
[21:48] shooting i'm going to shoot that a
[21:50] hatfield i'm going to shoot them and
[21:52] also all of a sudden so they get in line
[21:53] and they go and they keep stopping them
[21:55] no we've got to stop but oh we got to
[21:56] stopped to keep stopping they didn't
[21:58] want to do it
[21:59] they couldn't follow through with their
[22:01] threats
[22:03] so to make a long andy griffith shore
[22:05] story short
[22:09] and he finally convinces them
[22:11] that if these two get married
[22:13] your offspring
[22:15] is actually going to be stronger
[22:17] with the two strong families you're
[22:20] really going to bring up a generation
[22:23] and they were sold
[22:25] and they showed up at the wedding
[22:27] and the feud was over
[22:29] why because they were looking at the
[22:31] future instead of the feud of the past
[22:35] [Applause]
[22:44] i'd like to make some points here and
[22:46] i'm not going to be long today i know
[22:47] we're tired from the last two days
[22:50] i'd like to make some points here of the
[22:52] events this week that just come to me
[22:54] last night
[22:55] last sunday we dedicated
[22:57] another baby precious little boy
[23:01] for kyle and laura
[23:03] thursday
[23:05] we had
[23:06] a law that's been in for 50 years
[23:09] reversed at least in the supreme court
[23:12] roe versus wade the abortion law
[23:15] after 50 years that happened thursday
[23:18] right on the very week this week when we
[23:20] would focus on our children
[23:26] that we would fight for our children
[23:28] that we would give them a chance that
[23:30] we'd take three or four days
[23:32] and focus off of one another and focus
[23:35] just on the children and i want to say
[23:36] thanks again for those who labored our
[23:39] ministers i've done it before when
[23:40] you're ministering four or five times of
[23:42] the same subject for two days it can
[23:44] wear you out to those children
[23:45] especially the little ones who don't
[23:47] have a great attention span
[23:49] but our ministers did great and i i want
[23:51] to give them a hand this morning for
[23:52] ministering to the children the bible
[23:54] basics
[23:55] amen
[24:02] but we're giving the little ones a
[24:03] chance and we had the in the same week
[24:05] after 50 years the abortion laws of roe
[24:08] versus wade gets overturned by the
[24:10] supreme court it's an amazing thing now
[24:12] it's a victory to many people it's a
[24:14] victory and i'll call it that this
[24:15] morning it's a victory it's something to
[24:16] rejoice so rejoice over can you say amen
[24:20] many forces have been worked at work for
[24:22] a long time the right to life many
[24:25] forces have been working for almost 50
[24:26] years since the law came in to work
[24:28] against it it's a real victory for them
[24:30] they've worked hard to get this thing
[24:32] reversed and and i'm not supposed to be
[24:35] political here uh in case you're
[24:37] listening to this i'm not doing that i
[24:38] want to bring out the biblical point and
[24:39] show us that that when something is
[24:42] wrong especially for children
[24:45] i wouldn't call it a victory as much as
[24:47] i'd call it a rise of a fight to fight
[24:50] back
[24:53] and every once in a while we have a
[24:55] light in this country
[24:56] that rises up and begins to fight back
[24:59] when satan is so
[25:01] blatantly diablo is so blatantly
[25:07] trying to influence our children
[25:09] and dilute
[25:11] the formula
[25:22] the kids and everybody should know
[25:24] jaden is just playing that part
[25:27] he played it pretty well
[25:36] but to make it clear
[25:38] he's not diablo he's a brother
[25:40] and he believes in christ
[25:43] but
[25:45] the abortion laws and so
[25:47] so i want to say it's it's i don't i'm
[25:49] not calling it a full victory because we
[25:51] know scripturally
[25:53] the the the iniquity will heap up more
[25:55] and more
[25:56] and we still have it coming back to the
[25:58] states and and different states will
[26:00] decide different things but we we find
[26:02] that we'll call it a victory but it's
[26:04] more of a fight i don't think it's an
[26:06] ultimate victory as you know uh it it
[26:09] it's not an ultimate victory until you
[26:10] change hearts
[26:12] by the lord
[26:14] you're not gonna change anything until
[26:16] people's hearts are changed by the holy
[26:17] spirit
[26:19] and if you're listening here today on uh
[26:21] on the broadcast or anyone who's
[26:23] listening i just tell you you're not
[26:25] going to solve the problems of this
[26:26] nation it's almost too late as a nation
[26:29] the way that you can solve is the
[26:31] individuals getting the true genuine
[26:34] birth of the holy ghost in their lives
[26:36] and that's what changes the problems in
[26:39] our nation
[26:42] and so we see then that that i think
[26:44] it's a a an amazing thing to see that it
[26:47] changed and i see that victory take
[26:49] place but you're not going to have a
[26:50] full victory until you have the holy
[26:51] holy spirit in people's lives i would
[26:54] not call it a victory as much as i call
[26:55] it as fighting back a spirit in people
[26:58] to rise up and to fight back at the wave
[27:01] of sin in our country especially
[27:03] concerning our children there's a fight
[27:05] back from parents when they realize just
[27:08] through covet they realize what their
[27:10] children are being taught in the schools
[27:12] they weren't looking close enough and
[27:14] they're many of them were being
[27:16] surprised pulling their kids out of
[27:17] schools because they realize what are
[27:19] they doing to our children they're
[27:21] taking away our rights as parents
[27:22] they're influencing to transgender and
[27:24] all these other things they're trying to
[27:27] take our children's minds and there's a
[27:29] little light that rises up in paris to
[27:31] fight
[27:32] back
[27:34] and if that's happened on a little level
[27:36] around our country
[27:38] may god rise in the parents hearts today
[27:40] to fight back at the enemy coming
[27:43] against our kids
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:46] whatever it is that's happening then may
[27:48] parents rise to the occasion today to
[27:51] fight back at the enemy
[27:57] there's a fight back when they see
[27:59] what's being taught and the control the
[28:01] government has taken over our little
[28:03] ones
[28:04] four years old teaching their gender
[28:06] confusion teaching gender confusion
[28:09] disney movies
[28:11] that blatantly blatantly
[28:14] have same-sex same-sex couples
[28:18] there's a reaction to it
[28:20] and whenever there is
[28:21] a strong reaction
[28:23] i say thank god
[28:25] there's still some that have some
[28:26] discernment in this country there's
[28:28] still some little light shining
[28:31] i know this as a nation i know all the
[28:33] prophecies i know where it's going
[28:35] there's not going to be a national
[28:37] revival if some preacher tells you that
[28:39] it's not true it's not in in the bible
[28:41] for it to be a national revival the next
[28:43] revival is to israel god's people israel
[28:46] but there can be individual revivals and
[28:48] little little lights rise up and say i'm
[28:51] gonna fight back
[28:53] i'm gonna stand for my kids
[28:57] can i get an amen this morning
[29:02] 60 million abortions
[29:04] of babies since that law was passed
[29:08] 60 million
[29:10] and don't be offended
[29:12] if you're listening but i'm going to say
[29:14] this
[29:15] that's
[29:16] you could you could call it american
[29:18] style
[29:19] genocide
[29:24] as franklin graham called it
[29:27] i know some people will be offended at
[29:29] that that's listening but listen
[29:31] it's it's it's
[29:33] you have to call something what it is
[29:36] 60 million
[29:39] and if you study the generation that
[29:41] that pushed to pass that law back at
[29:43] that time
[29:44] it was a rebellious generation to the
[29:47] word
[29:48] people were rising up and bucking up
[29:50] against authority and buckingham gumps
[29:52] against government authority and bucking
[29:54] up against
[29:55] especially god's authority and his word
[29:58] and everything that was normal for years
[30:00] in his word it was a rebellious
[30:02] generation and the beatles outwardly
[30:04] through their songs and through the
[30:06] manner and the way they acted reflected
[30:08] that rebellion
[30:10] many rock groups but the beatles in
[30:12] particular don't be offended i'm
[30:13] speaking against the beatles but i'm
[30:15] trying to tell you the truth by by
[30:17] articles that were written they were the
[30:19] they were they were the front image of
[30:22] entire change in that generation being
[30:24] rebellious to the word of god
[30:28] and that was the generation that passed
[30:30] the law that now
[30:31] killed
[30:32] 60 million
[30:35] babies
[30:40] but praise god
[30:43] praise god
[30:44] there's a fighting back
[30:47] thank god for some light
[30:49] that's left
[30:51] to fight for the little ones
[30:53] the unborn
[30:55] but don't just fight for the unborn
[30:57] fight for the born
[31:00] fight for our children
[31:03] one thing for sure
[31:05] god is behind it because he can only
[31:08] take so much of satan killing the little
[31:10] ones god throughout the bible can only
[31:13] handle so much when satan takes the
[31:15] little ones there'll be other ones
[31:17] destroyed but when he tampers too much
[31:20] with the little ones and the children
[31:22] god rises up
[31:24] if the parents won't do it god rises up
[31:28] can you say amen not just as a nation
[31:31] but if that child has been abused or
[31:33] that child has come under the wrong
[31:34] thing god finally says that's enough i'm
[31:37] going to deal directly with that heart
[31:39] and i've watched young people come from
[31:41] terrible backgrounds and god connects
[31:44] with their heart and says i love you you
[31:47] can have a different life i've actually
[31:49] said it to him you've got to get past
[31:50] the past because god has a different
[31:52] blueprint for your life
[31:57] got a boy in this assembly that was left
[31:59] at four or five years old left on the
[32:01] street corner never seen his parents
[32:03] just left him there someone picked it up
[32:05] raised him in the admonition of the lord
[32:06] why because god said i won't leave that
[32:09] child alone i'll pick him up
[32:13] and now he's here today serving the lord
[32:16] i don't want to embarrass him but i'll
[32:18] tell you i watch this all the time if
[32:20] the parents won't do it god will get a
[32:22] hold of the heart of that child can you
[32:24] say amen
[32:26] and where we messed up because if you're
[32:27] an honest parent we're not all perfect
[32:29] parents
[32:31] we mess up
[32:32] we have to apologize to our kids
[32:36] there's only one perfect parent and
[32:38] that's god
[32:39] our father can you say amen but when we
[32:42] mess up
[32:43] we apologize but with all of our
[32:45] mess-ups god says
[32:47] i will deal with that child
[32:51] because he cares for the little ones
[32:53] anybody here in my message today
[32:57] my scripture for last sunday for the
[32:58] dedication was psalm 78
[33:01] give your all my people to my law
[33:03] include incline your ears and i'm just
[33:04] about ready to close here in a minute
[33:06] give your o my people to my law incline
[33:08] your ears to the words of my mouth i
[33:09] will open my mouth in a parable i will
[33:11] utter dark sayings of old which we will
[33:13] hurt we have heard and known and our
[33:15] fathers have told us we will not hide
[33:17] them from their children showing to the
[33:20] generation to come the praises of the
[33:22] lord and his strength and his wonderful
[33:24] works that he hath done we're not going
[33:27] to hide that from our kids
[33:29] we're not going to give a bad impression
[33:32] can you say amen of the church of church
[33:34] people we're not going to do that
[33:37] we're going to declare god's strength
[33:39] we're going to declare the positive
[33:41] we're going to declare the wonderful
[33:42] works that god has done
[33:45] for he has established a testimony in
[33:47] jacob and appointed a law in israel
[33:49] which he commanded our fathers that they
[33:51] should make them known to their children
[33:53] they should make them known to their
[33:54] children that the generation to come
[33:57] might know them even the children which
[33:59] should be born who shall arise and
[34:02] declare them to their children that they
[34:05] might set their hope in god
[34:09] not forget the works of god but keep his
[34:11] commandments
[34:12] and might not be as their fathers a
[34:15] stubborn
[34:17] and rebellious generation
[34:21] i didn't read that
[34:22] last sunday in the dedication
[34:26] didn't really fit in a nice
[34:28] pleasant dedication but i'm reading it
[34:31] this sunday
[34:33] that are that these children that have a
[34:35] chance at the word might not be as their
[34:38] fathers stubborn
[34:40] rebellious
[34:42] a generation that set not their heart or
[34:44] right and whose spirit was not steadfast
[34:47] with god an inconsistent spirit one week
[34:51] they're in church the next week they're
[34:52] out one week they've got this priority
[34:54] next week that they're not steadfast in
[34:57] the word
[34:58] so god says i'm going to give the new
[35:00] generation a chance i'm giving the
[35:02] little ones a chance
[35:04] that they won't be as their fathers
[35:06] stubborn
[35:10] god's going to give the new generation a
[35:12] chance despite the rebellion of the
[35:14] parents that's what that scripture says
[35:16] there's another reference as i bring it
[35:18] down to a close and i know i promised
[35:19] that but i really truly am i've just got
[35:21] another couple quotes here here's
[35:23] another reference to the little ones and
[35:25] it's in the new testament and matthew 18
[35:28] says this is jesus talking at the same
[35:30] time came the disciples unto jesus
[35:32] saying who is the greatest in the
[35:33] kingdom of heaven and jesus called a
[35:35] little child unto them and set the child
[35:37] in the midst of them and said verily i
[35:39] send you except to be converted and
[35:41] become as little children ye shall not
[35:44] enter into the kingdom of heaven
[35:47] whosoever there shall therefore shall
[35:49] humble himself as this little child the
[35:52] same is the greatest in the kingdom of
[35:54] heaven and whosoever oh my what a
[35:56] message jesus is sending us here
[35:59] when we become so intellectual that we
[36:02] talk ourselves right out of the message
[36:04] of the hour
[36:07] a lot of you said he amended the first
[36:08] statement but you didn't say amen to the
[36:10] second thing we complicate it
[36:14] we complicate it
[36:16] and jesus said unless you get to the
[36:18] place you receive it like this little
[36:19] child who doesn't know anything doesn't
[36:21] know good and evil but they know enough
[36:22] know that's god he's being real to me
[36:25] i'll just accept it
[36:27] my heart just accepts it
[36:29] i have no walls up to it i have no
[36:33] mental filter that i'm bringing it all
[36:36] through
[36:37] just receive it
[36:40] those of you sitting here this morning i
[36:42] appeal to you in the name of the lord
[36:44] that if you got too complicated that you
[36:46] reach your hand to the lord and say god
[36:48] take all the complicated
[36:50] things out of my mind and thinking
[36:53] let me come back again as a little child
[36:56] and restart
[36:58] give me another chance to relearn
[37:01] about christ
[37:07] whosoever shall humble himself as this
[37:09] little child the same as greatest in the
[37:10] kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall
[37:12] receive one such little child in my name
[37:15] receiveth me but whosoever shall offend
[37:18] one of these little ones which believe
[37:20] in me it were better for him that a
[37:22] milestone millstone was hanged about his
[37:24] neck and that he were drowned in the
[37:26] depth of the sea that's pretty serious
[37:28] and it's saying that you can't hurt a
[37:31] child of god without hurting god
[37:37] you can't wrongly influence a child
[37:40] and not and god not get angry about it
[37:46] who sort of offends one of these
[37:48] innocent
[37:49] little ones
[37:50] and directs them you say
[37:52] well what does the word there offend me
[37:56] i'm glad you asked
[37:59] it means in the greek
[38:02] scandaliso
[38:06] and it means to put a stumbling block or
[38:09] impediment in the way upon which another
[38:11] may trip and fall
[38:15] to entice to sin
[38:19] there's actually parents that are that
[38:21] are
[38:22] teaching their children whether verbally
[38:24] or by their lifestyle
[38:26] to dabble in sinful things
[38:30] god doesn't like that because you're
[38:32] offending a little one
[38:36] it also means to cause i want you to
[38:38] listen close now to cause a person to
[38:40] begin to distrust and desert one
[38:45] whom he ought to trust
[38:47] and obey
[38:49] so here's the person in their life they
[38:51] should be trusting them listen our kids
[38:54] cannot trust that many things in life
[38:56] matter of fact there's almost nothing
[38:57] they can trust you can't trust
[39:00] government you can't trust the schools
[39:02] you can't trust some of the leaders in
[39:03] the schools there's hardly anything left
[39:06] to trust
[39:09] and trust is everything because you
[39:11] can't have confidence in someone to come
[39:13] forward with christ unless there's trust
[39:16] there's hardly any trust left in this
[39:18] world
[39:19] please don't take the one that they're
[39:21] supposed to trust and cast doubt on them
[39:24] is anybody listening this morning that's
[39:27] offending a little one is that someone
[39:29] they're supposed to trust someone
[39:31] they're supposed to uh to to obey
[39:34] to cause to fall away from that person
[39:37] and cause a person to distrust and
[39:39] desert one whom they ought to trust and
[39:42] obey goes on to say to be offended in
[39:44] one in essence to see in another what i
[39:47] disapprove of and what hinders me from
[39:49] acknowledging his authority to cause one
[39:52] to judge unfavorably or unjustly of
[39:55] another
[39:57] since one who stumbles or whose foot
[39:59] gets entangled feels annoyed to cause
[40:02] one displeasure at a thing to make in
[40:05] indignant to make the little one in
[40:07] indignant
[40:09] make them displeased
[40:11] you pass that down to them
[40:14] there's a lot of not a lot of things we
[40:16] can trust
[40:19] and i've said this before and it fits
[40:21] here i guess
[40:25] i'm not your enemy
[40:29] so don't make me the enemy
[40:33] i'm on your side
[40:36] i'm your friend there's not too many
[40:38] there's a lot of things that's your
[40:39] enemy in this world but don't make
[40:41] true men of god and the true body of
[40:43] christ don't make them the enemy
[40:47] to your children
[40:50] give them a chance to trust
[40:54] even though
[40:55] there's a lot of mistrust there's a lot
[40:57] of hurt there's a lot of people say
[40:59] stupid things sometimes
[41:02] but you teach your children that's the
[41:04] reality of life but don't cause them to
[41:07] have a wall up
[41:09] towards the true body of christ and to
[41:11] the true ministers
[41:13] and yet you can be friends with
[41:15] everybody else
[41:19] i didn't expect to be this specific
[41:21] today
[41:22] but i love you
[41:24] and i'm making a call to the parents
[41:27] let's give the little ones a fresh
[41:30] chance
[41:39] god does not feel too good about when
[41:41] the little ones don't have a chance they
[41:43] want they need a fresh start a fresh
[41:44] chance at the message of christ not
[41:46] brought through your filter of trash
[41:48] that you've seen in the church or hurt
[41:50] by leaders
[41:51] why talk about that in front of them
[41:55] why talk about the negative in front of
[41:57] them and pass down and offend one of
[41:59] these little ones
[42:01] keep it to yourself
[42:03] and now i'll take it further
[42:07] besides keeping it to yourself
[42:15] let brotherly love continue amen
[42:18] amen
[42:28] you got something between somebody
[42:30] go today and make it right
[42:33] get the air clear
[42:36] let brotherly love continue because they
[42:38] don't have it out there
[42:41] brother brahms said the only place true
[42:44] genuine victory and divine love love
[42:46] will be left is amongst the elect and
[42:48] that doesn't mean a message church it
[42:50] means the real elected people the only
[42:52] place genuine love would be left is
[42:54] among those people
[42:57] so i say let brotherly love continue
[43:03] got something to to clear the ear go do
[43:05] it go do that's a better example to our
[43:07] kids
[43:08] than holding a grudge for 10 years
[43:12] that brotherly love continued god dealt
[43:14] with me very deeply monday night
[43:18] about the antichrist spirit
[43:23] and i held it back but i want to speak
[43:25] on it
[43:26] because there's a there's a bit of a
[43:28] deception to say we always think the
[43:30] antichrist spirit
[43:32] it's out there it's in other churches
[43:35] the antichrist is going to be incarnate
[43:38] in this and we know all these truths and
[43:40] it's out there it's never here and i'm
[43:42] here to tell you
[43:44] it's among us
[43:49] trying to divide
[43:51] the brotherhood amen and how many would
[43:54] raise your hand and say i want that
[43:56] victory in capstone love i want my life
[43:58] to be capped with love thank you
[44:01] but the capstone only fits perfectly
[44:05] on brotherly kindness
[44:09] so if you want it how bad do you want it
[44:11] you can't skip a step because the
[44:13] capstone won't fit if you're missing
[44:15] brotherly kindness
[44:23] it only perfectly fits on something
[44:25] simply called brotherly kindness
[44:28] let
[44:29] brotherly love
[44:31] continue
[44:32] why is he saying that why is john i'm in
[44:34] the first second third book of john you
[44:36] can read it this week and get ready
[44:38] he's the only one that brings up the
[44:39] antichrist the term antichrist john
[44:41] john
[44:42] jude revelations the last three books of
[44:44] the bible deal with the antichrist
[44:45] spirit and their prophecies for us who
[44:47] would live amongst the antichrist spirit
[44:49] so we know what it is john draws a
[44:51] dividing line but why is he saying love
[44:53] one another his answer to the antichrist
[44:55] spirit is genuine a victory in genuine
[44:57] love
[45:00] fight against it fighting grandson
[45:01] antichrist spirit what do we fight
[45:03] against we don't fight carnality with
[45:05] carnality we don't fight fire with fire
[45:09] we don't fight it with an arrogant
[45:10] spirit
[45:11] john said we fight it with the real
[45:14] genuine victory in divine love that's
[45:17] how we fight the antichrist spirit
[45:20] i didn't expect to say that today but
[45:22] you can read it he keeps talking about
[45:24] love let brother love continue why does
[45:26] he have to say that because in our age
[45:27] it's going to be a fight it's going to
[45:29] be a fight to keep brotherly love
[45:31] continuing
[45:33] god's go god's going to be there but
[45:34] satan's going to be right there working
[45:36] in between us trying to divide us
[45:39] listen
[45:40] i'm closing there is a promise
[45:43] there is a promise
[45:45] if the older ones won't take it god
[45:48] gives a chance to the little ones
[45:52] [Applause]
[45:55] if the older ones won't take the full
[45:56] promise and take a hold of this thing
[45:58] that generation won't take a hold of it
[46:00] god gives grace to the new ones they're
[46:02] going to take it and in the new
[46:04] testament acts 2 i'll read it to you
[46:06] again repent be baptized in the name of
[46:08] the lord jesus christ and you shall
[46:10] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[46:12] the promises unto you
[46:14] to your children to all that are far off
[46:17] even as many as the lord our god shall
[46:19] call stop complicating the word and be
[46:23] praying that god will fill our children
[46:25] with the promise that he has left us the
[46:28] promise is for you but it's also for
[46:30] your children can you say amen
[46:33] that's the formula
[46:35] that's the formula they had in the play
[46:36] yesterday at the at the vacation bible
[46:39] school kids days the formula that that
[46:42] the agent had gideon what was his name
[46:44] gideon
[46:45] miles miles that's the formula it's
[46:48] repent be baptized
[46:50] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[46:52] ghost this never changed that's the
[46:53] formula it has power within it and
[46:56] diablo here was is always trying to
[47:00] dilute the promise
[47:03] and bring it down to oh if they just
[47:05] love the lord that's fine if they just
[47:07] do this if they shake the preacher's
[47:08] hand if they if they're going to church
[47:10] they're fine no no it's got to be deeper
[47:11] the formula has power in it the holy
[47:14] ghost has power in it
[47:16] and the formula is the promise from the
[47:18] book of acts until today we parents have
[47:21] a promise for our children
[47:23] that they shall be saved that they shall
[47:26] be repent that they shall be baptized in
[47:28] his name and that they should be filled
[47:30] with the holy ghost it's a promise how
[47:33] many parents will jump onto it this
[47:34] morning that promise was for me but it's
[47:36] for my children as well
[47:39] so in the new testament that's the
[47:40] promise it has power in it don't let any
[47:43] diablo dilute it down to something else
[47:45] it is the power of the holy spirit for
[47:48] our children but we should not settle
[47:50] for anything less than the formula can
[47:53] you say amen i talked about abortion and
[47:55] the prophet made a comment about it he
[47:57] says she didn't take abortion cases in
[48:00] the united states in 1954 she said she
[48:03] has done something she had an abortion
[48:05] she didn't give that this is how he
[48:07] words it and this is with my sermon that
[48:09] woman that took that abortion she done
[48:12] something she didn't give the little
[48:14] fella a chance to live
[48:17] so brother brandon just got described as
[48:19] abortion you're not giving that little
[48:21] fella a chance to live
[48:24] and that's a reflection of what's
[48:26] happening with the ones that are alive
[48:28] listen let's give the little ones a
[48:31] chance to live
[48:33] last quote and i believe they have it
[48:35] here each generation i'm closing on this
[48:38] each generation receiving because it's
[48:40] repeating back again from adam and eve
[48:43] again the first crop the garden of eden
[48:45] so he's referring back to
[48:47] adam and eve our first parents half of
[48:49] them lost
[48:50] wise virgins sleeping versions so coming
[48:53] up now to the prophecies of the end time
[48:55] half of them one kept the word the other
[48:56] one hybrid it right back and forth just
[48:58] as hard as they can go right like that
[49:00] it's been down through the age that's
[49:02] right hybriding hybriding diablo
[49:05] diluting the promise trying to dilute
[49:07] the formula
[49:09] hybriding is always there and it ends up
[49:12] over here in revelations at the second
[49:13] coming of christ now remember correctly
[49:16] that's why
[49:17] each generation has its own revival it
[49:22] gets a chance at the word
[49:27] every generation
[49:29] has a chance at a new revival
[49:33] despite denominationalism despite it
[49:35] even creeping in in our doors as well
[49:38] god says i'll raise up another
[49:40] generation and even though they've
[49:42] hybrid the word i'm going to give them a
[49:44] chance at the word
[49:45] i'm going to give them a chance at
[49:46] revival
[49:49] can you say praise the lord
[49:52] amen i'm done
[49:53] that's all i need to say today
[49:56] you know what i'm going to do
