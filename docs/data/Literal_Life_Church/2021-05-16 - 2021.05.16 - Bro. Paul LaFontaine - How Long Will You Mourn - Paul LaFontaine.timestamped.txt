[0:00] this and read together first samuel
[0:01] chapter 15
[0:03] the last verse there in the chapter and
[0:06] then we'll read the first verse of first
[0:07] samuel
[0:08] chapter 16. so first samuel 15 verse 35
[0:14] we encourage you to give full attention
[0:16] to the word of god today i believe we
[0:18] have some things that the lord has
[0:20] um blessed us with to bless you with and
[0:24] we just pray you have all listening ears
[0:26] to his spirit
[0:28] and there's as paul says we don't come
[0:30] to you with enticing words of man's
[0:32] wisdom
[0:33] trying to entice you to something or
[0:35] trying to use words to
[0:36] but there's a there's a greater uh way
[0:39] that god likes to work and that is
[0:41] his holy ghost opening up your hearts
[0:43] that you receive
[0:44] and he can break down any barrier he can
[0:46] break down any wall
[0:48] and give you what you need today so
[0:49] we're trusting in that we're praying for
[0:51] that
[0:52] verse 35 of samuel 15 and samuel came no
[0:55] more to see saul
[0:57] until the day of his death nevertheless
[1:01] samuel the prophet mourned for saul
[1:06] and the lord repented that he had made
[1:08] saul king over israel remember
[1:10] as we've been teaching the people chose
[1:12] saul they wanted a king so bad
[1:14] the people chose him god didn't choose
[1:16] him samuel the prophet anointed him
[1:19] he worked he he worked with them and
[1:21] then were coming to a place in scripture
[1:23] where he had disobeyed god that he
[1:25] took the prophet's position he had
[1:27] stepped out of place and the last thing
[1:29] completely disobeyed the the commandment
[1:32] of god
[1:32] so now god withdraws himself from saul
[1:36] and takes his spirit from him he's no
[1:39] longer go
[1:40] he goes on to try to be king but god has
[1:42] withdrawn himself from him
[1:44] but this is an interesting scripture
[1:46] where it says samuel
[1:48] mourned for saul and then chapter 16
[1:51] verse 1 god responds to that and he says
[1:53] the lord said unto samuel
[1:55] how long will you mourn for saul how
[1:58] long will you mourn for saul
[2:00] seeing i have rejected him from reigning
[2:03] over israel
[2:04] fill thine horn with oil and gold i will
[2:07] send thee to jesse
[2:09] the bethlehem bethlehemite for i have
[2:12] provided me a king
[2:14] among his sons my subject this morning
[2:17] is how long will you mourn
[2:19] how long will you mourn heavenly father
[2:22] we ask you to bless your word
[2:24] we thank we're thankful lord to see the
[2:28] the events taking place in the news and
[2:30] lord we're closer than we were
[2:32] five years ago we're closer than we were
[2:34] even a year ago and lord we just pray
[2:37] that this word today will bring us
[2:38] closer to you
[2:40] we pray that rapturing faith would come
[2:42] in the people lord
[2:43] and god threw your word that you would
[2:45] prepare us that you would make us ready
[2:47] that you if we're lacking something in
[2:49] our lives we pray that you'd show it to
[2:51] us this morning and
[2:52] give us those things where we're lacking
[2:54] i pray that you'll bring victory in the
[2:56] people
[2:57] and we're thankful lord for the last
[2:58] days we're thankful that we're living
[3:00] where we're living
[3:01] and we're thankful that we have this
[3:02] place to come and hear the word of god
[3:05] still open to us we consider it a great
[3:07] privilege lord to be here
[3:09] and we pray that you'll come and
[3:10] minister your word to the people
[3:12] as you see fit father and we commit the
[3:15] service
[3:15] in this day to you in jesus name amen
[3:19] god bless you may be seated this morning
[3:25] and a great thank you to the
[3:28] people who built me something here to
[3:30] hang my coat on
[3:34] it might need to be a little higher but
[3:36] i'm not complaining
[3:38] thank you so much i can put my water
[3:40] there and my coat and
[3:42] whoever did that i think mike piste and
[3:44] different ones the wesley i appreciate
[3:46] it brother thank you so much
[3:48] god bless you for that yeah
[3:50] [Applause]
[3:53] amen thank you it was getting pretty
[3:55] serious you know i was throwing my coat
[3:57] out in them
[4:01] so we have been looking at the scripture
[4:03] together
[4:04] uh at saul and david in the bible
[4:07] and one was the choice of the people and
[4:09] one was the choice of god
[4:11] both of those choices god approved and
[4:14] god
[4:15] anointed by the same prophet and so we
[4:18] get from that that under the same
[4:20] message we can have fruits of our own
[4:23] choice still taking place
[4:25] but then the fruits of our own choices
[4:28] over time prove what those choices are
[4:32] and we see the fruit of our own choices
[4:34] and see that usually it doesn't come out
[4:36] good
[4:37] when we choose our own way god lets us
[4:39] do that
[4:40] and so uh in a few services we looked at
[4:43] the fruits of saul
[4:44] the fruits that came out of his life the
[4:46] fruits that came from the people's
[4:47] choice
[4:48] and the same thing happens to us in our
[4:51] spiritual journey
[4:52] we thank the lord for his grace because
[4:55] god allows us sometimes to be able to
[4:57] watch
[4:58] the fruit of our own choices sometimes
[5:00] over years
[5:01] we can observe them and we can admit and
[5:04] be honest after it all that we shouldn't
[5:06] have fought
[5:07] so hard for our own choices uh how many
[5:10] would raise your hand and be honest say
[5:12] i know where that i know what that means
[5:14] i have been there done that i know what
[5:16] it means to make choices that i thought
[5:18] were so right and i
[5:19] fought for those things even twisting
[5:21] the hands of
[5:22] a god a little bit but then i got to see
[5:25] at the end that that was immature
[5:26] choices that wasn't god's will
[5:28] how many would raise your hand and say
[5:30] i've been there done that and so
[5:32] god allows us to see the fruits of it
[5:33] and we looked at all the fruits of saul
[5:36] and what
[5:36] began to come from his life we'll still
[5:38] look at those things after this
[5:40] scripture if the lord leads us
[5:41] we'll still look at because the next
[5:43] stage after this
[5:45] is when saul was still living trying to
[5:47] be king
[5:48] and david david was risen up by god is
[5:51] to be a king
[5:52] and now the tension began between saul
[5:54] and david
[5:55] those tensions speak clearly of
[5:57] sometimes attention in a home
[6:00] a tension in a church tension within the
[6:02] ranks of the message
[6:04] tension in different things and it's
[6:05] because god is raising up a different
[6:07] type of leadership that's
[6:09] christ-like leadership and god is
[6:11] phasing out the wrong type of leadership
[6:13] but while the two are there tension
[6:15] rises can you say amen
[6:17] and you we have observed those tensions
[6:19] so that's where we're going
[6:20] but today we see in our text that not
[6:24] only can you see the fruits of your
[6:26] decisions and we see the fruits of
[6:27] saul's decisions
[6:29] as wrong leaders that we have chosen but
[6:32] we find samuel the prophet
[6:34] mourning over saul and so when i read
[6:36] that i thought that's
[6:37] that needs to be talked about a little
[6:39] bit because this is something in human
[6:42] nature that
[6:43] we not only see sometimes the fruits of
[6:45] our decisions
[6:46] and we're upset at it maybe we're angry
[6:48] at it but but then there's there's
[6:50] something that samuel is doing here that
[6:52] even though
[6:53] samuel knew that saul was wrong even
[6:56] though he he rebuked him even though he
[6:57] said
[6:58] god's left you you're not really the
[7:00] anointed king anymore
[7:02] even though samuel himself seen all that
[7:04] he went through a time
[7:06] of feeling bad for saul and kind of
[7:08] feeling emotional
[7:10] about how many knows that prophets are
[7:12] human beings too
[7:13] and they can get emotional how many
[7:14] knows that john the baptist
[7:16] even doubted a little bit whether he was
[7:18] the messiah and asked his disciples to
[7:20] go ask if he was the one
[7:22] prophets are human beings as well and
[7:24] here we have a prophet
[7:25] going through a mourning time he
[7:27] wouldn't go see-saw
[7:28] but yet he's going through this bit of
[7:30] low time
[7:31] in his feeling bad for for saul being
[7:34] taken or the kingdom being taken from
[7:36] saul
[7:37] and we see samuel mourning over saul and
[7:40] there's so there's some
[7:42] human emotion involved that he felt bad
[7:45] for him
[7:45] that he was rejected from god now may
[7:48] the lord help me to get into this
[7:49] because
[7:50] that scripture would not even be there
[7:53] except there be some
[7:54] emotional thing that takes place in the
[7:57] human being when we come at the end of
[7:59] recognizing wrong decisions that we have
[8:02] made that we actually have a time of a
[8:04] low time
[8:05] that we actually have a time where we
[8:07] mourn over what's been lost
[8:09] we mourn over someone that has hurt us
[8:12] now that's strange because
[8:13] we can be very angry at something that
[8:15] has hurt us we can be angry at our
[8:17] decisions
[8:18] and yet there's a part of us that can go
[8:20] through a morning time
[8:23] and so i thought it was very unique and
[8:25] you know i i just want to take some time
[8:27] on this
[8:27] because it's so related to how we can be
[8:30] in our emotions sometimes
[8:32] god and so after a certain amount of
[8:34] time
[8:35] we're samuel and it doesn't say how long
[8:37] but samuel
[8:38] is mourning over saul he's in this state
[8:40] of mourning
[8:41] he's in is in the state of feeling bad
[8:44] for him he's thinking about him still
[8:46] now
[8:46] he should be saying god what's next he
[8:49] should be saying
[8:50] if he wasn't your choice then could you
[8:53] please show me who the next is
[8:55] i'm looking forward to the next step in
[8:57] the life of israel
[8:58] he should have been saying that he's
[9:00] going to say let's go forward let's move
[9:02] on
[9:02] but he wasn't he was still thinking
[9:04] about saul he was still
[9:06] mourning about saul he was having a pity
[9:08] party he was just
[9:09] all sad about it and he shouldn't have
[9:11] stayed there and i don't know how long
[9:13] he stayed there
[9:14] but finally god had to say to samuel
[9:16] listen
[9:17] it's time to move on it's time to get
[9:23] over
[9:23] saul it's time to get over
[9:27] your past
[9:30] because how many knows that i've
[9:31] preached before here your past
[9:33] has a power to it to keep a cloud over
[9:36] you to keep you
[9:37] from going closer to god your past has a
[9:40] power to it that if you dwell in your
[9:42] past
[9:42] and you mourn over your past even though
[9:45] god has forgiven you or your sins
[9:47] if you stay in depression about it you
[9:49] can't move on with god
[9:52] and the david christ cannot rise in your
[9:55] life
[9:56] until you have dealt with and come
[9:58] through and left
[9:59] your past as paul teaches us forgetting
[10:02] those things which
[10:04] are behind you know what i like about
[10:07] that scripture
[10:08] that it's not complicated but we
[10:10] complicated well what do you mean by
[10:12] that it's like
[10:12] what things do i should i still think
[10:14] about it just says forget
[10:17] yesterday forget those things are what
[10:20] you're behind
[10:21] and press toward the mark of the high
[10:23] calling paul just gives you permission
[10:26] to let it go just let it go
[10:30] and so we find something in here that is
[10:32] uh very
[10:33] very uh teachable to us all
[10:36] and i want you to listen because we want
[10:39] to get a bit deeper with it
[10:41] so god is ready to anoint a leader
[10:43] another leader out of his own choice and
[10:45] after a certain amount of time
[10:47] god did not delay to move on it was time
[10:51] kind of like in revelations 10 when the
[10:53] mighty angel christ comes down
[10:55] sets his foot upon the land and upon the
[10:58] sea and his last words were
[11:00] it says that and time shall be no longer
[11:03] no more delay that's enough and that's
[11:06] enough of man's ideas that's enough
[11:08] it's coming to an end can you say amen
[11:10] because he puts his land upon his feet
[11:12] upon the land and sea and christ
[11:14] begins to take over and say this has
[11:16] been going on for two thousand years
[11:18] where men have messed with the word of
[11:19] god but finally god says
[11:21] that's enough i'm gonna reveal my word
[11:23] to the people and bring him to a rapture
[11:25] somebody say praise the lord
[11:29] there's a time when god says that's
[11:30] enough can you say amen
[11:32] so this is a little bit of rebuke to
[11:35] god's own prophet
[11:36] because he's still mourning over saul
[11:39] who knows how long he was mourning
[11:41] but it was long enough for god to say
[11:43] that's enough
[11:44] and god could not move on to his true
[11:46] will
[11:47] until people's thoughts and attention
[11:50] and mourning
[11:51] were off of the past
[11:54] i'm going to say it again god could not
[11:58] move the people on
[12:01] to his perfect will until they were
[12:05] over the mourning and thinking of
[12:08] the past
[12:12] i think that's teachable to us
[12:15] don't expect god while you're just
[12:18] just still grieving for years over the
[12:21] past or over some situation
[12:23] don't be praying say god take me on take
[12:26] me take me on to psalm i want greater
[12:27] things i want greater revelation
[12:29] if you're going to stay there in a
[12:31] morning over the past
[12:33] it's difficult for god to do that
[12:36] because he's all about
[12:37] as the scripture says i will do a new
[12:39] thing saith the lord
[12:41] i want to do a new thing in your life i
[12:43] want to move you on
[12:45] i would love for you to just just let
[12:47] all that be washed away
[12:50] and you can get a fresh start tomorrow
[12:51] morning that i'm not thinking of the
[12:53] past
[12:54] whatever i've done wrong it's under the
[12:55] blood of jesus christ if satan tries to
[12:58] bring it up it's under the blood
[12:59] satan it's a no fishing zone you can't
[13:02] fish in the sea of god's forgiveness
[13:04] it's a no fishing zone i'm not letting
[13:06] satan bring up any of my past
[13:08] it's done i'm not even going to give one
[13:10] thought to what i've done it's under the
[13:11] blood
[13:12] and the only thing i'm thinking about is
[13:14] what god has for me next
[13:17] and god says you can live that way paul
[13:20] in the bible says you can forget
[13:22] those things which are behind and press
[13:24] toward the mark of the high calling
[13:26] god gives us permission to do that you
[13:29] don't have to think about it ever again
[13:30] and when it comes to your mind you just
[13:32] dump it out of your thoughts you don't
[13:34] have to think about it
[13:35] but it's not like us as human beings to
[13:38] do that
[13:38] we tend to mull over the past
[13:43] and some of us tend to mourn
[13:46] grieve over the past
[13:51] there is a human possibility for people
[13:53] to get stuck
[13:55] in mourning over their bad mistakes or
[13:58] their bad decisions
[13:59] it's in us as a human being to to stay
[14:02] in a stage
[14:04] of being stuck being actually stuck
[14:07] is is this speaking to anybody this
[14:09] morning
[14:10] to get stuck somewhere to get stuck in
[14:13] your past
[14:14] decisions to get stuck in your bad
[14:16] mistakes that you made
[14:17] and get stuck in the past or stuck
[14:20] over a leader who has fallen in your
[14:23] eyes or stuck
[14:24] uh you know i preached something years
[14:26] ago brother isaiah brooks came to my
[14:27] church and preached the sermon
[14:29] i i'll never get away from it i preached
[14:32] the series after it but
[14:33] it was called the images of the mind and
[14:35] i have preached there since then
[14:37] of how powerful images can be in
[14:39] people's minds
[14:41] image to me image can be more powerful
[14:43] than words
[14:46] because images stick in somebody's mind
[14:48] for a long time
[14:49] someone can ask forgiveness from god
[14:52] someone can
[14:53] leave a church because the leadership
[14:54] was bad someone can get out of a bad
[14:57] situation
[14:58] and come to a new church but the image
[15:00] in their mind stays
[15:01] sometimes for a long time the image
[15:04] doesn't die because that's all you're
[15:06] used to
[15:06] that's the leadership you're used to and
[15:08] sometimes people are expecting
[15:10] the new leader to be the same way and
[15:12] when the new leader does a little
[15:13] something that's similar
[15:15] it stirs up all the past and you go you
[15:16] get scared so oh no
[15:18] that's it's going to be the same thing
[15:19] it's because you're you're associating
[15:21] the new leader
[15:22] with what the old leader did i like to
[15:24] tell people hey listen
[15:26] i'm the new guy on the block i'm the new
[15:28] pastor don't associate with me with your
[15:30] past
[15:31] give me a chance
[15:34] i'm the new kid on the block in your
[15:35] life give me a chance
[15:37] i'm not perfect by any means but
[15:40] certainly please
[15:41] please don't put me back with that old
[15:43] pastor of that old leader
[15:44] try to give me a chance please
[15:49] trying to help you i wouldn't be here if
[15:52] i wasn't trying
[15:53] i wouldn't live here unless i was trying
[15:55] to help you
[15:56] and find a balance in the word of god
[15:58] and preach the message the way it should
[15:59] be preached
[16:01] people are hungry to see the message
[16:03] preached the way it should be preached
[16:05] can i get an amen it's a human
[16:08] possibility
[16:09] that oh oh you stay stuck in a leader
[16:12] that has fallen
[16:13] an image is more powerful than words
[16:15] that's another sermon in itself
[16:17] but sometimes it takes years for people
[16:20] even after they leave a leader
[16:22] it takes years a leader that's fallen or
[16:24] a
[16:25] leader that's left the word or a leader
[16:27] that's abused them
[16:29] sometimes it takes years for people to
[16:30] get over that and to get that image out
[16:32] of their minds
[16:35] you gotta have a lot of grace for people
[16:37] because image is more powerful
[16:39] images change over time i believe the
[16:42] holy ghost can change a nature
[16:44] in one moment
[16:48] how many believe that he can change this
[16:50] nature and your desire in one moment
[16:53] but images in your mind don't die at an
[16:57] altar
[16:57] overnight and it's because you
[17:01] get the holy ghost how many know you
[17:03] need the holy ghost
[17:05] you don't need religion you don't need
[17:06] to put the message on the outside
[17:08] talk about all the last day's events you
[17:10] need the holy ghost to make it in a
[17:11] rapture
[17:12] and so when you have that though you get
[17:15] the power
[17:16] to be able to overcome false images of
[17:19] the mind
[17:20] and you got to do it because that will
[17:22] bind you as a christian even as a holy
[17:24] ghost christian
[17:24] it'll bind you and it takes years for
[17:27] people sometimes
[17:28] to to die to old images in their mind
[17:31] they get stuck in mourning they get
[17:33] stuck in a certain place
[17:35] and so moving on we see that the images
[17:38] is such a powerful subject but we're
[17:39] going to move on it's a powerful thing
[17:41] but you see now they can people can be
[17:43] in another church and even under a
[17:45] different ministry
[17:46] but still stuck in the way as before
[17:48] images of the mind
[17:49] don't die overnight the spirit of god
[17:52] had left
[17:53] saul the spirit of god had left saul he
[17:56] is no longer being used and yet
[17:58] there's this lingering morning in
[18:00] samuel's mind
[18:01] morning oversaw
[18:05] and god says it's time to come out in
[18:07] the morning it's time to leave the past
[18:08] i have something better for you
[18:10] it's my choice i want you to stop right
[18:12] here this hall has to stop
[18:14] this morning has to stop it's time for
[18:16] you to move on because i have a better
[18:18] choice for you now
[18:19] and so uh this subject now brings me to
[18:22] something that i've been wanting to talk
[18:24] about for quite a long time
[18:26] and that's and this is this is a perfect
[18:28] place to talk a little bit about it
[18:30] i'd like to talk about mourning i'd like
[18:33] to talk about when a
[18:34] a human or a brother or sister
[18:38] goes into a mourning stage no no matter
[18:40] what
[18:41] mourning over a death mourning over a
[18:43] trauma whatever it is
[18:45] but i got to talk about mourning because
[18:47] morning
[18:48] it's real
[18:51] grief is real
[18:57] uh i hadn't understood some of this
[19:00] until
[19:00] i had someone close like my dad last
[19:03] year to
[19:04] to die in the family never had someone
[19:05] that close to pass away
[19:07] and so this become a bit more real to me
[19:10] in so many years even as a pastor
[19:12] i couldn't understand someone that close
[19:14] going and the grief that they would go
[19:16] through
[19:16] and you can be a bit critical sometimes
[19:18] but grief is real
[19:21] getting down about a loss it's real it's
[19:23] a real feeling and i don't think we
[19:24] should deny that
[19:25] i don't i think we should allow
[19:27] ourselves to go through a mourning
[19:28] process
[19:30] i i think that we should give people
[19:31] time and
[19:33] you know not try to figure things out
[19:34] from let them go through that morning
[19:36] can you say amen and grief is real
[19:39] mourning is real
[19:40] and uh so you know we we we can have so
[19:43] many deaths of
[19:44] family members and i understand it a bit
[19:46] better now and you know i
[19:48] i feel like i maybe dealt with things
[19:51] better than i thought but i just being
[19:53] asking maybe it all hasn't hit me yet
[19:55] but still the grief and the the mourning
[19:58] i experienced that i know i
[20:00] i guess i i feel tr very
[20:03] uh secure and i could go through it
[20:06] easier knowing about three things
[20:08] i know my dad completed his work on
[20:11] earth
[20:13] that's an assurity he completed his work
[20:15] he was supposed to do
[20:16] i know that my dad received his new body
[20:19] and he's over there i know that it's not
[20:22] doubt my mind and i also know that i
[20:25] will meet him again
[20:26] very soon so these are the types of
[20:29] scriptures and
[20:30] assurances that help us
[20:34] to be god gives us why does god gives us
[20:37] give us his word for this because he
[20:39] understands mourning
[20:41] he understands a loss
[20:45] and so god god understands those things
[20:48] and so
[20:49] maybe the full impact hasn't hit me yet
[20:51] and if it
[20:52] if it does then i'll need your strength
[20:55] and your prayers
[20:56] but knowing the hope it stabilizes
[20:58] things the lord but the feelings of
[21:00] mourning and the feelings of grief are
[21:02] real feelings can you say amen
[21:05] that i get to feel what others feel
[21:08] anyone who says
[21:10] that if i have the holy ghost then i
[21:12] don't a person with the holy ghost
[21:14] doesn't have grieving they shouldn't
[21:15] have mourning or grieving
[21:17] that's just crazy jesus himself
[21:21] wept over his friend lazarus
[21:25] so to say well the person you must not
[21:27] have the holy ghost because you're going
[21:28] through this great grieving and mooring
[21:30] over a loss that's just crazy because
[21:32] we're human beings jesus went through it
[21:34] human beings christians go through
[21:37] mourning
[21:38] christians go through grieving and god
[21:40] has a special way to minister
[21:42] to those who are in mourning over a loss
[21:45] can you say amen
[21:46] he says blessed are they that mourn
[21:49] for they shall be comforted
[21:54] jesus the bible says in isaiah was a man
[21:57] himself
[21:58] the reason he can minister to you if
[22:00] you're mourning the reason he can
[22:02] minister
[22:02] is that in isaiah it says jesus is a man
[22:05] who who's
[22:06] a a man of sorrow
[22:10] he was a man acquainted with grief
[22:13] and that's why god understands it and
[22:16] can minister to you
[22:17] because he was a man of sorrows he was a
[22:20] man of grief
[22:21] he was acquainted with grief aren't you
[22:23] glad you got a high priest tonight that
[22:25] was acquainted with grief
[22:27] that understands what you're going
[22:29] through and he can minister to you
[22:31] just exactly what's needed in those
[22:33] times of your life
[22:35] if you'll lean on him
[22:39] you see people in the world and
[22:40] sometimes even christians will turn to a
[22:42] bunch of things in their mourning and
[22:43] their grief they'll turn to alcohol they
[22:45] never were an alcoholic but they turned
[22:46] to alcohol a lot of people turn to
[22:48] alcohol
[22:49] they turn to this they turn to that they
[22:50] withdraw themselves they they pull
[22:52] themselves away with all the friends
[22:54] the body of christ sometimes the church
[22:56] they just they just
[22:57] but see that's not necessarily the
[22:59] answer god and you may feel that way and
[23:02] it's real
[23:02] but god depend on the lord because god
[23:05] has certain
[23:06] junctions of certain things of he drops
[23:08] in there
[23:09] because he understands your morning and
[23:11] he wants to help
[23:12] you heal and understand
[23:16] some things we'll never understand some
[23:19] things will come under that song that we
[23:20] used to sing with the family
[23:22] we'll talk it over in the bye and bye
[23:25] i'll ask the reason
[23:27] oh i love this this would be his name
[23:30] i'll ask the reason
[23:32] and he'll tell me why when we talk it
[23:35] over
[23:36] in the bible guy how many raised hands
[23:38] no there's some things
[23:39] we will not get answers for on this
[23:42] earth
[23:43] we don't know why we don't understand
[23:46] and if you're not willing to just trust
[23:48] god that way
[23:49] you may not grow as quick out of your
[23:51] mourning because you have to know
[23:52] there are some things that we won't
[23:54] understand but we'll talk it over in the
[23:56] by
[23:57] and by i'll ask the reason to my lord
[24:00] and he will tell me
[24:02] why but guess what
[24:05] in some ways god over time will give you
[24:08] the answers of why
[24:10] there was a quote i was looking for last
[24:11] night and couldn't find it but there was
[24:12] an incident when someone died
[24:14] and they asked the boy to pray for the
[24:16] boy that he wouldn't die he went on and
[24:18] brother bryan's comment was is that this
[24:20] was god's time for him to go
[24:22] because if he'd have stayed alive he
[24:24] would have went into this and when he
[24:25] went into that
[24:26] and god got away from the lord who knows
[24:28] that but god
[24:31] so we in our carnal minds we can't
[24:33] figure it all out
[24:34] but i have found with some people
[24:36] sometimes after a certain amount of time
[24:38] if they'll trust the lord
[24:39] he brings us answers he settles our
[24:42] hearts
[24:43] he brings us out of the grieving but
[24:46] grieving is real
[24:47] god cares about the grieving i care a
[24:50] lot more about the grieving
[24:51] and i just think people should be given
[24:53] time
[24:54] to grieve and if you do searches on
[24:57] google and everything you'll find all
[24:59] kinds of things they've got this
[25:00] narrowed down now
[25:01] there's stages of a grieving there's
[25:03] stages people go through
[25:05] all this stuff comes out of them that
[25:06] never was there before anger and
[25:08] everything else
[25:08] but you know what people need to be
[25:10] allowed to go through
[25:12] all the stages some said there's seven
[25:14] stages some say there's 12.
[25:15] i don't know we're not going to try to
[25:17] figure it all out but let people go
[25:19] through
[25:19] the stages of grieving is that okay with
[25:22] everybody
[25:23] give people pray for people don't say
[25:26] just you know there's nothing worse to
[25:27] say hey man listen quick
[25:29] you need to pull yourself out of this
[25:31] you need to be careful what you say
[25:33] because you must go through all those
[25:34] stages but you must go through them
[25:37] with the lord not in some little room
[25:41] dark
[25:42] closet somewhere by yourself with your
[25:44] video machine
[25:47] not a couch potato veggin on some series
[25:50] tv series you want to watch
[25:52] that's not really going to get you out
[25:54] of your morning
[25:57] i'm talking to you now this is real
[26:01] people turn you see what happens in the
[26:03] human spirit is when
[26:04] we get real low over something that
[26:06] happened our spirits get so low the
[26:08] devil starts to attack us
[26:10] and really started because there's a bit
[26:12] what happens is
[26:13] is there's a bit of giving up that
[26:14] happens in the spirit
[26:16] it's it's like i don't understand this
[26:18] this is too hard for me to handle
[26:20] and so it keeps working on us and keeps
[26:22] working on us and in our
[26:24] spirit and i have been here your spirit
[26:26] kind of just starts
[26:27] giving up now outwardly you're still
[26:30] going to work
[26:31] you're still maybe going to church
[26:33] you're still functioning out like doing
[26:35] going through the motions but in really
[26:36] you're giving up
[26:40] i'm talking to you this morning this is
[26:42] how the devil and when you start
[26:44] that's what the devil wants he's taking
[26:45] your spirit to a giving up
[26:47] then you might be online looking at all
[26:49] the stuff to cause you to doubt the
[26:50] message and talk without the lord
[26:52] doubt god exists because satan's taking
[26:54] your spirit that's low
[26:57] and now he's feeding you with all this
[26:59] stuff because he want to take you over
[27:00] the top
[27:01] given up completely on god it's real
[27:04] friends
[27:05] be careful what you do when you're there
[27:06] and you start giving up in your spirit
[27:08] because you'll start allowing sinful
[27:10] things in your life
[27:12] that you wouldn't normally allow and
[27:13] you're justifying it because you're low
[27:15] in your spirits
[27:19] you see your friends this is just us
[27:21] here
[27:22] and the whole world that's going to
[27:23] watch it when they post it
[27:26] sometimes i don't post it because you
[27:27] know what i'm talking about right now
[27:30] i take a bit of criticism around our
[27:33] ranks
[27:34] um and i know the people mean well but i
[27:36] think that's psychology brother paul
[27:37] he's preaching psychology just preach
[27:39] the message brother paul
[27:40] don't preach psychology but i'm trying
[27:42] to be me
[27:44] and if preaching about how the spirit
[27:46] works
[27:47] in your conscience and your subconscious
[27:49] is psychology
[27:50] then brother branham was wrong
[27:54] he talked about it and he was the best
[27:56] at talking about some reason a man with
[27:58] a seventh grade education
[27:59] could diagnose the spirit like nobody
[28:01] could and how humans work and there's
[28:03] nothing wrong with psychology as far as
[28:05] diagnosing the human being because
[28:07] after 6 000 years of history some of
[28:09] these psychology books
[28:10] can can can diagnose the human being
[28:13] they've got it down pat the problem with
[28:17] psychology is what brother brahm says
[28:19] psychology at the end is not the answer
[28:22] to the problem that's what we preach
[28:25] against psychology
[28:26] mind over matter and i'm going to do
[28:28] this and i'm going to have
[28:30] kind of like when the the doctor told
[28:32] brother branham when you get temper
[28:33] really gets high
[28:34] and you just tie a little string on your
[28:37] finger there
[28:38] and when you use it and he was ready to
[28:39] take that gun and shoot those guys that
[28:41] were being mean to him as a little boy
[28:42] and he looked over that string his
[28:44] teacher gave him and he just took that
[28:45] string and pulled it off
[28:48] psychology didn't work
[28:51] because he said he needed the new birth
[28:53] first
[28:54] he said the new birth started to take
[28:56] care of that temper
[28:58] i'm paraphrasing there he said the new
[29:00] birth he said i needed the new birth
[29:02] because you see that's when you have a
[29:04] power on the inside
[29:06] to overcome these things but psychology
[29:08] is not the answer
[29:10] but people can so i trust that you would
[29:12] trust me this morning
[29:13] i'm not here to preach psychology but
[29:15] i'm diagnosed the real way that people
[29:17] feel sometimes
[29:18] and christians feel that way
[29:21] anybody else has said otherwise they're
[29:22] in denial of what can happen to you is
[29:25] in your human spirit
[29:26] you get so low but god has a way to
[29:28] minister to those who mourn
[29:30] blessed are they that mourn so so i've
[29:33] been talking a lot about mourning over
[29:35] the death of loved ones
[29:36] and i think that's been really real in
[29:38] our church the last few years
[29:41] and so that's why i think the lord led
[29:43] me here but i want to say this
[29:44] not all mourning is over a death
[29:49] many things can bring into your spirit
[29:52] a mourning or a grief and if a human
[29:55] spirit experiences a shock of some kind
[29:58] a trauma of something in life
[30:01] a financial loss you lose everything
[30:03] that was job
[30:06] i'll read a quote about job in a minute
[30:09] you lose everything and by the way
[30:11] you could lose everything where are you
[30:14] going to stand then
[30:16] bear stand on the lord there's no
[30:19] guarantees of your job
[30:20] there's no guarantees of your you see so
[30:23] but
[30:24] someone hits a trauma and they can't
[30:25] handle it financial loss
[30:27] abuse sexual abuse mental abuse in their
[30:30] childhood or even now
[30:32] divorce is a trauma for not only the
[30:35] wife or the husband
[30:36] but the children of a divorce
[30:40] a trusted leader that you trusted so
[30:42] much fell into sin
[30:43] or fell away from the world with the
[30:46] word
[30:46] that's a trauma that's a shock to the
[30:48] human spirit
[30:52] abused people can it's a shock to their
[30:54] system a child hardly ever recovers
[30:57] because it's a shock to the human being
[30:58] for someone who is sexually abused as a
[31:00] little child
[31:01] they hardly get over that because god's
[31:02] not made us to have that happen to us
[31:05] and so a person can go into grief the
[31:06] rest of their life it throws the human
[31:09] spirit into
[31:10] mourning into depression sometimes that
[31:12] people stay in that for constant years
[31:16] it's real can you say amen and then
[31:18] there are
[31:19] symptoms that come from being in the
[31:21] depression or bringing in the grieving
[31:23] there's symptoms that pop up withdrawing
[31:25] from relationships
[31:28] withdrawing from the lord physical
[31:31] sickness they
[31:32] say can come from mourning
[31:35] physical ailments come as a result of
[31:38] someone being in mourning
[31:40] bad decisions people make bad decisions
[31:43] when they're in mourning
[31:44] they turn to alcohol or drug abuse or
[31:47] some other type of abuse
[31:49] or they turn to their video games in in
[31:52] an addiction to video games or they turn
[31:54] to their television
[31:55] or they turn to other things because
[31:57] this is the symptoms
[31:58] something's in depression someone's in
[32:00] depression it's kind of giving up on the
[32:02] inside as i said
[32:03] and even when they're going through the
[32:05] emotions on the outside
[32:07] their inside is giving up and turning to
[32:09] other things
[32:11] so you can google all this and find all
[32:13] the stages specific stages people go
[32:15] through
[32:16] people wonder what's wrong with them and
[32:18] what's going on and you can find out
[32:20] other people say
[32:21] you got to pull all this but listen i
[32:23] think we should give room i'm going to
[32:24] say it again
[32:25] i think we should get prayer and room
[32:27] for what people go through in a morning
[32:29] in a grieving period
[32:31] and not pretend it's not there and i'm a
[32:35] christian and i'm not allowed to feel
[32:37] this way
[32:39] can i get a bigger amen than that i
[32:42] don't think we should pretend i think we
[32:43] should be real
[32:44] but i don't think we should turn away
[32:46] from the lord i don't think we should
[32:47] turn away from the ministering of the
[32:50] body of christ
[32:52] i could be very specific today and i
[32:55] don't want to make this personal with
[32:56] anybody
[32:57] some of you went through grieving and
[32:58] you turned other things you withdraw
[33:00] yourself
[33:01] you're not as faithful to hear the word
[33:03] of god listen i'm encouraging as a
[33:05] minister that's not the answer
[33:07] sometimes the very place and channels
[33:09] god has to bring you out of your
[33:11] mourning
[33:11] you neglect those things and turn to
[33:13] other things
[33:18] amen let's take this a bit deeper deeper
[33:21] though
[33:23] morning is real and he comforts the
[33:26] morning
[33:28] but never forget
[33:31] in god there will never
[33:34] be a perpetual lifelong
[33:38] eternal curse to stay
[33:42] in mourning the rest of your life
[33:49] if you're around god he will never
[33:52] allow for it to continue the rest of
[33:55] your life
[33:57] and stay stuck in your mourning
[34:00] and that's proved by the text that i
[34:02] said today that god
[34:04] says all right you've mourned saul long
[34:07] enough samuel
[34:09] it's time to fill your horn
[34:12] with oil
[34:16] praise the lord oh i can get preaching
[34:18] now
[34:19] you know what it's time to do it's time
[34:21] to move on
[34:22] and it's time to get some oil some holy
[34:25] spirit and to fill
[34:26] your horn with oil and god's getting
[34:29] ready to anoint something else in your
[34:31] life
[34:33] it's time to get past your past it's
[34:35] time to get past your depression
[34:37] i had stories recently of of family
[34:40] members and children that have died
[34:42] i look at people i say i don't
[34:43] understand how
[34:45] they made it through except for god's
[34:47] grace they shouldn't even be sitting
[34:49] here today
[34:49] losing teenagers and losing moms losing
[34:53] boys and girls that young ages how do
[34:56] you process that
[34:57] but somehow they're sitting here by the
[34:59] grace of god
[35:00] because god cares for the morning and
[35:03] also god does not want you to stay stuck
[35:08] in mourning it says to samuel
[35:13] samuel says he says to samuel it's it's
[35:16] it's it's it's time to be done now with
[35:19] the morning it's time to
[35:21] fill your horn with oil can you say amen
[35:26] god is never into a perpetual
[35:30] lifelong curse eternal curse that's
[35:33] almost
[35:34] eternal curse that's almost uh oxymoron
[35:37] there it's
[35:39] you know i don't think in terms of
[35:40] something bad as being eternal not even
[35:42] there's not even eternal hell
[35:44] as many christian churches preach
[35:46] there's an eternal head there's no such
[35:47] thing as an eternal hell
[35:49] isn't that wonderful i think brother
[35:51] wrap preached out that one time in that
[35:52] wonderful to know that it's even god's
[35:54] grace
[35:55] that something like that god says no
[35:57] they're going to there's going to be an
[35:58] end to that as well
[36:02] and sometimes when you go through
[36:04] mourning i'm just taking my time today
[36:05] because
[36:07] that's all right with everybody this is
[36:09] a subject i've been wanting to speak to
[36:10] a long time and god finally gave me
[36:12] permission to do it
[36:13] i'm just gonna you know i i may take a
[36:16] little time here
[36:18] because i can
[36:23] kind of like a prison ministry a captive
[36:25] audience
[36:31] sometimes when god throws out a lifeline
[36:36] people have become so accustomed to
[36:38] their life of grief
[36:41] that they actually turn down god's
[36:43] lifeline and they stay there
[36:46] let me see this before god's throwing
[36:49] out lifelines and they choose to stay
[36:51] there this becomes a concern of a true
[36:53] genuine pastor
[36:55] or any other minister or sometimes
[36:56] parents becomes a concern because some
[36:58] things
[36:59] god clearly gives a way out god clearly
[37:02] gives some scriptural ministering to
[37:04] to bring someone out of that the answer
[37:06] is so clear but they didn't get it they
[37:08] didn't grab it they didn't take a hold
[37:10] of it
[37:10] and they walk out the building the same
[37:12] way that they were
[37:14] you can talk to a person after 20 years
[37:17] and they're stuck right there where they
[37:20] were 20 years ago
[37:22] everything comes out of them it's
[37:23] exactly the same thing that they said to
[37:25] you 20 years ago
[37:26] they're stuck never move beyond it it's
[37:29] incredible and it's concerning
[37:31] it's still stuck same anger same
[37:33] bitterness
[37:35] same thing russell friedman uh
[37:38] from the grief recovery institute
[37:41] and this is where you'll really label me
[37:43] a psychologist as well
[37:46] so i'm going to read a little bit what
[37:48] he says here because it
[37:50] it brought out something that's real
[37:52] with human beings and what i'm talking
[37:54] about as far as getting stuck there
[37:56] some of us have become very good at
[37:59] holding on to our pain
[38:04] we may have unresolved loss of trust
[38:07] experiences
[38:08] from our childhood that keep us in an
[38:11] almost perpetual state
[38:12] of acceptance of pain as a permanent
[38:16] condition now
[38:17] friends i want you to listen because
[38:19] this is where
[38:20] god wants to step in when the devil is
[38:24] going to take it to this perpetual
[38:27] type of state of acceptance of pain
[38:30] of eternal acceptance of lifelong
[38:32] acceptance
[38:33] of the grieving this is where god says i
[38:36] want to minister you out of that
[38:39] but this obviously from this man it
[38:42] happens
[38:43] many of us keep dragging the unfinished
[38:46] relationship
[38:47] of our past into all of our new
[38:49] relationships
[38:50] and by that he he not only means
[38:52] unfinished relationship of the past but
[38:54] sometimes when someone dies we have
[38:56] unfinished relationship
[38:57] it hurts us so bad because things got
[39:00] things didn't get
[39:01] said it's an unfinished relationship and
[39:03] it's awful hard it's completely
[39:05] completely impossible to finish what you
[39:08] wanted to finish with that person
[39:10] when god takes them so that's it
[39:13] in your eyes that's an unfinished
[39:15] relationship
[39:17] and one thing that it should encourage
[39:19] people do which it doesn't a lot
[39:21] but if you have those things and you
[39:22] viewed as an unfinished relationship
[39:24] i didn't get to say this this the person
[39:26] he went too quick she went too quick
[39:28] i it's an unfinished thing and and you
[39:30] think well i'm just going to live
[39:31] without the rest
[39:31] i want no one thing you can do trust the
[39:33] lord well one thing you can do is that
[39:35] to pour yourself in you might learn from
[39:38] it
[39:38] pour yourself into your relationships
[39:40] you have now
[39:44] pour yourself into your wife
[39:47] pour yourself into your husband and say
[39:50] all the things that sometimes get unsaid
[39:57] it's one way that you can that you can
[39:59] say i learned from this
[40:01] it's in god's hands what was unsaid
[40:04] but i'm going to show you you can finish
[40:06] those things too god can help you finish
[40:08] those things but if it's unfinished pour
[40:10] yourself into relationships now
[40:12] i mean just pour yourself into your wife
[40:14] pour yourself in your hands and your
[40:15] mate's going to be going
[40:17] praise the lord this is nice they're
[40:20] sharing their hearts with me
[40:21] they're giving me themselves they're
[40:23] given their heart this isn't some wall
[40:25] or some person that i'm just living with
[40:28] because i married him 30 years ago
[40:30] and the husband's saying he's why i said
[40:33] you never tell me you love me anymore
[40:35] i hear from my wife sometimes you just
[40:37] hardly ever tell me about it and
[40:39] one guy says i told you i loved you 30
[40:42] years ago when we got married
[40:43] if anything changes i'll let you know
[40:50] i know not to ever say that
[40:54] it's your wife mike's going wow this is
[40:56] she's
[40:57] they learn something through unfinished
[41:00] relationships that now i can pour myself
[41:02] into my kids now i can pour myself into
[41:05] my mates now i'm going to call
[41:07] this family member and i'm going to do
[41:09] my part they may be shut down they might
[41:11] be at the wall just like they were
[41:13] uncle tom i shouldn't say tom uncle
[41:18] jesse
[41:21] that's a man jesse she's jessica
[41:26] you call uncle jesse and you say hey how
[41:28] you doing i just want to
[41:29] you know i just want to say that i love
[41:30] you and can we get together and have
[41:32] coffee and you do that and jesse may say
[41:33] listen i don't want to talk to you he
[41:35] may shut you down
[41:36] but at least you're making an effort now
[41:37] because why you've learned i don't like
[41:39] the pain
[41:40] of unfinished relationships
[41:44] what about your relationship with the
[41:45] lord wouldn't this be an opportunity
[41:48] to get closer to the lord instead of
[41:50] farther away
[41:51] wouldn't this be an opportunity to feed
[41:53] on the message and the word
[41:54] more than you ever have instead of get
[41:57] away from it
[42:01] so you can do that but he goes on to say
[42:03] here many of us keep dragging the
[42:05] unfinished relationships
[42:06] of our past into
[42:12] all of our new relationships
[42:15] and then acting surprised when they
[42:17] always in the same
[42:18] we may be ill-equipped to deal with the
[42:20] feelings
[42:22] we may eat we may be ill ill-equipped to
[42:25] deal with the feelings caused by the end
[42:26] of each new relationship
[42:28] and we may be unaware that almost all of
[42:30] our past relationships
[42:31] are incomplete or unresolved grievers
[42:34] develop a relationship to their pain
[42:37] grievers develop a relation now wait a
[42:39] minute i'm going
[42:40] what a person in grief can develop
[42:45] can can have unfinished relationships
[42:48] can pull themselves away from all other
[42:51] relationships in life
[42:53] but develop a relationship with their
[42:56] pain
[43:00] i want sister tina to sing a song today
[43:02] i sent him a few weeks ago
[43:04] and it's called the breakup the big
[43:06] breakup
[43:07] you know what she's breaking up from you
[43:08] know you know what the song says you're
[43:10] breaking up
[43:10] from having a relationship with fear
[43:14] the big breakup people develop relate
[43:18] they won't be around anybody else but
[43:19] they'll develop a relationship
[43:22] a relationship
[43:26] with fear
[43:32] grievous develop a relation to their
[43:34] pain as if their identity hinged on
[43:36] regarding themselves
[43:38] as unhappy many people become so
[43:40] familiar
[43:41] with those painful feelings that they
[43:44] are afraid to let them go
[43:46] if it were not so sad and if it did not
[43:49] have such dire consequences
[43:50] one would be tempted to draw
[43:54] a cartoon of someone clinging
[43:56] desperately
[43:57] to a horrible looking creature called
[43:59] pain terrified of losing it
[44:04] and yet that is exactly what it looks
[44:06] like
[44:08] some of us are able to acknowledge that
[44:10] we have sabotaged many relationships
[44:13] while we have the intellectual awareness
[44:15] that we are
[44:17] we are the common denominator in the
[44:20] sabotages
[44:21] we find ourselves unable to change our
[44:23] behavior
[44:24] if the intellect were the key to
[44:26] successful recovery then we would
[44:28] be able to think ourselves well or think
[44:30] ourselves out of it we would be able to
[44:32] understand ourselves into better actions
[44:34] clearly that does not work incomplete
[44:36] relationships
[44:37] create unresolved grief and unresolved
[44:40] grief creates incomplete relationships
[44:43] incomplete relationships can cause us to
[44:44] limit our lives can induce us to
[44:47] sabotage good relationships
[44:48] and can encourage us to keep choosing
[44:51] poorly
[44:52] unresolved grief can cause us to define
[44:54] ourselves
[44:56] as unworthy of happiness now we know
[44:59] that is a lie of your enemy a lie of the
[45:03] devil
[45:03] that we are unworthy of happiness again
[45:07] that is a lie i'll never be normal again
[45:10] that's a lie i can never come in i don't
[45:14] deserve to come into happiness again
[45:16] because of the unresolved things that i
[45:18] didn't settle and take care of with
[45:20] a lost loved one or a loss of this or
[45:23] decisions i made wrong
[45:24] but that's alive they mean no matter how
[45:26] true it looks to you
[45:27] it's a lie to say can you say man that
[45:30] you're
[45:31] unworthy of happiness the word says
[45:33] otherwise
[45:34] the word says because of calvary you're
[45:37] worthy of deliverance you're worthy of
[45:39] his grace
[45:40] you're worthy of his love you're worthy
[45:42] of happiness
[45:46] the word says you're worthy to be happy
[45:48] the word says you're worthy
[45:49] to have a good marriage you got to latch
[45:53] on to it said
[45:54] the word says it because the spirits
[45:56] will come on a low spirit
[45:58] and you're down your family's having
[45:59] trouble and the devil will say
[46:01] you're not even worthy of it so that's
[46:02] where you quit trying
[46:05] because you've been told by a lie i'm
[46:07] unworthy of happiness
[46:11] why then do so many people resist taking
[46:13] the simple and clearly defined actions
[46:15] of the grief
[46:16] actions that they should take
[46:21] we must learn how to grieve and complete
[46:23] relationships that have ended or changed
[46:25] so so then it is the
[46:30] ah we refer to how familiar we become
[46:34] with our pain i got to move on here
[46:36] familiarity can
[46:38] create a powerful illusion that change
[46:41] is not necessary
[46:45] just talking about the human being the
[46:48] psychology of how he works
[46:49] not how god necessarily works that's a
[46:53] powerful statement familiarity
[46:56] with pain and with your grieving can
[46:58] create a powerful illusion
[47:01] that change can't come or change is not
[47:04] necessary anymore
[47:07] because i'm familiar now and i have a
[47:10] relationship
[47:11] with the pain
[47:14] that growth is not possible and that
[47:16] where happiness concern
[47:18] 20 percent equals 100 percent what
[47:20] happiness is concerned
[47:23] am i equipped for happiness
[47:27] yes but i am much more familiar with
[47:29] pain
[47:30] as the direct result of years and years
[47:32] of practice i am expert at identifying
[47:34] relating to emotional pain happiness is
[47:36] an unwelcome intruder
[47:38] in how i relate to myself see god tries
[47:41] to bring
[47:42] deliverance or god tries to bring
[47:43] something and you're so used to the pain
[47:46] happiness is an unwelcome intruder in
[47:48] how i relate to myself we have all
[47:50] searched desperately for the key to
[47:51] happiness
[47:52] while it may sound simplistic to say
[47:54] that we held the key ourselves all along
[47:55] it is true
[47:56] access to our own happiness is directly
[47:58] linked to our ability to grieve and
[48:00] complete our relationships with people
[48:01] and events
[48:02] as well as our ability to grieve and
[48:03] complete our relationship to the pain
[48:05] we generate when we are reminded of the
[48:07] unhappiness we have experienced in our
[48:08] lives
[48:09] and many of us say over and over that if
[48:11] only this or that would happen
[48:12] i could be happy
[48:16] the thing might be love or money or
[48:18] success or fame if i could only have
[48:20] this then i'd be happy and yet
[48:22] how often do we get the very thing we
[48:23] wanted and wind up as unhappy
[48:26] as we were before and even more
[48:28] disillusioned
[48:30] to rediscover your ability this is where
[48:32] i disagree with the man to rediscover
[48:34] your ability to be happy you must go
[48:36] back and grieve and complete all your
[48:37] incomplete relationships
[48:39] from your past i disagree with them
[48:41] there i do agree with this part of it is
[48:43] that god
[48:44] can allow you to go back and to be able
[48:46] to find closure through the word of god
[48:48] and what he ministers to you
[48:49] to find closure for incomplete
[48:51] relationships you give god time he'll
[48:53] help you with that
[48:54] but god does not allow you to go back
[48:57] through your morning and stay
[48:58] in mourning the rest of your life
[49:02] is that okay with everybody and i hope
[49:04] that doesn't sound too much psychology
[49:06] i'm going to get some criticism for it
[49:07] but
[49:07] i'm used to that but listen i like to
[49:09] talk about how the human being works
[49:12] and how the devil brings his lies to a
[49:15] human being that's low
[49:17] i'm exposing him this way i'm not
[49:19] preaching psychology i'm exposing our
[49:21] devil
[49:22] i'm exposing the devil in your life that
[49:24] you can get over your past
[49:26] and over your mourning and over the
[49:28] trauma of what's happened in your life
[49:31] can you say amen the grace of god is
[49:33] with you this morning and here among us
[49:36] to help you get over your trauma to help
[49:38] you over mourning
[49:39] to pull you out of your depression can
[49:41] you say man
[49:42] that you can be a happy holy ghost
[49:45] filled
[49:46] christian walking with the lord it's
[49:49] yours this morning you're worthy of it
[49:51] can you say amen
[49:52] because of christ praise be to god
[49:56] i just feel like i ca i still can't wake
[49:58] some of you up but i'm
[49:59] praying all of us wake up and say thank
[50:01] you lord for the grace of god in my life
[50:04] thank you lord that you minister help
[50:06] during the times of trouble
[50:08] thank you lord that your word says that
[50:10] that i sought the lord
[50:12] and he delivered me from all of my fears
[50:16] all of my doubt all of my mistrust
[50:19] he'll dissolve all your doubts daniel
[50:21] says
[50:22] he's the god that does it he says you go
[50:25] back as you do so you will begin to find
[50:27] your normal natural desire
[50:28] i disagree with his answer about going
[50:30] back and i usually do with a
[50:32] psychologist
[50:33] conclusions to things never in god do we
[50:36] have this you must allow the lord to
[50:37] minister each thing that seems
[50:39] incomplete
[50:40] he can give you answers closure and some
[50:42] things he will answer clearly on the
[50:43] other side
[50:44] but nothing is impossible with god the
[50:47] same god that cleared up all of
[50:49] joseph's joseph's life
[50:53] and his hatred from his own brothers he
[50:56] cleared it up at the end and told joseph
[50:58] till he could tell his brothers
[51:00] instead of being angry at them god
[51:03] cleared it all
[51:04] up why did this happen why did they sell
[51:07] me into egypt
[51:08] why my own brothers did it to me i don't
[51:10] understand this
[51:11] finally over time god gives joseph a
[51:14] revelation
[51:15] and he could see clearly why he did it
[51:18] god will do the same thing for you now i
[51:21] know why
[51:22] and his brothers were thinking he was
[51:23] going to kill him he said no i love you
[51:26] god did this for a purpose to bring me
[51:29] into this position
[51:30] so that i could bless the entire nation
[51:35] the tender hand of jehovah
[51:38] my mom says that song's been on her mind
[51:40] lately
[51:41] the tender hand of jehovah guiding us
[51:45] and he gives us the answers why
[51:50] hallelujah hallelujah let's give god
[51:52] praise
[51:55] hallelujah
[52:03] to be scriptural about this it'll pull
[52:05] up the scripture genesis 37 35
[52:08] we're like jacob sometimes when we come
[52:10] to our grief before joseph come into his
[52:12] positions and he found out his son was
[52:14] his son was dead or he thought was dead
[52:16] that's what jacob said
[52:18] when he was grieving about joseph dying
[52:20] genesis 37 35
[52:23] and all his sons and all his daughters
[52:25] rose up to comfort him
[52:27] but he refused to be comforted
[52:32] jacob i refuse he got this bloody
[52:34] garment that
[52:35] his son joseph his favorite son was dead
[52:37] but here's
[52:38] here's our reaction sometimes they tried
[52:40] to comfort him but he refused to be
[52:42] comforted and he said
[52:43] for i will go down into the grave unto
[52:46] my son
[52:47] morning thus his father wept for him
[52:50] that's the way we get
[52:52] i'm taking this pain to the grave don't
[52:54] try to comfort me
[52:56] the lord or other people i'm taking this
[52:58] to the grave
[52:59] i'm holding on to this pain and i'm
[53:02] grieving so much that i'm taking it
[53:04] that's pretty stubborn
[53:06] his son wasn't even dead he's going to
[53:08] get a blessing to realize later
[53:10] he wasn't really dead god was going to
[53:12] give a a big reunion someday
[53:15] to his son guess what you all
[53:19] god's got a reunion for you and your
[53:22] loved ones has passed away
[53:23] god has a reunion god has a celebration
[53:28] for you to be reunited with him
[53:35] well praise the lord there's another
[53:37] place here
[53:38] in mark 16 9 the disciples you know when
[53:41] jesus was risen early
[53:43] the first of the week mark 16
[53:46] 9 now when jesus was risen early for the
[53:48] first of the week
[53:49] he appeared first to mary and magdalene
[53:51] out of whom he had cast seven devils
[53:53] and she went and told them that had been
[53:56] with him
[53:57] as they mourned and wept they're
[53:58] mourning over jesus and it wept
[54:00] and they when they had heard that he was
[54:02] alive and had been seen of her
[54:05] believed not that's somebody in grieving
[54:09] that says
[54:10] i'm kind of just sticking with the
[54:13] grieving
[54:14] i don't believe if you want to come out
[54:16] of your
[54:17] you're grieving in the morning you're
[54:19] going to have to start
[54:23] you're gonna believing to trust god is
[54:26] this okay with everybody
[54:28] it's the way we can be i'm gonna stay
[54:30] this way i'm gonna make excuses this way
[54:33] people can make excuses for not coming
[54:35] to church
[54:38] can find excuses to justify people can
[54:42] try to coddle me
[54:45] people can try to comfort me
[54:51] god never intended for us to have a life
[54:52] relationship with fear
[54:54] or pain or grief or mourn the rest of
[54:57] our lives
[55:00] how long
[55:03] how long will you mourn over saul
[55:07] you've had some souls in your life many
[55:09] of you
[55:11] but my question is how long will you
[55:14] mourn
[55:15] over saul is that okay

[55:33] i think of job when he was old stricken
[55:35] in age
[55:38] you guys have that one i think of job
[55:40] when he was old stricken in age and his
[55:41] flesh was simply falling
[55:43] from his body from sores his heart was
[55:46] broken
[55:47] in grief remember now he left his
[55:49] children he lost all of his money he
[55:51] lost all of his
[55:52] farms he lost everything and he you talk
[55:55] about a man who's in grief
[55:57] his heart was broken in grief and every
[55:59] mortal part of his being was withering
[56:00] away
[56:02] and a great man like that who made a
[56:03] great impression to the world in his day
[56:05] and to see that and all that it was
[56:06] you know some ways the devil you're just
[56:08] finished you used to be a great man you
[56:09] used to be happy you used to have all
[56:11] this
[56:11] you speak faithful and church and all
[56:14] those now
[56:14] you know it's over for you bud so job's
[56:17] thinking
[56:18] it's all over he said he would go
[56:19] through the cities of the east and the
[56:20] princes would bow before him on account
[56:22] of his wisdom
[56:23] but here he was at his wit's end anybody
[56:26] ever been at your wit's end
[56:28] me and brother michael okay
[56:32] i must be preaching too long here his
[56:34] body was gone his property was gone
[56:36] his children was gone and that he and
[56:38] that he had was gone
[56:40] and then god in his mercy come down to
[56:43] job and he give him
[56:44] another sense that he could open his
[56:48] eyes and see the day when there would be
[56:51] a body
[56:52] he would receive he knew that there was
[56:55] coming one
[56:56] a just one who would stand in his place
[56:59] who would raise up the body of the dead
[57:02] and would
[57:04] you notice that god come down and
[57:06] visited job
[57:08] after a long time
[57:12] he said i know that my redeemer liveth i
[57:15] like these positive words that he spoke
[57:17] in it
[57:18] not i hope so i have a feeling there
[57:21] will be
[57:22] that's about the attitude of many today
[57:24] i have a hope that someday
[57:27] but job had more than that he said i
[57:30] know
[57:31] i know remember i said earlier about my
[57:34] dad
[57:34] i know he fulfilled his commission i
[57:37] know he has his new body this morning
[57:39] and i know i'm going to meet him very
[57:40] soon not i hope so
[57:42] i know so that's what god gave job
[57:46] is not some hope soul but some no-so
[57:49] hallelujah i know my redeemer liveth the
[57:52] positive side of it
[57:54] no more in the negative it's all
[57:57] positive
[57:59] [Applause]
[58:05] god don't leave you in your mourning
[58:06] friends at
[58:08] lazarus i said he wept at lazarus
[58:12] but then he ended the weeping
[58:15] he ended the morning and that's our god
[58:19] he wants to end the morning there has to
[58:22] be an end to the weeping
[58:24] ecclesiastics 3 1 says to everything
[58:26] there's a season
[58:27] and a time to every purpose under the
[58:30] heaven
[58:30] a time to be born and a time to die
[58:34] you guys have that scripture
[58:36] ecclesiastes 31 to everything there's a
[58:38] season time to every purpose under
[58:40] heaven a time to
[58:41] be born a time to die a time to plant a
[58:44] time to pluck up that which plant
[58:45] planted a time to kill a time to heal a
[58:48] time to break down
[58:50] and a time to build up a time to weep
[58:53] and a time to laugh a time to mourn
[58:57] and a time to dance now you see
[59:01] the wisdom in revelation in this
[59:03] scripture our life will go through
[59:05] seasons
[59:07] but did anybody notice the seasons never
[59:10] stay
[59:11] perpetual they change
[59:15] and there is a time to mourn
[59:18] but there will come a time to dance
[59:22] hallelujah don't you
[59:26] ever accept that i'll got a relationship
[59:28] with this fear and relationship with
[59:30] this morning
[59:31] and i'll be here forever don't ever
[59:32] accept that here's three or four more
[59:34] excursion scriptures to you
[59:36] and then we'll close psalms 30 and verse
[59:38] 11.
[59:39] psalms 30 and verse 11 thou has turned
[59:41] for me
[59:42] my morning into dancing thou has put off
[59:45] my sackcloth
[59:46] and girded me with gladness
[59:49] god can turn your mourning into dancing
[59:54] psalms 30 and verse 5 for his anger and
[59:57] dearth but for a moment
[59:59] in his favor is life
[1:00:02] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[1:00:05] cometh in the morning everything i
[1:00:08] preached to you today
[1:00:09] is right here in the bible right here in
[1:00:11] the scripture and all i've said
[1:00:13] is mourning is not an eternal perpetual
[1:00:15] thing that you'll end your life with and
[1:00:17] go to the grave with
[1:00:18] god says no if you'll lean on me i'll
[1:00:20] bring you out of your mourning
[1:00:22] and bring you back to dancing again
[1:00:24] weeping may last for the night
[1:00:26] but joy comes in the morning i'm glad to
[1:00:30] serve a god like that can you say amen
[1:00:33] isaiah 60 and verse 20 isaiah 60 and
[1:00:36] verse 20
[1:00:37] the sun shall no more go down neither
[1:00:40] shall thy moon withdraw
[1:00:41] itself for the lord shall be thy
[1:00:44] everlasting light
[1:00:45] and the days of thy morning shall be
[1:00:48] ended
[1:00:52] isaiah 51 11. therefore
[1:00:58] the redeemed of the lord shall return
[1:01:02] and come with singing unto zion
[1:01:07] and everlasting joy shall be upon their
[1:01:10] head
[1:01:11] they shall obtain gladness and joy
[1:01:14] and sorrow and mourning shall
[1:01:18] flee away
[1:01:24] i love this scripture here i'm going to
[1:01:25] end in that one keep it up
[1:01:30] the redeemed of the lord shall return
[1:01:32] we're already in that scripture isaiah's
[1:01:34] prophecy
[1:01:35] because as soon as the message came
[1:01:37] we're in a restoration returning
[1:01:38] back to the faith of the fathers we're
[1:01:40] returning back to zion again
[1:01:43] we're on our journey back to zion
[1:01:46] we're marching to zion and
[1:01:49] it says they'll be returning they'll be
[1:01:52] returning
[1:01:54] not not with
[1:01:57] depression and mourning
[1:02:01] and fear and just barely making it
[1:02:06] into the rapture just
[1:02:09] oh lord pull me up would you
[1:02:16] that's not what that scripture says
[1:02:19] our return our returning is happy
[1:02:23] is rejoicing we've come out of our
[1:02:26] morning
[1:02:27] we've come out of these things our
[1:02:29] return design is not just this
[1:02:32] gloomy doubtful
[1:02:36] barely making it into the rapture can
[1:02:39] you say man
[1:02:40] with all kinds of trouble bringing us
[1:02:42] down and living in depression
[1:02:44] that's not how we return but we return
[1:02:48] with number one singing singing
[1:02:52] singing if you're in depression start
[1:02:54] singing
[1:02:55] even if you're a monotone and can't sing
[1:02:58] just start
[1:02:58] singing nobody's gonna hear you but
[1:03:00] yourself and god
[1:03:03] they shall return with singing and
[1:03:06] musicians that was your cue
[1:03:08] to get up and come so you can get this
[1:03:11] preacher out of this sermon
[1:03:14] they shall return with what
[1:03:19] and it's not the song woe is me
[1:03:23] oh is me who
[1:03:26] is me
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:38] that's all the words just woe is me love
[1:03:40] me i don't think it's that song i think
[1:03:42] it's another special i think it's
[1:03:44] it's special because it's they come with
[1:03:46] singing but the singing
[1:03:48] and everlasting joy shall be upon their
[1:03:51] head
[1:03:52] they shall obtain gladness and joy
[1:03:57] and sorrow and mourning shall flee away
[1:04:00] if you don't like me for the rest of the
[1:04:02] sermon and you didn't get anything else
[1:04:03] out of it
[1:04:04] all you need to do is to say lord that's
