And right now in the good times you are on your throne. You are God alone and right now in the good times and bad. You are on your throne and you are God alone. Esther chapter 4 and uh verse 10 again. Esther spake unto Hayetch and gave him commandment unto Morortei. All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who was not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out his golden scepter that he may live. but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days. And they told to Mori Esther's words. So she sent back word to Mori after we know that a letter was written by Hmon to destroy Esther's people and the destruction of them. Then Mori goes into fasting and praying and he asked Esther to do something and she said, "Well, there's a lot of hurdles to that and unless I'm summoned by the king, that's the law that I would be killed." Anyone would be killed if they're not summoned to the king. Verse 13, then Moria commanded to answer Esther, "Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, and I want you to hold on to that little comment. If she must have been she must have had a pretty important position in all this. And she really didn't even know how important her position was. Everybody else would be squelched and everybody else could hold their peace. But if Esther held her peace, then it's a problem because she's really the one that had the authority to pray and say something to the king about it. I want you to notice now Esther's a type of the bride and we're living in a time there's a lot of people pray, but there are people positioned that what they say and what they pray calls upon greater things, big things. Can you say amen? So I want to show that this morning. If thou if you hold your peace at this time, then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place. But thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? You know what he's hinting? You actually have been positioned. Just think about it, Esther. God's called you to this time and this place for a special purpose. You don't need to hold your peace. It's important that you say something. It's important that you fast and pray. We can all fast and pray with you, but you've got the position to do it. So, don't hold your peace. And maybe God's, this is the slogan I have in my office. You'll see it on the wall in my office. Perhaps uh he said, "Who knoweth whether thou come to the king and kingdom for such a time as this?" I I have that in my office to encourage me. He didn't call me in Luther's day or Wesley's day. He called me right in the middle of Satan's Eden to be a preacher, to actually get up here and preach to a lot of people's issues, my own issues, a lot of problems, a lot of pressures, a lot of demonic power. But if God's called you to that hour, he's going to give you what to say cuz he's called us for such a time as this. And he's called you for that as well. Then if you pick up um then Esther bathe them returned to Mori this answer. Go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shishan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise, and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish. I want you to look at the courage and strength that come in heart only by revelation. Can you say amen? Every emotional fear and scare would tell her stay away from that. But something rose in her heart to speak up. And then chapter uh if we just read along the verse chapter five. Now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house. And it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight. And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter. If you study that, when a king holds the scepter, it means if she touches that or whoever touches it, they are uh they are they are joined together with the power and the authority of the kingdom. For him to hand that to her, no one else in the kingdom but to hand it to Esther and for her to touch it. God has uh God has chosen her for a special purpose. Amen. Praise the Lord. And then you know what he says verse three just before we pray. Then said the king unto her, "What wilt thou, Queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom." I want to repeat again Markap 6 and verse 9 as we're picking up where we left off uh when we were speaking of the disciples asking the Lord, "Lord, teach us to pray." And when they ask it, then Jesus goes into this short prayer in Mark 6:9. After this manner, therefore pray ye. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. I think at one place it says, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen." When the disciples asked, "Teach us to pray," this is the short prayer that he used to teach us to pray. Often it's called the Lord's prayer, but it's not really the Lord's prayer. It's what he said for us to pray. And I want to take a look at this and uh just uh we've looked at it so many times. We quote it and we we we quote it from many services and I'm sure all of you know it by heart, but we must always look at the deeper meaning of the things that said because there's such deep meaning to what he says in this prayer. And I I've been not only is it each each phrase has a deep meaning to it, but I I I want you to notice how big a request this is. This isn't just a little prayer, but he's actually teaching us to ask for something big. When you're saying, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven." That's not a small request. That's a pretty big request that actually we could pray for his kingdom to come down to earth and that we would begin to live a life that his will, his principles, his kingdom principles would be lived out in my life and lived out in this earth. In other words, this is so big that with the world as bad as it is, believers have an authority in God to ask for his kingdom to come down to earth. That's a pretty big prayer request, but it shows how much power is in the heart and lips of the believer. And so, there's nothing surface about there this prayer. There's nothing shallow about this prayer. It's just a few lines. It's just a short prayer. By the way, this shows us it's not the quantity of words we say in prayer. It's the quality of words. It's not long prayers. Can you say, "Man, this is very short, but it says a lot. It has a lot of substance to it." I think when we go pray, I think it should come from the depths of our heart. I don't think we should just throw in words there. I think it should be a prayer of substance. I think it should be a prayer that comes from our heart. Can you say amen? And I I I I think it it should have the substance of sincerity and revelation behind it. When our prayer has revelation behind it, because this prayer has revelation behind it, it's actually saying that I have something in my heart to ask for his kingdom to come to earth. That's the big picture of the entire redemption plan of God that his kingdom would come back to earth. That's a big prayer request. That is a a a big thing to ask for a believer. So I think our prayer should have substance and sincerity and revelation behind it. And in these few words, he says we can call for his kingdom to come and for those kingdom principles to be already in action on earth. That his will could be done in earth right now as far as this world. His will is not done in this earth. His will is not in politics. His will is not be carried out by anybody. But it's the believers that say, "Lord, I want your will in heaven and your principles to be shown here in my life on earth." Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh, you know, and then he asked for all these kingdom principles to be in action here on earth already, even for before the millennium, and for all channels of unforgiveness to be cleaned out. That's what he asked for. And this is part of our prayer as well, because we can't go to prayer properly if we have unforgiveness in our heart. So part of our prayer is that Lord, I can't hold on to an unforgiving spirit and be right to ask this. I must forgive those who have done trespasses against me. And if I've done trespasses, I want to clear that up. His prayer is clearing all that up. We can't hold unforgiveness in our heart. And then he goes on uh as the last thing and maybe we'll get to more of this in another service but he says and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from uh evil. So many things that he's bringing. He said give us this day our daily bread. That's asking for revelation. Brother said we should ask for revelation more than any other thing that we ask for. We need revelation. Yeah. So give us this day, not our uh every year at camp bread, but give us our daily bread. Give us our spiritual bread. Give us revelation. We need more revelation. Give it to us, Lord. And give it to us daily, not just Sunday at church. Can you say amen? So we would think that when he teaches us to pray, he he would say something like, "Yes, you can pray for things that you need in life." And but the Lord says, "I'll handle the big stuff. I'll handle the kingdom coming. I'll pray for those things, but you just you're welcome to bring things. No, he teaches us to pray that we're asking for his kingdom to come. We're asking to to we're we're asking for his will to be done as it is in heaven. Let it be done in earth. Sons are asking for that. Can you say amen? So my point in this lesson is we look at how we pray and he teaches us to pray that it causes the person to align himself or herself with the entire purpose and mystery of God from the beginning. We have things that we pray about and like brother Rap said last Sunday the smallest thing, the smallest need, he's concerned about the smallest, he's concerned about the biggest. So it doesn't matter to God. Can you say amen? But you see now there's a prayer that aligns itself with the purpose and the plan of God. And when he says, "Thy kingdom come," which is my title this morning. When he says, "You pray, thy kingdom come," that's a pretty big prayer. And it's actually aligning a believer with the entire purpose and mystery of God from the very beginning. It actually joins in participation with God's ultimate achievement and agenda and that is redemption. redemption is God's uh from the very beginning when he fell when man and and and the woman failed then we realize God right there gave a prophecy of redemption and now for 6,000 years he's been in the process of working to redeem his people back to redeem his bride back to bring it back to Adam and Eve again and to restore Eden again and to make this earth a millennium only God can do that but I just want to show you Who's asking for it here? It's a believer aligned himself with the prophecy and the whole redemption plan of God and they're asking for it to come. As a matter of fact, nobody else in this world is asking for it. Nobody else is asking for that. They have their own agenda, but there's a people aligned with God's agenda. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. And so you align yourself with the very mystery of God. It joins in participation with God's ultimate achievement or agenda. Is it is a prayer that calls for God to fulfill what he said he would do. He's already said it, but this prayer aligns itself with God's already said this. And when God says it, it's going to happen, but somebody needs to pray for it. Somebody needs to hasten it. It's kind of like John saying in in Revelations, even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus. I don't know if any of you have had that prayer recently. But I'll tell you, if you listen live in this world, I've had that upon my lips. Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus. Hasten your coming. I'm not afraid of it. Bring it to pass. How many's tired of this world? How many is tired of the pressures? Can you say amen? And so the rest of the world, they teach you to function that we'll be here forever, but we won't be here forever. There's believers actually tired. This world is not my home. I'm just passing through and I'm growing more weary of it all the time. I'm tired of the pressures. So, there's a group of people that's saying there's a promise of a rapture laying right in front of me and I'm going to pray that prayer. Hasten it. Bring it to pass. Lord, whatever you got to do to get me under rapturing faith so this can take place. I don't know if that's your prayer. That's my prayer. I believe it's the bride's prayer. When your prayer taps into the very plan of redemption of God and says, "God, I know my son's away from you. I know my daughter's away from you. I know I've tried everything. It seems impossible, but listen, redemption is available, and I'm going to pray for it for my children. I'm aligning my prayer with what you said. You will save them." God loves that. He said, "They've asked for something here big, but I can't really get around it because I've promised if the same requirements are met, I can save that boy. I can save that girl. I can do something because God's bound to his word. Can I get an amen?" God is bound to his word. But he said, "Ask. Ask that your joys may be full." That's right. Ask. No, but why doesn't God just come and shower with us? Why do we have to ask? Because it's the participation with it. As brother Rap was saying, the participation. Sometimes it's like we're waiting. Even himself, we wait around for God to do something. We ray around. But you see what we speak in the in in the inspiration of God. He wants us to ask for those things. He wants us to speak those things being led of God, of course. But he wants us because we have a participation in creation. We also have a participation in the redemptive plan of God even to redeem this earth. We have a participation in that. God is wanting his people to participate in the process of bringing his word to pass and our prayers and our heart and and and and our our words are participating. Can you say amen? There is a reason that we he said we start our prayer with our father. You know why we start our prayer? Jesus said, "Start with our father." Only sons and daughters of God can begin their prayer that way. So who who's he teaching here? He's teaching predestinated sons of God. That angels can't begin their prayer with our father. That's right. And they know how to worship. Matter of fact, we can learn something from angels about worship. We enjoyed our worship this morning. But believers should be worshiped even more exuberantly because angels, they worship God 24/7 or if that time zone is there, I don't know. They worship him constantly and they've never fallen in sin. They've never been away and yet they worship him constantly. I'm I'm preaching to sons of God that fell that were away from the Lord. Can you say amen? They know something about the grace of God. You pro many of you shouldn't be here this morning, but by God's grace, you're here. So your worship should be more exuberant than the angels worship. They don't know what it is to re be redeemed. They don't know what it is to be lost and be found. They don't know what it is to have the word taken from them and restored back to them. They worship all the time. They worship with all everything they are. But oh, when a son of God comes back to God, Bible says all heavens rejoice. Amen. Over one sinner that repents. That's right. There's great rejoicing that goes on. Amen. Why? Because redemption is more powerful. I just said that to one of my kids last night. I said I prayed with him and I said, "Redemption, everybody has a story of redemption." And redemption is more powerful of a story in God than someone who just had all perfect life. But it's more powerful when someone drops to the very bottom of the miry clay and it seems like they'll never come out of that and God picks them up and raises them up and changes them. That story is greater than some Pharisee who's never done anything wrong. Right. Amen. Somebody ought to praise us the Lord this morning. We serve a God of redemption. And our lives have all come under the power of redemption. And when you come under the power of redemption, there's only one way you're headed, and that's up, not down. But that power keeps pulling you higher, keeps pulling you out of the dimensions. Can you say amen? Keeps raising you out of your depression, out of your past uh flaws, out of your childhood trauma that you went through. There's only one power to come underneath that'll raise you above all of that. It'll bring you out of the fish like it did Jonah. He prayed and it brought him out of the fish. Amen. Why? Because our prayer is tapped into the plan of redemption and God's power of redemption. And there isn't any situation that's too impossible for him. We begin our prayer with our father because we are sons and daughters of God, predestinated sons and daughters of God. You know my daddy, my father, he'll he owns the cattle of a thousand hills. Yeah, there's a song, Sherry. I don't know if you remember that song by the Neons that said, "If you've got a problem, I'd sure like to share. There's one special way I can show you I care. I can offer opinions that might prove untrue, but there's one sure answer. Here's what I'll do." And here's what the course says. I will talk to my father for you. Hallelujah. And if I know my father, here's what he'll do. He'll lay at the feet of the things you pursue. It's no bother. For my father will do it for you. I've got a big big daddy. My daddy has gone to build a home for me. Can you say amen? I go to prepare a place for my daddy is very successful. My daddy's very rich. And I will talk to him for you. He has my daddy. He has my my number in his phone. My father has his number. And not just my number, he has my picture in his phone. And when I call him, my picture comes up. Predestinated son of God. I'm not just some alien. My picture comes up in God's phone. And my father may be in a meeting, a very important meeting, but I know I've learned when I call in prayer, he says, I excuse me just a minute. And he steps out and he takes my call every time. Can somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Predestinated sons had access to the father. And when we go to prayer for someone else, I'll talk to my father for you. Can you say amen? Recognize your position. Bring all your sins underneath the blood of Jesus Christ. Stop. Stop being defeated by Satan's condemnation of your past. When are you going to stop living in the past and what you've done? Bring it under the blood because God wants to make you sons and daughters, kings and priests, standing with confidence. Hallelujah. Confidence in your testimony, confidence in your prayer, confidence in your faith in God. How many years will you let Satan beat you over the head and make you your nobody in the body? You're nobody in in this kingdom. You come to church, but you're a nobody. Stop listening to the devil. You're under a word that's causing you to see your past under the blood and only look into the future. He's making you a king and priest. He's making you a mature adopted son of God. Say, "I don't I didn't feel like that this past week, brother Paul." I don't care what you feel like. This word is making you a king and priest. Praise God. Oh, that God would hasten the day. That people would get over their past and stand sure-footed as sons and daughters of God. Not with arrogance, but with confidence, with perfect faith. I know who I am. I know God has called me. And I'm not just some other statistic in this world. I'm not judged by my past mistakes. I am looked at through the blood of Jesus Christ. And this word is making me a king and a priest. Tony Evans said, "The kingdom agenda can be defined, I've been reading a little bit of this, the kingdom agenda can be defined as the visible manifestation of the comprehensive rule of God over every area of our life." Stop right there. His kingdom's coming, but his kingdom is already here. And when it's established in husband's hearts and father's hearts and mother's hearts and wives hearts and then in teenagers hearts when his kingdom is established in there he you give him rule over every area of your life for watching our service today.
