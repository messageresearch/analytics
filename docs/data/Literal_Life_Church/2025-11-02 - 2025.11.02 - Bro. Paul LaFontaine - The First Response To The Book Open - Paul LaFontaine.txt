But I heard you call my name. I felt you lift my shame. And I made a vow that day that I'd spend the rest of my life loving my Jesus, showing my scars, telling my story of how mercy can reach you where you heart. And I pray the whole world hears the cry of my heart. To see all the ones I love loving my Jesus. Sin tries to make you high. whispers that same old line. Keep all your pain inside. No one will understand. The last thing this lost world needs. Someone I'm trying to be. Truth that has set me free. And I'm just a broken man. Loving my Jesus, showing my scars, telling my story of how mercy can reach you where you are. And I pray the whole world hears the cry of my heart. See all the ones I love. Loving my Jesus. When all is said and done. When my last song's been sung, stand face to face with the one who gave all for me. Pay all I have to show. Be all that mattered most. Making your great name known. Let this be my only legacy. Loving my Jesus, showing my scars, telling my story of how mercy can reach you where you are. I pray the whole world hears. Cry of my heart. See all the ones I love.

We believe it with all of our heart. Thank you, Lord. Blessed be his name. Praise be to God. We believe it with all of our hearts. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. I enjoy singing that song. A few months ago at the night of worship, uh I did the soloist for it. So, I don't know how I got knocked out of it. My uh I was singing it with him. It was uh my son took my place there. I don't know what happened. I got demoted. I was I must not have sang good enough or something. It sounds, you know, Gideon. Um, I used to be my wife's favorite singer until Gideon came along. I used to get invited to all the weddings to sing and now Gideon gets invited. It's humbling. It really is. So, my subject is humility today. It really is humility. 2 Kings chapter 22 and verse 8. And Hilkaya the high priest said unto Shaan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkaya gave the book to Chaan, and he read it. And Chaan uh the scribe came to the king Josiah and brought the king word again and said, "Thy servants have gathered the money that was in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them to do the work that have the oversight of the house of God." And Chaan the scribe showed the king saying, "Hica the priest hath delivered me a book and Chaan read it before the king." So I just want you to notice here this passing of the book. Um Hilkaya finds it somewhere in the temple because the temple was so far away from God. They didn't even have a regard for the book. They found it under dust and somewhere. And so Hilkaya finds it. Then he hands it to Chaan, the scribe, and then Chaen takes it to the king. And so this passing of the book is kind of in Revelations 10 where we'll read in a minute where um our lamb comes and takes the book from him who's sitting on the throne. And and then he takes it and I think the way the prophet worded it said he takes this and he throws it to his prophet that's on earth, the seventh angel. And then that wasn't the last passing. Then John, a type of the bride, he actually went and asked and took the book and he ate of it. So there's just this there's this passing of this book. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But here's the response from it. Chaan read it before the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes. First, I want to title this this morning. The first response to the book opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelations chapter 5. I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?" And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look therein. The first theme with this book, the first theme is to to make it clear that there is no one worthy &gt;&gt; except our Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't care how good man is. I don't care what he's accomplished. &gt;&gt; We are still unworthy. to take it, to look at it, to be benefited by it, &gt;&gt; we are completely unworthy. &gt;&gt; And I I I honestly think that we don't approach this right unless we come to that. That this is not something you can bring any of your good &gt;&gt; anything that we have done. We can't contribute. We can't add it to our resume. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to get across. We are on all unworthy. Brother B. All the heroes of the B of the Bible are unworthy. You take your best and greatest that you see in this life when it comes to this. We are all unworthy and we're undeserving of it. &gt;&gt; And I think that's the only approach. &gt;&gt; You know, when you need to be saved, the first approach, you have to know you're a sinner. &gt;&gt; You have to know you're unacceptable to God. you're born in sin and and there's nothing that you can do to correct it or you have to know that and then you're a candidate to really truly be saved. &gt;&gt; You can't be saved until you know you're lost. &gt;&gt; And John says, "I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look there. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of alders, which are the prayers of the saints. The first response to all of the elders when he took the book as they fell down, &gt;&gt; they bowed. Father, bless your word today. We sense you present with us. And Lord, you're you're the one, Father, if we focus on you. You're the one, Lord, who brings everything that we need. And we're aware of your presence here this morning. We are we just seek to worship you. We seek to lift you up, Lord. And I pray, Father, you take these precious lives that's here, the families, the children, the young people, the older ones. I pray you'll take them once again into your your hand. Those that are listening online, take us all in your hand and form us and fashion us and make us what you desire us to be and what you want to get out of our lives. Grant that, Father. Lord, victories come when you're present. &gt;&gt; So, Lord, we know that you're here. Come, Father. Feel welcome among us. And we just pray that the word would enrich us and change us and fill us, Lord. And we we are so thankful that we have this whole day that we can dedicate to you. And we can have the Lord's supper together as you asked us to do, Lord, many years ago. We're thankful to have this time of fellowship, but Lord, at this moment, we pray that your word would prevail, that your word would have preeminence. And Lord, it would speak those things that are needed in our lives. We thank you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless. You may be seated. The Lord certainly put a shadow or a type here, a wonderful shadow and type in the Old Testament of Josiah. Um, it's a type of the incredible day that we have come to that he opens the book of redemption to his elect. And I do believe that we have a shadow here in Josiah's life of the book opening to him. him not only hearing the book that had been lost, but it's also it was opened by the scribe to him. And then we know that there was something powerful going on because we can read the the response from Josiah of this book being open to him. Matter of fact, I could safely say that many people had read the book before. But his response um speaks of a revelation of something happening in Josiah as he heard the words of these book this book. It it was it was it was above and beyond. His response was above and beyond. And so we can say that there's something in the book and the book being open to us that that can have an effect on us that can be above just you trying to do good. &gt;&gt; You trying to do good is is nice but it's it's it has to go deeper than us just trying to do good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we spoke about last Sunday, uh it goes so deep as even our sacrifices that we make sacrifices and and the these things God says, "Thou uh thou desireest not." But he says, "Lo, in the volume of the book is written of me to do these things." So something deeper than sacrifices and living a good Christian life. That's all fine, but there has to be something deeper. And so this type of Josiah speaks of our day. It speaks of a special time. um it never can be compared with what was before and that's out of a respect for what God did for 2,000 church a 2,000 years of church ages because as much as God dealt with his people in every generation God came down God had an angel to every church age God dealt with the people through that angel and also he dealt with them personally because as much as God did though as much as God did and dealt with his people for all these ages this book was still sealed all of those ages, this book was still sealed by seven seals. &gt;&gt; And and so Jeremiah speaks of a book and he said to seal it up until the time. Daniel speaks of this book and says it's to be sealed until the end time. And even John in the book of Revelations who actually got to look inside of it and when he looked inside of it then he then he was told uh I know you're excited about proclaiming some of these things but it's not time yet. it's not time to proclaim it. And he actually is told seal it up until the end time. And so we know that this this book was held till the end time. The unsealing of this this revelation and what was in here uh in the book of redemption was sealed up. And so I'll say it again. Uh it was sealed up until the day the days of the voice of the seventh angel. That's he gave us the time frame. It was sealed until the days of the voice of the seventh angel. And that's when this will begin to open. Uh when it and when it opens, it'll be a different time. With all that God has done before, he will show he can do things that he's never that he's done before, he shows he can do it again. How many believe this morning that we through this message even have been convinced that whatever God did before, he can do it again. He has proved that in the last days. This message has proved that. Don't you dare say that God cannot do it again cuz he has proved whatever he did 2,000 years ago, he has done it again and he can do it again this morning. &gt;&gt; He is well able to do whatever. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. And no denomination and no person has a right to put a restraint on that. The message set that free and says God that was God back then is God today again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so God has proved that. And but you see now with all that God has done and he shows he will do it again. But somehow it must be something even deeper than that cuz when we get to the time of the breaking of these seals and the handing of this book and the book of redemption and our names in the book, so many of you have been taught so well, whatever church you attend or here uh the meaning to this and what it means to us. Uh and and so but you see and we see it's open to us but more than ever before we we see that God is taking us deeper because of this because he held it until the end time. So I'm just saying that if he held it to the end time that with all God has done and all God is doing there must be something related to us that God would want to do as we see our name in this book. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's that's a quite a time to live in, young people. That's quite a day to live in. A real big revelation to me is to see the results the results of this book being open to sons and daughters of God. Josiah's response in the scripture is a window into his response. And as I said, I want to speak about the first response to the book being open. One thing that we do know uh about the book being open is there seems to be when it's open and I think there's been more sermons about this than what I'm going to preach on this morning but there seems to be after the opening of this book uh worship and joy uh worship and joy reaches a whole uh a whole a higher level &gt;&gt; and we see that in Revelations 5 &gt;&gt; because we see worship uh in Revelations 1 they worship because thou art the creator they worship worship because of creation. But the worship goes deeper deeper with this book being revealed. It's not just a worship because he's the creator, but it's a worship because he's the redeemer. &gt;&gt; And no angels can worship that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So something in that book brought the worship even greater, &gt;&gt; even louder. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When the elders and all them begin to worship, they they cried with a loud voice. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Hallelujah. This was no formal setting. This was a loud voice that said he said they said amen and amen and thou art worthy to loose these seals. And now then John says John gets excited because the prophet said he he seen his name in there. He seen his position. He's seen his part in that. And he says everything under the ground, everything in earth and heaven heard me crying worthy is the lamb. Thou art worthy to receive glory and honor and power. So the the the level of worship increased after this was seen to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we know that and it wasn't a formal response. It was a very loud response. It was a very worshipful. It was joy that had set in. Oh my friends, don't don't get your joy from the things of the world or some some guys, you know, I like football, but listen, there is no joy them kicking a football, winning or losing. There's no joy in that compared to looking inside this book and seeing what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever depend on a joy like that. Something of the world, some new style, some new truck. There's no joy that compares with seeing your name in the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; The worship increased &gt;&gt; and and John and and and and and uh Josiah even when we we go back, you know, Josiah, I said it last Sunday, going back to it, he seen his name in the book, he actually was hearing it and he heard his actual name from 300 years before. He heard Josiah and the priest was while he was reading it, it said there will be a young man Josiah and he'll do this, that, and the other. That was 300 years before. And Josiah actually stops him and says, "Wait a minute. Say that again. Read that again." He says, "And Josiah," this is 300 years before. "And Josiah shall pick up and have a revival in his land. &gt;&gt; He said my name." &gt;&gt; He speaks of me here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Talk about getting excited. &gt;&gt; Josiah is saying, "I'm not making this up. I'm not trying going along trying to do this myself. &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up." And guess what? God's not making it up as he goes along either. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; before the world was created, &gt;&gt; he wrote of me. &gt;&gt; He spoke of me. &gt;&gt; That's exciting. &gt;&gt; That's exciting. God's not making it up as he goes along. Lo, and the book is written of me. But today I'll just pull a little something different because I assume that a lot of the sermons about it. Uh depending on what group you're around, there'd be a lot of service about when the book was opened and you know there was great worship and I believe in that because I've seen it in my life. I've seen seen what what this can do. But I want to go back to this first response. When he took the book and opened it, they bowed. &gt;&gt; The first response was not worship. The first response is they bowed. &gt;&gt; And if you know your Bible, this speaks of humility. &gt;&gt; This speaks of being broken by it. This speaks of being grateful for it. This speaks of feeling unworthy of it. &gt;&gt; The first response is not something that becomes just worship or even just an intellectual dominance &gt;&gt; that we would have over the next person. &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt on. I'm going to preach this morning. Come on. &gt;&gt; The response was not some type of intellectual dominance that I'm better than the next person now. &gt;&gt; That I'm in a higher category now. &gt;&gt; I'd say that we are in a higher category because when you see your name in the book, you realize it's the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; written in there before the foundation. I was a thought of God. It wasn't that just God thought of me. I was his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It wasn't he was going to, oh, and I thought of I thought of Joe's friend. No, you were part of his thoughts. You were in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; He created everything and the world based around thoughts of his bride. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you know the responses that we've had I I'm uncomfortable with sometimes some of our pockets within our with our when within our group not this church but you know just other places and maybe even individually you can apply that because the first response was not uh anything but just they bowed and bowing speaks of humility. &gt;&gt; When we're coming in touch with this revelation it should it we should be humbled by it. and not the other way. The other way is pride. &gt;&gt; It's a real deep grateful feeling that reaches back towards God, it bows. It you know when when you have that it's like when you feel I it's been said one time by a singer years ago said if he if he really came in to this room with all with all the the his glory and this is their their way of expressing it. But I've it's always touched me that if he really came into this room this morning, would we even want to speak? Would we want to say something? We'd probably be be all on the ground recognizing that he's here in a special way. &gt;&gt; That's what the presence of the Lord does. It doesn't make us more proudful. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make us more we've got the edge on everybody else. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make us gloat because the enemy is subject to us. Does any of you know that we're not supposed to worship because the devils are subject to us? &gt;&gt; Jesus taught us and taught his disciples when they come back rejoicing because the devils were subject. &gt;&gt; No, don't worship because the devils are subject. &gt;&gt; Worship, rejoice, have joy because your names are written in the book of life. &gt;&gt; That should be the purpose of our worship. That should be the exuberance of our worship. We ought to raise our hands. We ought to shout. We ought to cry. Can you say amen? Not because we have power, but because &gt;&gt; our names are written in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; It should be the purpose of our worship. Should be the motive. The mode of our worship. It's not I'm a son of God and I have power to zap the devils. We do have power over enemies, but that's not the reason we rejoice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many meetings did people go out of? Oh, we had a meeting. The devils were going everywhere and there was tongues and interpretation and all kinds of We had a meeting. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. But don't forget the motive for worship is that somebody in that audience needed to catch their name in the book of life to be saved, to be full of the Holy Ghost. And if they don't get that, the worship doesn't have much value to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You come in touch with something that says, you know, I'm so deeply grateful back to my God. It's saying, I didn't do anything to earn this. I can't take any credit for it. I had no part of it whatsoever. &gt;&gt; My eyes have been privileged to look and see. My eyes, this is the humility. My eyes have been privileged &gt;&gt; to see what's in the book of life. &gt;&gt; That's the right response. &gt;&gt; My eyes have been privileged to look and see. You know, didn't he say many prophets and sages &gt;&gt; would have loved to look and see the things &gt;&gt; that you see &gt;&gt; and we take it for granted and we lose our humility and the the touch and the feeling. We shouldn't lose that. &gt;&gt; We should never lose the awe of it. We should never lose the feeling of feeling privileged that our eyes get to see this. Wonder how David would act. I've said it before. Wonder how David would act in the service this morning. You know, never mind the preaching, just the choir song and sister Paul and the other brother. And you know, before the cross, before the blood, before the Holy Ghost, David said, "I was glad when they said unto me, let's go to the house of the Lord." and he didn't have nothing in church like you had it this morning. And you said, "I'm glad to go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And maybe his wife said, "Well, you sure we got a little headache. You know, I was glad when they said, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get dressed, family. We're going to meet the Lord this morning. We're looking for him to speak to us." But I wonder if he was transported in time. If he come to literal life service this morning, I wonder how he'd be acting because we know he acted a little strange &gt;&gt; when the ark without the Holy Ghost was coming back to the into the city, &gt;&gt; embarrassed his wife, embarrassed everybody. He's just doing a dance &gt;&gt; unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; And this is the word coming back without the Holy Ghost. This is only a type. This is only a shadow. And the man is acting crazy and he doesn't care. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem says he looks up at his wife and says, "You think that's something? Watch this." And he goes on doing something else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was unashamed. He didn't care. How many prophets and sages and kings would have loved to see the things and hear the things that's preached to you this morning. They would give all of their money to be transported past Calvary, &gt;&gt; past the book of redemption being opened by the lamb, and for them to come to a service this morning. I don't think he would just be sitting quietly and looking at his watch and saying, "When is he going to be done? I need to get going. I've got a schedule this week." I don't think that would be David. I think he'd be here for the day. I think when they songs of Zion came forth, I believe that he'd be worshiping the Lord because he's hearing things that he feels privileged to hear. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to shout, "Praise the Lord." And he's sitting there saying he's sitting on the edge of his seat and he's listening to the preaching and and brother Paul says and the lamb went to Calvary for us and he purchased we're completely it's none of our own righteousness and he's washed away every sin and he's like wait a minute wait a minute wait stop brother Paul let me shout a little while just on that point &gt;&gt; and then I I speed ahead 2,000 years after Calvary and I say God's dealt with his people. I'm I'm repeating my sermon this morning. I've never done this before. I've never done this before. But he says, Brother Paul says, say that again. Brother Paul says, "And the lamb come that went to Calvary, the same lamb steps into John's vision. And now, now what he's purchased, the names in the book, he's coming forth to claim and take that book. Break it open so they can see their names. And then once they see that, he'll redeem everyone. and then I'm going to go get them and take them to a millennium together. &gt;&gt; And David says, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You've got to be kidding me. That's already happened. That's open to us. It's open." I don't think David would be sitting like a bump on a log on a pew this morning. I think he would be acting more like brother diggs. Cadre Diggs. There's no set form of worship or we become formal too. But everybody is affected in some way. &gt;&gt; In gratefulness &gt;&gt; in humility. &gt;&gt; I'm unworthy. &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve this. I can't take any credit. &gt;&gt; My eyes have been privileged &gt;&gt; to look that he knew me and he chose me before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; When he wrote of each time frame in the Bible, he wrote that particular time frame with me in mind. I'm in there and I didn't even apply for the job &gt;&gt; because my resume would never have been good enough &gt;&gt; to occupy this position &gt;&gt; and your resume wouldn't have been good enough. &gt;&gt; You got some good stuff. Well, praise the Lord. Your resume is still not good enough for this. Hallelujah. But I must have got the job. Wesley, you got the job. No, not Wes. Uh, Stevie, you got the job. Wes is still waiting for him. Stevie, you got the job. I just thinking, you got the job. He got the job he was praying for. He asked all of us to pray. So, he went a few days ago and he got the job. And probably his resume helped him and his character. But you know what? This position, none of us had anything to deserve it. &gt;&gt; And he already gave us the position before the foundation of the Lord to be sons and daughters of God. And to be kings and priests, that's what the open book makes us as kings and priests. And that type of position in the millennium as kings and priests. That's the highest position in the millennium. And none of us deserve to get it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Got the job, got the inheritance. You ever see somebody, &gt;&gt; some kid that found out that he's in the he's in the will &gt;&gt; and he's just been a dirt bag his whole life. And he gets a phone call from a lawyer says, "We want you to come in and we're going to read the will of the this ancestor that's there and you need to come in because your name is there." If the guy goes, "What? My name? Are you sure? You want to check that?" "Yeah, your name is in here." He heads to the office. He said, "I don't have anything. I've been a dirt bag. I haven't lived up to the name. The past that I come from is not deserving of this at all." And yet, he can sit in that room. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to shout, "Praise the Lord." Good. &gt;&gt; How in the world did you How did you become part of this inheritance? &gt;&gt; How did you get this, brother Michael? How did you get this, brother Rap? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How in the world are you sitting in this room hearing your name in the book? &gt;&gt; You didn't deserve it. But he calls the guy and he sits there and he reads his name. And listen, you can't change the will. I'm in it whether I deserve it or not. God put me in this inheritance and everything. Brother Rabbit says everything that Calvary purchased belongs to every son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, it's just not portioned out like they do wills. It's everything that he purchased belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Healing, revival. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Healing for your mind. &gt;&gt; Joy. Glory be to God. Happiness. &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "Why are you so happy?" because I've got a right to be. I have a right to joy. I have a right to happiness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I didn't &gt;&gt; deserve it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Our resumes would never be good enough. He gave it because one reason I'm his son. We are taught by this world a couple things is that we work our way up the ladder. we work our way up to something or we believe that we're entitled to something. How many knows we live in a world of people being feeling entitled &gt;&gt; because I'm America and I'm entitled for the government to take care of me. &gt;&gt; Now, if there's a need, that's one thing. But people are living off it because of entitlement. &gt;&gt; I'm entitled to this. Didn't do anything to earn it. So, you have a problem with entitlement. Wonder if that creeps over into sometimes message believers that I, you know, hey, I get this because because I am a message believer. It didn't come through entitlement &gt;&gt; and it didn't because come because you worked your way up the ladder until you got it. &gt;&gt; So, this brings a feeling that we just we just we drop our head. &gt;&gt; We bow before him. &gt;&gt; It makes us humble. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's true humility because it causes us, the reason that we dedicate all of oursel back to God is because of humility. We're ready to give it all back to him. We're ready to turn our life over to him because of the gratefulness we feel. And when Josiah's first response to the hearing of the book is the Bible says he rent his clothes and he wept. So rent clothes in the Bible. To rent your clothes is to tear one's garment as a public and physical demonstration of intense emotions like grief or sorrow. It happened in the Bible when someone died. It happened when there was great sorrow. But it also happened because they needed to repent. They they were they were smitten by their sin. And so they go so just tear their clothes. I've got to make it right with God. I've I've got to I feel that. And and then the other thing is shock in life. Shock will make them do it. H we don't have a lot of people doing this today, but I'm not preaching for people to rent their clothes, but I'm preaching for them to find the same humility and brokenness. &gt;&gt; It was a symbolic act of brokenness that showed the inner turmoil of a person often accompanied by other signs of mourning such as wearing sackcloth or ashes. That was Job. I was thinking of Job this morning and that moment that they walk in and his all of his children are dead and he's a son of God. Try to explain that one. &gt;&gt; How is it that Job did not turn against his God and blame God for that? How in the world, you know, you've had a lot of things happen in your life, but I don't think any of you has had that happen where in a moment's time, your precious thing that you pray for all the time, the devil kills him and God gave him perm permission to do that. You can't explain a God like that. &gt;&gt; And yet, there's something there in him. He goes, he's he's in sorrow. He's renting his clothes, sackcloth, and ashes. But the Bible says in all this he didn't accuse God. &gt;&gt; Later he found out that God endorsed it. God allowed it. But in all of it he never cursed God even when his wife was telling him to do it. &gt;&gt; Just end it all. How how does that happen? I still just pondering that repentance and saw is renting of the clothes. it it's related to repentance and saw the practice was also used to express deep regret over sin such as when King Josiah tore his clothes after hearing the law of God being read which had been ignored by the people. So it's it's this soberness to the sin of his people that made him rent his clothes. God, where are we? What are we doing here? What's the state of the temple? There's all kinds of and I'll get into this in the next few weeks. There's all kinds of priestess of other gods. There's sodomite homes that have been built around the temple of God. There's priests of Baal. There's idols of Baal in the temple. They've kicked out the other things. And and and and and then so he didn't catch that soberness of where they were at until he heard the book and heard God's heart. You know what happened? He actually God had been getting angry over this. But guess what? Josiah begin to embody God's righteous anger. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many would raise your hand this morning and say, "May I so personalize this that if God feels it, I feel it." &gt;&gt; That I would be so sick of sin like God is sick of sin. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "You go into one of these gas stations in the bathroom in this gas station and the stench and the smell and he says that's what sin smells like to God." Well, that's fine. is to God. But what happens when it makes us just as sick as it makes God? &gt;&gt; And we're going, oh, and this is he embodied the the as he heard this book, he embodied the righteous anger is that something's got to be done. Let me get past this is that another reason for renting of closes humility and supplication. The act was a physical manifestation of a broken heart and a state of humility sometimes done to plead for mercy or judgment. So all that is related to renting your clothes to tearing your clothes and crying like he did. It was an intense emotional response sitting and hearing this book read. He felt it. He became connected with it. He was spiit smitten by how far the drifting of God's people reminds me of the quote brother says, "I want to live a life that the least little bit of grieving I've done to my Lord, I would recognize it right away." Can I get an amen? That's the kind of life to live. not we become numb to sin and numb to the fact that we're drifting so far away from God. Maybe we're still a son of God, but we're drifting. We're dabbling in all kinds of junk of the world and we shouldn't be doing it. But the problem is is we become numb to how far we are away. May I live a life that the least little bit of grieving of my Lord, I would know it right away. I would repent and get their temple back where it's supposed to be. Somebody ought to say, I know this is hard preaching this morning, but there's only one way to live from this open book, and that's a life completely dedicated to him. &gt;&gt; And that we humble ourselves &gt;&gt; when sin is so close to us. You know, just a personal note about this being caught in this place and just saying this as a personal note so you understand my side as a pastor and as a minister and I say this in ministers uh devotions when I speak to them and their wives. The place of struggle for a minister many times is you're sitting here with this word so powerful and you catch a vision of where this word can take the people's lives. &gt;&gt; It's overwhelming. &gt;&gt; Not me, but you're looking at the vision of this word and you catch the vision where this can take people. And then you look at the people's lives &gt;&gt; and you just see, oh God, how do I get them from here to over here? &gt;&gt; How do I get them to see the vision? They're living below their privileges. &gt;&gt; They're living in their past. They're the devil's got them beat up for their past. They're living way below where they should be. Their marriage is nowhere near where it could be. This word, &gt;&gt; this word has power in it &gt;&gt; to make us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; And that's the struggle because, you know, because we got our own human weaknesses and we're trying to tie that together. And a pastor really has to have grace because he'll sit and watch the sheep for years. And sometimes it takes years. Why couldn't they get it that Sunday? Why can't Why didn't they respond? There was there was there's the answer right there. And a pastor has a lot of patience. The evangelist doesn't sometimes. &gt;&gt; That's why he's not called to be a pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's going to get them all saved and full of the Holy Ghost in one night. &gt;&gt; And then he's going to leave town and leave the rest of the pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But guess what? We need the evangelist. &gt;&gt; God put him in the G body. &gt;&gt; We need that to shake us &gt;&gt; of the state that we're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for letting me share that. But to see the vision and to see where people are, it comes becomes a little bit discouraging because you see the potential of where this word can take us. It's amazing. You know, Josiah who was already king, he already had that position, but nothing was moving in his heart. There was no action. There was no action to take for the temple. He was comfortable in his place as a believer, but he had no feeling or heart in it until the book was read to him. Until the book became open to him. And when that happened, all of a sudden, it brought a feeling. It brought a sensitivity. It brought tears to his eyes. He was moved by the condition. He was convicted by the con the conviction that came with reading the book. It wasn't just he came to church. It wasn't just the book was mechanically being read. It wasn't just the pastor reading the Bible and we're good. There was a conviction that came with it. There was a feeling that come with it of the state that the temple was in at the state that the country was in. Didn't Didn't brother Brandon point us to Jeremiah where it says as an evidence of the Holy Ghost, go forth and mark them that are sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city. &gt;&gt; Put a mark on those &gt;&gt; because that's the ones nobody else really cares. But when we see this world, when we see the state it's in, when we see that we could be actually further along, it should move us to do something about it. And the first thing to do about it is to thoroughly repent. &gt;&gt; It moved him to a conviction. Joseph is saying, "I've been saying we're okay, but when reading this book, we're not okay. I've been saying I'm good, but we're not good. &gt;&gt; We need restoration. We need a supernatural God." Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; The word when it's doing its work, it is encouraging. And I'm glad it is encouraging. This word has an encouraging word to position sons and daughters that they can have the faith to believe in their position. So, the word will do its work in encouraging us. But the word is convicting as well. There's a soberness as well. Something in it would lead us to repentance. And that's not just when you first come to the Lord or the message. There's always something in this word to keep us sober and sensitive &gt;&gt; to where we're at. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, we're missing something &gt;&gt; because it not only raises up and I find I'm going to be honest, there's many conventions that's happened in this message that you can raise us preachers can raise the people in faith to a level that they can believe that they're sons and daughters of God. Nothing is impossible. I'm that's in this word as well because when a son of God sees his position, that really sees it by revelation. There's power when you recognize your position. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not against that type of preaching. But I've heard very little preach preaching about this part that there has to be a constant soberness that we are zealous to repent when we are wrong &gt;&gt; because you're not in your corporate. You're not in your new body yet. You're not in your word body yet. You're in a fallen body. Twothirds of you is still not born again and won't be born again. And so you're imperfect. You're broken. &gt;&gt; We are imperfect. We are broken. Subject to mistakes. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Because we get the message and we're taught we're sons of God. Doesn't become this superhuman being that we zap the devil and we're above everybody else. No. As humans, we are still broken, &gt;&gt; susceptible to mistakes. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I want to hear the the first response to this is he rent his clothes. He didn't say, "Glory be to God. I'm going to go do it right now." No, no, no, no. You rent his clothes because of the condition the temple was in. &gt;&gt; For those who are visiting this morning, I know this doesn't look like love, but I love you with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; I love you. What kind of crazy preacher would stand up here and preach to you like this? &gt;&gt; Unless it be the love of God. I don't even know some of you. &gt;&gt; So, I don't have any agendas to hurt your feelings. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I know enough about the love of God that he he gives us all that we need. &gt;&gt; And it's God that leads us to repentance. I'm just going to say a few things before I wrap this up. Maybe wrap it up. I don't know. &gt;&gt; You know, go ahead and before I go to this, go ahead and pull that quote up. I have one quote today of brother Brandham. And I just found this last night. I wasn't going to put us in this service, but I thought it was interesting how and this is in a prayer talking about what comes out of this open book. What comes out of seeing your name and in the name of Jesus Christ, they are yours. They are love gifts of the gospel. They're memorials of the message tonight. Speaking about the people in front of them, your great presence with us. Put their names on the lamb's book of life there. Lord, we pray that each one of them will be there as your children, your beloved. So there he speaks of it wasn't just here at the altar. Their names are in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; That's a special group of people. But what comes out of that revelation of knowing that, and he says this next, fill them with the Holy Spirit of God into their hearts. May their lives be so charged with the power of the almighty God. Stop right there. If we leave the rest of the quote, we're going to get a certain impression about being charged by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Take the sword. &gt;&gt; Well, there's a certain truth to that. But I just wonder how the prophet discerned power in charged &gt;&gt; that humility and love and kindness &gt;&gt; and gentleness will flow from them. &gt;&gt; That's saying everything I'm preaching to you this morning. You know, I could have just read that and sing, take the name of Jesus with you and that's it. That's what my wife says. You know, she how do you write a three or four minute song and preach a sermon in a 4-minute song and you preach for an hour and a half because you preach a sermon in a song. She says, "How can you do it there, but you can't do it in church?" And I say the same answer every time. I don't know, but I enjoy doing both. I could have just read this. He preached everything. What flows? What's the response out of the book being opened to us? &gt;&gt; What's the power? What's the What's the charge with the power of Almighty God? Well, it better not be missing these elements &gt;&gt; or there's something desperately wrong with our interpretation &gt;&gt; of the Lamb's Book of Life being open. Because if I'm seeing in the message things other than this that's coming from the revelation of the book being open, &gt;&gt; there's a problem. &gt;&gt; I should get more amens of that. There's a problem. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. &gt;&gt; Because what I see coming out of it is this humility and love and kindness and gentleness will flow from them. And guess what? Also a zeal to see others saved. &gt;&gt; That that was once their condition. Anybody who's come from a condition and God has redeemed you ought to have a humility to say, "This is not just for me. I understand the condition they're in and my love reaches out to them. I'm going to share this with them. I'm going to testify of it. I'm not going to be us for no more in the message walls. I'm going to say, "Oh, I'm just going to preach to the bride." No, no, no. You don't know who bride is. And if God has given you the greatest message that's ever hit the face of the earth, why would you want to keep it to yourself? &gt;&gt; What is this? innocent wants to keep it to ourselves &gt;&gt; and say us four and no more. &gt;&gt; No. May we flow with love and humility, but may we have a zeal to see others saved. Can I get an amen this morning? May we have a zeal to see others saved because we were once in their condition. Grant, Lord. How many would say, "Grant, Lord." &gt;&gt; Say it loud. Grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. That's what flows from this seeing your name in the book. That's what flows. &gt;&gt; And this renting of clothes, you don't see a lot of this today. A real renting of clothes of repentance and anger at our condition. You don't see a lot of deep regret for sin where it goes beyond the feeling of feeling bad for what you did in your mistake. Oops. Shouldn't have done that. Sorry, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not repentance. &gt;&gt; Put a patch on it and say, "Okay, let's just get over this now." That's not what I'm talking about. I wonder if this world has taught us to be numb towards the the fruits of sin. I wonder if this world has taken the hard edge off of the damage sin can cause in our own lives. Or maybe we can see the damage of sin in all of our family members and we can easily preach to them, &gt;&gt; but we can't see the damage of sin that can hit us too. &gt;&gt; We become numb because we're believers, right? We're sons and daughters of God. We're above sin. We can even quote and say, "I have not sinned." Only by the revelation that he we are are sinless before how he looks us because of Calvary. I rejoice in that. &gt;&gt; But in your flesh, you're not sinless. The Bible teaches lining that revelation up that we are sinless before him and lining your body up to be under submission to that res revelation. &gt;&gt; But the truth truth is when you line it up and you bring it under subjection to him and you keep under your body as Paul said, you always have the tendency to get off track &gt;&gt; your mind, your thoughts. &gt;&gt; I just feel like preaching right now. We are living in a day where as Josiah seen prostitute houses built next to the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Our phones are the closest thing to us. &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to tell you that that's the time we live in that that instrument. Brother Paul, you going to tell us to get rid of our phones? Absolutely not. I'd like to &gt;&gt; and I would make if you'd make the commitment, I'd make the commitment. You said, "Well, how are we going to function?" Well, we somehow did it before without phones, &gt;&gt; but it's not making a phone call to somebody. It's all the other trash. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be honest with you this morning. A few months ago, they put me on this I don't have any of those things. I tried one one time uh the the Twitter or the tweet or whatever it is, and I made a couple of posts and had some response and then I lost interest and that was it. So I don't I even Stevie, my blessed nephew, you know, was making fun of me. Oh, you're on you're on social media now. You know, I didn't think you believed in those things. I said, I really don't. And it's not because I just Anyway, they put me on this Snapchat and I'm gonna be real honest with you. I love it because they send personal things of all my grandkids constantly every half hour, you know, sometimes more. And I love it, you know. Oh my. Oh, my heart is warmed just, you know, this is so great. What What did uh Jim Jim say to me last night at the restaurant for the birthday party there? He said, he said, "If I had known the grandkids were this much fun, I would have just skipped my kids and went right to the grandkids." I said, "Amen" to that. This is what it's for, you know, and it's it's great. You know, you get to see them, but then there's this there's if I have my phone, I'll show it to you. And I told a young man in the church about he got his phone for the first time. I said, "This is my experience here. This to the right side is this other thing that you click on and it goes through these reels." &gt;&gt; So, I did I went on there. So now I'm going through and there's advertisements on there and there's all this thing that I'm a little bit of a sucker for because oh this is you know how many steps do I got to do it per day and all this other stuff. So I'm reading this so what medicine do I need to take next? But but then then something comes up and it slips through &gt;&gt; and it's an indecent dressed woman &gt;&gt; and it sends a clear message of adultery or cheating &gt;&gt; or some vile thought and then all of a sudden it's a cuss word dropping the fbomb. Right. &gt;&gt; So, it must happen where we enter a place that we're having to like find the sandwich in the garbage can. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to be honest with you now. And this is I'm not preaching at you. I'm preaching at me. I'm telling you this become a temptation because you're wanting to see the good stuff. But then the way that we're built, &gt;&gt; the way that a man's eyes are built, the way that the man's mind thinks and emotional and the woman's more emotional, but the man is still has thirst within him for something to fulfill. And the eyes and that's the woman in Proverbs appro appealed to the man, the harlot woman by the way she dressed. She dressed like a harlot. She drove scantily. So that appealed to his eyes. And then she made her bed and got the bed ready for him. So that appealed to his desire for sex &gt;&gt; and but that wasn't it. I told the men's meeting a few weeks ago I said then the third thing she says is come together and let us take our soloulless together &gt;&gt; and soloulless is an emotional need. Let's fill one another emotionally. Now how can that be happening to a man? Because we know the women is more emotional but a man has emotional needs too. And if a man feels like that's not being met in in that thirst in his wife, he will have the temptation to go to that woman who says, "I'll even fill that emotional need." &gt;&gt; So, she's hitting on all three things in the thirst in a man. &gt;&gt; And she's called the strange woman. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's true. &gt;&gt; You know why she's the strange woman? Because it's any other woman other than your wife. Say, "Brother Paul, I'm not married yet. You have a wife somewhere." &gt;&gt; So, still, any other woman than that wife that's coming is the strange woman in the book of Proverbs. You shouldn't look at her. You shouldn't text her. You shouldn't make communication with her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because that devil anointing her knows exactly how to appeal to a man. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going through this. I'm going, "Wow, this is this is some vile stuff." So right there, I'm at that thing that the Holy Ghost in me is saying, "This ain't right. I'm feeling convicted. I'm feeling condemnation." Your flesh is saying, "Probably like it does." But you know what? I've got to go through some of that so I can get to some of the other good things and the funny things &gt;&gt; because we're built in the way that if something comes across and it makes us laugh, &gt;&gt; it kind of numbs us and makes us feel relaxed and oh, that's so funny. And I'll even show my wife and she'll show. That's so funny. That's so funny. But but we're a bit trapped because you see now our minds are built that we flip through something real quickly. But our minds are built that we caught it. &gt;&gt; And I told the men a few weeks ago, I'll tell all of you, if you don't understand how you're built as a human being, and the devil does, &gt;&gt; you're in trouble. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you don't know how God made your mind and your brain, &gt;&gt; and the devil has studied it for 6,000 years, &gt;&gt; the devil will have an advantage over you. Even if you're a Christian, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm being honest with you. &gt;&gt; It'll appeal. You're going to be tempted. You're going to be It wants to trap you. And so, it's like, okay, you can't drag your soul and spirit through all of that just to get a nice nice relaxing moment. You can't do it. &gt;&gt; I told a story when I first moved to Toledo. I was single and I don't have a clue why I'm telling all this this morning, but I know I'm just trying to follow the leading of the Lord because I I hate the devil and his works to keep people from their potential of the sons and daughters of God they can be. We have been given the greatest message that's ever hit planet Earth. And your potential to be a son of God standing in your position is all here this morning. He's provided everything. But the devil is making you wander off into something that's not your position. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I had to go down through the inner parts of Toledo. I I was getting something downtown. And this the first time I ever experienced this this real. And so I stopped at a stoplight and over there was what I as I looked at it learned to be a prostitute. It was a prostitute. and these areas of I guess it was that area. I probably shouldn't have been in that area, but anyway, I told the brothers in my church, I was honest with them at a prayer meeting. I said, "Listen, I can tell you." And she's over there and she's going, you know, she's going and she's pointing she's pointing to her apartment upstairs and she's inviting me to come and I'm stopped at a stoplight and I'm I'm I'm stuck there. I'm looking over at her and and and I was honest with her brothers to say I have to say my first thought was not a godly thought. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's a shame to say that. &gt;&gt; It should have been godly. Should have been bless God. And yet I did get out of there. That was, you know, I didn't even I didn't even go any further. But my first thought was not a good one. &gt;&gt; What could this be? The curiosity. I'm a single man. &gt;&gt; Never had sexual relations before. She's inviting me up there. She's scantily dressed and, you know, appealing to a young man who's never been with a woman. Probably like Joseph's situation with Pover's wife. And it's like my first thought wasn't that. It's because that's the way we're made. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if the devil does, you see, if I'd have been more versed and later on in the car, I thought of it. Not right away. If I'd have been really like I should be with some people say, "Holy Ghost, my first thought is that there's that strange woman and she's got that house up there out of book of Proverbs." And this is an exact scenario to that. &gt;&gt; Should have been my first thought, a word thought, right? &gt;&gt; Word believers. &gt;&gt; But I'm here saying in front of the whole world looks like now. &gt;&gt; But that was not my first thought. &gt;&gt; But thankfully, it wasn't going very it didn't go very far. And something from the inside reached up, &gt;&gt; pulled me into place. &gt;&gt; And I didn't have a wife then. So, you know, it's just like sometimes it's it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; It's still damaged. And you have to have a soberness to sin &gt;&gt; like God does. &gt;&gt; You have to have a vision to say if I were to take steps towards that now, I got a vision of the destruction &gt;&gt; after that one act. &gt;&gt; They don't look at it's just the pleasure for one moment. And I could hide it. Nobody would see it. I could go on with my church. I had started Bible study. I had started the church. I could go on. Nobody would know about it. Joseph could have had relations with Pontifer's wife and kept it quiet. &gt;&gt; But you know what he said to her before he ran? Bible says he ran. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; How can I do this sin against my God? &gt;&gt; That's without the Holy Ghost. Now, &gt;&gt; it wasn't about hurting her husband, which you can think of that. &gt;&gt; It wasn't hurting her, hurting his reputation. It it was higher than that. How can I do this sin against my God? &gt;&gt; It's going to break relationship with my God. It's going to bring condemnation. I may not ever feel as close to God again. I don't know. &gt;&gt; But that's without the Holy Ghost what he thought. We should hate the smell of the world and the vileeness of it &gt;&gt; just like God does. &gt;&gt; Can I Can I have Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Is that Lily? Thanks for the amen, Lily. Now I'm gonna preach another half hour because you gave me that amen. Praise the Lord when you got a child saying it. &gt;&gt; Can I say Can I say some things, brother Paul? You haven't yet. If we claim that this book of redemption has been opened, why do we have so much pride that's in our circles? If we're the people of the open book, why do we have things that produce persecution of other churches even in our own ranks? Why do we have preachers putting down other preachers because they have a different ministry or different vision for their own people? Why do we have that? Does that come out of the open book revelation? Or unless we do it their way at that church or preach it their way the way their new group is doing it, then we're not right and we're not in the bride's revival and that's that that's going on with their group and we need to join it. If you don't join it, you must be a cold formal church and you must not be catching the revival. &gt;&gt; If they feel like that we're not in or we don't have their revival, then why not pray for us? If you feel like I'm not in and I haven't caught your revival, why aren't you praying for us &gt;&gt; that we get it &gt;&gt; instead of bash us &gt;&gt; and procelite people in our congregation to come to the place? That's very good. &gt;&gt; I've seen this cycle go through that this group, this is, you know, 30, 40 years ago, 40 years ago. This group in the message, I wouldn't give the name. It was on the west and they grew large, had a prominent, well-known ministry, a famous minister. I appreciated the minister. His ministry went around the world world and he could preach and the congregation grew very large. And then you start to hear this is the only place to be. How do I know they said that? Because they said it to me. This is the only place to move. This is the only place to be. And really there's only about five places in the entire message. If you're going to get it right and hear the preaching right, it's got to be in our circle. And there's four or five others. And you know, there's hundreds of faithful pastors around the world &gt;&gt; with smaller churches. &gt;&gt; They don't have this dimming, this d uh classy ministry, this gifted person. But every Sunday and every Wednesday, I have friends now. I probably have more friends that are the faithful no-names in our ranks that have been doing this for 30, 40, 50 years. I believe they're going to receive a reward on the other side. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we judge things by who's the international ministry and who's this and and then they're bashing other ones and belittling and we must have the the the superior re where's the superior attitude come with your superior revelation. Where does that belong? Does that come out of this book? I'm even asking the question. I don't want to preach against. I'm just saying does that kind of attitude come out of the opening of this book? &gt;&gt; I don't see it. And I would say to all of you that are listening is that if that would continue on, you don't want to have your family feeding on that type of spirit. It's not the word that's there. It's the type of arrogant spirit that goes with it. &gt;&gt; So you need to pray and find a place that expresses all of the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I'm not saying here, but find a place where there's a humble even brother Brandon says if a a Holy Ghost boy wanted to find a right girl, he'd have to go to some come to some small little hol church and find a Holy Ghost fil girl. He didn't say go to all the big stuff. He said just keep looking for that simple, humble, Holy Ghost fil girl. &gt;&gt; It's not all about looks. No. &gt;&gt; Why? There's only five places. And if you come to our place, you will be on the map with the rest of us because we're on the map now. What is all this? What is all this? And nobody else will say it. So, I guess that please don't be offended, but I'm going to say it. Is this what comes out of the opening of the greatest the book of redemption? is the denominational division that comes among us. Is that what comes out of the open book of redemption &gt;&gt; superiority and this church is better than the other church and we've reached a plateau that everybody needs to go. You need to hear our pastor. And friends, listen, I don't believe that that's forming the people of the open book. &gt;&gt; We are the people of the open book. And the people of the open book are not expressing another denomination, another superior attitude, but expressing the true real spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not compromising. I don't believe in compromising. &gt;&gt; But we are all broken. And that's the the word I keep bringing you back to broken together. If we come not in arrogance, but in humility, if we'll come together and be broken. I'm going to talk about that at communion tonight. Broken together. Because brother Brandham says Jesus died not of the spear. He died of a broken heart. There's something about us remaining broken and humble before him that we keep ourselves in a place for more revelation, &gt;&gt; for more of the move of God. &gt;&gt; But when we take the precious message and we become arrogant with it, we're getting off track. &gt;&gt; And they said, "You don't need to be at this church." The people who left that church, they said, "You'll come back. Everybody will be back here. Large place. And I thought after 40 years ago that we'd kind of learned not to build up ministries like that and not to have that attitude with one particular ministry. I thought we learned. But we're still having it. We still have it. &gt;&gt; A prominent very famous minister and and it's like this is the place. We're on the map now. This is the place to be and procelite others and you need to come here. And when that minister died, when those ministers die, the prominent ones, they look for the next prominent preacher in the message. They're big preacher followers. The next place they move is to follow the next big preacher. You need to move where that fella is your pastor &gt;&gt; and his gift is feeding your family and your family is growing. It's just that simple. You don't look over the whole internet and say, "Well, who's the most? Who's growing the biggest and who's the prominent?" And that's the next place I move. You better pray about it &gt;&gt; and find for a real God-called man that's going to pastor your family. &gt;&gt; Why do we make celebrities in the message? Is that what comes out of this book? Is that the people that comes out of this book of redemption? We make celebrities. We have elitism in the message. Elitism. I looked it up. It's not just a political philosophy. That's what they say. It's a political philos. Elitism is not just a political philosophy. It's a spirit. Do you know what it is? I'm glad you asked. Elitism is the attitude and behavior of a person or group who regard themselves as belonging to an elite. Elitism is the notion that individuals who form an elite, a select group with desirable qualities such as intellect and wealth or power or fame or physical attractiveness, notability, special skills, experience, lineage. This form of elite are more likely to be constructive to society and deserve greater influence or authority because they are the elite. Select persons or select groups who have superior superior qualities. That's elitism. And we have a a temptation for that. When we are the group who's been blessed to see the greatest opening of the word, we have the greatest tendency to become proud with it. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; To whom much is given, &gt;&gt; much is required. I've always read that scripture saying, you know, much is given, much is required that we give more or we give more money. No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Let's let's think about character. &gt;&gt; The more people are blessed to whom much is given. How many would raise your hand and say much has been given to your life &gt;&gt; through the Lord, through the message, much has been placed in your hands. And to whom much is given, then much character &gt;&gt; is required &gt;&gt; to carry it. &gt;&gt; People come in the environment of pride and makes them feel better to find they're in the right group now and every other church is wrong but their own. They become super spiritual themselves because they're attending the right place that have so many of this and so many signs. And I'm not against that. But if it brings pride and boasting and pointing to the minister of just that church, that's not what should be produced in this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We lift up certain ones, they get lifted up. And ministers learn, we ministers can learn how to work a crowd into an emotional frenzy. You know why I say that? Because I know how to do that. &gt;&gt; You preach a lot for this many years, you can choose one thing. you can get the mind of the Lord and settle down. And if you don't feel any amens and there's not a lot of motion, you stand there flatfooted and you bring the word because it's not you that's doing it. It's the word that's doing the work. &gt;&gt; And he's here to do that. &gt;&gt; But me as a minister, I can step out of that because I've learned how to work a crowd. I've learned to work the crowd up to an emotion. And some of our young ministers have learned to do that. And I think it becomes a trap to those who are listening because they can get caught up in that. But my question is, does it become symbolism over substance? &gt;&gt; They become skilled at it. They're using quotes. He's preaching about the open book and it brings us power, but it has no power to conquer his pride. and he becomes on a head trip until they can't apologize when they're wrong. &gt;&gt; They might preach something that's wrong and they can't apologize. May God help all of us ministers &gt;&gt; to have the humility that when we say something wrong, we get up and make it right. &gt;&gt; They preach something. If they prophesy something that's wrong, Brother Bam taught us you need to repent of that &gt;&gt; or you have an evil spirit working. Well, it doesn't seem like an evil spirit. Oh, it's a No. If you prophesied something wrong and said it was the Lord, you need to make it right. &gt;&gt; And a revelation of the open book, I believe, will bring that type of humility. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's a personal burden of mine that I carry. And all of it is to say a people of the open book should not have fruits like this. And I'm not preaching against others. I'm preaching at us too this morning. The people of the open book should not have fruits that I've described, but a broken spirit that trembles in humility, fearful to say anything against anyone in a demeaning way. &gt;&gt; May God give us the reverence and respect that we would bite our tongues to say anything from your wife or husband to the preacher. May God put the fear of the Lord in our hearts and in our tongues that we would not say anything in a demeaning way against someone else. Let us see the first response from a real evidence that the book has been open to us. And the first response is a personal humility and repentance to see a true revival. And this is why I'm preaching this. I want to see a true revival in our lives. &gt;&gt; Would you raise your hand? I want a true revival in my heart. I know this book brings a revival, but I want the true one. &gt;&gt; I want the true one that has the fruit of passion for God's temple, a love for God, a love for one another, looking at ourselves first and not judging everybody else and saying, "It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not my brother, not my sister, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not the deacon, not the pastor, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. What's the next verse? Not my father or my mother, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not my sister, not my brother, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. It's me. It's me. It's me. Oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord. Standing in the need of prayer. So Josiah, the next thing he says after he rins his clothes and repents in tears, he says, "You men go to the prophetess." cuz that's the one that was the connection in that day. And I want you to ask her what she thinks of my desire now to do this and clean the temple and all this. Will God in this book I hear the judgments of God are on our people? But he's asking can there be something done? And he sends those men to the prophetess and you read it in your Bible next. She says the judgment stands. Israel will fall. They came in like a a hundred years later. Babylon came in, destroyed the temple, destroyed it, took all the vessels back to Babylon, took the young children. Judgment was coming. How many know in this nation judgment is coming in this world. &gt;&gt; But she said, she said, "Because you rent your clothes." Well, how did that prophet know? Cuz God knows that he rent his clothes. Because judgment's coming, but because you rent your clothes and you had brokenness in your tears and in your heart, I will give you a revival in your time. The people, you, the temple, whatever is on your heart to do, there'll be a personal light shine and a personal revival. Even though judgment was coming, you'll have your own connection to me. Hallelujah. That makes me feel good, friends. that repentance and renting of clothes and humility can get. He said, "I want a personal l word from the Lord. I hear the Bible, but I want a personal word from God's messenger. I need to know, will God give me a revival?" And she said, "Yes, because of your humility. &gt;&gt; I will give you that revival. &gt;&gt; It's me. It's me. It's me." Oh, stand together if you would. Standing in the need of prayer. Okay, it's too high. It's a little too high. I got it too high. It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord. Standing in the need of prayer. It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord. Standing in the need of prayer. Not my father or my mother, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not my sister, not my brother, but it's me, oh Lord. Oh, standing in the need of prayer. Lord, it's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord. Standing in the need of prayer. It's me. It's me, it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. We have another verse. Not the deacon, not the pastor, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not the deacon, not the pastor, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Yes, it's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord. standing in the need of prayer. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Can we bow our heads and close our eyes? Maybe lay your hands on your person next to you and pray for them. You know that song, Kenny? Unworthy. Unworthy a beggar in bondage and alone. But he made me worthy. And now by his grace, his mercy made me. How many feel unworthy this morning of his grace? One more time before we pray. Unworthy. Just tell the Lord unworthy. A beggar in bondage and alone. But he made me worthy. And now by his grace, his mercy ordained me is all. Can we take a moment and lift our voices to him in humility? Pray for one another. Heavenly Father, we lay our hands on our brothers and sisters. Lord, we're sobered by your word this morning. We're a grateful, privileged people. And we want to express it and thank you, Lord. I feel privileged that I could be a part of your kingdom, that I could be in your mind before the foundation of the world. Lord, may I never take it for granted. May I never get a numbness to me that I forget what you've done for me. and Calvary and called me by name. May I never forget it. Lord, I truly say to you that we are undeserving and unworthy of this great gift that you have given us. But Lord, you made us worthy. You made us be able to accept it because Lord, you've seen us from the foundation of the world. Lord, may we have a heart that says, "Thank you, Lord, for that. I'm grateful for that. Lord, may it bring such a condition of the hearts and temples of the people that in the coming weeks, Lord, there'll be such a a true stir and revive on our hearts, Lord. A true thing, something that's beyond just religion, Lord, or something beyond a message status quo condition and change our hearts. Lord, make us what you want us to be. Father, I pray, we're sorry, Lord, for what we turn this into. Can the congregation agree with me and say, "I'm sorry what I turned this into. Let me not do that. Let me leave it what it is and let me believe it the way that it is." May you humble my pride, Lord, and answer our craving and need today, Lord, for what we need. Grant it, Father, every heart. May you prepare our hearts for the Lord's supper tonight as we remember that and enjoy that. Thank you, Father. Make our hearts broken before you, sensitive to you. We pray in Jesus name we ask. And everybody said, "Amen." Amen. Praise the Lord. Coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it. It's all about you. Well, it's all about you. One more time. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. It's all about you. Well, it's all about you, Jesus. And I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made it. It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. God bless you. We love you all. I appreciate your attention to the word today, to his presence, and that one who's among us is greater than anyone. I know we have a lot of sobering things to been presented to chew on today, but I trust you take them home with you. Amen. Just shake hands with somebody.
