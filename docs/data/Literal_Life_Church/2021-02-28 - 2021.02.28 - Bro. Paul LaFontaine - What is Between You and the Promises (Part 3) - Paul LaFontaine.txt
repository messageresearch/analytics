========================================

praise the lord uh we actually did not have any prayer requests today so that's a good thing i'm sure people have unspoken requests perhaps over the internet they do and i got a testimony we were my wife and i were listening to a tape last night and brother branham was saying that when people come in our presence they should be feel thirsty they should be drawn to the lord and i thought lord i don't think that's the way it is with me and so i i just pray that i can have that kind of walk that people would be drawn to him just by by meeting me so let's uh let's pray lord jesus we do thank you for your blessings lord the freedom you've given us to worship here today for this new church you've given us we pray now that you'll see these unspoken requests these hearts they're longing for you and may you grant the request by your power in jesus name amen you can be seated we've got a missions report today and it's from malawi there you go and not long ago we had a brother contact us that wanted to give 50 50 to 50 families in very poor country so i contacted brother alfred fury you can go to the next slide who lives in the cotta bay there and he years ago he had moved from like the long way up there to be with the people that he ministered to and he said he got stuck there so he's ministered there for years has about nine churches with the very poor people but the brother but the alpha told me that some people are so poor they can't even afford salt you know they just have no cash because there's they just live off of the land so that worked out well and and in talking to brother alfred i asked him how many people don't have bibles and he said well most people don't have bibles because the bible costs 14 and that might be a month's wage for some people or half a month wage so he asked for about over 300 bibles and you go to the next slide and uh so these are some of the chechua bibles that he purchased and he was going to distribute among the believers the next slide there brother alfred is on the right with the pastor and his wife and uh you know some people have bibles but they're very worn and falling apart and this is the house of a brother here you can see the one on the left that is just grass roof sticks for the sticks for the walls so that's how poor people are next slide and there's the brother there so you'll see the next slide as you see people you'll see they they're dressed nice and but the opera said yes but they're they're impoverished at home go back and that's the brother standing there that we saw who was who was that was his home there you go and here's a brother who had he's so excited about getting the bible he's raising it up and the next slide you can see the one he's carrying is falling apart and so that's uh he had a bible but it was falling apart so go ahead brother alfred's with another pass from his wife go ahead another pastor and his wife husband and wife at least there you go there's a sister who's happy to receive her bible these are nice bibles too go ahead some young people there you go and this is a group of people mostly young people and if we zoomed in you see most of them have bibles there you go there's a group of ministers who got bibles go ahead there you go that's the brother he's so excited it's a lot the people are lined up to get their bibles there there we go and that's one of the churches we built was a year before last now and uh with the people in the church and who received many many of them he said that this church i think 93 needed bibles go ahead and one of the staples there is cassava which is a the root of a tree and here's very experienced what cooks prepare it because if you don't prepare it right it's got cyanide in it and it can be fatal but here she's grinding the flower grinding it up into a flower making it there you go cooking it over the fire speaking of getting our kitchen ready this lady was using her kitchen one more and they're her children finishing it up okay one more i think this is the video clip of the sisters [Applause] [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Laughter] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] and he'll distribute him to the rest of his churches and if he has any left over about 350 actually and he'll distribute those and so if you want to contribute you can just put it on your envelope and say malawi bibles and a couple of three weeks we'll send the funds over and uh and be a blessing this is fun i think hey lord bless you thank you [Applause] please god [Applause] so we're going to try to send some more money for more they have a great a bigger need than that what they got okay between you and the promises hebrews chapter four verse 1 let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it when he says this fear it's not being afraid it's it's a reverence it's a respect it's a it's kind of a jolting sobering feeling let's have a sobering feeling because it is a major thing if we come short of the promises it's probably the most important thing as a christian that we inherit our promised land and our promises and so let us be sober to the fact of anything that would come in between us and the promises you can do a lot of things in life you can have a lot of pursuits but us christians taking a hold of all the promises is priority it's everything so if he says let's be sober and fearful that we come short of the promises there must be some influences that will try to take us away from that and so we must be very sober about that thing is that i don't want to come short of the promise for unto us verse 2 was the gospel preached as well as unto them he's referring to the children of israel unto us was the gospel preached as well as under them but look at this the word preached did not profit them can you imagine now listening to preaching from moses and from moses was from god can you imagine the listening all through the wilderness moses preaching from god and all the time it didn't profit them can you imagine sitting every service and hearing preaching true preaching and it didn't profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so how important it is that we have faith in the word of god we're hearing it has to be mixed with faith now i read chapter four and verse one that which talks about being short of entering the promises i would like to go back and put this on our minds because this is what we're studying out of today of things get between you and the promises and if we go back to chapter 3 and verse 7 then we find and hear some of the things that we'll speak on today that would be hindrances or things that come between the promises the children of israel many of them did not go in and here's some of the things listed as to the reasons why the children of israel did not go into the land of promise verse 7 wherefore as the holy ghost today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brother lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin it's the second time we hear the term harden harden hearts hardened for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end while it is said today if we will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation let's pray precious lord jesus we are thankful lord that our brother and his family has ministered and song to us we pray that you'll bless them along their way for coming and ministering to us today we are thankful lord to be in your house to be able to give our hearts freely lord we're thankful to have a safe place lord we don't know how much longer our liberties will be given to us to meet and worship freely but today we have them and we're grateful for them and we come to worship with all of our hearts we come lord with a hunger for you feed us from your eternal word strengthen the body of jesus christ and come lord and walk in this place lord we don't we know you don't walk in in your body that you had two thousand years ago but because you rose the third day you're still alive and you can walk up and down these aisles today lord and you can be here among us if we would just welcome you and we do welcome you father to come and walk in our hearts to speak to us lord to break down our barriers that we can trust you lord and feel safe that what you would tell us is going to be for our good bless and help us to today as we spend this day and bless the lord's supper as we gather this afternoon bless the entire day lord as we start the week this way god i just pray you'll bless it and bless the weak we commit this service to you in what said in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen god bless you may be seated now i know that in our uh type in the book of joshua in the type of what we're talking about the people going in and taking the land of promise that god had promised to abraham isaac and jacob and we have been speaking about that type in joshua and we do know that in the land of promise there if the enemy was squatting upon the land that god had given to israel so before they could have their land they had to push back the enemy fight the enemy and move them back from their land and so that types our lives we know we speak of the enemy who is against us the devil who has that we're fighting against and so that was really what was between israel and them taking their promised land is the enemy was squatting on the land and so it would be easy then for us to say i'm fighting the devil and i'm fighting demons that are keeping us from keeping me from the promises of god and that is true that is that is ever so true but it would be easy to continue to say that and say that it's the devil and it's demons and i believe that today there is another dimension many people don't believe that but there is a another dimension besides the one that we see and it's just here in this room but it's in the the bible tells us that there are principalities and powers and demons that we are fighting against that we cannot see this morning and their agenda and their whole focus is to come against believers that are the coming one with christ that's the whole agenda of the demonic realm if you don't think there's a demonic realm you haven't been a christian very long because if you grow in the lord you know there's something fighting against me and there is a demonic realm the devil and his angels are fighting against the true believers and their position and i believe there's another dimension that's here this morning that is contaminated with unbelieving devils to try to cause us to disbelieve the word of god and disbelieve the promise that's yours can you say amen uh it would be i try to come back to this example if you were given an inheritance then you probably have some people in your life that's trying to back maybe lawyers that are trying to back you off and take you take the inheritance from you keep you from pursuing it there's always forces to keep you getting that money can you say man and if you wanted your money you'd have to fight many times in court to get your money so the other dimension is contaminated with unbelieving devils to try to cause us to disbelieve our promises and they are there to keep you away from your promises to fight you back from the revelation of who you are jesus said to peter thou art peter and he had just made a statement that thou art the christ the son of the living god and and jesus said thou art peter and upon this rock of revelation this revelation of who i am is what i will build my church upon the revelation of who jesus is and who you are is who this church is built upon the next thing that jesus says is the gates of hell shall not prevail against that personal revelation that shows us first of all first of all that the gate what the gates of hell are against what is the hell and demons against the gates of hell are against a person having a personal revelation of jesus christ but he said when you have a true revelation the gates of hell shall not prevail against you can you raise your hand this morning can you say thank god you may struggle and fight every day but jesus said with a true revelation the gates of ultimately won't prevail against you a revelation of jesus for your day and a revelation of your inheritances and promises that is what satan is against in christ the mystery of god revealed the prophet refers to the new birth as being what is the new birth what is the new birth what is the conversion it is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you that is what the new birth is it is a revelation of jesus christ not to the church not to a group not to a denomination but it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you and then later in the message he says all hell is against this teaching what teaching what teaching the teaching that you receive a personal revelation from god and the prophet refers to it he says not a church because a church can receive things from god a group can and all these other things but that's not what he's saying all hell is against what teaching not something that comes to a group all hell is against a personal revelation so so if nobody else was around and you received a revelation of christ and your position in christ hell is against this teaching all hell is against this teaching the forces against you is because of a revelation blessed be his name and that's what i said last sunday it's not that the devil is against your personality or doesn't like you personally can you say amen it's what you're carrying it's what's in you if god gives you a revelation he's going to fight against that teaching he's going to fight against that revelation he's going to try to block you from taking all the promises of it so it's personal isn't it so i know the devil and i said all that to say i know the devil is trying to keep us from it but there's something the prophet said that we should consider and that is that he said william branham said that his greatest enemy was himself and i think all of us could say that if a prophet can say that then all of us can say it as well so why am i saying that because we can make the enemy the devil all we want to which he is can you say man but if we keep pushing at the devil i'm fighting the devil the devil the devil we take an opportunity sometimes to dish it off all on the devil and ignore what we're personally not giving up and what's in between us and the promises a lot of what i will preach on and what the bible says is not so much the devil doing it himself but the devil using territory that you're still giving him to come in between you and the promises of god so i only say that to say the devil's fighting the devil is fighting the devil's eye but brother brahman says his greatest enemy was himself praise the lord don't get weak in your amens get stronger and if an amen don't come out maybe an ouch or maybe give me something to work with so we can put off all we want to on the devils are fighting with the demons are fighting you and and but when it's things that's in you that the devil is using as ground and taking ground the devil takes the ground the devil cannot do nothing unless he has something to work through the devil cannot do nothing except he has something to work with and territory that you keep giving up to the devil he's going to take it and he's going to use it now is it the devil is it demons yes it is but if you're yielding territory to him if there's a little slot of your life that you're not giving up he's going to say thank you thank you little demons are going to say thank you so much i'm just looking for some territory that i can get in there and torment because how many of those demons are tormentors thank you for giving us that area of your life for 20 years now you've yielded everything but this one or two areas and the demons say thank you for giving me this area i'll take what i can get and i'm going to wreak havoc and keep you from the promises of god so it's not all the devil as much as it is sometimes us not yielding things in our life that we're just not going to give to god completely and that's why i like the song jesus be the lord of all the kingdoms of my heart because in your heart you have many different areas and doors and kingdoms and someone can give lordship over all the other parts of their heart except a few but when you surrender to the lord you give it all to him my body becomes a living sacrifice and there are no areas that i rent out to the enemy for a few days or a few years every room every compartment every part of our thinking all of this vessel and you know we haven't done all that yet including myself we haven't yielded everything yet because we're all still here i think if we yield everything and find our position completely in christ brother brown says she'll take a rapture when she fully knows her position so we're all still here and it's proof that we still need to come to church and we still need to hear the word and we still need to yield can you say man and every once in a while you'll come to me and ask questions and get counseling and anybody who's learned my counseling is that i'm not going to ge on the surface i like to get to the real cause of the problem that's why through the years less and less people come to me because i want that for my own life and god forbid that i would require that of you and not required of my own life i'm asking lately lord what areas in my life because i teach the people we don't just hide our weaknesses and just leave them alone we tackle our weaknesses and say god is there air in any area that i'm being immature in is there any area that i haven't given to you yet so if i require that in counseling you and get into the nitty-gritty and just say but what about this and consider this i'm not trying to be mean i want us to be mature i don't want us to be surface people because the devil tends to hide in things that we don't want to yield come on now friends and so we're going to talk about that but but you see now we all have it and we've got to find those areas that are in between us and the promises we've got to narrow that down and we've got to expose the enemy and we've got to say lord i'm willing to give that up can you say amen and so that's why of course that i read second corinthians 7 1 the last couple services that it says having these promises let's cleanse ourselves from the filthiness of the flesh and spirit so in other words there's a sanctification in our own lives in order to take the promises of god demons have no power except we give them room somewhere to weaken us so there's no sense in us always saying the devil is the enemy when we're the enemy letting the enemy in the prophet said in the breach message he says you all have heard me say that people said the devil made me do this anybody ever heard that before anybody ever said it before don't answer that wasn't me at all the devil made me do it and he says you have heard me say the people said the devil made me do this no no no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in because when you're sealed in he is sealed out can i get an amen yeah see this is not a wishy-washy new birth this isn't just something that's just a up and down backslid one year and get back and forth to god that's not a new birth a new birth you're sealed in by the holy ghost god is sealed into your soul the devil is sealed out now he may plague your minds he may try to get in your flesh sometimes but as far as on the soul level you didn't completely seal him out by the holy ghost seal the devil out and seal god in you didn't get sealed up he is sealed out yeah and now now when you went out to him look at that you went out to him uh-huh he couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you notice the into you is to come through the same process that you have he would have to be the devil now he'd have to be saved sanctified and filled the holy ghost then he'd be your brother i don't want none of that he can't come that path no way he can come there but praise god we can this morning i said praise god we can come this justified sanctified sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost if you ain't got that in your life you ought to say just lord i need to be sealed by the holy ghost god bless you this morning go to god with that and so now then he'd be your brother so you see he didn't do it no no you just went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way over into canaan you see across the jordan the death to what the death to everybody say it self the death to self it's not the devil made me do it it's the death to self so this makes it personal personal while we talk on what is between you and the promises that's the subject that we're on so now i'm quickly jumping to the fourth point last sunday we dealt with three things that would keep us from the promises no repentance if we don't repent we're kept from the promise of the holy ghost because paul peter said repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for that promise is unto you and your children and to many are far off even as many as our lord our god shall call a lack of genuine repentance will keep you from the promises of god i could preach another couple weeks on just repentance friends a lack of real true repentance keeps you from the promises number two to remind you i talked about family and kindred getting in between you and the promises i can take another four weeks on that matter of fact i was people what i heard back in response is that was the point that really really ministered to them that family that kindred you wouldn't believe it family can be so nice family can be so great but be careful they don't come in between you and the promises of god abraham he said abraham come out from your dad come out from your kindred come away from your people so you can inherit the promise he had to separate from them in order to get a hold of god people don't like you to talk about that because they cling to just the emotion of family and the security of family but you see we need to cling to the lord we need to cling to his promises the priority can't be clinging to family you need to cling to the holy ghost i may not get many amens on that but there are people that are clinging to the security of only family and not to the lord you can't do that enjoy your family but cling mostly to the lord because they're not going to get you in a rapture they're not going to give you eternal life they'll support you they'll be with you through things of life and we love family i love to have family there's i'll remind you some people in this church have lost all their family they don't even have family to go to they have to cling to the lord praise the lord the third thing that i talked about is compromise compromise is what keeps us in between us and the promises number four we're continuing on today out of hebrews chapter three where he says verse eight the children of israel harden their hearts harden not your heart i want to talk about hardness of heart being what keeps is between you and the promises of god i want to talk about hardness of heart being something that is between you and the promises of god this is what israel become and i'd like to look at how do they become hard a heart that becomes hard is something that is between you and the promise of god something between you and a further relationship with the lord in israel's case they kept getting disappointed with god and it they were they kept getting disappointed with god not because god was necessarily disappointing them because if we really believe properly god never disappoints us in other words i should say that if we look at it through god's thoughts and not human thoughts god never disappoints god always answers prayer god always if we're praying for his will he gives us his will when we mature in the lord we're just as happy with god when he says no as when he says yes so a lot of us don't have that maturity yet because you got all mad because god said no but the children of israel put god kind of in a spot of tempting him because they got harder in their hearts because they kind of set themselves up for being disappointed in god and the problem is they were unfaithful so in other words they were very childish when they had a need in their life they were going to god say we ran out of food did we come out here to die moses did you bring us out to die god supernaturally provides that need so let's catch this now there are need centered people in other words other they only want god to meet their needs that's it and if you're going on that level of god meet my need god me my ear and it's only about that but you're not pursuing and seeking after the heart of god at all then you're going to set yourself up for disappointment because there will be times that it doesn't look like god's answering just the way that you want so you get disappointed in god i preach to a lot of people that have been disappointed in preachers disappointed on how things turns out disappointed in their upbringing and all of it's real i'm not asking you to deny that i'm just saying how many years are we going to go to view god in all of that in only one particular area we can't just seek after god in this area and our disappointment and he didn't come through or something happened wrong we've got to say but god what is your heart because i want to pursue your heart and the children of israel let me just read it so it's read like the bible says so you know i'm not just going on off here he says he says hard not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation and willingness when the fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works for forty years it goes on to say saw my works for 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in my heart and they have not known my ways here's the problem i want you to underline two things in your bible works ways works and ways the problem was why did they become heart hard hard-hearted because they only sought him to see his works but god is more than just his works is that okay with everybody god is more than just his works god is more than just what he can do for you god is more than just your carnal mind and how you perceive god let me say this god is more probably than most your parents and what they seen of god you with me god is so much more than what your parents presented to you as being god and so when we grow we say lord do i want to only seek your works or do i want to seek your ways works ways works ways in other words they didn't want to pursue the nature of god and find out what his heart really was they just wanted to dwell in the realm of his words and and and so they kept this being getting disappointed with god because they were tempting him i have a need lord would you do it and if you'll do it i'll be faithful i didn't realize i was hitting a subject to make things quieter and quieter and quieter lord i have a need and i wish you would do it and if you'll do it i'll be faithful to you that's the children of israel if it all works out just the way i've planned and you do it this way then i'll offer my commitment to you i'll give faith and i'll believe i'll trust in you you're talking about a land of promise somewhere that i have to believe for and take my promises but i'm not even there yet i'm just i'm just saying lord we don't have any food and we don't have any drink and we don't have this now there's serpents here and all these things popped up in life and they didn't got their mind on the promise at all the heart of god was the promise not life's difficulties not life's losses i'm not asking you to pretend that you haven't had life's losses no you've had them but god couldn't get the people to get their mind off of their losses and look what they were going to gain praise the lord lord i'll do it but i'll and if you do it i'll be faithful but guess what they didn't and sometimes god didn't do what he wanted that they wanted it's it's amazing thing in the in in the wilderness because he just provided everything they asked for multiple miracles but later they didn't trust the next thing they didn't trust moses they didn't trust the prophet they found something else on the internet to have a lack of trust in the profit god does mighty things mighty things but it isn't just a few days and they read on the internet and now they got a lack of trust in the prophet again i know i'm speaking to some of you don't forget i'm i'm a friend to you a few days they read something and now their faith is all i don't know where i stand moses no i can't trust you i want to be back to egypt i want to go back and then god would perform something and they get trust again and then within a few days they didn't have trust i'm telling you that's where they got their hardness of heart because we're made as human beings that if we keep doing that with god our hearts become hardened and hardened and hardened and we back off and we put our walls up and we have a lack of trust and we don't trust anybody anymore including god amen so i asked you to consider these things this morning they later they didn't trust they needed god to act to keep them motivated they needed another revival because they only viewed god in one way to do an act and to keep them believing and god did his part god did his part but they didn't do theirs to believe not being mixed with faith they heard the preaching but it wasn't mixed with faith confidence i believe this and i believe the promises are mine and if i run out of food i still believe this and if god disappoints me i still believe this i still want to take my promises that's what god had wanted to hear and you know i always tell it is that god got so tired of the complaining and the fussing and up and down for 40 years he heard this stuff and he got tired of it and he was tired of the people and said moses just stand back i'm going to swipe every one of them off the face of the earth i'm tired of it and christ was in moses saying lord you can't do that look at your testimony think of your testimony you're the one that raised these people up and gave them a promise you promised to do it you promised to abraham and you swore by yourself and so christ in moses is reminding god this is your people you can't destroy them he said all right i won't destroy him but some of them aren't going to go into the promised land because why no faith the preaching was not mixed with faith in them that heard it and i always like to say that god heard this complaining for 40 countless years he got so tired of it and they sent about 10 spies over there and god is just over in the corner and he's toast so tired and when they come back to view the promised land and said it is there the fruit is there everything god said everything god said through his prophet it's real and they brought back the evidence guess what what moses said the prophet it's true it's there there is a land there is promises i touched it with my hands hallelujah i felt it it's real what the prophet said is true brought back the evidence of it and god is sitting there listening it's true and he's wondering what are they going to do with it and oh 10 8 of the spies said but we can't take it because there's great giants in the land and there's the enemy and there's this and to be honest with you we looked like grasshoppers in the sight of these giants they looked at us like grasshoppers lord we felt like this there and they were like this and we're like this and your friends listen i just this is my narration of it but god after 40 years is saying what am i going to do with these people what in the world so it's all quiet like it is now and joshua and caleb said they they still the people they shut all those guys up every once in a while we get a joshua or a caleb in here and they correct us when we're negative might be your husband or your wife they correct us when we're off track they correct us when we're having a lack of faith joshua and caleb shut everybody up they still the people and i just don't think it was just as simple could i say something josh hello over here me i just don't think that's how joshua's still the people if you read later in the bible he's a great warrior he's not this quiet guy that's saying could i have the floor a minute no he's still the people shut up sorry i'm not supposed to say that to some parents that's a bad word it is what else can i say i'm stealing the people be still be quiet i don't want to hear any more of this what kind of people are you god promised abraham god promised isaac jacob joseph we were in egypt for all these years god sent us a prophet to take us out of egypt we've just come through a journey with god opened the red sea god provided water god provided manna god did mighty miracles and why do we have to hear when men come back that have tasted of the fruit why do we have to hear people still telling us it's not true and we can't do it and i want to make a proclamation i don't care what happens in our life i don't care if we lose food i don't care if the government takes everything away from us we have a promise and it's real and it's been spoken by a prophet the things spoken by this prophet if you're going to ignore them you're going to find out someday that it's real and it's true i would rather you believe it now that's my job is to woo you into a life of faith now not to find out on judgment day because you'll find out watched much too much evidence of it friends and so he says be quiet i want to say me and caleb want to say caleb you with me bud caleb stand up with me we're going to stand alone just the two of us and we're going to say we're well able to take the land amen i only have two of us but we don't care of this influence around the message we don't care of the post that's on the internet shut up right me and caleb want to see say we are well able to take the land amen that's right [Applause] i guess joshua was a little bit more loud than caleb i guess one more time buddy we are well able to take the land god has given us the land and we are well we are more than able to take it [Applause] praise be to god praise the lord i just felt like doing that take a minute can you say man i get it for two reasons to praise his name another reason i have room to do that now brother jigs has room now and the third reason i need the exercise don't say amen to that and i forgot god sitting here and when joshua and caleb said that his ears perked up what did i hear for 40 years i've never heard anything like that and it perked up god's attention perked up his his faith and his confidence somebody 2 out of 2 million had a statement of faith we believe this thing we've seen the evidence of it it's real and if nobody goes in i'm going in to take my land just says well praise my this is awesome i can work with that i can't work with complainers i can't work with gossipers they were in their tents all the time just little chit chat against moses against the message the chit chats or the chats against moses against moses against moses against this the quicker you stop listening to the voices the more faith you'll get i don't even have time for it got a legitimate sincere question we'll be glad to answer it but i don't have time for that we're way too far down the road praise the lord so god was tired of the complaining in one now he has two men that's fine he's hearing what he wants to hear he's hearing this is what i needed to hear for 40 years i can work with that i can take a people in i can help destroy their enemies i can give them what by that faith i can work with that faith can you say man you know what god's looking for in our lives not anything earth shattering amen a lot of you think what i've got to do this you're thinking about what you got to do i got to do this i got to do that and i got to get this and i got to do this and really what god needs is you to believe and have faith that's what he needs is where you need to start you need to believe and get all the doubt brushed away say lord give me a new birth give me a and give me more faith what's the man in the bible of jesus he said i believe but help thou my unbelief so if you believe already and you got some unbelief say lord purge out the unbelief purge all unbelievable burn it from my mind and my thinking to where i say i believe this gospel with all of my heart no if ands or but i don't know what to do yet i may not figure all this and i've got some bad seeds that i planted i got all that but right now i want to let the lord know whose side i'm on like the little lady old lady that stood in the line with all the soldiers with her guns and she had her broom in her hand standing with the soldiers and the general came down until he got down to this old lady and he said you can't fight in this army you're just an old lady i know i can't sir but i just wanted to let everybody know whose side i'm on i hope i can live a life that you know whose side i'm on but i want you to be there can you say amen and many of you are make you stand for jesus so the scripture i'm not getting very far today and yet we're making leaps and bounds so i'm still on point four that a hardness of heart can get in between you and the promises if you deal with god that way friends then your heart is gonna become hard over time god did his part but they didn't do theirs to believe no matter what happens whether god did miracles or not it reveals why here in texas the only one at his works he only knew his works they saw my works for 40 years but not his way knowing his works but not his ways that was the problem knowing the heart of god knowing the promised land is for you personally seeking the heart of god in his ways not just his works but his ways what are the ways of god god give us a heart that seeks his ways seeks his character seeks his nature not just one part of god can you say man we need people to seek the very heart of god not just one part of him if a person only wants to know god in one aspect then you will not always understand and you will be disappointed your heart will harden today people many many people choose what parts of the message they want they micromanage god they narrow him down to just a loving god that never corrects sin i just need god to be where i have him and when i need him and i need the parts that i need but the other parts i just i'm going to leave alone and when god does not come through in their eyes he becomes a disappointing god each time and i s am i speaking to anybody's heart here today you can't stay there you cannot stay there each time the heart is hardened more and more and there was there was always an underlying thing with the children of israel god do you love us how did the children of israel tempt god by saying is the lord among us or not god do you love us and if you loved us you see this is the mentality it's love at a level of just meeting needs god if you loved us you do this if you loved us if you loved me why did you take my loved one away from me why did they die how can i love you back when you didn't do it exactly the way that i wanted but in the children of israel it didn't help even when god gave them certain things that they asked for it didn't help because they still showed no faith when god did prove himself they needed another thing for him to prove his love there's no guarantee if god would have given you the answer you wanted for what you ask maybe god sees your heart and your lack of commitment and that wouldn't guarantee you're serving god with all your heart maybe god knows that that would be the guarantee that would be it do this lord and i'll serve you the rest of my life maybe god knows you're not speaking the truth he senses an unfaithful spirit no matter what god would do over time if you look at the message this way and god this way your heart would become hard how hard can you get how hard can you get one fella said to brother branham i don't believe in divine healing i don't believe it's true and why don't you prove it smite me blind right now he said do like the apostles smite me blind right now and if you smoke me blind i still wouldn't believe in divine healing or that you're of god that's how hard you can become the person who comes doesn't matter what proof there is it's not going to do any good because i'm still not going to believe you know what brother brahm said to him i'm not going to smite you blaine you're already blind you're already blind and you say well who's this meant to be he says it's meant for believers that believe it it's not meant for the unbeliever i should say this promised land the promises are for believers predestined for believers not taking the salvation away from anyone but we're going just beyond salvation to take in our promises can you say amen there'll be a lot of those that go through tribulation that are saved they're saved truly saved amen but my position here is to minister to the bride who wants rapturing faith and it's beyond just believing for salvation but it's a believe to take all your promises brothers you can do it sisters you can do it it's yours amen you don't know me brother paul well god does and he chose you anyway oh my what do i do now i'm only i'm number four and i have 10 of them to go so that leads hardness to heart leads to more doubt and unbelief tempting god saying is the lord among us or not that's what israel said is the lord lord or not they disbelieve everything they take a spirit against the truth even put it on trial like some are doing today i always knew that the message would be put on trial i just never believed it was put on trial but by people who used to believe it you're gonna go on trial but to go on trial what people who used to believe it it astounds me friends you put the wrong thing on trial that's all i can say it's pretty arrogant to say to god unless all my questions are answered i want all my questions answered unless there's perfection in the prophet and everything he says why are you requiring that of the prophet and you don't require it of yourself why does he have to say everything just right in order for you to believe and every prophet of the bible i can show were flawed men that made mistakes but why this one you deified so much idea fight him yeah you basically deify him because he's got to be perfect in everything he says why are you doing that for him and not yourself require that of yourself you're flawed you're a human being just like william branham was but unless i get all my questions unless it's perfection there are things difficult to understand let me just say a personal testimony there are things difficult for me to understand in this bible still to today there are things that are difficult in the message for me to understand still to this day okay it shouldn't be earth shattering there's things i still don't understand but i want to ask what right do i have to tempt god and say unless i get all the answers to all those things i won't believe i'm out of here what right what right do i have to say that i'm the guy that needed the cross i'm just the guy that needed salvation i was a sinner can you say amen why do i get so arrogant that i'm requiring god to answer all my questions let me tell you friends if it weren't for the merciful grace of god on a cross none of us would have a desire to even serve the lord that's where we stand can you say man we don't lift ourselves as theologians that we're going gonna question everything and god has to do it all before we believe listen we're sinners saved by his grace and we need to keep that humility god does not owe me anything god's already given me enough that if he'd never did another miracle i owe the rest of my life to him if he never answered another question i owe my life to him and if he sends me to hell at the end of this 33 years of ministry and serving him since i was 16 years old if god should send me and say that's your lot and sends me to hell i would still serve him with all of my heart if he came and spoke to me threw a bad soul or told me he says your end is to go to hell i would still serve them this way you know what my dad used to say he used to say if you think this message isn't true he says i would raise my family this way anyway if i found out it's not gonna be true in the end i'd raise my family because he said this is the best way to raise my family this message is the best way to raise a family and i said i said if he were to send me to hell i'm going to still do this because god doesn't owe me anything friends david said let my sentence come forth from the lord did you know david said that let my sentence come forth from the lord and whatever that sentence is i accept it doomed finished all right that's what god said thankfully for the bride of jesus christ the true holy ghost filled believers the sentence has come forth that we have passed from death and to life and because of calvary we stand guiltless before the lord the sentence has already come i don't deserve that can you say man but there's one thing about our friends he doesn't deserve i don't deserve for him to come he he doesn't have to come and just bow to my every little wish in order for me to keep serving him i was the one in need i was the reason that one earthly reason help me out he was huh i was the guilty he was the sacrifice i was beggar he was the giver dying while i go free that one earthly reason was me that's where we stand die to all your high falutin intellectual figuring things out and just look at yourself as a sinner saved by grace can you say men friends that's where we stand and that's the humility we need thanks brother dave you can sing that for a special one day you just committed yourself it's almost one o'clock didn't jesus say blessed is he who has not seen and yet believes he said it to doubting thomas so if i never see another miracle i never get anything else confirmed i'm never going to have other vindication blessed is he who has not seen and yet believes god bless you
