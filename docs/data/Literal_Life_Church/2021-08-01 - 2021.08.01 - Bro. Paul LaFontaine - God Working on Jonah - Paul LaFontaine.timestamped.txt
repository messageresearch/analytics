[0:09] just hungry for the word of god we're
[0:11] simple people around here we like to

[0:14] we like to put in a good day's worship
[0:17] if we come to church we should have
[0:19] church amen not be a spectator but to
[0:22] really join in
[0:23] and if god's doing something and you're
[0:25] fired up about it and god's got a
[0:27] personal revival going on in your heart
[0:29] then you have something to worship god
[0:30] about amen god bless you helen it's good
[0:33] to see you as well
[0:35] good day it's been a while since we've
[0:36] seen you it's good to have you driving
[0:38] all the way over here from pennsylvania
[0:39] but it's good to have all the
[0:40] sprints in amen god bless you we're
[0:43] going to read and continue on in the
[0:44] book of jonah i don't know if any of you
[0:46] had heard this service from
[0:48] last week and um where you find just
[0:50] some interesting things here
[0:52] in the life of jonah that are a bit
[0:54] mysterious but we just want to continue
[0:56] on and speak about him just a little
[0:58] bit and i believe there's some good
[1:00] lessons in here for all of us
[1:02] as we remind you brother bradham said
[1:04] that jonah is an example of us all
[1:06] and that pretty much covers all of us
[1:09] and so but if you got to dig a little
[1:11] bit to
[1:12] find the things in jonah's life because
[1:14] it's a little bit strange and mysterious
[1:16] in some areas
[1:17] but we're going to go to the last
[1:19] chapter of jonah we read
[1:21] the um the other parts last week and
[1:23] talked about them
[1:25] he had went ahead and did his commission
[1:27] and preached to nineveh
[1:28] and when we come to ch the end of
[1:30] chapter three
[1:32] and uh maybe pick it up here in verse
[1:35] nine where
[1:35] nineveh is actually repenting remember
[1:38] jonah had said you only have 40 days and
[1:40] god's going to destroy this place
[1:42] verse 9 of chapter 3 says who can tell
[1:45] if god will turn and repent and turn
[1:47] from his fierce anger
[1:48] that we perish not and god saw their
[1:51] works that they turned from their evil
[1:53] way
[1:54] and god repented of the evil that he had
[1:56] said that he would do unto them
[1:58] and he did it not chapter four last
[2:02] chapter here of jonah's life
[2:04] but it displeased jonah exceedingly and
[2:07] he was very angry notice
[2:09] jonah he's never just angry he's very
[2:12] angry
[2:13] he's never just displeased he's
[2:15] extremely displeased he's
[2:18] a man of extreme emotions and he prayed
[2:22] unto the lord and said i pray thee o
[2:24] lord was not this my saying when i was
[2:26] yet in my country
[2:27] therefore i fled before unto tarshish
[2:29] for i knew
[2:30] that thou art a gracious god and
[2:32] merciful slow to anger
[2:34] and of great kindness and repentancy of
[2:36] the evil therefore
[2:37] now o lord take i beseech thee my life
[2:40] from me
[2:41] it is better for me to die than to live
[2:44] then said the lord
[2:45] does thou well to be angry what a
[2:47] question from the lord
[2:49] does it ever do you well to be angry
[2:53] does anger accomplish anything that's
[2:56] what god's asking jonah
[2:57] are you are you better off with your
[2:59] anger and there's only one answer to
[3:01] that every time and that's why
[3:03] god asked it probably it's a yes or no
[3:05] and it's always a no
[3:06] anger never does you any good
[3:10] then said the lord do us thou well to be
[3:12] angry so jonah went out of the city and
[3:13] sat on the east side of the city
[3:16] and there made him a booth and sat under
[3:18] it in the shadow till he might see
[3:20] what would become of the city and the
[3:22] lord god prepared a gourd
[3:24] and made it come up over jonah that it
[3:27] might be a shadow over his head
[3:29] to deliver him from his grief so jonah
[3:31] was exceedingly glad
[3:33] of the gourd so now he's not just
[3:36] glad but he's he's exceedingly glad
[3:40] what a man of extreme emotions
[3:43] he's never just happy he's extremely
[3:46] happy
[3:47] he's never just sad he's extremely
[3:49] saddened when he's angry he's extremely
[3:51] angry
[3:53] and they didn't have any medicine for
[3:55] him back then
[3:57] for such a thing
[4:01] i don't know maybe essential oils i
[4:03] don't know
[4:06] but god prepared a worm when the morning
[4:09] rose the next day
[4:10] and it the worm smote the gourd that it
[4:12] withered so just within
[4:14] a day he's got a gourd growing up by god
[4:16] and then god sends a worm to kill the
[4:18] gordon now he doesn't have it and it
[4:19] came to pass when the sun did arise
[4:21] that god prepared a vehement east wind
[4:24] and the sun
[4:24] beat upon the head of the jonah that he
[4:26] fainted and
[4:28] wished in himself to die and said is it
[4:30] better it is better for me to die
[4:32] than to live god said to jonah doest
[4:36] thou well to be angry for the gourd and
[4:38] this time
[4:39] jonah he has a response and he said yeah
[4:42] yeah i
[4:43] do well to be angry i am justified in my
[4:46] angry
[4:47] anger even unto death i will just die
[4:50] in my anger
[4:53] don't forget this is brother bran this
[4:56] is somebody brother brahm said not to
[4:57] call
[4:58] a backslider or an unbeliever
[5:01] but a son of god
[5:07] and said the lord thou hast had pity on
[5:09] the gourd
[5:11] for the which thou hast not labored
[5:13] neither made us it to grow
[5:14] which came up in a night and perished in
[5:17] a night
[5:18] and should not i spare nineveh that
[5:20] great city
[5:22] wherein our more than six score thousand
[5:24] persons
[5:25] that cannot discern between their right
[5:27] hand
[5:28] and their left and also much cattle
[5:32] amen and that's how it ends that's how
[5:34] jonah the chapter ends
[5:37] let's pray heavenly father we just ask
[5:40] for the unction of the holy ghost today
[5:43] lord the choir has ministered to us an
[5:46] anointed song that there's a rest for
[5:48] the people of god
[5:49] there's a rest in the holy ghost that
[5:51] you provided
[5:53] in the finished work of calvary lord you
[5:55] have
[5:56] given us some place to enter lord and
[5:59] god all we have to do is come and enter
[6:01] into it
[6:02] help us today lord to enter into your
[6:04] word and enter into your
[6:05] peace help us lord as we sit at your
[6:08] feet to learn of you
[6:09] god you said to learn of you for you're
[6:11] meek and lowly
[6:12] lord you've never been nervous about
[6:14] anything lord
[6:16] you have never worried about anything
[6:19] because lord when you
[6:20] spoke your word you knew and had
[6:22] confidence when you spoke it
[6:24] it will be done just according to the
[6:25] way that you said it
[6:27] lord jesus may we rest in that word
[6:29] today may we rest in your promises today
[6:32] and lord any need that's laying here in
[6:34] the congregation or
[6:36] someone listening online i pray that you
[6:38] would anoint us
[6:39] that something lord will be said and
[6:41] come from your throne
[6:43] to bring the answer and the victory that
[6:46] your people are looking for
[6:47] every need can be met because we know
[6:50] that you're a mighty god
[6:52] we pray you'll minister and give
[6:53] strength in every area
[6:55] as we commit the service to you in the
[6:58] name of the lord jesus christ we ask it
[7:00] amen everybody said amen amen you may be
[7:04] seated god bless you
[7:07] i don't know if you had a chance to read
[7:09] the book of jonah this week it's not
[7:11] very long four chapters so i trust maybe
[7:13] you
[7:13] if you haven't done that you can do it
[7:14] and i might have to take another sunday
[7:17] on it next sunday we'll see how far we
[7:18] get today
[7:19] but i don't know if you read it at all
[7:22] but
[7:22] it's the final chapter of jonah that
[7:25] gets even more strange to me
[7:28] and as but as we were praying and
[7:31] studying with and looking at this week
[7:33] as we look at it even remember this come
[7:35] up during covet last year i started to
[7:37] read jonah
[7:38] so this has been a long time coming and
[7:39] kind of a bottled up sermon that i've
[7:41] been wanting to preach
[7:42] because and a lot of it was i didn't
[7:43] really understand and
[7:45] it's still opening to me just a little
[7:46] bit but as we look
[7:48] deeper into it we actually find not only
[7:52] some great lessons for us as a christian
[7:55] we find some great lessons and
[7:58] what can what can be within us as far as
[8:02] unresolved anger
[8:03] remember he becomes an example of us all
[8:06] jonah had unresolved anger that wasn't
[8:08] dealt with within them and that anger
[8:10] affected
[8:11] all of his responses to god all of his
[8:14] responses to god's word
[8:16] his response to the message his response
[8:18] to the word he was supposed to fulfill
[8:20] the will of god for his life he had
[8:22] unresolved anger within him and
[8:24] it affected how he responded to god i
[8:27] don't know how much it
[8:28] it it affected him in his response to
[8:32] other people but
[8:33] we we know enough about human beings
[8:35] that someone with unresolved anger
[8:37] it can affect other human beings as well
[8:40] it can affect our marriages it can
[8:42] affect our families
[8:43] it can affect our children and it's all
[8:45] because somebody
[8:46] is letting something fester wednesday
[8:48] night we talked about anger
[8:50] having a nature to it and resentment
[8:53] and bitterness having a nature that it
[8:54] tends to grow it does
[8:56] if it's left unnoticed or left
[8:58] unresolved
[8:59] then it grows like a cancer within our
[9:02] spirit
[9:02] and when it begins to grow like a cancer
[9:04] that's when it becomes very dangerous
[9:06] to other people but even our responses
[9:08] to god as we found in jonah's life
[9:11] he had unresolved anger here so we find
[9:13] great lessons
[9:14] for so many things we can learn but if
[9:16] we look deeper we can find the very
[9:18] mystery of christ
[9:19] for the last days uh in
[9:23] jonah's life we find the mystery of
[9:25] christ
[9:26] for the last days in jonah's life
[9:28] believe it or not
[9:30] and so just uh just to give a a quick
[9:33] summary so you know where i'm going
[9:35] today
[9:36] that jonah received a message that he
[9:39] was to speak
[9:40] and to live to nineveh just like we have
[9:43] received
[9:44] a message in the last days and with that
[9:47] message
[9:47] comes a responsibility it's not a
[9:50] spectator thing it's not something that
[9:53] oh great god sent a prophet and i have
[9:55] this message it's never that way
[9:57] it calls upon a certain commitment to it
[10:00] a responsibility that goes with it
[10:02] especially after the prophet
[10:04] leaves and gives the message then the
[10:06] responsibility falls back on the people
[10:08] to not only speak the message but to
[10:11] live the message
[10:12] we have a responsibility we have been
[10:14] blessed this morning
[10:15] all of you have been blessed and whether
[10:17] you're taking that responsibility or not
[10:20] if god has called you to it you can run
[10:22] you can run
[10:23] hard but if god has called you to this
[10:26] message of the last days
[10:27] then he will not give up in his love for
[10:30] you
[10:30] until you're standing and taking the
[10:33] responsibility
[10:34] for that message you see some people
[10:36] look at it like it's a bondage
[10:38] but you actually should feel privileged
[10:40] that you receive the message of the last
[10:42] days
[10:42] because it may not be given to everybody
[10:44] to take the responsibility
[10:46] and to speak it and live it but i'm
[10:47] telling you if god has given it to you
[10:50] then it's time to stand up and take
[10:51] responsibility for it
[10:53] and to me if if it's worth living for
[10:56] it's worth dying for it's worth giving
[10:58] our lives for
[11:01] and so we have a responsibility that
[11:03] goes with it
[11:04] a personal responsibility that goes with
[11:07] the message just as jonah
[11:09] had a personal responsibility i want to
[11:12] say this that it was a message like our
[11:14] message that had both
[11:15] mercy in it and judgment in it for the
[11:17] people of that day
[11:19] in other words the people of nineveh who
[11:20] were sinning and god's
[11:22] god's anger grew towards the people of
[11:24] nineveh
[11:25] and he sent his messenger descendant so
[11:27] his message had
[11:28] judgment in it can you say amen go tell
[11:31] them that they don't they only have 40
[11:32] days
[11:33] but also his message had mercy in it
[11:36] because when they repented
[11:38] god gave them mercy i want to tell you
[11:40] that
[11:41] no matter what somebody said to you
[11:42] about the message of the last days
[11:44] no matter what somebody's preached to
[11:46] you this message
[11:47] is the message of judgment but it's all
[11:49] the more of message of mercy and grace
[11:53] can you say amen noah's message was a
[11:56] message of judgment
[11:57] the raid is coming but it was also a
[12:00] message of grace
[12:01] because noah found grace in the eyes of
[12:04] the lord
[12:04] and built an ark and somebody escaped
[12:07] that whole thing
[12:09] we have a message and it's judgment but
[12:11] preachers should not preach just all the
[12:13] judgment
[12:13] as a matter of fact the judgment is to
[12:16] this world the judgment is to this
[12:18] satan's eden the judgments are to those
[12:20] who reject it can you say amen
[12:22] judgment is not on the bride because
[12:24] when you receive jesus christ
[12:26] you pass judgment you're not going to
[12:28] judgment day
[12:29] you've passed from death unto life so
[12:32] what are these preachers preaching
[12:34] judgment against the bride
[12:35] there is no judgment against the bride
[12:37] she's been redeemed
[12:38] she's been forgiven she's been justified
[12:41] by the grace of god
[12:44] you can't preach judgment to the bride
[12:46] of jesus christ
[12:48] because she's found his grace so when
[12:51] you're preaching you have to divide this
[12:53] because we do have a message of judgment
[12:55] but we also have a message of grace we
[12:58] can't just preach the judgments of god
[13:01] a lot of the judgments that are laying
[13:02] within our message go to this world
[13:05] and it's coming to judgment it's not if
[13:09] it's when this world this united states
[13:13] the politics the government systems
[13:15] every system
[13:16] is of man now it's god has withdrawn his
[13:19] spirit from it and there's
[13:20] nothing left but the judgments of god on
[13:23] this nation
[13:25] i don't trust any of it can you say man
[13:28] i don't trust
[13:29] anything you know you know what i do
[13:30] today if i read the words
[13:33] experts say i stop
[13:36] reading it i just stop reading it
[13:39] if you're trusting they can't get
[13:41] anything right they don't know what
[13:42] they're doing
[13:44] my trust is an almighty god my trust is
[13:47] in this word
[13:50] jonah was given a message of both mercy
[13:52] and judgment just like we're given
[13:53] given but the final
[13:57] i want you and this is what i want you
[13:58] to notice the final
[14:00] emphasis and fulfillment
[14:04] of this passage of scripture
[14:08] was not addressing the masses was not
[14:11] addressing nineveh
[14:16] final part of jonah was not to address
[14:19] the masses of people but actually a
[14:22] personal
[14:24] work a a personal
[14:27] dealing with jonah
[14:32] that's amazing to me because a message
[14:36] when you have a dispensational prophet
[14:38] he's not only speaking to that church
[14:39] that's on recording
[14:40] he's speaking to the entire dispensation
[14:43] he's preaching the
[14:44] seventh angel was to the entire
[14:45] laodicean age
[14:47] god speaks his prophet it's to the
[14:49] entire nation can you say
[14:51] whether they listen or not but in the
[14:54] last
[14:55] part of this mystery of jonah's life god
[14:58] is focusing his attention personally
[15:02] on jonah
[15:06] and i think that's something to ponder i
[15:08] think that's something to think about
[15:10] that his intentions was not on the
[15:13] masses
[15:14] but his attention was personally to
[15:16] jonah
[15:17] i feel that my lord is giving me
[15:21] personal attention in my life especially
[15:23] in the last year
[15:24] the word is not for a national revival
[15:27] but it's to bring a personal revival in
[15:29] my life
[15:30] i feel that i'm getting how many could
[15:32] raise your hand i feel i'm getting some
[15:34] personal messages to me from god
[15:37] and that's what was happened to jonah is
[15:39] that it was no longer to the entire
[15:41] world or nineveh and these great
[15:44] these nations but it was a personal
[15:46] message
[15:47] to jonah to go directly to him
[15:50] now let me just say this if i was
[15:52] heading this up if i had
[15:54] called jonah if i had watched his life
[15:57] if i had
[15:58] as soon as jonah had paid the fare and
[16:00] got on a ship to tarshish instead of
[16:02] nina
[16:03] nineveh after i had told him what he
[16:05] should do
[16:07] if i was heading this organization up in
[16:09] this thing i would have fired jonah
[16:12] very quick um
[16:15] you know if you got certain
[16:17] administrations and businesses and
[16:19] and different ones in the church here
[16:21] now have been in the corporate world and
[16:23] and you've hired people and you've
[16:25] worked with executives and certain
[16:27] things and
[16:27] some of those are pretty strict things
[16:29] and so
[16:30] brother tim i think has worked in the
[16:32] corporate world and so
[16:33] you know sometimes when someone shows k
[16:37] actions in a certain way then you can't
[16:39] go on very long with that brother boaz
[16:41] has people under him as well
[16:43] and you can't you know eventually in
[16:45] person if he doesn't
[16:46] just get it together uh he's going to
[16:48] get fired she's going to get fired and
[16:50] if i'd have been in charge
[16:51] jonah would have been fired early on
[16:54] after his actions
[16:56] and then at the end of it to be angry
[16:59] when nineveh repented
[17:01] uh i would have been on ziprecruiter
[17:06] or monster.com or whatever you go to and
[17:10] i would have been looking for another
[17:11] recruit for the job and
[17:13] get rid of this guy why because he
[17:15] proved
[17:16] he was not all in sometimes
[17:21] jonah proved he wasn't all in
[17:25] and he eventually did what he was
[17:28] supposed to do
[17:29] but his actions showed he wasn't all in
[17:33] with the message yet
[17:35] and so i would have fired him but guess
[17:37] what god didn't fire him
[17:40] but this he showed actions that he was
[17:42] he was
[17:43] coming and the first time he had to be
[17:46] you know
[17:47] he had god had to go get him because he
[17:50] was headed another direction
[17:51] so this is the son of god he heads the
[17:53] opposite direction he's supposed to be
[17:54] going
[17:55] and god says i gotta go get him so he
[17:57] goes and gets him he finds them
[17:59] and god was in the storm and he made a
[18:01] big storm on the water and the ship was
[18:03] ready to sink
[18:04] and then god was in the boat can you say
[18:06] amen that's what brother braham said
[18:08] and then god was in a fish so jonah he
[18:10] thinks i'm
[18:12] some of the commentators read that jonah
[18:14] was really didn't want to bring
[18:16] this message because they were gentiles
[18:17] brother branham said that
[18:19] but another thing is that he didn't want
[18:20] to bring it because he had a little
[18:22] prejudice in him that
[18:23] this was for the jews only for the jews
[18:25] that's similar to how
[18:26] peter was and his prejudice towards the
[18:28] gentiles and had a little attitude in
[18:31] him
[18:31] brother braham said he had an attitude
[18:33] even when god uh gave mercy to the
[18:35] nights
[18:37] jonah had an attitude about it that
[18:39] needed to be corrected
[18:40] and so now he had a little added so this
[18:42] made him some of the reasons why he ran
[18:44] away i don't want to do that
[18:45] i don't and so then god he goes and gets
[18:48] him and gets this
[18:49] giant fish and he catches him and
[18:53] and so now then then one commentator
[18:55] says he brings them right to the shores
[18:57] of nineveh
[18:58] and he he spits this the fish spits them
[19:01] out
[19:01] and so now they say that if jonah would
[19:04] have went
[19:04] on his own and didn't arrive being
[19:08] vomited out of a fish they might not
[19:10] have listened to him
[19:12] but because all of the ninevites
[19:15] had sea gods and made their gods out of
[19:18] the sea
[19:19] see friends god knows what he's doing
[19:22] they may not have listened to jonah if
[19:24] he had just showed up in his regular
[19:26] clothes
[19:28] but he showed up being spit out of a
[19:30] fish big fish
[19:32] with not his best executive clothes on
[19:35] covered in vomit and covered in whoever
[19:37] whatever else was in a fish
[19:40] and he spit out and all that was
[19:43] directly of god
[19:44] in order to give a little more emphasis
[19:46] and this man's going to speak against
[19:48] nineveh
[19:48] and tell them to repent and they're
[19:50] going to listen just a little more
[19:52] god knows what he's doing and if we
[19:53] don't learn anything about jonah please
[19:55] learn this
[19:56] it's not about you it's not about you
[19:59] didn't bring the message
[20:01] and don't try to micromanage how it's
[20:03] going to come to pass
[20:05] if god gives us saith the lord don't try
[20:07] to get online and figure out how it's
[20:09] going to happen because when a prophet
[20:11] speaks thus they at the lord we don't
[20:13] know how god's going to bring it to pass
[20:15] we just submit to it and believe it can
[20:17] you say amen
[20:20] if we don't learn anything learn this is
[20:22] that god let
[20:23] god do what he's going to do let god
[20:26] bring this message the way that he
[20:28] wanted to bring it can you say that
[20:30] let god do what he wants to do and let
[20:32] god do it the way
[20:34] that he wants to do it can we apply that
[20:36] to your life
[20:37] let god you want to see results you want
[20:40] to see changes you want to see this but
[20:41] let god do it his way
[20:45] that's one of jonah's problems he didn't
[20:47] like the way that god was doing things
[20:49] this is an immaturity he needed to deal
[20:51] with i wouldn't have let jonah go on
[20:55] but god
[20:58] looks at him he runs from god
[21:01] he has ill feelings towards the you know
[21:04] you say why wouldn't why would you fire
[21:06] jonah
[21:06] look at him he runs from the lord he has
[21:09] ill feelings towards the gentiles
[21:12] he has ill feelings towards nineveh
[21:14] because nineveh was always a threat to
[21:16] israel
[21:16] he would have preferred nineveh go in
[21:18] judgment and die because there would be
[21:20] no
[21:20] more threat to israel that's his mind
[21:24] thinking
[21:27] he thinks he's better than the gentiles
[21:30] he's mad because god gave them mercy
[21:34] which will make his prophecy look bad to
[21:36] all the ninevites
[21:38] he's self-focused he's extremely
[21:42] he has extreme happy moments extremely
[21:46] happy
[21:46] he has extremely mad moments he has
[21:49] extremely
[21:50] happy moments when his needs are met
[21:52] when his personal injuries are met
[21:54] he gets extremely happy i just gotta
[21:56] elaborate on this a little bit
[22:01] he has a rush of happiness and joy and
[22:04] he treats everybody right
[22:06] when his personal needs are being met
[22:10] personal needs loses his focus of the
[22:13] message of the ninevites
[22:14] and the big purpose of god and it's just
[22:17] like this gourd comes up in the heat of
[22:19] the sun
[22:20] and it's like yeah this is really nice i
[22:23] am really
[22:25] happy what are you doing jonah i'm just
[22:28] excited out of my gourd
[22:30] because of the gourd
[22:34] just as happy it's like people were
[22:36] saying man i haven't seen you this way
[22:39] in two or three days but you are
[22:42] happy as a little lark man there you're
[22:44] just going on
[22:46] this that's the problem that i have with
[22:48] him he he
[22:49] when his needs are met he's extremely
[22:52] happy
[22:52] but when they're not he's extremely
[22:55] angry
[22:57] he forgets the supernatural way that god
[23:00] backed him up
[23:01] the fish and all that he was unfaithful
[23:05] he was never fully on board with god
[23:08] and also he was suicidal
[23:13] that's why i would have fired him
[23:17] he was upset that the outcome from the
[23:19] message was not turning out like he
[23:21] thought
[23:22] i'd say let let loose of this guy
[23:26] and and i would have finished
[23:29] the book of jonah different
[23:32] than what how this finishes would you
[23:35] have
[23:36] remember i said last sunday that disney
[23:38] has taught us to that there needs to be
[23:40] a happy ending to everything
[23:42] please i'm not knocking disney okay i'm
[23:45] just saying we get taught in our culture
[23:47] that everything has a happy ending
[23:49] with serving the lord it may look like
[23:52] sometimes there's not a happy ending
[23:54] but let god do it his way
[23:59] let god do it his way there was a couple
[24:02] statements
[24:03] uh yesterday that i heard that
[24:07] dr anthony evans said and it really
[24:10] really
[24:10] affected me i think it was good he was
[24:12] talking about death he's experienced a
[24:14] lot of deaths in his
[24:15] family in the last two or three years
[24:17] his wife and different ones
[24:19] and there's a real profound statement
[24:22] one thing he said
[24:23] was he says i i he says if if you leave
[24:26] god
[24:28] during the midst of tragedy or problem
[24:31] if you would leave god you still have
[24:33] the problem to deal with
[24:37] amen i thought that was good
[24:40] and he he also spoke and he he was
[24:43] saying something about
[24:45] the uh when when god is in
[24:49] something then we trust him he's saying
[24:54] i would rather throw my lot in
[24:58] with a god who i don't understand
[25:01] sometimes
[25:03] then throw my lot in with men
[25:07] i thought that was good i would rather
[25:11] keep serving a god that i don't
[25:13] understand sometimes
[25:15] than to put my trust in men or google or
[25:19] whatever i would rather i think that's
[25:22] real maturity to say
[25:24] you know what i don't care what's
[25:25] happened unfair in my life
[25:28] i would rather i don't understand what
[25:30] god's doing right now
[25:31] but i'd rather stick with god even when
[25:33] i don't understand him
[25:36] that's the maturity we need can you say
[25:38] man that's the way that we need to look
[25:40] at things
[25:41] but i wouldn't have i wouldn't chosen uh
[25:43] i i would have worded it different i
[25:45] i don't know how i would have worded it
[25:47] how i would have but i didn't write the
[25:49] book
[25:49] god wrote the book can you say amen and
[25:51] uh you know
[25:52] i i would have just had the the ending
[25:55] the finish of the book of jonah
[25:57] without jonah but you see it's kind of
[26:00] hard
[26:02] because the book is named after him
[26:05] so it's kind of hard to finish the book
[26:07] of jonah
[26:09] without jonah it's kind of hard to kick
[26:12] him out
[26:13] as his name is in the book
[26:20] hello
[26:23] it's kind of hard to get jonah out
[26:26] because his name
[26:28] is in the book of life
[26:31] and if his name is in the book of life
[26:33] then you can't kick him out
[26:35] because those names who are on the
[26:37] lamb's book of life you can't kick them
[26:39] out of the story
[26:40] no matter what they've done you can't
[26:42] kick them out somebody say praise the
[26:44] lord
[26:48] so aren't you glad i'm not in charge god
[26:51] is in charge can you say amen
[26:53] and so we must be talking about a son
[26:57] in jonah who needs tutoring that means a
[27:00] son who has the potential for adoption
[27:02] and all the themes the last few weeks
[27:04] have spoken in these terms
[27:06] from the lord about adoption and
[27:07] specifically about
[27:09] when are we going to grow to the place
[27:10] that we stop responding to the things of
[27:12] life
[27:13] by our emotions by our own thoughts by
[27:16] our own reactions by our own
[27:17] anger and our emotions go up and down
[27:19] it's time that we really
[27:21] say lord i want to be filled with the
[27:23] spirit and live in the spirit
[27:25] that my reactions to god and my
[27:27] reactions to life's trouble
[27:29] are according to the will of god and
[27:31] trusting in god
[27:32] and not led by my own emotions
[27:36] so jonah has the potential here
[27:40] it's a son so a son has the potential
[27:42] for adoption
[27:43] in fact he has the life of adoption in
[27:46] him the holy ghost
[27:47] we have the potential for adoption in us
[27:50] because we receive the spirit of
[27:53] sons the spirit of adoption when we
[27:55] receive the holy ghost
[27:57] we are not fully adopted yet but we
[27:59] receive the spirit of adoption whereby
[28:02] we cry
[28:03] have a father you can't call them father
[28:06] unless you know
[28:06] you're a son but when you become a son
[28:08] by the holy ghost
[28:09] abba father what are you going to do
[28:11] with me i'll tell you what he's going to
[28:13] do with you he's going to take you
[28:14] because the inheritance
[28:15] is all going to be yours and he's going
[28:17] to tutor you and put you under training
[28:19] of the holy spirit
[28:20] until you become mature enough to handle
[28:23] the kingdom and that's what i see in the
[28:27] life of jonah
[28:28] because his name was on the book he was
[28:30] a son so he has the potential
[28:32] it doesn't even say that he came there
[28:34] but i know he's still there
[28:36] and god is still dealing with him
[28:39] because
[28:39] he's a son
[28:43] aren't you glad god keeps dealing with
[28:44] you
[28:47] aren't you glad when you act like a
[28:48] jonah
[28:51] god in his grace keeps dealing with you
[28:53] now i could open up for testimonies and
[28:55] be testimony after testimony
[28:57] of how rough you've done and the
[28:58] mistakes you've made and how low that
[29:00] you have gotten
[29:01] you your wife your family come out of
[29:04] all kinds of things
[29:06] all kinds of things but you're still
[29:08] here today
[29:10] still worshiping the lord it shouldn't
[29:12] be that way
[29:13] for some reason you're here you don't
[29:14] have to come here you know come and
[29:16] listen to this
[29:18] overweight preacher
[29:21] you have a choice you ask yourself why
[29:24] are you here why are you here
[29:27] it's got to be a deeper reason than just
[29:30] my my kids dragged me here
[29:35] i think there's something within you
[29:38] calling you you're hungry
[29:43] and i just want to tell you you're in
[29:44] the right place
[29:46] i'm not talking about my church but
[29:47] you're in the right word you're at the
[29:49] right place
[29:50] at the right time to receive healing
[29:53] and mending and forgiveness
[29:59] in this atmosphere god
[30:02] can do anything
[30:05] so many people are coming and they're so
[30:07] hurt and they're so damaged and the
[30:09] problem hasn't gone away yet
[30:10] but all i can tell you i've i've got the
[30:12] right word here
[30:14] i've got the right message i've got the
[30:16] right presence of the lord
[30:18] if you'll stay in it within that will be
[30:20] the answer to everything
[30:23] i have such confidence in that all your
[30:26] fears and all your
[30:27] past mistakes and all your hesitance and
[30:30] your damage
[30:31] can be washed away by his presence
[30:37] so you're in a safe place this morning
[30:41] people say that today i don't want any
[30:43] drama i don't want to come
[30:45] and just have a bunch of i just i just
[30:47] want to come
[30:48] and hear a refreshing
[30:52] word from the lord so i can grow in
[30:54] christ
[30:57] and there's hundreds of people that are
[30:59] desiring that i'm tired of the drama and
[31:01] the message i'm tired of the politics
[31:03] i'm tired of people shooting against one
[31:05] another i'm tired
[31:07] i just want to shut all that out can i
[31:09] come to a place
[31:11] and know that the presence of the lord
[31:12] is there
[31:14] and that the word is not going to hurt
[31:16] me but it's actually going to help me
[31:19] it may be a correction but the
[31:21] correction is going to be in the word of
[31:23] god and it'll be my lord correcting me
[31:25] because i am a son but it may
[31:29] always be a correction sometimes he's
[31:31] going to come and say
[31:32] i remember peter you know jonah's the
[31:36] kind of guy that acted very much
[31:38] like what i preached on the disciples
[31:39] when they acted the way they acted after
[31:41] the resurrection
[31:43] i would have fired all them too
[31:46] they're doubting they were with jesus
[31:49] all they're seeing the miracles of those
[31:50] and then he resurrects
[31:52] and they can't find him and they're
[31:54] doubting they're fearful
[31:55] doubting thomas they have no faith
[31:58] they're they're taken off peter's
[32:00] denying him
[32:02] these are his disciples i'm saying you
[32:03] know call get get some new recruits
[32:06] start over with some new disciples
[32:08] but he didn't and for a long time before
[32:12] even he ascended
[32:13] he was working in the third pole not
[32:16] with the world
[32:17] third pole is not a public show it's not
[32:18] to the world but he's working bringing
[32:21] his word and explaining it
[32:22] to his disciples for 40 days
[32:27] this is what he's doing with jonah
[32:28] instead of in nineveh
[32:31] he's taking care of one man that's
[32:34] acting
[32:34] really crazy up and down he says i'm
[32:37] choose i'm focusing
[32:39] my attention on this son and i'm going
[32:41] to teach him
[32:42] a lesson now you may run from that
[32:46] but i see it as the love of god i see
[32:49] myself as special
[32:50] if he focuses on me he's got the whole
[32:53] world
[32:54] to care for and all these other things
[32:57] but when he comes in real personal to me
[32:59] and speaks to my heart i feel very
[33:01] special
[33:02] i feel like if he loves me that much
[33:05] then he must
[33:06] must want to do something deeper in my
[33:08] life
[33:09] and i want to be available to him
[33:12] so jonah is an example of us all and
[33:14] that sons will be child trained
[33:16] so in so many areas but one result is
[33:20] that we learn to be led every day by our
[33:22] father not our emotions or our fears
[33:24] or our preconceived thoughts of our own
[33:27] or prejudice or our anger
[33:29] or our resentment or our past hurts that
[33:32] we would not be led
[33:33] in our life by those things you say
[33:35] preconceived thoughts
[33:36] people can have past thoughts of stuff
[33:39] and they can see a new situation because
[33:42] they've had the past
[33:43] they ca put that in a category or put
[33:45] you in a category right away
[33:47] based on their past thoughts people can
[33:50] come to another church and put me in the
[33:52] category of their old preacher
[33:55] maybe he's done wrong i don't know if he
[33:56] maybe he's done right but but uh
[33:58] i don't think it's fair by your past to
[34:01] categorize somebody and put them in a
[34:03] certain category oh he's this and you
[34:05] don't even hardly know
[34:06] him yet
[34:10] amen i think it's not fair to do that to
[34:13] body of christ i don't think you're fair
[34:15] that you assume something other
[34:17] of other people that they're going to be
[34:19] a certain way
[34:20] just because of your past experiences
[34:22] that's not fair your past is your best
[34:26] and you need to give everyone a fresh
[34:28] start as god has given you a fresh start
[34:31] amen so now we we are we are not being
[34:35] led by our anger resentment past hurts
[34:38] preconceived thoughts
[34:39] but he's leading sons and teaching sons
[34:41] to truly
[34:43] be led because he says sons of god are
[34:45] led by
[34:46] the spirit of god that's our goal that's
[34:48] what we want to see in our lives
[34:50] you see and i believe that an adopted
[34:52] son
[34:53] is i believe this is my personal thing
[34:56] that
[34:56] uh those have been with me for years
[34:58] this is what i preach
[34:59] i believe that an adopted son is not one
[35:02] who
[35:03] today is shouting amen to the word in a
[35:06] convention that doesn't mean he's
[35:08] adopted
[35:09] it's not one who's shouting amen to the
[35:11] word at a convention
[35:12] but it's it's he's acting in a behavior
[35:15] like a son at work on monday
[35:21] that's a little bit different view but
[35:23] that's just the way i feel about it
[35:25] adoption is based upon god fine-tuning
[35:28] our behavior to bring it in line to be
[35:30] led by the holy spirit
[35:32] it's not how much you jump it's not how
[35:34] much you shout
[35:35] it's not how much you see of the
[35:36] mysteries of god paul even said in first
[35:38] corinthians 13
[35:40] he said though i understand all the
[35:42] mysteries and have not this core of love
[35:44] then i am nothing he said it in the
[35:47] bible how many believes he said how he
[35:49] knows he said that
[35:50] so now it's not that we emphasize the
[35:52] mysteries or we emphasize
[35:54] giving to charity and we emphasize all
[35:56] these good works
[35:57] do that it's all fine i love the
[35:59] mysteries but
[36:00] adoption is a different story when your
[36:03] behavior
[36:04] every day comes in line with a son who's
[36:06] under submission
[36:09] it's not how high you shout at service
[36:10] on sunday it's your behavior at work on
[36:13] monday
[36:14] can i get some more amens you know it's
[36:17] true
[36:18] so we're growing under an adoption
[36:21] message
[36:22] and this is why jonah is so important to
[36:23] us because you see his man needed to be
[36:25] dealt with this man
[36:27] needed personal attention from god to
[36:30] teach him
[36:31] some lessons can you say amen
[36:36] i believe that adopts and sons adopted
[36:38] sons are not just that they come to a
[36:39] message church
[36:41] but they're changing and dying
[36:44] to their own will every day
[36:49] god turns his focus to jonah he's going
[36:52] to teach him some things
[36:54] kind of like brother branham said about
[36:55] moses
[36:57] brother said about moses he says he took
[36:59] him out on the backside of the desert
[37:01] to teach him some human weakness because
[37:03] he got so
[37:04] lifted up even when he was in egypt and
[37:06] started to see his call
[37:08] then he thought with all of his
[37:11] technique and all the things he'd
[37:12] learned in egypt
[37:13] i can do this i got this god i got this
[37:17] and so then he didn't think he had any
[37:20] human weakness because he was taught in
[37:21] the ways of egypt
[37:22] he could he was the guy to lead people
[37:24] out brother says he had to take him on
[37:26] the back side of the desert for 40 years
[37:29] and teach him some human weakness
[37:33] teach him that he was human
[37:36] and in the message perfect strength i
[37:38] was just talking about this with brother
[37:39] rap sister lee's beth at dinner the
[37:41] other night in
[37:43] the process of teaching him he had to
[37:45] believe it or not he had to teach them
[37:47] that he was
[37:48] human and out of that teaching him
[37:50] humanness
[37:52] that's where brother brown gets the
[37:53] message perfect strength through perfect
[37:55] weakness
[37:56] because when we are weak within
[37:58] ourselves and realize we can't do it
[38:01] that's when god has opportunities to
[38:02] show his power in our lives
[38:04] but if we think we can do it if we think
[38:07] we can live this message
[38:09] we need to learn in my humanness i can't
[38:11] live it
[38:12] when we start admitting that and being
[38:14] humble about it and
[38:15] learning and took them on the back side
[38:17] of the desert to teach him some human
[38:20] weakness
[38:20] 40 years and he gave him a high tempered
[38:24] wife
[38:26] along that lesson learning thing he gave
[38:28] him a high tempered wife
[38:31] and moses had a high temper and he says
[38:35] when those tempers got to going
[38:37] in the wilderness he said it must have
[38:39] been quite a thing
[38:40] when both of those tempers got going
[38:44] at the same time i'm quoting brother
[38:47] branham now not me
[38:49] that's the way he said it must have been
[38:51] quite a thing going on
[38:54] but what was god doing he was teaching
[38:56] him human weakness
[38:58] until then he gets the title of the
[39:00] humblest man and the earth later on
[39:02] because god had whipped everything out
[39:05] of him
[39:05] that he had any confidence in himself
[39:08] alone
[39:09] till he is ready to go down to egypt and
[39:11] completely trust in god
[39:13] to bring two million of his people out
[39:15] of egypt
[39:17] but he had to learn something first
[39:21] you're a human being and you can't do it
[39:24] without god and there's like a million
[39:28] lessons that god has
[39:30] to teach sons human weakness
[39:34] to teach them humility there's a lot of
[39:38] lessons and jonah he
[39:39] he he takes them to teach as he
[39:43] taught moses it's not your message it's
[39:46] his message
[39:48] and that the message is bigger than you
[39:51] how many know that the message is bigger
[39:53] than you
[39:54] the kingdom of god is bigger than you
[39:58] his thoughts are higher than your
[40:00] thoughts can you say amen
[40:02] bigger than your little mind and once we
[40:04] learn that then we let god be god and
[40:06] let him do
[40:07] things the way that he wants to do them
[40:10] can you say amen
[40:12] there's nothing wrong with the message
[40:13] and in jonah's day there was nothing
[40:14] wrong with the message
[40:16] jonah just had a lot of baggage that did
[40:18] not work with the message very well you
[40:20] hold on now
[40:21] because i'm going to read some things
[40:22] that the prophet said to to just seal
[40:24] this up and confirm it
[40:26] but i want you to listen there was
[40:27] nothing wrong with the message
[40:32] can i say it again there's nothing wrong
[40:35] with the message
[40:38] the problem was with jonah
[40:41] and if jonah had brought a lot of
[40:42] baggage with the message
[40:44] it would not work to really get the
[40:46] message effective so we got a great
[40:48] message
[40:49] but we get in the way our thoughts get
[40:51] in the way can you say amen
[40:52] and so now god had to work on jonah
[40:56] to get all the baggage out can you say a
[40:58] man so that now when he put him with the
[41:00] message he can really be affected with
[41:02] something
[41:03] and so when we put it can hinder the
[41:06] message and the effects of the message
[41:07] and so you know what the message has no
[41:10] problems with
[41:11] as far as the message itself and you
[41:13] know what we just if you're listening
[41:15] today wherever you are
[41:16] we need to leave the message alone
[41:20] we have had too many years in the
[41:22] message where so many
[41:24] including preachers have had their own
[41:26] agenda added to this thing
[41:29] and we need to leave it alone and let
[41:32] the holy spirit
[41:33] finish this message the way that he
[41:35] wants to finish it can i get an amen
[41:39] we need to leave it alone preachers you
[41:41] need to leave it alone preach the
[41:42] message
[41:43] but don't have your personal agenda to
[41:45] it don't push to get some result you
[41:48] don't have to push to get a result
[41:49] you just preach the message and hungry
[41:51] hearts will do it and god will do the
[41:53] work
[41:55] i believe that with all my heart and i
[41:57] say leave it alone leave it the way it
[41:58] is
[41:59] and so there's there's there's a hunger
[42:01] for the people to see an
[42:03] end of the agendas and politics not only
[42:06] within themselves
[42:08] in their lives but the preachers as well
[42:09] just leave it alone
[42:11] and quit trying to micromanage it to
[42:13] bring the expected in that you want
[42:15] let's let god bring it to the end that
[42:17] he wants
[42:18] let's let god finish this message the
[42:21] way that he wants to
[42:22] let's get god bring us to a rapture the
[42:24] way he wants to can you say amen
[42:27] and quit using it for selfish means
[42:31] jonah only got mad because he wanted to
[42:33] it to end a certain way and it didn't in
[42:35] that way
[42:37] can't help but tie this to thousands of
[42:39] people who go through things that they
[42:40] don't understand
[42:41] what god is doing
[42:45] they go through things and they don't
[42:46] understand what god is doing and as dr
[42:49] anthony evans says i would rather throw
[42:52] in my lot with a god who i don't
[42:54] understand sometimes
[42:55] then throw it in with men any day
[43:00] i'd rather trust god when he doesn't
[43:02] make sense
[43:04] than to trust others or to trust my own
[43:07] thoughts
[43:08] or to trust my own emotions
[43:16] i wonder if jonah read isaiah 55 he had
[43:19] access daniel had access to the book of
[43:21] jeremiah and isaiah
[43:24] i wonder if jonah had access to isaiah
[43:25] 55 and i wonder if he
[43:27] ever read isaiah 55 and verse 8 that
[43:30] says
[43:30] god says for my thoughts are not your
[43:33] thoughts
[43:34] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[43:37] lord
[43:38] if jonah read that in isaiah one day he
[43:41] certainly wasn't listening
[43:43] because that's the lesson he had to
[43:44] learn god says my
[43:46] thoughts are not your thoughts isaiah 55
[43:49] and verse 8.
[43:51] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[43:53] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[43:55] lord
[43:55] for as the heavens are higher than the
[43:58] earth so
[43:59] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[44:02] thoughts than your thoughts can you say
[44:04] amen today
[44:08] if you've struggled with this message
[44:10] then maybe you just need to know
[44:12] that god lets you know it might be hard
[44:15] to understand because
[44:17] his thoughts are higher than our
[44:19] thoughts
[44:20] his ways are higher than our ways
[44:24] it's going to be different we're going
[44:26] to see it different can you say amen
[44:28] for as the heavens are higher than the
[44:30] earth's sore my ways higher than your
[44:31] ways
[44:32] my thoughts and your thoughts for as the
[44:34] rain cometh down and the snow from
[44:36] heaven and returneth
[44:37] not feather but watereth the earth and
[44:39] maketh it bring forth and bud
[44:41] that it may give seed to the sower and
[44:44] bread
[44:45] to the eater so shall my word be that
[44:48] goeth forth out of my mouth
[44:50] it shall not how many knows how the word
[44:52] comes forth with god's mouth how many
[44:54] knows that prophets are god's mouthpiece
[44:56] that's how the word of god comes out of
[44:59] his mouth it's the mouth of the prophet
[45:01] so shall my word that goeth forth out of
[45:03] my mouth
[45:04] it shall not return unto me void but it
[45:08] shall accomplish
[45:09] that which i please and it shall prosper
[45:12] in the thing
[45:13] where i sent it amen i wonder if jonah
[45:16] read that so what's god really doing in
[45:19] this last chapter
[45:20] i know we've been real rough on jonah
[45:22] today and maybe rough on us
[45:24] but what is what is god doing with jonah
[45:28] what is happening with us in this hour
[45:30] this time you know when jonah sits out
[45:33] in the sun we're just going to get to
[45:34] the mystery just a little bit of this
[45:36] when jonah just sits out in the sun
[45:39] it has a spiritual meaning do you know
[45:41] the prophet
[45:43] spoke many times and said that the next
[45:45] thing
[45:46] to happen in the end after this message
[45:49] has went to the world
[45:51] you know he used the term several times
[45:53] what's
[45:54] to happen next after the message goes to
[45:56] the world which it has
[45:58] that we are to lay
[46:02] in the presence of the sun
[46:06] so this jonah being out there trying to
[46:08] find a shade
[46:10] it has a spiritual type he's right where
[46:13] god wants him
[46:15] he said where he said we're in delay in
[46:17] the presence of the sun
[46:19] to ripe him i'm gonna i'm gonna read it
[46:20] to you to ripen because
[46:22] it was just it was beyond just malachi 4
[46:26] 5 coming that's not only what the
[46:30] message is can you say amen
[46:32] it's malachi 4 5 and 6. if that's not
[46:34] established in your life
[46:36] then you please get with us we can talk
[46:38] about it and show you the scriptures
[46:39] that line up
[46:40] that there was a fulfillment to the last
[46:43] verses of the old testament behold
[46:46] elijah truly shall first come and
[46:48] restore all things
[46:50] john the baptist didn't restore anything
[46:52] so it can't be john the baptist
[46:53] he said he'll come before the great and
[46:55] dreadful day of the lord this elijah
[46:57] this restorer and so now a prophet is
[46:59] meant to come at the end time
[47:01] and some people think that's the message
[47:03] that's not the whole message
[47:04] when jonah preached the message to
[47:06] nineveh that wasn't the whole message
[47:08] that wasn't the end of it
[47:10] and so when he refers to it malachi 4
[47:13] has done
[47:13] he's done his work he's brought his
[47:15] message but then you go what
[47:17] is next malachi 4 but then revelation
[47:21] excuse me then we look in luke 17 30
[47:24] jesus said now that's malachi 4 jesus
[47:27] said the son of man would reveal himself
[47:31] at the end time the son of man the s-o-n
[47:34] in other words the s-o-n would shine in
[47:37] the evening time
[47:38] the s-o-n would shine like he did 2000
[47:40] years ago
[47:41] the the the the the son of man would be
[47:44] revealed it's not that he would
[47:46] physically come
[47:47] not yet but he would be revealed to the
[47:49] people
[47:50] his son would shine to the people so he
[47:53] got jonah sitting in the hot sun
[47:55] but then the last part of the message is
[47:57] that the sun is shining brightly
[47:59] for what purpose not so much to the rest
[48:01] of the world but that
[48:02] sons of god would lay in the presence
[48:06] of the sun and ripen and mature
[48:12] so here's some quotes and this is the
[48:14] way
[48:15] that god would do it in this stage we
[48:17] were in the message coming forth
[48:19] and it's not another worldwide revival
[48:23] when the prophet refers to this what's
[48:26] coming next
[48:27] it's not another worldwide revival
[48:31] if you want to be in that channel you
[48:34] would
[48:35] be a part of some some of the
[48:38] charismatic groups today
[48:41] and they look and see what revival was
[48:42] before worldwide revival
[48:44] national church revival and thank the
[48:46] lord they're saying that the church
[48:47] needs a revival i mean at least they got
[48:49] that discernment to see
[48:50] the church needs a revival she's
[48:52] lukewarm
[48:54] praise the lord you know i never had i
[48:57] never speak against people that are
[48:58] searching for more of god and looking
[49:00] for things
[49:00] as a matter of fact you know some some
[49:03] people have criticized
[49:04] some of the songs that come from
[49:06] denominations but
[49:08] don't forget a couple things that when
[49:10] his spirit is over the whole world
[49:12] every once while somebody that's not in
[49:14] the message can catch
[49:16] the inspiration of the holy spirit by
[49:18] the true
[49:19] anointing of the holy spirit the vessel
[49:21] may not be what we want to see but they
[49:23] caught the anointing to write an
[49:26] inspired song
[49:28] from god
[49:31] wow god can anoint somebody
[49:36] outside of the message
[49:39] excuse my sarcasm but that's what the
[49:42] prophet taught us
[49:43] men can be anointed and breathe the
[49:45] wrong vessel
[49:47] of the genuine anointing of god
[49:51] we don't have a monopoly on god in the
[49:54] message
[49:56] we don't have a monopoly on truth
[49:59] is this okay with everybody we can't
[50:01] have that attitude
[50:03] you limit god by doing that i see if a
[50:06] person comes up to me and say they
[50:07] received the receiving
[50:08] knowledge of jesus christ and accepted
[50:10] the blood of jesus christ and they're
[50:12] starting to see changes in their life
[50:13] who am i to question their experience
[50:16] with god
[50:17] i don't know if it's real or not but
[50:18] it's not up to me to judge whether
[50:20] that's genuine or not
[50:21] it's up to me to be a representative of
[50:23] truth and further truth and restore
[50:25] truth
[50:25] if they're hungry for more and they're
[50:27] asking me i'm going to tell them there's
[50:29] more truth
[50:30] but i do not have a right to monopolize
[50:32] god
[50:33] and say god can only work in this church
[50:37] god can only work at these conventions
[50:41] this isn't in my notes this is for free
[50:46] we don't have a right to do that god i
[50:48] read it to you last sunday
[50:50] god is concerned about all of mankind
[50:53] god is mercy and if someone repents
[50:55] god's a merciful god
[50:59] we don't have a monopoly on certain
[51:01] things we have been blessed with
[51:04] restored truth
[51:06] and the seven seals taken off the book
[51:08] of redemption
[51:09] are we ever blessed
[51:12] but we don't have a monopoly on that
[51:15] that we can withhold it for somebody and
[51:17] say that there
[51:18] there's something different because they
[51:19] don't have that that's pride
[51:25] that's pride so we don't have
[51:29] those restrictions to say that god
[51:32] is is just just in a certain thing
[51:37] and so there's not going to be
[51:41] when we look for what's next in the
[51:42] message it's not going to be a worldwide
[51:44] revival the charismatics are pushing
[51:45] that thank god
[51:46] that they have a hunger but they're just
[51:48] misdirected to look
[51:50] and one of the ways that we know um
[51:53] by from jesus own words it's only 20 to
[51:56] one so don't worry about the time okay
[51:59] no worries god's not worried about it
[52:01] i'm not worried about it so you
[52:02] shouldn't be worried about it
[52:06] so is there going to be
[52:09] a worldwide revival no there's not but
[52:11] one of the ways jesus taught us
[52:14] how this son of man works when he
[52:17] referred to his ministry of the son of
[52:19] man
[52:20] and then he says there'll be an hour
[52:21] coming where it manifests itself again
[52:23] he prophesies that he says this term he
[52:26] says
[52:26] accept a corn of wheat fall into the
[52:29] ground and die
[52:32] it abideth alone but if it goes in and
[52:35] it dies and then it brings it brings
[52:36] forth much fruit it comes up again
[52:39] so he used nature to show us the nature
[52:42] of the ministry of the son of man jesus
[52:44] christ
[52:45] coming to the generation not only back
[52:47] then because that's what happened is
[52:48] that
[52:49] christ that that uh
[52:53] that grain if you want to call it that
[52:55] that true thing
[52:56] didn't stay by himself but he was put in
[52:58] the ground
[53:00] so just exactly what jesus said and the
[53:02] reason he was put in the ground is that
[53:04] he could bring forth more more of a crop
[53:07] and that's exactly what happened he was
[53:09] put in the ground he resurrected
[53:11] the holy spirit came back on the
[53:12] disciples they took note that they had
[53:14] been with jesus
[53:15] these are not just jesus followers they
[53:17] have jesus within them we see the same
[53:20] works
[53:21] so now we have a crop coming up and so
[53:24] now that's how jesus said to describe
[53:26] this son of man ministry so then
[53:28] now if it's going to repeat in the end
[53:30] time jesus and the people
[53:32] then we see then the church goes through
[53:34] a dark ages
[53:35] and has gone into the ground because
[53:37] jesus said it would so that corn or
[53:39] wheat goes into the ground
[53:40] in other words christ the manifestation
[53:42] of the grain christ
[53:44] now that goes into the ground in the
[53:46] early church in the dark ages
[53:47] and it seemed like everything was over
[53:49] with but it had to go in the ground
[53:51] then springing up as a stalk just the
[53:54] first stage
[53:56] stalk in luther's message luther starts
[53:59] to preach a certain message
[54:01] and that was just a little springing up
[54:03] of that corn of wheat coming out of the
[54:04] ground
[54:04] it's not in the grain yet it's not a
[54:06] full manifestation of the maturity of
[54:08] christ yet
[54:09] but it's just the stock coming up it's
[54:10] in a stage it was a great stage it was
[54:13] wonderful
[54:14] the next stage he grows into is wesley's
[54:17] these reformers coming on
[54:19] the sanctification movement and it comes
[54:21] into the tassel
[54:22] part of the and i'm not a farmer so i
[54:25] don't know all this i'm just
[54:26] going off of what i i read but it's just
[54:29] stages that jesus said look for those
[54:31] stages because you'll know where you're
[54:32] at
[54:34] and we're not in the stock we're not
[54:35] lutheran's day we're not in wesley's day
[54:37] and then the shock
[54:39] which hovers over the grain so it can
[54:41] have a place
[54:42] to hide was pentecost
[54:46] what a great shock that it was matter of
[54:47] fact it resembles the corn of wheat a
[54:49] little bit it actually
[54:50] has such a resemblance but it's not the
[54:53] real thing yet it's not totally the real
[54:55] mature thing yet
[54:56] what a great move of god the pentecost
[54:57] what a great move of god
[55:00] but it's not the final stage
[55:03] so you're right there where brother
[55:05] branham is sent to the pentecostals
[55:08] and they loved his message they loved
[55:09] the healings they loved all this
[55:11] but when he began to really lay in at
[55:13] the final thing
[55:14] the word of god to bring the people to
[55:17] the final
[55:18] stage the shock
[55:21] began to pull away from what was inside
[55:26] without brother brahm saying going away
[55:27] the word just made a separator kind of
[55:29] like when all the
[55:30] 70 left jesus one day they just left him
[55:33] the shock has to pull away
[55:35] why it's time for another stage
[55:38] you're going to have that happen in your
[55:40] life when god's trying to bring the
[55:42] grain and maturity as a son
[55:44] you're going to have people pull away
[55:45] from you family sometimes
[55:48] the shucks gonna pull away don't get
[55:50] nervous about it
[55:52] don't live by your emotions it's
[55:54] probably a good thing for you
[55:55] that the shuck pulls away because god's
[55:58] wanting to take you deeper
[56:00] and you can't do it if someone's just
[56:01] hovering over you and you've got this
[56:03] shucks got to pull away that's the way
[56:07] jesus described it and so now when
[56:08] brother branham comes to that
[56:09] pentecostal he recognizes where we're at
[56:11] you guys want to bring those quotes up
[56:13] that's the way he began to describe it
[56:15] i've got three or four quote
[56:16] quotes here and then we'll wrap this up
[56:19] it says we know that this weed has come
[56:21] through the same process
[56:23] every nature works the same now lord
[56:26] when we see the shuck now pulling away
[56:28] from the grain
[56:29] going worldly oh god grant that those
[56:32] grains will
[56:33] the shock has to pull away so the grain
[56:35] can get in the presence
[56:37] of the sun i hear the coming of the
[56:40] combine lord he's praying here
[56:42] it won't be long and then the great
[56:44] elevator will take up his
[56:46] bride into glory in the presence
[56:49] so there's the final stage the combine
[56:52] is coming
[56:52] the rapture is coming we're getting out
[56:54] of here but there's a stage
[56:56] after the shock pulls away that the
[56:59] grain
[57:00] is in the presence of the sun to ripen
[57:03] and to mature
[57:06] next one go
[57:10] each time he just brings a little bit
[57:11] more and the pentecostal for their stand
[57:13] in their day
[57:14] but we're living in another day we're
[57:17] living when there was
[57:18] has been a stalk tassel shuck
[57:21] almost like the weak wheat but the wheat
[57:24] is inside the shock the shuck has just
[57:26] supported the wheat
[57:27] kept the hot sun from burning it and now
[57:30] the denomination is pulling away from it
[57:33] so it can lay in the presence of the sun
[57:37] to get ripe there it is again
[57:40] the next stage so the grain so that so
[57:44] that
[57:44] you can lay in the presence of the sun
[57:47] to get ripe next one
[57:50] so we're in there won't be no more
[57:52] organizations rise up this is the end
[57:54] of it we've had always about three years
[57:56] when a message starts they organize it
[57:58] this is that was the pattern brother
[57:59] brahm talked about
[58:01] about three years after a move of god
[58:03] comes up they organize it
[58:05] pentecost do that i think it was in two
[58:07] years with pentecost they're already
[58:08] fussing about
[58:09] tongues being the initial evidence of
[58:11] the holy ghost fussing about whether
[58:13] god's a trinity or he's one
[58:15] and so within two or three years
[58:16] pentecost that great move of god on
[58:18] azusa street
[58:19] they're already fussing and they split
[58:22] up because when something's just a
[58:24] reformation
[58:25] and not the grain yet it doesn't have
[58:27] the maturity of christ yet
[58:30] to not divide
[58:34] when you get to the grain there's no
[58:37] denomination to that
[58:39] it's you manifesting christ
[58:43] it's not that you're becoming a part of
[58:44] a church it's not a movement oh i'm in
[58:47] the message glory
[58:48] it's no this isn't going to another
[58:51] movement
[58:52] even though they try to make it a
[58:54] movement
[58:55] what's left there's another one i think
[58:57] isn't there
[59:00] there's one more isn't there let me read
[59:03] it over here
[59:05] the shock has pulled away and we've had
[59:07] 15 years nearly 20 now years of the
[59:09] message
[59:10] sweeping across the nation the nation
[59:11] and this morning hooked up across the
[59:13] nation and no organization
[59:15] it can't organize there has nothing ever
[59:17] been like it and we'll be here after
[59:19] the thing that that's the matter with
[59:20] the message listen to this now the thing
[59:22] that's the matter with the message today
[59:24] is those who obtain it in their hearts
[59:27] must lay in the presence
[59:30] of the sun to get ripened
[59:34] see you can pick up the message and then
[59:36] let the sun bake out
[59:38] all the greenness out of you
[59:41] immaturity see making matured christians
[59:45] you see what i mean
[59:46] god is coming soon to receive his church
[59:49] and we must have that type of christian
[59:51] for him to receive and the wheat has got
[59:54] to get ripe next one
[59:58] and this last great miracle move of god
[1:00:00] in this last days
[1:00:01] it's went 20 years and it's a million
[1:00:04] miles from a denomination going further
[1:00:05] away all the time the shucks pulling
[1:00:07] away
[1:00:08] no cooperation no nothing with it all
[1:00:09] right i see always it pulls away from it
[1:00:12] there can't be no more it's the wheat
[1:00:14] now but we're
[1:00:16] plenty green brother bram just told you
[1:00:20] what you were
[1:00:22] good people we're good people but we're
[1:00:24] plenty green
[1:00:27] we need to mature can you say amen is
[1:00:29] there any more is that it
[1:00:32] would take more if you got it up there
[1:00:34] uh-huh
[1:00:36] that's right have to lay in the presence
[1:00:38] of the sun to be
[1:00:40] mellowed up boy jonah he really needed
[1:00:43] that didn't he
[1:00:44] he needed to be mellowed up but he's not
[1:00:47] just talking about jonah he's talking
[1:00:48] about you
[1:00:49] we need to lay in the presence of the
[1:00:51] sun to be mellowed up that's all of it
[1:00:53] plenty green we haven't got the
[1:00:55] sincerity
[1:00:56] the sacredness the thing we ought to
[1:00:58] have in our midst
[1:01:00] to know that the spirit of the living
[1:01:02] god
[1:01:03] moving in his word and showing us the
[1:01:05] things
[1:01:06] yet that's the stage he's talking about
[1:01:09] here we are in 2000
[1:01:10] whatever 21 here we are
[1:01:15] and i still feel like lord you're
[1:01:18] working on me
[1:01:21] this the mystery of jonah is that he he
[1:01:23] was
[1:01:25] god centered his attention on jonah says
[1:01:28] i am not
[1:01:29] firing this guy i am dealing with him
[1:01:32] and he started to mess with something
[1:01:33] personally said i'm going to teach him a
[1:01:35] lesson
[1:01:35] so when jonah lays out there by the
[1:01:38] booth and gets him some shade by the
[1:01:40] booth
[1:01:40] from the sun he's laying there and god
[1:01:44] says
[1:01:44] i don't know how to i don't know i think
[1:01:47] i'll do it this way
[1:01:49] and so why he's there he does something
[1:01:52] nice for jonah and he
[1:01:53] jonas you know jonah's extremely happy
[1:01:57] just wow this is awesome this shade here
[1:02:00] and i'm just gonna sit and watch nineveh
[1:02:02] and
[1:02:02] see what happens and he wasn't all in he
[1:02:05] should have known what happened when
[1:02:06] they repent god says
[1:02:08] he's gonna let him let him live
[1:02:11] and but but he wasn't he was mad at that
[1:02:14] and then but he was happy when a gourd
[1:02:15] came up
[1:02:16] something personal blessing came up to
[1:02:19] shade him from the sun can you imagine
[1:02:20] somebody
[1:02:22] being mad about nineveh repenting
[1:02:25] and being happy that a little um ivy
[1:02:29] wasn't a gore like we have words today
[1:02:31] it was an ivy plant very big
[1:02:33] it grew very tall strong didn't need to
[1:02:35] be tilted up or anything because we were
[1:02:36] very strong
[1:02:37] and it grew up overnight and just come
[1:02:39] up probably didn't even acknowledge it
[1:02:41] was a supernatural thing that took place
[1:02:43] and he sees that come up and he's the
[1:02:45] happiest man alive
[1:02:47] this is awesome i am so
[1:02:50] happy today i'm so extremely
[1:02:54] excited out of my gourd
[1:03:00] and god sees this guy man he's
[1:03:04] happy about that gourd doesn't even know
[1:03:06] that i put it there overnight
[1:03:08] not giving me glory for it this guy
[1:03:11] needs help
[1:03:12] real bad he's as happy as a little lark
[1:03:15] so you know what
[1:03:17] i'm going to mess with him a little bit
[1:03:20] like he does with you god
[1:03:24] will order things in your life and allow
[1:03:27] things
[1:03:27] to make it go completely the opposite
[1:03:31] of what you wanted
[1:03:36] because he's god
[1:03:41] he does what he wants especially with
[1:03:43] sons
[1:03:46] so then god sent a little worm
[1:03:49] through the night and the worms just
[1:03:51] eating that thing away eating it eating
[1:03:53] it and by
[1:03:53] by morning that whole thing was all ate
[1:03:55] up by the worm
[1:03:57] it's kind of like back when god was in
[1:03:58] the boat god was in the storm god was in
[1:04:00] the fish and now god's in the gourd
[1:04:04] god's in the worm
[1:04:08] when that happened jonah switched
[1:04:12] quickly and he gets mad that the gourd
[1:04:13] is gone and he actually has
[1:04:15] pity on the gourd poor thing man that's
[1:04:18] terrible
[1:04:19] stupid worm
[1:04:23] gorgeous vibrant and giving me shade and
[1:04:27] so
[1:04:27] such a great thing
[1:04:30] stupid worm ate it all up
[1:04:34] still can't see god in it all
[1:04:38] god's just oh this is this looks like
[1:04:41] brother burling
[1:04:47] and then he sends an east vehement east
[1:04:49] wind
[1:04:50] and if you study your bible the east
[1:04:52] wind always represented
[1:04:55] god just allowing chaos to destroy the
[1:04:58] crops and destroy the
[1:05:00] an east wind is a bad wind and god
[1:05:03] allowed an east wind to vehemently
[1:05:05] besides the sun
[1:05:11] the gourd is gone and besides all this
[1:05:12] happening god says i'll be him in it
[1:05:15] he's got the sun burning his head he's
[1:05:16] got a vehement
[1:05:18] violent east wind hitting at him and
[1:05:20] he's just showing him
[1:05:22] jonah watch your emotions because you
[1:05:24] were just so happy
[1:05:25] and he's going to turn mad again so that
[1:05:27] jonah can discover
[1:05:29] you're not living by me you're living
[1:05:33] by your emotions
[1:05:36] and we'll leave it to next sunday but
[1:05:41] god keeps talking to him and we want to
[1:05:43] get into that part that talks about
[1:05:45] god trying to show him you're more
[1:05:48] concerned
[1:05:49] about something trivial in your life
[1:05:53] a little bit of shade a little bit of
[1:05:55] convenience
[1:05:56] a little bit of comfort you're more
[1:05:59] concerned about that
[1:06:00] than these thousands of souls that are
[1:06:04] in nineveh
[1:06:06] i know this is real hard today but he
[1:06:08] just goes joan that's where you're at
[1:06:10] man
[1:06:11] just think about that's where you're at
[1:06:14] you're more concerned about that gourd
[1:06:16] and your emotions are going up and down
[1:06:19] whether your conveniences of life are
[1:06:21] met or not
[1:06:22] and i'm just here to say i love you
[1:06:25] today but i'm going to tell you
[1:06:26] we have got to grow out of life's
[1:06:29] situations thrown at us
[1:06:31] that we're we're we're ready to question
[1:06:34] god we're re we're ready to jump out
[1:06:36] we're ready we these extremes have got
[1:06:39] to stop
[1:06:39] and we got as brother bernie said hold
[1:06:41] our position
[1:06:44] when the vehement wind blows the eastern
[1:06:47] wind
[1:06:47] we stand there and say what is god
[1:06:50] trying to do
[1:06:51] and teach me in my life
[1:06:54] and when we begin to learn that then we
[1:06:57] start to get some victory
[1:07:00] because it won't matter if we have the
[1:07:01] shade or we don't have the shade
[1:07:03] it won't matter that one day you have
[1:07:05] something so nice
[1:07:07] and the next day it's destroyed you
[1:07:09] might have a nice new vehicle
[1:07:10] and all of a sudden it's destroyed the
[1:07:12] next day it's stolen the next day
[1:07:14] we've got to learn that if that happens
[1:07:16] that's not
[1:07:18] the kingdom
[1:07:22] we are to be a people of the kingdom can
[1:07:24] you say amen
[1:07:25] are you a people of the kingdom are you
[1:07:28] awake this morning
[1:07:30] i have to speak up and wake you up
[1:07:33] we are people of the kingdom and when
[1:07:35] jesus taught the kingdom to his
[1:07:36] disciples
[1:07:37] one of the things he's distinguished
[1:07:39] saying the kingdom is not like this
[1:07:41] earth thy kingdom come
[1:07:43] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:07:45] heaven so he's trying to show
[1:07:47] if we're a people of the kingdom the
[1:07:49] kingdom is
[1:07:50] bigger than your problems the kingdom is
[1:07:53] bigger than your trials
[1:07:54] the kingdom this message is bigger than
[1:07:57] your life situations
[1:08:00] and you may come through them and you
[1:08:01] will come through them and you'll grow
[1:08:03] through them
[1:08:04] but always remember the kingdom is
[1:08:06] what's important the kingdom is what we
[1:08:08] serve
[1:08:08] what can i do for god for god's kingdom
[1:08:11] how can i serve god's kingdom can you
[1:08:13] say amen
[1:08:14] how can i manifest the character of his
[1:08:17] kingdom
[1:08:19] i'm a son and daughter of the king let's
[1:08:22] start manifesting
[1:08:23] king's kids and what king's kids act
[1:08:25] like
[1:08:27] i'm a i'm a child of the kingdom i'm
[1:08:30] growing into an adult of the kingdom and
[1:08:33] i want to manifest
[1:08:34] my father and express him in
[1:08:38] in his ways to this world whether i am
[1:08:41] at work
[1:08:42] whether i'm at school whether i'm
[1:08:45] up or down and my life is in shambles
[1:08:49] whether i don't know how i'm going to
[1:08:50] pay the bills next week
[1:08:53] i'm still a son of a king
[1:08:58] and the african slave conducted himself
[1:09:01] that way
[1:09:02] when he was being beaten when he was
[1:09:05] being sold
[1:09:06] when he was in another country that they
[1:09:08] didn't know who he was
[1:09:10] he in his behavior acted in his behavior
[1:09:14] like a king's son how many know the
[1:09:17] story
[1:09:18] we're in a different world tries to
[1:09:21] teach us to act like them
[1:09:22] and react emotionally and
[1:09:26] you know i'm in a bunch of financial
[1:09:28] ruins so now i'm going to go get in a
[1:09:30] bunch of debt to fix the problem
[1:09:32] that may not be the right answer so a
[1:09:35] king son
[1:09:35] says let me go to my father
[1:09:38] and see how he wants me to handle the
[1:09:40] situation let me be led
[1:09:42] by the spirit of god because the bible
[1:09:44] says sons of god
[1:09:46] are led by the spirit of god
[1:09:49] amen oh
[1:09:52] jonah is an example of us all
[1:09:56] but that's a good thing because he was a
[1:09:59] son
[1:10:01] and god focused his attention on him
[1:10:03] because he loved him
[1:10:04] and he was going to stay with him until
[1:10:08] god had made him what he wanted him to
[1:10:11] be
[1:10:13] god's sticking with you god's going to
[1:10:15] stay with you god's going to keep
[1:10:17] working with you
[1:10:21] he's still working on me
[1:10:24] to make me what i want to be
[1:10:28] he wants me to be it took him just a
[1:10:30] week to make the moon
[1:10:32] and stars the sun and the earth
[1:10:35] and jupiter and mars how
[1:10:38] loving and patient he must be

[1:11:23] heart
[1:11:24] don't judge me yet there's an unfinished
[1:11:28] part
[1:11:29] but i'll be perfect just according to
[1:11:33] his plan

[1:12:07] in the mirror of his word in the mirror
[1:12:09] of his word
[1:12:11] reflections that i see makes me wonder
[1:12:15] why he never
[1:12:16] gave up on me but he loves me as i am
[1:12:21] and helps me when i pray remember he's
[1:12:25] the partner

[1:14:50] it's amazing somebody like jonah can
[1:14:51] become so hard
[1:14:53] i don't know his backstory i don't know
[1:14:55] where he come from where he got all this
[1:14:56] anger
[1:14:58] but his brother says it's an example of
[1:15:00] all of us
[1:15:01] but you don't want to continue in that
[1:15:03] anger you don't want to be continue hard
[1:15:06] it's not going to be good for everybody
[1:15:08] else it's certainly not going to be good
[1:15:09] for you
[1:15:10] it's not going to accomplish christ
[1:15:12] being glorified in your life
[1:15:14] there's an altar you can lay it at this
[1:15:16] morning give up let jesus take over
[1:15:19] trust him enough
[1:15:22] help me raise your hand and say i want
[1:15:24] to give up and let jesus take over my
[1:15:26] life
[1:15:26] i've been in the message but i don't
[1:15:29] want to be
[1:15:30] in the message i want the message to be
[1:15:31] in me
[1:15:33] i want the grain christ to be manifested
[1:15:36] in my life
[1:15:37] more than ever before the walls that you
[1:15:40] have
[1:15:40] up if you break them down and ask the
[1:15:44] lord to break them down
[1:15:45] you're going to find a freedom on the
[1:15:47] other side which i never enjoyed before
[1:15:50] such joy jesus said
[1:15:54] i pray that you'll give them joy not
[1:15:56] like the world
[1:15:58] but you give them life and life more
[1:16:01] abundantly that's what he promised
[1:16:04] heavenly father
[1:16:10] learning something lord that the message
[1:16:12] was right but jonah wasn't right
[1:16:15] lord if you focused on him if you could
[1:16:17] get him lined up and
[1:16:18] get his spirit cleaned out and
[1:16:23] get him to give up his anger his extreme
[1:16:26] emotions and just trust you
[1:16:28] and he could be the right kind of person
[1:16:30] to bring the message
[1:16:31] and to live the message
[1:16:35] such a mystery behind this life lord
[1:16:39] there's hope and there's mercy and
[1:16:40] there's grace and there's strength
[1:16:43] for us to grow in this sun to lay in the
[1:16:46] presence of the sun
[1:16:48] you can make all the greenness out of us
[1:16:50] lord
[1:16:51] because we're plenty green take us in
[1:16:54] this stage lord and
[1:16:56] bake all the greenness out and bring
[1:16:57] that mature grain of christ that you're
[1:17:00] wanting to see from our lives but truly
[1:17:03] christ is glorified
[1:17:04] what we say and do what we think
[1:17:08] take this group of people lord you've
[1:17:10] already loved them before the foundation
[1:17:11] of the world you love them
[1:17:12] your love has been proven to them lord
[1:17:15] may they learn to love you back by
[1:17:17] giving such a surrender to you break the
[1:17:19] strongholds of the enemy
[1:17:21] break the things that are hard stoney
[1:17:23] break them lord
[1:17:25] god i pray that you develop such a trust
[1:17:28] and love that they would reach out
[1:17:30] toward you
[1:17:31] commit this service to you lord and the
[1:17:33] fruits of it in the name of jesus christ
[1:17:36] in my floor
