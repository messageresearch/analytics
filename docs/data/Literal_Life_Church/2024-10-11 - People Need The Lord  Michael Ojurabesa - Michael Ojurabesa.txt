That's When

Verse 1:
Everyday they pass me by
I can see it in their eyes
Empty people filled with care
Headed who knows where

On they go through private pain
Living fear to fear
Laughter hides their silent cries
Only Jesus hears

Chorus:
People need the Lord, people need the Lord
At the end of broken dreams, He's the open door
People need the Lord, people need the Lord
When will we realize people need the Lord?

Verse 2:
We are called to take His light
To a world where wrong seems right
What could be too great a cost
For sharing life with one who's lost?

Through His love our hearts can feel
All the grief they bear
They must hear the words of life
Only we can share

Written by Greg Nelson and Phill Mchugh
