live too far from here that'll argue all night that he wasn't god well I know better okay Luke 8 and verse 1 and he came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and Village preaching and showing the Glad Tidings of the kingdom of God and the 12 were with him that's 13 people right okay so far so good and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary Magdalene of whom went Seven Devils now we got 14 and Joanna the wife of chusa Herod Stewart and Susanna and many others which ministered unto to him of their substance father we thank you for your

your people give us the grace we need we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated and before we go any further I'll have the camp piano player sister Lara come up here and uh help me with a song this song is very special because a long time ago when I was a young man like you or younger I was at lunch one day with brother random first visit in jonville and he said I want you to sing tonight in the Tabernacle me Baptist Tabernacle yeah that and I said what in the world would I sing I me I'm new here he said well we're going to have a prayer line tonight and so he said um it'd be nice if you could sing then Jesus came well we didn't sing that song in the Baptist Church you know but I learned it that day and he was very thankful he was proud that his daughter was playing it for the first time in church and tonight uh Laura and I would like to try to sing it for you [Music] one sat alone beside the highway be his eyes were blind the light he could not see he clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows then Jesus came and B his Darkness flee when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when Jesus comes the tears are wiped away he takes the Gloom and he fills the life with glory for all is changed when Jesus comes to stay unclean unclean the leper cried in torment the death the dumb the lessness stood near the fever AG disease had stripped its victim then Jesus came and cast out every fear when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when Jesus comes the tears are wiped away he takes the gloom and he fills the life with glory for all is changed when Jesus comes to stay so men today have found the Savior able they could not coner passion lust and sin sin their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely then Jesus came and dwelt himself within when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when Jesus comes temp wiped away he takes the Gloom and he fills the life with glory for all is changed when Jesus comes to stay amen thank you okay Jesus and three women let get this organized here a little better um scripture records many women follow Jesus they're all aware of that now we're in a Bible believing church right we're not following fables okay some of the women are named and many are not now thank God we have a Bible with details we have a detailed uh account of all these things and um we thank God that he has sent us a restoration Prophet as promised in scripture he was a Godly Man man he was a prophet he knew what he was talking about and God backed him up and so he's restored us back to the original Faith back to the original word and uh we have a sure word from God it's not fables it's a truth from God and uh it's not a matter of you know God God is Not Like Us well let's see if this will work you know uh I wonder if this will work this way no God is God and um he's perfect he knows the end from the beginning and God is always in balance and that's one of the reasons we carry this and we don't know if it's going to stay here first we got to check the pulpit yeah okay good show we're in good shape and so in the times of Jesus women did not commonly travel with a rabbi that's a religious teacher okay religious leader they had very strict codes of conduct back then that put a distance between women and the Jewish leaders so much so that by the time Jesus came along uh a rabbi was not even allowed to speak to his wife in public yeah imagine that she was back there about three steps with four kids and uh yeah they had some laws now these religious laws were put in place to ensure moral Purity but we've all become adults now and we know that there's no such laws work and so um the um uh the Jewish men in general and the teachers of the law in particular such as Jesus and Pharisees and those that you know knew the word they were to have as little to do with women as possible then Jesus came on the scene and it was in fulfillment of scripture and didn't just happen to be you know we have storms that come up and well they sometimes they predict them sometimes they don't know you know they come up well that's not the way the word works the Prophet said it and it comes to pass so not only did Jesus speak to women in public he dared to take them by the hand yeah I touched them and encouraged them to follow the truth and there's no indication anywhere that Jesus ever discouraged women from being his followers okay and um this probably offended many Jews and many people are offended in the 21st century when God blesses one of our ladies they're not second class citizens they are our sisters we're going to reign with them and they have a special place now when they get out of that place then we got a problem you know like you know other places so balance is not an option it's essential it's not a choice you must have balance now when you read the New Testament you're going to find that women listen carefully to his teachings I'd like to hear some of the women such as you say Amen just not that that's what we do in Tennessee uh the women accompanied him on his travels like we just read the women stood at the crucifixion where was The Mighty disciples only John was there the others are over there in the shade someplace you know barely hear their amen um women gave witness to the resurrection and they eventually helped spread the message throughout the Roman world we got a whole study on the book of Acts that shows that so in those days a long time ago long ways from here there was a Godly family that uh had their children and uh we're not going to call it Sunday school but they it wasn't invented till 1750 but they had Bible class at home they prayed they studied their scripture they you know had their devotions and um they followed Prophet Moses as close as they could they learned to quote his words walking in the truth of the hour as they saw it and uh but one day one of the girls in the family uh began to have be friends with some of the other girls in the neighborhood they weren't quite as Godly let's say and they began to um uh fill her ahead with some other ideas and wear the shirt the skirts a little shorter and uh have different friends and um very different from the teachings at home okay and Satan drove the wedge and she began walking another path away from the truth that she had learned at home maybe several years we don't know but one day case number one how many women three okay let see if everybody's awake and so case number one is John 4 and verse three if you got your Bible be sure and look it up because you never know a preacher sometimes get mixed up John CH 4:3 um uh Jesus is uh departing from Galilee says there in verse three he left Judea and departed unto Galilee so he's going north okay and verse four and he must needs go through Samaria wonder why CU he had a vision from the father there's a sheep over there it needs attention so you need to stop over there on your way and so um uh this is probably the the one person that's mentioned more than anybody else in the Bible by William Brandon he always comes back to the woman at the well one way or another and so he needed to go there and so from Jerusalem to sikar is about about 32 miles he arrives about noon see verse 5 then he came to the city of Samaria which is called sikar near the parcel of ground uh that Jacob gave to his son now Jacob's Well was there and guess what it's still there yeah from Genesis 22 it's still there I've been there once because there's some troublemakers around there they don't like tourists so the well was still there and um he was wearied from his journey sat next to the well and it was about the 6th hour and we're not going to argue too long about what time it was prophet said it was about noon time he's hungry he's tired he's sitting there he sent the disciples into town to get some sandwiches and so all of a sudden there comes a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus didn't not waste any time hey how are you how's Grandma no give me a drink all of a sudden okay so he knew what the rules were like we just mentioned and um he uh he knew exactly what he was doing okay now the honorable women such as you ladies would come in the early morning or in the evening see they didn't have faucets back then you had to go out there maybe three blocks or a half a mile or whatever get the water bring it in you used it very carefully and so uh the the the women such as this lady here this woman at the point at this point um they would have to go in the middle of the day when it's 100° yeah because she was a prostitute okay and so uh he's there waiting you know for the guys to come back with the lunch and she comes out give me a drink and so um the disciples were gone and they had segregation verse 9 and he said to the woman of Samaria and the woman the woman of Samaria said to him how is it that you being a Jew ask a drink of me and I'm a woman of Samaria Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans and so Jesus was the one he he he was the bridge okay he formed the bridge he served as a bridge he came open a new way everyone was welcome to participate he that turned the world upside down and that's why we call it 2022 because from his life this way it's one set of numbers back there it's another set of numbers this turned everything upside down and so um the bridge is very accurately described in in John 3:16 right across the page uh where he says that um God so loved the world now see that's the Pope's favorite scripture right there one of them and but that's as far as he goes see that he he loved the world so much he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already why because he didn't believe in what in the name of the only begotten Son of God okay so there's no discrimination God loved the whole world the whole world is willing to follow though so this way is only for serious Believers it's not for agnostics it's not for people looking for fault and all that it's no it's not for doubters and markers agnostics and uh it's not a game it's not a religion in case you hadn't noticed so far but it's a only path to eternal life and the only way you're going to get to heaven is start at the foot of the cross it doesn't matter who your daddy is who your grandpa was what your name is no you got to start at the foot of the cross we all have same start at the same place in the message we have found him 1954 Jesus Christ came here on Earth and he talked to a woman at the well which was a Samaritan and him being a Jew just a difference in race and he let him know right quick there was no difference in the races God was seeking those that would worship Him in spirit and in truth so they had segregation no dealings no Fellowship but Jesus was the way maker he was the bridge verse 10 and Jesus after she you know come up with this business about no dealings he says if you knew the gift of God and who it is that says to thee give me a drink you would ask him and he would give you uh The Living Water Well he goes on talking about water extending the conversation and all the time he's Discerning her case you see and finally down verse 15 she responds and she said well sir give me this water that I thirst not neither have to come clear out here to get the water and um and then he got straight to the point verse 16 go call your husband and come here ah he does hit the sore point you know now our sister because she's she wasn't then she was just prostitute but she became our sister and we don't know her name but when we get there we'll find out so our sister was probably very beautiful now we're not going to dwell on the fact that there are some that are more beautiful than others but that's beside the point but she was probably very beautiful and she had no trouble attracting men that wasn't her problem her problem was keeping the man she was thirsting for something she didn't know how to satisfy that Godly thirst see because nothing else will satisfy you can buy cars you can do all these things only God can satisfy that thirst and um and just the night before she had attracted this last one and she wasn't too sure about him now that's on tape okay verse 17 and the woman answered and said I have a husband and Jesus said youve told the truth that you have no husband for you honey have had five and the one you have now isn't yours so you spoke the truth oh now she's totally uncovered can't hide nothing from this guy yeah and verse 19 and the woman said sir I perceive that you are a prophet so she goes into her Declaration of her belief verse 20 and the differences that they had so because when he spoke to her telling her about her past and her present and so forth and all these details it probably made her very uncomfortable now I'm one of the few eyewitnesses left and it's a great responsibility and people oh how is it well sometimes it was uncomfortable being around William Brandon you know a man can see right through you you can't come up with some story got to tell the truth and so she was probably quite uncomfortable at this point and so um she goes immediately into her uh defense and her ideas of of race and religion because the Samaritans were experts on defense why because right near where they were standing was Mount ebal okay it's in scripture Moses commanded enough when you all get into the holy land when you get into the promised land he built an altar commemorating you know the Victory and got in and so forth and that's where Joshua renewed The Covenant with God in Joshua chapter 8 but the Samaritans had a different idea yeah just like today William Bram said this yeah but I think this over here might work a little better well I'm here to tell you it won't better stick with what he said and so nearby was Mount gasim and to them that was the M that was a place of worship and they built an altar um in 400 BC but 272 years later the Jews destroyed that altar on on Mount garison bringing you know greater enmity between the two groups so the woman at the well had plenty of ammunition and she didn't mind using it on this stranger okay but he calmed her down verse 21 woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the father you guys worship what you don't even know uh we know what we worship because salvation of the Jews but the hour is coming when uh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth balanced you can have a lot of spirit as long as all this music's going oh man about to tear the place down they do that in these churches not too far from here or you can have a lot of Truth and Freeze ice cubes on the seats it's got to be balanced okay it's not rocket science I I figured it out and so um uh spirit and the truth the woman said to him I know the messiah's coming which is called Christ when he comes he'll tell us all these things H Jesus said I that speak to thee am he now why would she come up with this line here that when the Messiah come and so forth because back there at home she had paid attention to bible class they had taught her the truth and part of it was lodged up here and she we don't know how long she's on this detour and we don't know why it's none of our business but she was in front of the Fountain of Truth and she recognized it so she' paid attention and some of it was lodged in her memory and she had been a long time on this detour all she KN needed was an encounter with the Fountain of Truth she had a correct Spirit she not did not reject him her spirit was right all she needed was more truth that's what some of our relatives and some of our neighbors need you know they they they there's good Catholics there's good all kinds of people they just need presented correctly you see okay so she had representation in heaven she was an elect seat of God and once she got a small drink of that special water it was all over she became an overcomer brother Bram says just take a drink from there from the Everlasting water ever everpresent water you'll never have to hear another sermon on morals how to dress how to act how to conduct yourself but you got to participate you can't come in here and get the free air conditioning and go out and play talk about NASCAR you got to participate and get involved you see and be responsible that too many people hear the word all they hear it it goes round and round and they never take a drink that's the problem they don't actually participate and take responsibility of manifesting what they heard because your life speaks louder than your words it doesn't matter what you say most of us have raised little children and and it doesn't matter really what you say it's how you say it it's how you approach the problem you see and um I don't know if any of you was raised Catholic but in the Catholic Church they have a lot of saints and you know famous people well one of is Francis of AIS he was a Italian priest about 900 years ago and brother Brandon said he was a gospel preacher so we'll just take his word for that and so Francis of AIS uh said one time that um he said you need to preach always use words when necessary well how does that work well William Brandon gave you the 21st century version he says live your message yeah so it doesn't matter what you you know what you talk it's how you live so after she participated after she you know re received she understood didn't take 3 months it was instantly uh the woman at the well was instantly turned into a lady a lady with something to tell okay she took one drink from the inexhaustible Fountain of Living Water Prophet says over here in a man running from the presence of the Lord um and let me just tell you something about that message that's February 17th of 65 um brother Brandon had promised for some time I'm going to be in Jeffersonville we're going to preach on the what's it the and divorce and so he'd been promising okay so February you know L later half of of February of 65 so the kids are School in Tucson so he drives by himself gets in station wagon takes off it's about 32 hours he didn't get a motel get tired he stop take a power nap for about 20 minutes and go on so he gets to jonville real early on a Wednesday morning services are going to be Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and he's prepared for four Services well he gets there Sunday uh Wednesday morning and he um uh uh thought well I can't sit up here at the church you know here at the house down there at church all the people are gathered getting ready for the service I'll go down and get some inspiration well he goes in brother Neville saw him coming in Hey Brother Bill come here well he's got nothing he's not prepared and he preaches that great message a man running from the presence of the Lord okay so in the prayer he says let the great holy spirit that came down on the mountain the other day there Tucson um saturate every heart in here with his goodness and mercy with understanding we realize father that's what we need is to understand for if we do not know what we're doing then how do we know how to do it wish I could come up with questions like that you know but we must have understanding as Daniel said he had understanding by the prophet Jeremiah's writing and father we have understanding by the holy spirit's writing as he will reveal to us in this hour I mean there's so much right there in that one prayer preached for a week as we have as he will reveal it to us we don't know everything there is to know we know enough to get to church now get home we know how to do certain things but as we have need he will reveal it to us you know the five and six year olds we're not going to give them the keys to the car although they'd like to have it when they have need it'll be revealed and so if I could prove to you how deep or how thick the uh the streets of gold are what good would it do it's only for those that get there so all the things on the other side of the Resurrection it's only for those that get there so let's just get there you know so over here in 2022 those that love the Lord Jesus which Narrows down pretty much you know they have understanding by the words of prophet William brandham because in the days of the voice okay and um it's the only one of all the messengers that's recorded rest of them are written and even back then people a lot of people couldn't read so the true minister of today says what's already been said not a private interpretation no opinions no explanations we don't need all that stuff just let it live out naturally so the woman at the well is case number one she came in contact with the author of Life took one drink of the water and instantly turned into a lady and then she ran to tell others see she got into action and um she couldn't keep it to herself okay case number two we got till 10 o00 right you'll stay awake right okay case number two John chapter 8 go over a couple Pages I'm just uh just kidding you John chapter 8 uh verse one Jesus went into the Mount of Olives wait a minute where was he oh look at the verse before that verse 53 and every man went to his own house and guess what Jesus didn't have a house no and Jesus went into the Mount of Olives what's he doing over there well back then and we got to just take some time explain this see back then it's called Mount of Olives because it was all olive trees okay they they they harvested them and they weren't harvesting for the pizza they were harvesting for lights they didn't have these kind of lights so they harvest the the the the olives and they would squeeze them out big Stones not only the the the the Flesh of the olive but the seed you know it's as hard as this desk they would get all the oil out and they would process it come into a little little thing and that was their light so that's they had a it was a business so wherever they had olive trees there was an olive press there someplace because they didn't have trucks to carry it way off like they do today and so on the Mount of Olives he wasn't sleeping under the trees there was a place where they would go and I think less than 200 years ago they found the cave on Mount of Olives where there's the olive press and sometimes when we go over there we can visit there maybe even have a service there okay so he's over there in this cave they're spending the night and early in the morning came again to the temple that's about 600 yards away and all the people which a group of Believers this wasn't everybody a group of Believers um he sat down and taught them okay so here here's Jesus early morning church maybe before breakfast sitting down there teaching a crowd of people and a group of very arrogant Pharisees showed up appeared on the scene with a woman no doubt had her by the hand you know she wasn't going to get loose and um drug her in there she wasn't dressed well she was hair wasn't combed and they interrupt the teacher they put her right in the middle of of what's going on and they posed a loaded question and see each one of them probably had a few rocks in their pocket cuz they meant business okay and um and they're very legal very ready to judge verse four where it says that um and they said unto Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Prophet Moses blessed the Lord the law commanded us that such should be stoned what do you say so trying to drive a wedge they trying to make him look small somehow well first of all they're only half right because Moses said bring both of them and stone them well they only got the woman okay so we're already you know 50% off and um and so what happens here you know their job was to make Jesus look bad so he acts like he doesn't hear what you know he just kind of ignores him he goes down starts writing in the sand now we don't know what he wrote okay we're not going to argue about that goes down rights in the sand they probably thought he's down there looking for some rocks to help him yeah and um so when they finished talking he stands up he heard everything and he looked around he said well I'll tell you what guys the one of you that doesn't have one sin you never stole a pet of bread you never stole a cookie you never looked wrong at a woman you throw the first rock H scripture says in verse 9 and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest to the last and there's Jesus alone with the woman standing in the midst so um in verse 10 and Jesus when he lifted up because he went back down you know while they were deciding um he saw only the woman he said theom where where's your accusers does no man condemn thee she said no man Lord and Jesus said neither do I condemn thee go and sin No More Jesus has forgiveness it doesn't matter how how far you went or how far you ran he has forgiveness you see so by discernment he was able to see her entire life neither do I condemn you so once again a woman received life from the lifegiver now this is just basic scripture this isn't you know bringing Heaven down just get in your Bible that's the problem I find in my travels people don't read their Bible the the promise was I'm going to send you uh Prophet Elijah is going to turn your head your heart back we get into the book that he opened up so she went away turned into a real lady she went away hope live a new life but you see history repeats religious leaders precise keepers of the prophetic word had a lot of Truth oh they were just you know 100% truth all kinds of truth but no spirit in fact they had a bad Spirit arrogant selfish full of Pride demeaning always pointing the finger at somebody that wasn't following it exactly the way thought they thought thought it should be we still got them today they were the epitome of arrogance so our Prophet says that I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine but right in my heart than be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart because if you're right in your heart you will end up at the right Doctrine but if you got the doctrine so perfect you might never get to the right Spirit see so may God help us so spirit and truth they must have balance Prophet says over here in early experiences 1952 some people when they get born again they sit right in the middle of the road Eyes On Christ finally they get way over here so much knowledge and wisdom oh they know it all and you don't know nothing and if they don't do that they go clear the other side wildfire and fanaticism that's right we're right in the middle of the road there's the true sound unadulterated gospel and power of God that's balance okay now so we must find balance we'll get it here in a little bit recently Pope Francis said we have to find a new balance now see that sounds good sounds compassionate God loves everybody but the balance we need is right here in God's word just get in here you know and and you know I I I hate to keep picking on him but you know he's got a very important position now how did he get there not knowing the Bible we assume he knows Bible better than anybody well that's not true okay so everything we say or do is governed by a spirit either God or Satan see brother Bram says you follow the scriptures and see if the spirit follows the scripture any spirit that does not follow the scripture is a wrong Spirit Well that's you know easy to follow so moving on to case number three Luke chapter 7 let's go back here just a little bit Luke chapter 7 is where Jesus is preaching and praying for the sick and I need a little bit of a prop here um yeah we uh should have done this before but see Jesus was moving around and preaching and praying for the sick in a lot of places right and so a a messenger comes to him and he says you know down there where I come from in Jerusalem is uh Simon and he's a rich man he's going to have a big party and he wants you to be there sir well Jesus knew what he was doing he said I'll be there it's right there in chapter 7 they didn't have cell phones if you had somebody you wanted somebody to know something over in you know Cleveland you had to go over there or send somebody with a note there was no no phones so Jesus arrived on time but he wasn't welcome imagine that how could that possibly be well one thing he didn't have the light over him like you know the Romans painted it he was just dressed like the rest of us and so he come somehow he got got in uh he wasn't welcomed he's sitting over there by himself excuse me and uh so the um the uh Pharisee he prepared a big Feast of course brother Bram dramatized it you know and they had uh it was outside and they had the smokes going over the fence and everybody's you know going by and smelling oh wow enough meat to feed the whole village so Jesus on time and uh the Romans going over the in the the town and people passing by they would peek through the little hole in the wall and see what's going on oh yeah another Feast well one insignificant woman came by and she looked through the little hole in the wall and she looked and somehow she recognized that's Jesus sitting over there now she had heard about her friend up at the temple case number two see that had been healed of her you know problem being prostitute turned into a nice lady she had a nice family had a nice house she'd heard and now she sees there's Jesus H and um and and she even noticed that he had Dirty Feet now you wonder how is that possible well guess what I was over in Africa well it's been about 10 years now andan I mean there's not even 100 people here but over there there's 6,000 people okay they don't speak English so here we were preaching with the translator soon as I got done Pastor jumps up and he says now we don't I don't know when brother George is coming back but has anybody got a question what can you imagine so these questions come up they got to be translated then translate the answer well this goes on and on you know all they have is time where they going to go 6,000 people and there's there's 12 cars outside and you know and about 100 motorcycles and 300 bicycles everybody else walked well anyway so so this goes on and on and so the only question I remember remember I know it's pretty lame of me but the only question I remember uh this one sister said well since the Lord took your wife while you still wearing the ring wow people notice everything man you know so so this well I told her I said because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't until death do his part it's for eternity oh okay well satisfied them so this lady she's looking through the wall she sees the dirty feet how is is this possible she had heard about her friend and she she knew how that Jesus had forgiven her and changed her life and she thought this is my only opportunity this is never going to repeat you know chances that are very very small and so she um uh what' she do she got into action right now she got into action and it was her only opportunity what' she do she ran home and she got into the mattress and got her money and she goes down to the drug store store and when the drugas are coming what do you want here well I come to make a purchase okay come on in and she said now look we heard that way up on that shelf you got a Alabaster Box and you got some got some real special ointment oh honey that cost money and so she got her money out of course being good Jew you know he counted it three times okay I guess I got to sell it to you so he gets it down and he gets it to her and so she rushes back to the party and somehow she got in without being noticed too there must have been you know having a lot of noise or something so we're in chapter 7 of Luke and verse 38 okay she's at the Pharisees house she's got the alabaster box and she stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and wiped the tears with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now you read that you know at least 100 times so most of the paintings that we have of Jesus and the disciples you know at the supper they're sitting in chairs the way we do you know the big table but those are painted that was painted by Italian artist hundreds of years later the fact of the matter is back then the table was that you know right down there that was the table and so they were sitting on carpet or or cushions or something so they're sitting down like this and you know eating and his feet are behind him it said right there she stood At His Feet behind him washing his feet that doesn't happen the way we sit and that's why it says that okay and so um they um she's there washing his feet and verse 39 and when the Pharisee which invited him saw this he thought in his you know mind this man if he was a prophet he would know what kind of a sorry person that is and she's touching him she's a sinner you see these kind of people that we're talking about we probably wouldn't let them in well we probably let him in your church but a lot of churches wouldn't let him in you see she's a sinner well how'd she get in your place in the first place and Jesus said un Simon so he you know discerned him right away Simon I've got a little something I want to tell you well Simon's thinking man he's going to bless me for all this expense you know because all this meat I bought and everything you know and he says Master say on you know so he gives him a little story you know he says he there was this banker and he had two debtors and they had no money one owed him 500 and the other owed him 50 and uh when the banker saw that they couldn't pay well he you know he forgave both of them so tell me Simon which of those do you think loved him the most now all the eyes are on Simon oh he's got to come up with the right answer so he says well I suppose um that he to to whom he forgave the most and he said the right answer you judged right pressures off you know he got the gold star yeah and so um and so then he turns to the woman he hasn't he she's just back there he didn't pay any attention to her yet so he turns to the woman but he's still talking to Simon you see this woman I came into your house you gave me no water for my feet but she's been washing my feet with her tears and she's wiped them with her long curly hair yeah I know we're gramz a little bit and uh you gave me no kiss but This Woman's been kissing my feet you know and uh you gave me no oil for my head but this woman is Anointed my feet with ointment and KN he knew exactly how much she paid and so forth and she said wherefore I say unto thee so he's looking at her he's talking to Simon her sins which are many are forgiven because she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same uh loveth little which kind of infers that that's Simon you know and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven that's all he said to her four words in our language and um and all these other people sitting there you know feasting who's this That Forgives sins also and he said to the woman your faith has safy go in peace her life changed you see Simon the very important Pharisee had memorized a lot of the Torah he knew truth because see in Acts 15 it tells us that every Sabbath they read a portion of their spoken word book of Moses this last Saturday when you were having a big time down there well the the the the Jews had their service on Saturday around the world and they read a portion of Moses their spoken word book so he knew a lot of that see and um memorized a lot of truth but he had no Revelation no spirit so he wasn't balance she's all you know and um and so the woman with all her baggage she had the right spirit and that Spirit took her to the truth and Jesus said thy faith has saved thee go in peace she was completely changed and God is still in the life changing business today for any age no matter where you've been what you've done there's hope I know people that have been to the to the worst of the worst of the worst and God has changed them it's a change in Attitude a change of life I mean Billy Graham preached it all the time William Brandon preached it you see yeah but I'm not as bad as those people I live clean really you're still a filthy sinner you still need to come to the foot of the cross so um if you don't you will be left behind it's Bible but you see the church is like a hospital no there's nobody checking papers at the door there's no credit card machine out there you know it's like a hospital and the great physician is still in business Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life all you have to say is yes Lord I'll follow I'll drop all my crazy ideas and I'll follow you it's real simple so these are only three examples of many people that Jesus had to deal with because he uh he uh had a long Ministry and John said over here in in John 21:25 and there are also many other things which Jesus did which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even in the world they could not contain the books that should be written in three and A2 years so these are just three examples the way the TR the truth and the life in Matthew 25:37 he's uh Jesus is you know still answering the questions of of of of Matthew 24 and he says over here in um where we at in 2537 that um he's uh he's telling him about the kingom of God in verse 37 then shall the righteous answer it saying Lord um when do we see you hungry and fed thee or thirsty and give you drink when do we when do we see you as a stranger took you in or naked and gave you clothes or when do we see you sick and so forth and the King shall answer and say verily I say unto you in as much as you have done this unto one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me that's part of the Gospel also and so he's not talking about second graders or third graders he's talking about people that are less fortunate than us see everybody doesn't have a nice building like this everybody doesn't have $440,000 car like we have you know and so every day of my life you know in the last 10 years we're dealing with Believers in other countries especially right now in Venezuela uh where they don't have any food they cannot afford when the whole family gets together there's 23 people it cost $100 a day to feed these people where are they going to get it they don't pay them enough to pay for bus Fair really and um uh some have only two changes of clothes some people have one pair of shoes it's pathetic so I can't enjoy too much knowing that and so uh some some people need a place to sleep they the it's either on the street or we help them somehow you know and uh some need help with their worn out vehicle but God provides day by day by day and so we we send packages they get their fine and and you know Paul said over here in 1 Corinthians 10 um all these things speaking of the Old Testament happen for examples and are written for our admonition other words that we might learn by it who upon whom the ends of the world are come well the ends of the world weren't coming on them right down they're coming on us we're the end time generation see we're the ones upon whom the ends of the world are come so trying to finish up here in the choosing of a bride and this is something you might not have heard before but I think it's paragraph 147 she the woman was not in the original creation all of the females are in the original creation the bird male female animals so forth but in human life God only made a man he took from him and the woman is a byproduct of a man because God did not Institute such a thing in other words it wasn't original creation search the scriptures and then he says but if she that's you ladies and bride in particular in general if she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than man she's on a testing ground so there's hope for for ladies today but you got to stay balanced it's not an option so there is a great reward we are on a testing ground we live in Lea but the fact that God predestinated us to live at this time and know these great truths it's wonderful you see that's a testament to the fact that he has confidence that you will be more than a conqueror uh over lead DEA and according to John 4 uh that we read he's seeking those that worship Him in spirit and in truth stay balanced so what's the formula for balance here we go every day from the least to the oldest yeah even you sister I'm still older than you every day you read at least one chapter of your Bible or more at least one chapter you read one page out of your church age book you pray at all times and you listen to at least 20 minutes of God's prophit you do those four things and you will prosper as an individual the church will prosper and you will be balanced in spirit and in truth try it see if it works when I come back in 6 months you tell me if it worked WR so may God bless you and we will be back as soon as possible and we do have some books back here in the fellowship hall so when you get out go back there and see what's available see if you have them all and uh if there's not enough we can send you some thank you for your attention
