[4:17] in the morning I gotta kill somebody
[4:24] [Music]
[4:28] one by one
[4:34] [Music]
[4:37] time
[4:54] Jump Right In Here where we left off and
[4:58] maybe we'll just title this in different
[5:00] title tonight uh the Reason God reveals
[5:03] our thoughts the Reason God reveals our
[5:07] thoughts and don't forget in this series
[5:09] is actually coming from a series that
[5:12] I'm bringing out of Psalms one the
[5:14] reason we're into this thing about the
[5:16] thought life is there's one scripture in
[5:18] Psalms one one through three that talks
[5:21] about the man that is blessed and it
[5:24] talks about where he positions himself
[5:26] and it talks about him thinking upon the
[5:29] things of God and meditating upon them
[5:31] day and night and so because it's
[5:34] emphasizing a blessed man's thought life
[5:36] being under control I thought it
[5:38] necessary to take some time in our
[5:40] thought life and so but we're in the
[5:42] series if you want to be reminded of
[5:43] what we're going back to it's this
[5:45] blessed man of God who walketh not in
[5:47] the accounts of the ungodly nor sinneth
[5:50] in the way of the seed of the scornful
[5:52] and so it's all about position it's a
[5:55] blessed man it's a Believer but you have
[5:58] to position yourself correctly and he
[6:01] chooses to position himself away from
[6:04] the seat of the scornful away from the
[6:06] gossipers can you say Amen out of the
[6:09] counsel of the ungodly out of the way of
[6:11] Sinners he's distance himself as much as
[6:14] he can and positioning himself away from
[6:17] those influences I think we need to do
[6:19] that the second verse says and on his
[6:22] law his Delight is in the law of God his
[6:25] Delight is in the word but on his law
[6:27] it's not just he Delights in it it's not
[6:29] just that I love the word I like to go
[6:30] to church and I love to hear the
[6:32] preaching of the word but he actually
[6:33] when he goes home it's not just that he
[6:36] goes to church and listens to the
[6:37] preaching of the word he actually says I
[6:39] want to meditate on this day and night
[6:43] praise the Lord this is here this is a
[6:46] serious fellow here this is serious it's
[6:48] not just saying yeah I love the
[6:50] preaching and enjoying your preaching
[6:51] brother Paul and I love to come and hear
[6:52] it and all these other no he's taking
[6:54] he's saying I want my thought life to be
[6:57] invaded I want my thought life I want
[7:01] the word not just to be a hearer of the
[7:03] word but a doer and I want the word to
[7:06] consume my thoughts more and more
[7:09] so that's where I got this series on our
[7:12] thought life and it's becoming such a
[7:14] wonderful subject personally for me I
[7:17] will say though that what but you you're
[7:19] corrected all the time the word corrects
[7:21] where we're living and I'll tell you uh
[7:24] this has been a challenge for me to uh
[7:27] put the scanner on my thoughts I'm just
[7:30] going to go ahead and say this I really
[7:32] believe and I here's this this thought
[7:35] came to me on the way to church as I was
[7:38] thinking other thoughts than I should
[7:40] have for church and for the Lord I was
[7:43] they weren't bad thoughts but they were
[7:45] negative thoughts and I caught myself
[7:46] and I only have a five minute drive to
[7:48] work to to work to to church
[7:52] it's pretty bad when you got a five
[7:54] minute drive and you're already thinking
[7:55] negative thoughts
[7:57] but I said Lord I caught myself
[8:01] no no dump it out dump it up five
[8:04] minutes on the way to church and so I
[8:05] caught myself I said this is really real
[8:07] isn't it here's the pastor so Sam is
[8:09] mine ready for the service and he's
[8:11] thinking things he shouldn't think and I
[8:13] said stop it right there so this is
[8:15] really real you know what I thought this
[8:16] is what I thought maybe this came from
[8:17] the lord it's like we human beings it's
[8:20] it's amazing and I'm gonna adventure to
[8:22] say tonight that this is probably the
[8:25] place of most in our life that we
[8:28] exercise our rights more than any other
[8:31] rights that we have
[8:35] good
[8:36] you know when we say something and we
[8:39] get caught for saying something wrong if
[8:42] we have God in our heart we're going to
[8:43] apologize and sometimes people without
[8:45] God in their heart they apologize
[8:46] sometimes but you know we're going to
[8:49] make it right okay because we've been
[8:50] exposed and sometimes if you have the
[8:52] Holy Spirit in your life you feel
[8:53] convicted of something you said and you
[8:55] you didn't you weren't exposed you just
[8:57] went and and corrected it you went and
[8:59] said you know I I said the wrong thing I
[9:02] am sorry I should not have said that
[9:03] that Spilled Out I should have never
[9:05] said that so we ask uh we would say I'm
[9:08] sorry for that but how many people
[9:10] apologize for their thoughts the thought
[9:14] life is this this this undetected
[9:17] unchecked private place
[9:20] and because it is we exercise our rights
[9:23] we can think I may not be able to do
[9:26] what I want but I can think whatever I
[9:29] want and when you start reading the
[9:30] scripture and you start real realizing
[9:33] that the thought life can actually
[9:34] quench the spirit of God then you start
[9:36] saying it's time to grow to even let my
[9:39] thought life be corrected
[9:42] come on now casting down imagination and
[9:46] everything that exalted itself above the
[9:48] knowledge of God bringing every thought
[9:51] into captivity of Christ
[9:53] that's living a deep life you can't hide
[9:56] anything so God
[9:58] he can look back and say one of the two
[10:00] things here is the people that I'm
[10:03] looking at what they're thinking and he
[10:06] probably seen this on the day of
[10:08] Pentecost when the Bible says they were
[10:10] in one mind and one Accord
[10:13] that didn't mean that all their opinions
[10:15] were the same but they had one objective
[10:18] and that's to empty out of themselves
[10:19] and pray for God's promise to be
[10:22] fulfilled and they had that one
[10:24] objective together this is what we're
[10:25] coming to church for this is what we're
[10:27] in the upper room for we shut every
[10:29] other thought out right now we're
[10:31] praying for these 10 days and they had
[10:33] one Focus one mind and one Accord
[10:36] and God looked at that and seen their
[10:40] thought life and their uh desire to be
[10:43] in one mind and one Accord is in line
[10:45] with what they're saying
[10:46] and then the Holy Ghost Fire fell on
[10:49] that place
[10:50] one mind one Accord but when you have a
[10:54] service where there's millions of
[10:55] different thoughts from unbelief to what
[10:59] I'm gonna wear next week how am I going
[11:01] to pay my bill on Monday to millions of
[11:04] thoughts going on and it's not about
[11:06] let's forget all that and praise someone
[11:08] through to the Holy Ghost
[11:10] what if there's a soul here that needs
[11:13] more of God you may not need it you may
[11:16] not you may be saved and filled with the
[11:18] Holy Spirit praise the Lord but why is
[11:20] it that you're so selfish to leave it
[11:21] alone somebody else needs more of God so
[11:24] we focus say God what could you do in
[11:27] this little Wednesday night service
[11:28] tonight I'm going to focus it I don't
[11:30] care about my bills that I owe you know
[11:31] this is one place you can forget about
[11:33] your bills
[11:35] I give you permission
[11:36] because you're not going to solve
[11:38] anything tonight can you say man
[11:40] you'll pick it up tomorrow say God help
[11:42] me you're the provider I just sang it at
[11:44] church Jehovah Jireh but you're not
[11:46] going to deal with it tonight so Focus
[11:49] what can God do for the kingdom of God
[11:51] what Young Heart can come to the Lord
[11:54] what is who's struggling with depression
[11:56] that the spirit of God can sweep through
[11:58] that place and drive that cloud away
[12:00] what can you do if we could all get in
[12:03] one mind and one Accord and stop
[12:06] thinking other things
[12:11] then
[12:13] then that's part of the presence of the
[12:16] Lord it's an evidence that we've been in
[12:18] the presence of the Lord
[12:20] God is watching this
[12:23] and he sees
[12:25] he's trying to see if the heart
[12:28] opens up in Simplicity and faith
[12:31] and will drive out its own thoughts
[12:34] of doubt
[12:37] of overcoming
[12:40] trying to figure it all out in your own
[12:43] thinking he sees somebody and said Lord
[12:45] I I'm tired of trying to figure
[12:47] everything out
[12:51] we're trying to figure out how God's
[12:53] going to do this
[12:55] and he didn't really ask you to figure
[12:56] out how he's going to do it
[12:59] I mean he could show somebody a vision
[13:01] he could give this is a distinct like a
[13:04] prophet I mean I wouldn't knock that if
[13:06] somebody said it praise the Lord he'd
[13:07] tell you exactly what how God's going to
[13:09] do it but God wants us to have simple
[13:11] faith that he's going to do it but I
[13:14] don't have to think through how God's
[13:16] going to do it
[13:17] I don't have to think through wins gonna
[13:20] God's gonna do it
[13:23] are you listening tonight
[13:26] anybody know that there's such a thing
[13:28] as overthinking something
[13:30] but there is certain people
[13:33] that overthink life and overthink things
[13:37] and and besides fearing what's happened
[13:40] they're fearing what hasn't happened yet
[13:43] and they're scared of what hasn't
[13:45] happened or what might happen or what my
[13:48] children might do the direction they may
[13:50] go and and so it hasn't happened yet but
[13:53] there's so much fear that it might
[13:55] happen that they're Bound in those
[13:56] thoughts God does not ask us when we
[14:00] pray something to figure out and think
[14:02] through how he's going to do it but he
[14:05] asked for simple Faith to stand there
[14:07] like a rock and say I believe God is
[14:10] going to do it I believe he's going to
[14:13] do it because he's able to do it I'm not
[14:15] budging On Believing with all of my
[14:18] heart and when God looks at my thoughts
[14:19] and when God looks at my heart I'm not
[14:22] budging and God can see my faith isn't
[14:24] going to budge whatsoever but I don't
[14:26] have to think about how God's going to
[14:28] do it I don't have to think it through
[14:30] when God's going to do it but he wants
[14:32] us to see our thought life saying he's
[14:34] going to do it
[14:38] overthinking and all the while the Bible
[14:41] says let this mind be in you which is
[14:43] also in Christ Jesus all the while the
[14:45] Bible says think on good things all the
[14:48] while the Bible's given us instructions
[14:50] how to guide our thoughts
[14:53] so when you overthink things you've
[14:56] probably taken a lot of your thought
[14:57] life
[14:58] just filled
[15:00] with
[15:02] wasted
[15:04] time
[15:06] can I get an amen
[15:08] so then we say something like I'd like
[15:10] to have a penny for every
[15:14] thought
[15:15] that was wasted thought
[15:19] I'd be a millionaire
[15:22] wasted
[15:23] thoughts
[15:25] had no value to them whatsoever never
[15:28] got you anywhere
[15:30] never
[15:33] brought fruit
[15:36] amen
[15:39] so
[15:41] God Is Watching and he sees of our heart
[15:43] is open to Simplicity and faith
[15:46] and open to driving out our thoughts of
[15:48] Doubt our thoughts of trying to
[15:50] overthink something or how God will do
[15:53] something
[15:54] I doubt too many people
[15:57] see in order to see the secrets of the
[16:00] heart being revealed
[16:02] I don't know I'm just speculating that
[16:04] most of it is to see God perform a
[16:06] miracle but once they got into that
[16:08] presence then you realize people come
[16:11] for many different reasons some people
[16:13] come for good so I said Sunday some come
[16:15] from come for bad reasons
[16:18] some come because you know of this that
[16:21] and just like when they come to church
[16:22] now some people come from a lot come for
[16:24] a lot of different reasons you want to
[16:26] believe people come just because they're
[16:27] hungry from the word and that's it but
[16:29] some people come to criticize some
[16:31] people come to find something wrong some
[16:33] people come because it's part of their
[16:35] scheduled Sunday going to church as part
[16:37] of their schedule they got a certain
[16:38] slot for that and uh and then as I said
[16:41] when I preach over time what I should
[16:43] have and they're done they got to get
[16:44] right out because I've went beyond their
[16:46] schedule
[16:48] and I think that I'll say it again
[16:50] because I think that
[16:53] we shouldn't schedule in God
[16:56] we should be we should be the ones
[16:58] flexible that if he wants to interrupt
[17:01] the entire schedule for the entire week
[17:07] instead we scheduling in
[17:10] from 11 to 1 on Sundays
[17:13] what if God wants to save your children
[17:17] what if God wants you to pray the rest
[17:18] of the night here
[17:23] why don't you quit putting God in a
[17:25] schedule and be submissive to his
[17:26] schedule
[17:27] his plan and his will
[17:30] amen some come as Skeptics always
[17:33] finding fault some have no trust in in
[17:36] Preachers and sometimes that's
[17:38] understandable because of what they've
[17:40] been through but they bring those
[17:42] thoughts with them and so everything's
[17:43] filtered through that thought of a
[17:45] Preacher hurting them some are thinking
[17:47] in the service that this is all good but
[17:50] I'm Unworthy of this I've done too many
[17:52] things I'm I'm not in this category I'm
[17:55] not and that's all the devil's thoughts
[17:57] I want to let you know that's all the
[17:58] devil's thoughts that none of that comes
[18:00] from God whatever thought that says
[18:02] you're Unworthy of the blessings of
[18:03] Calvary because of either what you did
[18:05] or because of you some of your complexes
[18:08] that's that's not a thought from God you
[18:11] are not worthy except Calvary has made
[18:14] you worthy of Every Blessing of Cal Ray
[18:17] so that thought is not even of God I'm
[18:20] worth unworthy all of all this and the
[18:22] healing is not for me because I've done
[18:24] too many things so you see this whole
[18:27] thought life and and thinking I've seen
[18:30] this all before four this is just an
[18:32] emotional workup I don't need it some
[18:34] people think this isn't for me some
[18:36] young people think this is not for me I
[18:38] don't want to be a religious fanatic
[18:40] this is not for me so I'm thinking as
[18:42] soon as I can get out on my own I'm out
[18:44] of here it's the young young people
[18:47] think that it's it's all thoughts your
[18:49] thoughts Satan's thoughts but it's not
[18:52] God's thoughts for you
[18:54] that's right
[18:56] so I'm thinking I'm too good for this I
[18:58] don't need to believe this I'm fine I
[19:01] got everything I need I don't need to
[19:03] accept Christ completely and sell out
[19:05] Lock Stock and Barrel I don't need to do
[19:07] that
[19:08] that's thoughts so you look at this
[19:10] these millions of thoughts going on in
[19:13] the other world
[19:15] no wonder God gets restricted
[19:19] no wonder God gets restricted
[19:22] and what he can do
[19:25] and I'm not trying to preach guilt on us
[19:28] tonight I'm trying to pre preach
[19:31] that our thoughts can Quench and hinder
[19:34] how VAR God can go
[19:36] our thoughts can can stop
[19:40] how God wants to go deeper in our lives
[19:43] our thoughts can stop healing that one
[19:46] God wants to give you
[19:48] your thought can stop you from the
[19:51] healing
[19:53] some thinking I'm too good for this I
[19:55] don't need to believe this I'm fine I
[19:57] got everything I need I don't need to
[20:00] accept Christ completely and sell out
[20:02] Lock Stock and Barrel I don't need to do
[20:04] that
[20:04] as thoughts so you look at this these
[20:08] millions of thoughts going on in the
[20:10] other world
[20:12] no wonder God gets restricted
[20:16] no wonder God gets restricted
[20:19] in what he can do
[20:22] and I'm not trying to preach guilt on us
[20:24] tonight I'm trying to preach
[20:27] that our thoughts can Quench and hinder
[20:30] how VAR God can go
[20:33] our thoughts can can stop
[20:37] how God wants to go deeper in our lives
[20:39] and I just think that we exercise our
[20:42] right to think what we want to think too
[20:45] much
[20:48] we have a right as an American we have a
[20:49] right and we technically we do have a
[20:51] right to think what we all want to think
[20:53] but it's such a private world but we
[20:55] give ourselves permission to think
[20:57] sometimes we give ourselves permission
[20:59] to say whatever we want to say I'll tell
[21:01] you you better say Lord help me to say a
[21:04] word in season and the right thing
[21:06] help me to say the right things and when
[21:09] I say the wrong thing to make it right
[21:10] can you say Amen but don't give yourself
[21:13] permission to say whatever you want I
[21:15] say what I want when I want to say it
[21:16] there's a right thing to say
[21:18] and sometimes there's the right thing to
[21:21] say in the right setting
[21:24] because you might be saying the truth
[21:26] or you might be saying your opinion but
[21:28] you're not watching who you're saying in
[21:30] front of
[21:33] you might be saying something in front
[21:34] of your kids that probably shouldn't be
[21:36] said sometimes
[21:39] so if that's true in our words brothers
[21:42] and sisters
[21:43] then what about our thoughts there's
[21:45] there's a reason that God looks into
[21:47] this area of our thought life and
[21:49] another reasons why God looks into this
[21:52] is that he wants to correct those
[21:54] thoughts he wants to deliver you from
[21:56] those thoughts maybe as I spoke tonight
[21:58] you've been corrected and you're my I
[22:00] need to bring this under subjection to
[22:01] the Holy Spirit God wants to correct
[22:03] those things and all of us and stop uh
[22:06] talking yourself out of just simple
[22:09] faith in God's word stop overthinking
[22:12] things can you say Amen God's God stop
[22:15] overthinking God's already thought all
[22:18] of this through
[22:23] before the foundation of the world
[22:25] you're trying to think things through
[22:26] and you're trying to overthink it and
[22:28] I'm here to tell you tonight I'm here to
[22:30] tell the world God has already got
[22:33] everything thought through
[22:35] is that all you make you say well praise
[22:37] the Lord I don't have to overthink it I
[22:40] just submit my life to the thought of
[22:41] God of walking his will God direct me
[22:43] tell me how to make decisions because
[22:45] guess what you've already thought it all
[22:47] through
[22:49] and how many remember the scripture in
[22:50] Jeremiah I should have read it tonight
[22:51] but you know it so well
[22:53] When God says to Jeremiah hey
[22:56] my thoughts are higher than your
[22:59] thoughts
[23:01] my ways I higher than your ways
[23:06] and I'd rather trust in a god who's got
[23:09] it all thought through already
[23:12] to try to work it out myself
[23:15] did it ever occur to you that nothing
[23:19] has ever occurred to God
[23:22] he's got this
[23:25] and if you let him he will take matters
[23:29] in his own hands
[23:33] I wrote a song shared here
[23:35] all right then I'll have to sing it he's
[23:37] taking matters in his own hand
[23:42] when I'm overwhelmed he
[23:45] understands well my boat May reel and
[23:48] rock until Jesus Takes command and he
[23:51] takes those matters in his own hand he's
[23:56] taken matters in his own hands
[24:01] when I'm overwhelmed he
[24:04] understands well my boat May reel and
[24:07] rock until Jesus Takes command and he
[24:10] takes those matters in his own hand did
[24:15] it ever occur to you that nothing's ever
[24:16] occurred to God
[24:19] did you ever latch on to that thought
[24:21] tonight that says
[24:23] why do we have to overthink stuff
[24:25] because God has already thought this all
[24:28] through sometimes we are quenching what
[24:31] God could do because we're overthinking
[24:33] it
[24:35] we're too nervous about it
[24:36] too nervous about where this can go
[24:40] now it can go a lot of places but for
[24:42] you to be nervous about it we can't get
[24:44] ourselves into just resting
[24:47] that no matter how bad a disease no
[24:49] matter how bad the sickness no matter
[24:51] how bad the condition a person's in no
[24:53] matter how low they've gotten no matter
[24:55] how far that child has went out in the
[24:57] world no matter how messed up and
[24:59] mentally they are no matter how bad a a
[25:01] child is thinking immature thoughts and
[25:04] not thinking like an adult like they
[25:06] should it doesn't matter how bad it is
[25:07] we have to rest in our prayer that God
[25:11] is bigger than all of this has everybody
[25:14] ever thinking thoughts even sometimes
[25:16] when you're being prayed for and I think
[25:18] we need to bring our thoughts and lie
[25:19] and say listen Nothing Else Matters
[25:21] right now God if a body of Christ a
[25:24] member of the body of Christ and a
[25:26] minister like Sunday touches them that's
[25:28] why I said before the service do you
[25:30] believe that your pastor could lay hands
[25:32] on you or a minister of the Gospel or
[25:35] even another member of the body of
[25:36] Christ the worst disease do you believe
[25:38] in simple faith that if they touched you
[25:40] you can be completely healed
[25:44] do you simply believe it
[25:47] it doesn't even say to pray it just says
[25:50] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[25:52] recover
[25:57] doesn't even say to pray
[25:59] we pray
[26:01] but it's just laying on as they referred
[26:03] to one time he says for a Believer he
[26:05] said science shows that light passes
[26:08] from one member of the body of Christ
[26:10] Light passes through their body when
[26:11] they lay hands on them now I don't
[26:13] believe you have to lay hands on I think
[26:14] as the uh the one man in the days of
[26:18] Jesus said just speak the word can you
[26:21] say Amen
[26:22] but then we got the way of laying on
[26:24] hands but it's not it's the faith of it
[26:26] it's not what you say in your prayer
[26:29] power behind it
[26:31] it's the life behind the name
[26:36] if we've got the goods we don't have to
[26:38] be afraid of cancer if we've got the
[26:41] goods we have to be afraid as parents to
[26:44] lay our hands on our kids if we've got
[26:46] the goods we don't have to be afraid
[26:48] when we pray God deliver save my kids
[26:50] from this direction they're going
[26:52] whatever it is we have to have simple
[26:54] faith and when I say it and pray it it
[26:56] goes to the throne of God
[26:58] everything is under the blood I'm asking
[27:01] forgiveness for everything that's there
[27:02] and now I stand with boldness before my
[27:05] Kinsmen Redeemer before my high priest
[27:08] can you say amen and I don't there's no
[27:10] unworthiness to this he makes me worthy
[27:13] to pray a prayer of faith
[27:16] sometimes they say and when I go over
[27:18] there and lay hands on that person I'm
[27:20] not even going to pray I've already
[27:22] prayed I'm going to lay hands on them
[27:23] and that's it I believe they're going to
[27:25] be healed lady
[27:26] howdy I've I've learned a lot in the
[27:29] last
[27:29] 30 years friends of listening to the
[27:31] prayer lines
[27:33] I've learned a lot
[27:35] it's not only Built My Faith but I
[27:37] learned how God deals with his people
[27:38] through the prayer lines
[27:40] because God he's the same yesterday
[27:42] today and forever and the manner he
[27:44] deals with people in manner he deals
[27:46] with their nervousness the way he talks
[27:47] to them the holy spirit's a gentleman he
[27:49] doesn't want to embarrass you children
[27:51] remember that Holy Spirit doesn't want
[27:53] to embarrass you but when there's a call
[27:54] that you need God you need the Holy
[27:56] Ghost and you need a deeper walk it's
[27:58] not to embarrass you it's calling for
[28:00] for Christ for you to come closer to
[28:02] Christ
[28:03] if there's an altar or call come and get
[28:06] more of Christ
