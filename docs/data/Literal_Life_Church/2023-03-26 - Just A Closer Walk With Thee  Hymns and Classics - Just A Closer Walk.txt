On March 26, 2023, Literal Life Church hosted a community outreach event, "Hymns and Classics Sing-Along". We pressed the record button that evening and received such positive response from the community afterward that we decided to make the audio recording available for free to the public. 

Just A Closer Walk With Thee

Verse 1
I am weak but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

Chorus
Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Verse 2
Thro' this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

Verse 3
When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.
