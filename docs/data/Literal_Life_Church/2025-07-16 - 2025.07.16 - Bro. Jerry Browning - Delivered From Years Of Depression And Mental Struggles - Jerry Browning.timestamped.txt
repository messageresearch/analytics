[0:00] Praise the Lord everybody. It's good to
[0:02] gather with you again here. And uh
[0:04] tonight we wanted to sit and chat a
[0:06] little bit and fellowship a little bit
[0:08] with our brother Jerry Browning. He's
[0:09] with us and it's a guest here at our
[0:11] church. And when he called me the other
[0:14] day to come through, uh he shared with
[0:16] me a little bit of uh his testimony,
[0:18] what's been going on in his life here
[0:20] the last um 12, 13 years. And I felt it
[0:24] was important just to sit with him and
[0:25] ask him some questions about it. And uh
[0:27] I believe it will be a real blessing to
[0:29] you tonight uh just to ponder. He shared
[0:31] some of it in our service tonight and we
[0:33] appreciated the wonderful service
[0:35] tonight as well. But uh we welcome you
[0:37] and brother uh Jerry has served uh 26
[0:41] years I think he said as a pastor there
[0:43] in Dixon, Tennessee and served five
[0:45] years in Desert Storm in the military.
[0:48] And so uh he's a warrior in several
[0:51] ways. But uh you're going to find out
[0:53] tonight that I believe he's a warrior
[0:55] against the enemy and what he has
[0:57] overcome and what he has got the victory
[0:58] over. And I'm going to let him share
[1:00] that in in talking about these things. I
[1:03] just like to lay a little foundation in
[1:05] the scripture, brother Jerry. Um you
[1:08] know, you mentioned a couple scriptures
[1:10] tonight. I was going to mention them as
[1:12] well. Scriptures that we know, but
[1:13] they're promises of God. I think the one
[1:16] in the Old Testament is, "I am the Lord
[1:17] God that health all of thy diseases."
[1:20] And I wrote down one today, Mark 1:34,
[1:24] uh, he healed all manner of disease and
[1:26] all sickness of divers diseases. So, I'd
[1:29] like everybody to hold that thought that
[1:31] when it's the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:33] Christ, it doesn't just cover just
[1:36] certain physical things, but uh, he
[1:39] covers all the healing. There's another
[1:40] one in the Old Testament that says, um,
[1:43] I sought the Lord and he delivered me
[1:45] from all of my fears. And that would be
[1:48] specific for tonight because we want to
[1:50] talk about depression. We want to talk
[1:52] about anxiety, mental illness, and a lot
[1:55] of that is rooted in fear. And of
[1:57] course, a lot of it is rooted what Satan
[1:59] tries to bring. And uh so we want to
[2:01] talk about those things. Then when we
[2:03] move, of course, to the New Testament,
[2:05] we see Jesus going forth and healing all
[2:08] manner of disease and all manner of
[2:09] sickness and casting out all manner of
[2:12] devils. And then that was even before
[2:14] the atonement. That was before the
[2:16] atonement. So then he goes to Calvary
[2:18] and pays the price and he pays the price
[2:21] for our sin but also he leaves us an
[2:24] atonement. I just want to lay a
[2:25] foundation here that that atonement is a
[2:28] full atonement is it's not just that he
[2:31] took stripes upon his back for physical
[2:34] healing but for all of our healing. And
[2:37] that's what you said even in the service
[2:38] tonight is that there's nothing that the
[2:40] Lord has not covered. There's nothing
[2:42] that the Lord has not blessed us with to
[2:44] believe for to be healed because the
[2:46] atonement has certainly covered all of
[2:48] it. And so we're thankful to God for an
[2:51] atonement that covers it all. There's no
[2:52] limitations on the atonement that Jesus
[2:55] Christ has provided for us. And uh God
[2:58] has God knew that he had to provide for
[3:01] all manner of diseases, but all the
[3:03] things including 20th century 21st
[3:06] century problems and issues. God knew
[3:10] that ahead of time. and he paid the
[3:12] price and made an atonement for all of
[3:14] that. I say that because when we start
[3:16] to get to the end time, the mental
[3:19] illness and the depression and the and
[3:21] the anxiety and fear seem to be just
[3:25] multiplying isn't even a word for it.
[3:28] It's just it's something bigger. And I
[3:30] was talking to you today at dinner that
[3:33] we know that in Malachi it says the son
[3:35] of man arose with healing in his wings.
[3:38] So when God visits the generation and
[3:40] when he manifests in Jesus Christ and
[3:42] then the then he said the son of man
[3:44] will manifest again at the end time. If
[3:46] he rises again and begins to show
[3:48] himself the son of man ministry then he
[3:50] rises with healing in his wings and that
[3:53] means that the initial uh way that God
[3:56] shows and gets the attention of the
[3:58] people is he shows himself as the
[4:00] supernatural God that he begins to heal
[4:03] all the diseases just like he did in
[4:04] Jesus Christ. So when he come up in the
[4:07] ministry of the son of man, Jesus Christ
[4:09] again in the end time, it come up with
[4:11] healing in his wings. And so in the
[4:14] initial healing campaigns, which we
[4:16] believe brother Brandham was kind of the
[4:18] the spearhead to that, many books say
[4:20] that brother Brandham's ministry was the
[4:22] spearhead to that. And then there was
[4:23] many healing ministries after that. Uh
[4:26] it it struck America. went around the
[4:28] world, a healing campaign, uh many
[4:31] conventions, many tent meetings,
[4:33] thousands upon thousands of people
[4:35] healed. It was just a unique word, a
[4:38] work of God that showed himself alive
[4:41] again in healing. But I was saying to
[4:44] you today that a lot of that seemed to
[4:46] be that we heard about was physical
[4:49] healing. Cancer healed, the dead raised,
[4:53] uh uh all kinds of manner of diseases
[4:55] physically. And we didn't hear a lot
[4:58] about mental things and and depression.
[5:02] Uh I mean, brother Brandon mentioned it
[5:03] a few times in the prayer line and so we
[5:05] know it was there, but I don't believe
[5:07] it is as prevalent as it is today and
[5:10] grown as it is today. And so I wanted to
[5:12] say that that it seems like things God
[5:15] still heals physically, but he wants to
[5:17] heal even deeper uh emotional needs and
[5:20] and physical needs and and uh all all
[5:23] all manner of diseases. is and sometimes
[5:25] we don't look at as mental things or
[5:27] depression as a disease but in God's
[5:30] books it's all the same category it's
[5:32] all what the enemy uses to bring
[5:34] affliction on the human being and when
[5:36] you talk about uh someone struggling in
[5:38] their thoughts and their mind whether
[5:40] from their past or whether from as
[5:42] you're going to talk about tonight some
[5:44] of the different reasons that people can
[5:46] become depressed um whatever it is God
[5:50] covered that and so we see then it's
[5:53] been because of the the mental condition
[5:56] of the of the world. We see that we
[6:00] really are depending more and more on
[6:03] the Lord. We have doctors, we have
[6:06] medicine, but ultimately uh as we'll
[6:09] find in our brother's testimony tonight,
[6:12] we have to depend on the Lord. And when
[6:14] we do, we can have faith that in the
[6:16] atonement he's provided to bring healing
[6:18] as you as we're going to find in his
[6:20] victorious testimony tonight. I just
[6:23] like to say this last point too is that
[6:26] um I feel like when it moved to a lot
[6:29] more of that, it's less talked about. It
[6:31] seems like the the depression, the
[6:33] oppression, and I've haven't even had
[6:35] some preachers that they just kind of
[6:37] ignore that that's happening. Tonight we
[6:40] see from your testimony and being honest
[6:42] with us that uh this can happen to
[6:45] believers too with the Holy Spirit in
[6:48] their lives with a love for God with the
[6:51] Holy Ghost. Uh Satan can strike them
[6:54] too. Uh you said it in the service, I've
[6:56] said it before is that when you're born
[6:58] again, it's your soul that's born again.
[7:00] You got the other twothirds of you
[7:01] that's not born again. And it's the only
[7:03] parts that Satan's left with to to try
[7:05] to destroy, to try to defeat you cuz he
[7:08] can't get to the soul when once you're
[7:09] sealed in by the Holy Ghost. So Satan
[7:12] wres havoc uh on the mind. Brother
[7:14] Brandham preached the greatest battle
[7:15] over fault is the mind and in the mind.
[7:18] And so we see then that I think some
[7:21] people ignore this part. I I would just
[7:23] say it this way. Some people will even
[7:24] go see a doctor or come for prayer for
[7:27] physical healing, but they tend to hide
[7:30] prayer for and maybe even seeing someone
[7:32] to get help for the emotional or the
[7:35] depression or the oppression. So, we
[7:37] talked about that today and so maybe you
[7:39] have, you know, time to get into a
[7:41] little bit of that, but it's a privilege
[7:43] to be here tonight. And I just wanted to
[7:44] read one scripture that's be related
[7:47] that be has become re real to me in
[7:49] these things. As a matter of fact, I've
[7:51] ministered a little bit along these
[7:52] lines the last couple years. Philippians
[7:55] 4 and verse um 6 says, "Be careful for
[8:00] nothing." It says, "Don't be anxious
[8:02] about anything."
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; And you're nodding because this
[8:05] scripture's probably been very real to
[8:08] you. Don't be anxious about anything,
[8:11] but in everything by prayer and
[8:13] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[8:16] requests be made known to God. And
[8:18] here's the promise that goes with it.
[8:20] And the peace of God which passeth all
[8:23] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[8:26] your minds through Jesus Christ. In
[8:28] other words, when he says hearts and
[8:31] minds, your minds means your thought
[8:33] life and your hearts means your
[8:35] emotional life. God covered it because
[8:37] he knows the soul's sealed in. But you
[8:40] see then if we'll go to God, he'll give
[8:42] us a piece for our hearts, for our
[8:44] thought life, and for our emotions as
[8:47] well. And he promised he said I'll
[8:49] protect your hearts and your minds which
[8:51] as I said the other twothirds of you is
[8:53] not born again. So he gives us an extra
[8:56] promise here that he would provide
[8:59] strength and peace and deliverance for
[9:02] not just our souls but our hearts and
[9:05] minds as well. So that's something
[9:07] that's really became more and more real
[9:09] to me as I've ministered it. You know,
[9:11] there's one thing diminished, and I've
[9:13] been, of course, every Christian's been
[9:14] through some things. But when you talk
[9:16] to a brother like you who has uh had 12
[9:20] years of going through something like
[9:22] this, that's quite a long time. And I'm
[9:24] sure you had to cling to promises like
[9:26] this. So, you know, I I I just want I I
[9:29] I just want you to share your heart and
[9:32] share whatever the Lord gives you. You
[9:33] had quite a journey here that you've
[9:35] gone with the Lord. Never giving up,
[9:38] although the enemy is trying to tell you
[9:40] different things. Never giving up from
[9:42] any of that, but carrying on with the
[9:43] Lord until finally seeing it through to
[9:46] a victory over this depression and and
[9:48] all the things that you went through. So
[9:51] maybe just describe from the beginning
[9:53] what started happening when you come
[9:54] into this. What in the beginning kind of
[9:56] what happened? Well, at the beginning
[9:58] when I when it uh first started coming
[10:01] on me, I uh it it's you know I I would I
[10:06] would just had like a cloud of
[10:08] depression on me. Uh and it wasn't
[10:10] because of anything was going on in my
[10:12] life. I actually had some good things
[10:13] going on in my life, you know. Uh I had
[10:16] children getting married. I had
[10:17] grandchildren being born, you know, and
[10:19] and and things. And uh and so there
[10:22] there there was actually a lot of
[10:23] happiness going on around me.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Wow. Uh but when this started I I began
[10:28] to feel like uh it really started
[10:30] manifesting where I just couldn't get
[10:32] out of bed in the morning. Uh I didn't
[10:34] feel like facing a day and and I didn't
[10:36] the anxiety and the depression and how
[10:39] it was just waiting on me. I thought,
[10:41] well, if I just stay asleep, I don't got
[10:43] to deal with it.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people I've talked to,
[10:46] that's what they do. They try to sleep
[10:48] it off, sleep through it, you know,
[10:50] because you're trying to escape from
[10:52] &gt;&gt; what you feel this is my reality.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; So, you're trying to escape from this
[10:57] reality,
[10:58] &gt;&gt; you know, and if you can get your mind
[11:01] turned off and go to sleep, you don't
[11:02] got to deal with it,
[11:04] &gt;&gt; you know.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; And but you can't live life that way.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And uh so you know I would
[11:10] uh there was days when everybody else
[11:12] would leave and I'd be home alone and uh
[11:15] I would never even get out of bed
[11:18] &gt;&gt; and uh you know my wife would maybe come
[11:20] home later and and I'd say no but never
[11:23] got up. I never showered. I never done
[11:25] nothing,
[11:26] &gt;&gt; you know. And uh it was just trying when
[11:29] it gets on your sweat, you just try to
[11:31] escape.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Uh but then uh it just kept progressing,
[11:36] you know.
[11:37] uh to where uh I think the anxiety
[11:40] attacks started getting worse and uh
[11:44] it's it's you you feel like this
[11:46] something bad's going to happen
[11:48] &gt;&gt; and uh and it's not because of anything
[11:51] that has happened or anything that maybe
[11:54] you've witnessed although you know
[11:55] outside things that do happen or outside
[11:58] stressors they actually can add to it
[12:01] you know
[12:02] &gt;&gt; and with like myself when I started
[12:04] going through this
[12:05] &gt;&gt; then uh I uh actually I was the
[12:08] individual who uh a brother within our
[12:12] church. He committed suicide and I was
[12:14] the one who actually just discovered his
[12:16] body.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. and uh and that and so I on top of
[12:20] this I started suffering from uh
[12:23] post-traumatic stress syndrome
[12:25] &gt;&gt; from from that from seeing that you know
[12:28] &gt;&gt; and uh like I said you know I was uh I
[12:31] was in war and that but this was
[12:33] different because this all seemed out of
[12:35] place
[12:36] &gt;&gt; and uh so you know and I've never ever
[12:39] described to anybody the scene of what I
[12:41] saw and I never will
[12:44] &gt;&gt; uh but it was so horrific that I
[12:47] couldn't couldn't get it out of my mind.
[12:49] And uh so
[12:50] &gt;&gt; and that's what you were saying today is
[12:52] that before that though, you know,
[12:54] everything was going happy, your life
[12:55] was going good. And and I want to just
[12:57] hone down on that point is that you're
[12:59] telling me today is that is that this
[13:02] can strike somebody and you can start
[13:04] feeling depressed and feeling this way
[13:06] and everything seems to be going good in
[13:08] your life.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it well
[13:10] &gt;&gt; and that's the amazing thing. But then
[13:12] when you see somebody after they
[13:14] committed suicide in your church,
[13:15] brother in your church,
[13:17] &gt;&gt; uh then it seemed to take you over the
[13:19] top.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was like the it was like it
[13:22] just I like I was on the on the edge of
[13:24] a cliff and this pushed me off.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; You know, and that but uh you know I I I
[13:31] struggled with it keeping to myself a
[13:33] while I was struggling with. I wouldn't
[13:35] even talk to my wife about it, you know.
[13:37] I wouldn't talk to anybody about it. And
[13:38] then finally, um, I I did told my wife,
[13:41] I got to talk to you about what I'm
[13:43] what's going on. And my oldest daughter,
[13:45] she's a nurse. And so I I asked her to
[13:49] come and, uh, over to the house. And so
[13:52] I sat down with my daughter and my wife
[13:54] and I said, "Look, I I I'm" and I
[13:57] started to describe to them what I was
[13:58] suffering from. And this started in
[14:01] 2011. So then
[14:04] uh the brother and I the brother that
[14:06] committed suicide, it was actually on
[14:07] his wedding day that he did this. Okay.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Wow. So, uh, then a year later, my
[14:13] youngest son was getting married and,
[14:16] uh, I was, um, at the house, uh, trying
[14:20] to, uh, get ready to go over to have
[14:23] this wedding and this just fear and
[14:26] anxiety just came on me and everything
[14:29] what that experienced from that day all
[14:31] come flooding back.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And uh and I was under so much
[14:35] fear and you know of course the devil's
[14:37] telling me your son's going to kill
[14:38] himself and this is going to happen and
[14:40] that's going to happen you know and it
[14:41] was just it was just such an attack
[14:44] &gt;&gt; and uh and that but so anyway after
[14:47] talking to my wife and my daughter who's
[14:49] a nurse my daughter said you got to go
[14:51] tell your doctor you know uh I I told
[14:54] her I said you know um it and I wasn't
[14:57] struggling with uh you know any past
[15:00] sins or mistakes or whatever I had done.
[15:04] It wasn't that
[15:05] &gt;&gt; you know but it would just I it was such
[15:08] a depression and it wasn't that I was
[15:11] depressed over anything that was had
[15:13] happened.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; All right. uh like I said this all
[15:17] started before that even the suicide had
[15:20] took place.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; And uh so uh you know and so then then
[15:26] the anxiety which is a complete
[15:28] different thing cuz that can actually
[15:30] affect you and you can actually start
[15:31] feeling physical things from the
[15:33] anxiety. Uh it can cause you to feel
[15:35] like you can't breathe. uh you can
[15:37] actually feel things which I did at
[15:40] times where it's like uh like somebody
[15:42] had throwed like a 50 pound weight on my
[15:45] chest and was crushing me
[15:47] &gt;&gt; you know and uh and then you just you
[15:50] just feel like it you know and then with
[15:52] all of this you know so I went to the
[15:54] doctor let me say this I went to the
[15:56] doctor and uh after dealing with my
[15:59] primary physician for a while and then
[16:01] some other doctors and that you know and
[16:04] what they told me was they said as I
[16:06] told them I I got great things going on
[16:08] in my life. I don't know why I'm
[16:09] depressed, you know,
[16:11] &gt;&gt; and uh you know, and they said, "Well,
[16:14] it's" and so they began to explain it to
[16:16] me and and the way the best way I can
[16:18] relate to it to to people who don't know
[16:20] anything about mental illnesses and
[16:22] things, uh is that, you know, your your
[16:26] mind, your brain cells, there's certain
[16:29] chemicals that have to be produced in
[16:30] your body in order for your brain cells
[16:33] to to work properly, you know, and uh
[16:36] and and usually what I tell people. I
[16:38] said, you know, if you're familiar with
[16:39] like sugar diabetes, your pancreas has
[16:42] to produce uh insulin insulin, right? to
[16:45] to to regulate the amount of sugar
[16:48] that's in your blood, you know, and you
[16:50] got to have sugar in your blood,
[16:51] otherwise your brain can't function,
[16:53] &gt;&gt; you know, but if your pancreas is not
[16:55] producing the right amount of insulin,
[16:56] then you end up with too much sugar in
[16:58] your blood and people can actually uh
[17:00] can actually go into and have a stroke
[17:02] over it, you know, and uh and and but
[17:07] and then our bodies the other thing
[17:09] sometimes our bodies become what they
[17:11] call as insulin uh resistant, right? So
[17:14] there our body what it all comes down to
[17:16] is there's things in our body it's not
[17:18] functioning right.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; And so and you know some people think uh
[17:23] when they hear somebody's got uh some
[17:25] kind of physical illness they always
[17:27] want to say well it's your weight you
[17:29] know.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Well you know I know skinny people that
[17:32] have sugar diabetes. That has nothing to
[17:35] you know it's yeah it can help if you'll
[17:37] lose weight but uh but that's not really
[17:40] what the cause of it is. It's just
[17:42] that's just making you more insulin
[17:44] resistant.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. I like to hear that story
[17:46] too then. But sometimes we justify say
[17:48] we don't have to exercise now because
[17:50] skinny people get it too. But we still
[17:52] need
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Well, no. I Well, I'll tell you this. I
[17:54] I did start walking, exercising, doing
[17:57] things, you know, watching my diet
[17:59] because uh you know, these these mental
[18:02] things what it is uh your body you're
[18:04] it's supposed to produce certain
[18:06] chemicals. Yeah. And uh I I won't try to
[18:09] name all the scientific terms in that
[18:11] that but uh but there's things like
[18:13] serotonin and different things that has
[18:15] to be produced and it makes your brain
[18:16] cells work right and if these things
[18:19] aren't being produced that's why people
[18:22] can be depressed
[18:24] &gt;&gt; and it's not they're not pressed about
[18:26] anything.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Okay? You know, so somebody, you know,
[18:29] the greatest uh hindrance to people that
[18:32] maybe uh be afflicted with this is the
[18:35] ignorance of other people,
[18:37] &gt;&gt; you know, because they're ignorant of
[18:40] what it actually is and they'll tell
[18:42] you, "Well, just don't think that way."
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; And and it's not about what you're
[18:47] thinking.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; You know,
[18:49] &gt;&gt; uh, you know, and and when
[18:53] but it is just like any other sickness.
[18:56] It is of the devil.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; It's the devil afflicting you with that
[18:59] sickness, you know. Yeah.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; And I think I think about in the
[19:03] scripture, you know, you were mentioning
[19:04] that there wasn't a whole lot said maybe
[19:06] about mental illness, but I think about
[19:08] the man who we don't even know his name.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Uh, everybody knows him by legion. And
[19:13] that wasn't his name.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Mhm. That was what the demons that had
[19:17] got on him called themselves,
[19:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Because they said, "We're many,
[19:22] &gt;&gt; right?"
[19:22] &gt;&gt; But the the real thing to draw from that
[19:24] that when when God delivered when Jesus
[19:27] delivered that man and he was healed
[19:30] that the people from the town came and
[19:32] the Bible says they saw him in his right
[19:34] mind,
[19:35] &gt;&gt; you know,
[19:36] &gt;&gt; and uh and and they didn't know what was
[19:38] going on with him. you know, he he
[19:40] seemed to have this super strength,
[19:43] &gt;&gt; you know, when the demons were on him
[19:44] and things, but he was actually
[19:46] suffering from mental illness,
[19:48] &gt;&gt; you know,
[19:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[19:49] &gt;&gt; And and the the scripture testifies that
[19:52] because it says after Jesus cast out
[19:54] those devils, he was there in his right
[19:56] mind.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; So before that, he was really suffering.
[19:59] Yes. You know, he wasn't living up in
[20:01] the tombs and and all this because he
[20:03] didn't want to be with his family. Yeah.
[20:04] you know, uh, brother Brandham actually
[20:06] in some of the messages, he really goes
[20:08] through and describes this man,
[20:10] &gt;&gt; you know, yeah, how, you know, he had a
[20:12] family and and things and he he he he
[20:14] didn't he wanted to be with his family.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; He couldn't function anymore like a
[20:17] normal
[20:19] &gt;&gt; father. So you know it it it's the the
[20:21] enemy just like that he uh comes against
[20:24] us with with uh physical illnesses you
[20:28] know of the body high blood pressure
[20:30] sugar diabetes uh heart disease or
[20:32] cancer or or any of these things you
[20:35] know it's the same thing he does with
[20:36] the mental and and so like I said the
[20:39] hindrance to people I believe uh is that
[20:43] they be is they become ashamed
[20:45] &gt;&gt; and sometimes they're ashamed and they
[20:47] don't want to talk about it because they
[20:50] they'll have even uh members of the
[20:52] ministry that don't understand it and
[20:55] they just want to tell people well you
[20:57] know what it is you just don't have the
[20:59] Holy Ghost you know and the thing about
[21:01] it is brother Brandham actually says a
[21:02] place in the message he says that a
[21:05] demon can come and actually afflict a
[21:08] person in their mind and he says and
[21:10] actually torment them and them actually
[21:13] go completely insane he says but that
[21:15] has nothing to do with their soul and
[21:17] that's what you were saying earlier, you
[21:19] know, that that's that those two outer
[21:21] realms. He can't touch that third realm,
[21:24] that soul. He can't touch that. And
[21:26] that's what brother Brandon was saying
[21:27] there. You know, he can inflict this out
[21:29] of here, even cause a man to mentally go
[21:31] insane.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that man doesn't
[21:34] have the Holy Ghost. It doesn't mean it
[21:36] doesn't touch his soul.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, so when you went to the
[21:39] doctor, um, breaking off of that point,
[21:42] when you went there, you did receive
[21:45] some knowledge a little bit about what
[21:46] was going on because the devil can beat
[21:49] you up like, oh my god, you first of
[21:50] all, you don't know what's going on if
[21:52] you've never had it. You don't know
[21:53] what's taking place. So, you go to the
[21:54] doctor and you felt a bit relieved to re
[21:57] realize sometimes this is not from the
[21:59] past. Sometimes it's not you don't have
[22:01] any you're not you're not having
[22:03] pressures in life. Of course, you were a
[22:05] pastor. He had some pressures but it w
[22:07] it wasn't really going bad but you
[22:09] learned something from them to realize
[22:10] sometimes chemically in your body
[22:12] something can be being messed with and
[22:14] not you know not working right. So you
[22:17] getting a knowledge of that probably
[22:19] helped a little bit because you said
[22:21] people sometimes it's ignorance
[22:23] sometimes they don't know and uh you
[22:25] know I think the devil really beats on
[22:27] that too. Sometimes when we become aware
[22:29] of what's going on, then we know how to
[22:31] bring it before God, you know, and just
[22:33] say this is what that the doctor says it
[22:35] is and you know, I might be able to help
[22:38] it a little bit and diet or whatever,
[22:40] but at the same time, it's an enemy.
[22:42] It's the devil. And uh you know, I think
[22:45] you get knowledge with that. But go a
[22:47] little further now just in that process
[22:49] of uh you know, just not you're still
[22:52] pastoring. So like the man in the Bible,
[22:55] he couldn't function with a regular
[22:57] family life. He actually pulled away
[22:58] from all that. You started pulling away
[23:01] from even that not being able to I think
[23:03] you said in the service tonight that
[23:05] you're kind of going through the emotion
[23:07] emotions when you were pastoring some
[23:09] because
[23:10] &gt;&gt; I it actually it it uh it started to get
[23:14] to a place to where you know and you
[23:16] know this brother Paul you for you to
[23:18] get a message to preach God's got to
[23:20] give you inspiration. That's right. You
[23:22] know, he's got to inspire you and God
[23:23] will use different things to inspire
[23:25] you.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; But but and so you have to wait for the
[23:28] inspiration before you can sit down and
[23:30] actually it doesn't matter how much you
[23:31] know, how much you've listened to,
[23:33] &gt;&gt; you know, as a believer, you know, God's
[23:36] got to put that spark of inspiration in
[23:38] there and then it all starts coming
[23:39] together where you can actually come and
[23:41] minister a message from it. Yeah.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; You know, and uh what had happened to me
[23:45] was that wasn't happening any longer. M
[23:48] &gt;&gt; I couldn't I couldn't get no
[23:50] inspiration. My my mind uh even with
[23:54] like dealing with my my personal
[23:55] finances or even the church's finances
[23:58] at the time. I I I was sitting there one
[24:00] day and I just started weeping and I
[24:02] told my wife, I said, "I can't even do
[24:04] math.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; It was too overwhelming.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; It's just overwhelming me, you know."
[24:07] Wow.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; So, she started helping me out, you
[24:09] know. Yeah.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; And I told her, I says, "This is just I
[24:12] can't take it, you know." And uh so it
[24:15] got to a point to where uh you know and
[24:18] then the anxiety and nerves I just had
[24:20] see I had a plethora of things going on
[24:24] &gt;&gt; and uh so then it you know getting
[24:27] around people made me nervous and then
[24:29] and then you start feeling like cuz it's
[24:31] the devil that starts battling you then
[24:32] with thoughts and you start feeling like
[24:35] a lesser person. you start feeling like
[24:37] something's wrong with you, you know,
[24:38] and so a lot of times you start drawing
[24:40] back from people and sometimes you draw
[24:43] back because you and you feel so alone
[24:45] because you feel like nobody is getting
[24:47] what's happening to me, you know, and
[24:49] sometimes the more they try to,
[24:52] &gt;&gt; you know, you know, there's like a
[24:53] stigma, I believe, in the message that
[24:56] people got this stigma. They they
[24:57] they're so against what they call
[24:59] psychology. And I would never tell
[25:01] somebody that's your answer, right? You
[25:03] know, uh but but the thing is, you know,
[25:06] uh even with all that, then people
[25:09] actually sit down, even preachers that
[25:12] that believe what it all is is this or
[25:14] that, whatever, they don't even realize
[25:16] sometimes they're trying to
[25:17] psychologically talk you out of this,
[25:20] &gt;&gt; you know, and and it doesn't work. You
[25:23] know, you can't use psychology on a
[25:25] devil.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. That's right. And uh
[25:28] and and and the thing about it is this
[25:31] affliction, it doesn't make sense. It it
[25:33] defies reasoning,
[25:35] &gt;&gt; you know,
[25:36] &gt;&gt; my goodness.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; And uh so I know with even my wife and
[25:40] and that, you know, there was times she
[25:42] would just feel so helpless and
[25:44] frustrated and she'd say, "What can I do
[25:47] to help you?"
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; You know, and that and and I would just
[25:50] tell her, "I don't know. Just hold my
[25:52] hand." You know,
[25:53] &gt;&gt; wow. And um uh so the more she actually
[25:57] learned about it uh and that then she
[26:01] was actually able and they they told us
[26:03] there's there's little uh uh triggers
[26:06] and different things that will show when
[26:08] somebody's like who's going to have an
[26:09] anxiety attack
[26:10] &gt;&gt; that that my wife began to notice there
[26:13] were certain little actions I would do.
[26:16] Mhm.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Uh she said I would start to like just
[26:19] rub my temple like this, you know, and I
[26:22] was not even aware I was doing it and
[26:24] she could tell an attack was getting
[26:25] ready to go. going into that mode of an
[26:27] attack. And uh so
[26:28] &gt;&gt; wow
[26:29] &gt;&gt; um you know so then the more she began
[26:32] to understand then she could actually be
[26:33] there with me you know
[26:35] &gt;&gt; and have more understanding
[26:37] &gt;&gt; but she she had that's a thing too is
[26:39] that I remember scripture says my my
[26:41] people God said my people are destroyed
[26:43] for lack of knowledge and and I don't
[26:46] mean worldly knowledge but lack of
[26:48] revelation number one but also when
[26:50] someone chooses to be ignorant they
[26:51] don't want to find out you often I often
[26:54] tell people is that if we find out what
[26:56] it is we can name the devil. We can name
[26:58] what he's trying to do. But if we just
[27:00] want to remain ignorant and sometimes we
[27:02] learn, as your wife learned, what
[27:03] triggers it, what's going on, I don't
[27:05] think there's anything wrong with that.
[27:07] Even though the answer is not
[27:09] psychology, uh we get enough to know,
[27:11] okay, I know what's going on now. I can
[27:13] bring it before the Lord. And I'm
[27:14] bringing up that point again is that
[27:16] seems like what's it feel like to have a
[27:17] panic attack? What's it feel like? um
[27:20] you uh it's well it works different for
[27:23] for different individuals I guess the
[27:26] way it might uh come on them but uh you
[27:30] um all of a sudden there's just like
[27:31] this whole feeling of doom that sets
[27:34] down on you know
[27:35] &gt;&gt; and and and you feel like and it does it
[27:38] defies reasoning you feel like something
[27:40] bad is just getting ready to happen to
[27:42] you
[27:43] &gt;&gt; and uh and that and then it it then
[27:46] there'll be actually physical effects
[27:48] that will happen to you. You know, it
[27:50] affects your breathing, it affects your
[27:52] heart rate, affects your blood pressure,
[27:54] &gt;&gt; uh affects all these things. And so when
[27:56] it starts affecting all them, you start
[27:58] physically feeling it then you know when
[28:01] your blood pressure right raises you
[28:02] know because if somebody has high blood
[28:04] pressure uh then you know they can start
[28:06] getting this pounding in the back of
[28:08] their head and things you know if their
[28:09] blood pressure raises too high you know
[28:12] uh if your if your sugar raises too high
[28:14] or if your sugar bottoms out it cause
[28:17] you cause you a fat it'll cause people
[28:19] to sweat. it'll cause them to uh you
[28:22] know uh um get real shaky or something
[28:25] or whatever you know and and they'll
[28:26] eventually they can pass out and and
[28:28] anxiety it kind of works that way you
[28:31] know and it starts affecting these other
[28:33] things in your your body blood pressure
[28:35] and and and different things and that
[28:37] and then your heart will race and it'll
[28:39] pound and then your chest will hurt and
[28:40] then and then sometimes there's and and
[28:42] what I believe is I believe it has to be
[28:44] demons because you'll feel actually like
[28:48] uh uh like I I always felt like a a
[28:51] heavy weight sitting on top of me like
[28:53] like as if you had somebody sitting on
[28:55] your chest. It'd be hard to breathe.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't expand your lungs.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; My my.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; And yet you look and you say there's
[29:01] nothing there.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; But it's still real what you're feeling.
[29:05] And it's still uh you know causing you
[29:08] to to have trouble breathing and things,
[29:11] you know.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I've heard some people describe a
[29:13] panic attack as kind of also feeling
[29:14] just crowded in and something's coming
[29:16] in you in on you like uh David described
[29:19] in Psalm 27 he said like an enemy
[29:21] encamped around you. I don't know if you
[29:23] ever felt it that way but you feel like
[29:25] something's rushing on you.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; When you start to have attack like that
[29:28] and you're around a lot of people
[29:31] &gt;&gt; that really has a bad effect on you. You
[29:33] want to just get away from everybody.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Wow. Uh when when I would start to
[29:38] experience this, I would actually go
[29:40] into my bedroom, shut my door away from
[29:42] everybody.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; My
[29:43] &gt;&gt; and and just set to myself.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; And that's a hard thing to do as a
[29:46] pastor.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be around people,
[29:49] &gt;&gt; you know. And I uh I had brother Phil
[29:51] Bontreger was there with me. And so uh I
[29:54] know there was at least a month or maybe
[29:56] a little longer that he was doing all
[29:59] the preaching. I couldn't even preach,
[30:01] &gt;&gt; you know, and I I got so bad I couldn't
[30:04] even counsel with people. They people
[30:06] needed counseling. They had problems,
[30:08] something they were dealing with, but I
[30:09] was so tore up. I was no good, no use,
[30:13] you know. And of course, Satan then
[30:16] &gt;&gt; attacked me with, you know, with my
[30:18] thoughts through that.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; You know, saying, you know, show me all
[30:22] my uh deficiencies, you know,
[30:25] &gt;&gt; you're failing and that. And so, um,
[30:28] &gt;&gt; my
[30:28] &gt;&gt; I actually, uh, after some time, I
[30:32] thought I I've got to, uh, power through
[30:35] this, you know, like you said, I I
[30:37] served in the military. And of course,
[30:39] the military, they they teach you a lot
[30:41] of mind. They play a lot of mind games
[30:43] and they teach you mind control and
[30:44] things like that. And and and and they
[30:47] have a thing what they call it's mind
[30:48] over matter. You know, you know, no
[30:51] matter what's going on, you just set it
[30:53] in your mind and you're going to be
[30:54] okay. But this what I was going through,
[30:56] it defied all of that. Wow. You know,
[30:59] &gt;&gt; but I did actually uh eventually fall
[31:01] back on some of my my training from the
[31:04] army and said, I'm going to power
[31:06] through this
[31:07] &gt;&gt; to preach
[31:08] &gt;&gt; to preach.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, but my my issue was like I
[31:12] told you, I couldn't get any
[31:14] inspiration.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And and I I it was like I and I was on
[31:18] some medication. Okay.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We get I wanted to get into that
[31:22] next. And so that actually I I I would
[31:25] tell my wife, I don't feel anointed.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; You know,
[31:28] &gt;&gt; and and I felt like I couldn't feel
[31:30] anything emotionally or anything, you
[31:32] know, no feeling or nothing. I was numb.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, what I would do is then what
[31:38] I did was I just, you know, I'd been I
[31:41] had been preaching for years
[31:43] &gt;&gt; and and studying and had a lot of notes
[31:45] and different things and that. So what I
[31:47] did was uh I just, you know, Satan had
[31:51] me a fearing that I was just inadequate
[31:53] and I was going to lose everything, you
[31:55] know,
[31:56] &gt;&gt; and so what I did was I just went back
[31:58] and and I'm actually embarrassed to tell
[32:00] you, but I went back and I grabbed old
[32:03] notes that I had
[32:04] &gt;&gt; and I would just carry those old notes
[32:06] up to the pullpit. And and sometimes,
[32:09] brother Paul, uh because you know, with
[32:12] with when you get anointed in preaching,
[32:14] you know, you'll have maybe an outline
[32:16] or notes or whatever, but the spirit
[32:17] begins to come and you begin to say
[32:19] things that ain't down there, right? You
[32:21] know, and you couldn't do that and the
[32:22] Holy Spirit bringing things back to your
[32:24] memories. That wouldn't that wasn't
[32:25] happening my you know, so at times it
[32:27] became it was I felt like all I was
[32:29] doing was just reading off those pages.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Well, you showed you're
[32:33] delivered tonight because the way you
[32:34] preached at the church tonight shows it
[32:36] was inspiration for sure as anointed.
[32:39] Let's go. Let's talk a little bit about
[32:41] the medicine thing because you know
[32:42] that's always kind of taboo as well. Uh
[32:45] and I don't want to be critical but
[32:46] sometimes people will go to the doctor,
[32:49] visit the doctor, they'll go for
[32:50] medicines for that uh and physical
[32:52] things, but it's taboo to talk about
[32:54] medicines for something going on in a
[32:56] chemical imbalance or depression and
[32:58] things like that. And my belief on it is
[33:02] that uh anything that helps humanity,
[33:05] anything that's going to help them
[33:07] temporarily.
[33:08] That's, you know, that's a good thing. I
[33:11] always try to counsel people, but don't
[33:12] ever settle that you'll be on that for
[33:14] life. Um I don't think that's of God. I
[33:17] think that we should be believing and
[33:19] get off of that. But you uh you went out
[33:21] you went ahead and take took some
[33:22] medicines for this.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you know, Brother Paul, I uh
[33:26] I know some people believe if you take
[33:28] medicine for anything, it's because you
[33:30] don't have faith.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; But but I don't believe that. I don't
[33:32] believe Brother Ben taught that.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you saying that.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; You know, y
[33:35] &gt;&gt; and uh but and I would say this from my
[33:39] own experience, I would do anything I
[33:41] could to help somebody to get healed to
[33:43] not have to be on that medicine.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. because there's so many
[33:48] horrible side effects,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; you know, and uh when somebody is
[33:53] suffering from from a chemical imbalance
[33:55] causing depression, anxiety, you know,
[33:58] one of the things that they deal with
[34:00] you is they know you're going to have
[34:01] suicidal thoughts. Yeah.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; And the reason for that is you want to
[34:05] escape from it so bad,
[34:07] &gt;&gt; you know. Yeah. And and some people uh
[34:10] don't feel like there's any escape or
[34:12] way out and and you know they and then
[34:16] they end up they do end up committing
[34:17] suicide which that within itself we know
[34:20] that's a demon too.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. You know that's right. Y
[34:22] &gt;&gt; and and so u some of the side effects of
[34:26] these medications that are supposed to
[34:28] help you with this. One of the worst
[34:30] side effects is it causes suicidal
[34:32] thoughts. So, but there there's a lot of
[34:34] other side effects to them, you know,
[34:36] &gt;&gt; and uh I won't go into all the different
[34:39] side effects, but it affects you in a
[34:40] lot of physical ways.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And that's why you didn't like being on
[34:43] it
[34:43] &gt;&gt; and I I didn't like
[34:44] &gt;&gt; How many How many years did you have to
[34:45] take it? How many years you taking?
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I was taking it probably
[34:49] about cuz it was about a year I suffered
[34:52] before I went to the doctor.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. And so for probably about 11 years
[34:56] uh but and they just as I just kept
[35:00] getting worse they they kept increasing
[35:02] the medications
[35:03] &gt;&gt; and then finally my uh primary care
[35:06] physician she told me she said you've
[35:08] surpassed my knowledge.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; She says I don't have any more knowledge
[35:12] in this particular area. She's my area
[35:14] expertise is the physical illnesses.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Right. And so she she told me, which you
[35:19] know is a real no no for many uh message
[35:22] believers, says, "You're going to have
[35:24] to go to a psychiatrist." Yeah.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; So that they can actually prescribe you
[35:28] the right medications, you know.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; And so uh and and so a psychiatrist,
[35:33] it's not you sitting down and having a
[35:35] talking session with somebody. Yeah.
[35:37] They're they're actually they do talk to
[35:39] you to try to find out what's going on.
[35:41] uh like my my grandson Michael that's
[35:44] here with me. He he went to me with a
[35:46] couple of those appointments as he got
[35:47] older and he was says he told me he said
[35:50] that's a strange doctor said they never
[35:52] check your heart rate. They never do
[35:54] anything. All they do is sit there and
[35:55] talk to you, you know, but they have to
[35:57] ask you questions and you describe
[35:59] things and then they and then they uh
[36:01] they they want ask you questions with
[36:03] the medicines they've give you. Is it
[36:06] they want to know the effects? Mhm.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; And so I actually ended up at a point
[36:10] where they had actually they they I
[36:12] don't even remember how many different
[36:14] ones that I was on. I think maybe four
[36:16] or five different medications.
[36:19] And they had actually gave me the max
[36:21] dosage of every one of them, you know,
[36:24] and uh and and and I'd reached a point
[36:27] where no longer it wasn't even really
[36:29] helping me any longer.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; You know,
[36:31] &gt;&gt; it's just the time for God to step in
[36:32] and all that. But the medications, they
[36:35] kind of, you know, they they they kind
[36:38] of make you
[36:40] feel numb. And by that, I don't mean
[36:42] that you're sitting around in a stoop or
[36:45] &gt;&gt; I mean it's like you uh something happy
[36:48] happens around you, you can't feel
[36:50] happy,
[36:51] &gt;&gt; you know, it doesn't affect you.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; You know, somebody can do something that
[36:55] normally would really upset you and you
[36:58] can't even feel upset,
[36:59] &gt;&gt; right? you know uh and and with that
[37:03] then you realize then uh you I used to
[37:07] tell my brother when my brother we were
[37:09] going places together I'd say I can't
[37:11] even feel excited in the services you
[37:14] know
[37:14] &gt;&gt; and I know we don't depend on emotions
[37:17] but man I still like them
[37:18] &gt;&gt; yeah exactly yeah me too
[37:20] &gt;&gt; I love to feel the you want to feel and
[37:23] that's normal
[37:24] &gt;&gt; and that and
[37:25] &gt;&gt; but it's just interesting the enemy has
[37:27] the depression where you withdraw from
[37:30] people and you withdraw, you know, and
[37:32] and but then you go on the medicines and
[37:34] it numbs you that you can't feel either.
[37:36] So, it's kind of like a double whammy
[37:38] there, you know.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; So, so the medicines
[37:42] &gt;&gt; I uh I talked to my brother a lot
[37:45] because he and I took a couple of trips
[37:47] together. Uh one back in uh 2017 and one
[37:52] in 2019.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; I remember that one to the Phil one to
[37:54] the Philippines,
[37:55] &gt;&gt; two of them were to the Philippines. Y
[37:57] &gt;&gt; and so I got to spend a lot of time with
[37:58] him, just me and him one on- one and
[38:01] talking and uh you know and uh and I was
[38:05] trying to express to him and I kept
[38:06] telling him I hate this stuff. I don't
[38:08] want to be on it,
[38:10] &gt;&gt; you know.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And uh I went over to the Philippines
[38:13] and I remember brother Roel Soriano and
[38:15] brother Landlan, I don't know if you
[38:17] remember him. Yeah, good friend. So they
[38:19] they both told me they had saw me like
[38:21] 20 years prior to that when I'd went
[38:23] over there and preached and they were
[38:24] like ah you're different now you what
[38:27] what's going on with you preaching and
[38:28] brother Lland actually came over and
[38:31] visited me in Dixon and stayed with me
[38:33] to to visit and talk and he goes what's
[38:36] going on brother Jerry you don't preach
[38:37] the same you're different and so I was
[38:39] telling him this is what's going on
[38:41] &gt;&gt; you know
[38:43] &gt;&gt; and uh but then uh like I said I I did
[38:47] start
[38:48] walking every morning. Okay. And and I
[38:51] started uh uh dieting because you know
[38:54] they say when you when a person's
[38:55] suffering mentally they usually do one
[38:56] of two things. They either quit eating
[38:58] altogether and then they lose they lose
[39:02] unhealthy amount of weight you know or
[39:04] they eat for comfort
[39:06] &gt;&gt; more. Yeah.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; And mine was I ate for comfort.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; You know. Yeah. So, it was nothing for
[39:11] me to run out to a truck stop that had a
[39:15] a Subway or a McDonald's in the middle
[39:17] of the night and and and and grab food,
[39:20] bring it back, and eat because I
[39:21] thought, well, it was making me feel
[39:22] better, you know. And so, um uh I
[39:26] actually uh
[39:28] &gt;&gt; um I I got up I was way overweight,
[39:32] grossly overweight, you know, I still
[39:34] overweight, but I was really bad.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; And that was affecting me physically,
[39:38] too.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So I um I I I started
[39:43] walking. I started uh watching what I
[39:45] was eating. And I was actually getting
[39:47] help uh uh medical guidance from
[39:50] nutritions and things like that.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; And uh and so I actually end up losing
[39:55] 80 lbs.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm not where I want to be yet.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; But it did really start helping me, you
[40:01] know.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; It's so true. And I might as well be
[40:02] honest with you, too, you know, cuz I
[40:04] have the same struggle sometimes. And I
[40:06] remember two or three years ago, we had
[40:08] something come up in the church and I
[40:10] had lost 20 30 pounds. But when that
[40:13] thing hit the church, I hit a state of
[40:15] be feeling real low and I turned to
[40:17] food. Yeah.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And uh you know, that's that's what
[40:20] depression can do. But we're always
[40:22] turning to something to help relieve it.
[40:24] But you know, that's not the answer for
[40:26] sure. What what is the uh let me just
[40:29] ask you this, brother Jerry. Um, was
[40:32] there a certain embarrassment that went
[40:34] with this?
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You you you felt you you did
[40:38] feel like shame and and and and also see
[40:43] because that there there there was
[40:46] individuals you you knew that believed
[40:48] or thought a certain way, you know, that
[40:50] you were associated with that you didn't
[40:53] want them to know what was going on with
[40:54] you.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? you know,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; and u uh cuz I mean, you had enough of
[40:59] the devil attacking you, telling you you
[41:01] ain't got it, and this is why you're
[41:03] suffering with this and all this, you
[41:04] know,
[41:05] &gt;&gt; and so you wanted to hide it.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you don't know, as I
[41:09] said, it's it's not very talked about.
[41:12] So, you got this fear is that you don't
[41:14] want it out there because you don't know
[41:15] how people are going to label you. You
[41:17] don't know what people are going to say.
[41:18] I mean, I think you get support from
[41:20] real, you know, people that understand,
[41:23] but you might get some criticism. So
[41:24] that's probably another reason why you
[41:26] don't want to tell anybody. But there is
[41:27] a certain embarrassment that goes with
[41:28] it.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there there is an embarrassment
[41:30] that goes with it. Uh you don't want
[41:32] anybody to see you going through an
[41:34] attack. Yeah.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; You know, uh because uh you don't make
[41:38] any sense when you're talking.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Wow. You know,
[41:40] &gt;&gt; my goodness.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; And uh I remember I was getting ready to
[41:44] I was 53 years old. I'm 62 now. I was 53
[41:48] years old. And uh all of a sudden this
[41:51] anxiety and fear came on in me because
[41:54] my my grandfather that I grew up so
[41:57] close to, he died at the age of 55.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And so this anxiety was crushing me.
[42:03] You're getting ready to turn 54. You're
[42:05] going to die. And that doesn't even make
[42:07] good reasonable sense, you know?
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Uh my grandfather, he worked in the coal
[42:11] mines. He had black lungs and and and
[42:13] heart. And uh before he came to the
[42:15] Lord, he drank and he smoked and he so
[42:16] he done all kinds of things that you
[42:18] know was against him.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Contributed to it.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so uh uh and and he actually
[42:24] needed open heart surgery and he refused
[42:27] to have it and then he died from a heart
[42:28] attack not long after that.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; But uh you know here was this whole
[42:32] thing just crushing on me. You're
[42:33] getting ready to turn 54, you're going
[42:34] to die.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; My goodness. you know,
[42:37] &gt;&gt; and uh and so, you know, and and the
[42:39] reason I mention that is because when
[42:41] that hit me, I was with my wife and I
[42:44] was actually outside the house by the
[42:46] driveway and and so I'm out there just
[42:48] blubbering and I'm telling her I'm going
[42:50] to die, you know,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; and she's trying to reason with me and
[42:54] say, "That doesn't even make sense, you
[42:55] know." Yeah.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; And that and you so you there is
[42:57] embarrassment. You don't want nobody to
[42:59] see you like that. Yeah.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; You know,
[43:01] &gt;&gt; and I mentioned tonight when I was
[43:03] preaching that, you know, I got a really
[43:04] good friend down there. in West
[43:06] Tennessee, Brother Boaten.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And I uh I actually would sort of
[43:11] withdraw from everybody. I wouldn't go
[43:13] visit no churches. I wouldn't go
[43:15] anywhere. I did come up to visit uh my
[43:18] folks and and my brother would kind of
[43:21] kind of push me and force me into to
[43:24] speak and you know, and that and uh but
[43:26] I didn't want to go anywhere else. Yeah.
[43:28] you know, and uh other brothers that
[43:31] knew me and had me come and I'd go
[43:33] preach and things like that, they they
[43:35] started asking my brother, "What
[43:37] happened?" Yeah.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; You know, where what happened to him?
[43:39] Where is he? You know,
[43:41] &gt;&gt; and uh so uh brother Bomeen, he I didn't
[43:46] call him.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't leave me alone.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; He called me.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; That's wonder,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; you know. And so wonderful.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; He he would call me. He would text me.
[43:56] He would uh uh he he would then come and
[43:59] visit me. He'd come and pray for me, you
[44:01] know, and and and but brother Bo never
[44:04] made me feel condemned.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; You know, he and he didn't try to sit
[44:08] down and fix me.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; He wasn't trying to fix you,
[44:11] &gt;&gt; you know. He he would uh he would try to
[44:14] relate from uh things that he had went
[44:17] through and that, you know,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; uh and he would just uh you know, was
[44:22] telling me to have faith and he would
[44:24] pray for me. He'd come preach for me.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. you know, and uh and one
[44:28] time he came and preached for us and I
[44:30] was really at my lowest and and I was
[44:33] feeling so defeated and and so I like I
[44:37] said tonight, I don't even remember what
[44:38] he preached. I couldn't keep my mind
[44:40] together to even, you know, enjoy what
[44:42] he was preaching.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; But um
[44:44] &gt;&gt; but he was a friend that
[44:45] &gt;&gt; I just want to stop on that point. He
[44:47] was a friend that wasn't trying to fix
[44:48] it. And what's amazing about this story
[44:51] is 12 years. I mean this a long time in
[44:54] your life as a pastor and you know we
[44:58] always when we're trying to help
[44:59] somebody as pastor help someone else we
[45:02] always trying to we got to come up with
[45:03] the answer quick. We got to get an
[45:04] answer you know get a quote or get a
[45:06] scripture and it's good to bring the
[45:07] scriptures but it's God's timing when he
[45:10] brings his deliverance. And someone
[45:12] spoke the other night at the at the
[45:13] church uh last week it was brother
[45:15] Brandon our assistant pastor about God
[45:17] in the waiting finding God in the
[45:19] waiting. And so we know there's a
[45:21] difference in miracles and healing and
[45:23] sometimes the healing takes a while. We
[45:26] don't seem to be willing sometimes to
[45:27] wait for that. Trust God. This was a
[45:29] long time for you. And uh you know just
[45:32] &gt;&gt; you know brother Brandham makes a
[45:33] statement about that what you were
[45:34] talking about healing and miracles. And
[45:35] brother Brandham said it takes more
[45:37] faith for divine healing than it does
[45:38] for a miracle.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. I've read that before. It's
[45:41] it's amazing. But we seem to be anxious
[45:43] and people want to fix it and what can I
[45:45] say? You know even in my counseling how
[45:47] can I get to the bottom of this right
[45:49] away? And sometimes you just need that
[45:51] prayer of faith and that concern and
[45:53] that care and those encouraging words
[45:55] and uh let God bring it in in his own
[45:57] time, you know, and continue to believe
[45:59] that way. So, I know you're getting
[46:01] close to the end there of sharing uh
[46:03] what what happened uh in that service
[46:06] with brother Boen. Um what before you
[46:09] get there, I just want to say I want to
[46:12] ask what did God show you through these
[46:14] 12 years, brother Jerry? And what were
[46:16] the steps then that begin to bring you
[46:18] to your deliverance? What did God show
[46:21] you? And what were the steps that
[46:22] brought you to deliverance?
[46:22] &gt;&gt; What he showed me was, you know, that
[46:24] you can't if you're to deny that you're
[46:28] actually suffering from something is not
[46:30] faith.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. That's just denial.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; You know, when somebody says, "Well, I'm
[46:36] just not going to claim that." Well, I
[46:38] don't believe in claiming, you know, not
[46:40] claim, you know, that I believe in
[46:42] claiming your healing. Yeah.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. But don't lie to yourself and say,
[46:46] "Well, this doesn't happen. I don't this
[46:48] doesn't exist. That's not being real."
[46:50] &gt;&gt; That it is real. And if you you want to
[46:53] be healed from it, you you first got to
[46:56] say, "Yes, this is going on."
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; You know, right.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; And um and so I uh I I came to that to
[47:04] realize that, but I I also realized that
[47:07] wasn't what God had for me. God wasn't
[47:09] done for me. this wasn't his plan for
[47:11] me,
[47:12] &gt;&gt; you know,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; and um uh you know, and and many times
[47:17] we want, like you were saying, we want
[47:18] something instant. We just want to
[47:20] instantly be healed, instantly be done
[47:22] with whatever trial we're going through,
[47:24] &gt;&gt; you know, and I can tell you this, while
[47:26] I was going through all that, we
[47:28] actually had a a a court case come up
[47:31] within our family. somebody in our
[47:33] family was falsely accused of something
[47:35] and we went through a year-long court uh
[47:38] &gt;&gt; my
[47:39] &gt;&gt; case with this during that time
[47:41] &gt;&gt; my my my
[47:42] &gt;&gt; and uh and I remember during that you
[47:45] know praying and actually myself trying
[47:47] to fix this situation you know
[47:51] &gt;&gt; and God didn't he didn't want my help
[47:54] &gt;&gt; wow
[47:54] &gt;&gt; you know and God took care of it
[47:56] &gt;&gt; so that's one thing you got you had to
[47:58] learn in se several instances that God
[48:01] wants you to wait for his timing,
[48:03] &gt;&gt; just try to fix. And
[48:06] &gt;&gt; you know, it uh I can tell you this, I I
[48:10] remember a time when I first started
[48:11] pastoring, we had a lot of folks that
[48:13] were suffering from different illnesses
[48:15] in the church. And uh you know, I had
[48:18] I'd been associate pastor up there in
[48:20] Lorraine uh for for a number of years
[48:22] with my father, but okay.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; I just I just felt like, man, I I'm
[48:27] lacking in faith here or something to
[48:29] help these people. Mhm.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, I need to have
[48:32] somebody come preach that I think that
[48:34] has a lot of faith. So, I called up
[48:36] brother Juel Forny.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; I said, "Come preach for me, brother. I
[48:39] got some people that need to be healed,
[48:40] you know." Yeah.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; And uh and I thought, "I really need
[48:43] some help in this, you know."
[48:45] &gt;&gt; But I through this I I believe I
[48:48] actually began to learn really what
[48:49] faith is. Faith isn't something that
[48:52] it's not just positive thinking,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; right? You know,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; exactly. It's it's um uh there's there's
[48:59] something that anchors.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And it's something that surpasses
[49:04] understanding and reasoning.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; It's you know, as the Bible says, it's
[49:08] the evidence of things that you can't
[49:09] see.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; You know, the unseen. Brother Ram says,
[49:12] you can't see, taste, feel it, or smell
[49:14] it. Yeah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; But it's the evidence of it. You know,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; and uh uh I I you know, I might be
[49:21] suffering from this, but I got faith I'm
[49:23] going to be healed. And that's the
[49:24] evidence I am going to be healed because
[49:25] God's the one that gave you that faith,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; you know.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; And and his word is it's all through the
[49:31] Bible. It's all about faith.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. And that's the reason I ask
[49:35] what you learn through it because you
[49:36] know and that's one of the great things
[49:38] you learn and because I feel like that
[49:40] besides the victory of getting over the
[49:42] depression and that it's the it's the
[49:45] victories throughout that God is doing
[49:48] people don't see those as victories but
[49:50] the victory of learning the power of
[49:53] holding faith there and substance faith
[49:55] during the waiting. That's a victory as
[49:57] well. And sometimes we skip over wanting
[50:00] this particular thing to be delivered
[50:01] from. But God's got all this to teach
[50:03] you in between which are victories as
[50:05] well. You know what was the steps as we
[50:07] come to a close here pretty soon? What's
[50:09] the steps that led up to the full
[50:10] deliverance then?
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Um well as I was telling you you know I
[50:14] started trying to do what I could
[50:15] physically. Okay
[50:16] &gt;&gt; because they tell you that uh you know
[50:20] exercise kind helps uh your brain to
[50:23] actually start to function to produce
[50:25] the right kind of chemicals endorphins
[50:27] and so forth you know.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to start jogging
[50:30] tomorrow. I'm going to start jogging
[50:31] tomorrow. And and you know the the Bible
[50:34] tells us, you know, that there there's
[50:36] actually healing through laughter.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; You know, and when I and when I would
[50:42] think about that, I always thought about
[50:44] uh your your father, you know, and that
[50:47] song that he would sing and uh you know,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; the joy of the Lord is my strength. Oh
[50:52] my goodness. And uh so uh the more that
[50:55] they when the doctors started telling me
[50:57] this thing about these endorphins and
[50:59] all these things and how they help you
[51:00] and while they were telling me I just
[51:02] kept thinking about your father in that
[51:04] song he would sing you know and I then
[51:07] it would take me to the scripture on it
[51:09] you know. Oh my.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; And so I I you know and and and my dad
[51:14] used to say he would say look if uh you
[51:18] he said start praising the Lord and
[51:20] singing even when you don't feel like
[51:22] it.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; You know because he says that the the
[51:26] angel of the Lord's encamped about those
[51:28] that fear him. But brother Brandham says
[51:30] he comes to his praise.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; You know
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and so I think that that's let me say
[51:36] this. uh you know I I had had trouble
[51:40] with with sleeping to try to get my mind
[51:42] to turn off. And so what uh what I did
[51:46] was I would put on music.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; And I believe there's a a lot of healing
[51:52] that could come through music.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; That's what
[51:54] &gt;&gt; you know and singing. And that's what I
[51:55] would do,
[51:56] &gt;&gt; you know, and it was it was like
[51:58] soothing. And we know in the Bible David
[52:01] would come and play on the harp and
[52:03] things and soothe Saul. Of course, we
[52:05] know Saul was being afflicted and we
[52:07] know why.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But still, it's healing from the
[52:10] music. It's anointed music
[52:11] &gt;&gt; and that. And so, uh, and then, um,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; uh, when I was having the, uh, the
[52:18] attacks of the PTSD, which and I don't
[52:20] want to drag this out, but, uh, you
[52:23] know, you you start experiencing
[52:25] everything that you experienced whenever
[52:27] that traumatic event happened. So, it it
[52:29] affects you again all over again. M
[52:31] &gt;&gt; and so uh and and then you actually lose
[52:34] contact with reasonable logical
[52:36] thinking.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And so uh I had uh I had read where
[52:42] brother Brandham talked about uh having
[52:45] a a cross hanging in off his mirror in
[52:48] his car,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; right? And he would say something about
[52:51] when uh uh some ungodly woman come down
[52:54] the street, he would just turn and look
[52:55] at the cross, you know,
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and and then I thought about what with
[52:59] when he gives a testimony about John
[53:01] Ryan with his healing and that he he
[53:04] said I realized John Ryan needed
[53:05] something. He said, "So I told him, you
[53:08] just keep confessing by his stripes I'm
[53:10] healed." you know, and that. So, uh,
[53:14] when I was thinking about that, so what
[53:15] I did was, uh, I went and I actually,
[53:19] uh, I found a cross that was actually
[53:21] made for soldiers, you know, and I had
[53:23] been a soldier, so I found this cross
[53:26] and it was made for soldiers and that
[53:27] and it was on a piece of rawhide.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I kept that with me.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. And uh when I would
[53:34] start to to to go through this and have
[53:37] an attack that I would take out that
[53:39] cross and I would hold on to it, you
[53:41] know, and I would just claim I would
[53:43] just claim the blood. I would just claim
[53:45] healing. I would claim by his stripes
[53:46] I'm healed.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; You know,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; and and the thing about it was, Brother
[53:50] Paul, you you think that it was, you
[53:52] know, like you said, healing did not
[53:54] come instantly to me.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; But it's persevering.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I think that's one of the
[53:59] things that I learned that I when I've
[54:01] talked to other people that are going
[54:02] through things like this is don't give
[54:04] up. You persevere. It doesn't matter whe
[54:07] whatever the sickness is. You know, if
[54:09] you're battling cancer, if you're
[54:11] battling whatever it is, yeah, I'm not
[54:14] telling them don't go have your do
[54:15] whatever that you feel led of God to do,
[54:18] whatever he gives you peace to do with
[54:20] treatments or whatever else, you know,
[54:22] but don't give up. Don't give into this
[54:25] is what my life how it's going to be
[54:28] &gt;&gt; because uh that's you know brother
[54:31] Brandham teaches us that that is not how
[54:33] God wants his people to be
[54:36] &gt;&gt; you know
[54:37] &gt;&gt; and that's why he provided a healing for
[54:40] us. He that's why he you know he talks
[54:43] to Sister Bruce in an interview and
[54:44] she's talking about her mistakes
[54:46] &gt;&gt; and and things and so brother Brandham I
[54:48] just want to point out this statement he
[54:49] makes. He goes, "That's what Jesus died
[54:52] for." And so I would hang on to that
[54:55] little statement brother Brandham would
[54:57] say and and when I was going through
[54:59] these things and suffering so say this
[55:02] is what Jesus died for.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; My that's good, brother.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; You know, he died for me. He died for me
[55:06] to be delivered from this.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; My my and as I said, the atonement
[55:09] covered it all. So that's that's
[55:11] wonderful.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; And so I just I just held on and like
[55:14] you said, and I I said it tonight kind
[55:15] of emphasized on it.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord thy God that heals all. all
[55:19] of thy diseases.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Thy diseases.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; So talk about that la that one service
[55:24] where you you know you've talked about
[55:26] you know and and brother Brandham talked
[55:28] about he said there's healing in music
[55:30] there's healing in laughter according to
[55:32] the scripture laughter doeth good like a
[55:34] medicine you know you talk about the
[55:36] medicine there's healing in medicine but
[55:39] all this leading up to that and then you
[55:42] come to growing into that service
[55:44] brother Bo spoke what happened there.
[55:46] Well, at the service, Brother Bo spoke,
[55:48] um, you know, I was I was still
[55:50] suffering really bad, but the the enemy
[55:53] was attacking me then, saying, you know,
[55:55] this is what it is. You just don't have
[55:57] it, you know.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And in that service of Brother Bo come
[56:00] and spoke, uh, I I had my wife, I told
[56:04] her, I said, "Help me get up to the
[56:05] front." And so, she grabbed my arm and
[56:07] helped me up to the front and I said,
[56:08] "Brother Bo, lay hands on me and pray
[56:10] for me." You know, and uh, I didn't get
[56:13] healed, brother. I still suffered for
[56:15] several years after that.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; But but what happened in that service
[56:19] was you know the power of God came down
[56:22] and and u you know uh I fell out on the
[56:27] floor.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; You know and uh um brother Bo said he
[56:32] told the people he's okay. He he that's
[56:35] just the spirit of God. Yeah. You know.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh and and and all it did was
[56:40] it just it gave me this little
[56:42] assurance, you know, hey, look, God
[56:44] still cares about me, you know. And uh
[56:47] &gt;&gt; didn't you get up the next service and
[56:49] say,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; well, no, it wasn't actually the next
[56:50] service. It was actually it was actually
[56:52] several years after that really. It
[56:54] still went on. But I after I started uh
[56:59] like you know walking and doing all
[57:00] these different things and that I
[57:02] started telling the the doctor I was
[57:04] seeing I said start I want off these
[57:06] medicines. I want to be completely off
[57:08] of them. You know
[57:10] &gt;&gt; and of course they tell you you can't go
[57:11] just stop taking them you know that uh
[57:15] it will cause other bad effects and
[57:17] stuff. So they started decreasing them
[57:20] little by little by little and then
[57:22] certain ones I came completely off of
[57:25] but I was still on I think maybe a
[57:28] couple right there but it was very
[57:31] reduced u prescription of them you know
[57:35] and so you know but I was I I really
[57:39] believed I was healed and and I was
[57:41] tired of going through this weaning
[57:43] process you know
[57:44] &gt;&gt; okay
[57:45] &gt;&gt; and so I I gave the testimony to the
[57:47] church cuz I was I was feeling different
[57:49] when I preached. I was feeling different
[57:50] when I studied, you know. I was I was
[57:52] just and I told him I said, "Look, God
[57:54] has healed me."
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I want to tell you from
[57:56] this day forward, I'm not taking any
[57:58] more medicine." You know, I said, "I'm
[58:00] done with it." You know,
[58:01] &gt;&gt; amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And uh so uh you know, and of course
[58:05] then I went home. That was on a Sunday.
[58:08] I went home and uh that was during that
[58:12] week, Satan attacked me with anxiety
[58:14] attacks.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. you know, and of course he
[58:17] was telling me it's because you went
[58:18] cold turkey off these medicines. It's
[58:20] because you're not taking the medicines.
[58:21] It's because of this or that. You know,
[58:22] and I guess I I said cold tur, but you
[58:24] know, my wife talked me into and I don't
[58:27] I wasn't going to say this and God bless
[58:29] her. I love her. She loves me. Uh she
[58:31] she talked me into letting her decrease
[58:34] it one pill a day here.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Until we were done that week. Okay. But
[58:38] anyway, by the end of that week, I was
[58:40] suffering really bad from an anxiety
[58:41] attack that was going on. And I I and I,
[58:45] like I said, tonight I I sleep with the
[58:47] CPAT machine, which has constant air
[58:49] blowing in your face, but I would lay
[58:51] down and it was like I couldn't breathe.
[58:53] And that started that Sunday night after
[58:54] I gave the testimony.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; And uh this is the whole thing. I
[58:58] believe you give a testimony, Satan's
[59:00] going to attack you from that testimony.
[59:02] Yeah.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; You know, exactly.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; And and and so he I I would I told my
[59:07] wife, I can't breathe. I would set back
[59:09] up. I said, "Lay your hands on me and
[59:10] pray for me." And I told her, I said, "I
[59:12] know I'm healed. I know this is just the
[59:13] devil, you know, but uh it wasn't
[59:17] something that I could just through
[59:19] positive thinking make go away."
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And so I suffered that whole week
[59:25] through that. And I think maybe on
[59:27] Friday or Saturday, I text my my mom and
[59:31] I said, "Mom, you got to pray for me."
[59:33] You know, and um and and and to be
[59:37] honest, I did I hadn't reached out to
[59:38] anybody else in my church or anybody
[59:40] else. I didn't tell anybody else what
[59:42] was going on.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Here. I gave this testimony. Yeah.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; So, I think Satan was kind of shaming me
[59:46] again, too.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And so, uh uh but I told my mom. So, my
[59:50] mom texted my brother who was preaching
[59:52] out somewhere getting ready to go into a
[59:54] service. And so, he sent her a quote.
[59:57] She forwarded to me uh where brother
[59:59] Brandham had prayed for somebody who had
[1:00:03] uh was cancer and said they were healed
[1:00:06] and then they got more sick and worse
[1:00:09] after that. And brother Brandham said,
[1:00:11] "Tell them that's the best sign in the
[1:00:13] world that they're healed, that they're
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; and when I read that,
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; uh, it wasn't that my thoughts changed,
[1:00:22] okay? It wasn't anything that something
[1:00:24] supernatural anchored."
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; And and when it did, immediately that
[1:00:30] heavy weight that I felt like was on my
[1:00:31] chest and the and the breathing and all
[1:00:33] that, it completely changed. Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You know, and and it was gone. And I've
[1:00:39] never that I think like you and I talked
[1:00:42] I think it was his last ditch effort of
[1:00:44] Satan right his last attack on me with
[1:00:46] that you know
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; after you proclaim the healing get off
[1:00:48] the medicine
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; and so uh you know and then you know it
[1:00:53] just supernatural happened there and
[1:00:56] then that was gone and I've never
[1:00:58] experienced any of it ever again.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Never experiencing it again. And when
[1:01:02] was that that that day happened?
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; September of 2023. And you never had any
[1:01:07] other bout with it at all?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; No. No depression, no anxiety, no
[1:01:11] nothing, you know. And and not only
[1:01:13] that, but I say God's restored me, you
[1:01:16] know, and and to the to the detriment of
[1:01:19] the devil. God actually taught me a lot
[1:01:23] through this, allow me to go through it,
[1:01:24] you know, like you look at Job.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Job uh you know, everything he went
[1:01:31] through and where does Job come out at
[1:01:34] the end of it? Job comes out with one of
[1:01:36] the greatest revelations at that time
[1:01:38] and day, you know,
[1:01:41] he comes out with a revelation of the
[1:01:43] resurrection.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; exactly.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And so I I believe that that
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; I've come out greater and and
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; from that, you know.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Well, and I don't claim to be a
[1:01:56] superhero, brother Paul, or anything
[1:01:58] like that,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; but but I can tell you this. Uh I I
[1:02:03] believe I I've got more tenacity about
[1:02:05] this than ever before. And uh uh I uh
[1:02:12] I'm like a bulldog with the faith on it
[1:02:14] now. Like brother Brandham talked about
[1:02:15] Jack Cole, you know.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And uh I I I just I I want to tell
[1:02:20] others, you know, no matter what you're
[1:02:22] suffering from,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; just don't quit. Don't let go. You are
[1:02:25] going to get your healing.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; You know, don't never feel like, well,
[1:02:28] it's been going on so many years. This
[1:02:30] is just the way it's going to be.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; You know, just never quit.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Well, you preached to our church tonight
[1:02:36] on being bullied
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; by the enemy
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; and you were bullied for 12 years.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir, brother.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; But one of the last things there that
[1:02:44] you said, and I actually thought it
[1:02:46] actually before you were saying it, is
[1:02:47] that you were afraid, intimidated,
[1:02:50] bullied by the enemy, but now I believe
[1:02:52] the devil's afraid of you. And you said
[1:02:55] that now the devil's afraid of me, and
[1:02:56] that's the way it's supposed to be. Uh,
[1:02:58] I'll tell you, he's he's on the run. And
[1:03:01] this testimony, he's on the run with a
[1:03:03] lot of people, too, because I believe
[1:03:04] it's going to be an encouragement. I
[1:03:06] wanted to uh say one last thing, and I I
[1:03:08] appreciate you taking this time tonight
[1:03:10] to to share. Um, I want to say thank
[1:03:14] you, brother Jerry, for the honesty, for
[1:03:18] the transparency,
[1:03:20] for the willingness to be able to tell
[1:03:23] the whole thing because I think there's
[1:03:26] still a lot of people that are not
[1:03:27] willing to do that when it comes to a
[1:03:29] subject like this. They don't want to
[1:03:31] talk about, as you said, it was
[1:03:32] embarrassing. Sometimes the environments
[1:03:34] we're in, we don't want to share
[1:03:36] weakness. And yet and yet uh brother
[1:03:38] Brandham spoke that uh message perfect
[1:03:41] strength by weakness. He says the the
[1:03:42] Pentecostals are always you know
[1:03:45] bragging about how strong they are. But
[1:03:47] it's when we become weak that he becomes
[1:03:50] strong. And that's what he tried to
[1:03:51] teach us is that to me it's not weakness
[1:03:54] for somebody to be transparent and open
[1:03:56] especially a minister of this message a
[1:03:58] minister of the message of the last days
[1:04:01] to be open about it is going to bless a
[1:04:03] lot of people because to me brother
[1:04:05] Biscll said something uh years ago he
[1:04:08] said the only way to deal with the devil
[1:04:10] is to expose them.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; The only day way to deal with demons is
[1:04:15] to expose them. That's why I talk about
[1:04:16] when you get more knowledge of what's
[1:04:17] going on you become knowledgeable. you
[1:04:20] become, okay, I know what's taking place
[1:04:22] now, but you're exposing through the
[1:04:24] confession of the of of the the cross,
[1:04:27] the blood of Jesus Christ, his healing.
[1:04:29] Um, you're exposing the enemy. And when
[1:04:32] you're transparent and share it from
[1:04:34] your heart, this is what happened. I'm
[1:04:35] being real. I'm a Christian. I'm a Holy
[1:04:37] Ghost fil, but this this was real. This
[1:04:40] happened, too.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; The the devil's power
[1:04:44] lays in remaining hidden.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; So true. And whenever he's exposed, he
[1:04:49] loses that power.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; So true. And I was just thinking
[1:04:52] yesterday, you know, the scriptures says
[1:04:54] two or three places he reveals the
[1:04:56] secrets of the heart. And uh and he
[1:05:00] still does that. You know, when they
[1:05:01] remain a secret, Satan can really wreak
[1:05:04] havoc with that. But when he reveals the
[1:05:06] secrets of the heart and we're honest
[1:05:07] about and we bring things, God brings
[1:05:09] them out, God exposes them. That's a
[1:05:11] victory. And I think it's a great step
[1:05:13] for you to do that. You know, I know of
[1:05:16] um I'm blessed to know a lot of
[1:05:18] ministers and a lot of uh friends and
[1:05:20] people that really do believe. My sister
[1:05:23] Sharon um was just healed of a tumor.
[1:05:26] She just completely gone as of a few
[1:05:28] weeks ago. Um we didn't expect her to uh
[1:05:32] live. It didn't look good for her and it
[1:05:35] was rough on our family and just uh you
[1:05:38] know, the Lord completely delivered her.
[1:05:40] So, you know, we believe those things,
[1:05:42] but we when we're going through
[1:05:43] something and you're honest, I know a
[1:05:44] lot of people, a lot of ministers, I
[1:05:47] think there's a smaller number that
[1:05:49] would be transparent about it, say, "I'm
[1:05:51] being real, and I'm not going to let the
[1:05:53] devil dechristianize me or take away
[1:05:54] what I've got, but this is real. I've
[1:05:57] been through it." And the and God's
[1:05:58] going to get the glory at the end of it.
[1:06:00] At the end of 12 years, God gets the
[1:06:02] glory for it. And so, I I appreciate it.
[1:06:05] I love you very much. appreciate your
[1:06:07] stand for the message all these years,
[1:06:09] but this brings an extra element I think
[1:06:11] that's going to bless some other people
[1:06:13] uh that's going through things and as
[1:06:14] you you've shared with them uh whatever
[1:06:17] they're going through, you know, don't
[1:06:18] give up.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Don't give up for sure. So, I appreciate
[1:06:22] you, buddy.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you and thank you so much for
[1:06:25] sharing.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
