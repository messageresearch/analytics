[0:01] this is be the uh
[0:05] continuing talking about blessed
[0:07] families how many wants a blessed family
[0:09] getting down to the nitty-gritty of
[0:11] things a little bit but i appreciate all
[0:13] the comments that's come in
[0:15] even some that are listening on
[0:17] the streaming some that aren't in our
[0:19] congregation have jumped on to
[0:21] the blessed family series and i think
[0:23] it's because they just want to have a
[0:24] better family
[0:26] and this isn't worldly based isn't
[0:28] carnal minded based it's not
[0:30] uh it's not even really
[0:32] james dobson or any kind of psychology
[0:35] of the world or christian psychology i'm
[0:37] trying to stay right in the scripture
[0:38] with it
[0:39] and uh because i need to learn i need to
[0:41] be a better we need to be a better
[0:43] family for the lord so i hope you have
[0:44] your ears on your spiritual ears and i
[0:46] hope you're listening and
[0:48] i just appreciate all the comments and
[0:50] it's just been a blessing i think more
[0:51] to me than others but i'm just glad that
[0:53] we're able to take this time so this is
[0:54] blessed families part nine tonight
[0:56] blessed families part nine
[0:58] i don't know how many parts it'll have
[1:00] to it
[1:01] but we'll just finish when we get done
[1:05] amen
[1:07] brother branham was preached a couple
[1:08] years uh job on the ash heap
[1:11] for a couple years and they said when
[1:12] are you going to get him off the ash
[1:14] sheep
[1:15] well i tried to get him off but he just
[1:16] preached for a long time i think it was
[1:18] a year he said not two years about a
[1:19] year
[1:20] and just talking about that one one
[1:23] place in scripture ephesians four and
[1:24] verse
[1:25] and i want you to think of this in light
[1:27] when as we read up into verse
[1:30] 15 i want you to think that's in light
[1:32] of family okay think of these scriptures
[1:35] in light of family
[1:37] and the body of christ i therefore the
[1:39] prisoner of the lord beseech you that
[1:41] you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:44] wherewith you are called
[1:46] we have been called in the end time not
[1:48] only to chris to be a christian not only
[1:51] to salvation but we've been called to
[1:53] more than salvation we've been called to
[1:56] the age of adoption to grow up as sons
[1:58] and daughters of god and to come to the
[2:00] final completion of redemption that's
[2:02] our vocation that's our calling
[2:04] and so
[2:05] we should walk worthy of that kind of
[2:08] high calling
[2:09] we are so blessed
[2:12] to be called to the message and to be
[2:14] called to this
[2:16] high calling of the last days we're not
[2:18] better than anybody else but we're so
[2:19] blessed
[2:20] and if you've been called to that that's
[2:22] such a wonderful thing and we we should
[2:24] walk worthy of that vocation where what
[2:26] we are called and i truly believe the
[2:28] rest of the chapter
[2:30] goes into details of how we walk worthy
[2:33] according to that calling
[2:35] and it starts in verse two with saying
[2:36] with all lowliness and meekness with
[2:39] long suffering forbearing one another in
[2:42] love and so probably the first thing
[2:44] that's mentioned here is humility and
[2:46] loneliness
[2:47] um we can't really walk worthy of this
[2:49] great calling without humility
[2:52] let's start there
[2:54] can't walk worthy of the vocation
[2:56] without humility and loneliness so with
[2:58] all loneliness and weakness with long
[3:01] suffering forbearing one another in love
[3:04] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[3:06] spirit in the bond of peace what is the
[3:08] goal that we have
[3:11] it's to keep the unity
[3:13] we endeavor we do everything we can to
[3:15] keep the unity
[3:16] uh of the spirit in the bond of peace
[3:20] there's one body there's one spirit even
[3:22] as you are called in one hope of your
[3:24] calling one lord one faith one baptism i
[3:28] always love how this word is this is
[3:30] worded because um
[3:33] it's one it's it's one of something if
[3:35] you have a lot of something it gets
[3:38] confusing
[3:39] it's like trinity's confusing
[3:42] you know to have three
[3:43] three lords or three gods they see it's
[3:46] three one god and three persons but
[3:48] quite often you have people say well
[3:50] which one do i pray to um if i pray
[3:52] enough to the father to the son then the
[3:54] holy spirit is he left out and so all of
[3:56] that breathes more confusion we only
[3:58] serve one god
[4:00] one father of all and so one lord one
[4:03] faith you say what what faith there are
[4:05] there's only one faith
[4:06] what faith are you what well i'm this
[4:09] i'm baptist i'm denomination i'm this it
[4:11] knows only one faith and that simplifies
[4:14] it can you say amen it helps us to
[4:15] understand it better one lord one faith
[4:18] one baptism one god and father of all
[4:20] who is above all and through all and in
[4:22] you all but unto every one of us is
[4:24] given to grace according to the measure
[4:25] of the gift of christ wherefore he saith
[4:27] when he ascended let's skip down to
[4:29] verse verse 11. what happened when he
[4:32] ascended verse 11 he gave some apostles
[4:35] some prophets some evangelists some
[4:37] pastors and teachers
[4:39] for the work for the perfecting of the
[4:41] saints for the work of the ministry for
[4:44] the edifying of the body of christ till
[4:47] we all come in the what
[4:49] till we all come in the unity of the
[4:51] faith the one faith and of the knowledge
[4:54] of the son of god unto a perfect man
[4:56] unto the measure of the stature of the
[4:58] fullness of christ so once again just as
[5:02] in verse 3 verse 13 mentions the same
[5:05] word and that is till we all come into
[5:07] the unity
[5:09] it mentions unity coming into the unity
[5:11] and this is this time it says through
[5:13] the five full ministry helping that god
[5:15] sent the fightful mystery help us till
[5:17] we come into the unity of the faith and
[5:19] the knowledge of the son of god unto a
[5:20] perfect man unto the measure the stature
[5:23] of the fullness of christ so the goal is
[5:25] unity the goal is the unity of the faith
[5:28] the goal of the world is more diversity
[5:32] the goal of the world is that we can all
[5:34] branch off into whatever
[5:36] idea that we have and they we all
[5:39] tolerate one another
[5:41] the goal of the christian walk and the
[5:44] goal of the holy ghost is unity of the
[5:46] spirit
[5:47] can you say amen
[5:49] it's not the goal of the world that's
[5:50] for sure but we come in the unity that
[5:52] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[5:55] to and fro fro and carried about with
[5:57] every wind of doctrine by the slideman
[5:59] so that must be a characteristic of
[6:01] children being tossed about to and fro
[6:04] by every wind of doctrine and so
[6:08] if we're being children and tossed about
[6:10] what by every different idea that we're
[6:12] then we're not growing into the unity of
[6:13] the spirit
[6:15] if we're being tossed about like
[6:16] children and so
[6:18] think of that in life as families we
[6:21] need to be stable we need to be
[6:23] consistent
[6:24] because if we're tossed about as far as
[6:26] what we believe as far as where we're at
[6:29] then our children we've certainly tossed
[6:31] them out
[6:32] right so so that we henceforth and from
[6:35] here on out be no more children tossed
[6:37] and grow and carried about with every
[6:38] wind of doctrine by the slight of man
[6:41] and cunning crappiness so the strange
[6:43] doctrine and the wind of doctrine comes
[6:45] through the slide of men and cunning
[6:46] craftiness that they bring it they lie
[6:48] and wait to deceive
[6:50] verse 15 but speaking the truth in love
[6:53] may grow up into him in all things which
[6:56] the is the head even christ so here's
[6:59] the goal to grow up into him in all
[7:02] things till we all come to the unity the
[7:05] one faith can you say amen the one unity
[7:07] of the not to not to be diverse not to
[7:09] branch off into diversity but the goal
[7:12] to come into the unity of the spirit
[7:14] that one thing that he was bringing us
[7:16] to and growing how many wants to grow
[7:19] uh as it says here grow up into him in
[7:21] all things
[7:22] amen father bless your word tonight and
[7:25] this little series we're doing on
[7:26] wednesday night so you just blessed it
[7:28] lord to me in such a great way i pray
[7:30] you continue to bless it to the ears of
[7:31] the people as we commit my words to you
[7:34] tonight may they be your words may be
[7:35] direction
[7:36] of the holy spirit for uh many lives
[7:39] lord and we just committed to you in
[7:41] jesus name amen
[7:43] god bless you may be seated tonight
[7:45] so when we look at this now i want you
[7:47] to go back to joshua 22 and i want you
[7:49] to keep that foundation in mind about
[7:53] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[7:54] spirit that's the goal
[7:56] so joshua 22
[7:58] is where we led off of last week and
[8:00] i'll just give you a quick
[8:02] background as we read this in joshua 22
[8:05] and verse 10
[8:08] and when they come under the borders of
[8:09] jordan that that are in the land of
[8:11] canaan the children of reuben and the
[8:13] children of gad and the half tribe of
[8:15] manasseh
[8:16] built there an altar by jordan a great
[8:19] altar to see
[8:21] so um without having to go into the
[8:23] whole story from last wednesday night i
[8:25] hope some of you were here and some were
[8:27] weren't but i'll try to get to the
[8:28] quickest thing because we really need to
[8:30] move on this is the part that i wanted
[8:32] to get to
[8:33] but we had a tremendous theme here last
[8:35] week and talking about the two tribes
[8:38] as joshua came into the promised land
[8:40] two tribes of israel decided to not go
[8:43] into the promised land they decided to
[8:44] stay on the border they decided and it's
[8:47] right there in scripture they said moses
[8:48] can we stay here he said why they said
[8:51] because we are into cattle and this is
[8:54] the best place to raise our cattle this
[8:56] is a well-watered land this is a
[8:58] wonderful place and uh you know what we
[9:00] and we've decided this is the best place
[9:02] can we stay two tribes now said can we
[9:05] stay this side now all of us are saying
[9:08] today that's crazy we're all going god
[9:10] called them out of egypt for the purpose
[9:13] of bringing into their own land it was
[9:15] the land of promise and we're trying to
[9:17] figure out why in the world somebody
[9:18] would stop short of the promise
[9:21] and say i i don't need to go into all of
[9:24] that i don't need to go in that promise
[9:26] that's all going to be just a bunch of
[9:27] fighting anyway and just trying to find
[9:29] the land i can just sit right here
[9:31] because it's it's it's well watered and
[9:34] they chose a place of convenience that
[9:37] fit their future economic outlook
[9:40] and i was trying to bring to you that we
[9:42] should never do those things our
[9:44] decisions should never be based upon
[9:46] things that would keep us from the
[9:48] promise of god the first thing is the
[9:50] baptism of the holy ghost nothing should
[9:52] keep us from the promise of the baptism
[9:54] of the holy ghost none of us should team
[9:56] to come short of the baptism of the holy
[9:58] ghost and just get on the border of
[10:00] jordan all of our children all of us we
[10:02] need the baptism of the holy ghost that
[10:05] is a promise unto us can you say amen
[10:07] and once you're into that land of the
[10:09] holy ghost you have to fight to keep
[10:11] growing in this great spiritual land and
[10:14] so maybe that's why a lot of people
[10:16] don't want to go there because it's a
[10:17] constant fight to keep growing to keep
[10:19] growing into the full mature son and
[10:21] daughter of god but they chose a place
[10:24] of convenience that fit their future
[10:26] economic outlook not the land of god's
[10:29] promise not god what god promised to
[10:31] them and god's promise wasn't even
[10:34] regarded and moses got upset moses said
[10:37] my how can you
[10:39] i don't understand it and he says now
[10:41] here your brothers are going in to fight
[10:42] and and they have to go fight and you're
[10:44] staying here well they said well i'll
[10:46] tell you what we'll go fight with them
[10:48] but when all the fighting is over and
[10:49] they find their land we still want to
[10:51] come back to this well-watered land
[10:53] because it's the best place for our
[10:54] cattle
[10:56] carnal decision
[10:58] a worldly type decision these are
[11:00] believers now
[11:02] but they chose to be borderline
[11:03] believers
[11:05] and so they made decisions based upon uh
[11:09] a convenience
[11:11] made decisions based upon convenience
[11:13] and so the decisions were placed on the
[11:15] convenience of life
[11:17] over growing in god's spiritual promises
[11:20] and families can make the same mistakes
[11:22] today
[11:24] all of us have the potential in our
[11:26] decisions to make decisions that that
[11:29] are more about other things except the
[11:31] promise being the priority in our lives
[11:34] we should teach our children the
[11:36] promises of god is the priority of our
[11:39] lives
[11:40] growing into god's promises
[11:42] living god's promises
[11:44] walking in god's promises every day from
[11:46] healing to the baptism of the holy ghost
[11:49] to growing as an adopted son to all of
[11:52] god's promises priority of life is that
[11:55] we live in the land of god's promises
[11:58] and i said as i said last wednesday
[11:59] night follow them that in our inheriting
[12:02] the promises
[12:03] getting around the people that are
[12:05] beyond us
[12:06] getting around spiritual believers and
[12:08] getting our kids around spiritual
[12:10] believers that have grown beyond us that
[12:13] because they're inheriting the promises
[12:14] i want to follow anybody that's
[12:16] inheriting the promises
[12:20] praise the lord that's what we try to
[12:22] get around and so families though can
[12:25] make those same mistakes any family
[12:27] could and so now then at the very end of
[12:29] this story after this is now beyond
[12:32] numbers this is the end of the they come
[12:34] into their land and they fought with
[12:36] their brothers and now joshua says it's
[12:38] time you can go back now if you want to
[12:40] go back and they decide to go back so
[12:42] they go back to back across the border
[12:44] back across jordan they find this place
[12:46] that they want to live
[12:48] and the bible says in verse 10 here that
[12:50] they built an altar all right
[12:53] they built an altar of their own
[12:55] the bible says it was a great altar to
[12:58] see
[12:59] now
[13:00] right away israel reacts
[13:02] because that was not supposed to be
[13:05] because of a principle in god that when
[13:08] god sets up an altar there's a provided
[13:11] place of worship and if god sets a place
[13:13] he said that's the place i choose to put
[13:15] my name that's where worship is accepted
[13:18] and that's where all of israel needs to
[13:20] worship we know that now because of the
[13:22] revealing of the word of the last days
[13:24] god's only provided place of worship is
[13:26] not under a denomination it's not under
[13:28] a church as such but it's under the shed
[13:30] blood of jesus christ we know that from
[13:33] abel all the way through then it's
[13:34] always under the shed blood of jesus
[13:36] christ and it is an altar of sacrifice
[13:38] it's not an altar of fruits it's not an
[13:41] altar of doing good deeds we don't come
[13:43] and say here's all my good things i did
[13:45] for people in life this is what i gave
[13:47] to charity this is why how i helped
[13:48] people and that's why i laid up what i
[13:50] lay at the altar that's that's not
[13:52] acceptable to god it's a wonderful thing
[13:55] but that's not what takes care of sin
[13:58] it's an altar of sacrifice and so these
[14:01] two tribes and now they're two and
[14:04] two tribes and another half of another
[14:06] tribe
[14:07] and uh i'll just throw this out to you
[14:09] that means
[14:11] that these borderline believers
[14:12] influenced other believers a half of
[14:14] another tribe to go with them
[14:17] and to live there so influence is a
[14:18] powerful thing
[14:20] wow you're going you've been they gave
[14:22] you permission to live over there you
[14:23] don't have to come and fight every day
[14:24] for the promise you can live in that
[14:26] well-watered land and bring your cattle
[14:28] there we want to do it they influence
[14:30] half of the of another tribe to go with
[14:32] them influence is a powerful thing but
[14:35] this group built an altar it was a great
[14:37] altar maybe they could see it from the
[14:39] other land across jordan they look over
[14:41] saying what is that thing over there
[14:43] that looks just like the real altar it
[14:45] looks like just but it's great i don't
[14:47] know what that word great means but it
[14:48] must have been even more beautiful but
[14:50] it resembled the true altar that joshua
[14:53] had set up in joshua 8 this is the place
[14:55] we're coming together to worship now all
[14:57] of a sudden israel reacts in such a uh
[15:01] uh uh i don't know what to call it
[15:03] almost an anger and they're ready to go
[15:06] down to go to war with these two and a
[15:08] half tribes because why because there's
[15:11] a principle there's only one provided
[15:13] place of worship they thought they were
[15:15] going to worship there they thought this
[15:16] is terrible this is the division they
[15:18] begin to think about the principle in
[15:20] the place that he should choose and
[15:22] also they they're ready to go to war
[15:25] because if you read with me two reasons
[15:29] and i can't read the whole story but i'm
[15:30] just pulling some things out so be real
[15:32] spiritual minded here and remember the
[15:34] things that you've read in joshua 23 22
[15:37] and verse 17
[15:39] is the iniquity of
[15:40] poor which is that's the reference to
[15:42] bel por too little for us from which we
[15:45] are not cleansed until this day although
[15:47] there was a plague in the congregation
[15:49] of the lord so they refer in their
[15:50] history to the worship of baal poor the
[15:53] influence of balak to bring the people
[15:55] over set up
[15:56] set up seven altars set up all the
[15:59] things just like israel does it and ask
[16:01] them to come over and worship with us
[16:02] and many of israel fell by that because
[16:05] it was the same type of altar it was the
[16:07] same
[16:08] sacrifices it was the same things and
[16:11] that was uh something never forgiven of
[16:13] israel and they lost many many people
[16:15] over it can you say man it just became
[16:17] an influence because somebody decided to
[16:20] go worship at another altar than the god
[16:22] ordained altar
[16:24] so they got mad at it here's the next
[16:26] reference they made to the history verse
[16:27] 20 did not ache and the son of zara
[16:30] committed trespassing the accursed thing
[16:32] and wrath foul on the all of the
[16:34] congregation of israel and that man
[16:36] perished not alone in his iniquity so
[16:38] notice he he and his family
[16:41] is is they perish with his family and we
[16:43] just went through that story for a few
[16:45] weeks ago aiken
[16:46] it's because he decided to do something
[16:48] different than what god had gave the all
[16:51] of the children of israel to do
[16:54] and so they're reacting saying
[16:56] have you guys forgot
[16:58] what happened at belport have you guys
[17:01] forgot what happened with aiken just a
[17:03] few just when we started this journey
[17:06] that haven't you forgot the principle
[17:07] that if you decide to do something
[17:09] opposite of what god's told the rest of
[17:12] the children of israel how you realize
[17:14] how detrimental that is to all of us we
[17:16] could all die over this
[17:18] so that was their first reaction to it
[17:21] and you know what i'm going to
[17:22] compliment them for that
[17:25] it was a quick reaction but i'm going to
[17:27] compliment him for it because
[17:29] we should have our nose smelling for sin
[17:31] right away
[17:33] anything that has a history and it looks
[17:35] like it's something that's going to be
[17:36] wrong
[17:37] we should be sniffing out and saying oh
[17:38] lord what's going on here
[17:40] instead of just letting it come in
[17:43] we should have discernment as christians
[17:46] and we should be willing to say if
[17:47] something's wrong in the right way but
[17:49] we should be willing to say listen you
[17:51] better be careful that something's wrong
[17:52] here
[17:54] because why we have we're not ignorant
[17:56] of satan's devices
[17:59] if we're ignorant of satan's devices
[18:00] then we're being immature christians
[18:02] we're we're letting we're just letting
[18:04] anything come in without i'm going to
[18:06] pray about that i'm going to study the
[18:07] word about that there's something not
[18:09] quite right about that if it turns out
[18:10] to be right then praise the lord if it
[18:12] turns out to be wrong then we've got to
[18:14] have a concern about that
[18:16] and that's all they're doing they're
[18:17] just reacting saying do we want to be
[18:18] like bell poor and aiken when some and
[18:21] it came when someone broke unity and
[18:23] said i'm doing it another way it
[18:26] affected all the rest it also affected
[18:28] their own family so there's there's
[18:31] things that are spoken of us
[18:34] uh just like them let me just say it
[18:36] this way god has given things to us as a
[18:39] as christians
[18:40] as believers i'm going to be free
[18:42] tonight to say not only in the bible but
[18:45] since he sent an end time prophet he has
[18:48] given us absolutes and direction
[18:52] back to the word of god but even how to
[18:54] live in this age
[18:57] and so when he gives those things he
[18:59] speaks them to all of us
[19:02] and they are absolutes
[19:04] and paul said it would be good if we all
[19:07] spake the same thing
[19:10] now tonight these are these are very
[19:13] uh
[19:14] hard things to divide and that's why i
[19:16] want you to listen close if you're
[19:17] interested i want you to listen close
[19:20] paul says
[19:22] there's division among you in the
[19:23] corinthian church there's division among
[19:25] you
[19:26] and he says this shouldn't be
[19:29] he said the desire the goal should we be
[19:31] that as he said in ephesians that we be
[19:33] in unity
[19:35] and that we all speak the same thing
[19:37] that's right now automatically most of
[19:40] us are saying
[19:42] if you can say that
[19:45] all of us are saying
[19:46] well
[19:47] you know
[19:48] that's that's impossible it's because of
[19:50] the way you're looking at it that's
[19:52] right come on now okay
[19:54] and so if the bible says it and that's
[19:56] our goal
[19:57] then whether we see it or not or whether
[19:59] you think it's possible or not you
[20:00] should be believing it saying somehow
[20:02] we've got to understand this and this
[20:04] ought to be our goal that we all begin
[20:06] to speak the same thing amen amen and i
[20:09] personally believe is that whatever god
[20:11] has spoken to us we should make it a
[20:13] goal in our lives and in our families to
[20:15] say lord we may not be there yet but we
[20:18] know that's the goal and that's what we
[20:20] believe can you say man and if he spoke
[20:22] it to all of us then we should be
[20:24] heading in the direction of coming under
[20:26] headship to what god spoke
[20:29] instead of what the family sometimes
[20:31] that we've been reading about saying i
[20:33] know god said that to the whole
[20:35] congregation but i'm going to do it a
[20:37] different way
[20:39] every time they do that we have example
[20:41] after example it hurts that family it
[20:44] hurts that person and it hurts the rest
[20:46] of the congregation
[20:47] now that's things god has spoken just
[20:49] give me a minute i'll talk about
[20:50] diversity of opinions
[20:53] but i'm not talking about i'm talking
[20:55] about what god has said clearly to us
[20:59] we should not be finagling with those
[21:01] things and using the
[21:03] criteria to say well i do my own thing
[21:07] even amongst the body of christ not with
[21:09] something that god has said for all of
[21:11] us to do
[21:14] that principle of the world that let's
[21:16] have diversity of thought and everybody
[21:19] do what they want that's a worldly
[21:21] principle and it's not a godly principle
[21:24] at all
[21:25] and it never works in the body of christ
[21:27] paul said
[21:28] i know of many divisions among you and
[21:30] someone's told me of the house of chloe
[21:32] i've heard about these things the ones
[21:34] of apollos and ones of that and he spoke
[21:36] about a different division there that
[21:37] today but he says these things ought not
[21:39] to be so we shouldn't have this among us
[21:42] and yet we do many times
[21:45] can you say amen
[21:47] so there are things in absolutes god has
[21:50] given us and paul said it would be good
[21:52] if we all spoke the same thing
[21:54] given to us from god's word if one says
[21:56] well i don't really care i'm not doing
[21:58] it that way
[22:00] it's never good for them or it's never
[22:01] good for the rest of the congregation
[22:03] why
[22:03] why is that
[22:05] because that approach is the pride of
[22:06] the world it's not the holy ghost filled
[22:09] body of christ
[22:10] it's not contributing
[22:12] to helping as we're preaching sunday
[22:15] christ to be released the people and the
[22:17] holy ghost to be released to the people
[22:18] to do what he wants to do
[22:21] it's it's squelching the spirit it's
[22:23] quenching the spirit it's restricting
[22:25] christ it's holding it back
[22:29] and it's always done that and so now
[22:31] it's the pride of the world
[22:33] that makes it say that way it's not the
[22:35] holy ghost body of christ it's a
[22:37] self-focused approach of the world and
[22:40] we could agree with me that the world is
[22:42] self-focused
[22:44] the world's approach to everything is
[22:45] very self-focused
[22:47] why because that's that beast nature
[22:51] without a new birth it's just a beach
[22:53] beast nature the interesting thing about
[22:55] it a person can have that beast nature
[22:57] they're so self-focused but at the same
[22:59] time they can be so giving it seems like
[23:02] they can give to the poor they can do
[23:04] this they do that but if they're
[23:05] self-focused they're even doing that
[23:08] to bring attention back to themselves
[23:10] because it's that nature that hasn't
[23:12] been born again and it's very very
[23:15] self-focused
[23:16] as we
[23:17] were studying friday night or listening
[23:19] to the message about calvary and the
[23:20] effects of calvary last friday at
[23:22] communion we learned that one of the
[23:24] effects of calvary is it burns all of
[23:26] the selfishness out of us
[23:28] and it continues to do it throughout our
[23:30] christian walk lord burn out the
[23:32] selfishness within you burn out this
[23:34] self-focused attitude
[23:37] and lord may i become
[23:39] eternal life is living for others you
[23:41] begin all of a sudden to care about the
[23:43] souls of others and life isn't arranged
[23:46] so that everything comes back to being
[23:48] about you
[23:51] praise the lord so now it never works to
[23:53] have a self-focused approach it's not
[23:56] balance the other side of it would be
[23:59] that everybody and just explain that let
[24:01] me just explain this right now so it
[24:03] never works to say okay i'm going to do
[24:05] something completely opposite of what
[24:07] the lord has told us all to do i'm going
[24:09] to do something different and so we know
[24:11] that doesn't work but the other side of
[24:12] it will be that everybody needs to
[24:14] conform to a code
[24:16] without the holy ghost
[24:18] well we're all afraid of that because
[24:19] why is that that's a cult
[24:22] that's cultish
[24:24] so that's the other extreme and brother
[24:26] brahman says the devil is always trying
[24:27] to take us to extremes
[24:29] we don't want extremes we want to
[24:30] balance we want them want the middle of
[24:32] the road
[24:33] a lot of us are scared to the extreme of
[24:35] becoming cultists where everybody
[24:36] conforms to one cold code
[24:39] it's a communistic thing isn't it that's
[24:41] why we hate it so much even some of the
[24:43] world even hates that communistic way is
[24:45] because everybody comes to a certain
[24:47] thing and uh in a certain code and it's
[24:49] very it becomes very cultish without the
[24:52] holy ghost that's what happens is it
[24:54] becomes everybody conforms to a certain
[24:56] code we don't want that either that's a
[24:58] cult but both sides are flawed
[25:02] both sides are flawed the side that
[25:04] makes a code that everybody needs to
[25:07] stand by without the holy ghost is
[25:09] flawed
[25:11] but the other side that says i do my own
[25:13] thing even in the body of christ i do my
[25:15] own thing is flawed as well
[25:18] it's just as fun
[25:21] praise the lord
[25:23] so this altar that they built what
[25:25] purpose did it have why'd they build
[25:27] this beautiful altar that resembled the
[25:29] true altar
[25:30] they even had good intentions and after
[25:32] israel reacted the way they did then all
[25:35] of a sudden these two tunab tribes
[25:37] explained wait a minute wait a minute
[25:39] we're not in rebellion here we're we're
[25:40] not listen hear us out a minute okay
[25:43] you're you're overreacting we're not
[25:45] trying to build an altar here to to uh
[25:47] you know to be in rebellion to the true
[25:50] altar of god here are reasons and i'll
[25:52] tell you if you hear the reasons they
[25:54] are good intentions they are good
[25:55] reasons uh they are good things it it
[25:58] seems like uh and israel was respectful
[26:01] to their reasons
[26:03] both times when they said we want to
[26:05] live this side of jordan we don't want
[26:07] to go in
[26:08] eventually israel said and even moses
[26:10] said all right if that's what you want
[26:11] to do if that's where you want to live
[26:12] you don't want to come into god's
[26:14] promise completely then you go right
[26:16] ahead and do that and that's why you
[26:17] have to be as a christian you have to
[26:18] shake your hands and say all right god
[26:20] bless you my brother
[26:22] speaking on sunday or wednesday about
[26:24] about
[26:25] abraham saying a lot god bless you my
[26:27] brother choose which direction you want
[26:29] to go and i'll go the other direction
[26:31] god bless you god be with you
[26:34] it's respectful
[26:36] god doesn't know what's in the god knows
[26:38] what's in the heart but maybe
[26:40] abraham didn't see what was in the heart
[26:41] where all they'd end up someday and
[26:43] abraham went down there and fought a
[26:44] battle and delivered him one time took
[26:46] him out of captivity that's being a
[26:47] brother as well
[26:49] you know after he delivered a lot like
[26:51] that lot went right back into sodom
[26:53] again
[26:55] his wife and they just they liked
[26:58] the world
[27:00] but the respect of israel here says you
[27:02] want to live there that's fine now
[27:03] here's a respect saying okay now we
[27:04] understand your intentions i'll get to
[27:06] them in a minute now we know that you're
[27:08] not being a rebellious to build another
[27:09] altar to sacrifice or to worship at and
[27:12] okay and that and that'll be fine i've
[27:14] been pondering these scriptures for a
[27:16] week to say but wait a minute is this a
[27:18] good thing there's something so
[27:20] mysterious in these scriptures that i'm
[27:23] going what what's going on here is this
[27:25] a right thing that all of israel
[27:26] accepted an altar being built over there
[27:30] and it's fine because they said it's
[27:31] just going to be an altar of witness
[27:33] so so some of you that are looking at me
[27:35] really strange let's read it so you
[27:37] understand why they built it okay
[27:39] verse 22 verse 21 then the children of
[27:42] reuben and the children of god and the
[27:43] half tribe of manasseh answered and said
[27:45] unto the heads of the thousands the lord
[27:47] god of god is the lord god of gods he
[27:49] knoweth in israel he shall know if it be
[27:51] in rebellion or if in transgression
[27:53] against the lord save us not this day
[27:55] kill us then if we're in rebellion that
[27:57] we have built us an altar to turn from
[27:59] following the lord or it to
[28:01] for if to offer their burnt offering or
[28:04] meat offering or if it to offer peace
[28:06] offerings therein let the lord himself
[28:08] require it and if we have not rather
[28:11] done it for fear of this thing saying in
[28:13] time to come your children might speak
[28:15] unto our children saying what have ye do
[28:18] to do to do with the lord god of israel
[28:20] for the lord hath made jordan a border
[28:23] between us and you you children of
[28:24] reuben and children of god ye have no
[28:26] part in the lord so shall your children
[28:28] make our children cease from fearing the
[28:31] lord therefore he said let us now
[28:32] prepare so first thought is that we're
[28:34] not in rebellion we're doing this not
[28:36] the sacrifice not to worship at this
[28:39] altar
[28:40] but we're doing it as he says in verse
[28:42] 27 here but that it may be a witness
[28:45] between us and you and our generations
[28:47] after us that we might do the service of
[28:49] the lord before him with our burnt
[28:50] offerings so
[28:52] said we're going to do it as a witness
[28:54] we want something that resembles the
[28:56] true altars
[28:57] because we want to do it as a witness
[28:59] it's verse 27. you see that word witness
[29:02] there
[29:03] but that it might be a witness between
[29:04] us you and our generations after so
[29:06] their thought is the generations after
[29:08] us now i'm not against somebody thinking
[29:10] about the generations after us
[29:12] i think that is a good thing
[29:15] but you got to make sure
[29:17] that you're sending the right message to
[29:19] the generation after you that's right
[29:23] so
[29:24] i mean if you want to study this more
[29:25] and look at i just i keep saying as i
[29:28] said it last wednesday night
[29:31] i should go back my notes and find the
[29:32] way i said it but now they're concerned
[29:34] about later on other children
[29:37] speaking against their children that if
[29:40] there's nothing there to resemble the
[29:42] true altar so they wanted it for that
[29:44] purpose but these parents are not
[29:46] concerned at all of their children
[29:48] coming to them asking them someday dad
[29:50] and mom
[29:51] why in the world did we not go into the
[29:54] promised land
[29:56] why did we settle
[29:58] short of the promise
[30:00] and that question from your kids
[30:03] is going to be a lot harder to answer
[30:06] than the one mom dad these kids were
[30:08] making fun of me today they were saying
[30:10] that we weren't part of the lord and
[30:11] part of this whole thing of jehovah god
[30:12] and they were worried about why they're
[30:14] kids making fun of them that way
[30:16] but they but what about the worry that
[30:18] you've established your whole life short
[30:22] of the promise of god
[30:27] hard set of scriptures to divide but
[30:29] that's the only way i can see it because
[30:32] it wasn't a good thing to stop short of
[30:35] the promise of god for them or for their
[30:37] children
[30:39] i'm encouraging you make the priority
[30:41] the promises of god for you and your
[30:43] children
[30:44] fight the battle every day for the
[30:46] promises of god say i don't feel like
[30:48] i'm hard i don't even feel like i have
[30:50] anything brother paul listen keep
[30:53] fighting the battle for the promises of
[30:54] god because they are your promises you
[30:57] just have to fight for them let your
[30:58] children see you fighting for the
[31:00] promises of god whether it be healing or
[31:02] whatever it is let them see you always
[31:05] focus and say i may not want be what i
[31:07] want to be i may not want be what but i
[31:10] i should be but thank god i'm not what i
[31:12] used to be and i'm headed in one
[31:14] direction and that's going through this
[31:15] promised land taking every promise that
[31:17] i can take amen
[31:19] let your children see that of your life
[31:22] and so
[31:23] they had a good thing
[31:26] uh good intentions they had good
[31:28] intentions but they just wanted to build
[31:30] something that resembled the real thing
[31:32] and what appears to be a good thing for
[31:34] the field future for their children may
[31:35] not and the main reason it's a
[31:37] borderline religion to start with it's
[31:40] not living in god's promise that he
[31:42] promised to give them
[31:43] it's the best way that i can bring it is
[31:45] is
[31:45] is that helpful to see it that way is it
[31:48] helpful to your families to see it that
[31:49] way and you're you raising families
[31:52] it is so crucial that we not make a
[31:55] resemblance to the real thing to our
[31:58] kids but we pray for the real thing
[32:01] amen
[32:03] put your seatbelts on because i'm going
[32:04] to say a few uh strong things here at
[32:07] the end
[32:08] and then hopefully
[32:10] lighten it up
[32:12] i know some of you are saying and you
[32:14] haven't said strong things already
[32:18] so verse 24 i want to look at that and
[32:20] if we have not rather done it for the
[32:22] fear of this thing so look at that word
[32:24] the fear of this thing you know what the
[32:26] purpose was why do we we'll make this
[32:29] alter we're gonna build this
[32:30] so it resembles
[32:32] what the true altar is so that later on
[32:34] when we die that our children there they
[32:36] have something to their resemblance and
[32:37] alder and the other children will and so
[32:39] what's the word though it's fear
[32:43] they're doing it out of fear
[32:47] fear of what other children may say
[32:50] that they would be put down because they
[32:52] have nothing to do with their god
[32:54] how is it that they missed that their
[32:55] decision as parents that kept him out of
[32:57] the promised land let me just say it
[32:58] this way in talking on the subject of
[33:01] fear
[33:02] and all of us do it
[33:04] all of us have made decisions
[33:06] based on one thing
[33:08] and that's fear a lot of times with our
[33:10] kids
[33:13] everyone in this room has done it
[33:16] but any decision based in fear and not
[33:19] faith is not good for the future of our
[33:21] children
[33:24] any decision even putting on religion
[33:28] out of fear
[33:30] any decision based in fear and paul was
[33:33] so strong in the bible he says
[33:35] whatsoever is not of faith is sin
[33:39] because there's only faith and fear
[33:42] whatsoever is not of faith is sin
[33:45] we're called as christians to live by
[33:47] faith thus our decisions must be based
[33:50] upon faith and trust in a god that will
[33:53] provide and a god that will give us the
[33:56] answer in a god that will bring it out
[33:58] and sometimes
[33:59] paul i don't hear a word from the lord i
[34:00] don't know i don't know what to do it
[34:02] well that's when you study everything
[34:03] you pray the best you can you look at
[34:05] your motives you measure your modes and
[34:06] you make the best decision that you make
[34:09] and then you have a trust god will watch
[34:11] out for those decisions
[34:13] but when decisions are based solely on
[34:15] fear you're setting yourself up for
[34:17] trouble
[34:18] and you won't see the results of that
[34:20] right now but most times you'll see it
[34:22] in the future
[34:24] can i get an amen i know you're a little
[34:25] tired tonight i can tell
[34:28] it's the long-term effects by making
[34:30] decisions based upon fear
[34:33] so we could talk a lot more about that
[34:35] but don't make decisions based upon fear
[34:38] you want to make decisions based on
[34:39] faith and from everything i can see
[34:41] they're thinking
[34:42] i complement them for thinking of the
[34:45] future there's not too many people who
[34:46] have a multi-generational vision
[34:49] they only think of today
[34:51] and so yeah parents in the world example
[34:53] the world is that you know they're
[34:54] smoking and drinking and partying and
[34:57] and they're doing all these things and
[34:59] and they have no they don't have no care
[35:01] of the effects that's going to bring on
[35:02] the children someday
[35:04] okay they have no regard for it then you
[35:05] sometimes come in the christian realm
[35:07] and people aren't thinking of a
[35:08] multi-generational vision in other words
[35:09] they're thinking only only today that
[35:11] their actions are just about today and
[35:13] so now but there's a tremendous effect
[35:16] not only on our words but mostly our
[35:18] actions that affect the future
[35:21] generations and we have to be praying
[35:23] about that i wouldn't say worried about
[35:25] it
[35:26] don't be worried i would say
[35:29] sensitive about it praying giving our
[35:31] hearts to god saying lord
[35:34] please direct me and direct my actions
[35:37] so that my children are not affected in
[35:39] the wrong way in the future that unless
[35:41] the best impression we can leave
[35:43] i can tell you i i already did some
[35:45] things when my children are young and
[35:47] i'm alright i'm already paying for them
[35:48] let me be the honest one tonight um
[35:52] i'm already trying to regroup on those
[35:54] things so all of us have done it
[35:56] all of us have said something and it's
[35:59] planted certain seeds and now you can
[36:01] see those things pop up in your kids and
[36:03] you're going
[36:05] oh my goodness what have i done
[36:07] i see that same thing coming out of them
[36:11] and if you're going to own up to it
[36:14] like you should you say you know what
[36:16] most of that came from me
[36:19] whatever it is
[36:20] it's better to be humble about it and
[36:22] own up to it
[36:24] get further along in growing with christ
[36:26] if you own up to your you say i i did
[36:29] that i can see where i contributed if
[36:31] not then it contributed to it
[36:34] so any decision based in fear let's
[36:36] let's not make our decisions as families
[36:38] based in fear but let us follow the lord
[36:40] and make them in
[36:41] faith so now let me say this parents
[36:43] don't build your own version of the word
[36:47] that's really what they did
[36:50] they built
[36:51] and it was even more beautiful they
[36:52] built their own altar
[36:54] there was no sacrifice in that altar
[36:56] and it wasn't even the worship at it
[36:58] just something that's just so it
[37:00] resembles
[37:02] we are not called to build our own
[37:04] version of the word for our family
[37:06] that's right
[37:09] i said we're not called to build our own
[37:11] version of the word for our family
[37:14] convenient just for our family just a
[37:16] little more acceptable to the world to
[37:19] to make it easier on our kids
[37:23] or to teach them to just keep a little
[37:25] religion but minimize the battle and the
[37:28] sacrifice that goes with the holy ghost
[37:29] life
[37:31] i think that's leaving a very wrong
[37:33] impression to your children to take out
[37:35] the battle part and take out the
[37:37] sacrifice part and make it convenient to
[37:39] make this holy ghost field life
[37:41] something that's of convenience no
[37:43] i think that we should teach them
[37:44] reality that's unrealistic to teach it
[37:47] that way
[37:48] and and knowing that it's full of the
[37:50] glories of the lord and overcoming and
[37:52] all these other things but still what
[37:54] goes with it is sacrifice and battle and
[37:56] all these other things and we shouldn't
[37:58] say well just it's good enough just to
[38:00] keep a religion no there's sacrifice
[38:02] that you say christ you christ made the
[38:04] sacrifice maybe you say
[38:07] christ made the sacrifice and so now we
[38:09] no longer have to sacrifice that's not a
[38:11] balanced doctrine
[38:13] christ made the complete and full
[38:15] sacrifice for our sin now either some of
[38:18] you are just zoning out or you're really
[38:20] listening intently
[38:23] but this is a point to divide right now
[38:24] because this is a lot of this stuff is
[38:26] being said
[38:28] around the world on the internet it's
[38:29] finding that thing christ is a christ
[38:32] sacrifice is enough for me it's enough
[38:34] for our sin
[38:36] but you cannot say christ did all the
[38:38] sacrificing for me and so i don't have
[38:40] to make any sacrifices that's not
[38:42] scriptural
[38:44] come on because paul said he said i lay
[38:47] down my life paul said i die daily
[38:51] paul said bring the sacrifice of praise
[38:53] paul said our represent our bodies a
[38:57] living sacrifice we don't die physically
[39:00] but a living sacrifice we die daily to
[39:03] our
[39:05] selfishness
[39:06] self i want things to come out my way i
[39:09] want to be right i always have to be
[39:11] right we have to die to that and that's
[39:14] the type of sacrifices we make as a
[39:15] christian and teach our children this is
[39:17] what we do as believers
[39:20] praise the lord so don't get that in
[39:22] balance because a lot of people someone
[39:24] even said me on the internet the other
[39:26] day my wife just repeated she said
[39:28] it's jesus alone that i need for
[39:30] salvation that's exactly right and so
[39:32] that's what they say is that we have
[39:34] jesus alone that's all we need is jesus
[39:36] alone and his sacrifice that's all we
[39:38] need the message is not essential that's
[39:40] false doctrine the message is not
[39:43] essential for salvation
[39:45] christ's sacrifice is essential for
[39:46] salvation but that doesn't make the
[39:48] message not essential it's still
[39:50] essential as well because it's the
[39:51] message of the last days to bring us
[39:53] back to the restored world
[39:54] but people want to throw some something
[39:57] out and say i want to hold it it's a
[39:59] security to them i'm just holding to
[40:00] this this salvation but god as i said in
[40:03] the beginning has called us to more than
[40:04] just salvation amen he's called us to
[40:07] redemption redemption and adoption
[40:10] and so that's a growth in the lord in
[40:12] the land of the holy ghost how many want
[40:13] to grow in the land of the holy ghost
[40:15] amen so this isn't like someone saying
[40:18] salvation is all i need that's saying
[40:20] that's all the further i want to go with
[40:22] god no that's not all the further we
[40:23] want to go we're in the promised land
[40:25] now we're battling it out every day it's
[40:27] the battle of the mind all the time
[40:29] and these are the things to live and
[40:32] teach in front of our children we're not
[40:34] to make this this an easy battle
[40:38] but let them see as my wife gives that
[40:41] testimony sometimes of her mom watching
[40:43] her struggle for years i don't even know
[40:45] if i'm supposed to say this i know i
[40:47] love my mother-in-law
[40:48] and i know she loves me so i don't think
[40:50] she'll mind she struggled with the
[40:52] temper for years and becca watched that
[40:54] for you struggled with the temper for
[40:56] years and but then she watched
[40:58] something happen in her life and she
[41:00] yielded and she watched she
[41:01] overcome that thing
[41:04] and she's seen the distinct chains as
[41:06] she just kept following the lord and
[41:08] kept exposing herself to the word of god
[41:10] and she seen her overcome that thing and
[41:13] she didn't see manifestations of it like
[41:15] she'd seen before
[41:16] something changed her life now to me
[41:19] when your children see you growing like
[41:21] that
[41:23] that's that's the way it needs to be
[41:24] amen praise god
[41:27] amen that speaks volumes to them because
[41:29] that's the land of the holy ghost praise
[41:31] the lord anybody listening here
[41:34] amen so now sacrifice is definitely a
[41:37] part of it paul said present your bodies
[41:39] but he said don't be conformed to the
[41:40] world present your body as a living
[41:42] sacrifice so let me finish up here with
[41:44] some points i want to make to bring more
[41:47] blessed families how many want to see
[41:49] your family blessed whether it's one or
[41:52] whether it's
[41:53] 10 in your family or where's 19 like the
[41:56] duggars
[41:57] i love the duggars 19 and there's more
[41:59] there's more coming with uh with the
[42:01] grandchildren
[42:03] anything that comes in this world that
[42:05] holds up a standard and the whole world
[42:07] gets a seat on on that weekly thing
[42:09] everybody sees those standards of dress
[42:10] and standards of courtship
[42:12] i don't know what all they believe but i
[42:14] just thank the lord for it that's right
[42:16] and i love it you know when they get on
[42:18] these these shows and there's all
[42:21] 19 of them you know and they're smiling
[42:23] and they're happy and and everybody says
[42:25] how can that be nobody can have that
[42:27] many kids and be sane in their minds
[42:31] but they are
[42:34] i i don't know if i could do it
[42:36] but i praise somebody else that can do
[42:38] it
[42:39] because the whole world says that's
[42:40] impossible that's stupid that's weird no
[42:43] it's not
[42:46] how did i get on the duggar family i
[42:48] don't know
[42:49] whatever your family is one in your
[42:51] family you're blessed tonight
[42:54] 19 in your family you're blessed tonight
[42:56] when you're under god's headship and his
[42:58] rulership
[42:59] you're blessed
[43:01] following the word of god in the
[43:02] promised land so here's some points
[43:04] here's some lessons and i try to bring
[43:06] this thing down to practical things i'm
[43:07] certainly not a perfect father dad
[43:09] husband my kids will be the first to
[43:11] tell you i'm not qualified to explore
[43:14] all the things of families i'm just
[43:15] trying to be a pastor and speak the
[43:17] things in the word of god to make our
[43:18] families under this blessing of abraham
[43:20] that all the families of the earth will
[43:22] be blessed
[43:24] amen and i believe you want to see it
[43:26] that way
[43:27] it isn't healthy for our kids to hear us
[43:30] talk about
[43:32] where we all don't see eye to eye
[43:35] let me just word it this way
[43:37] isn't it unhealthy for our kids to hear
[43:39] us talk about where we all in the body
[43:41] christ don't see eye to eye
[43:43] more than we talk about where we do see
[43:45] eye to eye
[43:49] remember i'm preaching to myself now
[43:50] okay
[43:51] if paul says
[43:52] that we all speak the same thing and
[43:54] that's our goal and we're supposed to be
[43:56] headed to that unity why can't our
[43:57] children see that unity
[44:03] often what's talked about
[44:05] in our families is where everybody
[44:09] don't see eye to eye
[44:11] and do things different and we do that's
[44:14] right
[44:15] we do do things different
[44:17] we do have some differences of
[44:20] opinions opinions are like noses
[44:23] everybody has a different one every
[44:24] house has a different shape some are
[44:26] flat some are big
[44:29] some are big when they're born
[44:33] and they they grow into their nose
[44:35] through the years
[44:36] some are tiny some are pointy
[44:40] some are snotty some are you know
[44:43] there's millions of different types of
[44:45] noses like there's millions of different
[44:46] opinions and as i said a few months ago
[44:49] we don't have a right to lift our
[44:51] opinion as being the standard
[44:53] we're supposed to be here lifting the
[44:55] word of god
[44:57] not our opinions
[44:58] we're not the final authority on
[45:00] anything
[45:01] child rearing
[45:02] whatever it is we're not the final
[45:05] authority
[45:07] we're learning
[45:09] we're learning we're growing that's what
[45:11] the body of christ is grow into the
[45:13] unity grow into all things speak the
[45:15] truth and love so we can grow up into
[45:17] him in all things i ask you tonight are
[45:19] you still growing
[45:20] because if you're not growing
[45:21] something's wrong
[45:24] but we speak the truth in love so we can
[45:25] continue to grow
[45:27] isn't it unhealthy for our kids to hear
[45:29] us talk about what we where we don't see
[45:30] eye to eye
[45:32] more than where we do see eye to eye
[45:34] would not that build more trust
[45:36] and respect and unity
[45:39] if we talked about the things that we do
[45:41] see eye to eye on
[45:44] and pray about the rest that we don't
[45:46] but when that's what
[45:48] is heard
[45:50] then it presents for the future a thing
[45:52] that
[45:54] a young heart says wow
[45:57] isn't anybody on the same page
[46:01] everybody's coming to church and
[46:03] everybody's shaking one of those hands
[46:05] and everybody's worshiping the lord
[46:07] together and praise the lord but of all
[46:09] they hear is that we don't see eye to
[46:12] eye
[46:13] then that's really what they conclude
[46:14] it's hard for them to process all that
[46:16] right
[46:18] and i'm not denying the fact that we
[46:19] don't see eye to eye i'm not i'm not
[46:21] putting my head in the sand and
[46:23] pretending that's not there i'm just
[46:25] saying what do we want to talk about
[46:27] mostly i'm wondering if if things could
[46:29] change
[46:30] if we could talk about more
[46:33] where we do
[46:34] find kindred spirits with one another
[46:36] where we do kind of agree
[46:39] and then we could probably build better
[46:42] things to where we could get to the
[46:44] place we could talk about
[46:45] where we don't disagree
[46:47] without it it being
[46:49] detrimental that's right
[46:54] and you can apply this in a family too
[46:57] say for example
[46:58] uh
[47:00] you
[47:00] went to college and you learned
[47:02] administrative skills
[47:04] and leadership skills
[47:06] and so now you talked about that to your
[47:07] kids and i'm using an example that i've
[47:09] never heard in 25 years of pastoring so
[47:11] don't sit there and say he's talking
[47:13] about me it's not true this is i i tried
[47:15] to think so you had all these leadership
[47:17] skills you've studied it all and you can
[47:19] see after a few years of being in my
[47:21] church brother paul does not have very
[47:24] good administrative skills and you tell
[47:26] that to your kid you just said you know
[47:28] he just he's not running things like he
[47:30] could be running him and guess what
[47:33] you're you'd be right
[47:36] you're right
[47:38] i'll be the first to admit it
[47:40] i i have leadership skills and i'm a
[47:43] leader but i don't always
[47:44] administratively do it uh like everybody
[47:47] wants it to be done and i'm not a
[47:49] professional ed i didn't go to school
[47:51] for leadership skills
[47:52] and so but that's the impression that
[47:54] gives i got a question for you
[47:56] if that kid stays in my church
[47:59] now
[48:01] how are they going to trust me
[48:03] in my administrative decisions
[48:10] you see
[48:11] and so and and you know what
[48:14] we could ultimately say here
[48:16] that
[48:17] this isn't based upon professional
[48:19] leadership skills to run a church
[48:22] it's leaning on the holy ghost to lead
[48:23] the church
[48:24] so i don't care what you learned on all
[48:26] the books i read some of the books too
[48:28] okay but when i come here i'm not trying
[48:30] to incorporate all these leadership
[48:32] people get so disappointed i read all
[48:33] these leadership things and we should be
[48:34] doing this and should we do it what we
[48:36] should be doing is praying for the holy
[48:37] ghost to lead us and it's not that we
[48:39] can't have some form and some type of
[48:41] thing but if we get too technical about
[48:44] it everybody's going to get disappointed
[48:46] and what we all need to say is that we
[48:48] don't want another system or another
[48:50] program or another thing that's
[48:51] influenced by the wisdom of the world we
[48:54] need the holy ghost to lead the church
[48:56] we need the holy ghost to lead the
[48:58] pastor we need humility in the pastor we
[49:01] need humility in the people we need
[49:03] people in positions with humility from
[49:06] the pastor all the way down to the
[49:08] janitor amen
[49:09] and that's when it'll work
[49:12] and i'm not saying it hasn't worked i'll
[49:14] tell you every time you have that it
[49:16] does work but you have to keep your
[49:18] humility you have to keep that this
[49:19] isn't about trying to impress anybody
[49:23] can you hear my heart tonight
[49:25] amen what does that say to the next
[49:27] generation if that impresses that mind
[49:29] do you feel the next generation have
[49:31] trust in me or any man for that matter
[49:36] number two is it healthy to teach
[49:37] children
[49:38] unrealistic things about christianity
[49:41] like for example you have to figure it
[49:43] out before you believe it
[49:48] that's not true
[49:49] that's right
[49:51] i think we should teach our children
[49:53] that we pray for revelation
[49:55] understanding all the time because we
[49:56] need that kind of understanding
[49:58] but we should never teach them
[50:00] that you don't have to believe it until
[50:02] you fully can figure it out that's not
[50:04] biblical
[50:06] that's right
[50:07] that may be worldly but that's not
[50:08] biblical
[50:09] and you're you're misleading people if
[50:12] you say things like that
[50:17] it's unhealthy to teach unrealistic
[50:19] things about christianity the baptism of
[50:20] holy ghost that's that's fanatical you
[50:23] don't need to go overboard with it like
[50:24] some people go overboard and just you
[50:26] know
[50:27] we don't need that and we don't need all
[50:28] this screaming and all these
[50:32] just make sure you balance that out by
[50:33] teaching your children that
[50:35] every birth is a mess
[50:39] and if it's not somewhat of a mess then
[50:41] it's kind of a stillborn birth
[50:44] that's what the word of god teaches us
[50:46] so don't eliminate those things
[50:49] teach them there's no battle there's no
[50:50] fight to this it's easy kind of just
[50:52] blend in there's no sacrifices that we
[50:54] we make already read scripture on that
[50:56] and brother brown says how wishy-washy
[50:57] that's too many christians today so
[50:59] soft-soaked and everything until they
[51:00] think all they do is join church or go
[51:02] somewhere put their name on the book or
[51:04] do a little something jump up and down
[51:05] shout or something like that and call
[51:07] that christianity he said let me let me
[51:09] know what let me let you know what
[51:10] christianity is christianity is an
[51:12] everyday
[51:13] rugged life living for god in this
[51:16] present world
[51:18] and that's what we should teach our kids
[51:20] christianity you want to be a christian
[51:22] christianity is a rugged life
[51:26] a rugged everyday rugged life living for
[51:29] god in this present world it's a
[51:31] constant burning of the fire and the
[51:33] love of god in the heart that sets you a
[51:35] fire and puts you out yonder with people
[51:37] making converts to christ
[51:41] because you don't have to mechanically
[51:42] do that if you're on fire for god you're
[51:44] going to draw ones that are hungry for
[51:45] god so it's not if you're trying to make
[51:47] a convert
[51:48] mechanically it's that you're going to
[51:50] draw people and say wow pray i got an
[51:52] open ear here i'm going to witness to
[51:53] him
[51:54] and that brings conference to christ
[51:56] i'm describing by the prophet what
[51:58] christianity is and it's not some
[52:02] easy part that we go to
[52:04] can you say man
[52:06] it's it's not baby setting can you say
[52:08] man it's not this baby hood christianity
[52:12] is a rugged everyday life living for god
[52:15] in this present world
[52:17] amen can i get a louder amen than that
[52:19] amen
[52:20] let's not soft soap christianity to our
[52:22] kids
[52:23] let's not smooth it over and make it a
[52:25] little bit more convenient for them all
[52:28] them that live godly in christ jesus
[52:31] shall
[52:32] suffer persecution oh i gotta shield my
[52:35] kids from all this persecution no let
[52:37] them be a holy ghost-filled christian
[52:39] and with the holy ghost they can
[52:40] withstand the persecution just like paul
[52:43] and the apostles did because it's the
[52:45] same holy ghost that we want in our kids
[52:48] that was in paul and peter that they
[52:50] would be hung if they didn't if they if
[52:52] they denied christ they could get out of
[52:54] being hung and all the other things what
[52:56] got him through the holy ghost
[52:58] you're gonna tell me the same holy ghost
[53:00] in that young person can't stand
[53:01] somebody making fun of them come on now
[53:03] when we got saints of god that had the
[53:05] same holy ghost and stood there and said
[53:08] you can cut my head off if you want to i
[53:10] will not deny jesus christ amen
[53:13] i pledge allegiance to the lamb it's the
[53:16] same holy ghost and it'll get your kid
[53:18] through that public school it'll get
[53:20] your kid through that college
[53:22] that's why we have to pray they become
[53:24] filled with the same holy
[53:26] spirit amen
[53:29] praise be to god that's what it is
[53:32] burning with the fire and the love of
[53:33] god that's christianity a constant
[53:35] burning of the fire and love of god in
[53:37] our hearts it sets you on fire and puts
[53:39] you out yonder
[53:41] with the people making converts to
[53:42] christ
[53:44] we should teach that everybody
[53:46] in the church just needs to live
[53:48] their own life by their own convictions
[53:52] now i know if you have a conviction of
[53:54] the word it's something god gave you
[53:56] that's true
[53:57] but we shouldn't teach the principle
[53:59] that everybody in the church
[54:01] just should live their own life
[54:03] and live by their own convictions
[54:06] it's not biblical
[54:09] never have unity that way
[54:11] shouldn't teach as long as you believe
[54:12] the message you're okay
[54:15] as long as you dress right and wear all
[54:16] the right clothes in the message you're
[54:17] okay
[54:18] that's misleading your kids
[54:20] that's right
[54:21] just because you're going to a message
[54:22] church you're okay and you're going to
[54:23] the rapture that's a deception you're
[54:25] deceiving your kids
[54:26] if you just wear dresses you'll be
[54:27] you'll be fine that's a deception
[54:30] there's so much more to it than that
[54:33] amen
[54:34] shouldn't teach them these things can
[54:36] you say amen
[54:38] and on the other side
[54:40] we shouldn't teach in that we don't have
[54:42] to obey anything
[54:43] that's another authority that tells is
[54:45] telling us what to do that's not
[54:47] scriptural
[54:48] because if you read your bible god
[54:51] allows authorities and he has delegated
[54:54] authorities even worldly bosses and
[54:57] worldly men
[54:58] can be god's delegated authority in your
[55:00] life and you're to bring yourself
[55:02] subject to it unless they tell you to do
[55:04] something that's not in the word you
[55:06] bring your life under that authority
[55:08] you'll teach your kids no nobody tells
[55:10] me what to do no authority i'll leave
[55:11] that to they're leaving job after job
[55:13] every job because they've been taught
[55:14] they don't have to listen to anybody in
[55:16] authority that's right that's not
[55:17] biblical right not at all
[55:20] so from the pastor and from the father
[55:22] from the father the pastor whatever
[55:24] authorities are placed in their life we
[55:25] teach them what we bring our lives under
[55:27] that authority and god will bless us for
[55:29] that
[55:31] we don't teach that we don't have to do
[55:33] that we don't have to be under that or
[55:34] listen to somebody who's telling us what
[55:35] to do
[55:36] we don't teach that if you're tired and
[55:38] you don't feel like it you don't need to
[55:40] make an effort to go to church
[55:43] whether that's taught or caught it's a
[55:45] wrong principle to teach
[55:47] however you feel that's how you base
[55:49] whether you come to church and i don't
[55:50] think that's a good thing to teach
[55:52] if you got a bad spirit
[55:54] i don't want to go because i got a
[55:56] really bad spirit
[55:57] and i it'll affect everybody if i'm
[56:01] i'm saying that okay that's what i did
[56:03] here years ago
[56:04] i did hear that and i've heard it
[56:06] several times through the years
[56:08] i didn't want to come because i'm got
[56:11] such a bad spirit on me that i i just
[56:13] feel like i'm going to affect everybody
[56:15] else and they can have a better service
[56:17] if i'm not there
[56:18] no if you got a bad spirit
[56:21] come on and we'll
[56:23] take care of you
[56:26] that's right you know i'm not saying
[56:28] this to down
[56:29] anybody i'm saying this in relation to
[56:32] blessed families i'm talking about
[56:34] tonight i'm talking about a
[56:35] multi-generational
[56:37] generation coming in the future
[56:38] multi-generational uh vision
[56:41] that these things that are not so much
[56:43] taught but caught will be carried on and
[56:46] sometimes in more extremes in our
[56:47] children
[56:50] i think we should use this text tonight
[56:52] as i close to take a good look at the
[56:54] position that these tribes took and the
[56:56] long-term effects that it had on their
[56:58] families
[56:59] i think it's wonderful to make the
[57:01] promise of god
[57:03] the center of our family's life
[57:05] amen that's good i think that's what we
[57:07] should do not other things but the
[57:09] promise of god not money and not careers
[57:12] do all that but let them kids know that
[57:14] the family know the center of our life
[57:16] is christ the word
[57:18] everything revolves around that and his
[57:20] promises and we want to live in and
[57:22] fight for those promises
[57:24] amen and and to leave the impression and
[57:27] teach them that having the true baptism
[57:29] of the holy ghost and growing into the
[57:31] unity of the faith with the body is the
[57:34] most important thing in life everything
[57:36] else is secondary
[57:38] if you think i'm a weirdo tonight then
[57:40] that's fine you have a right to your
[57:41] opinion but i think for christian
[57:43] families
[57:44] this should be the priority
[57:47] this should be the priority
[57:49] growing into the unity of the faith with
[57:50] the rest of the body is the most
[57:52] important thing in life
[57:55] everything else is secondary to that
[58:01] that we're not a child-centered family
[58:07] how many's ever met a family that's
[58:08] child-centered something that child can
[58:11] be two years old
[58:13] and life's decisions always made in
[58:16] relation to that two-year-old
[58:18] that's not good
[58:19] it's not so good
[58:23] or if it's not a two-year they get to be
[58:24] teenagers and they're the cat's meow
[58:27] that's them that's it and so everything
[58:28] revolves around
[58:30] life
[58:31] it's a teenager centered family
[58:33] and the teenagers pick up on that after
[58:35] a while
[58:36] no in humility
[58:38] we teach them this isn't centered around
[58:41] you
[58:41] this isn't centered around me it's
[58:44] sitting around christ the word
[58:46] amen and that's the influence of our
[58:47] decisions that's the main hub that turns
[58:50] everything in this family
[58:53] not mom's emotions or not dad's emotions
[58:56] or not that teenager's emotions
[58:58] sometimes emotions can be the center of
[59:01] the family
[59:03] and it's controlling everything that
[59:05] happens
[59:06] by the emotions up and down
[59:09] and sometimes men's emotions go up and
[59:11] down but not as often as women's
[59:13] emotions go up
[59:15] depending on a lot of factors but
[59:19] teenage girls and teenage boys i never
[59:22] thought that would happen to me
[59:24] i thought it was going to be girls but
[59:26] man since they're not here tonight
[59:28] they're on the way to tennessee with the
[59:30] townsends for the weekend and i can say
[59:32] i never discovered that boys teenage
[59:35] boys can be just as emotional sometimes
[59:38] as girls
[59:40] isn't that terrible to say when they're
[59:42] not here it's terrible
[59:45] and they're you know they're growing out
[59:46] of some of that but
[59:49] you don't
[59:50] rearrange your whole life
[59:53] just to save their emotions
[59:55] you know brother eugene told me
[59:56] something the other night
[59:58] and he says
[59:59] because of my nature he says i bucked
[1:00:02] against my dad when i was young in a lot
[1:00:03] of ways but he says my dad was used to
[1:00:06] teach me that you can't have an
[1:00:07] emotionally driven life because he said
[1:00:10] i would lean that way
[1:00:11] he said i didn't realize that 12 years
[1:00:13] old so one of the first lessons he said
[1:00:15] they had a bunch of dogs on the farm and
[1:00:16] there was this one dog that was
[1:00:17] influencing the other dogs and being a
[1:00:20] being a bad influence on the other ones
[1:00:22] it was it was a you know just just
[1:00:24] and after a few months eugene knew it
[1:00:26] he's 12 years old his dad could brought
[1:00:27] him in and talk to him you see what that
[1:00:28] dog's doing he said yeah dad i see it
[1:00:31] he said you see how this is happening i
[1:00:33] see it i see he said you know what's
[1:00:35] going to happen though you said no
[1:00:36] he said that dog's got to go
[1:00:39] that dog's going to go
[1:00:41] he said yeah the dog's gotta go he said
[1:00:42] well you go get the gun and you shoot
[1:00:44] him
[1:00:46] that was a different story
[1:00:48] because he loved that dog
[1:00:51] and so he did it he says i cried the
[1:00:53] whole time he said i took that gun he
[1:00:56] said i had to shoot that dog's the last
[1:00:58] thing in the world i wanted to have to
[1:00:59] do
[1:01:00] he said but you know 20 30 years later
[1:01:02] he realized his dad was teaching him
[1:01:04] that life isn't always controlled by
[1:01:06] emotions
[1:01:08] sometimes you got to do what you got to
[1:01:09] do
[1:01:11] and those little lessons sometimes that
[1:01:12] god uses in our life to teach us
[1:01:15] don't get so unemotional and so detached
[1:01:18] that you have no feeling for anybody
[1:01:21] and you're carrying a gun around
[1:01:25] please don't do that
[1:01:28] the bible says to be tenderly
[1:01:29] affectionate towards one another
[1:01:32] just keep a balance
[1:01:34] but we don't want a child centered life
[1:01:37] we don't want a home that's centered on
[1:01:39] money we don't want a home that's
[1:01:41] centered on
[1:01:42] some other objective we want a
[1:01:43] christ-centered home
[1:01:46] that's the hub
[1:01:47] that's what everybody looks to that's
[1:01:48] what influences the decisions you make
[1:01:51] daddy's went to prayer about things
[1:01:54] daddy is is consulting the lord and the
[1:01:56] word about his decision that he has to
[1:01:58] make no decisions are made too hastily
[1:02:01] or too quickly without prayer
[1:02:03] without considering the lord without
[1:02:05] even calling some other older people to
[1:02:07] get some input
[1:02:09] a lot of people don't believe in that
[1:02:10] today i believe it is there's big
[1:02:11] decisions in our lives i'm going to call
[1:02:13] and ask some other older brothers and
[1:02:15] sisters and say what do you think it met
[1:02:17] a few months ago with all the older ones
[1:02:19] took them out to dinner in the church
[1:02:21] and i said to them hey
[1:02:22] how am i doing what's my report card is
[1:02:24] there anything that you can see that you
[1:02:26] want to give input on
[1:02:27] why because they're the elders of the
[1:02:29] gray hair of our church
[1:02:31] i'm i'm still very young but i was i
[1:02:34] want to submit my why are you laughing
[1:02:36] jared
[1:02:39] i want to submit myself to the older
[1:02:41] ones like that to their counsel i don't
[1:02:43] want to make too hasty of decisions
[1:02:45] which i have made
[1:02:46] without input so what's my report card
[1:02:48] how am i doing as a pastor how's the
[1:02:50] church doing what do you think could be
[1:02:52] changed what would you do
[1:02:53] that's submission
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:57] i can i can say that the lord would
[1:02:58] speak through people like that
[1:03:00] now some people think no the lord can't
[1:03:02] speak through anybody there i get it
[1:03:04] directly from god i can tell you the
[1:03:06] lord can speak through other members of
[1:03:08] the body of christ if we'll be humble
[1:03:10] about it we can learn and be teachable
[1:03:13] and learn things from other people but
[1:03:15] god would speak through i've taken too
[1:03:16] long tonight let's stand together if you
[1:03:18] would
[1:03:20] blessed families
[1:03:23] praise the lord
[1:03:25] heavy heavy tonight
[1:03:27] i believe the next one subject we got
[1:03:29] coming up the next blessed family
[1:03:31] subject is
[1:03:33] going to be a bit lighter
[1:03:36] so praise the lord for that
[1:03:38] but we could all examine our lives
[1:03:40] tonight we could all say lord help me to
[1:03:42] be
[1:03:43] a better
[1:03:45] follower of christ in the sense that
[1:03:48] we don't want to make our own little
[1:03:50] concoction of a new altar in our lives
[1:03:52] but we want to worship at the true altar
[1:03:55] of god
[1:03:56] and i had it in here but i i didn't i
[1:03:58] didn't find it in my notes but i had
[1:03:59] sent something in there is that
[1:04:01] we we don't want to present something
[1:04:03] that resembles
[1:04:05] the things of the message and things of
[1:04:06] god we want our children to have the
[1:04:08] real thing that's right and often we try
[1:04:11] to get something that resembles it but
[1:04:12] we want them to have the reality of this
[1:04:15] person of jesus christ we want that in
[1:04:18] our lives father we thank you tonight
[1:04:20] we pray that you will anoint our words
[1:04:23] as they go
[1:04:25] and
[1:04:26] the examples and the the heart lord and
[1:04:29] my motive i pray that you just anoint
[1:04:31] that to the people that they could
[1:04:33] in the coming months lord changes could
[1:04:35] be made by the holy ghost
[1:04:38] and that we could be as paul who said
[1:04:40] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:04:41] spirit
[1:04:43] with lowliness of mind loneliness and
[1:04:45] humility
[1:04:46] contriteness and brokenness
[1:04:49] lord that you would continue to work
[1:04:50] through those channels and those things
[1:04:52] that we could learn to be a people
[1:04:56] that really are inherent in your
[1:04:57] promises father
[1:05:00] we thank you that you can speak to us
[1:05:01] this way
[1:05:03] lord and
[1:05:04] we pray that you will bring the fruit
[1:05:07] in our lives
[1:05:09] of your word we pray if anything i said
[1:05:11] lord has been offensive or
[1:05:13] something out of place
[1:05:15] we ask now for your forgiveness
[1:05:18] we don't intend that lord but
[1:05:19] nevertheless if we have
[1:05:21] we ask you to forgive us
[1:05:24] we just pause a minute to ask you as the
[1:05:26] saints tonight how many would raise your
[1:05:28] hand in response
[1:05:29] may the lord just give me
[1:05:31] the wisdom
[1:05:33] to be able to be the christian that i
[1:05:35] should be and also to lead my family and
[1:05:38] be an influence on my family and the
[1:05:39] church that i want to be
