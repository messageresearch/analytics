[0:11] we'll be seated but romans 3 23
[0:15] uh today and it's good to be back
[0:18] and
[0:19] um at least there's people that i know
[0:21] amen
[0:23] praise the lord that's always good
[0:26] when you go to unfamiliar churches then
[0:28] you're kind of feeling your way a little
[0:29] bit
[0:30] uh just see how it's gonna go but
[0:33] uh
[0:34] it's good and i
[0:35] we've had a lot of visiting ministers
[0:37] lately so i haven't preached very much
[0:39] this month so
[0:40] just a little nervous and i don't
[0:42] usually get that way so but i know that
[0:45] god has spoken
[0:48] and given me this thought and so
[0:50] be prepared to receive him
[0:53] amen praise the lord
[0:55] so let's let's read romans 3
[0:58] 23
[1:00] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:02] the glory of god
[1:05] i'll read the rest after we pray for all
[1:08] have sinned that comes short of the
[1:09] glory of god
[1:11] who are we then
[1:13] we're nothing amen
[1:16] lord jesus we just love you and we
[1:18] praise you we thank you god for the word
[1:20] of god
[1:22] we thank you that
[1:23] if it was not for you we would not be
[1:25] here
[1:26] if we were not predestinated by your
[1:28] foreknowledge we would not be here
[1:30] god
[1:31] you allowed us to make the choice lord
[1:34] and god i'm just grateful for that lord
[1:36] god how
[1:38] how
[1:39] some of us were raised in in homes lord
[1:42] that that exalted you others were not
[1:45] but i say thank you lord for getting
[1:47] your seeds watered and into your life
[1:50] lord praise your mighty name thank you
[1:52] lord that there's nothing impossible to
[1:55] you lord and i say thank you so much
[1:57] lord in the name of jesus christ we pray
[2:00] amen praise the lord you may be seated
[2:04] i was
[2:06] it's not original to me but i uh i heard
[2:10] a testimony one time that somebody was
[2:12] had a burden for souls and so he started
[2:15] praying for all those that crossed a
[2:17] certain bridge by his house
[2:19] and then he just went on from there so i
[2:22] just took it i said lord and i prayed
[2:24] all the time i said lord
[2:25] anybody who walks on our parking lot at
[2:27] church who turns around in the parking
[2:29] lot who trespasses or breaks bottles
[2:34] i claim their souls they're going to be
[2:36] saved sanctified and filled with the
[2:37] spirit
[2:40] and so we had a sister
[2:42] move in from alaska and she has two
[2:44] girls and
[2:45] the one comes to church all the time
[2:48] and the other is uh is transgender
[2:51] and
[2:52] she has
[2:54] a yellow mohawk
[2:55] and she has metal all over her face
[2:58] and it just
[3:00] she came down with them and she sat in
[3:02] the parking lot
[3:03] and i was like praise the lord amen
[3:06] she's coming hallelujah
[3:08] and so my wife after charity she went
[3:10] out afterwards and uh and seen her out
[3:13] there went over there hi god bless you
[3:15] how are you and she had the nicest
[3:17] spirit but she doesn't realize that
[3:18] she's she's already under the authority
[3:21] of my prayer amen
[3:24] and so that's encouraging isn't it
[3:26] hallelujah and so i god has blessed me
[3:30] because of the work i did i just retired
[3:32] a couple years ago from the fire
[3:33] department so you know
[3:36] we're not in la or uh or a columbus but
[3:39] we do run a lot of calls and see a lot
[3:41] of things and you see a lot of metal in
[3:44] people's faces and tattoos and you know
[3:46] their whole head's tattooed and they got
[3:49] things everywhere and it's like man
[3:51] that's gotta hurt
[3:54] amen
[3:55] but
[3:56] but it's like you know i just treat them
[3:58] like they they just have skin
[4:01] because and that's what's missing people
[4:04] people
[4:05] they need to be treated like human
[4:07] beings
[4:08] and uh and not like oddities
[4:12] or or or objects of disdain but but i
[4:16] was working on a a guy who got in a
[4:18] fight he was drunk of course and got his
[4:20] arm broken by bat and i'm just treating
[4:23] him like a human and he uh
[4:25] he's going you're such a nice white man
[4:30] and he's just said it over and over
[4:31] you're such a nice white i said i got it
[4:34] i said i thank you but i got it okay
[4:37] because you can't deal with drunk people
[4:39] amen
[4:40] so anyway but but i tell you what it's
[4:44] uh
[4:45] it's uh and i'm gonna
[4:47] talk about several things the lord
[4:48] willing tonight but
[4:51] but i have a strange title today
[4:54] it's all about the mail
[4:56] not
[4:57] the letters but the m-a-l-e it's all
[5:00] about the mail
[5:03] praise god the brother should have said
[5:05] yes
[5:07] amen don't be afraid
[5:10] amen so it's all about the mail and
[5:14] you're going to see where we're going
[5:15] with this today
[5:16] uh because without the mail
[5:18] there's no birth
[5:20] amen i know that satan's eating it has
[5:23] manipulated all that but to have a real
[5:26] birth with a real nurturing relationship
[5:29] it has to be about him amen
[5:32] and so i'm going to read
[5:34] romans 3 23-26 in the amplified
[5:38] since all have sinned and are falling
[5:41] short of the honor and the glory which
[5:43] god bestows and receives
[5:45] all are justified and made up right
[5:49] and in right standing with god freely
[5:53] and gratuitously by his grace his
[5:56] unmerited favor and mercy
[5:59] through the redemption which is provided
[6:02] in christ jesus so
[6:04] there's only mercy and redemption in the
[6:06] mail
[6:07] and we're going to see that
[6:09] and what i like is what was the
[6:11] headstone crying when it came down
[6:16] i believe a prophet i believe a prophet
[6:18] i believe the seven seals are old but i
[6:20] no
[6:21] grace
[6:22] grace grace that's what was being
[6:25] shouted as the headstone was coming down
[6:28] and where was that headstone coming down
[6:30] to to the shoulders of his people the
[6:34] government amen that's you down to the
[6:36] shoulders of his people and so you have
[6:39] a mating amen of god himself and humans
[6:44] amen and so today
[6:47] you are a super race
[6:49] amen nothing is too hard for god through
[6:52] you and so these are the things god is
[6:55] the god of the impossible
[6:58] amen and so there's nothing too
[7:00] difficult for him we just can't say when
[7:03] it's going to happen we can't put a
[7:05] timeline but it's already done
[7:08] everything's already finished hallelujah
[7:11] and so
[7:12] in verse
[7:13] 25
[7:15] who whom god put forward before the eyes
[7:18] of all amen they all seen him they all
[7:22] knew what he was like they all seen paul
[7:24] and the apostles and the converts
[7:26] as they he put him forward before all of
[7:29] our eyes as a mercy seat and a
[7:31] propitiation
[7:33] by his blood
[7:35] the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice
[7:39] of atonement at one moment
[7:42] and reconciliation i love that
[7:45] to be received through faith
[7:48] this was to show god's righteousness
[7:51] because in his divine forbearance his
[7:54] long suffering he had passed over and
[7:58] ignored former sins without punishment
[8:02] oh tonight you're going to hear
[8:04] some of my testimony and and i did i
[8:07] think actually the first time i've seen
[8:09] brother paul and sharon and
[8:11] and mom wherever she's at or if she's
[8:13] not here but uh was in 84 at cloverdale
[8:16] at their camp and you were singing
[8:19] so 1984. uh but then uh you know from
[8:22] there we went up to i think their first
[8:24] winter retreat and i do remember that we
[8:27] had hot dogs a lot
[8:30] that's easy amen but it was like
[8:33] i mean in my mind it was hot dogs for
[8:35] every meal but it was probably amen
[8:38] so but
[8:43] this was to show god's righteousness
[8:46] because in his divine forbearance he had
[8:48] passed over and ignored sins without
[8:50] punishment
[8:52] oh
[8:54] the sins the unbelief that we went
[8:57] through
[9:01] it's always it's always there that
[9:03] picture is always there
[9:08] you have to live with that
[9:09] and so don't think oh they got to go out
[9:12] into the world and i didn't it's like
[9:14] don't ever think that
[9:16] because you relive the devil makes sure
[9:18] you relive those all the time and you're
[9:20] always the bible says casting down
[9:22] imagination casting down imagination
[9:24] and so
[9:25] in verse 26 it was to demonstrate and to
[9:29] prove at the at the present time and i
[9:32] like this in the now
[9:34] season so jesus christ the same
[9:37] yesterday today and forever in the now
[9:39] season
[9:40] that he himself is righteous and that he
[9:43] justifies and accepts as righteous him
[9:48] who has true faith in jesus oh i did i
[9:52] love that passage in the amplified
[9:54] amen we're in the now season
[9:58] and and we are in the time where we are
[10:00] beginning to manifest
[10:03] the male amen because when a woman is is
[10:07] married and she and and she begins to to
[10:10] to be pregnant that you
[10:15] most women know when they're pregnant
[10:18] right
[10:19] i've been on calls at work where they
[10:21] said they didn't know
[10:23] and you're wondering how that happens
[10:24] but i i mean you've got to believe them
[10:26] but
[10:31] but you show right
[10:34] and and if you're showing then then you
[10:38] know usually the men wait till you're
[10:39] far enough along that you don't offend
[10:42] somebody by accident
[10:44] say oh you're pregnant
[10:46] no
[10:49] but
[10:51] but we begin to show when when when the
[10:54] seed has been planted and it begins to
[10:56] grow we we show amen and and so that's
[10:58] how people know we are christians we
[11:00] don't even have to say anything
[11:03] but people know we're different
[11:05] they're just something they go there
[11:06] just something about you they're just
[11:08] something about your spirit you're just
[11:10] it's more than just being nice praise
[11:13] the lord and so
[11:15] i'm putting this all on him this morning
[11:17] because that's where it should be and so
[11:20] this we see all the way back in the old
[11:22] testament it was an innocent lamb
[11:25] for the guilty follower of god
[11:28] in in the garden actually when they came
[11:31] out of the garden it was an innocent
[11:32] lamb to cover and that was by revelation
[11:36] hallelujah and so that revelation had to
[11:39] carry through to the time of jesus
[11:42] he was an innocent lamb to cover and to
[11:45] take away and to bring atonement for all
[11:48] the sins of the people and in our day
[11:50] it's right there again it's that bloody
[11:53] fresh word of god amen that is that is
[11:56] that is revealed to you by the holy
[11:58] spirit by the life of the lamb amen how
[12:01] can we get we can't get away from that
[12:04] it has to be the male
[12:06] amen
[12:07] hallelujah so i kind of like that the
[12:10] principle is the innocent for the guilty
[12:13] why did god send a prophet
[12:15] not so we could
[12:17] attain big old brains right
[12:21] i know some people think that's what the
[12:23] message is and you almost have to have a
[12:25] man on each side of the minister to hold
[12:27] his brain up
[12:30] but we're not here for that
[12:32] we're see the most revelated who think
[12:35] they're revelated should be the greatest
[12:37] servant of all
[12:39] amen and so you know all those things
[12:42] are scarecrows and so as our brother
[12:44] said i mean there's going to be things
[12:46] that happen in church well this sister
[12:48] this brother it's like you know what
[12:50] what is that to me
[12:51] follow thou be amen praise the lord it's
[12:54] like you know we're in the time to grow
[12:57] up
[12:58] amen we need to get
[13:00] a spine
[13:04] some of the things from my work
[13:07] you know you got to grow up
[13:09] amen and so but god will do that and so
[13:13] the principle is the innocent for the
[13:14] guilty and that was all of us and if
[13:17] there's anybody here who has not made
[13:19] that commitment you need that you need
[13:22] him because he is he will be your
[13:25] husband and you are the wife amen and as
[13:28] the wife you can relax under his
[13:31] leadership and and because to me he's
[13:34] the god of the impossible he can do
[13:36] anything he wants he can save anybody he
[13:38] wants he can he can heal anybody he
[13:41] wants it's all
[13:43] in our faith in him because he's already
[13:45] he's already did it and so it was the
[13:47] blood of the male lamb that could only
[13:50] cover sin that's the only thing
[13:53] and it's still
[13:54] the only thing that will cover sin and
[13:56] that's what made the comer justified
[14:00] just as if they never done it
[14:02] amen and that's why we take communion
[14:05] because we have to look into the mirror
[14:07] of god's word and we we go over our life
[14:10] by the word and then we empty out of
[14:13] everything and repent so we're justified
[14:16] oh hallelujah people get oh we're having
[14:19] commune again
[14:21] a potluck again
[14:23] sometimes as a pastor you just
[14:26] it is
[14:28] i don't know you know how you get
[14:30] sometimes
[14:31] it's like
[14:33] you just want to say something
[14:35] but you know what we were we were there
[14:37] before so you can't you know people are
[14:40] only growing into into the likeness of
[14:43] god and they have to come the way the
[14:46] same way we did amen
[14:48] and so
[14:49] that blood of the male is the covering
[14:52] and and the passover lamb that they
[14:53] would use they would keep it up for uh
[14:56] 14 days and it was perfect it had to be
[14:58] perfect and and like pilate says i find
[15:01] no fault in jesus he had to testify that
[15:04] he was prophesying that but i like this
[15:07] is that this 14th day of keeping this
[15:10] slam up it covered two sabbaths brother
[15:13] brown said one for the jews and one for
[15:16] the gentiles he's the same yesterday
[15:18] today and forever amen and so the power
[15:21] of the word is still here
[15:23] it is for the bride the revival is the
[15:26] word of god
[15:28] because the holy spirit's there you
[15:30] can't have a word revival without the
[15:32] holy ghost in you because as the word
[15:35] revival comes your whole day begins it
[15:38] starts with a praise in your heart when
[15:40] you get up when i wake up one eye opens
[15:43] and and there's there's always something
[15:45] amen it's i'm bound for the promised
[15:48] land or i'm doing something i'm singing
[15:50] and i get up and of course you gotta
[15:52] have coffee
[15:53] and then i go do my prayer time my bible
[15:55] reading in prayer time but see it is
[15:58] that passover lamb was not only for the
[16:00] jews but also of the gentiles and so we
[16:04] today must completely in a chaotic uh a
[16:08] world that we live we have to completely
[16:11] rely on jesus christ the lamb slain for
[16:15] us amen you have to this is not an
[16:18] option you have to receive that lamb
[16:21] that bloody lamb because theology won't
[16:24] get you there amen it has to be jesus
[16:28] christ the same yesterday today and
[16:29] forever and so it's all about the life
[16:32] of that male that takes our sin away
[16:36] because doctrine doesn't do anything
[16:39] amen your church it's good to go to
[16:42] church but your church really doesn't do
[16:44] anything this is about you
[16:46] amen coming under uh the the leadership
[16:50] of the holy ghost you become desperate
[16:53] for god you repent you get baptized and
[16:56] then you know that he will give you the
[16:59] holy spirit
[17:00] amen
[17:02] i hope you realize there's in the word
[17:04] there's no option you have to receive
[17:07] the holy ghost
[17:10] there's there's no option
[17:13] you have to receive the mail
[17:16] amen and so
[17:18] if you're seeking for him he is there
[17:21] and he will fill you with the spirit
[17:23] amen hallelujah
[17:26] praise the lord jesus and you know what
[17:29] things just start falling away
[17:32] the the things you used to do it's like
[17:34] well i didn't have to quit any of that
[17:36] it just it just it's like man i don't
[17:39] have that attitude i don't have this
[17:41] issue anymore and and i tell you what
[17:44] god is the god of reality and in our day
[17:47] the the evil is so prevalent and it's
[17:50] because the media is so prevalent we
[17:52] have so many ways to to receive unbelief
[17:56] right
[17:57] and so but the thing of it is like our
[17:59] brother said he's still greater the
[18:01] standard is high it's up there you got
[18:03] to use it amen because when the enemy
[18:06] comes in like a flood you have to raise
[18:08] the standard and and especially with
[18:10] young people and the older ones it's
[18:12] like oh brother there's so many thoughts
[18:15] going through my head all day long
[18:18] how can that how can i be a christian
[18:21] i said you've repented right and and you
[18:23] love god with all your heart and you
[18:25] love his word and you want to serve him
[18:27] don't you well yeah
[18:29] well get used to it
[18:33] get used to it
[18:35] when we're out
[18:36] on the job
[18:38] i mean that's all they talk the guys all
[18:40] they do is talk about women's body and
[18:42] sex all day
[18:45] all day long
[18:49] they're good people obviously because
[18:51] they like to help and and they do some
[18:53] great things but can you imagine
[18:56] being around that all
[18:58] 24 hour shifts that's all they talk
[19:00] about
[19:02] and so
[19:04] guess what guess what goes through my
[19:06] head born again believer
[19:09] all those words all those thoughts
[19:12] but see i've been with the mail
[19:17] amen my husband he looks out for me and
[19:20] he never fails me
[19:22] and so what what do i do
[19:26] i'm saying it's not me in the name of
[19:28] jesus that's not me i'm walking around
[19:30] saying it out loud simon it's not me
[19:34] amen casting down imagining that's an
[19:36] imagination that's about but they said
[19:39] that people say oh but it's so detailed
[19:42] how could it not be me i say the devil
[19:44] has kept notes on you from the time you
[19:47] broke the womb
[19:50] he knows you better than you know
[19:52] yourself when you come into a situation
[19:54] you watch it all of a sudden all those
[19:57] things that he knows that you can be
[20:00] tempted by he will bring those out but
[20:02] see you've been with the mail and just
[20:06] because the thoughts are there you
[20:08] kicking them out does not mean you're an
[20:11] unbeliever amen it means you're a
[20:13] christian
[20:15] because now you care about those things
[20:18] and you're now you're just i mean when i
[20:20] come home from work and the other
[20:21] brothers you come home from work and
[20:23] you're exhausted
[20:25] physically because you're you're casting
[20:27] down and casting down amen
[20:29] hallelujah but you are
[20:34] saved
[20:35] sanctified filled with the holy ghost
[20:37] amen and so
[20:39] see it's the male who takes it away not
[20:42] the doctrine and not the female the
[20:45] church the female does not take away
[20:48] your sin just coming to church means
[20:50] that you can set in church for two hours
[20:53] that's all it means just because you
[20:55] have long dresses and long hair just
[20:57] means that you can you can
[20:59] copy somebody
[21:00] amen you men uh just because you do
[21:04] things or don't do things that doesn't
[21:06] mean anything
[21:07] any legalist can do that
[21:10] praise the lord
[21:12] amen that's why i tell the people don't
[21:14] be a hypocrite come like you are i mean
[21:18] i want them to respect
[21:20] the house of god right but if you
[21:23] usually have purple hair come in purple
[21:25] hair
[21:27] because if we don't preach a living
[21:29] gospel then then what good are we anyway
[21:33] well we're not here to uh to have a
[21:35] group of people enjoy one another we're
[21:38] here to let the male impregnate if i can
[21:41] use that word the holy ghost
[21:45] amen
[21:46] praise the lord we that was always my
[21:48] joke is like i don't care if they have a
[21:50] mohawk and and purple hair well one day
[21:53] i come in and my song leader is really
[21:55] excited he goes guess what
[21:58] he goes there's a there's a young guy
[22:00] and his wife here he has purple hair and
[22:02] a mohawk
[22:06] so
[22:07] just think about what you're saying amen
[22:10] before you say it because you're a
[22:12] creator amen and so but they they stayed
[22:15] they enjoyed it they came to the potluck
[22:17] it's like praise god amen so i it you
[22:20] know uh i like that when complete
[22:23] unbelievers come in
[22:25] praise the lord and so
[22:27] since christ the male is the word
[22:30] then
[22:32] what is he he's both spirit and written
[22:34] word
[22:36] and so both of them have to go together
[22:38] the the husband and the wife go together
[22:40] hallelujah the bride and the bridegroom
[22:42] the spirit and the word you cannot you
[22:45] you cannot separate those though
[22:47] denominational spirits try
[22:50] right they try to be really good uh
[22:53] conservative fundamentalist or they try
[22:55] to be really good charismatic say amen
[22:59] hallelujah but see you can't do that
[23:02] because the husband is everything not
[23:05] just parts
[23:06] and and we could go off on marriage
[23:08] right now amen
[23:10] hallelujah but we won't we'll try to
[23:11] stay away from that but
[23:14] we know that he is both the written and
[23:16] the spirit form
[23:17] and that is the reason that god restored
[23:20] christ in this day
[23:23] because you and i had to have a vision
[23:26] of a complete husband and a real
[23:28] relationship not only for our soul
[23:31] salvation but for marriage amen and so
[23:35] the it's all about the male and in the
[23:37] marriage
[23:38] amen we put a lot of burden on the women
[23:40] but it's not really about them it's
[23:43] about the mail
[23:46] because the male
[23:48] has the responsibility for everything
[23:50] not the female
[23:52] amen
[23:53] and so
[23:54] uh
[23:55] it's god family and yourself so your
[23:58] fishing hunting skiing jet skiing is
[24:00] down here
[24:04] god's number one and so
[24:06] you now have the responsibility to
[24:09] to guard the family what comes into the
[24:11] home uh in in media and all those things
[24:14] it's all about you and now you have to
[24:16] be the spiritual leader you can't rely
[24:18] on your wife to be the spiritual leader
[24:21] because that's not gonna work you it's
[24:24] all about you being the guardian and the
[24:27] spiritual leader of that home and and
[24:29] what will happen is your wife will begin
[24:31] to revere you because it's all about you
[24:35] because you treat her as a sister and as
[24:38] somebody who is a partner in the grace
[24:41] of god with you and your kids won't hate
[24:44] you
[24:44] amen i told somebody the other day i
[24:46] said i'm pretty fortunate because my
[24:47] kids uh they still like me
[24:50] and the guy was a he's a firefighter
[24:53] he's not a christian he goes oh rich he
[24:55] goes who wouldn't like you
[24:57] well
[24:58] there's a list
[25:01] there's a list and
[25:04] and you don't get away from the people
[25:05] that hated your parents right
[25:08] because then they just they just throw
[25:09] it on you and so that adds to it more
[25:11] amen
[25:12] but i wouldn't have it any other way
[25:14] psalm 107 20 it says
[25:18] he sent his word and healed them and
[25:20] delivered them from their destructions
[25:22] so the word is more than just the
[25:25] written word the word is a living word
[25:27] and so we serve a living god and the
[25:29] living god is here right now though you
[25:31] can't see him with your eyes amen but
[25:33] he's here to offer deliverance and
[25:35] victory in your life as long as you want
[25:37] it amen and and he is as real as you
[25:40] want him to be and he said that sounds
[25:43] so
[25:44] worldly but it's true
[25:47] amen your home will be as godly as you
[25:50] want it to be amen your marriage will be
[25:52] as godly as you want it to be your
[25:54] church will be as godly as as you want
[25:56] it to be and so that's why he did he
[25:59] sent his word he couldn't send anything
[26:01] else because christ was the word amen
[26:03] and he brought his spirit and his word
[26:05] together and he delivered you from your
[26:08] destructive old nature amen
[26:11] you were going the wrong way but god got
[26:15] a hold of you one day god rich in mercy
[26:18] and from then on he began to grow you
[26:20] into his likeness and so the jews in
[26:23] jesus day what happened they lost faith
[26:26] in the blood of the lamb
[26:30] and they put more faith in their church
[26:32] and traditions than the blood
[26:34] amen we're in a day where it's the bride
[26:38] is getting rid of her
[26:40] traditions and she's putting more faith
[26:42] in the blood amen she's putting more
[26:44] faith in jesus christ the reality of her
[26:47] experience amen glory to god
[26:50] oh
[26:51] there's so much i could say but we don't
[26:53] have time but you just start putting the
[26:56] word first by the holy ghost and you can
[26:59] see every little thing to the point
[27:01] where people are going to go
[27:04] you're relating everything back to god
[27:06] oh god did this god did this
[27:10] well no it's true
[27:12] amen he did do this i i was
[27:15] oh
[27:16] i was mowing my lawn and it's a big lawn
[27:19] and i said lord
[27:20] if you could see fit
[27:22] could i have one of those lawn sweepers
[27:24] that hook up to the back of my riding
[27:25] lawnmower i said in jesus name
[27:31] that night i
[27:33] went in and
[27:35] looked up on craigslist
[27:38] there's a long sweeper and they they are
[27:41] told they've been so hard to get and
[27:43] there's one in monmouth where our
[27:45] churches
[27:47] so i wouldn't picked it up
[27:49] but see you might be sitting there
[27:50] saying
[27:51] so
[27:54] but to me
[27:56] that's the god of the impossible at work
[27:58] because he
[28:01] he heard my lips
[28:03] and
[28:05] and it was it was a want
[28:08] but he gives your wants sometimes to
[28:10] help you along through your experience
[28:13] amen
[28:14] hallelujah and that stuff happens all
[28:17] the time
[28:19] because
[28:20] we are in the age of the spoken word
[28:22] aren't we
[28:24] amen
[28:26] well brother that's for no
[28:29] you don't don't tell me what god doesn't
[28:32] do
[28:32] i i'm a little bit tired of that
[28:35] why don't you start telling me what he
[28:36] does
[28:38] our church doesn't do that i don't care
[28:40] what your church does or doesn't amen
[28:42] what does god do amen let me come over
[28:45] there and and take my sledgehammer and
[28:47] start breaking the crust off of you
[28:50] hallelujah
[28:51] amen and so the jews had lost their
[28:53] faith in the lamb and put more faith in
[28:55] traditions and so is message the message
[28:58] churches around this world especially
[29:00] the u.s
[29:02] they have lost faith in the mail
[29:05] oh how can you say that
[29:07] then let me see the word move in your
[29:09] life
[29:11] oh brother you're you're talking about
[29:13] signs and wonders and miracles no i'm
[29:15] not
[29:16] i'm just talking about you being an
[29:18] overcomer let's start there
[29:20] let's start with your attitude
[29:23] brother brown says when when you lose
[29:25] faith
[29:26] you start you start complaining about
[29:29] others
[29:30] you start
[29:31] you start complaining about other
[29:32] churches you start you start saying oh
[29:35] they're not this uh you know they're
[29:37] they're they're minor league we are so
[29:39] revelated they are minor league how
[29:41] could how why would we even want to go
[29:43] there
[29:46] that's a real quote
[29:48] that's a message quote
[29:49] and it's just like god's going
[29:52] okay
[29:53] let me just pull my spirit back from you
[29:57] hallelujah but see they've lost faith in
[30:00] the mail both in the written and the
[30:02] spirit forms
[30:04] your pastor travels
[30:06] he can tell you that
[30:09] fear has overtaken
[30:11] messaged churches
[30:16] when the male is right here to deliver
[30:20] but brother that that's that's a hard
[30:22] thing yes it is that's a hard thing but
[30:24] you just believe what he says he does it
[30:27] hallelujah and so
[30:30] and we rely on theology and doctrine
[30:33] rather than the male amen
[30:36] you know what i've said it before but i
[30:38] believe it if i go to hell preaching
[30:41] this gospel
[30:42] then that's what it will have to be
[30:46] because
[30:48] we believe this word and and we want to
[30:51] see jesus christ blossom in our life and
[30:54] that comes you have to have that word
[30:57] amen and so revival for the bride is not
[31:00] focused around doctrine brother brown
[31:01] says it's never been around doctrine it
[31:04] is about jesus christ and his word
[31:07] that's where revival is and that's why
[31:09] this is the the bride's revival of the
[31:12] word jesus christ amen and see here's
[31:15] the wonderful thing the blood of jesus
[31:17] was created it wasn't mary's egg it
[31:20] wasn't anybody else's seed it was god
[31:23] created both those things in her womb
[31:27] and what did she say
[31:29] she said be it unto me according to your
[31:31] word
[31:32] she wasn't a spiritual giant amen
[31:35] hattie wright wasn't a spiritual giant
[31:37] but they could say be it unto me yes
[31:41] lord i don't know how it's gonna happen
[31:43] but i believe that you're the god of the
[31:45] impossible
[31:47] praise god
[31:48] amen just like that we went on this
[31:52] young guy he was like 30 and and and we
[31:55] call it a code but cpr and all drugs and
[31:58] innovation and all that
[32:00] and
[32:01] he'd been a sisterly which is flatline
[32:03] and people don't usually come back from
[32:04] that and so again we're we're walking in
[32:07] to help the other engine crew and i i
[32:10] walked by and
[32:11] i seen it was flatline and i looked up
[32:13] my other friend and i said yeah let's
[32:15] just do one more round of drugs and then
[32:17] call it
[32:18] but but god had been dealing with me on
[32:22] just doing what the word says
[32:25] so as i'm walking by
[32:27] i touch his shoulder
[32:30] and from here
[32:32] to here
[32:41] brother that's coincidence
[32:43] boy isn't that odd brother paul that
[32:45] everything is coincidence
[32:47] can you see
[32:49] i know some of you were thinking that
[32:51] but that's
[32:52] again we have to get out of that
[32:54] thinking because we are word people we
[32:58] have the holy ghost and the word does
[33:00] exactly what it says
[33:02] and and see out of my mouth i said if i
[33:05] ever see him again i'm going to testify
[33:08] to him the very next morning at work
[33:14] we're back out there this is like a
[33:15] month or so later we're back out there
[33:17] and i thought that kind of sounds like
[33:18] matthew this this kid
[33:21] and
[33:22] and we walk in there and i see him i go
[33:25] you and he goes
[33:28] like that
[33:29] it's like ooh sorry he's having chest
[33:31] pain and now i just made it worse
[33:33] but
[33:35] i said you're a miracle
[33:37] and so i was able to say can i pray for
[33:40] you
[33:41] he's like yeah
[33:43] you know because he he doesn't know
[33:44] anything about god but i tell you what
[33:47] when god wants to do something he's
[33:49] going to do it amen and so
[33:51] though
[33:53] the word is the male
[33:54] and he never comes out of a church
[33:57] he never comes out of religion
[33:59] brother uh
[34:03] oh
[34:05] i didn't have coffee so i'm forgetting
[34:07] his name but
[34:08] brother lawson he was out one time when
[34:10] we're on the beach and we're witnessing
[34:12] to this guy on the beach and and i said
[34:14] you know what i hate religion
[34:16] and he looks at us he goes you can't say
[34:19] that you're preachers
[34:22] and it's like well yeah because religion
[34:24] and christianity are two different
[34:26] things amen and so
[34:28] god doesn't come out of a church amen
[34:31] and so god is in every church even
[34:34] denominational churches because guess
[34:36] what whether you want to believe it or
[34:38] not the word is the word is the word no
[34:41] matter where amen
[34:43] they may not have what you have but they
[34:45] have the they have parts of the word and
[34:48] if you didn't have anywhere else to go
[34:50] and and there was uh some place around
[34:52] there then you could say amen to
[34:54] different parts of the word sitting
[34:56] there
[34:57] hallelujah amen you know what we got to
[35:00] quit telling our husband what to do
[35:04] right
[35:06] amen let him just let him lead
[35:09] praise god
[35:11] and so
[35:12] that blood was created so that so that
[35:15] it could do the work that he said it
[35:16] would do
[35:17] and so he never come out of the jews
[35:19] religion he was completely separate
[35:22] brother branham the messenger of this
[35:24] hour never came out of denominations he
[35:26] was completely outside the church
[35:28] amen because here's the thing brother
[35:30] iran says that the church can sit on and
[35:33] hover over those church members
[35:36] just just relax
[35:38] oh isn't it warm doesn't it all nice and
[35:41] fuzzy and oh don't you have a good time
[35:44] when you're here
[35:45] but if they're not with the if the mate
[35:47] hasn't been with them then then they're
[35:49] going to rot so what good is it
[35:52] and i'm about church
[35:54] but let's let's let's bring our
[35:56] sacrifice of praise
[35:58] let's come with the expectation that god
[36:01] is going to reveal himself every service
[36:04] amen because
[36:06] in jehovah jiren 64
[36:09] he says that jesus christ
[36:12] oh i love this
[36:13] brings the fertility of the spirit
[36:18] hallelujah amen
[36:21] he
[36:22] he does it he's the one that brings it
[36:24] he's the one that causes you to be
[36:26] impregnated with his spirit he's the one
[36:29] that causes you to believe the word all
[36:31] the best you can do is intellectually
[36:33] try to figure out the message we have to
[36:36] be born again amen and and he will be
[36:39] born again in many different ways don't
[36:41] let somebody tell you that you have to
[36:43] do a certain thing because usually in a
[36:46] multiple choice test if if the question
[36:48] says you must you have to amen or always
[36:52] it's wrong you don't have to fear that
[36:56] just just
[36:57] bring their ministry bring their words
[36:59] in front of the earl and summon and if
[37:01] it doesn't light up then you don't fear
[37:03] them
[37:04] hallelujah so it's the fertility of a
[37:07] spirit that he gives you it's he makes
[37:10] you believe you never wanted to go to
[37:12] church you never wanted to believe it is
[37:14] he that makes you believe you are here
[37:16] because your husband brought you
[37:19] oh
[37:21] hallelujah
[37:22] praise the lord
[37:24] we were preaching somewhere
[37:26] one time and
[37:28] a woman came to church and afterwards
[37:30] she she said that she had a dream and
[37:32] god told her to come to church
[37:35] at this church
[37:37] and god spoke to her
[37:41] later on she got baptized she'd come up
[37:43] out of the water
[37:45] god took cigarettes from her
[37:48] he's the god of the impossible
[37:51] amen hallelujah and so
[37:54] the fertility of the spirit he gives you
[37:57] he makes you believe don't worry just
[38:00] repent and be baptized and let him lead
[38:02] you oh hallelujah amen and besides that
[38:07] your pastor is ordained to see you
[38:09] through god will anoint him i guarantee
[38:11] if you start praying and asking god's
[38:13] questions then he will
[38:15] then your pastor will be anointed to
[38:17] speak him back to you
[38:18] and so ephesians
[38:21] 3 20
[38:22] now unto him who is able to do exceeding
[38:26] abundantly above all that we ask or
[38:28] think
[38:29] according to the power that works in us
[38:32] that word power means virtue according
[38:34] to the virtue that works inside of you
[38:37] by the word amen and so
[38:39] we we don't even ask enough amen we
[38:42] don't expect enough amen
[38:44] oh but if you start to expect start to
[38:47] ask oh but brother i don't want to bug
[38:49] him and you know what i just want to be
[38:51] humble i want to
[38:53] yeah keep keep giving me your excuses
[38:56] right
[38:57] i think my job kind of may be a little
[38:59] bit hard on some things but it's for our
[39:02] own good amen because i'm hard on myself
[39:04] amen and so but no just start saying
[39:07] lord
[39:08] this is a need
[39:10] amen or this healing i need this amen
[39:14] i'm in the line of duty
[39:18] if you're a wife you're in the line of
[39:20] duty if you're a husband you're in the
[39:22] line of duty if you're a minister you're
[39:23] in the line of duty amen and so
[39:26] moses was in the line of duty and the
[39:29] sea parted for him amen hallelujah
[39:32] you're in the line of duty start asking
[39:34] for those things amen
[39:36] praise the lord amen hallelujah i don't
[39:40] care if it's a parting of the sea or
[39:42] anything we were on top of the rocky
[39:44] mountains when i was a little kid one
[39:46] time and it was a snowstorm a blizzard
[39:48] were in a white car and my my dad was
[39:51] going lord jesus we're going to be hit
[39:53] by a semi if you don't do something and
[39:55] all of a sudden thus saith the lord in
[39:58] five minutes this storm will clear and
[40:00] you will be able to go and drive on and
[40:02] as a little boy i still remember sitting
[40:04] in there and the the sky is going back
[40:06] amen
[40:08] are were we anything special absolutely
[40:10] not but god loves his bride amen
[40:14] he loves to do abundantly above all what
[40:17] you ask and think amen
[40:20] hallelujah
[40:22] amen
[40:23] see
[40:24] this is why we must project him
[40:29] oh don't get caught up in the things
[40:30] that you're too good for that you're too
[40:33] good to get sucked into all the things
[40:35] of the world
[40:36] amen see the people need to come in
[40:39] contact with the male
[40:42] christ in you
[40:44] amen not just the church
[40:46] none of the guys that work who are
[40:48] unbelievers they hate church
[40:51] and they make fun of christians all the
[40:53] time
[40:56] except me
[41:00] and i'm not saying that arrogantly
[41:02] except me
[41:05] they would always get on me you gotta
[41:08] talk more you gotta say this i said i
[41:11] don't have to do anything i said how
[41:13] about i just live a life
[41:19] and god saved
[41:22] one or two of those guys
[41:25] praise god
[41:27] i don't have to do anything that that
[41:29] that denominational spirit tries to tell
[41:31] me to do
[41:33] because the world is already sick of it
[41:35] amen and so
[41:37] the thing of it is there's nothing worse
[41:39] to see a defeated and worldly message
[41:42] person
[41:44] just to find all of their entertainments
[41:48] all of their words all of this all of
[41:51] that well brother branham said well
[41:53] brother
[41:55] amen
[41:57] hallelujah
[41:58] see there's an old saying
[42:01] if i can remember it right
[42:03] what is it you can't kid a kid or you
[42:05] can't
[42:07] you can't fool somebody who's already
[42:08] been there
[42:10] right
[42:11] and so
[42:14] what it does to me i don't look down on
[42:16] them at all i just think god there's
[42:17] another one i need to put on the prayer
[42:19] list
[42:23] and and so i don't i don't look down on
[42:25] people who are sinners
[42:28] because that's just what they are
[42:29] brother brown says you cannot bring a
[42:31] sinner under your rules
[42:36] and so if they come to church and
[42:38] they're in a uh if the guys come in and
[42:40] in shorts and a tank top and flip-flops
[42:45] then they come in
[42:46] right
[42:51] see we don't like that do we
[42:55] bless god when i came i had sleep down
[42:58] to here my my
[43:00] skirt was so long and drugged 20 feet
[43:02] behind me
[43:03] and the guy says yes i had a flat top
[43:05] and high and tied and and i had this
[43:07] suit it was just right
[43:12] i'm not about coming as you are and you
[43:14] know i'm about dressing up because you
[43:16] want to do your best but these sinners
[43:19] don't know any better
[43:21] and i can give you testimonies
[43:24] not all day long about from people at
[43:26] the tabernacle
[43:29] and so the deacons allowed this one
[43:32] hippie they picked up he was in cut off
[43:34] levi's and one of those just thin tank
[43:36] tops and bare feet
[43:38] hello brother god bless you here's your
[43:40] seat
[43:42] probably i've seen it uh one day that
[43:44] when i used to live in ohio i walked in
[43:47] and i couldn't get home to change it was
[43:49] when i lived with brother doug and his
[43:51] brothers and and i was in my baseball
[43:53] uniform from coaching baseball and
[43:56] and i came in and i sat in the back row
[43:58] and these people kind of turned just
[44:00] like they're kind of like
[44:06] i wanted to say i'm sorry
[44:08] i couldn't get home i wanted to be here
[44:11] amen
[44:12] and so but and so i feel sorry for them
[44:16] but see that's the reason why people
[44:18] don't desire
[44:20] what you have
[44:22] because because you're allowing the
[44:24] world to suck it out of you that doesn't
[44:27] mean you're lost amen it just means that
[44:29] we have to allow the husband to be in
[44:32] more control amen
[44:34] and so matthew 5 13 it says ye are the
[44:37] salt of the earth but if the salt have
[44:39] lost his savior wherewith shall it be
[44:42] salted it thenceforth it is thenceforth
[44:45] good for nothing but to be cast out and
[44:48] be trodden under foot of men all right
[44:51] so i'm i'm at work
[44:52] and i'm at one of the bigger stations so
[44:54] there's a lot of guys there someone
[44:56] calls up and they said oh there's this
[44:57] naked woman on this channel she's so
[45:00] whatever
[45:01] and so they're like
[45:04] you know getting to change the channel
[45:06] well
[45:07] i was like great so i just turned and
[45:09] i'm in the kit i'm at the kitchen but
[45:11] it's one bit of open room so i turn over
[45:12] here
[45:13] and uh
[45:16] blackwell one of the guys
[45:18] one of the funniest people you'd ever
[45:19] want to work with
[45:21] he uh he's seen me and he goes
[45:24] in his face he goes
[45:26] rich
[45:27] he goes
[45:29] you you make me feel like a sinner
[45:34] and he was kind of serious
[45:36] and i said
[45:38] well
[45:41] right
[45:43] amen after dinner all the dishes were
[45:45] washed everything's cleaned up they'd
[45:48] always sit down a movie and one of my
[45:50] friends
[45:53] i'd always get up and go to my room to
[45:55] study
[45:56] and he started telling him he goes man
[45:59] rich is tired all the time
[46:02] he never stays and watches
[46:05] and finally he came and talked to me
[46:07] and he gave his heart to the lord
[46:08] because of that
[46:12] we had these guys are good guys nice
[46:15] guys but
[46:17] we had one guy named stan and he was so
[46:19] filthy and so every time he jumped out
[46:22] he goes hey guys
[46:24] he's like
[46:25] and so when i seen him come i had to
[46:27] just turn and go away from him
[46:30] and they don't like that sometimes but
[46:32] you know what i love my husband more
[46:34] than those guys
[46:36] hallelujah and so
[46:39] one time i i did something to another
[46:41] group and they're like very charismatic
[46:43] christians and and one of the guys mark
[46:46] he's just like you
[46:47] you legalist you think this and that he
[46:50] was so upset
[46:52] and it was like you know what i don't
[46:54] care what you think i did something i'm
[46:57] going to apologize
[47:01] and so no one rules me
[47:03] see i don't care what anybody thinks of
[47:05] me in here
[47:09] i think when you're just starting out
[47:11] you tend to ask opinions of other
[47:13] ministers but as you get older you we
[47:15] don't do that anymore you go straight to
[47:17] god and let him give you the answer and
[47:19] so i i'm not approved by any minister in
[47:22] the message i don't have a stamp of my
[47:24] passport to michigan
[47:26] approved
[47:28] no
[47:29] god approves you
[47:31] god approves your pastor god approves
[47:33] you as an individual amen and so
[47:37] brother mama says you are the salt of
[47:39] the earth
[47:40] and the salt can only save if it comes
[47:43] in contact with the spoiling earth
[47:46] so
[47:46] you don't have to be part of that
[47:48] spoilage
[47:50] you don't have to act like that you
[47:52] don't have to you say but brother
[47:53] richard sorry i know it's hard that's
[47:55] why we need each other that's why we
[47:57] need mentors that's why we need to be in
[47:59] prayer read the word it is hard but you
[48:02] don't have to sacrifice yourself
[48:05] because god has something for you to do
[48:09] amen hallelujah and so christ
[48:12] that preservative must come in contact
[48:14] with the spoiling earth amen it's
[48:17] rotting away but you have the key to
[48:20] life amen you have that word of god you
[48:23] have the mail amen and they need you
[48:26] that's why this is not about brother
[48:28] branham this is about the elisha
[48:30] ministry of the bride
[48:33] amen you
[48:34] have to come in contact so you can give
[48:37] out of yourself praise the lord
[48:40] hallelujah
[48:41] amen
[48:44] see
[48:45] we've lost our brotherly love we
[48:49] you know i i've worked around homeless
[48:51] people all my career
[48:53] and
[48:54] and
[48:55] there's
[48:56] they're not nice people and so don't
[48:58] give me any lecture on homeless people
[49:00] because if you do you probably don't
[49:03] know what it's like
[49:04] so don't tell me anything
[49:09] they're murderers
[49:12] they're thiefs they're vandals
[49:15] they assault one another they rape one
[49:17] another
[49:21] but
[49:22] they're a son
[49:23] and a daughter of somebody
[49:25] we're on a call one time and one of the
[49:26] police officers
[49:28] i said you know what there uh and he
[49:30] said he goes they're somebody's son
[49:32] they're somebody's daughter and i said
[49:34] exactly i said that's why
[49:36] that's why i don't hate them that's why
[49:38] i don't reject them hey man but they
[49:41] will not pull the wool over my eyes
[49:43] but i will help them any way they can
[49:46] that's what you have to be like
[49:48] you have to have eyes the sea and ears
[49:50] to hear you have to have the vision of
[49:52] your husband so that you can come
[49:54] through these things and so it causes
[49:56] you to love your pentecostal brothers
[50:00] your baptist brothers your methodist
[50:02] brothers it causes you to do those
[50:04] things amen and you love them praise the
[50:07] lord jesus hallelujah and so the people
[50:10] of this world they're looking for
[50:12] reality and at my work amen all those
[50:15] worldly men mocked all the christians
[50:18] except me
[50:21] why is that
[50:23] because i'm not well it's probably
[50:25] because you're not really saying
[50:27] anything you're probably getting right
[50:29] no
[50:30] no the one who still
[50:32] uh calls me and wants to get together
[50:35] i'd walk in and he goes hey you guys
[50:37] shut up he goes cobs here
[50:42] i was like oh cool this is nice
[50:46] amen
[50:47] and you know stuff like that so they
[50:50] they they're even protecting you
[50:53] and so that's why it's like and one time
[50:56] he somebody said something to me goes
[50:58] he goes well he goes i'm living my
[51:01] christian life through cobb
[51:04] i said well that's nice but no
[51:06] you you need to have your own amen
[51:08] you're a big burly firefighter you gotta
[51:10] grow up amen
[51:12] hallelujah and so
[51:14] am i taking too long okay
[51:26] that's why i love dealing with
[51:28] unregenerate people
[51:30] that's why i love dealing with people
[51:32] who who'd know nothing about god
[51:36] amen it's it for me that's very
[51:37] fulfilling uh one of our the guys that
[51:40] go to the brothers go to the church he
[51:42] has been testifying to a brother and
[51:44] this brother was in the middle east and
[51:46] so he has ptsd
[51:48] and and so
[51:50] he he texted me and we got acquainted
[51:52] and i'm supposed to go talk to start
[51:54] talking to him at lunch when i get back
[51:57] but he goes you know what he goes
[51:59] he goes i thought i was the antichrist
[52:01] he goes i don't know if i'm savable and
[52:03] i'm like oh
[52:05] you talk about serving up a home run
[52:07] pitch amen oh
[52:09] i it makes you want to feel like dumping
[52:11] out everything you know what god has
[52:13] said amen and so i'm excited to be with
[52:16] this guy to tell him about jesus christ
[52:19] and what he's done for him already and
[52:22] then bring him further in the word amen
[52:24] and so i just love that and so
[52:28] the male is in control if you haven't
[52:30] got the idea yet
[52:33] the male is in control
[52:37] see in the old testament the blood was
[52:39] good
[52:41] but he never took the desire
[52:43] but when jesus christ came
[52:47] and he sent the holy ghost back he shed
[52:48] his blood sent the holy ghost back
[52:51] then he banished those desires forever
[52:59] and here's where most of the people get
[53:01] quiet
[53:02] god took the spirit of lust out of me
[53:05] when he saved me
[53:08] the desire
[53:11] oh brother so you you're never tempted
[53:13] ever are you
[53:16] wrong
[53:19] but the desire is not there
[53:22] jesus was tempted in every way
[53:27] if you were a homosexual today and want
[53:29] deliverance you would want to know he
[53:31] was tempted
[53:33] right
[53:34] i'm just saying what the bible said in
[53:36] every way see we want to put it in this
[53:37] box no in every way
[53:41] and so
[53:44] you are still tempted
[53:46] but temptation cast down is not sin
[53:52] that's where maturity comes that's where
[53:54] that battle of the mind and you start
[53:56] doing that and it could be you know
[53:59] dozens of other things right but you
[54:02] start casting that down
[54:04] and the devil's just pounding saying see
[54:06] there you go you're not a believer and
[54:09] if he's doing that you're saying oh
[54:10] thank you you're telling me i'm a
[54:12] believer praise the lord amen and so
[54:14] don't let those things get you down and
[54:17] despondent and want to give up just you
[54:19] that means that you are going the right
[54:21] direction
[54:23] hallelujah
[54:24] amen
[54:26] and i say this and i don't want to be
[54:27] crude but in our line of work you see
[54:30] more naked flesh than most people do in
[54:32] their whole life
[54:36] praise god
[54:38] the desire was gone and so it's it's it
[54:42] doesn't rip you apart
[54:44] oh i love god so much
[54:46] amen that's why i seen brother chris
[54:50] cathy and heard his testimony of saying
[54:52] yes
[54:53] hallelujah praise the lord and so
[55:02] when you're serving him this is an
[55:03] active relationship you're not seeing
[55:06] how close you can get to the world
[55:07] you're seeing how far you can get away
[55:09] from the world amen and so
[55:12] see
[55:13] how do you think good people keep a
[55:15] christian testimony at school or at work
[55:17] how do they do that well they're just
[55:20] man they get all charged up and and
[55:22] they're all they have their mindset
[55:26] i said lord i'm going to work again
[55:29] god i'm in a battle
[55:30] and lord but greater are you that is in
[55:32] me than he that's in this world
[55:34] and god i need you i need you to be
[55:37] victorious and i accept that today in
[55:39] the name of jesus christ amen that's
[55:41] what that's what happens hallelujah we
[55:44] were all sitting around a table one day
[55:46] one of our captains was making fun of
[55:48] people who spoke in tongues
[55:50] you know how you get you're just like
[55:54] i'm gonna have to say something
[55:57] so
[55:57] i pulled him aside i said greg
[56:02] i said there's a lot of faults
[56:03] but i said there's a reel
[56:06] and explained to him and i think he felt
[56:09] like maybe i was going to
[56:10] write him up
[56:14] but i just wanted to
[56:15] explain to him but i couldn't let that
[56:17] go
[56:18] see that there what happens is you can't
[56:20] let those things go you can't let people
[56:23] make fun of other christians amen you
[56:26] can't let people make fun of the word
[56:29] and and it's just you know for me
[56:31] i just i don't set anything on my bible
[56:34] does that really mean anything i don't
[56:36] know but i want to respect god
[56:39] amen
[56:40] oh he's so good to us today and so they
[56:43] need to see the people who have been
[56:45] with the mail amen and so
[56:48] another quote here from confirmation of
[56:50] the commission uh he's talking about the
[56:53] scripture if you abide in me my word
[56:55] abide in you you can ask what you will
[56:57] and it shall be done for you amen not
[57:01] maybe it will
[57:03] hallelujah
[57:04] and he says that that is staying with
[57:08] christ in the word don't go left don't
[57:10] go right amen stay right with it and
[57:13] then actually it's not your word anymore
[57:16] you begin to speak what he says and
[57:19] that's why you begin to create an
[57:21] atmosphere no matter where you are and
[57:25] every demon is subject to your
[57:27] atmosphere
[57:28] praise the lord jesus hallelujah every
[57:32] part of his word through your mouth has
[57:34] authority because brother random said in
[57:37] this day authority is the sign of the
[57:39] end is the sign of all of his brides
[57:41] amen
[57:43] hallelujah
[57:44] oh we have
[57:46] we do a spanish outreach and one to the
[57:48] couples they just started coming
[57:50] when this event happened and she was six
[57:53] months pregnant and the doctor said
[57:55] oh the baby i'm afraid it's probably
[57:57] dead
[57:59] and so she came to church
[58:02] and so the body prayed for that little
[58:04] baby
[58:05] and god raised that baby back to life
[58:10] then
[58:13] then they took another scan and one of
[58:15] his lungs were
[58:17] smaller than the other they said oh
[58:18] you're going to have to stay in this
[58:19] hospital and have therapy she goes i'm
[58:21] not doing any such thing they probably
[58:23] thought she was crazy
[58:25] so the body prayed
[58:28] and when they did another scan both
[58:30] lungs were the same size
[58:34] these signs shall follow them that
[58:36] believe
[58:37] that means message people
[58:42] the denominations don't have a corner on
[58:44] that
[58:45] that's part of your package did you know
[58:47] that brother ram says both the latter
[58:48] and the former lane are poured out for
[58:50] you
[58:52] which is the teaching rain and that
[58:55] supernatural rain
[58:57] just
[58:58] i want it to be just common to us
[59:01] not in the fact that you're complacent
[59:03] but it's just oh yeah i prayed and look
[59:05] what god did right
[59:07] praise the lord
[59:08] and so
[59:09] in mark 16 it says in 15
[59:13] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[59:14] world and preach the gospel into every
[59:16] creature and to preach means to make the
[59:19] word manifest in its life amen praise
[59:23] the lord amen it doesn't say go teach it
[59:26] go do this go do that it says go and
[59:28] preach the gospel the word of god in its
[59:32] life amen praise the lord jesus amen and
[59:36] so that's what god wants us to do today
[59:39] is that that's why your minister has to
[59:41] have the holy ghost so that the word can
[59:43] come forth in the power of the word amen
[59:46] hallelujah
[59:48] amen
[59:49] and that comes by the mail see the
[59:51] religious people they
[59:53] they don't deny message people who
[59:57] who are just church members they don't
[59:59] deny jesus christ
[1:00:01] they don't deny the word intellectually
[1:00:06] but they deny god
[1:00:09] giving you authority to move it that's
[1:00:11] what they don't like
[1:00:14] they want to reserve it for a special
[1:00:16] man
[1:00:17] and that is that you talk about
[1:00:19] antichrist
[1:00:21] praise the lord and so
[1:00:24] he
[1:00:24] he
[1:00:25] he wants to
[1:00:27] show you
[1:00:28] that
[1:00:29] he is everything the word says he is
[1:00:32] amen and all that he says will come to
[1:00:36] pass and so god revealed to us today the
[1:00:39] word of god which is jesus christ and
[1:00:42] and i like this scripture luke 1 45 and
[1:00:45] we're getting down towards the end
[1:00:48] luke 1 45 and blessed is she this is
[1:00:52] elizabeth speaking to mary and blessed
[1:00:55] is she that believed
[1:00:58] for there there shall be a performance
[1:01:01] of those things which were told her from
[1:01:03] the lord
[1:01:06] that's
[1:01:07] that's a performance means it's going to
[1:01:09] happen amen
[1:01:11] hallelujah and so there's going to be a
[1:01:13] performance whatever you've heard in
[1:01:15] this bible amen as you come here to
[1:01:17] church or or who are listening to those
[1:01:20] tapes whatever he told you there will be
[1:01:23] a performance not maybe it will be a
[1:01:26] performance you will be victorious you
[1:01:29] will be healed you will be a testimony
[1:01:32] you will
[1:01:33] suffer persecution and you will overcome
[1:01:36] it
[1:01:37] hallelujah amen praise the lord jesus
[1:01:40] see philippians 1 6 being confident of
[1:01:43] this very thing that he which hath begun
[1:01:46] a good work in you
[1:01:48] will perform it unto the day of jesus
[1:01:50] christ
[1:01:51] not maybe will
[1:01:54] oh hallelujah praise the lord jesus
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] and so he began the good work then he'll
[1:02:01] lead you and guide you into all the
[1:02:03] truth don't worry don't get under
[1:02:05] pressure when when god saved me
[1:02:08] i had to make a choice do i follow what
[1:02:10] the message people are telling me or do
[1:02:12] i follow what god's telling me
[1:02:14] and i said i'm going to follow what
[1:02:15] god's telling me
[1:02:18] because message people can be wrong
[1:02:24] but not god
[1:02:27] hallelujah he brings you to maturity
[1:02:30] and so if you're married to the male
[1:02:32] then he is your husband and you're to
[1:02:34] let him do the leading i was preaching
[1:02:36] one time and we had a bunch of
[1:02:38] unbelievers and i i kept saying he's the
[1:02:40] husband and i'm the wife and they asked
[1:02:41] their parents they go is he gay
[1:02:45] i just started laughing
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:52] see
[1:02:52] the church can't lead you
[1:02:54] message theology cannot lead you brother
[1:02:57] branham and his series when he was there
[1:02:59] in jeffersonville with uh who is this
[1:03:01] melchizedek and marriage in divorce he
[1:03:04] says he says am i going to lead you to
[1:03:06] jeffersonville he goes absolutely not
[1:03:09] we're as full of mistakes as anyone else
[1:03:11] i can't lead you to anywhere except
[1:03:13] jesus christ
[1:03:15] and so the church cannot lead you but
[1:03:17] the male will lead you you just have to
[1:03:20] surrender to this word amen
[1:03:23] hallelujah in our marriages
[1:03:25] if we don't come into relationships with
[1:03:27] the holy ghost then your marriage in the
[1:03:30] message will not last i've seen it
[1:03:33] two years maybe
[1:03:36] because you come in with
[1:03:39] the wrong set of expectations
[1:03:42] because when the holy ghost puts you
[1:03:44] together then
[1:03:46] like for me and my wife and and if she
[1:03:49] was here she would say it's just not me
[1:03:52] it's better now than it was the first
[1:03:55] few years
[1:03:56] and the young people are going yeah
[1:03:58] whatever
[1:04:01] and i look at them going
[1:04:04] you are so ignorant
[1:04:07] see
[1:04:08] because you don't know what you don't
[1:04:09] know
[1:04:10] but with the holy ghost because the holy
[1:04:12] ghost takes you through trials struggles
[1:04:15] and you're getting knit closer and
[1:04:16] closer and closer and closer and so
[1:04:19] every part of the marriage relationship
[1:04:21] gets better and so we just we just had
[1:04:24] our 25th and it's like it's awesome
[1:04:28] praise the lord jesus hallelujah and so
[1:04:33] a real wife desires her husband to lead
[1:04:37] i was setting with
[1:04:38] or my wife was set with deacon's wives
[1:04:40] from a certain church in another state
[1:04:43] so you don't you can't guess
[1:04:46] and they were all talk and they go
[1:04:49] i can't obey my
[1:04:52] husband and this is a revelated church
[1:04:57] with all the answers
[1:05:02] i was like excuse me
[1:05:04] you can't obey your husband
[1:05:08] hmm
[1:05:11] that's a scarecrow i didn't say
[1:05:15] this message i knew brother branham was
[1:05:17] wrong
[1:05:20] no
[1:05:21] it's like
[1:05:22] they need revelation the message is
[1:05:24] always right praise the lord and so
[1:05:28] a real wife desires the husband to lead
[1:05:31] and if she has the spirit inside then
[1:05:33] god will allow him amen he you through
[1:05:37] your prayers if he's not the leader then
[1:05:39] you can pray him into that position
[1:05:42] because he answers your prayer
[1:05:44] whatsoever you need right and don't
[1:05:47] doubt it'll come to pass
[1:05:49] you you can pray him into things
[1:05:52] that's getting kind of weird brother
[1:05:53] rich
[1:05:55] okay
[1:05:57] right
[1:06:02] hallelujah because
[1:06:05] the wife and the kids need a leader they
[1:06:07] don't need a wet dish rag right
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:12] see we had to come to that point
[1:06:15] no media in the bedrooms it all stays
[1:06:17] out in the hallway before they go to bed
[1:06:25] we've had too many incidents
[1:06:28] so
[1:06:30] well you don't love your kids i guess
[1:06:32] not
[1:06:35] right
[1:06:37] i guess not
[1:06:39] but it makes me feel better
[1:06:42] hallelujah
[1:06:44] and so
[1:06:48] the man you have to lead by that
[1:06:50] anointed word
[1:06:54] because if you don't your wife's going
[1:06:55] to try to fill that position
[1:06:58] and as a man sometimes laid a scene man
[1:07:00] it's like oh this is nice
[1:07:03] man she cooks she cleans she does
[1:07:05] devotions and she takes the kids to
[1:07:07] church when i'm because because you know
[1:07:09] i gotta have some man time i gotta i
[1:07:11] gotta go fishing on sunday
[1:07:18] and and she's struggling and you're out
[1:07:20] there
[1:07:22] being a wimp
[1:07:24] see it takes a real man to lead his
[1:07:25] house
[1:07:27] hallelujah and i know i'm not i'm
[1:07:29] preaching the choir because
[1:07:30] brother paul preaches the same thing so
[1:07:33] because she wants leadership
[1:07:35] a sheep wants leadership
[1:07:37] we want leadership i want him to lead i
[1:07:39] want him to be in control and so it's i
[1:07:42] i like this
[1:07:44] see
[1:07:45] all of us just not me you work around a
[1:07:47] lot of filthy people
[1:07:49] whether at work or at school
[1:07:51] and guess what i made mistakes
[1:07:56] i grieved over them
[1:08:00] but i never did it again
[1:08:03] that's the evidence of the holy spirit
[1:08:04] in your life
[1:08:06] because you couldn't do that if you were
[1:08:07] trying to do it in a sanctified state
[1:08:09] only
[1:08:11] amen see it was the male it was god who
[1:08:14] kept me
[1:08:16] and he was god who kept me repenting
[1:08:19] because he he he he did it that night
[1:08:22] because
[1:08:23] see i went back from living here
[1:08:26] and and i was a good kid and i went to
[1:08:28] church
[1:08:29] and
[1:08:30] and i was polite and respectful but when
[1:08:32] i got back and that we'll talk about
[1:08:34] that tonight more bit
[1:08:36] i just i got in with my old friends
[1:08:38] again
[1:08:39] and then i ended up in the casinos and
[1:08:41] drinking and i was addicted and and if
[1:08:44] you've ever been addicted has anybody
[1:08:46] ever had addictions
[1:08:50] you know what it's like
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:53] have to do it
[1:08:56] there's not an option you you have to do
[1:08:59] it
[1:09:00] and so
[1:09:05] but i left
[1:09:06] one night
[1:09:08] when i was like seminar retailed that
[1:09:10] little part tonight but when i left that
[1:09:12] casino
[1:09:14] sick and tired of myself
[1:09:16] desperate
[1:09:18] i just said god i i can't i can't do it
[1:09:24] i can't do this
[1:09:26] either make me the best sinner you've
[1:09:27] ever made or make me the best christian
[1:09:30] and i was snotting and bawling
[1:09:32] because you're desperate
[1:09:34] no wonder god didn't let me get married
[1:09:37] i would have ruined some girl's life
[1:09:39] especially you know
[1:09:44] but in that car
[1:09:46] it wasn't a supernatural presence
[1:09:49] all i did i felt something it was almost
[1:09:51] like a switch in my back literally
[1:09:54] it's just like
[1:09:57] that was weird
[1:10:00] and then i went back home the next day
[1:10:04] i'm at work
[1:10:06] and
[1:10:09] i'm not desiring to look at every woman
[1:10:11] that comes along
[1:10:14] i thought
[1:10:16] whoa
[1:10:17] something's wrong
[1:10:20] and then we have to write charts and i
[1:10:23] wasn't i just didn't you know if you
[1:10:25] don't check something oh it's just the
[1:10:26] pupils i'll just make that up
[1:10:28] i couldn't do that anymore
[1:10:31] you know what i'm saying things were
[1:10:33] changing and i got so excited that here
[1:10:36] come a girl and i was like
[1:10:38] it's not there
[1:10:40] you know the desire here
[1:10:42] oh you if you've never been delivered
[1:10:45] like that you don't know what we're
[1:10:46] talking about but it's the most awesome
[1:10:49] awesome feeling in the world to be set
[1:10:51] free amen from those things hallelujah
[1:10:54] amen and so we have to make our calling
[1:10:58] and our election sure because his bride
[1:11:02] is moved by a purely spiritual moving of
[1:11:06] god amen this is not politics this is
[1:11:08] not churchiani this is a sovereign move
[1:11:11] of god that he is doing hallelujah
[1:11:13] because we are led by the mail and in
[1:11:16] jeremiah 1 12 it says then said the lord
[1:11:19] unto me thou hast seen well for i will
[1:11:22] hasten my word to perform it if i didn't
[1:11:25] have a home where i knew that jesus
[1:11:28] christ was alive then i don't know if i
[1:11:30] would have made it amen but the devil
[1:11:32] couldn't tell me he wasn't real amen so
[1:11:35] that's why in our homes our kids must
[1:11:37] see jesus christ alive amen so when
[1:11:40] mommy or daddy they they get in a a
[1:11:43] little tiff that they just come back and
[1:11:45] they say
[1:11:46] i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that
[1:11:48] kids daddy's sorry amen
[1:11:51] ali we're on the my mom and dad a few
[1:11:54] times on the way to church would get
[1:11:56] into it and dad would get up there and
[1:11:57] say congregation i can't preach today
[1:12:00] i'm not worthy he says i had a fight
[1:12:02] with rachel and i asked for forgiveness
[1:12:04] would you forgive me
[1:12:09] you hear that yes brother god we forgive
[1:12:11] you you know
[1:12:14] but see he he promises to hasten that
[1:12:17] word to perform it he's just waiting for
[1:12:20] his bride to ask
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:24] hallelujah i mean sometimes i'm just
[1:12:26] waiting for charity to ask for something
[1:12:28] because she never does
[1:12:30] i said don't you want a bigger wedding
[1:12:32] ring
[1:12:33] no
[1:12:34] no this is good don't you want this
[1:12:36] close or that no i'm good you know
[1:12:39] our goodwill gets targets uh overflow so
[1:12:43] we're good
[1:12:44] but see
[1:12:46] he's there waiting to hasten the word
[1:12:48] amen
[1:12:49] hallelujah
[1:12:50] and so
[1:12:52] what happens is good people and so to me
[1:12:54] no one is lost
[1:12:57] right
[1:12:58] i don't think that way you're all a
[1:13:01] potential target
[1:13:03] and so
[1:13:04] good people can come under the influence
[1:13:06] of parts of the mail
[1:13:08] that's what's deceiving right
[1:13:10] you can you can be anointed i mean a lot
[1:13:13] of us some we've been in anointings
[1:13:15] where you just hit the floor or you can
[1:13:18] feel the presence of god so strong
[1:13:20] that's good but that doesn't mean you're
[1:13:21] a believer
[1:13:22] amen so they can come under different
[1:13:25] parts of the influence of the male but
[1:13:27] we're not here to do that we are the
[1:13:29] bride of jesus christ who comes under
[1:13:32] the total influence of that anointed
[1:13:34] word amen so you can you walk out to the
[1:13:38] work and you pull open that coat and you
[1:13:40] have a big super woman or superman on
[1:13:43] your chest
[1:13:45] because brother brahma says you are part
[1:13:46] of the super race whether you're red
[1:13:49] yellow black or white and you say satan
[1:13:52] what can you do to me amen my husband
[1:13:55] says that you are defeated and i walk on
[1:13:57] your neck i love it in the old testament
[1:14:00] where joshua had all the leaders come
[1:14:02] out and they said here lay those kings
[1:14:04] out there i want you to feel what it's
[1:14:05] like to put your foot on the neck of the
[1:14:07] devil amen and that's what god wants us
[1:14:10] to start doing to get the feeling of
[1:14:12] what it's like to see devil defeated
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:15] hallelujah
[1:14:18] praise the lord
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:23] we're called to be one with him oh just
[1:14:26] a just a big old bear hug with jesus
[1:14:28] christ right
[1:14:30] oh brother rich you're making him sound
[1:14:32] so personal
[1:14:35] uh
[1:14:36] yeah
[1:14:38] yeah
[1:14:39] you can be respectful
[1:14:41] but personal
[1:14:45] see this whole thing is so you can ask
[1:14:47] what you will
[1:14:48] according to the word because you're
[1:14:49] going to need it
[1:14:53] asking what you will
[1:14:55] god protecting we've seen it in our
[1:14:58] church
[1:14:59] several times god giving dreams or our
[1:15:03] circumstances where the children are
[1:15:05] just about getting into something they
[1:15:07] shouldn't and god allows the parents to
[1:15:09] intervene
[1:15:10] amen that's the day we're living
[1:15:13] hallelujah praise the lord he is
[1:15:16] protecting us
[1:15:17] again right after i retired i just about
[1:15:19] died literally from a pulmonary emboli
[1:15:23] and a lot of people don't live from that
[1:15:26] you're just gone
[1:15:29] but god healed me
[1:15:35] i like that
[1:15:37] because i'm in the line of duty brother
[1:15:39] paul's in the line of duty
[1:15:41] what can
[1:15:43] and every day i say lord thank you that
[1:15:45] all my blood sugars all my blood
[1:15:47] pressure
[1:15:49] are normal lord thank you that i can eat
[1:15:51] anything lord thank you that that this
[1:15:54] is healed and that's healed and this is
[1:15:56] healed and do i do i literally see it
[1:15:59] healed absolutely not but by faith i
[1:16:01] know it's healed
[1:16:03] because he's healed all of us plenty of
[1:16:06] times but i'm speaking what the word
[1:16:08] says
[1:16:10] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:16:13] is the bluff in this flesh amen you you
[1:16:17] you just lay that at his feet this
[1:16:18] morning and you can go on and you may
[1:16:21] still hobble you may still have that
[1:16:24] pain in the shoulder i hurt my shoulders
[1:16:26] at work and every time i'd throw an air
[1:16:27] pack on for a fire or training it they
[1:16:30] killed me but we had to visit any
[1:16:32] minister one time and he's i don't even
[1:16:34] know what he was preaching about but all
[1:16:36] of a sudden it was like
[1:16:38] god just manifested my shoulders
[1:16:41] it's like yes praise the lord
[1:16:44] you're in the line of duty today
[1:16:47] hallelujah john 15 7 it says in the
[1:16:50] amplified and if you live in me abide
[1:16:54] vitally united in me oh i'm sorry for
[1:16:57] being so long and my words remain in you
[1:17:00] and continue to live in your hearts ask
[1:17:02] whatever you will and it shall be done
[1:17:05] for you
[1:17:07] hallelujah that's the bride that's for
[1:17:09] you this morning praise the lord then he
[1:17:12] comes out from being the god of history
[1:17:14] the god of brother branham the god of
[1:17:16] your pastor it becomes the god of you
[1:17:19] fill in the blank amen praise the lord
[1:17:22] jesus
[1:17:23] he becomes the living word to you and
[1:17:26] that's exactly where we're at today it's
[1:17:28] god in you the hope of glory
[1:17:31] hallelujah
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:35] praise the lord
[1:17:38] see
[1:17:40] this has to
[1:17:42] be the control tower for your thoughts
[1:17:45] and so when you bring your thoughts
[1:17:47] under subjection to the soul
[1:17:49] then anything is possible
[1:17:53] anything is possible for you today your
[1:17:56] finances
[1:17:57] i don't have a
[1:17:59] i don't have a financial advisor
[1:18:01] of stock
[1:18:03] i do have
[1:18:05] retirement but you know what i tell you
[1:18:07] know what i do
[1:18:08] i pay ties and give offerings
[1:18:11] wow
[1:18:13] simple as that
[1:18:15] and he blesses me
[1:18:17] beyond my comprehension
[1:18:21] oh you mean money you got all this money
[1:18:23] your name's rich you're rich
[1:18:27] no
[1:18:29] but every time we have a need it's there
[1:18:32] every time the girls need clothes then
[1:18:35] god provides them because being a guy
[1:18:38] you don't realize that there's not many
[1:18:39] stores left
[1:18:42] they're all going under it seems like
[1:18:43] the ones where you could buy clothes at
[1:18:45] and but god provides clothes for them
[1:18:49] that are modest praise the lord and so
[1:18:53] he becomes the god of the impossible
[1:18:56] and as we close here
[1:19:00] just think of this today
[1:19:03] god sent a prophet to reveal jesus
[1:19:04] christ the word
[1:19:06] and you may call me shallow but guess
[1:19:09] what brother or sister i believe every
[1:19:11] mystery i believe everything brother
[1:19:14] branham said so
[1:19:16] so what are you gonna do with that
[1:19:19] oh i just got i'm calling you shallow
[1:19:24] hmm maybe you should repent
[1:19:28] i just got done thinking oh you're kind
[1:19:30] of pentecostal well
[1:19:32] why don't you get down and repent of
[1:19:33] just saying that about me
[1:19:36] or about somebody else
[1:19:40] amen i'm a brother
[1:19:44] and if i'm so shallow how come
[1:19:46] how come people at work want to be
[1:19:48] around me
[1:19:49] how come they know that i'm a real
[1:19:51] christian
[1:19:52] how come god answers my prayer and i'm
[1:19:54] not even telling you everything else
[1:19:56] that goes on in our life
[1:20:00] how about you this morning
[1:20:04] how about you this morning
[1:20:07] and i'm not saying that to be eric but
[1:20:09] i'm trying to prove a point
[1:20:11] you i am just like you
[1:20:13] and you can have the same benefits you
[1:20:16] can be as confident in him i'm not
[1:20:19] confident in myself
[1:20:21] amen but you can be as confident in that
[1:20:24] word of god because brother brahm said
[1:20:26] our sins would ruin us if it wasn't for
[1:20:29] christ
[1:20:30] amen you have no boasting i have no
[1:20:34] boasting amen but our boast is in jesus
[1:20:36] christ the living word for our day amen
[1:20:40] i've seen them raise the dead i've seen
[1:20:42] them grow legs and i've seen them change
[1:20:44] the heart of a sinner that guy at work
[1:20:46] he was just about divorced his kids were
[1:20:49] all messed up he was messed up and god
[1:20:51] saved him did he come to our revelation
[1:20:53] no but god saved him
[1:20:57] enough to where his friend brought his
[1:20:59] guys into the the medic shack one night
[1:21:01] when we were at the hospital and he was
[1:21:04] mad
[1:21:05] he goes what did you do to sean
[1:21:09] i said
[1:21:10] nothing
[1:21:11] i just kept doing that i didn't do
[1:21:13] anything to him he goes let's get out of
[1:21:15] here
[1:21:19] he's an atheist oh he hated me
[1:21:24] but he was the one of the best captains
[1:21:26] we have and i would go into a fire
[1:21:27] anywhere with that guy
[1:21:29] see
[1:21:30] separating
[1:21:32] like he said at the first
[1:21:33] separate the church problems from a
[1:21:36] brother and sister it's not them
[1:21:40] praise the lord see our sins would ruin
[1:21:43] us if it wasn't that we are a part of
[1:21:46] christ
[1:21:47] he can't strike the church
[1:21:50] he can't kill you
[1:21:52] because you're part of christ
[1:21:55] you're part of the word you're part of
[1:21:56] the mail this morning oh
[1:21:59] if we can see that this morning if you
[1:22:02] have never accepted him as your lord and
[1:22:04] savior today you can do that right
[1:22:08] now and if you haven't noticed it's kind
[1:22:11] of chaotic outside
[1:22:15] but you don't have to be a part of that
[1:22:17] chaos
[1:22:18] you don't have to be a part of that and
[1:22:20] if if you're sick
[1:22:22] you don't have to be sick oh you better
[1:22:24] watch it brother
[1:22:28] i'm just saying what he said
[1:22:32] you don't have to be a slave to to
[1:22:34] habits anymore you don't have to be a
[1:22:36] slave to your own ideas
[1:22:38] hallelujah do you realize that when the
[1:22:41] anointed ministers up here uh many times
[1:22:45] god allows us to feel your thoughts
[1:22:48] brother paul knows that
[1:22:50] and you think you're being sneaky
[1:22:55] and so
[1:22:57] i'm trying to say is that we're in this
[1:22:59] together
[1:23:01] we're in this as believers as the bride
[1:23:04] of jesus christ and so
[1:23:06] when i came to the revelation as we
[1:23:08] close
[1:23:10] that i don't have anything to offer god
[1:23:14] that's when he says
[1:23:16] now i can work with you
[1:23:19] hey man just like
[1:23:22] just like the ministry
[1:23:25] i didn't want to minister
[1:23:27] i still don't want to minister
[1:23:30] but
[1:23:31] as a pastor you have a you have this
[1:23:33] feeling of love for the sheep and you
[1:23:35] don't want to see them go the wrong
[1:23:37] direction
[1:23:39] but what happens people
[1:23:42] they will criticize us
[1:23:45] because they don't understand us
[1:23:47] because we love you
[1:23:53] even some of my relatives they they'll
[1:23:55] criticize
[1:23:57] oh you think you're so good you think
[1:23:59] it's like
[1:24:00] no that's the farthest thing from the
[1:24:03] truth
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:06] and so
[1:24:10] if you've never accepted christ as your
[1:24:12] savior
[1:24:13] today is the day for that
[1:24:16] come here the musicians
[1:24:23] he is here
[1:24:25] to answer your request
[1:24:30] and if you have gotten a little cold i
[1:24:33] know you say brother rich we've heard
[1:24:34] this over and over yeah but you're going
[1:24:36] to hear it today
[1:24:38] because this could be the last day we
[1:24:40] hear it
[1:24:43] but if you've you've allowed the world
[1:24:44] to suck it out of you
[1:24:47] when
[1:24:48] you're a good person
[1:24:49] you love god
[1:24:52] but he has a victory in your life for
[1:24:54] you this morning
[1:24:56] and it comes
[1:24:57] by his spirit and this word
[1:25:01] and so i've testified you can live this
[1:25:04] life no matter where you're at
[1:25:07] but we have to be with the male and the
[1:25:09] male is the only one that atonement is
[1:25:11] the only thing that will cover your
[1:25:14] your life today
[1:25:17] amen
[1:25:23] we'll have our pastor come
[1:25:27] you can accept all of this right where
[1:25:29] you're at
[1:25:33] but if your faith is
[1:25:35] where you want to get prayed for fine
[1:25:38] or you can accept it there but it's
[1:25:40] whatever our brother allows
[1:25:42] wants to do
[1:25:43] but i want us to search
[1:25:46] can we have just as i am that song
[1:25:50] but i just wanted us to give him a
[1:25:52] little bit of time
[1:25:55] so if
[1:25:57] if if god is tugging on your heart
[1:26:00] see
[1:26:01] not emotion but if god is tucking on
[1:26:03] your heart
