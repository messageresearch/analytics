TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter five and i realize it's a quarter to twelve we had some extra singing but i don't mind them singing extra because it's a blessing to us so we'll be mindful of the time here today i received some text back after i preached last sunday much longer than i normally do and i received some support for that especially when you have people some people driving for two and three hours away um they kind of want their money's worth you know when they hate to say it that way but they don't have anywhere else to go in town so when they come they're ready to stay so but we got a lot of support for that but we'll be mindful of that if the lord comes in a certain way we want to be obedient to him but we are mindful of the time as well we want to leave enough time to for those who want to get down to lima today for the wedding um reception amen esther chapter 5 and i hope i didn't forget any announcements there's quite a few today but my my dad's birthday is today so we give our prayers to my mom and i know she's had a rough few days missing him and so maybe at the end of the service mom you can come up and sing with me and we'll sing a little song there and of thanksgiving to the lord we appreciate his life what it represented to us we miss him dearly and but we we look forward to the reunion someday praise the lord esther did i say ezra did i say esther ezra i said esther so i'm in ezra and you're an esther so i have to get in it would help if the pastor got in the right book of the bible if he's going to preach amen esther chapter 5 and verse 1. now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel what we wear is important to the king came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house so she's positioned herself in the inner court for the bride that's a good place to position yourself in the inner court she stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and this king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight how many this morning want to obtain favor in the eyes of the king she obtained favor because she was in the right place she was in the inner court she she was wearing the right apparel she had the heart that was right and she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand and when a king back then would hold out the scepters one thing it represented all of his power all of his authority and when he held it out to somebody that was quite a significant event so he holds it out to his queen queen and uh the golden scepter that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter that was a great act for her to touch and that means she shared the authority with this king she touched the symbol of his authority so it wasn't just his authority she had the same authority now then said the king unto her will thou queen what what wealth thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom if you wouldn't mind going forward to daniel chapter 7 and we'll read these and get them out of the way and then we'll refer back to them through the sermon daniel chapter 7 and verse 21 and 22 i beheld in the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them this is the antichrist spirit and the antichrist actually becoming incarnate beheld in the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom i love that scripture she hadn't the bride had an enemy can you say amen that the bride had an enemy that made war with the saints but the ancient of days came he gave the people susman he gave them judgment but it wasn't just they were given something the time came then for them to possess the kingdom that they were being given amen i believe it's time for that praise the lord i want to speak on the confession that releases more potentials the confession that releases more potentials father we pray you'll bless your word anoint us strengthen us for the many needs that are here today and listening online we pray that you give us the right words to encourage to strengthen to admonish that we leave here different people than when we came in we commit that to you in jesus name amen once you shake somebody's hand before you're seated and say god bless you personal victories i want to remind everybody that the goal of my preaching the gospel is for personal victories to take place so you should be praying with me that you have personal victories public victories are nice and they get a lot more praise and a lot more attention but personal victories are greater because god gets the glory can you say amen and that's why we preached and i've often said that my ministry is also to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable amen so i've been thinking about since last sunday and then brother marcus preaching on esther wednesday night but i've been thinking a lot about how close that people can come to really receiving something from god and sometimes how that is held back uh sometimes that there's just something there that holds them back just from that step and i've been thinking about how close people can come and i i was thinking also sometimes it's it's just one small little thing that would actually take someone over the top and give them a breakthrough in a certain area and many times that person doesn't realize how uh small a lot of times we think of we're we we're so far from god and we're so far away and we're so and but sometimes and that may be true but remember god is always trying to bring united to him god is never pushing you off god is always orchestrating things in your life that you draw nigh to him but you have to act too and so the bible says draw nigh to him and he'll draw an eye to you so it's not just that he cares but do you care there's two parts to this he cares there's no question about that but does do you care do you care enough to come his direction do you care enough to get to say lord am i willing to give this up am i willing to to see this and many times friends i think it's a very it can be a very small thing that would just give a person a breakthrough in their lives and yet they hold back at that one little spot uh and and i find people that can stop short of their full potential they stop short or their full potential i think the holy spirit knows where he can take his people i think the holy spirit knows your life what's the amazing thing is that he's god he knows all things he knows your life he knows your background he knows your past he knows all things you don't know all things the person sitting next to you doesn't know your life they don't know all things but aren't you thankful this morning there's a person of christ that knows all things about your life it knows your victories it knows your failures it knows what happened with your parents it knows what happened in your past church life he knows all things about your life and incidentally because he knows all that he provides a way to escape all the harm and things that's come to your life including the sin in your life he's provided a way for all of that god knows your life god knows your biography god knows every part of it can you say amen and and he also knows your potential as a predestinated son and daughter of god he knows your potential he knows where the word he said he knows where it can take you sometimes he gives the pastor a little bit of a vision of where he goes because the pastor and the ministers were engrossed in this word and i'm not saying that you're not but we stay in the word all the time praying god help us to get a word of the lord for the people's lives but when we look at the word and sometimes when we look at people's lives and we look at you individually and i may not know your whole life but only what you share with me but i can tell you a pastor even can get a vision of where your life could be and sometimes it's a little discouraging because sometimes it's just a little thing that people went go go get over but if they'd get over that if they'd overcome that they wouldn't realize all the potential they have but god knows all of your potential god knows where this word can take you but people stop short of their full potential and if some knew how close they were maybe from getting the holy ghost they might fight harder if you knew how close you were you might fight harder and press in just a little more can you say amen and press through to get it am i that close let me press through to get it or if you have the holy ghost to press through for greater personal victory to press through to the next level to press through to the next victory can you say amen if you only knew you're not that far away but sometimes it's like breaking the sound barrier and i've talked about it before just before the sound barriers broke in a plane which i don't know how many miles an hour it is but once it breaks that but just before it that plane can shake a little bit it's a struggle and it's getting close to that and it's a real struggle just before it breaks the sound bearer and shoots out that's our lives and someone is shaky someone even in a service gets a little convicted of something but what you don't realize it's not condemnation it may be conviction the lord's saying if you'll just give this up if you'll just lay this down if you'll just surrender your life a little further you're going to break the sound barrier and then you look back after you're going your life is going and you look back and say wow i didn't know i was that close i didn't know what little things the devil was holding in my mind because remember the bible says he's the one who has strongholds in our lives strongholds holding you back and i didn't realize how much the devil was just holding that thing that small thing until i'd break the sound barrier and break through but we want to break through god has many breakthroughs for our lives you may be closer than you think the thing about a seed is that remember how many knows that in a little seed in that seed is all the potential of what that seed will be it's all laying there in potential form and uh it's such a small thing every apple uh every apple that a tree will ever produce every apple that a tree will ever produce is in that seed and that speaks of god's potentials it speaks of what sons and daughters can be it speaks of the enormous potentials that you can't even see in your life and where god wants to take your life as a son and daughter of god and the victories that you can find and and stamping and living a life with the devil under your feet how many would like to live a life with the devil under your feet but you see now the devil holds us back so every every apple a tree will ever bring is in the seed already it's this very small seed and he asked the question and i asked it yesterday i did some research a little research how many apples can that little seed produce in the lifetime of that tree and the average tree i have a picture of the seeds in an apple you don't need a picture you know what they look like but in a lifetime the average apple tree will produce 7 500 to 12 000 apples in its lifetime that's what we find in an apple and so something like this has the potential to produce in its lifetime up to 12 000 apples that's when you eat an apple you're looking at it speaks of god's potentials speaks of what the message can where the message can take you people are so limited in their knowledge it seems like of what we have in our hands with this message it's taken sons of god to their full potential it's taken sons of god to adoption we are in an adoption age an adoption of the church is not the birth of the church it's the maturity of the church it's coming to full maturity the sons of god are being restored back to adam and eve again with full power and authority am i in the congregation that believes these things this morning this small seed can produce up to 7 500 to 12 000 apples in its entire lifetime this little seed so of course everybody has the question can you take just one of the seeds one of the seeds and and and plant one of them and would that grow into it and so they answer the question by saying there's possibilities that even one of the seeds in an apple if it's planted in the right place and if it's germatized correctly one of those seeds can produce up to thousands of apples that's the kingdom of god i don't know if you knew that you probably knew it because i'm still learning things you know you know everything but um i don't know if you knew that that's powerful that's powerful so they if you took that and it was dramatized right and remember you got to have moisture in the ground you got to have rain you've got to have the right kind of light it's got to be the right atmosphere if you think you're a son of god and not and be in the wrong atmospheres all the time you're not going to grow there are atmospheres that the sons of god live in in the word in the right congregation around the right people around the atmosphere of the holy ghost listening to the right music reading the right books can you say man reading the word of god reading the message of the hour and if you don't get in that atmosphere you're not going to grow that seed has to be germatized by the holy spirit if you're a seed of god and so that we know that if they plant that and it makes the right atmosphere to germatize then it comes up through the ground and it's called a seedling so it goes from a seed to a singling it's a little little uh plant that comes up to the ground that's how it starts so you go from the stage to a seed to a seedling and then it grows into a tree we're not we've got no apples yet we've got no apples yet but all the potential for possibly 12 000 apples is in this process that's why i don't believe that a person who receives the holy ghost at the altar one night has overcome everything yet but they certainly have the power to overcome everything when they get up from the altar pentecost taught us that everything's done now hey you spoke in tongues you got the holy ghost you're done you're a fully you're you're you're a finished product only you're only finished the product by the holy ghost sealing the devil out of your soul and sealing god in but you live in the flesh and you've got to grow to adoption and now you have the power to do it and it'll all depend on whether you yield to what's inside of you or not but all the potential of everything you'll ever be is in the spirit of adoption to be adopted you'd have to have the spirit of adoption i'm speaking out of romans right out of your bible we receive abba father we receive the spirit of adoption so that we can be adopted amen oh what happened to my seeds so it goes from the seed i should have got the other stages for you in pictures i didn't have time so you got the seeds you got the seed go to seedling it grows up to be a tree next stage is to grow into branches off the tree no apples yet branches off the tree but all the potential is still there for apples okay then it grows from the seedling to the branch branches come out of the tree and all of a sudden sudden something a little plant starts to butt off of the branch how many remember said jesus said i am the vine ye are the branches it's the bride that bears the fruit it's christ in the people that bears the fruit and then these these apples come out and they grow it's the process finally see some apples and that tree if it's been german charged right taking care of that tree is full of apples but guess what there's still potential for more apples so then the then the next stage is uh bennett's takes it and makes it into apple cider and apple donuts and apple cookies i just thought i'd mention it because god probably didn't endorse those stages but i like it anyway but look at all the benefit that comes from the apples it's like keeps going it goes into those you know it goes into that cider and all of us are over there i've been at barbecue or bitted cider orchard and we're getting that cider brother diggs comes to preach here just for that cider did you know that and the cookies and man but i don't know if god intended for that but i know he intended for it to produce apples and then then when it produces some apples then it dies in the winter time that tree dies and the sap goes down in it and so now it looks like there's the death and it's over it only produced about you know 200 apples it looks like it's over but it's not over the potential is not over and i'm here to tell you as a as a servant of god your potential is not over you have more potentials in you amen and no matter what you've been through and if you go through a death if you go through a dark time in your family if you go through a dark time in your spiritual walk if you're a seed of god you still have some potential in you can you say man that you can grow and produce so much more in christ than you ever dream can you say man to go on and produce possibly 12 000 apples out of this one seed how about them apples there's a quote here look at this few things the prophet said what lays in the bride and then from a little group qualification for our visitors this morning i'll have a couple quotes here from different men one of them will be brother william branham you may not be familiar with that name but we quote from him a little bit because there are some scriptures that were fulfilled for the last days to restore us back to the word and so god spoke of jesus spoke of an elijah to restore all things we personally believe that god fulfilled that through his life but it's not about the man it's about what he restored us back to the word of god if you have more questions about that i am totally available to answer and show you those scriptures today but just so you know that's why we'll quote a little bit from him as well then from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them the bride the bride now through them and by them it will be fulfilled all that was promised for his word in the virgin who knows no man-made creeds or dogmas they will love him love his uh they probably said love is the word there they will love and love his word and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head remember the scripture i read last time he is the head but he is longing to get full preeminence in the body the head christ comes to us the word of god but now we come under the subjection of the full word of god and what's going to happen she has his potential not your potentials his potentials are in you can somebody say amen they will love him and will have his potentials how about them apples next quote says why this church ought to be a million miles up the road listen in 1963 the church ought to be millions of miles up the road to where it is now jesus is waiting on his church to get ready his bride has made herself ready how many knows the bible says that his bride has made himself ready we got the potentials the holy spirit is here god is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all things that christ did i've seen it demonstrated myself by the holy spirit so the potentials are here how about them apples can you say man he said all the potentials are already here i longed to see a church not bound by creeds and dogmas free in the holy ghost how many raised yet how long to see a church rise free of the holy ghost free in the holy ghost and manifest all of christ in this age from the healings from the supernatural to the adopted life of a mature lifestyle in the lord i long to see all of it how about another one want another one the next one let me say that again when this holy spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your internal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential how about them apples how about one more quote the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it now how in the world can somebody say that only because of a revelation of that someone receives the holy ghost they're not receiving some third person of the trinity they're not receiving some other spirit than the original spirit of god than the real thing they're receiving god and uh if you take a spoonful out of the ocean of water every bit of the chemicals every bit of the things that's in the whole ocean is in that spoonful so if you have a spoonful of the power of the holy ghost then you have all the potential within that small spoonful the power that's in you you could speak a world into existence and go live in it hallelujah there you are how about them apples that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law how many knows that we have laws to things the law of gravitation you can't get around it we're all here so we would have you see and we have the law of but he says now it's the law the law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's the law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe so our power that's within us is only limited by how much faith we have i said our power within us is only limited does anybody see here this morning that when he sends the holy spirit to your life it's not just to be a a benchwarmer at a church somewhere it's not to come a hearing sermon that stimulates your intellect god will use you being filled with the holy ghost to continue his kingdom being established in the earth not just a bench warmer in this case a cushion warmer god's called you for a reason god's not called you to be like the world he's called you to be different not to make yourself different you have the holy spirit it's to be different you have a different calling praise the lord should i go forward i wonder who would be behind holding back somebody's potential then who would be behind holding back somebody's full potential well it would if he says it's faith that it's the law of faith that restrains us and our faith is limited so if our faith grows then we grow into the full potentials more and more so who is it that stands in the way who is it it's our enemy it's the devil who is it that's behind the work of holding someone back from their full potential i look at husbands sometimes and i see they're they're they're blocked they're held they're coming to church they're raising their hands they're but they're they're they're stuck in a rut they're stuck there for years and even a desire to get out but your desire you have to put feet on your desire you have to put faith on your desire you have to do something about it because and say well who holds back from your full potential part of it is you people are afraid people don't have enough faith to step out people somebody's put in their minds that i don't want to become a religious fanatic in this message so i they hold back because they're afraid i don't want to be a religious and i want to be embarrassed and i don't want to act a certain way and i don't think that you should put those limitations on god but sometimes it's you because you're afraid you have a lack of faith to step out you won't get to your full potentials because you're not ready to be all into this thing but the enemy uh the enemy is the problem too because he does not want you to go to the next level he does not want you to feed on the word and become all that god's called you to be if and satan knows if faith ignites if faith ignites more faith ignites then it's going to unlock further potentials in you and somehow satan knows how that works after 6 000 years satan knows when people get faith in their position and they get faith in who they are in the word and they begin making decisions to confess and step forward satan knows that every time more potentials and more god comes out of their life and so that's why satan becomes the faith killer satan in your life is your faith killer he's not trying to get you to go out and smoke cigarettes and go out the no no he's trying to kill whatever faith you got and or limit keep you where you're at that's your enemy you're many of you you're at where you're at and uh and i was telling a brother yesterday i hate it when people cap out they've they've leveled out and yet they don't have to level out they've reached a certain level they're in a comfortable spot don't forget i'm the ones to to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable i'm your i'm your friend today you may leave here and not think i'm your friend but i'm not here to just pat you on the shoulder and give you a nice little flowery sermon i'm here to challenge you this morning that you have more potentials and sometimes it's the enemy just holding you right there in your mind i wonder if i can trust wonder if i can hit i know i might have to give this up and you're like sometimes the rich young ruler when he weighed jesus said give up this and you have eternal life and he waited out and his riches was more important than eternal life in other words the rich young ruler thought more about what he would lose than what he would gain and he made a decision because he was thinking about his losses he thought it through i don't know how many minutes he stood there when jesus said that he won't ask for all of us to be different things sometimes he asks us to to get our goat a little bit and challenge us god doesn't do it to be mean but he does it to test you can i have an amen god doesn't put his finger on something in your life say that's that's not right he doesn't do it to be mean he does it to test you you're asking for more of god well how willing are you to get it so for the rich young ruler he may not ask us he asked him to give up all because he knew that's the thing he was tied to big time in his heart and he may not ask us to give up all of our riches of course none of us really have any so he's probably not going to ask us to give it up because most of us don't have it it was a joke how many minutes did he stand there and he's he's struggling it's just i've asked this i came and asked him for eternal life i came i'm the one desiring eternal life and jesus said okay you ask then he goes through the commandments you do this do that just do all the commandments and that was just the first test and he said man i've been doing that since i was a little boy i've been sticking with it man i've been doing these things and so he kept probing i've been doing all these laws since my youth and i still don't have eternal life interesting i've did all the right things for mommy and daddy but i do still don't have the holy ghost so because he kept standing there jesus said all right next step kind of like in prayer lines when you're praying for somebody and brother bryan was praying for people you get them up front and he say do you believe god do you many times he could tell they're a christian do you believe in god you and he took him through do you believe me to be god's servant and he would just take him because based on how the levels of their believing just like the choir saying believe for it based on the levels of their believing brother tony is based upon how much god was going to jump in and heal that person of cancer it's all by believing what's your level of believing this morning what's your level of surrender stood there a few minutes pondered i don't know how long but he weighed giving up this and and he weighed and he he was more interested in his losses and what he'd have to give up than what he would gain i wish she wouldn't do that this morning i wish you'd have a trust in the lord that if he asked you to give up something that you'd have a trust that what he's going to give you blows away what you gave up so if this is true that we're fighting against an enemy then we need to be more aggressive with the enemy we need to be sincere to put our finger on what satan's using to hold us back we need to know there's more of the kingdom there's more potentials there's more in me that satan is holding back and i read esther and i read daniel because both of those texts speak of esther coming to a change in a time where she would have to speak up and then daniel in prophecy the people would come to a time when the antichrist spirit come to a climax and i know that that scripture that i read in daniel is prophecy for after tribulation i understand that but because it says the ancient of days came and because we have a symbolism of the judge coming and looking down and he's got hair like wool like the old judges in england can you say man in other words he comes with supreme authority with the word of god in the last days and when he sends that authority and gives his authority to the church the next stage is it became time for the saints to possess the kingdom not just know about the kingdom not just know that he's given you something but you have to get aggressive to possess it to possess something means you take ownership to possess it means you take it for yourself your dad may get it your mom may not get it your your other friends may not get it but you have to say i'm taking a hold of this thing and i'm possessing this for myself in other words what god has given me it's my own it's mine i possess it i take it satan is robbing me from it and i will not let satan rob me from every blessing and every promise he's got i will not let satan do it any longer i'm stepping up to the plate and i'm taking hold of the full possession of god i'm willing in my heart to possess the gates of the enemy i'm willing to possess the inheritance i'm willing to take it and so we find daniel did that and i don't have much time on daniel today but let's go back to esther since brother marcus was on it wednesday night let's go back to her life a little bit and jump in there again and as we see the story of esther uh you know the story i thought it was so great wednesday night when brother mark said he said you know none of the bible commentators none of the other scriptures paul jesus none of them mention esther martin luther wanted to take the book of esther out he didn't see why it needed to be in the bible none of them talked about it and most of the jewish ones and all they want to take it out because it doesn't mention god in it at all it doesn't refer to god there's no god in it elohim's not there we have this book in the bible of all the books that mention god and everything it doesn't mean god it's just a story of a young girl but i can tell you this morning it's not just a story it's the mystery of the bride of jesus christ your life is written in that story your life is written in there because our biography is in this book your biography don't be looking online for your biography and don't take what your parents said about you and don't take your cues from the world and says you're this you need to wear this you need to do this that's not your life your life is hidden in the mystery of this book how many believe that our names are on the book of life before the foundation of the world and as he breaks the mystery of this bible you will see your name in the book that i'm not like the world i'm a son and daughter of god and when he breaks the ministry for your age and your time whatever the prophecy is for your time and you see that and you get into it i agree with it i'm a part of it and the very reason that i see it and want it shows that my name is in the book praise be to god i feel like shouting this morning i feel like running the aisles praise the lord i got my true biography and in the book of esther something happens after she has become the queen now you could tell the whole story if she's an unknown brother marcus was telling she comes up from you know nowhere and all these women are being tested to be the next bride they all get refused well first of all the the the first queen that he had a type of the denominational systems not the people vashtai was a type of denominational systems that turned down the husband christ in his request the king asked for something and the queen says i'm not coming i'm not doing it rebellion in the systems of denomination it's a type it's all type make it simple for the children the king says to the servant tell the tell the queen to make me a sandwich and the servant runs over to vashti says the king said to make you make him a sandwich and the queen says tell the king to make his own sandwich and the servant goes okay but i don't think the king is going to like it and the king didn't like it so on that day the way they had set things up says she's not even honorable as the queen if we let her do this all the women of the land is going to do that to their husbands [Music] and now this girl they begin choosing and this hebrew girl comes up she comes to the process and mordecai is wondering what's going on mordecai her cousin's gonna what's going on this is exciting i think and so then she gets chosen he refuses all the other hundreds of women and she chooses this girl and a young jewish girl a nobody rises within just 30 40 60 days probably rises from a nobody to be the queen of the entire kingdom who is that the bride of jesus christ see you don't need to read a bunch of interpretations of the bible you just need to read your bible and ask god to reveal it to you because the greatest mysteries lie right in here and she is the bride right to the place so here she is now sitting in the palace as the bride with the kingdom of god and and exercising the authorities of the queen she's the bride it is not a matter of her coming to the lord it's our type of coming lord it's not she's already the bride she's knows everybody she's been chosen she's been called she's in her position as the bride but notice it's not over she's bright but her potentials are still there there's more potentials for esther oh come on now friends she's already bride and she's shouting she's bride and morgan your bride your bride morgan said can you believe this your bride your bride and the king is saying you're my bride you're my bride and says she responds amen hallelujah i'm the bride i'm the bride i wonder how many conventions that we go to i'm bright i'm bright preach the bride and that's wonderful i'm not knocking them but listen even with her position as a bride she still had an enemy she still had an enemy to overcome there's still potentials for her authority laying in her she's still going to use her authority for a greater way somebody say amen already bright but she's not reached her full potential yet even though she's going to a message church and she's going to she's she's claiming to be bride that's fine and she is but it's not done because you haven't reached your full potential a lot of families sitting around within the presence of god within the atmosphere of god tremendous families holy ghost families but i can tell you there's something holding them back and they haven't reached their full potential and you have to realize esther she said these words because mordecai said wait a minute now wait a minute you know what haman's trying to do you know i know your bride esther but maybe god's put you there for more than just to sit in the palace amen mordecai i wonder for such a time as this i wonder if god's put you here to exercise more authority here i thought you were just this is a great thing i wonder if you're to be more than just attending all the message conventions and hearing your bride i wonder if you have more potentials than that i wonder if it's you know not as important to be accepted and to be acknowledged by everybody on the internet and and and and just everybody knows that you know i go to this church and i do this i wonder if there's something deeper that god wants to do in your life than to worry about what everybody else is thinking and praises from other men and i hope people think i'm this and i hope people think i'm that i wonder if you'd step lay that aside and say god has a purpose for putting me in this position and mordecai says now i'm worried now i need to pray pray i'm going to pray it says the aster sends a message to her suppose god has set you up for some at such a time as this and you know what astrid said she said and no mordechai said to her if you hold your peace at this time it's gonna be bad so that's why i titled this confession to bring us to more potentials because he said if and you're allowed you can hold your peace but if you hold your peace this enemy is not going to be taken care of if you hold back and you just leave things the way they are and you don't act because you're the only one who has the authority to act if you don't act and if you hold your peace and you think keep things covered up in the family and you keep things at bay and you keep it if you keep doing that you're going to be the same way 10 years from now if you hold your tongue esther i don't mean hold the tongue if you hold your peace if you don't say something and this is where i was going to read the book of james where it says james says if any be sick let them call for the elders of the church it goes on a couple verses and he says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another it doesn't say to god it says to one another and pray and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man will go a long way availeth much but he's in the process of talking about praying for the sick how many knows that when someone's sick it's a demon the doctor calls it what do you call it but when someone's sick or cancer cancer is a demon kova is a demon don't forget that and we the church are called to pray against demons to cast out demons now do all that you have to do and you know i believe god can heal through medicine i believe that well i'm not condemning anybody today for medicine or anything like that but don't forget don't forget we're not called to just give in to all the science and say i'm going to lean on all the science we're called to deal with demons we're called to pray the prayer of faith over demons so if he says if someone's sick let them call for the elders of the church anointing them with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick when you're praying you're actually playing with authority over demons to drive them away so somehow he brings in here our confession it says confess your faults one to another so if he brings that in there's something related to demons and the devil not liking open confession why do we need to do that james i mean i know you're the do it guy and you're the you're from missouri the show me state james is from the show me state he says i know you got christ but let me see it in actions given to your brother he's from the show he said let me see he's the one that said show me your faith by your works let me see something in your life you've got faith let me see the results so he's a results-oriented preacher and he's saying hey listen confess your faults because there's something related to dealing with demons that confessing and being open even to one another tends to expose the enemy and he starts shaking in his boots there's something about repentance true repentance there's something about confession that's related to us breaking down the barriers to get to more potentials so she says she said pray fast she does all the things she she says mordecai set your people to prayer we're going to fast she and this is how you approach when you're really attacking an enemy like haman we're going to do things we're going to she starts the process of dealing with her enemy she starts by prayers by fasting by sincerity i want to see a real change here and i'm going to go see the king i'm going to go see the king she's going to the right place hallelujah she realizes that naaman an enemy has a place in the king's kingdom and he doesn't belong and she goes no wait a minute wait a minute no no haman doesn't have a place in the king's kingdom he has a place in my kingdom because his kingdom is my kingdom it's not lord did you know haman is over there and he's in your kingdom he's going to disrupt things no it's her kingdom too [Applause] his kingdom is my kingdom and guess what i've got an enemy in my kingdom and unless i open my mouth and do something about it to the king he's going to stay right down in that and agitate and torment because remember a demon is a tormentor another name for a demon is tormentor and he's going to torment and he's eventually going to try to destroy my people destroy me when he finds out i'm a jew he's going to be and so listen before this even gets going and in place i have got to step forth in the presence of the king at the risk of being killed herself because it wasn't right for anybody to come before the king but she steps out do you understand people there has to be a stepping out in faith even when you're afraid i don't know what's going to happen beer but i'm i'm so interested in my enemy being destroyed i've got to step out in faith praise the lord i gotta step out and say she just comes in with the right apparel because the king's interested in the right apparel and that one sentence you sisters and brothers should catch a revelation the king is interested in what you wear amen he has a bible for it men are to dress like men women are dressed like women and there's a bible for it men are to be men and women are to be women it's just that simple in the bible so she has the right apparel royal prayer she steps in the inner court the prophet taught us about the don't be in the outer court don't be in the outside don't the outer in the court holy of holies she got in the right court and the king notices her after a while she has favor with the king and this is a process she invites him over she comes over but she's still a bit scared she doesn't tell the king about it she doesn't expose him then but later on she exposes i'm gonna try to finish this up real soon so i still have your attention so so now she is calling her enemy and the king together to expose him to say something and nobody else is going to do this she has to do it right she has the authority to she has the favor of the king to do it she didn't have to do it but she's recognizing more of her potentials she is position yourself and the king holds out all the authority to her thank god that he did and she has the potential to use that authority to destroy this enemy to confess it to say it to not be silent to confess to speak openly is anybody catching something here this morning you can stay bound your whole life by things but i can tell you you get honest before the lord let me give you some homework i want everybody this week to listen to he cares do you care how many would listen to it and i want you to watch in that how the first part of it there's a couple incidences of people who had something happen in their past and they become a craving to a craving to go to god and be delivered because their past is binding them one woman it was something happened he didn't tell what it was and then there was a a young minister who had just started speaking just got married and he was bound by some complex that happened in his past so they said i'm bound i'm nervous about this they come for prayer and they meet with them god shows them clearly what it is they get delivered and the prophet kind of get felt let of god that there's something churning in me about this subject he cared he care god cared for their situation god cared about their past god cared to see them delivered so he goes into this subject the first part of it is how much god cares now that's kind of a no-brainer to us christians if i said does anybody know god cares everybody raise your hand that's a no-brainer because but the title of the message is not that he just he cares he cares but do you care because you got to get those two things together that you're really sincerely wanted to be sincerely want to be delivered and you're sincerely confessing it you got to bring those two things together and then the devil doesn't like it there's going to be deliverance god can show he cares over and over again in these services he can love you he can show he cares he can you can have something hip in your life and you say god really cared for me he watched over me on that that i could have had an accident today and god was watching over he cares he cares and cares but what about what you care about do you care to live this life do you care to overcome things in your life now we're talking some power and so go through it and then he comes to this crossing over to do you care and he goes right into the subject of confession he said one of the great lacks in the church today is a lack of sincere not just confession sincere confession and repentance so i'm saying it's not just that you hear all that you need to be delivered from and all the glorious things and all the voices in the world and you sit in church and you know that's right that's right that's right that's right there has to be another step so the enemy is destroyed in your life so you read that how many will read it and watch how he goes into that how important our confession is to god amen and to one another this is what exposes the enemy the devil don't like it so the king holds out his authority to esther basically he's saying esther what do you need esther the ball's in your court no just kidding esther the next move is yours that's great when the lord says that and in the next few days she stops holding her piece about it she confesses she exposes haman and then at the end of her life she's given more authority and more potentials to do even more for her people as you'll see in your bible at the end she rewrites the law the king does it she bible says she wrote with all authority and she saved all of her people now she couldn't have done that without destroying her enemy first confession friends that's why i said last sunday sometimes a simple little thing of a husband who's got things to confess in his pornography his hidden life is destroying his family it's destroying his wife it's destroying the marriage and he just keeps going and keeps going keeps going and sometimes just a man recognizing god help me you sit down with that wife that you've committed to for life right you're not shifty eyed and bouncing around you sit with her and you look her in the eye say honey i love you but i've done some mistakes i've messed up this is the way the prophet described it he just said if i went and did that overseas i took an overseas mission trip and i was unfaithful he's talking about their confession he said i don't come back and just assume that she's gonna be fine with it oh honey and you know i i kissed another girl and it's and you're flipping about no no no no that doesn't work you come with sincerity you come with brokenness i'm ready to prepare to expose this whole thing in my life and first to my wife because i've damaged her by doing it you look her in the eye and you repent before her you know i don't promote movies a lot there's there's very few movies that a christian can watch but that one fireproof there's one part i love and fireproof talks about here i am promoting a movie so you have to edit that part out i don't know but i like to pronounce something that's good but sometimes in our ranks it's it's not so there's one part i really like because this marriage is about ready to break up and it's a mess you know they're a young couple and they're just fighting and there's things going on behind the scenes and he's doing pornography on the computer and nobody knows what the tension is but it's just and she's getting she's filing the divorce papers and it's just this thing is ending it's over and so through uh i can't remember his father or mother he goes through this process of learning some things himself and how he needs to be delivered and all these other things and so uh but when he comes and repents to her when he comes she gets sick she's in the bed and so he's going to take care of her and she don't she don't buy any of this stuff that he's doing he's bought her flowers 40 days have given her things he's trying to restore and she hasn't bought into any of it i don't know why you're doing this i'm still getting the divorce it's over i don't trust you anymore and all this time he's given gifts but this day she gets sick and he's trying to take her he brings her soup or something in the bed and he gets down on his knees and she starts crying and she says why are you doing all this i don't trust you why are you doing this i just i just i don't know what i'm going to do but i don't trust you and i just she's just way distant and what i like about his repentance the next few minutes and you you watch it or you don't have to watch i'm not promoting something but i'll just tell you this was probably the best act in a movie of someone who's sincerely just weeping sincere i've done this i have hurt you and he just weeps at the foot of her bed just weeping to her and you can tell it's just from the sincerity of his heart but what i like about it is at the end he's saying she said well i just need time i just need time and he says you take all the time that you need amen a person that's repenting is not looking for a quick band-aid and to get back to everything as usual because he's hurt somebody he's hurt his whole his marriage and in a lot of cases they hurt the entire family it's time to bring it to the forefront and expose the enemy this might be uncomfortable so i don't know but i'm just i love you enough to be honest about it you see i really do and he says that to her and and when the prophet describes if he'd come back from overseas oh girl you you know you're my buddy and he's just this flippant repentance she's not going to accept that but when he goes to say no you should i have failed you and he says these words he says you you may not even stay with me over this. so he's given that person the liberties i'm the one that's done the hurt i'm the one that's done the pain and i may lose my entire family over this and my marriage and if that happens so be it because i'm the one that's done wrong is anybody listening to what i say now we're talking some real real deep repentance because it's not repentance with something attached to it and if you'll do this part we can make this work no no it just needs to it needs to be presented that i have done this and i'm fully making it right and i want to move forward but i'm giving you all the time that you need and honey i love you and i have obviously i don't love you right because i've done these things but i want to love you deeper i put it in your hands and he describes a sincere confession that's what we need after we hear the word of god that's when this church will start getting to its full potential of what a church should be we're doing great we got loveliest people in the world all the new ones the ones have been from day one from the best people in the world i love you guys to death and i'm i know i'm going to spend eternity with you but i'm going to tell you the truth we are not reaching our full potential of how a body should function some of us because somebody just holds back but when you start applying what i'm preaching i do believe there's going to be some things that happen just say god's really working more and more in our midst and he does that and he says i'll give you the liberty whatever you feel to do it'll be it'll be fine i just i just love that look her in the eye your children you sit them down and look them in the eye somebody in the body of christ that you've hold resentment to for years how can you let that go on how can you distance yourself and label that person i don't need to speak that person ever again how can you do that so what you're saying is that the devil between you stays right there and i'm comfortable with him there because i'm right in there wrong when there's a real true repentance there's a flow of his holy spirit it just washes things away you have to die to a lot of pride to do the things that i'm talking about but i don't want to be business as usual i don't want it to be church as usual because we've got something great that god has given us the ancient of days has come and given us his word now it's time for the saints to possess this kingdom you guys got those quotes as we close on repentance i think it's some charles spurgeon charles spurgeon is a minister you know 100 years ago maybe more he's the prince of preachers can i have five more minutes is that all right with everybody all right then i'll just read these quotes of spurgeon we're closing the prince of preachers he was called he did not start out that way charles heiden's burden's grandfather who preached for more than 50 years so charles spurgeon's grandfather preached for 50 years his dad preached for 16 years and they were in this dissenting congregate congregationalist church ministers of puritan heritage in essex england little charles grew up in both mances hearing the gospel many times and loving to read books a spiritual benefit i just want to point out charles spurgeon grew up in a christian home that got constantly christian teaching all the time he easily memorized the catechism and all isaac watts hymns his mother taught him in the bible and prayed with him for him daily although taught by two anglican rectors at the age of 14 both of whom pressed him with the gospel he still denied owning christ as a savior spurgeon describes himself as that time as a as careless and mischievous but not truly born again he said he hoped that god so all that background he didn't give himself the credit that he was born born again yet just because he was raised right and he lived a good life he said i love all this this is great thank you but i'm not born again yet that's honest he said he hoped that god would save him someday he knew the gospel well but his heart was cold toward the lord he did not associate with evil peers or participate in wayward activities but still would not repent of his sins on january 6 1850 young spurgeon was supposed to join his father at the church on sunday morning nine miles from his home he was supposed to be in his daddy's church service and because of a severe snow storm he ducked into a primitive methodist chapel in our literary street close to his home likely few people in england possessed as much knowledge of the scripture heard the gospel more times than charles spurgeon he stated in his autobiography that i had heard the plan of salvation by the sacrifice of jesus from my youth up but i did not know any more about it in my innermost soul than if i had been born and bred a hot and taught he had heard that primitives he had heard that primitive sang so loud it made your headache that might be what you feel about our church here he had heard these methodists saying so loud that it gave him a headache but he didn't care he said i wanted to know how i might be saved and if they could tell me i didn't matter if my headache from the music he's not even getting saved at his dad's church no he didn't the pastor was a no-show from the big snow but a layman got up and read look unto me and be saved all the ends of the earth for 10 minutes in broad essex england the man invited the hearers to look to jesus and he says i saw at once the way of salvation for myself and the holy spirit who enabled me to believe gave me peace through believing following his re-baptism because he was re-baptized and joining a church spurgeon was then called to preach and after that led thousands of souls to the lord praise god he got it for himself and it wasn't through his dad's ministry went on to be called the prince of preachers and here's another thing before i read what he says about repentance i believe this is the one that preached repentance so strong and said that it's not just you repent when you gift your heart to the lord but a christian's life is full of repentance all the time repenting that's what people forget a real baptist way no offense to the baptist but it's just once they do that once saved always saved they gave their heart to lord that's it it's done no no this is a life of repentance this is a life of laying down your life we've got to get out of those doctrines can you say even with the holy ghost once i got it that night everything's done no no no no you begin a life of overcoming and they say he preached responses so strong in his ministry that he retained about 95 of his converts because he kept repenting repentance preaching it to the people that they were a people that knew how to sincerely repent if you take some of the other ministers they didn't retain that many converts that they got including billy graham because maybe back in the 60s there was a comment that says he says i go in billy graham said this i go into a city and i have 30 000 people come to the altar i come back in a year and i can't find hardly any going on with the lord he says it's different billy graham says it's different than when paul was around he'd come out and preach to five people and come back and there'd be five thousand the next year there's something wrong with how we're presenting this thing and i think some of it is there's not enough genuine repentance after the word is preached charles spurgeon says repentance grows as faith grows do not make any mistake about it repentance is not a thing of days and weeks a temporary penance to be got over as fast as possible no it is the grace of a lifetime like faith itself god's little children repent and stowed to young men and fathers repentance is the inseparable companion of faith how many want more faith this morning some of you all right how many want more faith this morning praise the lord next quote another proof of the conquest of a soul for christ will be found in a real change of life if the man does not live differently from what he did before both at home and abroad his repentance needs to be repented of and his conversion is a fiction brother brown says false teachers produce false births people think they had a birth but they didn't really get them because you can't see it in the lifestyle oh boy that's you think i'm a hard preacher good grief the prince of preachers here's laid it down pretty strong his repentance needs to be repented of you need to repent of that repentance sincere repentance is continual believers repent until their dying day this dropping well is not intermittent amen sincere repentance is continual after faith comes repentance or rather repentance is faith twin brother and is born at the same time repentance and desires after holiness can never be separated you have a desire for more of god you have a desire for more holiness never separate it from repentance repentance and faith our faith are distasteful to the unregenerate the unbeliever they would would sooner repeat a thousand formal prayers than shed a solitary tear of true repentance pretty strong i think this is the last one take your heart in prayer to him who understands it and say lord cleanse it lord renew it lord work repentance in it that's a good prayer because it's god that leads a person to repentance did you know that you can't mechanically just do something in your head the bible says god leads you to repentance so your prayers say god give me a broken heart give me true repentance the more you try to produce emotions penitent emotions in yourself the more you will be disappointed however if you believingly think of jesus dying for you repentance will burst forth is that the last one amen that's my last one too let's stand and pray together we're going to pray and i believe that it's not the position of the body it's something my dad said his birthday i'll say something my dad said it's not the position of the body it's the condition of the heart so you're welcome to come this morning and pray up here but it's all about what you speak to him even in your seat right there i love you all and i'm going to pray with you but can you remember that you have more potentials in you of christ you have so much more potentials if we're good parents we tell our kids that we tell our children that we know they have a lot more potential with them and they're acting terrible sometimes but you know they have more potentials because god's made them so if that's true of our children we tell them i can tell the sons and daughters of god you have so much more within you what enemy is holding it back and could it be that you come along with you sometimes i like people to come up and pray because you know what you're challenging the devil that's holding you back together with me or another ministry you're challenging him and saying i mean business to run this devil off you can do that with your wife at home you can do that with your children you can say i'm challenging this enemy who's hurting our family i'm going to challenge them and expose them by confession so that the potential my family can grow so i tell you this is a church that there that if you can pray about this and say lord bring me a true heart of repentance when the word is preached let me not just nod in agreement but let me truly repent if i have done something wrong or if i have a habit in my life something's been laying there 20 years and i haven't dealt with it god don't let me hang on to it let me be honest enough to confess that more potential can come out i'm going to pray for you how many raise your hand pray for me brother paul can you bow your heads with me mom i want you to is my mom here come up front with me here because i want you to sing that song thank you lord for your blessings before we go to thanksgiving this thursday if you close your eyes and just say i do have things that has been in my life
