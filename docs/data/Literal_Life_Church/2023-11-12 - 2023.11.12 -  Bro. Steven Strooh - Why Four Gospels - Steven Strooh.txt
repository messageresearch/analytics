earlier this morning uh while you're standing if we can uh take our Bibles please and uh we're going to read in our Isaiah I see some familiar faces and I apologize in advance brother Howard nice to see you but uh you might have heard this in some form before so you you heard there's nothing new Under the Sun so um this is uh this is one of those topics that's a perennial for me and I have to tell you it's one of I've been looking at for 40 years and it's it's ever new for me it's a I just love this topic I love the theme uh that it is and I've added some of that in now it's going to be very short you know down it's going to be very short and if we have time at the end of course I'll want to sing a few [Music] specials is that sister Sharon um yes anybody who knows knows I cannot sing so um praise God for his grace that uh at least I can do something for the kingdom it's not singing that's for sure so we're going to look at this topic of why are there four gospels but we're going to kind of go about in a roundabout way so let's uh start there in Isaiah 28 and and um if I'm no I'm not mistaken brother Paul used this scripture the other day and uh I was I was thrilled um to to see that um you might recall the context of this is um it says to whom shall he uh um teach knowledge and and and to who shall we make known and it's um those are drawn from the you know it's in so but in this scripture but then the other part of it is for with stammering lips in another tongue will I speak to this people and this is the rest wherewith I'll cause the weary to rest and so this is a very powerful passage for me uh talks about the Holy Spirit baptism that's the real rest and the day of Pentecost was the stammering lips and and the part that's also difficult is that he said um yet they would not hear and and so we we know all of that is true but uh we're on the other side of that we're on the side that can hear we're on the side that does want the knowledge is drawn from the breast right so let's read it together verse n Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine this is the part that's a little bit tricky sometimes is um when the word Doctrine comes up uh people sort of shudder you know they they kind of get oh no you know this is going to be one of those things and I we'll we'll get to that in a second but obviously it's important that that we understand Doctrine and it's them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for and here's the critical thing these next um five six lines on your screen are actually repeating the same thing now when when the Bible uses the limited amount of space it has to repeat something you know it's important right so for precept verse 10 for precept must be upon precept he repeats that precept upon precept that means a principle right line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little but the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept is verse 13 now precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little so it's it's very important that we look at scripture in the right way and that's what I'm going to going to hopefully uh be able to work through uh this this morning what I wanted to to just share is um many years ago a Pentecostal preacher Theologian uh when I was trying to share something with him from the scripture he said no no wait wait wait you can't do that what what can't I do he said look any precept without um uh any sorry uh uh I'll get back to that uh it um with anyway that's amazing that that just left me I'll it'll come back to me in a second so let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to come before your throne we want to give you all the glory Lord all the praise all the honor and Lord anything that's worthy Lord we want to think on those things this morning anything that has virtue anything that's good and pure and and of good report Lord and that's your word this morning we just want to give this time to you Lord we want to devote our our hearts and Minds Lord to to your word and Lord we pray that you would speak your word Lord that as we come to you we know that we have this truth Lord but it does need to be quickened by your spirit and so Lord I just pray that your spirit would move from hot to Heart this morning and Quicken this word in each of us we pray in jesus' name amen you may be seated I got it praise God he said hold on you can't do that any text without a context is a pretext and what he meant was if you're going to preach something if you're going to make up a Doctrine or have a doct you can't take a verse here and a verse there and a verse here and then sort of build a picture out of that because your text has to have a context and uh for a theologian the context could be cultural could be historic it could be the related to the character of the person that you're talking about what type of character they were and all of that becomes the context for the text the the the text without that context to them is just a pretext you're just making it up but the difference is if you have a precept if you have a principle and you're looking at that picture you're looking at that principle while you're reading the verses now those texts do have a context it's not their context but it's a context of the overall picture and when we think of brother bram's Ministry and we think of the message and we think of all the things that we've been taught uh do you notice how much of it is principle based it's picture based he's always we talk about types and shadows right it's picture-based but that's what the Old Testament was for the Old Testament was there for a shadow for for a picture so we can understand so um the Bible says that the law that Old Testament was our school Master to bring us to Christ so you can't understand Christ if you don't understand the context of the Old Testament if you can see how those things particular Enoch uh the ark all of these things are are contexts for the things that we believe when we see the number seven we think of the church ages if we see the number four we think think of the gospels we think of redemption so these are this is what the Bible means when it says precept upon precept and notice contrary to my Theologian friend it's here a little and there a little and it's ly upon line and so now here's the problem I understand where they're coming from because you can get sideways if you don't have the right picture brother renom says this Jehovah jar if you're reading between the lines which we know is a good thing most of the time but you make it say something between the lines that's different than what the lines say then it's wrong all right and how many times have I seen that that somebody would tell me something and I'll be wait a minute there's a scripture that says the exact opposite of what you're saying and that's not right and this morning we were doing the adult Bible class and we're talking about sayings that are not in scripture and and so there's so many things that we say um the one we were talking about a little bit later um was um uh this too shall pass now it sounds comforting I suppose you know it's going to pass um but there's no scripture right that says this two shall pass and in fact you may die right that's true so obviously it didn't pass so you have to be careful that that's actually an old Persian um um myth or uh fa uh that actually developed that saying and then uh in about 1892 uh Abraham Lincoln used it in Wisconsin uh in one of his speeches and so it became part of the the common uh speech that people will uh use that term but I can tell you be careful of slogans you know we live in an age of oh boy I'm off my notes already uh we live in an age of of um of sound buts and and you know if we can say something in two or three words then you know like a text without a pretext the context right if you can say something like that um it has the Ring of truth because it's kind of cute the way it's it's worded this two shall pass it sounds good but when the king had this engraved on his ring uh this two shall pass and he wanted to look at that when he was sad and he hoped it would make him happy and it turned out to have the exact opposite effect and so when we use that term this two Shall Pass we're actually pulling on something that was really not very successful at at at producing the comfort that it was intended to so be careful careful about slogans be careful about bumper sticker theology all right it rarely works it rarely works because it it's the word of God it's Rich it's deep he says drawn from the the breasts you taken wean from the milk this isn't The Superficial kind of gospel that people sometimes and and um you know Sister Sherry I appreciate you your enthusiasm but it reminds me of the number of songs your dad had a lovely saying he said when we were listening to some song or other and he would say well I wish I had written those words and he didn't mean it in other words some songs are very TR they have very little depth they they don't they don't um bring out anything more than we knew before it just seems like pablum just seems like something that you would say so be careful of that we we need to uh faith comes by hearing hearing comes by the word of God if we want to encourage somebody in the scripture let's tell them he's the friend that sticks closer than a brother he'll never leave you nor forsake you all right these are the scriptures that people can hold on to that will give them true Comfort all right so brother Brandon says don't say what you think is between the lines and it's different from what's on the line so when it says line upon line here a little there a little yes there's an implication that we're looking between the the thoughts in the scripture and we're finding more in there than maybe is expressed in those verses but you can't say something that contradicts scripture all right so then brother renam goes on to say this the Bible is just like a great jigsa puzzle you've got to have something over here to look at if you don't you'll have a cow picking grass on top of a tree all right I'm not much of a jigsa puzzle person but uh I used to get frustrated my parents loved the 5,000 piece puzzle oh my goodness put it out on the dining room table we had to eat on our laps for a month and it it and you know every every time somebody walked past they they got a piece and they they puzzled over where it might go and my trick was just to take a piece that looked close and bang it into place and I've noticed that some people do that with the scripture if it doesn't fit they use the uh the Mallet method um and uh they just force it into place and it doesn't matter if the cow is eating grass on top of the tree I got that piece in all right and I think what put me of jigel puzzle pieces by the way was uh when a piece got lost and we didn't know it that was too frustrating for me so when you look at the scripture here a little there a little we're looking at the pieces of the puzzle and this is how theologians work unfortunately when they're trained they're train to take the scriptures and let them speak for themselves you've heard that expression all right so they take the verses they take the fact that there's four Gospels and they never take the time to and i' I've read quite a few articles actually this week why four gospels they called that and it's anything but what we're going to talk about this morning it's like they're taking the pieces and trying to look at them like you might be looking at these pieces going I wonder what that is now Kathy my art historian wife uh picked it out in about 5 minutes it's not even about 15 seconds does anybody want to compete with that last supper is that what you said and that's it the last supper now fortunately we already have that picture in our mind the last supper so we look at some of those things there's some of them specifically that remind you of the last supper and that's how we approach scripture we've got the message Mage we've got the picture we understand the godhead we understand a lot of Concepts from the scripture and so when we're reading these verses we're going oh I know where that piece goes all right but what if we had never had that picture how would you know what that is how would you know where those pieces went together and that's only six I can't remember 24 pieces or something imagine all the verses in the Bible what a what a a challenge that would be and that's why these theologians study for so long all right they got to work out where all the pieces go so if you see the picture on the box Oh What A Difference it makes right wow now we can all right I I'm looking okay I see that's part of the ceiling and so and so forth um one of the big disappointments for me is looking at this picture is that if you go and see uh the Last Supper in situ it looks terrible it's all ated and it's it's hard to recognize it doesn't look like this if I'm you know so I'm like oh wish should look like this but you know it actually is painted it's a fresco it's painted on the wall and it's very dull and they keep the lights down low to preserve it and oh well but we've got the picture so we know how these pieces go together so we're going to look at why there's four gospels but we're going to start with how many bibles God wrote now this isn't new for most of you but I hope in the context it'll make sense why we're doing this so first of all um it's nice that they all begin with the G makes them a little more memorable so the gospels right so it's the galaxies God's first Bible was in the stars and then his the next Bible was the pyramid that's the granite it was made of a beautiful pink uh granite and then uh there's the gospels themselves of course and then of course there's uh the Gentiles the the Gentile church and in each case God was um expressing himself he was writing a Bible right he was it was uh he was um so God can't change God can't add knowledge all right so when God knows something he he knows it all right everything so whenever he does something he's expressing what he already knows so when he's going to going to make uh the Stars when he's going to make the Zodiac in this case he he's going to do it completely consistent with uh what he knows uh about uh the word and that the word is always surrounded by four bodyguards right so when he makes uh the path of the earth through the the the solar system when it goes around the Sun different constellations are going to come to you know to to look um bigger in the sky they're going to appear in the sky and there's going to be 12 of those because 12 can be divided by four so you can divide it into four different regions God knows that so when we have seasons he doesn't have Five Seasons or six seasons all right so after the flood when the seasons were first there were no Seasons Before the Flood the way they knew the season was by looking at the Galaxy looking at the stars looking at the zodiac and so after the flood was the first mention of summer and winter and and spring so the four seasons are mentioned but it's not five and it's not six and it's not three that's the that's the key because the Sun the s o n is the center of our solar system and we know the scripture talks about the sun of righteousness Rising with healing in his wings so God is equating this great big sun in the sky with his word and when people tell me there's three Gods I always want to ask them how many sons do you see because if there's only one Su n there's only one center of the universe there's only of the solar system there's only one God so the first was the galaxies then in Granite the pyramid then of course the gospels and then your seven churches in Asia so let's look at that verse in Genesis 1:14 you can read it on the screen or you can turn to it and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years so you might recall the previous verse God says and uh he made the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night and he made the Stars also you'll notice he used the word made not create so when people want to argue about the days of creation they get this all mixed up because the creation took place in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the next time we see the word creat is when he's making the living organisms so it's important that we know the difference so when it says God made the sun moon and stars he's not saying he created them he's saying he made them for a purpose he made them to do a job he made the sun to rule the day he made the moon to rule the night he made the Stars in this verse for signs and for seasons and for days and years he didn't create the sun moon and stars in the fourth day as uh some people are inclined to think but it's important that we know that God intended us to look at the stars and see them as signs in other words we can read the Stars just like he told job re tell the Stars if you can and then another place name those Stars and then he talks to to to to job about the names of the stars he says who can bring forth uh mazero in his season or gu Urus with his sons or bind the sweet influences of pades so this is God challenging Moses on these signs so it's no point in US ignoring them God thought enough of them to actually challenge job on the signs in the Stars so that was his first Bible we haven't got time to spend on all these uh topic so we're going to have to rush ahead and then the next one is there's this beautiful scripture in Isaiah which talks about an altar in the midst of the pillar of the land of Egypt a pillar at the border that's the border between Upper and Lower Egypt and it'll be a sign and for a witness so here we come back to the concept of a sign so this is the picture remember we we've got the picture on the box we know we're looking at uh these four gospels Jesus is the center of those gospels now how does the pyramid inform us how does what does it help us to understand as we look at those things uh that God did and see how is that uh relevant to how we understand scripture so I don't have time to go into that today but I do want to just share with you this sometimes people get confused when they see the word pyramid because they think of the the three-sided New Age crystal pyramids all right that you hang for the energy whatever anyway and uh that that's not this right that that's that's not this this this is the Great Pyramid in Egypt and uh it's got nothing to do with new age C Crystal Theory or whatever it is but what is interesting is that it has four sides not five six three it's got four sides and it's also missing the Capstone so already we're getting some of this picture that we're looking for when we look back at these things that God has done and we say how does that fit with what I know and one of the things we know is that six is the number of man now sometimes it's hard for people to visualize this but if you look at that pyramid how many sides does it have so it's four sides there's a flat on the top so that's a side and there's obviously the flat on the bottom so that's a side so the the pyramid as it is now has six sides and what is it what does that represent what do we learn when we go into the pyramid is we learn it has to do with uh the the the um the Gentiles and the Jews are are represented in that pyramid and there's so many lessons that we can learn I call it the the messages in the passages because there's so so much that we can learn from that pyramid But ultimately what we know from the the the Revelation that we have today again this is that picture that we have is that there's a Capstone that's supposed to be on this pyramid now the Capstone is a miniature pyramid the only difference is it only has five sides all right there's the bottom and the four sides now what's beautiful about that is that when the head comes to the body whoops I'm going backwards when the head comes to the body to to unite with that body that six-sided pyramid now becomes a five-sided pyramid so when the Capstone comes down on that pyramid now we have that same Grace virtue Mercy all those five words five letter words that we associate with Jesus all right and so you can see how these pictures help us not so much to see what the scripture means but to have confidence that we have the right picture when we look at those scriptures so if if this didn't work out if this was six and seven and eight and nine and all kinds of other weird numbers I wouldn't be here talking about it because it wouldn't make any sense but the fact that it does make sense that this is one of God's Bibles is is why I find it so exciting and I and I like to share it because it gives us confidence in the Precision of scripture and the Revelation that we have today and we see them coming together in unity and that um seems to override any other um issues that we may think we have because we can say well this is this is not happen stance so if you think of Christ as the Center of this pyramid then we would expect it to have four sides and that would be those four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John right so no no time to go into all that but let's look at the church so the Gentiles would eventually form those seven Church ages and what do we see going through those Church ages from Revelation chapter 6 we see the The Lion and the ox and the man and the eagle that those different anointings of Christ's spirit that were on those ages showing that the word is at the center of this Gentile church and that's what he said when he said that that that Jesus was in the midst of the Candlestick so if Jesus is in the midst of the Candlestick we have to see the four uh body Gods if you like that would surround him just like we do in the pyramid just like we do in the galaxies all right it makes sense right if you have the right picture it's going to fit everywhere all right so when God began building his church on a firm foundation where there's no confusion or chaos as I heard sister Gabby singing this morning all right it's on a firm foundation it's on four gospel pillars most foundations that we look at the basic Foundation is for corner of a of a building doesn't matter how many how they manipulate it but generally that's the standard all right and so God used the four gospel pillars as the foundation for the teachings of those 12 Apostles all right now that should make you think H the New Testament is the Old Testament revealed so if God's using four gospel pillars and 12 Apostles hm maybe we'll find out something as we go through this and then of course this is the the the the um the uh the the church ages and these are those seals these are the the lion the ox the man and the eagle and we're right there at the end where it says catching away and uh unfortunately I only have question marks there um I can't tell you any more than that and if I could you wouldn't have me here all right so where did this whole start start so this is one of those things that we want to make sure that we have uh it straight from the end to the beginning brother Ram often said from Genesis to Revelation and you know it sounds grandiose to say that like we're going to take the whole Bible you know and we're going to unravel it like like uh these threads and we're going to make it all say the same thing well that's a tall order unless you have the right picture unless you've seen the picture on the box now we can go back to Genesis and say okay I know what that serpent was I know what he did because I read it in Revelation amen that's because in Genesis it's just the seed form it's just like almost invisible I challenge anybody to take an acorn seed and look at it and visualize an oak tree all right you can't you can't do it all right once you've seen the oak tree it's like oh I didn't know that that was all inside that Little Acorn all right so you you look go back to Genesis and people say well I don't see what you're seeing' well it's because you don't have the picture and and that's why this is so important that's why I love this study so much so the picture in the in the Garden of Eden is when they sinned there were four cherubim that were placed in the garden and they turned each way all right how many ways are there geographically speaking north south east west right so there's four ways and they kept the way does it say to the tree of life I think that's the picture we get and especially if you if you're looking at a drawing in a children's Bible or something they'll show you this little path with the with a beautiful Eden in the background and the thorns and thistles growing in the front right and this is the path to the tree of life but it doesn't say that it's the way of the tree of life and and brother Brenham talks about that but these uh cherubim and this flaming sword keeping the way of the tree of life is referenced in Ezekiel where he talks about those four living creatures and then he talks about the cherubim uh in chapter 10 and he says those are the same ones I saw when I was by the the the river of kah all right so kind of got the picture those cherubim uh keeping the way of the Tree of Life uh each way that means there's four ways so if Christ is the tree of of life that's the center of the uh of of uh that story of of Garden of Eden all right well then we would expect to see these four guards uh bodyguards around uh that tree right and we'll see this picture come up now that's in Genesis now we're kind of doing the wrong thing we're looking at that Genesis and we're creating this picture of four cherubim we don't know if there were four doesn't say there were four cherubim but when you have the picture you can come back to this and say ah there were probably four cherubim because they went each way all right well the Flaming sword went each way so brother Brandon said these cherubim were by the way anyway cherubim is a plural word by the way cherub is the singular cherubim is plural so cherubims is plural plural anyway but that's that's the way it is in the scripture so that's fine to use cherubim and these cherubims were placed at the East Gate of the garden going four ways cherubims were placed there to guard the way of the tree of life the way he says who is the way isn't that beautiful so now we get a an understanding that it's God himself who's protecting his word he's not leaving it up to some some cherubs right or cherubim if you like he he's taking care of it himself and that flaming sword that reminds us of the two-edged sword of his word and so it's his word that's protecting the way of the tree of life so if we don't find Christ it's because we haven't come his way his provided way is the way we would see it so we can see how this all fits together so beautifully so if you have the picture it's really easy and these patterns and principles that we've been looking at up until now they form a picture and so if you have the patterns that can tie this all together we can place those position those pieces correctly now why is that important it's because we're part of that word and as we heard uh recently in the service we're to be positioned correct directly so I'm going to take just two minutes on that when those Stars sun moon and stars were made to do their jobs in Genesis chapter 1 on the fourth day remember the first day there was chaos Darkness was on the face of the Earth then the SEC and then light struck the Earth all right and the second day the atmosphere changed now there was an atmosphere where life could exist the firmament above and the firmament and you know the story and then the dry land appeared so now there's a bedding ground for that seed and so that seed that was already in the earth now had the right environment it had light it had water it had an oxygen atmosphere that it could grow in and so guess what the seed starts to grow the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit is seed is in itself and they started to grow and produce again the seed that was in them this is all just like us all right Hank Williams I Saw The Light all right he could have been back there writing that song All right so when the atmosphere lifted off the Earth that solid water and it turned into water vapor with a beautiful mix of oxygen and nitrogen we won't get into right now but that actually created the atmosphere in which that life could come into the seed so God said let that seed bring forth of its kind all right now the atmospher so that's the third day so justification I Saw The Light sanctification Separation The Waters from the waters Waters from the dry land Third Day Life came into those seeds that's the baptism of the Holy Spirit now what happens on the four fourth day he positions the sun moon and stars so having been Justified Sanctified baptized Holy Spirit God now makes us do something he places us to be something in the world a light that others can find their way Jesus said now you are the light of the world and so as God positions us that's why it's so important to have that understanding of your position is that others can then take their direction from you so it's like you're a constellation when you're properly positioned and they look up and they say oh there's the Big Dipper or there's Orion or there's the pades or there's Urus all right they are saying that way is the way we need to go because now they have direction from the Stars when do the stars come out out when the Sun goes away so our roles don't mean much if Jesus Is Here In the Flesh all right but it's when he said the Night Comes when no man can work when that when that happens now our little lights shine and that's why this is so important because we're like those little pieces of the puzzle being properly positioned to tell the right story because if we're ambassadors of Christ and we're not telling the right story we're not representing Christ in a way that people can trust right so if you have the picture H this isn't helping right because none of you can tell me what that is all you brght Sparks that knew this was uh D Vinci earlier um but I guarantee you you don't know what this is challenge all right nobody gets the the the the prize all right you have to have some kind of a picture and that's what looking at the verses of the Bible can be like so all right so there's the picture well it's it's okay but um sometimes we don't even have the picture we just have the shadow of the picture all right but even the shape or the shadow will help us to understand what we're trying to make all right so now the light bulb went off I think all right and so we know what the shape is that these pieces are trying to make so first thing we want to do is we want to make sure we're looking at the scripture in the right way rightly dividing the word of Truth turning the the scripture at the right angle so we're not putting the cow on top of the tree we want to make sure that we're looking at the scripture and saying okay now this is a Redemptive scripture or this is uh something from the law are we making sure that the the verses are properly um oriented before they get positioned they have to be oriented just like we as Believers we need to be properly oriented before we get placed all right so now when we move those pieces into position now we've got a picture that uh what was actually that original picture that I showed you a couple of slides ago that made the shadow so this is the reality that made the Shadow and the shadow was enough for us to inform us of how to put these pieces together that's how we're looking at the four gospels for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image so sometimes when you're looking at a type or a shadow uh people might say well uh Joseph wasn't sold sold for 30 pieces of silver he was sold for 20 pieces of silver but you know that's not exact you know no it's not meant to be exact because it's if it was exact he would have been Jesus all right so it's very it's very important that we understand uh how this uh how this uh these patterns work and then Isaiah 8:20 another one of my very favorite scriptures to the law and to the testimony that's the testimony of of the prophets if they speak not according to this word the absolute not the madeup one not some idea of man but the absolute word of God based on the law and the testimony it's because there is no light in them and light often means understanding so when that previous verse read who shall he make to understand understand Doctrine uh Jesus said uh He who reads uh Daniel the Prophet Daniel he said let him understand there there's a time that we have to we can't just take things at a superficial level we can't just take the milk of the word we've got to dig a Little Deeper we've got to go for understanding all right understanding doesn't mean repetition so sometimes I hear people repeating a scripture and they have no idea what it means they they don't have that understanding and that's what the scripture is encouraging us to do is to have understanding and if you want to have understanding you've got to be able to put together the Old Testament as our school Master to bring us to Christ now there's something interesting about this pattern of four is we're going to find that of the four things that we're going to look at three are the same or at least have similar characteristics and one of them is different and how is it different those who've heard me before do you remember oh good nobody remembers that's great it's all fresh right a okay so one out of the three out of the four is Gentile or has a gentile connection that's really interesting because it's going to come up in the four gospels so let's look at this testimony of the prophets remember that's what it that's what we read if we want to have understanding we need to be able to go to the law and to the testimony so let's look at these uh four uh prophets please don't call them Major Prophets because that implies that the other ones are Minor Prophets and I defy you to go up to habac and call him a minor Prophet or Micah or some of those that you might not even have read their book and you'll be embarrassed when he asks you have you read my book we better make sure we've read his book so Daniel and you'll see the parentheses around there uh that Curly brackets means it's the one that's different and so out of this group of Isaiah Ezekiel Jeremiah and Daniel Daniel was the one that prophesied from a gentile Kingdom had the position of a gentile Ruler all right whereas the other of course were strictly Jewish or um either Israel or Judah prophets and so you can see right away we're getting this picture God's going to build this this uh this uh knowledge and understanding based on the prophets and there's going to be four of them and they're going to have the characteristics of the L oops of the lion the man the ox and the eagle but I don't have time to get into that now but if you want to do that for homework take those books and think about I'll give you one clue Jeremiah was known as the weeping prophet all right and he wrote the book of Lamentations all right so you can see how that would Place him in the ox category the Beast of Burden the the the sacrificial uh animal the one that works until it can't work anymore and and then gets roasted on a fire thanks very much no no putting out to pasture for a good uh healthy Ox right so that's Jeremiah now think about Isaiah and and I'll give you another clue Ezekiel how was he referred to what does God call him every time he wants to reveal something to Ezekiel thank you son of man how many times almost every time son of man son of man son of man son of man all right so you can see this was intentional and of course Daniel he's writing about Revelation right he's got that eagle anointing on him right to be able to see far all right have that eagle Insight so when we look back at Ezekiel 1:10 we find out that these cherub had the the these four faces and it was the lion the ox the man and the eagle so when we see this we're thinking hm there's there got to be something relevant about these four living creatures and we've got four gospels maybe they tie together so brother renom says did you think that God wouldn't put a guard around his word see if that Ox Lion Man Eagle isn't it still sitting at those Gates right here on Earth right now they're the four gospels so when we go back to Eden What's protecting the way it's those four gospels it's the Ministry of Christ we've got to go through Christ he's the door to get to that tree of life and the tree of life is Promised it's in Revelation he'll Grant to eat of the Tree of Life as one of the the gifts to an overcomer so when we get to Revelation now Revelation is all about symbols so we see that uh there were four living creatures four beasts there's a different word for bad beasts uh by the way uh in the in the Greek this is the the good beasts this is the one that translates as living creatures so there were four beasts or living creatures around the Throne all right in heaven that's what Daniel uh John was seeing in Revelation chapter 4 and the first Beast was like a lion the second like a calf or an ox and the third had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so sometimes we see two different types of differences in the four so in this case the fourth um uh creature is a flying eagle leaves the ground so that would make him different from the other three but when we get to the gospels we'll find uh that it's a different uh uh one of those uh four living creatures that is different now we're going to um skip because this is really important if we know God's plan and how he's setting up the the protection the gateway to the Tree of Life guess who else knows it and we heard this the other day that Satan is going to try and deceive he's going to try and set up a different uh narrative a different story he's going to have a different interpretation of the facts all right this is his mission he's called the adversary Satan means adversary his job is to oppose God so if you're a heavyweight uh title uh um candidate you want to take on the heavyweight champion of the world and uh the fight is set for Las Vegas all right you're going to go to Las Vegas to go and uh challenge the champion you're not going to go to Miami if the fights in Las Vegas you've got to go where the champion is if you're going to contend with that champion if you're going to be an adversary you've got to be in the same ring that God's in and so guess where God is guess where the ring is all right don't be surprised big Target on our back all right he knows where God's operating and that's where he has to operate because that's his job he's the adversary he has to oppose somebody somewhere something and so Satan has his system at work again to get people to misbelieve and I like that not disbelief it's actually important that he says misbelief the word of God it's it's Satan's wrong way of worship all the way through scripture we know that Satan has tried to impose his worship on the people right from the Garden of Eden right from deceiving Eve not telling her that God didn't exist Satan's not an atheist I mean imagine how bad you have to be if you're not even like Satan anyway so Satan's not an atheist all right he believes in God all right um but he wants to worship God in his own way he doesn't want to follow God's provided way and that's how Satan's Eden came about now now I'm going to show you who those four Messengers are to Satan's Eden because he knows it needs to be four Messengers he knows that's the trick if you want to if you want to you know get a program going and you want to build something you got to have these four foundations to build on all right so it was Satan's wrong way of worship how successful has Satan been as we try and get through the year 2023 I put it to you he's been extremely successful sadly successful and not just in the violence that we see around the world but in the subtle ways in which he has influenced people to misbelieve and I've got three books that I've kind of grayed out because I don't want you to read them but there there're three books out of hundreds of stories from celebrities pastors musicians I'm thinking of Hillsong unfortunately all these major Ministries and the ones I looked at were not you know people never heard of that had turned their back on God and said we don't believe anymore we're not Christians and these were pastors these were evangelists these were people with mega churches and they came to the conclusion we don't like what we see now there's a reason that that happens and it happens because of what the influence they allowed now when God has an influence which is by his Spirit on his messenger for this day Satan's opposing that with everything that he has if you don't have the right picture that's why I think this study is so important if you don't have the right picture if you're not looking at that in the right way and Satan comes along with a a little different perspective how many times do you hear that and and think of the words we hear these days it's so frightening uh well that's your opinion or well you know I have to I have to do me you know I just learned that last weekend you do you boo so you do what you do but got nothing you know I'm not I don't agree with it but I'm not going to say anything so that's terrible you never want to say that when people say oh it's my truth it's like what did you franchise it I mean do you have a patent on that truth and what does truth mean anyway if there's if there's 10 of us and we each have our truth there's 10 truths but there is only one truth for example I'm standing here this is my favorite one the people from line will remember this I'm here I'm standing here today this time that's the truth now if I wanted to make up something how many places could I say I am in the world and that would be my truth but it's not the truth the truth is I'm standing right here that's the only truth about where I'm standing right now amen so you see how important it is that we don't get sucked into this terminology especially when we know intuitively there's something wrong with my truth but we don't really understand what's so significant but when you see what happened to these poor fellows from all different walks of life prominent people that gave up their faith and why is it it's because they came under the wrong influence they came under the influence of Satan's four Messengers now I've been preaching this since the late 880s and I've been talking about these four guys since the late 80s and the strangest thing happened I was preaching for brother Jason uh in uh Buford and as I left uh went through the airport I looked at the news stand and there was a whole thing just covered with uh these special um magazines from us news and World Report and it's and it was called um three Minds that shaped the 20th century and I'm they stole that that's that's my stuff and so I had to buy it I've still got a couple by the way I bought those magazines I was like that's incredible now of course it was the 20th century so that didn't include Darwin but if you're going to talk about people who influenced uh the world for Satan you'd have to throw Darwin into that and so these were the four Messengers and it covered a variety of subjects philosophy science psychology economics politics education just about every field that you you can hardly study anything at University and not run into this uh these kind of uh influences all right so we again uh looking at the time H so the mind we haven't still haven't got to the four gospels so the minds that shaped Leo deia are that convinced them that they are poor wretched miserable blind and naked and don't know it something influenced them to think like that and it's these four guys Charles Darwin Carl Marx Sigman Freud and Albert Einstein and of those only Einstein kind of still retains something of a reputation the other three guys I'm just jumping ahead so sorry time is against us so these World Views that we have been influenced by and those poor Christians that couldn't hold on to their faith didn't have the keeping power they were coming under the influence of Satan's Messengers whether they knew it or not and you can ask anybody those four names that I just mentioned Darwin uh just trying to go in order uh Marx Freud and Einstein uh there's almost nobody that you can talk to that hasn't heard of those four guys all right and especially in education so Albert Einstein is a little bit different in this case he's one with the curly bracket uh for um for the reason that even though he wasn't a Christian he wasn't even a theist he was a deist uh deist means um it's like the god of Spinosa um the idea Einstein believed that God created the universe verse but he sort of wounded up like a clock and then left it to unwind so God doesn't interfere or intervene in the Affairs of people right he leaves it uh I suppose to the scientists um but um that was the way Einstein understood God which is at least a little bit different from the other three so these guys were discredited and one of the things that they did all of them was they refuted a Biblical basis for a worldview so Darwin uh wanted to create a story where there wasn't a Creator all right and that's where he came up with the idea of evolution so we'll just keep uh going so even though the founders the heads if you like have been loed off these these ideas these philosophies uh the monsters that they created live on and that's what you're running into if you're ever ever in any kind of an academic environment where you're not paying attention you'll actually see these things uh very clearly um one of them is um you've all heard of the playwright George Bernard Shaw um My Fair Lady right right so imagine my shock and horror when I discovered um who he was so these monsters based on secular humanism is idea is that man is the center of the universe we are masters of our destiny all right everything revolves around us and the way we've evolved as a society is to take care of number one that's that's the basic philosophy and so Carl Sean is f is famous for saying the cosmos is all there is and all there was or ever will be wow so so instead of that being Jesus the it's now the cosmos it's now the creation so they worship the creation instead of the Creator all right very scriptural statement Mr Sean Dr San so the law is our school Master to bring us to Faith and if we don't speak according to the law in the testimony there's no light in us so let's go back and look at the Tabernacle for a second brother Brenham talks about the four living creatures around the Tabernacle you can see I'm rushing and uh that's the lion on the east side um that was the tribe of Judah was the center of those three tribes and then you had Reuben who's the uh man uh on the uh let's see that would be uh East that would be North and and then you've got Zebulon that's the ox over on the west and then on the south you've got Dan and so that's the way they were arranged and what was in the center C of that Tabernacle or the heart of the Tabernacle or the primary object in the Tabernacle it was the 10 commandments it was the word of God that was in the Ark of the Covenant with that word in it that Ark had um had uh that uh um role of being where the shakana glory would come down and so if you're going to have God present you got to have the four living creatures so we're getting this right it's and it's there so we mentioned about God building on the four pillars of the four gospels where did we get that idea well when God was building his nation of Israel he started with four Patriarchs we all know Abraham Isaac the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph now generally when we read it in the scripture only three are mentioned but we know now that Joseph was a patriarch because he didn't get a tribe he didn't get land his land went to his two sons same as Israel so that's what makes the patriarch it makes him one of the fathers of the 12 tribes cuz he had two tribes that uh were given land that were his sons so those are the four Foundation uh Stone Stones if you like that God was going to build the nation of Israel on and who's the odd man out it's Joseph again why is that because he had the same role that Daniel had he was married to a gentile he lived in a gentile Kingdom he was a ruler in a gentile Kingdom and so though he was a Jew his primary role in life his primary mission was in a gentile context so you see three Jews one Gentile three Jews one Gentile that's very interesting I wonder if we can make that work and then what did we build on those four Foundation pillars we built the 12 tribes and that of course led to the nation of Israel so when God's going to build his church we said he is going to start with these four gospel pillars he's going to add the 12 apostles and then of course we know that we have these four living creatures we got to weave into the story somehow and you know what's really interesting this concept has been known in Christianity since uh the very earliest days I can't tell you the exact years of any of these um things but you can go to Europe go around Italy you'll see these things everywhere first time I saw it I was in a church in um I was a church in Germany uh cologne it was a big cathedral in Cologne and they had a cross hanging above it's a Lutheran church and they had a cross hanging above the the the the pulpit and it had four living creatures around uh the center and the center was a Bible so it's really interesting that this is a well-known concept and even Bibles that were made in those days were made with the four living creatures around Christ in the middle so this isn't new this is very well known so brother brandham says this in Revelation chapter 4 series The Acts of the Apostles were inside and these gospels are the frame work to hold it together and to protect it so just going back to the tree of life going back to the Garden of Eden going back to the pyramid it's the same story over and over again is that Christ is in the center with these four living creatures around and we see a beautiful picture of that in Revelation chter 4 now he says did you think that God put a guard around his word see if that Ox Lion Man Eagle isn't still sitting at those Gates right now here on Earth as we read earlier they're the gospels the four gospels see guarded on every side guarding this Holy Ghost Gospel that's why there's four so we can stop now 12:41 so I told you to be short but if I stop now I'm going to sing so I think I should keep going so it's God guarding his word now think about that God you would think his word would be able to take care of itself of course it can but that's not the pattern the pattern is God's going to have his spirit in four different character characteristics of these four living creatures guarding his own word protecting the way of the tree of life and it's not going to be by happen stance or by accident or by any other method that we find our way to the tree of life it's going to be because God allowed it because he's the one who set up the framework to protect that word and so when we see people not understanding scripture they're not ordained to understand scripture and uh I've left all that out of the study just because of the time so when we see Jesus the word we're always going to see the these four living creatures and the lion represents the king the ox the servant the man the humanity and the eagle the spirit so let's look at the four gospels then the lion the ox H he's the one with the curly brackets huh man that's Luke and Eagle why is Luke the odd man out here because he was a gentile unbelievable very strange I didn't understand this when I was a child I was like what bad Gentiles dogs what's he doing writing one of the the gospels absolutely essential that he was there to write that because it would have broken every shadow from the Old Testament because there was always a gentile representation all the way through the Old Testament we've seen it over and over again so when we look at our lives and we wonder how did I get here by absolute divine Providence God intended us to be here he intended there to be a gentile church and is going to be without spot and without blemish a glorious church and it doesn't matter what Satan says and it doesn't matter how many messenges he sends to distort the word and to get people to misbelieve and how many Christians give up their faith we're going to be there because God intended it and he's protecting the word in us we'll get to that and this is especially for brother Brandon because uh he's going to enjoy this part all right so how many soldiers stood around the cross when Jesus was crucified now we all know about when they cost lots for his outer garment all right but how many soldiers were actually there there were four soldiers CU it says and made four parts and to every every Soldier apart so there could only be Four soldiers there couldn't be six soldiers they couldn't be a platoon there couldn't be two I mean how many people do you need to guard a guy nailed to a cross all right really how many gospels do you need wouldn't one be sufficient two Two's A Witness but four Overkill uh-uh no it's a pattern it's a principle precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little and if we have the picture and it's the right picture brother Adam says we're reading between the lines make sure it's also on the lines if it's the right picture it has to follow all the way through scripture Genesis to Revelation praise God so now I'm going to take a little step on the Wild Side here this is not in the message on just letting you know however I believe it's consistent with the principle and the picture I'm going to tell you a story about Noah Noah went and got the blueprints for an ark God told him the length the breadth how many windows whatever and he told him exactly how to build the ark if many of you have made the unfortunate pilgrimage down to the the ark experience which is all young Earth it's all 24 days of creation scary talk about influence anyway but if you've had the experience you've seen how massive it is now Noah could not build that on his own he needed his sons at least and whoever else he got so what did Noah do with the blueprints that God gave gave him he shared them with his son Sons at least he said look boys gather around got his stick drew some things in the dirt whatever they did back then it was a civilization advance so maybe they had a plotter anyway and uh he he prints out the plans and he says now this is what God told me it's going to be this long it's going to be this wide and and I saw that there were this many uh ribs you the Keel was like this and then there was all this many ribs in it and uh these are the planks that have to go on and then we have to fill those planks in with pitch do you guys get it he says okay go go ahead so what they're doing is they're taking Moses's vision and they're adding the planks to the shape of the arc they're adding they're filling in the blanks all right of how these sides of the arc are going to be made so Noah has the job of putting down the Keel putting in the ribs that establishes the length and the width and now the Suns can come and nail on the planks so sometimes that's what the picture does for us we can come along and without contradicting scripture we can actually look at something and say hm I wonder if this could be cons consistent with the picture that we've been given and so that's what I'm going to do so the first time the law was given the Ten Commandments it was written by the Finger of God on tablets of stone and then Moses has the dubious distinction of being the first person to break all Ten Commandments and then he goes back up the mountain and now this time he has to make his own tablets first time God made them and once once again God writes his word this is um the second edition of The Ten Commandments all right and God writes with his finger on these tablets of stone the second time so that's the Old Testament this is the picture that we're using to inform us of something that Jesus did because the law is our school Master to bring us to Christ so when the woman's caught in adultery they tempted him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not the implication is this had nothing to do with what they were telling him we try and make an implication there but it seems that Jesus is ignoring them and he's writing with his finger in the ground now brother Brenham says a wonderful thing I don't know if I have the quote he says the reason we don't know what Jesus wrote is because Jesus didn't have to write the word he was the word number one and number two he was going to write the word and the and that the Believers were going to be the written Epistles read of all men it wasn't that Jesus would write a book he was going to write a book in the lives of the Believers so it's a lovely thought all right so Jesus Stoops down the first time and he writes then he looks up it's got nothing to do with what he wrote and he said he is without sin among you cost the first stone which sounds like he could have just said that from the beginning because obviously that would be true right that nobody would be without sin and then it says he stooped down again and for the second time as the sun he's now writing with his finger and he's not writing in stone he's writing in the sand he's writing in ground which is very fine Stone so it's like the same thing right as the father he writes on Stone as the son he writes in the ground and brother Bram says yeah I got the quote as far as we know he never wrote but one time and that was in the sand then erased it just like the Ten Commandments were erased probably afterwards because he was the word of course we don't need so many books when you become a written Epistle of God so it's a lovely concept so where is God writing with his holy spirit today he's writing it on the fleshy tables of our heart and thy word have i hidden my heart that I might not sin against you if it's on tablets of stone that can get smashed if it's in the ground in the dust it can be wiped out but if it's written in our heart it's there for eternity then we have the the the word as part of who we are so 2 Corinthians 3:3 for as much as you manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ as brother R said the the written Epistles ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but in the fleshy tables of the heart so I don't think it's too much of a stretch right I think we can kind of feel like not such thin eyes right so Psalm 119:1 so famous Thy word have i hidden my heart that I might not sin against thee so there's the word written on the fleshy tables of our heart so we need to uh do a little lesson here on the heart to see how it works and I promise you we will get to those four gospels um by the end uh I think we going to get to them now actually so you see the little dark red arrows coming in on the left hand side of the picture that's the old blood coming back from the body used up all the oxygens taken out of it all the nutrients and this is the old used up blood this is coming in from the body all right coming into the heart so we might say that's coming in from the Old Testament so then it goes into that first uh chamber uh at not Atrium Is It Anyway and uh then from there it goes to the second chamber which is the pump all right and uh that's called a ventricle the left ventricle in fact and from there it gets pumped out to the lungs that's where it's going to pick up the oxygen now it goes from dark red to bright red because now it's got full of oxygen and the lifegiving power is back in the blood and so it comes back into the heart into that third chamber and then it goes to the fourth chamber what is the fourth chamber that's the right ventricle very original names and it's a great big pump you see how big it is it's huge right it's a great big pump because its job is to pump all that oxygen to the body so if we're looking at the four gospels as the heart that's where God was going to write his word as in the chambers of our heart well if the word of God is in our heart there has to be four chambers right four four living creatures we got to see the ox the man and the Eagle right we got to see them all so let's see what happens so in the first chamber the old blood blood coming in from the Old Testament we read in Matthew chap 1 the entry into this heart and we read about Jesus being the son of David the son of Abraham why is that important it's because it traces gen Jesus genealogy all the way back to the first mention of kings that was in Abraham story and David was the most famous King so the kingly attributes that are represented by Matthew or that Abraham is the first mention of Kings David is the most famous King Matthew was a tax collector very unusual occupation you would imagine for somebody that you know we're going to count on for Spiritual Insight don't think everybody likes the tax collector all right and who collects taxes a king collects taxes or in this case an emperor and where do we read the story of the wise men going to do Nativity scen here soon all right we don't have the wise men and the shepherds in the same scene why not cuz they weren't there at the same time but Matthew is looking at Jesus as the king and who were the wise men bringing gifts to to a King all right the Shepherds weren't bringing gifts all right to the young baby the little baby but the wise men were bringing gifts to a young child because they saw him as a king where is he that is born King of the Jews so that's all in Matthew so now the blood goes into the second chamber now chamber one is just receiving blood it's not a pump so the the valve opens and it goes into the second chamber so Matthew Mark well guess what no genealogy in mark because there's no blood coming in from the outside there is internal so there's no genealogy and Mark represents Jesus constantly as a servant and he's got him working if you look at the time a number of times at the word straightway or immediately is used in The Book of Mark it's 40 times he's got Jesus going from Miracle to Miracle to Miracle to Miracle to Miracle straightway straightway immediately straightway just like you would treat a servant all right and then what do you do with the animal the beautiful Ox that's worked his whole life for you when he gets too old to work you don't put them out to pasture you sacrifice him and so Mark having work Jesus for almost half the CH half the book then spends the second half dealing with the passion describing how he was going to be sacrificed isn't that incredible just like you would think an ox would be treated now we have Luke ah curly brackets we know something's different about Luke well first of all the genealogy appears in Luke chapter 3 all right just purely coincidence right and this is the blood coming back from the lungs with oxygen in it so what is the Luke the doctor interested in he's interested in Jesus as a man man so what's his genealogy trace Jesus back to Jesus Christ the son of Adam right the Son of God right at the end of that chapter he says Jesus Christ the son of I'm sorry he talks about all the genealogy sorry down and then he says the son of Adam the Son of God so he traces it back to the first man and who's there to witness the birth it's the Shepherds because this is the human side this isn't the kingly side and what do we read about in this uh in this CH uh in Luke's gospel we read about Jesus's Boyhood we read about how he waxed in wisdom and in strength and in knowledge of the word of God those 11 characteristics that's in the Book of Luke why because he's interested in how Jesus developed as a Man how he matured as a man isn't that incredible so as a doctor he'd be interested in Jesus human qualities so that was that was that uh that um uh third uh chamber now the blood's going to flow into the Book of John so no genealogy in John very spiritual characteristics of Jesus are described I and the father are one if you've seen me you've seen the father and many many many others and uh gospel starts off with Jesus as the word the Word was God and the Word was made flesh so it goes all the way back into the mind of God that's some genealogy but it's not human genealogy all right this is spiritually where Jesus uh characteristics came from and so this gospel is really astonishing because it's this great big pump and its job is to pump out of that right ventricle into the whole body that's a that's a big job especially in my case so I'm not alone so what's so special about John's gospel it's known as the great unfinished book in the Bible if you read the last verse of John Chap 21:2 and there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written that's us so that's starts in the book of Acts and it continues all the way through to the catching away of the church that God is writing his gospel in the Gentiles all right and so that's why John is the eagle gospel and guess what because it's unfinished it goes all the way through to the eagle age yeah it's just coincidence and any case we don't really have a a context but we do because we have the principle of what God is going to do with these four gospels and so this this Blood now now flows out of the gospels into the book of Acts as brother renam was describing earlier now who are these um fellows that I talked about earlier Satan's Messengers what's special about them one of them's an odd man out if you've heard me before don't shout it out it's got to be a surprise and I'm just about finished so KL Marx was a Jew Sigman Freud was a Jew Einstein was a Jew but Darwin was a gentile now I have done this exercise for 40 years just randomly asking people in a Bible study context who are the four people you think have most affected our world view just just give me the names 99.9% one time somebody mentioned n or something that nobody knows but it was these four people every time because they've had that much influence on the 20th century and so we need to be cautious about what we hear what we listen to what we watch what we read and to see how much of of these guys are influencing what's being written now it's easy when it's Darwin right because they just say Evolution all the time doesn't matter whe they're talking about space there's no evolution in space I hope you know that evolution is only biology you know nothing you do with space but they talk about the evolution all right because that's like a key word so the question is do you have a few more minutes it's 1:00 can we just take a few more seconds all right I don't know what's coming up so it'll be interesting to see what I put in after this that's right I want you to finish with this because I wanted to wrap this up this is Satan's Eden brother random preached the sermon the conflict between God and Satan it's actually 62 it's actually a really important sermon he says the word don't won't mix with any modern Theory you can't have a theory and have the word you've got to have the word or the theory now which are you going to believe we need to have an absolute by the way how many people say oh yeah that's a good theory no that's not a theory that's the truth your evolution is a theory that you call the truth but this is the real truth it's not a theory this isn't my opinion this is the word of God and we've got to be able to take that stand all right but Satan is more than a match for us we know that we know that Satan is way more than a match for any human being the brightest angel in heaven goodness don't you never try to do it with your wisdom to out modom you just can't do it and how did he build Satan's Eden he built it by civilization but did you know that Civilization Science Education and the things that we cherish so great today is the very instrument of Satan now please don't understand misunderstand that brother ROM's against uh education or anything like that obviously he was not all right and you'd have to be head in the sand to know that he that he was uh that that he wasn't against it but what he's against is the philosophies that come through those channels and so you have to be careful you have to be on your God you have to hold those principles in in the foreground you have to know what the word of God says you know how have to be able to defend what you believe because you are going to be challenged that's Satan's job so if you're going to be challenged you might as well be prepared otherwise you're going to wind up like those guys who wrote those books and say well I just gave up because I couldn't answer their questions you know if there's a Bible question there is a Bible answer every time I've been doing this a long time I've never been ashamed I've spoken to at least a dozen highly qualified theologians and I've never had to change anything that I believe that I know from the message because it's the truth I don't it and and brother random says in the church AG well the truth needs no defense it stands on its own and so I know that I can stand against a challenge by the enemy not with my word but just as Jesus did with his word amen but you have to know that and you have to know how it goes together and actually I invite you if if anybody's thinking of college or thinking or having had trouble at college or whatever please come and see me I've got some amazing material to uh to apologetic material that um can prepare you uh for uh the challenge of the world view that we have as Christians and I tell you what the challenge is enormous so brother brandham says this in 1965 he says what does communism lay on what's the underpinning Science Education that's their God see Satan that's what he introduced to Eve that's what they're still holding to say civilization is not of God for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we're always killing ourselves and this civilization has built up to its Pinnacle now and we've got death in The Civil ization even today even more so today we've got sin in the civilization we've got sickness in the civilization that can't be of God and so we have a responsibility to live in this world we need a certain amount of Education we need a certain amount of wisdom to deal with the things of this world but I tell you if ever there was an age that we have to be prepared it's this age and you have to be prepared not just with the knowledge of a couple of scriptures I mean that's all wonderful especially in Sunday school we learn a few scriptures but you have to know the principles you have to know the picture behind those scriptures why are there four gospels that should be a question we could answer any day of the week now we know why there's four gospels there had to be four as a framework around the word there were even four you know why did Jesus die when Jesus died why did it go dark remember it went dark stars came out why anybody know well that's good so he was the Son of God the son of righteousness so when the Sun goes out you'd expect the natural sun to go out as well but there's another reason the law teaches us that when they sacrificed the lamb it was at night in the evening time so if Jesus is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he can't be dying in broad daylight because that wouldn't fit the pattern now why was it dark in the evening time is why was the lamb slain in the evening time is the real question not why was it dark when Jesus died that's the Fulfillment it was dark in the evening time when the lamb died because when Jesus died there was the sun was going to go out you see that's the Shadow the reality is Jesus died when it was dark so when they were going to kill the lamb as a picture of what was going to happen it had to be evening time so sometimes we get that backwards right the shadow is cost from the Old Testament down onto the the New Testament down onto the Old Testament so that's why when we look at the shadow we understand the New Testament better praise God all right civilization that can't be of God so brother brandom is the voice to oppose Satan's Messengers you see how that works so at the same time that Satan's raising up his four Messengers God's got his voice on the earth at the same time and he's the one who's actually setting us on the right course he's the one who's helping us to find the way of the Tree of Life Satan's trying to distort that picture brother brandom says misbelieve all right because he doesn't want us on that path he doesn't want us to find that PA and but God has his provision God just like the bitter Waters of Mara before they ever got there God had planted a tree probably 30 years before they got there and when they had to get lifegiving water from those bitter Waters God said chop down that tree I already provided for you 30 years ago I planted that tree for you and God already had this ministry of brother Brenham in mind we know from the scripture and why is it there because there were going to be these four fellows that would come along with their warped ideas and they were going to be an influence on this age but God has his influence now you can see we ignore the message to our Peril because then what are we going to use to defend ourselves against those four Messengers because we're going to be unarmed if we don't have what God's provided for us in this day so that's where I want you to end thank you for your time God bless you and uh uh who's coming up brother Gideon all right I really appreciate as the musicians make their way let's stand sometimes it has to be long to be good I just trust it was good amen God bless [Applause] you amen let's bow our heads our heavenly father we just we love your your word so much Lord we love the fact that you trust us with your word to to put it in our hearts Lord to make us your temples temples of the Living God and Lord that you even made this heart in such a way Lord that it would be the perfect place for you to write your word with the finger of your Holy Spirit Lord never to be erased Lord we just pray that you would give us the courage Lord to know know who we are Christ in us the hope of glory your word shed abroad in our hearts Lord and Lord may we be those living Epistles R of all men Lord that Lord we could share that lifegiving power that you've shared with us Lord that we in turn could share it with others Heavenly Father we we love your word we love your people of the word we we love the fact that we have this in common that we can so easily connect with one another because of your spirit on your word so Lord we just pray that you would let this word sink in Lord just all the implications of the Precision of your word the way it all fits together so beautifully the patterns and the pictures and the fact Lord that now when we look at the scripture we're not just looking at isolated verses but we're looking at them in the context of a principle that you've revealed to us in this day so father bless each one give healing and virtue to each one that needs it Lord and Lord thank you for giving me the strength even today to be able to stand and minister to your people Lord I Thank you for the pull I thank you for the receptiveness and and I thank you for the receptive hearts Lord that are thirsty for your word we just commit all the rest of this day to you now in Jesus name [Music] amen always been you Jesus oh Jesus Jesus at the center
