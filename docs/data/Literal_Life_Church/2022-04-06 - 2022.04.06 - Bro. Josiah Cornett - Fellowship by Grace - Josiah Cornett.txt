========================================

can get it all all worked up and ready to go for the the word amen all right i'll take that that means that you're here this at the ephesians 2 and verse 5 is where we're at and the apostle paul writing says even when we were dead in sins he hath quickened us together in christ for by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus and over in 1st john chapter 1 and verse 7 and as just as you're turning there i'll give you a little bit of background this weekend i had a a wonderful time with uh in fellowship with a brother that came up for the baby shower of laura's and his wife came up and uh we just sat down i was just one of the brothers that in the natural we're probably just about as opposite as a spoon and fork i suppose but we could sit down have hours of conversation just talking about the lord and talking about the word and uh just so much just so much fellowship because we had a basis for self-fellowship and the same spirit and the same thing that we could fellowship around and uh it just impressed upon my heart that i wanted to speak something about fellowship and brother paul came along and preached on grace this sunday and i feel to take the service fellowship by grace you're saved by grace but also there's something beyond just salvation there's a fellowship by grace and so in first john 1 7 we get another taste of that now no longer the epistle of paul but also the epistle of john now so by two witnesses he says but if we walk together in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin amen may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated and just taking that that thought then of fellowship here we we think about here john's talking about here we're we're being quickened together and now we're in heavenly places in christ jesus so by grace are we saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god but it goes beyond that that we're now welcomed into fellowship and i i just think maybe to take a little survey down to the old testament to me to kind of catch what fellowship meant to our forefathers and what fellowship means to us today we look at what fellowship was before sin came in and before before the covenant was broken in the garden and before adam and eve made their initial sin we saw that there was perfect fellowship there was perfect fellowship between man and god that god walked in the garden with man and in the cool of the evening god and himself came down and had fellowship with man that the creation and creator was one and that creation was even in fellowship with one another that adam could could divinely orchestrate everything that happened in that garden he could he could call the animals before him and named them one by one and there was just there was no disobedience there was no there was no fear of those animals the creation was in harmony with one another so it's not just fellowship between man and god that had to be restored but fellowship between man and all of creation which was under him and subject to him all that was lost when adam made his sin you look at the the fellowship that eve and adam had together that there was a perfect fellowship between man and woman and how many brothers and sisters could say this evening that we're still trying to get back there we're still not quite there at perfect fellowship thank god for the holy ghost today and thank god that we're both saved and redeemed but there's still something more that we're trying to obtain to we're still on a journey back to eden oh and if you think that marriage is good right now brother sister just imagine how wonderful it's going to be when we have ourselves all the way back to eden all the way back to that original covenant that didn't have any sin in the picture whatsoever so that's what we're going back to is we're we're getting back to this fellowship but what is fellowship by fellowship is not something that we merit something is not it's not something that we earn of god i was just thinking in my car the other day just being real honest with the lord and i was thinking about the the the uh the great paradox of man's free will and and god's sovereignty and i said my god you you predestinated me and and and and and i couldn't do anything that would commend myself to you lord there there's nothing that i could have done that would have to build up my resume to make you want to choose me right and yet i know that it's it's god that draws and and not myself i i didn't go seeking after god he he went and sought after me and i i was just standing i was just sitting there in my car and i was just trying to work it out in my mind and i said lord i i i could never hope to have you choose me but one thing i know i i can't put myself in your mind and understand your choices but one thing i know is that i choose you i just cried out from from the honesty of my heart and i said lord i i choose you lord yes you are my choice above my wife above my children above above all things of life above anything that i could do today if you ask me would you would you like to have fellowship with god right now or watch a movie i would say i want to have fellowship with god now sometimes i go ahead and watch a movie because i don't know how to get into god's presence at that moment or i don't feel i don't feel worthy to get into his presence but if it was just a matter of pushing a button i would always choose push the button of getting into god's presence i know that in my heart of hearts i choose you and i said that to the lord i said i don't know if you would choose me lord in this moment i don't know if you would choose to come down and bless me with your grace and your presence in this moment but i choose you and just like that i felt his presence rush in and he said the very fact that you choose me is showing you evidence that i chose you because you'd never sought me i drew you no man can come unto me except i draw him first so the very fact that you're coming unto me is evidence and there's a token unto you that i drew you that i chose you oh there's a whole world out there that doesn't know anything about the presence of god that doesn't want anything to do with the presence of god but i believe that i'm standing in an audience this evening that says we choose to have the presence of god oh hallelujah that's that's here seeking his presence this asking god lord i i don't know what your choice would be this evening but our choice was to come to church our choice was to worship you our choice was to sit down and hear the word and i believe that god's heart would come back and echo back to each heart this evening and say the very fact that you have that desire is evidence that i'm here amongst you this evening oh don't be don't be fooled by the wiles the enemy god is not far away god is near to those who seek him oh hallelujah he said in the scripture that those who seek me would be found of me and so all through the old testament we have evidence of those who sought after god we look at abel and how god just divinely came in even though his parents had done what they had done and had broken fellowship yet man was right there being drawn back into god's presence it wasn't able seeking after god but it was god divinely giving him a revelation you want back into my presence it has to be by the blood there has to be a basis for our fellowship and it has to be by this blood yes and so abel from the very beginning he had fellowship with god through revelation and by the basis of the shed blood we look at enoch and how that we have this great pattern that we all look to that enoch not walked with god and he was not what a a great end sample for us at the end time that there will be a people that are walking with god and simply they'll be not for god takes them it was one in enoch's time and no doubt they hardly noticed he was gone and it'll be the same thing in our generation i believe but we have this fellowship with god and god's god's story begins to develop with his people but here they are seeking after god but it's a god that's drawing them first and showing them away into his presence you see that when you open up the sto the book of genesis and you read the story of noah that noah wasn't seeking after god that god was seeking after someone to save he said i have to bring judgment i have to change the course of this present world i have to i have to fulfill the the cup of the iniq the cup of their iniquity is full i have to bring forth judgment but i'm seeking someone to save oh hallelujah and he said that he found one man in his family that was righteous in his generation god found the man that man didn't find god he might have been righteous by god's choosing but that man was still not searching after god it was god that came to noah and god gave him grace and noah found grace in the sight of god unto what until the salvation of his family it was by faith but it was also by grace because we cannot have faith without first having god's grace amen so we come after the ant deluvian destruction and man is goes down across his generations and the next lifeline that we pick up is that of abraham and here god seeks out abraham again it's not man coming to god first he was he was bound underneath all these multiplicity of of gods and his father i believe was a craftsman of gods and and made the graven images but god came to abraham i said why don't you come walk with me why don't you come to a land that i've prepared for you why don't you come to the land of my promises leave behind everything you've known leave behind the gods and the prayers and and no doubt they had their philosophies and their theologies that abraham had to leave behind and just come and have fellowship with me and and abraham had to step out on faith because this was this was a god without a name he he didn't have a whole lot of understanding of this god but he knew that somebody was talking to him and he began to step out on faith and we see what god thought of abraham he said of abraham how shall i show how shall i hide these things from abraham when he was looking at the destruction of sodom how shall i hide all that i'm going to be doing from abraham when i know that his those children will be taught and instructed by him that i i can trust abraham with teaching his children and it was just god's grace to to this man of god and we even look at david as we come down the the pipeline of the old testament a man after god's own heart so much so that they said i i want to dwell in the tabernacle of the almighty all the days of my life i always get so struck by david here he is the the the prince of israel if you will the very king of israel but he says i i don't want to be in my throne room i don't want to be i want i don't want to be decked out with all these tapestries i just want to be in the house of my god just let me be a doorman in the house of god let me let me be as we're the greeter at the door or the deacon or i don't even have to be behind the pulpit just just let me find myself in god's presence because although they had a basis of fellowship by a shed blood yet there was something about it that they could not come into a perpetual fellowship with god that's what they were seeking is they were they were seeking after the perpetual presence an abiding presence of jesus christ he said i just i just want to abide there underneath the shadow of the almighty let me find myself underneath the covert of thy wings all the psalms expressed david's desire but yet he did not have what you have this evening that's true he did not have the outpouring of the holy ghost he did not have the abiding presence of god that he was looking for that was for another day he without us was not yet made perfect he was looking unto the coming of christ he was looking unto the day of acts where the holy ghost would be poured out upon god's people but he could not yet be a partaker of that that was for another day but he he could partake as much as he was able that there was there was still a basis of fellowship there was still the shed blood that he could he could go into god's presence because he knew that that priest that was offering sacrifices continually on behalf of the people of israel daily that priest would come oh my and offer the sacrifice every single day and because the priest was offering the sacrifice because the priest kept on doing their due diligence israel could have faith that god was in their midst that they were keeping the tenants of god i i think about how weary some that would be for a pastor to keep on offering the sacrifices on behalf of the people today aren't you so glad brother paul that we're not the priests today that we have that we have a greater high priest amongst us whereas the priests and times past had to enter in daily there was this one man christ jesus they entered in once and paid the price of redemption and so what is the basis of fellowship for us today it's based upon the shed blood of jesus christ and i want to say just as he paid the price once we receive the price once that your redemption is not subject and hanging in the balance from day to day your redemption once received cannot be lost oh what a wonderful security we have in jesus christ the christ came in once and paid for that that we don't have to keep on trying to get our redemption paid for but it's been paid one time think of the power of that blood they were offering sacrifice daily for thousands of years and then jesus christ comes in lays the price on the table and it's settled for all of time all that i'll bring such a security to our hearts this evening so what is our approach now to fellowship whereas in times past david longed for fellowship with god the christian today has a different approach to god we don't keep on going in daily asking for god to save us asking for god to forgive us for our low estate although we do make mistakes we do have sins but the bible says now he says if you have sins just simply confess them to god and he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins what blows me about that scripture what blows my mind is that he would attach god's justice with our forgiveness before there was there was no basis for god to have any any obligations towards us but now because he's paid the price by his own blood he's brought his own self by his own life under obligations to his own people who he has called his own family that he's paid the price and because the price has been paid it's now justice to forgive us of ourselves yes sir it means when satan comes against us and says you don't have any right to salvation you can say by my own merits you're correct but the truth is that jesus christ legally paid for my sins and if this matter goes to court i will win if this matter of my sin ever makes its way to court i'll win it and you'll be the defeated prosecutor maya he jesus christ stands today as my attorney he stands today as my judge but he also stands today as the one who made the propitiation for my sins in the first place saying you don't have a case and it's it's so bad your prosecuting attorney is so bad that it's never going to make itself to the bar did you know that down at the county courthouse the prosecutor has to have has to prove to the court that he has a case before he can even bring it to the judge and if he can't make that preliminary case to the judge to get their approval the judge will just tell them this is not even worth my time i'm throwing it out i'm not even going to have a bailiff bring him in here hurry up and unlock that holding cell and let him out of here there will be no sentence from this banister and paul says that there is no judgment there remaineth therefore no judgment to the people of god they've passed from death and to life and there will be no white throne judgment for god's elect the case has been thrown out already the key has been put in the door of your holding cell this evening and god sets you free god sets you free from depression god sets you free from oh satan says you deserve to be depressed think about all the things you've done think about all you deserve not to have any friends think about the kind of person you are but god comes down and says that case is absolutely wrong i throw it out i pl i paid my blood for him and if he doesn't have any friends on the whole face the earth i'll vouch for him as my friend because i said in my scripture i no longer call him a servant but i call him my friend because he has made himself subject to my commandments and so everything so much that he does whatsoever i tell him oh hallelujah now we're getting down to real fellowship now we're getting down to a real intimate relationship with jesus christ he says my that's my friend over there grace slacked is my friend brandon sinacola is my friend paula fontaine is my friend because i've bought him with my blood and i've made him i've adopted him into my family but now we're we're not just left there friends i mean it would be enough to say i've got a friend in god forget about the old song you've got a friend in me i've got a friend in god that would be enough i could take my seat right now we could rejoice the rest the evening just knowing that we've got a friend in god but you know what since satan's already left the building yeah i saw him running out that door a few minutes ago [Applause] why don't we go ahead and enjoy ourselves a little bit more hardly a time where we get them off our backs but i feel i i feel a little bit of a light atmosphere tonight like like something just lifted how about we talk about the other friends that god's given us because we come back to the scripture here and it says while we were dead in sins we've been quickened all by ourselves with no together with christ that yes by grace we're saved but by grace we're also saved together he's raised us up together and made us sit here and in heaven in heavenly places all by ourselves no with christ oh that'd be enough but together oh hallelujah oh you do have a friend in me you do have a friend and the brother or sister sitting beside you you're the same blood you're the same family you're the same genetics you're the same seed gene of god you're the same heritage you're the same story from the very beginning where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy your story is the same this evening oh hallelujah isn't it true that when we first meet somebody we kind of asked them well where are you from and what do you do and we're trying to find some kind of basis for fellowship with them but when you come and meet a son or daughter of god that basis of fellowship is already there that's not where you're from we know where we come from what do we do we serve the lord what are you going to do with your life i'm going to keep on serving until he comes what are you going to do with your life after that i'm going to sit around the marriage table for three and a half years while the rest of this sound condition falls apart and then i'm going to rule and read with you brother paul for another thousand years i know my story with you we have a commonality we have a common father abraham we know each other's story oh hallelujah we have a basis for fellowship this evening there's god's grace to us there's fellowship by grace not fellowship by video games trying to proctor a relationship virtually not fellowship by the super bowl not fellowship by hobbies and and and and boats and soccer and football those things may be all right some of them can be enjoyed fine but that's not the basis of our fellowship so those are something those are things that we do but all these things will pass away but yet there will remain with one thing when my hobbies on this world are gone get my relationship with you brother sister come on i hope that if the lord would terry our our sons and our daughters would grow up together i see these little ones sitting on the front row and we have a hope that as they come to the lord they'll not just form friendships like at the play group at school or something but there's eternal bonds being made amen and it's a heritage that we're built we're privileged we're graced to build together here what a beautiful thing as a body is we can think about the body corporate and global but what a beautiful thing this body is we can talk about the the story that we have together down through time but what about the story that this church here has together brother brandon and i were talking about it in the back room and just some of the wonderful memories we have in this church some of the older ones i seems like i've always seen brother kenny dancing around while playing his piano and we came back from arizona it was like a homecoming i i remember that it's it's a sacred history that we have together we were talking about the the old times and steve steve johnson leading the the youth meetings and i remember all the young people gathered around on the floor and some of them was sitting there and grace i remember you i remember 12 13 years old as brother stephen was preaching and or just sharing with us tears were rolling down your face i remember that as you responded the word i remember brandon walking out after church going straight to his truck and just sitting there because he wasn't yet at a time in his life where he was enjoying the grace of fellowship but look at god's grace to us now and what a privilege we have to enjoy his ministry and his friendship it's god's grace to us in this little church called literal life brother joe i remember you i was thinking when when i heard that you were coming back to our coming to our church rather i remember you from years ago and how i always had a good time hearing your laugh and how joyous you were in the lord yes and i heard that brother joe was coming i said my we're going to have a good time brother joe is coming to our church to see families come we're going to have a good time and we have brothers like our brother tony and the ones that have come alongside us and what a privilege what i don't know any other word for it besides grace there'd be nothing i could do to commend myself to your favor saints of god i i think of when i was a boy in school they had the the boys create a it was i'd say was a click but it was really more of a cast system you had the kings and the dukes and the lords and then you had the slave and i got nominated for the john wasn't the highest place in the totem pole i i remember you know just not feel like i had a friend in the world and i hear about brother branham talking on the tape so many times how he he felt the same way and my family name may have not been outcasted the city but when he he talks about how he's got friends all over the world now i think me too i can go anywhere and find friends and i'm not talking just shallow friendships we've got a basis for fellowship i may not even know them but you give me a couple hours and and let down let down our hair a little bit enough to walk over each other's complexes and let down our walls and connect with one another's spirits that resides within us oh my we're best friends and i can remember those relationships like it was yesterday just just give me a little contact with them you ever made contact with a believer i mean you ever really make contact with a believer i'm not talking to somebody you knew before but you just come in and there's that connection it's like sparks fly and you can walk away and say that was a real believer they really had the holy ghost there was something i connected with that's god's grace to us that we have that kind of fellowship and i'm just here to preach let's not take that lightly and that as there is an approach to god what is our approach to god it doesn't just end off with you know i i i believe that god saved me and i'm going to accept his one-time redemption and then we walk away no there there's a continual approach to god not for offering sacrifices of blood anymore but offering sacrifice of thanksgiving and worship and fellowship and and and coming boldly before the throne of what of grace no longer a throne of judgment to ourselves because we've passed from death into life but it's now a throne of grace and favor that we enjoy when we approach god we should approach him with confidence in our hearts that i am a born-again believer i am his son i i am his daughter not not by his not by our doing like we talked about but by his doing that i am accepted as the scripture says amongst the beloved that he's accepted me not just that i accepted him but he accepted me in the first place you talk about when when you let that revelation really drop down into your heart that it's no longer about me trying to be a good enough person to be god's friend i remember that i remember trying to be a good enough person to be somebody's friend you know brush myself up make sure everything's straight no wrinkles in my clothes and make sure i was cool enough to be somebody's friend that's not the relationship we have with god and neither should it be the relationship that we have with one another we do not just like we don't approach god through we don't approach his fellowship the way the world approaches fellowship we approach his fellowship first on the basis of blood yes that's good the basis that we are now family yes that that i'm not ju he's not just my god but he's my father that i'm his son that i'm his daughter that that i've i've got i've got his grace shining upon me i was i was telling brandon how the other day a little girl ran up and uh and and smacked my pregnant wife right in the face and uh you think that sounds terrible and what did you do brother josiah well here's the thing is i would have done something terrible i suppose and never seen that girl again but she was my daughter was there still judgment yeah there was still judgment but she's right back there we we smiled at her just the other day and we were playing with her on the floor and our fellowship is beautiful and we love her and and she loves us and and there's happy fellowship once again after that little tall mall what was the difference it was unmerited favor she did not do anything to become my daughter but yet it's still there the difference between what would have happened and what did happen was purely dictated by our relationship that we were kind to one another and that's the confidence that we have towards god so i just want to put it to the church tonight what confidence then do we have towards one another when you approach your brother or sister in christ you say you know this person's just come to church here recently i i'd like to get to know them what is the first thing that comes across our minds let's not make it be about what their hobbies are or you know does do they have the same personality as i do or are we kind of similar in our taste in things you know it's god's let's remember that it's god's grace to us that every single oddball of this church is our brother and sister i'd rather take the oddest one among you and be friends with you than any superstar in the world i'd i'd rather fellowship down here in the ditches with the poor folk than be with the celebrities of the world doesn't matter that it brings me more prestige to be with them doesn't matter they might be more interesting and my maybe more well traveled and and they they know more things about this world they've got more experience just to share i don't care about that all you let me hear about your experience in christ for an afternoon you let me just sit down and hear about your testimony and that beats any kind of story the greatest storyteller celebrity could tell me i just want to have fellowship with god's people i'll tell you what that's that's the greatest friendship that i could have that we we it's not bonded together by hobby or interest but it's bounded together by the basis the word that's what we fellowship around that we can start with that as our center and as we as we rotate around that word together we might find out that we have some other interest and pick that up along the way and say oh you like that too i do too next time next time we want to talk about the lord let's go out to that restaurant to eat since we both like the cane same kind of food next time we next time we get together let's go ahead and get on a boat together but what are you doing on the boat let's and let's not forget our moorings let's not forget what our basis of fellowship is that in all the busyness of life and all the activities that we have together and all the fellowship we have out in the fellowship hall and all the coffee that we can drink and all the donuts we can eat together that we don't forget that it's not the donuts that are the basis of our fellowship because if that happens then you'll go right back to the best people to eat donuts with you'll go right back to the best people to drink your coffee with the people that have the best fellow coffee fellowship and the best donut conversation but that's not what we're here for that's not what draw you that's not what drew me let's not forget what drew us it was god that drew us and there's a deposit of god inside every one of us and my challenge to you this evening is let's go find it let's go find the deposit of god in each one of us and you might see well i i just don't really like being around people you don't understand brother josiah i just like to be around my people and your people might be your friends it might be your family it might be just you but i just i'm just here to remind you just take a pause and look around these are your people [Music] like brother paul says you didn't vote me in and you can't kick me out and what's more besides is you're stuck with me not here in church but for all eternity so how about we just settle down let our hair down for a little bit and get used to each other at literal life sure there's some new faces and i'll be honest tonight i'm kind of intimidated too when i'm when i get knocked off my perch of being you know knowing every single name in the church because i've been going here since i was 12 years old and and new people come along and i can't quite place their names anymore there's two options that i have towards me and there's a carnal side and there's there's a better side the carnal side is this church is getting too big that this is intimidating i'm just going to retreat back to my people or i can say praise god there's another person here there's another bride member of jesus christ they've got another deposit of god they've got another testimony how about i don't wait for it to come out on brother paul and brother kyle's videotape how about i invite them out to coffee myself and say tell me what is your testimony i want to know it i want to hear what god's done for you in life because you know what there's something that that does for me when i hear that oh hallelujah i i wonder if sometimes the reason where we feel so different from one another is because we don't take the time to really cross over and connect with each other's spirits they kind of wave and we kind of wave and they offer a funny smile so we just kind of figure they're kind of funny and we walk on well that's not the way to do it or or or they say something to you and it seems a little bit i don't know a little bit crude and you say well they're just kind of mean people i'll just write them off i i got plenty of people and literally i have to fellowship with i i i don't need to venture out but that's your brother that's your sister there's there's no black sheep in god's family all god's family is washed white by the red of god's blood there's nobody that we disassociate ourselves with in god's family oh now now we're getting down to the rubber meets the rollerblade paul i'll tell you what i'm back here and the lord's the lord's trying my heart as i'm saying these things because there is there is little funny feelings aren't there there are little complexes but how about we just challenge ourselves to get past it all so just kind of let the walls down a little bit and give people a chance try to try to connect to their spirit and invite them over for dinner invite them out for coffee well you say well i i have i'm busy i've got i've got my family and i've got god and i've got my my screen time you know i was just thinking the other week how it's amazing that as technology advances you know here you had back in the 50s you had the washer and you had the dryer that came out in the dishwashing machine and should have freed up everybody's time but then comes along the television tree of knowledge of good and evil every time that man creates a device to free himself up he finds another device to bind himself back down again we come out with computers that make our our our work week so much shorter and we can be so much more productive as a workforce and hardly want to work more than 40 hours a week and after that we start thinking we're overdoing it but along with that advancement comes the phone and we're bound back by our own devices again how about we just set that aside and find some real fellowship not proctored through social media but proctored by the blood of jesus christ and while we're at it why don't we just go ahead and say be honest with the lord and say the reasons why we don't feel like fellowshipping maybe you've got some funny feelings in there somewhere some some complexes from a long time ago you know and in our ranks there's a lot of history whether it's a little church or maybe you came in from one church to literal life and somebody else came in from another church and he said i never thought i'd see you in the same church but here we are i'm just going to say all the things the pastor can't say he he's smiling because he he's got a clear conscience he didn't tell me to say this but isn't it true but how about we just let all the history fall away because you know you know what you know what your history has to do with with eternity you measure all the history and all the preconditions and all you know they did this and their pastor did this all those years ago and their family did this and i always got this kind of impression or this kind of feeling from them and i believe that's the discernment of the lord you really think so and the scale of eternity i think the little dot of your experience to date with people is going to be washed away amen so in my opening i pray prayer i prayed lord let a little bit of eternity come down tonight and that's my prayer this still is lord let a little bit of eternity come into our fellowship let ourselves just enter into eternity and start to to draw down the benefits of eternity i don't have to wait till attorney to have fellowship with your friends i don't have to wait until i have until i've got all the time in the world frankly i've i've got more time than i care to admit and it doesn't always go where i want it to go but what better place to invest it in than back into god's people if you don't know what to do with your time why don't you try picking up that phone and using the old dialing pad remember how to do that i'm not not not this i'm talking with the index finger dialing numbers calling people if you can't meet them for lunch because you're a busy mom how about you you talk to them on the phone talk you know just say hey how are you doing and don't have to you're not committing your whole day to them they they're not gonna they're you can say goodbye when you don't when your kids are crying you can hang up the phone once they're not gonna throw a chain through that phone and keep you there for the rest of the day you can go ahead and call somebody for five minutes and just let them know hey brother brandon i was thinking about you yeah i love those phone calls brother just i was thinking about you praying for you today how you doing hey brother i'm and you can you know what this is this is one on one tonight this is just practical you know when you call them you can say hey i was on the road between here and here and i had five minutes and you just came to mind now they know you only got five minutes so when you say goodbye in five minutes they understand they're not going to be offended i'm just going to let i'm just going to let that one lay but you try it this week you try out somebody try is somebody that you don't normally call you know don't be calling your mama this week and say i did the homework assignment very good you know what i i think if we'll take the word of the lord this evening we'll find a little little life church that is that much more closer right and i'm not saying that i i'm seeing some kind of problems developing i'm just saying i see a church that can keep on growing in love you know literal life church was called it used to be called the lovey-dovey church uh for good reason you walked in the door and if you were a newcomer lord help you you had it was like it was like bees to honey man now when someone walks the door are you one of the bees going to the honey that's good do you do you recognize the honey in that brother's sister whether they're looking like a tired christian or not do you recognize there might be honey somewhere in there or have we gotten so big i told you i was just gonna say everything the pastor wanted to say have we gotten so big that we figure well somebody else to do that brother brandon will get him he's the assistant minister pastor anyhow think about it but tony he's always greeting somebody he'll get him and when they decide to come to our church are you like oh no that's another family i've got to remember the names of or are you checking your family calendar and saying when can we get them over when when can we have fellowship with them because i'll tell you since moving down this way which is the reason why we moved down is to have more fellowship i haven't gotten as much fellowship as i'd like to but the few times we've been able to have families over brother joe you know it's seeing seeing your kids play together sitting around and sharing each other's testimonies and even talking about what you're going through with work and how you're how you're dealing with this life it's such i'll i'll tell you the scripture's so right when it says that the uh the face of a friend maketh his accountants to shine that as iron sharpeneth iron so does does a man sharpeneth his friend that's right we sometimes talk about that you know being you know two sharp people going back at it but that's not what the scripture says it literally means that just by fellowshipping together we're made better i after this weekend with my good friend brother steven cressel i feel like i don't get enough of that and i couldn't get away from it as i was just preparing the service because i figure if if i'm going through something maybe maybe somebody else in church here could also use what the lord's doing with me on i want more fellowship you know what i i don't just think about it for myself i want a projective vision of fellowship to my family that my family doesn't grow up insulated by their own family members by the people that we're close to and that we always fellowship with and we're comfortable with i want them to learn how to have the ministration of fellowship that we can invite people out and be ministered to them be ministered or be ministered by them and be ministered back to them right that that our fellowship makes us better and you don't get that with fellowshipping with the same people every single time it's just how it works and i'm not saying forsake all your your good friends i'm just saying don't forget your other brothers and sisters in christ and i might also say this paul says let there be no ism or schism in the body let there be no division amongst us he said about the uncomely members of the body he says look in the natural we take it and we adorn our uncoming members with that much greater honor you don't see my you don't see my piggly wigglys this evening they're shot and beautiful cowhide because i adorn them with that much more honor if there's somebody that doesn't seem honorable to you maybe that's god saying why don't you just go ahead and adorn them with a little bit of honor take them out to eat and you pay for the meal it don't have to be a big meal it can be coffee that's what i did when i was a college kid and couldn't afford much if i wanted to look like a high roller i took my i took you out to coffee i took my own pasta out to coffee felt pretty good paying for my pastor's coffee didn't have much but i bought his coffee i'm not asking you to over commit i'm just asking you to commit commit to your brothers and sisters and if there's a division commit to bridging that division commit to finding a way over your perceived complexes they have that you think they have towards you because they smile that funny way every time or they said this about i i better be careful i might get too close but they said this or that or you know they said something to hurt your feelings or stomped on your personal taste or something you figure well they knew that i liked that and they said they didn't like that so therefore they don't like me and you can remember that for all of your days that they knew that i liked that and they said they didn't like that so they don't like me this is how these funny feelings develop they always seem so aloof whenever i greet them it might just be that they're taller than you or it might just be that they happen to have a different way they'd like to stand apart from you you like to stand up right here and talk to people and they they stand back here and talk with a proper distance and you're going to let satan come in it sounds silly but sometimes when we really start to analyze why we feel the funny things that we feel about people it comes down to silly things like that i don't know what your silly thing is but i know i still got a lot of them and one thing is that i recognize this evening that my fellowship with you brothers and sisters is god's grace to me and i want to enjoy it amen let's go ahead and have the musicians come if we would i don't know if we have yet we have a song for that one gideon or not grace grace god's grace or you're the song leader we all know that i'm not let's go ahead and stand [Applause] i can only hope that the word has challenged you like it has me this week i can only hope that you desire the same thing for your family that i desire for mine [Music] john said that there there's there's there's no greater joy that i have but to see my children [Music] enjoying the grace of god i i'm paraphrasing the scripture there but i can say about my children there's no greater joy that i could have than to see them raise up in this church to form friendships with this church to form bonds with each young person here [Music] and if i think about that for my own children doesn't it start from the head and go down to the toes if i want my my children to have good godly friends in this church am i engendering those relationships at the top am i just letting the water stay stagnant and say you know what i'm good the people that i know i like their kids and we're just going to kind of stay in our bubble in little life as little life grows and grows we're going to stay in the same bubble as god adds more to the church daily i'm not going to let him add to my bubble because i'm comfortable with my bubble or could it be that maybe as god's adding more and more to the church here at literal life god's willing to add something more to your bubble but maybe some of the people that have been coming through these doors have something to give you and maybe if you would believe it about yourself you have something to give them [Music] and neither is less important than the other for we're called to minister and be ministered to amen let's pray dear lord we just come before you father [Music] lord i'm so grateful [Music] lord i'm so grateful to have friends like i do lord it [Music] it boggles my mind that i could say that i'm the friend of god but to know that your grace doesn't stop there to know that if ever i have a hard time getting into your presence i could just call a friend up on the phone who has the same presence of god resident within them and as we talk about the word within a few minutes i could find myself in your presence together with my friend that we could raise up in the heavenly places together oh my lord i pray that that would be the picture of your church lord that would be the picture of liberal life that as we start this new age together lord where i shouldn't say start it we're in the thick of it these church doors and this new building have been opened lord and many new families have been at the church it seems like daily but lord i pray that would just mean many new friends for each and every one of us that we could connect to more sons than daughters of god lord if there's anyone tonight that would have a complex or some barrier something that would keep them from that lord i pray that they would see tonight that the price of friendship has already been paid for that just as there's no case against them with you there's no case against them as it pertains to them and a brother or sister in this church may they have faith in that lord the same faith that they approach you with a faith built upon relationship by blood may they approach the others in this church that same faith relationship by blood until every complex is torn down until every funny feeling is swept aside for the silliness that it is and the real heart of the believer connects one to another and then may the sparks fly lord i pray that something i've said has engendered the faith of your people one towards another lord because engendering faith one towards another it's a greater faith in you lord that what you've done by your grace is powerful enough to break down every stronghold not just between us and you between us and one another so let it be tonight we pray in jesus christ's name amen
