TRANSCRIPT
========================================
don't say man you know I'm just I'm just holding back right now because there's such a such an atmosphere in here amen when you know what God has done for you Hallelujah when you know Hallelujah when you should have been dead and gone and God turned it around Hallelujah Hallelujah oh my praise God let's just uh have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God tonight amen hallelujah let's just pray Lord Jesus father we know that your hand is Upon Our Lives Lord and you you see us in everything Lord you know us in every way father and Lord we just pray that you will continue to give us the spirit of submission we'll just surrender ourselves unto you the Lord you said a man a woman that's fully surrendered unto you is omnipotent and Lord our desire father is to see those two

not able to be here for some reason Lord Lord God show them that you're a God who's not constrained the boundaries and Lord we just love you and we thank you in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray that Trace amen amen by God's grace Hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's go to Genesis chapter one and uh we're gonna move kind of quick tonight when I say quick I just want to get through these scriptures and let the Lord lead as he will amen Genesis chapter 1 the Bible says Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. familiar verse of scriptures the Bible says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female let's go to second Samuel chapter 12. second Samuel 12 and uh let's just read verse 13. we'll try to come back to this let's just read verse 13. the Bible says and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin thou shall not die amen for last verse let's go to Proverbs chapter 14. proverbs 14. and we want verse 12. proverbs 14. verse 12. and the Bible says there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death amen may the Lord have blessed me of his word you can have your seats amen and if I can quote our scripture as you're sitting Corinthians uh chapter 1 verse 13 I mean chapter 13 verse 12 it says for we know for for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face no now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am Hallelujah amen and by the grace of God tonight I I we know it's a Tri-State youth meeting but I want to use for a subject what are you reflecting what are you reflecting but I I don't want to make this service a tear down of your faults I don't want to make this service a tear down of the things you're going through but I want you to be able to see tonight that you're supposed to reflect the image of God as a young person you know we have trials we have tribulations we have a lot of things we go through as we're growing in Christ but in all that I want you to understand God's thoughts and the way God sees you is in his own reflection Hallelujah that's your end goal that's your beginning goal that's the way it is hallelujah because he says in the beginning Hallelujah God created man in His image and in his likeness Hallelujah that's how God created us so our whole goal our whole job is to reflect that Hallelujah as young people we want to reflect the image of God the reflection of God but now you have to ask yourself why you're living here on this Earth what are you reflecting amen what do you see Hallelujah when it comes to your life what do you see when it comes to your desires what do you see when it comes to the things that you want to accomplish on this Earth what are you reflecting and I want you to understand that tonight by the grace of God I'm not talking about your outward appearance I'm not talking about this reflection right here because your flesh can say one thing and your inward person can say something different I know when I was a young person my outward appearance said it looked like I'd never be a son of God because I look like the world I dress like the world and all these things spoke of the world but my inward man said one day I'm going to be a son of God one day I'm going to reflect Hallelujah this true divine gospel that was my harsh desire all do I had on Nikes and gold chains but by inward man Hallelujah was reflecting something greater and let me tell you something young people the devil doesn't know what's in your heart Hallelujah he doesn't know your true desires Hallelujah so what he does is he studies you and he puts these before you to try to find out who you really are but whether you like it or not whatever's on the inside is going to come out Hallelujah no matter how good you look in church no matter how you dress yourself up and get you get your hair right and all these things and the reflection look good but if it doesn't match this word the outside doesn't mean anything and I think sometimes we spend so much time wasted on our natural image our natural reflection hallelujah what do people see when I post on Instagram what do people see when I post on Twitter what do people see when I put it on Snapchat it's all about image and self-image and what am I reflecting we want to reflect Christ and I want you to understand Hallelujah that's who you are so don't be satisfied with just a good outward appearance yeah as young people we got those things down pat El you sisters know not to come to church with pants on but what about if you got a desire for it that's the real reflection that's what's going on in the inside so although you don't put it on and you have a real hunger and desire for it you might as well say I'm stepping into it but there's a thing about Temptation Hallelujah the Bible says that God will not tip you above what you're able to be tempted Hallelujah and with every Temptation he's made a way of Escape Hallelujah so I'm saying to you tonight no matter what condition you're in the condition you're really supposed to be in is Genesis 1 26. Hallelujah in the likeness and image of God you see everybody I got this far I got that fault that does not change what God sees Hallelujah he's not dealing with hallelujah what you can project on the outside well he's worried about Hallelujah is that true life on the inside coming forward but what we have to do is stop worrying about how people perceive us yo you think you got it all wrapped up you'll get a little conceited sometimes and you think you look good but on the inside you're really nasty really dirty and you're no good to any of us in that condition because if there's a life inside we want fruit Hallelujah amen and I think the young people you people all of us we waste so much time earlier what about image worldly image when God has already set the standard the standard is catch this young people the standard is you're supposed to be a god that's kind of strong for the young people well let's say it like this when you get to heaven you're not going to stand there and get in when you get to heaven you're not going to stand there as the son of Paul LaFontaine you're going to stand there as a son of God [Applause] Hallelujah amen you Sisters You Brothers you're not going to stand there with whatever your last name is you're going to be judged as a son or a daughter Hallelujah you know when you get to heaven it's not about you carrying the family name you're either bride or not bride Hallelujah and we put so much pressure on one another trying to uphold that image all right now remember Gabby you're a LaFontaine don't do that image reflection what are you reflecting what is the real you saying to us tonight holy because you know if you take a church right now and you know some of you may not even shout dance or anything Hallelujah but what's being reflected a pull from the inside there's something from the inside connecting with the word and that's the real you the real you may not be that person that jumps up and run around and just kicks over and just let it all hang out that's all right you know I love that earlier but you give me something Hallelujah that can be tested through the times of tests Hallelujah amen well it can remain strong well it can remain peaceful well it can remain solid honey that's the real reflection of what it is Hallelujah and normally do trials and tribulations the real you will come out when you're at school when you're in your jobs Hallelujah the real you has to come out but if we can let's talk about reflection Hallelujah real reflection you know as a type God's character and God's person is spoke of as deity amen and deity is what a type of what gold and if you have the seed of God inside of you what's inside of you deity Hallelujah somebody talk to me now we've heard these things over and over again but I want you young people to realize that if you are a child of God you have deity inside of you so Satan doesn't have a right to make you live any less than that he doesn't have a right to make you feel any less than that he doesn't have a right to make you believe anything less than that you are deity Hallelujah you are the makeup the presence Hallelujah the inspiration of God you are as a child when you say Brothers I don't know about that well let me say it like this who was Jesus at the age of 12 in the synagogue as a child what was he in the city he's still still in our deity was inside of him and what did he reflect at the age of 12 he reflected he must be about his father's business even though he was born in a stinking Manger that didn't stop who he was how he looked on the outsider what people thought about him and what they thought about Mary and Joseph he knew that there was something in him Hallelujah that the whole world had to know at the age of 12. and I love saying this quote the prophet of God said the only thing that stop him from receiving the Holy Ghost at the age of 12 was a devil hanging over him when God was calling at the age of 12. Hallelujah so how young is too young how young is too young to be led by God how young is too young to reflect God's will in your life how young is to you you say well that's 12. well let's go back a little bit further there was a king named Josiah who was eight years old and he found the message for up until that time he was doing all he knew how to do but then one day he came across the writings of a prophet Hallelujah and when he came across the book of Moses Hallelujah he began to read it and he saw that he was not reflecting his end time message Hallelujah and as he started to read he had to straighten some things out earlier he had to make some things right in his kingdom the Bible says he didn't he didn't lean to the left he didn't lean to the right but he took the things that he was reading and dealt head on with him can you imagine he had you can go back and read it he had put heathens in positions that wasn't supposed to be in position Hallelujah so when the word came up when the word opened up to him he had to take those in positions and take him out of position so that his kingdom could reflect the right thing what about you are you able to strip down things off of your inward walls so that you can reflect the right thing are you able to strip down things that are in your private messages that are in your DMs that you're holding on to are you able to strip it down so you can get right into the real reflection of God because remember your gold but let's think about God to get to go you got to go on some nasty areas Hallelujah you say why is he walking around with that mirror in his hand Hallelujah because I want you to think the whole time I'm preaching I'm talking about what you're reflecting Hallelujah and we're supposed to reflect deity young people say it with me that's what's inside of you not paying not hurt not sickness if the seed of God is in you you are deity oh Church to get gold you got to go into some dark places Hallelujah you got to dig among Thieves that's not really gold rocks and and dirt and all these other things that are there where the goal is it so sometimes they get the realness out of you you got to dig deep you got to go into some dark areas of Our Lives that no one knows about but let me say it like this even earlier that gold that's in a cave where there's no life and there's nothing but darkness in that condition it's still gold somebody say hallelujah in a cave where there's mildew there's no life there's not even any light there's no Oxygen but in that cave that goal is still gold Hallelujah and if I could say it like this let me put myself in it when I was in the club dancing to the worldly rap music I was still gold Hallelujah and when your parents were in the bars Hallelujah drinking them nicolos they were still gold well they were in the country club listening to that country music being all depressed they were still gold Hallelujah and so are you in your schools being persecuted still gold in your schools being bullied because you're a Christian still gold Hallelujah because of trial and environment can't change the seed foreign Cain grew up in a good environment he grew up in a Godly household he grew up with parents who knew and heard the voice of God and they ushered those things unto him they saw he saw a true reflection of what God-fearing parents were all about Hallelujah but when it came time for him to demonstrate what's really in his heart he couldn't be that he couldn't reflect that why because that was not in him hallelujah what was in him begin to come out and he saw himself reflecting another life where did it come from his father Hallelujah and it took a certain situation to bring that out Hallelujah and sometimes God put us in certain situations so you can realize where you are in the kingdom of God and you know as young people some of you are very good with playing the role of a chameleon in church you're a saint you're that sweet innocent little daughter that Mama and Papa loves but when you're in school you ticking it and talking it every way you can that's what you're really reflecting that's what's really oh you gather up all your friends come on y'all let's do a tick tock come on let's do a tick tock you know the next time they say let's do a tick tock hey man gather your friends up Holly for those of you who are church church goals and and really want to see God do some of your life the next time they gave you up to do a tick tock I want you to say God Is My Hope God is up to something put that on your tick tock Hallelujah you know I'm not gonna badge you about it because I know some of it is just natural entertainment but when these things consume you when it becomes a part of what you really want to reflect when you have to do the latest Challenge and the this and the that and next thing you know you know some of that stuff is just ridiculous ridiculous and I I and I'm not gonna be a hypocrite I go on to somebody that I laugh too it's all about a good laugh for me but for me to feel like I got to fit in holy when I feel when you feel like if you're not reflecting this you're not doing what's right then it's an evil spirit Hallelujah and it goes that way with any kind of social media or anything that you're on when it starts to get you to be something else that you're not in the kingdom of God then it's the evil spirit holy it's no different Hallelujah from the prophet wanting to go hunting they went hunting and and you get game and everything but God had to check him on that because he was reflecting a murderer he told him I only want you to get what you're allowed to get because he used to go here boom blast everything boo boo boo boo come back with game for everybody breaking the law amen it's on the tape God told him to stop because he was reflecting the wrong thing even though he's a man of God filled with the Holy Ghost but trying to be a people pleaser he was reflecting the wrong thing and God told him stop that I only want you to get what you're allowed to get Hallelujah so what we consider to be on the highest levels of the gospel God is still the same we want to reflect the right thing but when you think of gold earlier gold is sometimes is fouled among dirty nasty conditions but it's still gold oh that made me want to shout Holly because you know sometimes you look in the mirror and you don't feel like nothing you don't feel worthy you're going through a trial everything is messing up messing up in your life but that does not change that you are deity Hallelujah hey you may be on the internet watching us I want you to say to yourself tell the devil shut up stop listening to him Hallelujah stop receiving his thoughts in your mind you are a child of God you are delivered you will be exactly what he wants you to be shut up devil we spend too much time listening to him but when it comes to reflection Julia some of the most priceless things are found in filthy conditions where do you find diamonds they have to be pressed Hallelujah amen they have to be put up under pressure that they may come out and reflect something that's priceless and so do we Hallelujah you are God's diamonds Hallelujah and you have to be put up under pressure so the real you can be formed and come out don't get nervous I ain't gonna be long but when I started think about this this thought of reflection and what a reflection reflecting the Bible says earlier there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death oh my and there's another one that says in Proverbs 21 everywhere of a man is right in his own eyes how often do we fall in that category everything we do is right in our own eyes you know why because we want it but you think about it even even uh relationships if you get to the place where you're like you put it before God and you say Lord Lord I just want your will what if it's God's will for you not to be together can you accept that we want to reflect what he has for us we don't want to try to make something happen in our life that's not God's will Hallelujah because if you partake of that and it's not God's will you're going to reflect Hallelujah disobedience sure every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the Lord pondereth the hearts see God is more concerned right now not how you look on the outside but how you look on the inside and who you are on the inside will take care of the outside because I know I truly believe brother Paul don't waste his time trying to conform people that's not our job we're not here hallelujah as we formers what we're here to do is prayer of God and let the word set you free Hallelujah I could have spent this whole service preaching about the Realms of the sin of the young people but I want you to understand that the wrongs does not identify who you truly are you're false your mistakes your errors it does not truly tell Who You Are but in some cases it's that flower that makes you a masterpiece Hallelujah because even with that flaw you can still reflect what's in God's mind that's what he said about the Statue of Michelangelo it was it was reflecting what was in the image Moses statue was reflecting what was in the image of Michelangelo's mind and when he looked at it he saw those in his mind and it was so real to hit it on the knee and said speak in a reflection of what was in his mind is now looking at him it was so real real until you had to hit it underneath the knee wouldn't you want to be like that you want your life to be so real that God will give you the authority to speak but if we back up normally the first reflection and the only reflection in a lot of things is self-reflection looking at yourself not looking at somebody else because if we just take the outward appearance one thing about this mirror it doesn't know how to lie and it's not in the business of making you feel good when you're not supposed to leave your hair is all over your head and you're looking like Beetlejuice the mirror will reflect that sisters to come up with you and say girl you look nice I like your curls but the mirror is saying this he doesn't know how to lie why because it was created to reflect truth it was created to reflect what's put in front of it Hallelujah and that's all you can get with the word of God Hallelujah if you receive it Hallelujah if you take what's in front of you that's what you'll reflect whether it's the word or whether it's a worldly concept if you receive more of a worldly concept you're going to reflect the world if you receive more of the word of God you're going to reflect the word of God it's very simple like in the terms of you are what you eat Hallelujah you know I'm a person I like sweets I'm sorry I do I like a little bit of Apple Donuts this is my favorite time of year because I get to go to Bennett's and get those apple cookies that we don't have down south and when I'm getting when I get back home I'm really wanted cause I have cookies and those cookies reflect where I've been Hallelujah Hallelujah but I like this time of year amen because amen this season this Autumn season it shows are falling away but it shows a falling away of something natural to something that's beautiful even though it's falling away it still presents the beauty of God and that's how God feels when you fall away from worldly things you present the beauty of God to show that you're not connected to the world you fall away from it and you're changing as you go oh the beauty of God self reflection if I can before I close I want to talk about this story in the Bible well King David one day you know I love talking about David let me tell you young men you know everybody can't be appalled you know a lot of times me and we we read the read the scriptures we want to compare ourselves with power to be Paul Paul is a man of God Paul went through so much adversity you know but a lot of times people not thinking about diversity they're thinking about God saying Paul had an abundance of Revelation coming out of them that's why they want to be like Paul they want to be looked upon to be something mighty I got revelation I'm like Paul be identified with Paul getting bit by a serpent Ben did the Divine spinning a night and day in the sea be identified getting whipped over five times with 40 stripes be identified getting thrown over a wall and then Stone no I don't want to be bald that man went through something be identified being locked up for what you believe being locked up in the wintertime in a jail only eating bread and water with no coat that was the life Paul lived but what was he reflecting Hallelujah Paul had to go through those things why God had to give him to self-reflect in everything he went through because every holy stage of his life was a book in the New Testament Hallelujah he had to go through Hallelujah experiencing love and true love why so he could deal with the Corinthian Church he had to deal with placing and being placed why because he had to deal with the Ephesus Church Hallelujah he had to deal with people hallelujah getting persecuted in church and Paul earlier said don't worry about it put everything he owes on my charge Philemon so everything he went through was a reflection of what he was going to write what about your life as a young person you go through things sometimes it's for somebody else's benefit Hallelujah and the way you go through it could help somebody else although Paul was a mighty man to God I identify more with David but sometimes I shouldn't say something all the time I feel like a giant killer Hallelujah I feel like I was created to kill Giants honey I feel like when my brothers and sisters Hallelujah don't have the strength to fight I say send me I'll stand out there and fight that devil holy you say Brothers how can you say it cause just like David I'm not going out there with My Own Strength I'm going I just said to Rebecca with my testimony Hallelujah David had a testimony that were reflect in every battle Hallelujah before he fought Goliath what did he do he started to reflect he started to have self-reflection he said oh I fought a bear reflection I thought a liar a reflection a Goliath you're going to be just like that what do you do when you're going through you need to have self-reflection so not only do I identify with the strength of David identify with the Falls of David because one thing about David Hurley he was a man after God's very own heart and before I get that Gabby there's something else about David I identify with Hallelujah David loved to dance oh yeah David loved the worship and David didn't get what you message believersy David didn't care what quotes you could bring out what scriptures you can bring out David said you thought that was a dance let me Slim you come and find me tomorrow in service you come see me next week Hallelujah you thought I worshiped him you watched me with my song come on but what I want you to understand about David being a man under God's very own heart to the church members to his own wife he looked like he was out of order but he had a heart of God he looked Church in that moment when the Ark of the Covenant was coming back and David started to dance I'm about to say something now when David started to dance because he had a heart of God that day his death was doing would have been the same day as God would have did because he was a man of the God's very old heart what was he doing he was reflecting Christ he was reflecting Liberty he was reflecting what it means when the true word comes back into your church and we have the true word in our church and we sit here like a bunch of bumps on the law oh man no I'm not trying to excite anybody I'm trying to get you to see either you're a reflecting Christ or you're reflecting another image Hallelujah in Jersey I love about David fought battles David went through things that were unexplainable holy and one thing about David I'm gonna take this story and I'm about to wind down you just one day David had battled out the battle he had Victory out of the victory amen really did we ever hear about David losing and when he lost Hallelujah it was something God was trying to do Holly well go back and fight those same people after God made it clear and win Hallelujah so he had ups and downs amen but God was always with him but what I love about David was what he reflected in his good days well the same thing he reflected in his bad days that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want Hallelujah the Lord is on my side what shall man do unto me that's what David reflected Hallelujah and I say church I'm not boasting but that's how I feel sometimes amen amen when there are no explanations and there's no answers God has to be on my side church and now David after all these battles he fought and all these victories you've helped the church win one day he decided to take a rest new cars and different things he said there's nothing wrong with a new car he says but sometimes our car is working fine smoking fine is getting where you're supposed to go is doing what it's supposed to do paint job may not be all that but it's served its purpose but then they come out with something new and it has a new Egypt in it it has a new Gidget in it and you're like oh I think I want that oh that new Gidget I think I want that New Egypt well you can have it for 40 000. and you go out here where you're free you're free from debt you're free from it all and you go get another 40 000 on top because of an idiot or a Gidget it's reflecting something else though it's reflecting that satisfied now I'm not preaching against having new cars because when God blessed me with my Maserati I don't want to hear your mouth I want to hear it I'll tell you right now the interior might be red so don't bother me don't bother me God bless me with it don't bother me praise God hallelujah it's just another car Hallelujah that's all it is no matter what you drive no matter where it takes you it's just another car but I know friends who got Teslas and they were like hey you want to drive it I say nope say well I don't want to drive it I say it's too technical anything that can stop on his own and drive on his own it don't need me to get behind it I'm good you just go ahead and drive it I'm all right don't want nothing to do with Tesla and anyway it's a part of Prophecy and not good prophecy so you can have your tonight I ain't saying you shouldn't buy no Tesla don't don't bring those uncertain Sound by what I'm saying Holy by whatever God allows you to buy it's on you but anyway let's get back to David David you guys are like he's talking about this and he's talking about that and he's talking about this he talked about that God you know what God does God is like a quarterback some of us are running and you ain't paying attention to God will hit you in the back of the head you thought I said you was going to catch it no it's in the back of the head so you should have been paying attention you know that's what happened to receivers well they're not penetration not running they route right they get hit with the ball and sometimes we're out there on the field and we're not paying attention you're gonna get hit with the ball there's a story I'll tell you real quick about Magic Johnson you know why they call him magic because he can throw passes and everything when nobody's expecting it and one of his teammates James Worthy he realized he had to have his eyes on him at all times how did he come to that reality he kept getting hit in the face so even when he wasn't expecting to get the ball he always had his eyes on the point guard why because he kept getting hit in the face Hallelujah in church there are times Hallelujah God may be dealing with somebody else but he wants your attention also because there might be something in there for you you might not know what is coming but you got to keep your eyes on God and he said it'd be people running all down the court and they you know are you unready I don't want to be like that with God when he acts for it I want to be able to give it to him one of one of the one of the scriptures that I look at is when he goes up to that fig tree and he asks for figs from that tree out of its natural season but I want you to realize this is God speaking to the tree this is the creator Hallelujah so if I was that tree I would have gave up figs and the tree gets cursed in that moment because it didn't give God what he asked for and when they came back the tree was withered Hallelujah I want to be a person no matter what your season looks like when God acts of me I'm able to come forth with it but David real quick David he already had 500 wives and now he takes Bathsheba and we know him and but she will have relations and all these things and Bathsheba gets pregnant and but Bathsheba has a husband and now David sees that Beersheba is with child and David don't want it to reflect what he did wrong so now what he's going to do he's going to do everything sneaky he can do to try to get out of it what does he reflecting he's not reflecting King David one who fears God no he's reflecting a man who has secrets you know he's trying to cover up his secrets but catch it this is a man under God's very own heart now let me encourage you a little bit even though David was doing all this did it stop him from being King he still was King still was a man after God's very own heart but in this moment Hallelujah he was reflecting the wrong thing and you can go back and read it but I'm gonna kind of paraphrase it to get out of here amen he goes through different things he brings your Rider back home and and tries to get you right or go home and sleep with his wife and write like no Uriah is going to reflect his faithfulness to the man that's doing him wrong young people what are you reflecting to your parents that are taking care of you what are you reflecting to the ones that feed you and put money in your pocket and make sure you got clothes on your back what are you reflecting sure in Uriah he says man I can't just go home and relax and when we out here fighting this battle they was like go ahead man go on fight go and fight right like no I can't do it so he gets you right here drunk thinking everything is going to work out Uriah still stays away from it Hallelujah even in all it's trickery it still didn't come out the way David wanted to come out so make a long story shot David in that moment he was reflecting a liar he was reflecting a murderer he was reflecting an adulterer all these things he was reflecting but he was still a man after God's very own heart really Diggs you're so confusing how can he be all that and still a man of God's very own heart it's simple if you take a I would say a hurricane but that's more in my area you take a blizzard y'all better cast that down now I don't receive that but you take a blizzard that comes through Michigan Ohio and that blizzard comes the weight of the snow and the ice it tears down trees and rips off Limbs and does all these things in the cold in the blizzard does the blizzard stop the apple tree from being an apple tree does it stop it from reflecting what's truly on the inside it was just something it had to go through Hallelujah in 19th out of 10 that blizzard Hallelujah Boaz is here oh boy Z and his wife are very familiar with maple syrup and those of you who may not know to get that good good that good good good good good good good good maple syrup they have to experience temperatures of freezing really really cold cold temperatures why because that drives down a serp in the tree the cold it is the better the seasons for good maple syrup honey and we're like oh my this surface so good you don't know what the Canadians had to put up with to give us that good sir I thank God for because I just love it Hallelujah but they have to have cold cold really cold temperatures the colder the winter the more Cirque they get and the better the surface the colder the winter if they have mild real mild winters like we have in South Carolina you just take that surface say trash we don't want that that's trash see it's the conditions of the cold which gives it and makes it what it is Holly when you and I'll be like nah I want that so in one place it's wanted in another place is not wanted you take David and David's done all this wrong Uriah is dead and he feels like he's good everything is good now you know you're uh she's but she was having a baby God hardly wouldn't let the baby live Dave is in there fasting and praying that God will have mercy and all these things let's turn to second Samuel I'm about to come down II Samuel uh let's go to chapter 12. second Samuel chapter 12. everybody all right praise God Hallelujah second Samuel chapter 12. foreign listen let's start at verse 7. you know I'ma Walker so put that up there for me praise God I want you to read along with me what are we talking about what are you reflecting let's read he says and Nathan said to David let's back up a little bit let's back up to let me see what verse I want you know what let's let's just start at verse one 12-1 let's go the Bible said the Lord said Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor and the rich man had exceeding Mighty flocks and herds the poor man had nothing save one little Elam which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children and it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he's spared and he spared to take of his own flock and of his of his own herd and dress of the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that would come to him sound like a very bad man don't it let's read and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth that man have done this thing shall surely die now the Giant Killer is coming out of David is on the inside he knows what this man did was wrong and David's so angry at this man next verse and he said and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no Penny now look at David David is not ready to have no mercy on this man David ready to kill somebody David ready to operate in the authority of a king imma make him give it back he said his anger was killed against him now look verse 7 and Nathan said to David thou art that man take it down we won't come back David said and they just said David now that man so let's go back David wanted to kill that man David wanted to have no pity on that man so let's examine what David was really saying I want to kill myself because that's who he saw that's who David was talking about him and David's looking at what this man did which this man was really him and David wanted to kill that man he wanted to kill himself they was angry with who he was angry with himself church but he couldn't see it all the stuff David was doing he couldn't self-reflect and that's what happens sometimes as young people you get so caught up in things that you don't even realize you're wrong it takes a true anointed word to come and show you your wrongs put it back up there verse 7. and they just said to David thou are the man and thus the Lord God of Israel I anointed the king of Israel and I deliver thee out of the hand of Saul next verse and I gave thee that Master's house and that Master's wives into the bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel of Judah and if thou had been too little I would moreover have given unto thee such and such are things you don't have to seek your pleasures and joy in the world all you got to do is ask God Hallelujah next verse wherefore as thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to evil to do evil in his sight and thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be that wife has taken his wife to be that wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Israel of amnon now look David's done all this but he wasn't able to self-reflect he was caught up in the midst of it next verse now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house because thou has despised me and has taken thy wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife next verse thus said the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of the thine own house and I will take thy was before the eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and thou shalt lie with our wives and in the sight of the son for thou did Us in secret but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun that's why the Bible says what you do in the dark will come to the light of the light one way or another you're going to reflect now the thing of it is do you want God to bring it out or would you rather let's be like David let's go and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord look at David didn't try to wiggle his way out David didn't try to say you know it wasn't me the difference between Saul and David David could self-reflect David could self-reflected his role David could say I have sinned when God came to Saul about disobeying the Commandment Saul said it was the people young people can you self-reflect when you're wrong you're wrong just make it right with God and move on Hallelujah David couldn't reflect except it came through the voice of a prophet Hallelujah when you're going through these don't stay out of church don't put the message down because it was the voice of the Prophet that made David's self-reflect and it's the voice of the Prophet that brought us all our denominations it was the voice of the Prophet Hallelujah that made us good husbands and good wives it allowed us the ability to self-reflect and David said underneath that I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also have put away thy sin thou shall not die he was supposed to die but because he could self-reflect and make his wrongs right God blotted out his sins where the scripture says is not imputed unto him Hallelujah why because really in his heart he didn't mean to do it there we are young people a lot of times we get caught up and we do things that we really don't mean to do all God wants you to do is self-reflect come musicians all God wants you to do is just repent and make it right and when you can self-reflect God can give you Mercy Hallelujah if we go back to Saul earlier because Saul said was the people it was just it was that God put away Saul and made the anointing leave his life and from that point on he was led by an evil spirit because he couldn't Hallelujah self-reflect in the moment where God was showing him himself and I wonder if God is showing anybody tonight themselves where you are spiritually notice this message tonight is a message of encouragement because one thing I want you to understand when I first started preaching I told you you were what go you are deity there's gold inside of you but when you make mistakes like David don't hold on to it repent make it right therefore you can go on with God Hallelujah because that mistake that trial or whatever it may be it doesn't change the life of the seed inside without repentance it can make life more rough but if you belong to God he's gonna get you You Gonna Come before I like to say God it's like a bounty hunter brother Kenny's like a bounty hunter and he has a picture of each one of you that are wanted and some of you there's a large reward on your head Hallelujah and he'll see the Bounty Hunter out to get you he has your picture and somebody hunt us they just want the reward Hallelujah so they don't care Hallelujah they'll they'll they'll sail they'll put on the poster they'll say Wanted Dead or Alive because whether you're dead or alive that Bounty Hunter's still going to get paid you know what a good Bounty Hunter a real Bounty Hunter does when he finds out where you're at he'll proposition you he'll say hey pull that gun out on you let's just say I'm the Bounty Hunter tonight he'll pull that gun out on you say hey there's two ways we can do this you can receive what I'm saying that I've been sent from greater powers and I've come to get you and you can come and go quietly or I can take this gun and bust you across the head and drag you behind my horse but you're gonna come one way or another so either come quietly or you're gonna come Kicking and Screaming but one way or another you're gonna come now I don't know privileges some of us had to get knocked across the head but we're here Hallelujah trying to get whipped Hallelujah some of us had to get dragged but nevertheless I'm here young people I'm saying to you tonight you don't have to come all wild and struggling and Lord I don't want no just give up and say Lord be it unto me let me tell you something this world is not going to get any better Church we're almost back to the day where we're having concentration camps don't you realize Hallelujah young people don't you realize there's a war going on that's almost resembling what Hitler did to the Jews that that you have a man in control who doesn't care about anybody including people into a war who don't want to fight able to answer them from 18 to 35 if you're here you got to fight me and start leaving the country this world is not going to get any better so I say to you young people choose me this day who you want to reflect don't be like Saul make excuses for everybody else and that didn't start with Saul and start with Adam he was a woman did a woman say did a woman say he was a serpent everybody blaming somebody you know what when it comes to your soul you're not going to be able to blame anybody because one thing about God God will always keep himself blameless whatever word you may think hallelujah or whatever way you may think that you have out of it God has already presented a way out of it you say well I have experienced this and I've been hurt and I've been that I guarantee you God has brought a word for your deliverance and you didn't receive it the grace of God what are you reflecting it took the voice of a prophet to show David himself and once David could reflect then he could make it right and as he made it right God had mercy what are you all through the scriptures there were men who did things that wasn't of the character of God but it took them to get in a certain situations where they could see themselves you took Jacob he lied he cheated all these things from neighboring house to his house on and on and on and on until he had to go back and meet Esau did he had to self-reflect and once he began to self-reflect he met God in a way like never before God changed his name God changed his walk Hallelujah and he went back to meet Esau as a prince why because he was able to self-reflect young people you know where you are you know where you're standing you know your faults your failures you know your Temptations you know all the areas that are stunting your growth right now and let me say this most of you are without excuse because you're in a church preaching true words true anointing there's nothing added to it there's nothing taken away and you should be getting closer to God and if you're not getting closer to God the only reason why is yourself because you have every opportunity what are you feeding on what are you listening to what's what are you hungering after what's on the inside reflecting I think we spend too much time waiting on a better day well maybe the next Tri-State well maybe the next state God won't speak to you like this because he gave you a chance already he may deal with somebody else's heart that's why the scripture says the day you hear his heart huh the day you hear his voice heart not your heart Hallelujah so why don't we just give God a true surrender let's reflect on what's going on in the inside bring your issues to God and say Lord deliver me from this and it wasn't that easy Once David confessed God gave him Mercy just like that and he's still the same God he's not a respective person the prophet of God say let's be identified with Bible characters and I want you to be able to say if you've made mistakes like David what you can do you can go to God or you can say God you forgave David I want that same forgiveness and when you do that you tie his hands because he's not a respective person hallelujah how many believe it tonight about 10 of you I guess the rest of us are ready for a rapture fill my cup Lord I lift it up Lord foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] feel my Lord Hallelujah [Music] this testing of my soul [Music] Feed me more here's my cup fill it up and make me everybody lift up your cup to the Lord [Music] coming [Applause] of my soul

let's make this song reflect that we have a need and we want our cups filled we want to be fed by The Bread of Heaven we want our souls to be touched right now in this moment whatever's going on in the inside whether you need streets or whether you need healing whether you need encouragement whether you just need a peace of mind I want you to speak that unto God and believe that he could feel your cup today come on feel my car [Music] is the Thirsty of my soul [Music] [Applause] feed me till I want no more here's my cup fill it up and make me oh one more time from the depths of your heart feel my cup feel my God our Lord [Music] oh no more fill my cup fill it up and make me home oh yes Lord thank you Jesus for the word tonight Lord thank you that our hearts are softened before you Lord may we give you an obedient heart to you tonight Lord and the the true image of the mirror of the word of God is put before us Lord that's the only real true image God we can look at ourselves and see ourselves the way that you intended for us to be May every young person tonight be drawn to you feel drawn tonight to stop looking at the images of the world and start trying to reflect the images of the world but tonight for them to make a choice to turn to you and your word look in the mirror of your word and Lord as James said in the Bible we look and we keep gazing upon it and Lord we don't have to change ourselves we are changed from glory to glory to glory and you make us into the image that you intended for us to be whether they catch it tonight may all of us catch a deeper Walk with You Lord and have our faces looking into the right thing that can be the reflection Lord of what you intended in Genesis 1 26 the reflection of the son of God Imaging the father that's what we want that's what we desire Lord You're Beautiful tonight Oh Lord You're beautiful your face is all I see changes tonight I pray take these young people's hearts Lord that is praying and speaking you tonight and Lord sitting and listening so intently Lord and listening to our brother take their lives and mold them and make them Lord and if there's mistakes like David and several men in the Bible we know Lord that that with those mistakes Lord you could never change nothing could ever change their calling David was still the king and Lord we see he sinned and failed and yet Lord you used your Prophet to come back to him again you didn't ditch him you didn't say you're finished you didn't say you're not King anymore but Lord you came and came right to him and put the mirror right in front of him and when he's seen the true mirror he said I have sinned and Lord in a moment's time your Prophet said I forgive you I forgive you of all of it Lord Lord that's the mirror we want to look at tonight and I pray you touch these hearts Lord my burden is for the young people Lord in these times in these dark moments Lord when there's such a a pull to the things of the world and there's so many images Lord because we live in this time of our phones Lord it used to be we'd go to a movie or we would go to something or we see a billboard with images that weren't of the Right image and we'd try to reflect that now Lord the young people have their phones where constant images are placed in front of them all the time to distract them from the true image of God lord I intercede for their lives tonight Lord that they would pull away from looking at the wrong image and they would look into the word of God look into the message look into their Bibles Lord and look into the very face of Jesus Christ and Lord as you as they do that and and just discipline themselves to say well Lord I want to look at the right thing you transform them into the Right image the way that they're intended to be my burden is for them I pray you'll bless them tonight as we bring this service to a close I pray these things will just linger with them for many days now that they would Ponder where they're at and ponder their place in you Lord and look at the right things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe that you'll do it father in Jesus name we ask it how many can say in Jesus name in Jesus all things are possible in Jesus name tonight you might still feel I can't do it well that's good you can't do it but he can do it in your life amen don't let the devil tell you other a different identity you might be in an identity crisis tonight forget the world's identity forget what the devil's telling you and look on the inside and say I'm only interested in one identity and that's what God said that I am can you say praise the Lord
