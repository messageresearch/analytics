[25:08] But uh before we do his dedication here,
[25:11] um just a little backstory in the song,
[25:14] I think is honestly this last week when
[25:16] I I call Leo Bubby sometimes
[25:20] and uh just when I talk to him and uh I
[25:23] think Olivia caught she was like,
[25:25] "There's a song that says Bub on it or
[25:27] something like that." And then she
[25:29] started singing the song and then uh I
[25:32] listened to the song. I loved it. I was
[25:33] like, I think I'm going to sing that for
[25:34] his dedication. A day later, um Ryan
[25:38] Snow text me and it was just he had no
[25:40] context at all. He just sent me the
[25:42] song, the same exact song. And I was
[25:45] just uh I was like, Lord, this is this
[25:47] is what I want, you know? I want the
[25:50] song is simply um I want to be like you
[25:53] because he wants to be like me.
[25:56] We have such an impact on our child's
[25:58] life and I want to I want to have the
[26:00] that reflection just shining through me,
[26:02] his reflection shining through me. So,

[26:26] hug. He calls me dad and I call him bug
[26:31] with his faded old pillow, a bear named
[26:34] Pooh. He snuggles up close and says, "I
[26:38] want to be like you."
[26:41] [Music]
[26:47] I tuck him in bed and I kiss him good
[26:50] night. tripping over his toys. As I turn
[26:53] out the light, I whisper a prayer that
[26:57] someday he'll see. He's got a father in

[28:12] best. Being patient and kind, filled
[28:14] with your tenderness. Cuz I know that

[31:33] us. So we want to bear that image of him
[31:36] as the very best we can in all of our
[31:38] mistakes. We want to bear that image of
[31:40] Christ. So, we appreciate how many
[31:42] enjoyed that song. That was good,
[31:43] Gideon. Praise the Lord.
[31:47] I didn't
[31:49] I think that's the first time we had a
[31:51] song with Pooh Bear in it.
[31:54] I'm going have to check the quotes on
[31:56] that. I don't know. That was
[32:00] It's in there somewhere. Okay. Praise
[32:02] the Lord. Well, I I wanted to read a
[32:05] scripture here this morning. maybe a
[32:06] couple scriptures, but one that caught
[32:08] my attention a couple days ago, and um
[32:13] this might be a little different for
[32:15] dedication, but it it speaks of
[32:18] something that's for all of us, and it
[32:20] is related to our children. You'll find
[32:22] that here in the last verse, but Psalms
[32:24] 103 and verse 8
[32:28] says, "The Lord is merciful and
[32:30] gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
[32:33] in mercy. And when David says that, it
[32:37] reminded me of the service brother
[32:39] Brandham preached. God rich in mercy. So
[32:42] these scriptures about his mercy and his
[32:45] mercy being plenteous to us. He will not
[32:48] always chide, neither will he keep his
[32:51] anger forever. He hath not dealt with us
[32:54] after our sins, nor rewarded us
[32:57] according to our iniquities. For as
[33:00] heaven is high above the earth, so great
[33:02] is his mercy toward them that fear him.
[33:06] As far as the east is from the west, so
[33:08] far hath he removed our transgressions
[33:11] from us. Like as a father pityth his
[33:14] children, and that means he loves them.
[33:16] A father loves his children, so the Lord
[33:19] pityth or loveth them that fear him. For
[33:22] he knoweth our afraid. He rememberth
[33:25] that we are just dust. As for man, his
[33:28] days as a gr or as his grass, as the
[33:31] flower of the field, so he flourisheth,
[33:33] for the wind passeth over it, and it is
[33:35] gone, and the place thereof shall know
[33:37] it no more. In other words, everything
[33:41] here and everything that we have may end
[33:43] someday. It probably will, but it says,
[33:46] but the mercy of the Lord is from
[33:49] everlasting to everlasting. There's one
[33:51] thing that'll never end, and that's the
[33:53] mercy of the Lord. It's continual.
[33:57] And the way he words it here at the
[33:58] last, he says, "The mercy of the Lord is
[34:00] from everlasting to everlasting un upon
[34:03] them that fear him and his righteousness
[34:06] unto children's children."
[34:10] Brother Reggie, that's where you and I
[34:11] stand today. And um I have a little
[34:16] sermon I preached through the years,
[34:18] different places has been a blessing to
[34:19] people, but it's based on God rich in
[34:21] mercy. and I title it living in
[34:24] conditions that need a God rich in
[34:26] mercy. And when you take those places in
[34:29] the Bible that are extreme times,
[34:31] extreme immorality, extreme uh uh
[34:35] compromise, and then the fruits of that
[34:38] is to have our children raised in a
[34:40] world that just so contrary to the
[34:42] precepts of God. And it actually brings
[34:44] a little scare when you look at this new
[34:47] generation. There's such a joy here
[34:48] today. And yet there's a little concern
[34:50] because if God terries and time goes on
[34:53] and this little boy grows up, he's going
[34:55] to grow in a world that's already bad
[34:58] and getting worse all the time. But what
[35:01] I found in the scripture and we can even
[35:03] go back to Moses day when God sent the
[35:05] prophet Moses and there was 400 years
[35:08] that God promised. He says, "My children
[35:10] will go into bondage, my people, but
[35:13] I'll bring them out by a mighty hand."
[35:15] But he waited until the cupanic of
[35:17] iniquity was full. And when the cupanic
[35:20] of iniquity was full, which reached the
[35:22] end of their slavery in Egypt, then his
[35:25] promises, his promise kicked in. And it
[35:28] was his mercies during the time of the
[35:31] worst times of slavery. That's when his
[35:33] mercies begin to rise. And whenever you
[35:36] see a decline going in the generation to
[35:38] immorality and a place that's unfit to
[35:41] raise your children, you know what? may
[35:43] find an increase in the mercies of God.
[35:46] I think every parent ought to say,
[35:47] "Praise the Lord this morning because
[35:49] when things get worse in the world," he
[35:51] says, "I need more of my mercy." Can you
[35:53] say, "Amen." Conditions that need, how
[35:56] many would raise your hand, and say, "I
[35:57] need a God rich in mercy." He titled it
[36:00] rich. He's not sparing in mercy. We need
[36:03] more of his mercies. We need his mercies
[36:05] to raise our children. Can parents say
[36:07] amen? We need more of his mercies. We we
[36:09] we are living in a society that's
[36:11] declining and God has in in in he's
[36:14] inclining in his mercies. I think we can
[36:17] apply this to raising our children as
[36:19] well. I think we can can apply it that
[36:23] the father is pitiful towards his
[36:24] children. He's loving to his children.
[36:26] He's merciful to his children. And this
[36:28] might be a good lesson for all parents
[36:30] is that we need to be merciful to our
[36:32] children. We need to love our children
[36:34] more than we ever have. We need to care
[36:37] for our children. We need to be
[36:38] sensitive to our children all the while
[36:41] training them in the principles of God.
[36:43] But to be pitiful like our father is to
[36:46] have mercy on our kids and give them
[36:48] care and love through all these times
[36:52] and through all their seasons and stages
[36:54] of life. If the father is pitiful
[36:57] towards that to us, we need to be that
[36:59] way for our children. They need love.
[37:02] They need sensitivity. They need
[37:04] instruction. They need correction. but
[37:06] no correction without a caring for their
[37:09] hearts. Can you say amen? So the promise
[37:12] is also that the mercies would increase
[37:16] and pass on. This is the good one that I
[37:18] like. His mercies will pass on and
[37:20] increase and they'll pass on to unto the
[37:24] children's children. And that's a great
[37:26] promise that I can hang on to today.
[37:28] Many things will end.
[37:32] Your possessions will end. Many things
[37:34] in life will end. We'll lose people.
[37:36] We'll lose loved ones. Things will come
[37:38] to an end. But his mercies will never
[37:41] come to an end. And his mercies will
[37:43] increase as we need it more. Praise the
[37:46] Lord. I'm thankful for that this
[37:48] morning. And I just want to I wanted to
[37:50] read another one. If you hold this,
[37:52] honey. I And this one here is for me and
[37:54] Brother Reggie. Proverbs 17:6.
[37:58] Just reading dedication scriptures, but
[38:01] I'm including brother Reggie and I.
[38:04] Proverbs 17:6, if you get to know this
[38:07] family, you fall in love with them. And
[38:10] they have
[38:12] laid in the precepts.
[38:15] [Music]
[38:16] Thank you.
[38:21] I'm just finishing what I said about
[38:22] Egypt. When they were in slavery, God's
[38:24] mercy
[38:27] sent a prophet
[38:30] and sent a prophet with the word. And
[38:33] when we come to Satan's Eden in the last
[38:35] days, when we come to this extreme
[38:37] condition, God's mercies send us a
[38:40] messenger, send us a message, we have an
[38:43] we have a we have a we have a strength
[38:46] in this word. When we parents and even
[38:49] churches don't have the strength for
[38:51] this age, God's mercies sent us a word
[38:54] to stabilize us and give us something to
[38:57] raise children. My dad said, he said,
[39:00] even if I found out all this was wrong
[39:02] at the end, he said, I'd still raise my
[39:05] children under this message. It's the
[39:07] best thing God has ever sent. Praise the
[39:10] Lord.
[39:12] He says here that
[39:16] um children's children are the crown of
[39:20] old men.
[39:23] So, we got a crown in many ways, not
[39:24] just the gray.
[39:27] Children's children are the crown of old
[39:28] men and the glory of children are their
[39:31] fathers. And that means fathers that are
[39:34] trying to raise their families in a
[39:36] godly way. Godly fathers. I appreciate
[39:39] this godly father. I appreciate all the
[39:41] godly fathers. And the children's glory
[39:44] are fathers like that. Praise the Lord.
[39:47] God bless you this morning.
[39:59] Oh my.
[40:01] Good looking. And it didn't come from
[40:04] us, guys.
[40:06] That's for sure. You're not going to
[40:08] wake up for this, bud? You're not going
[40:10] to wake up for this?
[40:12] No. He said no. Okay.
[40:19] Heavenly Father,
[40:22] I am moved this morning
[40:25] to be dedicating this boy to you
[40:33] or someone would ask me years ago that
[40:35] I'd be dedicating my grandson.
[40:39] I never would have dreamed we'd come to
[40:40] this day.
[40:42] But Lord, we bring them to you because
[40:45] at the end of the day, Lord, we we
[40:47] really don't have the strength within
[40:49] ourselves. We don't have in our own
[40:53] strength the boundaries and the
[40:54] protections,
[40:56] but your word has provided those things.
[40:58] Lord, there's a token to apply to our
[41:00] homes. There are precepts. There are
[41:04] many things that you've given us, and
[41:06] they're timeless. And even in the worst
[41:08] of ages, if we'll apply those, Lord,
[41:11] then our children as we dedicated to
[41:13] you, we'll be protected. We'll be loved,
[41:16] and we'll be watched over even by
[41:18] angels, as the scripture says. We pray
[41:21] that you'll do that for little Leo
[41:23] Joshua Leontaine.
[41:25] We pray, Father, as this legacy
[41:27] continues on. And I would have loved for
[41:29] my dad to be here today. But God, we
[41:32] pray that the the Holy Ghost that he
[41:35] held in front of us and that I hold in
[41:37] front of my children, in front of this
[41:39] church, Lord, within that is the mercies
[41:41] of God to put your hand over this child
[41:45] and all of our children. Lord, take
[41:47] little Leo and use him for your kingdom.
[41:50] Watch over him. Keep him from harm and
[41:52] danger. Put your angels around him,
[41:54] Father, as we give him back to you. He
[41:57] is yours, Lord. We take him as a gift.
[41:59] We be as stewards over him and bless
[42:03] Gideon and Olivia. Give them wisdom as
[42:05] parents. I pray we give this little boy
[42:08] back to you at the end of the day, Lord.
[42:10] He's in your protection. He's in your
[42:12] love. Bless their family. Bless the
[42:15] Ramlo family, Lord. Bless our family as
[42:18] you continue to guide us, Lord, and
[42:21] navigate through this age. Help our
[42:24] children. And may your mercies just
[42:26] increase. May your love and mercy and
[42:30] Holy Ghost come to all of our children.
[42:32] We pray. We give little Leo to you in
[42:36] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[42:54] [Music]
[43:02] God bless you. Praise the Lord.
[43:05] Amen.
[43:12] I'm going to tell what you said, Brother
[43:14] Reggie. He said, "I hope he doesn't
[43:16] sleep through all your sermons."
[43:20] You know, he slept through the
[43:21] dedication. I guess he will.
[43:24] If you don't mind, we're blessed to have
[43:26] brother Jason Dear and his family with
[43:28] us today. They were coming through and
[43:31] uh going to just come through and listen
[43:32] to us, but you know, we're glad we can
[43:34] hear from him today. We support him, his
[43:37] work and mission work and stuff. So, I
[43:39] don't want to take more of his time, but
[43:40] we did have children back in school and
[43:42] are going back in school this week. And
[43:44] I want to do that right now in light of
[43:46] this scripture. His mercies are to every
[43:48] generation and they increase. And all of
[43:51] us, we just need to pray for our kids
[43:53] now as they start the school year. Would
[43:54] all the kids come up front here and
[43:56] we'll lay hands on you. Come on kids.
[43:58] Come on.
[44:02] Let's pray over them. Teenagers, college
[44:04] students, 60 year olds in college,
[44:07] whatever you are.
[44:11] Boy, we got a great bunch of kids and
[44:13] young people in this church. Bunch of
[44:16] good kids.
[44:18] [Music]
[44:22] The steadfast
[44:24] love of the Lord is forever.
[44:29] [Music]
[44:37] For they knew
[44:40] every morning.
[44:42] new
[44:44] every morning.
[44:47] Great is thy faithfulness,
[44:52] oh Lord.
[44:56] Great is thy faithful.
[44:59] We'll sing it one more time. How many
[45:01] grateful for the steadfast love? The
[45:04] steadfast
[45:06] love of the Lord
[45:09] never ceases. His mercies
[45:14] never
[45:16] come. I'm so glad to an end for their
[45:21] new every morning.
[45:26] New every morning.
[45:30] Great is thy faithfulness,
[45:34] oh Lord.
[45:38] Great is thy faithfulness.
[45:43] Where is Lily Riker? Where's Lily Riker?
[45:49] Lily,
[45:51] is it your birthday today? Oh my
[45:54] goodness. What a perfect Turn around.
[45:56] Say everybody say happy birthday to
[45:58] Lily.
[46:00] Wow.
[46:04] You got anything to say?
[46:07] I'm surprised. Wow. She don't have
[46:09] nothing to say. We love you guys and
[46:12] we're praying for you while you go to
[46:13] school. Do your best and put the rest in
[46:16] the hands of the Lord. But do your very
[46:17] best and God will watch over you. Do
[46:20] your best for all the test and then pray
[46:22] that God takes over. Amen. We love you
[46:26] all. Let's pray for you. Everybody stand
[46:28] and let's pray for our children, young
[46:29] people.
[46:31] Precious Jesus, we close our eyes and
[46:33] bow our heads, Lord, in honor, respect
[46:35] to you, Lord, and all these promises of
[46:38] your mercy are to them that fear you to
[46:41] uh rever you, Lord. In other words, we
[46:43] we respect your precepts. We respect
[46:45] your principles, your word, Lord. And we
[46:48] want to be that people that has the
[46:50] respect and fear of God for those things
[46:52] and obey those things. We believe many
[46:55] of the children here, Lord, are they
[46:57] have such a heart toward you. May we
[46:59] continue to direct them in the right
[47:00] way. But Lord, now they go back to
[47:02] school and they go back to their
[47:04] teachers, Father. Maybe they're
[47:06] homeschooled. Maybe they're in public
[47:08] school. Maybe they're in Christian
[47:09] school. But Lord, wherever they're at,
[47:10] we ask for you to watch over them. And
[47:14] we realize, as I said this morning, the
[47:16] age is declining and the the the
[47:18] filthiness and the dirtiness, Lord, and
[47:21] just all the images and things that
[47:23] young people can get their hands on.
[47:25] Lord, would you just give them something
[47:27] in their heart? Keep them protected from
[47:29] it, Lord. Keep your angels around them,
[47:31] we pray. And Lord, when many of them
[47:33] been baptized and some still, Lord,
[47:35] looking to baptism, we pray, Lord, you'd
[47:37] give them that gift of the Holy Ghost
[47:39] for the promises unto us and our
[47:42] children. We pray you'll fill them. That
[47:44] is the strength that they need to be
[47:45] able to combat this age. God, we pray
[47:48] you'll watch over them until that time.
[47:50] And Lord, those that have the Holy
[47:52] Ghost, may they be filled and more and
[47:54] more with your spirit. May they become
[47:56] witnesses in their schools. May they
[47:58] hold up the banner, Lord, of Christlike
[48:00] ways. Oh God, I just pray you put your
[48:03] hand upon every child, every teenager
[48:05] that's here, every college student, oh
[48:08] God, just walk with them through those
[48:10] halls, Lord, and walk with them. Uh when
[48:13] they're around other students, Lord,
[48:14] that may not be the best influence. I
[48:17] pray, Lord, that you watch over them,
[48:19] Lord. May they find if they find
[48:20] friends, let it be the right kind of
[48:22] friends, Lord. Let them form
[48:24] relationship with the right kind of
[48:26] people. I pray and we just ask for your
[48:28] loving protection over their lives. And
[48:31] we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Everybody
[48:34] said amen. God bless you guys. God be
[48:37] with you. New every morning.
[48:42] Great is thy faithfulness.
[48:47] Oh Lord. Oh, great is thy faithfulness.
[48:55] I love this. The steadfast love. Sing
[48:57] it. The steadfast
[49:01] love
[49:02] of the Lord never ceases.
[49:07] His mercies
[49:09] never
[49:11] come to an end
[49:15] for the new
[49:17] every morning.
[49:19] There new
[49:21] every morning.
[49:23] [Music]
[49:25] Great is thy faithfulness.
[49:29] Oh Lord, I'm glad they're new.

[49:37] new
[49:39] every morning.
[49:42] Great is thy faithfulness.
[49:44] [Music]
[49:48] Praise be to God. Do you love him this
[49:49] morning? Let's give the Lord praise.
[49:51] Let's give him a hand clap. He's worthy
[49:53] this morning of his mercies. Praise the
[49:55] Lord.
[49:57] We're going to turn it over to brother
[49:59] Jason and take his liberty this morning.
[50:01] If you would remember the 21st of
[50:03] September this month coming up, we'll
[50:05] have another family day. We have brother
[50:07] Barry Coffee here bringing some sessions
[50:09] for the families. There'll be not four
[50:11] sessions, but three. So, you'll see the
[50:13] flyer for that and what you can plan to
[50:16] spend that day. be some good teaching on
[50:18] the families. We have two of these this
[50:20] year. We had one with brother Steve
[50:22] Basson and also brother Barry. And so
[50:24] you want to utilize this time
[50:25] encouraging everybody to be here and be
[50:28] a part of that. It won't be as long a
[50:30] day this time, but we're wanting to get
[50:32] that teaching in not only here but on
[50:34] the videos for future reference to
[50:36] strengthen the families. We need that
[50:37] help in this day. So we appreciate you
[50:39] remembering that on 21st. God bless you,
[50:41] brother Jason. Let's give Brother Jason
[50:43] a hand as he comes this morning.
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:49] Amen. God bless you all. So wonderful to
[50:52] be back. Uh so many different people. I
[50:55] have so many friends here that I just uh
[50:58] wish I could stay a few weeks and just
[51:00] uh fellowship with everyone. And uh but
[51:04] time is short and so greetings to you
[51:06] all and God may God richly bless you.
[51:10] We're going to go to the word, but
[51:11] before I do that, I made a promise that
[51:14] I would remind everyone about Bethl
[51:16] Tabernacle Youth Camp that's coming up
[51:18] October 16th through 19th down on the
[51:22] border of North Carolina and South
[51:24] Carolina in the mountains. We need uh
[51:27] we'd love to have more campers come. We
[51:29] need some work crew and some some
[51:31] counselors. So, if the Lord would lay
[51:33] that on your heart, we'd absolutely love
[51:34] to have you. You can go to the uh Bethl
[51:37] Tabernacle website and get to that there
[51:40] if you just uh I guess people Google
[51:43] things better this day than they
[51:44] remember um URLs. So just search Bethl
[51:48] Tabernacle in Bufort, South Carolina and
[51:50] you'll find it and then you'll find
[51:52] information about the camp. So God bless
[51:55] you. Love to have you. and you know that
[51:57] your pastor is preaching at that camp.
[52:00] So come and support your pastor,
[52:03] both adults
[52:05] and young people. Adults come and help
[52:07] us and young people come and enjoy the
[52:10] fellowship and the word. So praise the
[52:12] Lord. I want to just go right to the
[52:14] scriptures. Brother Paul said you
[52:17] dismiss about 1:00. So but I could keep
[52:19] preaching as long as I wanted to just
[52:21] knowing that everybody be gone. So,
[52:24] we're going to try to be get to the
[52:27] point and and as brief as possible. I
[52:29] want to speak on the four loves
[52:33] and we're going to look at First John
[52:38] chapter 4 and verse 16.
[52:43] And we have known and believed the love
[52:46] that God hath to us.
[52:49] God is love. God is agape love. And he
[52:54] that dwelleth in agape love dwelleth in
[52:58] God and God in him. Let's pray. Heavenly
[53:03] Father, we thank you so much for your
[53:05] word, Lord. There's so much depth and
[53:08] there's so much riches, Lord, in the
[53:10] scriptures. We pray, Father, that you'd
[53:13] come just calm calm my nerves, Lord, and
[53:16] just uh anoint the speakers, the
[53:19] speaker, the anoint the the hearer,
[53:22] Lord. And may we come to this place
[53:25] where we're continually growing in you,
[53:27] Lord, in our walk with you. so many
[53:31] different situations and circumstances
[53:33] that people are living in and
[53:35] experiencing in their lives, but yet
[53:37] that same word has an impact on
[53:40] everyone, Lord. And so we pray that
[53:42] you'd come and take it and write it upon
[53:44] our hearts, Lord, that we would be more
[53:47] like Jesus Christ. We commit ourselves
[53:50] to you for this end, Father, in Jesus'
[53:52] name. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[53:55] seated.
[54:01] So
[54:02] John also tells us in his epistle that
[54:05] God is light. So God is love, God is
[54:09] light. And in in uh John chapter 4,
[54:12] Jesus tells us that God is spirit. And
[54:16] so it's not that God has love or is
[54:19] possessing love, but that God is love.
[54:23] It's not just that God possesses light,
[54:26] but that God himself is light. It's not
[54:29] that God uh has a spirit, but God is
[54:34] spirit. That's what he is.
[54:38] And so out of those three main things
[54:41] really flows all the attributes of God.
[54:43] So the na when I'm speaking of that, I'm
[54:45] speaking of the nature of God. I know
[54:46] that the predestinated seed were chosen
[54:49] in him before the foundation of the
[54:50] world. because that were attributes.
[54:52] We're part of his thoughts and when he
[54:55] wants to express himself, then we become
[54:58] those attributes manifested. But looking
[55:00] even more specifically of who is God?
[55:03] What is God like? How does he display
[55:06] himself? And so when we look at Exodus
[55:10] chapter 34,
[55:13] you know, we find this place where uh
[55:16] God Moses speaks to God and says, "I
[55:18] want to see your glory."
[55:21] So he makes this request and has a
[55:23] desire to see his glory. And we know
[55:26] that Moses was hid in the rock and then
[55:28] he saw the back parts of a man passed by
[55:31] before him. But I think it's so
[55:33] significant there that it's you know if
[55:35] if if it was if it was the the way to
[55:39] see God was merely physically with our
[55:41] eyes then God would have just appeared
[55:44] before him and said nothing. But the re
[55:46] this shows us that the reality is that
[55:49] uh seeing a theophony people sat in
[55:51] brother Brandham's meetings they saw the
[55:53] pillar of fire and maybe they even got
[55:56] healed but they never got saved. They
[55:58] didn't they didn't enter into eternal
[56:01] life. they stayed in the same sinful
[56:03] position that they were beforehand. So
[56:06] if seeing the pillar of fire was what
[56:08] saved us, uh we're we have a mistake.
[56:12] That's not really seeing God.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Really seeing God. And and this is
[56:18] exactly what God does. I want to see
[56:19] your glory. And the Lord passed by
[56:22] before him and proclaimed. So there has
[56:26] to be a proclamation.
[56:28] So for to really see the glory of God,
[56:31] there needs to be a revelation of the
[56:32] word.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Apart from a revelation of the word to
[56:36] you, there's no understanding of who God
[56:38] is. And everybody has a God. Even
[56:40] atheists have a God.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a God. And there's a
[56:44] nature that that God has. And that and
[56:47] that there's a there's a way that that
[56:49] God deals with them in their mind that
[56:52] they think that he deals with them. But
[56:54] here we have God coming and say, "I'm
[56:55] going to tell you who I am." Not just my
[56:58] name, but I'm going to show show you
[57:00] what my some of my attributes are so
[57:03] that you when I display myself, you'll
[57:06] understand and when you're going through
[57:07] your life where you're experiencing
[57:09] different things, you'll understand
[57:11] actually who I am and what I'm all about
[57:14] because it's more than just it's more
[57:16] than just words
[57:18] and it's more than just a ma a visible
[57:21] manifestation.
[57:23] Jesus was God made flesh. When you were
[57:26] looking at Jesus, you were seeing God
[57:27] and they crucified him. So again, just
[57:30] seeing God is not
[57:32] &gt;&gt; enough. It has to be a name declared to
[57:36] you by revelation. And then who is he?
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You know, in our modern day, our modern
[57:44] churches, God is God is love. And when
[57:48] they mean that, they mean God approves
[57:50] everything that you do.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; And everything that you do is okay with
[57:54] him. Because God, that's what love is.
[57:57] Is approval for anything except for the
[58:00] truth. No approval for the truth.
[58:03] Approval for any error, any sin, any
[58:06] evil. And see, they, you know, when when
[58:09] you look at God's mercy, we see they
[58:13] have a grain of the truth, but they're
[58:14] not they're missing the whole they're
[58:16] missing the two verses here in Exodus.
[58:19] The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
[58:21] gracious, long-suffering or or patient
[58:25] and abundant in goodness and truth. Yes.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Verse seven, keeping mercy for
[58:33] thousands, forgiving iniquity and
[58:35] transgression and sin.
[58:39] Wonderful. Let's just stop there.
[58:43] We don't want anymore.
[58:45] the rest it starts getting a little hot
[58:48] and we need to loosen our collars and
[58:52] all right let's keep reading because we
[58:54] don't want to be those Christians that
[58:55] pick and choose what we like and what we
[58:57] don't like and that will by no means
[59:00] clear the guilty visiting the iniquities
[59:03] of the fathers upon the children and
[59:06] upon the children's children unto the
[59:08] third and to the fourth generation. So
[59:11] God's merciful, God is gracious. He's
[59:13] patient. He's good. He all He He is the
[59:16] truth.
[59:18] So when he speaks, it's truth,
[59:21] right?
[59:23] We like that. We want more of that. But
[59:26] the other part is in order for God to be
[59:29] truthful, in order for God to be good,
[59:32] he also has to by no means clear the
[59:35] guilty. So what does it mean? On the one
[59:37] side, he says, "I'm merciful and I'm
[59:40] patient and I forgive iniquity." on the
[59:42] other says, "I won't clear the guilty."
[59:44] So, it means that there has to be a
[59:46] means
[59:48] &gt;&gt; to get cleared.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; So, if he's if he's merciful and
[59:52] gracious, there has to be that he makes
[59:55] a way for that to be possible. And so,
[1:00:00] he doesn't just look at the sin and just
[1:00:02] say, "It's fine. No problem." He makes a
[1:00:05] way. He makes a remedy. He makes a means
[1:00:07] for his grace and his mercy to be put on
[1:00:10] display in our lives. And so that
[1:00:13] there's also while there's a means to
[1:00:15] clear the guilty, there's also a a means
[1:00:17] to for you to be the person that stops
[1:00:20] the iniquity being visited upon your
[1:00:22] children and your grandchildren. And so
[1:00:25] the same God that clears the guilty is
[1:00:27] the same God that cancels the debt that
[1:00:30] would go on into other generations.
[1:00:35] And so when you can really see the
[1:00:36] balance in these things that God is a
[1:00:39] God of justice, he's a God of wrath. God
[1:00:42] because God is good. When man is sinful,
[1:00:45] he must punish the sin. He He must
[1:00:48] correct the mistakes. He must correct
[1:00:51] the errors. That is God. That is God's
[1:00:55] love put on display. And so God is love.
[1:00:59] And I want I don't want to get too far
[1:01:01] ahead of myself, but God is love. But
[1:01:04] not all love is God
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; or what we call love. And you know, we
[1:01:11] use the term in English language and we
[1:01:13] say love and we speak about our car
[1:01:16] and we speak about our steaks that we
[1:01:18] like to eat or if you're a vegetarian,
[1:01:20] I'm I'm sorry, but vegetables.
[1:01:23] Um
[1:01:26] there's all different kinds in the body
[1:01:28] of Christ.
[1:01:31] What? Whatever you these different
[1:01:33] things that we say that we love and we
[1:01:34] love. Do you love your car more than you
[1:01:37] love your wife? Do you love to go
[1:01:40] fishing more than you love your
[1:01:41] children? Uh do you do you love and
[1:01:44] that's a genuine question because many
[1:01:47] people do disorder themselves to such a
[1:01:49] place where they do love things and
[1:01:52] stuff and their truck more than and
[1:01:54] their dog more than their wife.
[1:01:58] And
[1:01:59] there's wives that love their sisters
[1:02:01] more than their husbands.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; And so these are disordered types of
[1:02:06] things that happen. And we're saying
[1:02:08] love, but what do we mean by love?
[1:02:10] Because if we don't understand what
[1:02:12] actually love means, we're just saying
[1:02:16] words. And just like you see the signs
[1:02:19] going down the street at churches,
[1:02:21] apostate churches that say love is love.
[1:02:24] And then their apostate members in their
[1:02:26] yard say love is love. And what they're
[1:02:30] trying to tell you is that homosexuals
[1:02:32] and all this other stuff is homosexual
[1:02:35] love is normal and good and a positive
[1:02:39] thing. How could it be wrong if they
[1:02:40] love each other? So you've actually
[1:02:43] taken what you're defining as love and
[1:02:46] made it into a God. And now that love
[1:02:49] has divine authority over everything
[1:02:51] else, over God himself, over God's word.
[1:02:56] And so, and they've also created to
[1:02:59] themselves another Jesus that they Jesus
[1:03:02] is so kind and merciful and loving.
[1:03:05] Really? Have you really ever read what
[1:03:08] Jesus is? Have you ever read the
[1:03:10] Gospels? He is merciful and kind and
[1:03:13] loving. Absolutely is. But he he is the
[1:03:16] toughest of all the prophets.
[1:03:20] You know, I I saw a list of all the
[1:03:22] names that he went through and called
[1:03:24] people and spoke about people and we
[1:03:26] think, "Oh, Jesus would never call
[1:03:28] anybody a name." People say that on
[1:03:31] everywhere. Jesus would never do this.
[1:03:33] What Jesus are you talking about?
[1:03:35] Because if it's not the Jesus in the
[1:03:37] word, it's not Jesus at all. Amen.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; And so this is so important to
[1:03:43] understand is that there is there is
[1:03:46] love is love. That's true. God is love.
[1:03:49] But what do you mean by that? Because
[1:03:51] there can be things that we call love
[1:03:53] that actually take us straight to hell
[1:03:55] and bring us to this place that we've
[1:03:58] literally lose our minds.
[1:04:04] Amen. I'm going to try to keep going. In
[1:04:06] adoption number four, brother Brandham
[1:04:08] says, "I said, 'Oh Lord, that's what I'm
[1:04:10] here at the church for, trying to set
[1:04:12] the church in order, telling you,
[1:04:13] brother and sister, there's only one
[1:04:15] thing that can enter that." He's
[1:04:16] speaking about his vision of the other
[1:04:18] side. There's only one thing that can
[1:04:21] enter that. That's perfect love.
[1:04:24] Not because you're loyal to Brandham Tab
[1:04:26] Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or
[1:04:27] Baptist Church. That's all right. You
[1:04:30] should be. But oh friends, you've got
[1:04:32] not because you spoke with tongues,
[1:04:33] danced in the spirit, because you've
[1:04:35] cast out devils, or moved mountains with
[1:04:37] faith. That's all right for that's all
[1:04:39] right. But still, unless that real
[1:04:41] perfect love is in there, that was where
[1:04:44] perfect love was. Amen. On the other
[1:04:47] side. And that's the only thing that'll
[1:04:50] let you in there. That's the only thing
[1:04:52] could stay there. It's the only thing
[1:04:54] there was there. Oh my. It's an
[1:04:56] adoption. God before the foundation of
[1:04:59] the world. Amen. So beautiful when we
[1:05:04] look at that he's calling us to this
[1:05:05] adoption walk. He's he's brought forth
[1:05:08] the opening of the seven seals, you
[1:05:11] know, and you you you think about what
[1:05:13] that was when the lamb took the book. No
[1:05:15] man was worthy to take the book. Not
[1:05:18] you, not me, not John, not Moses, not
[1:05:23] not Paul. No one was worthy to take the
[1:05:26] book. And so they they searched and they
[1:05:27] found and there was a lamb in the midst
[1:05:29] of the throne. That lamb took the book,
[1:05:32] broke the seven seals. And what's
[1:05:34] amazing is we think we we're just amazed
[1:05:37] at what that meant at for redemption,
[1:05:40] but we we forget the fact that the
[1:05:42] purpose of that was that the book would
[1:05:45] actually come down. The the mighty angel
[1:05:47] would come down with that book and then
[1:05:50] he wouldn't say, "I've come down with
[1:05:52] the book, Brother Paul. Come and come
[1:05:53] and look at the book.
[1:05:56] But don't don't touch it.
[1:05:58] Don't read it. No. The spoken the the
[1:06:01] word that came forth, the message that
[1:06:03] came forth was to reveal what was in
[1:06:05] that book. But it didn't stop there
[1:06:07] because the commandment was given to the
[1:06:11] believers. Take that book
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; and eat it,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; right? And it'll be sweet in your mouth
[1:06:17] and it'll make your belly bitter. It's
[1:06:19] going to bring change and transformation
[1:06:21] and rejoicing at the same time. But that
[1:06:24] book then needed to be eaten and then we
[1:06:28] could prophesy. Then we could speak. We
[1:06:30] are given a commission to take what's
[1:06:33] already been been spoken and then we can
[1:06:35] become that word manifested in our lives
[1:06:38] and in our words.
[1:06:40] And so a part a huge part of that is if
[1:06:44] you if you look at the whole purpose of
[1:06:45] that is Adam lost the book in the
[1:06:48] beginning. He lost dominion. He lost the
[1:06:50] spoken word. He lost the the per the
[1:06:52] nature of God that he had dwelling in
[1:06:54] him. All that was marred. He was to be a
[1:06:57] perfect expression of God and that was
[1:06:59] lost and that went back to the hands
[1:07:01] that book went back to the hands of the
[1:07:03] creator. So then it goes it it goes only
[1:07:06] the lamb only the kinsman redeemer can
[1:07:08] take the book but it was for us to eat
[1:07:11] so that dominion could be restored to
[1:07:13] man. Because at the end is what he says
[1:07:15] is you have made us kings and priests
[1:07:18] unto our God. You've purchased us to God
[1:07:21] by thy blood. And then he says, you've
[1:07:23] made us kings and priests. And so that
[1:07:25] book came down for us to eat so that
[1:07:27] dominion can be restored in our lives.
[1:07:30] And a huge part of that is having the
[1:07:33] right motive and objective, which is
[1:07:34] perfect love, agape love. And that's
[1:07:38] what I really want to look at is looking
[1:07:40] at uh defining, if I can move a little
[1:07:44] faster, uh agape love and looking at the
[1:07:47] different loves. and then also kind of
[1:07:49] looking at the uh the the the converse
[1:07:52] of that.
[1:07:54] So this is a incredible
[1:07:57] interchange between Jesus and Peter
[1:08:01] after the crucifixion after the
[1:08:03] resurrection.
[1:08:06] So get the context. This is Peter's out
[1:08:08] in the boat. They're out there fishing
[1:08:11] and they see Jesus. He uh puts his
[1:08:14] fisherman's coat back on and he leaps in
[1:08:17] the water and he swims to Jesus. But
[1:08:20] this is the this is the man who was bold
[1:08:23] and brash and whatever question Jesus
[1:08:26] had, man. He gave it his gusto. Uh he he
[1:08:31] Jesus said, "I'm going to be crucified
[1:08:32] and betrayed." And he says, "No, never.
[1:08:35] It will never happen."
[1:08:38] just the boldness to say, "I'm I will
[1:08:40] never let that happen. I'm I'll be the
[1:08:43] one to stop it. And if you do go, I'll
[1:08:45] be right there with you." And and he
[1:08:48] says, "You're going to betray me, but
[1:08:50] but I've already prayed for you." Satan
[1:08:52] wants to sift you like like wheat, but
[1:08:53] I've already prayed for you that your
[1:08:55] faith won't fail you. So there,
[1:08:59] you know, right next to Jesus, the third
[1:09:01] time he betrays him, he he
[1:09:04] no doubt their eyes met and the the the
[1:09:07] the the failure that Peter had. And that
[1:09:11] was so good and so perfect for for
[1:09:14] Peter. He needed that desperately. He
[1:09:16] needed that failure to teach Peter what
[1:09:19] Peter really was so that he could look
[1:09:22] in the mirror and say
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; true
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I need I need Jesus and I can't be
[1:09:27] speaking with such boldness that I'm
[1:09:29] this and I'm that.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And so here we have the Lord Jesus
[1:09:32] coming to his uh betrayer.
[1:09:37] It's so incredible. This is love. This
[1:09:40] is to me this is the ultimate expression
[1:09:42] of love
[1:09:44] because of course we we understand the
[1:09:46] cru him going to the cross is the
[1:09:48] ultimate expression but then it's going
[1:09:50] for a purpose. It's not just he died on
[1:09:53] the cross. It's going for a purpose.
[1:09:54] It's going for an end. And so when they
[1:09:57] had died, Jesus sayeth to Simon Peter,
[1:09:59] Simon son of Jonas agape. So there's
[1:10:03] some different Greek words that are used
[1:10:05] here which we'll talk define and talk
[1:10:06] about as we go forward. Simon son of
[1:10:09] Jonas lovest or agape thou me more than
[1:10:12] these? He saith unto him, "Yay, Lord,
[1:10:15] thou knowest that I file thee."
[1:10:19] So, so here's Peter's a little more
[1:10:22] humble now.
[1:10:25] Do you Peter, do you have the highest
[1:10:27] for do you have divine love for me?
[1:10:30] Peter basically says, "No, but I'm fond
[1:10:33] of you. You're my friend. I I love you a
[1:10:37] lot.
[1:10:38] But I don't have that kind of love.
[1:10:41] He saith unto him, "Feed my lamb." So
[1:10:45] this is the this is the man that denied
[1:10:47] him
[1:10:49] that ran away from him.
[1:10:52] And here he is. is I mean just imagine
[1:10:55] I'm just using a story but just imagine
[1:10:58] Paul is going through something really
[1:11:00] hard and you know people are accusing
[1:11:03] him and and Brandon turns and looks and
[1:11:05] says yeah that's exactly right he's been
[1:11:10] doing this and doing this and then he's
[1:11:11] just like Paul is in the other room and
[1:11:14] walks in and sees that he said it and it
[1:11:17] just breaks his heart I I can't believe
[1:11:19] I did that at the end you find out it's
[1:11:22] all it's all a lie. Paul comes and says,
[1:11:25] "You know, Brandon, I think I'm going to
[1:11:27] step down. I want you to be the pastor."
[1:11:31] This is like what Jesus is saying. I'm
[1:11:34] going to ascend to heaven and I want you
[1:11:36] to be the leader of the disciples right
[1:11:38] now.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That's love.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; That's love. That is seeing what could
[1:11:46] be in a person.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And with Jesus, it's seeing what will be
[1:11:51] in a person. what God speaks over them.
[1:11:54] Let's bring it down to our level. You're
[1:11:56] seeing what God speaks over a person and
[1:11:59] you're saying,
[1:12:01] "Feed my feed my lambs. Feed my sheep.
[1:12:04] There's there's more that you're going
[1:12:05] to become. There's more that you're
[1:12:08] going to grow into. Yeah, you failed.
[1:12:10] You failed miserably miserably." I think
[1:12:12] of the Apostle Paul writing to the
[1:12:14] Corinthians. You know, by the time he's
[1:12:17] done with them, we don't have any
[1:12:18] confidence in the Corinthians at all.
[1:12:21] We're just like, "These people, they're
[1:12:23] carnal. They're weak. I don't understand
[1:12:26] why they have this trouble. It's so
[1:12:27] obvious that they should have done this
[1:12:29] and should have done that."
[1:12:32] But then Paul writes in there multiple
[1:12:34] times that he has confidence in them.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Multiple times, I have confidence that
[1:12:38] you'll do the right thing.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I'll have confidence that you'll make
[1:12:42] the right choices. And to if you really
[1:12:45] look at that, I believe that this is
[1:12:46] what the Lord Jesus is showing as an
[1:12:48] example to us is that love calls people
[1:12:52] higher.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Even when they're in the midst of
[1:12:56] failure and mistakes, it calls them
[1:12:57] higher. He saith unto him again the
[1:13:00] second time. Remember, Peter denied him
[1:13:02] three times. So, we're going to get the
[1:13:04] question. Three times. He saith to him
[1:13:07] again the second time, Simon son of
[1:13:09] Jonas, agape thou me? saith unto him,
[1:13:12] "Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I feel
[1:13:14] thee, ow thee." He saith unto him, "Feed
[1:13:17] my sheep."
[1:13:20] Boy, this is so revealing when you when
[1:13:24] you see this. He's asking for a higher
[1:13:26] love. He's asking for a deeper love.
[1:13:28] He's asking for a a greater commitment
[1:13:31] and a greater devotion. And Peter's
[1:13:33] saying, "Yeah,
[1:13:36] I I'm at step two. I do like you. I am
[1:13:39] fond of you.
[1:13:41] I I haven't reached that level yet. And
[1:13:43] yet Jesus is saying, you're going to
[1:13:45] feed my sheep.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; He saith unto him the third time, Simon,
[1:13:49] son of Jonas, filio, thou me. Ouch.
[1:13:55] That's like you. Now he's going even
[1:13:57] down to Peter's level. Do you actually
[1:13:59] even are you are we friends?
[1:14:04] And Peter was grieved, which of course
[1:14:06] we all would be because we realize that
[1:14:08] this is discernment speaking to our
[1:14:10] hearts
[1:14:12] because he said unto him the third time,
[1:14:14] feel thou me. And he said unto him,
[1:14:17] Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou
[1:14:20] knowest that I feel thee. Jesus saith
[1:14:24] unto him, feed my sheep. There's a
[1:14:28] higher call, saints.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; You might be in a position where you
[1:14:32] have failed miserably. You've messed up
[1:14:35] bad. The Lord Jesus is telling you
[1:14:37] there's something higher.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He's calling you higher. I believe
[1:14:41] there's more. And I believe there's more
[1:14:43] that you can enter into. Don't limit
[1:14:46] what God can do in your life. And that's
[1:14:47] the kind of love that we should see one
[1:14:50] another with those eyes. It's more than
[1:14:53] just unconditional love. It's deeper and
[1:14:55] it's bigger than unconditional love.
[1:14:57] It's it's looking to something more or
[1:15:00] someone more. Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:15:03] thee, when thouast young, thou girdest
[1:15:05] thyself, and walkest wither thou
[1:15:06] wouldest. But when thou shalt be old,
[1:15:08] thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
[1:15:10] another shall guard thee, and carry thee
[1:15:13] whethersoever thou wouldest. So Peter,
[1:15:16] when you were young, you betrayed me.
[1:15:19] You walked away. You left. You did your
[1:15:22] own will. You did your own purpose. You
[1:15:24] did your own desire. You protected
[1:15:26] yourself.
[1:15:28] But when you're old, you know what?
[1:15:30] You're going to surrender yourself
[1:15:32] completely
[1:15:34] and you're going to give your life for
[1:15:36] me. That which you promised before and
[1:15:39] failed, there's going to be another
[1:15:40] chance and you won't and you won't fail.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You filelioed me before
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; cuz if you think about filelio getting
[1:15:48] ahead of myself, but felio love, it's
[1:15:51] what what's in a sense, it's what's in
[1:15:53] it for me. It's what pleasure does this
[1:15:56] friendship provide for me. But agape
[1:15:59] love is going beyond that and seeing
[1:16:01] what what how can I fill this person up?
[1:16:05] How can I stretch them up even further
[1:16:08] in Christ? And so here we have Jesus
[1:16:11] saying, "I know you don't feel you don't
[1:16:13] agape me at this moment. You're weak,
[1:16:15] but it's going to come to a place where
[1:16:17] you have grown
[1:16:19] uh spiritually and that you will have
[1:16:22] that agape for me. You'll have a total
[1:16:25] surrender and you'll ha you'll have a
[1:16:27] complete love. That's beautiful. All
[1:16:30] right. So Romans 12:9. Let's keep going.
[1:16:36] Let love be without dissimulation. So
[1:16:39] let love let agape be without
[1:16:42] dissimulation. Dissimulation
[1:16:44] means like a a a concealment of
[1:16:48] opinions, sentiments,
[1:16:51] and purpose. But it includes the
[1:16:53] assuming of a false and counterfeit
[1:16:55] appearance which conceals the real
[1:16:58] opinions or purpose. So it's not a fake
[1:17:02] love. It's something that has on the
[1:17:05] inside the right motive and objective.
[1:17:09] It's not in order to get something out
[1:17:11] of it. It's just to love as he loves.
[1:17:15] And then right along with that we see uh
[1:17:18] one verse is talking about love. The
[1:17:20] next worth is talking about hate. So if
[1:17:23] in order for us to love right, we have
[1:17:25] to hate.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Abhore that which is evil, it means an
[1:17:34] extreme hatred for that which is evil.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; How does that work? Because I supposed
[1:17:42] to love my enemies.
[1:17:45] We'll talk about what went as we go
[1:17:47] further. But we have to hate that which
[1:17:50] is evil. It doesn't say hate who that
[1:17:52] who is evil.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Hate that which is evil. Cleave to that
[1:17:56] which is good. Because ultimately we
[1:17:59] have to see it as even those people that
[1:18:02] are evil or or p in in the current
[1:18:05] condition that they're in. They're
[1:18:06] walking in evil. That we we can overcome
[1:18:10] that and be able to help them out of
[1:18:14] that place and position because that's
[1:18:16] what love is.
[1:18:18] Cleave to that which is good. So there
[1:18:21] we have agape in that verse. Next verse
[1:18:23] puts the other two loves mentioned
[1:18:26] together in the New Testament. Be kindly
[1:18:29] affectioned.
[1:18:31] This is the word uh filo stoos. So it's
[1:18:34] putting together filelio and sto speaks
[1:18:37] of family love or affection. One to
[1:18:40] another with brotherly love.
[1:18:42] Philadelphia
[1:18:44] in honor preferring one another. So
[1:18:47] there's three types of love spoken about
[1:18:52] in the New Testament. Agape love which
[1:18:54] we'll just leave as divine love, filelio
[1:18:57] love, friendship, sto which is affection
[1:19:00] or family love. And then the other one
[1:19:02] it's outside of the New Testament is
[1:19:04] aeros or romantic love or what we modern
[1:19:08] people call falling in love.
[1:19:14] human. You know, the the last three
[1:19:16] loves, filelio, sto aeros, they're all
[1:19:19] human loves.
[1:19:22] And so all of these are they're good in
[1:19:25] their right place and right position.
[1:19:28] You know, they can also become evil
[1:19:31] when they're disordered and they're
[1:19:33] misplaced.
[1:19:36] And and when you when you're looking at
[1:19:39] it in one way though by themselves it's
[1:19:43] not exactly that but they're all they're
[1:19:45] all inward focused. They're not outward
[1:19:48] focused.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And so they can never our human loves
[1:19:52] can never actually
[1:19:55] be expressed correctly and properly
[1:19:57] without an infusion of agape love
[1:20:01] because they'll always be disordered.
[1:20:02] They'll always rise to a certain level.
[1:20:05] Well, they there'll become a god in our
[1:20:08] life. You know, when it reaches its
[1:20:10] height, it becomes a god. If you look at
[1:20:12] especially at aeros love, people falling
[1:20:16] in love. The story of Romeo and Juliet,
[1:20:19] we're going to ignore all the advice of
[1:20:22] parents, family, everyone. And if we
[1:20:24] then if we can't have that what we want,
[1:20:27] we're just kill ourselves because that
[1:20:29] has become a god that has become
[1:20:31] deified. And that's extreme example, but
[1:20:33] it happens in this life. It happens in
[1:20:37] in real situations. A man going to work
[1:20:39] and he has a secretary and they have a
[1:20:41] close relationship and suddenly an
[1:20:44] emotion comes over him and an emotion
[1:20:46] comes over her and they they fall in
[1:20:49] love and instead of saying I have a wife
[1:20:52] at home, I have a family to take care
[1:20:53] of. This will ruin and destroy my life.
[1:20:56] This uh s sensation of aeros takes over.
[1:21:01] And instead they destroy everything
[1:21:05] and then at the end 90% of the time that
[1:21:08] thing which they destroyed it for turns
[1:21:09] into revulsion and hatred.
[1:21:17] And there's there's there's so many
[1:21:19] things that we can look at with aeros
[1:21:21] love. Falling in love is an experience
[1:21:23] that's common to all mankind.
[1:21:26] It happens to everyone. Otherwise we
[1:21:29] would have no children, no
[1:21:32] grandchildren. And so this this happens.
[1:21:34] But when we kind of put it into a
[1:21:37] cultural uh phenomena that is in every
[1:21:41] movie and we have to embrace this as the
[1:21:43] ultimate uh form of love. That's why we
[1:21:47] see people putting in their signs
[1:21:49] rainbow flags and love is love and
[1:21:52] condemning everyone that would say no
[1:21:53] love has to be ordered properly. If if I
[1:21:57] fall in love uh with someone else, this
[1:22:02] is perverted.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; God forbid that ever happens, but if
[1:22:07] that ever happens to a it does happen.
[1:22:10] And you know what? There's brothers that
[1:22:12] it's happened to. And you know what they
[1:22:13] did? They overcame. They got on their
[1:22:15] knees. They prayed. They removed
[1:22:17] themselves from the situation. They ran
[1:22:19] away from it. Same thing with young
[1:22:21] people. That's good. That's fantastic.
[1:22:24] But you have parents in your life. You
[1:22:27] have a pastor. You have uh deacons. You
[1:22:30] have people that you can trust and you
[1:22:32] involve them in what's going on inside
[1:22:35] of you. That's hopefully your parents
[1:22:37] have built such a relationship with you
[1:22:39] that you can go to them as soon as the
[1:22:41] feelings start rising and say, "I'm
[1:22:43] having this feeling. Okay, let's talk
[1:22:45] about this. Are you old enough? Are you
[1:22:47] is is he or she in a position and ready?
[1:22:51] Is this does this make sense? Because
[1:22:53] that's good. I'm glad you're falling in
[1:22:55] love. Real godly parents are excited
[1:22:57] when their kids are going to get married
[1:23:00] and all these things are happening. We
[1:23:02] we want that. We love that. We we're
[1:23:04] we're looking forward to that day. And
[1:23:06] yet we know that it also has to come
[1:23:08] into the order of God line and order of
[1:23:10] God's word. And if we take it outside of
[1:23:12] the order of God's word, then we have a
[1:23:14] lot of pain and heartache. And aeros
[1:23:17] love is a magical and dangerous drug.
[1:23:22] And if it's not handled appropriately
[1:23:25] and really as parents we should be
[1:23:27] teaching them about it so that when they
[1:23:30] go through puberty and start things
[1:23:32] start happening they don't wonder what
[1:23:35] these magical powers are taking place
[1:23:37] inside their body with the rush of
[1:23:40] hormones and everything. And so again, a
[1:23:44] good thing that God gives as a gift can
[1:23:46] turn into something horrible, deformed,
[1:23:50] evil, and destructive. The same thing
[1:23:53] for family affection. You know, you can
[1:23:56] you can go ahead and raise your children
[1:23:58] in such a way that they're totally
[1:24:00] dependent on you, that they don't know
[1:24:01] how to do anything in life, that you've
[1:24:04] all you do is force them to do
[1:24:06] everything. You're not teaching them.
[1:24:07] You're not instructing them. You're
[1:24:08] you're not teaching them about the
[1:24:10] message. You're forcing them to follow
[1:24:12] the message. You're not taking time to
[1:24:14] instruct them about holiness and modesty
[1:24:17] and about the doctrines and teachings of
[1:24:19] the message. You just take them to
[1:24:21] church and just assume the church is
[1:24:22] going to do the job.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And so we we do that and and we're
[1:24:27] holding them and we want to hold on to
[1:24:29] them and we want to protect that purity
[1:24:30] that they have. But it isn't it isn't so
[1:24:33] much that we it's us protecting and
[1:24:35] holding them. It's us launching them as
[1:24:38] arrows against the enemy. And so, you
[1:24:41] have to prepare, make the preparations,
[1:24:43] and teach them so that they can walk on
[1:24:44] their own two feet because what you're
[1:24:46] doing is you're you're you're aiming
[1:24:48] towards creating a new godly family that
[1:24:51] would do the same thing that you did to
[1:24:54] teach them and train them. But a a
[1:24:56] family that puts it all off. All
[1:24:58] training on school, all training on
[1:25:00] church, all training on everything else
[1:25:04] and Disney and everything, allowing all
[1:25:07] those different things in an out of
[1:25:09] balance way in their life. They're not
[1:25:13] loving. They might be a family, but it's
[1:25:17] not true love because it's missing the
[1:25:20] agape element.
[1:25:22] And not only that, but it can turn into
[1:25:24] something where it's very controlling
[1:25:25] and stifling and and damaging to their
[1:25:28] little psyches as they grow up to where
[1:25:30] they they've got to be delivered from so
[1:25:32] many different uh problems that they
[1:25:34] have in their minds and in their hearts
[1:25:36] because parents haven't done what
[1:25:38] they're supposed to do. And so it's it's
[1:25:42] a form of love. You can look at uh
[1:25:45] different situations. you know, a mother
[1:25:47] that would smother her son to the point
[1:25:50] where he doesn't even know how to
[1:25:51] function in life apart from his mother.
[1:25:53] And she certainly doesn't want him to
[1:25:55] function in life apart from her because
[1:25:58] somehow that fulfills a need in her
[1:26:00] heart that's missing in her in her
[1:26:02] marriage.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And so it isn't love that would stifle
[1:26:08] and damage and hinder the growth of our
[1:26:10] children.
[1:26:11] And felio same thing is the jealousies
[1:26:14] can arise between between friends true
[1:26:18] friendship uh increases with the number
[1:26:21] true filelio grows with the number it
[1:26:23] doesn't say ah I just this person has to
[1:26:25] be for me no one else can be friends
[1:26:27] with this person and you try to play
[1:26:29] politics and keep other people away from
[1:26:31] that person because that's your friend
[1:26:34] not their friend
[1:26:36] it's a sure it's some kind of friendship
[1:26:38] but it's not real felio love.
[1:26:43] And we can go on as you could see
[1:26:46] there's there's many kinds of love that
[1:26:48] aren't love at all.
[1:26:53] The other part of it is that when when
[1:26:54] love,
[1:26:56] you know, all of these things, people
[1:26:57] will love with all all their might their
[1:27:01] children all the while that they're
[1:27:03] damaging and hurting them or their
[1:27:05] spouse and they confess. Oh, we love
[1:27:08] each other. I have to. He beats me, but
[1:27:10] I have to stay with him because I love
[1:27:13] him and he loves me.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; And it's not love.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; But that feeling of attachment and
[1:27:20] dependency that's there between two
[1:27:23] people can be actually evil.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And so and and damaging there. And so
[1:27:29] when that when that uh love becomes a
[1:27:33] god to a person, that's when it turns
[1:27:36] into a demon.
[1:27:38] that literally turns into a demonic
[1:27:41] power
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; because it's so controlling and damaging
[1:27:46] to that person. And so I'm going to try
[1:27:49] to keep going. So let's let's look at
[1:27:52] agape. We're all familiar with things
[1:27:55] that Brother Brandham says. It's divine
[1:27:57] love. We're all familiar if you look up
[1:28:00] in a dictionary or a Google search and
[1:28:03] it'll tell you it's unconditional love.
[1:28:05] Those things are true, but it actually
[1:28:07] goes way further than that. And I I want
[1:28:10] to I want to look at this at some things
[1:28:13] that Brother Brandham said about it. He
[1:28:16] says,
[1:28:18] "Men and women, hear me today as your
[1:28:20] brother. Let all your little isms and
[1:28:23] your little sensations drop. Find the
[1:28:25] love of God. I'd rather have his love
[1:28:28] than every gift he's got in his kingdom.
[1:28:31] Give me his love."
[1:28:33] That's what the world is looking for
[1:28:35] today is to see a display of real love.
[1:28:39] It'll s win souls when you got love.
[1:28:41] They can tell it when you got love. We
[1:28:44] got too much makebelief love. We got too
[1:28:46] much love. Felio love trying to make it
[1:28:49] agapeo love. We need need real godly
[1:28:53] love.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] From from that time on, brother Brandham
[1:28:58] says, "But let me tell you a little
[1:28:59] secret. The most powerful force in the
[1:29:01] world isn't speaking with tongues or
[1:29:03] interpreting tongues or being honored by
[1:29:05] God to be a minister or to be an
[1:29:07] evangelist or to be a prophet. The most
[1:29:09] powerful weapon that I've ever found in
[1:29:11] life is love.
[1:29:13] The filio love, which is the Greek word
[1:29:15] that comes from friendship like you have
[1:29:16] for your wife. There's a difference.
[1:29:18] It'll make a mother for that baby run
[1:29:21] through a blazing fire. Her life means
[1:29:23] nothing. That's felio. What will agape
[1:29:26] do? See the godly love. We must love
[1:29:30] divinely love one another. Then you
[1:29:33] don't see your brother's mistake. Think
[1:29:35] of Jesus and Peter.
[1:29:37] If he does make a mistake, you never
[1:29:39] look you. You look over the top of it
[1:29:42] and you love him anyhow. See, that's it.
[1:29:44] Love those that love you. Then does does
[1:29:47] not the sinner the same thing? But love
[1:29:48] those who doesn't love you. That's what
[1:29:51] shows the spirit of God is in you
[1:29:53] because he loved you when you were his
[1:29:54] enemy and he loved you. And if that
[1:29:56] spirit's in you, it'll make you love
[1:29:58] your enemy as you do your friend.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] In the smearan church age, bear with me
[1:30:10] as you as we look at this.
[1:30:13] You see, they could not figure out God's
[1:30:15] love. They thought that love meant no
[1:30:17] suffering. They thought that love meant
[1:30:20] a baby with parental care. But God said
[1:30:23] that his love was elective love. The
[1:30:26] proof of his love is election. That no
[1:30:30] matter what happened, his love was
[1:30:31] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:30:33] chosen unto salvation.
[1:30:35] Because God hath chosen you to salvation
[1:30:38] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:30:39] belief of the truth. He may commit you
[1:30:42] to death as he did Paul. He may commit
[1:30:43] you to suffering as he did Job. That is
[1:30:45] his prerogative. He is sovereign, but
[1:30:47] it's all with a purpose. If he did not
[1:30:50] have a purpose, then he would be the
[1:30:51] author of frustration and not of peace.
[1:30:54] Listen. So his purpose, so love has a
[1:30:58] purpose.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Elective love, agape love has a purpose.
[1:31:04] What is that purpose? It's that after we
[1:31:06] suffered a while, we would be made
[1:31:08] perfect, be established, strengthened,
[1:31:10] and settled. As Job said, he put
[1:31:12] strength in us. You see, he himself
[1:31:14] suffered. He learned obedience by the
[1:31:17] things that he suffered. He was actually
[1:31:19] made perfect by the things that he
[1:31:21] suffered. Hebrews 5:8-9. Though he were
[1:31:24] a son, yet learned he obedience by the
[1:31:26] things which he suffered, and being made
[1:31:27] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[1:31:29] salvation unto all them that obey him.
[1:31:32] In plain language, the very character of
[1:31:35] Jesus was perfected by suffering. And
[1:31:38] according to Paul, he has left his
[1:31:40] church a measure of suffering that they
[1:31:41] too by their faith in God while
[1:31:44] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:31:46] of perfection.
[1:31:49] So as we look at this, this is so
[1:31:52] incredible.
[1:31:54] God's love is sent for a purpose. So
[1:31:56] agape love is sent to accomplish a
[1:32:00] purpose for us. And so when God's love
[1:32:04] was put forth, it's it's a supernatural
[1:32:07] power, right? God's love is the most
[1:32:10] powerful force. So it's a supernatural
[1:32:13] power. And when he put his love forward,
[1:32:16] what did it do? It would it's to bring
[1:32:19] us to perfection.
[1:32:22] It's it it's to bring us to a place that
[1:32:24] we're growing
[1:32:26] into the image of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; So I'm just going to for sake of uh
[1:32:35] brevity here
[1:32:37] love is a power. We saw that.
[1:32:41] The other part is love extends itself to
[1:32:44] others. Right?
[1:32:46] Love isn't just to be bottled up in
[1:32:48] here. It's extending itself out towards
[1:32:51] other people. And the ultimate purpose
[1:32:54] that love has is your spiritual growth.
[1:32:57] He wants you to grow. Why do you go
[1:32:59] through the things that you do? He wants
[1:33:01] you to He wants you to grow up into
[1:33:03] Christ in all things.
[1:33:06] That's his purpose. So love's purpose is
[1:33:11] spiritual growth.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; So put it all together. Love is a power
[1:33:15] that extends itself for the purpose of
[1:33:19] spiritual growth.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; True and genuine. There's a lot of
[1:33:23] different loves. We saw that there's
[1:33:25] four different loves. But true agape
[1:33:27] love is rising above above all of those
[1:33:30] things. And you want to see other people
[1:33:33] grow in Christ.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; You want to see them grow. and that
[1:33:37] there's a supernatural power inside of
[1:33:40] you going forth from you to help other
[1:33:44] people grow in Christ.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; So let's look then before we go further
[1:33:50] in that, let's let's look at what evil
[1:33:52] is. So the there's always the law of
[1:33:55] contrast and when you see the law of
[1:33:57] contrast, you'll see the actual law
[1:33:59] itself or the reality of love so much
[1:34:02] more clearly.
[1:34:05] So foundationally evil is anything that
[1:34:08] goes against the purpose of God.
[1:34:12] So anything that goes against God's
[1:34:14] purpose is evil.
[1:34:22] Genesis 3:9. So very first
[1:34:26] very first two people placed upon earth
[1:34:30] when they sinned they engaged in evil.
[1:34:34] And so what did they do? And the Lord
[1:34:36] God called unto Adam and said unto him,
[1:34:38] "Where art thou?" And he said, 'I heard
[1:34:39] thy voice in the garden, and I was
[1:34:41] afraid because I was naked, and I hid
[1:34:43] myself. And he said, Who told thee thou
[1:34:45] was that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten
[1:34:47] of the tree whereof I commanded thee
[1:34:49] that thou shouldest not eat? And the man
[1:34:52] said, the woman you gave to be with me?
[1:34:56] She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
[1:35:00] So what did what did Adam do there?
[1:35:03] Actually blamed God for giving him a
[1:35:06] woman that caused him to eat of the
[1:35:10] fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
[1:35:12] good and evil. So we understand the Adam
[1:35:15] was not deceived.
[1:35:17] Uh Eve was deceived and was in the
[1:35:19] transgression. And yet we also
[1:35:21] understand that Adam identifies himself
[1:35:23] with that sin. And when Adam identified
[1:35:26] himself with that sin,
[1:35:29] a a separation of fellowship happened
[1:35:31] immediately. You could see that that
[1:35:33] happened because what did they do? They
[1:35:34] hid in the trees of the garden and they
[1:35:36] immediately felt guilt that they were
[1:35:39] naked and tried to tried to form fig
[1:35:41] leaves to cover themselves up. And then
[1:35:43] when God confronts them, he passes the
[1:35:45] buck. He doesn't take responsibility.
[1:35:47] Who was responsible? The one that God
[1:35:49] was talking to. He he went to the man
[1:35:52] that was responsible. He didn't say,
[1:35:54] 'Look, I made a mistake. My wife, my
[1:35:57] wife ate of the tree of the knowledge of
[1:36:00] good and evil, and I take the
[1:36:02] responsibility because I'm the head of
[1:36:04] this home. That's what should have been
[1:36:06] said. Instead, it was deflecting it to
[1:36:10] someone else. Someone else is the
[1:36:12] problem. In fact, God, you you're
[1:36:14] defective yourself because you made this
[1:36:17] woman for me. So, you messed up in your
[1:36:20] in your creation.
[1:36:25] And the Lord God said unto the woman,
[1:36:26] "What is this that thouast done?" The
[1:36:28] woman said, "The serpent deceived me and
[1:36:31] I did eat." So even she is putting blame
[1:36:34] onto the serpent at at the same time she
[1:36:36] is taking responsibility because she
[1:36:38] says, "I I did I did it, but the serpent
[1:36:41] made me do it."
[1:36:46] All right. So then we fast forward to
[1:36:47] the next story of evil. Cain and Abel.
[1:36:51] And Abel, he also brought of the firstl
[1:36:53] things of his flock, and of the fat
[1:36:54] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[1:36:56] Abel and to his offering, but unto Cain
[1:36:59] and to his offering, he had not respect,
[1:37:00] and Cain was very wroth, and his
[1:37:03] countenance fell. And the Lord said unto
[1:37:05] Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why is thy
[1:37:07] countenance fallen? If thou doest well,
[1:37:10] shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou
[1:37:12] doest not well, sin lith at the door,
[1:37:14] and unto thee shall be his desire, and
[1:37:16] thou shalt rule over him. And Cain
[1:37:20] talked with Abel his brother. And it
[1:37:22] came to pass when they were in the field
[1:37:24] that Cain rose up against Abel his
[1:37:26] brother and slew him. So this is like
[1:37:30] the ultimate form of blaming someone
[1:37:32] else for your problems as you go. You
[1:37:35] did that person did better and I will go
[1:37:37] murder them. Maybe we don't do that but
[1:37:40] we speak evil across the board against
[1:37:42] people and we we ruin their mar their
[1:37:45] image and and character before the eyes
[1:37:47] of the people.
[1:37:50] But it's what is it? This was Cain
[1:37:52] putting the blame for his problems. If I
[1:37:54] go kill Abel, then God won't have a
[1:37:56] problem with me anymore.
[1:37:59] This is how many people think. This is
[1:38:01] how many people act and believe. They
[1:38:03] think someone else is the problem, not
[1:38:07] me. If I get rid of that other person or
[1:38:09] if I put the blame on that other person,
[1:38:12] then everything will be fine for me
[1:38:14] because it's not me. I'm not the
[1:38:16] problem. I don't have to change. I don't
[1:38:19] have to adjust myself. They do. If they
[1:38:22] if they're adjusted, and here he did the
[1:38:25] ultimate adjustment, murder. I'll kill
[1:38:29] him and bury him in the ground. And the
[1:38:31] Lord said unto Cain, "Where is Abel thy
[1:38:34] brother?" And he said, "I know not. Am I
[1:38:37] my brother's keeper?" And he said, "What
[1:38:39] hast thou done? The voice of thy
[1:38:41] brother's blood crith unto me from the
[1:38:43] ground.
[1:38:45] And now thou art cursed from the earth,
[1:38:47] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[1:38:49] thy brother's blood from thy hand. When
[1:38:51] thou tillest the ground, it shall not
[1:38:53] henceforth yield unto thee her strength.
[1:38:55] A fugitive and a vagab vagabond shalt
[1:38:58] thou be in the earth. And Cade said unto
[1:39:00] the Lord, my punishment is greater than
[1:39:03] I can bear.
[1:39:05] He he wasn't give given any choice with
[1:39:07] his punishment. God went directly. You
[1:39:11] lied to me. He told him what happened
[1:39:13] and this is what your results are in
[1:39:15] your life. And he says this is greater
[1:39:17] than I could bear. You can put that on
[1:39:19] so many different ways to pe to to how
[1:39:22] people live today that are evil.
[1:39:26] It is all it's it's never a result their
[1:39:29] life the fruit of their life is never a
[1:39:33] result of their own choices. It wasn't
[1:39:36] the fact that they created chaos in
[1:39:38] their life. It was my brother's problem.
[1:39:43] That that religious guy. He's so
[1:39:46] religious and he's always frustrating me
[1:39:48] and it's all his fault that this
[1:39:51] happened. And if I if if if he weren't
[1:39:53] so fanatical, everything would be fine
[1:39:56] for me.
[1:39:58] And this is this is a greater
[1:39:59] punishment. He's the one that had to
[1:40:01] have the punishment cuz cuz I'm I
[1:40:04] haven't done anything wrong. And see
[1:40:06] people people that are evil can never
[1:40:09] really see and understand that the chaos
[1:40:11] in their life is a result of their own
[1:40:13] actions and activities. It's always
[1:40:16] somebody else's fault. It's always
[1:40:18] somebody else's mistake. So evil seeks
[1:40:22] to preserve itself, right?
[1:40:24] Self-preservation.
[1:40:28] Evil always has a scapegoat. Always has
[1:40:32] somebody to blame. Or even they'll blame
[1:40:35] divine providence itself or fate or
[1:40:38] whatever these people want to call it.
[1:40:40] They'll blame God just as Cain blame go
[1:40:43] blamed God ultimately
[1:40:46] and also has for its the purpose the
[1:40:49] hindrance of spiritual growth. And so if
[1:40:53] you're thinking of thinking of what love
[1:40:55] is doing, love is trying to get people
[1:40:58] to grow. And God will do that. God is so
[1:41:01] merciful that he'll the people that
[1:41:04] they're making dumb choices and dumb
[1:41:06] decisions and they'll hit their head
[1:41:09] against the wall and find all kinds of
[1:41:11] problems and then they're full of
[1:41:12] anxiety and depression because of the
[1:41:14] dumb choices that they made in their own
[1:41:16] life.
[1:41:18] And God, that's God's mercy actually
[1:41:20] trying to show them, hey, you have a
[1:41:22] problem and it's you.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And he says, never. I have to preserve
[1:41:31] my own sick self because this this
[1:41:36] sickness I have is not really a
[1:41:37] sickness. It's somebody else's problem.
[1:41:40] you know, parents that raise kids and
[1:41:42] the kids go they go wild and do foolish
[1:41:45] things and you it's it's just a it's a
[1:41:47] tragedy. There's people that they've
[1:41:50] never been raised themselves and then
[1:41:52] they have kids bring kids into the world
[1:41:54] and they don't even pay minimal
[1:41:57] attention to them. They're just on their
[1:41:59] own 90% of the time. And then their kids
[1:42:02] cause problems and then they yell and
[1:42:04] curse at the kids for causing them
[1:42:07] problems.
[1:42:09] And they're the evil ones that produce
[1:42:10] the kids that are living in that that
[1:42:14] way.
[1:42:15] And so this is such a it's such a
[1:42:18] revelation when you can understand that
[1:42:21] evil is actually Oh, I'm going to go
[1:42:25] backwards. Evil is actually
[1:42:28] anything that would hinder or stop
[1:42:30] spiritual growth in order to protect its
[1:42:34] own spiritual sickness.
[1:42:36] And it always has a scapegoat. It always
[1:42:38] has some somebody to blame. And so the
[1:42:41] truth is we've all done evil.
[1:42:44] I've done evil. I've done things that
[1:42:47] have hindered the the spiritual growth
[1:42:48] of my own family. And so I've I've
[1:42:51] repented. And I'm pretty sure there's
[1:42:53] more things I'll have to repent of.
[1:42:55] But the re once we begin to see and this
[1:42:58] has helped me so much to see that that
[1:43:01] what love really is and what God is
[1:43:04] aiming for. It's really uh uh given such
[1:43:08] a different vision towards life for me
[1:43:11] to understand what God is trying to do.
[1:43:13] He's trying to get people to grow and
[1:43:15] they will refuse to grow. And even
[1:43:17] people who are unbelievers
[1:43:20] that are that are walking in terrible
[1:43:22] sin, God's grace is extending to them to
[1:43:25] try to help them to repent, make things
[1:43:27] right, and to grow. And yet people
[1:43:30] refuse refuse. And even Christians will
[1:43:32] do the same thing. Sit sit in church and
[1:43:35] they have something in their life that
[1:43:37] they're refusing to deal with, refusing
[1:43:39] to own, and they've locked it up in a
[1:43:42] box in the nether regions of their
[1:43:44] heart. And they said, "I won't. I refuse
[1:43:47] to talk about that. I refuse to deal
[1:43:49] with that. And what do they do? They sit
[1:43:51] right in the same spiritual condition
[1:43:52] that they do for all those years. And
[1:43:55] the the hard part is is they're not only
[1:43:57] hindering themselves, they're hindering
[1:43:58] their own family, their own spouse,
[1:44:01] their own children. And so, thank God
[1:44:04] that there's grace for those children
[1:44:07] because grace, grace is more than just
[1:44:10] God saying, "I pass over sin." Grace
[1:44:12] itself is a power
[1:44:16] to put forth
[1:44:18] God's presence into your life to bring
[1:44:20] forth a change.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; And the other part of it is evil people
[1:44:28] actually they're not usually aware that
[1:44:30] they're evil.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; They think they're normal. They're
[1:44:34] average. In fact, usually they think
[1:44:36] they do everything very very well.
[1:44:39] They do they're the very best and the
[1:44:43] only the only reason why they have
[1:44:45] various problems in their life is other
[1:44:46] people around them and everything they
[1:44:49] do is for the greater good and for the
[1:44:51] benefit of all mankind
[1:44:54] and they never evaluate and look at the
[1:44:56] fruit of their lives. you know, really
[1:44:59] loving, really having love towards other
[1:45:02] people. It takes a lot of time on your
[1:45:05] knees and evaluating yourself and
[1:45:08] evaluating your own motive and objective
[1:45:12] and looking at the interactions that you
[1:45:14] have and understanding what what was my
[1:45:16] thought behind that? What was my heart
[1:45:18] behind that? What what is my purpose
[1:45:20] behind what what I'm doing, where I'm
[1:45:22] working, why I do what I do on a daily
[1:45:25] basis. It takes an effort and it takes a
[1:45:28] a surrender. And evil people are lazy.
[1:45:34] They just want to stay. They just want
[1:45:36] it to go good for them without putting
[1:45:38] the effort.
[1:45:44] And again, what is good? I'll just leave
[1:45:47] that there. We'll talk about that in a
[1:45:49] minute.
[1:45:55] On a on a human level, if we can
[1:45:58] understand it, agape love is ultimately
[1:46:01] dependency on God. But on a human level,
[1:46:04] agape love isn't creating a dependency.
[1:46:07] Not a dependency on your pastor, not a
[1:46:09] dependency on your your your spouse. Of
[1:46:12] course, there's there's relationship and
[1:46:14] interconnectedness, but if they can't
[1:46:16] function without you, if your children
[1:46:18] can't function without you, if the
[1:46:20] congregation can never function and grow
[1:46:22] spiritually without a specific pastor
[1:46:25] there in place, then there's something
[1:46:27] that's out of order and out of cater.
[1:46:29] There's a dependency that's bringing
[1:46:32] damage in your life. And so, we need to
[1:46:35] ultimately only be dependent on God. And
[1:46:39] you know, we can we can lead and direct
[1:46:42] churches and families in such a way that
[1:46:44] we create people that are dependent
[1:46:47] because we need the the self validation
[1:46:50] for them because we're doing it all for
[1:46:52] them. And God doesn't want your pastor
[1:46:55] to do it all for you. God wants it's a
[1:46:57] body and each of us has a calling and
[1:47:00] each of us us has a purpose. So that
[1:47:02] kind of goes into uh boundaries as well.
[1:47:05] You have a burden to bear. God's given
[1:47:07] you that burden to bear. He didn't give
[1:47:09] it to your pastor to bear. He didn't
[1:47:11] give it to another person to bear. He's
[1:47:12] given it to you. Now, when there's a big
[1:47:14] boulder that comes into your life, we
[1:47:15] all come together and we all help that.
[1:47:18] But that which the Lord has given to you
[1:47:20] as an individual, he intends for you to
[1:47:22] carry that. He doesn't want you to say,
[1:47:24] "Pastor, come carry this for me."
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He wants you to get it get there and
[1:47:29] carry the burden that God has given to
[1:47:31] you because that's yours, not another
[1:47:32] person's.
[1:47:37] Romans 8:28 and 29.
[1:47:41] And we know that all things work
[1:47:43] together for good to them that love God,
[1:47:46] to them who are the called according to
[1:47:48] his purpose, for whom he did forno, he
[1:47:51] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:47:53] the image of his son, that he might be
[1:47:56] the firstborn among many brethren. So
[1:47:58] what is good?
[1:48:00] What is good? We just read that before.
[1:48:03] It doesn't mean that it's a God is a
[1:48:06] parent with care for a baby. That's not
[1:48:09] what he's talking about because that
[1:48:11] God's end is not for us to be babies.
[1:48:14] It's for us to grow into our adoption.
[1:48:18] Right? And so here we have this is the
[1:48:21] ultimate good that God is aiming for.
[1:48:23] What good is God aiming for? Because in
[1:48:26] verse 35 he says there's that that who
[1:48:30] shall separate us from the love of
[1:48:31] Christ? shall tribulation or distress or
[1:48:33] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:48:35] peril or sword. So the absence of those
[1:48:38] things is not what we're talking about
[1:48:41] as good. There's something higher. It's
[1:48:43] God's eternal good. And what is that
[1:48:45] good that he's working out for us? Well,
[1:48:48] the next verse tells us it's not a it's
[1:48:50] this is not separate sentences that
[1:48:53] somebody gathered together uh hundreds
[1:48:55] of years later. This is a letter that
[1:48:57] Paul wrote and there's a direction. He
[1:48:59] says, "We know that all things work
[1:49:00] together for good to them that love God,
[1:49:03] etc." And 29 for. So this is a
[1:49:06] connection between verses. This is
[1:49:08] because whom he did forno, he also did
[1:49:11] predestinate. Praise the Lord, he
[1:49:13] predestinated us. It's wonderful. We're
[1:49:15] going to be saved at the end. That's not
[1:49:18] predestination.
[1:49:20] Oh, well, it is predestination, but it's
[1:49:22] not the big picture of predestination.
[1:49:25] The big picture of predestination is
[1:49:27] that he's doing something in our lives
[1:49:31] to bring us to an end, to bring us to a
[1:49:33] purpose. So that's love. That's God's
[1:49:35] love to you. He's doing something in
[1:49:37] your life to bring you to an expected
[1:49:39] end, which is what? To be conformed to
[1:49:42] the image of his son
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; that he might be the firstborn among
[1:49:48] many brethren. And that is what we're
[1:49:50] we're predestinated unto adoption. We're
[1:49:53] to predestinated to be like Jesus
[1:49:55] Christ.
[1:49:57] If to put it another way, we're to be
[1:49:59] imitators of God or we're to become
[1:50:02] amateur gods on the earth as the
[1:50:04] scripture says. God manifest in the
[1:50:07] flesh, the bride as a whole. So this is
[1:50:10] the place that he's leading us to. This
[1:50:12] is the direction that his love is taking
[1:50:15] us towards is to be conformed to the
[1:50:17] image of Christ. And if we can
[1:50:19] understand is that love is actually if I
[1:50:22] can get to the verse and hope maketh not
[1:50:24] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[1:50:26] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:50:29] which is given to us.
[1:50:31] Amen. So love true agape love is not
[1:50:36] something that you can work yourself
[1:50:38] into. Now it is work it is effort. It is
[1:50:42] surrender but it can't be done on your
[1:50:45] own. It can only be done when the Holy
[1:50:48] Ghost comes into you. That's when the
[1:50:50] love of God is shed abroad in your
[1:50:52] hearts. When you get the when you get
[1:50:54] the true and genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:50:56] Ghost, what does that do? It means that
[1:50:58] the agape love of God is living inside
[1:51:01] of you and it's going forth and it's
[1:51:04] being extended out of you. You're filled
[1:51:07] with it. Amen.
[1:51:11] And so going back
[1:51:13] all these loves fillio sto aeros all of
[1:51:17] these are things that are human loves
[1:51:20] but as Christians the we understand the
[1:51:22] only way for them to be in order and
[1:51:24] completed and it it is order. God has
[1:51:27] order.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Jacob have I love. Esau have I hated.
[1:51:32] God has order and direction and a
[1:51:34] definitive purpose towards his love. And
[1:51:37] the same thing should be for us. If I if
[1:51:40] I love Brother Paul more than I love my
[1:51:43] wife, there's something very strange
[1:51:45] happening.
[1:51:46] That's that's out of order. That's not
[1:51:49] scriptural. I have to love I love my
[1:51:51] wife first. If I love my children more
[1:51:54] than I love my wife. Disordered
[1:51:56] disordered love. If I love my ministry
[1:51:59] or the image of my ministry more than I
[1:52:02] love my family, there is perverted love
[1:52:04] going on.
[1:52:06] And it's and it's dam it's it's bringing
[1:52:08] damage not only to myself but to my
[1:52:10] family.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; And so God has order in his love and he
[1:52:15] wants us to also have order in our love.
[1:52:18] If we give all our money to the church
[1:52:21] and our family is in poverty and has no
[1:52:23] clothes and can't eat and we're kicked
[1:52:26] out of our home, we're not spiritual.
[1:52:28] I'm not a spiritual man doing that.
[1:52:31] I'm an un very unspiritual man because
[1:52:33] the first first thing responsibility is
[1:52:36] if if I don't provide for my own I've
[1:52:39] denied the faith and I'm worse than an
[1:52:41] infidel and so again ordered love
[1:52:45] certainly once the needs of my family
[1:52:47] are met let's provide for other people
[1:52:49] let's help for other people and there's
[1:52:50] times the Lord will have you stretch
[1:52:52] yourself
[1:52:53] right there's there's many times that
[1:52:55] he'll have you stretch yourself by faith
[1:52:57] but as a general principle God is
[1:52:59] telling you you're providing for for
[1:53:00] your family. And there's an order to all
[1:53:02] that love. And really, the only way we
[1:53:04] can get it right is with God.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; The only way we we can tr we can study,
[1:53:11] we can read, and we can go into things,
[1:53:12] and we ought to, and we need to. That's
[1:53:14] what the word is for. But ultimately,
[1:53:17] God has to help us do that. And we need
[1:53:19] his constant correction and direction
[1:53:23] and leadership in our own lives. And
[1:53:25] without that, we'll all make a mess of
[1:53:28] everything.
[1:53:30] But it also isn't simply just get the
[1:53:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:53:33] everything's fine. There's teaching and
[1:53:36] instruction and learning and growth that
[1:53:38] needs to happen. But it will never
[1:53:40] happen without the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:41] Ghost.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; And so he he anoints and sends the
[1:53:44] five-fold ministry. And within that
[1:53:46] there's teachers and there's instruction
[1:53:48] and righteousness and all of these
[1:53:50] things. And if we we don't have those
[1:53:53] things, then we'll be for sure be out of
[1:53:55] balance. And we'll just saying, "Why am
[1:53:57] I fighting with my wife? if I got the
[1:53:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost 20 years ago.
[1:54:01] Well, you got to learn a little bit
[1:54:02] something about love.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; There's a little something that God is
[1:54:06] trying to help you to grow into.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you'd come.
[1:54:16] So, love has to be ordered
[1:54:19] properly for it to be love.
[1:54:23] If we don't love God first above
[1:54:25] everything else, then for sure all of
[1:54:27] our love will be disordered.
[1:54:31] As we talked about before, each of those
[1:54:33] human loves that we have, there's each
[1:54:35] of their own pitfalls that they have and
[1:54:38] that we can fall into and that probably
[1:54:40] we all have fallen into at one point in
[1:54:44] time of of our life. If we're honest
[1:54:47] with oursel, we might be in the middle
[1:54:49] of falling into those pitfalls. Now
[1:54:51] Lord, the the Lord is extending his
[1:54:54] grace to you to grow out of that and to
[1:54:58] grow up into agape love. Grow up into
[1:55:01] perfect love.
[1:55:05] So love is not a feeling. Love is an
[1:55:07] action. Love is a supernatural power.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Love takes work. And love has within it
[1:55:15] the purpose of spiritual growth.
[1:55:19] It's so it's so critical for us to
[1:55:22] understand love this way because we live
[1:55:23] in a culture and society that completely
[1:55:26] perverts
[1:55:28] just the very word love. I now I've
[1:55:31] preached on this how many times in front
[1:55:34] of my family and somebody will say I
[1:55:35] love this and my whole family goes
[1:55:39] is he going to talk about it to them?
[1:55:43] But I I feel like this is such a great
[1:55:46] and important revelation to us in this
[1:55:48] hour because it is the hour of perfect
[1:55:51] love.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; And if we think love is just always
[1:55:54] being sweet and always saying the nice
[1:55:56] things, we like to think that it is when
[1:55:59] we're when when you're from Minnesota.
[1:56:02] It's always saying the sweet and nice
[1:56:03] things and nothing uncomfortable. Then
[1:56:05] we haven't figured out what love is yet.
[1:56:09] It says those things, but it also says
[1:56:11] the other things, too. It doesn't just
[1:56:14] say the hard things and it doesn't just
[1:56:16] say the good things. It is speaking
[1:56:19] God's word and God's word has it all
[1:56:22] before us. God convicts us sometimes and
[1:56:25] God pours his love and his grace into us
[1:56:27] to to heal the sav and the wounds that
[1:56:29] we have. And so praise the Lord. That's
[1:56:31] what he wants you to be. He wants you to
[1:56:34] enter into that place where you're
[1:56:37] becoming him and he is becoming you. If
[1:56:41] we can realize that, as I mentioned
[1:56:42] before, the mighty angel bringing down
[1:56:45] the book wasn't just merely so that we
[1:56:47] could behold the greatness of God. It's
[1:56:49] so that we could enter into and become
[1:56:52] all that he has us to be
[1:56:55] as as a brides, the fullness of him that
[1:56:58] fills all and all. He wants us to have
[1:57:01] the fullness of perfect love. He wants
[1:57:03] us to be his hands and feet. He wants us
[1:57:06] to pe be the people that go and have a
[1:57:08] cup of coffee with someone who's hurting
[1:57:10] and broken, that's experiencing pain in
[1:57:13] their life. He wants us to sit down and
[1:57:16] talk with them and help them to see the
[1:57:17] bigger purpose of the bigger plan. And
[1:57:20] he's put put he's allowed us to go
[1:57:22] through so many circumstances in our own
[1:57:24] lives and then come and he's sent
[1:57:27] comforters to us to teach us and to
[1:57:30] train us and to encourage us so that
[1:57:32] then we can take that encouragement and
[1:57:35] strength and give it to others.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Because you realize at the end of the
[1:57:39] day this perfect love is actually you're
[1:57:42] becoming God manifest.
[1:57:45] You're becoming
[1:57:47] the open book that's been eaten and
[1:57:49] spoken forth. Amen. It's your life that
[1:57:52] you live, but it's the word that you
[1:57:53] speak and it's the atmosphere that you
[1:57:55] create. Amen. I'd like to sing the
[1:57:57] goodness of God as as we pray here.
[1:58:00] Heavenly Father,
[1:58:03] Lord, we so thankful for your goodness,
[1:58:06] Lord. We're so thankful for your love,
[1:58:10] Lord, that you see what's in us, Lord,
[1:58:14] far beyond what we see.
[1:58:18] I know many times I look at myself and
[1:58:22] you hear things that people say and
[1:58:24] they're encouraging you and saying good
[1:58:26] things and I think, who in the world are
[1:58:29] they talking about? I don't I know I
[1:58:32] know me.
[1:58:34] I know my weaknesses. I know my many
[1:58:37] failures,
[1:58:39] Lord. But you see something more
[1:58:43] in me, but you see what's what's so
[1:58:45] amazing is you see something more
[1:58:49] in all of us, Lord. I pray, Father, that
[1:58:52] you would be a you would be a strength,
[1:58:54] that you'd be a comfort, Lord. That you
[1:58:56] would move and work in people's lives.
[1:59:01] Father, that's our desire that our heart
[1:59:03] would be set right, set in order, Lord,
[1:59:07] that our love would be right. That would
[1:59:09] be expressing Jesus Christ.
[1:59:13] We commit ourselves to you, Lord, in the
[1:59:16] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I love you,
[1:59:19] Lord. Let's stand. For your mercies
[1:59:24] never fail me.
[1:59:28] All my days I've been held in your
[1:59:33] hands.
[1:59:36] From the moment that I wake up
[1:59:40] until I lay my head.
[1:59:44] Oh, I will sing
[1:59:47] of the goodness
[1:59:49] of God.
[1:59:51] Hallelujah.
[1:59:54] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:03] And all my life you have been so so
[2:00:08] good.
[2:00:11] With every breath that I am able.
[2:00:17] Oh, I will sing
[2:00:20] of the goodness
[2:00:22] of God.
[2:00:25] I love your voice.
[2:00:30] You have led me through the fire.
[2:00:35] In darkest night,
[2:00:38] you are close like no other.
[2:00:44] I've known you as a father.
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:48] I've known you as a friend.
[2:00:52] And I have live
[2:00:55] in the goodness
[2:00:57] of God.
[2:01:03] All you have been
[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:12] you
[2:01:15] so
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:31] I love you Lord.
[2:01:32] I love you, Lord.
[2:01:38] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[2:01:43] All my days
[2:01:46] held in your hand.
[2:01:51] From the moment that I wake up,
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:59] I will sing
[2:02:02] of the goodness
[2:02:04] of God.
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:06] [Applause]
[2:02:10] My life,
[2:02:13] thank you, Lord.
[2:02:15] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:18] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:26] With every breath that I am able,
[2:02:32] I will sing
[2:02:34] of the goodness
[2:02:36] of God.
[2:02:40] Praise the Lord. God bless you. How many
[2:02:42] enjoy the word today?
[2:02:44] Praise the Lord. Wonderful word of God.
[2:02:47] Hallelujah. Anybody in my life like this
[2:02:50] morning that could handle the sword so
[2:02:53] calmly and gently
[2:02:56] and yet cut to some things that we
[2:02:58] really need to think about. And I don't
[2:03:01] mean that to belittle anybody, but we
[2:03:03] want to make sure as believers that
[2:03:06] we're not living on some other type of
[2:03:08] love that's out of order and calling it
[2:03:11] agape love.
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:14] And so I I encourage you to go back and
[2:03:16] look at those things and and look in the
[2:03:18] mirror of God's word because we heard
[2:03:21] both sides today and I just there's
[2:03:23] somebody a few weeks ago that said
[2:03:25] someone had told them he said yes that
[2:03:27] person is is controlling you with love
[2:03:32] and I thought about it and I said no
[2:03:33] wait a minute it can't be the right kind
[2:03:36] of love
[2:03:38] but and it wasn't the right kind of love
[2:03:40] but often we make our type love such a
[2:03:44] god that we actually call it the love of
[2:03:47] Christ
[2:03:48] controlling them through love and I I
[2:03:51] think we should look at these things
[2:03:53] because this is the hour only perfect
[2:03:55] love will go over there and we need it
[2:03:58] more than ever and we won't get it just
[2:03:59] because we have a service we get it say
[2:04:01] I'm looking at myself and say Lord purge
[2:04:04] those loves that are in disorder
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; and not not under the headship of agape
[2:04:10] love
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; he didn't use the term terms today. The
[2:04:13] modern terms are codependency and
[2:04:15] narcissism, but you heard those today in
[2:04:18] the service. We don't use the worldly
[2:04:20] terms, but this world's full of it. And
[2:04:22] I find sometimes even amongst believers
[2:04:25] calling it love and calling it
[2:04:26] parenting. And it's narcissism. It's
[2:04:29] codependency.
[2:04:30] Codependency is when you're controlling
[2:04:32] the other person because you need them
[2:04:35] so bad and you need them to need you so
[2:04:38] bad. And it's all I love you. I love
[2:04:40] you. I love you. But it's a control. And
[2:04:42] it's not the perfect thing to love
[2:04:44] another person with. And it continues to
[2:04:47] bind up families. It continues to bind
[2:04:49] up people's life. But yet, it's because
[2:04:51] it's called the love of Christ, we
[2:04:53] accept it more openly.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; So, it's been a bit of a rebuke and
[2:04:59] handling the sword this morning, but
[2:05:01] it's been the word of God. I'm going to
[2:05:03] ask you to listen to it again and look
[2:05:04] at our lives, all of us, and especially
[2:05:07] every every age, but especially the
[2:05:09] young people. I hope you were listening.
[2:05:11] I hope you go back. It would be good if
[2:05:13] you studied all of those three types of
[2:05:17] love, four types of love, and knew that
[2:05:20] before you get into a romantic
[2:05:22] relationship.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; You might ought to understand all that
[2:05:27] before you just let your heart fall in
[2:05:29] love with somebody
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; because you could be labeling it so many
[2:05:33] things and even the will of God, but
[2:05:34] you're just quickly giving your heart to
[2:05:36] somebody and then pulling your heart
[2:05:37] back. And that's what I need. Romantic
[2:05:40] love is a wonderful thing. Uh if we
[2:05:42] didn't have it, we probably wouldn't
[2:05:44] have any, as he said, children or
[2:05:46] marriages or anything. But you see, it's
[2:05:48] a wonderful thing if it's in the order
[2:05:50] of God.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; But when it's by itself, it'll hurt your
[2:05:53] heart. It'll destroy you. It would be
[2:05:56] good if young people understood these
[2:05:58] four loves
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; and get the Holy Ghost love and reach
[2:06:02] for that before they get into
[2:06:04] relationships.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Amen." So I encourage you.
[2:06:08] I'm your friend. And you know, I speak
[2:06:09] to you about every Friday night and I'm
[2:06:11] your friend. Young people, this is this
[2:06:12] is an important thing for you to
[2:06:14] understand because we don't want to
[2:06:17] settle for second best.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Can I say it again? Let's say it for
[2:06:22] everybody. Don't settle for second best.
[2:06:25] God, fill me with agape love, the
[2:06:28] perfect love of God. And may that
[2:06:30] influence all my other loves, my family
[2:06:32] love, the emotions of family and all
[2:06:34] that. It can become a God. And a filial
[2:06:37] love becomes a god becomes the love. No,
[2:06:39] don't let that be a god. Let god be god.
[2:06:42] Let his love come and control and put
[2:06:45] into order all these other filio and
[2:06:48] areros and all these other things. Let
[2:06:50] him be the controller of it and also him
[2:06:53] love us the right way. And uh I want to
[2:06:55] say appreciate this especially when
[2:06:57] Jesus is speaking to Peter and it's so
[2:07:00] amazing to me with all of his mistakes
[2:07:03] and he's asking this question and I've
[2:07:05] I've preached it not that way but
[2:07:07] preached it is that Jesus is always
[2:07:10] asking us like he did Peter. Do you love
[2:07:13] me? How much do you love me? How deep do
[2:07:16] you love me? And to ask him three times
[2:07:18] because he knew where Peter was at. But
[2:07:20] sometimes he keeps asking us like he is
[2:07:22] in this morning in the service. Every
[2:07:24] one of us raise say I love the Lord. I
[2:07:26] love the Lord. How deeply do we love the
[2:07:28] Lord. How deep does it go? And I don't
[2:07:31] want other love another love making it
[2:07:33] some God and calling it Christianity. I
[2:07:35] want that perfect and divine love by the
[2:07:37] Holy Ghost. And he told Peter he's why
[2:07:39] he's there speaking and trying to get
[2:07:41] him to admit to his level of love that
[2:07:44] wasn't enough yet. While he's doing
[2:07:46] that, he's speaking his future.
[2:07:49] Isn't it great to serve a Lord that
[2:07:52] knows your future? And he's more
[2:07:54] interested not just in rebuking you, but
[2:07:56] speaking what your future will be.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; You're going to feed my lambs. And he
[2:08:02] said, when you're young, I've always
[2:08:03] used this scripture. When you're young,
[2:08:05] you kind of went and did whatever you
[2:08:07] wanted to and you got it figured out.
[2:08:08] You know everything. And that's our
[2:08:10] young generation. Everybody's an expert.
[2:08:12] Everybody knows everything. Young people
[2:08:13] know everything. And Jesus is saying, "I
[2:08:16] know you're young and you go and come as
[2:08:18] you please, but one day I'm going to
[2:08:20] speak your future. You're going to
[2:08:21] become a prisoner to the Lord, and I'm
[2:08:23] going to guide you by my Holy Spirit.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; That's your future. It's not just that I
[2:08:29] guide you. You're going to bring many
[2:08:31] souls to the kingdom of God." God knows
[2:08:34] your future. And he don't just put you
[2:08:36] down for your mistakes, but while he's
[2:08:39] correcting you. Isn't that correct?
[2:08:41] Isn't that the love of God? He can come
[2:08:43] like this morning and just administer
[2:08:45] that sword and we all get the light. It
[2:08:48] seemed like the lightest spanking I've
[2:08:50] ever got in my life this morning.
[2:08:53] Better than my mom's. I'm just telling
[2:08:55] it was a spanking, but yet it was just
[2:08:58] done so calm. How do you do that so
[2:09:00] calmly, so quietly?
[2:09:04] When God gives his correction, he has
[2:09:07] our purpose in mind every time he does
[2:09:09] it.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; He's got our future in mind. He's He see
[2:09:12] you can't even see where you're going,
[2:09:14] but God sees where you're going by
[2:09:16] predestination. So, he corrects you
[2:09:18] because he's bringing you to a final
[2:09:19] end. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Well,
[2:09:23] let's just just before we sing Love
[2:09:24] Never Gives Up, I want to sing that
[2:09:26] before we go. Let's take a just a
[2:09:29] moment, be sober about what the Lord has
[2:09:31] taught us this morning.
[2:09:33] Let's be sober about it and let's speak
[2:09:35] to him about it. Let's pray.
[2:09:38] Our
[2:09:40] heavenly father,
[2:09:42] thank you Lord for loving us this way.
[2:09:44] Thank you Lord for brother Jason
[2:09:46] yielding to the Lord. Thank you for
[2:09:48] these gifts in the body of Christ.
[2:09:50] Sometimes Lord that it's uh it's loud.
[2:09:53] Sometimes it's quiet. Sometimes it's
[2:09:56] different. Lord, we don't want to
[2:09:57] micromanage how you'll speak to us in a
[2:09:59] service. We don't want to coach the
[2:10:02] service onto something we want. We want
[2:10:04] you to speak to us in any way that you
[2:10:06] feel led to speak to us, Lord. and you
[2:10:08] can lead us in that. And I thank you for
[2:10:10] this today. If there's any of these
[2:10:14] false loves or loves that are out of
[2:10:16] order in our lives, may you show it to
[2:10:19] us. May we look in the mirror of your
[2:10:22] word and Lord not be blamers of be
[2:10:25] victim mentality and
[2:10:27] blaming everybody else for our problems
[2:10:30] and codependent on somebody needing
[2:10:34] somebody else instead of needing you
[2:10:35] ultimately with all of our narcissism
[2:10:39] Lord just controlling and all about
[2:10:41] himself all about herself
[2:10:44] these ups and downs and these loves Lord
[2:10:47] they'll be corrected
[2:10:50] in a group of people in the last days
[2:10:52] and that'll be your bride cuz your
[2:10:54] prophet said the only place divine love
[2:10:57] will be left in this world will be in
[2:10:59] the bride of Christ. That's where you'll
[2:11:02] find it. Mold us, shape us, make us into
[2:11:04] it, Lord. And Lord, we're just moved and
[2:11:08] sobered by your word today. We pray,
[2:11:10] Father, you'll take us deeper into the
[2:11:13] presence of God and into a life of
[2:11:15] divine love. Grant it, Father, we pray.
[2:11:19] We We offer up all that we are upon your
[2:11:22] altar this morning for you to change us.
[2:11:25] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
