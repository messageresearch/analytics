Power in the preious Blood sing it one more time I know there's power power Wonder working power in the blood Precious Blood of the Lamb I know there's power power wonderwork power in the pre just blood of the Lamb amen amen praise the lord we believe that with all of our heart tonight if you turn with in the Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1 it's certain a joy to be in his house and gather with you all tonight God bless you for coming near and far God bless you each one it's just a privilege to be with you and those that are listening in line online as well God bless you and God give you food tonight for your soul praise the Lord and so we appreciate brother Gideon praying for the Reagan family of course they've been deep in our hearts and sent some encouraging words just to them this morning and uh so it's just sometimes God does things that are different than what we expected and uh it's difficult because to be honest sometimes it was like one of my daughters brought up you know you can't help it doesn't can't help but think of the question why sometimes this happens to people that are so faithful someone like brother Donnie and his daughter and family and her confession was the word of God and healing all the way until the end and he he begs the question why to people like that and it turns this way and then you have other people who have no regard for the word of God God and blatantly against it and accusing and brings accusations and they seem to get by I don't think we'll ever understand those Mysteries because God is God and job if you if you look at job there was no explanation for that because he was doing everything that he needed to do and so we have to put our trust in the Lord but it doesn't make it easy when we have uh brother the Reagan family losing a loved one like this under these circumstance ances so let's pray for them let's lift them up and let's remember them in the coming days and coming months because many times it can be grieving for quite a while even though they know the truth of Resurrection they know the truth of where she is and all these things are things that we hold dear to our hearts but the loss is not ever easy and so my heart goes out to them tonight we're going to read tonight from Luke chapter 1 Eli and Kendall good to have you praise the Lord didn't know you were popping in here on us Luke chap 1 and verse 30 is where we want start start reading and this may look like that I'm preaching a Christmas message tonight because I'm reading about Mary and the angel coming to her but I'm not although they can use this if they want for the Christmas broadcast um and I understand that they're in the studio been working because on the December 10th we'll have a an evening of gospel music and Christmas music here on December 10th and uh thank you appreciate it um so they're in the studio preparing some uh songs for Christmas so uh maybe they'll get some inspiration out of what I preach tonight because we're trying to come up with some original songs I wrote a song here a couple nights here at the piano for them and gave it I'm going to give that to him so but this is uh along our series on the Holy Ghost I'm going to bring in the New Testament now we've taken a lot of the prophecies from the Old Testament for telling the holy ghost coming and what it is and those uh things that we can look at that we can understand what the Holy Ghost is so now we're crossing over into the New Testament and the places that he mentions the Holy Ghost and what it is and it starts right in Matthew and so let's just read here in uh chap in Luke uh in the beginning here and it we'll just pick it up here in verse 30 and the angel said unto Mary fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end so now we have the first Advent or the first coming of Christ and he's going to be born a baby and we realize that this great event now God is visiting a young girl who he's going to begin this Creation in in a young girl there are churches around there's actually churches around that are singing and proclaiming the coming Messiah there's actually prophecies going on there's actually the reading the Bible of the Bible the Scrolls there's churches around and so everybody believes that this is going to happen no nobody knew it would happen this way but there's churches around and yet when God moves in to bring this to pass he comes to one young girl to bring this new creation that's just a great mystery in God but you ought to raise your hand tonight and say I'm a nobody Mary was a nobody I'm a Nobody But if his kingdom comes to me bypasses a lot of the denominations but comes to me individually to put his Spirit within me you ought to raise your hand and say thanks be to God for his mercy and Grace I was noticing a few verses later where Mary it's called Mary's joyful song and I didn't realize that was in there but she said sings quite a nice song there after she's rejoicing after she meets Elizabeth but here we'll finish up in uh verse uh 33 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God you can imagine why I'm reading this now it refers to the Holy Ghost we've been preaching on the Holy Ghost and in relation to you receiving the Holy Ghost and so now you can imagine that he says what's going to happen is going to be by the Holy Ghost and guess what he's not bringing it to the churches he's not bringing it to the movement he's bringing it to a young girl and this is going to happen in you talk about having to believe the impossible let's see how she responds and Behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Barron for with God nothing shall be impossible so she was Barren and God said but if I say she's not going to be Barren anymore whatever is impossible God makes it possible how many believes that we got to believe in a God that can do The Impossibles so he's already saying it's already impossible if a woman is and but I take the things that are impossible I can do it now he goes further with Mary who wasn't with a man and he says you're going to conceive now we're talking levels of impossibility that it's hard for the human mind to grasp but the soul can say Amen look at what Mary does for that for With God all nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold no more questions she just had one question I wasn't with a man how's this going to happen but the questions are gone no more questions she said behold hold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her Heavenly Father Grant Grace To Us Lord for the service tonight and we pray that you'll teach us as we sit at your feet Lord and learn bless brother Donnie sister Carol uh Lord the Parker family all of the families involved bless them and encourage them this evening in the months to come with your grace I pray and your comfort at at this this time be with them we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated so when we start talking about the New Testament now the scriptures that mention the Holy Ghost uh we want to enter that a little bit tonight and um talk about it and see what we can learn from it how many wants to learn more about it amen so here's some points that I've been laying uh down in uh many parts of this series and the Lord just keeps leading me there and you'll find it tonight as well but it seems like the Lord really wants us to draw a distinction in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and the things that he can be doing when he comes down and the difference in that and you going deeper in something in the soul level happening because remember I said last Wednesday night he comes he'll pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh but his intention is not just to put it on your flesh or your spirit cuz how many knows you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your spirit and not your soul so what when he comes and pours out his Spirit he may do many things but his intention is to fill you on your soul level so that your desires change and that you will have that in you that identifies the word for your age and that you can follow it and be obedient to it so in in line with that I just want to bring up some reminder statements and that in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost people will uh be affected people will get better actually people will actually feel better even though they might not go deeper if you're in the atmosphere in the presence of the Lord and the Holy Ghost is there you you're probably going to feel better you can be affected in many ways when the Holy Ghost is there no doubt all sitting here tonight are under the work of the Holy Ghost in some way in your life you could I won't ask for hands but I could that that everybody sitting here this evening and listening online is somehow under a work of the Holy Ghost and he's been dealing with your life in some way at some level he's dealing with you and so the stage even the stages that we come through in serving the lord all those stages are actually a work of the Holy Ghost when you repent it's because he led you to repent when you were out in the world the Holy Ghost knew where you were matter of fact one place brother BR says he comes and finds you he hunts you out he hunts the elected for that age and finds you in a factory or in a school you're a school teacher you're in a bar whatever it is he knows where you so he hunts you out to come and find you because you're not meant to be in a bar you're meant to be a son and daughter of God so he hunts those that are his and goes and catches them and finds them and brings them to his throne all the stages that God deals with our life is actually by him the Holy Ghost justification a stage of coming in Repentance uh these are all things that he's leading you and then we find there's a time when he comes in you and becomes sealed into you until the day of Redemption how many know that Hebrews says he seals Us by the Holy Ghost not until the next Revival not until the next youth cap but he can so it's so powerful that he can can seal his spirit in you in your soul and seal the devil out in your soul level and you're sealed not until the next service you're sealed until the day of redemption no wonder the devil doesn't like the Holy Ghost because when it hits that he can't get to their soul he can't influence their soul their desire is towards the things of God and they're going to say Amen to the word of God and follow the rest of their lives the rest of their lives they're sealed they may make mistakes they may they may go through hard times they may go through sickness because remember the only thing the devil is left with is your outer two Realms he can't get to your soul it's sealed in so the only thing is left with is your spirit your emotions and your body so guess what until you get your new body you're going to get sick and the devil loves it when you get sick he it's the devil that brings sickness you all know that right yeah it's the devil and we have all the new names for stuff but really it's it's demons trying to hinder your physical body and that's why we pray and rebuke those demons say God make me well by your atonement because it's the devil's trying to make me sick why because he only has your physical body and your emotions sometimes to dabble in and bring you down that's why the Holy Ghost on the inside when it's strong and it it rises above and said no no no you're not even going to control my spirit or my body I'm going to claim the atonement and I'm going to have Victory not only in my whole until the day of R I'm going to have victory in my spirit and I'm going to be healed by the blood of the Lamb that's the way we deal with the devil because a lot of people just beat let the devil beat them up in their thinking beat them up in their emotions beat them up in physical sickness and they become used to that sickness and they complain about it they live with it the rest of their lives and they're they give in in other words they said I guess this is my trial I guess I'll always have this we should never settle for second best when we have an atonement that says you are healed God takes somebody but we never stop believing that God can heal somebody cuz he said it I didn't say it he said it and I'm going to continue to believe it until God says that person's time is finished I'm going to believe it till the next second the last second excuse me praise the Lord so now there's a time when he leads you these are different segments of our life and so but I desire for us to understand further the true meaning of the Holy Ghost being more than just repentance more than Brokenness more than crying these are things that would lead to it more than emotion the Holy Ghost is more than just a rush of enthusiasm I I felt so enthused and I felt oh I such a rush of something but it it has to be deeper than that and we love enthusiasm and and sometimes I'll just say this people can get under the enthusiasm and they think it's the spirit of God and they'll even prophesy I a wrong prophecy a wrong Pro this is a thing that I still to this day it's difficult for me to understand but somebody can be led it's the Holy Spirit but brings something sometimes the Holy Spirit brings something dead on and then some sometimes somebody speaks in their own enthusiasm or their own burden and it's not dead on and it's wrong we're taught in the message that if that happens you got to repent of it you're going to repent of that because it wasn't God that told you to say that if it's not true and it doesn't come to pass it's good Bible teaching right we know these things right we don't dabble in these things and so it's a very serious thing when when that happens but sometimes uh brother BR says that somebody can just be under an enthusiasm speak something thinking it's the word of the Lord and they they uh they go with it and uh we don't want just enthusiasm but we really want to be spirit-led and Spirit-filled even a sanct ified life sometimes can be an Evidence because I'm Sanctified that means I have the Holy Ghost there are many people that sanctify their lives from the world and C cut themselves off from the world and don't dress like the world and don't act like the world there are many groups that do that I think it's a good thing the more sanctified people we can have on this planet Earth praise the Lord for them but that's not the evidence that you have it in your soul that's a work of the Holy Ghost that's a work of him but this got to be and so I've been drawing these distinctions and I do it this is not to take away from anything that the Lord has given you or to discourage you all it's not for that purpose it's to show you that a deeper experience with God a baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that will put you in a Rapture the oil in your soul will put you in a Rapture what is the new birth then it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not that you joined a church not that you were around where the Revelation was being preached but it is the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's jumping right to exactly what it is that's the evidence and when you have it people ask when you have it when you have the real thing what will you do and I think we'll get into some specifics with that further in the study but tonight let me say What You Won't Do okay if you have the Holy Ghost this is this is what you won't do with it you will never deny or turn down any of the word of God you won't do that it can't do that you'll never deny or turn down any of that's why a prophet would refer to those people sometimes who believe the days of Miracles is passed he said you can't have the Holy Ghost and ever say something like that because the Bible ible says he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he says he's the same and whatever he did 2,000 years ago whatever he did he's able to do it again so the Holy Ghost in you which is the author of the word if it says that it's I don't care how it looks the word will always it'll never deny and start saying you know what I'm starting to believe there is no Miracles today and you can find churches that believe the day days of Miracles are passed they they know he doesn't do Miracles anymore but you'll never have the evidence of the Holy Ghost you'll never have something there when it's denying a part of the word that's so Crystal Clear you you can't that's not what the Holy Ghost does you can never deny or turn down the word of God you can't and also I believe you will never leave Christ and go back to the world and backslide there's got to be something stronger in you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would keep you can you say am man from denying Christ and going back into the things of the world say well there's people that do that well they had a lot of of God praise the Lord for what he did but somewhere along the line it wasn't enough to hold them when we sing something keeps holding me it's not you and if it's holding you for heading back full steam to the things of the world you didn't get something deep enough to start out with is that okay with everybody amen that's why we pray for those to come back because they didn't say well look at all these people they leave and all these other things and so you just pray they must not had something real solid enough because you can never deny Christ or deny the word when you have the Holy Ghost in your soul you can't do it that's more than conscience that's more than a message conscience a message conscience will keep you out of trouble pretty good but I'm not preaching a message conscience I'm preaching something that's so deep that you're sealed in and the devil is sealed out and what you desire is the word of God the the Holy Ghost is linked with the fresh word sent to lead you into more truth so so and that that's where it's at it's tied to the word the Holy Ghost is always tied to the word the feelings the blessings the emotions the gifts the enthusiasm the outpouring of the Holy Ghost is not the best thing to say there is the Holy Ghost there is the evidence that's not the best thing even though these are outpourings these are manifestations of his true Holy Spirit many times you see and and we look to that and say well that must be the evidence we can't look to that it's it's it's what the it's what the fresh word that God has given it's what the spirit is saying to the church now and the Bible says he that hath an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to the church now that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost you have an ear to hear it there's something in you that's saying Amen to it you have a reception for it you have a an antenna you're like a TV am I really saying this you're like a TV with an antenna and if you got the Holy Ghost you have only have one channel and the antenna is picking up the true word of God can you say amen and bringing it so it'll be lived out not in a bunch of books and and a Bible but it's to be lived out you're a tel you're you're a television to express God's Vision only one channel and that's the word for this hour to live it out for this hour so if you've got the Holy Ghost you got an antenna and it's only drawn in that station it's only drawn in that thing so that you can manifest that over over that one television station it's very limited and I'm glad it's limited oh praise the Lord science been begin to develop things like television but all of it is a type of where the spiritual man is going the astronauts and all that was a type of where we're going spiritually the horse and buggy the automobile can you say me the airplane the the the spaceship can you say Amen it's all showing where we're going spiritually by the Holy Ghost and so if you come out out with a TV that pulls in a certain Channel and expresses the image of that there's only one image that I want to express in my television and that's the image of Jesus Christ the word for this hour you can live Luther's day or Wesley's day but the message of this hour is to be lived through his bride and you're going to see it in her life you got an antenna for it you you draw that in it draw you draw it in and it displays on your screen first time that you have the Holy Ghost used in the New Testament is concerning the conception of Christ in Mary and uh it's it's the Holy Ghost is used mostly in the Bible around the birth of Christ okay and the other place that's used most often is around the birth of the church so both of them are births this term the Holy Ghost is used mostly around the birth of Christ and then the birth of the church and last Wednesday night we were saying that he came as the Masterpiece at the end of the old Old Testament he had all the prophets and God was trying to say something and get to his final Masterpiece or at least it looked like his final one he comes and Jesus was his Masterpiece of God being in man he finished it out can you say Amen so the birth of Christ that's why it's saying the Holy Ghost because it's bringing that Masterpiece up then at Calvary he took a piece of himself out and now he's going to have a masterpiece bride to restore not only the second Adam but the second Eve after 2,000 years he takes a piece of the master and begin to build a masterpiece through her can you say Amen so now you can see why at the birth of Jesus and at the birth of the Church Holy Ghost is mentioned creation of God how many knows the Bible says that Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God so it says Jesus was the beginning if it says he's the beginning that he's going to have more of a creation he's going to have more Sons and Daughters of God and they're not going to be church members that are putting out a religion they're going to be who they are by a creation inside them the god the Creator will come down and create something within them this is this is a whole different level than denominational putting it on or a ritual to live by or a dress code to live by has zero to do with that even though it will live out those things this is not religion this is a creation of God in you glory be to God so we see this Holy Ghost around and now hopefully it's a curiosity for you to read your Bible at this Christmas time coming up you can read your Bible because Holy Ghost Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost said this to Zacharias and the Holy Ghost filled Anna and the Holy Ghost so now you never hear this term now you start hearing it around the birth of Christ all right so now uh it's around the birth of Christ and it's around the birth of the church in both places it has a similar we have a similar similar thing going on the spirit of God becoming one with Humanity the spirit of God becoming one with Humanity no longer was it just an anointing on a prophet to prophesy no longer was it just in the air around God's people showing himself around showing himself in a pillar of Fire shung himself in a in in in a cloud above the children of Israel no longer was it just that he can still do that and he has done that but this is a this is honing in on a specific creation that will be the creation of God and man now was God a Creator before that he's always been the Creator and he created heavens and earth and he created all these other things he spoke those Stars into existence and told them where to go in their positions and God the great Creator had his first creation but this this would be the beginning of the creation of God it's not that he hasn't created before it's that now this will be let me word it different this will be the beginning of the creation of God in humanity praise the Lord the beginning of the creation of God in humanity now we're talking the holy ghost in the soul and so now we see that no longer will it be anointing on a prophet or a prophet phcy or the air just around God's people and showing the pillar of fire it would not just be around human beings it would Unite with them it started a new creation in Mary a creation of God being in man God becoming flesh so it would no longer be God above us that was the Old Testament it would not just be God With Us that's Jesus Christ but its intention was to be God in us by a new creation Now if you're a Bible reader you will think of the scripture that actually says says those that have come in Christ those that have Christ are a new creation they are a new Creator creature excuse me Creator they are a new creature all things that are past are in the past all things are old All Things become new you are a brand new creation and God created what was inside you that's the Holy Ghost he starts over he starts a new creation in you isn't the grace of God that you can just say Lord thank you you start over and boy did he ever start over with you because you were a piece of work he didn't say let me just take what I got here and work with it he said no it's a brand new creation I'm G to start from the soul and I'm going to create something brand new this will be the new you big time the new you and then it work itself out brother BR says it works itself and it pushes out from the soul and you keep growing in Christ is push pushes up into into your life and takes over your body Christ pushes his way out up into your mouth that you stop cussing and you stop swearing and this mouth is used to give glory to God it doesn't gossip anymore it's not used to bring accusations against Elders anymore he's the Holy Ghost is pushing out into your mouth somebody give me an amen tonight the Holy Ghost pushes out as you grow and then it pushes out into your eyes that you only want to look at the right things then the Holy Ghost he says pushes into your very mind and your thinking that let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus and you become you change your thinking let this mind be in you so it it keeps pushing out until you just become a vessel that's filled with the Holy Spirit but it starts with a new creation in here and that's the Holy Ghost so now we see then this was a new creation he started in Mary this was a cre cretion of God being in man this was God becoming flesh really really not just trying to be like God this was God coming in flesh there's a big difference in man trying to be like God and God coming in man and living out in flesh this is his creation God being in flesh and so we are Mary the Holy Ghost was there there present to bring new life to bring something brand new to birth something new and in this case it was C going to cause Mary to conceive by the Holy Ghost to conceive a new life within her now Mary didn't have anything to do with that and that's why Mary didn't get the Holy Ghost there herself personally but she was used as a a as a vessel that God would put that seed in her to bring that new life so I can use her as a type of what happens to us even though Mary had to go to the upper room and she was in the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost for for herself but this was so powerful that God would take a girl and I'm going to begin my creation uh and often when I'm talking about the serpent seed and what happened in the garden my question is always um why did we why did Jesus have to be virgin born and so because he just was that's the answer no no think about it why did Jesus have to become virgin born without sexual relations the normal way everybody's born why did he have to be virgin Bo without the sexual relations and finally they just start because it exposes what happened in the garden we were supposed to come by the creation of God Adam could have created his children but Satan come in and now a secondary way of children being born by seexual relations grace of God steps in says you know what I'll take this Fallen creation what wasn't supposed to happen that way but in my plan I'll be a savior CU I'm in in my heart I can't save somebody for their condition unless they're lost so God says down the road I'll switch this around and I'll take my grace will now take a sborn man or woman and by his grace I'll change their nature I'll create a virginity spiritually speaking amen it's powerful so I asked I said how something happened in the garden then that we don't realize it was more than just eating an apple why did he have to be virgin more because he had to he had to change what took place in the garden to bring us into a fallen condition virgin born knew creation so Mary causing Mary to conceive we are natural Holy Ghost that's spiritual so here the natural connects with the spiritual never before happened quite this way that the natural man man and this is a woman uh Mary natural she was natural there wasn't anything really spiritual about her except for what I'm going to read in a minute something within her begin to Rose and believe the word of God be done to me according to Thy word but she was just a common girl just like the girls here anybody else common girl in the world she loved the Lord but there wasn't anything special about her she was natural she was just a young girl God takes the natural and he takes his spirit and he Blends the two together and that's what we call Supernatural the natural and the spiritual become Supernatural got that everybody that's my visual tonight the natural and the spiritual come connected and become Supernatural your new birth is not being a better boy or girl it is super natural it is a new creation and don't you ever settle for anything less young person don't settle for anything else religion isn't working anymore even in the message religion isn't the smear on the message is not working anymore it won't get you through won't give you a good marriage won't give you a good family you have nothing to build upon only the new creation of God by the Holy Ghost is and that's why you need to ask God for it I need it in my life this is not a religion this is not I'm okay because I'm in the message this is a new creation this is a supernatural thing that will happen in you Hallelujah so now how many know a woman and a man have to be together for New Life to conceive how many of you know how many you know that a man and woman have to be together sexually for something to conceive to bring forth another life it's the same way in the spiritual you have to connect with God spiritually so new life can begin in you you can't say I'm doing my own thing I don't need this I I go to church I'm fine I'm good no no you got to connect with Jesus Christ you have to connect with him there has to be a spiritual Supernatural connection for something other than yourself to conceive within yourself and so now that's what happens naturally that's what happens with god he has children to produce in his mind before the foundation of the world but there has to be a bedding ground there has to be a place for that seed to come in that seed to be triggered and come to life and that's in his predestinated bride that that Holy Ghost will come to it's only meant to go there it's not just to get a give a happy feeling when it comes and he he brings his seed it's to come into His elect and bring forth and conceive a brand new life somebody ought to say Amen this is the purpose of the Holy Ghost that is why he comes with his word to bring Oneness to to to make a connection a spiritual contact notice when that seed was planted in Mary she did not the moment it was planted in her she did not feel one thing there's no record to say that Mary said at that moment I felt different we don't have a record of that she did not say uh say I feel I feel different Bible says the first thing is she had a powerful powerful uh belief in the the god of the impossibilities the god that could do the impossible she Rose to the occasion and she says you got to imagine friends she don't understand any of this this is beyond understanding it reminds me of people that come in sometimes and they sometimes if they haven't been churched sometimes they're better off that not have been churched and grow raised up in the church but it reminds me people come sometimes and if it was about the knowledge of the word and what's being preached even tonight over the Pulpit probably 90% of it they'd say in their minds thinking and trying to I don't have a clue what the man's talking about I do not understand this is way over my head but every once in a while something Supernatural happens to that person something kicks in Beyond this and the smallest little thing gets their attention I need God I need God and I don't understand everything he's saying there I've had people lots of people come and say when I first came now I'm beginning to understand now the words opening to me but when I first came I didn't have a clue what you're talking about but I knew I sense the presence of God something triggered in my heart I knew I've never felt love like this hello I've never felt an atmosphere there I've never they say this about a church it's it's funny how others don't say it but they say I've never felt love like I felt in that congregation being there it's just so these things look at the look at the Holiness look at the pure Spirit look at the things that are not seeing every day in this world and they come into our atmosphere and it's other things that draw their Hungry Heart than just the technicality of the word matter of fact if I'm if I'm uh and I know that seed of God it'll respond to the word of God it it's not going to resist it but we'll see they only come in on a very simple natural thing sometimes but they start to believe in God begins to do something Supernatural in them praise the Lord I don't know if she's listening or not I don't want to embarrass her but what a work that the Lord is doing by this sister Holly that's been coming to service every Sunday and we were able to have supper with her and praise be to God and she just listened to the broadcast the first of the year and started visiting and she's very excited very excited about the word of God grew up in a Baptist church and I'm sure she would share her testimony with you but grew up in a Baptist Church and found us and just just excited about what the Lord is opening up to her amen you never know how God's going to catch an elected of God but a lot of times it's not because they had this great understanding of the word can you say Amen a lot of times it's not that and Mary she didn't feel anything at the beginning she didn't uh she didn't have that that very moment and she did not say I feel different she believed what God Said and she could have had Rebellion or she could and by the way does anybody know that what Mary's name means um what does her name mean I'm glad you ask it means bitterness it means Rebellion that's what the nature of the name that she was born with and so you know your name goes with your nature a little bit so God chooses a girl whose name has bitterness and Rebellion to it that's her nature her normal tendency would be look at this all and say no way no way Jose that would be the normal response for her to be to something that the angel first of all Angels meeting with her it's like who am I uh cyesis the priest have you stopped by the temple I mean who am I the Angels visiting this young 15-year-old girl praise the Lord and here he visits already an angel and he says I you're highly favored of God you you're special God has chosen you for a special thing comes into that room tells her that and now she's everything in her nature everything would resist and say no I I'm not doing this and God chose somebody like that so that something rises in her to override even what she's feeling in her nature to say whatever your word says says be it unto me according to your word Lord the word of God and the Holy Ghost moving on you is more powerful than your resistance if he's going to get you he's going to get you and he won't make you go against your will but he just makes you willing to go amen went against her own name to receive that she reached out of her rebellion and said I believe it I'm willing to Bear the approach and I'm willing to be laugh at you know it doesn't take long to go through your mind all that's going to happen now she's with Joseph engaged to him they haven't been together yet which is the way it's supposed to be by the way can I get an amen how many still believes the word of God they haven't been together that's why she could tell an angel an angel standing there say how can this be see and I haven't had sexual relations with Joseph that's the way it's supposed to be and so so so now she says that to him and she comes and she says be it unto me I'm willing to to Bear the reproach she's thinking I'll be laughed at people will not understand this but if God chose me then so be it I receive it in Jesus name whatever happens now whatever persecution whatever it takes I am with God be it unto me let the word and let this new life begin in me can you say praise the Lord that was a response from a girl that was supposed to be rebellious God knows how to take some of you young people God knows how to deal with your Rebellion you should you should submit a little early ear because you could go through a lot of things but he's got your number he's got your number and you keep resisting he knows how to deal with that when he does it just raise your hand and say thank you for loving me Lord if he did it to a Mary who had the nature of rebellion he can come to you something rose up and said I don't understand any of this but let it happen in me I don't have a clue of 90% of what Brother Paul's preaching but he's preaching the Holy Spirit and let it begin in me be it unto me according to what he's preaching let it be in my life not my parents not the preacher be it unto Mary said be that unto me personalize it at that moment she felt nothing but very soon after she felt changes very soon after she felt changes it changed her life and now she knew what he said was true because she was Chang changing heard a testimony a couple days ago is that now you start to see the results there's a change of desires there's a love for the word of God there's a incredible hunger for the word of God now it wasn't there before there's a change of my desires I don't desire the things of the world anymore but but the devil's still beating me up but listen now that's the evidences Something's Happened you can't see what's happened but you start to see the evidence Mary at that moment couldn't see what was conceived but it wasn't long she began to feel the baby kit she began to be it began to be pushed out in her life and she could see it's really happening it's in me Hallelujah she wanted to Proclaim it as she grew the changes began so great she could never ignore those changes now she could not hide it she couldn't H hide her she couldn't hide her belly anymore y'all are quiet tonight she couldn't hide her belly anymore and something happened to her and she couldn't hide anymore and she didn't want to hide it anymore she was standing on the word of God God had done something her and you could see something happen now the world's going to look and laugh at those changes hello the world's going to make fun of those changes and laugh at those changes but Mary rejoiced in it Elizabeth rejoiced in it it was so powerful that when Mary said hello Elizabeth God bless you a baby that was laying dormant in Elizabeth jumped up and come alive how many know you canect you can affect other people your Holy Ghost can trigger the holy ghost coming in someone else just her salutation and Elizabeth was praising the Lord with Mary you'll find people I was reading what the prophet said today he said Mary couldn't hang around she couldn't hang around where she was at in the town she was in because she knew she was going to be laughed at her and Joseph engaged she's pregnant it it's going to be a mark on her life so she needed to be around some people that would she could fellowship with so she left uh Nazareth and she went to see Elizabeth in another city for about six months because she needed to be around Fellowship that would encourage what the Lord was doing in her life you just keep hanging around the wrong crowd keep getting with the guys and the girls and the girls and all you keep hanging around the wrong ones they're not going to encourage you in the lord they're not going to encourage you to get the Holy Ghost they might even laugh at you if you cry and weep and get the Holy Ghost they may laugh at you you're so-called friends Mary had to get around people that were going to encourage her and not mock her oh boy we could preach more on that but listen now we're going to be brief tonight and so now we just want to finish this Mary she the changes begin to happen she could no longer be a secret Christian she could no longer be a secret Christian she did not want to hide it and she could not hide it she did not manufacture anything it was something inside and it begin to show on the outside that's the Holy Ghost working from the inside out I want you to see something now as we just bring this down and then we're going to read something we'll be finished tonight has anybody learned anything amen good so there was churches in that day of Mary that were meeting and talking about him coming there were those who had the Holy Ghost come and tell them that he was on his way so you you got a big uh environment of not only people were looking for the first coming and the Messiah to come they didn't know how he would come but they were still singing about it tons of churches waiting for the coming of the Lord singing about the coming of the Lord reading the the prophecies about the coming of the Lord we live in a day like that if you're listening online if you're listening to the broadcast we live in a day that we have tons of churches even within Christianity that are waiting and singing about and preaching about the coming of the Lord but I want to just be real straight with you when it happened in the first Advent when the first coming came most of the church World missed it because they were looking for it to be a certain way and God went around all all the churches and he was born in a manger could it be it would happen again could it be that the second coming of the Lord would sneak up on us and we wouldn't recognize the second coming of the Lord and how he's going to do it I just leave that question with you I I asked you to pray about it and consider it because in in Mary's day there was a lot of churches that were singing about the Messiah coming and when he came they didn't necessarily reject the Messiah they rejected the way that he came can I say that again could it happen again they didn't reject the Messiah they rejected the way that he came and so you got churches singing about it and then you have those who are being as the Holy Ghost comes down to that age and that time and everything becomes kind of uh I wouldn't say jittery but there's a there's a good nervousness in the air because God's ready to do something really big so he comes down and there were those that that God they had the Holy Ghost come to them and tell them that that he was coming or that he was there the Shepherds got a visitation from the angel Joseph got a visitation from the angel Zacharias got a visitation and incidentally from the same angel that went to Mary went to Zacharias they got visitations because the angel of the Lord Gabriel was present something was going to happen and I'm just bringing this Point again that when the Holy Ghost comes down he can do a lot of things he can anoint a lot of people he can do Mighty things but I want to tell you the reason he was there is to begin a new creation in a young girl and if the Holy Spirit shows up it's not just there to show off it's to fill you with the Holy Ghost can you say Amen if it's that way in the first coming where people would get as Zacharias has an angel come to him hey if we look at an angel of God is an angel messenger than we a lot of people know the angel messenger a lot of people know the prophet of this hour and a lot of people are affected by it but I can tell you there's only one little bride amongst all of this that's receiving the genuine word birth it's not because you go to all the camp meetings that you have the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost you'll go to someone because you want to go the word get the word of God and hear the word of God but just because you attend doesn't give you the Holy Ghost when God comes and begins to move then his intention is he he draws aside the angel meets with this one Angel and everybody knows so many know about the angel the messenger for the age I can tell you about the messenger for this age but do you know I was reading the scripture today I might speak on this another in another part of this I was reading this scripture about John the Baptist and it basically says I'm trying to remember the exact words now but it says John says I'm here to baptize you unto repentance but he that cometh after me praise the Lord after the messenger who has the spirit of Elijah there's somebody coming after him he said I'm just here to lead you to repentance I'm just here to of a baptism repent but when he comes after me he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so that tells me that just because you're in the message and just because you recognize the messenger doesn't mean you come to the one who was coming after the messenger to baptize you with Holy Ghost and Fire I'm here to bring repentance Elijah was always there to bring repentance first time to the children of Israel second time to John the Baptist I'm baptizing you under repentance can you say Amen uh uh Elisha excuse me the second was Elisha then John the Baptist then he uses it in the prophet and the last days the spirit of Elijah comes Malachi 45 and 6 and then he uses it again to the Jews but it's always preaching bringing the people into a certain way and to a certain altar this is the way you come and it's it's there's a lot of there's a lot of call for repentance there's a lot of call for you're living wrong you're you're dressing wrong you're not doing right here it's a c but the prophet doesn't give you the Holy Ghost believing the prophet isn't necessarily guaranteed he said he that comes after me will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire you got to go deeper can you say Amen praise the Lord so uh Mary now I was just trying to bring this down there was churches there were people receiving the Holy Ghost uh if you got your Bible open to Luke 1 verse 41 it says and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary The Babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost now not on her soul because Calvary hadn't come yet but she was feeling the effects of the Holy Ghost go over to me to verse 67 with me to verse 67 and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying goes into the prophecy of zachar he was filled with the Holy Ghost to prophesy did he did he have the same thing thing happen in him as Mary no but the same Holy Ghost was there to do that to Mary was the same Holy Ghost who was making somebody prophesy because why CU he's come down for the first coming he's come down this new creation he's affecting other people they're catching it amen so so uh if you would chapter 2 and verse 25 says about Simeon I love it and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he see the Lord's Christ it's the same time as as the Virgin Mary has the conception of God in her and here's a a Godly Man called Simeon and he gets a revelation of the Holy Ghost that he wouldn't die until he sees the Lord's Christ the Holy Ghost can do other things and speak to other people and still fulfill his complete purpose and he came and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in their child Jesus to do for you know the story he holds the child and Simon Says blessed them verse 34 and said unto Mary's mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against y a sword shall pierce through thy own soul that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and then the next scriptures is Anna who was also got to to see the word in its infancy they were they were old uh uh Simeon was old so he said Lord I Thank you that you've let me see and you fulfilled what you said that I can see the Messiah in its emphases the word in its infancy we have sever brothers and sisters that are passing away that helped launch this message and take it to the world and many are passing away now they seen the word in its infancy but there's some sitting here that's going to see it in its completion Holy Ghost is doing all this there's other places but I want you to see there he is he's working so much so that these people were filled the Bible said filled with the Holy Ghost notice not in their soul but on their Spirit the Holy Ghost can give such a strong baptism on a person's Spirit they can prophesy could not come into the soul yet until Jesus took his blood to provide for our sins our nature could not be changed until cleansing blood revers sin and wash that serpent nature out we've been preaching on that there's no way they had the Holy Ghost like to receive in the upper room but the Holy Ghost was there doing a work nonetheless and now Mary has a visitation from the angel the same angel that met with the other ones but the angel came with Mary with a with a a deeper word you're not just going to see the word as a baby in its infancy you're going to become the word they felt it it filled them in their Spirit but what happened to Mary was deeper I'm going to read a quote and I'm going to close but I can't help but think today my spirit just being a little troubled today and I've I've uh labored through this tonight because a lot of things are on my mind but could it be that even in the whole ranks of all that goes on in Christendom and even sometimes in in our own ranks around the world so many things can be done good and bad but we want to just look at the good done by the Holy Ghost poured out upon his people but could it be that there'll be a small number of Marys that really receive the true thing that this creation could be born in her quote says in Mary's belief he preached this three times in his wonderful message she looked at him the angel and he said Hail Mary blessed art thou among women thou art highly favored of God for God is with thee and he told what was going to happen that she was going to Bear a child and they should call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now she had a right to know that that was the kind she had a right to know that that was the kind the kind of a messenger first thing he was an angel standing there the next thing he told her who she was Mary she know that was a sign of God down through the age she looked him him and she said how can these things be seeing that I don't know a man and he said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee before Miracles can take place the Holy Ghost has to come that's what's the matter with the world today they're denying the power of the Holy Ghost that's why people can't believe in Divine Healing they're denying the very holy spirit that brings Divine Healing the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the most high shall overshadow thee and that Holy thing which will be born of thee shall be called The Son of God that's how he's coming you don't need to know no man God's going to do this and now he's referring to the second coming now for with God I believe it's for both comings he's talking to Mary here and then he says for with God nothing is impossible oh what that little lady had to believe she had to believe something that was impossible she had to believe something that had never happened Hannah when she was told by the priest the Lord give thee thy desire why she went home in nine months she brought the child that was wonderful but see and so Elizabeth and he said the cousin Elizabeth which was called Baron is already six months to be mother and told her that with told her that with God nothing was impossible and she said behold the handmade of the Lord Mary said this be it unto me according to Thy word what she had to believe something had never happened Zacharias the priest the husband of her cousin he doubted that same Angel just stop right there the same Angel come and told Zacharias what was going to go on with him to have a child and he said he doubted it blind God blinded his eyes this is the same Angel same Angel visiting other people but then the the angel comes to Mary he got the right response be it done if Zacharias would have said all right be it unto me according to thy but his first response wasn't that and so we find that he would go home and live with his wife Elizabeth and she'd bring a son and he said I'm too old it can't be done oh he just doubted it and he had Abraham and Sarah to look at he had Hannah in the temple and Eli her husband to think of but that callous priest doubted God's word he's referring to Abraham and Sarah go back he's referring to Abraham and Sarah he's referring to Hannah in the Old Testament Zachariah should have known that in the Bible people were Barren and God supernaturally opened up the womb of all people Zacharias the priest should have known that but when it come to him he doubted it and that was the same angel that was meeting with Mary so we really learned something Zacharias the priest and so the thing of but that callous priest doubted God's word next one sorry but a brother shiran said the other day over in the island when I saw my mother-in-law die five days before it happened and my brother-in-law have a hemorrhage and spit blood out of his mouth just spurted it from his mouth brother uh sonore said let us go in and pray that this won't happen and I said I won't do one bit of good God has already said it it's got to happen God when he says anything it's impossible for for it not to happen therefore When God says in the book all things are possible to them that believe it's got to happen no how many believe this these things don't let your mind fig just he just wants us to be like Mary you try to figure out why why he's saying all things are possible then that believe When God says that then we believe it that's our job to believe it we trying no way to explain it you can believe God will perform every promise that he made then when she never waited little Mary didn't now she had to believe something that had never happened but look at her little childish heart I'm going to think of her just to be a young woman maybe about 18 20 years old she never taken the second thought as soon as she seen and know that was the angel of the Lord that know these things and told her exactly according to the scripture she had been thinking on and told her her name and she know that messenger come from God the first thing Mary recognized this messenger has come from God pretty important the messenger has come from God next one and the scripture said that she had been thinking on what confirmed right there to her Mary the Holy Ghost will come upon you and the almighty shall overshadow thee and that Holy thing that'll be born will not be of man but he will be called The Son of God she threw her little hands up and the tears running down those beautiful eyes see she was emotional what happened in the inside she couldn't see but she was emotional tears running out of those beautiful eyes said behold the man handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word she didn't wait till she was positive of of this she didn't wait till she felt life or some kind of a sensation to prove that was she was to be a mother I've always loved these points I've preached them for years out of this message especially to young people I have a little message I preach why little Mary brother Brown preached why little Bethlehem why was it Shepherds and I preached why little Mary of all people but I like this quote out of it right here she didn't wait till she was positive of this she didn't wait until she felt life or some kind of sensation to prove that she was to be a mother she just took his word and that was enough that's what God wants you to do tonight not wait till you feel better not wait till you can move your hand better or walk a good step not wait till the doctor says you're improving but take God at his word and begin to believe it that's the only place way to please him take his word that's the way Miracles are performed when God is took by his word The Impossibles Are Made Real when when God has took as at his word not questioned just get that out of your mind behold the Hing of the Lord why she was so happy about it she just couldn't stand still and nothing had showed up yet but she knew it was going to if we could have more people craving for the holy spirit in their life like Mary was I believe your word I believe it's for me but I'm not going to wait for some sensation I'm going to believe you're going to do it in me anyway amen I'm not waiting for something for you to do necessarily and then that's a confirmation somehow that that no no she said I believe it let me finish it out here Brothers he said the handmade of the Lord behold that why was she so happy about she just couldn't stand still and nothing had showed up yet but she knew it was going to because God said so praise be to God angel visited other ones a lot of people in that time didn't know the angel but some the angel came to a lot of people know the the angel messenger of this hour but there's only one young girl there's only one bride okay I want to be one of them I want him to visit me not just to give me a feeling I want him to visit me that something is conceived on the inside something is born here amen I'm all done praise the Lord let's give God praise amen that's when you say let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and molded every day let your word be bor in the manger of little bit higher let's stand and sing it would you let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it stop live inside this house of clay and mold it every day oh let you word oh yes Lord
