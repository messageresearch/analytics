[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] heavenly father we thank you very much
[0:10] for the wonderful atmosphere that
[0:13] is here lord you're so worthy of praise
[0:17] [Music]
[0:30] [Music]
[0:43] service real real great spirit of
[0:45] worship appreciate that love
[0:47] and i guess i thank everybody for
[0:49] getting out of our comfort zone sitting
[0:50] in a different spot in church
[0:53] and that is a real sacrifice
[0:56] my goodness oh my goodness let's just
[0:58] see if i can get this
[1:00] going here
[1:01] very good
[1:04] oh good
[1:05] well uh
[1:07] just wanted to
[1:09] this last last year we took a series
[1:12] through the
[1:12] to the adult sunday school class on the
[1:15] church age book
[1:17] and
[1:18] i it was probably the greatest blessing
[1:20] to me
[1:21] going through the class myself and i
[1:23] hadn't read the read the book for for
[1:26] years you know i think the it's probably
[1:28] the first the first the feed the the
[1:30] first couple chapters of the books
[1:32] probably the most frequently read
[1:33] chapters because you you you start the
[1:36] year i'm going to get into the to the
[1:38] message more in
[1:39] january one you start reading then you
[1:41] make it through page 40 50 and things
[1:43] come again and next you can try the same
[1:45] so we get through the first chapter
[1:47] quite quite quite a bit but i really
[1:49] enjoyed um
[1:50] making going through the going through
[1:52] the entire book over the course of the
[1:53] year
[1:54] and no
[1:56] probably a lot of us have grown up in
[1:58] the message or been around the message
[2:01] for a long time i was
[2:03] raised in the message
[2:05] and i can remember as you
[2:07] get your teenage years you're kind of
[2:08] wondering yeah i want to start reading
[2:10] it but you all walk into the parents
[2:12] bedroom and it's just like
[2:14] books over shelf upon shelf upon shop
[2:17] like
[2:18] where do i start
[2:20] and i don't think that's the problem
[2:23] that other older generations might not
[2:25] have had that because there weren't so
[2:26] many books available then so you would
[2:29] just get books every every month from
[2:31] from jeffersonville and it wasn't really
[2:33] a big choice which book you read because
[2:35] that was the one you hadn't read yet so
[2:37] you read that
[2:38] and
[2:39] i just um i just wonder
[2:42] my my burden this evening is that if we
[2:45] haven't gotten into the message much
[2:47] ourselves
[2:48] that we just uh take some time and make
[2:51] that a priority because
[2:54] god did send it for a purpose
[2:57] and i can just testify for myself i i
[3:00] can be spending time reading the bible
[3:03] and and
[3:04] and in prayer but in times of drought in
[3:07] my life
[3:08] it's been sometimes that drought has
[3:10] been quenched when i went and gotten to
[3:12] the message more because that's
[3:14] something that god has opened
[3:17] for us to put pieces together and i just
[3:20] encourage you my my burden this evening
[3:22] is that folks my age folks young folks
[3:25] any age if we haven't made that a
[3:27] priority
[3:28] to spend some time doing that that's
[3:30] just that's really what's on my heart
[3:32] and uh
[3:33] my um
[3:34] it's kind of a little bit intimidating
[3:36] for me doing a session like this because
[3:38] yeah you're going to have the brother
[3:39] brother's going to come and teach on the
[3:41] church age book well i'm not the answer
[3:42] man so don't uh i don't think that of
[3:45] myself and don't don't think that of me
[3:47] either
[3:48] at the same time
[3:50] if we uh if as we're going along brother
[3:53] paul said we can structure this a little
[3:54] bit differently
[3:55] if i've been unclear in some way or if a
[3:57] question pops up i'm fine with a hand
[4:00] popping up
[4:01] you might get an i don't know from me
[4:03] but at least we've been honest with
[4:05] ourselves and and asked a question i
[4:08] think there's great value in asking
[4:10] questions
[4:11] because sometimes the devil likes to
[4:13] muzzle us and say you can't ask a
[4:15] question because oh if you ask a
[4:16] question i think oh boy
[4:18] she doesn't believe the message anymore
[4:19] because they've got a question that's
[4:21] not the case at all and there's one one
[4:23] scripture that actually this the setting
[4:26] comes up two times but in exodus chapter
[4:29] 12.
[4:30] i just want to suggest that sometimes
[4:33] god does things
[4:34] purposefully so that we will have
[4:37] questions
[4:38] and i don't think questions are a thing
[4:40] to be run from uh questions might be a
[4:43] god-ordained opportunity to get an
[4:45] answer
[4:46] and in exodus chapter 12
[4:48] moses is setting out the pattern for how
[4:52] the passover is going to be celebrated
[4:54] he gives all kinds of
[4:56] details and this is not a
[4:58] the evening the passover is being
[5:00] instituted is not a quiet evening
[5:02] everybody is packing they're getting
[5:04] things ready that night they're going to
[5:05] be leaving egypt so they have to
[5:08] listen to moses once and
[5:10] catch it as he's going as fast as he can
[5:12] go but in exodus chapter 12 and verse 26
[5:16] uh 25
[5:18] uh 24. the minister always goes all the
[5:21] way back to catch the context right
[5:23] verse 24 ye shall observe this thing for
[5:26] an ordinance to thee and to thy sons
[5:28] forever the passover and it shall come
[5:30] to pass when ye become to the land which
[5:32] the lord will give you according as he
[5:34] hath promised that ye shall keep this
[5:36] service and it shall come to pass
[5:40] when your children shall say unto you
[5:42] what mean ye by the service
[5:45] so it's not a
[5:46] it's not a question of if there will be
[5:48] questions it's a question there will be
[5:51] questions god is doing this in such a
[5:53] way so that there will be questions
[5:55] later on because questions are are an
[5:57] opportunity for parents to explain to
[6:00] their kids why are we doing what we're
[6:02] doing so if you've got a question in
[6:03] your life that might be something that
[6:05] god's put on his calendar and on your
[6:06] calendar for you to learn something more
[6:08] of him so don't run from questions
[6:11] don't think oh i'm not going to read the
[6:12] church book i'm not going to read a
[6:13] message because i'm not going to get it
[6:15] issue i don't understand much at all
[6:17] no go into it because if you don't have
[6:19] if you have a question ask the question
[6:21] that's just uh that's just my real uh
[6:24] real burden sometimes we can be
[6:26] intimidated i'll raise my hand there by
[6:28] some of the teaching series is that
[6:30] brother branham says because they have a
[6:31] reputation for being deep oh i won't
[6:34] have a chance of getting that anyway and
[6:36] that we can dissuade ourselves or even
[6:38] starting to read or to listen because we
[6:41] figured wouldn't understand anything
[6:42] anyhow
[6:43] but i just want to
[6:45] it's interesting in some of those
[6:47] messages that have this reputation for
[6:48] being deep if you look and take a take a
[6:52] read or listen through his introductory
[6:54] prayer
[6:56] there you can capture the simplicity of
[6:59] his desire what he wants to bring it
[7:01] with and on page one of our notes i have
[7:04] his introductory prayer for the
[7:06] revelation of jesus christ series and
[7:09] the church age book came out first as a
[7:12] series of sermons preached in 1960 and
[7:14] then that was in december of 1960 and
[7:17] later brother branham
[7:18] asked for the veil to help put that into
[7:20] uh book form
[7:22] but in the if you if you listen to the
[7:24] series this is this is opening his
[7:25] opening prayer
[7:27] and i love this first line he says may
[7:28] we all not just take this as a lecture
[7:32] because sometimes when you go until this
[7:33] is going to be a teaching service it's
[7:35] not just a lecture brother branham
[7:37] didn't intend it to be a lecture that's
[7:38] not what it was but may we solemnly
[7:41] solemnly take the warnings of the holy
[7:43] spirit and pray day and night don't let
[7:46] nothing stop you from praying so this
[7:48] this teaching it's not less spiritual by
[7:50] any means it's helping us to see the day
[7:53] that we're living in so that we can live
[7:55] in that day correctly
[7:57] now just in respects before we open the
[7:59] book i'd like for all of us who can just
[8:02] to stand for a moment for prayer with
[8:03] the sincerity of your heart breathe a
[8:05] word of prayer to god and he praised
[8:07] lord god the creator of the heavens and
[8:09] earth
[8:10] the author of everlasting life the giver
[8:12] of all good and perfect gifts
[8:14] we would ask you lord first forgive us
[8:16] of all our indifferences and our sins
[8:19] and our trespasses against thee and
[8:21] against one another and our fellow man
[8:23] may this little time of coming together
[8:26] not only be for the edifying of our own
[8:28] souls
[8:29] but may it be to enlighten us in such a
[8:32] way and inspire us till we'll go tell
[8:34] others i just like that he's not saying
[8:37] that we can get more and more he doesn't
[8:38] say it so we'll get more revelation so
[8:39] we'll get so we'll get more knowledge he
[8:41] doesn't say that but so that we can be
[8:44] edified for our own souls and be
[8:46] enlightened so that we'll be inspired to
[8:48] tell others
[8:50] what is it that often prevents us from
[8:52] telling others about what we believe
[8:55] i'd suggest a lot of times
[8:57] because we're not exactly sure what it
[8:59] is either and we're afraid of a question
[9:02] sometimes so as we're being taught what
[9:05] the bible says about these various
[9:07] topics that we can put roots down and
[9:09] then we will be inspired to share what
[9:11] we believe because our questions are
[9:12] answered and our uncertainties might be
[9:14] taken away
[9:15] and then he says may this also be a time
[9:17] of rededication uniting with the full
[9:20] body of christ and being ready for the
[9:22] rapture and i just really appreciated
[9:25] the simplicity of his heart but
[9:27] sometimes we can skip over everything oh
[9:29] we're going to go through a deep service
[9:30] to the book of revelation don't lose the
[9:32] simplicity of the heart i really
[9:34] appreciate that because god's in us god
[9:37] did not send us a theologian as a
[9:38] seventh church h messenger he didn't
[9:40] send us that he sent us a prophet and
[9:43] that helped us capture the heart of god
[9:47] and
[9:48] this evening sermon i don't intend for
[9:50] it to um where there's going to be a
[9:53] church age 101
[9:55] kind of introduction to the very first
[9:57] chapter and my goal is to kind of hit
[10:00] the hit the highlights of the first
[10:02] chapter so that when you go through it
[10:04] you're
[10:04] when you go through it yourself you'll
[10:06] kind of know which way he's heading
[10:08] already and i hope to be able to answer
[10:11] uh maybe five questions and that's the
[10:13] five w's who what when where and why
[10:17] that's what we're going to try to shoot
[10:19] for this evening
[10:21] to do that let's open up in our bibles
[10:23] to revelation chapter one and we're just
[10:24] going to take a look at the first three
[10:27] verses this evening
[10:38] revelation chapter 1
[10:41] verse 1.
[10:44] it says the revelation of jesus christ
[10:48] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[10:50] servants things which must shortly come
[10:52] to pass
[10:54] and he sent and signified it by his
[10:56] angel
[10:57] unto his servant john which john is it's
[11:00] this john who bear record of the word of
[11:02] god and of the testimony of jesus christ
[11:04] all the things that he saw this is john
[11:06] the beloved who wrote the gospel wrote
[11:08] the three epistles and in these first
[11:10] two verses we can answer
[11:12] our first question who
[11:15] who's involved right here in the book as
[11:17] we're getting started well the it's
[11:18] jesus christ is the author
[11:21] and it's interesting if you look at the
[11:22] very top of your
[11:24] chapter heading for for the book of
[11:26] revelation different bibles will say it
[11:28] different ways my bible says the
[11:31] revelation of saint john the divine
[11:34] and brother branham goes to great pains
[11:35] in the church age book said no this is
[11:37] not a revelation of john
[11:39] it's the revelation of jesus christ
[11:43] it's not it's doesn't have john's
[11:45] fingerprints on it at all and later well
[11:47] brother branham goes on and says if you
[11:49] were to all that john is is the scribe
[11:52] that's right if you were to contrast the
[11:54] writing style in the book of revelation
[11:56] with the writing style in the book of
[11:58] john or the book of first john 2nd john
[12:01] 3 john it's completely different
[12:05] this book of revelation is only written
[12:07] by the hand of john but it is the
[12:09] thoughts
[12:10] of jesus christ coming out there jesus
[12:12] is the author
[12:13] john's the scribe
[12:15] the interesting part here is in verse
[12:19] the in the end of verse 1
[12:22] he sent and signified it by his angel
[12:24] unto his servant john and there's a
[12:27] third person that we should take a look
[12:30] at here and this is this angel
[12:33] jesus christ is revealing something is
[12:35] revealing him something about himself to
[12:38] john and how is he doing this he's using
[12:41] an angel to do it well
[12:44] what is an angel we've all got some kind
[12:47] of conception in our minds what an angel
[12:50] might be we might see it on the hallmark
[12:51] gift cards with the cupid uh
[12:54] shooting his error with the wings on his
[12:56] back that's one perception of of an
[12:58] angel and of course you have heavenly
[13:00] angels
[13:01] gabriel came down and gave a message to
[13:05] give message to zacharias gave a message
[13:07] to to mary
[13:09] but we shouldn't limit our perception of
[13:11] angels just to those heavenly angels
[13:15] and we should definitely limit it to
[13:16] cupid
[13:18] but an angel all an angel is is a
[13:20] messenger
[13:23] if we take a look in um
[13:25] malachi chapter three let's i don't have
[13:28] this on the side malachi chapter three
[13:31] and we're going to take a look at how
[13:33] the old testament writes something and
[13:35] how the new testament
[13:39] translates it
[13:41] malachi 3 1
[13:43] this is speaking of john the baptist
[13:45] behold i will send my messenger and he
[13:48] shall prepare the way before me my
[13:51] messenger here the forerunner is john
[13:53] the baptist
[13:54] now this is written in in hebrew in the
[13:56] original language well the new testament
[13:59] books the gospels might be written in
[14:01] aramaic our english translation is based
[14:03] on the greek manuscript well when we
[14:06] look at the book of mark when mark
[14:08] quotes malachi chapter 3
[14:11] mark writes as it's written in the
[14:12] prophets in malachi behold i send my
[14:15] messenger well what's the greek word
[14:17] that he uses for messenger it's the word
[14:19] agulos that's the same word for angel
[14:22] the translator put the mess the word
[14:24] messenger there instead of angel but
[14:26] they're
[14:27] it's the same greek word
[14:29] so you could say behold i send my angel
[14:32] john the baptist and he'll prepare the
[14:34] way before me john was
[14:36] an angel in the old testament perception
[14:38] of it so we can't limit our perception
[14:41] of what an angel is just to a heavenly
[14:43] messenger that's sent from the realm of
[14:44] god right to us
[14:47] god uses much more than just that
[14:50] and in the book of james
[14:52] james reference the story of joshua's
[14:55] spies going to visit rahab the harlot
[14:57] and he says likewise wasn't that rahab
[14:59] also justified by works when she had
[15:02] received the aguilos when she had
[15:04] received the the angels
[15:06] and they sent them out another way these
[15:08] were
[15:09] angels sir these were messengers they
[15:11] were bringing deliverance a message of
[15:14] deliverance message of redemption to
[15:15] rahab and they're called
[15:18] angels
[15:19] it's that same word in the greek text
[15:22] and it's just interesting when we look
[15:23] through the book of revelation we're
[15:24] going to see the word angel
[15:26] used many times
[15:28] sometimes it will be referring to a
[15:30] heavenly messenger sent from right from
[15:33] the throne of god
[15:34] but we shouldn't limit ourself to that
[15:37] perception because there'll be many
[15:39] times in the book of revelation where
[15:41] it's an earthly man
[15:43] looks just like us he's just a regular
[15:45] human being and god says that guy right
[15:47] there he's my
[15:49] angel
[15:50] and he's setting up this very same
[15:52] pattern right in verse 1 revealing this
[15:55] whole thing to john the revelator he's
[15:58] using a human being how do we know that
[16:01] well we see this angel come up in
[16:03] revelation chapter 1
[16:05] and verse 1 and also in revelation 22 at
[16:08] the end of this whole at this whole this
[16:10] whole drama this whole prophecy all
[16:12] these series of visions that john has
[16:14] been allowed to see
[16:16] john is just so overcome in revelation
[16:18] 22 verses 8 and 9
[16:21] as i john saw these things and heard
[16:24] them and when i had heard and seen i
[16:26] fell down to worship before the feet of
[16:28] the angel which had showed me these
[16:31] things
[16:33] if this angel had been the angel of the
[16:35] lord or had been christ he would have
[16:37] accepted john's worship
[16:40] he doesn't accept the worship of john he
[16:42] says unto me see thou do it not for i am
[16:45] thy fellow servant i am one that i am of
[16:47] thy brethren the prophets of them which
[16:50] keep the sayings of this book so god
[16:52] starts this whole thing oh how the
[16:54] gentile dispensations opened up this
[16:57] whole this new testament age with church
[16:59] ages god starts the whole thing out with
[17:02] an earthly messenger and john's wanting
[17:05] to worship and exalt him to be above
[17:06] that no but i'm just your fellow
[17:08] brethren your your fellow servant of
[17:10] your brethren the prophets i think
[17:12] that's important
[17:14] because
[17:15] this sets a pattern for how god's going
[17:17] to be giving his revelation out
[17:19] throughout the throughout the couple
[17:21] thousand years up to the present the
[17:23] first messenger the first angel sent to
[17:26] john was an earthly messenger and then
[17:30] this can actually continue as an old
[17:32] testament pattern because whenever um
[17:34] the angel of the lord would come and
[17:36] speak to uh
[17:37] yeah
[17:38] to gideon or to manoa or to a different
[17:41] one so noah's wife rather they he came
[17:44] as looked like a regular human being
[17:46] that's how god works and he's continuing
[17:49] that we like to say old testament new
[17:51] testament there might be more continuity
[17:53] than we think sometimes how god works
[17:56] but this
[17:57] that god speaks to this angel to his
[17:58] servant john it signifies that god
[18:00] continues this pattern
[18:02] in the new testament period and
[18:04] specifically what we'll call in the
[18:06] coming
[18:07] months in the in the in the church ages
[18:10] that make sense yes very good um
[18:15] so that hopefully answers our who
[18:17] question who's who who's involved here
[18:19] at the very beginning anyway we have the
[18:20] author of jesus christ the scribe john
[18:23] and then this angel sent to john who's
[18:25] the messenger and what's also really
[18:27] important is that this is a book of
[18:30] prophecy some some theologians will say
[18:32] that the book of revelation all these
[18:34] letters are sent the first couple
[18:36] chapters especially are just sent to
[18:39] local churches in asia minor and for
[18:42] pastors at that particular time to deal
[18:44] with problems in that particular first
[18:46] century church but at the very beginning
[18:48] here
[18:49] john
[18:51] clarifies that or jesus clarifies that
[18:53] forest is verse 3 blessed is he that
[18:56] readeth and they that hear the words of
[18:58] this
[18:59] prophecy and keep those things that
[19:01] you're written therein for the time as a
[19:03] hand so the book of revelation much of
[19:05] it pertains to the future
[19:07] a lot of it does not pertain to events
[19:10] going around at john's time period
[19:13] it's a book of prophecy and that's why
[19:14] we have i believe we have every liberty
[19:17] to believe that brother branham says
[19:18] that
[19:19] the seven church ages that's prophetic
[19:22] of conditions that will be prevailing in
[19:24] the gentile period in the ages to come
[19:26] because it is a book of prophecy
[19:28] the book's also rich in symbols like all
[19:31] the old testament books of the prophets
[19:33] and this is appropriate because it the
[19:35] book is a book of revelation in order to
[19:37] get it we need we're very dependent upon
[19:41] god to unlock the meaning of these
[19:43] particular symbols
[19:46] now here have we a picture of asia minor
[19:49] this is the the seven churches they're
[19:51] approximate locations
[19:53] and brother branham says
[19:56] here that this book of revelation these
[19:58] uh what john's writing here it's
[20:00] directed to those seven churches in
[20:02] chapters two and three and he says there
[20:04] were more churches than those seven at
[20:06] that day but each one of those churches
[20:09] had a characteristic in it that would
[20:11] appear again in the ages to come and
[20:13] that's the purpose of what we're going
[20:15] through in the church age book to look
[20:17] at each of these time periods you'll
[20:20] have well you'll you'll see trends
[20:22] things that they struggle with things
[20:24] that they're doing well that are also
[20:26] cat that that are also found in that
[20:29] local church of ephesus the local church
[20:30] of smyrna the local church of pergamus
[20:32] those conditions can be found also in in
[20:36] future churches
[20:40] and that's why at the bottom of page two
[20:42] brother branham saying that this book of
[20:44] revelation is not the story of john's
[20:46] life but it's the story of christ in
[20:48] future ages it is a prophecy it's not
[20:51] the life of john
[20:52] it's not the life even of christ but
[20:55] it's prophesying of an age to come
[21:01] amen
[21:03] so why is the booklet why is revelation
[21:06] so important and it's not just the book
[21:08] of revelation although it does say in
[21:10] verse three just reading um through the
[21:12] book and hearing it as we are that
[21:15] carries a blessing with itself but why
[21:17] is revelation itself
[21:19] so important
[21:21] now when i was at
[21:22] at college i attended a small school
[21:25] down in springfield ohio i lived on
[21:27] campus there and i'd come back home over
[21:30] the weekends to uh to go to service and
[21:32] oftentimes uh midweek i'd go over to a
[21:34] brother sieverts there in in dayton
[21:37] and i can remember coming back on
[21:38] wednesday night one of my
[21:41] friends there on
[21:42] there in the dorm his uh his question
[21:45] off of me when i came back would be so
[21:48] what did you learn at church today i
[21:49] think
[21:50] what did i learn at church i don't know
[21:53] what i
[21:53] learned at church today because
[21:56] i don't really
[21:57] go to church to learn some new something
[22:00] new i just i haven't really thought
[22:02] about that being
[22:04] the reason why i go to church
[22:06] but
[22:08] it kind of made me think
[22:10] we go not so much to church for
[22:12] information but more for
[22:15] for revelations we see more in god's
[22:17] heart he can speak to us it's not to
[22:19] learn something new necessarily but so
[22:23] we can know someone better and that's
[22:26] what a lot of what revelation is is
[22:29] concerned with
[22:31] now um a lot of times we can think oh i
[22:34] have so little revelation because i
[22:36] understand so little when i hear a
[22:38] message going is a lot of it goes right
[22:40] over my head i have no hope to get much
[22:43] revelation because i didn't learn
[22:45] anything at church tonight i i
[22:46] misunderstood most of it probably
[22:48] i want to go back and think about
[22:51] i'd like this passage from matthew 13.
[22:54] this is where jesus is telling the the
[22:57] mysteries of the kingdom and at the
[22:59] beginning of this jesus speaks to his
[23:01] disciples and he says blessed are your
[23:04] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[23:07] hear
[23:08] wow these guys they can see they can
[23:11] hear they understand they get it
[23:15] but
[23:16] if you finish if you continue reading
[23:18] the chapter they probably when jesus
[23:20] says it says amen we're the ones we've
[23:22] got we've got the best understanding we
[23:24] can see this but after jesus's sermon
[23:27] he dismisses everybody else and then
[23:30] they ask the disciples they're just by
[23:32] they're just alone with jesus is it
[23:33] jesus
[23:34] please explain the parable to us because
[23:37] we didn't get it but i said but wait he
[23:40] just said blessed are your eyes for you
[23:42] see in your ears for they hear but
[23:45] they didn't see it they they they had
[23:47] they saw but they didn't see and they
[23:48] heard but they didn't hear
[23:50] what's up with that
[23:52] and i think sometimes we might not
[23:54] understand everything but it's a
[23:56] wonderful revelation to understand that
[23:58] there is something to be understood
[24:01] how many of you see one of those
[24:02] pictures you know there's something in
[24:03] there if you look long enough you'll see
[24:06] you'll see this the picture in the
[24:07] picture and it just kind of transfixes
[24:09] you and you just can't get your eyes
[24:10] away from because you see there's
[24:12] something to be seen
[24:13] and that's i think how it was with the
[24:15] mysteries of the kingdom and the
[24:16] disciples
[24:17] they were listening and listening and
[24:19] listening a lot of people would be
[24:20] listening i can't get anywhere they just
[24:22] walk away
[24:23] they didn't have eyes to see your ears
[24:25] to hear but the disciples they didn't
[24:28] get it either
[24:29] but they didn't walk away because they
[24:32] saw there was something to see and they
[24:34] wouldn't leave until they saw it until
[24:37] god anointed their eyes and they
[24:39] they wouldn't go away from that so
[24:41] revelation doesn't mean you understand
[24:44] everything
[24:45] revelation understands you know where to
[24:47] go to get the understanding that's the
[24:50] important thing and i just love what
[24:51] brother paul had to share last sunday
[24:54] the message here it's not some new
[24:56] doctrine it's not some new thing it's
[24:58] grace grace grace because we need
[25:00] what it has to offer and we might i
[25:02] don't understand a lot of things but i
[25:04] understand this is the source that's
[25:06] where i need to go for it
[25:08] so revelation is just knowing where to
[25:10] go
[25:11] similar to how jesus said in matthew 5 6
[25:14] blessed are they which you hunger and
[25:16] thirst after righteousness for they
[25:18] shall be filled brother branham says
[25:21] you're just blessed for hungering
[25:23] having that hunger
[25:25] carries a blessing with it as well so if
[25:27] you don't understand everything that's
[25:28] fine you're still blessed because you
[25:30] want to understand you have that desire
[25:32] for it because there's a desire that's
[25:34] going to be met somehow
[25:35] absolutely
[25:38] now brother branham takes a lot of the a
[25:40] lot of the material that he covers at
[25:42] the first part of chapter one
[25:45] is um he's speaking from matthew chapter
[25:47] 16.
[25:49] and here again we've talked about
[25:51] questions
[25:52] jesus asks peter a question ask the
[25:54] disciples a question
[25:55] who do men say that i am
[25:58] and then so questions aren't a bad thing
[26:00] here
[26:01] but and then peter gives this answer
[26:03] that you are the christ and jesus
[26:05] answered and said unto him blessed art
[26:07] thou simon bar
[26:09] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[26:11] this unto you but my father which is in
[26:14] heaven and i say unto you that thou art
[26:16] peter and upon this rock
[26:18] i will build my church
[26:21] and brother branham uses this text to
[26:23] show how foundational uh how revelation
[26:27] itself is of great foundational
[26:29] importance
[26:31] and here you have the statue of moses
[26:33] there
[26:34] there in
[26:35] rome as michelangelo is working on he
[26:37] catches it just becomes so real to him
[26:39] that he smites it that's revelation has
[26:41] to do with something becoming
[26:43] real to you that's why i like that there
[26:46] brother branham says the importance of
[26:47] revelation by the spirit to a true
[26:50] believer can never be overemphasized
[26:54] revelation means more you than perhaps
[26:55] you realize i'm not talking just about
[26:57] this book of revelation i'm talking
[26:59] about all revelation it's tremendously
[27:02] important to the church
[27:03] why
[27:04] it's because that's a that's a personal
[27:06] connection god's god's showing it to you
[27:09] personally i mean you can go back and
[27:12] i try to work
[27:14] you can try to explain a math problem
[27:15] with somebody math facts everything like
[27:17] that and they they can spit them out
[27:19] they might have haven't memorized when
[27:21] they have to go do a word problem you
[27:22] will tell do they have the revelation
[27:24] that four and four times five is twenty
[27:26] they might not get it once they change
[27:28] but once it's become personally known to
[27:30] you it doesn't matter how the problem
[27:31] changes you've got it because it's
[27:34] become a part of who you are
[27:37] now brother branham talks about this
[27:38] particular text upon this rock i'll
[27:40] build my church
[27:41] and he asks the question on what is the
[27:44] true church built
[27:46] and this is on the
[27:48] um well i'm quoting i'm showing page
[27:50] numbers here i'm using the the new
[27:52] pagination of the church age book which
[27:54] you can actually get in the library
[27:55] we've got a box of them back there
[27:57] um
[27:58] what is the true church built on now the
[28:00] roman catholics say that the church is
[28:02] built upon peter and he says that's
[28:04] really carnal how could you build the
[28:06] church upon a man so unstable that he
[28:08] denied the lord and cursed while doing
[28:10] it
[28:11] god can't build his church upon any man
[28:13] born in sin and it wasn't some rock
[28:16] lying there that that was as though god
[28:18] had hallowed the ground at that spot
[28:21] and this is a little bit odd
[28:23] counterintuitive perhaps and it isn't as
[28:26] the protestants say that the church is
[28:28] built upon jesus
[28:30] now why is that well
[28:33] james 2 19 says the devils also believe
[28:35] in tremble
[28:36] it's not just built upon
[28:39] jesus it's just a small difference
[28:41] it was the revelation jesus isn't saying
[28:43] that hey guys the church is built upon
[28:45] me right now that's right any time that
[28:47] peter
[28:48] got going in that direction saying let's
[28:50] build a special tabernacle for him or
[28:52] keeping the lord from going off and and
[28:55] offering himself in jerusalem don't do
[28:56] that lord get thee behind me said you've
[28:59] missed it you've missed it it's not just
[29:01] built upon
[29:03] me
[29:04] but it's built upon the revelation
[29:06] of
[29:07] of me
[29:08] that's important it was the revelation
[29:10] flesh and blood has not revealed it but
[29:12] my father hath revealed it upon this
[29:15] rock
[29:16] revelation i will build my church
[29:19] the church is built upon
[29:21] revelation
[29:22] on the set lord that doesn't discount at
[29:25] all what what jesus is jesus christ is
[29:28] absolutely foundational to the church
[29:31] but jesus is speaking to peter he's not
[29:33] saying he would build the church on
[29:35] himself it's much deeper here
[29:37] it's on revelation of personal knowledge
[29:40] a personal revelation of
[29:42] who jesus is and it's like the um
[29:46] the devils have that revelation it's
[29:47] oftentimes demon-possessed people
[29:49] recognize who jesus was who paul was
[29:52] before religious leaders ever did the
[29:54] church is built upon the revelation
[29:57] of who jesus is
[29:59] why is it though that revelation is so
[30:02] important brother branham starts this
[30:04] topic at the beginning of chapter one
[30:06] and he kind of and he goes and talks
[30:08] about water baptism he talks about the
[30:10] godhead and at the end of chapter 1 he
[30:12] kind of comes back to it he says he
[30:15] starts talking about how back in the
[30:17] second or third century it's like the
[30:19] whole world was divided by what one
[30:21] group of people thought a particular
[30:23] diphthong met another group of people
[30:25] thought this and they they didn't agree
[30:26] and it was all about the the definitions
[30:28] of of greek words no that's not it it's
[30:31] not based upon human learning it's based
[30:34] upon the revelation of it all
[30:36] that's interesting going back and kind
[30:38] of looking at this why is revelation so
[30:40] important it's by revelation that we see
[30:43] who god actually is
[30:45] who we are
[30:47] and also
[30:48] where we are where are we in god's
[30:51] plan
[30:53] now last year i was um
[30:55] uh two years ago actually i was with my
[30:57] family in the netherlands and we're
[30:59] going back there this spring we're going
[31:01] this is a picture from google maps of a
[31:03] particular area we'll be going and
[31:05] staying for about a week
[31:06] and one afternoon my son had just we
[31:08] visited the uh he's gotten a little army
[31:11] tank and things we're gonna go play
[31:12] soldiers in in the woods
[31:15] it's actually a pretty big woods so we
[31:17] go with uh we go hiking in there and
[31:19] just the two of us and we're having a
[31:21] great time he's playing with his tanks
[31:22] airplanes and all that stuff fun stuff
[31:24] and
[31:26] we go hiking hiking hiking the further
[31:28] we go we just keep following one path
[31:31] then another path another path and after
[31:33] a while i think man i've been gone for
[31:34] two hours
[31:36] i hope i can get back in time because
[31:38] it's going to be about time pretty soon
[31:40] and i want to keep this little guy going
[31:42] not so little anymore but
[31:44] let's go job we're going to see if we
[31:45] can find it i got to realize
[31:47] i've gotten turned around and i'm not
[31:50] really sure how i'm going to get back
[31:55] so yeah what am i going to do there in
[31:56] the middle of the wilderness well
[31:58] fortunately i had my
[32:00] my smartphone with me and unfortunately
[32:02] i already downloaded the google map of
[32:05] that particular i just turned it on and
[32:07] sure enough
[32:09] it showed me where i was
[32:11] but you know when you're lost you can
[32:13] have a map
[32:14] but if you don't know where you are
[32:17] the map means absolutely nothing to you
[32:19] you could be holding it the wrong way
[32:21] and going left and so it'll it'll it'll
[32:23] be a mess
[32:24] and that's the way the bible is to us if
[32:27] we're if we're lost and we don't know
[32:30] where we are we can be doing all kinds
[32:32] of searching but we're not going to get
[32:34] to the right place because we don't know
[32:35] where we're starting from we have to
[32:37] know where we're starting from first and
[32:39] revelation shows who i am who god is and
[32:42] where i am and i need to know that if i
[32:45] want to know if i want to get to where i
[32:47] need to go
[32:48] so this map's critical we did actually
[32:50] we were able to get back home
[32:52] and nobody asked me if we got lost which
[32:55] is even better
[32:58] another point brother branham talks
[33:00] about by it's by revelation that we can
[33:02] identify where satan's at work
[33:05] that's really really uh really important
[33:07] as well
[33:08] i like this quote from the revelation of
[33:10] jesus christ series satan hates
[33:13] revelation he doesn't like it at all
[33:15] because it upsets all his plans because
[33:19] he says if
[33:21] someone has a revelation of who they are
[33:23] of who jesus is the gates of hell cannot
[33:26] prevail against them if they know where
[33:28] they are where they're going yeah it
[33:30] upsets all of his plans because satan
[33:32] loves to keep us in a state of confusion
[33:35] but revelation brings clarity to
[33:38] confusion and satan hates that
[33:40] that's right now on page four of my
[33:43] notes um
[33:45] there's a there's a there's a quote uh
[33:47] just above the middle page uh at the top
[33:50] left it's four it has page 14 paragraph
[33:53] four in the old version
[33:55] he says have you ever noticed how satan
[33:57] hates two books of the bible more than
[33:59] all others
[34:00] through liberal theologians and
[34:01] pseudoscientists he's always attacking
[34:03] the book of genesis and the book of
[34:05] revelations in both of these books we
[34:07] find satan's origin his awful ways and
[34:09] his destruction that is why he attacks
[34:12] them he hates to be exposed and in those
[34:14] books he is exposed for exactly what he
[34:16] is
[34:17] jesus said about satan he has no part in
[34:20] me and i have no part in him the devil
[34:23] would like to prove that different
[34:25] but he can't
[34:27] so all he can do is try to destroy
[34:30] confidence in the word
[34:32] and i just want to point out that is the
[34:34] devil's primary strategy that's right he
[34:38] can't destroy the word
[34:39] he can't destroy god and he really can't
[34:42] destroy you either
[34:44] but if he can just destroy your
[34:46] confidence in the word
[34:49] if you have a question you won't go to
[34:50] the word for the answer to your question
[34:52] you go somewhere else he will take away
[34:54] your knowledge of who you are he can't
[34:56] take away who you are but he can take
[34:58] away your knowledge of who you are
[35:00] he'll take away knowledge of where you
[35:02] are where you should be going he just
[35:04] sows confusion
[35:06] by trying to destroy your confidence in
[35:08] the word
[35:09] and that is man the last decade that is
[35:11] just what the devil's been trying to do
[35:13] here in the ranks of the message well
[35:15] try and destroy the confidence and then
[35:17] the word and i'd like to point out
[35:19] nobody has disproven water baptism in
[35:22] jesus name the oneness of the godhead
[35:24] any of these core doctrines none of
[35:26] that's been disproven
[35:28] but if you're foundationed on the wrong
[35:29] thing oh he's trying to destroy your
[35:31] confidence
[35:33] very much so but he hasn't destroyed the
[35:35] word
[35:36] so don't let the devil destroy your
[35:38] confidence in the word because he can
[35:40] try to put all because you if you get
[35:42] into that you'll lose confidence the
[35:43] word before too long you'll just take a
[35:45] take on the spirit of cynicism a complex
[35:48] of cynicism where nothing is actually
[35:50] good enough you'll read something up
[35:52] that's that comes short here that comes
[35:54] short there that comes right there and
[35:56] you won't have anywhere to go
[35:58] and that might just thank the lord if
[36:00] you can just open our eyes take off that
[36:02] complex of cynicism so that we can have
[36:04] confidence again in the word because
[36:06] that
[36:07] is grace to us
[36:09] god's given it to us but you've got it's
[36:11] like like a little kid on a kid on
[36:13] christmas day there's this there's this
[36:15] wonderful christmas present for him to
[36:17] open but if the devil can get you to
[36:18] think don't open it your dad
[36:20] booby-trapped it's a bomb don't do it if
[36:22] he can get you destroyed confidence in
[36:24] that your greatest gift will be left
[36:27] unopened unused and you're depriving
[36:29] yourself of so much
[36:31] don't let him destroy confidence in the
[36:33] word but notice he keeps going when the
[36:36] church disbelieves satan and believes
[36:38] the spirit's revelation of the word then
[36:41] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[36:43] her that's why revelation is so
[36:45] important because it knows you tell it
[36:47] tells you who you are
[36:49] who your father is where you're going
[36:52] what power is available to you and then
[36:54] the devil that upsets all the devil's
[36:56] plans he knows who he is he knows what
[36:58] his weapons are he can't take that
[37:00] but he tries to destroy confidence in
[37:02] the word
[37:04] and there's just a couple quotes about
[37:06] revelation at the end of the first
[37:08] chapter that blessed me
[37:10] if revelation's beyond you it's beyond
[37:12] me as well it's beyond all of us if it's
[37:14] beyond us we look up and seek god's for
[37:17] it if we're seeking for revelation we
[37:18] have the promise of the seeker seek and
[37:20] ye shall find
[37:22] ask shall be given knock and it shall be
[37:25] opened you know what it takes a
[37:26] persistent knocking you keep on knocking
[37:29] you keep on knocking you keep on
[37:31] knocking
[37:32] not because god doesn't want one to give
[37:33] but he wants to give his gifts to
[37:35] someone who really really wants it and
[37:37] that's because oh i want to see what's
[37:39] there and oh oh he's not going to give
[37:40] me the first time i really don't care
[37:42] about it that much anyway now sometimes
[37:44] god makes us wait because he wants us to
[37:46] have that value a value that's greater
[37:49] than anything else
[37:51] so don't be discouraged by the weight
[37:54] look up and ask god for that's the only
[37:56] way you're going to get it a revelation
[37:58] has to come from god it never comes by
[38:01] human natural endowments but by
[38:04] spiritual endumid you can even memorize
[38:07] the scripture and though that's
[38:08] wonderful that won't do it it has to be
[38:10] revelation from god and you can find
[38:12] many people who try to approach god in
[38:14] the sincerity of their heart
[38:17] and and through through human study
[38:19] that's not how god works that doesn't
[38:21] mean we just leave the books on the
[38:22] shelf we we we we we seek him but we're
[38:25] not going to be depending upon the
[38:27] wisdom of our own strength to put things
[38:28] together it has to be a revelation from
[38:30] god the next quote says no man knows the
[38:33] things of god save the spirit of god and
[38:35] he'd whom the spirit of god reveals him
[38:36] paul brother bran actually quoting paul
[38:38] there
[38:39] we need to call on god for revelation
[38:42] more than anything else in the world
[38:44] we've accepted the bible
[38:46] we've accepted the great truths of it
[38:48] but it is still not real to most people
[38:50] because the revelation by the spirit is
[38:53] not there it has not been quickened
[38:55] needs to be made alive to us and that's
[38:58] what we can as we we can desire lord
[39:00] make it alive to me make it alive and
[39:02] when that becomes a painful hunger in
[39:04] our hearts oh god will answer that he
[39:08] will make it alive to you
[39:10] amen
[39:12] and that bottom quote on page four it
[39:14] says we'll never get the true meaning of
[39:15] it by study and comparison of scripture
[39:17] as sincere as we may be it's a good
[39:20] thing to do to study but we can't get it
[39:23] in our own strength we have to be humble
[39:25] enough to say lord i'm studying it i
[39:27] can't make heads or tales of it think
[39:29] about the ethiopian eunuch
[39:31] this is a man who is serving a very
[39:33] wealthy queen there in africa and she
[39:36] and he's come to come to jerusalem
[39:39] trying to
[39:40] for some kind of maybe he was bringing
[39:42] some kind of offering i don't know what
[39:44] he was doing as he's coming back he's
[39:46] he's searching through the scriptures i
[39:48] can't get it i'm reading isaiah 53 but i
[39:50] can't get it i don't understand a bit of
[39:52] it and it just drives them nuts but he
[39:54] keeps on reading he keeps on reading i i
[39:56] can't get it then this guy comes he is
[39:59] there's nobody he's never met before
[40:01] comes walking by the chariots and he
[40:02] hears him talking and he's humble enough
[40:05] because he's hungry enough if you're
[40:06] hungry you don't care who the cook is
[40:08] you'll eat whatever they're serving he's
[40:10] hungry enough that this guy he's never
[40:13] seen before comes up he overhears him
[40:15] talking do you understand what you're
[40:16] reading no i don't understand
[40:19] he asked these little fourth graders or
[40:20] fifth graders or six years in class you
[40:22] guys getting it yeah we got it we got it
[40:24] let's we try to do that sometimes we all
[40:25] got it
[40:26] but we if we say we got it we don't we
[40:28] don't get the answers but he was hungry
[40:31] enough he was honest enough he got
[40:34] answers then
[40:35] it'll take a revelation from god to
[40:37] bring it out and at the end there the
[40:40] highlighted portion make no mistake
[40:41] about it we have the infallible word of
[40:44] god today no man there's take from it or
[40:46] add to it but we still need the same
[40:48] spirit that gave and teach it to us just
[40:50] like we have i had the map in front of
[40:52] me but if i didn't know where i was it
[40:54] wasn't going to help me i need the holy
[40:56] spirit to show me that
[40:58] how we need revelation by the spirit
[41:01] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[41:03] a new translation sometimes that's the
[41:05] hope that that a lot of
[41:07] evangelicals have got this new bible
[41:09] translation it makes it so much clearer
[41:11] and yes that can help some but that's
[41:13] not gonna that's not gonna put all the
[41:15] puzzle pieces together for it you have
[41:16] to have the revelation of the spirit you
[41:20] have to have that
[41:22] amen
[41:29] your brother
[41:32] we have to have a revelation of of what
[41:34] god's doing what what what what his plan
[41:36] is
[41:38] brother branham and the message christ
[41:40] is the mystery of god revealed he he's
[41:42] talking about how god has revealed this
[41:44] plan it can be seen in every type that's
[41:46] in the bible the entire bible he says
[41:49] is the revelation of god's mystery in
[41:51] christ the entire bible
[41:53] is an expression of one goal that god
[41:55] had
[41:56] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[41:58] entire bible
[41:59] and
[42:01] i like this kind of going back to what
[42:03] we said you can study and study and
[42:04] study and you can get knowledge of all
[42:07] the different greek parts of speech and
[42:09] all the all the different verb forms
[42:10] know all that kind of thing
[42:14] you'll get some benefit from it i'm sure
[42:16] but it's not going to put all the puzzle
[42:18] pieces together the same way
[42:20] that having a prophetic ministry comes
[42:22] through and shows the whole bible is
[42:24] talking about the one plan studying the
[42:26] original languages that's not going to
[42:28] that's not going to do it for you you
[42:29] have to have revelation once you see
[42:31] that
[42:32] that's why i think revelation is also
[42:34] important it can make the entire bible
[42:35] meaningful unto you in ways that
[42:37] personal study are insufficient to do
[42:40] and i just like
[42:42] and i think i this i think this
[42:43] illustration of the uh of the onion i
[42:47] think it comes from cs lewis how every
[42:49] layer then you just peel it back and
[42:51] it's layer upon layer upon layer of
[42:53] truth as you go on with god you just
[42:54] walk further every layer is just like
[42:56] infinite infinitely layered just keep
[42:59] going on and on honestly layers and
[43:01] layers of layers of of meaning as you
[43:03] get more intimate with with with christ
[43:06] and that's how it is
[43:08] with the bible when we have revelation
[43:13] that shows types and shadows you're
[43:15] going to be seeing it brings multiple
[43:17] levels of meaning throughout the
[43:19] scripture
[43:20] and the example that brother branham
[43:22] uses in chapter 1 of the church age book
[43:24] is the life of joseph
[43:27] in joseph's life
[43:28] man
[43:29] if this guy had a tough
[43:32] life
[43:34] but he had no idea as he was going
[43:37] through all his trials and tribulations
[43:41] very few of any of which he actually
[43:42] deserved he had no idea that god was
[43:45] actually doing something supernatural in
[43:47] his life he didn't know it he didn't i
[43:50] don't know that he saw god's hand there
[43:53] but um
[43:56] in joseph's youth you know he had those
[43:58] those those dreams
[44:00] that uh and and he saw where his family
[44:02] would be bowing down before that was
[44:04] shown multiple times
[44:06] and
[44:07] two two or three witnesses shall
[44:08] something be established this dream just
[44:10] repeated different ways
[44:12] what it all meant he didn't know
[44:14] right he didn't know
[44:16] but he still held on to the belief that
[44:18] it meant something
[44:20] so like again bless your eyes for they
[44:22] see your ears for they hear he couldn't
[44:24] explain what it all meant but he knew
[44:25] they meant something so he hid it in his
[44:27] heart and he can and he held fast to it
[44:30] and you can imagine as joseph went
[44:32] through all of his tribulations he's
[44:34] being betrayed by his brothers he's
[44:36] being betrayed by his by his trusted
[44:38] employer and then he's being forgotten
[44:40] by this by this prisoner he had done so
[44:42] much for to get out of jail he's been
[44:44] forgotten again and again and again
[44:47] what do you think the devil was trying
[44:48] to destroy his confidence in
[44:51] saying ah those james but nothing those
[44:54] dreams nothing god has no plan for your
[44:56] life joseph he's forgotten all about you
[44:59] he was trying to destroy his confidence
[45:01] in the very word
[45:02] that was for joseph that god had spoken
[45:05] to him that's what the devil was trying
[45:07] to destroy
[45:08] but all that time when it seemed that
[45:10] absolutely nothing was happening in
[45:13] joseph's life
[45:15] god's hand was there god's fingerprints
[45:17] were all over joseph's life
[45:20] and look at ourselves in the mirror
[45:21] sometimes think god you're doing nothing
[45:24] in my life right now we can feel that
[45:26] way sometimes i don't see anything going
[45:28] on well god's fingerprints are still all
[45:31] over us
[45:32] he's working with us his hand is busy in
[45:34] our life
[45:35] all the time it seemed that nothing was
[45:37] happening in his life
[45:39] the word of the lord was trying smelting
[45:42] refining him and also revealing himself
[45:46] in ways that joseph
[45:48] could never imagine
[45:50] there are lots of types and shadows
[45:51] joseph's brothers hated him betrayed him
[45:54] just like the jewish religious leaders
[45:56] hated jesus and handed him over to the
[45:58] romans joseph didn't realize but he had
[46:00] the the great privilege of shadowing all
[46:03] of christ's tribulations and blessings
[46:06] later
[46:07] both joseph and christ were accused
[46:09] falsely and unjustly convicted
[46:12] there with with with potiphar's wife for
[46:14] example
[46:15] uh jesus christ is is hung between two
[46:18] thieves and one is granted life the
[46:21] other is not and just like joseph is the
[46:23] same thing he has two fellow prisoners
[46:25] there
[46:26] and the butler and here's an example of
[46:29] how how revelation gonna bring it to
[46:31] life to us the the butler is someone who
[46:34] who brings wine to the pharaoh and wine
[46:36] is something that brother the scripture
[46:38] talks about wine
[46:39] it's never gonna it's it's alive it's
[46:41] not it's going to get better with age
[46:43] this wine is not going to perish and die
[46:44] it's going to get better with age the
[46:46] butler goes back to his position and and
[46:48] the wines like the blood of christ
[46:49] that's that's how we get life
[46:51] but the but the baker he's working with
[46:53] bread and the and the and jesus christ
[46:56] body was was broken there on the cross
[46:59] and just like the communion breads
[47:00] broken for us that had the the the baker
[47:04] he's he was going to get broken that's
[47:05] what his his whole occupation was was
[47:07] typing it was one just like the thieves
[47:09] on the cross
[47:10] one prisoner went back got his jaw back
[47:12] the other one the other one died
[47:15] both joseph and christ were exalted with
[47:18] from the unjust condemnation to the
[47:19] right hand of the throne
[47:21] all this is this is very similar than
[47:23] both joseph and christ take a gentile
[47:25] bride these are similarities
[47:28] and even um you see it in the genesis
[47:31] chapter 48 when joseph
[47:34] brings his two sons to um to to jacob to
[47:39] be to be blessed
[47:41] joseph's bringing the the eldest son on
[47:43] his right side and his youngest son
[47:45] they're on the left side as he's doing
[47:47] that
[47:48] he's wanting his dad to anoint with the
[47:50] right hand on the elder son
[47:52] that left on the youngest son but his
[47:54] dad in the middle of this ceremony that
[47:56] joseph has been looking forward to the
[47:58] dad crosses his hands and puts his right
[48:01] hand upon the younger son has left him
[48:03] on the older side and joe says dad dad
[48:05] you're messing everything up because
[48:07] he's the oldest he should get the right
[48:09] hand blessed he's no son god crossed my
[48:12] hands and brother brandon points out
[48:14] that that's important because when you
[48:15] cross your hands what do you get you get
[48:17] a cross
[48:19] and that just shows how the blessings of
[48:21] the cross
[48:22] the cross makes the blessings of
[48:25] of god available to the to the to the
[48:27] gentile and not just to the jew and all
[48:30] this it becomes meaningful
[48:32] not by study but by revelation god puts
[48:35] those pieces together
[48:38] and you can read about them in the
[48:40] church age book pages 35 and 36 it's
[48:42] really beautifully described there and
[48:44] even the restoration of 144 000 jews is
[48:48] woven to the fabric of joseph's life
[48:49] because joseph's younger brother
[48:51] benjamin he types hundred forty four
[48:53] thousand jews this is his special
[48:55] brother he reveals himself
[48:57] to the special brother while the
[48:58] gentiles are away there in the palace
[49:01] this is such a special time so joseph's
[49:03] life
[49:05] of some so many odd decades
[49:08] has a meaning
[49:10] in so many odd decades of joseph's life
[49:12] an explanation that spans millennia is
[49:14] packed into there and you only can see
[49:16] that by
[49:18] revelation
[49:20] study is not going to bring it out but
[49:21] revelation does
[49:23] i just love this that
[49:25] joseph's life there were prophecies
[49:27] about his life that were that were
[49:29] spoken over him there at the beginning
[49:31] through these dreams but all these
[49:33] prophecies were locked up
[49:36] until the time that his word came and
[49:38] i'm quoting here from psalm 105
[49:41] and i really love i love this psalm
[49:44] um
[49:45] this is talking about how god psalm 105
[49:47] talks about how god was dealing with the
[49:49] jews in the old testament and verse 16
[49:51] says he called for a famine upon the
[49:53] land
[49:54] he break the whole staff of bread there
[49:56] in canaan
[49:57] but verse 17 he sent a man before them
[50:00] even joseph who was sold for a servant
[50:02] whose feet they hurt with fetters he was
[50:04] laid in iron
[50:06] until the time that his word came
[50:10] so the devil could have him there in
[50:12] iron and fetters but only for so long
[50:16] the devil could not do that
[50:17] intermittably
[50:19] only for so long because once it was
[50:21] time for that word to be fulfilled
[50:22] nothing could keep joseph in that prison
[50:26] absolutely nothing and this doesn't this
[50:28] revelation on the personal level doesn't
[50:30] just apply to joseph because there are
[50:32] scriptures that are spoken about us as
[50:34] well if you seek you shall find that's
[50:37] spoken about you and if you seek you
[50:40] seek you seek there's a promise you will
[50:43] find the devil might have you locked up
[50:44] on irons locked up in chains he can only
[50:46] hold you there for so long because
[50:48] there's a promise when you seek you will
[50:50] find and you will be released you will
[50:53] be delivered you'll have that revelation
[50:55] granted to you until the time that his
[50:57] word came he wasn't rotting in jail
[51:00] until the time that his word came the
[51:02] word of the lord tried him
[51:05] god is dealing with him the entire time
[51:07] he's not god never wastes
[51:10] suffering god never wastes
[51:12] your time he's always dealing with us in
[51:15] some special way until the time this
[51:17] word came to the time that that god's
[51:19] time is for to reveal himself to you
[51:21] he's dealing with you until that time
[51:24] satan can have you for so long but he is
[51:26] not the boss of our lives by any means
[51:30] just above that in the notes on page
[51:32] five there's a quote
[51:34] this is where brother branham's talking
[51:36] about how the um
[51:37] the truth of water baptism the godhead
[51:40] that was um
[51:41] was was uh was was lost but it says
[51:44] right up until the truth was lost about
[51:46] water baptism in jesus name and that
[51:48] truth did not return to this last stage
[51:50] that's from nicaea to the turn of this
[51:52] century
[51:53] until that time
[51:55] that it was lost they baptized the name
[51:56] of the lord jesus christ but it has come
[52:00] back why because satan can't keep the
[52:03] revelation down
[52:04] when the spirit wants to give it he
[52:06] can't keep it down and the spirit wants
[52:08] to give us so that's when i if we see
[52:10] the spirit of god moving
[52:12] whether it hear it here in the service
[52:14] or if you see if god's moving in your
[52:16] car as you're driving somewhere wherever
[52:18] god's moving make that a priority
[52:20] because god speaking to you is the
[52:22] greatest blessing that we have
[52:24] absolutely
[52:26] absolutely
[52:27] this is revelation on a personal level
[52:30] just just in closing here
[52:32] um
[52:34] here we have a block of granite
[52:36] taken out of some
[52:38] granite quarry in italy and we see
[52:40] absolutely
[52:41] nothing there to me i'd almost mistake
[52:43] it for a big block of styrofoam
[52:45] but it's it's a block of beautiful white
[52:47] granite i wouldn't know what i could do
[52:49] about it do do do with it
[52:51] and that's how we look at ourselves
[52:53] sometimes i just see a
[52:55] big piece of dirt that even look good
[52:57] anymore
[52:58] god but god sees something bigger there
[53:00] special there i like this quote of
[53:02] michelangelo he says i saw the angel in
[53:05] the marble
[53:06] and i carved until i set him free.
[53:09] he see something in there that nobody
[53:11] else saw
[53:12] god sees something in you that you might
[53:15] not see
[53:16] and you can be trapped in that marble
[53:19] only for so long
[53:20] you can stay trapped in there only for
[53:22] so long because when it's time for that
[53:23] word to come god's going to be chiseling
[53:25] he's going to be hammering he's going to
[53:26] be buffing he'll be polishing to bring
[53:29] you out of there and here's a here's a
[53:31] picture of a statue that's still in
[53:33] progress this is one of michelangelo's
[53:35] there's a series of statues that he
[53:36] didn't finish it's called the prisoners
[53:38] you can see him in florence can you see
[53:40] i can't wait to be free i want to be
[53:43] free i just can't wait keep working on
[53:45] me oh god and just keep chiseling
[53:48] chiseling hammering away and then when
[53:50] at that time he's done and you are free
[53:53] everything that's not that angel has
[53:55] been shut off from the marble and you
[53:57] can look at yourself in this manner who
[53:59] am i i'm not the marble that's broken
[54:01] all around me that's not me
[54:03] i'm this finished product who do i look
[54:06] like i look like the one who is
[54:08] chiseling me who is sculpting me because
[54:10] i made in his
[54:11] image
[54:13] that's what revelation does on a
[54:15] personal level showing us who we are who
[54:18] god is that god is working in ourselves
[54:21] the entire time he will never leave you
[54:23] nor forsake you he never will he's
[54:26] working in you the entire entire time
[54:30] amen musicians can come i'm i'm pretty
[54:32] much finished here
[54:34] we can just finish with one with one
[54:36] scripture verse first timothy chapter
[54:38] four
[54:41] and this is just uh
[54:43] that's my word of encouragement
[54:46] timothy was a uh was a young man and
[54:48] paul's writing uh
[54:50] these letters to timothy
[54:52] from from from prison so you can imagine
[54:54] as paul's writing them uh timothy is
[54:56] treasuring them because he doesn't know
[54:58] will this be the last word that i
[54:59] received from paul
[55:02] and i just
[55:04] verse 12 and to the end of the chapter
[55:07] mean a lot to me especially as we
[55:09] consider
[55:10] what was kind of my um what's been my
[55:12] burden going through this that we could
[55:14] get ourselves rooted and grounded and
[55:16] what our foundation really should be the
[55:18] word of god and
[55:20] verse 12 says let no man despise thy
[55:23] youth
[55:24] but be thou an example of the believers
[55:26] in word and conversation and charity and
[55:28] spirit and faith and purity and say let
[55:31] no man despise your youth no you despise
[55:33] it either sometimes we think oh i'm a
[55:34] i'm a young person i'll never understand
[55:36] it anyway we have that thought we're
[55:38] despising our own youth
[55:40] don't do that let no man despise your
[55:43] youth what is paul's advice here he says
[55:45] verse 13 till i come give attendance to
[55:48] reading to exhortation to doctrine
[55:51] neglect not the gift that's in thee
[55:53] which is given thee by profit with the
[55:54] laying on of hands of the presbytery
[55:56] what should we be doing meditate upon
[55:57] these things
[55:59] give yourself holy to them that thy
[56:01] profiting may appear to all
[56:03] take heed to yourself
[56:05] under the doctrine continue in them for
[56:07] in doing this you'll both save yourself
[56:10] and them that hear thee and that just be
[56:13] my
[56:14] my encouragement to you if you if you've
[56:16] said uh i've been wanting to get
[56:18] into the message at some point but i've
[56:20] never really made time for i think
[56:23] why not start
[56:24] make time for it because it is the grace
[56:26] of god to you and whatever level god's
[56:29] ready to reveal it to you he'll
[56:30] he will reveal it to you
[56:32] ask him for revelation he'll put the
[56:34] pieces there so there's a lot of times
[56:36] with what we're doing as we're as we're
[56:37] reading or listening we're just putting
[56:39] puzzle pieces into our heart
[56:41] and they're just kind of rumbling around
[56:43] in there and we can try to put them
[56:44] together but if we if we never put the
[56:46] pieces into our heart god doesn't have
[56:48] those in our heart to put together in
[56:50] the first place
[56:51] so put them there then he will put them
[56:53] there in the right spot
[56:54] in time so i just just encourage you
[56:58] don't be afraid of questions don't be
[57:00] afraid of the message because it's god's
[57:03] grace for us amen
[57:05] let's pray
[57:07] heavenly father we thank you very much
[57:08] for your goodness and your grace to us
[57:10] lord i thank you for what you've
[57:12] given us here and the inspiration
[57:15] that is there lord it just quenches
[57:17] quenches our earth thirst father

[57:22] that as we
[57:23] might even tonight or tomorrow open our
[57:26] bible open the message book father

[57:35] where we at where we're at in the drama
[57:38] of your story we might better see

[58:15] [Applause]
[58:21] wonderful teaching tonight
[58:24] thank god for it i appreciate it so much
[58:26] you can never
[58:27] over emphasize brother graham said the
[58:29] importance of revelation to the believer
[58:32] and he said this after that revelation
[58:35] the most important thing because it's
[58:37] personal between you and god
[58:40] it's completely out of the
[58:42] other realms of information and learning
[58:45] so totally everything quiet because it's
[58:47] personal between you
[58:49] so i don't have anything to add tonight
[58:51] i just wanted to say i wasn't supposed
[58:52] to get up but sister lindsey you've got
[58:55] that box of church ages books back there
[58:57] right you have some extras
[58:59] so if you want to get one tonight can
[59:01] you open the office the library and so
[59:04] um
[59:05] we'll open the office and you can get
[59:07] one i don't know how much they are
[59:09] but if you get it pay for it if you
[59:11] can't just get it and pay them later or
[59:13] whatever or take it now pay for it
[59:15] because i want you to have your own copy
[59:16] if you don't have one take the next
[59:18] month and start studying this together
[59:20] with brother wrap
[59:21] and
[59:22] his his
[59:24] notes some of you have them tonight we
[59:25] send them to your phones or we send them
[59:27] an email how do we send them brandon
[59:29] hopefully you get to the phones by text
[59:31] and then the powerpoint is available as
[59:33] well so we'll have those available you
[59:35] can follow all right along in the
[59:36] teaching but one of the things brother
[59:38] rap said in the office tonight says my
[59:40] emphasis tonight
[59:42] was really me is to
[59:45] to get get the church
[59:46] church facebook and read it and get into
[59:48] it yourself if you haven't yet and even
[59:51] though the subject was revelation he
[59:52] wanted to emphasize why because satan
[59:55] destroys the confidence
[59:58] of this of what god's given us
[1:00:00] and so to go to counter that we'll just
[1:00:02] get into it and find out for yourself
[1:00:04] and find out what the word says
[1:00:06] wonderful praise the lord come on
[1:00:07] brother joe lead us in a couple of
[1:00:09] courses before we go tonight and uh so
[1:00:12] if you can open that lindsey and anybody
[1:00:13] wants to get a church aide book tonight
[1:00:15] and pay for it if you can't pay for it
[1:00:17] tonight then get it another time because
[1:00:18] i want you to take one home and then
[1:00:20] another thing too is if they wanted to
[1:00:22] order their own you've got a few weeks
[1:00:24] to do it
[1:00:25] get the address out of that new church
[1:00:27] book and it'd be believers international
[1:00:30] and give that address and you can order
[1:00:31] one yourself online i think it's
[1:00:33] believers international doc
[1:00:35] dot com or dot org george smith put this
[1:00:37] one out can i see that brother
[1:00:40] and there's the ones we have in the back
[1:00:41] this is of course more expensive leather
[1:00:43] copy
[1:00:44] um i don't know if i have one of these
[1:00:46] wrap has one but anyway uh
[1:00:48] but they have those you can order and
[1:00:50] then
[1:00:51] um they have the other ones but it's the
[1:00:52] same thing george smith redid
[1:00:54] re-paragraphed re-paragraph it into some
[1:00:56] different things it's really easy to
[1:00:58] read wonderful wonderful books so get
[1:01:00] one tonight if you don't have one
