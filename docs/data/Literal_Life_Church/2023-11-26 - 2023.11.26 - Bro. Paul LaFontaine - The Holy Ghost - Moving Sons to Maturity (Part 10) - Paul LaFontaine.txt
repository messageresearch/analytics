1920 and 21 we're looking forward to those special meetings to uh worship with the Lord and rejoice in what he has done and that he has kept us alive all these years Caleb said he has kept me alive all these years and God has certainly kept us alive and still believing with all of our hearts if you would turn with me this morning to Ephesians chapter 4 we're going to read some verses of scripture together and once again we welcome all of our visitors today those from out of town those who are in for the holidays and uh we appreciate you joining in with us may the Lord bless the word anoint our words with the anointing of the holy spirit that we can all be fed this morning from the word of God Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 13 Ephesians 4 and13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ when it says until we come into the unity or till we come it means until that means that we still have something out in front of us that the Holy Ghost is taking us to so how many know that the Holy Ghost is a growth into something it's not a a one night deal but it's something he's taking us to and here it echoes that in the scripture as it does in many places we were read today that the scripture takes of the Holy talks of the Holy Ghost taking us somewhere and this is about Unity till we all come in the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and perfect in the scripture does not mean Flawless perfection in the flesh it means growth to maturity so that's what I want to speak on as well unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive so now this is we this is Paul saying we're growing towards the unity but one thing that we have to do is be not be children who have a distinction of being tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine and the only way that you're not tossed that way is that you know where you stand you know where your stance is in the word and you are standing solid in that as a mature Christian that you're not tossed about believing one thing one day and the next day believing something else that's a child spiritually and we're to mature out of that being tossed about by every wind of Doctrine we're not driven by the winds but we're driven by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost holds us stable to for all the Winds of doctrine that come through but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him him in all things which the which is the head even Christ verse 15 again speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him how many want to grow up into him in all things we are to grow up in all things not just Doctrine but in all things we are to mature and grow up and be mature Sons and Daughters of God I love that and we do it by speaking the truth in love we speak the truth we grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Heavenly Father we ask you to bless and uh just cleanse our lips this morning that we would say those things that are needful for the people Lord that you would remove any hindrance in the service today that your spirit would have preeminence today and Lord we've already given our hearts in worship Lord as we felt your presence here we pray Lord that you will deliver us and help us and strengthen us in your word and we ask it in Jesus name amen I bless you can have your seats I'm just picking up another section on the series on the Holy Ghost and I want to title this the holy ghost moving Sons to maturity and we touched on it a little bit a few weeks ago when we talked about uh the the word of adoption that comes out of Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 Paul called the Holy Spirit the spirit of adoption that's the first time it was mentioned that way that we receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father so he is the first one that called it called the Holy Ghost the spirit of adoption that is not referred to in the book of Acts at all the Holy Ghost is not referred to as the the it's the spirit of adoption and uh we realize that's for a reason because and it's only mentioned five times in the Bible Paul mentions it and it's because that Paul he has a truth behind what he's in introducing and that truth is that that this Holy Ghost will not just bring you a new birth will not just bring a change of your nature in your soul will not just make you a new creature in Christ Jesus but this same Holy Ghost will lead us and guide us somewhere ultimately to a Rapture how many's interested in that so he's he's going to begin using the word adoption because adoption has the connotation it's not your birth adoption has to be growing into something growth into something coming to uh uh something else in other words he's saying that the same holy ghost that birthed you the same holy ghost that changed your nature the same holy ghost that gave you a new birth is the same holy ghost that will lead us and guide us somewhere we are growing into something can you say amen and in Romans 8 Paul expresses it later on in the scriptures where he says under this teaching uh under this teaching of the Holy Ghost we're waiting on something two things he says we're waiting on he said all creation and we ourselves are waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God and then he says we're waiting for our adoption to ITT the change of our bodies our new bodies so this holy ghost that we received at an altar or in your home wherever you receive this Holy Ghost it's taking us somewhere and we're still waiting on something so because he words it that way adoption has the connotation this Holy Ghost is not just a one-time deal at an altar but it's actually growing us and taking us into something and and that is the manifestation of the sons of God and then the Redemption of these bodies it is only the holy ghost that takes you to the manifestation of the sons of God it is only the holy ghost that brings you into full mature son and daughter of God and it is only the holy ghost that takes you to the Rapture there's no other way into a Rapture except by the Holy Ghost but do you get my simple thought this morning it's taking us somewhere it's growing us into something can you say amen and so if we are all done at the altar when we receive his Spirit then why is Paul teaching that we're still waiting on something because this Holy Ghost is taking us somewhere it is a journey so if you don't have it this morning seek God with all your heart and get in this journey with us it's the Journey of the Holy Ghost and it's taking us somewhere and even though in God's eyes we are a finished work uh my son Gideon preached a couple weeks ago on uh it is finished and when when when Christ said that at Calvary as far as the sacrifice being paid and as far as the completion of what will become in God's eyes we're a finished work because Calvary did a finished work so any born again Christian who comes along then in God's eyes it's already finished because he's paid the price he's paid the price all the way from your beginning all the way to the Rapture all the way to the Millennium it is finished can you say man so that truth is there we we rest in the the finished work of Calvary we should rest in that the price has been paid can you say Amen the power to complete us is in us right I said the power to complete us is already in us because we receive the spirit of adoption amen and so now uh in Christ I am complete how many you raise your hand and say in Christ if I'm in Christ by the Holy Ghost I'm already complete in God's eyes amen already Justified already Sanctified already Justified already seating as far as positioning in my soul already seating with Christ in Heavenly places the believer's position in Christ we know that but you see now because we're in a human experience because and I want to get into this next Sunday I didn't have time last night it all opened up and I won't have time to get into it today but but there's a truth in in in the mystery of MDC of our theophanies and that is this is the truth is that we entered we we bypassed our theophany our word body and we came to this life in this Human Experience to be tempted can you say Amen because we bypassed because of sin in the garden we bypassed the normal way and we came to our human bodies before we went to our word body say where in the world are you getting that preacher maybe you're asking on the internet on the broadcast where are you getting that I'm getting it from the Bible if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting in the heavens Eternal in the heavens we have an eternal theophonic Sunday's message I can't get away from it it's I'm fired up about it because we came the wrong way then our kinsman redeemer has to step down into the human experiences as well now he didn't bypass his theophany Christ he came from the very mind of God to theophany body and then to an Earthly body but because he had an Earthly body he had to experience this human Journey not by Eternal he was already done he had to grow into mature into the the the the the uh the the uh manifestation that God wanted to be and so now he had had to grow say where you get the scriptures for that he learned obedience by the things he suffered he he lived out all the agees we do he was born a baby now if he was the offen he wouldn't have to be born a baby he's a full matured body he'd come that way but because he had to come in the human expence he had to go through baby teenage years uh adolescent years he go you know he went through all the stages that we go through because he had to experience that can you say Amen so now it's it's he had to come through that so now when we come into these bodies by the Holy Ghost we hold all the potentials within us to come to complete adoption can you say Amen but we have to go through those stages of growing we're already Justified before God's eyes it's already a finished work but we have to live out maturing in God's grace because guess what you're your Soul's born again but your body's not your mind is not I wish my mind was born again that I wouldn't have all these thoughts and things and let my mind get off track you see my mind's not born again but the growth of a Christian is that he brings this body under subjection to the Holy Ghost that's why we're here did you know did you know that our Prophet had that this age of Satan's Eden is to prove to Satan that this Eve that I'm preaching to you this morning this Eve is not like the first Eve in the garden for the bride we're here to prove something to the enemy is that we're going to grow into manifested sons of God praise the Lord amen and so now even though we're let me just pass that section because I think I said enough on that the Holy Ghost is the Journey of coming into all truth Jesus said this is what it is it's not a feeling the Holy Ghost is is not a tongue it's not a feeling it's not a sensation it's the life in you that seeks truth and all truth it never stops seeking truth about you about the word about the world about everything else we have to find truth the Holy Ghost if you have it will make you constantly for your whole life seek more truth because it's called the spirit of Truth John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things what the Holy Ghost is going to teach you things yes the Holy Ghost is a teacher who is who is he teaching Sons and Daughters of God and he gives us this Holy Ghost you don't hear this preaching a lot but he actually says it will teach you all things he gives you the Holy Ghost to teach you something it's not just to give you a feeling or an emotion or no no it's it's he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance what so I've said unto you John 15:26 John 15:26 but when the comforter has come whom I will send you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me he'll bring us back to Christ the Holy Ghost will point you back to Christ always back to Christ John 16:13 excuse me John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come what's it called a Spirit of what's it called Spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost is a spirit of Truth he will guide you into all truth how many can say Amen to that what will this Holy Ghost do will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever you shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come all three of these scriptures they sound like a journey to me it doesn't sound like a one night thing it sounds like a journey I will lead you and guide you into all truth it sounds like a growth to me there's too many places in Paul's teaching he refers to it being a growth as he begin to lay this teaching in of adoption growing to maturity as opposed and listen friends I'm just only doing this because I'm on a series on the Holy Ghost and I've tried to take it from many perspectives but I can't teach on the Holy Ghost and preach on it unless I talk about adoption a maturity can you say Amen and where it's taking us I can't just preach it what it does to us to change our souls and our desires I've also got to preach about where it's taking us growing to maturity as opposed to Growing to maturity as opposed to staying babes spiritually he called the Corinthians babes carnal ye are babes in Christ ye are carnal Paul called them that they were Christians they were they had the Holy Ghost the Corinthians but they were babies with the Holy Ghost in Hebrews Paul said that your babes needing to you need your babes because you need to keep hearing the elementary principles but you need to leave those things and move on to Perfection just to so uh the way he said it Hebrews chapter 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection Hebrews chapter 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go onto Perfection once again grow to maturity not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works uh of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms on the laying on of hands of the Resurrection or the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit he's saying that if you keep dwelling in that that's Elementary teachings we should know that and we should be moving on from that it's wrong to M uh to emphasize and major on a minor wow just the major on healing is the major on a minor are we dumping out the minor no we need the minor of healing because we get sick how many get sick okay four or five of us still getting sick so we still need healing we still need the atonement right so so now Paul when he says let's leave these things it doesn't mean we're we're ditching them we're does doesn't mean we're ditching the birth in the H ghost that doesn't mean we're ditching baptism and ditching no no no we have to have those we need the nine spiritual gifts in the church and they do work in the church because they don't happen in a service doesn't mean the nine spiritual gifts aren't working do you know what they are the word of wisdom the word of faith healing and it may not necessarily happen here in a service all the time but I can tell you in this body a Word of Wisdom a Word of Faith a word of encouragement healing is happening happening all the time we have the nine spiritual gifts in the church amen so now I read a quote to you from desperations Pentecost that's where you failed you thought because you were born of the spirit of God the birthright that settled it but it only starts it you remember in the message of hear him how that child after it was born in the family became a son it has rights to the birth but has to be proven child trained so did the Pentecostal the later on in the quote he says so do the Pentecostal people and they begin to organize the Oneness threeness and trinitarians and all kinds of organizations and fussing and pulling at one another prove that the token wasn't showing malice eny Strife see but that's where it's got to go friends listen now Paul is is made the distinctions and the prophet is making a distinction Pentecost this is where you have failed is that you did not bring this Holy Ghost as an adoption that it's taking you to maturity because you don't there's fussing there's pulling it what do all that it's immaturities malice Envy Strife amongst the ministers amongst the people immaturities but oh you could have a service and boy have the have the the power of God and have the emotion of God and all that you could have it so much but when characteristics of immaturities are still there something's missing that's right can I get an amen organizing into denominations Oneness Tess threeness trinitarians it becomes organizational becomes denominational when we fuss and Ste one another and divide over Doctrine we're just like a denomination when we divide over Doctrine praise the Lord so if Paul makes these distinctions in the New Testament about growing into adoption and that our Holy Ghost experience is growing into something then our Messenger will do the same thing because our messenger said the seventh angel messenger preached the same thing as the first Angel messenger and he said that he says I'm I'm glad because I preach the same thing Paul preached and he makes a pretty a bold statement here towards the Pentecostals Pentecost that's where you failed that's a pretty bold statement to say Pentecost you failed and then he says what you failed in that's pretty bold say that that Pentecost that's where you fail fail and that is that they were overlooking or skipping the adoption part of the Holy Ghost can I get an amen this morning Pentecost you're failing because you're skipping you're overlooking the other parts of the Holy Ghost with an emphasis only on the birth only on the gifts not where it is to take you to sunship to mature Sons to a placing of sons and to a Rapture can you say Amen Jesus himself his adoption time was not the same as his birth he had a birth he had midlife he had a he had a he had uh uh excuse me middle life at 12 years old it shows him he had his baptism he had his placing he learned obedience by the things he suffered until then a word came I'm pleased with my son this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in blessed be the name of the Lord the Greek word for adoption is heresia and it comes from two Greek words which means the placing the placing of a son and it occurs only five times in the New Testament this Greek word of aesia which it adoption it means placing of a son it does not mean the birth of a son it means placing and Paul used that term for a reason where the Holy Ghost is taking us when you see your placing his position as as a son when you see your placing in position as a son you come into power you come into Authority and you also you're growing in your character can you say Amen at the end time the Seven Seals were prophesied to be revealed for what why were the seals revealed to show Sons their position their place when he open the seals he hath made us Kings and Priests he hath made us he's making us into something something and so to show show it now he reveals himself the seals are himself as he reveals the son Christ he takes the seals off of himself to show Sons their place to position them the Mysteries then he gives all the Mysteries the serpent seed uh the future home all these Mysteries that have been revealed is to to place sons that they know who they are why do Sons need to know where they are in the word because the end time is the time for the manifestation of the sons of God all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Malachi 45 and Revelations 10:7 which scriptures you're familiar with you should be Malachi 45 and Revelations 107 has been already fulfilled but it is to produced produce Romans 8:19 the manifestation of the sons of God can I say it again the scriptures already fulfilled God met our expectations we were expecting we were looking for God to fulfill his word in sending Elijah but I'm telling you that's been fulfilled but it's not all fulfilled yet all of those scriptures Revelations 10 Matthew uh Malachi 45 and 6 Luke 17 all of them are being fulfilled now is to bring us to Romans 8:19 say that Romans 8:19 that's the scripture you need to pray about and and hone in them because this is the scripture that the message is producing that we're under the expectation for what the Holy Ghost is going to do not another healing Revival you with me this morning too much turkey on Thursday we're waiting and under expectation for the Holy Ghost what it's going to do not another healing Revival but all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God not just us but all of creatures let me wake you up a little bit do you ever wonder what the animals could tell us if they could talk to us right and they can't talk to us by the way I know there's some dog lovers that feel like their dog talks to them and dogs you know what what I feel about dogs dogs you want you what's on the minds of these animals what are they thinking well for dogs it's about food which I can relate to a little bit but you ever wonder what the animals are thinking because the Bible tell us here it's a mystery being open to us that all creatures all creation all have this sense in their conscience it's not they don't have a soul but they have a spirit you know animals can sense when there's there's a storm coming so they have a sense they have a a sick sense there they can tell something's happened and so they all sense probably sense one thing is that back about 6,000 years ago Adam a Son of God was in charge of this Earth there was no sin there was no scare there was no fear there was no animals that would come and eat them because there was no fear in this world because a Son of God was in his position and in control of everything then Eve fell and Adam fell with her and all of creation was lost everything comes under the bondage of fear everything goes arai everything for 6,000 years but God said I will restore I will redeem it I'll come to Calvary when he redeemed us at Calvary he redeemed the whole earth I'll bring the whole thing back I'm going to bring Sons back in their position and I'm going to bring the Earth I'm going to burn it with fire and it's going to come back to a Garden of Eden again and I'm going to put my sons on it and I'm going to restore everything back the way that it was so somehow all of creation knows this fall is taking place but they know in order to get it back the manifestation of the sons of God has to take place first and all creation's groaning we're groaning for it brother Randy we're groaning for something we're groaning in our hearts There's Something That We're and guess what all of creation is groaning for it as well you ever ask them if they would talk to you I wonder what they would tell us sons of God who believe this message I wonder what tell us if a squirrel talks to you what would they say I'm wondering if they would say why don't you Sons get your act together we're all waiting for this to wrap up hi Heather what in the world are you doing I'm wonder if they're tired of our immaturities just like I get tired of them and God gets tired of them and they've been waiting for 6,000 years and it's like guys get your act together take a hold of this word let it fill your whole being let it bring you to the place that your Rapture Ready and let it Rapture because we're waiting for this they're not concerned about the next president they're not concerned about what the next movie coming out they're not groaning waiting for the next movie like some of us Americans do they're not worried about Christmas they're not worried about where's the next money because the Bible tells us they have a conscience of God that takes care of them that says they're not worried about what's where the next meal is coming from they're completely dependent on God they have things probably better without a soul sometimes it's a dependence on God but what are you guys doing I wonder if if they could say something to us and they're groaning for this they could if I could just say something to these people stop fussing stop fighting stop haggling over Doctrine quit all this stuff chatter from a squirrel just stop it find your place stand there as a son and daughter in power in authority and in maturity get your act together it's a finished work so walk into the finished work let's get this thing wrapped up I wonder if the Lions and all the ones over at the Zoo today and all of creation everything is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the Son of God I wonder if they could tell you let's let's finish this up we're tired of this world we're tired of the fear right praise the Lord let me know if a squirrel talks to you this week let me know what he says or she David Weber a Christian writer says the traditional Hebrew view of the adoption of a son has absolutely nothing to do with the placement of an orphan in a foster home rather it has to do with a young man coming into a place of maturity whereby the full Authority and resources of his father are bestowed upon him when it says manifestations of the Son of God it means a revealing in Romans 8:19 the word for re manifestation is apocalypsis which simply means disclosure manifestation means disclosure in other words throughout the whole new testament it is also translated appearing coming Enlighten Revelation the definition assigned to its root word is to take off the cover therefore when we come across this word apocalypsis in the Scripture it has to do with exposing of something that has been hidden from view or bringing into light that which has been kept OBS in obscurity In this passage of scripture it should be pretty clear that what God has been hiding and has been held in obscurity is the sons of God he's been hiding the full potential and what the sons of God are and so now it's in a great revealing of his son Christ Seven Seals in a great revealing at the end time of his son Christ in the seven seal he is those seals and he reveals himself himself for his sons to see themselves as well it's all about seeing yourself it's all about seeing your position and walking into that position in in maturity so it's it's it's when he this is the wonderful thing about the Seven Seals and the revealing of Christ when he fully uncovers himself then he uncovers all the sons because wherever he's going that's where all the sons are going the revealing of his son in the company of his sons it was is what brings us to a climax if you want scripture for that it's 1 John 3 and: 2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear a apocalypsis when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is when we see him as he is then we see ourselves as who we really are manifestation of the sons of God now now you take the Greek work I'm not a big Greek word person we let the teach teachers do that this was very interesting that in the Bible in the New Testament there were three different Greek words for Sons if you guys want to put that slide up three different Greek words for Sons number one is Tech neon which means an infant or a baby and you'll find places when it says sons in the New Testament that refers to this Greek word okay secondly is techon youth or teenagers or Adolescent and you'll find that Greek word referring to uh that age group when Jesus was 12 years old and so that's what refers to that those situations but then this last one is the Greek word for sons in Romans 8:19 uh is that what the scripture is yes in Romans 8 where it says the manifestation of sons this Sons is the Greek word Paul used and he had to use this Greek word hus uh who us which means fully matured Sons so when he says the manifestation of sons he don't mean an infant or a baby he doesn't mean a teenager when this comes it's fully matured Sons Paul was very careful if you want to take a picture of that course you're not supposed to have your phones in church this is the places that it mentions Sons but Paul is very careful in his choice of words for the word Sons Paul chose the word whoos rather than the word techon which means infant or techon which speaks of a child or youth because he was not referring to Mere children whoos specifically speaks of matured fully developed sons are those who have come of age into full maturity of the three words hos is the only word that the Holy Spirit inspired Paul to use when he spoke of those to be manifested as sons of God in Romans 8 it's all by the the same holy ghost in other words all of these Sons is all by the same Holy Ghost it's all stages by the Holy Ghost being in you these are the stages of it but it's all this Sons that's born h a reference to that is is in uhh John 1 those who received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God well that Sons is not a mature son that's something different that's either a baby or infant that's a different meaning to it so you when you receive him then you receive the power to become a Son of God but in Romans we find a different thing now let me just uh read a little bit more from some writers this is from uh Mary Kay I don't know where her La last name is but she said a few good things there I wanted to read in relation to some of the quotes that I want to read as well spiritual babes who are carnal and immature 1 Corinthians 3 are easily influenced by teaching and schemes of men because they have not exercised their senses to discern both good and evil Ephesians 4:14 neus also fed on the Milk of the word of God neus also feeds on the M of word and are unskilled in the word of righteousness that's one of these Greek words here not the last one although they have received a revelation of who God is and have entered into New Life nepus are inclined to the Natural and flesh life they are those who are quick to gossip cause conflict and division are self-centered and enter into Strife they are spiritual babies and that is what babies do they whine fight scream and always cry when they do not get their ways so this is the reference to that first uh word if you just leave that up for a couple minutes this is a reference to babies in Christ that have the characteristics of self-centered and strife and cause Division and quick to gossip spiritual babies W whine and fight and scream and always cry when they do not get their ways in John 215 the word children in the verse implies that there's an existing relationship but a deficiency in maturity and reveals the childish nature of the disciples at that time these disciples had slipped back and disconnected from their assignment as followers of Christ after the death of Jesus by going back to the usual routine fishing when we disconnect from our assignment following a an offense a heartbreak or a bitter moment we are still children oh can I read it again when we disconnect disconnect from our assignment being in the line of duty it would be the way brother Brandon words it following an offense or a heartbreak or a bitter moment we are still acting like spiritual children Patty are under the to to uh toage or excuse me the um the teaching of a spiritual father in the church because they are not ready for the world on their own so this is all all in the category of Christians that are babies and not growing up but I want to go back to that incident that she brings up in John 215 because that's that's the teenager that's the spiritual teenager that these disciples had Walk With Jesus all these years and these three three and a half years and seen his miracles and done all these things under the sun a man and all of a sudden now when when he's gone they don't know what to do so Peter they're just all depressed and discouraged and this trial has come and they don't know where they stand anymore then then we see that he said Peter says I'm I'm going fishing so they're defaulting back to their old thing they used to do for maybe a relaxation and there's not a problem with using fishing as a relaxation but these guys were in their doubt and their fear I'm giving up I'm I'm going away I just need to go fishing I know some of you men say that on some days I need to get out of this house so I'm going fishing so it's not really bad it's just when you lose your position as a Son of God and you get away from the word don't take a vacation from the word I'm going on vacation don't take a vacation from God and all everything you believe don't start wearing things that you wouldn't normally wear we're still a Christ on vacation right Glory so here they are and they I go a fish it and so they go out there and they fish all night and they don't catch anything brother Tom the master comes they didn't even know who he was they got so far away from him they didn't even know was Jesus yet but he says hey how's it going the fishing we've fished all night and haven't caught a thing sometimes it's that way and so we we're we're we really need some fish here we really need to you know that but we haven't got nothing listen when you choose to in your immaturity walk away from God and go do your own thing for a while don't ever expect God to bless what you're doing CU he knows how to get your attention and our God the creator of the fish can direct those fish away from your net come on can you say Amen you think you're gonna walk away from God or maybe take a vacation from God or maybe I'm going to be on the fence for a while I don't really know if I really believe this so I'm going to take a pause take a that's a let's take a pause from this relationship we're going to take a break from our relationship whatever that means and so you take a break from your relationship from the message from the word from Christ and all that listen God's got your number God knows how to get you he had Jonah's number when he ran away from the presence of the Lord and because he was a son can you say man he wasn't gonna get away from God God was gonna find him he will find you no matter where you go because his love did not go just because you measured up his love goes all the way until the end for your life and they do they we fished all night and God will not bless what you do when you're all in a a tizzy because of someone disappointing you what did the the Christian writers say here said that something's happened to you something has uh you know what she called it a heartbreak an offense somebody offended you or or you had a bitter moment why do we why do we distance oursel from God then sometimes because our spirit has been damaged by somebody hurting us but we don't need to run from God so they're not acting like disciples at all they're acting like Teenage believers you ever wonder how teenagers you know how they act it's it's amazing teenagers all due respect to you teenagers today you know I love you but teenagers have this characteristic that they want all the Privileges of an adult and they want to be treated like an adult but then they want to act like a 5-year-old sometimes not many amens especially from the teenagers but listen I've lived this out my dad said you haven't raised kids until you raised teenagers they are very unique they are very special I actually have ministered more to them around the world in my Ministry than anybody else I love the youth I like to be around them I like to stay young that's one of the reasons I like to be around the young people I like when they go through these stages but then when I went through my own I thought this is a challenge this is different dad you were right you haven't raised children till you raised teenagers because it's all up and down of emotions and everywhere and here and there and they want the Privileges of being an adult they want the car keys but the way they're acting you're scared to give them the car keys because they're acting like a child grow up a little bit I give you the car keys tough guy you know I'm in my room and you just come and get me I want to be showed some respect here I can bench 150 yeah pick up your [Applause] socks yeah yeah it's it's real and you know it's real that's why a lot of parents are laughing it's real okay it happens it's just the adst but listen I'm going over to the spiritual I won't say any more about teenagers because I love you to death but I'm going over you can go through a stage spiritually as teenagers and the discip IES were going through it and they were acting very embarrassing probably to the master but his love held true to him am and actually they didn't deserve but he said you know what turn bring your nets over to the other side and that was kind of crazy he always asks us to do something crazy can you say Amen from our mental no that's never going to work I've been a fisherman all my life just do what he says just do what God says cuz he'll ask us to do something very little that seems very crazy to the world but you better follow it cuz he's going to show you something he's going to show the disciples something that you can't ask me to bless anything that you that you have ran away from me and unless God is in your life nothing prospers the right way can you say Amen unless God is in your business and he's the priority in your life don't come and pray and ask us to pray that God Prosper your business true that God multiplies the fishes that but he they didn't deserve it but he's going to show them a lesson he says cast your nets on the other side all right they cast them over and then God supernaturally directs all those fish within a about a mile radius he directs all those fish by the power of the Holy Spirit here's sons that can't even be led by the Holy Spirit and fish are just being led by the Holy Spirit and they all come into Peter's net and they all get caught in there and they can't hardly bring it out of the water because there's so many fish listen everybody God is in control of your life and God can direct the fish he can direct a whale he can direct anything in your life and put his hand on it to cause you to mature as a Son of God because now he's in the work of maturing Sons through trials through tribulation through losses oh my from the age of 12 until 30 Jesus remains subject to his father and mother until the appointed time to begin his Heavenly father's assignment as a mature son hiis which is the last word here hiis they're ready for commissioning they're ready for commissioning does this sound like the pattern ministers follow today most often when some ministers begin to taste of the sweetness of God's anointing they never want to submit under anyone's Authority again sometime they don't care whether they are mature enough but once they know they have a calling and feel a radical Zeal to serve they just take off to fulfill it by failing to submit under a Spiritual Authority and waiting for the appointed time it is possible that one cannot sustain that fire and Zeal of their calling without a guardian even for a half a decade more like the prodical son in Luke 15 she it's a good point here friends is that it's a teenage thing I got a calling now I'm just going to run with it I'm going to go but you're not under the authority of a pastor you're not accountable to anybody I'm just going to go with this you're not submissive to the local church and in a body that doesn't work that way there is a maturity there's an accountability for God to identify your gift right it's not just that you can preach it's not just that you have a gift it's that can you mature into a full Son of God can you be under Authority can you be corrected if you got that attitude right way I know everything I've got a gift I'm a preacher now you've got that going on right away I might I'm not going to preach you that much because you're growing in the word you're growing in your gift but you're growing into maturity as well you can be corrected by the word of God I want you to notice can I have a little time today it's still good time here I want you to notice in the message if Paul preached those two things or three things then notice in the message how the prophet preaches all three of this all right here's this infant stage neither does the modern church this is in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 neither does this modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around her yeah yeah she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out uh put her out of their denomination they had one like that one in the churches why they throw her out right quick why are you letting such as that stuff go on so you see she's pregnated with something cuz she's pre bringing forth more members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that that she thinks they are that is the modern Church shame on any church that would put down the birth the birth is a mess can you say Amen you're born as a baby BBE can you say amen and you might get emotional in different ways and a birth Shane on on us if we become a modern Church where we put that out that is part of the work of the Holy Ghost it would embarrass her to keep her around it would ruin her in her educated ethical scientific Society churches belong to her they would throw her out as the next Council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth you get all starchy and say I don't want to hear any of that mess going on and that screaming and shouting somebody getting happy something wrong with you this he said this is the kind of word produces right I know I teach you here that everybody worships the different ways don't feel like well that person cuz they're dancing the aisles they got something they may not have got something we don't know we we can't assume what they get but don't you dare criticize it and you may have emotion you just joy in your heart happy that God's done something just standing there crying we all worship different can you say Amen but if we ever get this starchy Church in this box that we put that we don't want we need to create an atmosphere for birth to take place our children need to be born again you say well I don't want any emotional with you don't choose what you get with you say I just want the Lord and if he embarrasses me whatever happens I want him with all my heart so you have this and then when when the prophet was return referring to his dreams about the third pole you remember the first pole and he was fishing and he he put out a line and he was teaching these preachers how he did the gift and in the second pole discernment he was kind of teaching this is how you do it this is how you get the fish like that and he was rebuked by the angel of the Lord and it said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things things and he's trying to show him now when you get to the third poll don't try to teach this this won't be a public show don't tell the ministers what you're doing don't tell anybody else you know why because you can't teach Pentecostal babies real Supernatural things they are teenagers spiritually they're not wanting to grow into the third pole like a teenager wants all their privileges but wants to act CH childlike and behavior so so the pentec OST Les they want to stay in their baby form or their baby way with just emotion but they do not want to grow into real true Supernatural things in the same message we see in our message that God sent us we see adoption sermons the same message that says that you don't want those acts 238 miserable creatures being born in your church that way but in the same message we have messages of adopted Sons like why cry speak and go forward and like when I was listened to last night Paul a prisoner of Christ so he's the one that referred to himself in his letters Paul an apostle of Christ Paul he's got all these references to who he is and he's referring to himself what he did and all of them the rest of them sound glorious but when he came to Paul a prisoner he was was not referring to him being in prison which he was all the time he was saying I have come to the place that I willingly give up my free will because the prophet starts that message saying we all have a free will God doesn't override our free will we have a choice but then he goes on to this whole mystery of Christ saying I'm giving all that up my ambitions what I wanted to do that's all secondary to the will of God for my life and I become a slave a PR prisoner to the will of God and to his word and to everybody else's will as well because there was two things you can be swayed by your own will but you can be swayed by the family's will come on now familes coaching you to do something cousins and mother-in-laws and mothers and everybody you should do this you should this what you should do is listen to their counsel you should pray for the will of God because you can be swayed by their will instead of the will of God and a mature son comes to the place that Paul's giving it up saying I no longer want my own choice I want God's choice friends that's maturity I would ask the question if any of us are there this morning that we've completely come to a place of full surrender that the will of God is the word of God and I'm looking every day to find his perfect will for my life and if something comes up and hears his will and he's showing me and I have my own will at Battle I I lay down my own will and I take the word of God I no longer want my choice brother B says Sons and Daughters of God no longer want their own choice because they we see where it got us in the garden that's right so there's so much in it now with all these adoption messages that I've mentioned to you the Holy Ghost is put in us not to leave us as babies it's to mature us into Authority and character can you say that you can't can you can't preach just one one meaning to the sons you can't just preach one of these meetings you have to preach all of these CU all of them are in the scripture and all of them are in the message can I get an amen if I'm going to be a gospel preacher I have to preach all of these to be a right message preacher can you say Amen you can't just preach the birth side all the time you can't just preach the power of sons all the time you can't preach that young ones got the power if there's no repentance in their life no you can't say you've got power you've got power and they've never repented and they don't even have the Holy Ghost they don't even have salvation yet you can't tell them and they're up on the stage shouting and jumping that they got power if they haven't truly repented they don't have the power yet so don't tell them they have the power shouting everywhere saying we got the power we got the power you can't preach power of the Holy Ghost without preaching also the character the growth the maturity of the Holy Ghost for me a minister who leans towards preaching and teaching more about the op option side I know I'm that way I lean that thank God for other fivefold Ministry that preaches other things as well and we try to bring them in but you see now for a minister it's hard for me to say things because I lean more towards the adoption side I like to see people living what they're dancing about I like to people people walk out of here with something real something genuine can you say Amen it's not that you danced or shouted but deep down inside you really have a relationship with Christ and you have been delivered from from things it's hard to preach this way because you get criticism for it they think you're just leaning one way but I trust God that I'm not but it's hard to preach on this side because you're tired of the immaturities and you're wanting to see real genuine birth real genuine growth to maturity real genuine Supernatural lives preaching just the first two meetings preaching just the birth is a lot more exciting and you get a lot more response amen there are things that I can preach that would really encourage you and make you you see you can't just preach the things that preach good and make you feel good not when you're maturing Sons can't always do that maturity is what we look for maturity is where the Holy Ghost is taking us Power Authority but not without humility maturity and character what does it look like one Christian writer said maturity isn't about age can I take a minute and say just show what maturity looks like now what does it look like maturity isn't about age you can be a Christian for 50 years and still not be mature maturity isn't about appearance some people may look spiritually mature but they aren't just because someone appears dignified it doesn't mean they are holy maturity isn't about achievement you can accomplish much without being mature in your faith maturity isn't about academics a seminary degree or a bible college degree doesn't make you spiritually mature you don't get to be mature by comparing yourself to anyone else you become mature by comparing yourself to the word of God and this writer says the Book of James becomes almost a manual on how to be mature it gives five marks of spiritual maturity number one a mature person is positive Under Pressure dear brothers in James 1 when Troubles of any kind your way considered an opportunity for Great Joy when troubles come your way Lord help us to respond with joy in the midst of our trials this is going to be for my good I can't stand it I don't want it to go this way but I'm going to say Lord I bring my joyful heart before you because I know this will be for my good that takes maturity to do that Hallelujah just because you come you became a Christ follower doesn't mean you won't face troubles the question isn't whether you experience problems it's about how you respond to the problem s don't you do you get nervous do you get uptight do you get Negative do you Grumble you can be full of Bible knowledge and still be grumpy while Under Pressure oh Lord we'll take this rebuke you can be full of the message quotes and still be a grumpy person when a trial hit you number two a mature person is s sensitive to people James 2 says it is good when you obey the Royal law as found in the scriptures love your neighbor as yourself when children are immature they are completely self-focused I say that's true when children only think about theel they're not going to share that candy with somebody else they're not going to give it when children are immature they are completely self-focused but mature people don't just see their own needs they see the needs of others number three a mature person has mastered his mouth all of us make a lot of mistakes if someone doesn't make mistakes James says when he speaks he would be perfect he would be able to control everything that he does James 3:2 one thing doctors often say when you go for a checkup is stick out your tongue that's why I preached on last Sunday and doctors will say first thing stick out your tongue should we do that at the door when you come in on Sunday mornings stick out your tongue the doctor uses your tongue to check your health God does that spiritually too James 3 gives several illustrations regarding the tongue we can bridle horses we can put utter in the ship spark to a fire no one can tame the tongue it is an UNC uncontrollable evil filled with dead deadly poison what's he saying saying the same thing I said last Sunday is that when we our tongue has been brought un control of the Holy Spirit we are maturing into a Son of God number four a mature person is a peacemaker not a troublemaker what causes fights and quarrels among you James says in James 4 don't they come from your desires that battle within you when you're fussing and suing and you think it's the other person's problem no there's something battling inside of you because if you were at peace you wouldn't be fussing so much with everybody else come they not of your own Wars within yourself we all know Christians who make make trouble more than they make peace conflict isn't a Christian virtue in fact the opposite is true it's a sign of immaturity conflict all the time is a sign of immaturity James tells us selfishness and judgmentalism as the two biggest sources of conflict in our lives both of those things prevent us from Christlike maturity Jesus asked us to pursue Pride keeps us from admitting we're wrong judgmentalism puts us in the place of God Christian maturity means learning to say no to a selfish judgmental attitude that regularly causes conflict I say Amen number five a matur person is patient and prayerful because James says be patient unto the coming of the Lord see how the farmer waits for the land to yield his valuable crop patiently waiting for the autum and spring rains you two be patient stand firm because the Lord's coming is near patience and prayer go together as James 5 wrote It's a posture that farmers understand farmers do a lot of waiting you won't find any overnight crops we have to wait for God to work in our lives if you can't wait you can't be patient patience is the key element of maturity amen as you're trying to help people grow spiritually and seeing these things you see these are the marks of maturity and there's many many many more that I don't have to talk about you should research it in your own Bibles to realize this part of the Holy Ghost this adoption part this maturity part of adoption is so crucial to look at in the scripture say God where are my immaturities burn them out of me Lord grow me m mature Christians are try if you're trying to help people grow spiritually don't fall victim to trap into the Trap of thinking people in your church that just know the scripture are the most mature instead of look how God is changing their character ask yourself how does this person handle problems is this person sensitive and respectful to other people does this person manage his or her mouth right is this person a troublemaker a peacemaker does this person pray without giving up make decisions too hasty waits for direction of their father does nothing except the father shows him that's Jesus son who come to that place I do nothing except my father shows me that's where we need to come we act so hastily without prayer with okay we're going to go with it sons of God sett down and said now wait a minute let's pray about this there are a few decisions in life you have to make a quick decision you just pray but if you can most of your decisions get counsel go to the word of God and be patient and wait for God to put the green lights to it or the red lights to it I'm getting married I'm getting married put it to prayer you should pray more earnestly than you've ever prayed God will give you little green lights as if if this is the one that you're supposed to marry or he'll give you red lights and then you have to be honest and say this isn't the will of God mature Christians are correctable and teachable mature sons are not arrogant about their position and know their power is in the word and in Christ not necessarily in themselves so they lead by that word in their lives not emotion intimidation threats or complaining not led by money not led by demanding obedience from other people controlling by sheer will or force it sounds like many of ministers sometimes controlling by force or controlling by opportunity or privilege or personality controlling by your personality it's all immaturities and I tell you wish I had time all these things we see sometimes even our own ranks leaders leading controlling by privilege or by personality or by abusing The Authority they have as a pastor if they have the authority as a pastor which they do but they have immaturity they won't lead properly because they'll Abus their Authority mature Sons know that they are completely dependent on God and nothing else mature sons are truly led by God's Will and not their own will or their feelings or their emotions or their family's emotions mature Sons know that suffering is to teach them something to bring more of God's glory in them and they take joy in it can you say Amen now this last quote says and I want to bring in one more thing and I'm closing here we wonder today what why the gifts and things are not in the church operating the way they should be why the gifts are put in the church to separate well excuse me the gifts are put in the church to separate to take sin out to keep the Church clean it's God's toxin that gives the church it's his disinfectant that he puts into the church to kill out the parasites that tear up the church and God sprays his church over with his word are you glad for the word and the nine spiritual gifts it's to keep the church clean right and that keeps all the termites out you know so the church can grow a plant and God knows what to take to do it you say see it's just a little baby crying for a Razor when you're shaving your little baby was hollering give me that razor Daddy give me that razor your little son two or three years old just screaming jumping up and down on the floor give me the razor well you know better than to do that well you wouldn't give that baby that razor he doesn't know how to handle it that's the reason we don't find more Divine gifts than what we do it's not be the gifts aren't there sometimes just because people are quenching the spirit or people are preing ing against them or that can be that can be but he's saying the reason we don't find more Divine gifts now how many would say as a Christian I want to be used by and available for any of the nine spiritual gifts in the church and you realize you're not born with those a prophet is born a prophet but the nine spiritual gifts it can fall on you one time and never be used on you again that's why he said Pentecost fail because he said we're going to get together and pray this person has this gift this person okay we want to use these gifts it may be you may be used one time and that's it so you don't make it across theboard thing and then you're constantly looking for oh this person has a gift of tongu so we're looking we're hoping they'll speaking tongues as service completely go to 1 Corinthians 14 friends none of that is is the right Church order at all but we want God's gifts working through us and we want to be filled with the spirit ready and available for all nine available if if whatever God wants to use us for so what we're here for by the way it's only 12:40 I know it's what we're here for on Earth to be used by the Holy Ghost to do whatever he wants to do through us to see someone come to the kingdom to see some with a word of wisdom to see some with a Word of Faith to lay our hands on somebody I said last Sunday you don't have to wait the preacher comes through town and have him lay hands on you in healing line you can have your brother and sister next to you lay hands on you you can have your wife lay hands on you you see this is the way the prophet pointed us it's mature Sons it's not looking to the big preachers it's saying all Sons come to maturity I have the power in the name of Jesus that's the reason we don't want to find no more Divine guess what we do they push it off on some kind of a tradition over in some denomination they don't know how to handle it God knows what to do with it well you might say the little boy might say to you you refused him the razor say I see you handling it Daddy but see your older you know what to do with it so the the son saying I see another person he's handling it Daddy you're handling it I want it I want it I want it but you you see you're older you know what to do with it our father knows what to hand out as far as power to his people I want him to trust me if he never uses me or if he uses me I'm available but I want him to trust me as a mature son that I'll handle that sword of the word correctly that I don't take the sword of this word and start slicing people up with it but slicing the devil that I as a preacher is not using the word to slice up other message churches God forgive us God forgive us using the word to slice up everybody else I thought and and pushing the people to become in this big frenzy to try to speak against other messes churches I didn't know we were going to come to that but listen friends that's immaturity the sword God gave us in this message is not to use on one another on other preachers it's to use on the devil if you don't want to rile people up and get them excited get them The Sword and the word and that Holy Ghost to come against our enemy not one another and that's the way when the church becomes from a little baby toddling around to a real virtue of Sons and Daughters of God then things are going to be different yes sir the church ought to be acting as Sons and Daughters the message is full of all three things I want it all don't you yes but I emphasize to you today that Paul said let's grow up into him in all things let's let's not be children that are tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine and tossed by this and maybe you're tossed by you're feeding too much on social media and you're tossed by it there are things that'll plant seeds in your mind in there just for a second plant the wrong seed in your mind be careful of that because you could be tossed as a child we don't want to be children but he says exercising discernment he says he that uses milk and the word is unskillful in the word of God but meat belongs to those who have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil that's a mature Christian not going to watch that because I've learned that tears me down that's there's only two Spirits in this world right that's from the Dark Side not going to feed on that that's a mature Christian say well teenagers can't oh yeah a teenager can come that kind of maturity that they're making their own choices I don't feed on that stuff my mind's not a garbage can my mind belongs to almighty God and I stop it's not Daddy telling me to stop I stop because I'm that interested in his holy spirit leading my life that's mature choices mature choices and then when it comes to Doctrine just the every wind of Doctrine and you're swayed over here and then you're swayed over here and you're questioning here you don't need to live that way you live in the word of God and you'll have the discernment to know what's right and what's wrong and when you don't you say God I trust your hand to lead and guide me because like we saying we're holding to God's unchanging hand amen amen thank you Lord let's just pray together let's stand and pray take me deeper deeper in Love with You Jesus hold me close your Embrace take me deeper deeper than I've ever been before I just want to love you more and more how I long to be deeper in love take me deeper deeper in Love with You Jesus hold me close your Embrace take me deeper yes Lord deeper than I've ever been before I just want to love you more and more how I long to be deeper in love can we speak to him now Heavenly Father we are your sons and daughters and we know Lord that we have failed you so many times when we hear about these immaturities and these ways of thinking Lord and even the grumpiness sometimes Lord I come to we feel ashamed of oursel when we act that way Lord because we should be further along than that and you see that Lord but today we see the the image of the word in front of us the image of Christ in front of us we see where you lived out all the stages and you learned obedience by the things that's the one main thing you learn is how to be an obedient son how to follow the will of God how to not be motivated by just emotion or by what people wanted or what you wanted but you submitted your will to the heavenly father and Lord in that human experience that human part you lived out a life of Perfection and growing to Perfection and growing to maturity you lived it in front of us Lord and when we see that and when we see all of your s revealed we Sons and Daughters of God sit and say Lord that's what I want to be like that's what I want to be every day and we know Lord when we make a mistake we come to you run to you say forgive me Father help me not to act that way again help me to grow out of that thing Lord we will always come to you or we should but Lord you mold us you give us the trials and the and the challenges Lord that we need to mold us into Sons manifested Sons that we would know who we are and act that way in every circumstance for perfect Faith Masters every circumstance Lord I feel your Holy Ghost is moving in the people today bringing them something deeper and something real lord a greater dedication to you Lord a greater look and a focus on these things to rejoice when you move us to Rejoice to cry when you move us to cry to stand upon your word when we're called to stand to correct in love when we need to correct to speak the truth when we need to speak it Lord but mostly Lord to live in that inner place with you where we're content we're peaceful we're satisfied Lord and if we never get another blessing for you and never get anything else from you we are content Lord to be Sons and Daughters of God and as we preached about the gifts and all the things in the body that you can do may we be so available Lord and ready and willing and and and filled with your spirit father that at any moment we could be used of you father for any of these gifts I've said Lord that we want the giver more than the gifts but Lord we want it all we want The Giver of the gifts but Lord if you gave us gifts we want the gifts as well we want all that you have for us Lord forgive us and help us to walk into a deeper place with you we commit that to you Lord in this service this morning in Jesus name so take me deep deeper deeper in Love with You Jesus hold me close your Embrace sing it now Saints
