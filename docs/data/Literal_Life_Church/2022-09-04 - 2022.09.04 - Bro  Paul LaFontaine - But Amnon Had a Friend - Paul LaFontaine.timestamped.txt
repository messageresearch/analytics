[0:00] we'll read together and uh we just
[0:02] appreciate all of our
[0:04] visitors being with us this morning god
[0:06] bless you all some ones we haven't seen
[0:08] in a while and
[0:10] some others we don't know but we love
[0:12] you and appreciate you joining the
[0:13] fellowship with us this morning
[0:15] and though life may
[0:18] separate us sometimes
[0:20] we know that
[0:22] god is the same
[0:23] and we hold within us the word of the
[0:26] hour and the message and christ and when
[0:28] we come together we have that in common
[0:30] can you say amen
[0:31] second samuel samuel chapter 13.
[0:36] amen
[0:39] and it came to pass after this that
[0:42] absalom the son of david had a fair
[0:44] sister
[0:45] beautiful sister
[0:47] her name was tamar and amnon the son of
[0:49] david loved her
[0:51] and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick
[0:53] for his sister tamar for she was a
[0:55] virgin
[0:56] and amnon thought it hard for him to do
[1:00] anything to her
[1:01] but amnon had a friend whose name was
[1:04] jonadab
[1:05] the son of shemiya
[1:07] david's brother and jonah dabb was a
[1:09] very subtle man and he said unto him why
[1:13] art thou being the king's son lean from
[1:15] day to day will they not tell me and
[1:17] amnon said unto him i love tamar my
[1:20] brother absalom's sister and jonah dabb
[1:23] said unto him lay thee down on thy bed
[1:25] and make thyself sick and when thy
[1:28] father cometh to see thee say unto him i
[1:30] pray thee let my sister tamar come
[1:32] and give me meat and dress the meat in
[1:35] my sight that i may see it and eat
[1:39] it at her hand
[1:41] i'd like to add in a scripture here then
[1:43] in the new testament in the book of
[1:44] james chapter four
[1:46] and add this into our subject today and
[1:49] if we have it in our minds it would be
[1:51] good james
[1:52] over in the new testament james chapter
[1:54] 4.
[1:56] amen you love the lord this morning
[1:59] praise the lord i can tell that by the
[2:01] worship and expressing your heart to god
[2:03] that you're glad to be here james
[2:04] chapter 4
[2:06] here from whence come wars and fightings
[2:10] among you
[2:12] come they not hints even of your lust
[2:14] that war in your members
[2:16] ye lust and have not ye kill and desire
[2:18] to have and cannot obtain you fight and
[2:21] war
[2:22] and yet ye have not because ye ask not
[2:26] ye ask and receive not because ye ask
[2:29] amiss that ye may consume it upon your
[2:31] lust
[2:32] ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye
[2:34] not that the friendship of the world is
[2:38] enmity with god
[2:40] i want to talk a little bit about this
[2:41] this morning is that when we have a
[2:43] friendship with the world and by the way
[2:45] the world is a friendship in itself
[2:48] it's not just having friends of the
[2:50] world but actually the world
[2:52] expresses here the world can be a
[2:54] friendship to you other things can be a
[2:56] friendship that aren't necessarily a
[2:58] human being
[3:01] he said know ye not that the friendship
[3:02] of the world is an enemy the problem
[3:04] with the friendship of the world is it
[3:06] it makes you
[3:07] an enemy to towards god and it makes you
[3:09] at variance with god
[3:11] whoever whosoever therefore will be a
[3:14] friend of the world is the enemy of god
[3:17] james always says some things very very
[3:20] straight
[3:23] do you think that the scripture saith in
[3:24] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lust
[3:26] us to envy but he giveth more grace
[3:29] wherefore aren't you glad he giveth more
[3:31] grace
[3:32] he giveth more grace
[3:36] but he give him more grace wherefore he
[3:37] saith god resists that the proud but
[3:40] giveth grace unto the humble
[3:43] submit yourself therefore to god resist
[3:46] the devil and he will flee from you now
[3:49] just stop right there the theme being
[3:50] the friendship of the world and that
[3:53] friendship has a way of drawing you in
[3:55] but the the answer to it and by the way
[3:57] a friendship with the world will fail
[3:59] you every time that friendship will fail
[4:02] you every time how many has ever had a
[4:03] friendship fail you and so you know how
[4:06] you feel about that but this friendship
[4:08] will definitely fail so now we have
[4:10] failed friendship what's god's answer to
[4:13] a friendship that has failed something
[4:15] that has failed you even if it's the
[4:17] world or someone or whatever it is
[4:19] what's god's answer verse seven submit
[4:21] yourselves therefore to god
[4:23] resist the devil and he will flee from
[4:25] you and i like this one number eight
[4:28] it's verse eight draw nigh to god and he
[4:32] will draw nigh to you
[4:35] when we have broken friendships when we
[4:37] have broken things in life when things
[4:39] fail us
[4:40] it should lead us to draw nigh to god
[4:44] more than anything else
[4:46] it should draw us niar to the lord and
[4:47] when we draw nigh to him he draws nigh
[4:49] to us lord bless your word today anoint
[4:51] it we pray as we put our full confidence
[4:54] in you for every soul that's here and
[4:56] listening online we trust that you'll do
[4:58] it in jesus name amen god bless you may
[5:01] be seated
[5:10] you know i've been speaking about amnin
[5:11] a little bit and not so much the
[5:13] incident which is a very tragic incident
[5:16] that took place
[5:17] but the lessons that we learned from it
[5:19] and um
[5:21] to see the type of mind and the type of
[5:23] thought life and the type of
[5:25] uh today we want to speak on the
[5:27] influence of amnon because the friend he
[5:29] had i want to actually title this but
[5:31] amnon had a friend but amnon had a
[5:34] friend
[5:35] and i want to speak about him as we
[5:37] learn a lesson another lesson from him i
[5:39] wouldn't want to place any of you in the
[5:42] uh position of amnon or
[5:44] somehow make you feel that way but we
[5:47] have to be uh chris as christians we
[5:50] have to be mindful of the lessons within
[5:52] the scripture that we learn from a
[5:53] person like this especially when he
[5:55] grows up in the royal kingdom of david
[5:58] and when he grows up under that
[6:00] influence and that atmosphere then we
[6:02] realize that it's not a guarantee if you
[6:04] grow up in the right atmosphere that you
[6:06] wouldn't go off feeding on other things
[6:08] and your mind becomes tainted and that
[6:10] you have the potential to go into coming
[6:13] such an extreme thing as this someone
[6:16] within the royal family going this far
[6:18] as far as what amnon went it's all about
[6:21] the mind it's all about where satan can
[6:23] take you and it's not an unbeliever here
[6:25] it's some person that's grown up amongst
[6:28] the jehovah teachings and amongst the
[6:30] royal family and someone so great as
[6:33] david so we have to take the lesson from
[6:35] it to see
[6:36] how does his how did his mind get here
[6:39] how did all this take place how do we
[6:41] get to this happening within the kingdom
[6:43] of god it's all good lessons for us so
[6:46] that we can have the upper edge on the
[6:48] enemy in this hour so he cannot take our
[6:51] minds he cannot take our thoughts he
[6:53] cannot allow us to go too far and thus
[6:55] feeding on the wrong things until we
[6:57] rise to the occasion and say now wait a
[6:59] minute i am not ignorant of satan's
[7:02] devices i am not a statistic i am not
[7:05] like the rest of the world this mind is
[7:08] not like the rest of the world's mind
[7:10] i'm wanting to submit it and be renewed
[7:12] by the spirit of god can you say ma'am
[7:15] so i might say in laying a foundation
[7:17] for this this morning that the influence
[7:19] of other people as i'm titling this but
[7:21] amnon had a friend amna had a friend it
[7:24] was not a good friend but amnon had a
[7:26] friend he grew up in the things of god
[7:28] but he had a friend and the bible says
[7:30] he was a subtle friend he was not a good
[7:33] friendship he wasn't something good for
[7:35] amnin at all but he had this friend and
[7:37] everything could have went better except
[7:39] he had this friend
[7:42] and uh so now i want to break it down a
[7:45] little bit to say that the influence of
[7:47] other people on a human being is
[7:50] absolutely incredible the influence of a
[7:53] a another human being upon one human
[7:56] being to another it's incredible how
[7:58] influential another human being can be
[8:01] good or bad the influence of another
[8:04] human being on human beings is an
[8:06] amazing thing
[8:07] and today
[8:09] we don't really even need to know the
[8:11] person personally but they can strongly
[8:14] influence our life because of social
[8:17] media and because of being attached
[8:19] worldwide in the world wide web there
[8:21] can be a person that heavily influences
[8:24] us not only what we wear our mindset our
[8:27] political views our view of god we can
[8:30] be heavily influenced by another person
[8:33] and not even know them
[8:36] now that's quite a place that we've come
[8:37] to because usually in the old days you
[8:39] would have to be around a person you'd
[8:41] have to stay around requirement and then
[8:43] you realize they're starting to
[8:44] influence your mindset they're starting
[8:46] to influence the way you think about god
[8:48] it would take quite a bit more time but
[8:50] today it doesn't take a lot of time and
[8:52] actually you wouldn't actually call that
[8:54] person a friend but they become somewhat
[8:57] of a friend because they are influencing
[8:59] your life can you say amen and i'll just
[9:02] make this simple for the young people
[9:04] here today the young teenagers whoever
[9:05] you are one of the greatest things that
[9:08] you need to learn as a young person is
[9:10] that you're gonna have to make good
[9:12] choices for friends
[9:15] can you say man only you can make those
[9:17] choices but you're gonna have to early
[9:19] on learn there are good friends there
[9:21] are bad friends and you don't base upon
[9:23] their personality you don't base it upon
[9:25] that what they wear that they're rich
[9:28] you don't basically you you if you're
[9:30] trying to serve god then that person
[9:32] ought to respect you serving god and it
[9:35] would be best to choose friends that are
[9:37] serving god as well
[9:41] and why would i say that because
[9:43] friends and human other human beings can
[9:45] have such a strong
[9:47] influence on us not just as teenagers
[9:50] but as adults as well we don't realize
[9:53] how much we're influenced by other
[9:55] people
[9:57] good or bad can you say amen i have a
[9:59] lot of mentors in my life a lot of good
[10:00] influences in my life a lot of people
[10:03] that have been great influences and i'll
[10:05] not deny it i follow the christ that's
[10:07] in them the prophet of this hour is one
[10:09] of them i follow i don't follow a man i
[10:12] follow the christ that's in a man paul
[10:14] said follow me as i follow christ so
[10:16] there's not necessarily anything wrong
[10:17] with following a person but we must be
[10:20] choosy who we follow we are influenced
[10:22] by other human beings what they say what
[10:24] they do what they wear
[10:26] it's just we're built that way
[10:28] maybe that's why god said i'll come down
[10:31] and become flesh among men and i'll put
[10:34] myself in the people because god's
[10:36] mystery is to become flesh in human
[10:38] beings
[10:40] hallelujah
[10:42] so it can't be a bad thing to recognize
[10:44] the christ in one another not the
[10:46] humanness not the weakness but to
[10:48] recognize the christ in one another and
[10:50] i'm going to follow that christ you know
[10:53] every individual
[10:55] if you think this you can but none of us
[10:58] know everything about the lord
[11:00] none of us know it all i know there's
[11:02] some people that do feel like they know
[11:03] it all but none of us know it all as
[11:05] brother lonnie used to tell me no one
[11:07] preacher in this message has a full
[11:09] complete handle and revelation on this
[11:11] whole message also although some of them
[11:13] think they do but i don't they don't
[11:16] they don't have and that's why god set
[11:18] up not a one-fold ministry but a fifo
[11:20] ministry and then a many member body
[11:23] because christ is in every member of
[11:25] that body a portion of christ is in them
[11:29] and you can learn and grow by seeing
[11:32] that christ in another individual
[11:37] so
[11:38] you know but we can be influenced today
[11:40] by by other people and we don't even
[11:43] know that popular people
[11:45] stars
[11:47] uh beautiful people people that
[11:49] wear the right things and say the right
[11:52] things in our eyes and so we're
[11:53] influenced by them
[11:55] and men and women will mimic those
[11:57] people
[11:58] they'll repeat
[12:00] those people they'll take on the belief
[12:02] system of those people
[12:04] and never look at their character
[12:06] never look at the kind of person they
[12:08] are
[12:09] but that's how easily influenced we are
[12:11] is that we like what they say we like
[12:12] what they wear we want to dress that we
[12:14] want us to we want to be able to look
[12:16] like them and be beautiful like them and
[12:19] this is one of the downfalls of the of
[12:21] social media and these things is when
[12:23] someone has got a complex and are not
[12:25] found their position in the lord and
[12:26] their confidence the way god made them
[12:28] especially young girls they will keep
[12:30] looking to that and compare themselves
[12:32] constantly to something that's online
[12:35] compare themselves to that she's more
[12:37] beautiful than i am and so now next i
[12:39] want to be like that i want to dress
[12:41] like her i want to i want to wear makeup
[12:43] like because in my eyes that person's
[12:44] beautiful and i'm not in god's eyes
[12:48] god looks at beauty a different way
[12:50] god looks beauty on the inside
[12:53] god likes to see himself within you can
[12:54] you say man and that person from
[12:57] maryland monroe all the way down to uh
[13:00] jennifer aniston and all the new stars
[13:02] that we look at as being beautiful women
[13:04] that person may be empty on the inside
[13:06] as far as character and yet people
[13:09] thousands millions of people will follow
[13:11] them
[13:12] and and follow what they wear and just
[13:14] because why we're influenced by other
[13:16] human beings they don't even know who
[13:18] she is they haven't checked out her
[13:20] character
[13:23] amen
[13:24] so they take on their belief system
[13:26] because they're beautiful and so that's
[13:28] what happens first i want to address i
[13:30] want to act like them but then you take
[13:32] on their beliefs because now you trust
[13:33] them as being someone i can follow so
[13:35] now you take on what they believe oh
[13:37] they said this and they said this about
[13:39] god and they said that there's no such
[13:41] thing as god
[13:42] that god is whoever you make up you say
[13:44] so now now you're taking on their belief
[13:46] system
[13:48] because because influence
[13:51] and we judge we never even met them but
[13:53] we judge by the outward appearance or
[13:54] personality and we quickly accept people
[13:57] and copy them
[13:59] with no discernment
[14:02] brother william branham and if you're
[14:04] listening here
[14:06] on the broadcast
[14:07] they had a powerful ministry
[14:09] and it's gone just a few years before us
[14:11] he's passed on now but had a powerful
[14:13] ministry and we acknowledge that
[14:14] ministry here and you may hear me
[14:16] quoting from him a little bit but he had
[14:18] a wonderful message that he preached you
[14:20] might want to look it up and it's called
[14:22] the influence of another
[14:24] and i encourage our congregation to
[14:26] listen to that this week as well and
[14:28] incidentally he didn't just preach at
[14:30] one time he preached it six more times a
[14:33] matter of fact as near as i can see he
[14:34] preached influence message more than any
[14:36] other sermon that he preached
[14:39] the influence of another the most
[14:42] preached sermon that he had and i'm
[14:44] going to read from it a little bit later
[14:46] but it was to show us the power of
[14:49] influence of other people
[14:51] and and as opposed the to the influence
[14:53] of god because isaiah had formed a close
[14:56] friendship with the king uzziah they
[14:59] were buddies and
[15:01] uzziah was a great good influence a
[15:04] great good influence on isaiah the
[15:06] prophet this was but then but then
[15:08] afterwards and we'll speak of it a
[15:10] little bit later in the sermon but then
[15:11] afterwards that friendship failed in
[15:14] other words josiah got off track he got
[15:15] lifted up in pride and so this close
[15:18] bond between isaiah and uzziah failed
[15:21] because uzziah went away from god and he
[15:23] did the wrong thing so now that's a very
[15:26] difficult thing when you have someone
[15:27] you look up to some friendship that you
[15:30] look up to and you were so influenced by
[15:32] them but then it's all everything is
[15:34] taken out from underneath you the
[15:35] friendship's gone now you're having to
[15:37] make a choice who do i follow do i
[15:39] follow uzziah and his pride or do i and
[15:41] and the example the reason that the
[15:43] prophet preached out of that is to show
[15:45] us to show us that at that moment when
[15:48] friendships fail and you're having to
[15:51] make a choice you to follow
[15:53] isaiah said you know what i'm going to
[15:54] do i'm not going to escape and do
[15:56] another friendship i'm going to go to
[15:58] the temple and i'm going to pray and i'm
[16:00] going to look to god and when he went to
[16:02] the temple first when he got into the
[16:05] presence of the lord with this failed
[16:07] friendship god gave him a vision can you
[16:10] say amen
[16:11] and now he said i seen the lord now i
[16:14] see the lord he's high and lifted up and
[16:16] i will never put a friendship above how
[16:18] high the lord has lifted up in my life
[16:21] and when i have the lord i have
[16:23] everything
[16:24] [Applause]
[16:25] and if god blesses me with other
[16:27] friendships because brother brahm said
[16:28] he said friendships are a gift of god i
[16:31] only want the friendships that are a
[16:32] gift of god i don't want the friendships
[16:35] that i can myself but the
[16:36] friendships the true friendships are a
[16:38] gift of god so isaiah is saying lord
[16:41] it's kind of like abraham you know what
[16:42] said abraham in the book of james it
[16:45] said that he believed and it was not
[16:47] imputed it was imputed under
[16:49] righteousness this is real simple now
[16:51] abraham believed
[16:53] righteousness was attached and brought
[16:54] into his account he was righteous before
[16:57] god before he believed and the bible
[16:59] says and he was a friend of god
[17:06] see abraham making mistakes abraham did
[17:08] this abraham did that abraham did no all
[17:10] that gets washed away because why he
[17:13] believed
[17:14] he was counted righteous
[17:16] and he was a he he had a testimony he
[17:18] was a friend of god how many this
[17:20] morning would raise your hand and say
[17:22] when this is all over with the one thing
[17:25] i want
[17:26] is to be a friend of god
[17:32] you see we've complicated this message
[17:34] too much
[17:36] amen
[17:36] i'm going to say it again we've
[17:38] complicated and that's why paul when he
[17:39] comes this whole subject of
[17:42] subtility
[17:43] the serpent was more subtle than any
[17:45] beast of the field
[17:47] so he came to eve right subtle and then
[17:49] paul picks it up there in the new
[17:51] testament he says i fear lest by any
[17:53] means as the serpent beguiled the subtle
[17:56] serpent beguiled eve that he would take
[17:59] your minds away from the simplicity
[18:03] in christ
[18:06] and the simplicity of christ is the
[18:08] message of the hour see would you sure
[18:10] don't seem like it's because men's have
[18:12] messed it up men have tainted it
[18:14] men that have taken out of the bible can
[18:16] you say man men have made it some
[18:18] denomination i'm not attached to any of
[18:20] that although i get lumped in listen i
[18:22] know what this message is it's the
[18:24] message of christ for the last days to
[18:26] bring us back to bible truth and bible
[18:28] faith that we can live bible lives
[18:31] and have a friendship and oneness
[18:34] with god like no other people has ever
[18:36] had
[18:37] if this message has not brought you into
[18:39] a friendship and closeness with the lord
[18:41] personally yourself then you haven't got
[18:44] it yet
[18:46] simplicity
[18:48] our father abraham he believed
[18:52] righteousness was
[18:54] credited to his account
[18:57] because he believed how many want that
[19:00] and then he was a friend of god the
[19:02] message isn't any more complicated than
[19:04] that
[19:06] praise the lord that was that wasn't in
[19:08] my notes that was free i'd like to
[19:10] preach on that a while
[19:12] but the prophet showed in this message
[19:14] the power of influence of people and the
[19:16] influence as isaiah was influenced
[19:18] but it drove when the friendship failed
[19:21] and uzziah failed and this kid that was
[19:24] so praised and even brother branham
[19:27] praises him over and over again for his
[19:29] godliness as a king and taken the
[19:31] kingdom back to the things of god and
[19:33] just a young man but he was he had some
[19:35] holiness and some principle about him
[19:37] and he was praised and that's why izaiah
[19:39] was so attracted to him i've got a
[19:41] friendship with a fellow here and they
[19:42] fellowshipped around the word and and
[19:44] had a great influence on him but when
[19:46] someone like that fails you
[19:49] when that when a friendship like that
[19:51] fails and all of a sudden they deny
[19:52] everything that they and they just walk
[19:55] away from it and they get lifted up in
[19:56] pride and they step out of their
[19:58] position
[20:00] it has an effect on us
[20:02] and it should it
[20:04] and it should do what it did to isaiah
[20:06] to drive him to this real lesson that he
[20:09] went to the temple that we should never
[20:12] be
[20:13] more dependent on a human being
[20:17] than we are on god
[20:20] can i get an amen
[20:22] we should never be more dependent on
[20:24] another human being's influence
[20:27] than we are on god
[20:30] god's presence should be our strongest
[20:32] influence more than people
[20:37] if we can take on the
[20:39] the image and the words of another human
[20:41] being
[20:42] and not even know them not even know
[20:44] that person and just talk about the
[20:45] world a little bit here again the world
[20:47] we live in if we can take on the image
[20:49] and the words and dress like the person
[20:52] and take on their belief system and all
[20:53] of a sudden now they they get a
[20:55] credibility we're online and they start
[20:58] uh they start bashing the the message of
[21:01] god and start saying all this stuff and
[21:03] think they got it all figured out and
[21:04] they start doing it and all of a sudden
[21:06] when they do it also they have such a
[21:07] strong influence that your influence and
[21:09] those seeds have been planted in you and
[21:11] we take on that image and take on the
[21:13] words of another human being sometimes
[21:15] we don't even know them we don't know
[21:16] their lives they live we don't know
[21:18] their resentment we don't know where
[21:20] they come from we don't know the reasons
[21:21] why they've turned against christ the
[21:23] word
[21:25] if we live in that world then maybe
[21:27] we're losing our definition
[21:29] of what a real friend is
[21:33] and i believe we are i believe we
[21:35] literally
[21:35] live in a world we're losing a
[21:37] definition of what a real friend is and
[21:38] how to choose the right one
[21:40] i think the definition of friend has
[21:42] been watered down
[21:44] we make choices now to follow somebody
[21:47] that we don't even know
[21:50] to friend somebody that we need to know
[21:53] following and friending somebody is just
[21:55] a click of a button now you're going to
[21:58] tell me friendships have been watered
[22:00] down
[22:01] friendships have been watered down
[22:03] think about it now
[22:04] you by a click of a button you don't
[22:06] have to know them you don't have to know
[22:08] their lifestyle every day by a click of
[22:10] a button i'm going to friend that i'm
[22:11] going to follow that person really it's
[22:13] that easy for you to follow somebody
[22:19] i'm going to friend somebody i'm going
[22:21] to follow them and then the other thing
[22:23] is i'm going to unfriend somebody now so
[22:25] it's just like you know if friendships
[22:27] can within hours can change
[22:32] i've been unfriended and i'm not even on
[22:34] there
[22:40] you say well this came out when social
[22:42] media and facebook came out no
[22:43] for years preaching the true message and
[22:45] the balance of the message i have been
[22:47] unfriended some sundays and we didn't
[22:50] have social media i was just unfriended
[22:52] after that sermon
[22:54] i know what it feels like that's how
[22:56] quickly they're unafraid they're being
[22:57] oh their body is with you and
[22:58] everything's okay we support you we're
[23:01] yeah praise the lord we're and all of a
[23:02] sudden everybody go they go silent you
[23:04] know because because they've been taught
[23:06] that if i want to i'm friends with that
[23:08] person i friended them now i can
[23:10] unfriend them
[23:12] and we're being taught loose shallow
[23:14] friendships
[23:15] it doesn't have to be face to face
[23:17] anymore you don't have to ever see them
[23:19] and you're they're your friends
[23:24] praise the lord
[23:26] block someone
[23:29] to ditch someone
[23:31] and it's all based on whatever we feel
[23:33] at the time i think friendships should
[23:35] go deeper than that
[23:37] i think true friendships that are
[23:38] intimate friendship should go deeper
[23:40] than just our feelings
[23:44] what gets lost is the true meaning of
[23:46] what a friend's a friend is and how to
[23:48] choose the correct type of friend
[23:50] the the top people to follow on tick
[23:53] tock are called
[23:54] incidentally
[23:56] prophet was way ahead of his time
[23:58] it's a tick tock influencer that's the
[24:01] top people it's the most looked at it's
[24:03] the most popular it's a tick tock
[24:06] influencer
[24:08] the prophet was right in line wasn't he
[24:11] because they've named it what it is
[24:14] they they make millions of dollars
[24:15] because they then the tick tock
[24:18] tick-tock
[24:19] top
[24:21] influencer they call it what it is
[24:24] they have the strongest influence
[24:27] and most of the people on tick-tock
[24:28] don't know that person's lifestyle they
[24:31] well they do know their lifestyle but
[24:32] they don't know them as a person they
[24:34] don't know what they stand for
[24:36] and yet they're the top
[24:38] influencer in millions of lives how does
[24:40] that happen
[24:42] how does that work what kind of world
[24:44] does satan brought up to us here
[24:53] relationships
[24:56] become really shallow these days
[25:00] one uh study said social media social
[25:03] networks and you say brother paul seems
[25:05] like you're mentioning social media and
[25:07] networks every sunday now
[25:11] i'll get off of it eventually
[25:15] and i think they have their place just
[25:16] like a lot of other things have their
[25:18] place
[25:19] but if if science and articles are
[25:21] coming out of the huge damage that's
[25:24] being done
[25:25] then i'm not allowed to talk about it
[25:27] because it ain't their articles that i
[25:29] know the devil can be behind that just
[25:31] like tv and movies to drain a christian
[25:34] of his spiritual strength and so the
[25:36] same quotes that brother brahm talked
[25:37] about television is the same ones we
[25:40] should take in any media fourth
[25:42] dimension thing can be used of the devil
[25:44] to weaken you spiritually and channel
[25:47] channel channel spirits into your life
[25:50] channel why are they called channels on
[25:52] the tv because they channel spirits
[25:56] you'd never go to some kind of witch
[25:58] doctor and channel some that we don't
[26:00] believe in that kind of thing with
[26:02] channeling but people do it every day
[26:03] with their tv it's channeling spirits
[26:05] into their home
[26:07] which channel
[26:11] see it's all updated it's all highly
[26:13] tech now 50 years ago i could talk about
[26:15] going to a witch and channeling somebody
[26:17] and we said oh god a christian would
[26:19] never do that but it's all updated now
[26:21] and channeling spirits now has become
[26:24] easy to do on your phone
[26:27] there ought to be more amen than this
[26:29] because you know i'm telling the truth
[26:35] but one of the articles said social
[26:36] networks like facebook twitter and
[26:38] instagram make regular users more
[26:41] shallow and less moral
[26:43] according to a new study by
[26:45] psychologists it makes it makes users
[26:48] more shallow and less moral because
[26:51] social media sites often lead to fast
[26:54] and short responses
[26:57] it is killing the art of reflective
[27:00] thought
[27:02] it is killing it is numbing the brain it
[27:05] is quick it's a quick answer that's why
[27:08] don't text me something serious to my
[27:10] phone if it's a serious nature i'm not
[27:12] going to text you back i do it face to
[27:14] face because satan can so misinterpret
[27:17] text back and forth to each other in
[27:18] social media can you say amen
[27:21] devil doesn't like a face-to-face
[27:22] relationship devil doesn't like to and
[27:25] so now he can use these things and
[27:26] that's it kills reflective thought and
[27:29] we're not supposed to be numb brains
[27:31] that don't have reflective thought we're
[27:33] supposed to stand and try james said
[27:36] first john says try
[27:38] every spirit
[27:40] test every spirit can i get an amen i'm
[27:44] i'm quoting the bible we're not numb
[27:46] skulls we're not gullible people we
[27:49] don't let everything in that we don't
[27:51] reflect on what's coming in but we use
[27:54] discernment every thought
[27:56] every imagination has to be going
[27:59] through a test to check it whether it's
[28:01] of god or not
[28:03] social media kills reflective thought
[28:06] and it kills deep relationships and
[28:09] makes you a surface relationship person
[28:14] and then betrayal is everywhere
[28:16] friendship's betrayed
[28:19] we have more friends than we've ever had
[28:21] but more shallow less deep relationships
[28:24] we have thousands of friends my wife has
[28:26] three
[28:28] thousand see you got three thousand
[28:30] friends
[28:32] how does that work three thousand and i
[28:34] my next question i just i just asked i
[28:36] don't say it to cause uh
[28:38] you know we won't have arguments we have
[28:41] uh intense moments of fellowship
[28:48] it's a joke it's okay to laugh
[28:50] some of you just can't happen anyway
[28:53] i sent you i said no out of those three
[28:55] thousand how many of those people do you
[28:57] know they're your friends how many do
[28:58] you know
[29:00] and she told me the other night i know
[29:01] all of them
[29:03] so praise the lord
[29:05] i can't preach on you then
[29:08] that's pretty good
[29:10] and she said anybody i don't know i
[29:12] block them out they they can't be friend
[29:13] well that's the way to do it i believe
[29:15] that's the way to do it
[29:16] but we have a lot of friends more
[29:19] friends that's what the article says
[29:20] there's more we have more friends than
[29:22] we've ever had
[29:23] and yet and yet
[29:25] more shallow less deep relationships
[29:28] more friends than we ever have and more
[29:30] loneliness and suicide
[29:35] because maybe something's wrong with
[29:38] these type of friendships
[29:43] loneliness is gripping
[29:45] even believers sometimes just outright
[29:47] loneliness i don't have a friend in the
[29:49] world you don't well you got that many
[29:50] on your facebook is so something's wrong
[29:52] with the friendship
[29:55] something's wrong with friendship
[29:58] trust is broken
[30:00] satan exploits our pure desire and
[30:02] thirst for friends how many knows does
[30:04] pure desire to have a friendship
[30:06] god gave you a desire to have good
[30:07] friends
[30:08] it's a pure wholesome desire god gave
[30:10] you but satan exploits it and he points
[30:13] us to the wrong type of friends i want
[30:14] to say that because of betrayal because
[30:16] of loneliness people feel their desire
[30:19] for friendship in social media in video
[30:21] games in movies
[30:23] and other things they're not close to
[30:25] anyone so they escape into books into
[30:28] movies into phones because they don't
[30:30] have any close relationships they
[30:32] continue with their loneliness and
[30:34] continue and when they do that they
[30:35] really don't need people anymore they
[30:38] don't need to be in the word anymore
[30:40] there's hours spent playing video games
[30:43] and guess what that becomes your friend
[30:49] my friends
[30:50] friends
[30:52] you know i got to be your friend because
[30:54] i am crazy to get up and say this stuff
[31:02] you don't have that many friends but
[31:03] this device or this thing becomes
[31:07] your friend
[31:09] almost a marriage and i speak from
[31:11] experience of family members who's so
[31:13] caught up in video games their marriage
[31:15] is destroyed but because their marriage
[31:17] has become that video game
[31:20] animals are more important than people
[31:22] today
[31:24] and i wouldn't knock animals
[31:26] i wouldn't do that for nothing the
[31:27] prophet had close animals to him he said
[31:29] they're going to be on the other side
[31:30] i'm not against them at all if i find
[31:32] the right one someday i might have an
[31:34] animal friend
[31:36] one that
[31:38] doesn't
[31:39] pee on the floor in my house
[31:42] but
[31:43] i'm not against animals you know being
[31:45] close to them and i'm not against that
[31:47] people think i am
[31:48] dogs are questionable but other animals
[31:50] are okay
[31:52] no
[31:53] but but listen now something's wrong
[31:56] when the animals i had a lady tell me 15
[31:58] years ago she said i don't like people
[32:00] she was in my church i don't like people
[32:02] i don't want to be around people i just
[32:04] like to be home with my
[32:06] i don't know what animals she had but i
[32:08] just i like being around them more than
[32:10] i like being around the church people i
[32:12] was 15 years ago so i just left that one
[32:14] alone
[32:17] but to me i always reflect and say
[32:19] something's wrong
[32:21] when our relationships have become so
[32:23] damaged and we don't trust anybody
[32:25] anymore
[32:27] that we pour
[32:28] everything that we're supposed to be
[32:29] pouring into family and the family of
[32:32] god
[32:33] into an animal
[32:35] is that okay
[32:38] and then one preacher said in his
[32:39] testimony that he was a latch key kid
[32:42] and he was lonely as ever his father
[32:45] died
[32:46] and
[32:48] his father died and his mom had to work
[32:51] and so as a young teenager he's a
[32:54] latchkey kid come home from school his
[32:56] mom was never home through the evenings
[32:57] he come in himself and so he was the
[32:59] loneliest child ever and
[33:02] you know how many knows that home means
[33:04] more than just the house
[33:06] home is your relationship
[33:08] you could have a house and have the
[33:09] nicest house and not have home
[33:12] you see so he said about it this was his
[33:14] testimony he said after years of being
[33:17] addicted to video games and pornography
[33:21] he said i realized that i didn't have a
[33:24] real home and so pornography
[33:27] and video games became my home
[33:31] because we all have to have a home god's
[33:34] built us to have a place to have a home
[33:37] to have acceptance to have love can you
[33:40] say man to to be praised and so now
[33:43] you've got nobody around to praise you
[33:44] well if you win
[33:46] enough levels in the video game you're
[33:48] going to be praised it'll splash under
[33:50] yeah you're awesome
[33:56] and that woman in the pornography that
[33:58] woman is is is trained to look at you in
[34:02] a way and she's looking at you in porn
[34:04] and this is why a lot of men turn
[34:06] towards it because
[34:08] men have that within them that god put
[34:10] within that that they want a woman to be
[34:12] able to give them affirmation and to
[34:14] build them up brother bram said nobody
[34:16] can affect a man like a woman can when
[34:18] he comes in tired from working from the
[34:20] day her words her sweetness her support
[34:22] and all that it affects a man like no
[34:24] other thing can affect him well if he
[34:25] don't get enough of that all of a sudden
[34:27] now in lust in lust it isn't right but
[34:30] he turns because that woman is looking
[34:32] at him saying i want you
[34:34] you want me
[34:36] i want you her eyes say i want you
[34:39] she she and i don't go into details but
[34:42] listen they say psychologically that's
[34:45] what's happening too
[34:48] there's a craving
[34:49] a woman wants me that's that's an
[34:52] absolute lie she doesn't want him she
[34:54] doesn't even know him
[34:57] he doesn't even know her that's the trap
[34:59] of the enemy can you say amen it's a
[35:01] it's a it's a devilish spirit that comes
[35:04] on you to take a a substitute like that
[35:08] to a god-given fountain to drink from of
[35:11] your own wife
[35:13] come on i should get greater amens than
[35:14] that brothers
[35:16] shame on us
[35:17] may god fill us with his spirit and not
[35:20] turn to those things but sometimes it's
[35:22] that that eye that says i i i want you
[35:25] and he's not getting enough of that
[35:29] is anybody listening this morning and so
[35:31] he's looking for home he's looking for
[35:33] something that's home he don't have a
[35:35] home he only gets criticized at home he
[35:38] only gets put down at home so now he's
[35:40] craving for home and that's an
[35:42] absolutely terrible place to turn to but
[35:44] the craving is for home for for
[35:46] normality for for to be to be uh
[35:49] acknowledged to be
[35:51] appreciated is anybody listening here
[35:54] and so he finds home and this brother
[35:55] said i didn't realize so many years and
[35:57] he was delivered of it that the video
[35:59] games and the porn became home to him
[36:01] because he didn't have a home
[36:04] what a terrible replacement
[36:07] for the real thing of what a home should
[36:09] be
[36:12] as i've been preaching if you pour
[36:13] yourself into that stuff it's so subtle
[36:17] i wonder if it becomes
[36:19] a subtle friend like amnon's
[36:22] subtle friend and that's why i read the
[36:24] scripture
[36:25] but amnon had a friend so we'll pick him
[36:27] up
[36:28] we're wondering what is what is the
[36:30] answer of why a boy in the royal family
[36:33] would carry out such an act
[36:36] and we've been speaking about that that
[36:38] the sexual standards were actually
[36:40] lowered within the kingdom starting with
[36:42] david last sunday if you want to listen
[36:43] to it it started with david david fully
[36:46] repented i thank god for his repentance
[36:48] and not only his repentance but he he
[36:50] changed and he changed in a lot of ways
[36:52] i could preach on to show that but i did
[36:54] if you want to listen to it last sunday
[36:56] because amnon was three chapters later
[36:58] amnon was a severe case but it started
[37:01] with this whole thing of sexual
[37:02] standards lowering by the father and by
[37:05] the king and it began to permeate
[37:07] throughout the kingdom and that's one of
[37:09] the reasons amnan turned to these things
[37:11] and then i spoke about amnon's mind
[37:13] given over to event to get around the
[37:16] standards and that's why we find this
[37:18] incident that he's sitting there vexed
[37:20] with a lustful spirit not love but a
[37:22] lustful spirit towards this beautiful of
[37:25] the half-sister of tamar in the other
[37:28] kingdom and a lustful spirit takes hold
[37:29] and his mind is full of things and but
[37:31] the last thing he's thinking is that how
[37:33] can i get around the standards i can't
[37:35] get to her because there's a few
[37:37] standards in place and she has
[37:38] principles and we have principles here
[37:40] and i can't get my way around the
[37:43] standards that's been taught to have her
[37:46] like i want to have her
[37:49] but here is another answer as to how it
[37:52] actually took place and the standards
[37:55] were overridden it's very revealing and
[37:58] it's just simply this
[38:00] he had a friend in his life but he was
[38:03] the wrong friend
[38:08] how did standards get compromised
[38:11] the wrong friendships
[38:13] the wrong influences
[38:16] amnon could could never get around the
[38:18] barriers to have this girl
[38:21] but
[38:24] he had another influence in his life
[38:27] he might have made it through this
[38:29] incident but
[38:30] the whole incident would have not
[38:32] happened
[38:34] but
[38:35] he could have got the got on the right
[38:37] track
[38:38] but and that's why i want you to
[38:39] remember this is the title but amnon had
[38:42] a friend because all this would have
[38:44] been different but but
[38:47] there was another influence in amnon's
[38:49] life that he allowed in his life that
[38:51] was the wrong influence and everything
[38:53] could have stayed in place but
[38:56] amnon
[38:57] had a friend
[39:01] sounds like people who have it all
[39:03] they have all the right upbringing
[39:05] sometimes but
[39:08] they were raised in the message raised
[39:10] in the faith
[39:12] but what happened a friend
[39:16] and i'm i'm asking them to put this in
[39:18] the title sister genie
[39:21] but amnon had and i want parentheses
[39:23] friend because this was not a friend
[39:30] a person has all the upright uh right
[39:33] upbringing but
[39:35] a friend
[39:36] he could have went on with the lord
[39:39] that young brother but
[39:41] he could have he could have made some
[39:42] changes and got things straightened out
[39:44] but
[39:46] she was doing so good and she was coming
[39:48] along and she was going on with the lord
[39:51] but
[39:52] there was another influence
[39:54] that she wouldn't cut off
[39:58] everything could have been changed but
[40:01] let's apply it to our lives
[40:03] we're headed in the right direction but
[40:05] it's like brother gideon preached the
[40:07] other the other night a couple wednesday
[40:09] nights ago is that is that god wants to
[40:11] lead us to remove the hindrances can you
[40:14] say amen to remove the hindrances so we
[40:17] can get to the next victory we can't get
[40:19] to the next victory unless we say lord
[40:21] remove the hindrances in my life and
[40:24] many people could have moved on even
[40:26] older people that's been in the message
[40:28] for years they're stunned they stopped
[40:30] right there in their growth
[40:32] they would have went on but but
[40:35] there's something there in their lives
[40:38] there's an influence and most of us
[40:40] don't even know what it is but they
[40:41] can't move on because
[40:44] there's another influence
[40:47] praise be to god
[40:49] they would have got the victory but
[40:52] she would have got the victory but she
[40:54] likes her old friends he likes
[40:56] his old friends his old friends from
[40:58] college
[41:00] my buddies
[41:02] i got to go be around him
[41:04] miss church go be around her that's my
[41:06] buddies that's my pals
[41:08] could have went on with the lord but
[41:11] the wrong friends
[41:14] amen
[41:18] and so
[41:22] amnon and uh this boy
[41:25] had become bud somehow he was in the
[41:26] royal family
[41:30] this boy wasn't in the royal family but
[41:32] he was he was distant cousins they say
[41:35] but he wasn't necessarily in the royal
[41:37] family so he had a friend that wasn't in
[41:38] the royal family but they become friends
[41:41] he they become friends together but the
[41:44] bible says he was subtle and no one
[41:46] picked up on this kid
[41:48] no one picked up on his subtility
[41:51] not even amnon
[41:55] and you know the story as i read it he
[41:57] gave him the idea of how to seduce
[42:00] tamar and bring her in it was the friend
[42:02] that gave him the idea because he
[42:03] couldn't come up with it himself
[42:07] a lot of stuff we would be shielded from
[42:08] but we got some voice we're listening to
[42:12] that's given us ideas how to get around
[42:14] god's boundaries
[42:16] somebody's quoting some denominational
[42:18] form of scripture get us around the
[42:20] dress standard
[42:23] some subtility as the serpent
[42:26] beguiled eve and the serpent was more
[42:28] subtle than any beast of the field he
[42:29] wasn't quoting let's go to the world
[42:31] let's party let's put our pants on let's
[42:33] put our short skirts on let's just go do
[42:35] it
[42:36] the serpent was not saying that
[42:38] he was quoting the word
[42:41] that's what made him subtle and people
[42:44] every day are online misquoting the
[42:46] scripture misquoting things for the
[42:48] agenda to destroy the value of what our
[42:52] restorative prophet brought us back to
[42:54] in every way can you say amen and you'll
[42:57] call him a friend that's not your friend
[42:59] can you say a man it's out to destroy
[43:02] your life and your confidence in god
[43:06] hallelujah excuse me
[43:10] so it was presented to amnon and i'm not
[43:12] going to speak much longer on him and i
[43:13] want to change this to a to kind of a um
[43:16] a more positive theme but it was
[43:18] presented in how to get around the
[43:20] boundaries and just know it when it's
[43:23] that
[43:24] spirit that is getting you around your
[43:27] standards it's wrong to start with
[43:30] anything contrary to the word is your
[43:32] enemy
[43:36] you want to be a christian
[43:39] you want to be baptized repent be
[43:40] baptized be filled with the spirit
[43:42] listen now
[43:43] anything against the word because now
[43:45] you're identified with the word
[43:47] in any little voice that aligns itself
[43:49] against the word
[43:51] that's your enemy
[43:54] and he may be speaking it through a
[43:56] friend
[43:57] but anything against this word
[43:59] is your enemy
[44:03] one writer said now he didn't go along
[44:05] with all this but he said if you want to
[44:06] learn how to choose the right friends
[44:08] you have to choose the right enemies
[44:12] but i'll just say it this way because
[44:14] we're to love our enemies right
[44:16] we're not to compromise with them but
[44:18] we're going to we're going to love with
[44:19] the love of christ everybody but if you
[44:21] want to choose the right friends
[44:23] you've got to know who your enemy is
[44:25] first
[44:27] you'll never choose the right friends
[44:29] unless you know who your enemy is
[44:31] and that's the devil
[44:33] and how he can use
[44:35] to pull you down and to pull you into
[44:37] plant seeds of doubt in your mind you
[44:39] got to know your enemy is subtle can you
[44:41] say amen we must realize in order to
[44:44] have friends you must know how subtle
[44:45] your enemy is and james 4 as we read it
[44:48] at the beginning the world can be a
[44:50] friend too we don't realize that but
[44:52] from whence comes wars ye lust you kill
[44:54] you desire to have and the adulteresses
[44:57] and altars know ye not that the
[44:59] friendship of the world i'm in james 4
[45:01] and verse 4
[45:03] know you not that the friendship of the
[45:04] world is enmity with god
[45:06] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[45:08] the world is an enemy of god i tell you
[45:10] i don't want to be an enemy of god i
[45:12] don't want to be positioning myself
[45:14] that i would become an enemy to god that
[45:16] i'm working against god i want
[45:17] everything to work that he can work in
[45:19] my life but when i align myself with the
[45:22] friendship of the world which the world
[45:23] is a friendship too you put yourself as
[45:26] an enemy to god nothing's going to come
[45:28] together to work and you say man
[45:31] so the world is an enemy
[45:33] and it is
[45:34] it is to put you at enmity with god and
[45:37] then you watch the other relationships
[45:39] unravel and things that used to be close
[45:41] family members and all that it just
[45:42] makes such a tense thing because now you
[45:44] become a friend and by the way when
[45:47] friends as i said it's all you know
[45:49] friends are really it's really weird
[45:51] today what young people say we're just
[45:53] friends
[45:59] and
[45:59] they're doing things and i'm going
[46:01] i never did that as a friend to a girl
[46:03] you know
[46:05] friendship is changing its meaning
[46:07] all the time but but you know the thing
[46:09] is is that you cannot be a total friend
[46:12] with somebody but you can be flirting
[46:14] with them
[46:18] you haven't been with them but you're
[46:19] flirting with them and i just want to
[46:21] bring it to the world now you may not be
[46:23] out in the world but you can flirt with
[46:25] the world
[46:29] and a lot of times for years people can
[46:31] be flirting with the things of the world
[46:32] just flirting with it just like when in
[46:35] a in a a man who's flirting with a woman
[46:38] at the office and she's flirting with
[46:39] him nothing's really happened yet
[46:41] they're just flirting but you're on your
[46:43] background
[46:45] so some evangelist needs to preach a
[46:47] sermon about flirting with the world
[46:49] you're not in the world yet
[46:52] you haven't given yourself fully the
[46:53] world you're still coming to church but
[46:55] privately you're you're flirting with it
[46:59] that's why they post those pictures you
[47:01] know
[47:03] my wife sent me something that said all
[47:05] these girls you know they're in a ball
[47:07] game they're all doing selfie selfies
[47:09] and the thing says if you i should have
[47:11] put it up here today if you would take a
[47:14] selfie
[47:16] of your soul
[47:19] would people be attracted to it
[47:26] praise the lord
[47:29] so you must purpose young people
[47:31] everyone you must purposely you can
[47:32] never have a close intimate relationship
[47:34] with someone who rejects your christ
[47:38] if they reject him
[47:39] they really reject you
[47:42] i know that's straight but think about
[47:44] it
[47:45] friends are ones that lead you closer to
[47:47] god not further away
[47:49] but i want to take this a bit deeper
[47:50] because i could talk and the lesson
[47:53] today is not just that we should choose
[47:54] the right friends that's very important
[47:56] all of us need to learn that and most
[47:59] older ones have learned it because
[48:00] they've chosen bad friendships when they
[48:01] were teenagers on you learn and our i
[48:04] praise god for our teenagers let's not
[48:06] beat them up let's not be too critical
[48:08] of them they go through stages they have
[48:09] to learn things can you say amen they're
[48:11] going to stumble and fall sometimes can
[48:14] i get an agreement
[48:15] we we hold the standard in front of them
[48:17] we hold the things and people call us
[48:19] strict here we hold it in front of them
[48:20] but there's no lack of love for our
[48:22] young people then going through their
[48:24] different things they have to learn some
[48:25] things to avoid pitfalls we love them
[48:27] for to avoid some things but some things
[48:29] they're going to fall into they're going
[48:30] to learn i've formed this friendship
[48:32] online and now my life is a mess they
[48:35] have to learn that sometimes but the
[48:36] older ones we've learned listen choose
[48:38] your friends
[48:40] choose the ones can you say amen you be
[48:42] an outreach and christ to an unbeliever
[48:45] but but you you don't you choose your
[48:47] friends out of unbelievers
[48:52] you learn it after a while can you say
[48:54] amen but this is not a lesson about
[48:56] choosing the right friends although
[48:58] that's important the story of isaiah
[49:01] says that he had a buddy who was he was
[49:04] so close to and he was a good friend and
[49:07] it was a godly young fellow so it's a
[49:09] bit of different story that the
[49:10] prophet's bringing here in influence
[49:12] that this was such an influence on
[49:14] isaiah and it wasn't a bad influence to
[49:16] start with it was a godly connection it
[49:18] was a they fellowship around the word
[49:20] they had the word in common and then
[49:22] what happened to his friend through
[49:24] isaiah for a loop as it was and then is
[49:27] when the prophet goes into uh i'm
[49:30] talking about the prophet of the style
[49:31] goes into this message of influence and
[49:34] the power of being around the right ones
[49:36] because he talks he elaborates on this
[49:39] subject of influence and he goes into
[49:42] homes and families and he goes into this
[49:44] first quote talks about family and
[49:46] parents and the influence the
[49:48] opportunity to get your kids around the
[49:50] right influences and to create the right
[49:53] influence in your home
[49:55] they may not ever get that opportunity
[49:58] so you parents got to get them around
[50:00] the right influences and you've got to
[50:02] have your home the right influences
[50:04] because they may nev they'll make their
[50:06] choice someday but they may never get
[50:08] that opportunity again like they get it
[50:09] when they're young
[50:11] but influence is so powerful he says
[50:13] here in influence of another you know
[50:15] what i think everybody has their own
[50:16] opinion but one of the greatest and to
[50:18] my opinion the greatest president that
[50:19] we ever had in this nation was abraham
[50:21] lincoln not because he was a republican
[50:23] but because he was a godly man and he
[50:25] was raised to serve god and said if
[50:27] there's anything that i want to give
[50:28] praise to he said or my life was
[50:30] influenced by was a godly mother who
[50:33] taught me to pray and to know jesus as
[50:35] my savior oh your family is what you are
[50:39] you raise your child in a certain
[50:40] environment it's got 98 percent better
[50:43] chance to go right than it has if you
[50:45] bring it up the wrong way bring up a
[50:47] child in the way it should go and when
[50:49] it's old will not depart from it be
[50:51] brought up right teach your children to
[50:53] do right to be honest to be square and
[50:56] fair even when they're in school
[51:01] teach them
[51:02] train them can you say amen
[51:04] bring them up the way you should do it
[51:06] why because you have a powerful
[51:09] influence on their minds and hearts
[51:11] right now
[51:12] now society is teaching no no no no no
[51:16] we're not allowed as parents
[51:18] to influence them anyway they need to
[51:20] make their own choice
[51:22] at five years old
[51:25] if they decide they're not a boy even
[51:27] though everything says they're a boy
[51:30] they have a choice about what a wicked
[51:32] world
[51:35] i want my kids to just talk to have an
[51:37] open mind i don't want to force this
[51:39] message down their throat
[51:43] you know why you say that you know why
[51:45] you say that
[51:46] because you probably had it forced down
[51:48] your throat
[51:50] or you don't have the value that this
[51:52] message
[51:53] and this truth
[51:55] is not originating in an agenda of a man
[51:58] to bind us up
[52:00] but it is the truth for all generations
[52:03] of how to overcome in this world
[52:06] and somebody taught you
[52:09] that you don't no we don't we don't
[52:11] throw it down their throats we don't
[52:12] force it on them but we teach it
[52:15] because it's god's word we remind them
[52:17] of it
[52:18] we say this is god's word for the hour
[52:21] this has value to it
[52:24] will they make their own choice someday
[52:26] yes they will they have to make their
[52:27] own choice but as long as they're under
[52:29] my influence i'm going to be pointing
[52:30] them to calvary i'm going to be pointing
[52:32] them to the word i'm going to be
[52:34] pointing them to these quotes i'm going
[52:35] to be pointing them this word can you
[52:37] say about because it's not daddy's word
[52:40] it's not brother branham's word it is
[52:42] the word that comes from god
[52:45] they're going to need it someday
[52:46] [Applause]
[52:47] it's influence
[52:49] it's influence
[52:52] isaiah learned some things by watching a
[52:54] friend fall
[52:56] and one of the things he learned is stay
[52:57] in your place because uzziah got lifted
[52:59] up in pride he stepped out of his place
[53:00] tried to be a priest he was a king got
[53:02] lifted over pride he tried to take the
[53:04] office of a priest we know the story and
[53:06] the king got to a place and brother
[53:08] brown says the king got to a place that
[53:09] he thought within himself that he got
[53:11] lifted up pride god in his heart and
[53:13] what that's what happens to us if you
[53:15] pardon this expression that's what
[53:16] happened to our churches throughout the
[53:17] country they're fine people in there
[53:19] some of the best in the world goes to
[53:21] church i think the best in the world
[53:22] goes to church but the thing of it is
[53:24] the organization system gets lifted up
[53:26] that's what happened to the methodists
[53:27] that's what happened to the baptist
[53:28] that's what happened in the nazarene to
[53:30] the pilgrim holiness to the pentecostal
[53:32] lifted up self-will now you can now if
[53:34] you're spiritual you can catch what this
[53:37] this sermon
[53:38] this sermon of influence is not a
[53:40] doctrinal sermon as such but it is
[53:43] speaking the vision of what's happening
[53:45] in the bride right now
[53:47] back then and right now
[53:48] and that is if
[53:50] organizational denominational systems
[53:53] get lifted up
[53:54] in pride the type is uziah
[53:58] getting out of his place and getting
[54:00] lifted up in pride
[54:02] and the people looking to that
[54:06] i'm going to let that denomination
[54:07] interpret the word to me i'm going to
[54:09] let it influence my life i'm all into
[54:11] that domination no isaiah be careful
[54:16] be careful
[54:18] because it's going to fall
[54:24] methodist baptist
[54:26] that's what happened in the nazarene
[54:27] people holiness pentecost lifted up
[54:29] self-willed self-centered pride that you
[54:31] can't
[54:32] tell nothing to
[54:33] god can't find a way to get into their
[54:35] hearts now remember i'm not talking
[54:36] about individually i have a lot of
[54:38] friends and people there that love god
[54:41] and they
[54:42] i always like to call other things
[54:43] because i don't believe in a message
[54:44] private that thinks we're better
[54:46] i have a lot of good
[54:48] solid holiness people and and and
[54:50] friends from the school and all that i'm
[54:52] not talking about those uh people i'm
[54:54] talking about systems
[54:56] that get lifted up in pride
[54:58] that if you're only looking to that
[55:00] system
[55:02] to influence you
[55:05] that's not a good thing and it wasn't a
[55:06] good thing for isaiah you got to get
[55:08] your eyes off of that system and come
[55:10] into the vision for this hour and come
[55:13] into the temple of the lord
[55:16] and see the lord lift it up
[55:20] god can't find a way in there it's
[55:21] incidentally i'm mentioning baptist and
[55:22] methodist and pure holiness and i might
[55:24] as well just say there are facets of
[55:26] denominational spirits that come amongst
[55:28] our own group
[55:31] i like to talk about the positive but we
[55:32] have that how many would agree with it
[55:34] you have that thing coming in that the
[55:36] system of it just kind of becomes
[55:38] something that people are looking
[55:40] how should i explain it they think
[55:41] they're okay because they make all the
[55:43] message camps and they've grown up in
[55:44] the message and they've grown up in this
[55:46] and everything's okay and i'll be all
[55:47] right no you need a personal
[55:49] relationship with jesus christ
[55:56] the tent vision what's the tent vision
[55:58] that vision said he's seen in a vision
[56:01] it was this big auditorium lots of
[56:03] people lots of things going on almost
[56:05] like a camp meeting okay
[56:08] but when the vision changed the tent
[56:09] vision now it didn't stay that way but a
[56:12] lot of people could stay there in the
[56:14] crowd in the camps
[56:17] not against camps but listen something
[56:19] deeper has to happen in every life
[56:22] the vision says so
[56:24] and what happened was is he watched the
[56:26] holy spirit come into a little room over
[56:28] in the corner
[56:29] and people would come out of there and
[56:30] they were lame and they had issues and
[56:32] they would walk through that room and
[56:34] when when that pillar fire went in that
[56:36] room the lord said to the prophet he's
[56:39] he's moving in other words he's the holy
[56:40] spirit's moving he said
[56:42] i will meet you in there
[56:46] now friends that's a simple vision
[56:49] i want to be wherever he's meeting me
[56:52] now out here in the tent meeting without
[56:54] he can bless me
[56:57] he can heal me he can do mighty things
[56:59] you got to remember friends that god can
[57:02] form miracles outside of message ranks
[57:06] that cannot be the full vindication of
[57:09] who we are
[57:12] is the supernatural god to be among us
[57:14] amen is he to show himself in many
[57:17] facets amen if it's not there's a
[57:19] problem
[57:21] but we can't major on a minor
[57:24] and divine healing is a minor not a
[57:26] major
[57:28] it's not the complete vindication that
[57:32] that things are right
[57:33] because they can have that in other
[57:35] circles that they don't even believe the
[57:37] message they have all that god
[57:38] manifested himself that way it has to be
[57:41] something deeper than just a temporary
[57:43] revival and a blessing god can bless me
[57:46] out here but he says i will meet you in
[57:48] there and for me my prayer has been ever
[57:51] since i looked at the last few weeks i
[57:53] said god that little room is for me may
[57:55] i come into that little room for you
[57:57] with you alone and i don't care if
[58:00] everyone leaves everyone leaves my
[58:02] church i want to be in that little room
[58:04] with you
[58:05] how many want your little room this
[58:07] morning you better find that little room
[58:09] with the lord
[58:10] because you won't get in because you've
[58:12] been to all the cats you won't get in
[58:14] because mommy and daddy you won't be cut
[58:16] in because you were raised in the
[58:17] message it again because you have a
[58:18] personal relationship and a connection
[58:21] with him
[58:23] i want to be in that little room i want
[58:25] to go i want to stay in there every day
[58:27] can you say man i will meet you in there
[58:30] i want to be where he's meeting me
[58:34] hallelujah can you say praise the lord
[58:36] it's the tent vision it's going on right
[58:38] now
[58:40] it's not coming someday it's going on
[58:42] right now
[58:43] hallelujah
[58:45] so where am i reading he said that's
[58:46] what happened to that let's move on now
[58:49] it's because they become so known all
[58:51] that nobody can tell anything and by
[58:52] building themselves around reasoning
[58:54] with brethren they build themselves
[58:55] around their creed and when they do they
[58:57] leave god in the back that's what
[58:58] denomination does that's what happens to
[59:00] doctors when they go so self-centered
[59:02] that they don't need any help from god
[59:04] that's when i don't want
[59:06] one fooling with me
[59:08] right yes when you leave god out of
[59:10] anything
[59:11] i want you to leave me out of it too see
[59:13] because you must always remember god
[59:16] first uzziah got lifted up in pride
[59:19] he's going to do his own thing without
[59:20] god
[59:21] next one so many people today you take a
[59:24] family of people that will start going
[59:25] to church
[59:27] and god will heal the little family
[59:30] he will bless them and give them the
[59:32] holy spirit in their life
[59:34] the little children will pray around the
[59:36] table they'll pray before they go to bed
[59:38] mother and father will join hands and
[59:40] pray and as long as they continue in
[59:42] that they'll stay
[59:44] a family
[59:46] but you let them first thing you know
[59:48] they didn't have nothing old junk car
[59:50] maybe riding around here maybe walking
[59:53] and finally they'll get a good car
[59:55] a better home
[59:57] and the first thing you know then they
[59:58] want to get what they the world calls a
[1:00:01] better class to associate with
[1:00:03] they move into a different neighborhood
[1:00:05] and in there they find out they become
[1:00:07] influenced by the wrong influence
[1:00:11] you must always stay
[1:00:13] where
[1:00:14] the kingdom of god is
[1:00:17] and where the glory of god is pouring
[1:00:20] out lord jesus may this be a place
[1:00:24] i i'm i'm the husband i'm the overseer
[1:00:27] of this place you've given us and lord
[1:00:29] jesus i pray that this would always be
[1:00:32] untainted that this is a place your
[1:00:34] people can come and feel and know that
[1:00:37] the glory of the lord is present among
[1:00:39] us
[1:00:40] granite father may we never become
[1:00:43] tainted may we never have an agenda or
[1:00:44] political or anything may we keep it
[1:00:46] clean and wholesome
[1:00:49] so they know
[1:00:51] if they can't find another place in this
[1:00:53] world they can come here and feel the
[1:00:55] glory of god coming down
[1:01:02] stay where you can be fear spiritually
[1:01:04] fed well it's good instruction stay
[1:01:06] where the kingdom of god is
[1:01:08] don't let possessions draw you away from
[1:01:10] it
[1:01:11] an influence i want to be a part of
[1:01:13] certain crowd i want to look like that
[1:01:14] now
[1:01:15] i'm closer to my friends outside of the
[1:01:17] body of christ than i am inside be
[1:01:19] careful of that
[1:01:21] hello
[1:01:23] be careful of that
[1:01:24] you're closer to ones that don't believe
[1:01:26] like you than ones that believe like you
[1:01:28] be careful of that
[1:01:30] i'm allowed to do that well sure you are
[1:01:31] it's a free country
[1:01:34] but your prophet is telling you stay
[1:01:36] where the kingdom of god is
[1:01:38] you say well where is that well pray
[1:01:40] about it it may not be here for you
[1:01:43] it may not be here but one thing for
[1:01:45] sure stay where the kingdom of god is
[1:01:47] stay where the glory of god is pouring
[1:01:48] out stay where you can be
[1:01:50] spiritually fed we encourage our young
[1:01:52] people to go to these camps that are
[1:01:54] that are preaching the word of god can
[1:01:56] you say man and seeing the supernatural
[1:01:58] it's important because they need to know
[1:02:00] that the glory of god is real can you
[1:02:02] say amen they need it's not all the
[1:02:04] facet of god but they need to know god
[1:02:06] is real
[1:02:08] we encourage it stay where you can be
[1:02:10] spiritually fed day and night then the
[1:02:12] first thing you know separations come in
[1:02:13] the home and then worldliness and then
[1:02:16] they get lifted up
[1:02:18] that's what happens
[1:02:23] another lesson is i learned and i'm
[1:02:24] bringing this down in here a second he
[1:02:26] learned usaid that
[1:02:28] he learned from uzziah because when yes
[1:02:31] i was corrected
[1:02:33] he got angry at the correction
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:40] isaiah learned that uzziah somehow lost
[1:02:43] his respect for being corrected
[1:02:47] and you're corrected
[1:02:49] just submit and respect it
[1:02:53] the brother bram comments he says but
[1:02:55] when he use i was corrected he got angry
[1:02:57] about it
[1:02:58] you correct people about something or
[1:03:00] tell them about their wrongdoing they'll
[1:03:02] leave the church
[1:03:06] they won't go to somebody tell women
[1:03:08] that they shouldn't wear short hair well
[1:03:10] i'll just go somewhere
[1:03:11] where they can wear short hair
[1:03:14] yes you can do that
[1:03:16] it's a free country
[1:03:19] you can go do that but be careful you're
[1:03:21] not doing it out of anger
[1:03:23] and rebellion to the word of god
[1:03:26] because you may leave here
[1:03:27] and go right to another place and meet
[1:03:30] up with it again
[1:03:31] because if you're a child of god
[1:03:34] you can run
[1:03:36] but you can't run too far
[1:03:41] you believe that
[1:03:44] you believe he loves you that much
[1:03:47] i tell believers here's the point go
[1:03:48] ahead and run
[1:03:51] but if you're god's you can only run so
[1:03:53] far
[1:03:54] he's gonna find you
[1:03:56] he's gonna find you you're gonna bring
[1:03:57] me that's why some of these people has
[1:03:58] left they're coming back
[1:04:00] i believe a lot of them are coming back
[1:04:03] that's not boasting or being proud i
[1:04:05] just believe if they're a child of god
[1:04:07] they're gonna come back they just got
[1:04:08] hindered they got hurt they got they got
[1:04:10] took on the spirit of rebellion hey
[1:04:12] all of us have done that at some stage
[1:04:14] in our journey can you say amen i
[1:04:15] believe many of them are coming back i
[1:04:17] believe that with all my heart but don't
[1:04:19] get angry when you are corrected i'm
[1:04:20] going to leave the church i'm going to
[1:04:22] leave this place and go somewhere where
[1:04:23] i can wear what i want to wear you can
[1:04:25] do it
[1:04:26] but just check your spirit
[1:04:28] he goes on to say the last quote here
[1:04:31] you see this king
[1:04:33] that he made an example
[1:04:36] before isaiah and isaiah seen that the
[1:04:38] king as soon as the god of his calling
[1:04:40] well god smote him with the upper seed
[1:04:42] then isaiah thought what must i do
[1:04:45] you see
[1:04:47] that's the good thing that comes
[1:04:50] from a friendship failing or someone
[1:04:52] failing you
[1:04:54] as you begin to ask the questions lord
[1:04:57] what must i do
[1:05:00] it individ it individualizes it lord
[1:05:03] what must i do now
[1:05:05] everybody needs to say lord what must
[1:05:07] what must i do because
[1:05:10] you may not have all those people you're
[1:05:12] looking up to
[1:05:13] they might not be around someday
[1:05:15] so you ask the honest question but lord
[1:05:17] now what do i do
[1:05:20] what must i do isaiah uzziah was dead he
[1:05:23] died of the leprosy he had leaned heavy
[1:05:25] on his arm and he thought he was gone
[1:05:28] what would he do life itself was gone
[1:05:30] for for isaiah life itself was gone for
[1:05:33] him nearly so what did the young prophet
[1:05:35] do he made his way down to the temple to
[1:05:39] pray he fell down at the altar and he
[1:05:42] cried out
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:45] sometimes god lets the very props be
[1:05:48] knocked
[1:05:49] out from underneath us
[1:05:52] sometimes he lets sickness strike us
[1:05:56] he lets disappointments
[1:05:59] heartaches strike us
[1:06:02] well that's not god yeah it is
[1:06:05] that's our god notice he lets it god's
[1:06:07] not the author of sickness but he lets
[1:06:09] things because it's supposed to drive us
[1:06:12] to drawing nigh to him
[1:06:15] you're in a wrong friendship and he
[1:06:16] keeps speaking to you and then it falls
[1:06:18] apart and you see it's messed your life
[1:06:20] up he's doing that to make you be driven
[1:06:23] to him can you raise your hand he loves
[1:06:26] you may i may i take my disappointments
[1:06:28] in my loneliness and may i run towards
[1:06:30] the lord may i be like isaiah is that
[1:06:33] where did he go he didn't escape into a
[1:06:35] video game he didn't escape into some
[1:06:37] other thing i don't like oh i've lo now
[1:06:40] i don't have anybody and he gets all
[1:06:41] bitter about it and he's going to be on
[1:06:43] the couch for a month with ice cream
[1:06:48] the bible doesn't say that
[1:06:51] so he went to the temple
[1:06:53] he got on his knees
[1:06:55] he said god what must i do now and that
[1:06:57] was the best place to be in because when
[1:07:00] the world fails me when people fail me
[1:07:03] when friendships fail me he's calling
[1:07:06] you to a friendship with him like you've
[1:07:07] never had before can i get an amen this
[1:07:10] morning
[1:07:11] let me finish the quote he says he says
[1:07:12] he god lets the props being how many
[1:07:15] would raise your hand so other people
[1:07:16] can know how many has had in your life
[1:07:18] the props knocked out from underneath
[1:07:20] you
[1:07:22] and how many know that afterwards you
[1:07:23] know it was god doing it to drive you
[1:07:25] closer to him
[1:07:26] how many has had sickness strike your
[1:07:28] family how many has had disappointments
[1:07:31] in your life raise your hand so
[1:07:32] everybody can see how many have
[1:07:34] heartaches come to your life strike your
[1:07:36] life
[1:07:37] sometimes he does this to get you where
[1:07:39] you'd be influenced by the gospel why
[1:07:41] because you were influenced by other
[1:07:43] things by possessions by other things be
[1:07:46] wise enough to catch it oh my be wise
[1:07:49] enough to catch that this is god
[1:07:50] knocking the props out
[1:07:53] to drive you closer to him and run
[1:07:55] towards the temple and say god i need to
[1:07:57] see you i need to see the vision for
[1:07:59] this hour i've been under the wrong
[1:08:01] influence i want you to influence me
[1:08:03] lord
[1:08:04] i need to see a vision for this hour
[1:08:08] i'm giving you the answer from the word
[1:08:10] of god for our disappointments for our
[1:08:12] depression for our loneliness for all
[1:08:15] the things the devil bogs us down with
[1:08:18] run towards the temple of god and say
[1:08:20] god let me see you i lifted up in my
[1:08:23] life you become my friend you become the
[1:08:26] high one in my life that you be lifted
[1:08:28] up in my life and when i come out of
[1:08:30] this temple i'll go lord you send me
[1:08:32] i'll do i'll be a witness for you but if
[1:08:34] i walk out and i only have two or three
[1:08:36] friendships in life i may not have very
[1:08:38] many but god i am tied to you i can run
[1:08:41] back into your temple i can go in that
[1:08:43] little room at any time
[1:08:45] can you say man i pointed this because
[1:08:47] it was to the left of the tent i'm not
[1:08:49] i'm not saying going to this room here
[1:08:51] you don't want to go in there it's a
[1:08:52] mess back there
[1:08:54] it's uh absolute mess hasn't even been
[1:08:56] carpeted yet although i wouldn't mind
[1:08:58] having it as a prayer room someday but
[1:09:00] listen i'm not talking about this room
[1:09:01] here i'm talking about the little room
[1:09:02] god has given you in this tent vision i
[1:09:06] can escape not into a magazine not into
[1:09:09] a romance novel
[1:09:12] come on now
[1:09:14] i can escape when i'm feeling lonely and
[1:09:16] feeling those thoughts and i'm mentally
[1:09:18] feeling down i've got something else to
[1:09:20] escape into
[1:09:23] something besides social media
[1:09:27] i've got a little room
[1:09:29] he says he'll meet me in there
[1:09:32] he promised to meet us in there
[1:09:34] and they were going in that room and
[1:09:36] coming out the other they went in lame
[1:09:38] and they were coming out healed
[1:09:40] and i believe it's not just physical
[1:09:42] sickness but it's spiritual sickness
[1:09:44] it's spiritual mental illness can you
[1:09:46] say man it's whatever this because that
[1:09:49] tends to vision is for right now and
[1:09:51] we've got more mental illness than we've
[1:09:53] ever had it's not physical healing that
[1:09:55] we only need can you say man it's
[1:09:57] emotional healing it's mental healing
[1:09:59] it's a sound mind can you say man it's
[1:10:01] to be anchored it's a lot of things we
[1:10:03] need but i can tell you this tent vision
[1:10:06] said you go through there and you'll
[1:10:08] come out whole the other side
[1:10:13] it's our promise can you say amen this
[1:10:15] is our promise in the ten vision i'll
[1:10:17] meet you in there
[1:10:19] run to the place that he'll meet you in
[1:10:22] hallelujah and he says sometimes he does
[1:10:24] that to get you where you'll be
[1:10:25] influenced by the gospel be wise enough
[1:10:27] to catch it don't be stupid i didn't
[1:10:30] know the prophet said stupid but don't
[1:10:32] be stupid enough to walk away from it
[1:10:35] don't be stupid enough to walk away from
[1:10:37] it
[1:10:38] uh-huh notice isaiah know that he must
[1:10:40] find something different
[1:10:43] when we're disappointed and when the
[1:10:45] wrong friendships abuse us
[1:10:48] we know we need something different so
[1:10:49] what did he do he went to the temple he
[1:10:52] raised up his hands he cried out to god
[1:10:54] and he fell into a vision
[1:10:57] and as he fell into the vision he saw
[1:11:00] god
[1:11:02] not on the throne down here but lifted
[1:11:04] up way high and lifted up
[1:11:07] i want the same vision
[1:11:11] that sermon and that type of isaiah
[1:11:14] going into the temple is
[1:11:16] this when the prophet preached it
[1:11:18] friends it was an announcement because i
[1:11:20] don't believe there's sermons
[1:11:22] i believe there are announcements for
[1:11:23] the bride
[1:11:24] this is going on right now
[1:11:27] and when denominations fail you and when
[1:11:29] friendships fail you
[1:11:31] and even disappointments within the body
[1:11:33] of christ
[1:11:35] run to the temple
[1:11:39] run to your little room
[1:11:42] run in prayer can you say amen
[1:11:44] and then you come in there it's just you
[1:11:45] and god and
[1:11:47] he's seen a vision i saw the lord
[1:11:50] he was high and lifted up
[1:11:52] so mighty and his train filled the
[1:11:54] entire temple
[1:11:57] and he's seen the angels worshiping holy
[1:11:59] holy holy holy and they don't even know
[1:12:01] what redemption is because they never
[1:12:03] had to be redeemed but there's such a
[1:12:04] reverence for him that they're holy unto
[1:12:07] the lord constantly what would it take
[1:12:08] for us redeemed who've been redeemed by
[1:12:10] the blood to bring a worship in our
[1:12:13] hearts to say holy is the lord holy is
[1:12:15] the lord
[1:12:17] and isaiah was changed by the vision
[1:12:20] this is an announcement for the bride
[1:12:22] that the world will fail you
[1:12:24] denominations will fail you friendships
[1:12:27] will fail you and even get you into
[1:12:28] trouble sometimes
[1:12:31] people will fail all around you but
[1:12:33] what's the answer to all that
[1:12:36] not to turn to your phone
[1:12:41] not to turn to more entertainments
[1:12:44] not to find another friend
[1:12:47] that's questionable that's not the
[1:12:48] answer
[1:12:50] when everything fails
[1:12:52] come into the presence of the lord
[1:12:55] come into the vision for this hour the
[1:12:57] bride's only escape
[1:13:00] from all of this right now is to escape
[1:13:03] into the vision of the lord for right
[1:13:05] now
[1:13:06] where we see him high and lifted up
[1:13:09] it's where he becomes

[1:15:35] god's grace

[1:18:33] amnon
[1:18:35] had a friend
[1:18:37] but that tells the whole story
[1:18:41] it was the wrong one
[1:18:43] and the story would have been different
[1:18:45] if he would have seen this is a bad
[1:18:47] friend he's subtle this is a bad thing
[1:18:49] in my life this is something that's
[1:18:51] wrong and so
[1:18:53] i'll let the lord deal with me in the
[1:18:55] lust and all that but i've got to cut
[1:18:57] this friendship off i've got to cup this
[1:19:00] channel off i've got to stop looking and
[1:19:02] feeding on this thing
[1:19:07] my friend is going to be god my friend
[1:19:09] is going to be the body of christ my
[1:19:10] friends will be formed out of what god
[1:19:13] gives me out of his fountains
[1:19:15] i'll form it and i may only have one i
[1:19:17] don't have a lot of friends
[1:19:20] berry coffee
[1:19:23] and that's questionable sometimes
[1:19:26] friends like that who needs enemies
[1:19:32] no i love him we're different as
[1:19:34] anything but i love him but god gives us
[1:19:37] some in life
[1:19:38] and we appreciate them but if they were
[1:19:41] all taken away may i have the strength
[1:19:43] in me
[1:19:44] that if everyone falls around me
[1:19:47] i have a
[1:19:48] friend that sticks closer
[1:19:51] than a brother
[1:19:54] if my family fails me
[1:19:57] if i don't even have friends amongst my
[1:19:59] own family because a lot of you draw
[1:20:00] comfort from your family everybody
[1:20:02] else's family my family family family
[1:20:04] yes i understand but be prepared
[1:20:08] because they're not always perfect
[1:20:11] oh yes they are no they're not
[1:20:14] your kids will fail you you'll fail your
[1:20:17] kids
[1:20:19] you're going to be at odds with an uncle
[1:20:22] and sometimes they're even in the
[1:20:23] message it's just
[1:20:25] why the devil's working all the time
[1:20:27] you don't think the devil's working
[1:20:28] right now just split the unity in our
[1:20:31] assembly he's always working all the
[1:20:32] time he's always on the job
[1:20:34] you see so don't put your trust
[1:20:37] in friendships of this world don't put
[1:20:39] your full trust in family they can fail
[1:20:42] you but there's one that will never fail
[1:20:45] and that's our god
[1:20:47] amen our god
[1:20:50] is an awesome god
[1:20:52] he reigns
[1:20:54] from heaven above with with
[1:20:58] some power and love
