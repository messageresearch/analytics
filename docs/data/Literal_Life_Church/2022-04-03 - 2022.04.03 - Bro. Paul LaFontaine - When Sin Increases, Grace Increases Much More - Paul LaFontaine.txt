========================================

death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come so that's what's that saying there is that death reigned from adam to moses remember moses is the one that brought the law so death was reigning and it says even over them that had not sinned after the sentiment to adam in other words you didn't do what adam did but you became you took the sin nature because of his fall all of us come under sin all of us are born the wrong way so even though you didn't technically do that all have all become under that that act back in the garden and that fall from god we all come underneath it i want you to notice something here though now but not as the offense so also as the free gift so now he's going to be in talking about grace talk about sin talking about grace but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many so the principle is still true that if one man fell and we receive the blood of all of it and we could be we become sinners and we come under sin it's a trickle-down effect if that principle is true then by one man and his sacrifice at calvary we come under the grace of god can you say amen because you can't apply it to one and not apply it to the other and guess what you didn't deserve what adam did but you don't deserve the grace of god but you get it anyway amen and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift and i'll read this a few minutes from now in the amplified but and and not as a it was by one that sin so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace now you're going to start seeing words in these scriptures about the grace of god abounding abundance of the grace of god and of the gift of righteousness in another place in the scripture uh paul mentions the god who's rich in mercy not just mercy but he has to be rich in mercy for us amen abundance of grace so much more they which receive abundance of grace of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation none of you are are an exception to being born in sin and coming under that sin of adam none of you this morning are an exception to i don't care how good we feel we are we've all come under sin amen therefore as by one offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's disobedient many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover now watch watch the little change here moreover the law entered because the law didn't enter to moses so you got the fall you got man come under sin and then he says moreover the law entered that the offense might abound so after the law came then something happens in other words the sin actually multiplied the guilt and the condemnation why did that multiply after the law because before the law you didn't know you were doing wrong you didn't know you were sinning but now you put the law of god in there now you say now i know what i'm doing wrong and it actually without the grace of god it actually makes us feel more sinful when god points out what we're doing wrong then you really start to feel oh my do i never do i ever need the lord right so it multiplies it abounds when god brings his word the prophet said it this way sin becomes exceedingly sinful in the presence of the lord moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but this is the this is my my service but where sin abounded multiplied grace did much more abound you ought to raise your hand it's a good thing that it works that way there's something greater than our sin there's something that's abounding greater than the heap of sin and that's the grace of god so i want to title this when sin increases grace increases much more father bless your word and bless every heart that's here help us to get in the channel that you've given us lord just a portion just one preacher in the body of christ i can't do it all but i give my gift to you and i pray your minister to these precious souls in jesus name we ask him amen god bless you may be seated now in last sunday in zechariah chapter 4 we read about the headstone which is christ comes in the last days and there was a great great shouting and crying that went forth to identify what that headstone was coming in the last days and you remember that the shouting was crying uh what that was coming to us when christ comes to us in the last days as the headstone then there was we could call it whatever we could call it but in that particular incident in zechariah the cry that went out the shouting went out calling it what it was and they begin to shout grace grace grace though it could be called revelation because headstone rock means a revelation so it's a great revelation coming to us in the end time the greatest revelation of christ has hit us in the last days the this planet earth has never received a greater revelation of jesus christ than in the last days so we could say it's greater revelation coming to us they could shout the power of god has come to us they could shout it's the message of the last days they could call it anything they want but yet they called it they shouted grace it's grace grace and they shouted grace unto it and grace is the unmerited favor of god to save us you didn't deserve it can you say man and with the name and what they shouted you could give many names to what this message is but when it came to us in the last days and by the way it has come the shouting was this is grace it's a message of grace without it we're lost without it we're caught in satan's eaten without it we're caught without it we have no hope for our sons and daughters without it we have no hope of the last days we would caught be caught in sodom and gomorrah but god sends a message of grace to get us out of here hallelujah and so when they they shouted grace grace that sits with another passage that's the same thing coming in revelations five and we have this vision that john has of the last last day's events and that is that they found that someone was supposed to come and take the title book or the title deed back that was lost in adam in the beginning someone was taken back but they couldn't find anybody worthy they couldn't find anybody worthy nobody no man no matter how pious they were no matter how religious no matter if they were a prophet of god when they scanned everyone no man was found worthy or deserving to take the book and give it back to the people and the lamb's book of life they nobody was worthy of it so if that's true then that's the way the prophet said it if nobody comes and takes the book of redemption back then all of creation is lost we're finished can you say man and guess what nobody was worthy there was nobody deserving to come and take this book we were in a state there was nothing that nothing to take the book the climax when in the end time when the climax of sin would come upon all of us and we would be caught in laodicea and caught in satan's eden and the the sin would heap around this whole world to a spot to a place that it's almost unexplainable it's almost unexplainable the sin that is around us and it's in that day if something somebody didn't come and step forth all creation is lost we're doomed i hate to say that and just say it to make it simple without the grace of god in the last days we're all doomed no matter how no matter how good we think of ourselves and you know we always when we when we identify ourselves we always come out smelling like a rose pretty good you see but even in our best state the bible says every man at his absolute best state is still vanity scripture is so honest and so my goodness that sure don't fit in a positive thinking seminar does it or building up your self-esteem the truth is the truth at our best state we can't get ourselves out of the judgments that are coming at our best state we can't work our way back to god he has to come in his grace someone had to come worthy and so in this incident in revelations 5 you can read it jesus referred to the inn and he said he even said in matthew 24 he said except those days in the last days except they be shortened no flesh would be saved in other words accept the grace of god shorten those days and he didn't step in all flesh would be destroyed all fast even christians and all all flesh would be there wouldn't be no flesh saved except those days be shortened and that's the days that you live in if it continues to go like it is unless the grace of god comes in no flesh will ever be saved we're finished we're done can you say amen but the grace of god everything's lost and there it is and the title deed is gonna is is no one can take it nobody's worthy and that's when a lamb steps into john's vision and emerges forth into john's vision oh praise god a lamb steps forth and if you know your bible it was the lamb that god provided when adam and eve fell it was the lamb all the way around can you say man because something had to be in our place that was pure and sinless and the priest would go get that lamb and he would examine it he didn't examine you he examined the lamb and found it flawless it had to be perfect it was the only one worthy and he took that for our sin and he says this is a flawless lamb so now when we have the lamb jesus christ step it into this vision and the vision says he's got that book in his hand why he's the only one worthy to take the book so our lamb steps into the vision and he why because he's worthy and now read your bible i don't have time to go there just like in zechariah 4 the shouts begin the worship begins and it's all about worthiness in other words it said thou art worthy of this lamb somebody was worthy and he stepped forth for me and the shouts begin and the worship begins worthy is the lamb that was slain worthy you know what they're shouting about you should be shouting about this morning if nobody come and take that book nobody worthy we're finished and none of you were worthy no prophets worthy william branham wasn't worthy isaiah wasn't moses wasn't worthy none of them were worthy to take this book only one the lamb jesus christ is the only one worthy and he steps forth because of grace for you and he takes that book [Applause] and so the shout says thou art worthy thou art worthy the shouts begin i in other words are saying i wasn't worthy but grace made me worthy he put me back in favor with god he redeemed us back to god and he's made us kings and priests he's put how do you be a king and priest of royalty he says he puts you back into favor with god he by his grace puts you back in the graces of god hallelujah all right so from the beginning in the fall when it first happens then adam and eve after they sin they recognize they're naked and they have no covering for it and they hide they hide in the bushes and so they're they're hiding and and so they're hiding from god they feel guilt they feel shame because it's not just that they send it's the guilt that goes with it i don't feel worthy to talk to god anymore i don't feel worthy to pray anymore i don't feel worthy to even come i don't have the faith i know i don't have the favor of god anymore so i don't feel worthy to pray so i'm going to go hide and that's what we do we still do it we hide when we do something wrong or when we know that we're in sin we tend to escape into other things kind of relieve our guilt this is a the last 30 years has kind of been this term come out guilt-free guilt-free ice cream guilt-free food guilt-free give me why why do you think all that came out just the last 20 30 years guilt-free because they want to provide something else that supposed to taste like the real thing but you can eat it and not feel the guilt but i don't like it rather wait a few weeks and get the real ice cream can i get a witness brother stephen it's all a really guilt so it's a reflection of man because the natural types of spiritual so that's how we relate so we start hiding because we feel the guilt it's not just that we did wrong but we feel guilt then we got a devil whisperer here you're you're a dirtbag you're finished you're done uh you'll never come into the graces of god again it's just you've got all that that voice is in your head and so now you throw yourself into religion you throw yourself into given to the poor you throw yourself into augments to make yourself look better but listen hey wait a minute wait a minute god has a place for you to come with your guilt god's already dealt with it at calvary he's dealt with your sin can you say man he's paid for your sin he's paid for your guilt and when a person comes truly to the lamb of god and turns their life over completely to him then he washes away all not only the sin but he washes away the guilt of sin that you can walk in the favor of god and know he's forgiven me he's justified me and i can come with boldness before the throne of grace i can approach scott again but they're over there hiding and you know what i love how brother ron spencer says it i always quote him you know like a third of the angels fell with lucifer before the beginning a third of the angels fall and there's not you don't see any action by god a third of the angels were influenced by lucifer to leave him and not worship him or to worship lucifer a third god doesn't do anything but one son adam falls and he rushes down to him right away adam where are you adam adam where are you because he does what we do we hide but you forgot one thing you're a son you're a daughter so just like us it's not running towards the lord megan first may say god i need you i fell in sin we should be doing that but most of the time we do it we escape into our little habits we escape into our thing to relieve our guilt but god doesn't want us to do that we should be running after him but guess what when you don't run after him he runs after you [Music] he comes and finds you it says adam steve mike doug [Applause] i'm looking for you where are you lord we're over here we're over here in the bushes oh my god we're covering ourselves what has happened god says what has happened don't you think he knows what happened but he wants you to confess it his brother diggs said he wants you to say it he wants you to admit it imagine adam's stepping out of and so god's saying i want i want you to come out and then when they come out they stand there they got the fig leaves over them and it's like the lord's saying what is that what are you wearing when we recognize we are naked we feel shame to come into your presence so we're covering ourselves with whatever we could find we're hiding behind it you don't think people are doing this even today you're hiding behind something right you're covering religion is a covering religion means covering so they cover it religion i'm a good person i love god they cover it and they're going to post all this stuff i'm okay i'm okay but you're not okay if you're under the guilt of sin and the guilt of leaving the word of god you're not okay just admit it you're not okay there's only one answer the true blood of jesus christ the bleeding word that comes through the word the blood of jesus christ so they step out said what are those those these are fig leaves that we sewed together we did it and so god just reaches over and grabs a bloody skin of a lamb that had already been taken care of and he takes it just blood just a mess and throws it over to him take those fig leaves off and put these animal skins on so he covers him in the right thing and why is he doing this because he wants some way to fellowship with his children again it won't be the ultimate blood yet but it gives us a place we can start talking again what is it what am i preaching on the grace of god the grace of god so so so he says you know can you imagine adam saying now what's happened god says what happens the woman it's the woman that begotten me she did it i can't believe i can't imagine him saying that in front of god but it's true to human nature as well i was the victim somebody else did me wrong blaming somebody else the woman she beguiled me so then god turns to the woman and the woman says the serpent now when you had oneness before in the marriage oneness says you're one so you're not going to blame one another if one falls the other falls with you because you're one right oneness was completely broken it's all her fault and he separates himself and i says himself i'm okay but it's the woman that you gave me lord wow we we say some really stupid things to god sometimes stupid things to come i wonder if any of you husbands have ever said something similar like that to god okay i'm gonna move on now this is the blame game it says somebody else should i talk about how there's millions of people that have left god because someone else did them wrong in the body of christ somebody else hurt me somebody else did me wrong but that i'll never relieve it's between you and god the guilt of sin it doesn't have to do with anybody else it has to be you and god and so this is how it happened and it's the mercy of god and you go to that here's my point this morning in the worst conditions that's when we need a god rich in mercy paul words it and he says you were dead in trespasses and sin but god who is rich in mercy quickened you you who were dead and trespasses in sin now friends you can't get any worse condition than dead but that's how it's worded when you're in the world without christ you are a dead walking living dead person doesn't the bible said that she liveth and pleasure is dead while she's living you're dead spiritually you're a dead person you can't get worse than a dead person you can't first get worse than dead when a person is dead it's permanent they're dead it's over it's finished except in jesus christ because in three days he rose again only in the kingdom of god is death not permanent can you say amen but in our understanding dead is dead you're dead if you're dead it's finished you can't get any worse than dead and yet in that condition of dead god rich in mercy says i can quicken the dead i can bring them to life so it was god rich in mercy running to adam and eve in the beginning this is what he began doing and it was the grace it was shouting's grace this is grace of god adam and eve should have been shouting grace grace god's grace i didn't deserve this but he's found a place of fellowship for me somehow now speed ahead 6 000 years and we come to the end of revelations 5 that i'm talking about and exactly the same things happened we're in a condition no man was found worthy no man was found deserving and so so after 6 000 years the final days just before judgment strikes the earth how many believe we're just a few days before judgment strikes the earth at those days god is still like in the garden drawing us out of our guilt and out of our hiding you know why i'm preaching it to you every week because i love you and i'm praying every sunday every time you're here i'm here i'll be here but you got to be here and i'm praying every time that you're here if you're hiding under anything or hiding away whatever it is i'm praying god anoint me because it's god inviting you to come out of your hiding come into a life of honesty before the lord don't get behind your fig leaf religion come to the cross come to christ be honest with him god grace trying to draw you out of your the bushes there can you say amen and so now he still wants fellowship this time he has not an animal skin in his hand he stands as a bloody lamb with a book in his hand to call you out of hiding and say look here here's the book it's not closed anymore it's open come here look at this book look in here and see your name in the book of life if i'm in the lamb's book of life then i'm in the lamb i'm part of him and i have the favor of god not because i am who i am i'm the favorite god because i'm in the lamb's book of life is this simple enough for everybody and if i'm in there if i'm in there then he has made me worthy i have favor with the king. now how many knows a girl named esther an unworthy girl esther israeli girl nobody knew and that girl moves from being nothing moving moving up moving up until now she's chosen by the king but even after she was chosen and been the queen for a little while she recognizes she has an enemy against her that's making her feel unworthy to be that queen i'm out to get the jews i'm out to get her she has an enemy and so now esther showing her humanness she says i'm going to go i'm going to pray about this but there's a rule that says nobody is supposed to come before the king uninvited am i and i everybody understands the story so esther so so now she she comes and just gets in the back door of the temple and she sees him on his throne and she's a little bit just a little bit afraid you know i feel like a lot of her being afraid is is not so much sin and guilt but just intimidated by the devil she has an enemy and she's intimidated i there's a rule that says nobody can come and i can't come before him anyway i can't come before him just like and so she had to get a revelation but wait a minute i'm not like everybody else it's real simple friends the devil's telling me all this stuff but i'm not like everybody else i i must not forget i have been chosen by the king and all the unworthiness i feel and all the devil is intimidating me and he's going to kill my people and he finds out i'm a jew he's going to kill me and this is all and there's this intimidator there and she's seen tim that's why she's hesitant a little bit to come before the throne but once she begins to come back into that revelation that says i'm chosen of the king i was chosen above millions all these other people i've been chosen as the queen as the bride of jesus christ i have been chosen and thus if i have been chosen i must have the favor of the king to come before the game it is the throne of grace and so come boldly before the throne of gates it took her a while to fast and pray and come into this revelation to finally say you know what i'm going to go down there i'm going to step into there i know all the rules say that nobody's worthy but yet i'm worthy because he made me worthy somebody shout praise the lord this is a bible study you learned in sunday school but i can tell you it speaks to your life right now can you say amen it speaks to your life no matter how much the devil tells you you're unworthy if you're a son and daughter of god he has made you worthy to come before the throne of grace i've come and prayed sometimes and felt completely unworthy to pray but i have to override what i feel about myself and what the devil's saying because i have a right to the throne of god because of his grace i have a right to pray for my child who's sick i have a right to pray for these needs i have elijah was a man to subject to like passions as they were as we are and yet he prayed and god answered his prayer it wasn't elijah's worthiness was because he was chosen of god and she comes and she says i have a request whatever it is esther whatever it is up to the half of my kingdom you have my favor you don't have to earn it you don't have to go do this you don't have to go do that it's not about that what do you desire and the depths of your heart ask me up to the half of my kingdom i'll give it to you talk about the favor of the king ask that's why jesus was saying ask knock seek he wants you to ask ask esther i was wondering if you could come over for a dinner uh and so she's setting all this up because she's gonna get the the confidence and the boldness to invite her enemy to the same dinner i love it i preached on this before but just in case some of you didn't hear me i love to see this type that she invites her enemy into the presence of the king i don't have to deal with them on my own i would invite him into the presence of the king and he'll deal with it that's why i say you got problems don't stop coming to church the devil's fighting your mind don't stop coming to church get in his presence and it doesn't have to be in church if you invited his president's presence into your home if you invited your presence into your truck yesterday i was fellowship with brother john i said you know what it doesn't have to be in church i've been in my truck my truck traveling and felt the presence of god come into that truck i just weep and cry god i'm glad to be your son i'm glad to be chosen of you i'm coming before you lord my dad used to say the devil he's constantly beating us down my dad used to say he's always telling you you can't be a son you did this and you did you can't he's always badgering me and dead and dad said i just started talking back to him no i am a son of god i am the chosen of god he is talking back and you and then you and then you say well if you're going to keep badgering me let's have a bible study satan i'm going to get my bible out where should we go let's go to genesis first no no no don't go there don't care how about the book of revelations the two books that satan hates the worst because genesis exposes his beginning and revelations shows his destination and he doesn't like it it's the word it's gonna happen it shows it's got his whole biography in between but it's got its beginning it's got his end and so if you start bringing in the scripture and bring the presence of god and turn on some good holy ghost-filled music do you think the devil's gonna stay around and badgered your mind esther learn i'm you know what i'm going to do i'm going to invite this guy to church with me she invites him and shows she's still just a tad intimidated you don't think she's nervous there when haman's sitting right there eating her food there's her beloved king and they're there and it still shows he's been intimidated because she was at okay king says what is it that you want um i was wondering if you could come for dinner tomorrow night yes why didn't she ask then because she's still growing in her confidence i mean this guy is a beast this guy is this guy's rough he's out to kill her he's out to get her and so she's just a young young girl who was unworthy of all this but she has to keep remembering i've been chosen i'm in a position here and my king can take care of this guy invites them the second night they all come over this is good food i'm enjoying this and she gets the confidence and she blurts it out and says this is what's happening this is my enemy the king says who is badgering you who's doing this i want to know and she points over and says this is him right here at dinner right now and she let the king deal with her enemy this is not just a sermon this is an everyday life for you because your battle an enemy that's getting worse and worse and worse and worse to believers who want to serve the lord invite your enemy in the presence of the king and let him deal with them can you say man the only way she could do it is she had the king's favor that's the only reason she was an exception to the rule that nobody can approach god this way nobody's worthy she was an exception to the rule this bride is an exception to the regular rules so when all this happened in revelations 5 there's loud shoutings john got loud that's why i say shouting grace grace shouting thou art worthy our lord you have made us worthy you've made us kings and priests i wasn't worthy but you made me worthy shouting rejoicing it says john he said i was shouting so loud all of heaven all under the earth all in the sea everybody heard me shouting worthy the lamb grace grace because he has made me worthy can you say amen and the prophet said the reason he was shouting so much is because he's seen his name in the book the lamb's book of life if i'm there then i can't continue to say i'm not worthy he has made me worthy amen you're still with me this morning amen so we found out last sunday that in the time we live in just before the destruction or just before the judgments of god it's a wonderful thing to see that just before his judgment strikes god poured out his grace to his people to deliver them from the condition and i tried to articulate the times we live in and trust me i could take another five six hours to talk about what we see every week going on in the news in this world i i don't know how else to say it we're living in the days of noah we're living in the days of sodom and gomorrah but and the conditions are are reaching uh the conditions every week are reaching not even a boiling point they're reaching the point of exploding that's my my feeble way of saying it it's like when god said about when the children of israel were in egypt when the cup of iniquity becomes full then god stepped in his grace so that's another word picture to show us the cup of iniquity is full it reaches a point that something's got to give and sin has heaped so much in our world you may feel comfortable as an american you still have your car you still have your conveniences at home most of you are going to eat a good meal today our brothers and sisters in ukraine it's not so it's a different story and that's the problem sometimes is us spoiled americans don't call out to god like we should we're okay because we have something to fall back on can you say amen but you see we can't live that way because we're in the closing seconds of time and our hope is not in all of our the things that the world's providing for us that's going to be gone someday our only hope is in the lord our hope is in the lord and the escape and the grace that he's provided for us somebody needs to say lord if you've provided grace in the last days i embrace your grace i need your grace i need the message of grace that's what we need to be saying i could spend hours though all the facets of the condition i tried last sunday sodom and gomorrah satan's eden almost daily almost daily laws are being introduced almost on a daily basis i hope you're watching what's going on sodom laws sodom laws that justify sodom and gomorrah laws that are stealing the parents rights they're being passed right now by our own president taking your rights away as a parent to influence your child because they discovered is that we can talk about gays and transgender all we want to and we can try to get losses in so the adults can do that but if we it's kind of like hitler said those that have the minds of the child have the minds of the future he who rules the children rules the future so now they've discovered satan's anointing to discover unless we get into the minds of a three or four or five year old and start influencing them to give them what they want to be and and now we've got to remove parents influence because they might tell their kid that's wrong they might say no god's made you in the image of god you're listening to a wrong spirit and by the way parents you have a right to say that that's what a parent does can you say man that's how he loves the child to point out when they're wrong and you're being influenced by the wrong thing god help us to be parents not afraid to say it in love but to say it it might be the last voice that they hear trying to take our kids trying to influence sodom and gomorrah trying to change laws almost daily i tell you i just i went out i was just looking down the phone and seeing what happened just this week and i said to my son solomon i said solomon i can't believe my granddaughter it was hard on you guys but i can't believe my granddaughter who's here this morning can't believe it she's what is she gonna what kind of world is she gonna grow up in what kind of world is my granddaughter ellie mae gonna have to grow up in every day it's changing what kind of world is jira gonna have to grow up in i say the same thing as the song brother west gyra will provide for our sons and daughters jaiba has provided for our sons and daughters and without it without that grace we have no hope for our sons and daughters except god left the remnant the bible says we would have become as sodom and gomorrah no not my kids they never buy into that they know they're a girl and a boy it's the spirit behind it you don't think lesbianism is creeping into the minds in this message of young girls that feel lonely i didn't expect to say this but i'ma say it satan abuses loneliness that's when spirits come in i haven't had no guy look at me there's no good guys in the message these are all statements i've heard from young girls one girl's out in the world right now i just keep praying god will bring her back but that's the statement she made for me there's no guys looking at me everybody all the other girls get guys i don't get one i'm not talking about anybody here she's she's in the world i love her i love her and i believe she's coming back but she bought into that and it started that loneliness i don't have someone and there's another girl who used to come to church when she was very young in this church she's a lesbian today there's a boy that played the organ he's a homosexual today and all this just it starts somewhere and then if you don't have the holy ghost those spirits attach to their minds all privately and they start to buy into these well maybe i'm not this maybe i'm this it's real it's among us but we have the token amen oh my kids though my kids don't never buy into that my boy's a boy my girl's a girl we'll be fine we'll be fine you're you're living in la la land you're living in la la land this is serious i said to solomon my granddaughter's got to grow up this world this this is and so this but i said to him that here's my other cry even so come quickly lord jesus please that's i believe the bride is just going to be saying lord if it's your grace to rapture do it now lord come now don't let my kids grow up in this if they do he'll give us the grace to do it but i don't want her growing up in this it's time can you say amen it's time that this be finished there's something more important than our jobs and our possessions and our convenient lives and our little escapes and our little tv shows you can have all that as an american provided to you and miss the atonement of the lord jesus christ i said about noah's day that the thoughts of man was evil continually he couldn't think of good thought anymore so our mind time and our thoughts and believers wonder ones sometimes believers because you see that's believers that the devil beats up so much they have the holy ghost they got something within them and their and their minds are being plagued their minds are being brought down i'm being real with you listen listen we're not exempt from his access to try to get in our thoughts sexual lustful thoughts you may not look at anything but the spirits are around i've said before in your mind you may never go to a wrong movie or watch a wrong movie but you have your imagination and satan anoints your imagination you can produce and create your own movies in your mind sit in the theater of your mind and watch the most filthy things created in your own mind why because of the contaminated spirits we live in it's the conditions it's the conditions and so you know i don't like to keep because i can go like i said another six hours conditions and all of you would feel like oh my goodness lord have mercy but i don't end it that way because i have a token i have grace i've got an answer for us this morning if i didn't have it i wouldn't preach because we're finished we're all done no matter how good we've done to the kingdom of god we're all finished but i can preach the grace of god and stop talking about conditions and just conclude by saying when the conditions are at their very worst that's when god becomes rich in mercy and we need him to be rich in mercy we don't jesus need his mercy at this hour we need him rich in mercy i need a lot of grace and anybody who says okay well i'm just going to go live the way i want to because i have the grace of god you don't understand grace because when you understand grace it puts a real soberness in you say god i don't want to step on your grace because the way you want to live is grace becomes disgrace the grace of god is not this christ it's somebody saying i need your grace to survive i need your grace to make it out of this world i need your grace for my children's minds my children's hearts i need jehovah gyra to protect my sons and daughters i need you lord if i ever needed you i need you right now there isn't anything more important than the grace of god in our lives speaking to us hallelujah my daughter have to grow up in this thursday your president our president shame we have to claim him this thursday he says on transgender day of visibility i'm not even putting this up on the board because it's not worth it but i want you to know what our president said thursday and where we're at to everyone celebrating transgender day of visibility this is joe biden your president to everyone celebrating transgender day of visibility i want you to know that your president sees you jill camel a doug our entire administration sees you for who you are made in the image of god this is a catholic that doesn't even match what the catholic doctrine is no catholic he's no christian he he's become a perverted mind how bold should i get see the devil wants to intimidate us to not speak truth and there's less and less churches talking about this because it's not politically correct and the ones who are talking about it are going to be scanned our youtube channel is probably being scanned it might even be scavenging when i'm talking right now we get a little scared about it but but you see somebody's got to say something if i go to jail i go to jail but somebody and if you're listening right now whoever you are god bless you listen if you're listening to whoever you are i'll just let you know that that we believe the bible and we believe what god says the image of god is not what biden says that man male and female created he them in the image of god was male and female and then he separated them and he made them distinct our president does not understand he shouldn't even be using the term of the image of god doesn't have a clue what the image of god is but we believe the bible here and we believe that homosexuality is a is an abomination to god transgender is an abomination to god [Applause] and if you're listening i've got hope for you sitting there listening you could come to petersburg and i'll lead you to an altar of grace that you can be delivered yourself i don't need that to be arrogant but they say they're listening today they say they're scanning so i can shut it all down but let's let them shut it down because there has to be a voice there has to be a voice i don't even want to finish what he said i tell you i'm just i don't even want to hear what the president when he goes this direction i don't have any confidence in them i made some decisions this week i'm not watching another disney movie you do what you want to do i'm not taking my kids and my grandfather i'll never pay another dime to go to disney you say well why read what they said this week just read what they said might get after just let her play in the park here in lamberville it's as exciting as it gets take her to the zoo but you know what she'd be just as happy as the disney world because she's with papa [Applause] please please you know i'm not offending anybody you do what you feel like to do i'm just saying for me personally you know i'm bailing out of stuff because this is this is real i'm going to give money to that he says that the entire administration sees you for you are made in the image of god and deserving of dignity respect and support this administration is standing up for you against all these hateful bills talk about florida and some other bills being introduced to protect the rights of parents and to protect not to bash the gays as such but just to protect the rights that we're losing i'm standing for you against all these hateful bills and we're committed to advancing trans we're committed to advancing transgender equality listen in the classroom we're committed to advancing transgender equality in the classroom that's our schools on the playing field at work in our military in our housing and in our health care systems this is not aoc this our president that's what they're committed to everywhere simply everywhere we're advancing this transgender equality simply everywhere biden claims that america has experienced an epidemic of violence against transgender women of color and girls of color and tells parents that they are that they can protect the safety and health of their children by affirming their child's gender identity and then he says god bless you all be brave and be brave to biden tells transgender americans be brave amen goes on and on after an actor assaults another actor on the stage in front of the world at the academy awards it didn't surprise me after an actor assaults one right in front of everybody the rest of the world at the academy of worlds the motion picker picture company the awards two hours later and this one's this one's funny to me the motion picture industry two hours later issue a statement that says the academy does not condone violence of any form and i'm going do they think i'm an absolute idiot am i stupid no i think they're the stupid ones to issue in a statement that their academy that produces movies of all kinds of violence says we don't condone violence of any kind you liar you've done it for 60 years 70 years and they got this mental block that they can't associate how that act or acts gives themselves permission to act anyway they can't tie it together with how he's acting to the videos he produces and the and what he's acting in even his just violent violent outright violence blood and guts video games blood and guts and they never tied together why is there violence why is there kids acting this way why is your shootings more than ever before this january in new york chicago why is it happening why nobody ever says well if you're blowing up people and there's blood and guts happening and you're saying that doesn't affect you've got a real mental block because what you feed on is what you act out all right you know what i'm going to have to quit here and all this stuff the academy does not condone violence of any form they need to watch their movies extreme conditions call on a god who's rich in mercy can you raise your hand and say we're in extreme conditions can you at the very minimum just just say this is not what it was ten years ago it's changing every day but extreme conditions require a god rich in mercy we need him like we've never needed him before can you say amen are you sure you want to take shots or even give time to people who take shots to condemn the message as being a cult are you sure you want to do that are you sure you wouldn't think it and rethink it that the very thing that is our message of grace and our only hope and people condemn it as being a cult i'm here to tell you it's the grace of god that he would make statements to deliver us from this present generation this message is the last days is more relevant today i'm talking sunday what is this april 3rd this message is more relevant today than it has ever been it's our grace to escape with the token with our families you know in egypt the only homes that were safe is the ones that have the blood on it let's break down for a minute maybe a little bit more than a minute this sin abounded after adam fell because that's where i said we're at i mean sin has abounded six thousand years now we're at the not the boiling point but the blowing up and hold on to that term blowing up because i want to get to that minute it's just going to blow up it's just come to a place it's going to blow because sin is heaped up but it's multiplied it's multiplied so much uh to the end time it just heaps up and it's just it's it's everywhere it's in our atmospheres uh it's in our i can get our thinking it's i think of brother gary in our church and i don't see this to belittle him because i believe brother gary was a man of god who loved this word he never left the word but you know he battled in his mind brother ken and i know know this more than anybody because we dealt with him and brother brandon as well always trying to encourage him he'd sit in services sit in services like this and the devil just plaguing his mind and a lot of it we just didn't understand but we tried to understand but he battled it probably almost to the day he went some preachers would say hey he probably didn't have nothing he shouldn't be living that way or the devil's battle in his mind some people say well he might he didn't have the holy ghost well i was his pastor for probably 25 years i no different right because if he could have left this word he would have left a long time ago he never left christ he never left this word what's the evidence of the holy ghost remember is the reality is that the holy ghost changes your soul but the other two parts of you is not born again your mind your spirit your emotions they're not converted they have to come under the holy ghost can you say amen if the holy ghost is in our flesh then why do we still get sick if the holy ghost is in our minds then we would never have any anxiety never have any fears never had any pressure but the holy ghost is in our soul when he sets up in the control tower now you got something to overcome with that's the way i believe it but until we get out of this and get a new body satan only has two excesses and that's our mind our spirit and so he he's just he's ganging up on it especially believers he's gaining up on your thought life he's trying to be literally he's trying to put you that you cap out of something you can grow a lot more as a christian but he's keeping you here why because he acts access to the spirit your spirit realm and so he's going to badger those things brother gary badger did all those years and you know we tried everything we'd pray with him on and he'd have good times then he'd go other times and i don't even know what it was his past or whatever it is but i would never de-christianize or take away from him what he had because he was faithful to the word of god he cleaned this church every time after service for some 20 years he served the body of christ silently quietly couldn't hardly even talk or fellowship with people couldn't eat with him because he had a problem from his cancer and his throat and all that he had so many so many things and yet i would never de-christianize that man i know he was tied to christ and i know when i step across the river he's one of the first handshakes i want to get my dear brother gary with his new body see we categorize people and we put the things all this stuff you know and i tell you the devil's just heaping up and believers will sit right in services like that have many say they're sitting in church brother paul i feel so guilty because i'm sitting at church and the battle's just the battle's raging because the devil comes to church too he's more faithful than some other people yeah he's he's here and i hate that i want to worship freely i know this is true something's registering myself i want to be free of this and yet you know he's got thoughts of this and thoughts of that and thoughts you know this is a battle it's a battle and with all the conditions i just i don't know how to say it except for that don't allow the devil don't allow the devil to beat you up and take on guilt because of the age that we're living in a lot of things that you're feeling is the age and the atmosphere contaminated around us we're taking ownership of it and just beating ourselves up as christians do you need the holy spirit you know you need it you should be honest i need the holy spirit but if you know god's done something in your life that's real you may be away from it but you need to stand against the enemy and say i won't allow him bring the whole guilt to this that somehow now i'm falling under the judgments of god it's the atmosphere we're feeling you guys are going to be honest with me and say i never think in pure thought i never have a bad thought i never looked the wrong way today are you going to be raise your hands to be honest it's a battle in this hour to keep our eyes on the right thing if we don't be honest then we're preaching perfection in the body perfection by the holy ghost in the body and in the mind some preachers think i'm justifying sin and i'm justifying a bunch of no i'm not justifying anything you need to be honest if you're looking at the wrong thing say god forgive me of that but don't let the devil take it to take away everything god has given you you're here you have what you have i know god dealt with me in my life and i'm here and i'm here to bring him everything i'm here to confess my sins i am i am by the grace of god i want him to change me i want to live deeper than what i'm living here and that's how it is and i got a god here i got a king i have his favor and he's ready to do it and that's the fairfax friends that's it it isn't any more complicated than that don't let him cause you to live in defeat can you say amen in the amplified it says it says so going back to verse 18 and romans 5. if you want to read it along so then as though one trespassed adam's sin there resulted condemnation for all men even so though one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life for all men for just as though one man's disobedience his failure to hear his carelessness the many were made sinners so through the obedience of one man the many will be made righteous and acceptable to god and brought into right standing with him verse 20 but the law came to increase and expand the awareness in the trespass by defining and unmasking sin see when the word comes it unmasks what the sin is it unmask it so it actually becomes how should i say it doesn't become worse but your sin becomes more evident you become really a sinner when the word comes because you didn't know you were a sinner you didn't know what you were doing wrong so that little spot there of the word coming to somebody's life when they're out there in the world they didn't know they were sinner they didn't know it was all fine they were a sinner they had the nature of sin but when they come to the word it's a real tedious thing because god begins to show them why they're wrong what's wrong in the soul then they start he starts to point out through the word and through the message this is this is this is how you should live this is how you say same thing in the law of moses thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery when all that came up okay now i know something's wrong here now i know i'm living in sin he says the law increases and expands now i want to just make a point here the law think deeply now with me the law that was god's grace to the people that's what he called moses law people would say was the law no we're past the law no no it was god's grace to the people moses bringing the word but that expanded the effects of sin actually it made sin the bound it made sin increase why it made them aware of how weak they are without god's grace how many people have said to me that the that the enemy uses the very message to try and condemn them quoting the message and quoting the scripture now do you think god ever intended the message to condemn people to condemn you no how does that work when all of a sudden the word comes it's the grace and now a sudden god's people through the enemy interpreting it using the same message i'm never worthy i'll never measure up i can never do anything using the message to do it talking to a parent yesterday about the kids if kids grow up in an atmosphere they never measure up to daddy and mommy they never can measure up they're never perfect enough that's not good because they'll start perceiving god that way so we have to be balanced as parents that we constantly have to point out what they're doing wrong and don't stop doing it but you have to praise you have to praise when their steps made to something good because they're going to feel like i never there's no sense in trying i won't try anymore i'm not going to try to serve the lord anymore because i couldn't measure up to daddy mommy i can't measure ever measure up to god so i'm quitting there's no sense in trying we must have our truth that we present seasoned with grace has to be seasoned with grace you know another word for a bounded so he's saying that all this abounds and sin abounds and then he turns it over and he says but when what's the last word he says there where sin abounded grace did much more i'm going to try to wrap it up and close here in a minute but you still with me but where sin abounded in other words it just increased and it multiplied and compounded where sin would do that grace did much more compound and increase so another word for abounded of course is compounded everybody anybody ever heard of uh compound compound interest or anybody heard of debt interest or anybody had interest on your debt um so you know when you have these things of interest then it's not just the debt it's not just the bill it's not just what you got but when you have interest charged on a loan especially the days when they have high interest then at the end of it you don't just owe the original debt it abounds it accumulates it gets to be more that's what satan does with your sin it keeps abounding it keeps growing in interest and you know satan has terrible interest rates so you young people if you buy a car you say okay i'm gonna buy a car here okay i'm gonna buy a car for seven thousand dollars okay and i only have three hundred dollars down i made on my babysitting money and i'm going to put 300 down and the bank's gonna give me a loan at 10 they're gonna let me pay for it for 48 months i'm just giving an example here of interest now you buy a car for seven 300 down ten percent uh interest for 48 months which i think is four years you pay a hundred and fourteen dollars a month guess what when it's over you didn't pay seven thousand for the car you will actually pay after it's over with four years you'll pay almost 10 000 for the car because of interest abounding accumulating so your car that you thought you would pay uh 7 000 where you didn't pay that you didn't pay that you paid 9 600 almost 10 000 and then in four years you're going to have repairs let's say it's 2 000 repairs now that cars cost you uh 11 612 the 7 000 car and after four years the thing is falling apart anyway you know the air don't work so you got 260 air two windows down 60 miles an hour the air don't work the headlights are wired on with baling wire there's loud sounds coming out of it there's there's smoke coming out of it and you've paid not double but you've it so it abounds right and so you know and there's a smoke or you know i thought last night i was in detroit in a traffic jam years ago this was i was young and stuck in a traffic jam and somebody's car was smoking just smoke just coming out of the hood just pouring out of it and everybody notices it really but the guy who's in the car it was so funny i don't know why i'm bringing that but it was just so many because i drove up next to him and people are passing him and kind of wanting to point to it and they're all looking at it and he's he's going i remember that distinctly brother steve in my mind that he's just acting like it was almost normal every day to see that come on yeah wish you had a car that had smoke coming out of it you're probably jealous of me sin debt bears interest can you say amen the devil has the worst interest he he the devil's a crook and he makes you a slave the bible says the the the borrower's servant to the lender so his kind of debt and interest makes you a slave for life sometimes because of one sin that you do satan could put compound it in your life and you can't seem to get over it because the devil has got interest on it and it's it's not just you remember what he says he makes you rob the store and then he goes and calls the cops on you that you rob the store and then he badges you you can never be a believer one small little thing sometimes the devil has compound interest on it it makes you never be forgiven of that you can never be free of that that's the way the devil works but if you turned around compound interest compounded interest and you turn this all around and i'm teaching this is a mathematic class for the young people if they catch this my that would be great if you turn the interest the power of the interest around and it's compounded monthly uh on invested money you invest it instead of debt you take close to the same amount of payment you would have paid for that car and you invested in an investment account and you you start at you know some somewhere like uh maybe uh 12 percent or excuse me nine percent you started let's just say it this way if you if you took uh if you put in 170 for starting at 25 years old at nine percent when you're 67 years old you'll have 1 million dollars grown you'll be a millionaire at 67 just by putting in that 170 dollars a month starting at 25 years old you put that in every month you'll be a millionaire if you put in if you put in 500 a month you'll be three million dollars at your retirement that's really powerful compounded interest is actually god's idea it's god's mathematics young people this this is this is powerful naturally but it's more powerful spiritually amen young people i haven't even got into the blessings of tithes and offerings i haven't talked about that yet go over to malachi 3 it says he'll pour out upon you a blessing that you won't be able to contain by you being faithful with your tithes and offerings god's mathematics are better than anything in the world can you say amen you give your light to god you turn your life over to jesus christ and say lord i want to obey you in all things that you do i want to follow you with all my heart all of heaven is backing you up can you say amen that walk towards god is going to be compounded and god's going to bless you abundantly for it can you say amen even about the mathematics albert einstein says that compound interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time he says the greatest mathematic discovery of all time i've got one greater for albert einstein when sin abounds grace abounds way beyond it can you say amen it blows the human mind compound interest can blow your mind but the grace of god can blow your mind because he says where sin would bound and it looks like it's taken it to the deepest place grace abounds that much more blows satan's mind blows the human mind can you say man it's not even fair because you didn't even deserve it you didn't even deserve it and god gave it to you here's some economics of god one can chase a thousand to ten thousand there's some mathematics for you hallelujah last quote and i'm gonna end it here you understand though compound interest in the in the natural debt of sin grows but there's something greater that's the grace of god it's not just you initially get his grace but his grace abounds his mercy becomes rich to you and it needs to be rich in these last days because otherwise we'd be a defeated people i love you today i love everyone that's here everybody listening i love you with all my heart and please don't be offended i love you and i want to tell you the truth god has a plan for your life god has given his grace he's offered his grace to you don't let the devil taint what his grace has been given to you don't let him taint it this last quote is amazing because it says we see that astronomers are predicting some time and i'm closing we see that astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part of the first part of the month beginning in the second or the fifth somewhere along this month the indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces and the american newspapers make fun of it so i looked up this article and it said the beginning january of 62 and so i read the same articles that the prophet's reading here and he said they were predicting that five five stars to line up and it haven't had to happen in a long time uh but their conclusion of is all five of these stars are lining up and their conclusion to is i do not he says that the world is going to blow to pieces the world when these line up the board so there's a great fear there's a great scare this is how the prophet addresses i do not believe the world's going to blow to pieces because of the five stars lining up but i do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that when the five planets mars jupiter venus and so forth comes into their they they've never they've never did it oh they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back there to know it i predict that this has been so now his here's his prediction is what the star is lining up i predict that this is a spiritual application i believe it's coming in the issue of the issue of god i believe it's coming in of the issue of god that the great revelations of the word will be opened during this time that's what he says 62 i predict that these five stars lining up is not what they're saying that it's going to blow to pieces at the end of the world and they're working off of that thing that the mayan calendar said predicted 2012 because that was gonna be another lining up the five stars that would be the end the earth would blow to pieces all that has truth to it but they don't have any revelation to be able to discern when it's going to happen that's right okay but here's the prophet he takes he says yeah there's something this is a sign in the heaven of something he said there's there's there's the great revelations of the world will be open during this time what happened the year after that remember they claim it was three stars that came into their orbits when jesus was born and this is five and five is it's my my sermon to you five is the number of grace it's not the number of judgment so when his word comes and great revelations come in the last days for his people what is it it's grace coming to us it's grace and look what else he says remember they claim those three stars came into their orbits when jesus was born and this is five and five is grace the number of grace there's the third number of perfection three is the number of perfection 5 is the number of grace jesus grace faith all those are five so forth the number of grace god ever sends his power to the church in other words he's saying if god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace it won't be it's powerful if you didn't get anything else get this when he sends this headstone when he sends this revelation when he if he brings this power to his church which how many believe he has it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people somebody said praise god hallelujah that's right somebody shout grace when this comes and it has come it will be grace to the people it won't be dependent on the obedience of the people it's all grace it's all grace it'll be rapturing grace now you know his best i believe in being obedient how many believe in obedience but at the ultimate end rapturing grace is rapturing grace it won't be your obedience to get you in it's gonna be because his grace was extended it won't be the obedience of the people and isaiah said in the 40th chapter cry to jerusalem that her warfare is over listen let me tell you something i wish i could go to that chapter but read this look at this scripture he's referring to tell israel comfort my people comfort them give them comfort don't badger them don't preach judgment to them listen listen we're the bride is not under the judgments of god she's past the judgments of god she's under the grace of the message that's become can you say amen comfort my people and tell them cry to jerusalem that her warfare is over yet she was guilty of adultery but it was god's grace that was sending it god sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our merits when he brings this it won't be the obedience of the people so whatever voice is telling you i won't make it in unless i become more obedient that's not accurate i believe in obedience but ultimately this won't depend on us it depends on our surrender to what he's already provided that scripture in isaiah 40 ends by saying israel i have forgiven you your debt has been paid double now if you had a debt i know i'm supposed to close if you had a debt and you owed say you owed twenty dollars and you did something wrong so you owe twenty dollars and you couldn't pay it someone are you the one that put the reflectors on my lines you're finally confessing to it i have two monument lines in my front driveway and somebody put reflectors on my lines the other day i knew who it was but i was trying to get the family to confess he just come up here you did wrong son you did wrong especially leaving me three days without confessing it but i'm gonna give you grace today it's 20 to fix this right i'm gonna pay it your debt's been paid but you know what 20 bucks i'm gonna double pay it i'm gonna double pay it so that you know it's not just been paid but it's been double paid to give the confidence comfort my people the debt that calvary has been paid it's over how joyful and free should we be when he's double paid our debts forgiven justified let's stand together let's rejoice he has made us worthy can you say amen somebody raise your hand and say grace grace god's grace oh hallelujah blessed be his name this morning i think we ought to clap our hands and say father thank you thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give me that course that sherry was singing cher you want to come and sing a grace marvelous grace marvel less grace i needed grace to pardon and cleanse within all grace [Music] marvelous grace flows from above the infinite love marvelous [Music] [Applause] i need embracement [Music] with [Music] locked [Music] years of frustration as love passed me by until the master heard of my heart for grace marvelous grace i need a grace marvelous grace flows [Music] i was broken inside
