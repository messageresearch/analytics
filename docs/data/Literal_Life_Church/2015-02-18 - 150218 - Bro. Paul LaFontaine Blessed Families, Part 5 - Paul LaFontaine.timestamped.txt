[0:00] welcome movie tonight
[0:02] and uh
[0:08] Sunday service was uh Missing Sunday
[0:10] service was a
[0:13] certainly a regret we're just looking
[0:14] forward to coming there so we just you
[0:17] know 30 days and we'll be over this hump
[0:19] of the winter hopefully and be first day
[0:22] of spring I think 30 days or 29 days
[0:24] away so we're looking forward to that
[0:26] Deuteronomy chapter 6
[0:28] we're going to read one through nine and
[0:31] everybody have it say Amen
[0:33] amen now these are the Commandments the
[0:36] statues and the judgments which the Lord
[0:38] your God commanded to teach you that ye
[0:40] might do them in the land whether you go
[0:42] to possess it that thou mightest fear
[0:44] the lord thy God to keep all of his
[0:46] statues and his Commandments which I
[0:48] command thee thou and thy son and thy
[0:52] son all the days of thy life and that
[0:54] thy days may be prolonged I was thinking
[0:57] that doing the funeral of Mr Ford
[0:59] someone had said he lived until 99
[1:01] somebody said he must have really
[1:02] treated his parents right to live that
[1:04] long for sure knowing that promise
[1:07] here therefore are Israel and observe to
[1:09] do it that it might be well with thee
[1:11] and that ye might increase mightily as
[1:13] the Lord God of thy fathers hath
[1:15] promised thee in the lamb that floweth
[1:17] with milk and honey hear o Israel the
[1:20] Lord our God is one Lord
[1:22] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:24] with all thine heart and with all thy
[1:26] soul and with all thy might and these
[1:29] words which I command thee this day
[1:31] shall be in thine heart and thou shalt
[1:34] teach them diligently unto thy children
[1:36] and shalt talk of them when thou sit us
[1:39] in thine house and when thou walkest by
[1:41] the way and when thou lie us down and
[1:44] when thou riseth up and thou shalt bind
[1:47] them for a sign upon thine hand and they
[1:50] shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
[1:52] and thou shalt write them upon the post
[1:56] of thy house and on thy Gates amen let's
[1:59] pray together Heavenly Father we ask you
[2:02] to come and bless the word tonight as we
[2:04] break bread together and just pray that
[2:06] that portion that you have for us today
[2:08] that we could grow
[2:10] we pray that you just distribute it to
[2:12] us Lord by Revelation Lord we need
[2:14] Revelation more than we ever needed it
[2:16] before and the Revelation only comes
[2:19] directly from you and so Lord I pray
[2:21] that you help us as we get in the word
[2:23] tonight and me being the vessel the one
[2:25] that you've chosen here for tonight to
[2:27] minister to the people I I feel very
[2:30] humbled Lord to be able to do that but
[2:33] Lord help me to get out of the way so
[2:34] that people see Christ and that
[2:36] Revelation would come even through my
[2:38] words Lord and that you could bring it
[2:40] from your throne to their hearts we just
[2:42] thank you for this opportunity to get
[2:43] together once again Lord some of the
[2:45] weather has kept us away from fellowship
[2:47] but we're thankful to be here tonight we
[2:49] pray those that are not able to be in
[2:51] the house of God tonight and she would
[2:53] encourage them and strengthen them Lord
[2:54] and we just Commit This service to you
[2:56] and all that will be said and we thank
[2:58] you for it in Jesus name amen why don't
[3:01] you seek somebody's hand before you take
[3:02] your seat tonight God bless you
[3:05] thank you
[3:09] I'm taking a little study on uh
[3:12] Wednesday nights here on blessed
[3:15] families or families that are blessed
[3:16] and really been enjoying it especially
[3:19] last Wednesday night if you get a chance
[3:21] to listen on YouTube there we had a
[3:22] wonderful time there and uh just taking
[3:25] the places in the scripture that point
[3:27] of a family being blessed and uh the
[3:30] next place uh with an emphasis on the
[3:33] families uh he's here in Deuteronomy
[3:35] chapter six and what makes a family
[3:37] truly blessed and I always want to take
[3:39] this section here I might mention this
[3:41] first though that in the Book of Numbers
[3:44] when there's a lot of numbering going on
[3:46] numbering of the people you'll find a
[3:49] statement over and over again you'll
[3:51] find families there and because when God
[3:53] numbered the people he numbered them
[3:55] according to families he didn't number
[3:57] them according to positions and all
[4:00] these other things and it just it just
[4:02] shows us something in the heart of God
[4:04] that his mind is on families and his
[4:06] heart is on families that's the focus of
[4:09] his church and the focus of what he's
[4:11] trying to so when you look at numbers
[4:12] you find it over and over again hundreds
[4:14] of times that he numbered them according
[4:16] to the families
[4:18] and then of course when we get into the
[4:20] uh as last Wednesday night we're talking
[4:22] about the token we realized that the
[4:23] token was applied applied not to the
[4:25] church but to the whole that's how much
[4:27] important the emphasis was to the home
[4:29] is that the token was actually applied
[4:31] so it's it's families that was prominent
[4:33] in God's mind and then when we get in
[4:36] the Book of Joshua which we should get
[4:37] there tonight hopefully when we talk
[4:39] about the inheritance of the people of
[4:41] God and them coming into their place God
[4:43] began to divide the land up to the
[4:46] tribes but also it broke down to not
[4:49] just tribes but it broke to families as
[4:51] well so you can see the theme throughout
[4:53] the Old Testament and coming into the
[4:55] New Testament even when God begins to
[4:58] set up the new church we're referred to
[5:01] as brothers and sisters
[5:04] can you say Amen well that's family
[5:05] right and and he's our father and we are
[5:08] Sons and Daughters all those terms are
[5:10] what God wanted us to use because it's a
[5:13] family
[5:13] it's the family of God and God as we
[5:16] took this series from the beginning from
[5:18] Genesis is that that marriage and that
[5:20] family and God having children that way
[5:22] and God creating them by a spoken word
[5:24] that's what God had in his mind is a a
[5:26] an image of what displayed his heart and
[5:29] that he could have fellowship and that
[5:31] he could have families and that all
[5:33] climaxes are or comes to its uh final
[5:36] expression in the last days can you say
[5:39] Amen the expression of what a marriage
[5:42] should be and what family should be
[5:43] comes to its full expression at the end
[5:46] time that's why in Ephesians uh when
[5:48] Paul mentions the husband and wife and
[5:50] her being submissive to him and him
[5:52] loving her as Christ did the church then
[5:54] he quickly goes to the bride and being
[5:56] Washed by the Water of the word and he
[5:58] refers to that as being uh the the the
[6:02] what God is doing and the choosing of a
[6:04] bride and so he types that of course and
[6:08] brings it back with the family and with
[6:09] the marriage uh that's on the earth
[6:11] because that all types that that's what
[6:12] God wants to express so when we get to
[6:14] the end if we're coming to the climax of
[6:16] God marrying his bride in this day
[6:18] spiritually then my it should have some
[6:20] influence on the understanding of what
[6:23] family is and what marriage is and I
[6:24] believe we do have an understanding we
[6:26] all don't live it probably like we
[6:27] should but uh at least God's trying to
[6:30] just Shepherd us along in what a true
[6:33] biblical marriage should be can you say
[6:34] amen and so we're just going to keep
[6:36] striving I told her brother today I said
[6:38] sometimes sometimes I'm preaching up
[6:40] here above my head even too but I see it
[6:41] in the word I just keep preaching it
[6:43] because I might not be fully there but I
[6:45] don't want to preach down here I want to
[6:46] preach up here so we have something to
[6:47] reach towards you know so we don't want
[6:50] to leave every service feeling guilty
[6:51] like we can never do it we can't do it
[6:54] except for the blood of Jesus Christ and
[6:55] his grace in our lives but we want to
[6:58] just keep putting that image of what we
[6:59] should be in in front of us you see and
[7:01] that's what preachers do a lot of times
[7:03] is that they're uh I remember even John
[7:05] Wesley you know he preached
[7:07] sanctification preached it and he
[7:08] realized after a while he didn't even
[7:10] have the experience that he was
[7:11] preaching about it wasn't until he come
[7:13] to America I think it was if I got my
[7:15] facts right that he had that real true
[7:17] experience of the holy spirit with him
[7:18] that something really dropped in his
[7:20] heart but he preached it a lot before he
[7:22] actually got it so
[7:23] uh that's what happens sometimes so
[7:25] praise the Lord that he always has us uh
[7:28] he has his image in front of us all the
[7:30] time can you say Amen so when we come
[7:31] into the promise that when they came in
[7:33] they divided according to tribes and
[7:35] then according to families and so we
[7:37] find that theme of families throughout
[7:39] and so uh I don't want to go into course
[7:41] all those things but I think it's
[7:43] something significant to to point out
[7:45] that when he divides things according to
[7:48] families and he keeps mentioning that
[7:50] then that's what God had in his heart
[7:51] how that's how important it was for
[7:53] families now when we come to Deuteronomy
[7:55] chapter six it is such an important uh
[7:58] scripture I don't know how much you've
[8:00] read it or how much you've applied it
[8:01] it's a it's a very important part of
[8:04] showing God's heart as the people now
[8:07] were given the law of Moses and given
[8:09] the things of Moses how important it was
[8:12] not only that that comes in our hearts
[8:14] because remember he said in verse 6 he
[8:15] says those words that I command you he
[8:18] says he says it shall be in thine heart
[8:20] and love the Lord with all thy heart
[8:22] soul mind and strength that's actually
[8:24] expressing what God's ultimate desire
[8:27] would be actually after Calvary and that
[8:29] these things would not just be a
[8:31] religion or something we smear on but he
[8:33] said he really he's already saying I
[8:36] want these things not on the outside I
[8:37] want them in your heart
[8:39] and they couldn't even experience that
[8:41] fully in their soul level until Calvary
[8:43] happened with their serpent nature there
[8:45] was no atonement for the serpent nature
[8:46] that wouldn't happen till Calvary but
[8:48] God's already shown his desires whatever
[8:50] I've given you in my word whatever
[8:52] ordinance whatever commandment it is I
[8:54] want you to live it from the heart
[8:56] and thank thanks be to God for the
[8:58] atonement that causes us to be able to
[9:01] live it from the soul level
[9:02] uh we're we're appreciative of that but
[9:04] this is such an important section as he
[9:06] uh in God's heart for blessing Families
[9:09] how many wants your family to be blessed
[9:12] I want my family to be blessed in
[9:14] spiritual things that we could be a
[9:17] normal healthy family following the Lord
[9:19] and Spirit-filled we're not a perfect
[9:21] family by any means and yours isn't
[9:23] either by the way uh but you know I want
[9:26] my family to be blessed by God that
[9:28] doesn't necessarily mean financially
[9:29] best but I want us to be blessed under
[9:31] God and under his headship so I'm I if
[9:34] nobody's getting anything out of this
[9:35] I'm really enjoying it because I got a
[9:38] family and I want us to be blessed amen
[9:40] I want us to be blessed of God I want
[9:42] his approval on our lives and what we're
[9:44] doing
[9:45] and so when we come to the blessing of
[9:47] families then we this is a bit of a
[9:49] training for parents here as he makes it
[9:53] a priority of teaching our children and
[9:55] that's what I brought it out he makes it
[9:56] a priority of parents of taking these
[9:58] things and beginning to teach them to
[10:01] our children and I want to take it
[10:02] further that not just teach them but
[10:04] actually it's so saturated saturates our
[10:07] life that it becomes the main theme of
[10:08] our life
[10:09] you know Bob said Christ the mystery
[10:11] says Christ is the principle theme of
[10:13] the Bible
[10:14] uh every scripture that we read should
[10:16] Express Christ in some way and so if
[10:18] he's the principal theme of The Bible he
[10:20] says he should be the Principal theme of
[10:22] Our Lives he should be the Principal
[10:24] theme of our homes and that's what
[10:27] really the scripture is saying is that
[10:28] you become so saturated with it and it
[10:30] you put it around them and you put it in
[10:32] front of them and you speak of it when
[10:34] you get up and when you go to bed and I
[10:36] don't see that as being somebody that's
[10:37] just quoting scripture all the time I
[10:39] see it as somebody who is is sharing
[10:42] with his children uh the things that God
[10:44] is showing them in relation to this
[10:47] world and how God thinks about in
[10:48] relation to the battles of this world
[10:50] what you're going through and if if
[10:52] you're sharing that with your kids God
[10:53] show me this and this is what God Said
[10:55] to do about it and you're sharing that
[10:57] that that's really what it's talking
[10:58] about is that the Forefront is that we
[11:01] know we live in this world but what what
[11:02] did God's word say how we must live
[11:05] and I think that's something we should
[11:07] continually put before our kids even if
[11:09] we don't know everything yet which all
[11:11] of us don't we should continually be
[11:13] talking about those things we have to
[11:16] talk about a lot of other things don't
[11:17] we but this scripture is a real uh
[11:20] instruction for parents that we really
[11:23] need to make that a priority and speak
[11:25] of what God is showing us and put that
[11:27] before them all the time and maybe later
[11:30] we'll have time to show the reason why
[11:32] ultimately God knows how we're made as a
[11:36] human being
[11:37] and he knows that we're bent towards
[11:39] idolatry right
[11:41] right and because of that that's why I
[11:44] believe he's warning them as they go
[11:45] into the Promised side he's giving a lot
[11:47] of warnings and they're going to be uh
[11:49] attracted to idols and attracted to
[11:51] other countries and things like that the
[11:53] only way a person could be attracted to
[11:55] all that and let their heart fall to
[11:57] another Idol is they got away from the
[11:59] word
[12:00] right they got too far away from the
[12:02] true thing and so all of a sudden they
[12:04] become vulnerable to become an idolater
[12:06] to serve another God because they got
[12:08] too far away from this one and the way
[12:10] he's showing us to stay close to our God
[12:12] is to stay close to the word amen stay
[12:14] integrated with the word let your lives
[12:16] be integrated with the word you get too
[12:18] far away from it and I'm sure everybody
[12:20] can raise hand and say that as a
[12:22] Christian you've been serving the lord
[12:23] you've already been through that you
[12:25] know what it feels like to get distant
[12:27] from God how many can say I've been
[12:28] there done that got the T-shirt you know
[12:31] I know what that feels like to get too
[12:34] far away from the word as to get to away
[12:37] from too far away from the presence of
[12:39] God and you become all sudden
[12:41] susceptible of things you were
[12:42] susceptible before to see thoughts of
[12:45] Doubt into things and the Fashions of
[12:47] the world and the things that you
[12:48] weren't even thinking about that before
[12:50] now you're thinking about it and it's
[12:51] because you're getting this so now him
[12:53] knowing they're gonna first of all
[12:54] they're built as a human human being to
[12:56] be drawn to Idols their heart is can be
[12:59] wavering that way because that's the way
[13:01] they're made knowing they'll be coming
[13:03] into that his answer was that before you
[13:05] go in listen I want you to saturate your
[13:08] life with the word I want you parents to
[13:11] talk about it all the time talk about it
[13:13] when you get up talk about it when you
[13:14] go to bed and and I want you to put it
[13:17] on the door I want to put it on the
[13:18] outside of the house put it up in
[13:20] sayings and and do everything you can
[13:22] get your children around all the the
[13:24] influences of the word get them to good
[13:26] camps and experience with God and just
[13:29] everything should be everything in life
[13:31] finances and careers and everything is
[13:33] there's a hub and the Hub the main thing
[13:36] is Christ
[13:38] the work can you say amen and everything
[13:40] else revolves around that send that
[13:43] message to your kids and your family
[13:44] will be blessed when they grow up they
[13:46] say our family the whole the main thing
[13:49] was to get around the presence of God to
[13:51] get around where the word is at to learn
[13:53] the word of God let your kids get that
[13:55] image in their in their head can you say
[13:57] man not that it was always always about
[13:59] Vacations or always about this or the
[14:01] money you made or all that but but they
[14:02] could say that we had a lot of good
[14:04] things in life but Mom and Dad was
[14:06] always pointing us to the word
[14:09] praise the Lord
[14:10] so in Deuteronomy 6 here we we have
[14:14] something but before we look at chapter
[14:16] six I think for a foundation I'm just
[14:18] going to step back and hopefully quickly
[14:21] look at the chapter before because we
[14:23] see the chapter before a pattern is
[14:25] established of how God teaches his
[14:28] people we've heard how the children are
[14:30] taught and that's by the parents but
[14:32] here we have before
[14:34] Deuteronomy chapter 5
[14:37] he goes through all the Ten Commandments
[14:39] there ending up about 18 19 verse 20 21
[14:43] uh neither shall thy desire thy
[14:46] neighbor's wife go through all the Ten
[14:48] Commandments and then when we get to
[14:49] verse 22 it says and on chapter 5 in
[14:53] verse 22 follow along with me these
[14:55] words the Lord spake unto all your
[14:57] assembly in the mount out of the midst
[14:59] of the fire of the cloud and of the
[15:01] thick Darkness with a great voice and he
[15:04] added no more and he wrote them in two
[15:06] tables of stone and delivered them unto
[15:07] me so he's given the incident where God
[15:09] brought his word through Moses the
[15:11] prophet and he brought these Ten
[15:13] Commandments and it was in the mount and
[15:16] it was in the midst of fire and it had a
[15:18] cloud so we have we have a fi we have
[15:21] the the pillar of fire we have the cloud
[15:23] we have him in the mount and that's all
[15:26] very significant to the first Exodus
[15:28] it's significant to the second Exodus
[15:31] and it's significant to the Third Exodus
[15:33] all right because if you know your Bible
[15:35] there's three exoduses and and so now
[15:37] those May and those three exoduses are
[15:40] major major uh manifestations of God for
[15:44] God to come down to his people and lead
[15:46] him into that Exodus and so he sent the
[15:49] prophet Moses so you got a pillar fire
[15:51] you got a cloud you got him on the mount
[15:53] you have a thick Darkness with a great
[15:55] voice so now we have a voice and he
[15:57] added no more and he wrote them in two
[15:59] tables of stone verse 23.
[16:01] and it came to pass when ye heard the
[16:04] voice out of the midst of the darkness
[16:05] for the mountain did burn with fire that
[16:08] ye came near unto me even all the heads
[16:10] of your tribes and your elders and you
[16:13] said behold the Lord Our God hath showed
[16:15] us his glory and his greatness and we
[16:17] have heard his voice out of the midst of
[16:19] the fire we have seen this day that God
[16:22] doth talk with man and he liveth that is
[16:25] wonderful
[16:26] we have seen the glory of God come down
[16:29] and uh we've seen his greatness we've
[16:33] seen the voice one place it talks about
[16:35] that they didn't see God but they heard
[16:37] his voice and they said it thundered so
[16:39] not everybody there heard what God was
[16:42] saying Moses heard what God was saying
[16:45] and he said it to the people but yet
[16:47] they knew there was a voice thundering
[16:48] and they said it thundered so that's
[16:50] what was coming from the mountains so so
[16:52] we have now we have another and I can't
[16:55] reference that scripture but it talked
[16:56] about it thundered from the mountain the
[16:58] voice it thundered and so now we have
[17:00] another word that ties to Revelations 10
[17:02] the prophecy of the last day so now the
[17:05] and then we have a voice out of the
[17:06] midst of the fire but this is a great
[17:08] part we have seen this day they said
[17:10] that God they've discovered God does
[17:13] talk with man and he liveth
[17:16] it was such a significant thing that
[17:19] they could conclude praise the Lord God
[17:21] talks with man
[17:23] amen God liveth God's come down and
[17:25] manifested himself
[17:27] God's going to tell us how to live God's
[17:29] going to give us his principles to live
[17:31] by God's talking with man again
[17:34] it's just wonderful now therefore why
[17:37] should we die for this great fire will
[17:39] consume us if we hear the voice of Our
[17:41] Lord Our God anymore then we should die
[17:44] that's how they felt and that's instant
[17:45] that if that if we if we hear this voice
[17:48] we'll in this great fire will consume us
[17:52] as Hebrews 12 says our God is a
[17:54] consuming fire
[17:55] verse 26 for who is there of All Flesh
[17:58] that had heard hath heard the voice of
[17:59] the Living God speak it out of the midst
[18:01] of the fire as we haven't lived
[18:03] go thou near and hear all that the Lord
[18:06] Our God shall say and speak thou unto us
[18:08] all the Lord Our God shall speak unto
[18:10] thee and we will hear it and do it now
[18:12] they're speaking to Moses there
[18:13] You Go Near You Hear What the Lord Has
[18:16] said you speak it to us and we'll do it
[18:18] right
[18:20] they didn't they made a choice there
[18:22] they didn't want to hear in this way
[18:25] with God they said I I don't want to do
[18:28] that right we want you to do it Moses
[18:31] and you come and tell us what he said
[18:33] and then we'll do it
[18:35] and the Lord heard the voice of your
[18:38] words when he spake unto me and the Lord
[18:41] said unto me I have heard the voice of
[18:43] the words of this people which they have
[18:45] spoken unto thee they have well said all
[18:48] that they have spoken all that there
[18:50] were such a heart in them that they
[18:53] would fear me and keep all my
[18:54] Commandments always that it might be
[18:57] well with them and with their children
[18:59] forever there's a blessing to the family
[19:01] right there
[19:02] would it come back to a heart such a
[19:05] heart for for a heart in them that they
[19:07] would fear Him and keep his Commandments
[19:08] go say to them get you in your tents
[19:11] again so he said Moses go tell the
[19:14] people go you go get in your tents again
[19:16] but as for thee Moses stand thou here by
[19:19] me
[19:20] and I will speak unto thee all the
[19:22] Commandments and the statues and the
[19:24] judgments which Thou shalt teach them
[19:26] that they may do them in the land which
[19:28] I give them to possess it you saw
[19:30] observe to do therefore as the Lord your
[19:32] God hath commanded you you shall not
[19:34] turn aside to the right hand or to the
[19:35] left ye shall walk in all the ways which
[19:38] the Lord your God hath commanded you
[19:40] that you may live and that it may be
[19:43] well with you and that you may prolong
[19:45] your days in the land which ye shall
[19:47] possess so God says
[19:49] their request is a good one come here
[19:51] and Stand By Me the people go to their
[19:52] tents you come and stand by me and now
[19:55] I'm going to speak to you and you teach
[19:57] the children of Israel you teach them my
[19:59] statues you teach them my Commandments
[20:01] you teach them my judgments I want you
[20:03] to teach them and I I I that's thought
[20:06] they'd asked for and that's the that's
[20:08] the way it's set up this is the pattern
[20:10] that was established for God to speak to
[20:13] his people
[20:16] this is the biblical pattern for God to
[20:19] teach his people
[20:20] um they did not see God but they heard
[20:22] his voice it said it thundered and they
[20:24] discovered that God talks with man we've
[20:27] already covered that and they preferred
[20:29] Moses to speak they chose that and so
[20:31] this this pattern did this pattern I
[20:35] want to ask a question did this pattern
[20:37] stop after Calvary
[20:40] if it if it did I don't I don't know how
[20:42] it did because the pattern is still
[20:44] there
[20:46] this pattern just didn't stop after the
[20:49] atonement was made after Calvary and
[20:51] after Jesus of Nazareth it clearly did
[20:54] not stop this pattern of God using a
[20:56] prophet to be able to speak then
[20:58] bringing it down taking it teaching it
[21:00] to their children clearly it didn't
[21:02] because Paul was spoken to by Jesus
[21:05] himself in a light
[21:08] who was the light that spoke to Paul
[21:11] Jesus
[21:12] so now after 33 and a half years and
[21:15] after three and a half years Ministry
[21:17] Jesus himself who came there in the in
[21:19] the position in the place to go to
[21:21] Calvary and be our lamb and and and pay
[21:24] the price for our sins
[21:26] still even after that he is appearing to
[21:29] Paul later on can you say amen and he's
[21:32] given Paul he's commission you're going
[21:34] to go to this man and he's going to give
[21:35] you your commission and so it's Jesus
[21:37] himself who speaks to Paul
[21:40] but not in his flesh
[21:42] in a pillar of light in a light
[21:46] am I all biblical so far
[21:49] Jesus sent him to get his commission and
[21:52] then Paul later said and there's a lot
[21:54] of things we can read to Paul now but
[21:55] first Corinthians 14 37 38 said If any
[21:58] man think himself to be a prophet or
[22:01] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[22:04] things that I write unto you are the
[22:06] Commandments of the Lord
[22:08] but if any man be ignorant let him be
[22:10] ignorant so now Moses had Commandments
[22:13] and now you have the same pattern Jesus
[22:16] speaks to Paul and Paul is saying that
[22:18] the things that I run into you and that
[22:19] God has given me to give to you are the
[22:22] Commandments of the Lord now that wasn't
[22:24] the Ten Commandments
[22:27] so what was it
[22:29] Jesus had come and paid for the
[22:30] atonement now he's filling the people
[22:32] with his Spirit the Holy Ghost now their
[22:35] hearts can be changed so that they can
[22:36] live this word from a soul level
[22:38] understand but not without the pattern
[22:42] of God speaking and using a prophet in
[22:45] order that he might set the order and
[22:47] bring the other things that's needed for
[22:49] that age oh Paul did so many things he
[22:51] brought so much especially in the book
[22:53] of Hebrews he's bringing all the types
[22:56] and shadows of all of that in the Old
[22:58] Testament is bringing it forward to the
[22:59] better Covenant and all these other
[23:01] things he was used in so many ways but
[23:03] the pattern of how God speaks bringing
[23:05] the Commandments did not change because
[23:07] that's who that's why he used Paul to do
[23:10] that because that was the pattern so the
[23:13] thing that the thing that uh uh did not
[23:17] change after Calvary is the the only
[23:20] thing that changed was the true
[23:21] atonement we didn't have the blood of
[23:23] bulls and goats anymore
[23:24] we have the true thing that could go to
[23:26] the soul level and kill a serpent nature
[23:28] that we could finally live everybody's
[23:30] still with me I don't want to lose
[23:31] anybody here this this is uh pretty
[23:33] simple things in the scripture
[23:35] we had a true Calvary atonement finally
[23:38] and everything with that atonement Rises
[23:41] to a higher level of Grace
[23:43] right you talk about Grace
[23:46] God's grace is going to come in and kill
[23:48] that serpent nature so you can finally
[23:51] live it from the soul
[23:53] so everything it it doesn't do away with
[23:56] the principles and the thoughts of God
[23:57] what it does is raises it to a higher
[24:00] level that's why Jesus said I come not
[24:02] to destroy the law but I came to fulfill
[24:04] the law I came to give you something
[24:06] that's actually going to live it can you
[24:08] say Amen
[24:10] so now we see that it raises the high it
[24:13] raises the power and the cleansing uh
[24:15] the cleansing of the blood it's not just
[24:17] to be a bloodable goats that just covers
[24:19] sin it's got to actually get away get
[24:21] completely rid of sin that's how
[24:23] powerful it is
[24:25] but the pattern of how God speaks
[24:27] bringing the Commandments does not
[24:29] change
[24:30] another thing I I would say that would
[24:32] be different Hebrews 12 speaks of
[24:34] Paul said we are not at that mount we
[24:37] have not been called to that mount That
[24:39] Shook how many remember that in Hebrews
[24:40] 12. we're not called to that mountain
[24:42] That Shook and if you read that
[24:44] scripture he says but we're called to
[24:46] Mount Zion the city of God the holy
[24:49] company of angels so we're called to a
[24:51] different Mount but yet you'll find in
[24:53] Hebrews 12 you'll still find a voice
[24:56] speaking
[24:57] like Mount Sinai
[25:00] you'll still find a voice shaking
[25:02] everything but he says it won't shake
[25:04] the Earth this time but it'll shake the
[25:06] heavens
[25:07] so it's a greater shaking by The Voice
[25:11] and so you know have a voice you still
[25:13] have a voice he ends the chapter by
[25:16] saying and our God is a consuming fire
[25:18] you still have God as a consuming fire
[25:21] still the same it hasn't changed and you
[25:24] and you still need reverence and godly
[25:26] fear because then he says let us serve
[25:28] god with Godly reverence and fear the
[25:30] same thing that was said through Moses
[25:31] let's serve him with Godly reverence and
[25:33] fear for let's have a fear for this
[25:35] voice let's have a reverence for this
[25:37] voice but it's greater because the
[25:40] result of the blood
[25:41] True Blood the true atonement is a
[25:44] greater effect upon us as we were
[25:45] speaking last Wednesday night about the
[25:47] effects of the blood the path to the
[25:49] blood the light that leads us to the
[25:52] blood
[25:53] praise the Lord so
[25:55] so that being in mind now as we move on
[25:58] to chapter six we see is that as a
[26:00] foundation God spoke through Paul let's
[26:04] just read chapter six and verse one now
[26:06] these are the Commandments the statues
[26:09] and the judgments
[26:11] which the Lord your God commanded did
[26:13] you that's a lot of stuff
[26:15] so God just didn't bring the
[26:17] Commandments through Moses
[26:19] he brought statues
[26:21] am I saying that right statutes
[26:24] not statues statutes okay
[26:28] and uh and he brought judgments so those
[26:31] are all those are all different things
[26:33] right
[26:34] and all of that came through it came
[26:36] through Moses god came down to his
[26:38] people brought all of these Commandments
[26:41] and statutes and judgments through the
[26:44] prophet yeah yeah three different things
[26:47] and so now we have
[26:50] these three things coming Commandments
[26:52] of course is self-explanatory it's a
[26:54] command we think of the Ten Commandments
[26:56] we think of the other Commandments again
[26:57] that's Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou
[26:59] shalt not steal Thou shalt not kill it's
[27:02] a command don't do this
[27:05] but that's not only what God's sin is
[27:07] commands that's right he sent statutes
[27:10] and that means
[27:12] it has the meaning of of limit or
[27:14] boundary
[27:16] so now not only did God send commands
[27:19] God gave boundaries
[27:21] in the Old Testament and a lot of a lot
[27:24] of them were related to the time that
[27:25] they lived in
[27:27] there are some boundaries that they had
[27:29] back there some of them that we wouldn't
[27:32] necessarily emphasize or have today
[27:34] because they were specific to the order
[27:36] of the age under that profit right
[27:39] and so now their boundaries but do we
[27:42] need did we need other did Paul need
[27:44] some other boundaries for the time that
[27:46] he lived in yeah
[27:48] yeah
[27:49] yes he did yeah
[27:51] and because he was under God's Authority
[27:54] and chosen by God God gave him authority
[27:58] to set the order for the age and the
[28:01] boundaries for the age
[28:04] the same as Moses
[28:05] and if you know Paul's writings and you
[28:07] read through that you can see because if
[28:10] if that's not the case friends then Paul
[28:12] is saying a lot of things that Jesus
[28:14] didn't say right that's right in the
[28:16] four gospels didn't say I mean he's set
[28:18] in church order he's telling them how to
[28:20] do the gifts he's telling them all this
[28:22] other stuff by what Authority well he's
[28:23] under the authority of God
[28:25] and so now they're asking about should
[28:27] young people touch one another should
[28:29] they do all this other and so now his
[28:31] words become the word of God for that
[28:33] time especially because he has to set
[28:35] the the boundaries and some some
[28:38] statutes can you say man he's already
[28:40] said that the things I write in here the
[28:42] Commandments of the Lord but that's not
[28:43] all he's writing he's writing something
[28:45] specific to the age
[28:48] and uh
[28:49] so then we have statutes we have
[28:51] commands and I want to get to the third
[28:53] one which is judgments judgments is
[28:55] related to the word of a court the judge
[28:57] decides uh a case or the jury and the
[29:00] judge decide okay so you have many cases
[29:02] come in court so there has to be a
[29:03] judgment made
[29:04] is this person guilty or they are they
[29:07] innocent
[29:07] okay so that's that's judgments he gave
[29:10] back in Moses day those weren't
[29:12] Commandments those were judgments yeah
[29:15] matter of fact uh Moses uh father-in-law
[29:18] came to him one day and said this is too
[29:21] much on you because Moses you know
[29:22] here's two million people and he's
[29:24] dealing with each case it's the trouble
[29:25] of the people and they're coming for
[29:27] they're probably Counseling in that day
[29:29] but they had issues between them and
[29:31] Moses is handling all this and his
[29:33] father-in-law says this is too much on
[29:34] you yeah to judge all these situations
[29:36] that's really what he was doing maybe it
[29:38] wasn't related to The Commandments but
[29:40] he is he's bringing a judgment on
[29:42] something he's Discerning kind of like
[29:43] what Solomon did with the two women that
[29:45] said they had the same baby and so now
[29:47] here Moses is there and he's doing this
[29:49] the father-in-law says listen set up
[29:51] certain heads set up different ones and
[29:53] and distribute this and they'll handle
[29:54] the little matters there were little
[29:56] matters of judgment and we'll just bring
[29:58] the big matters to you
[29:59] and so they instigated that thing and so
[30:02] but those were many of those things
[30:03] would be judgments deciding a case and
[30:06] that word means proper or fitting in
[30:08] other words a proper judgment A fitting
[30:10] judgment a measurable judgment a a
[30:13] balance in judgment
[30:15] listen I'll tell you friends I want
[30:16] God's judgment more than anything else
[30:18] because his will be more balanced
[30:19] a lot of times your judgment is not
[30:21] balanced
[30:22] you must raise your hand and admit it
[30:25] my judgment is not balanced but God's
[30:27] judgment is always a balanced thing
[30:30] it's always balance and so if he's
[30:33] working through the prophet there he's
[30:34] bringing his judgments as well it's
[30:36] going to be a balanced judgment and
[30:37] that's one of the things that Moses
[30:39] brought as well it wasn't just
[30:40] Commandments it wasn't that it was
[30:43] statutes boundaries for things and also
[30:46] judgments for things deciding a case and
[30:49] every case that comes to court every
[30:51] case is different
[30:53] I can only think of today when I was
[30:55] studying this is that the many cases I
[30:56] have to handle in my home every day
[31:00] and I'll tell you friends it gets to be
[31:03] something you really have to pray
[31:04] because daddy is handling sometimes a
[31:07] mom has that when Daddy's Gone mom is
[31:09] handling cases and she's handling a
[31:11] situation between the two siblings and a
[31:14] judgment call has to be made so you hear
[31:17] all the facts you know bring them up to
[31:18] the witness stand set them on the couch
[31:21] okay you've had your time now you come
[31:23] and sit on this Castle let me question
[31:25] you where were you last night when this
[31:28] water got poured over your brother
[31:31] you know you you go through the and you
[31:34] bring in Witnesses you're bringing the
[31:35] other siblings for Witnesses you bring
[31:37] in mom you know and she's about as a
[31:40] witness and you're trying to settle all
[31:42] of this it's like somebody's got to make
[31:43] a judgment on this can't just let things
[31:46] hang and that's what I thought of in
[31:47] this is a judgment call in every case is
[31:49] different and we have to deal with it
[31:51] all the time
[31:53] and I'll tell your friends a man of God
[31:55] is trying to always pray what can you
[31:57] give me in the scripture Lord give me
[31:59] something in the scripture give me
[31:59] something from the Lord that I got that
[32:01] it can help because that's what you want
[32:02] to point to but I will tell you this
[32:04] there are sometimes you make a judgment
[32:05] call and you're just winging it because
[32:07] there may not be black and white
[32:09] scripture for it
[32:10] we're talking bubble gum or something
[32:12] you may not find a scripture for that
[32:15] stuck in hair
[32:19] so
[32:21] that's what judgment means and and
[32:23] that's that's the type of things Moses
[32:25] was dealing with that wasn't the
[32:27] Commandments that was just making a
[32:28] judgment call on something
[32:29] okay and thankfully the people are
[32:32] rejoicing because all those Commandments
[32:34] the statutes its judgments were coming
[32:36] down and working through this for the
[32:37] people to be able to know how to live
[32:40] can you say Amen
[32:44] get a few more of you say Amen
[32:46] all right thank you
[32:48] so all of that was in the message of
[32:51] Moses praise the Lord
[32:52] wasn't just Commandments
[32:54] all of that was in the message of Moses
[32:58] statutes judgments all of it was in
[33:01] there
[33:01] and all in all three exoduses the same
[33:04] pattern we see the same signs in the
[33:07] heaven the same things that we see
[33:08] taking place
[33:10] Moses under God's Authority given
[33:12] authority to make judgment calls for the
[33:14] Times Paul's given the same thing under
[33:16] the authority of God
[33:18] and that's why God's designated
[33:21] Authority is given to a man that's under
[33:23] Authority completely under Authority
[33:25] right Paul when you think of his
[33:26] authority that he was given he couldn't
[33:28] have it until he went on the backside of
[33:30] the desert he had an experience with God
[33:31] but now he went the backside and the way
[33:34] it's described is that he went there to
[33:36] to study and to get all of that earlier
[33:38] training taken out of him just like
[33:41] Moses had to do that he was trained in
[33:43] all of Egypt he was the best man to take
[33:45] the people out of Egypt but God didn't
[33:47] want to use any of that training so God
[33:49] takes another 40 years to knock it all
[33:50] out of him
[33:51] why so he can be under Authority
[33:53] properly so he can judge properly so
[33:56] Paul goes three and a half years or
[33:58] whatever he said it was and so he has to
[33:59] get all that Purge out of him and he
[34:01] said I count it all now as dung all my
[34:03] former learning all my study of the
[34:06] Hebrew scripture everything everything
[34:07] technical he said I count it all as done
[34:11] in order that I might come to Christ he
[34:13] had to be purged of all of it
[34:15] and Smith himself
[34:18] to the word for that day and what God
[34:19] was going to use it for he was a man
[34:21] under Authority and a man of authority
[34:23] God chose him he says now he can be in
[34:25] Authority so much so that he would be
[34:28] the prophet of that age
[34:29] right
[34:31] and because he was under Authority then
[34:33] so let's just type that now with uh
[34:35] let's bring it now to the pastor now
[34:37] let's skip the pastor let's talk about
[34:38] the head of the home
[34:40] never works
[34:42] for a man to exercise Authority who's
[34:44] not under Authority
[34:47] he's not under the authority of the word
[34:48] of God
[34:49] the children are going to notice it
[34:51] eventually
[34:52] they're going to notice it
[34:54] and they won't have the respect level
[34:56] because there's a man maybe even going
[34:58] to church but they can eventually sense
[35:00] he's not under the authority of the word
[35:02] he basically when something's preached
[35:04] he basically goes and does what he wants
[35:06] it's been shown in the word now I don't
[35:08] know about that and so they see enough
[35:09] of that his authority is not going to be
[35:12] established by God for the family to
[35:13] respect him
[35:15] it works the same way as a prophet same
[35:17] way as a pastor it works the same way
[35:18] because that's how God Authority works
[35:20] God's designated Authority God's
[35:22] delegated authority and a man has to be
[35:25] under Authority property for properly
[35:27] for that to be used right for for God I
[35:30] could go into a lot more examples of
[35:31] that as far as expressing how we've seen
[35:34] that through the years the respect level
[35:36] of the children and such has it only
[35:38] comes in a natural Godly way a Godly way
[35:41] if that man is truly shown himself as
[35:44] being under Authority once he steps out
[35:46] of that once he steps out of that place
[35:48] things begin to unravel
[35:51] and I personally believe that a man in
[35:53] this hour needs to be in the under the
[35:54] authority of the word for this age
[35:56] and submit himself to it because we all
[35:59] have our different ideas
[36:00] but I shared with the brothers a few
[36:02] weeks ago that there I would come times
[36:04] early in my experience that when I seen
[36:06] something I was starting to see
[36:07] something in the word or starting to see
[36:08] something I'm going to do things this
[36:09] way and I watch that word or the hour
[36:11] come and correct that or the scriptures
[36:12] come and correct that I said okay my
[36:15] great idea is set aside and I'm going to
[36:19] submit myself to what the authority of
[36:20] the word is amen that's good and I can I
[36:23] I can safely say not proud but God has
[36:26] blessed my life in a lot of ways because
[36:28] through the years I've had to do that as
[36:29] a minister because there's a lot of
[36:31] things that that that come up I remember
[36:34] running things across brother Lonnie
[36:35] when he was brother uh Michael's uh
[36:39] grandfather I'd call him his early
[36:41] Pastor I'd start to see something of the
[36:42] words wow this is looking really good
[36:45] man this is great this is this is
[36:47] something here and sometimes I would
[36:49] call and brother Lana he was he said no
[36:51] that's really interesting I'm going to
[36:52] take a look at that myself that's that's
[36:53] really neat he was he would study it and
[36:55] call me back you know and things like
[36:57] that but sometimes he knew right away
[36:59] he'd give me a few quotes and give me a
[37:01] few things give me a few scriptures and
[37:02] you just blow it out of the water
[37:05] it's like I was way off track
[37:09] and so I appreciated that back then I
[37:12] appreciate him bringing up the word and
[37:14] we have to that's so how do we submit as
[37:17] men we submit to the word of God
[37:20] you know we're not here to to come up
[37:22] and there's one thing about uh
[37:24] uh headship and that is that it's a lot
[37:27] funner to be under headship than to be
[37:30] the head
[37:33] it's a lot easier job
[37:36] brother Chad Lamb had a service on a few
[37:38] a couple years ago on the headship and
[37:42] uh brother Mike gave me a copy of it I'd
[37:43] like to have all the brothers have a
[37:45] copy it was tremendous but he gets in
[37:46] there talking about being the head of
[37:48] his company and all that back then
[37:50] and he's just describing all the
[37:52] pressures that go with being the owner
[37:54] of the company
[37:56] and sometimes employers will get
[37:57] disgruntled and they want to be the
[38:00] owner and they want to do this and they
[38:01] wanted that he said they don't know what
[38:02] they're talking about they don't know
[38:04] what you have to deal with it as the
[38:05] head and if they only knew all that goes
[38:07] with it they find it a much more secure
[38:10] and comfortable place underneath that
[38:13] how many can say that
[38:15] yeah and some of you uh teenage boys you
[38:19] want to be the daddy you're going to be
[38:20] the daddy someday
[38:22] listen being that and a wife a wife if
[38:25] she releases that headship to her
[38:27] husband and lets him she might give her
[38:29] input but input but the but the final
[38:32] decision being up to him man releasing
[38:34] him let it come on his head
[38:38] that that actually should be a release
[38:40] to you sisters and yet we got women in
[38:42] the world fight no no and you're
[38:45] fighting you get something that's go
[38:46] that's you shouldn't feel secure and
[38:48] safe under headship it's a better place
[38:51] to be
[38:53] safer place to be praise the Lord so
[38:57] in saying that Paul had the authority to
[39:00] do that and he talked about the shadows
[39:03] and types of the uh atonement the real
[39:05] atonement coming and a better Covenant
[39:06] all these other things but he also set
[39:09] the church in order for the age
[39:12] if you don't know that you don't know
[39:13] your Bible he set in the church in order
[39:15] for the age for that time and in giving
[39:19] so many things and so many principles
[39:21] back then and and and we we Revere that
[39:25] as the word of God today we look at that
[39:27] as the word of God today we take it even
[39:30] when he used a little slogan there you
[39:32] know where he said this is I's answering
[39:34] the question he said this is I not the
[39:35] Lord even that became the word of God
[39:37] that we hold to
[39:39] right amen so uh in giving those things
[39:43] then Paul one time I was going to give
[39:45] it an example to somebody the other day
[39:46] in Paul one time he he was talking about
[39:50] preachers being paid and what the giving
[39:52] was to preachers and then he reaches
[39:54] back in the Old Testament he says and
[39:55] you don't muzzle off the out the you
[39:57] don't muzzle the ox that Treads out the
[39:59] corn
[40:00] and he pulls something from way back
[40:02] there in the Old Testament and brings it
[40:04] forward to use as an example in this
[40:06] situation
[40:07] now I personally believe
[40:10] I've often looked at I said no why
[40:12] didn't he pull all the things
[40:14] because he's dealing with what he's
[40:16] dealing with in the age and he pulls a
[40:18] principle from there and he brings it
[40:20] forward for the age to use it
[40:22] right
[40:23] because he has the authority to do it
[40:26] and what he left out well we leave out
[40:30] that's what the people under Paul did
[40:31] what it wasn't as significant you don't
[40:33] dump it all out I don't dump any of the
[40:35] Bible Out friends Old Testament or new
[40:37] it's all the word of God
[40:40] but God sends this gift now and he's
[40:42] he's here he is he's bringing something
[40:44] forward that's significant for the day
[40:45] and that we need for the day I want to
[40:46] say our prophet in this hour did the
[40:48] very same thing right right and I would
[40:50] leave it to him to pull something that
[40:52] was needed you know that it wasn't until
[40:54] the 20th century that we started to get
[40:56] into woman wearing pants and wearing
[40:58] something and looking like a man and
[41:00] cutting their hair through the suffrage
[41:02] movement and all these other things we
[41:04] didn't have a lot of issues with that
[41:05] not definitely not as much as Paul had
[41:07] yeah
[41:08] but more would we ever the first of the
[41:10] 20th century and so now all this begins
[41:12] to change and now becomes common for a
[41:14] woman and so now the prophet is used to
[41:16] reach back and all through the 20th
[41:18] century he's blasting out of those
[41:20] things thank God we had a voice saying
[41:21] something because the wave of sin was
[41:23] just coming in and turning things
[41:25] completely crazy yeah
[41:27] yeah and he reaches back there and gets
[41:29] Deuteronomy 22. that says it's an
[41:32] Abomination for a woman to wear that
[41:34] which pertaineth to a man just pertain
[41:36] it to a man
[41:37] in the world there's a lot of other
[41:39] Abominations back there right yeah right
[41:42] go read them
[41:45] I was asked why isn't he bringing them
[41:47] all forward
[41:48] because he's the prophet of the age
[41:51] in the 20th century needed that brought
[41:53] forward and in God's mind this is the
[41:55] way he thinks about it men and women
[41:56] should dress different
[41:58] didn't need that back in
[42:00] back in the tree as much but the 20th
[42:02] century we needed that principle from
[42:05] God
[42:06] yeah everybody understands amen and that
[42:08] helped me to understand then that this
[42:11] pulling from the Old Testament New
[42:12] Testament I left it I left it to the
[42:15] authority of God's chosen man to be able
[42:17] to do that I still check it with the
[42:19] scripture but I'm still released that in
[42:21] the headship that God sent in order for
[42:23] him to be able to decide those things
[42:25] because he's God's man for the hour
[42:27] praise the Lord and I am so thankful for
[42:30] it I started to make a list the other
[42:32] day of how our church War order would be
[42:34] and how our lives would be if we didn't
[42:36] have a word of the prophet in this hour
[42:37] pointing us back to Bible and Bible
[42:39] faith
[42:41] oh I'm telling you friends this service
[42:43] would have been a chaos tonight
[42:45] right
[42:46] the brothers and the brothers would have
[42:48] been hugging other sisters
[42:52] maybe kissing them
[42:54] and I could go on and on and on and on
[43:00] yeah we ought to thank God
[43:02] and rejoice
[43:04] for what he has done and what he is
[43:06] doing can you say Amen
[43:08] so now
[43:10] Deuteronomy two laws you have two laws
[43:12] here because he says first of all uh
[43:14] let's get back to Deuteronomy 6 then
[43:16] okay let's bring it down to our homes
[43:20] good
[43:21] verse 2 the thou mightest fear the lord
[43:23] thy God to keep all his Commandments and
[43:24] his command and his Commandments which I
[43:26] command thee thou and thy son thy son
[43:28] all the days of thy life and that thy
[43:30] days may be prolonged here therefore
[43:32] Israel and observe to do it that it may
[43:34] be well with thee and that ye might
[43:36] increase mightily as the Lord God of thy
[43:38] fathers have promised thee in the land
[43:40] that floweth with milk and honey that's
[43:41] blessing there you're going to be
[43:43] blessed by doing this hear o Israel the
[43:45] Lord our God is one Lord I wonder why I
[43:48] put that in there
[43:49] once again because of our hearts and the
[43:52] way they can lean to serve other gods
[43:54] you know he simplified it for us
[43:57] he simplified any confusion you only
[44:00] need to serve one Lord there's only one
[44:02] God
[44:04] always remember when you go and start to
[44:06] be start to be influenced by other gods
[44:09] or other Persuasions or other things
[44:12] don't forget hero Israel the Lord of God
[44:15] is one Lord and one God and thou shall
[44:17] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[44:19] all thy Soul all they might and these
[44:21] words which I command thee that they
[44:22] shall be in thine heart so the first
[44:26] thing is that it's not an outside God
[44:31] had in his mind a change of heart
[44:34] that would be lived from the heart not
[44:36] just a commandment
[44:38] that was what his desire was
[44:41] so that's the first thing he wanted to
[44:43] be from the heart but the second thing
[44:45] the second thing he says what do I do
[44:47] with these Commandments and statues and
[44:49] judgments from the prophet what do I do
[44:52] with these things that God has
[44:53] distributed to us how to live in this
[44:54] hour what do I do with him well pray and
[44:57] live them from your heart but the second
[44:59] thing he said to do is I want you to
[45:01] teach them to your children
[45:04] brothers and sisters have children
[45:06] uh he says I want you to take those
[45:09] things and teach them to your children
[45:13] diligently I didn't have a chance to
[45:15] look that up but we know what diligently
[45:17] means
[45:18] it doesn't mean just a haphazard thing
[45:20] Lord help us I feel corrected tonight
[45:22] yeah
[45:24] this thing this should be a priority and
[45:26] this should be diligently done
[45:29] teach the
[45:30] your children
[45:32] pass them on to your children
[45:34] diligently
[45:36] and as I said last week it was applied
[45:39] to the home in other words
[45:40] I don't think this is saying we'll bring
[45:42] it to the homes now I don't think this
[45:44] is saying that the teaching they get at
[45:46] Sunday school every Sunday morning
[45:48] um Joshua fit in the Battle of Jericho
[45:50] that teaching is not enough
[45:54] to say oh they'll get taught at church
[45:56] and I'll bring them you know every year
[45:57] at Christmas or I'll bring it here if I
[45:59] can just get them there that's enough
[46:00] influence that's not what the Bible is
[46:02] saying it's saying you're supposed to
[46:04] teach it to him at home
[46:06] and saturate their lives with the word
[46:08] of God Amen God gives the priority of
[46:11] blessed families and that's when parents
[46:13] saturate their home with his
[46:15] Commandments his statutes his judgments
[46:18] that came from the prophets why in the
[46:20] home
[46:21] why in the home well why do we do it in
[46:24] the home because first of all we're not
[46:26] allowed to do it too many other places
[46:30] we're not allowed we're not allowed to
[46:32] teach this other places okay and so the
[46:35] home is one place in this world that we
[46:38] can have full uh control can you say man
[46:42] we can teach what we want in our homes
[46:44] at least still to this day also I can
[46:46] still teach what I want here in the
[46:48] church appraisal or may change someday
[46:50] but praise the Lord I can preach the
[46:51] dictates of my heart what God gives me a
[46:53] revelation thankfully I've got some
[46:55] people here to come and listen to me but
[46:56] listen you know that's it someday this
[46:58] may go away and there'll be fewer places
[47:01] but we know for the home it's a place we
[47:03] can teach the children
[47:05] and so seize that opportunity because
[47:07] there's when they get out in the world
[47:09] when they get out places they're not
[47:11] going to hear the word as much they're
[47:13] going to hear a lot of different
[47:14] theories a lot of different ideas
[47:15] they're going to have attacks against
[47:17] the word of God they're going to be
[47:19] persecuted they're going to be put down
[47:21] you know I my heart goes out to some of
[47:23] these young girls they get asked
[47:24] questions all the time why in the world
[47:26] do you wear these dresses all the time
[47:28] uh Hannah was telling me the other day
[47:30] just constantly bombarded and it can be
[47:32] a good thing because it kind of probes
[47:33] you to kind of figure out what you what
[47:35] you believe
[47:36] that is a good thing but I pray for them
[47:38] because that's a pressure
[47:40] and it's a lot of times it's not just
[47:41] someone asking a sincere question it's
[47:43] it's a persecution it's a spirit behind
[47:46] it
[47:47] it's not a sincere question someone you
[47:48] want to learn it's a it's a it's got
[47:51] something pushing with it that tries to
[47:53] make you feel like an idiot
[47:55] tries to make you look like an oddball
[47:57] we know we'll be oddballs but people
[47:59] make it worse
[48:00] and and so a lot of you adults who've
[48:03] experienced that all your life but as
[48:04] the children come into it and teenagers
[48:06] it's a rough thing I pray for you may
[48:08] God give you Grace
[48:10] because we're not called to blend in
[48:12] with the world we're not called We're
[48:13] called to follow God's precepts kind of
[48:15] follow his word and that becomes a
[48:17] difficult thing when you get out there
[48:18] it's not welcome in this world you've
[48:21] got a lot of influences a lot of
[48:22] different things we got scoffers in the
[48:24] last days that say where's the promise
[48:25] of his coming we got scoffers towards
[48:27] the message of the hour we got scoffers
[48:30] to the the second coming and how he will
[48:32] come uh we got all kinds of persecution
[48:35] that we're going to face out there thank
[48:38] the Lord when we come in our homes
[48:39] hopefully you're ordering your home that
[48:42] it's not just like the world
[48:47] they ought to be able to come to a place
[48:48] that they know the emphasis is going to
[48:50] be not all entertainment
[48:53] couch potato and and potatoes you know
[48:57] and potato chips and food no there's
[49:02] going to be some emphasis on the word of
[49:04] God because it's the only place we have
[49:06] left one of the only places we have left
[49:10] so seize the opportunity
[49:14] the face of that child as soon as
[49:15] they're old enough and read them the
[49:17] word of God mothers especially to have
[49:20] most time with them teach them the Fifth
[49:22] Gospel teach them the things of God
[49:24] teach them what you know you don't have
[49:26] to be a scholar a theologian but just
[49:28] teach them what you know can you say
[49:29] Amen
[49:30] integrated into your home the the word
[49:34] is something that is not good enough
[49:35] just to learn in Sunday school or in the
[49:38] Sunday services or Wednesday Services
[49:39] can you say man
[49:41] he's saying to them teach it to your
[49:43] child diligently children and thou shalt
[49:46] talk of them when thou sit us in thy
[49:48] house and when thou walkest by the way
[49:49] and when the Elias down and when the
[49:51] Rises up and thou shalt bind them look
[49:54] at look at look how saturated that is
[49:56] when you get up when you uh sit down
[49:59] when you go to bed
[50:01] thou and thou shalt bind them for a
[50:03] sight upon thy hand they shall be as
[50:05] frontless between thine eyes and thou
[50:07] shall write them upon the post of thy
[50:09] house and on thy Gates praise the Lord
[50:13] and you stay there a while you just
[50:15] start to get in the presence of God
[50:18] feel him one of my children uh kind of
[50:22] woke me up late the other night because
[50:25] God had showed them something in the
[50:27] word they were sitting there reading
[50:29] and something opened up to them and they
[50:31] they said I know God has spoken to me
[50:34] through the scripture
[50:35] and I said I said that's what it's all
[50:38] about
[50:39] connecting with God and that is known
[50:43] it's no longer about parents or church
[50:44] and all that it's that God has spoken to
[50:47] me through the word of God Amen he's
[50:50] become real to me he's become personal
[50:52] to me I think we need more experiences
[50:54] of that in our children in our lives and
[50:57] our kids we need to encourage that
[50:59] because that's what's going to get them
[51:00] through this age
[51:02] that's what's going to give them
[51:03] overcoming power
[51:04] Maya's word I overcome praise the Lord
[51:06] and so I was just so rejoicing in that
[51:09] and and that doesn't happen too often
[51:11] but it should be happening more often
[51:13] often amen so the word is not something
[51:16] we just get the word is he's teaching us
[51:19] you know put it upon write it upon the
[51:21] posts of thy house and on my Gates he's
[51:24] teaching us that the word is uh it's
[51:27] it's not just an hour schedule in your
[51:29] busy life
[51:31] it is life
[51:33] the word is life
[51:35] that's what should be to us the word
[51:37] should be life to us it is our life we
[51:39] have the rest is just a sideshow this is
[51:43] our life the word of God
[51:45] amen and the word it should be our life
[51:47] Christ must be the sinner not a religion
[51:50] not a thing to run through when you're
[51:52] in run to when you're in trouble
[51:54] a lot of people are like that all of a
[51:55] sudden now when they run into trouble
[51:57] then they become a prayer Warrior then
[51:59] they run to things then they say I need
[52:01] the answers in the word and they crack
[52:03] their Bible open because they run into
[52:04] trouble in life I need an answer or I
[52:06] gotta make a choice on a job and so they
[52:08] haven't cracked their Bible got into the
[52:10] word hardly at all but now when there's
[52:11] an emergency then they go do it no it's
[52:14] supposed to be all the time integrated
[52:15] with the word
[52:17] the word is integrated into every part
[52:19] of our lives that's God's thought on it
[52:22] that's what he's trying to say here in
[52:24] Deuteronomy
[52:25] the word integrated into our lives
[52:28] can you say Amen
[52:30] praise the Lord so uh and as I was
[52:33] getting to you I had a few notes here to
[52:35] get to why God wanted it so integrated
[52:38] with him and I mentioned to you
[52:40] take these precepts take these things
[52:42] integrate them into our daily lives that
[52:45] we could never forget them now that's
[52:47] another reason God wanted them to do
[52:49] that because he knows how forgetful we
[52:51] are first of all we're influenced by
[52:53] idols and if we get away from the word
[52:56] too much we become more susceptible to
[52:58] Idols that's why I said it the second
[53:00] thing is that we forget
[53:03] so staying close to the word of God
[53:04] helps you not to forget the word as much
[53:08] Paul said I I bring these things into
[53:10] remembrance
[53:11] I stir up your pure Minds by way of
[53:15] remembrance
[53:17] and so if we get away from something
[53:19] then we forget things but if we're
[53:21] staying close to it then we realize that
[53:23] we can remember a little bit better
[53:25] we're staying close to the word and so
[53:28] now
[53:29] take these precepts and bring it into
[53:31] your daily life so you don't forget
[53:33] and God says plaster it everywhere
[53:36] plaster it everywhere put it everywhere
[53:39] he's concerned that you would forget so
[53:41] he says put it on your house put it up
[53:43] above things talk about it when you get
[53:46] up talk about it when you go to sleep
[53:49] and so now I would say this for them it
[53:51] was not good enough just to talk about
[53:53] the event at Mount Sinai or the prophet
[53:56] at Mount Sinai now he's saying whatever
[53:58] came from Mount Sinai I want you to talk
[54:01] about it at home
[54:04] again it's not good enough just to
[54:05] believe Moses is a prophet it's not good
[54:08] enough just to believe that God spoke to
[54:09] us through a prophet that is not good
[54:11] enough
[54:13] what we have to look at is what he's
[54:14] saying here is that take what has come
[54:16] to us and let it be integrated into your
[54:19] life and it'll take you into your
[54:20] inheritance
[54:22] amen because the final voice to the
[54:25] final age the final voice is not the
[54:27] seventh angel the final voice is not uh
[54:29] the prophet William Branham the final
[54:31] voices the bride
[54:34] it says it in Revelations 21 can you say
[54:36] amen he says the spirit and the bride
[54:38] say come there's nothing there about
[54:41] brother Branham it's about the spirit of
[54:43] the Bride saying come if you're thirsty
[54:45] come
[54:46] we know that if the bride coming into
[54:48] her inheritance that's the purpose of
[54:50] the message coming
[54:52] praise the Lord
[54:54] hallelujah oh may I come into my
[54:56] inheritance may you come into your
[54:57] inheritance that's why he sent the word
[54:59] of God for this hour so the people could
[55:01] come into this these these blessings
[55:03] praise the Lord and what it is that's
[55:05] truly theirs so one of the reasons that
[55:08] we come into the blessings if we don't
[55:09] come to Blessings is if we forget so
[55:11] stay close to the word
[55:13] God knows how we're built as an
[55:15] individual and we are built in a way
[55:17] that has a diversified heart
[55:19] the human being with all his emotions
[55:21] can be idolatrous and distracted to
[55:24] other gods than the true God
[55:26] knows that and the only way to keep that
[55:29] from happening is be consumed with God
[55:33] consume with his word and Christ is
[55:35] revealing the word
[55:37] can you say Amen
[55:39] so
[55:44] he says then also when you love me love
[55:46] me with all your heart
[55:49] God says I don't want lip service
[55:52] yeah right okay I don't want you to make
[55:54] this a religion I don't want you to make
[55:56] the message of religion
[55:59] right somebody said the other day people
[56:00] have done it that's right I agree
[56:02] people have made it a code people have
[56:04] made it a religion
[56:06] it's true it's from God I believe
[56:08] there's it's I believe with all my heart
[56:10] but people can do that God doesn't want
[56:13] lip service
[56:14] God doesn't like he says I want this
[56:16] thing to be in your heart and to love me
[56:18] with all that you got this isn't some
[56:21] mechanical intellectual dry-eyed deal
[56:25] this is something with passion of the
[56:26] Holy Ghost can you say Amen this is not
[56:28] a ritual of burning a candle this is not
[56:30] a theology this is directing who we are
[56:33] as a person
[56:34] toward God all the time
[56:36] to be to direct how many knows you can
[56:39] direct your heart you can lean your
[56:40] heart
[56:41] we talked about it in a couple's meeting
[56:42] insteading to let the heart go anywhere
[56:44] we direct the heart and we direct it by
[56:46] the word of God and it's always directed
[56:49] towards God when we stand the word
[56:52] and so he knows what's in our heart and
[56:55] so this is a person directing their
[56:58] person towards God all the time he knows
[57:00] when it's from the heart just like a
[57:02] wife knows when a husband says something
[57:03] from his heart
[57:05] you can see it in his eyes you can feel
[57:07] it in his touch you can hear it in his
[57:10] voice and it's the same with God With Us
[57:12] he can tell whether it's passionate or
[57:15] not or whether it's lip service
[57:18] same thing he said to the laosians I'd
[57:19] rather have you cold than have you
[57:21] lukewarm
[57:22] amen so it's God sharing his heart with
[57:26] us it would no longer be good enough
[57:28] just to believe and acknowledge that his
[57:31] presence came and he gave his word
[57:33] through a prophet that would no longer
[57:34] be good enough at this point
[57:37] well I I remember science I want to tell
[57:39] my kids about cyanide I want to tell
[57:40] them about the the cloud and I want to
[57:42] tell them about the the fire that was
[57:44] there and I want to tell them about the
[57:45] voice and it thundered and all that it
[57:47] didn't say to do that no
[57:49] no that's not good enough
[57:51] to talk about that stuff to your
[57:52] children take what God gave us and teach
[57:55] it to your children
[57:57] you understand
[57:58] and probably a lot of people won't do
[58:01] that but when they read Moses saying
[58:03] this stuff is that oh my this is getting
[58:05] to be quite a responsibility here that
[58:07] it's not good enough just to talk about
[58:08] what happened on the mount with the
[58:10] prophet right
[58:12] but take what was brought and teach it
[58:14] integrate it into your life keep it as
[58:17] the Forefront of your life
[58:18] praise the Lord let these fires consume
[58:22] you daily can you say Amen
[58:24] and so it's not good enough just to
[58:26] acknowledge his presence and that a word
[58:28] Prophet came but under the pressures
[58:30] coming in this hour
[58:32] under the pressure we're under I believe
[58:35] that we must keep the word always before
[58:37] us
[58:40] talk about it I'd say under these modern
[58:43] times we live on saints of God
[58:46] the only way to live Victorious and
[58:48] laodicea
[58:49] is to let the fire
[58:51] of God just consume you daily
[58:55] fires of God not weekly
[58:59] stay staying in that channel under the
[59:01] spot where the glory comes out can you
[59:03] say Amen
[59:04] praise the Lord You Have To Change and
[59:07] cut out some things sometimes in your
[59:09] life to spend more time in your work in
[59:11] the word but I'll tell you you never
[59:12] regret it you'll never regret it young
[59:16] people you'll never regret if you cut
[59:18] out certain things and you've got a lot
[59:19] of time right now I love it when young
[59:21] people say I don't have any time
[59:25] you got a lot of time right now
[59:27] yeah amen but in our busy schedules
[59:30] trust me if you cut some things out and
[59:33] begin to spend some more time in the
[59:34] word
[59:35] the glory is going to come out glory is
[59:37] going to affect you the glory of the
[59:39] word all of the glory of the God all the
[59:41] presence all all that God is comes
[59:45] through that channel of the word of God
[59:48] amen
[59:50] so it's the age it's the time that we
[59:52] live in
[59:54] and I wanted you to notice that this
[59:58] Sinai pops up in Malachi 4.
[1:00:01] and it's strange that it does
[1:00:05] but it
[1:00:07] he refers to this here
[1:00:10] remember I said the three exoduses
[1:00:13] and Elijah comes before the Third Exodus
[1:00:15] in the third axis as well and the
[1:00:17] Malachi 4 and verse 4 and verse 3 says
[1:00:20] and uh I was talking about the day of
[1:00:22] judgment talking about the day cometh
[1:00:24] verse
[1:00:25] 1 chapter 4 the day cometh that shall
[1:00:28] burn as an oven and all that proud all
[1:00:30] that all the proud yea and all that do
[1:00:32] wicked leaves shall be stubble
[1:00:34] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:00:37] saith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[1:00:38] leave them neither root nor Branch but
[1:00:40] unto you that fear my name so the son of
[1:00:42] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:00:43] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[1:00:45] as calves of the stall and ye shall
[1:00:47] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[1:00:48] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[1:00:49] the day that I shall do this say the
[1:00:51] Lord of hosts and about the day of
[1:00:52] judgment
[1:00:54] verse 4 remember ye the law of Moses my
[1:00:56] servant which I commanded unto him in
[1:00:57] Horeb for all Israel with the statutes
[1:01:01] and judgments next verse behold I will
[1:01:05] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:01:07] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[1:01:09] the Lord
[1:01:10] look how that's in there
[1:01:13] yeah I I'll let the Lord just reveal
[1:01:15] that to you
[1:01:17] he has to reveal that to you
[1:01:19] and that God is going to send God sends
[1:01:23] someone before the great and Dreadful
[1:01:25] day the Lord to turn our hearts of the
[1:01:26] father to the children are the children
[1:01:28] of the fathers last I come and smite the
[1:01:30] Earth with a curse and right in between
[1:01:31] that as he's speaking about the day of
[1:01:33] judgment and the ministry that comes of
[1:01:35] the restoration
[1:01:37] remember the law of Moses and the
[1:01:39] statues and the judgments
[1:01:43] amen God is going to
[1:01:46] in this day does the same thing and so
[1:01:49] the statutes the judgments the
[1:01:51] Commandments they become pretty
[1:01:53] important and God wants us to integrate
[1:01:54] them completely in our lives can you say
[1:01:56] Amen
[1:01:57] so it's a parallel Moses day in our day
[1:02:00] it's it's bringing the same thing God
[1:02:02] dispensing and revealing the seals to us
[1:02:04] one of the greatest events
[1:02:06] if not the greatest event
[1:02:08] to come in the last days that God taken
[1:02:10] the seals off of himself Christ taking
[1:02:12] the seals off of himself
[1:02:15] God bringing those angels to bring that
[1:02:17] it too was on a mountain
[1:02:20] we have the same thing now what must we
[1:02:22] do we must stay close to those things
[1:02:24] lest our hearts become idolatrous
[1:02:28] lest our hearts are pulled to other gods
[1:02:31] lest our hearts are pulled to another
[1:02:32] Jesus Paul said I fear that you you
[1:02:35] preached another Jesus
[1:02:37] stay close to the word I'm not even
[1:02:39] asking you to stay close to me
[1:02:42] stay in the word
[1:02:43] get in the word
[1:02:45] get your Bible study the word of God
[1:02:47] stay in the word of God
[1:02:49] that's what he's telling us to do
[1:02:52] and I think it's the cure for
[1:02:55] lukewarmness if we stay in the word can
[1:02:56] you say Amen
[1:02:58] it's the cure for lukewarmness
[1:03:00] so we'll read a couple of things as we
[1:03:02] close here I want it I'll get to this uh
[1:03:04] next time but
[1:03:05] does it say to continue this teaching
[1:03:08] our children
[1:03:10] the law of Moses the Commandments of
[1:03:13] Moses the statues and judgments does it
[1:03:15] continue to say to do that when the
[1:03:17] people of Israel got into the promised
[1:03:19] land the answer is yes
[1:03:21] Moses my servant is dead Joshua 1 Moses
[1:03:24] my servant is dead
[1:03:28] let's read it together
[1:03:36] Joshua 1. now after the death of Moses
[1:03:38] the servant of the Lord it came to pass
[1:03:40] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[1:03:42] of none Moses Minister saying Moses my
[1:03:46] servant is dead
[1:03:48] I wish people had a revelation of that
[1:03:52] I mean talk about for today
[1:03:55] because they're still trying to continue
[1:03:57] on as if he's still alive
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:01] but they need to realize that everything
[1:04:03] that all all that his ministry is meant
[1:04:05] to do and left us with is to take the
[1:04:08] people into their inheritance
[1:04:10] Joshua being the type of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:13] okay but Moses my servant is dead his
[1:04:16] ministry is over as far as his physical
[1:04:19] Ministry it is over right
[1:04:22] right now therefore rise go to this go
[1:04:24] over this Jordan down to this people
[1:04:25] under the lamb which I do give them even
[1:04:27] to the children of Israel every place at
[1:04:29] the soul of your foot shall shall tread
[1:04:31] upon that have I given unto you as I
[1:04:33] said unto Moses because that was the
[1:04:34] purpose of incident Moses bring him out
[1:04:36] of Egypt bring him through the
[1:04:37] Wilderness but to get to the promised
[1:04:39] land to get to The Inheritance that's
[1:04:41] the purpose from the Wilderness and this
[1:04:43] Lebanon even into the Great River the
[1:04:45] river Euphrates and all the land of the
[1:04:47] Hittites
[1:04:48] verse 5 there shall not any man be able
[1:04:50] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:04:52] life as I was with Moses Joshua so I
[1:04:54] will be with thee I will not fail thee
[1:04:56] nor for safety be strong and of good
[1:04:58] courage for under this people shall thou
[1:05:01] divided inheritance the land which I
[1:05:03] swear unto the fathers to give them only
[1:05:05] be thou strong and very courageous that
[1:05:06] thou mayest observed to do according to
[1:05:09] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:05:11] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[1:05:13] or to the left the thou mayest what
[1:05:15] Prosper whether it's so ever thou goest
[1:05:18] this book of the law shall not Depart of
[1:05:20] thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate here
[1:05:22] we go again
[1:05:24] here it is again
[1:05:26] yeah so let's let's get rid of that
[1:05:28] thought that once they come into their
[1:05:30] inheritance that we can ditch the law of
[1:05:34] Moses that we can ditch the statutes of
[1:05:37] Moses
[1:05:39] sorry Moses is dead so let's let's ditch
[1:05:43] that and get into our inheritance no you
[1:05:46] can't get into your inheritance if you
[1:05:48] leave and don't meditate in those things
[1:05:50] that he gave
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] the book of the law shall not depart out
[1:05:55] of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[1:05:58] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:06:01] observed to do according to all that is
[1:06:03] written therein for then Thou shalt make
[1:06:06] thy way prosperous and then thou should
[1:06:09] have not just success but good success
[1:06:12] I'm preaching about blessed families you
[1:06:14] want to bless family hear the word of
[1:06:15] God
[1:06:17] we're going into our inheritance friends
[1:06:18] I can't wait to our I can't wait to just
[1:06:21] receive it all because I know when I
[1:06:22] receive it all I know I'm getting out of
[1:06:24] here I have a new body that's a part of
[1:06:27] that inheritance
[1:06:28] I'm ready to go come quickly Lord Jesus
[1:06:30] can you say Amen but there never do we
[1:06:34] have a Biblical principle that we move
[1:06:35] forward in those things and leave what
[1:06:38] Moses brought what the prophet brought
[1:06:39] it never works that way because he uses
[1:06:41] that word and the anointing of it to
[1:06:43] bring the people into their hearings
[1:06:46] praise the Lord the word still anointed
[1:06:49] now brother Brandon says here as we
[1:06:50] close
[1:06:52] he's speaking and praying he says heal
[1:06:54] the sick tonight father make the blind
[1:06:56] to see the deaf to hear the dumb to
[1:06:57] speak the cripples to walk my
[1:07:00] cure the heart trouble cancer in all
[1:07:02] different kinds of troubles
[1:07:04] God I pray that you'll mend up broken
[1:07:06] homes notice he's mentioned in the blind
[1:07:08] to see the deaf to hear the cripples to
[1:07:11] walk and then he says men broken homes
[1:07:14] and make the ones that in homes that's
[1:07:17] indifferent fathers indifferent to their
[1:07:18] mothers
[1:07:19] mothers indifferent to their fathers who
[1:07:21] doesn't pray
[1:07:22] give them an experience tonight that
[1:07:25] they'll start a family altar at their
[1:07:26] home Granite Lord
[1:07:29] and he says another place you fathers
[1:07:31] you mothers are you ready to establish
[1:07:33] altar in your house
[1:07:35] are you ready to established the family
[1:07:37] Altar and take the tell take that
[1:07:39] television out are you ready to take the
[1:07:41] deck of cards off the table them comic
[1:07:43] books that your children's reading
[1:07:45] preparing their little mind for the
[1:07:46] blast that the devil is going to give
[1:07:48] them are you ready to establish the old
[1:07:50] family altar again
[1:07:52] or do you just want to continue on the
[1:07:55] Way You Are
[1:07:56] you want to continue on you're not in
[1:07:58] the condition of the coming yet but I
[1:08:00] pray that you're like Samson you see the
[1:08:03] price and you're ready Lord let me die
[1:08:06] with them and Samson he's referring to
[1:08:08] is the one who said even though it
[1:08:09] didn't look like there was any hope he
[1:08:11] said once more Lord
[1:08:14] that's what he's referring to if you
[1:08:16] feel you're not in the spirit of Revival
[1:08:17] and you're not dead and drying up
[1:08:19] you can say the same thing as samton
[1:08:21] Samson can you say man
[1:08:24] Lord once more
[1:08:26] fill me with your power once more and
[1:08:29] then he establishes that and ties that
[1:08:31] excuse me ties that together with
[1:08:33] mothers and fathers are you ready to
[1:08:35] establish family altar in your home are
[1:08:36] you ready to apply the token to your
[1:08:38] home and last week I was reading the
[1:08:39] token where he gave the specifics of of
[1:08:42] getting the dirt out of your home and
[1:08:43] that's what it really is friends we
[1:08:45] could go in Long discussions about what
[1:08:47] to do and what to watch I was saying but
[1:08:49] he's referring to the dirt
[1:08:51] and most television is dirt
[1:08:54] come on now let's grow up and realize it
[1:08:57] and so that's why he says something of
[1:08:59] that that's bringing dirt in your home
[1:09:00] that has to be purged to apply the token
[1:09:02] so it's the dirt you get out and you
[1:09:04] mentioned the short skirts you mentioned
[1:09:05] a bunch of things that we read last
[1:09:07] Wednesday night okay he says apply the
[1:09:09] token to your home get the dirt get the
[1:09:10] trash out of the home buy because that
[1:09:12] doesn't fit in a home that's being word
[1:09:15] centered
[1:09:17] and then I read later where it says now
[1:09:19] when you apply it apply it with love and
[1:09:22] believe that it's going to help
[1:09:25] because I see a lot of people apply it
[1:09:26] with no love
[1:09:28] you say man lost their marriages lost
[1:09:30] their families lost respect because they
[1:09:33] didn't apply it in love
[1:09:35] that better be the motivation of the
[1:09:37] love of God
[1:09:39] and a heart for God children I'm doing
[1:09:40] this as a love of God and and and let a
[1:09:43] daddy and mommy see the the image in
[1:09:46] front of those children and I hope
[1:09:48] you're learning something from me
[1:09:48] friends I'm not a perfect father of
[1:09:50] perfect uh daddy by any means or husband
[1:09:53] my wife will tell you but you know what
[1:09:56] I just want to share these things out of
[1:09:57] the world with us because God's given us
[1:09:58] word that if we apply it our families
[1:10:01] can be blessed
[1:10:03] it's not easy to apply sometimes
[1:10:05] but these things when you apply it apply
[1:10:07] it in love
[1:10:09] and I can imagine those fathers sitting
[1:10:12] down in Paul's day I'm closing now
[1:10:15] just in case you're worried
[1:10:18] I can imagine those fathers sitting down
[1:10:20] in Paul's day
[1:10:23] and sitting with their kids in that hour
[1:10:24] and saying no
[1:10:27] guys I I I've studied the
[1:10:30] some of the Old Testament and I I've
[1:10:31] studied things and but God has spoken to
[1:10:35] this man and Jesus spoke to him and I
[1:10:38] believe he's been called in this age to
[1:10:40] be able to set the order for the church
[1:10:41] in this age and we're receiving his
[1:10:43] letters from these different places and
[1:10:45] we're you know those letters were just
[1:10:47] letters Paul sent to the local churches
[1:10:49] and they just get up and read them they
[1:10:51] just got up and read what Paul said
[1:10:53] and he's saying sons and daughters
[1:10:56] I believe God has moved upon this
[1:10:58] generation
[1:10:59] he spoke to us so we're going to apply
[1:11:02] these things to our home
[1:11:04] I really do believe that fathers sat
[1:11:07] down and did that and some of them maybe
[1:11:09] even has said as Paul as Peter because
[1:11:11] later on Peter says
[1:11:13] and even our beloved brother Paul who
[1:11:16] has said some things that are hard to be
[1:11:18] understood
[1:11:21] even Peter said some things Paul said
[1:11:23] were hard to
[1:11:25] swallow
[1:11:27] but you never see Paul Peter wavering
[1:11:29] to divide against Paul
[1:11:31] because there was a position there God
[1:11:33] gave him
[1:11:34] Peter had position too
[1:11:36] because but because of that office he
[1:11:39] said we need to follow these things we
[1:11:40] need to adhere to these things and I
[1:11:42] believe Peter did as a father I believe
[1:11:43] other fathers did it in that day age in
[1:11:46] that time and that's why I try to show
[1:11:48] you God never breaks his scriptural
[1:11:49] patterns he brought his law through the
[1:11:51] Moses he brought the word for the Moses
[1:11:53] for the people to know how to live in
[1:11:54] the age first Exodus second Exodus here
[1:11:57] Jesus is filling the people with the
[1:11:59] Holy Ghost and splitting his Spirit into
[1:12:00] them speaking to Paul to bring to bring
[1:12:03] the message to the Gentiles for that day
[1:12:04] Paul lays out all the church order and
[1:12:07] all these things and marriage and
[1:12:09] divorce situations and situations we
[1:12:11] didn't know about but he's laying it out
[1:12:13] he's laying the order for the age and
[1:12:16] God
[1:12:17] has done the same thing in our
[1:12:18] generation before the Third Exodus
[1:12:22] let's Stand Together
[1:12:24] we are a blessed people no doubt about
[1:12:27] it
[1:12:39] father we thank you tonight Lord that we
[1:12:41] could
[1:12:43] hear from your word the scriptures that
[1:12:45] speak to us we pray for the parents and
[1:12:47] the families
[1:12:49] and Lord we
[1:12:51] you're aware more even than I am of
[1:12:53] course that there's
[1:12:54] families that get into situations
[1:12:56] sometimes or
[1:12:58] their struggles because of the hour we
[1:13:00] live in
[1:13:02] so Lord We Don't Preach a certain image
[1:13:04] in certain just a certain thing we just
[1:13:06] preach how the families can be blessed
[1:13:08] even
[1:13:09] moms raising children on their own
[1:13:11] without a daddy
[1:13:13] or a daddy raising children without the
[1:13:15] mom different situations speaking to
[1:13:18] young people don't have their families
[1:13:19] yet
[1:13:20] but yet Lord your word
[1:13:22] is is important to be said because Lord
[1:13:28] we all need to hear these things because
[1:13:30] this is your thoughts in your mind
[1:13:32] of how you would bless families
[1:13:35] Lord help me as a father help me as a
[1:13:37] husband help these brothers Lord be the
[1:13:40] daddies of their homes that you desire
[1:13:43] them to be I know they desire to be that
[1:13:46] Lord not that they be theologians Lord
[1:13:48] and know everything of the word but God
[1:13:51] humbly just taking that word and
[1:13:52] breaking it
[1:13:54] the bread of life to their families Lord
[1:13:56] and making it the center of their lives
[1:13:58] it's not so much Lord sometimes what we
[1:14:00] read or that we study but it's what we
[1:14:03] live
[1:14:04] live it's the word lived in front of
[1:14:06] them
[1:14:07] or that's that's the main thing so I
