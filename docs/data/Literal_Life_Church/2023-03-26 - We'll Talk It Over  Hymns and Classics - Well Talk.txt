On March 26, 2023, Literal Life Church hosted a community outreach event, "Hymns and Classics Sing-Along". We pressed the record button that evening and received such positive response from the community afterward that we decided to make the audio recording available for free to the public. 

We'll Talk It Over

Verse 1
Though shadows deepen and my heart bleeds
I will not question the way He leads
This side of heaven we know in part
I will not question a broken heart

Chorus
We'll talk it over in the by and by
We'll talk it over, my Lord and I
I'll ask the reasons, He'll tell me why
When we talk it over in the by and by

Verse 2
I'll hide my heartache behind a smile
And wait for reasons 'til after while
And though He tries me, I know I'll find
That all my burdens are silver-lined

Written by Ira Stanphill
