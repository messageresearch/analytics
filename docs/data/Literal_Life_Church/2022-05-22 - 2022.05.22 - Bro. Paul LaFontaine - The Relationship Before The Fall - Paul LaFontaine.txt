TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 2 and verse 21 and the lord god calls the deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so god did all of this and then he separated into them into two vessels they started out as one spirit created in the image of god which god's a spirit so man was a spirit man first and then chapter two then he he breathes the breath of life into a vessel uh adam and both the feminine both adam and eve were in that one vessel then he made him a vessel so that was the next stage and now he takes something out of adam a rib out of adam and he makes a second vessel so now you have the same the same spirit masculine and feminine and also part of the nature of god and now you have two vessels though but still one and notice what god does this and then he brings this woman to the man after after this sleep and he performs surgery on him and and and brings this one now he brings the woman and now adam's going to speak and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now this is an interesting way to look at it because we know that they're standing there now as two vessels so we could say in our minds no they're not one flesh they're two two vessels but the oneness is so strong and they're still of one spirit that the conclusion to god and the conclusion to adam is they're still one flesh and i want you to catch something in this in speaking about relationships because if we catch this then the way that we look at one another will be changed and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed i'd like to bring in the new testament in second corinthians chapter 5 second corinthians chapter 5 and verse 14 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead spiritually speaking now uh we we we see what paul's saying that there's the love of christ is motivating us and he's really going to be talking about how we look at one another how we look at others the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge if one if one died for all then we're all dead how many know we're all in the same state we all need the lord and then when he went to death then we could die to ourself we all die to ourself and the new man comes to life if that happens within the holy ghost filled believers then we have if god looks at it that way we have to look at it that way that we've all died to our old man in christ and the new man is living in this brother or sister i'm looking at if we look at the old man if we keep looking at the flesh we'll be stumbled god's not stumbled at looking at us he can overlook our flesh he looked beyond our faults and seen our need i'm glad god's not looking at my flesh today but if god's looking at us that way and you remember brother bram said he's looking through the blood when he sees you he can only see you through the blood so if god's looking at us that way then we have to begin to see and this is what he talks about whether uh he says uh and they excuse me if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they would which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth from now on from henceforth no we no man after the flesh he's picking up the original principle that he could look at two vessels adam could look at her as a different vessel now but he still said she's she's one flesh with me it's still one flesh and he didn't even look at the flesh he's looking at we're one in spirit okay so and and so wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we know have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so he's fulfilled his fleshly body days three and a half years on earth 33 years on earth so we don't even know christ and you remember brother brahm said in christ the mystery he said paul knew paul knew jesus in a deeper way by the mystery of christ even greater than the disciples paul never seen jesus in the flesh we would think all the disciples they got a higher position they were with them and fished with them in the flesh but he said paul actually had a greater revelation or a greater view of christ and he never seen him in the flesh so we move to this mystery of what it's not that you see what's going on in the flesh but you see the mystery behind it let me finish this wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we know we have known christ after us yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new praise the lord father thank you for your word may you blessed and anointed today may i lose myself lord into your anointing i pray in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated now i'm taking some points out of this small section here in the time just before the fall if you were looking in your bibles if you're still looking it's in genesis 3 where the serpent comes in and eve is alone without her husband and the serpent comes in and he begins reasoning with her and then we know the fall there's a lot of preachers that preach on the fall where we fell from and it's important to see where we fell but i was going to concentrate in the scriptures just before the fall so i want to title this the relationship before the fall the relationship before the fall just before satan moved in all of us are aware of what the fall has brought us brother brandt went so far as to say every hospital every ambulance that you hear is all come back to a woman reasoning with the serpent with the word and everything fell because she fell from the word the state that we've been in for 6 000 years all became from a woman reasoning with the word and satan attacking her when her husband wasn't present satan attacking her and coming and now she everything has come from the fall so we're familiar with those things but i'm just going to talk a little bit about this section and brother branham refers to this and so i want to speak of this because i believe that this state that they were in just before the fall speaks of our walk with the lord right now and that is that calvary has opened up the way back into relationship to god all the relationship we lost in the garden of eden calvary has opened the way to bring us back into relationship again and these are foundational statements many of you know them but i'm assuming maybe many don't because i i need you to catch the foundation i want to tell you again that everything that the fall brought in the beginning calvary has the power to restore us back to all of it again god is taking us back to eden again and he's not stopping halfway with you he's taking us all the way back before the fall he's reversing all everything can you say man so if you've got broken relationships and you've got broken things and you've come from baggage in your family and all kinds of divorce and everything like that that's all as a result of the fall can you say man but i'm here to tell you in our soul level and then god bringing us back to new bodies the power of calvary is restoring us back to everything that has been lost amen so that is calvary and so christ died and he made a way to come back into union by the holy ghost and that is the only way and the only basis for coming back into relationship with god can you say amen the only basis into coming back in a relationship with god is not just calvary because calvary took care of our sins so that we could receive the spirit of god it is only by receiving the holy ghost that we come into contact and relationship with god that we lost in the garden it's not by religion it's not by do's and don'ts it's not by what you wear it's not by some denomination it's not by shaking the preacher's hand it's not by doing good works there's only one thing that would bring us back into relationship that adam and eve lost and that's that we receive his spirit and his nature in our soul that is the only way back in the relationship now i know people can say well i talk to the lord i love the lord it's interesting on the street if you ask somebody if they love christ most people will say yes there's no evidence in their life they don't love the word they're not they're not ever around the word but if you just said i love the i love oh sure i love the lord do you pray of course i pray but you see now that's not the relationship adam and eve have had there's there's a relationship that's a oneness by nature that you come back into that is not just a religion that you pray and you hope god answers back this is a god that answers back can you say amen and one of the ways he answers you back is to fill you with the holy spirit that you have the same desire that is in this bible to live the word and there's no bucking up against it there's no rebellion in your soul there's no desire says i want part of this and i want that's what people do is micromanage parts of the message brother i want this i went no all that's going with the holy ghost and down here it says i'm ready to submit to the word of god i'm ready because i love him because i want him i i love him so much the only way the only grounds of fellowship that god has ever laid down for himself in his church is the oneness of himself in the people that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union to be united with him forever and that union takes place by the filling of the holy ghost everybody in agreement not by religion not because you go to a message church you only come back in contact with an eden relationship by the true holy ghost so now it's by spirit that we're joined together in this union no other way to be in oneness with god there is no other way you can try other ways you can try works you can try mental discipline you can try vowels the catholic church makes vows of poverty the catholic church has penance they're the first one who begin to develop ways to try to get in relationship with god through works you do penance uh you do you you you pray the rosary you take vows of poverty and that's why luther was so distraught because he tried all of his life to do this he was if you watch the movie or study his life he'd become distraught mother teresa was the same way if you watch her doc read her diaries now which is available this is a woman that actually died without peace and without settled in god and she's a hero as far as what she did in india and places with how she served and all of her life she served as that was the way her entrance and relationship with god but if you read her diaries she's a he's a dying woman and she's a woman who never ever felt satisfied and made contact with god now i'm not putting her out of heaven i wouldn't do that i don't have a right to do that what i'm saying to you is that you can do all the works and be a hero in good works and still not come back to that relationship of eden there's only one way that it comes the true holy spirit his nature comes in your nature your old nature dies and now he's living on the inside it's the only way back. it's not psychology it's not through 10 steps to getting better it's not through any of that now i believe that there are certain things that can help people i'm different than some preachers that i believe that you there's certain things that help people i'm not against anything that helps somebody whether it's a physical doctor or an emotional doctor i'm not against it because with the end of the day if they help a person if they help a young boy a young girl they help you in some way to help you through things if some medicines help you i'm not against that because at the end of the day i'm going to give the glory to god but i'm not going to accuse somebody and be against doctors and psychologists that would help somebody and if you read the message you'll find brother branham's attitude is the same way but i want to make it clear there is no psychology of any doctor that it will ever replace the new birth in the holy ghost and the change of your desires that's what you need to pray for for your children not that oh they're a good person i hope there'll be a better place hope they make it church you need to pray that they have a conversion will they love the lord i'm not talking about loving the lord i'm talking about a conversion the new birth that by the way jesus said ye must be born again so you know and every person individually has to cut brother brahman says that it takes a sword of faith to cut away unbelief he said if you want healing you cut away the unbelief and take your healing if you want salvation there's a certain cutting away we got two young people here today you know why they've come to baptism they had to take a little their young their young lives seven nine years old their young lives somehow god moved on their heart and somehow even at their young age had to cut away the unbelief in order to say i want to be saved i want god's salvation for me can you imagine and some of us adults can't even do that but children had to take some part of the sword of faith and cut away that hindrance that says that'll keep them away their whole life i don't need to do it i'm not i'm not like everybody else i don't want it whatever fear you got they had to cut it away you needed to cut it away today because when you cut away all the unbelief then you say i want god's salvation for me somebody say praise the lord this morning so now vows of poverty penance seminary study of the study of the mysteries because you even in this message could study all the mysteries of the bible in this message and still not have the real thing i've listened to preachers that could astound that just astounded me how they could preach the mysteries of this message and today they're not even serving the lord it's because first corinthians says though i understand all mysteries and have not the real thing i am nothing [Applause] so it's not it's not studying all the mysteries and becoming intellectual and know all the quotes it's at the end of the day it's not about that it's about a new birth it's about relationship can you say man and religion is a far cry from relationship religion is a far cry from relationship it's it's not that i love god i talk to god he's done miracles for me it's by the experience of the holy ghost coming into you by nature and changing your nature the only way to love and to live his word is through the holy ghost because the other way is miserable you try to take the principles of god and the principles of this message and you try to live them without the holy ghost that's a miserable life you think the guy out in the bar is living a miserable life no it's more miserable to try to live this word without the nature of the spirit that's why people exit they leave the message whatever because they've been trying so hard trying i'm trying to do this right i'm trying to do this right and yet if you haven't asked deeply enough the lord i forget while all i have to do i'm going to have one prayer i'm going to stay here and keep seeking what i need by the holy ghost until you change me lord you're going to be like jacob with that angel can you say amen i'm not letting you go until you change me that's the prayer that you need and i'm not speaking to everybody in that i know some of you have the holy spirit in your life and you'll see the evidence of that by obeying and saying amen to the word of god you'll see the fruit of it but i'm challenging you this morning not to make you afraid of it but i'm challenging you don't try to get back in a relationship with god by just nodding at the word of just going to brother paul's church i won't let you be deceived like that go before god and say god give me what i need to change my nature give my children what they need and quit playing all these games to justify them i'm not justifying my children i love them i will never not accept them but at the same time they need what i got at 16 years old they need a personal relationship with jesus christ by the holy ghost they need a new birth so i encourage you to seek it whatever age you are here this morning because religion is not relationship religion is not relationship it's a miserable life to try to live this without the nature of god within you as i said we have been restored to this type of oneness again all believers with the true holy spirit in them here's here's one that you can remember this week how many is a believer this morning all believers with this true holy ghost in them have in their soul have fully been restored back to eden in a soul level and now in a soul level you still got this flesh to bring under subjection but in their soul you're not working your way back to eden if you've got the holy ghost you're already back to eden already because you're already in fellowship with him sin has been removed from the your nature the nature of sin the conscience of sin has been removed at the control tower and now the nature of god is there and that's how you have true fellowship and relationship with him can you say amen you are already back to eden you've already arrived back at that relationship already you're not working your way back you're back that's powerful i could preach on that little while you can become a new creation inside the nature and conscience of sin is dead but we are similar with the man and the woman just before the fall as i refer back to it again they were one with god and one with one another but they were in two different vessels right now we don't have our full restoration in our body yet so i want to take some points here out of oneness if you guys have pulled those quotes up i want to take some points out of them one must say oneness message wonderful message and it's very long and and so i listened to it all the way through and i'm going to be taking some points from this the oneness the oneness now the first man and the first woman in the garden of eden was perfect in harmony with god so much that god could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with adam and eve now that is perfect oneness god see there's no walls there's no sin there's nothing breaking the relationship there's no condemnation none of that and so that's why it's a perfect harmony now that is a perfect oneness god in his creation god's speaking lip to ear with adam and eve and they were so perfect in harmony with god till they were one with god god and his family was one any man and his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with one another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart obviously that can happen if there's something in the family that can move them apart then it's not right the family is broken somewhere they should all be one father so he's saying the best case scenario in in a family that's following the word and following the holy ghost and the parents have the holy ghost the best case scenario is that they're walking in harmony and the family is not broken they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with a parent parent with children all in agreement now the world has made us cynical to say that can oh boy that can't happen today that hasn't happened for 10 years in my family well there's probably a reason for that because he's given us the best case scenario if you become one with god then you have the potential to be one in your family you have the potential to have a good oneness in your marriage can you say amen don't ever let the devil tell you and settle for second best that it's gonna be this way forever submit yourself to the holy ghost can you say amen and he says the family should be one with one another amen but he says go back to that one he says that is there something that moves them apart now that's what we've got to notice because there are some things that try to move us apart there are things that move us apart there are things that get into our home there are things that get in between sometimes people get in between and break relationship of a marriage their oneness and all of a sudden some family member gets in between and they're divided whatever it is it's not the person it's the devil can you say man but but you say it's never right for them to be broken up it's never right for them to have a lack of oneness next next quote and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture that's god's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family adam and eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with god was because god's nature was in them that's what i just preached to you the only way to be one with god is his nature is in you it's the only way every other thing is a religion but his nature sets up ownership and is in the control tower amen and if you'll notice how that eve was united with adam she became part of him god did you notice in genesis 1 27 he created male and female created he them now the man both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then then god took from his side a rib so before masculine and feminine are in the same spirit and they're in the same vessel than with adam next quote did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit so when he took this rib out and made another vessel of the woman she was a byproduct but they and that made her different that made her separate but never were they separated in spirit it's just a key point to relationships friends because we've had 6 000 years here after the fall of of seeing of being taught to judge by the flesh you don't think that influences us when we get married and become a family and clashes come and the differences of men and women come and and then somebody doesn't have the holy ghost so they got sin they're dealing with in life they got the nature of sin you don't think that all these brings clashes it does and we are taught we are taught by hollywood we're taught by the system of this world to judge people according to what you see and there are quirks about them and into these days they make fun of the quirks you go through high school they're going to take little funny things like your ears being big and your freckles whatever it is it's so cruel all of a sudden they're going to capitalize on it they're going to put you in a certain category like a redhead us redheads hannah us redheads has suffered terribly through our lives us freckle face people have suffered terrible the persecution the trial we live in a world that judges people by what they see in the flesh i read something this morning that and some writers said he said he said what a world we live in he says now we're i'm going to get to the word honor here in a minute honor do we live in a world where they honor the poor we honor the rich the rich people get honor whether they deserve it or not just because they're rich they wear the right clothes do we honor the people that are unpopular in this world no we honor the movie stars we honor the sports stars we lift them up and praise them and a lot of them most of them are just frankly dirty living people most of the hollywood stars if not all you know some of the this trial that's going on and these things if you watch it some of the stuff the way these people live it's just animals it's absolute animals but these are the people that put out the movies that's leading the whole nation and leading our teenagers and we praise them and we give them awards they walk up during the wards and slap somebody because they get their temper up they're still justified they're animals they live like animals and the reason is is not to judge them but they don't have the holy ghost and when you don't have the holy ghost brother bram says you become an animal you become like a man will rape another woman because he don't have the holy ghost he's it liv he treats her like an animal because he's an animal so six thousand years of this of judging according to the flesh judging according how much money we don't honor the poor but i can tell you that the bible says as we come into the new testament paul speaks about the body of christ and you know what he says he says the one that's in the body of christ that's dishonor or least likely to succeed or the least among us that's the one that we should be honoring the world doesn't function that way that's the one we should honor the one that doesn't have the money doesn't have the prestige doesn't have the right clothes doesn't have very much money praise the lord okay so did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took the side of adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was a part of adam for he was both male and female speaking spiritually both masculine and feminist now don't you see that great picture we in flesh now he goes to us we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit now he's talking about those with the holy ghost but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit but the spirit of the living god now if he says that i believe it's the truth can you say amen but we have to look at it that way because if we don't we'll still judge one another after the flesh next one and that's what the correct union is and that's what the correct union of the church is spirit of his spirit word of his words never deviating from the word the real true believer will not compromise on any word remember it was just one word that eve compromised on one word but the true believer won't compromise on any word i'll hold the sword of faith with in faith rather the sword of the word and claim every divine promise god made that's it they were he's talking about adam and eve before the fall now that's why i'm preaching this adame just before the fall they were god's examples to us what we should be them ever present never falling when never failing when they spoke god answered he watched them daily night when they lay down to sleep he watched over them in the daytime he guided them fed them loved them commune with them constantly all the time they were in god's image and god was in them that's what makes a fellowship that's what makes the union it's god in his church that's the union much could be said got many places to go united with him is eternal and the only way we can unite with him is to come every bit of his word that's right take every promise and believe it so so friends this is following him it's following his word now what you don't know you see that's different but when he shows you his word and there's a promise laying there of salvation there's a promise laying there of healing there's something in his word you're not running from it you're taking the sword of faith i'm cutting every bit of unbelief that i feel in my head in my heart because i'm wanting that promise so you say believe every word believe every word believe what he shows you there's the promise he showed it to me cut away the devils that are telling you to stay back cut away the devils or tell you i don't need to give my heart to god i don't need to yield him you cut it away say no i want it now you're bringing yourself look what brother braham says here now eve was united until she broke one word doubt in one word that separator every word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word look at this now so we can be in god united because adam and eve before the fall before the disbelieving word was an example of what we could be in him to be united with him his life to be separated from his death now if we follow his commandments so now he's talking about following to me following is somebody walking out ahead showing me the path and i'm following you know i may not be down here yet but i'm i'm whatever he's showing me in the promises of word i'm following it now look what he says now if we follow his commands we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that especially now after the fall of sin and we're in sin born bodies we gonna make mistakes and anybody who says they don't gotta they have one mistake and that's a lying problem kind of like parents who say but my kids they never lie well yeah they do because you just lied all right it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules is following his word following what he said to do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles god pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of duty so to me this doesn't say perfection yet it says i'm following the word i'm not rebellious saying i ain't doing that i ain't doing that i don't need salvation i'm different than everybody else i'm resisting it that's not following the word but it's what he shows you i'm i'm ready to follow it i'm i'm walking in the path of duty and under that look what he says next under that path of duty but if he's off the path of duty god's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of duty god's obligated to him knowing that he's a just man or a woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of duty i want to live a life where i come under some type of protection that god's obligated to me even when i make a mistake and ask forgiveness because i'm on the path headed towards him god's obligated me friends god's obligated to you you're following that word and walking in the path of duty not out here dabbling in the things of the world and going the opposite when you know what the word says to do god's not obligated to you're losing your protection that's why sometimes people they dabble in worldly things privately and think it's not going to affect them it's not going to affect their family so they're doing it privately thinking this is my own deal i can do my own thing no you watch things happen in your family unconsciously because you're not in the path of duty you're not following him and you watch that start to unravel in your children and it passes it on to other generations you think you're just yourself no things pass on to your children you got rebellion in there and you haven't overcome it then then watch the path of the children not always in every situation but these things trickle down and so you can't privately hold something that you know is against this word you know it and you're you're going to privately go the opposite direction you're going to feel the fruits come from that you're going to start seeing fruits come from that it's better you own up to it yourself i don't know where my children are but i got to get myself straightened out here come on parents let me hear you say amen amen you can blame your children you can blame the preacher you can bring the church you can blame everybody else but you need to be singing it's a me it's a me it's a meal lord standing in the need of prayer because if you start with that i believe god will start to you honor god honor his word honor his servants then you'll watch that sometimes it takes years you'll watch that honor begin to trickle down to your children all right praise the lord still love me all right so that's the end of that quote as long as i love that god's obligated to me i'm holding on to that he's obligated to you when you're on the path of duty even making some mistakes sometimes don't justify your mistakes don't keep doing something in a pattern that you keep just saying well god will forgive me no no no i'm not talking about that i'm talking about you make a mistake it's not a willful thing i'm just doing this no but you make a mistake god forgive me i didn't mean to do that you get back on the path of duty god is obligated to you praise the lord so now and it's not just let me just move on here it's you had it's not just you believing the word but you're heading in its direction not the opposite direction not rebellion not i'm not going to do that i'm going to feed and taste on these things privately when the war the word warns you and you know what's wrong with the word while you're on the word journey he is obligated to you to protect you to forgive you but if you're going in the other direction you lose relationship with god god is not obligated to you now here's some points from the text in genesis 2. they were one in spirit and god called their name adam okay second then god breathed into a vessel in genesis 2 verse 7 and the lord formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life the man became a living soul so now he becomes a vessel he was spirit man first with adam and eve inside him now he's a flesh man with one vessel but the spirit is all one with masculine and feminine inside of it still all right so then then god comes down and says in genesis 2 he still called at him then he says it's not good for man to be alone i'll make him a helpmate right and then he he then god causes a sleep to come on adam and he takes the rib out he takes as many ministers have said i don't mean to repeat but it's a good thing to repeat you know he didn't take apart out of adam's foot to make the woman or the brain can you say man but something right real close to his heart did you ever notice they took that spear and pierced right up there under jesus and water and blood came out because the spirit in that was going to come back on the day of pentecost this would be the second eve coming back that's one with the second adam by what by spirit took that rib right something very close to his heart and he forms this beautiful beautiful feminine part in a different vessel looked different even acted different and a few weeks ago i went into the differences and and i'm not going to get into that day today again but you just i the lord keeps bringing me back to this this this situation or this oneness just before the fall because it's close to us in that we deal with different vessels with different personalities and different backgrounds and we can judge people based upon fleshly things and miss that we are one he takes her out and he goes over there and wakes adam up and then he comes and brings eve over and bible says he brought eve to adam and he's waking up and he's rubbing his eyes you know and he's looking and and uh brother ramp said some wonderful things about this first moment that adam sees she wasn't even called eve yet but this first moment where he's rubbing his eyes and he opens up and he sees this beautiful other vessel that god gave him and there's some there look there's something there looking at the flesh because he was he was overwhelmed but we have to be careful that we don't become fleshy too much in that that he was overwhelmed just by the flesh because his words that come out of his mouth was not like some people make it very fleshly like it was all remember there's a holy veil on their eyes so the nakedness and the physical was not noticed yet some people get married only on physical attraction bad foundation terrible foundation and some people have got married that way and god shows them what true oneness is later and they come to a real oneness in marriage it can happen but the best foundation is that you understand by revelation what oneness is what love is what christian marriage is before you even have a girlfriend he comes up and god brought it and then now notice now now god just once he brings eve up to him notice it's not a response of the flesh it's a response of oneness right brings her up there and if it had been fleshed like the world says i heard preacher saying something about that's how she got her name is the first thing adam says whoa man that's not in the bible so he's a man and that's how she got woman is oh man please don't be offended i there's another preacher who said it not me that's you know that's the type of response when you've been living on hollywood your whole life whoa sister wow yeah i like what you got going on all these other statements and it's all flesh you don't have to know the personality you don't have to know the character of a woman just judged all by body and flesh and sleep with them the first night it's all fleshly no oneness no unity no character but adam's got the glory of god on him remember i said the glory of god brings oneness it's a revelation of oneness he's got the glory of god and that's why he can look at her different so he comes up and brother branham explains it first time he sees her you know and and the hebrew writers take this word bone of my bone flesh my flesh and it's actually they say it was a song it was a song so he's he's so overwhelmed by the first time he sees eve it's like he's honey you knew i was going to use you as an example today danny he is so overwhelmed the first time his eyes she's got a gingham dress on today and the whole thing he's so overwhelmed by this that he just becomes a songwriter never says he was before but now he comes he's a songwriter he's just so overwhelmed and i think there was some romance involved there you know and he yes he just blurts out this and the hebrew writer says just it's the most affectionate romantic i'm going to get into the deeper things of what he meant by bone and bone flesh but when he utters that it's a song he looks at her and it's not a fleshly thing it's it's she first words she he just sings let me think of something here you are flesh of my flesh bone of my bone there's no one closer you are flushing my flesh oh there's no one closer and he just goes on and on and then he says you shall be called woman because you came from me and then he says this is your three things you're bone of my bone your flesh and my flesh out you should be called woman because you came from the man and then he says and the two are one flesh that's all oneness that's all revelation of oneness even the vessel is different and if he was a man he had to notice she was pretty brother brown said she was a pretty one he said he grabs her hand and starts walking through the garden there is no death there is no sorrow there's nothing between them and they start walking he's got this beautiful wife that he's looking at and they're walking through that garden and she says something like you know that's not quite where it should be kind of like a woman when she's in the house different nature i don't like that there i don't like that table josiah that don't fit anymore so at the garage sale yesterday i bought the table off the man because the wife nuked it that's going that's one of his bachelor days got you covered i'm buying that for you bud just wait and see if my wife accepts it in our home we were laughing at the in the office that you josiah because somebody said to you when you're a bachelor you're buying all this nice stuff and they said you're spending too much money because your wife when you get married someday she's going to have you get rid of all of it i'm glad sister ashley's not in here right now she his brother said she's she said i like this is he and he just speaks and changes that river and changes where that's at see this moves this mountain and just but the harmony the fellowship i got to get back up here to my notes because i want to read some things about this bone of my bone flesh of my it's pretty romantic but there's some deeper meaning to it and brother brahm says i think adam and eve was the most perfect couple that ever walked on earth i could see adam and his not as great shoulders like barn doors but a perfect built man eve beautiful the most beautiful woman i can see her now she woke up after the operation from adam and he looked at her her beautiful hair hanging down her back her eyes sparkle with stars above adam touching her by the flesh and said she's flesh in my flesh and bone of my bone beautiful never to fade out those lips those lips they wouldn't have to use this here manic here or what the stuff you put on your face now to make themself look pretty sin caused you to do that god made you perfect hello said your name shall be a woman you came out of me i want you to notice something here now i'm just going to sit on this just a minute still got time i want you to notice the surprise the honor the respect the praise the love the word honor in hebrew is surprising it is the word kavadh which is the word for glory it means to be weighty in one respect that is bearing a burden of a weighty issue glory the word kavadh also means to be important we are to always recognize the importance and this rabbi refers to the word honor it's throughout the bible but it has a it's a deeper meaning than what we think and he refers to the children should honor their father and mother it's one of the commandments and even in that he says we are to always recognize listen to this now we are to always recognize the importance of our parents no matter how good or bad they are they have a connection to us and we recognize they're important to us so when god used honor for honoring parents under our fallen condition that means they won't do everything perfect but we never ever dishonor them even though they've acted imperfect dishonor is never should never be tolerated it should never be justified in the body of christ among preachers in your marriage disrespect and dishonor should never be justified in a christian home speaking words of dishonor speaking words of belittling i've even heard some cussing out their kids and then they go to church i'm sorry it doesn't work that way in the kingdom of god honor should be there always no matter how you feel about their flesh no matter how much they meet irritating you no matter how he's saying this rabbi is saying that that honor your father and mother you may not feel like you love them sometimes because the love has not been in many parents many situations many of you come from and sometimes our own parents you don't feel loved you were abandoned there's a lot of broken situations but you see now god says honor doesn't change you don't have to tolerate if they're abusing you have to tolerate that but you should always retain so if that's true in the word honor then we have this coming from adam to the first time he sees his wife such surprise such honor and even honor weighty glory even in that i it it it has a deeper word like you're in all and i believe adam was in awe and it expressed there's something about when you have an awe about something and you you look at something that you honor and respect and this is important and this is supreme they see it in your eyes i think eve seen it in adam's eyes the surprise the honor the respect you are bone in my bone you're flesh to my flesh you're part of me there's nev there's no disrespect there there's no dishonor there this should be happening in the kingdom of god another word one writer said it's just and if you go deeper it's just you're standing at all it's like surprises it takes your breath away i think eve took adam's breath away and he brings this down to a when we first meet people a lot of times or we meet somebody that we think is important and they walk in the room and you don't you didn't realize they're going to walk in wow brother bob it's you he walks in the room brother bob it's you i can't believe you're in my presence i can't believe you're here this is awesome no yeah i'm talking to you this this is this is amazing just to be around you one of the words for honor goes back to that it says you're standing on problem is a lot of times when we meet people the first time that's the way we act but when we get to know him all the all is gone it's kind of like that woman at the airport it's terrible to show you know i'm not a dog lover but i have all these stories she comes to the airport she gets off the plane i watch her outside by the car her husband picks her up and the dog's in the car and the dog's there and she can't wait to get to that dog not her husband that dog that's in the car and her husband comes around and grabs her luggage and she goes hello george and grabs that dog and punchy boogie hello george yeah stick it in the car and this dog's getting all the honor and i said we're living in a crazy world i guarantee you if that man got that kind of response from his wife he'd be a different man never mind the dog oh george george i miss you so much you're the greatest man in the face i love you i love you i'm telling you that would do something to a man you know we gotta get all these self-helps and all these other things but if a woman responds to a man correctly you're gonna change that man and it's simply called honor and respect and if you don't have godly honor and respect and this all to your children that they see that they you're happy to have them around that the wife sees he's happy to have me in his life that the husband sees she's happy that i'm around that i've made it home from work if this could continue not just when we first meet them but if this could be something in our homes and families then a lot of times when you have honor respect let me say to you young people if you don't have honor if you're going to be physical with that girl or that guy you do not honor that girl or that guy there's no honor there and you need to repent of dishonor if you don't have honor and you don't have respect and you don't have the lord you don't have any basis for a marriage amen brother paul tell it like it is praise the lord so it's this initial meeting of adam that has such honor and it continues no matter what the flesh is remember the rabbi it's continuing he says this honor is continuing in a state of high esteem and all it's continuing in this state of honoring somebody now it gets hard when somebody does you wrong somebody that has really done you dastardly wrong it gets hard when some people have treated you or said bad words to you wrong words to you a husband has treated you wrong a wife that's treated you wrong children that have rebelled against you this the test comes now but we must always remain in a high esteem of respect see people don't think that you can't honor and respect and still disagree you can disagree with the direction a child is going but we never have a right to dishonor them or disrespect them we're trying to help our relationships trying to help our relationships i hope you're listening so no longer under one vessel the glory of god is in adam because the glory of god is still in adam he could never see her any other way than one he seen she was flesh but he looked at them as if there's still one flesh there is no disrespect here there's no dishonoring there's no in your face yelling in her face there's none of that that all came from the fallen brother i'll tell you you go back and read the scripture i read a couple weeks ago she is heirs together of the life of god and if you dishonor her if you do not treat her right god will not hear your prayers i quoting the bible so don't think this is just a new testament old testament thing this is the new testament as well it was the fall it was the fall that brought disrespect dishonor blaming one another it was the pride of the fall that brought in the possibility of a divorce brought in adultery can you say man brought in disrespect brought in abuse it was the fall that brought all that in can you say amen it was the hardness of heart that wasn't in adam and eve before but now there's hardness of heart and jesus said some of the divorces happen just because of the hardness of your heart they're trying to blame everybody else and a lot of times in divorce you're blaming one another and you have legitimate things to say but jesus said when hearts become hard that's why moses had to give you a writing of divorcement we never had that until after the fall but we're a people that by the power of the blood of the lamb and the power of the resurrected christ are being restored back to oneness with god with one another in relationships can you say man and don't you worry about that stubborn husband or that stubborn wife or that or that stubborn child don't you dwell on that you hold your heart by faith and say lord let me grow and honor and respect the best way that i can don't be abused you don't have to tolerate all this abuse and everything but just keep the honor keep the respect and keep praying for that individual who needs a new birth can you say amen that god would show them you keep praying can you say amen because god will honor your honor i should have got a bigger amen than that do you believe that god will honor you and respect you in difficult situations if you'll offer honor and respect don't be abused but you hold that esteem there continually and let god do the work is this helping anybody this morning there's no disrespect there it's only honor it was the fall that caused men and women disrespect honor prejudice it was the fall that brought prejudice it's the fall that brought racism can you say amen it was the fall that brought a woman is a lesser class human being than a man i know she was the weaker vessel and after the fall she had to be put under the man's headship but god did it to protect her she was she was a vessel that could be vulnerable to the enemy come on inviso admit it and it was when she was alone with the serpent without her husband there then she'd become reasoning with the serpent and everything began to unravel can you say amen so so i understand that but i'm telling you after calvary we have the revelation she is the weaker vessel but by spirit she is one with the husband that's why when sarah lied to elohim god could not kill her because she was under the lordship and the headship of her husband so much god could not kill her because he'd have to kill abraham and he wasn't going to kill his son abraham she was protected because of her honor of her husband she made a mistake she was wrong for what she did she was wrong for several things she manipulated the hagar brought her in there trying to make the promise come to pass she did several things that she shouldn't do but god's grace was over her because there's something in there she come under her husband's headship so after the fall he had to put her there for a protection a lot of people would say even this message she's a lesser individual and you know she's you know and god put her in her place and well but the place he gave her was a place of protection you're reading it wrong can you say that she shall be saved in childbearing and and all these things there's there was a place for her because why god does not break the unity of the man and woman like he don't break the unity of the bride of christ in christ it can't be broken what god has joined together no man can put asunder so god puts a protection in place for the woman and her vulnerability but don't forget in spirit brother she's one she's not a weaker vessel in spirit matter of fact some women they'll grow in faith sometimes before their husband does he still needs a new birth and doing stuff and the woman's growing in faith and then he comes later happens sometimes so by spirit those are different we make differences in flesh but by spirit she should be treated as one one rabbi said the bone of my bone flesh of my flesh he said this phase this phrase excuse me bonobo my bone flesh my flesh this phrase is a sign of equality we are one we are connected we are equal we're made in the image of god we are of the same bone and flesh but our bodies are more than just a bag of bones we are made by god and that's pretty amazing we are connected to each other by bone and flesh and for those who have cemented a relationship with yahweh we are bound together by god's spirit his breath that rabbi says his breath god's spirit we are one we're not some separate entity as a christian we are one and have the same spirit as him oh i can hear the second adam say the first adam says woman we're one flesh you're born of my bone flesh in my flesh he sings the song i can hear the second adam speak through his prophet paul and say in ephesians 5 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forward that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself why because you see yourself is not two entities but you see yourself as one for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones now he says he says for this cause shall a man leave his father shall join his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church the second adam spoke about his wife he spoke again i can hear the second adam speak through his prophet of the last days and say the words i no longer call you church i call you bride i can hear the second adam speak to his prophet of the last days in the message uniting time and sign when he says everything's uniting communism's uniting the world council is uniting the churches will unite because it's a uniting sign israel is uniting but he says the greatest thing is the church the bride is uniting with christ can you say amen this is the day of union that we know we're one with him that's why he preaches invisible union of the bride of jesus christ and christ why is he bringing those themes it's our second adam telling us again there's an invisible union taking place uh you're not a separate entity you're not a christian that's just a with a religion trying to follow the lord no no no no you're one in spirit with me that's why i can say amen to this bible and this message because i'm one in spirit with the husband the author that wrote it can you say amen when you know the author i met the man who wrote the book used to be a song i met him i met the man who wrote the book and so i read it naturally and while reading it i learned that it was written just for me the bible is the greatest book it's words i highly treasure the bible is the greatest book since i met the author it's about relationship friends and when you meet the author you don't have trouble with his book when you meet the author you don't have trouble with his prophets uniting together there's an invisible union there's a movement within our ranks even that's the traits of the has the traits of denomination in it i need this respectfully but i'm going to be honest there are movements in pockets in this message movement that has the traits of denomination in it more than what we realize it's because people only label a sign on the door denomination but they don't understand it's a spirit and on some of our pockets there's an organizational denominational spirit that is creeped in this message will never denominate i know the core of it will never done you can't denominate god but just like all the history men can take the message break it up do all this stuff to it make a religion out of it make a code of ethics out of it make this a men do that can you say that and we have a denominational spirit in our midst sometimes and people don't pick up on it but i want to proclaim with all of my heart this message in this word is never about religion it's about relationship it's about relationship it's to restore relationship with our god that we can walk in the cool of the evening and have fellowship unhindered with him again and it also is to restore relationships in your marriages and your families if it doesn't it doesn't have enough power to it i believe it has enough power to do it keep believing can you say amen he only sees christ i've got to find a place to end here my conclusion is adam could not look at eve any other way except as being part of him just like god can't look at you any other way he can't see you any other way except part of him that's why he protects you that's how he's watched over you your ups and downs and in and out and backslid for years and he but he can't look at you any other way than his daughter or his son i said at the beginning are you glad doesn't god doesn't look at you according to the flesh i'm so glad he doesn't look at you that way he says you're bone of my bone you're flesh in my flesh you're a spirit of my spirit your life of my life and so here's my other text as i close today it was in i forget where it was at second corinthians 5 as paul picks it up towards the end and i'm going to read it in the amplified you guys can put it up in the king james but i'm going to read this in the amplified for the love of christ controls us and compels us how many want the love of christ controlling you and compelling you because we have concluded this that one died for all therefore all died and he died for all so that all those who live would no longer live for themselves but for him who died and was raised for their sake and here's the conclusion so from now on so from now on we regard no one from a human standpoint from now on how many would raise i said god help me i need help in this because god views it this way from now on we regard no one from a human point of view and that's according to worldly standards and values we've been taught the worldly standards how to view somebody how to judge somebody but from now on from henceforth no we no man after the flesh can you say amen next sunday i want to get into 10 factors that we're always making distinctions in the flesh we judge on appearance we judge on ability we judge on age we judge on the friends a person has we judge on race we judge on gender we judge on the work and accomplishments we judge on home we judge on the family family origin somebody comes from and we judge on someone's experience all of those things are not what we're supposed to judge somebody on it's all worldly judgment and we we we conclude about somebody based upon all those things because we've been taught to we conclude on all these fleshly we're not supposed to live in the flesh we're supposed to live in the spirit we're supposed to see by the spirit you want to hear a good message it's called discernment of spirit brother bran preached it and i can't believe what he says in there he says don't put down the baptist man don't put down the methodist man if you have discernment a spirit you discern what their motive is and if their motive is right in the kingdom of god don't you dare speak against that well we've got a lot of lack of discernment in the message because we just say if they're in that then there can't be no god there there can't be anything there that's not how brother brahman said discern we discerned by the spirit and brother brahm said something i'm still not done the man didn't say that i said that but brother brahms said he said when god pulls his change out of his pocket there's quarters in there when you pull change out there's quarters in there there's pennies in there there's nickels in there but it all has value you see we're always trying to get a quarter type level or a silver dollar level out of a penny and we're critical of them and we lose sleep over them why can't they do can't they be better well they might be only called to be a penny but i don't have a right to put them out of god's kingdom because they're only going to produce at the level the value that god has given them now i believe god's powerful enough that he can make a penny a quarter but i'm not big enough to do that i'm just the vessel i'm just the preacher to preach the word but i pray people rise higher but i'm it's wrong for me to condemn the pennies can you say man you know he said abraham was a silver dollar lot was a penny he said take a hundred pennies hundred lots to make an abraham now i know that looks like you're billy we're not villaining we're just saying he said in that message discernment of spirit he said don't judge a man by what he's part of or all that you're discerned by his spirit okay if he's not in all the word and he's be careful which direction you go with it you gotta discern where's their heart where's their motive we know if they're all caught up in a denomination and it's not the real thing and it's not the holy ghost we understand yes and so we just pray for that person but we still don't have a right to dishonor there was a statement made here that says they don't have nothing out there and i might have to cut this out but there was a preacher that made a statement here across the pulpit they don't have nothing out there i i don't believe in that it's right for us to say that okay i want to be careful which direction that goes and i know the brother meant it right but but i don't find that kind of expression coming from the prophet blast the systems of denominations blast preach the holy ghost to your people blast the jezebels can you say amen correct the jezebels who keep brother bram says a woman that puts a lot of makeup on shows she's empty inside these are truths that we hold this is exactly right and i'm going to preach them but personally we don't have a right to judge where a person's heart is at and brother madam's attitude you read it all the way to 65 he's going into places and preaching at places and he knows they're they're rejecting and heading out the door and leaving this word but his pulpit manner is praising what god has done in their lives you talk about honor one of the things that most affected me is when i watched after amy simple mcpherson angelus temple she's the head of it and the preacher of it and amy simple fearsome was a great healing evangelist a woman preacher and after she was gone this this has affected me and you go ahead and label me what you want to but this affected me he goes and he's asked to preach at her church and he spends 5 or 10 minutes honoring what god did in this woman's life and i'm going what she's wrong she's dead wrong and anybody who has the authority to correct it right there he has the authority to create right in her own church bless god you know why i got that attitude because i learned it from several preachers this doesn't represent some of the preachers that i've heard who would have went in and blasted the whole thing to kingdom come but he's praising her for five minutes said i went down and visited the grave and took my hat off and prayed and i thank god for her life you see it's not just the mysteries that i learned studying the message all these years it's the character of christ and the honor let's stand together an honor and respect is to be maintained from christians no matter what situation another person is in no matter how they would be treating you honor and respect is never to stop praise the lord you love him this morning lay your hands on somebody let's prank them as the musicians are coming let's pray for one another heavenly father you're our blessed lord who went ahead and taught us all these things you came and lived for 33 years on this earth and lord i find you you the pharisees to be judgmental but i find you to be never compromising on truth but yet honoring and respecting and discerning the core of the problem the woman at the well the woman taken in adultery and you didn't quickly act like the pharisees but you were looking deeper into her heart to see where her heart was at lord may we become that way give us the discernment of the spirit of god and somehow lord we're able to maintain honor and respect and watch our words even when we know somebody is in rebellion or backslid we know that lord our discernment tells us that but somehow we can maintain the love and the honor and the spirit of christ without compromising what we believe we want to find that lord i'm praying for the relationships in the church our church in particular lord and i pray for others that hear this that that's wonderful but lord i pray you improve and bring more of the glory of the lord in the marriages in the families in the single young people that are serving the lord singularly in the in the divorced in the the single moms the single dads i'm praying for them lord that they would learn and be taught of you how to become into better relationships and i'm praying you'll restore in the name of jesus christ that you'll restore you're the god can do things that are impossible lord and i just pray you'll do it give us more of your victory in divine love change us lord and as paul said from henceforth judge we know man after the flesh oh god help us to look with deeper eyes and not judge one another after the worldly judgment but after the discernment of the spirit and the glory of god help us father we love you we love one another may there be results and fruit come from your presence here among us this morning change us lord change each one those that we have our hands on praying for lift them up encourage them strengthen them give them confidence in the holy ghost if there be anyone that has not just responded to you and cut through that unbelief to give their heart to the lord oh break down their walls and barriers lord love them right out of it lord until they come forward and someone needs the baptism of the holy ghost the conversion the new birth oh jesus fill them with yourself i pray may they cry out to you like jacob i'm not going to leave until i receive of your spirit bless each one lord we give ourselves holy to you for this word that's been preached today we give ourselves to it in the name of jesus christ amen what's the song kenny bind us together lord bind us
