[2:34] then in the month of july brother rap
[2:36] asked me to announce there's no adult
[2:39] sunday school classes for the month of
[2:40] july
[2:41] they'll start up the first sunday in
[2:43] august
[2:44] amen praise the lord proverbs chapter
[2:48] 18.
[2:50] and verse 19.
[2:54] a brother offended is harder to be won
[2:57] than a strong city
[3:01] so i just asked you how many has lived
[3:03] that out how many knows that's true
[3:06] how many has offended a brother
[3:11] thank you a few people honest people
[3:13] here
[3:15] a brother offended is harder to be one
[3:17] than a strong city
[3:19] and their contentions are like the bars
[3:21] of a castle
[3:22] a man's belly shall be satisfied with
[3:25] the fruit of his mouth so now we're
[3:27] talking about
[3:28] where the offense usually comes from and
[3:30] that's what comes out of our mouth
[3:32] or what comes out of someone else's
[3:33] mouth we have offenses that come many
[3:36] times a man's belly shall be satisfied
[3:38] with the fruit of his mouth and with the
[3:41] increase of his lips
[3:42] shall he be filled and then we have this
[3:44] familiar scripture
[3:46] that says death and life are in the
[3:48] power of the tongue
[3:50] death you notice how powerful this is
[3:53] now and when we have relationships
[3:55] whether with god or with one another
[3:58] offenses may come and we we realize that
[4:02] that the the offenses often come from
[4:05] what is spoken what is said what comes
[4:08] from this tongue
[4:09] and so he he go solomon says death
[4:13] and life are in the power of the tongue
[4:16] and they that love it they that indulge
[4:18] in it they that speak more
[4:20] shall eat the fruit thereof and the
[4:22] fruit thereof you eat from what you say
[4:24] it can be good or bad it could be good
[4:26] fruit it could be bad fruit
[4:28] so we want to continue to talk a little
[4:30] bit this morning about
[4:32] our participation in creation part three
[4:35] our participation and creation but we
[4:38] just want to be just a little bit more
[4:39] practical today than what we've been and
[4:42] speak a little bit about the tongue our
[4:44] participation
[4:45] in creation father we pray lord that
[4:48] this
[4:49] special spirit lord your presence here
[4:51] this morning will continue
[4:53] and now speak to us through your word
[4:56] take each of our lives lord and
[4:58] hide us lord in your presence in your
[5:00] secret place
[5:01] and speak to us intimately this morning
[5:03] and tell us those things that are
[5:05] are needful for our lives tell us what's
[5:07] next in our lives lord
[5:09] and we'll be obedient to follow you we
[5:11] just pray you'll bless
[5:12] every person that's under the sound of
[5:14] our voice streaming or hear
[5:16] we pray lord that you will do something
[5:19] special in our midst
[5:20] lord we appreciate that you stirring the
[5:22] waters here lately
[5:24] it's such a special move of god we pray
[5:26] father that we would get out of the way
[5:28] that you speak those things lord that
[5:30] are needful to the people today
[5:32] it doesn't matter what level a person is
[5:34] at lord you
[5:35] meet us where we're at and you draw us
[5:38] higher and we pray that you'll do that
[5:40] this morning
[5:40] as we commit ourselves this this next
[5:43] hour or so
[5:44] to the word of god we ask it in jesus
[5:47] name
[5:47] amen amen god bless you shake so many
[5:50] sand as you're
[5:51] seated this morning and god bless you
[5:53] each one
[5:58] i want to lean us today a little bit
[6:01] more
[6:01] towards maybe a daily application of our
[6:05] subject that we've been on
[6:07] our participation in creation you know
[6:09] we've talked about
[6:10] all the things that we're blessed to
[6:12] know in the last days the third poll
[6:14] and the spoken word and the prophet
[6:17] showing us that
[6:18] it's in the thoughts of god and no
[6:20] people has ever known this
[6:22] like the bride does and that is he
[6:23] taught us he says
[6:25] god's thoughts have to be spoken and he
[6:27] says there's still a thought
[6:29] until he speaks them he says it goes
[6:31] from thought of god
[6:32] to a revelation but it doesn't stay
[6:35] there he says it's still a thought
[6:36] until you speak it so you can imagine
[6:39] now how
[6:40] god is bringing us to a level in the
[6:43] last days that we
[6:44] understand what it is god wants to do
[6:47] through us and it's not just god
[6:49] speaking his word through a prophet or
[6:51] through preachers
[6:53] or through pastors that is important and
[6:55] it has its place and has a
[6:57] great important place but lest we should
[7:00] back off and let all the speaking be
[7:02] done by someone else it's every believer
[7:04] that has the holy ghost has to recognize
[7:06] that god can use your lips to speak
[7:09] life in situations if you have the holy
[7:12] ghost
[7:13] you have life in you to speak life to
[7:15] someone else
[7:16] how many believe that this morning and
[7:18] that's one of the blessings of the
[7:20] revealed word for the last days that we
[7:22] understand these things
[7:23] the third poll is not some mystery to us
[7:25] that we understand it comes back to us
[7:27] understanding our position
[7:29] and our place and all these things and
[7:31] we have let me just say this before i go
[7:33] further
[7:34] we have been so blessed in the last days
[7:37] so blessed in the word of god we are
[7:40] such a blessed people
[7:42] to understand and to see the things that
[7:44] we see i say thank god for it
[7:47] i feel unworthy of it but god's blessed
[7:49] me with it
[7:51] praise the lord and he's blessed you
[7:52] with it but we tend to
[7:54] uh separate a lot of these themes many
[7:57] times from
[7:58] uh let me just say this we tend to
[8:00] separate these
[8:01] great themes that we hear that preach to
[8:03] us
[8:04] we tend to separate them from what is
[8:06] happening
[8:07] on a daily basis in our lives matter of
[8:10] fact many times we can leave a service
[8:12] and hear glorious things
[8:13] but we go right back to and we we
[8:16] disconnect
[8:17] what we're hearing that that should
[8:20] apply to our daily lives
[8:22] and incidentally what's coming out of
[8:24] our mouths all the time
[8:25] we tend to disconnect it and we feel
[8:27] good at church
[8:28] i'm a preacher i hate that i hate it in
[8:30] myself i hate it in people
[8:32] that we live in the glories of god at
[8:34] church but we can't seem to
[8:36] apply it to our everyday lives and i
[8:38] believe
[8:39] god has not given us these things just
[8:41] to talk about in church
[8:43] or just to get excited about in church
[8:46] god
[8:46] has given us what we have within us to
[8:49] apply in our lives every day
[8:52] it's the application of the token can
[8:53] you say man that counts and so when i
[8:56] when i labor in these points the last
[8:58] few weeks
[8:59] it's for us to catch something that we
[9:01] can apply beyond
[9:03] what we just enjoy here services you
[9:06] know and i just say this i thought of it
[9:07] last night
[9:08] services that we have are not just pep
[9:11] rallies
[9:11] to work you up and then to let you down
[9:14] this isn't a pep rally
[9:16] convention shouldn't be a pep rally to
[9:19] get people all emotionally excited
[9:21] and then they're let down or to get
[9:23] people emotionally excited about
[9:24] something
[9:25] and then they go back to emptiness
[9:27] that's not what we're gathering together
[9:29] for
[9:29] god is actually depositing things within
[9:31] us that we can take and believe
[9:33] be the believer that we need to be on an
[9:36] everyday basis
[9:39] blessed be his name and so it's not a
[9:41] pap rally it's not an amway convention i
[9:43] don't know when i was a kid i went to
[9:44] amway conventions
[9:45] or multi-level conventions with my dad
[9:48] and they're professionals at pumping you
[9:50] up with the idea that you are a
[9:52] millionaire and that you are a diamond
[9:55] direct
[9:55] and you're a diamond direct material
[9:58] some of you are laughing because you've
[9:59] been to those conventions
[10:01] where they pump you up in the pep rally
[10:04] and they make you feel like i'm a
[10:05] millionaire i'm a diamond direct
[10:07] and then you go back to the reality of
[10:10] life and you realize
[10:11] none of that is true at home it's still
[10:13] the same at home
[10:14] and you feel empty again but you see
[10:17] friends
[10:18] what we preach is not a pep rally this
[10:20] is not something to work you up
[10:22] what we preach is is is the things of
[10:26] substance that god gave you as promises
[10:29] and i'll just tell you i'm not here to
[10:31] tell you you're going to be a
[10:32] millionaire
[10:34] spiritually speaking you already are
[10:36] millionaires
[10:40] can you say man if you've got the holy
[10:42] ghost
[10:43] you're already spiritually rich can you
[10:45] say amen
[10:46] and the father has already signed the
[10:48] check but he's given you the checkbook
[10:50] to write it out for what you need
[10:55] praise the lord and so you won't feel
[10:58] empty again if you take it as your own
[11:00] that god has made you a spiritual
[11:02] millionaire but you see many times we
[11:03] don't apply it at home
[11:05] and the truth in our text and through
[11:08] the bible throughout in in
[11:10] proverbs chapter 18 we realized what
[11:12] happens in our life
[11:14] what happens in life whether death or
[11:16] life or whatever happens
[11:18] what happens alive will come mostly from
[11:21] what we say from our tongue i know this
[11:24] is going to be very practical this
[11:25] morning
[11:25] and i won't get to all of it but i want
[11:27] to get to some of it i want to apologize
[11:29] ahead of time i have my
[11:30] my uncle jim's uh funeral or memorial
[11:33] today
[11:34] up in chelsea michigan so i apologize
[11:36] ahead that we have to
[11:38] we may have to keep this a bit short and
[11:40] there's plenty of preachers here so if i
[11:42] have to go
[11:42] i'll just bring one of you up brother
[11:44] raymond or one of these brothers
[11:46] and you can just take over because i
[11:47] don't want to squelch the spirit but i
[11:49] do apologize ahead that
[11:50] i'll have to get going and so it may be
[11:52] short here this morning
[11:54] but you know what we what happens in
[11:56] life
[11:57] according to proverbs 18 here what
[11:59] happens in life
[12:00] most of it all comes whether bad or good
[12:03] because of the tongue
[12:07] because of what's been said can we agree
[12:12] and uh and so you know the the tongue
[12:15] and and
[12:16] where we speak the central place of
[12:19] whether there's
[12:20] life or death is the tongue it's not
[12:23] really the soul
[12:24] the soul you have to have life in the
[12:25] soul if we're talking spiritually
[12:27] you have to have life in the soul i know
[12:28] god changes the soul but you see the way
[12:31] the prophet taught us is that
[12:32] it's not just that it stays in the soul
[12:34] but that what comes upon your lips
[12:36] in confession whether the positive or
[12:39] negative
[12:40] begins to create in other words creative
[12:42] word
[12:43] happens when it is spoken and the
[12:45] prophet didn't just apply that
[12:47] to the logos in the beginning he didn't
[12:49] just apply it to a prophet speaking
[12:51] a prophet's word has creative power to
[12:53] it he grabs the thought of god
[12:55] he speaks it and whether it's 400 years
[12:57] later or a thousand years later
[12:59] because that word has a creative power
[13:01] in it as soon as the prophet speaks it
[13:03] it's gonna happen it's not if it's when
[13:06] it's gonna take place
[13:08] why because it's not man speaking it
[13:10] anymore it's
[13:11] god's thought can you say amen but it
[13:13] has to be spoken
[13:15] and the prophet brought it down to us
[13:17] even in our confession
[13:18] our positive attitude and in this word
[13:21] that we're holding
[13:22] if we begin to speak it in situations
[13:25] and be
[13:25] faithful to it can you say amen then we
[13:28] watch it do its work
[13:29] there's some believing for healing in
[13:30] our congregation i tell them hold on
[13:33] keep speaking positive keep speaking
[13:35] that i'm healed because why
[13:37] is that we don't look at the time when
[13:38] it happens we just know it's going to
[13:40] happen
[13:42] we believe it's going to happen this is
[13:44] our word it's god's word
[13:46] and so but our tongue is it's crucial
[13:48] and it's it's it's a crucial
[13:50] is that we speak words life or death and
[13:53] our our effect and so i want to teach
[13:55] this this morning
[13:56] how many would raise your and say i want
[13:58] to be a i want to speak life
[14:00] i want to speak life
[14:03] if i have the ability to speak life or
[14:05] to speak death i don't want to speak
[14:07] death
[14:07] to myself or anybody else but you have
[14:10] within you
[14:11] the ability to speak death
[14:16] you can speak death but uh as believers
[14:19] we don't no longer want to speak death
[14:22] we want to speak
[14:23] life it's important that we say i want
[14:27] to
[14:27] be a life-giver i want to speak life to
[14:30] people and situations
[14:31] and so you can speak death all of us
[14:33] have the potential i've said this for
[14:34] years
[14:36] you and your your first birth you have
[14:37] the potential of the
[14:39] of the worst possible things to commit
[14:41] now you may not have done them
[14:42] but you may not have murdered somebody
[14:45] but you have with your first birth
[14:47] you have within you the potentials to
[14:49] murder somebody
[14:51] you have the anger that can become
[14:52] uncontrolled
[14:54] you have all the potential to become the
[14:56] worst drug addict the worst alcoholic
[14:58] the worst adulteress the worst
[15:00] prostitute say well i've never done that
[15:02] those things are the paul praise the
[15:03] lord that you have it but i want to tell
[15:05] you
[15:05] i want to tell our young people the
[15:07] nature that you're born with
[15:08] is capable of the worst things of this
[15:11] world
[15:12] that's how they got there is because the
[15:14] nature wasn't changed
[15:16] and maybe it's been kept in check
[15:17] because you've grown up in church
[15:19] and your parents have directed you the
[15:21] right way praise god for that and it's
[15:23] kept in check
[15:24] but the nature of it you are potentially
[15:26] you have within you
[15:27] all the potential to do the worst things
[15:29] and until
[15:30] god changes that nature on the inside
[15:33] you can go to all the psychology you can
[15:35] go through all the mental practices
[15:37] you can do anything you can drink it off
[15:40] you can smoke it off you can try your
[15:41] best
[15:42] to get your mind towards it but there
[15:44] has to be a change
[15:45] of your nature on the inside and when
[15:48] that happens
[15:49] you no longer desire the things of the
[15:51] world
[15:53] and then when that happens is what i've
[15:56] been preaching on
[15:57] now you have his kingdom within you and
[16:00] now you have the potentials of christ
[16:03] within you which means you're capable
[16:07] of doing the works
[16:10] that jesus did
[16:14] by nature jesus said the works that i do
[16:18] you will do also me you don't know where
[16:21] i came from
[16:22] you don't know what i've done you might
[16:24] have murdered somebody and been in
[16:25] prison but when god changes that nature
[16:28] that person that murders somebody has
[16:30] the potential
[16:31] to speak life to someone else
[16:35] you say well how do i deserve to that
[16:37] you don't deserve it but when the
[16:38] nature's changed
[16:39] you become a son of god not a son of the
[16:41] devil you become a son of god
[16:44] and thus your heart and your soul and
[16:46] your lips
[16:47] begin to manifest and begin to speak and
[16:50] to begin to
[16:51] see the word materialized by the word
[16:54] that you speak i'm confessing
[16:56] this thing is true i'm confessing god's
[16:58] word is true
[16:59] i am a believer i've been changed by the
[17:01] word of god and you begin to speak those
[17:04] things
[17:04] it begins to be articulated and it
[17:07] begins to materialize
[17:09] and things that you can't change by your
[17:12] word
[17:13] they begin to change
[17:19] i'm enjoying this this morning i could
[17:21] close right there and that'd be enough
[17:23] to shout on right there
[17:26] we want to speak words of life in our
[17:30] tongue we can hurt or we can heal
[17:33] we can destroy or we can build
[17:37] by our tongue by the words that are
[17:40] coming out of our mouth
[17:42] we speak words of life and so it it is
[17:45] in our hands
[17:46] what we say think about it now i think i
[17:49] mentioned this the first part of the
[17:50] series
[17:50] our whole life has been affected by
[17:52] words
[17:54] everything that's changed in our life
[17:56] has come because of words our whole life
[17:58] has been affected
[17:58] by something that somebody said whether
[18:01] it was god or god through someone else
[18:04] what was said has changed us we're here
[18:07] today
[18:08] because something came through a vessel
[18:09] of god to draw us to him
[18:11] remember last sunday i said the book of
[18:13] acts the seed came through the body
[18:14] in other words you can't find in the
[18:16] book of acts where somebody got a new
[18:18] birth and the creation of the new
[18:19] creation
[18:20] without some other believer speaking it
[18:22] first the gospel to them
[18:24] for them to get it they didn't get it
[18:25] from an angel paul metadays paul met
[18:27] christ
[18:28] but his in his birth in his holy ghost
[18:32] there had to be a man come to him and
[18:34] share and lay his hands on him
[18:36] for in order for him to receive the new
[18:39] kingdom
[18:39] and that tells us we're part of this new
[18:42] creation
[18:44] if you're created in christ you're
[18:45] created a new creation can you say man
[18:47] but it'll come through something that
[18:49] was said
[18:51] by a vessel in that body that's how
[18:53] powerful it is can you say about
[18:55] and so through this vessel you're here
[18:58] through a vessel of god
[18:59] it drew us to him there was already
[19:01] something within us
[19:03] but something said through a vessel
[19:05] something said
[19:06] the word that was said triggered
[19:09] something within
[19:10] us it brought it out
[19:13] it put water on it whatever you want to
[19:15] call it we were in
[19:17] god as a sun before the foundation of
[19:19] the world and when we're born
[19:21] we're born with that part of us that's
[19:23] laying dormant that's laying dead
[19:25] but somebody has to speak something the
[19:28] gospel to us
[19:29] you come into the presence of god and
[19:31] all of a sudden that which is dormant
[19:32] within you
[19:33] comes to life somebody had to speak it
[19:38] that should be his name and so
[19:42] i mentioned to you you know today i have
[19:44] four wonderful children
[19:46] i have a son-in-law i have a
[19:48] granddaughter
[19:50] i have a a house i have a couple cars
[19:53] i have a couple rental properties i have
[19:58] i'm blessed but i get tired just
[20:00] mentioning all that stuff
[20:02] all these responsibilities but i'm
[20:04] blessed and
[20:06] and there's so many other things i can
[20:07] mention but you know my family
[20:09] all that became i told you a few weeks
[20:11] ago it tells the visitors
[20:12] it because oh i got all of that because
[20:15] i said something one day
[20:17] i said over the phone to my girlfriend i
[20:19] said
[20:20] i like you it was before she was my
[20:23] girlfriend
[20:24] i said i like you and i'm gonna be
[20:26] spending some more time with you
[20:29] that's how it all got started i got four
[20:32] kids
[20:33] a house seven acres of property
[20:37] two that i have to mow once a week
[20:43] and all that came because one day i said
[20:45] i'm interested in you
[20:47] and i'm going to be spending more time
[20:49] with you
[20:51] and then she said
[20:54] the feeling is mutual
[21:01] and you know what i said dicks i said i
[21:03] know
[21:06] she's going where did he get all this
[21:07] confidence
[21:10] but that's where i know it's humorous
[21:12] but that's where all this started
[21:16] if i hadn't said those words on that
[21:18] phone that on the phone i said not face
[21:20] to face on the phone
[21:22] look how powerful those words were
[21:25] and if i hadn't said those words i'd
[21:27] still be over on the east side of toledo
[21:30] at the piccadilly apartments eating mac
[21:32] and cheese
[21:33] for breakfast and lunch and going to big
[21:36] boy for supper
[21:37] every day i'd still be there that'd be
[21:41] it i wouldn't have anything else i
[21:42] wouldn't have these four lovely kids and
[21:44] my
[21:44] lovely granddaughter ellie i wouldn't
[21:46] have it but it all starts somewhere and
[21:48] i'm here to tell you
[21:49] everything good or bad starts with words
[21:55] it starts with something that's sad
[21:58] and so if you if you desire things and
[22:01] this is
[22:01] you know it's true in a human sense but
[22:03] it's even more true as believers as we
[22:05] have the word
[22:06] we're holding the word within us it is
[22:08] so true that we
[22:10] we need to watch what we say that we
[22:12] speak
[22:13] life instead of death and if we're
[22:16] wanting something if we desire something
[22:18] in our heart
[22:18] jesus instructs us to speak to if the
[22:21] motive is right
[22:22] jesus instructs us to speak those things
[22:24] and that's what i did i spoke
[22:26] those things and that's what happened if
[22:27] you want to get things going you start
[22:29] talking about it
[22:30] you want to see something further
[22:31] spiritually in your life you start
[22:33] talking about it
[22:36] you start speaking the word of god can
[22:38] you say man
[22:39] you start saying the desire of your
[22:42] heart can you say amen
[22:44] i hope this is okay this morning now
[22:46] this is the truth for all humans
[22:48] you know human beings without god on a
[22:50] certain level they can speak life or
[22:52] death
[22:52] if we talk you know i've got some people
[22:54] that don't have god don't have the holy
[22:56] ghost
[22:56] but they're they stay positive people
[22:58] and their lives are better because
[22:59] they're just positive people
[23:01] so on a human level this is what it says
[23:04] if we indulge if we speak
[23:06] solomon says we will the we will eat the
[23:09] fruit of what we
[23:10] say bad or good but on a deeper level
[23:13] if the believer has eternal life then he
[23:16] can speak
[23:16] life to another or triggle trigger life
[23:20] that lays dormant can you say man one
[23:22] example of that i've used before and
[23:24] that is mary
[23:25] when she went to visit she's already met
[23:27] with the angel of god
[23:28] that which is conceived in views of the
[23:30] holy ghost she said be it unto me
[23:32] according to thy will we understand
[23:33] she's only about 15 years old
[23:35] so you can imagine the enormous word
[23:37] this was she's hearing things from the
[23:39] angel that no one has ever spoken before
[23:41] or said before
[23:43] besides isaiah behold a virgin shall
[23:45] conceive and so
[23:46] he's told that and she just says the
[23:49] words be it unto me
[23:50] according to thy word and right then
[23:54] the thing was triggered because your
[23:57] response was right can you say
[23:58] it you think you can keep turning down
[24:00] what gospel ministers
[24:02] are preaching and you're going to get by
[24:03] with it no there has to be a response
[24:05] from you
[24:06] if you want eternal life there has to be
[24:08] a response
[24:09] jesus preached eternal life to the rich
[24:11] young ruler but it was looking for the
[24:13] right response
[24:14] he didn't respond right can you say amen
[24:16] you have to respond it's not just
[24:19] given in a way that there you have no
[24:20] interaction with it you have to believe
[24:22] the word of god
[24:23] you have to say be it unto me mary is
[24:26] just this quiet and it says she's shy
[24:28] we got all these things but i want you
[24:30] to notice in scripture
[24:31] if you turn to luke 1 or they can put it
[24:34] up on the board luke 1 there
[24:35] the story is really interesting because
[24:37] and i wasn't going to spend much time on
[24:39] it
[24:39] but i think we should then mary when she
[24:41] receives the word
[24:43] it's not even born yet it's just
[24:45] beginning
[24:46] in her it's just it was a seed by the
[24:49] holy ghost within her
[24:50] it's in its infant stages it's not even
[24:53] a baby yet
[24:54] but notice when mary goes and visits her
[24:57] cousin elizabeth
[24:58] and she comes she walks into the room or
[25:01] into the yard
[25:02] whichever way the movies portray it she
[25:05] comes into the yard
[25:07] and she she just greets she just gives a
[25:10] salutation
[25:12] to elizabeth we don't know all that she
[25:14] said
[25:15] they say that she says his name the holy
[25:17] ghost
[25:18] he spoke to me angel smoking he said i'm
[25:19] gonna have a baby and call his name
[25:21] jesus and and so she just gives a
[25:24] salutation
[25:26] and a baby that was dormant inside of
[25:28] elizabeth
[25:31] was triggered to life it moves she
[25:33] hadn't felt it move in however many
[25:35] months it was
[25:36] now sudden comes to life mary doesn't
[25:38] even have
[25:39] her baby yet she's just holding the word
[25:45] this little shy girl
[25:49] shy something like this happens to her
[25:53] and she's not shy anymore she realized i
[25:56] just gave a salutation here
[25:58] and it made the elizabeth's baby come to
[26:00] life
[26:02] god's doing something god's doing
[26:05] something through me
[26:07] that's why i preach this this word this
[26:09] message what god has given you is not
[26:12] just for yourself it's to speak life to
[26:15] others
[26:18] you can't be in some hole somewhere
[26:21] hiding out
[26:22] with the holy ghost god has put us here
[26:25] to be a light
[26:26] god has put us here to speak what we
[26:28] have even if it's your testimony
[26:31] and it can have power within it and you
[26:33] don't realize what it's doing
[26:35] and mary this shy girl all of a sudden
[26:37] now she's there
[26:38] and and she i don't know if you have
[26:40] luke chapter one open but i just wanted
[26:42] to show
[26:42] i caught this last night all of a sudden
[26:44] now when she says that
[26:46] in verse 45 i think it is oh no verse
[26:50] 39 and all the way down to verse 43 it's
[26:53] uh luke chapter 1
[26:55] verse 43 and whence this is to me that
[26:56] the mother of my lord should come to me
[26:58] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[27:00] salutation sounded in my ears the babe
[27:02] leaped in my womb for joy
[27:04] and blessed is she that believed for
[27:06] there shall be a performance of those
[27:08] things
[27:08] which shall see it's not happened yet
[27:10] but he says you're blessed
[27:12] because you believed and there's going
[27:14] to be a performance
[27:15] the word is going to be formed now can
[27:17] you say man everything that was told her
[27:19] by the lord
[27:20] there's going to be a performance of
[27:21] those things and mary said my soul doth
[27:24] magnify the lord
[27:25] and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my
[27:27] savior for he has regarded the lowest
[27:29] state of his handmaiden
[27:30] for behold from henceforth all
[27:32] generations shall call me blessed
[27:34] for he that is mighty hath done to me
[27:36] great this is mary's song and it's
[27:38] similar to hannah's song
[27:40] who was barren and all of a sudden she
[27:42] realizes
[27:43] god's gonna do this and here's a
[27:45] confirmation i must have something
[27:47] within
[27:48] me because what i said out of my lips
[27:50] gave
[27:51] life to another baby and if what i said
[27:53] gave life to another baby in the womb
[27:56] then this baby is going to come to pass
[27:58] this baby is going to be born
[28:01] and this shy little girl starts writing
[28:04] songs
[28:06] and it just comes out or you know she
[28:07] may not have talked very much before
[28:09] you know she's talking a lot because she
[28:12] realizes i better talk
[28:15] because good things are coming out of
[28:16] what i'm saying even a greeting
[28:19] hello i don't know how she said it hey
[28:21] elizabeth how's it going
[28:23] the lord spoke to me i'm going to have a
[28:25] baby named jesus
[28:28] bang there's power in it
[28:32] can you say man i've been show i've been
[28:35] showing you that
[28:36] sometimes the least little thing that we
[28:38] say
[28:40] can be anointed of the lord to bring
[28:43] life to someone
[28:44] else
[28:48] amen she goes on for he that is mighty
[28:52] verse 49 hath done
[28:54] to me great things that his holy holy is
[28:56] his name and his mercies
[28:58] on them for them to fear him from
[29:00] generation in general
[29:01] he has shown strength with his arm he
[29:03] has scattered the proud and the
[29:04] imaginative from their hearts
[29:06] if he has put down the mighty from their
[29:08] seats and exalted them of low degree
[29:10] he has filled the hungry with good
[29:12] things is this a shy girl anymore no
[29:15] something's happened to this girl
[29:18] something has happened to this girl
[29:20] and she wants to talk and praise god
[29:22] listen there's something about when you
[29:24] find your confidence that what
[29:26] god has placed within you that you're
[29:28] not ashamed to open up and praise god
[29:30] for it he hath
[29:34] holding his servant israel in
[29:35] remembrance of his mercy he spake to our
[29:37] fathers to abraham and two seed forever
[29:38] and mary bowed with her about three
[29:40] months and returned her own house
[29:41] and so boy she really comes out of her
[29:44] she's pretty happy can you say man
[29:45] and hey she should be happy because of
[29:48] what god has just done
[29:50] she should be rejoicing in praising the
[29:52] lord
[29:54] she should be happy you should be happy
[29:57] for what god has done to you and god has
[29:59] provided for you
[30:02] brother brahms says in relation to that
[30:04] white had to be shepherds 1964
[30:07] the quote she went up to the hills of
[30:09] judea to tell elizabeth and when she met
[30:11] elizabeth
[30:12] she told her that she was going to be a
[30:14] mother and she couldn't understand it
[30:16] knowing no man
[30:17] but she said the holy spirit
[30:18] overshadowed me and said that this holy
[30:20] thing
[30:20] that will be born of me will be called
[30:23] the son of god
[30:25] and i'll call his name jesus and the
[30:27] first time that
[30:28] the name jesus was ever spoke in a human
[30:32] lip
[30:33] a little dead baby in its mother's womb
[30:35] leaped for joy
[30:36] and shouted and jumped in the womb of a
[30:38] mother and it never had received life
[30:40] yet
[30:41] the name of jesus christ spoke life into
[30:43] a dead baby
[30:45] what ought it to do in a church that
[30:47] claims
[30:48] to be born again somebody say praise the
[30:50] law
[30:54] first time it was spoken human lips on
[30:56] human lips
[30:57] that's what it did what could it do
[31:00] in the holy ghost filled church
[31:06] notice in our text it uses the word
[31:08] offend
[31:10] back in proverbs it says a brother
[31:12] offended it uses the word offense i want
[31:14] to talk about offending
[31:16] we'll talk about the the bad side of
[31:18] what we speak first a little bit and
[31:19] then
[31:20] quickly get to the good side again
[31:23] because
[31:23] we can say things even as a christian
[31:26] that can hurt that can destroy
[31:28] that can offend it's a shame when it
[31:31] happens and jesus actually speaks of it
[31:33] in matthew 18. we're going to go there
[31:35] in a minute but
[31:38] when jesus speaks of it
[31:41] he's very straightforward about someone
[31:44] offending someone else especially one of
[31:45] his children
[31:47] and so this word offend we're gonna just
[31:49] talk about it because it is a sin
[31:51] to offend one another
[31:55] i'm prepared for people to get real
[31:57] quiet right now
[32:00] it is a sin to offend
[32:04] someone else it's a sin to cast a
[32:07] stumbling block in front of somebody
[32:09] else
[32:10] how much on the internet today is
[32:12] stumbling people over the message
[32:16] there's going to be a responsibility
[32:18] paid
[32:19] can you say man either repentance has to
[32:21] take place because god takes very
[32:23] seriously
[32:24] someone who misrepresents the thing and
[32:26] someone who causes
[32:27] many souls to stumble and doubt and fear
[32:30] can you say amen
[32:31] it happens every day it happens 24 7.
[32:33] but god does not like it whether it
[32:35] comes to someone else or comes through
[32:37] us
[32:37] it's a sin to offend one another
[32:39] including our own family members and so
[32:42] we can all be preached to this morning
[32:43] can all learn a lesson
[32:45] what comes out of our mouths towards one
[32:48] another
[32:48] matters to god can i get a greater amen
[32:52] what comes out of our mouth in our homes
[32:55] in our places
[32:56] in our in our employment wherever it is
[32:58] what comes out of these mouths now the
[33:00] rest of the world
[33:01] they have given themselves permission to
[33:03] say anything they want
[33:05] at any time from cussing all the way to
[33:08] putting down someone else
[33:09] all the way to gossip they give
[33:11] themselves permission because there's no
[33:13] holy ghost check there it still grieves
[33:15] god
[33:16] but when a son and daughter of god get
[33:18] in the flesh
[33:19] and give themself permission to spill
[33:21] out things out of their tongue
[33:23] god is very concerned about it
[33:26] and especially to offend someone else we
[33:29] want to get out of the mode
[33:31] of offending and discouraging someone
[33:34] else
[33:34] because we want to be a life-giver
[33:40] if you turn to matthew 18 if you offend
[33:42] someone and hurt them
[33:44] no matter who it is god cannot bless
[33:47] your life
[33:48] matthew 18 says this about he uses
[33:51] little children as an example
[33:53] i'm being practical today and you can
[33:55] just um
[33:56] take the what the lord has for us if you
[34:00] would matthew 18 verse 3
[34:01] 3 says verily i say to you except you be
[34:04] converted and behold
[34:07] and become as little children you shall
[34:09] not enter into the kingdom of heaven
[34:11] now it's not just about children he's
[34:13] talking about when you're converted
[34:14] you need to be converted and become as
[34:17] little children
[34:18] you shall not enter into the kingdom of
[34:19] god whosoever therefore shall humble
[34:21] himself
[34:22] as this little child the same as the
[34:24] greatest in the kingdom of heaven
[34:26] and whosoever shall receive one such
[34:28] little child in my name
[34:29] receiveth me but whoso shall offend one
[34:32] of these little ones
[34:34] which believe in me so we're not talking
[34:36] about children just
[34:37] children here we're talking about any
[34:39] age
[34:41] of somebody who believes on the lord and
[34:43] you cast a stumbling block before them
[34:46] that's a serious matter to god
[34:49] your word said the wrong thing to
[34:51] discourage them
[34:53] whosoever shall offend one of these
[34:54] little ones which believe in me
[34:57] if it it were better for him that a
[34:59] millstone were hanged about his neck
[35:01] and that he were drowned in the depth of
[35:03] the sea
[35:04] woe unto the world because of the
[35:06] offenses for it must needs be
[35:08] that offenses come but woe to that man
[35:12] by whom the offense cometh you see what
[35:15] he's saying now
[35:16] we live in a world there's going to be
[35:18] offenses and god says woe to all of it
[35:20] he doesn't like any of it can you say
[35:22] man
[35:23] but he says it's worse when somebody
[35:25] even especially somebody is supposed to
[35:27] be representing him
[35:29] woe to that to the person that the
[35:31] offense comes through
[35:34] that is a very serious thing woe
[35:37] to the person that the offense comes
[35:39] through and how did it come through them
[35:41] they spoke
[35:41] something that wasn't right they spoke
[35:45] something that was an offense now just
[35:47] so so so from these scriptures we learn
[35:50] you can't hurt a child of god without
[35:53] hurting god
[35:57] you can't offend a child of god without
[36:00] offending god
[36:02] there's not many many amens on that but
[36:04] if you go over to james
[36:06] and he talks about the tongue i'll go
[36:08] there in a minute just because you were
[36:09] quiet i'm going to james james tackles
[36:12] the tongue
[36:14] james puts the tongue in its place and
[36:17] james you know his type of ministry
[36:19] james was
[36:20] he said let me see if you got the goods
[36:22] a christian
[36:24] james is from missouri he's from the
[36:25] show me state
[36:28] show me what you got let me see it in
[36:30] your life let me see
[36:31] the things you say so we'll go there in
[36:33] a minute but you can't hurt a child of
[36:35] god without hurting him you can't offend
[36:36] the child of god without
[36:37] offending him it offends him and the
[36:39] word offend here
[36:40] in the greek means scandaliso scandaliso
[36:44] sounds like scandal to offend to make to
[36:46] offend it sounds like
[36:48] a scandal something is said and you know
[36:51] whenever a scandal happens
[36:53] it it discourages a lot of people it
[36:55] offends a lot of people
[36:56] take the worst of scandal of a minister
[36:58] who falls in sin and commits adultery so
[37:01] or he falls by money or popularity or
[37:03] women or something like that the three
[37:04] things ministers can fall by
[37:06] money popularity or women and so he has
[37:09] all these influence of people underneath
[37:10] him
[37:11] and people looking to him and trust him
[37:13] you see and so
[37:15] all of a sudden now there's some scandal
[37:16] in his life that offends a lot of people
[37:19] it hurts a lot of souls it is it's
[37:23] destructive can you say man
[37:25] so you wonder this scandaliso means a
[37:28] finn means scandaliso means to make
[37:30] offend to a finn
[37:32] to put a stumbling block or an
[37:33] impediment in the way upon which another
[37:35] may trip
[37:36] and fall and that's the that's the
[37:38] metaphor that's the way it looks is that
[37:40] somebody has stuck a big stone in the
[37:42] way of a person that they can't walk
[37:43] freely
[37:44] and they stumble and they fall down
[37:46] that's what a person does to discourage
[37:48] from going on with the lord they
[37:51] believed they innocently believed they
[37:53] gave their heart
[37:54] and now somebody is either by their
[37:56] words or sometimes by their actions as
[37:59] living a life
[38:00] and the prophet taught us that he says
[38:02] sometimes it's not the bootleg
[38:04] joints or the bars that's so destructive
[38:06] it's someone like elvis presley who
[38:08] claims to be a christian
[38:09] and he's singing in the bars and singing
[38:11] in the nightclubs and then he's in the
[38:13] church the next day
[38:14] he said that will send more souls to
[38:16] hell than all the bars in the country
[38:19] why because people have to look and say
[38:22] i thought he was a christian
[38:24] and here he's acting like the world and
[38:26] singing like the world
[38:27] and gyrating his body like the world and
[38:30] he's still a christian
[38:31] that's a stumbling block to people when
[38:34] people are hungry for something real
[38:36] they don't want to see the world in a
[38:37] life they want to see sanctification
[38:39] they want to see something that's real
[38:41] they want to see this has done something
[38:43] and it's changed my life forever
[38:46] i'm no longer i no longer sing the music
[38:49] of the world i no longer do the things
[38:51] of the world
[38:51] i've been changed that's what people
[38:54] that are hungry for god want to see
[38:57] but when you have a mix it becomes a
[38:59] stumbling block to people
[39:01] i thought this oh i wish i had another
[39:03] hour
[39:04] to talk about the stumbling blocks that
[39:06] have been said
[39:07] by people that have left the message and
[39:10] the stumbling blocks
[39:11] and the calls that i get of discouraged
[39:14] believers
[39:14] and discouraged christians it grieves my
[39:18] heart
[39:19] somebody is going to answer someday a
[39:21] judgment for it
[39:25] god have mercy on the ones who have
[39:27] spoken those words
[39:28] to misdirect souls and i believe god
[39:32] will have mercy on settlement before
[39:33] this over
[39:34] i'm praying for every one of them to see
[39:36] the light and
[39:37] repent of it but if they don't there's
[39:39] going to be a reckoning someday
[39:41] you know who i feel for i just shared
[39:42] with brother kyle the other night i feel
[39:44] for the sheep because i'm a pastor
[39:46] i feel for the sheep a man can go off
[39:48] and do all kinds of things
[39:49] and he'll have to answer to god for it
[39:51] but i care for the sheep
[39:52] i care for the young people that's been
[39:55] offended
[39:56] and and they're discouraged and their
[39:58] their disillusion
[39:59] what's happening in the message
[40:03] but i'm here to stand as a gospel
[40:04] minister i stand for this truth with all
[40:07] my heart
[40:08] not only because it's a movement because
[40:10] it's real in my heart
[40:12] the holy ghost that brother ma'am talked
[40:14] about the christ
[40:16] is living in me i love him
[40:19] and i would never have any other life
[40:22] but serving the lord
[40:23] under this message i love it you know
[40:26] you all know around here you know how
[40:28] much i love it
[40:29] i have more fun than a human being
[40:30] should be allowed to have
[40:33] and it's not just fun it's joy
[40:37] oh let me be a witness for this message
[40:40] this morning
[40:40] this message is not religion it's not
[40:43] some man's idea
[40:44] [Applause]
[40:46] god in his grace sent us this to bring
[40:48] us
[40:49] into a relationship with jesus christ
[40:51] that we've never seen before
[40:54] it's given a secret place a hiding place
[40:56] like sister hannah said this morning
[40:58] it's given this secret place with the
[41:00] lord this relationship with him
[41:02] we would have never known it this way
[41:04] through a denominational
[41:06] idea i
[41:09] i love him this morning i love him
[41:12] because he first loved me
[41:15] i love this message and
[41:18] no doubt in some points in my life i've
[41:20] been
[41:22] offensive sometimes i don't know you can
[41:25] ask my children i'm sure in some place
[41:27] i've made some mistakes
[41:28] said the wrong things but i bring it to
[41:30] the lord
[41:32] and my goal is i want to be a life
[41:35] speaker
[41:36] i want to speak life can you say that
[41:39] amen
[41:40] i want the best of what this message
[41:42] gives us
[41:43] and i want to preach it like i've never
[41:44] preached it before
[41:46] and those that offend
[41:49] we're praying that god will let them see
[41:52] can you say amen
[41:55] so for the discouraged souls that are
[41:57] out there listening so many
[41:58] that listen god bless you thank you for
[42:01] for listening
[42:02] in but i want to tell you listen don't
[42:04] listen
[42:05] to any other voice except the voice of
[42:08] jesus christ
[42:10] the voice of truth
[42:13] shut all the other voices out all the
[42:15] other things that caused confusion
[42:18] because i can tell you god didn't send
[42:20] this message to bring confusion to
[42:22] people
[42:23] it's satan that has caused the confusion
[42:26] it's satan that has interpreted things
[42:27] and caused confusion
[42:29] you're a young 16 year old you're a
[42:30] young 14 year old you've watched a lot
[42:32] of stuff go on
[42:33] but i'm here to tell you that you bet if
[42:35] you get your eyes on jesus christ and
[42:37] him alone
[42:38] he'll restore your hope
[42:41] he'll restore your love for him
[42:45] he will put you in your position as a
[42:47] believer and you don't
[42:48] you get to where i i i i don't i'm like
[42:51] brother diggs
[42:52] i don't have any identity crisis i know
[42:55] who i
[42:55] am i'm a son of god i'm not still trying
[42:59] to find myself
[43:02] i have no identity crisis i'm a believer
[43:05] in christ and the message of christ of
[43:07] the last days
[43:08] i'm glad to be i'm proud to be not proud
[43:11] in a wrong way
[43:12] but i'm proud to be i stand with it
[43:16] because i think it's leading us
[43:17] somewhere
[43:20] i got to have a guide i got to have a
[43:22] leader the lord jesus got to lead me i
[43:25] can't get myself out of this mess
[43:26] i can't get myself in a rapture i need a
[43:29] leader
[43:31] and you can have a personal relationship
[43:33] with jesus
[43:34] christ himself
[43:37] until it's like like uh jesus said to
[43:40] peter that
[43:42] one day he was worried about where
[43:44] people were going to go he said
[43:46] where will this one end up and where's
[43:47] this one kind of going and he's all
[43:49] confused about
[43:50] where where will this disciple go
[43:51] where's this one and jesus said listen
[43:53] just forget about that what is that to
[43:55] thee
[43:58] quit thinking about that just follow me
[44:01] follow me young people just follow him
[44:06] and all the confusion fades away
[44:09] praise the lord well let's give the lord
[44:12] a hand give me a break here let's give
[44:13] the lord a hand
[44:21] i'm your brother i'm your brother in
[44:22] christ this morning i i only seek to
[44:24] tell you the truth
[44:27] amen
[44:30] and i have a lot more energy than what
[44:34] i've had in recent days because i've
[44:35] been i've been biking
[44:37] this week six miles a day zach
[44:42] i know that's not a lot but it's
[44:46] it's good i know you're thinking how far
[44:51] did you bike
[44:53] i don't know um
[44:56] i know that there was joggers passing me
[45:02] i don't know that whether that's a good
[45:04] thing or not
[45:05] and some of those bikes just some of the
[45:09] bikes
[45:10] just what passed me so fast i think
[45:13] there's got to be a speed limit i don't
[45:15] know how they were going that fast
[45:18] i'm sure there's a speed limit for
[45:20] bikers
[45:22] or they had a they had one of those
[45:24] engines on it i know they did because
[45:25] there's no way they could go that fast
[45:27] cheaters
[45:31] i like i do it the old way with my legs
[45:32] and they got those machines on there
[45:35] i'm an honest christian
[45:41] to offend somebody and it goes on to say
[45:43] that in the meeting it goes deeper to in
[45:46] to entice to sin we could preach on that
[45:50] you're influencing somebody else to go
[45:52] do something that's against the word of
[45:53] god
[45:56] you're posting like on the internet to
[45:58] somebody to mislead them they're doing
[45:59] things wrong and you're liking it
[46:06] what are you doing that for you're
[46:07] misleading them you should be the person
[46:10] that unlikes it and if you don't unlike
[46:11] it
[46:12] just don't say nothing don't promote it
[46:14] it's wrong
[46:18] to cause a person to begin to distrust
[46:20] or desert
[46:21] one whom he ought to trust and obey
[46:24] to cause to fall away to be offended in
[46:26] one in essence
[46:28] to see in another what i disapprove of
[46:30] and what hinders me from acknowledging
[46:32] his authority
[46:33] to cause one to judge unfavorably or
[46:36] unjustly of another
[46:37] since one who stumbles or whose foot
[46:39] gets entangled
[46:40] feels annoyed to cause one displeasure
[46:43] at a thing
[46:44] to make indignant to be displeased so
[46:47] many things that we could preach out of
[46:48] that
[46:49] from the meaning to offend but all of us
[46:51] have done this and all of the seed that
[46:53] sees this happening every day
[46:54] it offends the lord when a little one is
[46:57] offended whether it's a child
[46:58] or a child in the lord or anyone in the
[47:00] body of christ
[47:01] when we speak words that offend somebody
[47:03] else when we discourage somebody from
[47:06] the word of god
[47:07] when we are you listening when parents
[47:11] make the wrong decisions and take a
[47:14] young heart or take their young hearts
[47:16] or young hearts within the church
[47:17] and discourage them by other priorities
[47:20] that's a wrong thing to do you ought to
[47:22] think about decisions you're making
[47:27] we're supposed to be encouraging the
[47:29] young encouraging them in the lord
[47:33] i've seen parents take all of the
[47:36] sanctification of the word
[47:38] and all of the modesty and all
[47:41] of the holiness and give it the label
[47:45] of legalist
[47:49] i got a sermon coming up because
[47:54] i want to preach on sanctification give
[47:56] it a good name again
[47:58] i want to preach on holiness and give it
[48:00] a good name again i want to preach on
[48:02] modesty and give it a good name again
[48:03] because there's people sometimes even in
[48:05] our own ranks that has taken it all
[48:07] anything and said that's a legalist he's
[48:09] legalism
[48:10] i'm sorry my friend that's not true the
[48:13] devil's made it legalism to you but the
[48:14] worst part is to teach your children
[48:16] until they run away from and they're
[48:18] afraid of anything that resembles
[48:20] holiness
[48:21] sanctification modesty they just quickly
[48:24] because you taught them
[48:25] they label it legalist and i need to
[48:27] stay away from that
[48:30] i'd like to spend some time with you and
[48:32] take the bible and say sanctification
[48:34] is from god he sanctifies our lives
[48:37] holiness is from god and it's a
[48:38] wonderful thing
[48:41] i believe in sanctification how many
[48:42] believe in him still i believe in
[48:44] holiness can you say amen
[48:45] i got young girls in here that still
[48:47] believe in modesty and i thank the god
[48:49] for them
[48:49] i i say god bless you young girls god
[48:52] bless you sisters in this church
[48:53] somebody in this world still believes in
[48:55] modesty and holiness
[48:57] holiness is on the inside but it's on
[48:59] the outside as well god bless you
[49:01] sisters for holding up the standard of
[49:02] holiness
[49:03] [Applause]
[49:06] you're not going to be you're not going
[49:08] to get no hand clap of praise out there
[49:10] in the world you're going to be
[49:10] persecuted
[49:11] but in this church you're going to be
[49:13] praised for it and thanked for it
[49:15] god bless you for making a stand for
[49:16] holiness
[49:19] holiness is not legalism modesty is not
[49:22] legalism
[49:24] sanctification is not legalism god
[49:27] through his blood
[49:28] takes a life and sanctifies them from
[49:30] things of the world
[49:32] the things of the world become strangely
[49:34] dim in the light of his glory and grace
[49:37] you stay in the presence of god and he
[49:39] washes all those worldly habits off of
[49:42] you
[49:42] you stay in his presence and he'll wash
[49:44] that habit of smoking
[49:45] that habit of drinking that habit of
[49:47] pornography
[49:48] stay in the word and receive it he'll
[49:51] sanctify your life
[49:53] and you'll be freer than you've ever
[49:55] felt in your entire life you want to
[49:58] feel free
[49:59] some of you young people want to feel
[50:00] free give me your phone and stay off
[50:02] social media for about a month
[50:04] and even with that you're going to feel
[50:06] more free

[50:11] youtube i challenge you
[50:13] take one month and don't watch any of it
[50:15] it's got those little things that got a
[50:16] little cussing in and that's okay
[50:17] and you justify it and it goes here and
[50:19] goes here there and you did
[50:21] take one month off of it and see how
[50:23] different you feel
[50:24] you're feeding on the wrong things and
[50:26] you can't have a sanctified life
[50:28] god can't wash you properly
[50:31] if you're still feeding on those things
[50:35] blessed be his name
[50:39] so okay go to james and then i'll close
[50:43] i have to leave right out the door now
[50:45] to be on time james
[50:49] told you we're going to james anybody
[50:53] going with me
[50:54] we're traveling to james we can't ignore
[50:56] james he's got it here on the tongue
[50:58] he's the best commentary on the tongue
[51:02] james three
[51:09] uh my brethren be not many masters
[51:11] knowing that we shall receive the
[51:12] greater condemnation for many things we
[51:14] offend all
[51:15] if any man offend not in a word the same
[51:17] as a perfect man
[51:18] and all able also to bridle the whole
[51:20] body oh my goodness
[51:23] if you can bring the tongue out of the
[51:24] holy ghost you can bring everything else
[51:28] show how powerful the tongue is if you
[51:31] say lord
[51:32] bring this tongue under subjection may
[51:34] not utter a word unless it's terrifying
[51:37] help me lord this week to shut my mouth
[51:41] to saying the wrong things you might not
[51:44] say it that way
[51:45] to the lord but just to emphasize the
[51:49] point help me lord
[51:50] to shut my mouth
[51:54] because if if you if a man offend not in
[51:58] word
[51:58] his tongue what he said the same as a
[52:00] perfect man also to brighten his whole
[52:02] body
[52:02] behold we put bits in the horse's mouth
[52:04] that they may obey us
[52:06] and we turn about the whole body their
[52:08] whole body behold also the ships which
[52:10] through
[52:11] though they be so great and are driven
[52:13] of fierce winds
[52:14] yet are they turned about with a very
[52:17] small helm
[52:18] whatsoever the governor listeth even so
[52:22] the tongue
[52:23] is a little member and boasteth great
[52:25] things
[52:26] behold how great a matter a little
[52:29] fireth
[52:30] fire kindleth fire is a destructive
[52:35] thing the smallest fire if it's
[52:38] uncontrolled
[52:38] can destroy your whole house can destroy
[52:43] acres thousands of acres of forest in
[52:45] california even now now we're in a
[52:47] drought again
[52:48] thousands of acres and it just started
[52:50] with a little campfire started with
[52:51] somebody throwing something in there
[52:53] small fire kindle with the great matter
[52:56] and that's the tongue that's the tongue
[53:02] and the tongue is a fire a world of
[53:05] iniquity
[53:06] so is the tongue among our members that
[53:08] it defileth the whole body and setteth
[53:10] on fire the course of nature
[53:11] and is set on fire of hell for every
[53:14] kind of beast and of birds and of
[53:16] serpents and of things in the sea
[53:18] is tamed and have been tamed by mankind
[53:21] but the tongue
[53:22] can no man tame it is an unruly evil
[53:25] full
[53:25] of deadly poison wow
[53:29] and you think i'm a hard preacher
[53:33] that's your tongue it's not talking
[53:34] about somebody that's your tongue has
[53:35] the potential
[53:36] to be a deadly poison amazing
[53:41] there with bless we god this is the part
[53:44] that i'd like to get to
[53:45] they're with bless we god
[53:50] and there with curse we men which are
[53:53] made after the similitude of god
[53:55] here's the paradox the same tongue can
[53:58] bless god
[53:59] and curse other people
[54:03] just like jesus said about the little
[54:06] little children and
[54:07] defending one you can't offend them
[54:08] without offending me
[54:10] you can't bless god
[54:14] and curse men
[54:17] it doesn't work that way you can't be
[54:20] vicious with your tongue
[54:24] horizontally and
[54:27] sing the praises of god and magnify him
[54:30] vertically
[54:34] our vertical relationship and our
[54:35] horizontal relationships
[54:37] must be in harmony
[54:40] with what we believe is that okay with
[54:43] everybody
[54:47] blessing here means to to invoke
[54:51] blessings of course but to celebrate to
[54:53] praise to consecrate a thing with solemn
[54:55] prayers to ask god's blessing on a thing
[54:57] pray him to bless it to one's use
[54:59] pronounce
[55:00] a blessing on it god to cause the pro to
[55:02] cause to prosper
[55:04] to make happy to bestow blessings on
[55:06] favorite of god
[55:07] so this is what comes out of your mouth
[55:08] is that is to bestow up
[55:11] a prosperity or a blessing to bless
[55:13] their their
[55:14] road in front of them we do this to god
[55:17] we bless god we praise god but we don't
[55:19] do it to men that often
[55:20] and what we don't realize is that if
[55:22] we're if we know christ is somebody
[55:25] what we say can pull more of the christ
[55:27] out of somebody
[55:28] how many know that i've preached on
[55:30] before that when
[55:32] paul says about fathers
[55:35] provoke not your children to anger
[55:38] usually it's by your words it can be by
[55:40] your actions but inspire your words
[55:41] provoking is to stir up you say the
[55:44] wrong words to stir up
[55:46] anger in them husbands can
[55:49] say just the right thing to stir up
[55:51] anger in their wives
[55:53] wives can say just especially if you've
[55:55] been married for many many years
[55:57] you know just what to say to get his
[55:59] goat
[56:01] you've learned you've become a
[56:02] professional at it
[56:04] and it's provoking it's stirring it up
[56:08] if you've got mistakes in the past then
[56:10] you use the ammunition of their mistakes
[56:12] in the past when you're real angry
[56:14] you bring up their past mistakes it's
[56:16] under the blood but you brought it up
[56:22] when are we all gonna say lord
[56:25] get my tongue and get my actions in
[56:28] harmony
[56:29] with the holy ghost when am i giving
[56:32] myself the right to bring up somebody's
[56:34] past and use it
[56:36] as ammunition when god doesn't do that
[56:39] against
[56:40] us husbands and wives i encourage you to
[56:44] pray and take this before god
[56:46] and i'm preaching to myself too we
[56:48] better watch our words because that's
[56:50] the one we know the most is our mate
[56:52] and that's the one we can take advantage
[56:53] of too much or we can take for granted
[56:56] of
[56:57] and get loose with our words
[57:01] but fathers can provoke their children
[57:03] anger sometimes by their actions than
[57:04] their
[57:05] mixed up priorities or their words and
[57:07] their
[57:08] there's anger raising up in the kid
[57:09] doesn't boils out every now and then
[57:11] sometimes it could just be hidden i'm
[57:13] angry because i'm looking for dad and
[57:15] mom to give me
[57:16] some leadership in the holy ghost
[57:27] so are we to bless another person i
[57:30] i'm going to have to find a place to end
[57:32] here but where are we to bless
[57:34] we're to bless god james says we don't
[57:36] bless god and curse men
[57:38] are we to bless uh one another
[57:42] yeah we say god bless you well how can
[57:45] we say god bless you and then gossip
[57:47] against the person in that week
[57:50] blessing is not just saying god bless
[57:52] you god bless you god bless you god
[57:53] bless you
[57:55] we mean it when we watch what we say
[57:57] about that other person
[57:58] about that pastor we really mean it
[58:02] because we're blessing them and
[58:03] obviously from this praising another
[58:04] human being is right it's our position
[58:06] and duty as a christian to praise
[58:08] another human being and we always back
[58:10] off because we don't want to you know
[58:12] you know we want them to get the big big
[58:14] head but what we're blessing is that
[58:15] christ within them
[58:16] we live in a world of lives today that
[58:19] are live without proper praise
[58:22] to have balanced kids they say you must
[58:25] have nine praises
[58:28] to balance out the one correction i'll
[58:31] tell you when i my kids were younger
[58:32] they can tell you i failed at that i
[58:35] failed at that because i
[58:37] i am so good at finding what's wrong
[58:40] i'm a professional at it but i'm not as
[58:43] good at finding what's right
[58:46] parents you have to find what's right
[58:49] every once while you have the other side
[58:50] of it they only praise their kids and
[58:52] never correct them
[58:52] right and you can tell how they act
[58:55] that's right
[58:57] you know you got to correct your kids
[58:59] you got to have the rod you got to do
[59:01] all that can you say amen
[59:03] but nine praises to every one correction
[59:05] wow that's you know my
[59:07] how imbalanced are some of us
[59:10] it's right and ever so powerful to
[59:12] praise and to bless others can you say
[59:14] amen
[59:14] i have a bunch of other scriptures here
[59:16] i'm going to skip them but i think it's
[59:18] really mostly lacking between husbands
[59:19] and wives and parents and children
[59:21] low self-esteem in women was rated as
[59:24] the top thing
[59:25] and the cause for their depression is
[59:27] low self-esteem in women
[59:31] i should say that we should be the ones
[59:33] brothers and the body of christ that
[59:35] should break this cycle
[59:37] that's in the women to bring honor back
[59:40] to bring dignity back to our women
[59:44] and proverbs 31 says that the woman that
[59:47] fears the lord
[59:48] shall be praised it is okay to praise
[59:51] another human being
[59:55] can you say amen this is this is the
[59:57] truth brothers and sisters can you say
[59:59] amen
[59:59] and so i'm trying to i'm looking through
[1:00:01] my notes finding a place to end we'll
[1:00:02] pick it up next sunday again
[1:00:04] but sometimes we need to watch what we
[1:00:06] say that we can't bless
[1:00:08] god oh praise the lord and through the
[1:00:11] week we're cursing other men and we're
[1:00:13] we're not blessing other men we can't do
[1:00:15] that god says that's
[1:00:16] james says here through the lord james
[1:00:19] says
[1:00:20] we therefore bless we god even father
[1:00:22] and therefore he curses amen which is
[1:00:23] made at the similar gratitude of god
[1:00:25] out of the same mouth proceed the
[1:00:26] blessing and cursing my brethren these
[1:00:28] things ought not to be so
[1:00:29] doth a fountain send forth at the same
[1:00:31] place sweet water and bitter
[1:00:33] can the fig tree my brother and bear
[1:00:35] olive berries and either a vine or figs
[1:00:37] so
[1:00:38] can no fountain both yield salt water
[1:00:40] and fresh
[1:00:42] who is the wise man endued with
[1:00:43] knowledge among you
[1:00:45] let him show out of a good conversation
[1:00:48] his works with meekness of wisdom
[1:00:52] and he goes on and on and on lord
[1:00:56] help us to know when to shut our mouths
[1:01:03] sometimes we need to shut our mouths
[1:01:04] over an issue because we're fighting for
[1:01:06] the issue
[1:01:07] and we might discourage somebody over
[1:01:09] the issue
[1:01:11] we should be more interested in souls
[1:01:13] than we are winning in arguments
[1:01:15] we should be more interested in winning
[1:01:16] souls than winning arguments
[1:01:20] or to help us to know when to shut our
[1:01:22] mouths i want to be a vessel that's
[1:01:24] participating in creation
[1:01:28] to speak life can you say amen
[1:01:32] and about shutting our mouth i'll end on
[1:01:33] this about shutting our mouth there was
[1:01:35] a man honored
[1:01:37] to be a great linguist
[1:01:40] they paid tribute to him that he not
[1:01:42] only learned
[1:01:43] seven languages and seven languages well
[1:01:49] but they gave him praise because he
[1:01:51] learned not only
[1:01:52] seven languages well but learned when to
[1:01:55] be silent
[1:01:56] in all seven
[1:02:04] we give ourselves permission to say a
[1:02:06] lot of things
[1:02:08] but we need to take that and say lord
[1:02:11] you be the lord
[1:02:12] of my tongue
[1:02:16] i'm here to be an edifier and that means
[1:02:17] to build up not to tear down
[1:02:20] there's enough stuff in this world to
[1:02:21] tear people down
[1:02:23] there's enough stuff in this world to
[1:02:24] tear our young people down
[1:02:26] let me be an edifier and correction is
[1:02:29] edifying if it's done right
[1:02:31] we have to have correction it edifies
[1:02:34] too if it's done right
[1:02:35] if it's received right so we're not
[1:02:38] eliminating correction
[1:02:39] but we say what comes out of this mouth
[1:02:41] let it be led of you
[1:02:43] let it be of god
[1:02:46] let it be a blessing and not a curse let
[1:02:49] it glorify you and they
[1:02:50] may it build up other people and if
[1:02:52] there's christ in somebody
[1:02:55] let it pull out that christ part
[1:02:59] and paul says provoke your children
[1:03:00] anger it means you're pulling out their
[1:03:02] anger instead of the good things out of
[1:03:03] them
[1:03:04] let us speak words that stir up all the
[1:03:06] good that's within somebody else
[1:03:09] pulls the christ the best the potentials
[1:03:13] how many know brother abraham says
[1:03:14] this bride has the potentials of him
[1:03:16] within her
[1:03:17] she has his potentials within her
[1:03:21] who pulls those potentials out of their
[1:03:24] bride members
[1:03:25] speaking by the holy ghost
[1:03:28] we pull it out of one another i hope i
[1:03:31] gave you something to live by this week
[1:03:34] it's a challenge for all of us but
[1:03:36] there's a god
[1:03:37] if he said it then he must have gave us
[1:03:40] a way through the holy ghost to live it
[1:03:43] we'll yield ourselves to him we can do
[1:03:45] it
[1:03:47] hallelujah you love him this morning
[1:03:52] let's stand together
