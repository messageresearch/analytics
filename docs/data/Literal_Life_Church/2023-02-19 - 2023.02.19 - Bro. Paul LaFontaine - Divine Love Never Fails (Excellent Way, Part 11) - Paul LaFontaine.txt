TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Corinthians chapter 13 and we'll continue with some scriptures here First Corinthians 13. and verse 8 through 10. First Corinthians 13 8 through 10. amen if we're under expectation when we come to church to let God do whatever he wants to do instead of the mindset it'll just be church as normal if we hinder greater expectations say God you come and do what you want to do then we'll give it time and we won't be thinking about what we have to do at home and our bills do tomorrow and our businesses and and what we have to plan for this week I noticed some even you know in church still on their phones and so if you can't give God enough time just to minister to you undistracted completely undistracted then you really need to pray about that because something's take a hold of you that's more important than the word of God amen so let's let the Lord do what he wants to do in our lives let's be free to just be open to that First Corinthians 13 and verse 8 charity Divine love never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether they be knowledge it shall vanish away so Paul here and this is where my subject is from in First Corinthians 8 and the first three words there charity never faileth prophecies they'll fail tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish Away Paul here is actually bringing an eternal the Eternal part of what divine love is that if it never fails then it's Eternal it's always been there it'll always be there there are some temporal things in the church like prophecies and like tongues that in the meaning of this means that they will fade away someday they will fade away prophecies will cease prophecies will fail knowledge shall vanish away so there are things even in the church that will vanish and fade away someday there are things that we won't need someday so there are things that will fade away but then there are things that are Eternal and things that will never fail and will never fade away and divine love is one of those things it will never ever fade away it'll never fail you it'll never fail because we know God can't fail God can't fail and so Paul's bringing in this eternal part that it can't fail other things will fail they'll vanish away but charity never faileth verse 9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so it shows what we're seeking for what we're looking after is not just to emphasize something that's temporal but to have our eyes not just towards something that surface or temporal but to have our eyes on the Unseen and that which is eternal right there was another scripture here I wrote down I don't have it in my notes but I wrote it down on a piece of paper if you would go with me to Second Corinthians chapter four I want to add a scripture in in relation to the Eternal and how we're to live looking at the Eternal second Corinthians 4 I believe it is and it says here second Corinthians 4 verse 16. yes for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perished yet the inward man is renewed day by day so this is a cycle that's happening that our outward man is perishing but our inward man is being renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment I I think it's interesting how Paul takes our life in the trials of it and all the suffering and calls it a light affliction wow I want to look at my life like that our light Affliction in other words our life with all of its pain with all of its suffering with all the hurts and all the things people did wrong to us he's calling it when when you're looking at in light of Eternity it's just a light affliction but isn't it amazing how big we make our afflictions and we make it bigger than God sometimes Paul says but our light Affliction is but for a moment it's working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen they're temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so he's encouraging a Christian that that we cannot live with our eyes always on the temporal things I remember brother Steve Johnson used to be assistant with me here and passed away a cancer but I remember him saying one time in a service he says is it going to matter 10 years from now you're making this thing such a huge thing and it's a temple thing but how much is it going to matter to you in 10 years from now and that's the way we look at not just here and years how those are things that we look at in life and all the things that were done wrong how does it look like in light of Eternity we're not supposed to have our eyes consumed and our lives consumed with the temporal things that's happening but we're having to look towards the Unseen for the things that are that are here that we see they're temporal but the things that are unseen that's eternal father bless your word today as I seek to yield to you and I asked you Lord you do whatever you want to do in this service today may I yield to you so that your Holy Spirit can come and baptize us again Lord and fill us again we commit the service to you in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated and out of all the dimensions the many dimensions and vastness that we have covered about Divine love this one here today is not to be overlooked I want to take a look at it I want to title this Divine Love Never Fails this part of divine love should not be overlooked we have appreciated all the different dimensions of looking at Divine love and its characteristics but this one is not to be overlooked and I felt to Finish First Corinthians 13 and to finish the scriptures and what and ask what is the rest of First Corinthians 13 saying what does the rest of it say and this window that we've been calling it a window into the more excellent way he says there's a more excellent way than he gives the characteristics of that way it's divine love it's God's love it's it's it's agape love and then he explores in this little window in between this Corinthians which is a book of Correction the Corinthians is you could call it a book of Correction because Paul basically is setting things in order in the church that got out of order and so in the midst of all this correction and correcting the gifts and all these other things and saying you know he has this excellent way just sandwiched right in the middle and it's a window to the more excellent way to show us what it is this chapter stands separate to itself and it is looking at when a Christian breaks beyond the surface of feeling or temporal manifestations even of the spirit or temporal surges of Faith or Temple surges of Hope to bring the Christian beyond the surface to adapt to a depth of stability and Power how many this mornings do I want to raise my hand is that I want to grow to more stability and Power in my life and not stay a surface Christian this is what Paul's trying to do there's a more excellent way there's manifestations of the spirit there's prophecies there's giving to the poor there's a there's an understanding all the Mysteries he takes all of that but he says that's all these things are all temporal if you get knowledge of something it's all temporal but there's something Eternal in here and there's something beyond the surface of living every day by surface feeling let me just say that right away Christians cannot live by sight they must live by faith and Christians cannot live off of their feelings Christians cannot live by their feelings you cannot judge your day and judge your Christian walk and judge your fellowship with God based upon how you feel because from one day to the next you will feel very different one day you'll feel good one day you'll feel saved the next day you won't feel saved and those days when you don't feel saved Satan likes those days and he capitalizes it and he's in your ear on your shoulder saying that's right not only do you not feel saved I wonder if you're even saved at all boy he's a quite an enemy isn't he so hey we can't live off of our feelings we can't live with our feelings as the dominant king that's setting in our heart that's dictating our life every day that this is how I feel this is how and a lot of times people will conclude on matters conclude a lifelong confusion conclusion based upon their feelings of what happened based upon lack of facts and based upon will I feel this way so it must be true we can't do that we can't live on feelings we have to live deeper than that and this is a realm into which we are coming to live in a way that perfect Faith which worketh by perfect love Masters every circumstance it says Deeper Life of stability and Power in the Christian's Life by the Holy Ghost it's a realm of mastering every circumstance that comes our way so this characteristics of Love Never Love Never failing this characteristic should not be overlooked that love never fails Paul's saying we enjoy faith we enjoy prophecies and I want to just get this across it doesn't mean that we eliminate what he's saying here with that it'll it'll fail prophecies will fail these things will cease knowledge will fade away it doesn't mean we those things stop happening as a manifestation of the spirit but what it means is they will fade away they are tempro I didn't intend to say this but I I years ago the Lord showed me that there are things are you listening there are things that God gave us in the Bible as as as rules and guidelines and protections and boundaries that we will not need when we get on the other side can you say Amen and when you start breaking down teaching what T we teach about young people and the boundaries and not touching one another before marriage and all these other things these this is all in the scripture and it's what God gave us to live in this life of sexual temptation of our flesh taking over he gives us the Holy Ghost but he gives us guidelines from the Old Testament to the new and we can't dump those things out we need them for this life you can't mock or ignore the preachers that are preaching God's guidelines for sexual temptation I wouldn't make an enemy of the pastor who's correcting your young people and giving them guidelines from the scripture to live by that's not your enemy that's your friend I'd be careful of setting their minds against that that that's the problem the church is the problem the preacher is the problem not the preacher that's bringing out the boundaries of how we live in this age but we used to say with that there's some things in here he gave us for this life and we honor that but we won't need it for the other life we won't need the scriptures for sexual Temptation in the other because there won't be any demons there there won't be any lust there can you say Amen there won't be any of that there it'll be gone there won't be death no devil there there won't be any accuser of the Brethren there won't be no sickness can you say Amen Hallelujah we won't need the scriptures to apply Faith to Divine Healing to believe God can heal the sick we won't need those scriptures anymore because we'll never get sick but do we need them now yes do we need the gifts of the Spirit now yes the gifts in the church keep the church clean I'm one of those gifts hello I'm one of the gifts that God gave you to help keep your life clean you didn't know I was that but I'm introducing myself to you God bless you good to meet you I'm not just the fat preacher that's in there every Sunday up in the pulpit in front of you but God has given me a gift he gave some to the church for the perfecting of the church for the work of the ministry for the edifying and building up of the body I'm not here to hurt your family I'm here to help your family don't make me the enemy to your children don't make me the the problem in your life don't make the message the problem you know I've been so in my vacation I did rest but I've been so grieved in my spirit just so incredibly grieved and I don't have all the answers but I'm I'm astounded at how the devil not people but the devil can take the very precious thing that God sent us through a prophet the very message of the last days and turn people and say the message is my problem and the men that are preaching that's really my problem in life what a lie of the enemy how tactful can the enemy be to take something so precious to our lives and turn it around to a cult and that's my problem and that's what that's my family's problems let me tell your brother and sister that's not your problem the problem is rebellion in our hearts they're not recognized that God has blessed us with the greatest message that's ever hit planet Earth and this church believes it all of it the church that you attend believes that God sent this from heaven in the last days you say well I'm here and I don't understand what you're saying there are there are literally hundreds of scriptures that talk about the last days but there's some specific ones who talk about a restorative Ministry to bring us back to Bible Faith to bring us back to Restoration of the church to bring us back to biblical truth it's over and over again in the scripture you need to know those scriptures because we don't have a church that's preaching something from 100 years ago preaching the message of the last days my my my encouragement to you in love don't make the message the pro your problem praise the Lord so Paul says we enjoy faith we enjoy prophecies we enjoy knowledge especially when it's from the Lord but it will only have a season to it it will fade it will have a temporal help for you you know how many know that you can be prayed for and completely healed by the atonement but you're going to get sick again sometimes so your healing sometimes is temporal now sometimes somebody's healed that's it they're prayed for they don't have that problem again they don't have that eye problem again it's over can you say Amen but but if we live in these bodies we're going to get sick with something else again so our healing can be temporal and and so because of that we it's a season it will fade it has a temple help for us but you see we can't put all of our eggs in one basket we can't live solely upon knowledge why it'll fade someday we can't rest our Eternal destination on temporal things they will fade they will have certain limitations to it and to the Corinthians you can't Paul says you can't put an emphasis on these things too much because they are temporal in other words you can't have all your eggs in one basket you can't take a prophecy or you can't take knowledge and put all your eggs in one basket and say that's it that is my that I arrest my eternal destination upon the knowledge that I have you can't do that because it's temporal it will fade away amen but perfect love never fades never fails it's constant it never walks away God's perfect love for you will never ever walk away when you fail when you fail his love will not fail how many raise your hands that I failed before but his love don't fail you it's going to keep trying it's going to keep loving you it's going to keep drawing you and there'll always be something if you're a daughter of God or Son of God there's always something down there you got all this stuff on the outside all the guilt and the shame that goes with it all the things you've done wrong that's all the stuff but down here if something's churning that's because God's still dealing with you and that means his love never fails I don't care what you've done his lover never fails it never gives up turn around it's constant it never walks away why it was because his love is not wavering by emotions by Feelings by Life Changes by people his love doesn't change with people because people change his love doesn't is not wavered and moved and changed by emotions or feelings or the stock market or losing a job or gaining a job or his love does not fail during those times his love is constant it's always there your job will fail life will fail husbands and wives will fail and make mistakes but his love never fails can I get an amen this morning and that's a lot of the reason why you're still coming because I know your lives and many of you been through some pretty rough circumstances why are you still here well you could say it's I'm supposed to be here I'll get preached on if I'm not here but if it's a desire and hunger of God you're here because his love never fails you fail and people fail and preachers fail but his love never fails maybe that's why you're here this morning and maybe that's why it should work off a hunger if people are hungry for more of God look at the Asbury Revival in the last 11 days when kids begin to hunger after God I'm tired of church I'm tired of formality I'm tired of no Spirit I'm tired something's craving and hungering for it and they begin to just stay and then at the end of the chapel service they just say we're not going anywhere I just I'm hungry for God and so now for 11 days they're in the same Chapel just praying for one another now listen listen I always like to see where something goes because you see a lot of those things are temporal they only last so long but praise God that there's a hunger in young people for more of God praise God that they say I don't have to go back to the class I'm going to stay right here till I get something I'm going to stay at this altar until I get something and when people are that hungry God has to respond and pour out his spirit because he promised he that hungers and thirst after righteousness shall be filled God's going to keep his promise he's not going to fail people that say I want more I'm tired of religion I'm tired of starching this I'm tired with a with a church with no Spirit I'm hungry for something and I don't even know what it is but I'm hungry for more of God and when you begin to hunger and come to church that way God has to respond you go ahead and read up on it it's happened several places around around the world and that's interesting people will get a ticket from Australia and New Zealand they hear something's going on they're going to fly there they're not going to let them in the chapel they have to stay outside because they won't they don't want anything out interrupting videos being taken all this stuff inside it they don't want to be interrupted but they'll come from around there because why they're hungry I want to come but don't forget it's not a location and in the Welsh Revival in England when that broke out people flew all the way from the United States and one guy came up to a policeman who was swinging his baton thing there as swinging a stick and they said he was whistling A Hymn to God and he says sir can you we come here all the way from the states for the Welsh Revival will can you tell us where it's at he said what are you talking about I am the Welsh Revival I'm right here foreign be to God it's not a location it's not an Asbury right now when you begin to seek God when you begin to get hungry for God when you come to church a different way not fill in your time clock and checking in clicks okay and when I'm in about an hour hour and a half preaching see people start looking at their watches their phones I got stuff to do I got this plan this afternoon where do you have to go excuse me for being in your face where do you have to go that's so important today what you need is an altar in your heart to say God I don't have enough hunger for you I have too much hunger for that I need more of a hunger for you and I'm serious about this I'm willing to to stay I'm willing to too much carnality there's too much starch it is this message is just a intellectual do's and don'ts to people just too much of it in families and lives and people are fearful and scared of it what we need is a Revival in our hearts you need to release yourself [Applause] years never seen you at the altar never seen you repent of any never seen you move by the services something's wrong with your heart there Comes A Time here to say I lay aside what I've heard before there comes a try and say God that this is it I just need more of you I need it to make it in a Rapture I need the Holy Ghost but tongues and and prophecies they'll have certain limitations but perfect love never fades it never fails it's constant it's not moved by feelings or the stock market or insurance policies or sickness life is that seasons change good and bad in the last year I've seen Veterans of the faith men some of them I was close to my heroes they die they pass away and they go on to their reward brother Gideon retief died of a heart attack just 52 years old just a few days ago on his way to church bang heart attack he's gone the church has doesn't have a pastor right now George Martin in South Africa passed away the last few days Harold hildebrat last year the one that was birthed under his ministry things end lives fade away even good lives loved ones will die even good things in life will pass away but his love is still here aren't you glad God takes people from us but he doesn't take himself from us his love is still here it'll never fail you people leave us people hurt us but his love stays with us oh I pray you can let your heart be softened this morning Paul's teaching the Corinthians who need they need correction they were sensationally driven they were feeling driven putting all things on sensation or prophecies or emotion you know the Corinthians had great services they had great Services Spirit-filled pouring out of the spirit tongues interpretation of tongues praise be to God from Pentecost those things would happen and even happened to have them happen today but you see now the Corinthians put their emphasis all on that and Paul could recognize it they didn't see it but Paul could see you're putting way too much emphasis on this and if you put it on it feels good it visibly feels like more signs are here and more things are happening it feels better it's a confirmation that God is with us the problem with that is when that is over when that feeling is gone how many can raise your hand and say I have felt the presence of the Lord anybody says no you can't feel it no yeah you can you might be feeling it today that that you feel don't be afraid of that don't be afraid of that it's him coming near us you never you can be afraid of a lot of things but you need don't need to be afraid of what you feel in your heart in the presence of the Lord and so now it's a confirmation God Is With Us problem is is that when it's over we start to wonder and this happens many times in revivals God dealt with that brother Rapp a few weeks ago he said that they had a prayer meeting the spirit of the Lord came in that basement Maya was just tremendous just a unique moving of the spirit and then the next prayer meeting that got together have the same man pray do the same things because they won't want to wanting to repeat what happened the Friday night before you can't do that it was it was good praise the Lord but what what's God want to do now what's God want to do in this service the problem is when it's all over sometimes uh people start to wonder well we didn't have a service like that so is God With Us Now what a terrible thing to say all things from God are good but some things are temporary can you say man and that feeling that I felt and I feel it this morning I love it but I can tell you that feeling isn't always there but there is something that's always there that I can't get away from it's the unfailing love of God that has never failed me never left me so I didn't feel the presence of God with you may not feel the presence of God but you have no scripture to say he left you his love can't leave you it can't fail you it can't stop it can't end now friends shouldn't we be interested in something in a world that's failed Us in people who have failed us even preachers have failed us isn't it isn't it time for us to latch onto with all of our hearts something that will never will fail us never will his love will never fail [Applause] it'll still be there no matter what we go through no matter what people have done no matter what our trials his love is constant it's still there it's still drawing your heart never gives up never fails never will fade away always will be there Hallelujah I've got some wonderful memories of feeling the presence of God in my life being on spiritual highs like never dreamed of I've got some wonderful memories of camp meetings sometimes in our own Services I'll tell you there's been times even our own Services I felt like shouting running the house and sometimes I ran the aisles but you see now I don't judge how close I am to the Lord by how fast I ran the aisles okay because I may have felt good I felt blessings I felt Liberty but when I get in my car for some reason when I get in my car the devil's in my car and I thought my dancing and shouting in running the aisles it was the end of the devil it wasn't the end of the devil he's there he's on my shoulder he's whispering in my ear he's distracting me to all the you know I'm gonna I'm called the devil you come out of me with service you'll be thinking of things of God and rejoicing and all of a sudden he's got you thinking about your business what you got to do Monday what you got to do Tuesday you better do this and all of a sudden pressure starts to come in a matter of 10 minutes the all the glory that you felt is without the window of the car was it really that important [Music] but it's temporary I've learned it in these great mountains what I've learned in my Christians experience if it's a blessing to you today to know this is those I've learned this journey isn't always a mountain this journey has valleys this journey has valleys and now we're learning sister Hannah to say hallelujah from the valley God loves to hear Hallelujah from the valley when I was a young Christian I was not saying hallelujah from the valley I don't know what I was saying but it wasn't that that's what God wants to hear it's easy to shout hallelujah from the mountains it's easy to shout when you're at church it's easy to shout hallelujah at camp meeting Frozen but it's in the valley he wants to hear the Praises of God glory be to God praise our God in the middle of a valley amen I learned that there's not just mountains in this journey there's valleys but one of the greatest things I've learned is there's a constant in my life there's a constant I might have mountains I might have valleys but there's something always constant there's something always consistent the God on the mountain is still God in the valley and when I crash I just fall back on him one Minister said here when you fall if you're going to fall you may fall but when you fall fall back on him when I crashed I fall back on him and his love has never failed it's never changed something really strong keeps holding me something keeps holding me something stronger than myself something stronger than my good feelings at meetings or the bad feelings during The Valleys something stronger than what people feel about me something stronger is in my life there's a constant in my life and it's the love of God Divine Love Never Fails we've seen people with their ups and downs and watching other people ups and downs and ins and outs and sometimes they say Lord you know I've labored for their lives I've prayed for their lives and just still that roll their coaster up and down and up and down I say oh God if that's in my own life take it out but let let me cling to the constant that's in my life let me cling to the consistency that's in my life something stronger than myself yeah I can't live on the ups and downs of people's spiritual walk one week you're an angel Can't Get Enough compliments one week you're an angel the next week they turn against you you're almost the devil I can't live on that so when I come from all those mixture of emotions I have a constant it's the love of God when I come from my own inconsistencies and I have to apologize and God forgive me you know that's the thing is that the devil takes failures we're not we got to look at this from an eternal's perspective because of an eternal perspective your failures don't make you a failure what is it well wake up and smell the coffee because you failed does it make you a failure not in God's Kingdom not in an eternal perspective can you say Amen and I'm sure a few of us this morning have failed just raise your hand just a few of us are right but because you failed doesn't make you a failure not in God's eyes but that's where the devil likes to take it he likes to take it and your inconsistencies and other people's inconsistencies dominate your Christian walk and dominate your life for Untold years we've got to stop that today we've got to stop that and we've got to look at something that's constant in our life we may be inconsistent other people may be inconsistent but there's something that's never inconsistent it's always there it always will be there fathers fail us mothers fail us siblings fail us cousins fail us uncles fail us churches fail us but please get my message this morning there's one thing that will never fail you and that's the love of God in your life [Applause] because I have a constant in my life you know why people get addicted do you realize we're in the addiction generation right this is the addiction generation we've had some of that in other Generations but not like this one because we have so many medicines to address the addictions and they would there's why but why do people get addicted they they like the surge of the adrenaline or uh uh the dopamine surges what do they call it in the mind and that's what is it again dopamine they they get used to things that mechanically do that now it's not just medicines that can do that it is video games it it is porn pornography drugs can you say man too much television so now you know I'm watching on my plane and uh I can't you know everybody's got their own screen it's like I started going that's really what Americans need on a two hour three hour flight they just come from saturated TV their whole life and on their phones that's all they do and that's really what they need in front of them on their two-hour trip everybody gets their own it's their own headphones and I I usually can't find anything to watch hardly at all if I can find something decent then I might watch it but I was looking I was saying God you know look look at this generation look at us look at us this is an absolute Escape obsession this is an addiction no wonder you can't get through when you're preaching to people the hearts are just so saturated with Sensational television and Books and Music and that surges these levels of the brain this pleasure Center and too much they say too much of it is actually a damage to the brain that's what we'll deal with in the sexual temptation as well because this is science it's been proven for years too much of this happening is damaging to the brain video games now I know I've had some young men through the years that have dumped out what I've preached and even when they've been convicted of the Holy Spirit to go home and get rid of those games that are wrong they've been convicted and they walk away and rebel against that that but you see now their lives will show what it is it's it's an it becomes an addiction and you'll see their lives come you say Where's that come from it says because it's because it's from the video games and it's for come parents that allow wrong video games and that's there's fruits that come from that and science has proved it we're too scared to put our foot down and say we're not going to do this so they they're rushed with this and and you wonder if people live for great surges of emotion sometimes because the same thing happens when you're emotionally driven in a service and people get great surges of faith and but you see and they have they have to have it then and that's addiction is that they have to have it in other words how can I take the right medicine that I can have this Rush all the time how can I have enough uh Monster drinks is that what they are I need energy I need energy now I'm not preaching against Monster drinks just check your heart though before you take a lot of that stuff I didn't expect to say any of this today any but I'm going with it because I'm not going to stand by and ignore us being consumed by being like them out there in this addicted generation we're not here to be television veggies on the couch feeding on this stuff all the time on our phone we're not called to that well it doesn't affect me I'm different I'm different you are well what are you celestro are you a superhuman being are you different than us how are you different than me how are you different than when the word calls on it and calls these things how are you different than when television was preached and and the warnings of it preached through a prophet and you say yes that is applied to this whole television generation we need to take those warnings except me it don't apply to me when I called to sit and become addicted to all this stuff you say well I'm not addicted I'm not a dick that's what most addicted people say they don't even know they're addicted is that right yes that's right but the thing is is that I like that feeling so I've got to find whatever it is that I can keep that high all the time that's why we have just down the street we have marijuana places and places we can go for stuff because how can I live on this all the time so that's our generation is that how can I live on the highs all the time the mountains all the time but you see the brain prevents these damage because we're not meant to live in reality on that all the time we're supposed to know how to live when we come out of those highs and that's goes right to a service that camp meeting where you feel a surge of the Holy Ghost and you come and meet a devil on Tuesday young person you realize you're going to need something more solid than an emotion to deal with that devil of Temptation on Tuesday when you get home from Camp you're going to need something deeper than an emotion but so but we're going to sign up for all the camps because I'm going to live off of that you're not going to live off of that it's temporal it's temporal but his love is eternal his love is always there and so please brother Paul please find the end of your sermon please it's not consistent emotional you'll find very emotionally fragile families and people who live off of highs even spiritual highs they're really emotionally fragile most days they're living on an edge just just like a like a string they're not strong emotionally and I think we not only need to be strong in our souls but we need to be strong emotionally it doesn't mean every day you'll be but you need to find an anchor that you're not up and down and your emotions all the time emotionally fragile families will have a bunch of characteristics that eventually come out to show they're not addressing their emotional fragileness in their family the kids are on edge sometimes mom and dad are on edge because we're living in a generation of emotionally fragile people so they're turned into drugs they're turning to things they're turned to TV they're turning to their friends series who's recorded years ago but you know they just live on that friends thing because why it makes me laugh that friends series that uh that series just makes me laugh and I've got to go get me a laugh because I'm feeling the pressure I'm feeling emotionally fragile here can I get an amen from somebody yeah yeah you want me to name some more series that people are watching and you got it on your phone it's a consistent thing you're watching it I'm preaching to all of us what are you using it for is it a replacement for what you're really longing for now some of you are saying we should send this guy on vacation more often and some of you say no let's let him stay home I wonder if people live for these great surges of emotions and then they have it but because they're emotionally fragile people it's not consistent they have not settled into this love that never fails yet this revelation of his love that never fails yet and this love says you don't always need a rush to feel God's approval it's this addicted Nation who have rejected the love of God that makes them addicted to other things they have rejected this constant love of God and Holy Ghost that's what makes them addicts they become addicted to everything else because because they've rejected this constant Holy Ghost love that they can come to and find peace living in the times we live in however how are your list you should be to me and I addressed this to my wonderful audience that's listening in the broadcast I address it to all of us here and also those listening uh maybe it's time in the times we're living in that you should be listening to what I'm laying down this morning what I'm preaching you should be interested in something that would never fail you why because we are in the generation of failed hopes everything has failed us the corporate world has failed us unions have failed us governments have failed us family members have failed us marriages have failed us parents have failed us come on now friends why because they're human they're not God church people have failed us it's an atmosphere everywhere of everything failing us can you say Amen so that we have lost hope we've become cynical we've become sarcastic we've lost any trust we're under accursed of failed hopes promises broken over and over and over again it's a generation of failed hopes everything has failed us the world is falling apart we have no trust in governments we have no trust in presidents we have no trust in our political leaders we have no trust in commercials that are selling something to us didn't brother Bradham have that where he said I've seen on a commercial on the TV that this new detergent that you didn't have to wash the dishes you just sprayed it on this commercial said that you just sprayed it on and it cleaned it himself you didn't have to wash them here he says I'm going to buy it right now and I'm going to be a hero to my wife and he made a little statement there he says he said anything I can help I hate doing dishes and I said praise the Lord I hate him too because he said his mom he's a little boy and his mom would put him up on a footstool and make him wash dishes it sounds like my mom dishes Sharon can you say Amen dishes to galore we did so many I thank God the day the dishwasher came out and then I got four more kids that I had four more dishwashers combination of that I haven't had to do too many dishes Mom and Dad Mom all due respect mom and dad would have this family over the metered family and they had 10 kids and we would use having them for dinner no we didn't have money to go out in those days so Mom and Dad's having them for dinner because they needed help and things that there haven't we had it over again we had them all for dinner and used every dish in that house every dish and guess who had to stand there and wash every dish before they had time to go out and play I don't need counseling for this or anything my mom and I talked about it I'm over it don't sound like I'm over it but I'm over it she's shaking her head because she's when I get home when I take her out Tuesday we go out to dinner me and mom she's going to tell me that's not the full story son she's shaking her head right now but we did have 10 kids in the meter family came over and we had to do dishes I remember that I don't remember a lot of things but I remember doing a lot of dishes and and and these kids are all watching us do the dishes when can you go out and play with us well we can't until we get all your stinking dishes that you ate off of brother Brown says as a little boy he had to get up on that stool in front of this thing dude so he says I'm going to be the hero I'm going to buy this stuff got it brought it home honey you go sit in the living room I'm taking care of the dishes tonight poured that stuff on and there was egg all over it poured it on put it in there stuck it in that water brought it out there was just as much aegon it is before he says I don't believe the commercials anymore and then he gets into those statements he says people given promises they can't keep commercials products he said then you find one commercial here and another commercial here of a different company and find out later they're owned by the same company and they're criticizing the other product then they're owned by the same company all deception trying to get promises they can't keep and then he goes over into the church and he says that's just like the church world of denominational systems always making Promises to the people that they can't keep Always setting expectations but it never really going anywhere to a true Revival you know what happens it fails people and they get disappointed in the church you listen in they get disappointed in the system not the people but the systems has disappointed way too many people these young people in Asbury I think there's a disappointment there's got to be something more real than what's going on and their hearts begin to say God is there something more real God come and the Holy Spirit just comes and baptizes that place we are living in a generation of failure is this okay with everybody failed hopes so you really should be listening and saying whatever you can preach to me that's something that has never failed and never will fail me I need to latch on to that in my life and that's the love of God that's the Holy Ghost love of God I'm going to latch on to that Eternal thing because it didn't change from the beginning he loved you from the foundation of the world before you were born before you were born he went to Calgary but before you were born he thought of you in his mind before the foundation of the world and you know what his thoughts were love towards you I'm going to provide a sacrifice for their sin in my mind because the Bible says you think where are you getting that scripture the Bible says the lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world in God's mind before the foundation of the world he already had a sacrifice of love to go to Calvary to take care of your sin he loved you before you were even born and so if you got the cycle of Eternity now if it's back then you got that cycle it was always was there the love of God towards you then you come around and meet us right here at the end you know what happens with the cycle of Eternity you meet back again the same thing that was in the beginning you meet it again you know where we're coming back to I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship I'm coming back to this constant love I'm coming back to this excellent way I'm coming back to a victory in Divine love in my life that I'm not going to live by feelings anymore coming back to tapping into that eternity that God's always loved me God's always loved me God never did stop loving me there's nothing I can do to make him stop loving me there's nothing that I can do good to make me make him love me more and there's nothing I can do bad to make me any love him love me eat any less either way his love doesn't change oh can you catch it this morning God's love never changes such a curse of failed hopes we get married and we signed a prenuptial agreement you know why because really they expect it to fail right from the start we're so used to failure and people failing us and our mate failing yes that we're already set up to think failure right off the bat sign a prenuptial because this will probably end someday we're used to things fading away we're used to things falling apart we're so used to it we don't trust the church we don't trust anything we don't trust God anymore Church attendance is at an all-time low after covet now Church attendance is at an all-time low right now Church attendant because why people are losing trust they're they're turning to other things other things besides God and they don't need the church anymore it's at an all-time low their trust has been broken they can't bring the people to a reality of God only to a religion you can't preach a religion to people you have to pray and seek God for the moving of the true spirit of God to change hearts and lives so that's the failures of this generation what about your own failures do they affect us it's enough to deal with other people's failures what about your own well maybe you didn't think about your own maybe you only think about how other people have failed you but guess what you failed too and you've failed other people too so how's that we can't have more of a love for people when we know we fail just as much as the next person people live dominated by their own failures emotionally affecting them and then the next stage for being dominated by their own failures is the next stage is a thing called the fear of failure you know there's no end to the devil's paths and ways there's no into it all ends the same way all his paths go to the same end the devil's past go ahead and choose one if you want choose Hollywood choose the series of the world TV choose books choose whatever you want you it all ends the same place more fear more addiction more medicine more movies the next movie coming out more money more defeated more negative all the paths that you want to choose from the world all going to need the same end result lines up the same place you say what ends up in Hell well the devil has a hell but the devil has a living hell did you know it's not hell someday but he has a people living it's a living hell they're living in with all the love of Christ all of us would end up in a living hell that means tormented now not someday in a lake of fire they live burdened and tormented now you say well how did I get here well maybe it's because you've thrown yourself into all the paths of the enemy thinking that's going to give me relief and that's going to make me laugh and that's going to be the right thing leads to the same thing of Torment and fear what is Hell separation from the love of God it's not a place as such hell is living where you're separated from the presence of God that is already hell many have not reached hell yet but they're already in a living hell a world of fear most of it they had too many failed things in life of other people and themselves and even have a fear of failure which by the way has been diagnosed now as a sickness has a name and I can't even pronounce it it's called actifobia act act actually phobia means a fear of failure at phobia is an intense fear of failure it comes from the Greek word uh attaches meaning unfortunate people with actophobia May avoid any situation where they see a potential for failure such as an exam or a job interview it can also mean being afraid of a failed relationship a failed career or being a disappointment to others the fear often becomes a self-fulfilling for example if you're so scared of failing a test that you refuse to take the test you may end up failing an entire class fear failure can lead to a broad range of emotional and psychological problems including shame depression anxiety panic attacks or low self-esteem it may negatively affect how you perform at school or work or how you interact with friends and family members this is all the stuff that comes from the fear of failure you haven't failed yet but you have a fear of failure emotionally affects us fear does that but my Bible says perfect love cast out all fear I'm giving you the answer perfect love cast out fear and I'm not going to read any more of the psychology that is and they even have a medicine for this a specific medicine for this this phobia of the fear of failure it's an illness now we can have a lot of failure and we do but the worst thing is failure defining us to being a complete failure and the love of God this morning says the opposite you may have even failed him but he will never fail you let me deal with one more thing here and then we'll have a quote and we'll we'll end this you say well God has failed me too God failed me one time or God failed me many times really really I hope you're listening online and everywhere God failed me too really are you sure if he really loved me he would have give me what I wanted and what I prayed for really let me ask you who that sounds like in your life mommy and daddy if you really loved me you would have given me what I wanted and what I asked for who's that sound like sounds like our kids will be kids because they don't have wisdom yet be careful that you don't conclude on your kids conclusions sounds like a kid why because that's how a kid defines love it's how immaturity defines love did you give them everything that they ask for and that means that you that means that you to them that your love is hinged upon whether you give them everything that they ask for well you know as a parent now that you can't give them certain things because if you gave them certain things you wouldn't love them at all don't waver on that parents you got a duty a mandate from scripture to hold up the token and hold up the word of life until that kid has launched in their own life and if it's your home you've got a duty to hold up in love the responsibility of this word because you remove God's boundaries you remove God's uh landmarks you're in trouble everything will begin to unravel and you removed them because your kid's telling you you don't love them mom if you did if you gave everything to the kids you were not a good parent there are some things that I withheld from my babies my wife and I would help my babies because I love them I withheld them from because I because I did love them it was good for them if it was good for them I didn't withhold it that's what the scripture says how much will our heavenly father give to his children what they desire and then he talks about the Holy Ghost how much more he would give you the Holy Ghost to them so that ask him so the good things and we we're going to give because we love them but if it's not something that's good for them and it's going to have a trickle-down effect we're not going to give that to our child can you say mine if you say you need some classes on parenting I'm doing it right now so now if you was is here now so some things in my family life and I wasn't Perfect by any means but some things I used my veto power and said no because I love them and it would be best to teach them something for their future so I said no can't have that some things I gave because it would be good for their future and would have a trickle-down effect we all do this as parents but God sometimes we look at different but God's the great parent can you say Amen so I want to say about this thing that God failed me one thing if he if it did look like he failed two things I want to mention to you I would not conclude on that about God until you get the full story when you get to the other side I would be warned you to conclude that God has failed you until you get the full story on the other side because it's very difficult to take the human mindset of love and attach any Scripture to God ever failing his people so if you're going to quickly just write off God failed me he didn't answer my prayer God didn't answer my prayer God failed me be careful where you go with that until you get the full story because there is a song that says we'll talk it over in the by and by there will be some mysterious things that happen in life that will never get an explanation for but you will get an explanation God will graciously explain and I gotta know that my God had some good reasons that I didn't know about so I just warned you be careful of going with that until you get the full story on the other side because his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts how many know the scripture his ways are higher than our ways it's higher than our feelings his love is deeper and higher than our thoughts and he knows and the other thing if it looked like second thing if he did fail you okay if he did fail you his love never did fail you because I got scripture for that this morning If he if it looks like to you God fail you his love never did fail you and never has failed you the Bible says charity never fails Hallelujah so I think the reason Paul said this as I move into this last quote if you guys want to bring it up we need to move into this Divine love and move into this cycle of eternal life because his love for us is eternal can you say Amen this is what revealed in the mystery of Melchizedek as at the last days it had to be preached who's this Melchizedek if you want to catch before you look at the quote if you want to catch the mystery that God broke to his bride about us breaking into the Eternal who is this Melchizedek under his life as a material because it says the Melchizedek he had no beginning in days nor ending of life and yet he's there in flesh in front of Abraham having communion with him who is this Melchizedek who is it well the revelation of Melchizedek showed that we have a theophany and there's something Eternal besides these bodies and if we ever Son of God we always were a Son of God the logos can you say Amen we come from the logos we come from God say where are you getting that Jesus said I come from God I go back to God he had an eternal perspective this is only a temporary slot in time and I come from the thought of God I'm here for my time on Earth and I'm headed back into the thought of God he said he loved me from the beginning and he'll love me in the end Hallelujah so when you tap into this it produces rest and Faith like never before I would like to elaborate on the mystery of Melchizedek because that's the mystery that lays in there in Hebrews that Paul said I have many things to say about Melchizedek but you know it's not the time yet what the end time it was time to break the mystery that in his life is a mystery that if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved First Corinthians we have one waiting Eternal in the heavens we have a body that's Eternal in the heavens and that means if we're a Son of God we had an eternal body it means he loved us from the beginning to give us a body like that we came from him he had to love us to give us about it we had to be his sons and daughters and so we're just here for this what Paul call it this light Affliction for a moment my 57 years is just a light Affliction according to Paul and I don't know if it'll be 58 or 60 or 65 I hope I get to retire somewhere there but you know I don't know when it'll be but I just have this small slot that I dropped from eternity into time but in that Realm he's always loved me and always will I come into this Earth that's failed people have failed me I've failed people I've made mistakes felt like a failure all these other things but once my Revelation starts to tap in what his word's saying through the message of the last days I start to hear from my theophany glory be to God I start to hear from my theophany when you recognize the food of God in the last east as Eagle food then you say if I'm eating eagle food I'm an eagle can you say amen and if you're raising your hair saying praise God this is affecting my body and my life you have heard from your theophany where do you get that term it's in the Bible if this Earthly Tabernacle dissolved we have one Eternal in the heavens Paul teach taught on it Revelations 2 9 I'm going to end with this I promise I'm going to end with this and I won't be a failure in that I'm going to read this quote and I'm going to end the service I won't fail you it's a long quote though I'm just warning you Revelations 2 9 I Know Thy Works here's the here's the scripture and thy tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan so hear the pressure in the second age was that they had to deal with Jews that are not but are of the synagogue of Satan so these are Jews these are people these Gentiles here coming to the Lord there's some Jews that become Christians there's some other Jews that didn't come fully in didn't get the Holy Ghost so you got different groups there and here's they say they're Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan the mere Association of kind-hearted people with the True Believer might well bring death in return for their kindness wow what a pressure the mere Association of kind-hearted people with the True Believer might well bring death in return for their kindness that's the reality that that church age dealt with now that's the one quote the one sentence that's ministered to me the last few days is to realize wow I'm going to get persecution sometimes even in our own camp back towards me and I have to pray now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people so aren't you glad he knows next one there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he Stern the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation he didn't hold it back he didn't stop it God he didn't stop this tribulation and the suffering and this being killed because remember the red horse spider the white horse rider and deception begin to run Revelations the red horse rider begin to shed blood did anybody disagree with him that was the church the so-called Church red blood writing same writer Satan writing as a church killing anybody who disagreed with them and now God's not holding that he's letting it happen but he says I know your tribulation I'm not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling bachness is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer good question I'd say it's come to most of our minds how could God that is what the chief said how could God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they ask in Malachi 1 1 3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet you say where in hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and I laid his mountains and his Heritage waits for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care that's what kind of love they knew but God said that this love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because God hath chosen you to Salvation through segregation of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul next one he may commit you to suffering as he did job that's his prerogative can you say amen he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace if God didn't hold from the foundation of purpose for your life then we would we then it would he would be the author of frustration in our life and he's not the author of frustration in your life God's not he's like you say I've been confused I'm just confused brother Paul the message confuses me the what's happened in my life confusing me I understand but God did not cause that confusion don't take god with that God has not ordered your life to confuse you and hurt you but he loves you to save you and to love you and to fill you and to transform you into be a friend to you can I get an amen it wasn't God that did those things to you he may have allowed a certain life but he has a purpose in his purpose he would he would be the author of frustration and not a peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled the Cloudy oh I love that how many wants to be perfect to establish strengthened and settled that's his desire the Cloudy style look at this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval you got an easy going time and it still waters and you're just feeling so good praise the Lord God must be approving of me don't think that way because tomorrow you won't have Still Waters anymore and if you're going on that's your approval then tomorrow he doesn't approve of me anymore a big baby you can't look at it that way neither are bright skies and Stillwater signs of another world his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had of us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love for us where he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons can somebody say Amen [Laughter] and how shall I prove my love to him how many wants to prove your love to him how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy in the middle of my trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass if you ran from him he didn't want you to run something hits you some loss in your life something done wrong somebody failed you you see you feel God failed you he didn't want you to run he didn't want you to run you ran but he didn't want you to run and then this song says and then he ran to me prodigal son comes back and the Bible says he didn't even make it to the house yet the father ran towards him ran to me took me in his arms he didn't want you to run he didn't want you to quit some of you did some of you said I'm done I'm finished God didn't want you to do that always amazing me when somebody goes through something and I give him Grace and time and patience but the very thing that they need good Fellowship the presence of the Lord around the right kind of people that's the one thing they run from find all kinds of other friends and find other things but the one thing the presence of God and he rant me see [Music] so this altar is open this morning come and pray come and pray with me if you want to come and pray [Music]
