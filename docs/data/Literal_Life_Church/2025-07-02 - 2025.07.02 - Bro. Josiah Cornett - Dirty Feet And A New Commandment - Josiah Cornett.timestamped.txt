[0:15] See this return. The more that I
[0:19] surrender,
[0:22] the lighter
[0:24] my Lord.
[0:27] The more that I release my cares, the
[0:33] more he takes control.
[0:38] The more that I can humble myself,

[11:52] I just got to tell you, Satan,
[11:56] you can't cross the bloodline
[11:59] [Music]
[12:01] because I'm covered by his blood.
[12:09] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[12:13] you're going to lose this battle
[12:16] tonight. Just remember,
[12:20] you can't cross the bloodline.

[12:48] you're going to lose this battle
[12:51] tonight. Just remember,
[12:55] you can't cross the bloodline.
[13:00] Oh,
[13:02] and even though my spirits flow
[13:06] and it seems I can hardly go, but still,
[13:11] hallelujah,
[13:12] I see victory.
[13:20] Many times I'm walking by faith. Can't
[13:24] see what lies before me, but still.
[13:29] Hallelujah. I see victory.
[13:34] Oh,
[13:37] I just got to tell you, Satan,
[13:41] you can't cross the blood line
[13:46] because I'm covered by his blood.
[13:54] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[13:58] you're going to lose this battle
[14:01] tonight. Just remember,
[14:05] you can't cross the bloodline.
[14:09] Oh,
[14:12] sometimes our battle gets hot and it
[14:16] seems we're fighting a lot. I remember
[14:21] I'm standing on the rock.
[14:28] So Satan, if I were you, I' turn around
[14:35] and give up to cut. I do believe
[14:40] you're bound to lose.
[14:44] Oh,

[15:08] you're going to lose this battle
[15:10] tonight. Just remember,
[15:14] you can't cross the bloodline.
[15:18] Last time I just got to tell you, I just
[15:21] got to tell you, Satan,
[15:25] you can't cross the bloodline
[15:29] [Music]
[15:30] because I'm covered by his blood.
[15:38] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[15:42] you're going to lose this battle
[15:45] tonight. Just remember,
[15:49] you can't cross the bloodline.
[15:53] Why should I worry?
[15:57] And why should I fear
[16:01] when the very same Jesus
[16:06] stays always near?
[16:09] He lives in my heart
[16:13] and he hears when I cry.
[16:18] I'll call on his name till the storm
[16:23] passes by. Sing that. Oh, and why should
[16:27] I worry?
[16:30] And why should I fear?
[16:34] When the very same Jesus,
[16:39] he stays always.
[16:43] He lives in my heart
[16:46] and he hears when I cry.
[16:51] I'll call on his name
[16:54] till the storm passes by.
[17:01] Hallelujah.
[17:02] Praise the Lord tonight. Thank you, God.
[17:05] Amen. Amen. We'll sing that. In Christ
[17:08] alone I place my trust. Let's all stand
[17:10] tonight as a prayer request. Get ready.
[17:13] Praise the Lord.
[17:16] Christ alone will I glory.
[17:20] Though I could pride myself in battles
[17:24] won.
[17:27] For I've been blessed beyond measure
[17:32] and by his grace alone I've overcome.
[17:40] window.
[17:42] I could stop and count successes
[17:46] like diamonds in
[17:49] my hands.
[17:52] But the trophies could not equal
[17:56] to the grace
[17:59] by which I stand
[18:04] in Christ alone.
[18:08] I place my trust
[18:12] and find my glory in the power of the
[18:18] cross.
[18:21] In every victory,
[18:25] let it be said
[18:28] of me.
[18:30] My source of strength. Is that where you
[18:33] are tonight? My source of hope
[18:37] is Christ alone.
[18:41] And in Christ alone will I glory.
[18:47] For only by his grace I am redeemed.
[18:52] Oh yes Lord. Oh, and only his tender
[18:57] mercy
[18:59] can reach beyond my weakness to my
[19:04] knees.
[19:06] Oh, and now
[19:10] I seek no greater honor than just to
[19:15] know you more. Thank you, Lord. Oh, and
[19:20] to count my gains as losses for the
[19:25] glory. Hallelujah. Glory of my Lord.
[19:31] In Christ the Lord.

[25:47] Aren't you so glad that we serve a
[25:50] healing God this evening?
[25:54] A healer of our hearts, a healer of our
[25:56] bodies, and most importantly, a healer
[25:59] of our souls. Amen.
[26:02] So glad to see everyone out tonight. I
[26:04] see a lot of familiar faces. Uh some
[26:06] fresh faces, but familiar to me. I want
[26:09] to thank the uh vessels for coming by
[26:12] tonight. Um we were just down at their
[26:14] church. They were uh celebrating the
[26:17] Lord's moving in their life as he's
[26:19] changing a turning a corner and such a
[26:23] such a exciting time in our lives when
[26:25] the Lord turns a corner. So as we
[26:28] celebrated the uh the great testimony
[26:30] that was there and the the work of the
[26:32] Lord that's been happening there at um
[26:36] the truth tabernacle in Defiance many
[26:39] years. I I remember that I had preached
[26:41] my first sermon there at uh defines
[26:43] truth tabernacle. My first sermon out. I
[26:46] think here was my first sermon. My very
[26:48] next sermon was there with brother James
[26:50] and sister Betty and Justin. I think you
[26:52] came along later after that. But uh you
[26:54] didn't have to uh go through the pain of
[26:56] listening to one of my first sermons.
[26:58] Bless your heart. But so glad to see
[27:00] friends with us this evening. And uh so
[27:02] glad to see you all. Why don't we go
[27:05] before the Lord tonight?
[27:07] Dear precious heavenly father, we just
[27:10] come before you, Lord. So grateful,
[27:13] Lord,
[27:15] to come into your awesome presence.
[27:19] Lord, to
[27:21] lay aside our humanity for a second,
[27:23] Lord, you told us to lay all of our
[27:26] burdens at your feet.
[27:29] And Lord, I do that tonight by laying
[27:32] down my humanity and just asking you,
[27:34] Lord, to step over me, Lord, and
[27:37] minister to your people. I don't want my
[27:40] humanity get in the way my my different
[27:43] issues that I have, Father. But Lord,
[27:46] let your word speak, Father, and may it
[27:49] draw us closer to you and closer to one
[27:52] another.
[27:54] And Lord, I pray that would also cause
[27:56] us to reach out our hands, Lord, and
[27:59] draw those that are in the highways and
[28:01] byways still, Lord, and cause them to
[28:04] come. May we be the hands of Jesus that
[28:08] cause them to drink
[28:10] and cause one to live. Grant, Lord, we
[28:14] come to your waters tonight. We pray
[28:16] that you'd open them to our souls in
[28:18] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[28:22] If you would, we'll go right to the
[28:24] scripture this evening
[28:27] and Luke chap 22
[28:33] and verse 17.
[28:44] And you may find the uh this
[28:47] a little bit of a funny introductory
[28:50] text this evening, but uh I want to take
[28:52] a text from the communion supper. We
[28:55] have our own communion happening um in
[28:58] next couple weeks here. Not this uh
[29:01] Sunday, but I believe it's the following
[29:02] Sunday. We'll be having our local church
[29:04] communion. I thought it would be a good
[29:06] time to bring this pretext and um I had
[29:09] shared this with um the believers there
[29:12] in defiance and just felt it still
[29:14] lingering on my heart in the theme of
[29:16] church community and uh so before we go
[29:21] to go to the word I'll just let you know
[29:23] the crestles here have already listened
[29:24] to this tonight. I I have to apologize
[29:26] for that but you all can look around and
[29:29] if they're still paying attention
[29:30] halfway through remember they're seeing
[29:32] it for the second time. So may that be
[29:34] an encouragement to you.
[29:36] Luke 22:17
[29:39] speaking of Jesus now he took the cup
[29:42] and gave thanks and said take this and
[29:46] divide it among yourselves for I say
[29:48] unto you I will not drink of the fruit
[29:49] of the vine the kingdom of heaven shall
[29:51] come. And he took bread and gave them
[29:53] thanks and break it and gave unto them
[29:55] saying this is my body which is given
[29:56] for you. This do in remembrance of me.
[30:00] Likewise also the cup after supper
[30:03] saying this cup is the new testament in
[30:05] my blood which is shed for you. May the
[30:09] Lord bless the reading of his word. You
[30:10] may be seated.
[30:12] So I just like to take those first four
[30:15] scriptures there 17-20 and look at uh
[30:18] this is a pretext a thought I'd like to
[30:21] bring to your to your attention tonight
[30:23] and speak on the the theme of dirty feet
[30:26] and a new commandment. dirty feet and a
[30:29] new commandment. But here we see that
[30:32] Christ before he introduces the
[30:33] ordinance of footwashing, he he
[30:36] introduces this this idea of communion
[30:38] and the the breaking the bread and the
[30:40] the taking of the wine. And we all know
[30:42] that very well what those symbolizes
[30:44] that the the breaking of the bread shows
[30:46] that his body would be broken and was
[30:48] broken into a many membered body. So we
[30:51] can all thank the Lord that there's a
[30:52] many membered body as evidenced by the
[30:54] resurrection of Jesus Christ this
[30:56] evening and that that that wine that he
[30:59] was giving us was the new wine of the
[31:02] new covenant a symbol of his blood. But
[31:06] I want to call your attention to first
[31:07] verse 17. It says he took the cup and
[31:10] then in verse 20 likewise also the cup
[31:14] after supper. And we find that when we
[31:17] study the the Jewish custom and the
[31:19] history and the the time of that day is
[31:22] that the Jewish Passover which is what
[31:23] this was based upon was structured and
[31:27] the the structure of the meal was
[31:28] actually dictated by four different
[31:30] cups. In Christianity we also we usually
[31:32] just think of the one cup that Jesus
[31:35] served as the the symbol of his blood.
[31:38] But in reality there were four cups. The
[31:40] first the first cup was the cup that
[31:43] opened the meal and commenced the entire
[31:46] evening's service, if you will. And the
[31:49] second cup was the cup that was shared
[31:52] and partaken of after the uh telling of
[31:55] the the history of the Jews leaving
[31:58] Egypt after Egypt and the story of
[32:01] Exodus. And then we find that on the
[32:04] third cup, that third cup is what
[32:05] happens after supper. And that's the
[32:08] third cup that Christ parttook of. And
[32:10] then there's a fourth cup that uh
[32:12] happens after supper. And then after you
[32:15] have some hymns and what they call the
[32:17] halal, which is the singing of Psalms
[32:20] 113 through Psalms 118 as we know it.
[32:23] And then that would conclude the
[32:25] Passover service.
[32:28] But we go to find out that the Jews took
[32:31] these four cups very seriously. And it
[32:33] maps out against the scriptures in
[32:35] Exodus 6 and verses 6 and 7 where Christ
[32:39] says or excuse me where it's written
[32:41] first that I will bring you out from
[32:43] under the burdens of the Egyptians.
[32:46] And that's the first cup, the cup of
[32:48] sanctification.
[32:50] And then God says, "And I will rid you
[32:52] out from under their bondage." And
[32:55] that's the cup of praise.
[32:58] And then there's the next verse that
[32:59] says, "I will redeem you." The third
[33:02] cup, the cup of redemption.
[33:05] Now, that's the the cup that Christ
[33:07] paused at and says very fittingly, take
[33:10] this cup because from now on, this cup
[33:13] of redemption, this third cup that
[33:15] you've always included among the fourth,
[33:18] that's a very special cup. From this
[33:20] time forward, it's not only a symbol of
[33:22] what was past, but it's a symbol of
[33:24] what's happening now. This is the New
[33:27] Testament. It's a symbol. will do it in
[33:29] remembrance of the blood that I shed for
[33:30] you.
[33:32] But then we go on and we find out that
[33:34] Christ never parttook of that fourth
[33:36] cup. If you go over to John 13, you'll
[33:40] find the first communion service that
[33:42] was ever preached. And we've heard a lot
[33:44] of communion services through the years,
[33:45] but I don't think there's any communion
[33:47] service that ever tops John 13
[33:50] through17. Those five chapters, if you
[33:52] can read them when you go home this
[33:54] week, it's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[33:57] And I want to turn over to John 13. Not
[33:59] to read the whole sermon because I
[34:01] wouldn't be able to do justice to it all
[34:03] on Wednesday night, but to just pick up
[34:05] Christ's theme if we could.
[34:09] Starting at verse one
[34:20] says, "Now before the feast of the
[34:22] Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
[34:24] was come that he should depart out of
[34:26] this world unto the Father, having loved
[34:29] his own which were in the world, he
[34:31] loved them until the end." and supper
[34:35] being ended.
[34:37] So now we know at what time we're at.
[34:38] We're just after the third cup. We're
[34:41] just after
[34:43] Christ introduces the ordinances of
[34:46] communion. And John is very unique in
[34:49] that his account is the only account
[34:51] that excludes the ordinances of
[34:53] communion that we are so accustomed to
[34:56] and focuses on the ordinance of the
[34:58] footwashing.
[35:00] And we see what Christ does after supper
[35:03] being ended, the devil now having put
[35:05] into the heart of Judas's scariot,
[35:07] Simon's son, to betray him.
[35:10] Verse four, he rose from supper and laid
[35:13] aside his garments and took a towel and
[35:16] girded himself. And after that, he
[35:18] poured water into a basin and began to
[35:20] wash the disciples feet and to wipe them
[35:23] with a towel wherewith he was girded.
[35:28] I want you to just pause for a moment
[35:31] because we have a moment tonight and I'm
[35:33] not going to be long. But put yourself
[35:35] in Christ's shoes right now because I
[35:38] don't think we can fully appreciate
[35:39] what's happening if we just think of
[35:41] Christ as 100% deed right now. Okay? I
[35:45] I'm going to instruct my disciples and
[35:47] I'm going to show them a a new
[35:50] commandment which is what he's building
[35:51] up to and I'm going to show them how
[35:55] they should humble themselves. And
[35:57] that's what I'm it's it's all
[35:59] instructional.
[36:00] But we know that Christ was both 100%
[36:02] God and 100% man. There wasn't a mix of
[36:06] two. It was he was both God and man. And
[36:09] so you can imagine on the eve of his
[36:12] death, what's going through the heart of
[36:15] the man Christ Jesus.
[36:19] I wonder how many has ever had to say
[36:20] goodbye to a loved one for a long period
[36:23] of time. Maybe he was at a deathbed.
[36:26] Maybe a soldier that had to leave their
[36:29] family and go overseas or maybe on a
[36:31] long-term business trip. But you had to
[36:34] say some parting words. And it's during
[36:37] those times that all the things that we
[36:38] feel,
[36:40] we try to reach down in the treasure of
[36:43] our hearts and put some kind of
[36:45] expression to them.
[36:48] And some will express it in words and
[36:50] perhaps a a parting gift. The husband
[36:54] might give his wife a piece of jewelry
[36:56] that she can hold on to and look at and
[36:58] remember every waking day that she has
[37:02] that he's coming home for me. I know
[37:05] he's out there somewhere. He's going to
[37:06] come off the battlefield. He's going to
[37:08] come home from this long business trip.
[37:10] Whatever it is, I've got something
[37:12] permanent that I can hold on to. But
[37:15] what's remarkable is the man Christ
[37:17] Jesus when he reaches into the depths of
[37:20] his heart to pull out the treasure
[37:22] thereof and get give him something
[37:24] lasting.
[37:26] He takes off his outer garment.
[37:28] He girds himself out like a servant. He
[37:32] gets down on his knees and he begins to
[37:35] wash the disciples feet.
[37:39] And a practical person might say, "Well,
[37:40] why that? That doesn't seem
[37:43] very lasting.
[37:45] That seems like their feet are just
[37:47] going to get dirty again." Kind of like
[37:50] when you make up your bed in the
[37:51] morning. Why am I doing this? It's just
[37:52] going to get unmade again. Why do I have
[37:54] to wash my hands? They're just going to
[37:55] get dirty again. Same thing with the
[37:57] feet. It's not a permanent thing. But to
[38:00] me, and this is just my trying to
[38:03] sympathize with the heart of a man,
[38:06] Christ Jesus,
[38:08] being a man myself, made in the image of
[38:10] the God, which Christ was the divinity
[38:13] of,
[38:15] I would think that Christ is trying to
[38:17] say, "It doesn't matter that your feet
[38:20] are getting going to get dirty again.
[38:23] It doesn't matter.
[38:26] I've told you before that you must
[38:28] forgive someone 70 times seven. And now
[38:31] I'm going to show you that it doesn't
[38:33] matter if I have to do something that
[38:36] humbles me to clean you.
[38:40] And I find that so beautiful because I
[38:42] know through my relationship with Christ
[38:45] that he's gotten down many times on his
[38:47] knees and washed my dirty feet. Oh, he
[38:52] might have he might have purged me with
[38:53] his blood. He might have filled me with
[38:56] his Holy Spirit, but I still have to
[38:57] walk in this world. I still have to be
[39:00] in this world though I'm not of it. And
[39:02] as I'm walking through the world, like
[39:04] these disciples had to walk down to the
[39:07] the supper table through the streets of
[39:10] of Jerusalem that day and they had to
[39:12] walk through all the filth that they
[39:14] were surrounded by because there wasn't
[39:16] good sanitation back then. Their feet
[39:19] were filthy with feces.
[39:22] And Christ was willing to get down and
[39:25] wash their feet. He was a He was willing
[39:28] to say, "This is so important to me that
[39:31] I'm going to establish it as an
[39:32] ordinance. You have seen me do it unto
[39:35] you. Now, if I then your Lord and Master
[39:38] have done unto you, should not you also
[39:41] do it unto your brethren?
[39:44] Should not we be able to forgive? Should
[39:47] we not we be able to humble ourselves?"
[39:50] So many times we fulfill the ordinances,
[39:52] but we forget what the the type of and
[39:54] we we don't we don't solemnly think
[39:57] about that. Paul admonished the church
[40:00] in Corinthians and said, "Watch out
[40:01] because you're coming to the Lord's
[40:03] table and you're fulfilling the
[40:05] ordinances, but your life is not worthy
[40:07] of them. You're fulfilling the
[40:09] ordinances of taking the bread and
[40:11] you're and and and taking the wine, but
[40:14] you're this this is a symbol of union
[40:18] because communion actually means
[40:19] together and oneness. And that's that's
[40:23] what you're symbolizing here. But your
[40:25] life doesn't reflect it. Your life is
[40:27] not worthy of the gospel. You are
[40:29] profaining the very communion that
[40:31] you're partaking of. And I wonder if we
[40:34] aren't sometimes guilty when we come
[40:36] down to footwashing of profaining the
[40:39] very ordinance that we're taking part
[40:42] in. Yes, I I can wash my brother's feet
[40:45] and I can pray over my sister, but what
[40:48] about between that and the next
[40:49] footwashing?
[40:51] Is your life living that part of the
[40:54] gospel?
[40:56] Because Christ is getting ready to
[40:58] introduce a new commandment.
[41:01] Oh, I love it. But I want you to pause
[41:04] for a moment before we get there and
[41:06] look at who the company is
[41:11] because you read through 13 and you find
[41:14] out in that chapter that at this point
[41:16] Judas has not yet been dismissed to go
[41:20] out and do as what's been in his heart
[41:22] to do. It means amongst all those
[41:24] people, Christ got down and washed the
[41:29] feet of a man who so gave himself to the
[41:34] devil's work that the Bible says the
[41:36] devil entered him. He washed his feet of
[41:40] a man that rebuked another woman for
[41:42] washing his feet
[41:45] because he wanted to take her money and
[41:47] steal it as the keeper of the bag.
[41:50] He was willing to humble himself not
[41:52] only to the true, the faithful, the
[41:56] honorable Christian, but was willing to
[41:59] show himself humble to all.
[42:03] And then he concludes and says, "If I
[42:05] then your Lord and Master have done it
[42:07] unto you, so you ought to do it unto one
[42:09] another."
[42:11] Oh friends, the scripture is rich.
[42:18] Going on down in the verses,
[42:23] it says in 34,
[42:26] "Then a new commandment I give unto you,
[42:29] that ye love one another as I have loved
[42:32] you, that ye love also one another, and
[42:36] by this shall all men know that you are
[42:39] my disciples, if you have that love one
[42:42] towards another."
[42:45] I love it here because up until this
[42:48] point, you could have fulfilled the
[42:50] ordinances of communion without having a
[42:53] church. You could have fulfilled the
[42:55] ordinance of communion without having
[42:57] anybody else in your life. You could
[42:59] have been a hermit. You could have gone
[43:00] out in the woods. You could have been as
[43:02] brother Brandham would have been. You
[43:04] know, remember how brother Brandham
[43:05] wanted to go out in the mountains and
[43:06] kidnap Midi and take her away and and
[43:08] and and go out there and and just stomp
[43:11] down whenever he needed to. He could
[43:13] have fulfilled taking part of the bread.
[43:16] He could have fulfilled taking part of
[43:19] the wine. But he could not have done
[43:22] footwashing. He could have not loved
[43:24] another because it takes another to love
[43:31] forever. Christ institutes what he wants
[43:33] his church to look like. Not
[43:35] individuals. Not people that just come
[43:38] to church and say, "Okay, I checked the
[43:39] box. I was here. I took my communion. I
[43:41] took my service. I took my part of the
[43:43] wood word and now I'm going back to my
[43:45] home. No, he says there's there's
[43:47] there's another that me that that's
[43:49] coming in here because yes, while
[43:51] communion means in the Latin root it
[43:54] means together and and a oneness,
[43:58] community means together and service.
[44:01] And so God ties this communion message,
[44:04] his first ever communion message to a
[44:07] new commandment and to an act of
[44:09] service.
[44:11] Because let's face it, folks, you can't
[44:14] fulfill the footwashing ordinance
[44:15] without having somebody else in your
[44:17] life. You can't go wash your own feet. I
[44:21] suppose you could, but it it it gets a
[44:23] little bit harder over time as we get
[44:24] older and less flexible and a little bit
[44:26] heavier. It gets harder to to reach
[44:28] those feet. We need somebody else in our
[44:31] lives.
[44:36] And look at this fourth cup. Then
[44:39] I want to call your attention to the
[44:40] fourth cup that Christ misses
[44:43] and maybe we can go over to it just as
[44:45] an evidence that he misses it.
[44:55] I'm sorry. I thought I had the scripture
[44:57] written down. Here it is. Matthew 26 and
[45:00] 29.
[45:07] Recall that the fourth cup is that cup
[45:10] of acceptance, also called the cup of
[45:13] anticipation,
[45:15] mapped to the scripture, I will take you
[45:17] to me for a people.
[45:20] In 26:29,
[45:29] Christ says, "But I say unto you, I will
[45:31] not drink henceforth this fruit of the
[45:32] vine until the day when I drink it new
[45:35] with you in my father's kingdom." And
[45:37] remember at the end after they sing the
[45:40] the songs of hell, they take the fourth
[45:42] cup and that concludes the service. But
[45:44] here in verse 30, and when they had sung
[45:46] a song, a hymn, they went out in the
[45:48] Mount of Olives. So what is Christ
[45:51] symbolizing? He's saying, "I have not
[45:54] yet received my people." That is still a
[45:56] cup of anticipation for us all. We're
[45:58] all looking forward to the day where God
[46:01] will take us home where there will be
[46:03] that rapture.
[46:05] But I'd like to I'd like to point out
[46:06] that the word in that scripture is, "I
[46:09] will take for me a people." God is
[46:12] looking for a people. He's not looking
[46:14] for individuals. The rapture is not an
[46:17] individual event.
[46:20] Oh, I'm so glad it's not an individual
[46:22] event because if it was an individ
[46:24] individual event, I might be one of the
[46:26] last to go. And I know we're always
[46:28] talking about you ought to be of the
[46:30] mindset that if if if there's only one
[46:32] person that's going, it's going to be
[46:34] me. And and that's a perfectly right
[46:37] thought in one sense, but in the other
[46:39] sense, be careful with that because I
[46:41] know that it's not going to be just me.
[46:43] I'm going to be one of them. But it's
[46:46] not going to be just me because he is
[46:47] coming back for a people. There's going
[46:50] to be day a day when they which are dead
[46:52] and gone will be raptured up before us
[46:54] and we will meet them together in the
[46:57] air. Oh, hallelujah. And I want to say
[46:59] this togetherness, this togetherness is
[47:01] this catching away the bride of Jesus
[47:03] Christ. It's not no elevator religion.
[47:06] It's not like when you press a button at
[47:07] the hotel and you get on there and
[47:08] you're like, "Oh my goodness, I got the
[47:10] I got the elevator all to myself." And
[47:13] then that awkward person comes in right
[47:15] behind you. You say, "What am I gonna do
[47:18] now?" And you just kind of get into your
[47:19] corner and they get into theirs and you
[47:21] you both go up together.
[47:23] That's not the kind of catching away
[47:26] that we're talking about. We're not
[47:28] talking about an individual religion.
[47:31] We're talking about a religion
[47:34] and a promise that is to a people. And
[47:37] it's by God's grace that every one of
[47:39] you, I believe, that are sitting here
[47:41] this evening are part of those people.
[47:44] And yes, we believe in an individual
[47:46] walk in the Lord Jesus Christ. But you
[47:49] cannot separate the fact that you are a
[47:52] citizen of a country that's to come.
[47:56] And by the way,
[47:59] we confess whether or not we're citizens
[48:01] of that country. And citizenship is not
[48:05] just we sometimes focus so much upon the
[48:08] relationship the bride of Jesus Christ
[48:11] and I'm his bride. It's it's Jesus and
[48:13] me. But remember it's still a many
[48:16] membered body. So don't get so caught up
[48:19] in your own individual relationship with
[48:21] Jesus Christ that you forget that he
[48:24] also said I want you to serve one
[48:26] another.
[48:28] There's a body of people here.
[48:35] I think it's one of the most greatest
[48:37] opportunities in this life that there is
[48:41] a body of Jesus Christ I can serve.
[48:44] I wasn't there when Jesus's feet were
[48:46] dirty. I would have loved to have been
[48:49] the woman
[48:51] dead in my sins. they could come and
[48:55] grab an anointing bottle and wash his
[48:58] feet and dry them with my hair. I would
[49:01] have loved to pour out my love upon the
[49:03] Lord that way.
[49:05] But that wasn't my time. But I'm not
[49:09] deprived of the body of Jesus Christ to
[49:11] love upon. I have the body of Jesus
[49:14] Christ here.
[49:16] Can you say amen?
[49:23] In Revelations 21
[49:26] says, "I heard a great voice coming out
[49:28] of heaven, saying, Behold, the
[49:29] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[49:32] will dwell with them, and they shall be
[49:34] his people, and God himself shall be
[49:37] with them, and he will be their God."
[49:41] It's a community. When you're going over
[49:43] to heaven,
[49:46] you might have heard the old adage that
[49:48] was said so often among us that you you
[49:50] better like the noise, but you better
[49:52] not just like the noise. You better like
[49:55] the people, too.
[49:57] You better not you. Maybe maybe that's
[50:00] something if you're scared of people
[50:02] here on earth, we're always talking
[50:03] about the noise and how you need to get
[50:05] over the noise. Maybe some people need
[50:06] to get over the people because the noise
[50:09] isn't going away, but neither are the
[50:11] people who are making that noise. I
[50:14] don't plan to go away. I when you when
[50:15] we get over there, I'm going to come
[50:17] knock on your door. I'm probably going
[50:19] to knock on your door even more often
[50:21] than I do now because I'll remember
[50:24] everybody's names a lot better and I'll
[50:26] be less embarrassed I forgot your name
[50:28] that Sunday.
[50:30] You'll forgive me, but there's there's
[50:31] times where I'm in my own office place.
[50:33] Can we just be real tonight? I'm my own
[50:36] office place. I've been working with
[50:37] these people for 10, 15 years. I'll pass
[50:39] them in in the hallway and be like,
[50:40] "Good morning." No, I'm not going to say
[50:42] good morning to them because I'm not
[50:43] getting the name recalled. About 5
[50:45] seconds later, I remember their name.
[50:49] Been working with them for 15 years.
[50:53] We all got our little hang-ups, don't
[50:55] we?
[50:57] But we have to get over our own
[50:58] hang-ups. And that's something that I'm
[51:00] striving for is that I want to get over
[51:03] my hang-ups so that I can fulfill this
[51:06] new commandment. When Christ said, "A
[51:08] new commandment I give unto you," my
[51:10] ears perk up because that wasn't only
[51:12] the new commandment. That was the last
[51:14] commandment before his death.
[51:17] as the man Christ Jesus and the the the
[51:20] God
[51:23] speaks right there. He's speaking from
[51:24] his heart, but he's also speaking from
[51:26] divinity and saying, "This isn't just
[51:28] what I want from you as a as your
[51:30] brother, but I'm also speaking as your
[51:32] God. This is a commandment to love one
[51:34] another."
[51:38] So, be careful tonight. Be careful of
[51:40] what is so much becoming an
[51:43] individualized gospel
[51:45] with tape churches
[51:49] and online services
[51:52] and something that divorces from you the
[51:55] need to show up to a church building and
[51:57] be part of the church community.
[52:01] Paul spoke not without authority when he
[52:04] said, "Let us not forsake the assembling
[52:08] of ourselves together, so much the more
[52:11] as the day approaches." And he said it
[52:14] this way, "Let us not forsake the
[52:15] assembling of ourselves together as the
[52:18] manner of some is," which means he
[52:22] recognized that there's some people that
[52:24] just that's their manner. They would
[52:26] love to forsake the assembling of
[52:28] themselves together. Some people loved
[52:31] COVID. They loved having the excuse of
[52:34] not assembling myself together anymore.
[52:36] And it might be complexes, but let's say
[52:39] it's not complexes. Let's just say it's
[52:40] personality. That's fine. I know people
[52:44] like that and I love them and they can't
[52:46] get rid of me
[52:49] and I'm not going to get rid of them.
[52:52] But we're still commanded
[52:55] to love one another. And you can't do
[52:58] that from a distance very well.
[53:01] You can if there's distance there, you
[53:03] can overcome it. But you've got to
[53:05] overcome whatever is separating you from
[53:08] one another.
[53:09] If that's distance, if that's
[53:11] opportunity,
[53:13] if that's your own hang-ups, if that's
[53:16] past and grieviances
[53:19] and sin and things that they did wrong
[53:22] against you, remember Jesus washing
[53:24] Judas's dirty feet. He says, "If I've
[53:28] done it unto you, then ought not you do
[53:31] it to one another."
[53:38] So community,
[53:40] Christ made it very clear to me in the
[53:44] very opening lines of his first ever
[53:47] communion service that the church was to
[53:50] be built upon community.
[53:54] It's amazing to me that John, you know,
[53:57] faith, hope, and love, John,
[54:01] the beloved of the Lord, made it so
[54:03] important that he actually discarded.
[54:06] He's like, I'm going to let Matthew,
[54:09] Mark, and Luke take care of the other
[54:10] ordinances of communion, and I'm just
[54:12] going to focus here on footwashing and a
[54:14] new commandment.
[54:17] And the rest of the sermon of Christ is
[54:19] Thomas sharing his doubts and Christ con
[54:22] consoling them and saying that I'll be
[54:24] with you and all the many promises we
[54:26] have about the Holy Ghost. And then
[54:28] finally in chapter 17 is the high
[54:29] priestly prayer where he talks about us
[54:31] becoming one with one another and with
[54:34] him and the Lord and with the father.
[54:37] And it's it's it's a marvelous thing.
[54:40] But this first opening chapter,
[54:43] Christ makes it very clear that he wants
[54:45] his church to be built upon a community.
[54:50] Have you ever stopped to think about
[54:52] what the first Christian church must
[54:54] have looked like after the day of
[54:55] Pentecost?
[54:56] And after
[54:59] those two apostles said, "Silver and
[55:01] gold have I none, but be it unto you,
[55:03] but but such as I have, I give it unto
[55:05] you in the name of the Lord." And 5,000
[55:08] people were converted in a day when they
[55:10] saw that ly man jumping around Solomon's
[55:12] porch. That was a pretty big church by
[55:15] that point. 3,000 converted, 5,000,
[55:19] probably some in between, some of them
[55:21] were from outside the gates on the
[55:22] midday of Pentecost, sure, but there was
[55:24] a large core group and there was no
[55:26] building that could hold them all. So,
[55:29] they went from house to house.
[55:31] I wonder how long it's been since you
[55:33] invited someone into your house or you
[55:36] went from house to house.
[55:42] I don't say that as a reproach because
[55:44] there's many here that do that. But I
[55:47] say it as a reminder because there's
[55:49] some that have forgotten about it or
[55:52] we've let it slack off a little bit.
[55:56] So if community was so important
[56:00] and again that word community means
[56:01] together and service,
[56:04] I'd like to just spend a moment before
[56:06] we close tonight to look at things that
[56:08] I find prevent community in a church.
[56:12] The first thing that I find that
[56:14] prevents community is an attitude of
[56:17] individualism.
[56:19] We've talked about an individual gospel
[56:21] or an individual relationship with Jesus
[56:23] Christ to the exclusion of all else. But
[56:26] be careful about that because
[56:30] be careful that it's not just you
[56:32] focusing on the Lord because there's
[56:33] times when yes, you're drawn into a very
[56:36] close relationship with the Lord where
[56:37] it's just bride and bridegroom face to
[56:40] face and we all go through seasons of
[56:42] life like that and we should sustain
[56:45] that kind of relationship with the Lord.
[56:47] But there are seasons when it's to the
[56:49] exclusion of everything else. But I
[56:51] don't believe that should be the regular
[56:54] or the normal Christian life throughout
[56:56] our days. There has to come a time when
[56:59] we're able to open ourselves enough and
[57:02] say, "I'm going to fulfill in my life
[57:04] the new commandment. If I'm going to
[57:06] love the Lord face to face,
[57:08] I've also got to love not only his face
[57:10] but his body."
[57:13] So be careful that individualism that
[57:16] rises up and says, "Well, I just don't
[57:18] have time for this. My current
[57:20] situation, my current season of life, my
[57:23] my my and all these excuses, I wonder if
[57:27] it starts to sound the ears of the Lord
[57:29] kind of like those folks he invited to
[57:31] the wedding feast." He says, "Look, I'm
[57:34] celebrating a union between my son and
[57:38] his bride. come and celebrate that union
[57:41] with me. And is that not something that
[57:44] we're doing every time we gather
[57:46] faithfully in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:47] Christ? We're celebrating this union of
[57:50] the body of Jesus Christ. But there were
[57:53] some that said, "I bought land. I've
[57:56] bought an ox. I I I."
[58:03] But Christ calls us to a life of
[58:05] selflessness.
[58:07] But you don't understand, brother
[58:09] Josiah. It's not just me, but it's my
[58:12] family. We have events and we have
[58:14] schedules and my family's very needy and
[58:17] my children's time of life. And my my
[58:20] my,
[58:22] it's still this
[58:24] this world that's been boxed in to be
[58:26] smaller than God ever intended it to be.
[58:30] Whether it's my life or my family or my
[58:35] tribe, my little click, my group of
[58:38] people that I'm comfortable with, even
[58:39] my church,
[58:41] my people. We see that Peter accosted
[58:45] Paul to his face one day about Peter's
[58:48] own tribalism. How many remember the
[58:51] story?
[58:54] Peter's there and Paul's there and
[58:56] they're sitting down at the table with
[58:58] the Gentiles and they're about to have a
[59:00] nice meal and the Jews come into town.
[59:03] Peter says, "Excuse me, brothers.
[59:07] I've got to go fellowship with these
[59:08] guys over here." As they all congregate
[59:10] to a whole separate table all by
[59:12] themselves. And he leaves them over
[59:14] here. And he goes and joins himself to
[59:16] his tribe.
[59:19] And Paul calls him out for it.
[59:24] And I wonder if you would let the Holy
[59:26] Spirit call you out for it tonight if
[59:29] you're guilty like Peter.
[59:33] Not to be tribalistic, but to look for
[59:36] needs that are in the body.
[59:39] When the body ministers to the body,
[59:42] I don't massage the palm of my hand that
[59:45] feels really bad with my other hand and
[59:48] just do this just for the fun of it. I'm
[59:51] doing it because the other hand's cold.
[59:54] That's in winter time. In summertime,
[59:57] it's not cold outside. I don't need to
[59:59] rub my hands together. Summertime, I've
[1:00:02] been working outside. I've got a
[1:00:03] backachche.
[1:00:05] I'm going to start ministering to other
[1:00:07] parts of my body that are needy.
[1:00:10] Tribalism keeps us from doing that.
[1:00:13] Individualism keeps us from looking for
[1:00:15] needs within the body.
[1:00:20] You might say, "Well, another body
[1:00:22] member can do that." Really? Because you
[1:00:25] might just have the exact requirement
[1:00:29] to minister that need.
[1:00:34] My knee, my knee doesn't scratch my back
[1:00:37] too well.
[1:00:40] You wouldn't want to see me try.
[1:00:44] I'd have to be pretty flexible to even
[1:00:45] try.
[1:00:47] my hand does that a lot better.
[1:00:51] And Paul says when he's talking about
[1:00:52] the body, he says, "Sure, there might be
[1:00:55] those that are in the body that seem to
[1:00:57] be more feeble than others, but they're
[1:00:59] necessary.
[1:01:01] And there's certain little things, this
[1:01:03] little this little this little finger
[1:01:05] right here,
[1:01:07] he's the weakest little guy.
[1:01:10] But I'll tell you what, when my ear is
[1:01:12] filled with wax,
[1:01:15] there's no other part of my body that's
[1:01:17] a better minister to my ear.
[1:01:22] So just remember friends, you might seem
[1:01:24] to even think of yourself as the most
[1:01:26] feeble, but if you keep your eyes open,
[1:01:29] you're needed in this body.
[1:01:32] So I want to admonish you that wherever
[1:01:34] you go, look for that opportunity to
[1:01:37] either serve with someone or to serve
[1:01:40] with someone else or to serve somebody
[1:01:42] else. You know, uh Brandon and I were
[1:01:45] talking in the back room and we were
[1:01:47] recollecting our days in the youth
[1:01:49] group. We were remembering how when
[1:01:51] brother Bill Chandler were was with us
[1:01:53] and sister Phyllis and they got their
[1:01:56] their backyard filled with leaves and
[1:02:00] they couldn't take all those leaves out
[1:02:02] by themselves. And I don't even remember
[1:02:05] who all was with me at the time. I just
[1:02:06] remember doing it. I I I didn't have to
[1:02:09] know someone's name. I didn't have to
[1:02:11] remember it that day. I didn't have to
[1:02:13] know their whole life story. I didn't
[1:02:15] have to I didn't I didn't have to be a
[1:02:17] very good conversationalist that day.
[1:02:19] And neither did anybody else. No one
[1:02:21] stood out to me as being awkward that
[1:02:23] day. They all just got together in the
[1:02:25] leaves and we had a good time serving
[1:02:28] someone that couldn't serve themselves
[1:02:30] that day.
[1:02:32] And that's what we need more of in the
[1:02:34] church. Now, take you can take that take
[1:02:37] that as spiritual as you want it. You
[1:02:39] can you can you can bring that up to
[1:02:40] date with body. You can bring that up to
[1:02:42] date with with with visiting the sick in
[1:02:44] the hospital. But James said this and
[1:02:47] and speaking of practical religion,
[1:02:49] James said, "Pure religion and undefiled
[1:02:52] before God the Father is this that you
[1:02:55] would visit the orphaned and the widows
[1:02:57] in the affliction and that you keep
[1:02:59] yourself unspotted from the world. Don't
[1:03:02] keep yourself so unspotted from the
[1:03:04] world is to the exclusion of everything
[1:03:05] else. I'm just focusing on having a
[1:03:08] sanctified life. I'm just focusing on
[1:03:09] being a good Christian." But we leave
[1:03:11] off James's first part that says, "Visit
[1:03:14] the fatherless. Visit the orphan. Find
[1:03:17] yourself, put yourself in a position
[1:03:19] that you can give them what Solomon
[1:03:21] said, is that word in due season." It's
[1:03:25] like apples of gold painted in pictures
[1:03:28] of silver.
[1:03:30] Let yourself become that kind of person.
[1:03:33] So, I've never been very eloquent in my
[1:03:34] life. You don't have to have eloquence,
[1:03:36] friend.
[1:03:38] Seasons and circumstances give the
[1:03:41] honest and pure heart its eloquence.
[1:03:45] A word fitly spoken in due season. Not
[1:03:48] eloquently se spoken but fitly. You find
[1:03:52] their need and you fit your words into
[1:03:55] that heart and saying look I see your
[1:03:58] need in this season. Let me minister to
[1:04:00] you.
[1:04:05] Look for that opportunity to serve and
[1:04:08] community will happen by definition
[1:04:11] because it's together and service. I've
[1:04:13] heard of people complaining and saying,
[1:04:15] "Well, I I I don't have very many
[1:04:17] friends in a church or I I just can't
[1:04:20] seem to make friends." But be careful
[1:04:22] that you're not focusing so much on
[1:04:25] relationship that you're forgetting
[1:04:27] service.
[1:04:29] Because I'll guarantee you that if you
[1:04:30] focus on serving with others like we did
[1:04:33] that day with brother Bill Channer and
[1:04:36] serving others,
[1:04:39] well, the right kind of friends will
[1:04:40] just present themselves.
[1:04:45] And before we leave that,
[1:04:49] allow yourself to be ministered to.
[1:04:52] Don't get so much on your high horse
[1:04:54] that says, "All right, I'm going to be
[1:04:57] I'm going to be the top dog person
[1:04:58] around here. No one's going to serve
[1:05:00] more." It's kind of like Peter, you
[1:05:02] know, Lord, don't don't wash my feet
[1:05:04] only, but wash my hands and my head.
[1:05:06] Lord, I'll never leave you. I'll never
[1:05:07] forsake you. He was always 110% in.
[1:05:13] But don't forget the other part
[1:05:16] because it takes two to wash the feet,
[1:05:19] right?
[1:05:20] And there's some reciprocosity,
[1:05:23] something that happens when you let
[1:05:24] someone give back to you after you've
[1:05:26] given to them. And it fulfills a need
[1:05:29] both in you because they're ministering
[1:05:30] to you. But don't forget that it
[1:05:33] fulfills a need in them. You might say,
[1:05:35] "No, that's not true. I'm I'm so low
[1:05:39] people wouldn't need to serve me."
[1:05:44] But just remember what it feels like to
[1:05:46] serve somebody else and what that does
[1:05:49] for you. it it it gives you the
[1:05:50] opportunity to practice pure religion.
[1:05:54] Let someone else have that opportunity
[1:05:56] with you.
[1:05:59] And don't ever be so proudful that you
[1:06:00] think, "Well, I just don't need service.
[1:06:03] I don't need to be served." I remember
[1:06:05] when I was a young man, I'm just I'm
[1:06:08] letting it all out tonight, I guess. But
[1:06:10] I when I was a young man, first
[1:06:12] contemplating that perhaps the Lord
[1:06:14] might have a a call upon my life such as
[1:06:17] it is to preach the gospel. And I
[1:06:19] imagined myself and you have grace for
[1:06:21] me because I was probably 17 at the
[1:06:22] time. But um I was thinking, wow, I'll
[1:06:26] I'll preach the doors off one day and
[1:06:30] I'll get out there and people be patting
[1:06:32] my my back and I'm going to resolve
[1:06:34] right now. I thought I was doing a
[1:06:35] spiritual thing. I'm going to resolve
[1:06:36] right now to be humble. I'll just kind
[1:06:38] of shrug them off and say, "No, no, it's
[1:06:40] okay. It's okay. It's okay." First of
[1:06:42] all, that wasn't very humble. I found
[1:06:44] out there's very few times I get to
[1:06:45] preach the doors off a church. I'm more
[1:06:48] more more interested in whether or not
[1:06:50] doors are being opened in people's
[1:06:52] hearts.
[1:06:54] But
[1:06:55] also that idea of shrugging off people's
[1:06:58] compliments, shrugging off people's
[1:07:00] praise. I was trying to deny my own
[1:07:03] humanity and rising myself up on some
[1:07:05] kind of a high horse that says, "No, I I
[1:07:08] don't need people's compliments. I don't
[1:07:10] need people's encouragements. I don't
[1:07:13] need people's dot dot dot. I don't need
[1:07:16] people is really where that ends at. So
[1:07:19] be careful of that.
[1:07:22] Then be careful. Be careful of pride.
[1:07:27] We're talking now about things that
[1:07:29] prevent community in a church. I don't
[1:07:30] know anything else that prevents it like
[1:07:32] pride does. That evil counselor of pride
[1:07:35] will come in and counsel you based upon
[1:07:38] your past and make you looking through
[1:07:40] the glasses of the past like a like an
[1:07:42] old frog looking in the rear. and makes
[1:07:45] say, "Well, somebody did me this way and
[1:07:48] somebody did did me that way and so when
[1:07:49] I meet this person over there, they
[1:07:51] remind me of of my past and I I know
[1:07:53] what they're going to be like. So, I'm
[1:07:55] just going to dance around this part of
[1:07:56] the body and I'm going to avoid that
[1:07:58] part of the body because that part of
[1:07:59] the body might hurt me or that part of
[1:08:01] the body's already told me that they
[1:08:03] don't need me because of what this other
[1:08:04] person over here did to me years ago."
[1:08:07] And what is that but anything but pride?
[1:08:11] We might call it complexes. We might
[1:08:13] call a lot of things, but one thing it
[1:08:16] is is pride counseling you to say that
[1:08:18] you can judge a book by its cover. That
[1:08:21] you have you have the authority to be
[1:08:23] able to judge someone else without even
[1:08:26] knowing them. Right?
[1:08:28] Self-righteousness, pride of
[1:08:29] self-righteousness will come in and
[1:08:31] counsel us to come in and try to be a
[1:08:35] minister without first asking, "Do I
[1:08:38] need to be ministered to?"
[1:08:42] And that's so many times a mistake to
[1:08:44] try to teach someone before you learn
[1:08:47] whether they can teach you something.
[1:08:50] I'm going to make friends with this
[1:08:51] person. I think they need my friendship.
[1:08:54] Be careful.
[1:08:56] That's the wrong side of the coin to be
[1:08:58] on. How about you start off, you know
[1:09:02] what a neutral ground is? instead of
[1:09:04] worrying about whether they're going to
[1:09:05] serve you or you serve them, the neutral
[1:09:07] ground will be just let's serve
[1:09:08] together. Let's let's step in shoulder
[1:09:11] tosh shoulder. And then as as you walk
[1:09:14] along life's journey shouldertosh
[1:09:15] shoulder, that serving one another is
[1:09:18] going to happen naturally.
[1:09:21] So finally,
[1:09:23] I like to say just do the opposite as
[1:09:26] brother Barham counsel us.
[1:09:29] Do the opposite of pride. Do the
[1:09:31] opposite of individualism. do the
[1:09:33] opposite of a lack of service.
[1:09:38] Christ said this in Matthew 20. He said,
[1:09:40] "It shall not be so among you, but
[1:09:41] whosoever shall be great among you, let
[1:09:43] him be your minister, and whosoever
[1:09:46] shall be chief among you, let him be
[1:09:48] your servant, even as the son of man
[1:09:50] came not to be ministered unto, but to
[1:09:52] minister and to give his life a ransom
[1:09:54] for many." And I think that footwashing
[1:09:57] so beautifully shows that because
[1:09:59] footwashing shows humility. the humility
[1:10:02] both of serving someone and letting
[1:10:04] someone else serve you. It shows that
[1:10:08] service and it's also a symbol of
[1:10:11] redemption and washing away each other's
[1:10:14] filthiness.
[1:10:17] If the musicians would come,
[1:10:21] we can stand.
[1:10:31] In a week and a half from now,
[1:10:34] we'll all be having a chance to get down
[1:10:36] and wash one another's feet. I hope to
[1:10:38] see you all there. I hope that you'll
[1:10:41] come out for the communion service. I
[1:10:43] hope you'll make that sacrifice.
[1:10:45] But before we even get there, I'd like
[1:10:48] to leave you with a different kind of
[1:10:49] hope.
[1:10:51] I hope that you'll take this little
[1:10:52] admonition tonight as I'm trying to grow
[1:10:56] it in my own heart and say, "Let's look
[1:10:59] for ways that I can honor the symbol
[1:11:03] that when I come to the symbol itself in
[1:11:06] a week and a half, I can be sure that
[1:11:08] I'm not profaining it."
[1:11:11] Many times we'll prepare our hearts
[1:11:13] ahead of the wine. We'll prepare our
[1:11:16] hearts ahead of the breaking of the
[1:11:17] bread because we know that we don't want
[1:11:20] to profane the symbol of it.
[1:11:24] But be sure that you're not profaining
[1:11:27] the symbol of footwashing, that your
[1:11:30] life is worthy of the gospel and this
[1:11:33] part that communicates a new
[1:11:35] commandment.
[1:11:37] I want to challenge you tonight.
[1:11:40] I want to challenge you to look for
[1:11:41] opportunities in the next week and a
[1:11:42] half
[1:11:45] to expand your community
[1:11:49] to reach out beyond your tribe, my
[1:11:51] family, my group, my regular people I
[1:11:54] talk to and look around and try to find
[1:11:56] some needs. It might be in this church.
[1:11:58] It might be in the larger community. But
[1:12:00] let yourself be one of those that says,
[1:12:02] "I'm looking for some feet to wash." And
[1:12:04] I want to challenge you to find some
[1:12:06] feet to wash figuratively before we come
[1:12:09] to wash them in a week and a half from
[1:12:11] now. Literally,
[1:12:13] will you do that with me? Let's go
[1:12:15] before the Lord.
[1:12:18] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:12:22] I love these people.
[1:12:25] I'm so glad that I'm with a group of
[1:12:27] people, Lord,
[1:12:30] that do these things I'm speaking of,
[1:12:33] Lord.
[1:12:35] Lord, I'm I can come and bring a service
[1:12:37] like this and it's it's not a word of
[1:12:39] rebuke, Lord, but it's a word of
[1:12:41] encouragement and reminder.
[1:12:44] And sometimes I think that after co
[1:12:47] Lord, we need the these reminders more
[1:12:49] often because our society took a certain
[1:12:52] trajectory, Lord. It was already on it,
[1:12:55] but it seemed like it took a harder turn
[1:12:59] than it did before.
[1:13:01] We've got a lot of wars and rumors of
[1:13:03] wars even with our in our own American
[1:13:05] society. But let that not be so among
[1:13:08] us.
[1:13:09] May our actions and our hearts tend the
[1:13:13] more
[1:13:15] toward loving one another
[1:13:17] and to continuously Lord build upon that
[1:13:20] love with acts of service. So much the
[1:13:22] more as that day approaches. Grant that
[1:13:25] dear Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:13:31] I am love.
[1:13:33] You are love.
[1:13:36] I can risk
[1:13:38] loving you.
[1:13:42] For the one who know loves me best
[1:13:48] loves me most.
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:54] I am love.
[1:13:57] You are love.
[1:13:59] Won't you please
[1:14:02] take my hand?
[1:14:05] We are free to love each other.
[1:14:11] We are love.
[1:14:15] I am love. Oh, I am love.
[1:14:20] I am love.
[1:14:23] I can risk loving you.
[1:14:29] For the one who knows me best
[1:14:35] loves me most.
[1:14:40] Oh, I am love.
[1:14:43] You are love.
[1:14:46] Won't you please take my hand?
[1:14:52] We are free to love each other.
[1:14:58] We are love.
[1:15:04] I said
[1:15:06] if you knew, you wouldn't want me.
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:14] My scars are hidden by the face I wear.
[1:15:21] [Applause]
[1:15:25] But he said,
[1:15:27] "My child, my scars go deeper."
[1:15:33] Thank you, Lord. It was love
[1:15:38] for you that put them there.
[1:15:45] Thank the Lord. Oh, I am love.
[1:15:49] I am love.
[1:15:52] I can risk loving you.
[1:15:57] For the one who knows me best
[1:16:02] loves me most.
[1:16:08] I am love.
[1:16:11] You are love.
[1:16:13] Won't you please take my hand? We are
[1:16:19] free to love each other.
[1:16:24] We are love.
[1:16:26] Thank you, Lord. Forgiven.
[1:16:29] Oh, forgiven.
[1:16:32] I repeat,
[1:16:34] unforgiven
[1:16:39] and clean.
[1:16:42] Before my Lord, I freely stand.
[1:16:49] Oh,
[1:16:51] forgiven.
[1:16:53] I can dare forive my brother. Thank you,
[1:16:58] Lord. Oh,
[1:17:01] forgiven.
[1:17:03] I reach out to take a hand.
[1:17:09] Oh,
[1:17:11] I am love.
[1:17:13] I am love.
[1:17:16] I can risk loing you.
[1:17:21] For the one who knows me best,
[1:17:26] loves me most.
[1:17:31] I am love.
[1:17:34] You are love.
[1:17:37] Won't you please take my hand?
[1:17:42] We are free to love each other.
[1:17:47] We are loved.
[1:17:50] Praise the Lord. Amen. What a challenge
[1:17:54] tonight. Amen. It's so easy in this day
[1:17:57] and age just to isolate yourself and and
[1:18:00] know what a challenge for me. I thank
[1:18:01] you, brother, for just uh the correction
[1:18:04] tonight. Amen. And it was subtle because
[1:18:06] these things can get kind of blown over
[1:18:08] a lot of the times, but um but the Lord
[1:18:12] definitely brought some correction. And
[1:18:14] one thing I was thinking about a few
[1:18:15] weeks ago was we talk about red red
[1:18:19] blood cells and the blood of Christ, but
[1:18:22] we often forget that God created white
[1:18:24] blood cells, too. White blood cells have
[1:18:27] an act. you know, they're they're
[1:18:29] dormant and they're kind of floating
[1:18:31] around until something happens and
[1:18:34] something happens, you know, where you
[1:18:36] have an infection or the flu and your
[1:18:38] whole body the whole body actually like
[1:18:43] loses loses something to to take care of
[1:18:46] what's going on on the infection, right?
[1:18:49] So I was just uh blown away by that that
[1:18:52] blood of Christ, you know, the blood of,
[1:18:54] you know, blood of the lamb. There's
[1:18:56] still white blood cells that is still
[1:18:58] working amongst us. Amen. So it's just
[1:19:01] encouraging tonight, the white blood
[1:19:03] cells. So um but let's uh tonight just
[1:19:08] uh go and greet each other and just uh
[1:19:10] say a word of encouragement. God bless
[1:19:12] you tonight as we go. We'll sing that
[1:19:14] all around.
[1:19:17] All around.
[1:19:19] Everywhere I look, your love is all. You
[1:19:21] can go in the name of the Lord tonight.
