========================================

says thank you musicians appreciate that very much and let me see if we have a live feed sister Genie's on it let's read the scripture together um oh I'll need my glasses for this that's why I use a computer I can make the font any size they should make baubles that you can just expand the text Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear I lost the law to Eddie's blessing to the word let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we commit this time to you Lord we thank you for all the prayers that have gone forth Lord we thank you for the the saints that have gathered both here and online Lord we just know that uh there's a hunger and a thirst Lord for you and because of that because we hunger and thirst we know that there is a righteousness to fill us there is a God who wants to provide for those needs that we have and so Lord we we commit this time to you we pray Lord that you would bless everything that is said and done Lord we ask it all in Jesus name amen you may be seated oh what happened oh let's get it up here how's that was it let's just do it up here um just um it's the it's this one and then choose whichever nope it's the screamer that's it and use a separate display that's perfect um black magic nope oh me uh unplug this and plug it in again usually it just works yeah I've heard folks if you don't mind well uh our expert is doing the expert thing I will just continue um when we get the slides up I would like to read this from the from the Amplified these first three verses and you'll think you'll find that there's some really significant um uh in edit added Insight um from uh from the Amplified I'm not a big fan of new translations I'll be honest um they uh they're a bit hit and miss which isn't something you really want with the word of God you would rather have something that was reliable that you could put your your faith and trust in but what I wanted to say briefly before we get started on this is that faith is a substance and I think a lot of times we think of Faith as something that's nebulous what I mean by that is something that's not tangible something that's not Material it's not perhaps a real but you know the reality of Our Lives is that we're living at the very lowest level of spirituality down here in three dimensions or four dimensions the real uh the real world if I can put it that way is in higher dimensions and so we are are not um looking for something that we can see in this world but there is something we can see in another dimension there's a dimension to Faith that we sometimes miss a little bit and a lot of it is very practical very down to earth and one of the things that I have missed a little bit when well when I say I missed I've been disappointed when I've talked to somebody and they say well um you know I don't need to see or know anything um I just need to believe but you see that's uh that's a little bit of a cop-out I think is to say that faith is something that isn't real it faith is real and and faith is a very very real substance and that's what Paul's saying it's it may not be the substance that we think of it may not be the you know the physical tangible world that we see feel and touch but um I think uh and there's some other um senses in there but that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about uh Faith being the substance of things hoped for the the reality of things that we're expecting so hoping is in the next Dimension let me let me uh spend a few minutes on that while we're working on this you remember there's three things that we know love is the most important but there's Faith and Hope and you know the three Epistles in the New Testament Peter James and John Peter was Faith uh you remember that uh he he uh he was uh and let's see uh if I can remember sir Peter Faith James was um yes Hope and John was was love so you've got those three uh things that we hold to very very precious in our Christian walk faith hope and love and then of course we know the greatest of these is love but that doesn't diminish the other tube in any way shape or form and so faith is one of those fundamental substances and hope if I can admit that means help help let me give give you this picture faith is what we get from the word of God what we get from our experience what we get from other people's experience especially those in the scripture we we look to that for Faith so when brother branham's preaching Faith he's he's turning to examples and saying you know I did this and this happened and God did this and this is where he prayed and God healed this person and and so that builds up Faith because that's based on things that have happened that's important to realize that when it says substance these aren't things that we're making up this isn't make believe this isn't something that is somewhere out there this is stuff that's really happened it's substance and maybe the English word is stuff this is real stuff but it's in a little bit of a different dimension so that's faith now hope is something way off in the future right the the hope of his coming that we we think of Hope as being future tense all right and nothing wrong with that that's absolutely right that's why the scripture has it so what holds those two things together what holds our faith in the past together with our hope in the future it's love so when Jesus said it's the way the truth and the life all right so Jesus is saying the way you live your life the truth with which you live your life right that's all held together by love that's the the life that we live so it doesn't help to have the truth and doesn't help to know the way if you don't have the Life of Christ see it's the way the truth and the life so these things work together in this way and and that's what um kind of sets the the background for my uh topic that we may get to tonight um the the slides are quite important unfortunately for me but um how about if you just take a thumb drive and plug it in and we could always do that yeah okay all right are you guys patient I wanted somebody to say no [Music] all right and I don't even know where I'm going um yeah I know it's here but I don't know which one oh there we go literal life that makes sense all right there it is right there um it is but it's no Wireless so oh oh good fix it Mr Fix It um folk does that does that make sense we're tracking along here so in verse 3 when he says through faith now if it wasn't something real how could it be the the path or the or the the the way it's the it he says um through faith we understand that the worlds were formed by the word of God so that things which are seen were made not made by things which do appear so he's saying there are things which are seen all right but seeing how about things that do not appear that's interesting so this is uh definitely that concept of a another dimension uh and um I just wanted to mention this while I'm on the subject of other dimensions uh you know when we talk about coming up higher and and um Faith obviously is something that grows it's a process remember that scripture from Faith to Faith and so we have faith and to every man has given the measure of Faith but then it's a process whereby that faith gets built like a muscle the more we use it the better it gets and and the stronger it gets but when we say higher and we think back to First John I mean John uh John talking in Revelation chapter four verse one it says he heard the voice saying come up here that come up higher you know we uh live in three dimensions and so we think higher is that way you know so if brother Gideon started um levitating right and and he went higher and higher we'd say wow that's really spiritual but maybe it isn't yes but okay sure so um what higher means in scripture is a higher dimension and brother Brenham says that's a faster Dimension it's something that you know we can't see with our natural eye but of course he had many examples and many people have had examples of seeing visions dream things that are happening in another dimension and and I think it's important that we think of faith is the substance of things from Another Dimension from a higher Dimension because we're called to go up higher we're called to be in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus we're called to be come up higher there's an open door there's further Revelation that God wants for us to have and that's exactly what um what higher means in the Scripture it does not mean that we we get up on a platform or we get up on a chair or whatever um brother um Wesley did that one day when we're singing a song he got up on his chair because he wanted to get up higher I think so no so when we talk about faith we're talking about something that comes from another dimension that's actually it comes from another dimension it's revealed in another dimension and our job is to enter into that dimension and how can we do this let you this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus that faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God so the words that I speak to you Jesus said they are spurred in their life so you can see that whenever this topic of faith comes along and when we're trying to build ourselves spiritually we're talking about working at a higher level at a higher plane and that's why the pull of the world is so detrimental to us because it keeps us down literally and figuratively so I want you to think of the catching away of the church for a minute so the catching away of the church that's not flying up into the sky although that's the picture that God used When Jesus ascended into heaven he was caught up in the clouds the clouds not white fluffy clouds the clouds of witnesses all right that they without us should not be made perfect so he was caught up so that was what they saw but what was really happening is Jesus was entering into that other dimension and they were seeing that in a very similar way that you remember Elisha's servant remember when he said there's more for us then before then then be for them and he said open his eyes Lord and you know whenever I sing that song I always think of open my eyes Lord and that doesn't mean so that I can see brother Dana better all right you understand why I wouldn't want to see Brothers I apologize brother then he got broad shoulders so no it's not that it's that I want to see the way Jesus sees I want to open my eyes opened the way he did when he opened that one Blind Man's eyes do you recall that it's a really interesting story where he prayed for him and he said I see men walking like trees now we know from Psalms that trees can represent uh people you know men that we would be like trees planted by rivers of Living Water so trees can represent the spiritual side of a person because remember the the organisms that live the longest on Earth are trees all right those are those huge uh cedar trees and and redwoods and so forth that live for you know thousand years and so forth these are things that represent what we should be doing we should be living for that period of time so when he said I see men walking like trees I think I'm not saying this is exactly right but it's what I think about it is that it's like his eyes were open to the spiritual realm that he saw he saw like you know brother Brennan would describe it as misty out there or he would see I see you over there and doing this and he's not seeing that individual but he's seeing in a spiritual realm and so it seems that's what uh that that man saw he saw in the spiritual realm and Jesus said okay we need to bring your vision down a level or two and uh and now you know he his assat was restored as it would normally um I just want to check with our folk up uh up in the balcony um if I move here does that move it over here or do you have to follow oh wonderful praise God brother Ike and his amazing team so folk um we're gonna get started now 7 43 attempt to start slowing down but um we'll see how far we get uh brother Paul did mention um uh Sunday so we'll see how far we get I won't keep you too long I know it's Wednesday night thank you brother um blame brother Carl so we we're talking about um Valley principles um uh for the service and next service we're talking about principles for for living life in the valley and this particular version or the edition if you like is faithful life in the valley so we're going to spend quite a bit of time on this not talking about faith exactly but talking about What Faith Can Do for us so the question is what is Faith so Paul answers this I'm going to read this in the Amplified now Faith is the Assurance So when you say substance you know we we uh we get a bit stumbled because we think well it's not physical it's not reality but really what that word is is an assurance or a confirmation that we have something a title deed we have we own something something's in our name and we have faith and God has given us that faith and so our our experience with God is based on this Faith oh and it's of the things we hope for so we can't hope for something that doesn't exist does that make sense you know if there's something that doesn't exist um go ahead help me to try and hope for that it would be impossible right because we have nothing in our minds that can do that so we can't hope for something that doesn't exist it has to exist somewhere and then it's being the proof of things we do not see so now that's really interesting so there is evidence of things that we don't see and yet we have evidence for it I think this is I hope we are not spending too much time on this but I just wanted to kind of nail this down that we're not talking about something that isn't real faith is very real and then it says that think proof of things we do not see and the conviction of their reality so it is real it's more real brother Reynolds says than anything that you can see around you that that's the real world that um we're we're living in we're not we're not accustomed to being in touch with that world but every now and then that world will touch us and we we thank God for that whether it's an anointing whether it's a healing whether it's a miracle whether it's just saying the right thing at the right time to the right person all of that is being done because God has dropped his finger down into our world he's brought his world in touchdown in our world so sometimes we can't come up higher but praise God he can come down lower and remember that's what he did he made himself a little lower than the Angels so he came down to our level and that was the song that God brother brother um Josiah up in his chair that we don't want to get down to the devil's level we want to be higher than that but gravity is real now I want to tell you something about gravity so in the same way that gravity is holding me here all right so when I sing I'll Fly Away all right I'm imagining that somehow gravity is going to lose its pull on me but it's not really that it's that gravity is based on mass it's based on having something an object to hold but when I have a new body and I am redeemed that flesh is redeemed and now I have this different state of being now gravity has no hold on me why is that important why was it important that Abraham and Sarah were changed to young people they got new bodies as an illustration that when we get to that level when we're at that point where God has revealed himself to us so much so that we can find that Redemption of the body and gravity no longer has a hold on us guess what also doesn't have a hold on us sin because you remember Sinners that the world right that's where we think of sinners in the world well what has the the world is where gravity is so you see how this is all tied together that we don't want something that we we think is is is not real it has to be real and it has to be as real to us as gravity now it can there's some clever folk here and I don't know if anybody's ever tried to explain what gravity is yeah we we use these words it's very interesting and faith is a little bit like that word gravity we can talk about it we can experience it we can believe it but we have no idea what it is so I was in a in a in a tournament office in South Africa very well-known uh astronomer David block and uh I looked on his bookshelf and he had a book and it was a big black book and it just had one word down the spine gravity it was this thick three inches thick a big eight eight and a half by eleven size book one word down it I said gravity and I said well I said uh Professor I said is that um is that how we understand gravity he goes no he says that's just explaining what gravity does and how it works but we have no idea what it is and that's still true today that was 30 years ago it's still true today we don't know what gravity is so when you think of Faith think a little bit of gravity so what's holding us down we don't have any trouble getting up out of our seat you know walking around we don't expect to just go you know and do an Enoch you know and just sort of walk into another dimension we expect to be you know on terra firma and that's uh that's exactly the same approach we should have to Faith it's as real as gravity I trusted I put every day I step on it I walk in that path of gravity every day and and I don't have to make an excuse for it I don't have to say well I don't understand gravity therefore I don't believe in it well if you don't believe in gravity you might fall off a building all right so the conviction of their reality all right is Faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses can you see how this is another dimension all right this isn't the topic tonight I just want you to know or maybe it is all right so verse two for by faith that that is trust and holy fervor born of Faith the men of old had Divine testimony born to them and obtained a good report we'll talk a little bit more about the good report and then in verse 5 we didn't read that in the King James because of Faith Enoch was caught up into heaven so that's what made me think of gravity so Enoch's Walking with God he's in that other dimension suddenly gravity has no power over suddenly there's nothing material about him that gravity can hold down and if we have that degree of anointing as we walk and we we start to live by faith and more and more we do it the less the pull of the world can have on us the less effect it can have and the less effect gravity is going to have on us and one day we're gone so he was caught up into heaven so that he did not have a glimpse of death and he was not found because God had translated him for even before he was taken to Heaven he received testimony that he had pleased God so now we're seeing a little bit more about faith so Faith isn't just what can I get from God but it's what can I give to God as I give him my life I give him my all I surrender all as I give to God if as I do the things that that are pleasing to him now we're talking about the kind of faith that Enoch had that he was pleasing to God that his walk and you know we've seen that in brother branham's life right so it's it's that wonderful walk with me a little more you remember that that uh you know that um that uh that time that he had now verse six without faith it is impossible to please him for whoever would come near to God into that other dimension must necessarily oops believe that God exists and that he is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him and now there's another hint in here when we think of the Christian walk um there is a tendency to think that somehow I just have to I hate to say do nothing but that's kind of the way it sounds to me sometimes the way people um talk about it talk about faith is I don't have to do anything God's doing everything so I you know I'm just I'm just along for the ride you know I'm going with the flow and it's absolutely incorrect it's a reward God is a rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek him so we do have a part to play in this and what is that part it's the response it's because of what he did for us I just want to clarify this because sometimes this sounds legalistic let me clarify this when you do something because you have to like I need to do these things otherwise I can't get saved all right that's when you have to do something to get saved to get favor with God whatever I've got to do something that's legalism but what's obedience the same Act the same exact thing you ask your child will you do this and grudgingly gets up off the sofa and drags his or her feet down and eventually you know starts to do something like that you ask them to and that's when I use the phrase delayed obedience is disobedience they couldn't get away with that for long so the idea is that when we're asking somebody to do something and God's asking us as Sons and Daughters of God to do something he's expecting us to do it because we love him not because we don't want to get smacked that's the alternative right but it that's not the reason we do things sometimes people talk about getting saved from hell and yes that's a that's a reality yes we we we're born in sin-shaped iniquity we are going to hell unless we find Salvation in Christ but that's not what God's sent his son to Earth for was not to say not to be a fireman not to save us from hell but to bring us into his kingdom to bring us into right standing with him and so faith is actually the means by which we can earnestly and diligently do something that has some significance I want to give you the example of washing clothes so since Kathy's been a little indisposed I have suddenly learned a whole array of new skills um I'm thinking of hiring myself out um but I noticed that if you just take laundry and you rub it very hard together and you look at it it's just as soiled as it was before you started rubbing so works isn't going to clean the laundry you have to put it in a liquid and preferably with a little soap not forgetting sometimes and so when you put that effort into the right environment the clothes come clean so when we take our lives and we dip ourselves in the blood of Jesus and we dip ourselves in the cleansing power of his word and now we rub ourselves now we do something vigorous something that we believe would be pleasing to God now it has an effect on our life so we're we're really off topic but um praise God for that all right so earnestly and diligently so some of this actually comes up later so first of all people of Faith have an optimistic Outlook and and and that's so important because if you're confessing something please make sure that you're not confessing what the devil is saying he doesn't need any help right you know you don't need to to be reminding yourself of what he's telling you that's that's absolutely not necessary he knows what he's saying and all he wants is for you to line up with what he's saying rather than what God's saying so please have an optimistic outlook on life we can be realistic and optimistic I can assure you but it's interesting that people of Faith carry a deep conviction of who God is and who he has declared himself to be deep inside there's something unshakable in a person of faith and there's something else we have an unshakable confidence in the character of God because before we can believe somebody and take them at their word we have to have confidence in their character so if somebody's not trustworthy if somebody said something and not done it if somebody has said things that are just completely untrue whatever the case is we lose trust in what that person says but in God we know the character of God we see it throughout the scripture he is a man of his word and he is the word and he will reveal that character in us so please we also need to be men and women of our word that's something that sometimes has taken a little bit too likely and the other thing about people of faith and I love this they believe what God says regardless of the circumstances they're not looking at the landscape they're looking at the promise they're not looking at the events that are taking place now they're looking at what does God have in store for me and again I can give you another example you remember when the Israelites came to the bitter Waters of Mara and I love this story I tell it every time and they come there now they're complaining everything's terrible you're gonna die out here in the desert Woe Is Us and God tells Moses cut down that tree and throw it into the water and it'll make the water sweet so who knows how long a tree takes to grow in the desert but it had to be many many decades earlier that God had planted a tree that was going to be right in the path of the Israelites when they needed to have a drink of water now we have a tree that is Christ all right he's the Tree of Life and he's been there a long time before our problem and he's already put that solution in place and he's just waiting for the right time to apply that solution into that circumstance in our life that's why we don't look at circumstances because if we're looking at the circumstances and the bitter Waters we're missing what God has planned and how he's going to perform an incredible miracle and he's going to feed millions of people and he had it all planned long before it ever came around so things and this is how this is a valley principle things can look bad at the moment but in the end it comes out well it's because he does all things well so we looked at this that faith is the Assurance the confirmation if you have Assurance if you have this faith if you have the confirmation you have an optimistic Outlook you carry a depth of conviction of who God is and who he says he is and we believe in the character of God we don't look at the circumstances that's what that means the substance of things hoped for it's something real brother and sister now brother Branham says this we're going to quote this a lot uh tonight if Lord willing I see that time has flown people have the wrong idea about trials it's not to bring you down and get you defeated it's designed to reveal to you the capacity for faith that you really have see God doesn't need to know how much faith I have I think he knows but he needs us to know what he's already placed in us what he's growing in us how it's developing in us and I want to tell you it's like a spiritual thermometer so you can apply the thermometer and let's see if the child has a temperature all right and and we need a readout and so trials is the readout that God's using to take the temperature of our faith and it's not for his purpose not for Mom and Dad's purpose in this case it's for the child's purpose so that he or she knows what their temperature is so it's not to bring you down and get you defeated but to reveal to you the capacity for faith that you have right anybody seen this at a at a fair you hit this thing and you try and hit it as hard as you can nobody's seen this I'm the only one Iowa State Fair yeah the the greatest fear um so we brother Branham said you don't know what level of Faith you have until it's tested you may think you have great faith but let it be tested then see how much you really have so this is that that that that that um that ball going up this this thing trying to hit the bell at the top right and that's when we know hmm I need to call upon the Lord because in my weakness he's made strong and so then brother Branham says this he says if it's not really strong then call upon the Lord in the day of trouble and he will deliver you buying I should have put a sound in there and so now the same skinny guy has now been able to whack this hammer down so hard that the thing shoots up and hits the bell and that's what trials are there's nothing evil about a trial I'm going to give you another example of a trial very quickly because we're kind of off the notes anyway if you're leading a troop of students on a mountain climbing Expedition and you're taking them along this path and in the beginning it's just the Foothills things are pretty easy going and then as you get to the steeper rockier more treacherous Parts all right and your coach or your guard is urging you on come on come on you can do it come on and you've got my legs are killing me my back is killing me I can't go on he goes no come on you can do it let's go and he's pushing and pushing you might think at the time that you're being tortured and that this is no fun and that um the Sunnah can turn around and hit back the better and I don't know why I ever signed up for this because this is tough this isn't easy and yet there's a wonderful reward on the end when you get up on that mountain and you look at and it's so beautiful and then you're thanking the coach or your guard and saying oh thank you for pushing me I would not have seen this I would not have I would not have experienced this unless you had pushed me so the way God Works in our lives he doesn't beat us he doesn't give us sickness he doesn't do these things that we sometimes associate with him unfortunately we know that's not true but I want you to know what God can do he can just make the road a little steeper he can take you from the foothills of Trials to the really steep parts of Trials and God has done nothing wrong he hasn't become evil you're not being punished for anything he's just trying to get you to a higher level and mountains are a beautiful example but you remember we started off the higher level is a spiritual level he's trying to teach us what we have within us he wants our faith to grow from Faith to Faith all right so brother Ram says the Christian looks at things they don't see because they walk by faith we believe it because the Bible says so they believe it that's how we believe it's because God said so Faith tested try it it proves out a hundred percent God's under obligation to answer that faith brother and sister I cannot tell you how comforting it is to think that I am entitled not because of anything I've done but because of what he has promised in his word I'm entitled to Every Blessing every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line that is our position that is our heret and heritance and God is a man of his word if we if brother Branham saying he's obligated it seems strange right we think of obligation as as a bad thing but in actual fact when we're talking about God it's really important for us to feel that God is obligated now on Sunday Lord willing I hope you'll all come back um and I'm going to talk about Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat and the prayer that he prayed when everything was against him he was in a valley and we'll read that scripture at the end but I just want you to think about it that he was um he was letting God know that he felt that God was obligated to see them out of this Con this problem that they that they were in and I don't want to take away from uh that because that's it's kind of an exciting story so we'll we'll get to that so faith is built in a relationship we talked about the character of God we talked about having something within us that's faith that has to be built over time through a process and Proverbs 3 Verse 6 says in Old our ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct our paths in other words that faith that we have in him in his character is going to allow us to accept his guidance I hope you hope you can see that in this verse if we acknowledge Him if we recognize him for who he is and what he says he is if we have confidence in him if he's a man of his word if we can trust in the character of God heal direct your paths and of course same thing for as many as a lead of this by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so that concept of being a son or a daughter of God that's a relationship this isn't rules and regulations this is a relationship led by the spirit of God not whipped by the spirit of God when God leads God provides and he's not going to push you down a road and then step back and go hahaha look he fell over not at all that's not the character of God God's character is he will go in front of us he will lead us he'll guide us he'll even carry us but he's going to see us through and that's what we trust him and then it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He Delights in his way now I don't know if he is the Lord here that would be the way the language is written that last person spoken of was the Lord so that he Delights it seems to be the Lord it could be either one but in any case that's what a relationship is if the Lord's delighting in us and we're delighting in him now we have the basis of a relationship with God Romans 10 verse 8. the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart and that is the word of faith which we preach Paul said the word of faith which we preach is nigh you even in your mouth and I want to emphasize this I think sister Sharon mentioned this I think Paul said it's our confession it's what we say and I'll tell you what's so important about what you say is when you say something I'm going to take two minutes here hopefully we'll get done with something this evening but I just wanted I want you to understand this concept when you're speaking and saying something you're hearing what you're saying and so your faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God so if you're saying scripture if you're saying positive things if you're saying how wonderful God is how great God is like Jehoshaphat did if you're doing that you're preaching to yourself and your ears are hearing your confession all right now there's another part to it a little bit of a psychological part if you say something guess what you believe it unless you're doing something really weird or there's two or three of you if you say something you believe it because you can't hold two opposing ideas in your mind at the same time you can't have faith and doubt you can't be sitting and standing at the same time it's impossible so when you're speaking words of Faith words of affirmation words of confidence words of encouragement and those words are coming out of your mouth a you believe it and B you can't have any other thoughts while you're saying that and so that you try it try and say something and think about something else while you're saying it and if you can do that um there's probably some people that you might need to get in touch with so you can't hold two opposing thoughts in your mind at the same time faith and doubt are two sides of the same coin and I'm going to talk about that for a second even though it's not in my notes so what we sometimes don't realize and we will talk about this there's quite a large section in these notes on fear and fear is an interesting thing because fear is faith because you can't have you can't have fear or be scared of something you don't believe so if you stepping into the road and you are scared that that buzz is going to kill you all right it's because you know that if you stand there that bus will kill you all right and so you have a healthy fear we teach our kids don't touch the stove don't do that healthy fear all right and so that's a a a example to us of what faith is now of course the devil can take hold of that fear and use it to his own Advantage because he knows that fear is as powerful as faith and the thing which greatly feared Came Upon him the scripture says about job fear is a powerful force don't let it take hold of your life perfect love casts out fear we do not need to fear any of these things because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world no weapon formed against me can prosper and we repeat these words we we pronounce these words over our circumstances and and we say that God can deliver and God can heal and God can take away the things that we don't like in our lives because we trust him and we don't have to fear those things the devil wants us to fear it he wants us to fear that when we do something wrong oh my goodness what's going to happen and so forth but the Bible says he's faithful and just to forgive forgive us if we go and confess our sin so what's there to fear absolutely nothing the Romans 1 17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith so we always think of that last part because that's what caught Luther's attention but I love that from Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith it's a stepping stone all the way through our lives and what is God doing to take us up a little bit higher with each step a little bit of trial a little bit of struggle a little bit of opposing gravity and going up another step going up another step and even another step and as we're doing that we're building muscle we're building stamina we're building resolve we have resilience because we've gone through those processes and that's how God builds Faith it's he's not just spooning it out as if it was um ice cream he's saying this is something that you develop I've given it to you but now and so what does this mean what does it mean to develop it it means that our lives our human lives our born in sin shaped and iniquity lives are opposed to the things of God so when he is making the road steeper when he's adding a valley experience what he's doing is knocking away some of those restrictions to the word of God that is our natural human uh thoughts a human ideas things that um we will take the easy Road that's the normal course of events that's who we are we're like electricity we'll take the shortest route all right that's who we are but God wants to knock that out of us because he's working us up to a time when there'll be a change in the body and you can see that that's not an overnight thing that's not an instantaneous ending one day it'll be instantaneous to be absent with the Lord is absent from the what he's present with the law eventually in the twinkling of an eye that as we are in this world living in this world we're being led up into Glory from glory to glory from Faith to Faith all right amen so much time so we take people at the word based on what we know about their character so it's in life's valleys that we become most dependent by revelation of the character of God it's a revelation this isn't something you can gen up you can't say oh I'm gonna really struggle and I love the way brother Brenham talked about the Sheep pushing out another bit of wool yeah she remember he said they just grazed and the wool Grows by itself and we graze on the word of God and the wool Grows by itself the faith Grows by itself but we have to be part of that process that was the way God intended it and so faith is something that's cultivated and we'll talk about this another time with the four seeds but faith is something that's cultivated and it it's something that we have to uh we have to tend the garden of Our Lives to allow the faith seeds to grow if we allow the weeds in remember the four the parable of the four four four um four different types of Earth that's that's not a comment on the seed it isn't even a commentary on the sower and by the way if you're a farmer and you watch this guy sowing he'd be fired because that seed that very precious seed is actually food he's taking that food out of the children's mouth and throwing it into the ground and the children are like what is he doing but unless the seed falls into the ground and die it's going to abide alone but if it die it'll bring forth much fruit so the lesson is taught to the children but now this guy's sowing and man he's all over the sidewalk he's all amongst the Thorns he's in the shallow soil and hey Presto 25 of it actually lands in good soil but guess what Jesus never criticized the sower and that gives me so much confidence I'm sowing this evening how might not be doing very well but I'm the sower and God never criticized the soul he only criticized the soil interesting so what we're doing is we're cultivating Faith we're tending the garden of our soul remember the soul is like a watered Garden and so we have to tend that now if we're going to grow some fruit in our lives guess where we have to grow it we have to grow it in the valley and here's what brother Branham said about that everybody wants a Hilltop experience and they never want to take the valley well you know it's all right to be on the Mountaintop that's good but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at night and when the cold spell comes you'll lose all your fruit doesn't grow on the mountaintops fruit grows in the valley where does our faith grow it grows in the valley it grows in the difficulties it grows in the trials brother M says when it comes time for cool spell you've got nothing to rest on when the emotion dies down the shots all gone the noises cease then where are you at the Temptation comes along and you can't take it and so we need Valley experiences to build our faith so that when the cool spell comes we can take it and so before you can have confidence in a person's word you have to have confidence in the person or in the character and that's that sermon that brother Branham preached that was uh about that the character of God and so we have to have experience with with God we have to have experience with God to really know him and these experiences are forged in life's valleys and trials Council of you to buy of me gold tried in the fire it's part of God's plan we we don't like it obviously I don't like it going through a little bit now but it is God's way for second Timothy number chapter one verse seven for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind why why did I bring up the scripture uh it's because of the sound mind we're often talking about the soul level and and you know for for good reason that's where the word is and we're looking at the flesh side of our lives and and holding that accountable but we sometimes miss the spirit side of Our Lives that's the the mind the mind and the spirit are synonymous in scripture and so he says of a sound mind and if you if you wanted to do a little research on a sound mind you'll you'll find that there's tremendous lessons in that and and we have to acknowledge that God is looking for us to have a sound mind he doesn't want us believing fairy stories he doesn't want us uh taking things for granted and just assuming that that everything's going to be okay that's not the way God operates God has a plan and a purpose and a process and he needs us to go through those three p's plan perspers and process I'll have to write that down afterwards all right and so that's what he has in mind for us and we cannot bypass that you know the the Tabernacle in the wilderness it had one door right and the first thing you saw when you came through that door was in the in the fence right wasn't a door it was a sheet when you came through that entrance the first thing you saw was the altar of sacrifice and that's where we have to go if we want to have fellowship with Christ we have to start at the cross and we have to acknowledge the the sacrifice that Jesus made for us then the next step in sanctification is with water baptism following the word doing what the word says showing that we can obedient to the word not only obedient to the word but to also put the word together correctly because baptism is a big stumbling block people say what about this what about that but you have to rightly divide the word so the next thing that God does he gives us the water test and you should look through scripture and see how many times God put his people to a water test well the obvious one is the Red Sea right then the Jordan and the the bitter Waters of Mara and the book credon and the Jordan and Elijah and Elisha it goes on and on and on and then the woman at the well the water test remember Rebecca all right well you draw from for for me yes and for your camels too whoa this this is some woman all right so this is the water test so God wants us to understand his word be able to put it together have a sound mind that we aren't believing fairy stories we're seeing patterns we're seeing what God's doing and when we look at that altar of sacrifice and then the Brazen labor and then the next thing is the holy of holies now to get from the door the entrance to the holy place and then into the holy of holies it's a straight line but there's a a theologian called Mr serpent and he has his own way of interpreting the word of God and God Illustrated his way of thinking but taking him and turning him into a long tail a t-a-l-e a story right so you told Eva's story I'm going to make you a story you're gonna be a tale and how does a snake move it slithers from side to side so it might make its way through the entrance but then it's going to bypass the sacrificial Altar and then it's going to bypass the baptism and then it's going to want to get into the holy place that's why it was in a straight line because we have to make sure that we're going God's provided way we're not slithering around trying to get around things we're going straight through the way God intended it so we talked about fear let's um spend oh I think we're actually at the India hahaha um can you give me five minutes I think I can I can get to a stopping point so fear is a magnet that attracts negative thoughts think about that it's like attracting the devil to speak to you because you're confessing something that he believes in and so if he recognizes that you're believing what he's selling he's going to be sure to make sure that he sells it to you and he's going to make it look attractive it's going to look really good and it's going to look like it's not going to be a problem because there was something that attracted him in the first place all right and not only does it attract negative thoughts but it paralyzes you and keeps you from obeying so if you know that if I do this I could have this difficulty I could go through this Valley I could have some financial problems if I do this if I if I do what I'm supposed to do I could have problems that fear is going to paralyze you from doing the things that God wants you to do and remember fear is faith only believe all things are possible good and bad it's something to consider so don't let your thinking be dominated by doubts all right so I'm going to read numbers 13 verse 29 and you guys don't have to look it up it's it's pretty straightforward the amalekites dwell in the land of the South this is the battle that they were facing the malachites dwell in the land of the South the hittats and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and the only thing we were missing in that list are the mosquito bites but those are things that we have to deal with these days all right especially here in Ohio so here's a map shows you where all there I'm not going to spend too much time on that where all those different tribes were located in Israel as best they can determine but you know we also have our mosquito bites today all right we have some Arts today by the way anybody who knows um AI knows that I generated that image this afternoon isn't it good AI generated image showing a bunch of mosquitoes so these are the demons that brother Branham talks about right that try to come against us they're the battle for our soul that we're involved in every day or the battle for the mind so there's unbelievers these are the ones who control the media the White House and the Senate and then there's the atheats all right then there's paganuts and there's muslimats and these are the only ones who get to enjoy any religious freedom you know not not for Christians and of course there's the marxites who have taken over all the public schools so we're also facing Arts all right it's not just the the Hebrews right we're we've got our enemy as well and he's all around us he's in this world he's in every part of our lives and we have to be on our God Paul Brother Paul's been talking about this and and uh and encouraging us and and coming against those Spirits uh very directly and and this is exactly what the Old Testament was designed for was designed to give us these patterns that we can see how we're to face our enemy and then of course we've got our own Arts finances are low inflation is high health is bad my family's in disarray perhaps my job requires I work all kinds of hours but that's not what we should be focused on faith isn't in what might be or what could be that's what paralyzes US what if what if your faith is in the one who knows exactly how it's going to be that's what the substance of faith is it's the things the substance of things hoped for we know the end of the book we know that God has a plan in our lives but we've all been to this church there was a church there in the Israelite Camp the Hebrew Camp Numbers Chapter 13 but the men that went up with him the ten spies said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we so this was the first church of we be not able and that's how faith can be destroyed in our lives if we start confessing what we think rather than What God Says then we're setting ourselves up to see the Giants keep on reading the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight how many sermons have you heard on that we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were so their confession about being grasshoppers is exactly what they were in their own eyes and that's why they didn't go in how you see yourself is how the enemy will see you you're giving him license you're giving him an Open Door you're giving him a foothold you're that little wedge that knows the camel's nose Under the Tent you're just giving him that little bit and he is going to take the whole mile and so when we look at those 10 spiers they weren't chosen because they were weak they weren't chosen because they were ignorant they weren't chosen because they didn't have faith they weren't believers they would have chosen of their best men to go into the land and spy the land But the irony of fear is that it'll stop the next stage in God's process and that's where I'm going to have to stop tonight those who opposed every new move were usually leaders in the last move and as I close I'm just going to tell you this you cannot ever get where you want to go until you lose sight of your own Shore you'll never discover new lands until you lose sight of your own Shore you'll never get where you want to go until you're willing to let go of what you have and that's where fear comes in oh I don't know if I can do that I don't know if I can do that oh that's a risk yes that's exactly the trial that's exactly the test that God's putting you through can you see the character of God can you believe the word of God can you see his the way he's always dealt with you and I don't have time to go into that I'd love to but there is a way that God deals with each one of us and we need to be able to recognize what that is sometimes God deals with one person in a different way from another so you can't take well God did that for that person therefore I'll do that no that doesn't work you've got to follow the path that God has laid down in your life because he knows the information he's the author and the finisher of our faith so God bless you all thank you for your time this evening sorry you're going to little long but we'll pick it up again on Sunday Lord will foreign it's it's a joy to speak on this subject especially when you're going through a bit of a trial because that's the idea right I can say things that my ears my ears here and so I appreciate that it's a privilege that us preachers get to have sometimes but it's not just for us we should be his word in our mouth is as powerful as his word in his mouth it is because he's given us that power amen the Lord bless you brother Gideon
