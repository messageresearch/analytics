========================================

same text we read last wednesday because i promised we'd finish this subject on what sons do with authority what sons do with authority that they have and it's in luke chapter 9 51 and we'll read the same scripture we read last week and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem so the city didn't refuse the samaritans didn't receive him and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume these guys even as elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of and i was saying last in talking about what sons do with authority these disciples were certainly not ready to use the authority of god yet and this is how jesus answered this what we'll speak from tonight because this is where he teaches us what the what the authority is for for the son of man is not come to destroy men's lives but to save them the son of man has not come to destroy men's life but to save them so we can say if we have authority and god gives authority if it's god's authority it has one purpose to save lives not destroy lives and i also say if this sword is not to use against one another or family the sword is for the enemy when we start using it on one another then the enemy sits back and don't have to do anything so he's focused and this thing is not to destroy the sword is not to destroy anybody but the enemy but it's not to destroy other people's lives it's not to destroy people or cities in this case it's actually to save lives because how many know people need to be saved people need salvation of christ today but also they need to be saved from situations and if god gives us authority then we could say the right word sometimes or live the right life that people can be saved from situations that seem impossible he wants us to use our authority to save lives not destroy them heavenly father we thank you lord for this evening together we pray it's a short time we spend that there will be such a substance that comes lord from what we say through your anointing that it would be such a foundational thing such a a solid thing for people to go home with tonight and for people to just feed on and be fed lord we just pray that you'll bless every part of the service plus the weekend coming up we're looking forward to the services with brother diggs and we pray you'll bless our fall fellowship together for the church here and just pray you being in everything and your protection your love around us we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated tonight now you know i don't know what it is when i go into these men's meetings there's a side of me that's so nervous and doesn't want to do it and believe it or not i just have been preaching for years and i can still get very nervous i love preaching at home here i'd rather just stay at home you know but when i get preach out something like that i get real nervous and so lord what am i going to say but something happens like two or three weeks before when i know i have services and the lord just comes and just floods me floods me floods my mind floods my heart with all kinds of different things you know you need to say this and just drops revelation and stuff and i can hardly i need to learn to keep my phone and type it in or say it or something because i i forget a lot of thoughts that that seem to be so good but i just get flooded and then by the time i get there i have to be saying now lord you gave me all this i only have an hour hour and a half i gotta pick and choose because there's no way to talk about all this and that's the struggle that i have there's so much that i get flooded with in revelation and so i only had two services there so you get the blunt of it because you get all the the stuff that i didn't get to you know because i think it's good things the lord gave us but i do want to touch on some of the things because i entered into last wednesday night talking about what sons do with the authority and i did get into that a little bit down there and tonight i want to get back into it for our home congregation bring out a few points i did down there and also some other things as well like i said last wednesday night though these these two disciples james and john did not manifest the right kind of maturity yet to be able to handle the authority of god would everybody agree james and john did not have any kind of uh bedside manner or so they didn't have the right thing here to be able to use the authority of god they're very immature very childish to be able to say let's be like elijah here they rejected us we don't need people that reject us so let's call help us to call fire down from heaven and just burn up and consume these guys we don't need them this is disciples of jesus christ friends these are guys in the world they've been hanging around the lord for probably about three years now and that's the result you get from somebody hanging around jesus let's call fire down from heaven and burn everybody up we don't need them and yet and yet as i've taught you many times yet they are sons of god sons of god were always sons of god and before the foundation of the world sons of god are predestinated to come to adoption can you say amen and because they are sons god will have to teach them and train them and take them and and if he hands authority to them and he hands this great commission of taking the gospel they're going to have to get a hold of something which is first the holy ghost they're going to have to go into an upper room someday they're going to have to empty out of themselves they're going to have to say i want nothing else but the holy ghost and then the spirit came like a rushing mighty wind and baptized all them the holy spirit and they began the process then of being of growing into men and sons that could handle the full authority of god it takes the holy ghost doesn't it but it takes a vessel that has the holy ghost that's willing to grow and mature because god is not coming for the rapture for immature sons and daughters he's coming for adopted mature sons that know their position know their place they have faith in their position in the word but whatever they do they're going to use right they have the word of god but they also have the mind of christ to use it the right way can i say that again they have the word of god the bride has the word of god but not just the word but she has the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word that's two things brother ram says the the bride has the word but she has the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word so it's not just that you have power and authority through the word but it's lord how do we how do we handle it and how do you want us to use it and in what situations the right way so the best the very best can come out of it praise the lord so let me just say about i learned something more about these fellows james and john they were sons and the positive thing is that we can look at their lives at the end of their lives and say praise the lord god changed them they must have grown because if you read their writings it's it's really awesome if you read james and by the way they both got books in the bible so god must have trusted him pretty good later on he didn't trust he said yet you got a bad spirit on you right now when you got to call fire down from heaven you you i you know and like i said before like jonah i would call zip recruiter and get some new recruits finish with you guys i'm going to hire some other recruits you're finished i can't use you if you're calling fire down from heaven burning people up but they were sons god couldn't lose them and and so you know but look at their writings and i'm not going to read them all tonight but read james and read john and i'm going to here's something james wrote now this is the guy now this is the guy that want to call fire down from heaven wonder god we call fire down and just burn up this whole place like elijah did here's what he wrote after he had matured james wrote let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god he learned something he matured can you say amen a lot different at the end and i pray it's the same way with me a lot different at the end because i've made some stupid stupid foolish things i've said some foolish things i had a lot of immaturities when i started out in my christian walk still have some that i need to grow out of but even his young pastor had a lot of immaturities didn't have a clue what i was doing 21 years old i'll just be on i didn't have a clue what i was doing i knew i was called to do it and god was formulating a group but i didn't have a clue how to handle situations please forgive me on the internet whoever come to my church at that time please forgive me for a young pastor didn't have a clue what he was doing be honestly i still don't have a clue what i'm doing today i really don't i actually i say that you're laughing but you know what the more you grow the more you learn to to depend on the lord because where you get into trouble is when you depend on yourself you get older you realize i can't do this without the lord i can't pastor a church this large without the lord god i need your help and we become more dependent on him to walk in the spirit rather than our own carnal minds and so he said that he said i've got to read it again brothers brothers be slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god in john if you read 1st 2nd and 3rd john which is called the epistles of love so the guy that wanted to call fire down from heaven now has books written called the epistles of love and all he could ever say was beloved brothers let us love one another what about this doctrinal question brothers just love one another that was his answer for everything and brother brahm said it he said and you guys might have those quotes so you go i sent them to you as john of old when he got too old as john of old when he got too old to preach he would just set and scream they tell me with all his might little children love one another he couldn't preach anymore but he could scream love one another this is the guy the one that caught fire down from heaven little children love one another love one another don't let nothing come among you [Music] he matured he could handle the word he could handle the power of god he could handle authority because he wasn't burning people up with it he was out to save lives don't let the devil get among you love one another listen this is what it's all about god will do his work god will save people god will change people you're trying to change somebody yourself leave it alone and pray god changes them but if you love one another the holy ghost can work in that congregation and do everything he wants to do if we can just genuinely love god and love one another can i get a witness tonight let god do his work through the holy ghost by us loving one another out of the love of god comes all things and we have the word but we need the love of god here's another thing he said about john he said john once was different john once was different you know he was the one who wanted to call fire down out of heaven and destroy his city because he wouldn't give him something to eat down there i thought that was pretty funny that he wanted to destroy the city because they wouldn't give him something to eat down there now i can understand that anger a little bit they wouldn't give him something to eat it's not justifiable but you know what i need to eat i get okay all right so he wouldn't give him something to eat down there so mistreated him and he wanted to burn the whole thing up and then after jesus got a hold of him he was around jesus but then jesus got a hold of him when jesus how many wants jesus to get a hold of you it's not just that you're at church but you let jesus get a hold of you when jesus got a hold of this man who wanted to call fire down from heaven when jesus got hold of him it changed them to a man of love and that's what god does when he takes some of those hard-hearted fellows like myself and you and he changes us from our selfish and indifferent motives to a love that we just love him and melt our hearts away praise be to god so be it lord in our lives these are the same guys who did it i thought that was pretty unique now we're going to talk tonight a little bit about what god wants us to do with authority and in our text he says the son of man is not out to destroy men's lives but that's that's what men do when they misuse the authority of god it destroys lives whether it's a preacher whether it's a father amen whether it's a husband whether it's an employee an employer whether it's a president anybody that's in authority if they've got the wrong kind and they don't have character with it it destroys lives and that's the evidence we know something's wrong a father he may be providing for his family but if there's destruction in his path and his children are scared of them or there's something going on just trickling down there's something wrong with the man there's something wrong with that man something wrong with his leadership can you say amen because why it's not saving his children it's not building up trust with his children it's actually destroying their spirit it's destroying their confidence it's destroying their love that they don't trust love it's slowly after years destroying it's a destructive thing following that man and we know that that's not what the authority of god in a man was meant to do it's not to destroy families it's not to destroy a church it's to edify a church it's to save people from their problems from their situations they don't have christ to save them by his grace amen so when authority is misused then it destroys and it starts with daddy starts with daddy comes to mommy then and you know there's uh scripture in ephesians that talked about husbands and wife i thought i might mention it because it's related to authority and he breaks down there the the headship of a man over a woman and then he says the woman should be obedient to their own husbands that's scriptural it's not a far-fetched amish idea it's in the bible and as strange as it is to society it is the truth it's what god laid down not that the man would be a dictator of the woman or to step on her but to love her and and to but that he put he put headship over her since the garden of eden as a protection over the woman and that's the way god does it because god's headship over us god god how many know that god's is the authority over us that we submit to but i don't feel uh bound by it i feel protected by it so if he tells me something in the word to do i know he's meant it for my protection that's the way leadership should be but as a talking to the men when they get into this thing of having to reaffirm their headship all the time to their wife and re-establish it and keep going back to the scriptures you know there's a lot of men it's like when they run into trouble in the marriage they think that the problem is she's not under head ship so they keep going back to ephesians 4 and establishing his headship again and there's something wrong with a man that has to keep doing that because if you have something you don't have to keep bringing everybody in the family back to the scripture to reestablish it you just have it and they know it is that okay with everybody god doesn't have to come back and reestablish them he is he is the authority in our lives you can either follow it or you can reject it but i find under god's headship and protection and subjecting and obeying god i find great protection so it's all in how we look at but when he got into ephesians when he said men because this whole thing trickles down where he gave the man the headship and protection over her family and over a wife and he said for the wife to submit a woman can in her own uh heart and a oneness and marriage can weigh in on things and give her opinion all that she should be able to do that but at the end of the day where there's a tie in the vote that man's got to make a decision and she's got to submit to it and that's where submission comes in if that decision is on the word and he feels light of god she's got to submit to that decision amen right but she should have the liberty to share because she's not a doormat she's part of you so she weighs in she's a she's a board member you know she's there and she weighs in on decisions but at the end of the day if there's a tie in the vote and they're saying a man's got to make a decision what to do and so she then she submits to that but you see now paul mentioned something about the woman and the man and the man he says to you the head of every man is christ and the head of every of the woman is the man let a man love his wife and guide her with that authority as christ loved the church so he's saying how you exercise your authority how it has to be christ-like so you look at christ how he's the head of the church and you fashion yourself how you lead your home that way it better be after the love of christ and it better have to be the strong leadership of christ it better not be a compromiser can you say amen the love of christ is not a compromiser but yet it has the love to love that family and that woo that family into more of the lord not a dictatorship says i'm the head and i'm reestablishing my headship and i'm going to take you back to the scripture because the problems in this family is the woman won't come under my headship that's the problem in most cases when i counsel that's not the problem but that's what he keeps going to and if she would just come on my subjection then our family would be fine and i tell them not always not always that may be the case sometimes with a woman she might be rebellious to headship but a lot of times it's not that's not the whole picture sometimes the pictures he wants headship but he don't want to be under his ship he wants to be in headship but he don't want to be of the authority of anybody the word a pastor he don't he don't he's unaccountable he does his own thing there's no headship in his life and yet he wants to read the scripture and you feel like saying he keeps defaulting to the scripture about woman being under subjection and you like to say you know there are other scriptures in the bible besides that one in ephesians you know she would get this straight our life would be happy if she would just keep this this one guy told me if she would keep this house spiffy clean when i get home and if he'd keep it as clean as this other sister keeps her housekeeping oh you shouldn't have said that you shouldn't have said that you shouldn't have said if she would just keep this place clean like that other sister we wouldn't have any marriage problems i'm telling you that's what he said that's what he said i'm just i'm laughing on the inside because i'm not allowed to in the office when i'm counseling something i'm going and so i had the bonus to say buddy that is the furthest thing from the truth that if your wife kept the house clean all your problems would be away you need to grow up and realize you're not under headship and your marriage problems are a lot more deeper than your wife not keeping the house clean now she may have need to work on that thing but to make it the ultimate happiness to their marriage sorry not going to go there with you i need to stay on my notes because but anyway i wanted to say the man the man we should do a marriage seminar here we can talk about marriage we should have services on marriage and invite all the young people that are unmarried but you know uh he says love your wives as christ loved the church and then woman you know the the wives obey your own husbands not every man my dad used to say that oh women obey every man it doesn't say this says obey your own husbands and so he talks about obedience for the woman and he's taught christ-like and like the bride type of the bride that it's not us like you're under his thumb and you're a doormat but you willingly say this is my leadership this is my protection and i submit to him and if he's if he makes a wrong decision he's going to get hit by god on it and i release that to him you see that's what a lot of women won't do they they think they know more and so they're you know they're they're gonna i'm gonna have to correct this guy i know someone said man makes a decision no you're not doing that you're not doing that you need to hit an altar you don't tell your husband you're not doing that you don't guide the family the husband guides the family the father leads the family but one of the reasons paul has to say love your wives that christ loved the church and women because man's sinful tendency is to become harsh and a dictator with his authority okay that's why paul had to say it love her as christ loved the church let this authority be used the way christ would use it and the reason he has to say the woman about subjection because women's sinful tendency is to step out of her place and become dominating and a lot of times women will do it because the man won't take the leadership so they step in and they just take it we're not really supposed to do that but women's sinful tendency is to step out of her place and become the man and become the leader and tell their husbands what to do and so the reason paul has to address this because it's our sinful tendency to do that on the man and woman's side and he wanted us to keep it in line with the holy ghost and the holy spirit the way it's supposed to be if you're a studyer of the word and you study the church ages you'll find there's two spirits that god rebuked the nicolaitan spirit and jezebel spirit and there you have man getting off with his leadership to the wrong kind of authority to a denomination and the church becoming a jezebel and you know who jezebel is in the bible so it even happened spiritually in the church is that the church got off where it become nicolet and you conquer the laity all the holiness is in the pulpit there's no holy ghost in the people you don't need your bibles anymore they took their bibles away we'll interpret the bible for you that that dictatorship you just do what i say and i'll read the bible for you that's the nicolaitan spirit and then the dominating jezebel spirit says the church says i don't need the husband christ anymore i'll have lots of lovers and i'll open myself to any kind of seed in any kind of spirit and i will say what we're going to do so this authority thing is so important that we look at it because in our own lives we can get off track and misuse the authority that god has given us how many can say amen we can misuse the authority that god gives us and sons have been given all the authority today i believe they've been given the authority of god and so he says don't use your power to destroy use it to save lives so he said we find in this the key god's authority is not to destroy men's lives but to save lives to restore to to to redeem how many know that god's love and power is to redeem something not throw something away it's to restore something can you say amen that's god's power that's what it's used for use your authority for the right thing and that's to restore respect to restore the right kind of thing to redeem can you say amen don't use your power to destroy jesus says you guys don't even know what spirit you're of don't use your power to destroy but the son of man has come to save lives use whatever god gives you to save lives that's the key can you say amen that's the key don't use it to force something on somebody don't use your authority to force something on another person except the devil we do force the devil but don't use your authority to force something use what you have to draw others into life can you say amen and i said to the brothers jesus came in the ministry of the three poles not the three pushes it wasn't the first and second and third push but it's the pull and that means it draws you all the father have given me will come if you draw an eye to me i'll draw an eye to you there's a it's a children are drawn to the right kind of leadership in a husband but they are naturally repelled to the wrong type of leadership is that okay a good godly girl will repel someone who's not the right kind of leader she'll back off from it but if she sees real holy ghost leadership at a young man she should be attracted to that saving lives is everybody on board tonight it's to save lives not to destroy them it's saving other people's lives and i want to get into this night tonight saving your own think about it say brother paul but but god saves doesn't he god saves not us yes but who does god use to save people acts 1 and verse 8 says ye shall receive power after which the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses and when you're a witness you're affecting other people's lives he gave you the holy ghost in order to affect others to save others can you say amen that's why he gave you that's why he brought you into the body of christ it wasn't just to occupy and appeal somewhere but you have power you have authority you have his love you have all this resident within you but it's not it's not to use in the wrong way it's meant to save other people's lives when the holy ghost has come upon you then ye shall be witnesses unto me in judea and everywhere in other words it's to affect other people's lives for salvation amen so so it's yes i receive that power and god is showing what his power will do if you want to know the scripture what his part will do you see because you say well i thought they got the power of the holy ghost to heal the sick and to do miracles in pentecost when they were filled with the holy ghost no he gave them that power the disciples before the holy ghost came you remember when he sent the 70 out and he said you'll have power to be able to lay your hands on the sick be able to pray for them they have that power so the power of the holy ghost is something different it's something deeper it's the conversion that changes your life but it's not so much for miracles as it is you shall be a witness you shall be a testimony you shall live the life they'll see the holy ghost on display they'll see god living and that's why they said when they got around the disciples after the holy ghost they took note they were had been with jesus they've been with jesus because they could see something in their lives they've seen the miracles they see him walk in the shadow of peter and somebody was healed that's all there can you say man but what was it to be witnesses power to be a witness power to live an overcoming life blessed be his name so there and you'll find there's no one who received the holy ghost even in acts except through a member of the body of christ nobody received the holy ghost in the book of acts except there was another member of the body christ there to speak it to them and preach the gospel and some of you are going i'm going to have to go home and study that and make sure he's saying the truth nobody received it unless somebody was there preaching so the pat does god save lives god saves lives but he uses you to do it that's how much authority we have so it's not that we save them but we have the authority even brother brahm said he says no preacher saves or heals but he said the preacher he says he he preaches and he cast out he has authority he cast out the unbelieving devil so that you can be saved so that you can be healed he said we were always saved before the foundation of the world in god's mind we were always saved so when you come and when you come to the altar your salvation that's when you recognize it but you were always saved what makes you what makes you come to the altar what makes you receive what brings the conviction well that preacher probably labored in the word of god or that person at your work had been praying it doesn't have to be a preacher but that person at work had been praying to lead you to the lord and praying to say the right word and all of a sudden what he says what he says has the sword and the authority to drive away the unbelieving devil and all of a sudden when the unbelieving devil's gone i can be saved i can be healed can you say amen you can be healed tonight if you drive away all the unbelieving devils that's what us preachers do we don't save people we don't heal people we just preach the devils away and i have authority tonight to do it when i was talking about husbands and wife you know i was doing i was driving demons away i know what i'm doing up here and i don't do it by my own authority i do it by the authority of god preaching drives away demon spirits so you can get victory glory be to god so here's another quote here an attitude and who is god he says i'm afraid that the church i'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority amen i'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority i'm afraid that the holy ghost born men doesn't realize their authority where the chur the authority that god has permitted to his church i'll give unto thee the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you lose will be loose is not that the commission to peter and to all the church that when you have the holy ghost you have power and authority to bind up to loose can you say man that's why when they said to peter what do we need to do to be saved peter had the right words he didn't just say be saved he preached the gospel and he gave him the path repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he just unloosed the kingdom of god to them they were asking but peter peter had the right words and he loosed the kingdom of god to them bow the devil and loose the kingdom to them so it came through because why peter had authority i'm here to tell you tonight if you're a holy ghost believer you have authority what i'm preaching on is that we use it the right way because for so many years in the message authority in some situations has been abused and used wrong by fathers by preachers i could give you ten examples right now of how preachers have misused the authority of a pastor and they like that husband has to go back to that scripture to reestablish they're getting up to their congregation and said can anybody come and show me where i'm wrong in the word and they challenge the congregation and read the quotes about authority and sometimes that's in place but if you're doing it to try to hold on to your authority to people you've already lost it so many years that i can give direct examples without giving names but even in our own ranks pastors and ministers can abuse their authority what i'm preaching this for to men but also our congregation is that if we have it we really need to find how god wants to use it because it'll be powerful powerful against the enemy glory be to god remember i said how ben franklin discovered electricity but he didn't know what he had brother bram says he said i've got something we've got it we got it but he didn't know what he had he found the power of it but then brother brahman said that thomas edison harnessed the power of it and figured out how to get it so we can have lights tonight so it's two phases it's one having the power but it's also knowing how to harness it having the power of the holy ghost but knowing how to harness it in the right humble life that it can be used correctly and thank god we can use the lights tonight thank god somebody harnessed the power of electricity it's an unseen force it would have just been out there and somebody said we got it we got it we got it but brother brahms says is that benjamin franklin he didn't know what he had the church we've got it we've got it i've got the holy ghost but you really don't know what you have and you don't know what to use it for and that's when god calls upon a humble submissive life to say god let me bring this thing under subjection to you and channel this authority and power in love to be able to use it for your kingdom to save lives starting with my own children can i get an amen you want to go on the mission field start with your own family amen to save lives so you have to have this under control supreme power the anointing of supreme court power and control brother bram says pentecost thought the anointing was somebody who's dancing around the room he said that's not the anointing that's the blessings of god and there ain't nothing wrong with it you feel the blessing stimulation of revelations you make shout all over this room i've shouted i've danced that's the blessings god it's not the anointing right and we love that we believe in it if you feel the blessings of god you do probably some of you need to do it more some of you are too starchy might as well just say it you ought to come wednesday night to have church amen get under the blessings we'll shout but he says you pentecostals that's not the anointing he said the anointing is supreme power in control what a powerful statement the anointing is supreme power in control it's harnessed it's brought into the channel what god wants to use it for it's ever powerful but it's what does god want me to use it for amen you brothers that heard this already on saturday night brother john brother kyle i appreciate you should say amen just as loud just as if you never heard it before just pretend you haven't heard it all right so i got i got 15 minutes here i got to wrap up so now we're submissive to him to use these things and bring these things under control by the authority that's within us now i've said in the past few months ago i was preaching on our participation in creation creation is calling for something that's not there and we participate in this creation of god with the holy ghost by saving lives we participate creating is how many know that the bride with the authority and power of god have creative power maybe you don't know that tonight adam had creative power before the fall calvary is restoring us back to what adam lost the title deed to the earth was in adam's hand he lost it through the fall but now it's been given back to his people which means we're coming back to a place of authority again all right so which we're coming back to a place of creating like adam did at the beginning so already with the holy ghost of brother rhymes tell us we have created power to change things so it's if creation is calling for something that's not there if there's no love we can bring it on the scene if no one will do it for us sons of god will make it happen by faith religious people wait for god to do something or they wait for someone else to do something for them but sons of god say i have the power within me now i'll pray right now i don't need to wait till sunday to have brother paul pray for me i'll use the authority and pray in his name right now my wife's sick i'll pray right now my kid has got a fever i'll pray right now call me call brother brandon call the brothers ask for support in prayer put it on the sister's chat keep it a positive thing pray for us and that's wonderful but listen you don't need to wait to pray if you have his name and have authority you pray [Applause] you pray religious people wait for god to do it themselves excuse me they wait for god to do it for them or someone else but see the sons call jesus on the scene they're the ones calling jesus on the scene amen if there's no peace we call for it if there's no happiness we ask for it we create it think about it some wait for god to deliver them from habits and you're waiting for some feeling to sweep over you at a convention or a camp meeting you're waiting for the feeling sunday to sweep over you to deliver you from this habit and sometimes that feeling only lasts till monday you don't need a feeling you need deliverance and i say use the authority of god that you have to cast out that devil amen if you if you say to this mountain can you say amen how many years did abraham declare things that were not as though they were right 25 years declaring things that were not as though they were amen so i'm going to skip a bunch of this because we have to move on all the authority given to his sons adam he had the title deed to the earth so i'm bringing you back to adam's day now and i'm just going to read a quote and we'll close here in about 10 minutes we know that all the authority there for for the earth because adam was under authority now he's given him an evil given all authority on earth and he's exercising that authority he has the title deed to the entire earth he has ownership the reason why god created planet earth i don't know about the other planets and what his purpose is but this planet earth was created for sons of god to rule and reign and then he placed adam and eve you're the ruler you're the reigner you name the animals the lord what's that little thing crawling over there what's that thing running around going up the tree that god says well name it give it a name it doesn't have a name yet i call it a squirrel so all this is being handed to adam because the earth is created for him this is how adam was functioning so now i'm going to drop into a quote here he's exercising all authority and brother brown says this in fundamental foundation for faith he says a lot of good things in that message if you want to read it i'm pulling out just one area what did god put man here for you ever think of it what did he put you here for just to do a job just to exist just to work and retire and get a camper get a truck a is what uh eleanor my granddaughter calls it papa's cuck you know brother bran says what are we really here for what's he baptized us with the holy ghost for it's not for all this earthly things it's not just to build a a nest egg so he goes into this he says now god when he made a man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on the earth he gave him jurisdiction of everything on the earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the foul life the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything did you get the picture here before the fall a son of god was in control of things things didn't control him we've lived for six thousand years culminating in satan's eden not god's eden and it is a it is a world with artificial intelligence and all these uh all this oh i don't even know what all to call it but all this technology we got you know what human beings are like robots we're controlled they're dictating what kind of truck we buy they're dictating what we have in our home they dictating we that we go in debt for something because we might not have the money but they say we'll give it to you and so we're we're being controlled and so so you get the place that your your finances are controlling you instead of you controlling your finances can i get an amen from somebody here tonight we're not supposed to live as sons and daughters of god where everything's controlling us we're to stand with the humility and power of god and we're to be in control of our finances we're to be control of our families word exercise and he had it over the winds he had it over everything he controlled the plant life he controlled everything that's what we fell from that's what we're going back to that's what i've seen in my life since i've been 16 years old i've had my battles i have my weaknesses i'm still not perfect but i have watched the power of the holy ghost allow me to control things in life when the devil was coming in that i by the holy ghost control things things don't control me amen let's give them a hand that's right right now we are sons of god we have been redeemed by his blood and this power is already working in sons and daughters of god nothing should control you not a mother-in-law not an uncle not your children dictating what you do there's a lot of families the children are running home oh boy this is we need to talk about this sometimes they're being controlled by everything and then all the the young people everything a moon movie star comes out whatever they wear however they wear their hair whatever they do and you know what you're being controlled you're a robot and i come to the place they don't control what i wear when i the word controls what i do i'll tell the devil what i'm going to wear i'll tell a sister should say the fashion industry doesn't dictate what i wear i dictate as a daughter of god what he wants me to wear [Applause] ain't that he controlled everything he controlled everything isn't that wonderful and and paul had a little statement there and he's talking about eating beating stuff in romans and he says one little statement he says i have the liberty to do this but i will not be brought under the power of anything powerful statement i will not be brought under the power of anything i'm under subjection to god but the devil's kingdom it doesn't control me satan does not did you know they said this a brother said this to the mending satan doesn't control when sons of god he doesn't control anything he's not in charge of anything amen he doesn't run your life unless you let him this brother said the only thing the devil runs is his mouth and that is scriptural when it says the accuser of the brethren he doesn't he's not in charge of anything he's not in control unless you let him he's not running any company he's not running anything he doesn't he's not allowed to do that but he certainly runs his mouth it's the only thing the devil's running is his mouth accusing the brethren amen i will not be under brought under the power of is anybody getting anything out of this tonight are you glad they came to church wednesday night tonight are you glad you're listening in amen let me say what i remember to lydia man what a powerful saxophone special you had on sunday lydia praise god good job the devil didn't like that man keep doing that i prayed for a full orchestra someday here and lydia you're the start it's coming someday okay so now here i have five minutes six minutes left according to my promise where where am i at okay so i read okay so he has everything i want to go after he says he controlled the animal life okay and adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak now this isn't a story this is your brother adam he's the son of god like you are he could speak to the wild he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obedient man was made as a secondary god on the earth he was given the power to control all things all the elements of the earth that was adam everybody got it look at this adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself itself is where he fell and that's the same look that i had when i read that quote that's interesting i've been pondering it for a couple weeks preached it at the brothers meeting he's exercising all this authority over everything and where the devil got him was something personal his promise because he had all this animal life and that was all created by god and he was in control of it a lot of times that's us you know we're controlling this we're controlling our business or controlling it how our house looks and all these other things but then the devil got him when he gets personal to him because he had a personal promise that he and they would multiply and replenish the earth which is god's desire god's desire was to multiply himself and he gave that to his son to multiply himself in other words to pass on to in other words something would come out of you that would more sons and daughters of god that's right and brother brahm says i want you to leave that up if you can brother brahm says but the power that he the power that was given to make himself is where he fell so here we see that all the powers he was given the power that controlled himself from where the devil could get into himself where we weren't supposed to leave that alone we're using the authority for everything else we're supposed to use it when the devil hits us personally as well and that's where man falls is that they can exercise the authority in anything else but then the devil slips into something that's personal this is what adam fell from but how did it happen well first of all adam's wife came out from under her husband's headship or she was like she got she got alone with the serpent serpent starts to speak with her misquote the word of god pull it hurt away right so she got out from headship adam got out from other headship with her okay once you come out of the authority and headship of god you start to lose your authority because all authority of god you can't have it or exercise it right unless you my brother and sister are under god's authority of his word and he gave them the word and they were supposed to stay under that authority of the word and now the devil attacks them in that area personally the devil attacks his wife the devil came to his wife first it's interesting he's he's in the first creation of god he's a direct son of god she she is she is created with him in that way but then when he split him up then we know that she was a byproduct brother rem said so she had the ability to have the weakness to fall so we know that's the plan of god but i want you to look at in this sense is that where's adam's authority when the serpent's moving in on his wife he's using it on the trees he's speaking to the squirrels he's moving mountains and the devil sneaks in on his own wife his own family where's his authority then sneaks in they come out from underneath his headship where he fell was not to use his authority when where he fell was not to use his authority when satan came with personal attacks private attacks satan began to mess with adam's potentials i know it's quiet but it's okay i want you to think deeply about this before we close satan can let sons of god do all kinds of things but you watch where he attacks you it's then to defeat you in your potentials your promise and he's he's going to start messing with his potentials and what he will be someday how many knows the devil can stunt growth you're supposed to go grow into a full mature son of god i guarantee you the devil's against that he's going to keep you immature he's going to keep you defeated he's going to keep telling you that you're not even a son of god he's going to keep messing with your promise and your potentials he's going to keep defeating you in that area that's where we have to watch and he should have adam should have used his authority to address him he is controlling everything else why didn't he use his authority to control this serpent to say to his wife look at here sweetie listen i know what he said to you but we're sticking with the word he's using authority to do that and said he didn't we're sticking with the word sweetie you know not satan's interpretation he's in he's misinterpreted this to you so we need to be careful the voices were listened to that's the hiss of the serpent brother brahma says you start to listen to other voices beside the word of god that's the hiss of the serpent amen he referred to the hiss of the serpent and listening to other interpretations of the bible and denominational interpretations of the bible that's that's your enemy but he should have stood up should have stood in the authority of god he was controlling everything else he should have controlled him and say honey we're going to stick with the word we're not taking satan's interpretation we're not doing things this way satan get out of here in the name we would have said in the name of jesus christ serpent get out of here leave this place he didn't do it he gave in from using his authority for the right thing the personal attack on his wife personal attack on his his future personal attack on him he said you'll be as gods and adam should have used the authority of the word to say now wait a minute the serpent is saying the serpent told you it will be his gods if you believe me adam should have been saying but i'm already a god i'm a minor god on earth god made me that why do i need to take satan's path to be a god i'm already a god notice how subtle the devil is to take the very word of god the very promise of god he's already in that position and he's luring him into another path and another position to eat off the tree of knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life i'll tell you friends this serpent is still alive today this devil is still your enemy today it wants to sway your children it wants to speak to you it wants to whisper to you it wants to sway your wife it wants to sway your kids it wants to come to your door and i believe sons of god should stand up with their authority against the serpent's voice can i get an amen this serpent is still hissing and still speaking today in every day in a family's life he's out to attack the wife the family to the the children your personal promise he's out to defeat you you ought to stand on two feet by the word of god and use your authority for that i'm preaching you what to use the authority for you ought to use it for that [Music] you ought to use it when the devil's subtly coming in between the oneness and your marriage he's breaking all the oneness the attack is related to his home his wife it's not the animals not the squirrels it's not the trees it's not the mountains it's related to his wife it's related to affecting his future his personal future the program of god is to reproduce himself satan is stepping in to temple with all of this and adam with all this authority doesn't use it for the right thing satan was being intentional this way brother sam said it at camp satan is intentional today with our children our families and our spiritual walk he's intentional he's subtle but he's intentional he's subtle but he's intentional and if satan is intentional sons of god need to be intentional can i get an amen if satan is intentional sons of god and daughters of god need to be intentional to cast him out i say praise the lord amen and i'll just say this go into it in another service another time it's not just related to his his wife his future his potentials his promise it it just broke away all the oneness between them their oneness with god was broke why didn't he stand in authority against i tell you if satan is trying to attack your oneness with god and your marriage you that's when you use your authority satan in the name of jesus do you know what else is related to it and i'm saying this a little bit more tactfully here than i would in the men's meeting there was a there was an adulterous sexual relationship between the serpent and eve i know some of you listen in from different churches maybe you come from a denomination you think i'm wackle you study your bible and see what came from the garden two seeds there was an experience but i'm telling you tonight satan's attack was not just personal but it was related to adulterous sex and we live in the same day he tries to cause you to fall and it seems to be many times related to private sexual sins eve's innocent she doesn't know anything about this it's satan who introduced it to her how many kids do i got coming up to me today saying i was introduced to this at eight years old i was introduced to this at five years old it's the same serpent as in the garden stuff they never should have seen but in this age they see it way too early should never see it because satan is intentional is the grace of god bigger oh yes is the blood of jesus christ bigger is he able to wash away all guilt and every stain amen amen and amen if we didn't have the blood of jesus christ we'd be finished we'd be like sodom and gomorrah except there was a remnant we'd be like sodom and gomorrah but we have the blood of jesus christ we have the token for our children we have the authority for our homes our families to nip it in the bud amen what do you do with the devil you use the authority to nip it in the bud as soon as it starts to come in and if you're struggling with the guilt of that tonight no matter who you are no matter how young age it was plead the blood of jesus christ and come to him and let him wash away let his blood just wash away every memory every stain let him wash it away walked away i wouldn't preach you see that so much and then you go speed ahead to the noah's day and the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were pretty and that's where their fell fall began speed ahead another two thousand years speed ahead six thousand years here we are in the days of sodom and gomorrah again and sexual sin is everywhere adulterous sin our kids are taught about adulterous fornication relationships before they're taught about the right thing in the bible what a shame that's why i talk about it in our youth meetings because i want our youth to hear it from god's heart first most the time i don't get to them but i'll say to you tonight take the authority of a christian and nip satan in the bud just nip it cut it out of your life and say i'm gonna reserve myself for my wife or my husband someday and put this in the hands of god and he controls it we should take a service about that satan cannot control anything unless you let him can you say amen we are under control it's in the agar in the garden that's what christ is bringing sons back to and satan now is he's like i said he isn't running anything but his mouth but he doesn't run anything unless you let him run it stand with me so i close i think i mentioned this last wednesday night but what did what did esther do with all the authorities the type of the bride what did esther do with her authority okay in a moment's time in a moment's time she was handed all the authority of the king the king said up to the half of my kingdom what is it that you want and so here's the question what did esther do with all that authority this is the type of the bride in a moment's time she was given here's this little unknown girl orphan girl orphan girl i think the brother preached it and she's handed in a moment's time she changes from having nothing to having complete authority that's a christian you didn't deserve it you don't earn god's authority it comes by his grace and the holy ghost and in a moment she had it all and she could have used it for anything she wanted you know the two things she used it for to expose her personal enemy in the presence of the king and to save her people's lives now i bring you back to my text where jesus said brothers james and john [Music] you're going to learn this someday the son of man ministry has not come to destroy people's lives it's come to save them and esther under the mystery of god had that revelation because she could have used her authority for anything but she used it to invite her direct enemy into the same room as her king and expose them in the presence sometimes you don't have the you don't have the strength to do it on your own so you invite the presence of the king first you turn a tape on you turn you turn up some good lafontaine music on just plug in my music you know get some good holy ghost music going brooklyn tabernacle acquire something like that and you get he gets things going or you get in the word and you create an atmosphere okay and then you just you start looking at those weaknesses and happens in those demons and say okay devil in the name of jesus christ if you've got a habit and you need delivered bring it to church with you this sunday you got a devil on your shoulder bring him to church he don't usually stay very long expose him in the presence of the king and then the bible says musicians you should have taken the cue you should have been up here already the bible says and the next thing she wrote with all authority she wrote with all authority she wrote the salvation of the entire nation of israel her people it wasn't a selfish thing she used her authority to rewrite mercy rewrote my life she's rewriting the salvation of her people because she has the authority to do it the bible says she wrote with all authority just a little orphan girl she says i'm not anything but i have the authority of god and so i'm writing this and i'm writing this and she what she wrote became the authority of the entire land no devils can come against it no kingdoms could change it and it saved all of her people because jesus said this thing came to save people's lives not to destroy praise god all hearts clear tonight amen amen glory be to god there is power in the name of jesus let's sing it a few times before we go there is power in the name of jesus [Music] sing it again singing again [Music] in the name of jesus there is power [Music] one more verse [Music] i
