you today thank you [Music] he walked a road of suffering yet he walked upon the Water he held out a loving hand but no one else would bother give his life a sacrifice to redeem the sons and daughters so I ask you as you live your life are you living it forever what in the world are you gonna do a word in the world are we gonna say when he comes for his Chosen Few to be proud of us [Music] though we're not here to stay but she has placed us where we stand in the light and show the way sometimes in our suffering we forget we can walk on water we justify our Idle Hands and safe we're too busy it's about them we're called to live in sacrifice to replace his sons and daughters so I ask you as you live your life [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus came into the world but not for no good reason came to give eternal life to those who were just listen just because he lives in you that doesn't change his mission into all the world and give what you've been given what in the world are we gonna do [Music] [Applause] [Music] we be proud of us [Music] Jesus came into the world but not for no good reason came to give eternal life to those who would just listen just [Music] what in the world are we gonna do around the world are we gonna say when he comes for his Chosen Few proud of us today even though we're not out of this world even though we're not here [Music] the world are we gonna say when it comes to his Chosen Few be proud of us today even though we're not of this world even though we're not here [Music] showed away Divine love beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things read it again Divine love bearth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things I want to add a couple scriptures to that in First Corinthians chapter 15 if you don't mind First Corinthians 15 and verse 57 but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ are you glad tonight that he gives you the victory in the battles of the Lord if he fights our battles there's always a victory amen and then it says in second Corinthians chapter 2 a similar thing that we want to add second Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 14. now thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place the first part of it says we thank God which always causeth us to Triumph in Christ always the victories in mind always the Triumph is in mind doesn't matter how low it gets he causes us always to Triumph so he's got the victory in mind for our lives Divine love should not be looked at as anything that originates in human at all no human being can produce this on his own this isn't just being good to people if you're being good to people that's a good thing but this love this Capstone love this Divine love this perfect love can only be in one it can only originate in one place and that's our Lord he is love he's the substance of love Christ is the substance of love and so if you didn't receive the right kind of love in your life there's a person who can give it to you and besides that if it comes and lives in you then you can project this love to other people and so when we look at we want to know the point that this love is not a human love in the beginning of time it's amazing that in the first two or three scriptures of the Bible we can have the key actually to all the chaos that's in the world today because in the second verse of the Bible you go back and read it if you got your Bible you can go back and read it sometime we already have the answer when the whole world was without form and void and empty and chaos and so there was nothing to fix that uh there was nothing to make that right can you say Amen there was no source of itself that could redeem the chaos that was in the answer I think it's in verse three and the spirit of the Lord moved upon that chaos the spirit of the Lord moved upon the waters and then light it said let there be light and then Light Came where'd the light come from it came from God so when he the spirit moved on this that's when chaos turned to an Eden it's when the spirit of the Lord moves on your life and you respond is when your chaos turns to an Eden can I get an amen tonight it's when the spirit of the lord it's not when it's not within yourself it's not something you can produce within yourself if you're in chaos you can't change the chaos you can't just have a psychological thing and change and people can get pretty strong in their minds but when there's that type of chaos and the type of chaos that's in the world there has to be something come from another source and that's where it came from the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the waters and that everything begin to change and became at Eden he can do the same thing to your life so when we look at this love we have to see it is that it's not from Human effort the answer is is it doesn't the answer doesn't come from an outside thing of human effort in any form this love will only come from the person of Love Christ and he will be the only source of it and so then when you have that buy a new birth when you have his love within you the next step is getting past the Flesh and the mind and the clouds and all that be moved away and with all that and that's why Paul said be transformed by the renewing of your mind this is someone who's already born again this is someone who already has the holy spirit in them and in the Holy Spirit is that love but see our minds are clouded by things so the next step in the Christian journey is now to be transformed by the continual renewing of our mind and that it gets all the cloudiness now all the past out all your past thinking out and when it keeps purging all of those things and washes it away guess what can happen the love of God is released out of you to other people what happened at Calvary what happened at Calvary you say well our Lord died there he he brought the sacrifice he he was the lamb that took care of our sins yeah we got all those explanations and that's exactly what happened but what happened at Calvary there was a death and guess what love was released to you can you say Amen what happened to Calvary the love of God was released the love of God came forth from Calvary and but it had to be released it was there but it had to be released and how was it released it was released look at this now through a death through a suffering through pain through the death of Christ and when we start dying to ourselves when we start dying to our own will when we stop fighting for our own will and learn how to respond to God then maybe the love of God can be released when he died at the cross it released the love of God to us when we can die to ourselves it releases more the love of God because we're asking Lord how can I have this excellent way how can I have more of this perfect love released in my life well through Calvary the love of God was released through a suffering through a death through a dying to himself and he died physically we die in our minds we die to our own will there is a death we go through or else our Lord would not have said take up your cross and follow me he didn't say take up his cross he he went to his cross but there's a cross you have to bear and so everyone has a cross and that's dying to our own will Jesus himself had to die to his own will he's prayed in the garden father not my will but thine be done there would have been no Calvary unless there had been a Garden of Gethsemane there have been no doubts at Calvary unless there had been in death to his will and he prayed in Gethsemane not my will but thine be done when people are confronted with a bad Spirit or a bad situation or or circumstance in life psychology says that we don't do one of the two things fight or flight we're taught we either human beings will fight all right I'm ready to fight back Oh They'll run did you know in this excellent way neither of those are are right that's psychology that's a human being that's what we do we're going to get our fist out or we're going to get our guns out we're going to fight for this fight for my own way or we're going to run and that's not always good either so we learn to fight for our own will we learn to fight for our way and sometimes you're confronted with that decision and I've been confronted with these things over and over again an embarrassing humbly thing thing in a decision do I eat Humble Pie do I take the more excellent way do I die to myself or do I respond like 99 of other human beings respond respond to confrontation and to evil and to be being done wrong that's the decision every believer will be faced with do I respond the normal response do I fight do I fight do I respond by could I say that a big a big majority of Christians respond the same carnal way or do I say Lord you've got a more excellent way and it's not fight or flight It's Your Love being released I want to make a reference to the word Christian first time I was mentioned in Acts 11 26 they were first called Christians at Antioch and the writer Barry petite says the original Greek word for Christian is christianos which comes from the two Greek words Christ and shun the word Christ means anointed and Chun means little so the word Christian literally means little anointed ones so Christian does not mean like I used to think christ-like and we're following we're duplicating how Christ would treat people and we're putting that on we're not putting anything on Christian means a little anointed one and that means you have the same holy spirit that was in him in your life he goes on to say so the word Christian Legend means little anointed ones during his life Jesus was called Messiah which meant the anointing one and we heard his little anointed ones who have been anointed by his holy spirit to represent him in this world interestingly the word Christian is only found three times in the Bible however how do you know if you are truly a Christian I can say I I can say I'm in a car because I can't say I'm a car because I'm in a garage or uh if I'm surrounded by a chicken fence that doesn't mean I'm a chicken I believe being a Christian is more than just saying a few words but is rather a changed life and a new way of living life according to the scripture it's the life that's in Christ that has to be in you and thus Christian takes on a deeper meaning it's not just you join Church you signed a membership you shook the pastor's hand or you gave heavy in the plate that doesn't make you a Christian but it's having the Holy Ghost is what made them Christians and they said of the book of Acts Church they said they took note after they've seen certain signs take place in the Believers they took note they've been with Jesus now some of those disciples after the upper room there's just 3 000 Souls saved some of them worked physically with Christ but they took note the disciples had been with Jesus many others but some of them hadn't been physically with Jesus but they said they've been with Jesus why because his Same Spirit is in them they're doing the same works and didn't Jesus say that the works that I do shall you do also can I get an amen tonight he said the works that I do shall the Believers do also so it's not it's not us imitating Christ it's it's being Christ and thus that love is released to the people now that are the the confrontations the the the the the the the disappointments the people that have done you wrong the hatred in this world the persecution whether it's for you're a Christian or whether whatever it is there has to be something without ourselves come inside of ourselves by the Holy Ghost by a new birth that manifests a different response than what a human being would respond well I'm just going to be nice to that person well that's nice to be nice but we're talking about the love of God here and this love is not just some mental exercise This Love In Jesus had power over demonic forces I may believe that love is the strongest force in the world the love of God it has power over demonic forces you don't have power over demonic forces and maybe some of you listening you don't know if there's demonic forces or not there is demonic forces there's a real God there's a real devil there's demons there's hell there's Heaven there's other dimensions the Bible says that can you say Amen so now all this demonic realm is against you especially if you choose to be a believer and filled with the Holy Ghost all of Hell's guns are trained on you how do we fight it not with yourself good luck fighting demonic power on your own good luck fighting demonic power with your mental exercises there's one force that can defeat Satan's demonic power and that's the love of God it says Divine love bears and protects things Divine love believes the best of things first Divine love always has hope for all things Divine love endures and holds up during difficulties love bears all things regardless of what comes it believes all things looking for the best in each one it hopes all things remaining steadfast during difficult times endures all things without weakening it's strong can you say Amen it's faithful can you say Amen it's consistent can you say Amen and uh we find that in these statements that it's positive all of this is positive it's not cynical it's not this oh I'm I'm not sure that you'll make it this is positive it Bears all things it believes all things it's got victory in mind these statements this love has victory in mind no matter what condition you are in this love says you may be in that condition but I'm believing for something better this Divine love is positive that you believe the best in somebody that you believe there's going to be a victory for somebody I like to be around people like that that can correct me but there's a victory in mind that's why I read to the scripture he gives he's given us the victory in Jesus Christ he didn't give us Jesus Christ in Christianity and the message of the last days to bring us defeated people and to go into our Rapture defeated he brought it to in this in a big victory the Rapture is a big victory talk about Satan being upset when the True Believers leave this earth in a Rapture you talk about an ultimate victory it's just like Satan will be laying out completely faded I did everything I could and they're gone and that's it we'll just you just you know fan him just a little bit you know yeah it's a victory for the bride it's getting past what you see to what you don't see and that's faith you can't find a a cynical spirit in this you can't find a sarcastic spirit in this you can't find a doubtful spirit in this you can't find a pessimistic attitude in any of these scriptures of divine love you can't find a pessimist you can't find someone that just always leaves a doubt you'll never make it you're a dirtbag look where you're at that there's a you know you might get help but I doubt it you can't find that in here it Bears all things it believes all things it hopes all things it's steadfast to keep believing all things no matter how many years it takes it's going to keep believing it endures things without weakening that's that's our Father Abraham he endured through doubts through unbelief through all the things he went through his faith remains steadfast I'm gonna believe Sarah Sarah do you feel any different today because he's going to have a son through this old grandma you feel any different today and she's foreign no I don't feel any different Abraham praise the Lord we're going to have a baby anyhow [Music] 25 years how about today Sarah Abraham you asked me that the last 30 days you've asked me the same question I'm sorry I don't feel any different praise God we're going to have a baby anyhow it's a steadfast through the weakening through the enduring things enduring criticism and during whatever it is and incidentally he had some times in the Old Testament Abraham that he didn't look like he acted like that but the New Testament Accord of him or a account of him basically just recorded that he was a man of faith and he believed against hope believed in Hope Divine love is not out to look for the reason to condemn first but the reason to save to create an atmosphere that however bad it looks that there's Redemption there's hope it's Redemption you can find in this in this love you always find redemption in this love you now it's not a lack of Truth it'll never compromise on truth it's someone's living a rebellious life then you can't justify that you can't say they're okay they're not okay but your hope believes that they're gonna be okay someday that God's gonna bring them out of their Rebellion somebody say praise the Lord so this love is not wishy-washy compromising and and justifying things people do but it never finds the condemnation first it tries to say listen I know you're in a state and I know you've done this to me or you've done this to do this and you you've done all these things but listen now I'm going to pray for you because I'm believing all things for you and I believe God can save you it's got positive Hope and Faith in it can you say Amen so to create an atmosphere however bad it looks where there's Redemption if you do this with your kids your kids will be a lot healthier in life in this atmosphere in the home of a positive there's always redemption in every mistake Lord help us parents help us parents that they get corrected and they know where they're wrong and they feel conviction don't raise kids that don't you're going to cover and get get rid of all convictions good they need to feel bad for what they've done but they needed to be a positive atmosphere that that's not a judge of your character you're going to come out of that thing you're going to be better for it uh create a home like that create an atmosphere where there's Redemption so first it's a the first confession is to speak Faith and Hope not a denial of the person's condition not that not a denial of truth but speaking positive instead of negative First the power and power the power of death and life are in the tongue can you say Amen not looking for the negative First Christians and our friend our Christian friends they have a duty in the right thing to expose something that's wrong in my life and wrong in your life that if they don't do that for me or you it's not love love is corrective love is corrective this world and the church World removes all the correction in love that's not love God corrects us because he loves us so you don't remove this love doesn't remove the correction but but it's the type of correction that has value in it it has something no father that father is correct for their own benefit the Hebrews talks about it but he says our father corrects us for our own benefit that we could bring forth the fruits later he's got the fruits in mind he's got the victory in mind so he may correct you but he's got something in mind there's a victory for the correction there's a victory coming at the end of the correction help our parenting to be that way Lord help our parenting to be that way the ultimate end is a victory over something it's a positive hope over something can you say Amen you're not defeated for life because you made a mistake you're not doomed for life because you made a mistake make a mistake own up to it bring it to the cross go on with God There's Hope in that I love being around someone who has a value for the god in me can you say I don't want to be around people that just that they don't ever correct me that's that's immature but I want to be around someone who has the value for God in Me and they encourage that God in Me and they have a welcoming spirit that I can come to and if they have a welcoming spirit and they've got Divine love expressed to me I can listen to them when they come to correct me is this okay with everybody the gospel is good news it's good telling it's a good story it's the true uh can you say it man it's it's something that ends in a victory there's always a victory it's not just a story but has power with it there's power under the salvation of it there's power for redemption in the love of God I'm going to say it again there is Supernatural power in Redemption and in the cross and in the blood and in his Spirit there's power for Redemption for salvation of any situation I wouldn't stay in a church that did not preach against sin or against hell and the nature of sin why because it's in the Bible and so if it's in the Bible it needs to be preached but when you preach at hell when you preach the truth when you breach conviction to me which I'd love to have more preachers preaching conviction but when you preach it to me please preach the gospel with it preach it in its power and give me a Lifeline give me something to deliver my life from that hell don't just preach hell but give me a Lifeline give me a way out don't give me an intellectual sermon on the blood preach conviction under the word with no denominational restraints and let the life come from that gospel to save me there's life in the blood can you say Amen tonight you can't have access to the blood without the full word it's not a symbol in the cross it's a power it's a substance of the Life of Christ preach that to me preach out to me give me a lifeline give me something to grab a hold of that if I Repent he's going to save me from my situation somebody said praise the Lord this is this is a positive thing but it's not positive thinking people think that the gospel now they've preached on TV and everything it's it's it's positive thinking the blood is not just positive thinking in the mind of positive thinking it expresses confidence and hope that something is going to happen you see if you just talk positive thinking there's no blood in that there's no power in that oh there's the power of a mind that can think the the what's the the book called The Power of Positive Thinking yeah there's a certain power but with that they were building the Tower of Babel it was positive thinking that built the Tower of Babel till God himself said if we don't confuse their language I can't stop the power of their positive thinking seminars positive thinking seminars rebuilding the Tower of Babel because something completely against God so we're not when we when we look at the Divine love of God this isn't positive thinking this is the has the blood in it and it's a positive hope that the power of the blood can change you and bring a real victory in your life it's positive because the blood has positive effects always praise be to God the blood always has positive effects the blood will always have problems the blood will always cause us to Triumph Triumph the blood will always bring the victory in our life there is no defeat in the blood of Jesus Christ there is none we will always Triumph through Christ thank you for watching our
