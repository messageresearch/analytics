Matthew 11 and verse 11. verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he what a amazing scripture tonight to realize that when we take someone like John the Baptist who had the spirit of Elijah on him and such a powerful Ministry to introduce the Messiah coming the first time then we realize that he ends this verse by saying there's not risen greater than John the Baptist not withstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than John the Baptist so this we look at things in levels and certain positions and they the world teaches us we're in certain High positions low positions but in the kingdom of God the least the least one among in the Kingdom of the least one that we would feel as the least and has no popularity has no position has every bit of the power of God available to them can you say amen and that's why he can see the least in the kingdom is greater than he God certainly puts his prophets in a place and a special place to speak through them but the prophets are not a special place where they get all of the power of God from Calvary every believer gets that from the greatest to the least and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence I quoted this a couple weeks ago I can't remember all that I was preaching on but I know I was talking about the dimensions and how that the dimensions of demon the dimensions of the demon demonic forces increase more and I quoted this scripture and I have a few things to say tonight just relation to this scripture because the Bible pinpoints the time of Elijah who John Master had the spirit of Elijah since he came and began speaking from that time the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence from the Demonic realm so something triggers all that realm and I was talking about uh you know just the dimension of Hell spilling over into our Dimension and those things and this this gives the trigger for it where it becomes worse and that is when John the Baptist came and began to speak with the spirit of Elijah the Kingdom of Heaven suffered a violent attack from the Demonic realm um and then here I wanted to add this one in Luke 16 and verse 16 if you wouldn't mind Luke 16 16. it says here the law and the prophets were until John since that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and every man presseth into it so here's another pinpointing time to from the prophet John with the spirit of Elijah and when you hit that point because of the increase in the Demonic realm from that point of Elijah speaking then we realize that I'll just word it the way they say it here the king he says it here the kingdom of God is preached and every man does what if you want to get a hold of it you got to press into it one to finish that scripture in Matthew I'll finish the rest of it it says from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and I didn't finish it and the violent take it by force I think it's interesting to realize that this is referring to John the Baptist as being uh when he spoke his word for the for the Messiah to come there was a turning point in the the pressures and a turning point in the Demonic realm to begin coming against the kingdom of God more than it was before Elijah spoke and I want to just emphasize that to you the the scripture pinpoints a time that when Elijah speaks something and he and that word goes into the land that that from that point there is a there's an anger there's a there's a stirring up of the Demonic realm there's a change that the Demonic realm was always there and it's always come against the word of God it's always thwarted the people God trying to hinder the people of God but there's something increased after Elijah's word goes out into the land something about Elijah's word that has power in it that when it goes forth once that word is spoken and it is sent out then it's in the land and one of the things that devil don't like about it is he's watched this pattern of Elijah when he speaks something God's word doesn't return void and Elijah's word had such a power of God behind it that Satan has learned once Elijah says it and it's in the land Elijah can even die but the word is there and the word will not return void in other words Elijah can die but the word is going to accomplish everything that Elijah said and now we have a history to watch because every time that Spirit was on a man everything that it said ended up coming to pass so there's something about it and maybe that's why the Demonic realm gets so tense and increases its pressure against the people of God it's not just because of you Satan doesn't Satan doesn't come against you because he doesn't like your personality or your looks or some personal thing or it has nothing to do with that it's the word that you received you are becoming that word and Satan knows if that word is in the land and you're becoming that word he's learned through history there's not anything he can do to stop it Elijah's word was so powerful that when it's in the land it affected the whole land his word went out Elijah could go off the scene and his still his word is still laying there ready to be fulfilled now if you go back in your Bibles to the Days of Elijah when he spoke something he said it's not even not even do with fall there's no rain until I call for it okay now he might have spoken that in a little Hut beside a tree I'd have to go back and read to remind myself where he spoke it he might have spoken to just a few people but it affected the entire land this one man who's Elijah he's a nobody Elijah's by Tish bite who's a dish bite never heard of this guy where did he come from but guess what his word was so powerful it stopped rain in the whole land you can't mess with God's word you can't mess with God's Messengers and when he spoke that rain no rain all of a sudden everything stopped up a famine in the entire land affected everybody and the No Rain affected everybody and then Elijah called for rain again and then he had The Showdown boy I could go into Elijah's life but I just want to make one boy when he began to speak it affected everybody and guess what it made the Jezebels mad I don't know what kind of woman she was before but when Elijah spoke is when she became angry and the demons increased I don't know she might have been a nice person I don't know before that but it was Elijah's word that triggered this vicious anger I'm gonna kill the man I'm going after him and actually Elijah he just kind of went and hid a bit you know and uh but but that's what triggered is this anger that's coming up what's why why would the World Council of churches in the Union begin to start and begin to form a union of churches in Christianity against the Bride of Jesus Christ it's the Jezebel spirit it becomes angry at the word of Elijah if you believe this message you're a target of the enemy you say well I don't I'm not living where I should be completely but I believe with all my heart I believe God's going to deliver me I believe I'm going to be a full matured adopted son of God I'm going to keep seeking the Holy Ghost I'm going to keep seeking him when you confess that you become Satan's greatest Target not because of you but because the word of Elijah and the word of God you've taken it into your bosom I'm resting in his word and there's a violent and increased violent attack against the kingdom of God and the people because Jesus said he said don't look for it somewhere else the kingdom of God is within you where's the kingdom it's not out here in the air it's in the people I'm preaching to unite his kingdom is within you and there's a violent attack against you because you hold the kingdom there's a when when John the Baptist spoke he said Elijah spoke as soon as that happened there was a triggering of all the Demonic realm and since then it's increased look how the Demonic realm has increased plaguing people's minds blazing not just sicknesses plaguing Minds sickness of the Mind why is it it's the enemy increasing his demonic forces against the elect I always like to say this you know he had 120 that come out of the upper room and uh Satan was going to you know what am I going to do with these because I had one to deal with in Jesus and now I got 120 to deal with and then thousands of souls were saved and this was multiplying by the hour and Satan's going I had one to deal with I thought I put him in the ground he must be alive because the same Spirits in these people it's because when you plant that seed in the ground a crop's going to come up it was just a few days instead of one Jesus to deal with instead of one Jesus to deal with he had 120 jesuses to deal with and within days he had thousands of Jesus to deal with they took note they had been with Jesus the world says these people they're like Jesus we're going to start calling them Christians which means partisans of Christ followers of Christ but it wasn't just they were followers or Christ they could see the same works the same raising the Dead the same walking in the shadow Peter cometh they come in the shadow of Peter and someone come back out as a leper Miracles took place where's Jesus at now Satan's having to deal with all kinds of it I believe that demonic forces increase in a violent way against the kingdom when this bride gets a hold of the word but a lot of times people don't talk about convictions and principles when it comes to sexual Temptation and we've been talking about those things a lot of people don't talk about them but I've tried to make the point that when you're living here in Satan's Eden and you're living in the manifestation of Sodom and Gomorrah the complete manifestation of it and you're raising children or you're a young person okay just think about it now if you know it's in the last thrust of Satan with demonic power of sexual Temptation nakedness homosexuality pornography all these things easy available then how should we be responding to that kind of onslaught of the enemy I tell you it'll take more than just laying back and saying I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ praise God I go to church on Sunday morning glory be to God I'm just going to live my life no I think if Satan's kingdom increases a violence against us that's the days of a forceful response back from the people of God and that's why I said that's why I've said that people criticize a bit sometimes that were too strict our church is too strict about courtship about dating we got all these guidelines and all every time I turn around there's another rule I just asked you a question I don't want to become a legalist but how legal how how strong can you be to speak about these things to give our young people some boundaries why would we have loose boundaries in a day that's increasing sex such lustful sexual uh perversion can you say Amen why am I being criticized for being too strict can we be too strict you don't have to say Amen to that but can we be can we be to the place that we gotta we shut our mouths and just let them do and let them all work it out I'm sorry my friend I love them too much in this age and I know demons too much I'm going to give them the word of God and practical things to live by so they can overcome in this age now I if I was back in Luther's day if I if I wasn't in the full manifestation of Sodom and Gomorrah then I may not preach on those things I might not give specific boundaries as far as a guy and girl and dating all that I may not talk about it but in this age under these modern conditions we got to talk about it according to the word of God because when the Kingdom of Heaven is suffering a violent attack the violent take it by force I got to get the kingdom I got to get a hold of it I got to give it to the young people and and as he said since that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and and those people press into it what's the other scripture he said the law and prophets were until and since that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and every man must press into it you're not going to get it by just a lazy you know lackadaisical kind of yeah okay I heard that before again no Every Man Has to press into the kingdom of God it's a forceful response to the enemy it's it's Satan it's it's a confession it's a forceful confession back he's talking to your mind and talking to your heart and beating you down there has to be a response to that devil speaking to you there has to be a force responsible well I just feel weak and I'll let the preachers do that I need to you know I'll tell you you can get enough strength that if you're not around account meeting you're not around a prayer line you don't have to wait till next year to the prayer line you get enough faith in your heart you can start confessing Satan Satan get out of here that's the kind of body of Christ we need that every day we're given a forceful response an aggressive response to this enemy not a lazy response a four you know and and there are situations that come up sometimes that uh make us that should make us angry with the Holy uh indignation towards the enemy not towards one another but towards the devil sometimes we don't get fed up enough with the Enemy and when we're not fed up with them we don't rise with a forceful response and he just walks over you every day because we're not fed up with them we're not angry enough about it don't get angry at people don't get angry at one another don't get angry at your husband get angry at the Devil I give you permission you know as preachers we preach be nice to people be kind bring your anger to the Lord Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath don't get angry and anger is bad except for I'm giving permission tonight get angry at the Devil all you want to because some of you need to be angry at the Devil you're not mad enough you're not angry enough so he's walking all over you sometimes because you're not mad enough at him trying to take your family time to take your marriage trying to take your joy you don't get mad enough about it you get angry about it can you say Amen I'd be the times that we live in Friends I wonder if we should stay mad at our enemy we preach against anger and stay sweet stay loving but I wonder if that cross is over and how we treat our enemy who keeps robbing us and taking us things from us we get to lovey-dovey and accept things for life just I just accepted that we really the things that we don't have to really accept can you say Amen some problems we do as we spoke on Sundays some problems we do and we we thank God for his grace but there are other things that we just say no I'm not going to let the devil walk all over me push him back get back stay back trying to get my granddaughter's attention because that's what she always says stay back Ellie stay back stay back that's what we tell the Devil stay back don't tell your parents that stay back Devil stay back Satan stay back bad thought comes to your mind stay back I'm a Child of God you don't belong in my mind you don't belong in my heart you don't belong in my house you don't belong in my car can you say man nobody gave you permission to come around stay back stay back now I got her attention praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight and sometimes we just don't get fed up enough with the devil you know and we get angry at others people get angry at other people pretty easy but they're not angry at the Devil people get easily angry at other people anger at their spouse there was a couple that that were working with financial counseling many years ago and the financial counselor showed them all the stuff they needed to do to get out of debt I think it was the Dave Ramsey program and he put him on it's a great program to get out of debt and uh so they were instructed but at the end of the counseling he he said this thing he says now the instruction was you'll never get out of this even with all the instructions you'll never get out of this unless you get mad at your debt unless you're really angry about being in the ditched and being in the hole that you're in financially you'll never get out you have to be fed up with yourself you have to be fed up with the condition you have to be fed out because debt is a load on you that's terrible that is a bad thing but to get out it's more than just just taking a seminar it's more than psychology you have to be mad at the condition you're in and this counselor every time they met together he would say are you still angry are you still mad because if they lost their Madness and their anger against the condition they were in they would never get out so a part of his counseling I've never done this but it's I love it and I think I'll incorporate it in all my counseling then they come in the office are you I'm just gonna all right first of all are you angry at the Devil that's beating you up are you angry what the devil's doing in your life and in your family's life because if you're not angry and you don't have the grit and the faith to get out you may not get out we've got the word it has power we got the support from the body of Christ we've got the principles we've got the boundaries we've got we've got materials we've got scriptures we can hand it all to you but there has to be a faith to say I don't want to stay where I'm at I want to get victory over the enemy we're gathering together here and the devil's going to know and God's going to know that we're Binding Together because whatsoever we bind on Earth is bound in heaven everybody remember the commission to the church he said to the church whatever you bite on Earth will be bind in heaven say not bind any spirit that would try to bring my children bad dreams I bind any Spirit that's trying to bring a bad spirit in my home he stops at the door here I apply the blood of Jesus Christ over this whole household tonight you see what I'm saying it's not a lazy response it's a farceful response I mean business with this devil if he's going to violently attack this Kingdom I'm going to violently respond to him set grit to rise up that's that grit that just arrives that Force Rises and now wait a minute Satan wait a minute I'm a circumcised Holy Ghost filled believer everything Calvary bought for me belongs to me you're not going to rob me of any of it your brothers you think of shangar's position and you think of you you receive Inspire I pray you'd receive inspiration because it's the fathers and the heads of the homes and the men that really catch need to catch this more than any of them today you think of the inspiration that rising up the anger in shamgar that little farmer who didn't know how to go against 600 Philistines but he did he grabbed an ox code that shamgar didn't have any sword he didn't know nothing about how to use one he didn't have a shield but if he'd had a shield he wouldn't have known how to use it but he reached up and he got an ox gold that's an old stick that's got a brass lump on the end of it they beat the ox through the coral with it and he jumped out of that window out there in the middle of that road against 600 armed Philistine and killed every one of them Hallelujah ask my brother can you say man that's my brother shamgar and the shamgars need to rise up tonight and say that's devil that's enough today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if you would like to come and visit us in person consider this your
