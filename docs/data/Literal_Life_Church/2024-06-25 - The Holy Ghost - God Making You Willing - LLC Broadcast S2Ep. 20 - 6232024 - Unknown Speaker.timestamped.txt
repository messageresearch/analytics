[4:07] his
[4:13] for Ezekiel
[4:17] 36 and starting at verse 24 for I will
[4:21] take you from among the Heathen and
[4:23] gather you out of all countries and will
[4:25] bring you into your own land then will I
[4:28] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[4:30] shall be clean from all of your
[4:32] filthiness and from all of your Idols
[4:34] will I cleanse you a new heart also will
[4:37] I give you and a new spirit will I put
[4:40] within you and I will take away the
[4:42] Stony Stony heart out of your flesh and
[4:44] I will give you a heart of Flesh and I
[4:47] will put my spirit within you and cause
[4:49] you to walk in my statues and ye shall
[4:52] keep my judgments and do them ye shall
[4:55] dwell in the land that I gave your
[4:56] fathers and ye shall be my people and I
[4:58] will be your God
[5:00] I will also save you from all your
[5:02] uncleanness and I will call for the corn
[5:04] and will increase it and lay no famine
[5:06] upon you and I will multiply the fruit
[5:09] of the tree I don't know if any of you
[5:11] are sitting there saying this is for me
[5:13] this morning but you ought to take this
[5:14] promise for you individually say
[5:16] whatever he said he's going to do and I
[5:18] receive it I will multiply the fruit of
[5:22] the tree and increase the field that ye
[5:23] shall receive no more reproach of famine
[5:26] among the Heathen then shall you
[5:27] remember your own evil ways and doings
[5:30] that were not good and shall loath
[5:32] yourselves in your own sight for your
[5:33] iniquities for you and for your
[5:36] Abominations not for your sakes do I
[5:38] this sayith the Lord God be it known
[5:40] unto you be ashamed and confounded for
[5:42] your own ways oh House of Israel thus
[5:45] sayith the Lord God in the day that I
[5:47] shall have cleansed you from all your
[5:49] iniquities I will also cause you to
[5:52] dwell in the cities and the waste shall
[5:54] be builded and the desolate land shall
[5:57] be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the
[6:00] sight uh of all that passed by and they
[6:03] shall say this land that was desolate is
[6:07] become like the Garden of Eden and the
[6:10] waste and desolate and ruined cities are
[6:13] become fenced are inhabited did anybody
[6:16] catch after he does all of this to
[6:18] Israel then it doesn't stop he said I'll
[6:21] restore you back back to what it was at
[6:23] Eden again I'll restore it completely
[6:26] back to Eden again I'll tell you you're
[6:28] under a restoration that doesn't go
[6:31] halfway this is significant today cuz it
[6:34] doesn't look like Israel is heading in a
[6:35] good place there physically but this is
[6:37] God's promise right here and someday the
[6:40] desolate place will come back like a
[6:42] Garden of Eden again for God's people
[6:45] apply this to yourself and we say thank
[6:47] God that you're doing this work in my
[6:49] life speak we left off with the first
[6:51] reference to the holy ghost in the Old
[6:54] Testament the first main reference and
[6:56] that was in Isaiah 28 where it says for
[6:58] all tables are full of vomit and
[7:00] filthiness so that there's no place
[7:02] clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom
[7:04] Shall you make to understand Doctrine
[7:06] them that are wean from the milk and
[7:08] drawn from the breast for precept must
[7:10] be upon precept precept upon precept
[7:13] line upon line line upon line here a
[7:15] little and there a little for with
[7:17] stammering lips and another tongue will
[7:19] I speak to this people to whom he said
[7:21] this is the rest wherewith ye may cause
[7:24] the weary to rest and this is the
[7:27] refreshing yet they would not hear but
[7:29] the word of the Lord was unto them
[7:31] precept upon precept line upon line here
[7:34] a little and there a little that they
[7:36] might go and fall backward and be broken
[7:38] and snared and taken so the text says
[7:41] when this Holy Ghost comes there'll be
[7:43] many resist it and resist the Holy Ghost
[7:46] but thank God there will be some to
[7:47] receive it so the conclusion of Isaiah
[7:50] 28 just to summarize is that in these
[7:53] scriptures we find that what is tied to
[7:56] the Holy Ghost is it is the fresh food
[7:58] coming it's not it's a fresh word of the
[8:01] hour that he sends the Holy Ghost to
[8:03] make real and so if it's old food vomit
[8:07] he says your tables are full of vomit
[8:09] that's all regurgitated food so when God
[8:13] sends the Holy Ghost it's to identify
[8:15] himself with the word for that hour and
[8:18] it is a fresh word that comes it is the
[8:21] word for the hour so when we're looking
[8:23] at the evidences of the Holy Ghost and
[8:25] wanting to know what it is it's tied to
[8:27] the word of God it's evidence is tied to
[8:30] the word cuz it keeps saying line upon
[8:32] line precept upon precept here a little
[8:34] there a little it's tied to the word
[8:37] being line upon line not outside of the
[8:40] not the outside manifestation of
[8:42] stammering lips that will be the outside
[8:45] manifestation but the inside is it's
[8:48] tied to the word the people will come
[8:50] for the word of that day the Holy Ghost
[8:52] will fill them to make that word live
[8:55] that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[8:58] and then it says it's the rest
[8:59] how many believe the Holy Ghost is a
[9:01] rest it's the refreshing can you say
[9:03] Amen if it's a rest then it's it's not
[9:06] something that's complicated if it's a
[9:08] rest he don't send the Holy Ghost to
[9:09] make your life more
[9:11] confused Jesus said come unto me all you
[9:14] that are weary and heavy laden and I'll
[9:16] give you rest he's talking about the
[9:18] Holy Ghost so when he comes he doesn't
[9:21] make a struggle over works and I got to
[9:23] gain my entrance into heaven no the Holy
[9:25] Ghost when it comes into your life is to
[9:27] bring rest it is the refreshing it is
[9:29] the rest that comes to your life and the
[9:32] biggest rest is in your soul that I
[9:33] don't have to work my way into heaven
[9:35] that he comes changes your nature can
[9:38] you say amen and I'm at peace with
[9:40] God going in a Rapture that's a rest
[9:44] Jesus God when he when he spoke from the
[9:47] beginning he had to rest in his own word
[9:49] after six days of creating then he went
[9:51] into a Sabbath and you know what he was
[9:53] resting on the word that he already
[9:55] spoke right God has already spoke his
[9:57] word and the Holy Ghost as you enter
[10:00] into rest that he's already spoken and
[10:02] it'll be done that's what the scripture
[10:04] is saying and then the last thing some
[10:06] would reject the line upon line for word
[10:08] for their day and this fits with step's
[10:11] rebuke just before he was stoned by the
[10:13] Jews he looks up and he says these words
[10:16] which is pretty Stern and we might get
[10:18] get back into this in a subject of the
[10:20] Holy Ghost ye do always resist the Holy
[10:23] Ghost as your fathers did he's speaking
[10:25] to religious leaders you're resisting
[10:27] the word for your hour you're resisting
[10:30] the Holy Ghost as your fathers did and
[10:33] the the opposite then of resisting is
[10:35] what the opposite of resisting the Holy
[10:37] Ghost is
[10:39] believing it's just that simple God
[10:42] needs a believing
[10:43] heart God needs you to believe God needs
[10:46] you to trust all the stuff that he wants
[10:48] to do to you here in Ezekiel and change
[10:50] your life it it comes by his person that
[10:53] begins to believe not up but really
[10:56] believe it I believe it and you start
[10:58] saying Lord I believe this I don't see
[10:59] it yet in my life but I believe it now
[11:02] we move to the next place in the Old
[11:03] Testament that emphasizes the Holy Ghost
[11:06] and that's in Ezekiel 36 the scriptures
[11:08] that I read to you and of course the
[11:11] scriptures is Naturally Speaking of
[11:13] Israel's restoration as a nation what he
[11:16] will do in the last days for his people
[11:19] what he does to Israel as a nation he
[11:21] does to you as an individual he worked
[11:23] as an individual to the Gentiles and he
[11:27] works as a nation to Israel true true so
[11:30] whatever he does in Prophecy to Israel
[11:33] as a nation he's doing to you as an
[11:36] individual always forget that always we
[11:39] always forget the fact that we that we
[11:42] are somehow uh looking at this like a
[11:44] group effort I'm in the message I'm I go
[11:47] to the message meetings I'm this that
[11:49] and the other but we should never look
[11:51] at this I want to see more Unity If the
[11:53] message churches I want to see more
[11:55] unity in the
[11:57] bride and when I think of the Bride I
[11:59] don't just think of certain churches
[12:02] under a certain label that's not how he
[12:04] deals with the Gentiles oh if they could
[12:06] all just come I'm not so sure every
[12:09] technical church is going to come in
[12:10] Oneness and unity but the bride will
[12:13] individuals
[12:15] will I don't even know if everyone in
[12:17] our own assembly I'd like everybody to
[12:19] but would come into the Oneness like
[12:21] Pentecost again I don't know if you will
[12:23] because this is not a church effort this
[12:25] is an individual effort and he will have
[12:27] a bride from every Nation from all the
[12:30] churches can you say amen I don't know
[12:32] who his bride is but she will come into
[12:34] unity and she will be in a Rapture so be
[12:37] careful that you w always you're just
[12:39] looking for everybody and all the
[12:41] preachers to agree and all this I think
[12:43] that's not what God looks at it he deals
[12:45] with Israel as a nation he deals with
[12:48] you as an individual that's why he could
[12:50] say if you want your church to have a
[12:52] Revival don't wait around for everybody
[12:55] else let the Revival start in you
[12:59] that's right and it'll break out other
[13:01] places so what God does to Israel as a
[13:05] nation he does to the individual and the
[13:07] end result to Ezekiel 36 is that I the
[13:11] end result is in verse uh it would be
[13:16] 27 I will put my spirit within
[13:22] you that's what he wants to
[13:24] do now don't let that become common to
[13:28] you
[13:30] please that is that is a huge thing that
[13:34] God in our sin in our Humanity in our
[13:38] Brokenness in our flub UPS if in in our
[13:42] nature that we're born with because
[13:43] everybody knows from what I've been
[13:45] preaching you were born with the wrong
[13:46] nature in you but with all of our
[13:49] baggage with everything that we got God
[13:52] said I'm going to take that all that
[13:54] baggage I'm going to take you
[13:57] on and I'm going to click you I'm going
[13:59] to take you from the Heathen I'm going
[14:01] to I'm going to cleanse you with
[14:03] sprinkle you with water and then I've
[14:05] got to change your Stony heart and then
[14:07] I've got to do this is what I want to
[14:09] talk about today and all of it there's
[14:11] you have nothing to do with it I'm
[14:13] taking you on as my
[14:16] masterpiece Lord and my end result is to
[14:19] prepare a place a tabernacle In Your
[14:22] Vessel that I would actually put my
[14:25] spirit within
[14:27] you this is the Holy Ghost
[14:32] amall I say praise the
[14:35] Lord so we've already learned in this
[14:38] that we are his workmanship so we see
[14:40] here how he leads and does the work from
[14:42] the beginning he does it all I mentioned
[14:44] nine times in these verses he mentions
[14:47] the word I I will bring you from the
[14:49] other countries I will give you a new
[14:51] spirit I will change your Stony heart I
[14:54] will change your spirit I is mentioned
[14:57] nine times and you're not in there there
[14:59] except what God's doing to
[15:01] you you didn't go to any seminars to
[15:05] make yourself better you didn't put any
[15:06] bandaids on it you don't own there some
[15:09] Theologian God said I'm I'm it's a
[15:11] personal
[15:14] pronoun I love you so much I'll take you
[15:17] as you are but I won't leave you as you
[15:19] are and God can take the worst sinner
[15:22] give me your worst cases God says I will
[15:25] take you on and I will love you out of
[15:29] your mess and then when I'm done I will
[15:32] actually put my spirit within you
[15:34] somebody ought to sh shout and say
[15:35] praise the
[15:36] Lord you better not take that for
[15:39] granted that you're just a church M cuz
[15:42] I preach to some church MERS I preach to
[15:44] the body of Christ I preach to church
[15:45] members but God wants to make you more
[15:47] than a church member more than ones that
[15:49] just comes and raises your hand God says
[15:52] I want to put my spirit within you we
[15:55] are his workmanship so he says I'll do
[15:57] it it's not your works from start to
[15:59] finish it's him if you will believe and
[16:01] receive put yourself for your in other
[16:04] words the only thing that you can do is
[16:06] put yourself in an obedience to him say
[16:09] Okay Lord I'm going to climb up on the
[16:11] potter's
[16:13] wheel because you're the
[16:16] Potter it's quiet here but I want to ask
[16:18] every person in this room I don't care
[16:20] if you're a visitor or you've been with
[16:22] me 305 years how willing are you to
[16:26] bring yourself and put yourself up on
[16:28] the Potter's will
[16:30] and don't leave you stay there for the
[16:32] rest of your life how many would trust
[16:34] God and say I'm ready to put myself on
[16:37] The Potter's will you mold me you cuz
[16:40] when when that Potter he's got all that
[16:43] stuff and you see that big lump of clay
[16:45] there and he just starts to work his
[16:47] hands on your life and get off all CU he
[16:49] sees the image of what you'll be you
[16:51] don't but he sees it and he just keeps
[16:54] working and keeps working and tearing
[16:56] things off your life tearing that
[16:57] smoking drinking and gambling and gaming
[17:00] bad gaming and and and pornography and
[17:03] all that and you just you just you just
[17:05] all you did was get up on the Potter's
[17:10] will I'm not perfect today except for
[17:13] the blood of Jesus
[17:15] Christ but I've kept my life on the
[17:17] Potter's will God comes and does the
[17:19] work he doesn't make us go against the
[17:21] will but he makes us willing to go
[17:23] that's what I see here in Ezekiel
[17:24] 36 and don't put yourself in your own
[17:27] time frames of when God's going to do
[17:29] this that's where we get in trouble I I
[17:32] do see a process here of God working on
[17:35] us to get us ready to receive his
[17:38] spirit I believe it's a growth I believe
[17:40] it's a process but nobody knows the time
[17:42] fras frames and the process for you and
[17:46] the process for me and if you put your
[17:48] own time frames on it say okay I need to
[17:50] reach this I've had Minister say okay I
[17:52] have how can I come up to the pyramid
[17:54] okay so I've got faith I need virtue now
[17:56] I need knowledge Temperance patience I
[17:58] got this and and and so they're trying
[18:00] to work it all out and brother BR says
[18:03] God births everything every one of those
[18:05] things he births into you so he's still
[18:08] doing it so I could okay got virtue now
[18:11] on to the next one Lord we don't know
[18:13] what he's doing we just submit
[18:15] ourselves we know when we got more
[18:18] patience you like wow something's
[18:19] happened to me cuz I would have bit that
[18:22] guy's head off
[18:24] before Something's Happened to me the
[18:27] love of God has taken over
[18:29] am so we don't put time frames because
[18:34] it I just say in his it's in his time in
[18:37] his season we just submit ourselves to
[18:40] God can you say amen and I do believe we
[18:42] offer a desperation to God that was the
[18:45] message after the token the Holy Ghost
[18:46] is desperation because God likes to see
[18:49] a desperation God let me just say it
[18:52] this way to be simple this
[18:53] morning how can you receive his Spirit
[18:57] the holy ghost in your life if you
[18:59] haven't even asked for
[19:03] it he likes to hear you
[19:06] ask he likes to really want
[19:10] it oh Lord he just give it to me
[19:13] whenever he feels I'm not preaching that
[19:15] this morning I'm looking for a
[19:17] desperation to say God I'm asking for
[19:19] this thing of your spirit I need it now
[19:21] more than ever the time is short and I'm
[19:24] not doing it just to to evade hell I'm
[19:26] doing because I need this in my life
[19:28] there's too many demon powers trying to
[19:30] lead me into pornography and into the
[19:32] things of the world and lust and all
[19:34] these other things I need your spirit
[19:36] living in me asking you shall receive
[19:39] knocking it shall be open to you he
[19:41] likes us to be desperate and the asking
[19:44] but we don't do the work and let me say
[19:46] you something about your time frames
[19:48] okay that you put on God and try to
[19:50] diagnose where you're at and diagnose
[19:52] where the rest of the people
[19:54] are we're so good at diagnosing where
[19:58] people are in their Christian walk can I
[20:00] get an amen we're professionals we're
[20:03] we're Fruit
[20:05] inspectors we're going to examine the
[20:07] fruit in everybody else but they're not
[20:10] too good at it as far as
[20:12] ourselves but we do it in everybody else
[20:14] and then we think no we know where we're
[20:16] at and I you know one fell sometime in
[20:19] the office says we're in a really good
[20:20] place right now yeah we're we're in a
[20:22] good place we're in a good place and and
[20:24] I'm seeing otherwise I'm trying to share
[20:25] with them as a pastor now there's
[20:26] something you know there's some things
[20:28] you need to take to the Cross I'm
[20:29] encouraging you there's a pastor some
[20:31] things you you you need to talk about
[20:33] with your family and such but to him hey
[20:35] everything was everything's hunky dory
[20:37] but you see now oh you can only pray
[20:39] because it's in God's timing God would
[20:41] Open the Eyes of every one of us to see
[20:44] where we're
[20:45] at but God has his own timing and let me
[20:49] say this God can do more in one
[20:51] moment that's right you say all this
[20:55] process he can do it he can do it just
[20:57] like that right
[20:59] right we know that that new birth just
[21:03] like sin happened in a moment and we all
[21:05] of sons after the first Adam we were
[21:08] born in sin by a Moment of going against
[21:10] the word of God now all of a sudden in a
[21:12] moment all of humanity fell under Adam
[21:15] and Eve we didn't even do that we
[21:18] inherited
[21:19] it in a moment that happened well if it
[21:22] can happen in sin in a moment in a
[21:25] moment God can change a life when you
[21:27] open your heart a moment he can do a lot
[21:29] of things because he's doing it so in a
[21:32] moment he could do more than you could
[21:35] ever do polishing yourself up for
[21:39] years don't put time frames of God just
[21:41] say my life is in his
[21:45] hands if you don't put it in his hands
[21:48] you can slow up God's work how many
[21:50] knows if you don't put your life in
[21:52] God's hand you'll slow up his work in
[21:54] ezel Ezekiel 36 I think you can slow
[21:57] down this process go God wants to do it
[21:59] but if you don't put your life
[22:00] completely in his hands you slow up the
[22:02] process but I remind you of a promise
[22:05] all the father have given me will
[22:08] come that's what I preached the first
[22:10] time in the in the uh series on the Holy
[22:12] Ghost all the father given and I always
[22:14] say this those have been me with with me
[22:16] for years if you're a son or daughter of
[22:18] God you're either going to come hard or
[22:21] you're going to come
[22:22] easy but God's God's not going to let
[22:25] you go when I read Ezekiel 36 again last
[22:28] night I thought
[22:31] Lord I'll just say it to you guys you're
[22:34] a piece of
[22:36] work now I look that up and that can
[22:39] have an A positive connotation but today
[22:42] it has a negative because when
[22:43] somebody's mad he say you're a real
[22:44] piece of
[22:45] work and Ezekiel 36 36 must say to us
[22:50] all of us he's got to pull you from the
[22:53] me he's got to give you you got a Stony
[22:55] heart you got a spirit that won't get
[22:56] along with anybody or God you got a a a
[22:59] a will that says I'm going to do my own
[23:01] will and not God's you got all of that
[23:03] you are a piece of work
[23:06] yeah and then God says but I'm taking
[23:09] this piece of work
[23:11] amen and I'm going to do something with
[23:13] it that's right you're a lot of work but
[23:16] when he moves into your life he can take
[23:19] the worst
[23:20] cases blessed be the name of the Lord he
[23:23] can take the worst cases bring me your
[23:26] worst case
[23:31] hallu well I'm not a worst case but I'm
[23:33] here to tell you you're still a piece of
[23:36] work you got things friends I could take
[23:40] the next hour start with myself and
[23:42] start to go through when you
[23:45] come you come with a mind that's been
[23:47] against God you come with a bitterness
[23:50] you come with people hurting you you've
[23:53] got baggage Galore right true you come
[23:57] with a lack of trust trust you come I
[24:00] minister to
[24:02] people the Holy Spirit ministers through
[24:05] me to a lot of people that come from
[24:07] hurtful situations Hallelujah and I hear
[24:10] their past erupt when they get angry
[24:12] about something or when I would preacher
[24:14] when something would happen similar to
[24:16] their past this volcano erupts and they
[24:19] spill out this thing and they're they're
[24:21] not healed from it yet right yeah I'm
[24:24] glad God's put me in this place to
[24:27] minister
[24:29] to people who need healing by the Holy
[24:32] Ghost cuz you're all a piece of work and
[24:36] I am too so God is determined to take
[24:38] the worst cases God's determined to live
[24:40] in you it's not a problem for God you
[24:43] see you're not determined when you come
[24:45] in he's determined thankfully somebody's
[24:48] determined here because when you first
[24:50] come to him you're not that determined
[24:52] you're not determined to receive a
[24:54] spirit you're not determined to change
[24:56] but God was determined for your life
[24:59] you went way out somewhere you went you
[25:01] said I'm leaving this thing I'm leaving
[25:02] this truth but guess what and when you
[25:04] weren't determined when you weren't
[25:06] determined even to come back God was
[25:08] determined for
[25:10] you God had a determination for your
[25:13] life hallelujah hallelujah and so we see
[25:17] then you see it's what we can it's not
[25:20] what we can do but it's what we believe
[25:22] when we submit to him to let him have
[25:24] his way to get desperate for ourselves
[25:26] to get desperate for God I want this
[25:28] this Holy Ghost living in me say it to
[25:30] him this morning I want this Holy Ghost
[25:32] living in me I want to be filled with
[25:34] this Holy
[25:35] Ghost you see do you know this work is a
[25:38] sec this work of the Holy Spirit moving
[25:40] into our lives because I want to talk
[25:42] about when the holy spirit moves into
[25:43] your life just like he moves to bring a
[25:45] message he moved in the days of Christ
[25:47] for his birth and he began to move he
[25:49] gave Joseph A Dream the Holy Ghost the
[25:51] Holy Ghost was doing a lot of things but
[25:53] it was the Holy Ghost moving because
[25:54] he's getting ready to bring the Messiah
[25:56] and do something great so the when the
[25:58] the Holy Ghost begins to move into your
[25:59] life eventually eventually great things
[26:03] begin to happen but when he begins to
[26:05] move it's so similar do you know that
[26:08] when the Holy Ghost moves in your life
[26:11] we find it in the second verse of your
[26:15] Bible what I'm preaching and teaching on
[26:18] a series on the Holy Ghost is in the
[26:20] second verse of your Bible that
[26:23] says you should know it because you
[26:25] learned it in Sunday School in the
[26:27] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[26:29] Earth and the Earth was without
[26:33] form and void
[26:36] empty and darkness was upon the face of
[26:39] the
[26:41] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[26:44] the face of those Waters
[26:49] Glory he already did it for this Earth
[26:52] that's the condition it was in that's
[26:54] the condition you were in but I was
[26:55] raised in the message Darkness was Upon
[26:57] a face of your deep Darkness was on the
[27:00] face of your deep your soul Darkness
[27:03] covers
[27:05] it and you you you would have stayed
[27:08] that way but guess what happened the
[27:09] Holy Ghost moved
[27:12] in might have happened 10 years ago
[27:14] might be happening this morning but when
[27:16] he begins to move upon the face of the
[27:19] waters what begin to happen he took
[27:22] chaos are you listening he took darkness
[27:25] when he moved on it he took chaos and he
[27:28] made it in
[27:31] Eden so if he did that to the Earth why
[27:34] would he just do it to the Earth you're
[27:37] his
[27:38] people so if he moved upon the face of
[27:41] the water and he began to do something
[27:43] for for the earth to make an Eden to
[27:46] take a chaos to take a piece of work
[27:49] like you and turn it into an Eden a
[27:52] fruitful place where God can speak
[27:55] through you and God can use you and you
[27:57] can be cleansed and and all these other
[27:59] things if God did that to the Earth then
[28:01] he can make an Eden in your life as
[28:04] well by what the holy ghost moving upon
