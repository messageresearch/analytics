[0:00] few things from Sunday that I didn't get
[0:02] to and we were actually going to take a
[0:05] different subject tonight and I'll save
[0:07] it for Sunday the Lord's really dealt
[0:08] with us quite deeply on something
[0:11] and but we just felt to wait on that and
[0:14] finish what we started there on Sunday
[0:16] so we're going to read in Ezekiel one of
[0:19] the prophets
[0:20] chapter 36 and when we're talking about
[0:22] Redemption this is one of the greatest
[0:25] scriptures that we can look into in
[0:27] Ezekiel to see not only the power of His
[0:30] Redemption but also the process of
[0:34] redemption because I personally believe
[0:36] it's a process but once we come under
[0:39] the power of His Redemptive power then
[0:42] he launches the process then it's like
[0:45] you're engaged in it and God's
[0:47] engagement and he does it he doesn't go
[0:49] backwards Wonder once you're under the
[0:51] power of redemption there's only one
[0:52] direction that's forward
[0:54] and there's such power in it that
[0:56] despite yourself Redemption is to raise
[0:59] back up Redemption is to redeem back
[1:01] what was lost there's such power and it
[1:03] can only go in One Direction is to give
[1:05] you back everything you lost and it can
[1:07] only go upward amen it's just that
[1:09] powerful and once you come under that
[1:11] and you have to come under that by
[1:13] surrender and submission to him and and
[1:15] just saying Lord be it unto me according
[1:18] to your word amen so
[1:21] I'll just read a small section of
[1:23] scripture here and then we'll come back
[1:25] to the whole uh chapter he says here in
[1:28] verse 25
[1:30] then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:33] you and ye shall be clean from all your
[1:35] filthiness and from all your Idols will
[1:37] I cleanse you a new heart also will I
[1:40] give you and a new spirit what I put
[1:43] within you and I will take away the
[1:46] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:49] give you a heart of Flesh I want you to
[1:52] notice he hasn't said that said yet
[1:54] those words I will put my spirit in your
[1:57] spirit he's this is he's only dealing
[1:59] with your spirit
[2:01] he is only changing your spirit he's
[2:03] only
[2:04] um he's only making your spirit more
[2:06] compliable more get alongable as it were
[2:09] so that you can get along so you can get
[2:12] in a place that you'd receive his spirit
[2:13] so he gives you a new heart he takes
[2:15] away your Stony heart he gives you a new
[2:18] spirit and then after that then he says
[2:21] verse 27 and I will put my spirit within
[2:25] you and cause you to walk in my statues
[2:29] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[2:32] them
[2:34] amen it's not it's that okay I'm gonna
[2:37] do that I'm going to do them no there's
[2:38] something deeper I'll put my spirit in
[2:41] you and I will live it out in you
[2:43] amen Lord bless your word tonight I pray
[2:46] you an anointed father and God you know
[2:49] my heart in these times when we gather
[2:51] together the precious moments we have
[2:53] just a few minutes but I pray the Holy
[2:55] Ghost would speak to every heart even
[2:57] the youngest heart in the name of Jesus
[2:59] we ask it amen God bless you may be
[3:02] seated
[3:03] as I said I wanted to finish what I
[3:05] started there on Sunday in the subject
[3:07] and then leave room for this Sunday the
[3:09] Lord willing to go into something that's
[3:11] really God has dealt deeply with me
[3:13] about and uh but uh on Sunday we were
[3:17] talking about Redemption restoring
[3:19] relationship and I was being a little
[3:22] bit more specific than that and I was
[3:25] talking about on Sunday How Deeply sin
[3:28] uh became embedded in us after the fall
[3:32] in the garden every one of us that were
[3:34] born sin was so embedded in us in our
[3:37] nature it was so deep in us that then we
[3:41] know that the work of redemption has to
[3:43] be a very very deep work because sin was
[3:46] so embedded in us this wasn't a a you
[3:51] know I mean just say it so the children
[3:52] can understand it you know your body
[3:54] goes through many things your your body
[3:57] will have just cuts and bruises uh but
[4:00] then there's other things the body would
[4:02] go through that you receive a disease or
[4:04] you'd get some type of cancer or
[4:06] something like that and that's deeper
[4:08] than just getting a cut or a bruise a
[4:10] cut or a bruise on your body you can
[4:11] deal with it put a Band-Aid on it and
[4:13] the body heals itself and it's over
[4:15] within a few days but then the body can
[4:18] get something that's so internal and so
[4:20] deep that it's something that has to be
[4:23] dealt with deeper than just putting a
[4:25] Band-Aid on and so when we when we
[4:28] receive just something small it's one
[4:29] thing but we have diseases and some of
[4:31] the worst is the some of the worst I was
[4:34] reading it today the worst disease the
[4:37] worst diseases is ones that get in the
[4:39] bloodstream and the blood our
[4:41] bloodstream is our life stream
[4:43] so no so you can have a cut or a bruise
[4:46] but there are diseases that can go so
[4:48] deep into your bloodstream that your
[4:49] days would be numbered because if you're
[4:51] into the bloodstream if something's in
[4:53] the bloodstream your days could be very
[4:54] very much numbered we've been praying
[4:56] for brother Gabe tawari the pastor in
[4:58] Ann Arbor and he had really strange
[5:01] things happen since um December and they
[5:04] were they were saying it might Trace
[5:05] back to a dentist visit that he did and
[5:07] got something in his in his mouth and a
[5:10] germ went into his blood he got real
[5:12] sick in December and then he felt better
[5:14] but then he went right back again it's
[5:15] something got in his bloodstream and
[5:18] some type of sickness and then it was so
[5:21] potent that it went and started to
[5:22] attack his heart and when it did that
[5:24] then he had to have open heart surgery
[5:26] recently he's just recovering but I'll
[5:28] tell you you don't mess with those
[5:29] things because it just it's something
[5:31] that's deep and you can't you can't put
[5:33] a bandage on that you can't put a
[5:35] Band-Aid on that it's something so deep
[5:37] they say that that CAD coronary heart
[5:40] disease is the worst disease in in the
[5:43] world that's the worst disease and
[5:45] that's related to the blood the blood
[5:47] vessels narrow that's going to the heart
[5:50] and sometimes something is in the blood
[5:52] restricting the blood flow to the heart
[5:54] and that'll kill you
[5:56] and so serious measures need to be taken
[6:00] for serious things how many know that
[6:02] and and so it's not just a casual visit
[6:06] to the doctor when you have a disease
[6:08] it's not just something that's why when
[6:11] people come and be prayed for some needs
[6:13] are are very minimal but God cares about
[6:16] all of them but sometimes some needs are
[6:18] very very uh specific and very deep can
[6:21] you say Amen there's something that's uh
[6:23] all things are all things are possible
[6:25] With God all things are possible it
[6:28] doesn't matter how bad the disease
[6:30] God can take care of it can you say Amen
[6:32] but but if you had a disease then
[6:35] sometimes you you need like a heart
[6:37] surgery you need some type of surgery
[6:38] it's not just a casual visit to the
[6:40] doctor and I pray that we can come to
[6:43] church that not just a casual visit to
[6:45] the doctor but God if he needs to
[6:47] perform surgery on us then say I'm here
[6:50] for the duration can you say Amen
[6:52] because I want the Holy Spirit to deal
[6:54] deeply with me and he has to do that
[6:57] because in in the talking about our
[6:59] nature the nature that we're born with
[7:01] it has put sin in us so deeply it's not
[7:05] just a little cold or a little symptom
[7:07] it's life-threatening the nature that we
[7:10] received in our birth it has to be dealt
[7:12] with with a remedy that goes deep if
[7:15] you've got a deep problem then the
[7:16] remedy has to go deep can you say Amen
[7:19] you wouldn't take NyQuil for this it's
[7:20] not just a cold can you say man it's not
[7:23] just taking NyQuil and you feel better
[7:24] to sleep and the next day you're still a
[7:26] bit sick so you take Nyquil the next
[7:28] night no the the disease of sin that
[7:32] we're born with is deep embedded in our
[7:35] nature and because it's embedded in our
[7:38] nature then it takes a deep deep work of
[7:40] redemption for God to deal with it and
[7:42] as I said Sunday you can't deal with
[7:44] that yourself there's no way to drag
[7:46] yourself out of that myri clay there's
[7:48] no way to lift yourself up you might as
[7:51] well say I've fallen and I can't get up
[7:53] Lord I've fallen and there's no way for
[7:55] me to get get up I need your hand to
[7:57] pick me up and Redeem Me
[7:59] there are certain problems that only God
[8:02] can deal with can you say and we live
[8:04] and Leo to see us so we have a lot of
[8:06] answers for our problems we have a lot
[8:08] of medicines which I'm not against
[8:09] medicines because if God uses it to heal
[8:11] God use the devil that praise the Lord
[8:13] for that but you see we can become
[8:15] dependent and all Leo to see is answers
[8:17] for so many things that we need this and
[8:19] we need a new car and we need all this
[8:22] stuff and so we don't need to pray
[8:23] anymore because the world provides it
[8:25] for us but for the nature of sin there's
[8:28] only one that can deal with that problem
[8:30] not that you're a good person not
[8:32] Charities that you do not service to the
[8:35] church not your gift your singing your
[8:37] preaching can you say Amen you can
[8:39] preach like an angel and still have the
[8:41] desire for sin it takes God to deal with
[8:44] that and to deal deeply with you
[8:47] amen so that when serious uh measures
[8:52] are in our lives then it takes serious
[8:54] measures to deal with it and churches
[8:56] sometimes do uh things to make people
[8:58] feel better in these days just for a
[9:01] couple days they arrange our Sunday
[9:03] morning services to just make people
[9:05] feel better for a couple days
[9:07] but Redemption is the power of His
[9:10] spirit that saves you from sin and Hell
[9:16] and you say man
[9:18] Redemption is not just a casual visit to
[9:21] Sunday church it saves you from sin it
[9:24] lifts you out the myory clay so on
[9:27] Sunday we were given the first part of
[9:29] redemption and just taking it in pieces
[9:31] so that even the children can understand
[9:33] it and the first part of redemption
[9:36] according to the law is that the wages
[9:39] of sin is death God said to Adam and Eve
[9:42] at the beginning if you eat of eat
[9:44] thereof of that fruit then you shall
[9:46] surely die so if you sin if there's
[9:49] unbelief in your sin and you eat of that
[9:51] he said you'll die so that's the wages
[9:53] of sin so if you sin that's that's
[9:55] that's you you can't get out of it that
[9:57] there has to be a punishment for it and
[10:00] and so now the only way that you can get
[10:02] out of it is someone paid the price for
[10:04] that sin someone paid the penalty a
[10:06] penalty has to be paid and so the only
[10:09] way that something can happen is you pay
[10:11] that penalty but you can't pay that
[10:13] penalty and say you can't deal with the
[10:15] problem so the only way is someone
[10:17] paying the penalty for your sin the
[10:19] first step is somebody paying the
[10:21] penalty you couldn't get out you you
[10:24] would finish this life you would die in
[10:27] your sins uh you would go to a sinner's
[10:29] hell you could not lift yourself up you
[10:32] could not pay your debt uh and you were
[10:34] helpless you couldn't lift yourself up
[10:36] and and and so then if we were wanting
[10:39] to begin to believe the word and start
[10:42] to come back to God we couldn't even
[10:44] start coming back until the penalty of
[10:49] our sin was paid
[10:51] you say do you want to come back to God
[10:52] I want to come back to God I want to
[10:54] come back to him but you see you
[10:55] couldn't until first your sin was dealt
[10:57] with because you never come in the
[10:59] presence of God with that sin
[11:01] so and you can't deal with your sin so
[11:03] you're actually you're doomed without
[11:05] the grace of God
[11:07] you do without the grace of God and
[11:09] because of the penalty has to be paid
[11:11] that's the first step and praise the
[11:14] Lord tonight can you say praise the Lord
[11:15] he paid the debt for our sins he paid
[11:17] the full debt
[11:19] you ever heard of somebody who needed a
[11:21] surgery and it was life-threatening they
[11:23] had to have the surgery maybe you maybe
[11:25] you needed a surgery and and you
[11:27] couldn't afford the surgery you heard
[11:28] it's going to be two hundred thousand
[11:30] dollars for this surgery and the
[11:31] doctor's telling you unless you have
[11:33] this surgery you're gonna you're
[11:34] finished you gotta have it and you were
[11:36] poor you didn't have two hundred
[11:38] thousand dollars for that surgery you
[11:39] couldn't afford it you couldn't get it
[11:41] and so then and then then you you're as
[11:43] you're as you're just uh dealing with
[11:45] that somebody secretly goes to the
[11:48] hospital and somebody pays the 200 000
[11:51] for your surgery somebody pays it and
[11:54] the hospital calls you and says listen
[11:56] you didn't have the money but somebody
[11:58] had the money the full cost and they
[12:00] just paid it you can have your surgery
[12:03] you can move forward how many remember I
[12:06] scored my story Sunday when my wife and
[12:07] I had that debt school debt and all of
[12:10] that there's no greater feeling than
[12:12] when the debt has been completely paid
[12:15] by someone else because you couldn't pay
[12:17] it can you say Amen there's no grade but
[12:19] if you want to Trump that by a hundred
[12:22] thousand times the debt of sin was paid
[12:25] at Calvary you don't have to pay it he
[12:28] paid it in full
[12:31] that's enough to shout about
[12:34] that's enough to Rejoice about right
[12:36] there we haven't even got to the rest of
[12:38] the work of redemption in your life and
[12:40] you can already shout because somebody's
[12:41] paid the debt you'd never be able to
[12:43] come to God come to this altar unless
[12:45] somebody had paid your debt for sin the
[12:48] first thing you can do is reach up in
[12:50] Brokenness and say God thank you for
[12:53] going to Calvary for me thank you I'm a
[12:56] sinner
[12:57] but I have been saved by grace because
[12:59] you paid the debt the first part of
[13:01] redemption is somebody has to pay a
[13:04] price for your sin and he's already paid
[13:06] it I think we ought to be thankful for
[13:08] that
[13:09] I don't think we should forget that
[13:12] I think it should warm our hearts with a
[13:14] deep conviction all the time when we
[13:16] think about we we didn't get off
[13:19] scot-free we wouldn't have got off
[13:21] scot-free God had to deal with us and
[13:23] pay the debt he did it so some of the
[13:25] quotes that I was going to get to on
[13:27] Sunday
[13:28] he says here in the Oneness message and
[13:30] I'm going to get through these uh just
[13:31] rather quickly and then I want to get to
[13:33] the I want to get to Ezekiel 36.
[13:35] you see nothing has a soul but man
[13:38] he's in animal form that's true but he
[13:41] put a soul on him the animals the dogs
[13:43] the cats they don't have a soul that's
[13:45] how you're different than the animal
[13:47] you have a soul so you have a connection
[13:49] with God
[13:51] uh animals have they have a spirit and
[13:55] so and they're temperamental and
[13:58] emotional
[13:59] that's why I don't have a dog but anyway
[14:01] they have a spirit but they have a soul
[14:03] uh you know if they had a soul I could
[14:05] probably deal with them better a dog but
[14:07] anyway uh they have a spirit that's why
[14:10] they're different temperaments and some
[14:12] are hyper and some are this and but all
[14:15] of them don't know how to train and go
[14:16] to the bathroom outside all of them have
[14:18] that problem
[14:19] but they have a spirit so they're
[14:22] temperamental but only man has a soul
[14:24] okay so when they were taken Lambs in
[14:27] the Old Testament and God said bring a
[14:29] lamb for your sin they they could they
[14:31] could do that to put off their sin and
[14:33] God said okay I'm satisfied for another
[14:35] year because something died for your sin
[14:37] but the spirit of that animal could not
[14:40] come back on a man again
[14:43] you see that was the next step that was
[14:45] broken is that the the spirit couldn't
[14:47] come and correct the desire for sin it
[14:50] stayed the same they still had a desire
[14:52] for sin but so the the lamb was killed
[14:55] but it stopped it right there but when
[14:57] Calvary took place uh um the man Christ
[15:00] Jesus went to Calvary for us and
[15:02] something happened because he was one of
[15:04] us can you say Amen then he went to
[15:07] Calvary and when he when he died his
[15:10] Spirit his Spirit could come back on us
[15:13] again
[15:15] to take us further into Redemption so we
[15:17] praise the Lord for that so that's why
[15:19] the prophets appear bringing it out he
[15:20] know right from wrong when his soul come
[15:22] on him remember when God created man in
[15:25] his own image and then he became a
[15:26] living soul for those who are listening
[15:27] I'm quoting a wonderful man of God
[15:29] William Branham you don't know who he is
[15:31] we'd be glad to share information I
[15:33] believe he was a man of God for this
[15:34] last days greatly instrumental in
[15:37] bringing us back to biblical truth so
[15:40] just if you want more on that that's who
[15:41] I'm quoting from right now and so
[15:44] remember when God created man in his own
[15:46] image and then he became a living Soul
[15:47] see he became that knowing right from
[15:50] wrong now notice now in this Jesus came
[15:52] and he was God not only the life of
[15:54] another man can come back on another man
[15:56] but the life of God making him a child
[15:59] of God putting him back into the same
[16:02] union he was before the fall now we're
[16:05] getting
[16:06] to the real Oneness what am I preaching
[16:09] our way back
[16:11] our way back our way back to Eden and
[16:14] our way back is that he could go to
[16:16] Calvary and pay the penalty for sin but
[16:18] not only that his Spirit God's old
[16:20] Spirit coming through that could come
[16:22] back on man again like it was in the
[16:25] Garden of Eden and we could be restored
[16:26] Back to Eden again that's pretty
[16:28] powerful
[16:30] the next one he said he paid the debt of
[16:31] sin now in order to get Oneness before
[16:33] between God and man again I'm saying
[16:36] again because that's what he's talking
[16:37] about he's saying to get that Oneness
[16:38] back again Jesus could not do it as long
[16:41] as he was here in a body of Flesh so he
[16:43] had to become the complete sin offering
[16:46] to take away the guilt of the believer
[16:48] take it away so that the Holy Ghost
[16:50] could come into man and make man and God
[16:52] won us again see there had to be
[16:54] something to re-establish re-establish
[16:56] what reestablish Oneness now we could
[17:00] re-establish we could reestablish when
[17:03] God's commandment is fulfilled could an
[17:05] angel fulfill it he has no blood could
[17:07] God have fulfilled it he has no blood
[17:09] and God became flesh and blood in order
[17:12] that he could pay the debt correctly and
[17:15] take away sin because that's the only
[17:17] way that's why God came down and became
[17:21] one of us
[17:23] because as God he had no blood
[17:26] our problem was in our blood can you say
[17:29] Amen it was a blood problem it was a
[17:31] nature problem it was the life in us
[17:33] that was wrong so God said I'm going to
[17:35] redeem my people but I can't do it I
[17:37] have no blood I'm going to have to come
[17:38] and create a blood cell in a little girl
[17:41] and then I shouldn't say a little girl
[17:44] teenage girl and then that's going to
[17:46] grow and I'm going to go but my purpose
[17:47] as soon as he was born he was born to
[17:49] die he was headed right towards Calvary
[17:52] with the purpose of paying the penalty
[17:54] for sin
[17:55] saw that his Spirit could come back on
[17:57] man again
[18:00] this may be simple to you but it's
[18:01] pretty powerful tonight we ought to
[18:03] praise the Lord because you needed it I
[18:05] needed it I don't care how good a
[18:07] preacher you are I don't care how good
[18:09] all of us needed the grace of God
[18:12] none of us could find our way in except
[18:15] for his blood and his Spirit coming back
[18:17] on us this is our way back to Oneness
[18:21] this is how you come in fellowship with
[18:23] God you don't ignore the Holy Ghost and
[18:25] say well I have my own personal walk
[18:27] with God no this is the way back
[18:31] say well I have a Bible I'm doing fine
[18:33] on my own not without the holy ghost in
[18:35] your life
[18:36] the only way back through Redemption is
[18:39] you repenting of your sins
[18:41] and his Spirit coming back on you again
[18:45] that's the only way back to the Garden
[18:47] of Eden again
[18:48] that is redemption
[18:51] the next quote says see that's the only
[18:53] way that man could be back I just said
[18:55] it that's the only way man could get
[18:57] back in his original state again is for
[18:59] that penalty of sin to be paid the
[19:01] penalty of sin of what death wages of
[19:03] sin is death and God said the day you
[19:05] eat thereof that day that you have this
[19:07] affair that day you'll die and when it
[19:10] did it broke his relationship fellowship
[19:12] and everything for man could not come
[19:14] back anymore until that penalty was paid
[19:16] and nobody was worthy to pay it because
[19:18] everyone fell with a human being all of
[19:21] us fell with the same fall in the garden
[19:22] because every creature is under the
[19:24] human being and he was Fallen the next
[19:26] quote the debt of sin was paid this is
[19:28] when I read Sunday Jesus had to do this
[19:30] send the Holy Ghost back upon the uni to
[19:33] the unite the people like it was in the
[19:34] Garden of Eden the debt was paid when
[19:36] Jesus died that settled it Amen brother
[19:39] if I could only get that to soak in see
[19:42] the debt is paid
[19:46] Hallelujah to the land the debt is paid
[19:49] and every man and woman hearing me this
[19:52] morning or will hear me by tape your
[19:55] penalty is paid don't you disbelieve
[19:58] God's word again come back to the word
[20:02] we couldn't even come back unless we
[20:04] could say my penalty has been paid and
[20:07] now I can come back to God
[20:11] oh blessed be his name I feel like
[20:13] shouting tonight I can come back to him
[20:15] I couldn't even come back even if I
[20:18] cried tears all night I couldn't come
[20:21] back unless the penalty was paid but now
[20:23] I can say I can come all the way back
[20:26] because the penalty has been completely
[20:28] paid
[20:31] amen come back to the word he was the
[20:34] word Glory I feel like shouting honest I
[20:36] do the penalty is paid it's all over I
[20:39] love that it's over I like to say it's
[20:40] over game's over devil
[20:43] games over devil
[20:46] can you imagine now we're growing in the
[20:48] Lord we grow every week we grow in the
[20:50] word we're growing in the Holy Ghost but
[20:52] can you imagine telling the devil that
[20:54] even when the price was paid 2 000 years
[20:57] ago you can tell the devil game over
[21:00] game it's over it's done
[21:03] sons of daughters of God were as good as
[21:07] saved and restored back when he said it
[21:10] is finished at Calvary
[21:12] it was over can you say Amen
[21:15] oh my no wonder Angel screamed and sang
[21:18] the anthems of Heaven ring out yesterday
[21:20] the lost sheep was found of propitiation
[21:22] was made for him to be restored again
[21:24] the Waters of Separation God's word that
[21:26] washes him from his iniquity when the
[21:27] word died in my place and was
[21:29] resurrected again and became preeminent
[21:32] in my life I love how that's worded when
[21:34] the word died in my place and was
[21:36] resurrected again and become preeminent
[21:39] in my life in my heart amen the
[21:42] penalties paid it's over we are redeemed
[21:52] we are redeemed
[21:54] I'm preaching to the redeemed tonight
[21:57] let the redeemed of the Lord say so
[22:00] I don't know what the devil told you
[22:02] today about yourself but tell him back
[22:03] tonight I am redeemed I am the redeemed
[22:07] the penalty has been paid
[22:10] Satan I am redeemed
[22:13] Hallelujah
[22:18] it's all over it's all over praise the
[22:20] Lord I know we got a lot of growing and
[22:22] we don't feel like we reached this week
[22:24] where we want to be but let's just
[22:26] remind ourselves the penalty's been paid
[22:29] it's over as far as God's concerned it's
[22:31] as good as done
[22:34] hallelujah praise the Lord sister Ashley
[22:36] here saying Amen to the word of God and
[22:39] you know there's been three or four
[22:41] incidents I've just preached girls right
[22:43] into labor
[22:47] that's what we're praying for
[22:49] you can wait around for a full moon all
[22:51] you want to but I can preacher right
[22:53] into it right here
[22:55] Hallelujah
[22:57] well that's good okay so now let's get
[22:59] back to our Ezekiel 36 now look at this
[23:01] powerful work I want you to notice
[23:03] something and I'm going to take it
[23:04] scripture by scripture we've got I got
[23:06] several minutes here so Ezekiel 36 look
[23:09] at this
[23:10] verse 16 moreover the word Lord came
[23:12] unto me saying son of man when the house
[23:14] of Israel dwelt in their own land they
[23:16] defiled it by their own way and by their
[23:19] doings their way was before me as the
[23:21] uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore
[23:23] I poured my Fury upon them for the blood
[23:25] that they had shed upon the land and for
[23:27] their Idols were with they had polluted
[23:29] it and I scattered them among the
[23:31] Heathen and they were dispersed through
[23:33] the countries according to their way and
[23:35] according to their doings I judged them
[23:36] and when they entered into the Heathen
[23:39] under the Heathen whether they went they
[23:41] profaned my holy name so it's it's bad
[23:44] enough that Israel left God and began to
[23:46] serve Idols then when God scattered them
[23:48] to all the Heathen Nations they get
[23:50] amongst those Heathen and they start
[23:52] profaning the name of God when they said
[23:55] to them these are the people of the Lord
[23:57] and are gone forth out of his land so
[23:59] these people in the heathens were saying
[24:01] this is the people of the Lord this is
[24:03] supposed to be the ones that are blessed
[24:04] of God these are the Jews and they're so
[24:06] far away from God they're actually
[24:08] profaning his name and they're saying
[24:11] but these are the people of God these
[24:12] were supposed to be the people of God
[24:14] that's how far backslid they were that's
[24:16] how far backsled you were with sin in
[24:18] your life
[24:20] amen
[24:21] this is all about the individual now
[24:23] because remember at the End of the Road
[24:25] God saved Israel as a nation but he
[24:27] saves Gentiles as individuals
[24:30] so everything that applies to Israel as
[24:32] a nation applies to you as an individual
[24:35] and you by yourself born in sin shaped
[24:39] in iniquity you're in a land you
[24:40] rebelled against the god you're out
[24:42] amongst the world amongst the Heathen
[24:44] you start acting like them you take on
[24:46] the nature you just you do what they do
[24:48] you smoke you drink you into all the
[24:51] kinds of things the worldly music and
[24:52] everything because you by Nature you
[24:54] have that nature so you're out there
[24:56] amongst the Heathen and a lot of times
[24:58] they're looking at saying hey didn't you
[24:59] have a better upbringing than that
[25:00] didn't you say this didn't you say that
[25:02] and they're kind of looking at you
[25:03] saying my that weren't you weren't you
[25:06] used to grow up in a Christian church or
[25:08] something I can't believe you're acting
[25:09] like that
[25:11] but I had a he's God says I had a Pity
[25:14] let's notice now I had a pity for my
[25:16] Holy Name which is the house of Israel
[25:18] had profaned among the Heathen whether
[25:19] they went therefore say unto the house
[25:21] of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do
[25:23] not this this next thing I'm going to do
[25:25] Redemption I do not this for your sakes
[25:28] o House of Israel but for my holy
[25:31] namesake which ye have profaned among
[25:33] the Heathen whether you went there's one
[25:34] thing we got to know about Redemption
[25:36] it's not just about you can you say man
[25:39] but it's about God said I made a promise
[25:42] that I'm going to manifest myself
[25:45] through human beings
[25:49] I'm going to glorify my name in human
[25:52] beings that's the purpose of God he
[25:55] didn't come in you to glorify yourself
[25:58] he didn't come in you that you're a
[26:00] super duper Christian where you're going
[26:02] to boast and I'm better than everybody
[26:04] else in Pride no no he comes in that his
[26:06] name could be glorified in your life
[26:10] and he does that through flesh the plan
[26:13] of God is for the word to be manifest in
[26:16] your flesh In the Flesh of Sons and
[26:18] Daughters of God but it's not about you
[26:20] it's about him in you and he's saying to
[26:23] Israel when I redeem you don't think
[26:25] that even that is about you I'm doing it
[26:28] to protect and restore my name
[26:34] and you're gonna read it he's gonna say
[26:36] I'm gonna do this I'm going to do that
[26:39] I'm going to do that and we could
[26:41] interrupt and say where do I come along
[26:43] how do I contribute there's none of us
[26:45] in it
[26:49] and guess what I'm glad there's none of
[26:51] us in it
[26:52] I'm gonna do this I'm Gonna Change you
[26:55] I'm gonna do that
[26:57] because when we inject into it
[27:00] and that's what he said about the
[27:01] children of Israel when they chose law
[27:02] over Grace they should have chose Grace
[27:05] and they said to Moses give us a law
[27:08] tell us the Commandments tell us what to
[27:10] do and we will do it they should have
[27:11] never said that that's not a good deal
[27:15] they should have said we surrender Lord
[27:18] you do what you want to do in US
[27:22] when they chose law over Grace and he
[27:24] says why did man chose law of a Grace
[27:25] prophet of God said is because man is
[27:29] always trying to do something in it
[27:32] we're always trying to have some type of
[27:35] thing that we can inject in it that we
[27:37] can do and maybe some of my discipline
[27:39] will help this along a little bit
[27:41] maybe some of my gifts could help God
[27:45] your gifts need to be surrendered to the
[27:47] Lord
[27:48] your life needs to be surrendered to the
[27:50] Lord
[27:51] this is all about
[27:53] him it's not about you that was a
[27:56] message from Little Lane to his mom on
[27:58] the way to church one night when she's
[28:00] stressed out
[28:01] trying to get to church she's stressed
[28:03] out talking about it the whole way and
[28:05] driving the parking lot and little lane
[28:08] says how is he Kyle he was probably too
[28:10] then or three or what for Mom
[28:16] it's not about you
[28:18] it's about God
[28:21] it's all about him
[28:23] so he was preaching a sermon before she
[28:25] even made it to the church
[28:27] preach the good one too and I'm
[28:28] preaching it tonight
[28:30] this isn't about you
[28:32] it's about his name being glorified in
[28:34] you
[28:35] and he will take you through a
[28:36] sanctification process he will take your
[28:39] life through a Redemption process and
[28:41] he's doing it all so his name could be
[28:43] glorified in your life and in your flesh
[28:46] and he's going to do it
[28:50] praise the Lord
[28:52] all right where are we at look at this
[28:53] we haven't even started the process here
[28:55] so I'm doing that for that so verse 23
[28:57] and I will sanctify my great name which
[28:59] is profaned among the Heathen which he
[29:01] have profaned in the midst of them and
[29:03] the Heathen shall know that I am the
[29:05] Lord saith the Lord God when I see he
[29:07] never lets the devil gets the get the
[29:09] last word
[29:11] I will not let the last word be my name
[29:15] being profaned to the heathen there's
[29:17] going to be a glorious Church Without
[29:20] spot or wrinkle this bride's going to
[29:23] come to a Capstone love there's going to
[29:25] be a finishing work in here can you say
[29:28] man and the devil thinks he's got the
[29:29] climax to this Eden that he's created
[29:31] Satan's Eden but let me tell you
[29:33] something God gets the last word and the
[29:37] last word is going to be this bride
[29:38] coming to her position
[29:43] God said I will not let my name continue
[29:46] I think so now I'm going to take my
[29:48] people I'm going to redeem them because
[29:50] I'm going to get the last word Satan
[29:51] don't have the last laugh
[29:55] verse 24 says I will take you from among
[29:58] the Heathen and gather you out of all
[30:00] countries and will bring you into your
[30:02] own land he hasn't filled him with the
[30:04] spirit yet he hasn't changed their heart
[30:07] yet he said I just need to gather you
[30:09] out of all those Heathen lands and bring
[30:11] you into your own land and when your
[30:13] Christian Life Starts you don't know
[30:15] that God is beginning to call you and
[30:18] work on you even on some job maybe you
[30:20] were working in a bar maybe you're in a
[30:22] factory and custom with all the other
[30:24] guys and and so but if you're a Son of
[30:26] God he's he's already hunting for you
[30:29] God is hunting for you because he's
[30:31] going to find his sons and daughters
[30:33] wherever they're at and he's going to
[30:35] say I need to get you separated from
[30:37] that atmosphere a bit and bring you into
[30:40] your own land first so I can start to
[30:42] deal with you he took Israel by the
[30:45] power of redemption out of all those
[30:47] he's in Heathen lands and gathered them
[30:50] all by something that was in heart we
[30:52] got to get back to Jerusalem we got to
[30:53] get back to Jerusalem they came from all
[30:56] the countries and he gathered them back
[30:58] hadn't even dealt with them yet
[31:00] hadn't even restored them yet but the
[31:02] first thing is I'm going to bring them
[31:04] out of all those lands
[31:08] you don't know when God was working on
[31:10] your heart back in that bar
[31:13] you don't know who it was that God
[31:15] calling you when you were in
[31:17] prostitution you don't know what it was
[31:19] when you were a little girl that was
[31:20] abused you don't know God began to deal
[31:22] with your heart back then and begin to
[31:24] call you
[31:28] I will gather them to their own land
[31:33] verse 25 then I will sprinkle clean
[31:37] water upon you and ye shall be clean
[31:41] from all your filthiness because you're
[31:44] too filthy to come before the Lord and
[31:46] you're certainly too filthy to receive
[31:48] his holy spirit
[31:51] God's got to deal with that old nature
[31:52] first
[31:54] I will sprinkle clean water you should
[31:56] be clean from all your filthiness and
[31:58] from all your Idols will I cleanse you
[32:01] you see this is why I preach to people
[32:02] in different stages of their Christian
[32:04] Journey
[32:06] I preach every service and everybody's
[32:09] at different stages
[32:10] and some people think that they're in
[32:12] they're in another stage than what they
[32:14] really are but the word reveals where
[32:15] you really are
[32:16] you're still all
[32:18] filthy from the idols of the world
[32:22] walking in this church
[32:24] well then you you can't just act like
[32:27] that you're a holy ghost Phil Christian
[32:30] your life needs to be cleansed of the
[32:32] idols
[32:34] you need to be Sanctified by the blood
[32:36] of Jesus Christ
[32:39] hmm
[32:41] you shall be clean from your filthiness
[32:43] from your Idols while I cleanse you I a
[32:45] new heart also will I give you and a new
[32:49] spirit will I put within you and I will
[32:51] take away the Stony heart out of your
[32:53] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[32:56] Flesh
[32:57] now notice in the quote he says here now
[32:59] come back to the scripture in a minute
[33:00] you put a new spirit this is a quote in
[33:03] them in the inner Veil you put a new
[33:05] spirit God has to give you a new spirit
[33:07] or you couldn't even get along with him
[33:12] you're not even close
[33:14] to agreeing with the word or agreeing
[33:17] with God you're not even close with the
[33:20] spirit you've got so he has to give you
[33:22] a new spirit first that's a little bit
[33:24] more get along ability
[33:27] did you hear me
[33:30] he has to give you a moral a little bit
[33:32] more get along ability Spirit just so
[33:35] you can start getting close to start
[33:37] listening to God
[33:38] because the spirit nature you're born
[33:40] with and the spirit you hold never gets
[33:44] along with God doesn't want God resists
[33:46] God shuts him out
[33:49] so he's got to put it he's got to put a
[33:51] new spirit in you so he can get so you
[33:53] can get along with his spirit amen I
[33:55] will put a new spirit in them I will put
[33:57] my spirit in them he said after he's
[33:59] given you a new spirit that's you don't
[34:01] get it confused with God's spirit it's
[34:04] not it's your new spirit so you can get
[34:07] along with the Holy Spirit if he ever
[34:10] gives it to you amen because you in your
[34:13] condition can never get a you and your
[34:16] condition never get along you can't get
[34:19] along with your wife you can't get along
[34:21] with your husband you can't get along
[34:23] with your neighbor
[34:27] how are you gonna get along with God
[34:30] when somebody can't even get along with
[34:31] your neighbor
[34:34] amen so so you you can't get along with
[34:38] the neighbor how are you ever going to
[34:39] get along with God so he has to give you
[34:41] a new spirit for you so you can get
[34:43] along with him so he puts a new spirit
[34:45] in you and then he puts his spirit and
[34:47] you gives you a new spirit a new outlook
[34:49] a new Faith then he puts his Holy Spirit
[34:51] and you notice back there in the
[34:52] beginning when that same man fell for
[34:55] Israel out here on the ground every day
[34:56] the people eat it but notice those
[34:59] people who eat that Manna would get
[35:00] hungry before nine o'clock I've seen a
[35:03] lot of camp meetings and people go to
[35:05] those camp meetings and they'd shout the
[35:07] victory for a little while while the
[35:09] camp meeting was going on and then
[35:11] before the day was over with the night
[35:13] coming close they'll worry all along and
[35:15] say well you know I wish I could keep
[35:17] the victory
[35:19] hallelujah oh my I wish I had just I
[35:22] wish I had the victory I wish I had the
[35:24] victory I had at Camp I'll tell you this
[35:27] this so and so this is so and so oh my
[35:28] it's because you're not in the right
[35:30] place to eat the Manna and that's
[35:32] another subject in itself but listen we
[35:34] don't want to just be camp meeting
[35:36] people can you say mine and we certainly
[35:39] don't want to be someone that just keeps
[35:41] a Stony heart we want to allow God in
[35:43] this Redemptive process to be able to
[35:47] change our spirit
[35:48] and and see what do you do brother Paul
[35:50] you say Lord wherever I'm at
[35:52] be it unto me Lord
[35:55] if I'm not getting along with you Lord
[35:58] change my spirit if I've got a Stony
[36:01] heart that's just cold towards God and
[36:03] maybe everybody else God you got to deal
[36:05] with that Stony heart
[36:07] you got to take a Heart of Stone you got
[36:09] to crush it and soften my heart first I
[36:12] want all the glories of God and I want
[36:14] to grow into this full matured adopted
[36:18] Spirit-filled Christian but Lord if I've
[36:20] got things in my life that is not that
[36:22] can't get along with people and there's
[36:24] something agitating all the time take
[36:26] that thing out of me because that's part
[36:29] of the Redemptive work as well
[36:31] how many agree that's part of this
[36:33] Redemptive work it's not just that you
[36:36] get the Holy Ghost some preachers don't
[36:38] like me to say that but in this
[36:39] Redemptive work of God for Israel it
[36:41] wasn't just getting his spirit it's him
[36:44] changing your spirit first it's him
[36:47] dealing with your broken heart and some
[36:49] Sundays not everybody might get the Holy
[36:52] Ghost but somebody might get their
[36:54] broken heart their heart broken and soft
[36:56] before the Lord and then the next Sunday
[36:58] or even Monday they can be filled with
[37:01] the Holy Ghost
[37:02] don't say we haven't had church because
[37:05] we haven't had an altar call listen God
[37:07] is dealing with people at every level
[37:09] that they're at and his Redemptive power
[37:12] is here among us to raise us where we
[37:14] need to be
[37:17] I think we ought to clap give yourself
[37:18] time to praise the Lord
[37:21] it's God doing the work it's this
[37:23] Redemptive power Among Us
[37:25] that's what we want to see working among
[37:27] us too many preachers only preach on
[37:30] just the Holy Ghost
[37:32] and this is a whole Redemptive process
[37:40] amen you know Sister Genie whoever's up
[37:43] there I had missed one quote in Oneness
[37:46] if you go back to that last one and
[37:48] Oneness it starts out what is it you've
[37:49] got to get to the word with the word do
[37:51] you have that one
[37:53] I missed one you probably knew that I
[37:54] missed one before I knew that I missed
[37:56] it I just found out what is it this is
[37:58] one is that you've got to get with the
[38:00] word get yourself killed up I'm
[38:02] persuaded that many of us friends have
[38:06] received the Holy Ghost but we just
[38:08] receive enough holy ghost in us to make
[38:11] us to the place where we don't want to
[38:13] lie
[38:14] we don't want to steal
[38:16] we don't want to do anything
[38:18] but God wants to fill every fiber of his
[38:22] church
[38:28] this Redemptive process doesn't start
[38:30] when we quit lying and quit stealing now
[38:32] if you're stealing and lying
[38:35] you need help
[38:38] start there my goodness
[38:42] the same God that can
[38:44] save a a robber is the same one that can
[38:48] do the rest of the work so you say Lord
[38:49] I you know I I stole way too many
[38:52] Twinkies in life
[38:56] I had to repent of that I don't know if
[38:58] you did but I had to repent of as a
[39:01] young boy
[39:02] this is why I'm brother Ryan
[39:05] and his dad but Ryan now that he's in my
[39:07] church here brings me a box of Twinkies
[39:09] every now because some of you don't know
[39:10] the twinkie story as a young boy I snuck
[39:12] off with some neighborhood kids got
[39:14] under the wrong influence and one day
[39:16] they wanted to go every day this Twinkie
[39:19] truck pulled up at the back of this
[39:20] building and unloaded a bunch of
[39:22] Twinkies and the guy left the door open
[39:23] said we're gonna go we're going to raid
[39:25] that truck and I got under the influence
[39:27] of these guys I was a good boy until
[39:29] that point
[39:31] I'd never done anything like this before
[39:35] but
[39:36] I weighed
[39:39] the thought of those Twinkies
[39:43] and that was a thing that was starting
[39:46] in my life back then that I still
[39:48] struggle with
[39:52] I waited and I waited and I thought and
[39:54] they're talking about it and I waited
[39:56] this is a this is going to be a bad boy
[39:58] but the Twinkies I'll get out of the day
[40:01] wait and I wait it for for a long time
[40:04] like 30 seconds
[40:09] and then I
[40:10] was with them
[40:12] and got up there raided that truck
[40:14] grabbed as many boxes of Twinkies as
[40:16] ho-hos that we could get ran back into
[40:19] the woods and sat there and I couldn't
[40:21] take them home so I had to eat most of
[40:24] them
[40:25] and it was a blast
[40:28] and it's probably why I looked the way I
[40:30] looked today
[40:33] quit making fat jokes
[40:36] that's a thought that I just heard
[40:38] come across
[40:40] stole it if if you
[40:43] if life
[40:45] I mean it's all of our things got to go
[40:47] before God
[40:49] right
[40:51] whatever what it is if we bring it to
[40:52] God he can redeem it
[40:55] but he says
[40:57] some of us just want to get just enough
[40:59] Holy Ghost to make us quit lying or
[41:01] stealing make us a better person
[41:04] but that quote tells me there's more to
[41:06] the Holy Ghost than just sanctification
[41:08] there's more of the Holy Ghost than you
[41:10] make you a good person
[41:12] he wants to fill every fiber of your
[41:14] being he wants to fill you completely
[41:17] so don't stop at just stopping stealing
[41:21] don't stop it just I gave my heart to
[41:22] the Lord don't stop it just being
[41:24] baptized if you haven't been baptized I
[41:26] encourage you if you're being led of the
[41:27] Lord be baptized in the name of the Lord
[41:29] repent and be baptized but don't stop
[41:31] there
[41:33] don't stop there say God fill me with
[41:35] your spirit now I'm a candidate to
[41:37] receive the holy ghost in my own life
[41:39] don't stop in God until he's filled
[41:43] every fiber of his church he wants to
[41:45] fill your thinking he wants to fill your
[41:47] mind how we would raise your hand and
[41:49] say my I want to go there in this
[41:51] Redemptive work fill my mind fill my
[41:53] thinking that his thoughts would so fill
[41:56] my thoughts
[41:57] replace them can you say Amen what a
[42:00] wonderful wonderful thing praise the
[42:02] Lord back to Ezekiel 36 and then I'm
[42:04] going to bring it to a close here so he
[42:06] says I then verse 20 said I will put my
[42:08] spirit within you and cause you so he's
[42:11] he's dealt with a Stony heart he's dealt
[42:13] with he's given you a new spirit that
[42:16] will get along
[42:18] and then I will put my spirit within you
[42:21] to cause you to walk in my statues and
[42:23] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[42:24] and ye shall dwell in the land that I
[42:27] gave to your fathers and ye shall be my
[42:29] people and I will be your God I will
[42:31] also he's not done
[42:36] this is so powerful friends this is so
[42:39] such a deep work
[42:42] God
[42:43] wants to do
[42:45] a deeper work in your life
[42:48] deeper than just saying I grew up in the
[42:50] message and I believe God sent a prophet
[42:52] deeper than that
[42:53] that's not good enough
[42:56] such a powerful deep work it's a process
[42:59] and he does it all can you say Amen
[43:03] and um
[43:05] we just find that in these scriptures
[43:08] I was just looking for I must have said
[43:11] this at the uh had this at the beginning
[43:13] as he begins to deal with us it's just
[43:16] such a wonderful thing
[43:18] but when we look at this Redemption
[43:19] taking place then we we realize that in
[43:23] these scriptures in Ezekiel 36 the first
[43:26] thing that we have to know
[43:28] is that he
[43:32] he is doing it all
[43:38] I will sprinkle with you with clean
[43:41] water
[43:42] I will deal with your Stony heart
[43:48] it's almost like God responding to the
[43:50] all the eyes
[43:52] that Lucifer rose up in Isaiah way at
[43:56] the beginning Isaiah reveals
[43:59] he said I will lift my throne above the
[44:02] Throne of God
[44:04] I will set myself up I want to be
[44:07] worshiped by God I I and he boasted and
[44:10] he boasted and actually went in caused
[44:13] the fall all these other things so it's
[44:15] almost like God is responding saying no
[44:17] all right you've had your time
[44:20] I will step in for my people now
[44:24] and you gotta imagine friends the devil
[44:28] is the one that preaches no hope for
[44:30] this human being
[44:32] he's the one that takes somebody
[44:35] sometimes so far there's no hope for
[44:37] them there's no Redemption for that
[44:40] and then he tells you personally with
[44:43] your story
[44:45] I don't think there's I'm not sure this
[44:48] Redemption that is preached at the
[44:50] pulpit is for you
[44:52] everybody else seems to be getting it
[44:54] but I don't think it's for you and your
[44:57] family I think you're an exception to
[44:59] the rule that's the devil's voice
[45:02] that's the devil's voice
[45:05] I don't I don't I don't think and you
[45:08] know you you've got such you have been
[45:10] through so much and have such a Stony
[45:12] heart that I don't know you're a you're
[45:14] in a different category you're not in a
[45:16] different category
[45:18] and God wanted to tell Satan I don't
[45:20] care how deep the Stony heart I don't
[45:22] care how the spirit that won't get along
[45:23] with me I don't care they're scattered
[45:25] all over the Nations I don't care if
[45:27] they're defaming my name I don't know if
[45:29] they'll care if they're cussing I don't
[45:30] care if they're swearing I don't care if
[45:32] they're deepest pit that they're in if
[45:34] they're my sons and daughters I'm going
[45:36] to show Satan I'm gonna go get em
[45:40] I'm showing the devil that there isn't a
[45:43] dark pit black enough and deep enough
[45:46] there isn't a myri clay
[45:48] that is deep enough for me not to redeem
[45:52] my child somebody say praise the Lord
[46:00] he brought me out of the my reclaim
[46:04] he set my foot
[46:06] notice he did it can you say Amen I'll
[46:08] bring them out I'll do this I got to
[46:10] finish before I sing I will also save
[46:12] you from your uncleanness I will call
[46:14] for corn I will increase it and lay no
[46:17] famine upon you I will multiply the
[46:19] fruit of the tree I will increase the
[46:21] field that ye shall receive no more no
[46:24] more reproach of famine among the
[46:25] Heathen I you know it's not you're not
[46:28] done after he puts a spirit in you it's
[46:31] still he's still selling Satan I'm going
[46:33] to do this for my people I'm going to
[46:36] multiply your fruit of the tree then
[46:39] shall you remember your own evil ways
[46:41] and your doings that were not good and
[46:43] shall loathe yourselves in your own
[46:44] sight for your iniquities and for your
[46:45] Abominations not for your sakes do I do
[46:48] this saith the Lord heckles it again be
[46:49] it known unto you be ashamed and
[46:51] confounded for your own ways or House of
[46:53] Israel
[46:54] thus saith the Lord God in the day that
[46:57] I shall have cleansed you from all your
[47:00] iniquities I will also cause you to
[47:02] dwell in the cities and ways shall be
[47:05] building and the desolate land shall be
[47:07] tilled whereas it lay desolate in the
[47:10] sight of all that passed by and they
[47:12] shall say this lamb that was desolate is
[47:16] become like
[47:18] the garden
[47:20] of Eden
[47:25] glory be to God
[47:27] that's Redemption he's taken his sons
[47:31] and daughters back to the Garden of Eden
[47:37] and we're not stop stopping halfway
[47:40] sister Jane we're not stopping halfway
[47:43] sister Rebecca we're not stopping
[47:45] halfway this isn't a halfway Journey
[47:47] Redemption is not a halfway trip he's
[47:50] not wanting just to get you off your
[47:51] cigarettes he's not wanting you just to
[47:53] get you off of bad videos this is not a
[47:56] halfway trip God is going to take his
[47:58] people through Redemption all the way
[48:00] through the process all the way back to
[48:03] Eden again can you say Amen
[48:06] he's going to burn this Earth he's going
[48:09] to purge this Earth with his holy fire
[48:11] can you say amen and he's going to put
[48:13] his people back on it again
[48:16] this is your Paradise
[48:18] this is your Millennium he's going to
[48:21] give us a new body
[48:23] that's the Final Redemption as I get a
[48:25] new body not like this body I'm not
[48:27] really this ugly
[48:31] they used to laugh at that when dad used
[48:33] to say it
[48:35] I'm not really this ugly I got a new
[48:37] body I got about 20 year old 21 year old
[48:39] body in the other dimension where'd you
[48:41] get that in the scripture if this
[48:43] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[48:45] one waiting in the heavens eternal
[48:48] if you know your Bible
[48:49] that's Redemption we can step into that
[48:51] other body
[48:53] but he says then I'll get you in there
[48:55] we'll have three and a half years of
[48:57] tribulation
[48:58] we won't be here for that
[49:00] but I have three and a half years and
[49:01] then we're going to set in a time of a
[49:04] thousand year honeymoon
[49:08] with the bride in Christ
[49:11] that's a pretty long honeymoon
[49:13] none of you men have ever got anywhere
[49:16] near that for your honeymoon
[49:19] thousand years of peace on Earth
[49:21] honeymoon
[49:23] and then at the end of that a new
[49:25] heavens and a new Earth wherein sin
[49:28] doesn't dwell
[49:29] I'll tell you friends this is a powerful
[49:32] work of redemption
[49:34] I'm going to end with that and say that
[49:36] this land was desolate and the people
[49:38] will say this
[49:40] land that was death has become like the
[49:42] Garden of Eden and the waste into
[49:44] desolate ruined cities are become fenced
[49:46] and are inhabited than the Heathen that
[49:49] are left around about shall know that I
[49:51] the Lord build ruined places
[49:55] and plant that that was desolate I the
[49:58] Lord have spoken it
[50:00] I will do it
[50:04] the devil's gonna know that heathen's
[50:05] going to know I'm the god that builds
[50:08] ruined places
[50:12] I'm the god that restores
[50:14] and the world's going to say at the end
[50:17] he's the god
[50:18] that builds ruined things
[50:21] broken lives ruined families
[50:24] broken hearts
[50:26] the heathen's going to say
[50:29] he's the Mighty God
[50:31] that heals ruined cities and ruined
[50:33] families and ruin hearts
[50:36] they're all going to know and I have
[50:38] spoken it I the Lord have spoken it
[50:42] and I will
[50:45] do it
[50:50] amen
[50:53] the Redemptive process of God is
[50:54] powerful this scripture it's powerful
[51:00] can you agree with me that the work of
[51:02] redemption is powerful
[51:04] we agree that it's a deep work and not a
[51:06] surface work
[51:08] it goes deep to the very nature of
[51:09] ourselves
[51:11] will you agree it's a process
[51:15] it is a process and would you agree
[51:18] that he does it all
[51:21] you ever need to be reminded go back to
[51:23] Ezekiel 36 where you're saying I will do
[51:25] this I will then and you'll get the four
[51:26] things out of it this is powerful
[51:28] this is deep this is a process
[51:31] and he does it all
[51:35] he does it all
[51:38] it's been good to be in the house of the
[51:39] Lord tonight it's been good to be in the
[51:42] house of the Lord let's Stand Together
[51:45] amen
[51:46] what song was I singing a minute ago
