[0:00] first three verses
[0:01] and uh just continue this on because i
[0:04] believe there's some good things in here
[0:06] and there will be choir practice this
[0:08] afternoon at three and then they have a
[0:09] little birthday cake for solomon after
[0:11] the service you're welcome to that
[0:13] god bless you each one we're going to
[0:15] read from psalms chapter one
[0:17] are you glad to be a christian today
[0:19] glad to be a believer boy that song
[0:22] pretty much said all we believe didn't
[0:23] it
[0:24] we won't let the enemy know we believe
[0:26] it with all of our hearts we believe it
[0:28] amen blessed is the man that walketh not
[0:31] in the counsel of the ungodly
[0:34] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[0:37] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[0:40] but his delight is in the law of the
[0:42] lord and his
[0:44] in his law
[0:45] doth he meditate day and night
[0:49] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[0:51] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[0:54] his fruit in his season
[0:57] his leaf also shall not wither and
[0:59] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper i say
[1:03] amen to that
[1:05] second corinthians chapter 10
[1:07] will be a verse related to
[1:09] the subject this morning second
[1:11] corinthians chapter 10
[1:13] and we'll just add this in to bring us
[1:15] into the channel of the thought ii
[1:17] corinthians chapter 10 and verse 5.
[1:22] casting down
[1:24] imaginations and every high thing
[1:28] that exalteth itself against
[1:31] the knowledge of god
[1:33] and bringing into captivity
[1:36] every thought
[1:38] every thought
[1:41] what a christian life
[1:43] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:46] how many have has a lot of thoughts come
[1:48] to you how many know some of them aren't
[1:50] of god
[1:52] bringing into
[1:53] captivity every thought
[1:56] to
[1:57] the obedience of christ
[2:00] i can't do that for you
[2:02] i don't even think the lord does that
[2:04] for you
[2:05] you in submission you do this you bring
[2:08] into captivity every thought so there
[2:11] might be a lot of things we don't have
[2:13] control over in this world but i believe
[2:16] a christian has control over his
[2:17] thoughts to direct his thoughts
[2:19] by the holy ghost within him father
[2:21] bless your word today as we speak on
[2:23] this may it minister and lord you do
[2:25] beyond way what a human can do way
[2:27] beyond it lord when your holy spirit is
[2:30] present and lord we believe you're here
[2:32] today we have sensed your presence and
[2:34] we know that you have something that you
[2:36] had in your mind for us no matter if
[2:38] someone that's here always or a visitor
[2:41] you have their life in your mind lord
[2:43] and you know what's needed right at this
[2:45] time more than a preacher knows you know
[2:48] so i pray as we yield ourselves and the
[2:50] people yield themselves
[2:52] something will happen supernaturally
[2:55] because we know that you're a
[2:56] supernatural god
[2:58] bless every heart that's come and we
[3:00] commit everything that's said in your
[3:02] name in jesus name amen amen god bless
[3:06] you shake somebody's hand as you're
[3:07] seated and god bless you all this
[3:08] morning
[3:10] now psalms chapter one has turned into a
[3:12] bit of a series here and i didn't expect
[3:15] that but it did and it's about where the
[3:18] believer positions himself it's really
[3:21] about that in three verses that really
[3:23] speaks of where a believer posits
[3:26] himself himself
[3:27] so that he can have perfect faith and
[3:29] that he can live
[3:31] a prosperous life spiritually he can
[3:33] live a life that's um before god and we
[3:36] found on wednesday night that the first
[3:38] thing that he does is he he positions
[3:41] himself away from the influences of
[3:44] ungodly counsel away from the influence
[3:47] of the way of sinners and away from
[3:50] sitting in the seat of the scornful so
[3:52] it's specific things that we talked
[3:54] about wednesday night if you want to
[3:55] hear it i'm sure that they have it there
[3:57] where it's specific so that's that's the
[3:59] first thing is a believer has to
[4:01] position himself away from certain
[4:04] influences if he doesn't he can't live
[4:07] in victory if she doesn't she can't live
[4:09] in victory if you're not willing to
[4:11] separate yourself from wrong things and
[4:13] the seed of the scornful and all these
[4:15] things we mentioned that you're then
[4:17] you're really not willing to live in
[4:18] full victory
[4:20] so you have to be willing to do that and
[4:22] so he positions himself and brother
[4:24] branham speaks at length about a
[4:26] believer's separation from not only the
[4:28] things of the world but separation from
[4:30] doubters separation from influence
[4:33] separation from what you read that's
[4:35] wrong separation from wrong type of
[4:37] television he speaks at length about the
[4:40] believer is a life of separation why
[4:43] does he do that does he do it to make us
[4:44] weird or strange or different no that's
[4:47] in psalms 1 a believer has to separate
[4:49] himself from certain things in order to
[4:52] live in victory
[4:53] abraham separated himself from all of
[4:56] his kindred even because he had to get
[4:58] to the promise of god
[5:00] so now when we separate ourselves that's
[5:02] only the first step but that's not all
[5:05] we find more here that if you sanctify
[5:08] and separate yourself
[5:10] it's it's there's something about it
[5:12] that when you separate and sanctify
[5:14] yourself for the lord you have to fill
[5:17] your life with something else
[5:21] how many knows the scripture jesus said
[5:23] uh the spirits in a man and in a vessel
[5:26] in a house and then they're cleaned out
[5:28] and if that man doesn't get filled then
[5:31] seven other demons come and fill him
[5:33] because there's another process there's
[5:35] another step to be filled with the holy
[5:37] ghost can you say amen
[5:38] you may sanctify your life and separate
[5:41] this but if you don't replace it with
[5:42] something else then you're going to be
[5:44] weak again and jesus even says other
[5:46] demons will come back
[5:48] so we learned that's something that's
[5:50] throughout the bible that a believer
[5:52] can't just separate himself from things
[5:54] of the world but he has to be filling
[5:56] himself with the right things be filled
[6:00] that's why you have terms in the bible
[6:01] like be filled with the spirit walk in
[6:04] the spirit receive ye the holy ghost he
[6:07] gave the holy ghost to them that obey
[6:10] him on the day of pentecost brother
[6:12] brehm says they emptied out for 10 days
[6:14] they emptied out everything and when
[6:16] they emptied out they prayed and the
[6:18] holy spirit came and filled them it's
[6:20] not good enough just to empty out you
[6:22] have to be filled with something else
[6:25] can i get a greater amen than that
[6:27] that's the truth brothers and sisters
[6:29] and anybody is under those rules any of
[6:31] human beings are under those rules you
[6:33] can sanctify your life to the max but
[6:36] unless you're exposing yourself to the
[6:38] word of god and feeding on the word of
[6:40] god and saying lord fill me with your
[6:42] spirit and keep me filled with your
[6:44] spirit so this man in psalms 1 if we
[6:46] look at it he's a blessed man of god
[6:48] blessed is the man he's blessed and it
[6:51] says first of all that his delight is in
[6:54] the law of the lord so we find something
[6:57] that that this is a passion this is
[7:00] something that he gives his life to
[7:02] his passion and his delight is in the
[7:05] word
[7:08] he's not only separated himself from
[7:10] other influences but his passion his
[7:12] thrust his attention his desire
[7:16] is to be
[7:17] filled with the word
[7:20] and to stay in the word can you say amen
[7:23] and so above anything else
[7:26] the word is his passion it's his
[7:28] delight i'm going to linger on this a
[7:30] bit
[7:31] because we know we have sometimes where
[7:33] people
[7:34] it's it's it's a duty
[7:38] but it's not a delight
[7:42] in this man it's not a duty to be in the
[7:44] word
[7:45] it's his delight
[7:46] and if it's not that to you to you all
[7:49] you have to say lord deal with my heart
[7:51] because i want it to be a delight
[7:54] i want it to be a passion
[7:56] and to this fellow here he's blessed
[7:58] because his passion and delight is in
[8:00] the word it's above anything else the
[8:02] word is exciting to him is the word
[8:04] exciting to you it's exciting to him he
[8:07] can't wait to hear the word he can't
[8:10] wait to get to church
[8:12] david was this kind of person about the
[8:14] word because he said i was glad when
[8:17] they came and told me let's go to the
[8:19] house of the lord the the chariot is
[8:21] outside waiting it's time to go to
[8:23] church it's the set time at 11 o'clock
[8:26] what 10 30 whatever it is and david said
[8:28] something rose in me when they came and
[8:30] told me the chariot's ready the the the
[8:33] the the car is outside it's warmed up
[8:35] ready to go and when they said it's time
[8:37] to go something rose up and says i was
[8:40] glad when they said unto me let's go to
[8:42] the house of the lord
[8:46] it wasn't a duty it was a delight
[8:51] it's exciting to them can't wait to get
[8:53] to church can't wait to open his bible
[8:55] and read it can't wait to have time to
[8:57] get into his word
[8:59] this and i want you to catch this point
[9:01] because we'll go into this a little bit
[9:02] more this is at a desire level on the
[9:06] inside of this man and if a desire level
[9:09] is at the soul level
[9:11] this is at a soul level that this is
[9:13] coming from remember the little story
[9:15] when brother brown is talking to the
[9:16] little rippling and the bubbling uh
[9:18] brook of the bubbling spring and he
[9:20] starts talking to it and says why do you
[9:22] why are you so happy why are you
[9:23] bubbling well it's not me it's something
[9:25] way down in the deep deep on the inside
[9:28] it's bubbling it's bubbling it's
[9:30] bubbling in my soul there's something
[9:33] way down deep where it's coming from
[9:36] it's not intellectual knowledge it's not
[9:38] a duty it's a passion it's a desire and
[9:41] it's at a soul level
[9:44] praise the lord
[9:46] so now
[9:48] i want to make some statements here so
[9:50] so at this this this believer
[9:53] or this sister i should say this is not
[9:55] a duty
[9:56] it's a delight
[9:59] this is not grievous
[10:01] this is enjoyable
[10:04] and paul says the commandments of god
[10:06] are not grievous to us
[10:09] this is not grievous this is enjoyable
[10:11] this is not i have to
[10:14] this is i get to
[10:16] come on now say amen this is not i have
[10:18] to do this this is i get to do this
[10:23] big difference can you say amen this is
[10:25] not a pressure this is a passion
[10:28] this is not a drudgery this is a desire
[10:32] this is not someone telling you to do it
[10:34] or you need it this is your soul telling
[10:37] you that you want it
[10:41] big difference it's at a desire level
[10:44] it's at a soul level but you see now
[10:47] it's not just reading it it's not just
[10:49] his passion is for it
[10:51] but
[10:52] as he takes it to the next thing he says
[10:55] his delight is in the law of the lord
[10:57] but he so loves it that in this law in
[11:00] the word he doth meditate day and night
[11:03] so it's not just that he has the desire
[11:05] it's not just he has a passion for the
[11:07] word of god it's not just
[11:10] that it's this this uh something's
[11:12] consuming him on the inside but he takes
[11:14] it further because he he takes this word
[11:18] and he lets it be lodged in his mind and
[11:22] in his thoughts if somebody says i'm
[11:25] meditating on this day and night as much
[11:27] as i can i'm going to meditate on his
[11:30] word that's somebody that's saying i
[11:32] want his word to not just invade my soul
[11:37] but i want his word to invade my thought
[11:40] life
[11:43] and i want to tell you that's deeper
[11:46] than just a desire in the soul
[11:49] that's why i titled this this morning
[11:52] victory
[11:54] in our thought life
[11:58] how many want a victory in your thought
[12:00] life
[12:01] that's this that's the secret place
[12:05] you can put on a lot of things at church
[12:06] but nobody knows what your thought life
[12:08] is
[12:10] only you and god
[12:12] and the devil can plant thoughts there
[12:15] he doesn't know the secrets of the
[12:16] thought secrets of her god does so it's
[12:18] you and god so so i can preach about
[12:20] this today but i don't know what your
[12:22] thought life is now i can watch your
[12:24] life and there's enough evidence to show
[12:26] what you think about most is gonna come
[12:28] out it's gonna you know it's not like
[12:30] it's here and then it comes and it
[12:32] spills out of your mouth eventually so
[12:34] you can tell what people are thinking
[12:36] because the bible says whatsoever a man
[12:37] thinketh in his heart so is he
[12:40] and so you'll see eventually but really
[12:43] nobody knows what you're thinking even
[12:45] right now maybe you're thinking of lunch
[12:47] already but i want to tell you put that
[12:49] out of your mind because this is your
[12:50] true lunch first this has to be your
[12:52] lunch
[12:56] how many is glad to be at lunch today
[12:59] amen we're glad you made the trip but we
[13:01] got to get into it a little bit we say
[13:02] lord feed me feed me feed me
[13:06] feed me in my soul
[13:08] so now this fella he's he's getting it
[13:10] lodged in his mind
[13:12] he he lives a life that he has to switch
[13:15] out his thoughts always back to the word
[13:18] he meditates day and night so he he if
[13:21] he's a human being he has other thoughts
[13:23] he has wrong thoughts he has a lot of
[13:25] things hitting him but he has learned
[13:27] that he must meditate in the word
[13:28] because he has to live a life of
[13:30] switching out wrong thoughts and
[13:32] replacing it with the word and that's
[13:34] why i read to you bringing every thought
[13:37] captive
[13:38] into captivity bring every thought into
[13:41] captivity every thought not just letting
[13:44] other ones go through can you say amen
[13:46] not just letting all the other things
[13:49] just and some of them just slip through
[13:50] because they're not going to be scanned
[13:53] you know let me just say this um
[13:56] so the children maybe will understand
[13:58] all of us understand better
[14:00] after 911
[14:02] our country changed
[14:05] and all the rules changed it changed
[14:08] everything can you say man
[14:10] and
[14:11] to elaborate on it it's because
[14:15] that all of a sudden now we thought we
[14:17] were safe and we thought we were okay
[14:20] but an enemy snuck in without us knowing
[14:23] it through our borders
[14:26] and we didn't know that it snuck in it
[14:27] snuck in with guns and actually stayed
[14:30] here for many years within the state
[14:32] among us
[14:33] and getting trained in a in pilot school
[14:35] without our own country all this
[14:38] happened and we did not know that it
[14:40] slipped in
[14:42] with a plan
[14:43] to not just be in our country there's a
[14:46] plan to do what it planned to do and all
[14:48] you know what it is if you children
[14:49] don't know they come they train to be
[14:51] pilots and then
[14:53] on 911
[14:55] they took over the pilot in three
[14:57] airplanes and one of them was the plan
[15:00] was and listen friends satan has a plan
[15:03] satan has a plan when he gives you the
[15:06] wrong thoughts it's not just the thought
[15:08] he has a plan
[15:11] he's a planner can you say man that's
[15:14] why you have to be a planner so when
[15:16] these things come and he slips in they
[15:17] had a plan and that was to learn to be a
[15:19] pilot so they would take over the plane
[15:21] and redirect one plane into the twin
[15:24] towers in new york redirect another
[15:26] plane into the pentagon and then plans
[15:28] to redirect the third plane they think
[15:30] into the white house and destroy the
[15:32] white house that one didn't make it but
[15:34] look at the enemy's plan and look why it
[15:36] happened and after that day
[15:38] with however many people that died the
[15:40] country was torn apart how did this
[15:43] enemy get in but after that point
[15:45] everything had to change
[15:49] and our security level had to go up
[15:53] and and our airports and everywhere
[15:56] had to have scanners
[15:59] to scan everybody including me including
[16:01] you good people
[16:03] bad people
[16:04] people that's never done anything
[16:05] anything wrong their whole life every
[16:08] everything has to be scanned
[16:12] we didn't have that before i could just
[16:14] walk into the airport and go to my plane
[16:16] not anymore
[16:17] now i got to take my belt off and my
[16:19] shoes off and i got to lay everything up
[16:20] there take everything out of my pockets
[16:22] all this and every person has to do it
[16:24] can you say man why why did it happen
[16:26] because something slipped in
[16:29] i'm gonna tell you about your christian
[16:30] life okay
[16:33] let me tell you about your life okay i
[16:36] believe that every christian
[16:38] every christian
[16:40] will no doubt have a 9 11
[16:44] that happens in their life
[16:48] you might have more than one
[16:50] if you don't learn your lesson
[16:54] in fact just so that our teenagers and
[16:56] our children can know how many would
[16:58] older ones that's been serving the lord
[17:00] how many has learned you've had a 911 in
[17:02] your life and what i mean by that is
[17:04] that the devil slipped in and got you
[17:07] and brought destruction because he
[17:09] slipped into something you wouldn't
[17:10] normally think he would have slipped in
[17:12] and how many raise your hand say it
[17:13] started in the thought life
[17:16] come on raise your hand appreciate you
[17:17] being honest so everybody's here has had
[17:19] a 911 and what it do it jolts you even
[17:21] as a christian that joseph said wait a
[17:23] minute i've got to put a higher security
[17:25] in place
[17:27] okay so we go through these airports and
[17:30] we have uh things that we have to do and
[17:33] we have to run uh people everybody no

[21:15] christian it only affects other people
[21:18] i can watch this i can listen to it and
[21:20] it doesn't affect me
[21:23] now solomon and gideon and i could go on
[21:26] with this all day long
[21:29] but i want an illustration to show you
[21:31] the bible says bringing every thought
[21:33] into captivity you have to have a
[21:36] scanner on your thought life if it's not
[21:39] of god it stops right there and it gets
[21:41] dumped out
[21:43] this guy's guilty put the cuffs on him
[21:46] get him out of here take his stuff
[21:48] this is what happens this is what you
[21:50] take this is what you should do with
[21:52] every thought that's not of god bring
[21:54] him into captivity
[21:56] take him to jail he's not making it
[21:58] through into the kingdom of god hurry up
[22:00] and do that i got a lot of sermon left
[22:02] solomon
[22:05] hurry up and do that
[22:06] thank you get him out of here
[22:12] every thought
[22:14] has to go through security
[22:17] isn't that what the bible is saying
[22:20] every thought has to go through security
[22:22] every
[22:24] actor has to leave the stage so i can
[22:26] preach
[22:28] good job guys thank you and that was
[22:29] unrehearsed by the way
[22:32] [Applause]
[22:35] so now
[22:37] this brother his thinking is directed
[22:39] his thought life is checked
[22:41] it's it's and then the bible says he has
[22:43] to meditate it on it on the word day and
[22:46] night so not only does he kick out wrong
[22:49] thoughts but he replaces them with the
[22:51] thoughts of god are you doing that
[22:55] day and night i want to put something in
[22:56] my mind i want to be filling my mind
[22:58] this is how you work as a human being
[23:00] this is how god created you can you say
[23:02] man and the devil's more aware of how
[23:04] your thought life influences you he's
[23:07] more aware than human beings we've got
[23:09] millions if not billions of human beings
[23:11] on the face of the earth that feed on
[23:13] things and they don't realize the power
[23:15] of the mind and the power of their
[23:16] thought life we have murderers in in
[23:19] jail can you say amen and it's because
[23:21] they didn't understand the principle of
[23:23] the power of a thought life
[23:26] and where it started is in the thought
[23:28] life
[23:30] nothing got checked can you say amen and
[23:32] so he focuses his mind on the word of
[23:35] god or on positive things and he dumps
[23:38] out and he scans the wrong thoughts that
[23:41] come through there are many things that
[23:43] this man may not be able to control in
[23:46] life things that happened to him things
[23:48] that other people did but he has control
[23:51] of what he thinks about and meditates on
[23:54] can you say man and there can be a good
[23:57] fruit that comes from someone who
[23:59] replaces their thoughts with the word of
[24:02] god and with positive things
[24:06] he has control of what he thinks about
[24:07] meditates on he says satan my thought
[24:10] life is my domain
[24:14] my thought life is my domain and you
[24:17] don't that's my territory
[24:19] is anybody listening this morning
[24:21] i know i know we may not and i
[24:23] appreciate it but i want you more than
[24:25] nodding morning saying amen i want to
[24:27] make sure that you understand and i'm
[24:28] not preaching to just unbelievers this
[24:31] morning preaching to mostly believers
[24:33] this is significant in your life
[24:35] you have to know that your thought life
[24:38] every day is your domain to take under
[24:41] the control of the holy spirit and satan
[24:44] does never ever belong there at all
[24:47] if you give him that territory he will
[24:50] take it but he needs to be scanned and
[24:52] checked at security every thought needs
[24:54] to be checked
[24:57] and i'm not talking about the person
[24:58] next to you i'm talking about you
[25:01] [Applause]
[25:05] some of you are defeated in your life
[25:06] because you haven't learned the one
[25:08] principle that what you think about
[25:10] every day is really going to influence
[25:13] who you are
[25:14] and your actions
[25:17] and that can be worldly thoughts that
[25:19] can be dirty thoughts or that can be
[25:21] depressing thoughts or that can be lies
[25:23] of the enemy or that can be things that
[25:25] are contrary to the word of god it can
[25:26] be anything but if it's not of god
[25:29] then we don't have to think about it
[25:34] i'm giving you permission today
[25:37] that you don't have to think about what
[25:39] you thought about this week and spent
[25:42] probably most of your week dwelling on a
[25:44] dominant thought
[25:47] and if it's not of god i'm giving you
[25:49] permission you did not need to spend
[25:52] 60 70 hours in your thought life this
[25:54] week thinking about that and letting
[25:57] that be your dominant thought
[26:04] the word gives you permission not me
[26:07] the word gives you let this mind be in
[26:09] you which is also in christ jesus paul
[26:12] said forgetting those things which are
[26:14] behind
[26:16] it's not any more complicated than that
[26:18] the word gives you permission to forget
[26:21] those things are behind if it's under
[26:23] the blood which i believe with believers
[26:25] it's under the blood i have confessed it
[26:27] it's done and paul says forget all of it
[26:30] behind i give you permission a believer
[26:33] can forget because god's forgiven and
[26:35] for god he can't remember it no more so
[26:38] you don't have to remember
[26:41] god has a sea of forgetfulness you
[26:43] should have a sea of forgetfulness that
[26:45] you don't have to revisit a thought
[26:47] that's underneath the blood of jesus
[26:49] christ
[26:49] [Applause]
[26:51] what a waste of time
[26:53] what a waste where is it going to get
[26:54] you
[26:56] what a waste of time
[26:58] now i'm sensitive to the fact there are
[27:00] things that happen to us that it's hard
[27:03] to get out of our minds it doesn't
[27:04] happen overnight some things happen and
[27:07] it's just it's a part of our spirit it's
[27:10] a part of it and so it consumes us i
[27:12] understand that part of the human being
[27:14] but you can't stay there for years
[27:17] because god has god has something for
[27:21] you and i've preached this before that
[27:23] you cannot get to the glories of the
[27:24] future even as a believer if you're
[27:27] dwelling in the past
[27:29] you can never move forward if you're
[27:31] dwelling in the past in your thought
[27:33] life you can be trying to step forward
[27:35] in things but in your thought life
[27:37] you're in the past you can't move
[27:38] forward and satan knows that that's why
[27:40] he plagues you with the things of the
[27:42] past that's why he has a thought life
[27:44] that's he's trying to dominate because
[27:47] he knows you can't move forward but i
[27:49] give you permission you if it's under
[27:51] the blood you can forget that which is
[27:54] behind and press toward the mark of the
[27:56] high calling in christ and you deserve
[27:59] it because his blood has purchased you
[28:02] to press towards the high calling of
[28:04] christ
[28:05] you can't get there because of you he
[28:07] said you would get there he he purchased
[28:10] your journey all the way to glory
[28:16] is anybody getting something out of this
[28:17] this morning
[28:19] if i don't stay up here on these notes i
[28:21] won't get very far so now we see
[28:24] that with thoughts that we know come
[28:26] from satan and are not of god they must
[28:29] quickly be thrown out and replaced
[28:33] and i can't do that for you
[28:36] your mom and dad can't do that for you
[28:38] the deacons can't do that for you
[28:44] you have to refuse
[28:47] to let satan
[28:50] mess with your mind
[28:53] i just today if you if
[28:55] if you're hearing me because i i being
[29:00] a pastor privy to things through the
[29:02] years
[29:04] know that believers probably have the
[29:07] biggest battle and struggle in their
[29:08] thought life
[29:11] because satan's already got the
[29:13] unconverted mind
[29:16] he's already got their minds he owns it
[29:20] besides that through ai he he dominates
[29:23] through social media and everything he
[29:25] dominates people are like robots
[29:27] they've been taught by hollywood for
[29:29] years and they're only acting out
[29:31] because satan has the domain of their
[29:34] mind they lost it years ago but it's the
[29:37] believer who's trying to say i don't
[29:39] want to think wrong thoughts i want the
[29:41] thoughts of god
[29:43] that's the people that battle the
[29:44] hardest with the mind battle
[29:48] because if you start to get a hold of
[29:50] these things there's a victory and satan
[29:52] is defeated and he doesn't like that
[29:55] you have to refuse to let satan mess
[29:57] with your mind can you say man
[29:59] it's your domain
[30:00] and to mess with your identity and to
[30:03] put thoughts trying to change your
[30:05] identity and who you are
[30:08] people you know i don't know if it's the
[30:10] age i'm getting to but people are
[30:12] starting to see me
[30:14] associated with somebody else i walked
[30:16] into the y the other day and
[30:17] you know working out i'm with some of
[30:19] the older people i begin to wonder why
[30:21] am i in this age group now
[30:23] and i realize well you're in it because
[30:25] you're in it
[30:27] let's say you come up to me the other
[30:28] day and she says
[30:29] hey how you doing she acted as she knew
[30:31] me she how you doing you didn't you
[30:33] didn't want to bring janet to the y
[30:35] today
[30:36] [Music]
[30:43] i said
[30:44] no it was a little cold i didn't feel to
[30:47] bring her in with me
[30:51] i'm just beginning to wonder it's like
[30:52] who does she think i am
[30:55] satan's always messing with your
[30:57] identity he's always messing with your
[30:58] mind he's always misinterpreting the
[31:01] word to you even the word
[31:04] even the precious word the message satan
[31:06] will use quotes against you
[31:10] so that's why we have to be careful
[31:12] there's only one person qualified to
[31:14] handle and to live this word and that's
[31:16] the holy ghost that wrote it and so if
[31:18] that thought of that quote is not
[31:20] originating by the holy ghost you need
[31:22] to scan it and be careful because the
[31:24] satan may be using the bible and using a
[31:26] quote to defeat you and if it's
[31:28] defeating you
[31:32] it's not right
[31:34] because we're not called to defeat
[31:37] my brother and sister we are not called
[31:39] to live an everyday life of defeat we
[31:42] are called to live in victory
[31:44] [Applause]
[31:46] every one of you are called to live in
[31:49] victory over the enemy every day
[31:52] we may not do it every day but it's not
[31:54] because of god
[31:56] but we're called to live in victory
[31:58] every day you're called to live in
[31:59] victory every day
[32:01] especially over your thought life
[32:04] so i'm going to go back to the beginning
[32:06] now what i mentioned that it's when we
[32:09] are born again and when we see the word
[32:11] of god it's at a soul level
[32:13] and but we know when we have been taught
[32:15] that
[32:16] this begins the journey because
[32:18] two parts of us the spirit and the body
[32:22] are not
[32:23] regenerated
[32:25] so god through the new birth of the holy
[32:27] ghost has dealt with you at a soul level
[32:30] and
[32:32] there's something that keeps coming up
[32:33] to me
[32:35] in the last few years how i viewed the
[32:37] message i've always i've never had a
[32:39] a bad
[32:41] uh perception of
[32:42] why god sent this i thank god for that
[32:44] but i understand people sometimes who've
[32:46] been their thoughts have been twisted
[32:48] that they got a bad perception of
[32:49] brother branham in the message
[32:51] i never had a lot of that
[32:53] until i hear other people talk about it
[32:55] but but something's been coming up and
[32:57] how important it is to see this message
[33:00] and what it was really sent for
[33:04] because if you stand back and look at it
[33:06] you can never get a negative reason why
[33:09] this message came through a prophet in
[33:11] the last days you can never conclude on
[33:13] a negative reason you can't humanize it
[33:15] even though there's a human part of it
[33:17] of the man definitely a human part
[33:20] but i think of john the baptist there
[33:21] was a man sent from god whose name was
[33:23] john the baptist he was a flesh human
[33:25] being he made mistakes he was a fleshy
[33:28] me but god sent him
[33:30] and so we have to separate that so now
[33:31] when we look at the message there's
[33:33] something that keeps popping up in my
[33:34] mind that it's important for people to
[33:36] see this message and what it was really
[33:38] sent for and i can summarize for you god
[33:41] needed to speak his thoughts to his sons
[33:44] and daughters of god
[33:46] in the last days
[33:47] are you with me
[33:49] god needed to come down and for one
[33:52] purpose one main purpose and that's to
[33:55] speak directly and intimately
[33:58] with his sons and daughters of god in
[34:01] the last days
[34:03] and and and and give them the order for
[34:06] them to come to full restoration and
[34:09] full victory in the last days because
[34:11] the prophecy is shall come to full
[34:14] victory you talk about a victory the
[34:16] ultimate victory of the rapture
[34:20] i like that one can you say man
[34:23] that's what sons will come to at the
[34:24] last days that's what the bible says you
[34:26] talk about a victory a victory that this
[34:29] word will be so powerful and so consume
[34:31] us and in our minds and in our hearts
[34:33] until this body
[34:35] this body can no longer handle the
[34:38] revelation because it wasn't meant for
[34:40] all this revelation that finally this
[34:42] body gives up and you go to your new
[34:45] word body that can handle all of it
[34:50] and that'll be a victory someday when i
[34:52] step into
[34:53] that body
[34:55] but we can have some victories here in
[34:57] these bodies that's the miracle of the
[34:59] blood is it's powerful enough to bring a
[35:02] body that's completely unconverted
[35:04] never wants to serve god never wants to
[35:07] come to church never has a desire i'm
[35:10] talking about this body now never
[35:12] wants to line up never no no you don't
[35:15] want to do it it never will but the
[35:17] power of the holy ghost can bring an
[35:19] unconverted body under subjection and
[35:22] say buddy you're doing it
[35:25] because i want to glorify god in my life
[35:27] and your body's going to glorify god not
[35:30] the world not the devil not the kingdom
[35:33] of the enemy this body's gonna bring
[35:35] glory to almighty god
[35:38] even though you're not converted in the
[35:39] body
[35:41] pretty powerful can you say amen paul
[35:44] talks about the infirmity infirmity of
[35:46] this flesh this flesh is an infirmity
[35:48] it's like a sickness
[35:51] and it always will be
[35:53] but it's going to line up with the word
[35:55] whether it wants to or
[35:56] not and this is where we have victories
[35:59] about the thought life
[36:01] if you leave it alone it'll always
[36:03] wander off
[36:05] and if you leave it alone satan will
[36:07] plant more thoughts in your mind
[36:09] because it's not converted it's not
[36:10] converted
[36:12] so now we
[36:15] have
[36:16] some
[36:17] powerful things that we must look at
[36:20] in the level of the soul he's come
[36:22] but the message has come
[36:25] the message has come
[36:27] to bring the thoughts of god to his sons
[36:29] to bring them to full restoration and
[36:31] victory in the last days if you're
[36:32] listening today here or online the
[36:35] message the precious message of god has
[36:37] come the man has gone he's fulfilled his
[36:40] commission but god sent this message to
[36:43] breathe on his sons and daughters
[36:46] what they will need to know by
[36:47] revelation to come to full victory
[36:54] pours out to his sons in the last days
[36:56] revelations of who they are
[36:58] from the fall in the garden
[37:01] to to the godhead
[37:04] to predestination
[37:06] why is the last day's messengers
[37:08] elaborating messenger elaborating on all
[37:10] these points why does he have to go back
[37:13] and reveal the truth of what happened in
[37:15] the garden that it wasn't an apple
[37:19] and i said that's you know that's not a
[37:21] big deal it could have been an app no
[37:23] that's a big deal
[37:25] that we understands of god must
[37:27] understand what happened in the garden
[37:29] because we know what we're being
[37:31] restored back to
[37:32] the very reason jesus had to be virgin
[37:35] born shows it was sex in the garden
[37:38] this thing had to be reversed by a
[37:40] virgin birth without sex
[37:44] sons of god needed to know what happened
[37:46] in the garden because why it's going to
[37:49] bring their victory
[37:50] [Applause]
[37:52] that calvary will bring the power to put
[37:55] the devil under your feet
[37:58] and sons will say i am no longer under
[38:00] the fall of the first adam i am under
[38:03] the victory of the second adam jesus
[38:06] christ right now
[38:09] somebody ought to shout hallelujah i'll
[38:11] tell you
[38:12] not because of me but these truths the
[38:14] sons and daughters of god in the last
[38:16] days that's what the message was for
[38:20] it goes into predestination
[38:22] he goes into the seed of god said things
[38:24] we've never heard since the early church
[38:27] fathers
[38:28] if you were a son of god you didn't it
[38:30] wasn't one night at an altar you got
[38:32] saved you were saved in god's mind
[38:34] before the foundation of the world if
[38:36] you're a seed of god i had all my
[38:38] children my sons in me before they were
[38:40] even born and if that's true naturally
[38:42] it's true spiritually if you're a son
[38:44] and daughter of god here this morning
[38:45] you had to be in the loins of the father
[38:47] from the foundation of the world
[38:49] it's a truth it's a revelation and the
[38:52] sons needed to know i didn't get saved
[38:54] one night at an altar but god in his
[38:56] mind knew i would be saved
[39:02] sons of god
[39:04] sons of god and i could go on and on and
[39:07] how many conventions for the last 50
[39:09] years have we shouted and i've enjoyed
[39:12] every moment building the faith of
[39:15] believers and sons and daughters god
[39:17] preached in this word predestination our
[39:19] position in christ preaching it preach
[39:22] until we rise to a place of faith
[39:26] but i find
[39:28] not very much is talked about
[39:33] in conventions and i say that
[39:35] respectfully about our thought life
[39:40] you can't just preach some of it
[39:44] you've got to preach the whole picture
[39:46] if sons are going to come to victory
[39:48] and you don't talk about everyday
[39:50] thought life
[39:51] they can't come to their full victory
[39:55] so you can be in a prayer line you can
[39:57] come through you can receive the holy
[39:58] spirit you can be delivered you can have
[40:01] the devils cast out of you
[40:03] but i just want to present to you
[40:05] what good would it do if you have a
[40:06] spirit and the power of the name of
[40:08] jesus and the church can cast out devils
[40:10] and that person hasn't learned that the
[40:12] same power that can cast the spirit off
[40:14] of you
[40:16] can be used in you to cast the devil out
[40:18] of your mind
[40:20] because you might go monday and the
[40:21] devil's plaguing you in your mind still
[40:26] the same name of jesus in the church can
[40:28] cast out
[40:31] casting down imaginations
[40:36] in every high thing that exalteth itself
[40:39] now you have things sometimes happening
[40:41] in the church and i think some of them
[40:42] happen because
[40:44] somebody's preaching all the wealth
[40:47] of the
[40:48] revelation to sons and their position
[40:51] but they're ignoring a very important
[40:54] message that god breathed on us as well
[40:56] the greatest
[40:58] battle
[40:59] ever fought
[41:04] why did he need to take a two or three
[41:07] hour message and
[41:08] and that's your homework this week i
[41:10] want everybody if you would to listen to
[41:12] it take your time meditate on it because
[41:15] god certainly breathed some things to us
[41:21] yet your battle is not one another
[41:24] your battle's not really with your wife
[41:30] not battles not with your husband or
[41:31] your teenager
[41:32] really when it comes down to it
[41:36] it shows a place in the beginning where
[41:38] the battleground people just like every
[41:39] nation choose where's the battle going
[41:40] to be what field it's going to be and he
[41:42] said it's going to be it's going to be
[41:44] from the garden of eden we know it's the
[41:46] mind because the first place satan got
[41:49] into is the mind of eve
[41:52] that's the battleground the chosen you
[41:54] didn't choose the background okay you
[41:56] would have told something different
[41:57] probably you didn't choose it
[41:59] but it was chosen back then
[42:01] and now i think when we come to the end
[42:03] time greatest battle ever thought had to
[42:05] be preached to sons and daughters of god
[42:09] because
[42:10] we have reached a place in our world in
[42:12] satan's eden
[42:14] that our minds
[42:16] are
[42:17] there is a
[42:18] there is the greatest competition
[42:22] for our thought life than has ever been
[42:25] before
[42:27] teenagers you're listening
[42:29] we live in the greatest time when satan
[42:31] is vying for your mind time
[42:36] what you think about and what images are
[42:38] put in front of you to think about later
[42:41] this is the worst
[42:45] so god knowing that he says i'm going to
[42:47] have to preach something very specific
[42:50] not
[42:51] just about predestination
[42:54] not about what happened in the garden
[42:56] not about there's no eternal hell
[42:59] not about the seed of god i'm going to
[43:02] give all that to them but i'm going to
[43:03] preach a message
[43:05] called
[43:06] the greatest battle ever fought and in
[43:08] that message i'm going to allow my
[43:10] prophet to expand upon you're a
[43:13] three-part being
[43:15] you have a spirit
[43:17] you have five inlets to the body of fine
[43:19] living that's to your spirit and if
[43:21] you're a christian and you let those
[43:23] areas
[43:24] if you ignore those areas and you don't
[43:26] stand as a soldier in those areas
[43:29] you will be defeated
[43:32] so god says i'm going to talk about it
[43:34] through my prophet
[43:36] oh it's wonderful
[43:38] so he begins to elaborate on something
[43:40] that i don't hear a lot of messages
[43:42] about
[43:43] even from me
[43:46] but
[43:46] what you think about every day
[43:49] is really
[43:51] turns out to be where you're at and
[43:53] where you stay
[43:56] i would love to have all of us me
[43:58] starting with me have this goal for the
[44:00] year of psalms one and two
[44:03] that i could just replace
[44:05] negative and thoughts of satan and
[44:08] meditate on the word of god
[44:11] my mind and my heart to be filled
[44:14] and when anything if i hear gossip or i
[44:17] hear something
[44:19] you know what we hear those things for
[44:20] one thing that we should be a prayer
[44:23] warrior and go to our knees in prayer
[44:25] say god i heard about this situation i
[44:28] heard about this person he even spoke
[44:31] against me
[44:33] but i can do two things
[44:35] i can just let it start
[44:37] why do they speak against me
[44:40] where'd they get that from
[44:41] well on sunday i'm going to get up and
[44:42] defend myself
[44:47] don't smile at me that's the way you
[44:48] think too
[44:49] you're thinking about revenge and you're
[44:51] thinking about all
[44:53] and really what a believer should do i
[44:55] heard it
[44:56] if it's
[44:57] another thing we look at is is it truth
[44:59] or is it a lie
[45:01] sometimes you don't know that right away
[45:02] but if somebody has been hurt or
[45:04] somebody has been sick or some word or
[45:06] somebody's gossiped
[45:08] our thing to do is think about it for a
[45:10] minute but then we're on our knees or
[45:11] we're before the lord wherever and we
[45:14] take it to the lord and we leave it
[45:17] there god
[45:18] bring deliverance if they're telling a
[45:21] lie god change let them see the truth
[45:24] and guess what we just we just freed up
[45:27] our thought life
[45:29] instead of losing sleep over it for
[45:32] five years
[45:35] we laugh but people can do it
[45:39] i will not allow that to cause me to
[45:42] lose sleep unless i wake up sometimes at
[45:44] three or four in the morning which is
[45:45] very really
[45:47] i know when i wake up then the lord's
[45:49] wanting to
[45:50] burden me with something
[45:52] burns are a different story
[45:54] what do you do with a burden though you
[45:55] don't lay awake and think how you're
[45:57] gonna figure it out
[45:58] you take it to the lord i'm gonna
[46:00] release this to the lord
[46:02] i get burdens for you
[46:04] mostly for this congregation someone
[46:05] will come in my mind four five six in
[46:07] the morning
[46:08] and for me to get up that early is very
[46:10] strange it's
[46:12] borderline sinful actually to me i just
[46:16] i mean there's a six o'clock in the
[46:18] morning like there is at night i don't
[46:19] know i didn't know that but
[46:21] well i know when i wake up and i have
[46:23] this person the congregation on my heart
[46:25] i know god's done something and so then
[46:28] i i go to prayer about it i do i'm not
[46:30] up here making myself spiritual
[46:33] i'm not a super spiritual person i just
[46:35] try i just try to live for the lord
[46:37] but i know the lord when he moves on my
[46:39] heart it's time to pray
[46:41] and then if i release it to the lord
[46:43] because i know have the power
[46:44] i can sometimes i can go back to sleep
[46:47] because i've given it to the lord
[46:50] sons of god got to learn friends
[46:53] you cannot let thoughts that are from
[46:56] satan dominate your thought life
[46:59] for days
[47:01] you don't have to
[47:06] [Music]
[47:08] jairus saying amen
[47:13] god pours out to his son's revelations
[47:15] of who they are in all rapturing faith
[47:17] to build the faith of sons victory faith
[47:20] perfect faith
[47:22] even bless us with specifics in the
[47:24] message
[47:25] how to love
[47:27] how to dress
[47:29] how to act as a christian
[47:31] how to treat one another as christians
[47:32] in the world
[47:34] how young people should not kiss before
[47:36] marriage
[47:39] taught us sons and daughters god taught
[47:41] sons of god what a beautiful woman is
[47:44] what is beauty in the eyes of god he
[47:45] taught you sisters what's beauty in the
[47:47] eyes of god
[47:48] and that that she didn't need the makeup
[47:52] and flaunting the outward looks in
[47:54] apparel god said you don't have to do
[47:57] that
[48:01] i'll tell you what beauty is
[48:03] i'll tell you what it is what is it it's
[48:06] god breathing on his sons and daughters
[48:09] because
[48:10] sons and daughters will come to a full
[48:13] victory
[48:19] i love it i love it you still with me
[48:23] but i just draw your attention to the
[48:25] greatest battle for a fault because for
[48:26] the first time he spends a lot of time
[48:28] he's mentioned those things before but
[48:30] he spends a lot of time on where satan
[48:32] will work even on a believer that's what
[48:34] he says in greatest battle even on a
[48:36] believer
[48:37] that the soul has been
[48:39] excuse me at the soul level satan has
[48:41] been sealed out
[48:43] but if the mind is open ground to the
[48:45] devil
[48:46] the devil will take it
[48:48] you can be have satan sealed out of your
[48:50] soul until the day of your redemption
[48:52] but if you open your mind to the wrong
[48:54] thoughts satan will take advantage
[48:58] so we're now through greatest battle
[49:00] ever fault where god is speaking to sons
[49:02] at the level of their mind at the level
[49:04] of their thought life at the level of
[49:07] memory imagination conscience effective
[49:09] reason god could have left that alone
[49:10] god could continue to talk about
[49:12] predestination you're a seed of god
[49:14] raising power praise the lord but no he
[49:16] didn't leave it alone because you would
[49:17] have to live another 50 60 years
[49:19] hopefully it's not anymore in a battle
[49:21] of your mind can you say man where you
[49:23] could be have god sealed in your soul
[49:26] and the devil sealed out of your soul at
[49:27] that level and still if you open your
[49:30] thought life to him you can live in
[49:31] defeat
[49:36] still if you feed on the wrong things
[49:38] you're going to live in defeat
[49:41] still if you watch the wrong movies and
[49:42] watch the wrong songs and listen to the
[49:44] wrong songs and watch and read the wrong
[49:47] things and your phone is dominating and
[49:49] all the social media if you if you fill
[49:52] your mind with those things no matter
[49:55] how much you feel you have a love of god
[49:57] you're gonna stay in a state of being
[49:59] defeated and god does not want you to be
[50:02] defeated he wants you to have power and
[50:05] control over your thought life
[50:12] so he wasn't just speaking at a soul
[50:13] level to his stuns and greatest battle
[50:15] or fault
[50:16] greatest battle
[50:18] and in the ministry that was calling a
[50:20] church back to casting out devils now he
[50:23] takes an entire message on the decision
[50:26] and the thought level he said why
[50:29] why was the mind chose and incidentally
[50:32] hit this 1962 and he's teaching sons
[50:35] that the the battleground that was
[50:37] chosen was your mind 1962 it's
[50:40] interesting that some of the writers
[50:41] christian writers are just now
[50:43] discovering
[50:46] uh what's the woman women preacher
[50:48] what's her name on the tv
[50:52] joyce
[50:53] wrote a book three or four years ago
[50:55] the battle in the mind
[50:57] this giggling just wrote a book talking
[50:59] about the thought life and the mind and
[51:01] that's where the battle is that's what
[51:02] he says that's where the battle is
[51:03] they're just discovering it
[51:05] late can you say man
[51:07] what god showed his prophet to give to
[51:09] his sons now that you can't just say i'm
[51:12] saved and i'm filled with the holy ghost
[51:14] and live an open-minded life to satan's
[51:16] thoughts
[51:17] can't do it
[51:19] can't do it
[51:20] doesn't work that way so he elaborates
[51:22] he talks about it and i'm just going to
[51:23] read a few just a few quotes for it
[51:25] before before we try to bring it to down
[51:27] a little bit today but in that message
[51:30] if god spoke to his sons through the
[51:32] message to give power for victory in
[51:33] their position then he is giving our
[51:35] victory in our thought life as well he's
[51:37] proclaiming there's a victory brother
[51:39] branham is so positive and so bold to
[51:42] draw soldiers to a place that if we
[51:45] would stand with the word of god and not
[51:48] let satan get a doubt in our mind
[51:50] about your healing the doubt in your
[51:52] mind about your restoration if we could
[51:54] stand as soldiers against what he's
[51:56] putting in our minds we can be a
[51:58] victorious people
[52:00] we could be a mighty army can you say
[52:02] man
[52:03] he's giving victory to our thought life
[52:06] greatest battle it's not
[52:09] listen now
[52:11] greatest battle ever fought if you
[52:12] listen to it this week it's not for the
[52:14] shallow
[52:15] feeling
[52:17] an emotionally based christian it's not
[52:19] for them
[52:20] it's winning the battle of the mind each
[52:22] day casting down every thought
[52:26] before i read some of the quotes in that
[52:28] message so familiar of story with you
[52:31] but it bears repeating i should have
[52:32] mentioned it wednesday night because i
[52:34] was talking about positioning yourself
[52:36] and he says
[52:37] nellie sanders gave her heart to the
[52:38] lord
[52:39] got an experience with the lord
[52:42] prophet meets her one day out
[52:44] and she said oh i've been so scarred by
[52:46] the world
[52:47] i'm not wearing makeup but i got the
[52:49] scars of wearing all that and doing all
[52:50] that i wish i looked like your wife
[52:52] they're so fresh they grew up in the
[52:53] church and he said she's saying i wish i
[52:55] was that you know and i'm also so
[52:57] scarred
[52:58] and brother brandt says well sister the
[53:00] blood of jesus christ cleanses us all
[53:02] from all of us from sin and from the
[53:04] past it's over you're christian a few
[53:06] months later you know she was a dancer
[53:09] she was later she's on her way down the
[53:11] street during the day towards the end of
[53:13] the day to go buy material to buy to to
[53:16] make dresses because she didn't have any
[53:18] so she's going down there and on the way
[53:20] up and up the stairs
[53:22] it's the old dance hall
[53:24] and she stops right there just to listen
[53:26] to it and you know what brother bram
[53:27] says that's where she got in trouble
[53:29] wednesday night i was on you don't stand
[53:32] in the way of sinners you're not going
[53:34] down the wave centers you're just
[53:35] standing watching wow what are they
[53:37] doing
[53:38] watching them on the internet where are
[53:39] they going what are they doing what are
[53:41] they wearing next
[53:43] let's stand there and watch
[53:44] the direction they're going there's
[53:46] another thing for you to watch
[53:49] she stopped and she said it won't hurt
[53:51] me just to listen
[53:52] just a little bit and she listened and
[53:55] she said i remember that song and she
[53:58] stopped she said he
[54:00] he said you shouldn't have stopped right
[54:01] there
[54:02] let me let me go ahead to the end of the
[54:03] story and then back up
[54:05] she comes that night later
[54:07] she's pounding out the door
[54:09] brother branham i failed i'm lost i've
[54:12] crossed the line oh i did this and he
[54:14] said what's wrong with you so why he
[54:16] talks to her he she tells him what he
[54:17] did and there's a spirit that comes out
[54:19] of her that becomes actually visible
[54:21] comes out of the back of her and it's a
[54:23] big bat-like creature
[54:26] with long hair and he said we've seen it
[54:28] come out of the background she was and
[54:30] rattling the door he had a friend there
[54:32] that he had brought home that was drunk
[54:33] to take care of him he sobered up real
[54:35] quick when that demon was in a room he
[54:37] ran to the other room
[54:38] no one messing with that
[54:40] so that's the end of the story he prays
[54:42] for her that she gets delivered from
[54:44] that spirit
[54:45] not possessed by it but a spirit come on
[54:47] here now you go back earlier in the day
[54:49] and you see she stopped there she
[54:50] listened a little bit it's not going to
[54:52] hurt you and then she found herself
[54:54] heading up the stairs and this is why
[54:55] she headed up the stairs everybody
[54:56] listening she reasoned in her mind she
[54:59] says i wonder if i went up there i could
[55:01] share the lord with them and witness to
[55:03] them
[55:05] what a religious nice thought
[55:09] but you're on the devil's ground
[55:12] so before she took that bat-like
[55:16] evil creature into her and if if if if
[55:19] you don't know that these things are
[55:21] real in the other dimension right now
[55:26] brother braham said they were here in
[55:28] the service he said angels of god are
[55:30] here right now and demons are here
[55:33] fighting and he says your faith
[55:36] determines which way that battle goes
[55:37] right now it's happening in this service
[55:39] right now that's why some of you get mad
[55:41] at me because i'm i'm touching on some
[55:43] demons that are trying to bother you
[55:45] that's why you get upset but if you only
[55:46] realize this is another battle in the
[55:48] other dimension but i've got the word
[55:50] i'm preaching that in the name of jesus
[55:51] christ i can drive away and cast out
[55:54] devils
[55:55] [Applause]
[55:57] but i want you to notice before that
[55:59] ugly spirit came on her it was in her
[56:02] thought process
[56:04] that opened her mind
[56:07] to get her on the dance floor the rest
[56:09] of the evening dancing around again and
[56:12] through the dancing she took on this
[56:14] ugly ugly-looking bat-like long-haired
[56:17] creature of a demon if you you are blind
[56:19] if you don't know those things are real
[56:22] i'll just let you know you'll know
[56:24] they're real if you catch yourself in
[56:26] tribulation because everything that we
[56:28] see in movies and all that we don't see
[56:29] in the dimension are going to be very
[56:31] visible
[56:33] come on now you believers you know
[56:34] that's true
[56:35] if you don't believe they're true and
[56:36] here right now you just wait along for
[56:38] tribulation and you're going to see how
[56:40] real they are
[56:41] they are
[56:42] real but before she had any of that on
[56:45] her or got delivered of that
[56:47] she just opened her mind
[56:50] and that's how the process started nelly
[56:52] sanders
[56:53] thanked the lord got delivered that
[56:54] night and the spirit went out and she
[56:56] was peaceful again
[56:58] but boy what a what a thing
[57:01] and why didn't why the brother bram take
[57:03] something from years ago and bring it up
[57:04] in greatest battle or fall because he's
[57:05] talking about your thought life
[57:10] he's teaching sons that your thought
[57:12] life every day matters
[57:14] your reasoning with the word of god say
[57:16] well this is all right and that's okay
[57:18] and i want and your dominant thought i
[57:20] want this more than i want more than
[57:22] anything more than the word more when
[57:24] counsel i'm going to get it i'm going
[57:26] for it you better watch your life
[57:28] because he will give you the fruits of
[57:30] your thoughts if you have a dominant
[57:32] thought you're going to get what you
[57:33] want
[57:35] but is it the will of god
[57:39] we human beings can make a dominant
[57:40] thought and we can accomplish what we
[57:42] want no matter if the whole entire world
[57:44] is against us
[57:46] but that's not god's path that's not
[57:47] god's way
[57:50] your thought life can convince you
[57:52] of things that are wrong and the word is
[57:55] the only thing that corrects it
[57:57] please excuse me for being straight with
[57:59] you this morning
[58:01] i feel heavy in my spirit that if you'll
[58:03] catch this every one of you we can live
[58:06] even a greater victorious life this week
[58:11] this week
[58:13] talking about you
[58:15] talking about me
[58:16] so he teaches us that satan tries to
[58:18] come in our imagination our affection
[58:20] our reasoning in this message he's
[58:21] working from the inside first the first
[58:23] quote says that's your battle he's
[58:25] talked about in ali sanders he says kill
[58:27] him at the beginning kill him at the
[58:29] beginning and stop him dead in his track
[58:31] it ain't how long you make the war
[58:33] linger it's stop it right now if you'll
[58:35] come and you'll keep the memories and
[58:36] conscience everything thinking about
[58:38] well i might fail it might not be right
[58:40] don't do that at all look at that
[58:42] thought i might fail it might not be
[58:44] right don't think that way dump that
[58:47] thought out
[58:48] you throw aside everything and open up
[58:49] the channel and say god your word is
[58:52] eternally true and it's for me if the
[58:54] whole church fails if the whole church
[58:57] fails if the whole world fails yet i
[59:00] can't fail because i'm taking your word
[59:03] there's the battle that's the thing
[59:06] talk about a place of power if the whole
[59:09] church goes awry i can't because i'm in
[59:12] the word and the word can't fail thus i
[59:14] can't fail
[59:16] the next quote says if you got your
[59:17] senses see taste feel smell and hear and
[59:19] they're all right they're all right but
[59:21] don't trust them unless they agree with
[59:23] the word they're all right but if they
[59:24] disagree with the word don't you listen
[59:26] to them now imaginations conscious
[59:28] memories reasons and affection they're
[59:30] all right if they agree with the word
[59:32] but if your affection doesn't agree with
[59:34] the word get rid of it you blow a flu
[59:36] right quick
[59:37] see if your reason disagrees with the
[59:39] word get away from it that's right the
[59:40] engine if your memory if your
[59:42] imagination if your conscience anything
[59:43] disagrees with that what's on the inside
[59:45] get rid of it the next quote he said the
[59:47] raging the battle rage when eve opened
[59:49] up her mind to listen to her reasoning
[59:52] that's the fluid come in that's the
[59:54] channel it run down her reasoning she in
[59:56] her soul she reasoned her eyes was sight
[1:00:00] excuse me her eyes was sight she saw the
[1:00:02] serpent he was beautiful he was handsome
[1:00:05] far better than her own husband
[1:00:07] he was the most subtle of all the beasts
[1:00:10] of the field and he was probably a
[1:00:12] fairer man than her husband he looked
[1:00:14] like a great masculine beast standing
[1:00:16] there how great he was and he was trying
[1:00:19] to tell her what a great thing it was
[1:00:21] and the first thing she did she opened
[1:00:23] up her mind and when she did human
[1:00:26] reasonings caught it why wouldn't that
[1:00:28] be a thrill
[1:00:31] it's not too far from the devil's
[1:00:33] thoughts to us today
[1:00:39] so he said we've got to be bold
[1:00:41] and be willing to take these things one
[1:00:43] thing at a time
[1:00:45] what's got to be done to live a
[1:00:47] victorious life
[1:00:50] okay it's this in my life we're going to
[1:00:52] tackle it with the word of god you may
[1:00:54] not be able to tackle all of it today
[1:00:55] but take it one thing at a time he gave
[1:00:57] a servant he gave an example of peter
[1:00:59] carthright
[1:01:01] going and he developed lead just felt
[1:01:03] led to go to a church and start a work
[1:01:05] so he goes to the city he gets ridiculed
[1:01:06] for it he buys this church and he's got
[1:01:08] to fix it up so he's what's next what's
[1:01:10] next what's next what's going to be done
[1:01:12] next we've got to get and wash the
[1:01:13] windows and get the church over so he's
[1:01:14] in there because he's got a commission
[1:01:16] to start a church and start preaching
[1:01:17] the gospel he's doing all this what's
[1:01:19] got to be done next i'm doing this
[1:01:20] because god told me to do it what's got
[1:01:22] to be done next i'm doing this because
[1:01:23] god told me to do it and then the town
[1:01:25] bowling says he knows doesn't he know
[1:01:27] that anybody that does anything in this
[1:01:28] town has to come through me big guy
[1:01:30] peter carthrice a little guy and so he
[1:01:32] says i'm going to go over there and talk
[1:01:33] to him so he's out there and he's
[1:01:34] washing the windows peter carthage and
[1:01:36] this big bully says what are you doing

[1:01:39] of the lord
[1:01:41] i'm going to continue on goes right back
[1:01:42] to washing the windows didn't even worry
[1:01:44] how big this guy was and then this guy
[1:01:46] says you know have you heard that
[1:01:48] anybody who does anything in the city
[1:01:49] has got to go through me and peter
[1:01:50] carthage said okay if you're next then
[1:01:53] he goes over there and he rose up his
[1:01:55] sleeves he says if you're next then i'm
[1:01:57] coming after you
[1:02:01] and he tackled him down and said okay i
[1:02:03] took care of you what's next
[1:02:06] for the rest of that's the faith that we
[1:02:08] need that's the boldness that we need

[1:02:14] all right if i got to tackle you and
[1:02:16] beat you down i'll do you next and
[1:02:18] that's what you need to do if your
[1:02:19] imagination is not under control of the

[1:02:25] taking my imagination and we're going to

[1:02:39] and i'm going to tackle this
[1:02:41] if this is next
[1:02:43] and then he says after peter carthage
[1:02:45] he looked like a great masculine beast
[1:02:47] standing there how great he was and he
[1:02:48] was trying to tell here what a great
[1:02:50] thing it was and the first thing she did

[1:05:13] in and march
[1:05:15] with
[1:05:16] the word
[1:05:18] that is a real soldier
[1:05:22] praise the lord
[1:05:29] get into these scriptures
[1:05:30] next time
[1:05:32] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[1:05:34] was great and earth and that every
[1:05:35] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:05:37] was only evil continually did you notice
[1:05:39] how the evilness and the acts of
[1:05:41] evilness were tied to the thought life
[1:05:45] that they couldn't think a good thought
[1:05:46] they couldn't think of pure thought
[1:05:48] anymore this thing is real it wasn't
[1:05:50] just they were doing evil in the days of
[1:05:52] noah it's that every imagination of
[1:05:54] their thoughts of the heart was evil
[1:05:55] continually psalms to the wicked through
[1:05:57] the pride of his countenance will not
[1:05:59] seek after god god is not in all of his
[1:06:02] thoughts
[1:06:04] psalms 94 the lord knoweth the thoughts
[1:06:06] of man that they are
[1:06:08] vanity emptiness
[1:06:10] nothing the thoughts of man you don't
[1:06:12] want the thoughts of man you want the
[1:06:13] thoughts of god
[1:06:17] jeremiah 6 says hear o earth behold i
[1:06:19] will bring evil upon this people even
[1:06:21] the fruit of their thoughts you want it
[1:06:24] bad enough you think about it all the
[1:06:25] time god's going to give you the fruit
[1:06:27] of your thoughts because they have not
[1:06:28] hearkened unto my words door unto my law
[1:06:30] but rejected notice it's in the thought
[1:06:32] life that they're coming down and that
[1:06:34] god says you're going to eat you want it
[1:06:36] so bad you're going to eat the fruit of
[1:06:37] your own thoughts psalms 19 though i
[1:06:40] hate vain thoughts david said i hate
[1:06:42] vain thoughts i'm going to say this
[1:06:43] morning i hate vain thoughts
[1:06:45] but thy law do i love
[1:06:50] search me o god and know my heart try me
[1:06:53] and know my thoughts
[1:06:56] that's when you're inviting the light of
[1:06:57] his word into your thought life and
[1:07:00] saying there is nothing hidden from you
[1:07:02] there is a security checkpoint in my
[1:07:05] thoughts this week
[1:07:08] know my thoughts lord commit thy works
[1:07:10] unto the lord
[1:07:11] and thy thoughts shall be established
[1:07:16] romans 2 15 i was amazed at this
[1:07:18] scripture in the new testament
[1:07:21] because he's talking about
[1:07:22] the people who aren't jews that are
[1:07:24] receiving the holy ghost
[1:07:25] and he points to he says he says they
[1:07:27] got the law written in their hearts they
[1:07:29] don't even know the law but they're
[1:07:31] starting to live out the law even though
[1:07:32] they don't they've never known it
[1:07:35] paul says how does that happen it
[1:07:36] happens because they got the holy ghost
[1:07:38] the one who wrote the law in them and he
[1:07:40] says which show the work of the law
[1:07:41] written in their hearts and that has to
[1:07:43] be by the holy ghost show the law
[1:07:45] written in their hearts their conscience
[1:07:47] also bearing witness and their thoughts
[1:07:49] the meanwhile accusing or else
[1:07:52] excusing one another because this is
[1:07:54] amazing because of the holy ghost in
[1:07:57] their hearts
[1:07:58] their thought life doesn't have to be
[1:08:00] ruled by the law there's something
[1:08:03] working in their thought life that
[1:08:04] actually their thoughts that meanwhile
[1:08:07] accusing yes here's the translation
[1:08:08] sometimes their thoughts tell them that
[1:08:10] they have done wrong now we talked about
[1:08:12] a few weeks ago conviction the holy
[1:08:14] ghost will convict you and this makes
[1:08:15] them guilty and sometimes their thoughts
[1:08:17] tell them that they have done right and
[1:08:19] this makes them not guilty that's all
[1:08:23] happening in the mind of a christian
[1:08:25] every day
[1:08:26] that he don't necessarily have to go get
[1:08:28] a quote god may speak through a quote
[1:08:30] but because the holy ghost is being able
[1:08:32] to take over the thought life can you
[1:08:34] say man the holy ghost will help you
[1:08:36] decide i'm not going to be under this
[1:08:38] guilty thought because it's not true
[1:08:43] this thought that come i did something
[1:08:44] wrong yesterday and i got i haven't
[1:08:46] brought it underneath the blood yet so
[1:08:47] then that's where i convict you says
[1:08:49] you're wrong you're guilty bring it
[1:08:50] underneath the blood that's all
[1:08:52] happening in the thought life of a
[1:08:53] believer
[1:08:54] i love that i'm ending i know i'm ending
[1:08:56] i promise you and sometimes their
[1:08:58] thoughts tell them sometimes their
[1:09:00] thoughts tell them that they have done
[1:09:02] wrong
[1:09:02] and remember this is a holy ghost
[1:09:04] christian and this makes them guilty and
[1:09:06] sometimes their thoughts tell them that
[1:09:08] they have done right
[1:09:10] and this makes them not guilty
[1:09:13] did you notice satan's not allowed in
[1:09:15] that whole thing at all
[1:09:17] only the holy ghost only the word and
[1:09:20] satan's not alone along there to say no
[1:09:23] wait a minute wait a minute i'll decide
[1:09:24] you're guilty you're wrong you're
[1:09:27] unworthy you'll never be anything
[1:09:28] greater he's not allowed in the thought
[1:09:30] life you're deciding by the holy ghost
[1:09:33] you're deciphering those things how many
[1:09:35] want to live a victorious thought life

[1:09:40] lord i want my thoughts

[1:14:17] song years ago when we had a retreat
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:20] and we had a theme at the retreat called
[1:14:22] our mind
[1:14:24] his thoughts
[1:14:26] it's our mind
[1:14:28] but it's his thoughts we want
[1:14:31] invading our thoughts and invading our
[1:14:33] life
[1:14:35] so once again i just asked you lift your
[1:14:37] hand this morning if you want to say i
[1:14:39] want to take this step of a greater
[1:14:41] victory
[1:14:43] in what's coming through this thought
[1:14:45] life every day i want to take this step
[1:14:46] and yield to the lord a little bit more
[1:14:50] let him have
[1:14:52] this domain let his thoughts
[1:14:54] fill it
[1:14:57] will you go so far and say i'm willing
[1:15:00] brother paul before the lord i'm willing
[1:15:02] to separate myself and pull back
[1:15:04] away from things that's filling my
[1:15:06] thoughts with
[1:15:08] wrong things maybe they're dirty things
[1:15:11] but maybe they're just negative things
[1:15:14] maybe they're consuming your time maybe
[1:15:15] they're okay but they just consume so
[1:15:17] much and you don't spend hardly any time
[1:15:19] in the word of god just raise your hand
[1:15:21] say help me
[1:15:22] help me lord
[1:15:24] help me to make those steps today lord
[1:15:27] nobody can do that for me i have to do
[1:15:29] it my wife can't do it for me my sons
[1:15:31] and daughters can't do it a pastor can't
[1:15:33] do it for me
[1:15:35] i have to make a decision
[1:15:38] and the reason that the battleground was
[1:15:40] chosen of the mind by the ramps is
[1:15:42] because decisions are made
[1:15:44] from the mind
[1:15:46] if god can deal with us at that level as
[1:15:49] sons
[1:15:50] i believe satan is really on the run
[1:15:55] satan
[1:15:56] is shaken in his boots
[1:15:58] to know that sons and daughters
[1:16:01] have control of their thought life
[1:16:04] what great victories lie ahead lord
[1:16:07] for these lives what great victories lie
[1:16:09] ahead for the bride
[1:16:12] she can
[1:16:12] surrender herself more
[1:16:15] in this realm that nobody sees in this
[1:16:17] realm that's hidden from everybody
[1:16:19] except you
[1:16:20] what great mighty supernatural things
[1:16:24] can be done in transformations
[1:16:26] when this bride begins to yield
[1:16:29] what she's thinking about every day
[1:16:32] help me as a pastor be an example lord
[1:16:35] nobody sees my thoughts either
[1:16:38] congregation can't see what i think
[1:16:39] about every day
[1:16:41] my wife can't see that
[1:16:44] may i set an example lord and say let
[1:16:47] every thought be brought into captivity
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:51] scanning it through the scanner
[1:16:54] and make sure there's nothing there
[1:16:57] that's trying to get through security
[1:17:00] lord
[1:17:01] plant these things deep and richly in
[1:17:03] the hearts of the people i pray
[1:17:06] we commit so much to you lord everything
[1:17:08] is belongs to you today
[1:17:11] every life is important to you every
[1:17:13] soul no matter what 9 11's we've been
[1:17:16] through
[1:17:17] we learn from it
[1:17:20] we look at our 9 11's lord and we say
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:25] you meant it for good you mean it for
[1:17:27] good because we learn
[1:17:29] we have to put a greater security on our
[1:17:31] thoughts
[1:17:33] forgive us if we make mistakes lord
[1:17:36] clean us wash us
[1:17:39] may we leave here different people today
[1:17:41] than we ever were
[1:17:42] before by your word we will prevail
[1:17:47] in jesus name
[1:17:50] thank you lord
