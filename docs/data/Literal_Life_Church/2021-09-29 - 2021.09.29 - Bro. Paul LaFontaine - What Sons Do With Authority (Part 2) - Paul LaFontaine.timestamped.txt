[0:00] same text we read last wednesday because
[0:01] i promised we'd finish this subject
[0:04] on what sons do with authority what sons
[0:06] do with authority that they have
[0:09] and it's in luke chapter 9 51 and we'll
[0:11] read the same scripture we read last
[0:12] week and it came to pass when the time
[0:15] was come that he should be received up
[0:16] he steadfastly set his face to go to
[0:18] jerusalem
[0:20] and sent messengers before his face and
[0:22] they went and entered into a village of
[0:24] the samaritans to make ready for him and
[0:27] they did not receive him because his
[0:29] face was as though he would go to
[0:31] jerusalem so the city didn't refuse the
[0:33] samaritans didn't receive him
[0:34] and when his disciples james and john
[0:37] saw this they said lord wilt thou that
[0:39] we command fire to come down from heaven
[0:42] and consume these guys even as elias did
[0:46] but he turned and rebuked them and said
[0:48] ye know not what manner of spirit ye are
[0:51] of and i was saying last
[0:53] in talking about what sons do with
[0:54] authority these disciples were certainly
[0:57] not ready to use the authority of god
[0:59] yet
[1:01] and this is how jesus answered this what
[1:03] we'll speak from tonight because this is
[1:04] where he teaches us what the what the
[1:06] authority is for for the son of man is
[1:09] not come to destroy men's lives
[1:12] but to save them
[1:15] the son of man has not come to destroy
[1:17] men's life but to save them so we can
[1:19] say if we have authority and god gives
[1:22] authority if it's god's authority it has
[1:24] one purpose to save lives
[1:27] not destroy lives and i also say if this
[1:30] sword is not to use against one another
[1:33] or family the sword is for the enemy
[1:37] when we start using it on one another
[1:38] then the enemy sits back and don't have
[1:40] to do anything
[1:41] so he's focused and this thing is not to
[1:43] destroy the sword is not to destroy
[1:46] anybody but the enemy but it's not to
[1:48] destroy other people's lives it's not to
[1:50] destroy people or cities in this case
[1:53] it's actually to save lives
[1:56] because how many know people need to be
[1:57] saved
[1:59] people need salvation of christ today
[2:01] but also they need to be saved from
[2:03] situations and if god gives us authority
[2:07] then we could say the right word
[2:08] sometimes or live the right life that
[2:10] people can be saved from situations that
[2:13] seem impossible
[2:15] he wants us to use our authority to save
[2:18] lives not destroy them
[2:21] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[2:22] this evening together we pray it's a
[2:24] short time we spend
[2:26] that there will be such a substance that
[2:28] comes lord from what we say through your
[2:30] anointing that it would be such a
[2:32] foundational thing such a a solid thing
[2:35] for people to go home with tonight
[2:37] and for people to just feed on and be
[2:40] fed lord we just pray that you'll bless
[2:42] every part of the service plus the
[2:43] weekend coming up we're looking forward
[2:45] to the services with brother diggs and
[2:47] we pray you'll bless our fall fellowship
[2:48] together for the church here and just
[2:50] pray you being in everything and your
[2:52] protection your love around us we ask it
[2:55] in jesus name amen god bless you may be
[2:58] seated tonight now you know i don't know
[3:00] what it is when i go into these men's
[3:02] meetings
[3:04] there's a side of me that's so nervous
[3:06] and doesn't want to do it and believe it
[3:08] or not i just have been preaching for
[3:09] years and i can still get very nervous
[3:11] i love preaching at home here i'd rather
[3:13] just stay at home you know but when i
[3:15] get preach out something like that i get
[3:16] real nervous and so lord what am i going
[3:18] to say but something happens like two or
[3:20] three weeks before when i know i have
[3:22] services and the lord just comes and
[3:24] just floods me floods me floods my mind
[3:28] floods my heart with all kinds of
[3:30] different things you know you need to
[3:31] say this and just drops revelation and
[3:33] stuff and i can hardly i need to learn
[3:36] to keep my phone and type it in or say
[3:38] it or something because i i forget a lot
[3:41] of thoughts that that seem to be so good
[3:43] but i just get flooded and then by the
[3:45] time i get there
[3:46] i have to be saying now lord you gave me
[3:48] all this i only have an hour hour and a
[3:50] half
[3:51] i gotta pick and choose because there's
[3:52] no way to talk about all this and that's
[3:54] the struggle that i have there's so much
[3:56] that i get flooded with in revelation
[3:59] and so
[4:00] i only had two services there so
[4:02] you get the blunt of it because you get
[4:04] all the the stuff that i didn't get to
[4:07] you know
[4:08] because i think it's good things the
[4:10] lord gave us but i do want to touch on
[4:12] some of the things because i entered
[4:13] into last wednesday night talking about
[4:15] what sons do with the authority and i
[4:17] did get into that a little bit down
[4:18] there and tonight i want to get back
[4:20] into it for our home congregation bring
[4:22] out a few points i did down there and
[4:23] also some other things as well
[4:26] like i said last wednesday night though
[4:27] these these two disciples james and john
[4:30] did not manifest the right kind of
[4:32] maturity yet to be able to handle the
[4:34] authority of god would everybody agree
[4:36] james and john did not have any kind of
[4:39] uh
[4:41] bedside manner or so they didn't have
[4:43] the right thing here to be able to use
[4:45] the authority of god they're very
[4:47] immature very childish to be able to say
[4:49] let's be like elijah here they rejected
[4:52] us we don't need people that reject us
[4:54] so let's call help us to call fire down
[4:56] from heaven and just burn up and consume
[4:58] these guys we don't need them this is
[5:00] disciples of jesus christ friends these
[5:03] are guys in the world they've been
[5:04] hanging around the lord for probably
[5:06] about three years now and that's the
[5:08] result you get from somebody hanging
[5:10] around jesus let's call fire down from
[5:12] heaven and burn everybody up we don't
[5:15] need them
[5:16] and yet and yet as i've taught you many
[5:18] times yet they are sons of god
[5:22] sons of god were always sons of god and
[5:25] before the foundation of the world sons
[5:27] of god are predestinated to come to
[5:30] adoption can you say amen
[5:31] and because they are sons god will have
[5:34] to teach them and train them and take
[5:35] them and and if he hands authority to
[5:37] them and he hands this great commission
[5:40] of taking the gospel they're going to
[5:42] have to get a hold of something which is
[5:43] first the holy ghost they're going to
[5:45] have to go into an upper room someday
[5:46] they're going to have to empty out of
[5:48] themselves they're going to have to say
[5:49] i want nothing else but the holy ghost
[5:52] and then the spirit came like a rushing
[5:54] mighty wind and baptized all them the
[5:56] holy spirit and they began the process
[5:59] then of being of growing into
[6:02] men and sons that could handle the full
[6:05] authority of god
[6:07] it takes the holy ghost doesn't it but
[6:09] it takes a vessel that has the holy
[6:11] ghost that's willing to grow and mature
[6:14] because god is not coming for the
[6:16] rapture for immature sons and daughters
[6:19] he's coming for adopted mature sons that
[6:22] know their position know their place
[6:24] they have faith in their position in the
[6:26] word but whatever they do they're going
[6:28] to use right they have the word of god
[6:30] but they also have the mind of christ to
[6:32] use it the right way can i say that
[6:34] again they have the word of god the
[6:36] bride has the word of god but not just
[6:38] the word but she has the mind of christ
[6:40] to know what he wants done with the word
[6:46] that's two things brother ram says the
[6:48] the bride has the word but she has the
[6:50] mind of christ to know what he wants
[6:53] done with the word so it's not just that
[6:56] you have power and authority through the
[6:57] word but it's lord how do we how do we
[6:59] handle it and how do you want us to use
[7:01] it and in what situations the right way
[7:04] so the best the very best can come out
[7:06] of it praise the lord so
[7:09] let me just say about i learned
[7:10] something more about these fellows james
[7:12] and john they were sons and the positive
[7:15] thing is that we can look at their lives
[7:17] at the end of their lives
[7:18] and say praise the lord god changed them
[7:22] they must have grown because if you read
[7:25] their writings it's it's really awesome
[7:28] if you read james and by the way they
[7:30] both got books in the bible so god must
[7:33] have trusted him pretty good later on he
[7:35] didn't trust he said yet you got a bad
[7:37] spirit on you right now when you got to
[7:38] call fire down from heaven you you i you
[7:41] know and like i said before like jonah i
[7:43] would call zip recruiter and get some
[7:45] new recruits
[7:46] finish with you guys i'm going to hire
[7:48] some other recruits you're finished i
[7:51] can't use you if you're calling fire
[7:53] down from heaven burning people up
[7:56] but they were sons god couldn't lose
[7:58] them
[7:59] and and so you know but look at their
[8:02] writings and i'm not going to read them
[8:03] all tonight but read james and read john
[8:06] and i'm going to here's something james
[8:07] wrote now this is the guy now this is
[8:10] the guy that want to call fire down from
[8:11] heaven wonder god we call fire down and
[8:14] just burn up this whole place like
[8:16] elijah did
[8:17] here's what he wrote after he had
[8:18] matured
[8:20] james wrote let every man be swift to
[8:22] hear
[8:24] slow to speak
[8:26] slow to wrath
[8:29] for the wrath of man worketh not the
[8:31] righteousness of god
[8:34] he learned something
[8:35] he matured can you say amen
[8:39] a lot different at the end and i pray
[8:40] it's the same way with me
[8:42] a lot different at the end because i've
[8:43] made some stupid stupid foolish things
[8:46] i've said some foolish things i had a
[8:47] lot of immaturities when i started out
[8:49] in my christian walk still have some
[8:51] that i need to grow out of but even his
[8:53] young pastor had a lot of immaturities
[8:55] didn't have a clue what i was doing 21
[8:57] years old i'll just be on i didn't have
[8:59] a clue what i was doing i knew i was
[9:00] called to do it and god was formulating
[9:02] a group but i didn't have a clue how to
[9:04] handle situations please forgive me on
[9:06] the internet whoever come to my church
[9:08] at that time please forgive me for a
[9:10] young pastor didn't have a clue what he
[9:12] was doing
[9:14] be honestly i still don't have a clue
[9:15] what i'm doing today i really don't i
[9:18] actually i say that you're laughing but
[9:20] you know what
[9:21] the more you grow the more you learn to
[9:23] to depend on the lord
[9:25] because where you get into trouble is
[9:27] when you depend on yourself
[9:28] you get older you realize i can't do
[9:30] this without the lord i can't pastor a
[9:32] church this large without the lord god i
[9:34] need your help and we become more
[9:37] dependent on him to walk in the spirit
[9:39] rather than our own carnal minds and so
[9:41] he said that he said i've got to read it
[9:43] again brothers brothers be slow to speak
[9:46] slow to wrath for the wrath of man
[9:48] worketh not the righteousness of god in
[9:50] john if you read 1st 2nd and 3rd john
[9:53] which is called the epistles
[9:55] of love
[9:58] so the guy that wanted to call fire down
[10:00] from heaven now has books written called
[10:02] the epistles of love and all he could
[10:05] ever say was beloved
[10:07] brothers let us love one another
[10:11] what about this doctrinal question
[10:13] brothers just love one another that was
[10:16] his answer for everything and brother
[10:17] brahm said it he said and you guys might
[10:19] have those quotes so you go i sent them
[10:20] to you as john of old
[10:22] when he got too old
[10:24] as john of old when he got too old to
[10:26] preach he would just set and scream they
[10:29] tell me with all his might little
[10:31] children love one another he couldn't
[10:34] preach anymore but he could scream love
[10:36] one another this is the guy the one that
[10:38] caught fire down from heaven
[10:41] little children love one another love
[10:42] one another don't let nothing come among
[10:45] you
[10:46] [Music]
[10:47] he matured
[10:50] he could handle
[10:51] the word he could handle the power of
[10:54] god he could handle authority because he
[10:56] wasn't burning people up with it he was
[10:58] out to save lives
[11:01] don't let the devil get among you love
[11:03] one another listen this is what it's all
[11:04] about god will do his work god will save
[11:07] people god will change people you're
[11:10] trying to change somebody yourself leave
[11:11] it alone and pray god changes them but
[11:13] if you love one another the holy ghost
[11:16] can work in that congregation and do
[11:18] everything he wants to do if we can just
[11:21] genuinely love god and love one another
[11:24] can i get a witness tonight
[11:27] let god do his work through the holy
[11:28] ghost by us loving one another out of
[11:31] the love of god comes all things and we
[11:34] have the word but we need the love of
[11:36] god here's another thing he said about
[11:37] john he said john once was different
[11:41] john once was different you know he was
[11:43] the one who wanted to call fire down out
[11:45] of heaven and destroy his city because
[11:47] he wouldn't give him something to eat
[11:49] down there i thought that was pretty
[11:51] funny that he wanted to destroy the city
[11:53] because they wouldn't give him something
[11:55] to eat down there now i can understand
[11:57] that anger a little bit they wouldn't
[11:59] give him something to eat
[12:01] it's not justifiable but you know what i
[12:03] need to eat i get
[12:04] okay all right so he wouldn't give him
[12:07] something to eat down there so
[12:08] mistreated him and he wanted to burn the
[12:11] whole thing up and then after jesus got
[12:14] a hold of him
[12:16] he was around jesus but then jesus got a
[12:19] hold of him
[12:21] when jesus how many wants jesus to get a
[12:23] hold of you it's not just that you're at
[12:25] church but you let jesus get a hold of
[12:27] you when jesus got a hold of this man
[12:30] who wanted to call fire down from heaven
[12:32] when jesus got hold of him it changed
[12:34] them to a man of love
[12:36] and that's what god does when he takes
[12:38] some of those
[12:40] hard-hearted fellows like myself
[12:44] and you
[12:47] and he changes us from our selfish and
[12:50] indifferent motives
[12:52] to a love
[12:53] that we just love him
[12:55] and melt our hearts away
[12:59] praise be to god
[13:01] so be it lord in our lives
[13:03] these are the same guys who did it i
[13:04] thought that was pretty unique now
[13:07] we're going to talk tonight a little bit
[13:08] about
[13:09] what god wants us to do with authority
[13:12] and in our text he says the son of man
[13:16] is not out to destroy men's lives
[13:18] but
[13:19] that's that's what men do when they
[13:22] misuse the authority of god
[13:24] it destroys lives
[13:26] whether it's a preacher
[13:28] whether it's a father
[13:30] amen whether it's a husband
[13:33] whether it's an employee an employer
[13:36] whether it's a president
[13:39] anybody that's in authority
[13:42] if they've got the wrong kind and they
[13:43] don't have character with it it destroys
[13:46] lives and that's the evidence we know
[13:47] something's wrong
[13:50] a father he may be providing for his
[13:52] family but if there's destruction in his
[13:54] path and his children are scared of them
[13:57] or there's something going on just
[13:59] trickling down there's something wrong
[14:00] with the man there's something wrong
[14:02] with that man
[14:04] something wrong with his leadership can
[14:05] you say amen because why it's not saving
[14:08] his children it's not building up trust
[14:10] with his children it's actually
[14:12] destroying their spirit it's destroying
[14:14] their confidence it's destroying their
[14:17] love that they don't trust love it's
[14:19] slowly after years destroying it's a
[14:22] destructive thing following that man
[14:27] and we know that that's not what the
[14:29] authority of god in a man was meant to
[14:31] do
[14:32] it's not to destroy families it's not to
[14:35] destroy a church it's to edify a church
[14:38] it's to save people
[14:40] from their problems
[14:42] from their situations they don't have
[14:45] christ to save them by his grace
[14:49] amen
[14:50] so when authority is misused then
[14:53] it destroys and it starts with daddy
[14:56] starts with daddy comes to mommy then
[14:59] and you know there's uh scripture in
[15:02] ephesians that talked about husbands and
[15:03] wife i thought i might mention it
[15:05] because it's related to authority
[15:08] and he breaks down there the the
[15:10] headship of a man over a woman and then
[15:12] he says the woman should be obedient to
[15:13] their own husbands that's scriptural
[15:15] it's not a
[15:16] far-fetched
[15:18] amish idea it's in the bible
[15:20] and as strange as it is to society it is
[15:23] the truth it's what god laid down not
[15:26] that the man would be a dictator of the
[15:28] woman or to step on her
[15:30] but to love her and and to but that he
[15:33] put he put headship over her since the
[15:36] garden of eden
[15:38] as a protection over the woman
[15:41] and that's the way god does it because
[15:42] god's headship over us god
[15:45] god how many know that god's is the
[15:47] authority over us
[15:49] that we submit to
[15:50] but i don't feel
[15:52] uh bound by it i feel protected by it
[15:56] so if he tells me something in the word
[15:58] to do i know he's meant it for my
[16:00] protection
[16:01] that's the way leadership should be
[16:03] but as a talking to the men when they
[16:05] get into this thing of
[16:06] having to reaffirm their headship all
[16:09] the time to their wife
[16:11] and re-establish it and keep going back
[16:12] to the scriptures you know there's a lot
[16:14] of men it's like when they run into
[16:15] trouble in the marriage they think that
[16:17] the problem is she's not under head ship
[16:19] so they keep going back to ephesians 4
[16:22] and establishing his headship
[16:24] again and there's something wrong with a
[16:26] man that has to keep doing that
[16:29] because if you have something you don't
[16:31] have to keep bringing everybody in the
[16:33] family back to the scripture to
[16:34] reestablish it you just have it and they
[16:37] know it
[16:38] is that okay with everybody
[16:41] god doesn't have to come back and
[16:43] reestablish them he is he is the
[16:45] authority in our lives you can either
[16:47] follow it or you can reject it but i
[16:49] find under god's headship and protection
[16:51] and subjecting and obeying god i find
[16:55] great protection
[16:57] so it's all in how we look at but when
[16:58] he got into ephesians when he said men
[17:00] because this whole thing trickles down
[17:02] where he gave the man the headship and
[17:04] protection over her family and over a
[17:06] wife and he said for the wife to submit
[17:08] a woman can in her own uh heart and a
[17:11] oneness and marriage can weigh in on
[17:12] things and give her opinion all that she
[17:14] should be able to do that but at the end
[17:16] of the day where there's a tie in the
[17:17] vote that man's got to make a decision
[17:19] and she's got to submit to it and that's
[17:20] where submission comes in if that
[17:22] decision is on the word and he feels
[17:24] light of god she's got to submit to that
[17:25] decision
[17:28] amen
[17:31] right but she should have the liberty to
[17:33] share because she's not a doormat
[17:35] she's part of you
[17:37] so she weighs in she's a she's a board
[17:39] member you know she's there and she
[17:41] weighs in on decisions but at the end of
[17:43] the day if there's a tie in the vote and
[17:45] they're saying a man's got to make a
[17:46] decision what to do and so she then she
[17:48] submits to that but you see now paul
[17:51] mentioned something about the woman and
[17:53] the man and the man he says
[17:55] to you the head of every man is christ
[17:57] and the head of every of the woman is
[17:59] the man
[18:00] let a man love
[18:02] his wife and guide her with that
[18:04] authority as christ loved the church
[18:07] so he's saying how you exercise your
[18:10] authority
[18:11] how it has to be
[18:12] christ-like so you look at christ how
[18:15] he's the head of the church and you
[18:17] fashion yourself how you lead your home
[18:19] that way it better be after the love of
[18:21] christ and it better have to be the
[18:23] strong leadership of christ it better
[18:24] not be a compromiser can you say amen
[18:27] the love of christ is not a compromiser
[18:29] but yet it has the love to love that
[18:31] family and that woo that family into
[18:33] more of the lord not a dictatorship says
[18:36] i'm the head and i'm reestablishing my
[18:38] headship and i'm going to take you back
[18:40] to the scripture because the problems in
[18:42] this family is the woman won't come
[18:44] under my headship that's the problem in
[18:45] most cases when i counsel that's not the
[18:48] problem but that's what he keeps going
[18:49] to and if she would just come on my
[18:51] subjection then our family would be fine
[18:53] and i tell them not always not always
[18:55] that may be the case sometimes with a
[18:57] woman she might be rebellious to
[18:59] headship but a lot of times it's not
[19:02] that's not the whole picture
[19:05] sometimes the pictures he wants headship
[19:07] but he don't want to be under his ship
[19:09] he wants to be in headship but he don't
[19:11] want to be of the authority of anybody
[19:14] the word
[19:15] a pastor
[19:17] he don't he don't he's unaccountable he
[19:19] does his own thing there's no headship
[19:21] in his life and yet he wants to read the
[19:23] scripture
[19:24] and you feel like saying he keeps
[19:26] defaulting to the scripture about woman
[19:28] being under subjection and you like to
[19:30] say you know there are other scriptures
[19:32] in the bible besides that one in
[19:33] ephesians you know
[19:35] she would get this straight our life
[19:37] would be happy
[19:39] if she would just keep this this one guy
[19:41] told me if she would keep this house
[19:46] spiffy clean when i get home
[19:49] and if he'd keep it as clean
[19:51] as this other sister keeps her
[19:53] housekeeping oh
[19:55] you shouldn't have said that you
[19:56] shouldn't have said that you shouldn't
[19:58] have said
[19:59] if she would just keep this place clean
[20:01] like that other sister
[20:03] we wouldn't have any marriage problems
[20:09] i'm telling you that's what he said
[20:11] that's what he said i'm just i'm
[20:13] laughing on the inside because i'm not
[20:14] allowed to in the office when i'm
[20:16] counseling something
[20:19] i'm going
[20:20] and so i had the bonus to say buddy
[20:24] that is the furthest thing from the
[20:26] truth that if your wife
[20:28] kept the house clean all your problems
[20:30] would be away you need to grow up and
[20:33] realize you're not under headship and
[20:35] your marriage problems are a lot more
[20:37] deeper than your wife not keeping the
[20:39] house clean
[20:41] now she may have need to work on that
[20:42] thing but to make it the ultimate
[20:44] happiness to their
[20:46] marriage sorry not going to go there
[20:49] with you
[20:51] i need to stay on my notes because but
[20:52] anyway i wanted to say
[20:54] the man the man we should do a marriage
[20:57] seminar here we can talk about marriage
[20:59] we should have services on marriage and
[21:02] invite all the young people that are
[21:03] unmarried
[21:07] but you know uh
[21:09] he says love your wives as christ loved
[21:12] the church and then
[21:14] woman you know the the wives obey your
[21:17] own husbands not every man my dad used
[21:19] to say that oh women obey every man it
[21:22] doesn't say this says obey your own
[21:23] husbands
[21:24] and so he talks about obedience for the
[21:27] woman
[21:28] and he's taught christ-like and like the
[21:30] bride type of the bride
[21:32] that it's not us like you're under his
[21:34] thumb and you're a doormat but you
[21:36] willingly say this is my leadership this
[21:38] is my protection and i submit to him
[21:43] and if he's if he makes a
[21:45] wrong decision
[21:47] he's going to get hit by god on it and i
[21:49] release that to him
[21:51] you see that's what a lot of women won't
[21:52] do
[21:54] they they think they know more and so
[21:56] they're you know they're they're gonna
[21:58] i'm gonna have to correct this guy i
[21:59] know someone said man makes a decision
[22:01] no you're not doing that you're not
[22:02] doing that you need to hit an altar
[22:06] you don't tell your husband you're not
[22:07] doing that
[22:08] you don't guide the family the husband
[22:10] guides the family the father leads the
[22:12] family
[22:14] but one of the reasons paul has to say
[22:16] love your wives that christ loved the
[22:18] church and women because
[22:20] man's
[22:21] sinful tendency is to become
[22:25] harsh
[22:26] and a dictator with his authority
[22:31] okay
[22:32] that's why paul had to say it love her
[22:34] as christ loved the church let this
[22:36] authority be used the way christ would
[22:39] use it
[22:40] and the reason he has to say the woman
[22:42] about subjection because women's sinful
[22:45] tendency is to step out of her place and
[22:48] become dominating
[22:50] and a lot of times women will do it
[22:51] because the man won't take the
[22:52] leadership so they step in and they just
[22:54] take it we're not really supposed to do
[22:56] that
[22:57] but
[22:57] women's sinful tendency is to
[23:01] step out of her place and become the man
[23:03] and become the leader and tell their
[23:05] husbands what to do and so the reason
[23:07] paul has to address this because it's
[23:09] our sinful tendency to do that on the
[23:11] man and woman's side and he wanted us to
[23:14] keep it in line with the holy ghost and
[23:15] the holy spirit
[23:17] the way it's supposed to be
[23:19] if you're a studyer of the word and you
[23:20] study the church ages you'll find
[23:22] there's two spirits that god rebuked the
[23:25] nicolaitan spirit
[23:28] and jezebel spirit
[23:31] and there you have
[23:32] man getting off with his leadership to
[23:34] the wrong kind of authority to a
[23:35] denomination
[23:37] and the church becoming a jezebel and
[23:39] you know who jezebel is in the bible
[23:42] so it even happened spiritually in the
[23:45] church
[23:46] is that the church got off where it
[23:47] become nicolet and you conquer the laity
[23:50] all the holiness is in the pulpit
[23:51] there's no holy ghost in the people you
[23:53] don't need your bibles anymore they took
[23:54] their bibles away we'll interpret the
[23:56] bible for you that that dictatorship you
[23:58] just do what i say and i'll read the
[24:00] bible for you that's the nicolaitan
[24:02] spirit and then the dominating jezebel
[24:04] spirit says the church says i don't need
[24:06] the husband christ anymore i'll have
[24:08] lots of lovers and i'll open myself to
[24:10] any kind of seed in any kind of spirit
[24:12] and i will say what we're going to do
[24:18] so this authority thing
[24:20] is so important that we look at it
[24:22] because in our own lives we can get off
[24:25] track
[24:26] and misuse the authority that god has
[24:28] given us how many can say amen
[24:31] we can misuse the authority that god
[24:33] gives us and sons have been given all
[24:35] the authority today
[24:37] i believe they've been given the
[24:38] authority of god and so he says don't
[24:41] use your power to destroy
[24:44] use it to save lives so he said we find
[24:47] in this the key
[24:48] god's authority is not to destroy men's
[24:51] lives but to save lives to restore
[24:54] to to to redeem how many know that god's
[24:58] love and power is to redeem something
[25:01] not throw something away
[25:03] it's to restore something can you say
[25:05] amen that's god's power that's what it's
[25:07] used for use your authority for the
[25:09] right thing and that's to restore
[25:11] respect to restore the right kind of
[25:13] thing
[25:14] to redeem can you say amen don't use
[25:16] your power to destroy jesus says you
[25:18] guys don't even know what spirit you're
[25:20] of don't use your power to destroy but
[25:24] the son of man has come to save lives
[25:26] use whatever god gives you to save lives
[25:32] that's the key can you say amen that's
[25:34] the key don't use it to force something
[25:36] on somebody don't use your authority to
[25:38] force something on another person except
[25:40] the devil we do force the devil but
[25:42] don't use your authority to force
[25:44] something use what you have to draw
[25:46] others into life can you say amen
[25:49] and i said to the brothers jesus came in
[25:51] the ministry of the three poles
[25:53] not the three pushes
[25:59] it wasn't the first and second and third
[26:01] push
[26:02] but it's the pull
[26:04] and that means it draws you
[26:07] all the father have given me will come
[26:09] if you draw an eye to me i'll draw an
[26:11] eye to you there's a it's a
[26:13] children
[26:14] are drawn
[26:16] to the right kind of leadership in a
[26:18] husband
[26:20] but they are naturally repelled
[26:23] to the wrong type of leadership
[26:25] is that okay
[26:28] a good godly girl will repel someone
[26:31] who's not the right kind of leader
[26:33] she'll back off from it but if she sees
[26:35] real holy ghost leadership at a young
[26:37] man she should be attracted to that
[26:42] saving lives is everybody on board
[26:44] tonight
[26:45] it's to save lives not to destroy them
[26:48] it's saving other people's lives and i
[26:50] want to get into this night tonight
[26:52] saving your own
[26:55] think about it say brother paul but but
[26:57] god saves doesn't he god saves not us
[27:00] yes but who does god use to save people
[27:05] acts 1 and verse 8 says ye shall receive
[27:08] power after which the holy ghost has
[27:10] come upon you and ye shall be witnesses
[27:13] and when you're a witness you're
[27:14] affecting other people's lives he gave
[27:16] you the holy ghost in order to affect
[27:18] others to save others can you say amen
[27:22] that's why he gave you that's why he
[27:23] brought you into the body of christ it
[27:25] wasn't just to occupy and appeal
[27:27] somewhere but you have power you have
[27:29] authority you have his love you have all
[27:31] this resident within you but it's not
[27:33] it's not to use in the wrong way it's
[27:35] meant to save other people's lives when
[27:38] the holy ghost has come upon you then ye
[27:40] shall be witnesses unto me in judea and
[27:42] everywhere in other words it's to affect
[27:44] other people's lives for salvation
[27:47] amen so so it's yes i receive that power
[27:50] and god is showing what his power will
[27:52] do if you want to know the scripture
[27:54] what his part will do you see because
[27:55] you say well i thought they got the
[27:57] power of the holy ghost to heal the sick
[27:59] and to do miracles in pentecost when
[28:02] they were filled with the holy ghost no
[28:03] he gave them that power the disciples
[28:06] before the holy ghost came
[28:09] you remember when he sent the 70 out and
[28:11] he said you'll have power to be able to
[28:13] lay your hands on the sick be able to
[28:15] pray for them they have that power so
[28:17] the power of the holy ghost is something
[28:20] different it's something deeper it's the
[28:22] conversion that changes your life but
[28:24] it's not so much for miracles as it is
[28:26] you shall be a witness
[28:28] you shall be a testimony you shall live
[28:30] the life they'll see the holy ghost on
[28:32] display they'll see god living and
[28:34] that's why they said when they got
[28:36] around the disciples after the holy
[28:37] ghost they took note they were had been
[28:40] with jesus
[28:42] they've been with jesus because they
[28:44] could see something in their lives
[28:46] they've seen the miracles they see him
[28:48] walk in the shadow of peter and somebody
[28:50] was healed that's all there can you say
[28:52] man but what was it to be witnesses
[28:54] power to be a witness power to live an
[28:57] overcoming life
[29:00] blessed be his name so there and you'll
[29:02] find there's no one who received the
[29:04] holy ghost even in acts except through a
[29:07] member of the body of christ
[29:10] nobody received the holy ghost in the
[29:12] book of acts except there was another
[29:14] member of the body christ there to speak
[29:16] it to them and preach the gospel
[29:20] and some of you are going i'm going to
[29:22] have to go home and study that and make
[29:23] sure he's saying the truth nobody
[29:24] received it unless somebody was there
[29:26] preaching
[29:28] so the pat
[29:29] does god save lives god saves lives but
[29:32] he uses you to do it
[29:35] that's how much authority we have
[29:37] so it's not that we save them but we
[29:39] have the authority even brother brahm
[29:41] said he says no preacher saves or heals
[29:44] but he said the preacher he says he he
[29:46] preaches and he cast out he has
[29:49] authority he cast out the unbelieving
[29:51] devil
[29:52] so that you can be saved
[29:54] so that you can be healed
[29:56] he said we were always saved before the
[29:58] foundation of the world in god's mind we
[30:00] were always saved
[30:02] so when you come and when you come to
[30:03] the altar your salvation that's when you
[30:05] recognize it but you were always saved
[30:07] what makes you what makes you come to
[30:09] the altar what makes you receive what
[30:11] brings the conviction well that preacher
[30:13] probably labored in the word of god or
[30:15] that person at your work had been
[30:17] praying
[30:18] it doesn't have to be a preacher but
[30:19] that person at work had been praying to
[30:21] lead you to the lord and praying to say
[30:23] the right word and all of a sudden what
[30:25] he says what he says has the sword and
[30:27] the authority to drive away the
[30:29] unbelieving devil and all of a sudden
[30:31] when the unbelieving devil's gone i can
[30:33] be saved
[30:35] i can be healed can you say amen you can
[30:37] be healed tonight if you drive away all
[30:39] the unbelieving devils
[30:42] that's what us preachers do we don't
[30:43] save people we don't heal people we just
[30:45] preach the devils away and i have
[30:47] authority tonight to do it when i was
[30:50] talking about husbands and wife you know
[30:51] i was doing i was driving demons away
[30:54] i know what i'm doing up here and i
[30:56] don't do it by my own authority i do it
[30:58] by the authority of god
[31:00] preaching drives away demon spirits so
[31:03] you can get victory
[31:06] glory be to god
[31:09] so here's another quote here an attitude
[31:11] and who is god he says i'm afraid that
[31:13] the church
[31:14] i'm afraid that the church doesn't know
[31:16] their authority
[31:18] amen
[31:24] i'm afraid that the church doesn't know
[31:25] their authority i'm afraid that the holy
[31:27] ghost born men doesn't realize their
[31:29] authority where the chur the authority
[31:31] that god has permitted to his church
[31:33] i'll give unto thee the keys to the
[31:35] kingdom whatever you bind on earth will
[31:37] be bound in heaven whatever you lose
[31:39] will be loose is not that the commission
[31:40] to peter and to all the church that when
[31:43] you have the holy ghost you have power
[31:45] and authority
[31:46] to bind up
[31:48] to loose can you say man that's why when
[31:50] they said to peter what do we need to do
[31:52] to be saved peter had the right words he
[31:54] didn't just say be saved he preached the
[31:56] gospel and he gave him the path repent
[31:59] and be baptized
[32:00] and you shall receive the gift of the
[32:01] holy ghost he just unloosed the kingdom
[32:04] of god to them they were asking but
[32:06] peter peter had the right words and he
[32:09] loosed the kingdom of god to them bow
[32:11] the devil and loose the kingdom to them
[32:13] so it came through because why peter had
[32:15] authority i'm here to tell you tonight
[32:17] if you're a holy ghost believer you have
[32:20] authority what i'm preaching on is that
[32:22] we use it the right way
[32:25] because
[32:27] for so many years in the message
[32:28] authority in some situations has been
[32:31] abused
[32:32] and used wrong
[32:35] by fathers by preachers
[32:38] i could give you ten examples right now
[32:40] of how preachers have misused the
[32:42] authority of a pastor
[32:46] and they like that husband has to go
[32:47] back to that scripture to reestablish
[32:49] they're getting up to their congregation
[32:50] and said
[32:51] can anybody come and show me where i'm
[32:53] wrong in the word and they challenge the
[32:54] congregation and read the quotes about
[32:56] authority and sometimes that's in place
[32:58] but if you're doing it to try to hold on
[33:00] to your authority to people
[33:02] you've already lost it
[33:05] so many years that i can give direct
[33:06] examples without giving names
[33:08] but even in our own ranks pastors and
[33:11] ministers can abuse
[33:13] their authority
[33:15] what i'm preaching this for to men but
[33:17] also our congregation is that if we have
[33:19] it we really need to find how god wants
[33:23] to use it because it'll be powerful
[33:26] powerful
[33:27] against the enemy
[33:30] glory be to god
[33:32] remember i said how ben franklin
[33:33] discovered electricity but he didn't
[33:35] know what he had brother bram says he
[33:36] said i've got something we've got it we
[33:38] got it but he didn't know what he had he
[33:40] found the power of it but then brother
[33:42] brahman said that thomas edison
[33:44] harnessed the power of it and figured
[33:45] out how to get it so we can have lights
[33:47] tonight so it's two phases it's one
[33:50] having the power
[33:51] but it's also knowing how to harness it
[33:55] having the power of the holy ghost
[33:57] but knowing how to harness it in the
[33:58] right humble life that it can be used
[34:00] correctly and thank god we can use the
[34:02] lights tonight thank god somebody
[34:04] harnessed the power of electricity it's
[34:06] an unseen force it would have just been
[34:08] out there and somebody said we got it we
[34:10] got it we got it but brother brahms says
[34:12] is that benjamin franklin he didn't know
[34:14] what he had
[34:16] the church we've got it we've got it
[34:18] i've got the holy ghost but you really
[34:20] don't know what you have and you don't
[34:21] know what to use it for
[34:23] and that's when god calls upon a humble
[34:26] submissive life to say god let me bring
[34:28] this thing under subjection to you and
[34:31] channel this authority and power in love
[34:34] to be able to use it for your kingdom
[34:37] to save lives
[34:40] starting with my own children
[34:42] can i get an amen
[34:44] you want to go on the mission field
[34:45] start with your own family
[34:48] amen to save lives
[34:52] so you have to have this under control
[34:55] supreme power the anointing of supreme
[34:57] court power and control brother bram
[34:58] says pentecost thought the anointing was
[35:00] somebody who's dancing around the room
[35:03] he said that's not the anointing that's
[35:04] the blessings of god
[35:07] and there ain't nothing wrong with it
[35:08] you feel the blessing stimulation of
[35:09] revelations you make shout all over this
[35:11] room i've shouted i've danced that's the
[35:13] blessings god it's not the anointing
[35:16] right
[35:18] and we love that we believe in it if you
[35:19] feel the blessings of god you do
[35:21] probably some of you need to do it more
[35:23] some of you are too starchy
[35:25] might as well just say it
[35:27] you ought to come wednesday night to
[35:28] have church
[35:31] amen
[35:32] get under the blessings we'll shout but
[35:34] he says you pentecostals that's not the
[35:36] anointing he said the anointing is
[35:38] supreme power in control
[35:42] what a powerful statement the anointing
[35:45] is supreme power in control
[35:48] it's harnessed
[35:49] it's brought into the channel what god
[35:51] wants to use it for it's ever powerful
[35:54] but it's what does god want me to use it
[35:56] for amen you brothers that heard this
[36:00] already on saturday night brother john
[36:03] brother kyle
[36:04] i appreciate you should say amen just as
[36:06] loud just as if you never heard it
[36:07] before
[36:09] just pretend you haven't heard it all
[36:11] right
[36:13] so i got i got 15 minutes here i got to
[36:15] wrap up so now we're submissive to him
[36:18] to use these things and bring these
[36:20] things under control
[36:21] by the authority that's within us now
[36:24] i've said in the past few months ago i
[36:25] was preaching on our participation in
[36:27] creation
[36:28] creation is calling for something that's
[36:30] not there and we participate in this
[36:32] creation of god with the holy ghost
[36:35] by saving lives we participate
[36:38] creating is how many know that the bride
[36:40] with the authority and power of god have
[36:42] creative power
[36:44] maybe you don't know that tonight
[36:47] adam had creative power before the fall
[36:50] calvary is restoring us back to what
[36:52] adam lost the title deed to the earth
[36:55] was in adam's hand he lost it through
[36:57] the fall but now it's been given back to
[36:59] his people which means we're coming back
[37:01] to a place of authority again
[37:04] all right so which we're coming back to
[37:06] a place of creating like adam did at the
[37:08] beginning
[37:09] so already with the holy ghost of
[37:10] brother rhymes tell us we have created
[37:12] power to change things so it's if
[37:14] creation is calling for something that's
[37:15] not there if there's no love
[37:18] we can bring it on the scene
[37:26] if no one will do it for us
[37:29] sons of god will make it happen by faith
[37:34] religious people wait for god to do
[37:36] something or they wait for someone else
[37:37] to do something for them
[37:39] but sons of god say i have the power
[37:42] within me now i'll pray right now
[37:44] i don't need to wait till sunday to have
[37:46] brother paul pray for me i'll use the
[37:48] authority and pray in his name right now
[37:51] my wife's sick i'll pray right now my
[37:52] kid has got a fever i'll pray right now
[37:56] call me call brother brandon call the
[37:58] brothers ask for support in prayer put
[38:00] it on the sister's chat keep it a
[38:01] positive thing pray for us and that's
[38:03] wonderful but listen you don't need to
[38:05] wait to pray if you have his name and
[38:07] have authority you pray
[38:09] [Applause]
[38:11] you pray
[38:14] religious people wait for god to do it
[38:15] themselves excuse me they wait for god
[38:17] to do it for them or someone else but
[38:19] see the sons call jesus on the scene
[38:21] they're the ones calling jesus on the
[38:22] scene
[38:24] amen if there's no peace we call for it
[38:27] if there's no happiness we ask for it we
[38:29] create it
[38:31] think about it some wait for god to
[38:33] deliver them from habits
[38:35] and you're waiting for some feeling to
[38:36] sweep over you at a convention or a camp
[38:38] meeting you're waiting for the feeling
[38:40] sunday to sweep over you to deliver you
[38:43] from this habit
[38:44] and sometimes that feeling only lasts
[38:46] till monday
[38:47] you don't need a feeling you need
[38:48] deliverance
[38:50] and i say use the authority of god that
[38:52] you have to cast out that devil
[38:56] amen
[38:58] if you if you say to this mountain can
[39:00] you say amen how many years did abraham
[39:03] declare
[39:04] things that were not as though they were
[39:06] right
[39:08] 25 years
[39:09] declaring things that were not as though
[39:11] they were
[39:13] amen
[39:15] so i'm going to skip a bunch of this
[39:16] because we have to move on
[39:18] all the authority given to his sons adam
[39:21] he had the title deed to the earth so
[39:22] i'm bringing you back to adam's day now
[39:24] and i'm just going to read a quote and
[39:25] we'll close here in about 10 minutes
[39:29] we know that all the authority there for
[39:31] for the earth because adam was under
[39:32] authority now he's given him an evil
[39:35] given all authority on earth and he's
[39:37] exercising that authority he has the
[39:39] title deed to the entire earth he has
[39:41] ownership the reason why god created
[39:44] planet earth i don't know about the
[39:45] other planets and what his purpose is
[39:47] but this planet earth was created for
[39:50] sons of god to rule and reign
[39:53] and then he placed adam and eve you're
[39:55] the ruler you're the reigner you name
[39:56] the animals
[39:58] the lord what's that little thing
[39:59] crawling over there what's that thing
[40:01] running around going up the tree that
[40:03] god says well
[40:05] name it give it a name it doesn't have a
[40:06] name yet
[40:08] i call it a squirrel so all this is
[40:10] being handed to adam because the earth
[40:11] is created for him
[40:13] this is how adam was functioning so now
[40:15] i'm going to drop into a quote here he's
[40:17] exercising all authority and brother
[40:19] brown says this in fundamental
[40:20] foundation for faith he says a lot of
[40:22] good things in that message if you want
[40:23] to read it i'm pulling out just one area
[40:26] what did god put man here for
[40:29] you ever think of it what did he put you
[40:30] here for
[40:32] just to do a job
[40:34] just to exist
[40:36] just to
[40:37] work and retire and get a camper get a
[40:40] truck
[40:43] a is what
[40:45] uh eleanor my granddaughter calls it
[40:48] papa's cuck
[40:51] you know brother bran says what are we
[40:52] really here for what's he baptized us
[40:54] with the holy ghost for
[40:56] it's not for all this earthly things
[40:58] it's not just to build a a
[41:01] nest egg
[41:03] so he goes into this he says now god
[41:05] when he made a man in the beginning he
[41:06] made him superior to anything on the
[41:08] earth he gave him jurisdiction of
[41:10] everything on the earth to control
[41:12] everything he controlled the animal life
[41:15] he controlled the foul life the fishes
[41:17] of the sea he controlled the winds he
[41:19] controlled the plant life he controlled
[41:22] everything did you get the picture here
[41:26] before the fall a son of god was in
[41:28] control of things
[41:30] things didn't control him
[41:34] we've lived for six thousand years
[41:36] culminating in satan's eden not god's
[41:38] eden and it is a it is a world with
[41:41] artificial intelligence and all these uh
[41:45] all this
[41:47] oh i don't even know what all to call it
[41:49] but all this technology we got you know
[41:51] what human beings are like robots
[41:54] we're controlled
[41:56] they're dictating what kind of truck we
[41:58] buy they're dictating what we have in
[42:00] our home they dictating we that we go in
[42:03] debt for something because we might not
[42:05] have the money but they say we'll give
[42:07] it to you and so we're we're being
[42:09] controlled and so so you get the place
[42:11] that your your finances are controlling
[42:13] you
[42:14] instead of you controlling your finances
[42:16] can i get an amen from somebody here
[42:17] tonight
[42:18] we're not supposed to live as sons and
[42:20] daughters of god where everything's
[42:21] controlling us we're to stand with the
[42:23] humility and power of god and we're to
[42:26] be in control of our finances we're to
[42:28] be control of our families word exercise
[42:31] and he had it over the winds he had it
[42:33] over everything he controlled the plant
[42:35] life he controlled everything
[42:38] that's what we fell from that's what
[42:40] we're going back to that's what i've
[42:42] seen in my life since i've been 16 years
[42:44] old i've had my battles i have my
[42:46] weaknesses i'm still not perfect but i
[42:48] have watched the power of the holy ghost
[42:50] allow me to control things in life when
[42:53] the devil was coming in that i by the
[42:55] holy ghost control things things don't
[42:59] control me
[43:01] amen let's give them a hand that's right
[43:04] right now
[43:05] we are sons of god we have been redeemed
[43:08] by his blood and this power is already
[43:11] working in sons and daughters of god
[43:13] nothing should control you
[43:18] not a mother-in-law
[43:21] not an uncle not your children dictating
[43:24] what you do there's a lot of families
[43:26] the children are running home
[43:29] oh boy this is we need to talk about
[43:31] this sometimes
[43:32] they're being controlled by everything
[43:34] and then all the the young people
[43:36] everything a moon movie star comes out
[43:38] whatever they wear however they wear
[43:39] their hair whatever they do and you know
[43:41] what you're being controlled you're a
[43:43] robot
[43:45] and i come to the place they don't
[43:46] control what i wear when i the word
[43:48] controls what i do
[43:50] i'll tell the devil what i'm going to
[43:52] wear i'll tell
[43:53] a sister should say the fashion industry
[43:56] doesn't dictate what i wear i dictate as
[43:59] a daughter of god what he wants me to
[44:01] wear
[44:02] [Applause]
[44:04] ain't that he controlled everything he
[44:06] controlled everything isn't that
[44:07] wonderful and and paul had a little
[44:09] statement there and he's talking about
[44:11] eating beating stuff in romans and he
[44:13] says
[44:14] one little statement he says
[44:16] i have the liberty to do this
[44:18] but i will not be brought under the
[44:21] power of anything
[44:25] powerful statement
[44:27] i will not be brought under the power of
[44:29] anything
[44:31] i'm under subjection to god but the
[44:33] devil's kingdom it doesn't control me
[44:37] satan does not did you know they said
[44:39] this a brother said this to the mending
[44:41] satan doesn't control when sons of god
[44:43] he doesn't control anything
[44:46] he's not in charge of anything
[44:48] amen he doesn't run your life unless you
[44:51] let him
[44:54] this brother said the only thing the
[44:55] devil runs is his mouth
[45:00] and that is scriptural when it says the
[45:02] accuser of the brethren he doesn't he's
[45:05] not in charge of anything he's not in
[45:07] control unless you let him he's not
[45:09] running any company he's not running
[45:10] anything he doesn't he's not allowed to
[45:12] do that but he certainly runs his mouth
[45:15] it's the only thing the devil's running
[45:16] is his mouth accusing the brethren amen
[45:20] i will not be under brought under the
[45:22] power of is anybody getting anything out
[45:25] of this tonight are you glad they came
[45:27] to church wednesday night tonight are
[45:29] you glad you're listening in
[45:33] amen
[45:35] let me say what i remember to lydia man
[45:38] what a powerful saxophone special you
[45:40] had on sunday lydia
[45:42] praise god
[45:46] good job
[45:47] the devil didn't like that man keep
[45:49] doing that i prayed for a full orchestra
[45:52] someday here
[45:53] and lydia you're the start
[45:56] it's coming someday
[45:58] okay so now here i have five minutes six
[46:01] minutes left
[46:02] according to my promise
[46:05] where where am i at okay so i read okay
[46:08] so he has everything i want to go after
[46:10] he says he controlled the animal life
[46:12] okay and adam could speak to the winds
[46:15] and it would stop he could speak to the
[46:17] trees and they would obey him he could
[46:18] speak to the wildlife it would obey him
[46:21] he could speak now this isn't a story
[46:23] this is your brother adam
[46:26] he's the son of god like you are
[46:28] he could speak to the wild he could
[46:30] speak to the waters ever what it was
[46:31] everything obedient man was made as a
[46:34] secondary god on the earth he was given
[46:36] the power to control all things
[46:39] all the elements of the earth that was
[46:41] adam everybody got it look at this
[46:44] adam was given these great powers
[46:47] but then the power that he was given to
[46:50] make himself
[46:52] itself
[46:54] is where he fell
[47:00] and that's the same look that i had when
[47:02] i read that quote
[47:04] that's interesting
[47:06] i've been pondering it for a couple
[47:07] weeks
[47:08] preached it at the brothers meeting
[47:11] he's exercising all this authority over
[47:13] everything
[47:14] and where the devil got him
[47:17] was something personal
[47:20] his promise
[47:22] because he had all this animal life and
[47:23] that was all created by god and he was
[47:25] in control of it
[47:26] a lot of times that's us you know we're
[47:27] controlling this we're controlling our
[47:29] business or controlling it how our house
[47:31] looks and all these other things but
[47:32] then the devil got him when he gets
[47:34] personal to him because he had a
[47:36] personal promise that he and they would
[47:38] multiply and replenish the earth which
[47:40] is god's desire god's desire was to
[47:43] multiply himself and he gave that to his
[47:45] son to multiply himself in other words
[47:48] to pass on to in other words something
[47:49] would come out of you
[47:51] that would
[47:53] more sons and daughters of god
[47:55] that's right and brother brahm says i
[47:57] want you to leave that up if you can
[47:58] brother brahm says but the power
[48:01] that he
[48:02] the power that was given to make himself
[48:04] is where he fell so
[48:06] here we see that all the powers he was
[48:09] given
[48:10] the power
[48:12] that controlled himself from where the
[48:14] devil could get into himself where we
[48:16] weren't supposed to leave that alone
[48:18] we're using the authority for everything
[48:19] else we're supposed to use it when the
[48:21] devil hits us personally as well
[48:24] and that's where man falls is that they
[48:26] can exercise the authority in anything
[48:28] else but then the devil slips into
[48:30] something that's personal
[48:38] this is what adam fell from
[48:41] but how did it happen well first of all
[48:43] adam's wife
[48:44] came out from under her husband's
[48:46] headship or she was like she got she got
[48:48] alone with the serpent serpent starts to
[48:50] speak with her
[48:52] misquote the word of god
[48:54] pull it hurt away right so she got out
[48:56] from headship
[48:58] adam got out from other headship with
[49:00] her okay
[49:01] once you come out of the authority and
[49:03] headship of god you start to lose your
[49:05] authority
[49:07] because all authority of god you can't
[49:10] have it or exercise it right unless you
[49:12] my brother and sister are under god's
[49:15] authority of his word
[49:17] and he gave them the word and they were
[49:19] supposed to stay under that authority of
[49:21] the word and now the devil attacks them
[49:23] in that area personally the devil
[49:24] attacks his wife the devil came to his
[49:27] wife first it's interesting he's he's in
[49:29] the first creation of god he's a direct
[49:31] son of god
[49:33] she she is she is created with him in
[49:35] that way but then when he split him up
[49:37] then we know that she was a byproduct
[49:39] brother rem said so she had the ability
[49:41] to have the weakness to fall so we know
[49:43] that's the plan of god but i want you to
[49:44] look at in this sense is that where's
[49:46] adam's authority when the serpent's
[49:48] moving in on his wife
[49:51] he's using it on the trees he's speaking
[49:53] to the squirrels he's moving mountains
[49:55] and the devil sneaks in on his own wife
[49:58] his own family
[50:01] where's his authority then
[50:04] sneaks in they come out from underneath
[50:06] his headship
[50:07] where he fell was not to use his
[50:09] authority
[50:10] when where he fell
[50:12] was not to use his authority when satan
[50:16] came with personal attacks
[50:19] private attacks
[50:22] satan began to mess with adam's
[50:24] potentials
[50:27] i know it's quiet but it's okay i want
[50:29] you to think deeply about this before we
[50:31] close
[50:34] satan can let sons of god do all kinds
[50:36] of things but you watch where he attacks
[50:38] you
[50:40] it's then to defeat you in your
[50:42] potentials
[50:44] your promise
[50:47] and he's he's going to start messing
[50:49] with his potentials and what he will be
[50:51] someday how many knows the devil can
[50:53] stunt growth
[50:55] you're supposed to go grow into a full
[50:56] mature son of god i guarantee you the
[50:58] devil's against that he's going to keep
[51:00] you immature he's going to keep you
[51:01] defeated he's going to keep telling you
[51:03] that you're not even a son of god he's
[51:05] going to keep messing with your promise
[51:07] and your potentials he's going to keep
[51:09] defeating you in that area
[51:12] that's where we have to watch and he
[51:13] should have
[51:14] adam should have used his authority to
[51:17] address him he is controlling everything
[51:19] else why didn't he use his authority to
[51:22] control this serpent
[51:30] to say to his wife
[51:32] look at here sweetie
[51:34] listen i know what he said to you but
[51:36] we're sticking with the word
[51:39] he's using authority to do that
[51:41] and said he didn't we're sticking with
[51:43] the word sweetie you know not satan's
[51:45] interpretation he's in he's
[51:46] misinterpreted this to you
[51:48] so we need to be careful the voices were
[51:50] listened to that's the hiss of the
[51:51] serpent brother brahma says you start to
[51:53] listen to other voices beside the word
[51:55] of god that's the hiss of the serpent
[51:57] amen he referred to the hiss of the
[51:59] serpent and listening to other
[52:00] interpretations of the bible and
[52:02] denominational interpretations of the
[52:04] bible that's that's your enemy
[52:06] but he should have stood up should have
[52:08] stood in the authority of god he was
[52:10] controlling everything else he should
[52:13] have controlled him and say honey we're
[52:14] going to stick with the word we're not
[52:16] taking satan's interpretation we're not
[52:18] doing things this way satan get out of
[52:20] here in the name
[52:22] we would have said in the name of jesus
[52:23] christ serpent get out of here
[52:26] leave this place
[52:28] he didn't do it
[52:29] he gave in from using his authority for
[52:32] the right thing
[52:33] the personal attack on his wife personal
[52:35] attack on his his future personal attack
[52:38] on him
[52:40] he said you'll be as gods and adam
[52:42] should have used the authority of the
[52:43] word to say now wait a minute
[52:45] the serpent is saying
[52:49] the serpent told you it will be his gods
[52:52] if you believe me
[52:54] adam should have been saying but i'm
[52:55] already a god
[52:58] i'm a minor god on earth god made me
[53:00] that why do i need to take satan's path
[53:02] to be a god i'm already a god
[53:04] notice how subtle the devil is to take
[53:06] the very word of god the very promise of
[53:08] god he's already in that position
[53:11] and he's luring him into another path
[53:14] and another position to eat off the tree
[53:16] of knowledge of good and evil instead of
[53:18] the tree of life
[53:19] i'll tell you friends this serpent is
[53:21] still alive today this devil is still
[53:23] your enemy today it wants to sway your
[53:25] children it wants to speak to you it
[53:27] wants to whisper to you it wants to sway
[53:30] your wife it wants to sway your kids it
[53:32] wants to come to your door and i believe
[53:34] sons of god should stand up with their
[53:36] authority against the serpent's voice
[53:39] can i get an amen
[53:41] this serpent is still hissing and still
[53:44] speaking today
[53:46] in every day in a family's life he's out
[53:48] to attack the wife the family to the the
[53:51] children your personal promise he's out
[53:54] to defeat you you ought to stand on two
[53:56] feet by the word of god and use your
[53:58] authority for that i'm preaching you
[53:59] what to use the authority for you ought
[54:01] to use it for that
[54:02] [Music]
[54:03] you ought to use it when the devil's
[54:05] subtly coming in between the oneness and
[54:07] your
[54:08] marriage he's breaking all the oneness
[54:11] the attack is related to his home his
[54:13] wife
[54:14] it's not the animals not the squirrels
[54:16] it's not the trees it's not the
[54:17] mountains it's related to his wife it's
[54:19] related to affecting his future his
[54:21] personal future
[54:23] the program of god is to reproduce
[54:25] himself satan is stepping in to temple
[54:27] with all of this and adam with all this
[54:30] authority doesn't use it for the right
[54:32] thing satan was being intentional this
[54:35] way brother sam said it at camp satan is
[54:38] intentional today with our children our
[54:40] families and our spiritual walk he's
[54:42] intentional he's subtle but he's
[54:44] intentional
[54:46] he's subtle but he's intentional and if
[54:48] satan is intentional sons of god need to
[54:51] be intentional can i get an amen
[54:54] if satan is intentional sons of god and
[54:57] daughters of god need to be intentional
[55:00] to cast him out
[55:02] i say praise the
[55:04] lord amen and i'll just say this go into
[55:08] it in another service another time
[55:12] it's not just related to his his wife
[55:16] his future his potentials his
[55:18] promise it it just broke away all the
[55:22] oneness between them their oneness with
[55:23] god was broke why didn't he stand in
[55:26] authority against i tell you if satan is
[55:28] trying to attack your oneness with god
[55:30] and your marriage you that's when you
[55:32] use your authority
[55:34] satan
[55:35] in the name of jesus
[55:37] do you know what else is related to it
[55:40] and i'm saying this a little bit more
[55:43] tactfully here than i would in the men's
[55:45] meeting
[55:47] there was a
[55:49] there was an adulterous sexual
[55:50] relationship between the serpent
[55:52] and eve
[55:56] i know some of you listen in from
[55:57] different churches
[55:59] maybe you come from a denomination you
[56:00] think i'm wackle you study your bible
[56:02] and see what came from the garden
[56:04] two seeds
[56:06] there was an experience
[56:08] but i'm telling you tonight
[56:10] satan's attack was not just personal but
[56:12] it was related
[56:14] to
[56:16] adulterous
[56:18] sex
[56:20] and we live in the same day
[56:22] he tries to cause you to fall
[56:28] and it seems to be many times related to
[56:30] private
[56:31] sexual sins
[56:35] eve's innocent she doesn't know anything
[56:37] about this
[56:39] it's satan who introduced it to her
[56:43] how many kids do i got coming up to me
[56:44] today saying i was introduced to this at
[56:47] eight years old i was introduced to this
[56:49] at five years old
[56:51] it's the same serpent as in the garden
[56:53] stuff they never should have seen but in
[56:55] this age they see it way too early
[56:57] should never see it
[56:59] because satan is intentional
[57:02] is the grace of god bigger oh yes is the
[57:05] blood of jesus christ bigger is he able
[57:07] to wash away all guilt and every stain
[57:09] amen amen and amen if we didn't have the
[57:12] blood of jesus christ we'd be finished
[57:14] we'd be like sodom and gomorrah
[57:17] except there was a remnant we'd be like
[57:19] sodom and gomorrah but we have the blood
[57:22] of jesus christ we have the token for
[57:24] our children we have the authority for
[57:27] our homes our families to nip it in the
[57:30] bud
[57:32] amen
[57:34] what do you do with the devil you use
[57:35] the authority to nip it in the bud as
[57:37] soon as it starts to come in
[57:39] and if you're struggling with the guilt
[57:40] of that tonight no matter who you are no
[57:42] matter how young age it was
[57:44] plead the blood of jesus christ and come
[57:46] to him and let him wash away let his
[57:48] blood just wash away every memory every
[57:51] stain let him wash it away walked away i
[57:54] wouldn't preach you see that so much and
[57:56] then you go speed ahead to the noah's
[57:58] day and the sons of god saw the
[58:00] daughters of men that they were pretty
[58:01] and that's where their fell fall began
[58:04] speed ahead another two thousand years
[58:06] speed ahead six thousand years here we
[58:08] are in the days of sodom and gomorrah
[58:09] again and sexual sin is everywhere
[58:11] adulterous sin our kids are taught about
[58:14] adulterous fornication
[58:16] relationships before they're taught
[58:19] about the right thing in the
[58:20] bible what a shame
[58:23] that's why i talk about it in our youth
[58:25] meetings because i want our youth to
[58:26] hear it from god's heart first
[58:30] most the time i don't get to them but
[58:32] i'll say to you tonight
[58:34] take the authority of a christian and
[58:37] nip satan in the bud just nip it
[58:40] cut it out of your life and say i'm
[58:42] gonna reserve myself
[58:44] for my wife or my husband someday and
[58:45] put this in the hands of god
[58:47] and he controls it
[58:52] we should take a service about that
[58:54] satan cannot control anything unless you
[58:56] let him can you say amen
[58:58] we are under control it's in the agar in
[59:00] the garden that's what christ is
[59:02] bringing sons back to and satan now is
[59:05] he's like i said he isn't running
[59:07] anything but his mouth but he doesn't
[59:09] run anything unless you let him run it
[59:12] stand with me so i close
[59:17] i think i mentioned this last wednesday
[59:18] night but what did
[59:20] what did
[59:22] esther do with all the authorities the
[59:24] type of the bride what did esther do
[59:25] with her authority
[59:26] okay in a moment's time
[59:29] in a moment's time she was handed all
[59:32] the authority of the king the king said
[59:35] up to the half of my kingdom what is it
[59:37] that you want and so here's the question
[59:40] what did esther do with all that
[59:42] authority this is the type of the bride
[59:44] in a moment's time she was given here's
[59:46] this little unknown girl orphan girl
[59:48] orphan girl
[59:50] i think the brother preached it and
[59:51] she's handed in a moment's time she
[59:53] changes from having nothing to having
[59:55] complete authority that's a christian
[1:00:00] you didn't deserve it
[1:00:01] you don't earn god's authority
[1:00:04] it comes by his grace and the holy ghost
[1:00:06] and in a moment she had it all and she
[1:00:08] could have used it for anything she
[1:00:10] wanted you know the two things she used
[1:00:12] it for
[1:00:13] to expose her personal enemy in the
[1:00:15] presence of the king
[1:00:17] and to save her people's lives
[1:00:19] now i bring you back to my text where
[1:00:21] jesus said brothers james and john
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:24] you're going to learn this someday
[1:00:26] the son of man ministry has not come to
[1:00:28] destroy people's lives
[1:00:30] it's come to save them
[1:00:33] and esther under the mystery of god
[1:00:35] had that revelation because she could
[1:00:37] have used her authority for anything but
[1:00:39] she used it to invite her direct enemy
[1:00:42] into the same room as her king and
[1:00:45] expose them in the presence sometimes
[1:00:47] you don't have the you don't have the
[1:00:48] strength to do it on your own so you
[1:00:50] invite the presence of the king first
[1:00:52] you turn a tape on you turn you turn up
[1:00:54] some good lafontaine music on
[1:00:59] just plug in my music you know
[1:01:01] get some good holy ghost music going
[1:01:03] brooklyn tabernacle acquire something
[1:01:04] like that and you get he gets things
[1:01:06] going or you get in the word and you
[1:01:08] create an atmosphere okay and then you
[1:01:11] just you start looking at those
[1:01:13] weaknesses and happens in those demons
[1:01:14] and say okay devil in the name of jesus
[1:01:17] christ
[1:01:20] if you've got a habit
[1:01:22] and you need delivered bring it to
[1:01:24] church with you this sunday
[1:01:28] you got a devil on your shoulder bring
[1:01:29] him to church he don't usually stay very
[1:01:31] long
[1:01:33] expose him in the presence of the king
[1:01:36] and then the bible says musicians you
[1:01:39] should have taken the cue you should
[1:01:40] have been up here already
[1:01:42] the bible says and the next thing she
[1:01:44] wrote with all authority she wrote with
[1:01:46] all authority she wrote the salvation of
[1:01:50] the entire nation of israel her people
[1:01:53] it wasn't a selfish thing
[1:01:55] she used her authority to rewrite mercy
[1:01:59] rewrote my life she's rewriting the
[1:02:01] salvation of her people because she has
[1:02:03] the authority to do it
[1:02:05] the bible says she wrote with all
[1:02:07] authority just a little orphan girl she
[1:02:10] says i'm not anything but i have the
[1:02:12] authority of god and so i'm writing this
[1:02:15] and i'm writing this and she what she
[1:02:17] wrote became the authority of the entire
[1:02:19] land no devils can come against it no
[1:02:21] kingdoms could change it
[1:02:24] and it saved all of her people because
[1:02:26] jesus said this thing came to save
[1:02:30] people's lives
[1:02:31] not to destroy
[1:02:33] praise god all hearts clear tonight
[1:02:37] amen amen glory be to god
