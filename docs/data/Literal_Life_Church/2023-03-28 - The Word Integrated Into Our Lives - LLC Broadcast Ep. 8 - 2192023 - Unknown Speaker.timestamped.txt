[0:00] hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and

[0:08] time in the word of God if you're hungry

[0:18] at
[0:19] literallife.church may God bless you my
[0:21] friend and may the music and message
[0:23] encourage you today
[0:27] thank you
[0:34] [Music]
[0:38] Jesus
[0:43] [Music]
[1:01] it is
[1:05] [Music]
[1:28] around
[1:29] the same
[1:32] he's dead
[1:49] [Music]
[1:56] we should never be
[2:02] [Music]
[2:06] friends
[2:24] with me
[2:27] [Music]
[2:35] foreign
[2:40] [Music]
[3:00] thank you
[3:02] [Music]
[3:12] we should never be this way
[3:18] [Music]
[3:23] take it to the Lord
[3:31] [Music]
[3:53] take it to the Lord
[3:57] In Praise
[4:04] amen now these are the Commandments the
[4:08] statues the judgments which the Lord
[4:10] your God commanded to teach you that ye
[4:13] might do them in the land whether you go
[4:15] to possess it
[4:17] so the statues and judgments are what
[4:20] he's referring to is what came down from
[4:22] the mountain from Moses God's Prophet at
[4:25] Mount Horeb or another reference is
[4:28] Mount Sinai it's both it's the same
[4:30] thing but this is a significant point in
[4:33] history for God coming to his people and
[4:35] speaking through his prophet and what
[4:37] came from God is the word of God in
[4:40] statues and judgments and how to live
[4:42] and here it says when you go in to
[4:44] possess the land you're going to need
[4:45] these principles you're going to need
[4:47] these statues because when they went
[4:49] into the land when they'd crossed into
[4:51] the Wilderness but they'd give them
[4:53] that's when the battle really begun I've
[4:55] often said your battle doesn't begin
[4:56] until you get the Holy Ghost that's when
[4:58] the battle really begins and you enter
[5:01] the land and You Begin battling for your
[5:03] possession well his statues instructions
[5:06] were for to prepare them because he says
[5:09] you're going to need these things that
[5:10] my Prophet is saying you're going to
[5:12] need them when you get into the land and
[5:14] more every day you're going to need them
[5:16] even more
[5:17] so he says keep those statues and then
[5:20] he as he watches as he goes along in the
[5:22] scripture
[5:23] that thou mightest fear the lord thy God
[5:26] to keep all his statues and his
[5:28] Commandments which I command thee thou
[5:30] and thy son and thy son's son son that
[5:33] means your grandson all the days of thy
[5:36] life and that thy days may be prolonged
[5:38] here therefore Israel and observe to do
[5:41] it that it may be well with thee and
[5:43] that ye may increase mightily there's
[5:45] always a promise of God a blessing that
[5:47] goes from following the word it's always
[5:49] there as the Lord God of our fathers
[5:51] hath promised thee in the land that
[5:53] floweth with milk and honey hear o
[5:55] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and
[5:57] thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[5:59] all thine heart and with all thy soul
[6:01] and with all thy might
[6:03] another place Jesus references that he
[6:06] said with all thy mind as well so it
[6:08] pretty much covers the whole human being
[6:10] if you're going to love God then be all
[6:13] in and love him with everything
[6:15] don't just give him your heart give him
[6:17] your mind don't just give them your uh
[6:20] don't just give one part of yourself but
[6:23] give your heart give your soul and give
[6:25] your might get it give everything that's
[6:28] the only way to really truly love God is
[6:30] to give them your all a lot of people
[6:31] today is probably not a person in the
[6:33] world you wouldn't ask in the world say
[6:35] do you love God everybody would say yes
[6:37] but it has actions to it
[6:39] and when you do it you don't love him
[6:42] and pick which parts you want of God
[6:44] you're all in and part of loving God of
[6:47] course is that what he said before
[6:49] you're embracing his statues and his
[6:51] Commandments and these things that's
[6:53] part of loving God but look how he says
[6:55] this now Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[6:56] God with all thine heart with all thy
[6:58] soul with all thy might and these words
[7:00] which I command thee this day shall be
[7:03] in thine heart
[7:04] so so these words that I'm saying and
[7:07] that I brought through my prophet and
[7:09] spoke them these principles these
[7:12] Commandments this word that I've given
[7:13] you to live by was never meant to stay
[7:16] just in the head
[7:18] it must be in your heart
[7:20] so this ties back to Psalms chapter 1
[7:23] verse 2 where the man of God is his
[7:26] Delight this will tie back to what I was
[7:28] talking to a couple weeks ago about
[7:30] these things his Delight is in the word
[7:32] he does meditate day and night that the
[7:35] thought life saturated with the word and
[7:38] positive things brings Victory and
[7:41] stability no matter what happens
[7:43] I want to title this tonight the word
[7:45] integrated into our lives
[7:47] the word because it's not that we just
[7:51] have the word in these Scriptures it
[7:53] says the word must be integrated into
[7:56] your life
[7:57] and when I preached on the thought life
[7:59] that's what that man did he in his law
[8:02] he doth meditate day and night he
[8:04] directs his thoughts to come always back
[8:06] to the word of God there's a lot of
[8:07] things we can think about but he directs
[8:09] his thought and he disciplines his
[8:11] thought bringing him back to the word
[8:12] thinking of a scripture thinking of a
[8:14] precept thinking of something Moses said
[8:16] back then it was Moses thinking of it
[8:17] and they'd always discipline their mind
[8:19] because that's what that man of God did
[8:21] that was blessed he meditated on day and
[8:23] night he was his Delight but it wasn't
[8:25] just that I loved the word and Alive the
[8:26] Lord I loved the word but he meditated
[8:28] on he disciplined his mind said I'm
[8:30] gonna I have a choice of my thoughts
[8:33] I have a choice what I'm going to think
[8:34] about every day
[8:36] and so if I have the choice and I don't
[8:38] have a choice in a lot of things but if
[8:40] I have a choice I'm going to choose what
[8:42] I'm going to think about
[8:43] how many knows the New Testament
[8:45] scripture that says
[8:46] think on these things
[8:48] instructions whatsoever is good report
[8:50] whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is pure
[8:53] not dirty what sort of a good report not
[8:56] bad report not gossip and I'm giving my
[8:58] mind and the rest gets trashed and I'm
[9:00] giving mine to good things I choose to
[9:02] think on these things
[9:03] and we know the power of that and so now
[9:06] that thought life being saturated with
[9:08] the word and positive things brings
[9:11] Victory and stability no matter what
[9:13] happens in our life it counters
[9:15] everything a thought life that is given
[9:18] to God counters everything that's going
[9:20] on the fears of coming judgment your
[9:23] internal fears your personal fears your
[9:26] fears of the future your fears that you
[9:28] might get the same genetic disease that
[9:30] your whole family uh four generations
[9:33] back as God your fears of the coming
[9:35] judgments your fears of what's happening
[9:37] in the world it is the counter the
[9:40] thought life being being uh Pleasant
[9:43] under the pleasant thoughts of God your
[9:46] thought life counters all things and it
[9:48] brings victory in your life it brings
[9:50] stability in your life
[9:52] it counters the fears it counters the
[9:55] spirit of laodicea
[9:57] which is a lukewarm Spirit a thought
[10:00] life under control of God filled with
[10:02] the spirit counters the spirit of
[10:04] laodicea and makes you on fire for God
[10:07] instead of lukewarm for God
[10:09] that's why how powerful this thought
[10:10] life is
[10:12] um it brings the Hallelujah in the
[10:13] valley your thought life under control
[10:15] brings the Hallelujah in the valley
[10:17] we must stay close to the Lord that's
[10:20] what these scriptures say and our world
[10:22] must stay close to his world God's world
[10:25] our world must stay integrated with the
[10:29] things of God if not integrated
[10:31] saturated when the the Bible talks about
[10:35] take this truth put it on the doorpost
[10:37] of your house teach it in the morning
[10:39] and night to your children put it in put
[10:41] it in the front let's of your eyes that
[10:43] means saturate your life with the word
[10:46] of God now there's a reason why he's
[10:48] saying that and I'm going to give those
[10:50] reasons tonight tonight maybe next
[10:51] Wednesday and I'm going to give the
[10:52] reason because God always has a good
[10:54] reason why he's saying it but the main
[10:56] theme tonight is that it's not just that
[10:58] you have the word is it integrated into
[11:00] your life and into your thought life
[11:03] because when you get it then you get
[11:05] Victory so R we must stay close and our
[11:08] world must stay integrated with the
[11:10] things of God if not saturated with the
[11:13] things of God and the principles of God
[11:14] if not the spirit of the age can
[11:17] dominate us even Believers can get us in
[11:21] a state of lukewarmness
[11:24] even the church we know the laodicean
[11:27] church it's the church he's talking
[11:29] about in Revelations 3. it's not
[11:31] unbelievers can you say Amen it's the
[11:33] church that's in a state of lukewarmness
[11:35] so that means that Believers if they're
[11:37] not countering saying God I want to stay
[11:40] on fire for you I want to stay close to
[11:43] you
[11:43] if you don't fight against that you'll
[11:46] automatically become a laodicean
[11:48] I don't mean to call the bride laosians
[11:50] tonight but I have to be honest that if
[11:52] we don't yield to God we come under
[11:54] lukewarmness and God hates that he wants
[11:56] to spill it out of his mouth he would
[11:58] rather have you cold he'd rather make a
[12:00] decision so many people right now are in
[12:02] the valley of decision they're good
[12:03] they're making decisions what to do
[12:05] right now whether to follow the counsel
[12:07] of God or follow their feelings and so
[12:09] many is in the valley of decision and so
[12:11] when you're in the in the in between
[12:12] spot it's a terrible place to be and
[12:15] when you become lukewarm in your walk
[12:17] with the Lord God says I would really
[12:19] rather have you cold or hot but I I the
[12:23] the lukewarmness is what makes me spill
[12:25] it out of my mouth I can't stand that
[12:27] lukewarm water coming from the church
[12:30] my dad used to say there's nothing worse
[12:33] when you're a kid and you're thirsting
[12:35] after playing an hour of basketball and
[12:37] you run up to a drinking fountain
[12:41] and it's lukewarm water
[12:43] nothing worse than a good hot water for
[12:46] tea praise the Lord nice ice water
[12:48] praise the Lord but when you're hot and
[12:50] you need something lukewarm you just
[12:52] what do you do
[12:54] [Music]
[12:57] that's my demonstration tonight that's
[12:59] my visual
[13:01] it's what God says he does with our
[13:03] lives that become lukewarm
[13:06] so I would rather have you cold I'd
[13:08] rather have you just admit I'm cold I'm
[13:10] I'm backslid I'm you know I'm making a
[13:13] decision I don't want this I want the
[13:15] world he would rather someone be honest
[13:17] than than to be in between
[13:20] God wants to see passion God wants to
[13:23] see the fires of the Holy Spirit God
[13:25] wants to see us trying we're not perfect
[13:28] but we're trying can you say Amen your
[13:31] love of God comes natural my love of God
[13:33] comes natural if God puts his love
[13:35] within you you don't have to work at
[13:37] that but staying on fire for God you got
[13:40] to work at it you got to fight for it
[13:42] can you say Amen you got to bring your
[13:44] heart and your passion underneath God
[13:47] down fire
[13:49] you got to stay close to the fire if you
[13:52] want to get on fire you stay close to
[13:54] the fire
[13:55] and you're not distancing yourself from
[13:57] where the fires of God are which is in
[13:59] the word of God around the saints of God
[14:02] can you say Amen
[14:04] so you know it's it's several good
[14:07] quotes today that we're talking about
[14:10] uh people being critical of the the rude
[14:14] people at church
[14:16] and somebody posted
[14:18] these are the same people that talk
[14:19] about all the rude people at church that
[14:22] uh never stay after to find out who the
[14:24] people really are to know if they're
[14:26] rude or not and then there's the type of
[14:28] people that's the the the drag racers
[14:32] brother magulis says
[14:35] I love it he says there's some
[14:37] Christians that are drag racers they
[14:40] drag themselves to church and then they
[14:42] race away
[14:44] I love it I love it
[14:47] problem is I see it
[14:49] I tell you we ought to come early and
[14:51] stay late can you say man we ought to
[14:53] come and get what we need to get praise
[14:55] the Lord I want to don't want to be a
[14:57] drag racer for sure
[14:59] naturally and spiritually
[15:01] so in this lukewarm age this is a
[15:05] powerful weapon against it those who
[15:07] want to stay on fire they stay close to
[15:10] the fires of God and and so if how many
[15:13] want to live above laodicea how many
[15:14] wanna how many wants to be on fire not a
[15:16] lukewarm Christian amen so I think if
[15:19] you listen tonight there'll be some
[15:20] things I guarantee you that would be a
[15:22] help to you if you listen close you'll
[15:24] hear some good things other people just
[15:26] filter it out uh to what you want to
[15:28] hear like you normally do
[15:30] so now in this setting of Deuteronomy
[15:33] just in case you don't know we're
[15:36] they're getting ready to enter the
[15:37] promised land and there's an emphasis
[15:40] from the Lord that we can take today as
[15:42] well because we've received a word from
[15:44] the mountain through a prophet again
[15:46] we'll get into that in a minute that was
[15:48] a pivotal point when God brought the
[15:50] word to the mountain for the people and
[15:52] God did it in the Old Testament God does
[15:54] it in the New Testament through a
[15:55] prophet and there's an emphasis after
[15:57] they receive the word from the Lord that
[16:00] we can take today as well and the
[16:01] emphasis is don't forget the statues and
[16:05] the Commandments and the judgments that
[16:07] I brought to you from the prophet and
[16:08] from the mountain Mount Sinai or Horeb
[16:11] was pointed to so frequently in the Old
[16:15] Testament so uh so many times it was
[16:18] pointed back to pointing back to you the
[16:20] statues even when they got in the
[16:22] promised land Joshua was to remind him
[16:24] and to preach to them the statues and
[16:26] the things that come from Moses as they
[16:28] come into their promised land so they
[16:30] were to be to to keep their minds filled
[16:33] with those things Mount Sinai was a
[16:36] turning point it was where a prophet was
[16:39] used to deliver the word of God to the
[16:41] people it was a huge pivotal point in
[16:45] history the word of God of how to live
[16:47] was dispensed through a prophet that's
[16:50] what happened God coming on the mountain
[16:52] with his glory and his Prophet would be
[16:55] given the word of and that word would be
[16:58] how the people should live for
[17:00] generations to come God said I'll teach
[17:03] you how to live without that they'd be
[17:05] lost they would become idolaters they
[17:07] would become they would be given but he
[17:09] gave them an absolute he gave them this
[17:11] is what this is from my heart this is
[17:13] how you should live as Believers in
[17:15] Jehovah and it was you talk about
[17:17] specifics
[17:19] read the read your Old Testament you
[17:21] talk about specifics in that wall
[17:24] I mean it was specifics right onto
[17:27] dietary laws and everything and and if
[17:30] you read those they're to give
[17:31] protection to the people for diseases
[17:34] and all these other things and God had
[17:36] it all in his mind to start with and if
[17:38] you were living in that day you'd almost
[17:40] have to say how does God know about all
[17:43] this if he's never really been here
[17:45] lived out life and he's bringing us such
[17:47] specifics how to live about adultery
[17:50] about young people about all these other
[17:52] things and he's just bringing
[17:53] specifically if this happens deal with
[17:55] it this way if this happens if a girl
[17:57] get in gets engaged and her father
[17:59] didn't know about it this happens to
[18:01] deal with it this way how does God well
[18:04] God created us
[18:06] and God knew then from the beginning
[18:09] so he says for my people I'm going to
[18:11] give my absolute I'm going to give my
[18:13] word to them so they won't be
[18:15] floundering around if they'll stay with
[18:16] my word they'll have power to be able to
[18:18] live this pivotal point of God on the
[18:21] mountain it was a turning point it was
[18:23] where Prophet was used to deliver the
[18:25] word of God to the people the word of
[18:27] how to live was dispensed through a
[18:30] prophet it had the glory of God in it
[18:32] and and and so it had so much glory in
[18:35] it that Moses had to Veil his face so I
[18:38] want you to say something and I'm taking
[18:40] this very slow I may not get to
[18:42] everything tonight but I just want
[18:44] everybody to understand I would love our
[18:46] children to be able to understand that
[18:48] when God brought the word on the tablets
[18:51] to Moses it wasn't just this um uh
[18:56] lifeless uh mechanical spiritless thing
[19:01] that took place
[19:03] the glory of God was all over that
[19:05] mountain and that's something the glory
[19:07] of God was all over that place to where
[19:10] Moses had so much the power and the
[19:12] glory of in his face that when he come
[19:15] down on the mountain the people had that
[19:18] they said put a veil over your face they
[19:20] couldn't even see it it was so powerful
[19:21] It's So Glorious so the the word isn't
[19:25] just
[19:26] the word
[19:28] the word isn't just tablets the word
[19:32] isn't just letter it has God's glory in
[19:35] it
[19:36] so it wasn't just this mechanical
[19:39] spiritless dry event
[19:44] the supernatural God was there in that
[19:46] mountain causing the mountain to Shake
[19:48] in other words it was not just the word
[19:51] but his presence coming to the people
[19:55] bringing the word to them with his
[19:58] presence all the glories of God all the
[20:01] blessings of God all the presence of God
[20:03] lies in his word
[20:06] so that's why we come through the
[20:07] channel of his word that's why we
[20:09] saturated into our lives that's why we
[20:11] get it in our you know start with the
[20:13] brain I mean the the mind is the wound
[20:15] to the soul start there meditate on it
[20:18] get it into your children's Minds let
[20:20] them memorize it
[20:22] because the potential of the glory of
[20:24] God is in his word
[20:25] when that triggers and it becomes a
[20:27] revelation to them
[20:29] uh it's over for the devil
[20:32] can you say man if a young if a young
[20:35] person catches by the holy ghost or
[20:37] revelation of who they are and catches
[20:39] these Revelations of the word the
[20:40] devil's day is numbered with that person
[20:43] amen he'll still fight him but that
[20:46] revelated believer the Gates of Hell
[20:49] shall not Prevail against the Revelation
[20:51] the devil is finished
[20:54] when somebody gets a true Revelation
[20:55] from God and you can't get a revelation
[20:57] unless you're around the word of God
[20:58] hearing it
[21:01] amen you can't get it unless you're
[21:03] hearing because Faith cometh by hearing
[21:07] and hearing by the word of God so this
[21:09] event in Mount Sinai was so huge it was
[21:12] a pivotal point in history
[21:14] at least in the history of God's
[21:16] interaction with people
[21:18] but in Deuteronomy we we see here These
[21:21] Warnings
[21:22] of further instruction that now take
[21:25] these precepts that came from the
[21:27] mountain and from the prophet take these
[21:29] precepts
[21:30] take whatever came from God here and
[21:33] begin integrating them into your daily
[21:35] lives and I I emphasize daily lives and
[21:39] homes because that's what he that's what
[21:42] he talked about he he was referring when
[21:44] he's talking about put sitting with your
[21:47] children in thine house so the very
[21:50] prophet's message would now not stay at
[21:54] the temple or not stay on tablets
[21:59] he's saying bring what was said into
[22:02] your home let your children hear it let
[22:06] your grandchildren hear it
[22:08] put it on the posters put it on the
[22:12] refrigerator put it in your room put it
[22:15] on your phone
[22:19] put it everywhere you look put it in the
[22:21] front of your car put it everywhere that
[22:23] most places you can look you can have
[22:25] the word of God in front of you you
[22:27] can't do that at your job always but you
[22:29] have control of what you have in your
[22:31] home
[22:31] you have control of what you have in
[22:33] your own you have control of what you
[22:35] put in your mind
[22:36] and he's saying let this be saturated
[22:39] Let It Be integrated into your life this
[22:42] has power within it it must be
[22:44] integrated into our daily lives it must
[22:47] be red it must be talked about it must
[22:49] be spoken to the children
[22:52] and more so in this day as they hear the
[22:54] other voices of other standards and
[22:55] other absolutes thank God for the homes
[22:58] that I'm looking around here tonight
[23:00] that raise your children some of them
[23:02] may be astray but thank God that you
[23:05] held that word in front of them
[23:08] because that's what you were supposed to
[23:09] do the Lord young people God no matter
[23:12] how Wicked This World gets no matter how
[23:14] Wicked people get compromises borderline
[23:17] Believers don't always remember God
[23:19] himself brought his words of the people
[23:22] to live by and if you live by it you'll
[23:24] be blessed and you'll overcome
[23:26] it's just that simple I believe with all
[23:28] my heart
[23:29] so we must take what was dispensed from
[23:32] God and bring it into our lives and make
[23:35] it the Forefront of our conversations
[23:38] and our meditation we should surround
[23:41] ourselves with it
[23:44] I said we should surround ourselves and
[23:47] integrate
[23:48] and bathe ourselves in it
[23:51] constantly
[23:52] as much as we can
[23:56] we should surround ourselves with it why
[23:58] one reason he gives here in the
[24:00] scriptures is that when he says when you
[24:03] come into blessings
[24:05] the tendency to come into blessings is
[24:07] people forget God's principles
[24:09] you can use an example of something
[24:11] someone becoming successful
[24:13] and starting to make a lot of money
[24:15] money can ruin people riches can ruin
[24:18] people
[24:19] becomes the answer to all things
[24:21] of the Love of Money the love of money
[24:24] is the root of all evil but riches
[24:26] themselves when they increase for
[24:28] somebody it's a test of their character
[24:29] and so but you see if you had all that
[24:33] dumped on you
[24:34] it'll become a test
[24:37] it'll test everything that you are
[24:41] you know people sometimes they get a
[24:44] promotion and praise God for it but
[24:47] remember it'll be a test
[24:49] that you glorify God with it you go on
[24:51] with God but for a lot of people it was
[24:53] a test and you've seen what really came
[24:55] out of them they begin to Ditch things
[24:57] and ditch this and lay this aside and
[25:00] lay the word aside because the security
[25:02] of I can got my money to bail me out now
[25:05] I got my money so I don't need to depend
[25:07] on God as much it's such a deception
[25:10] such a deception so I want to stay like
[25:13] Paul and I trust that I can that he said
[25:16] and I've I've learned to be without and
[25:19] I've heard learned to have a lot and
[25:21] I've been in both places
[25:23] but I've learned whatever state I'm in
[25:25] to be content
[25:27] I'm not going to change my praise not
[25:29] going to change my worship not going to
[25:31] quit coming to church can you say Amen
[25:33] money's not going to change me I already
[25:35] have an absolute in my life I'm already
[25:37] a rich man I'm a millionaire spiritually
[25:39] I hit the lottery spiritually when I got
[25:42] saved
[25:43] I become a billionaire spiritually so
[25:47] any added blessings to pay the bills
[25:48] praise the Lord but if I never got it if
[25:51] I stayed a pulpr my whole life I'm a
[25:53] millionaire already the other reason
[25:55] that God warns he says when you get in
[25:57] there if you don't stay close to the
[25:58] world you'll be drawn to other idols
[26:01] because you're going to have the test of
[26:03] other idols
[26:04] so God knows how we are built as a human
[26:07] being and he's given These Warnings
[26:08] because we are built in a way
[26:10] that has the potential for a diversified
[26:12] heart
[26:14] God knows man has the potential to have
[26:17] a diversified Worship in other words he
[26:19] can worship many gods
[26:21] or he can worship one God that's not the
[26:23] true God but usually it's a diversified
[26:26] heart I'll give a piece of my heart to
[26:27] this God a piece of my heart to worship
[26:29] this I worship that I worship that a
[26:31] diversified heart and here in the
[26:33] scripture I read you tonight God says
[26:35] but I am one Lord
[26:37] and you're going to serve me you serve
[26:39] you only worship one God the human being
[26:41] with all of his emotions can be
[26:43] idolatrous and distracted to other gods
[26:47] than the one true God the only way to
[26:49] keep from that happening is to become
[26:51] consumed with one God to consume with
[26:54] God and the Christ who's the revealing
[26:56] of God
[26:57] can you say Amen God is looking at where
[27:00] our emotions and our passions are
[27:02] directed to I may look at you and not
[27:04] know where your passions are directed to
[27:06] I may not know that but God knows where
[27:08] your passions are directed remember
[27:10] worship isn't just when you're here in
[27:12] church raising your hands worship is the
[27:15] whole laying before something
[27:18] it's giving your heart and passion to
[27:20] something
[27:21] that's worship of the human being and
[27:24] the only way to keep that from happening
[27:25] is to become consumed with God that's
[27:27] another reason why he says stay
[27:28] saturated integrated with the word of
[27:30] God God is looking at where our emotions
[27:32] and passions are directed to this
[27:34] scripture shows that it's not just our
[27:36] soul he wants us to give but everything
[27:39] that we are that's why he says when you
[27:41] love me love me with all your it doesn't
[27:43] just say just love me with your soul and
[27:45] the rest of you just wing it no it's as
[27:48] integrated in all of our lives
[27:51] when you love me it's got to be with
[27:53] your mind soul body strength heart
[27:56] everything
[27:58] and why does God say that because he's a
[28:00] jealous God and all of our worship and
[28:04] passion and Direction goes only to one
