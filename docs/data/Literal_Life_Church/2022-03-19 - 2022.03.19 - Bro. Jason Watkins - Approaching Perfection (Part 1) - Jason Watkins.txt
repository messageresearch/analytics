TRANSCRIPT
========================================
jonah this evening and a little minor prophet books sometimes hard to find and just find daniel and go three four books over from there and you're running right into jonah amen daniel's pretty easy one to find amen you don't want to have a sunday school kid beat you to the scripture so i'm trying to help you amen well we're happy to be here and i'm that's pretty loud up here guys so um amen that's sounding a little better praise the lord happy to be here and uh this has been a quite a busy year for me rather remarkably so i i normally would never have taken as many uh services as i have i've been going every month uh usually twice a month since the new year and that's pretty unusual but the lord kept telling me to accept and to accept and so amen when when i spoke to brother paul we had actually kind of already brainstormed it a little bit at the men's meeting and so he was following up and since he was first in line i couldn't say no plus then the lord told me to say yes so here i am amen it makes me nervous to preach in front of so many good ministers and brother paul particularly is probably right at the top of my list and has been forever i so enjoy brother paul's style of ministry his content his sincerity and his heart for the people so you're quite blessed here amen amen praise the lord you want to be thankful to god always amen um you know the bride of christ is looking for stable solid ministry a place where they can bring their families to and this is a shaking hour it's a troublesome time but we're we're to have shalom and god has provided that amen praise the lord so we're thanking the lord for what we see here nice beautiful facility amen but of course brother branham said the real beauty of any church is the character of the people amen so we're thankful that there's such a building project here that's been going on for how many years now brother paul that bad huh yeah so old timer's already setting it on him he don't even remember how long he's been pastoring amen but it's uh but it's been a building project in case you didn't know that amen that's what a pastor's job is he he he leaves the father's uh kingdom and the lord says here's a here's a here's a group of sheep take them into the world and and grow them and care for them and mature them and bring them back to me healthy and bearing wool and that's that's i'd say he's done a very good job for the master amen jonah chapter 2 and we'll just read up verses 1 through 10 and let you be seated it's extremely familiar to us then jonah verse 1 jonah chapter 2 verse 1 then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice for thou hast cast me catch who look who did it see it it actually wasn't those boatmen those other seamen that threw him in god threw him in see for thou had cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods come passed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple the waters come past me even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped around my head brother branham you can see why brother brandon would say nobody had a set of circumstances like jonah amen so no matter how sorry for yourself you ever feel just go read jonah amen i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption oh lord my god he says now watch verse 7 and when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord good advice didn't it and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy so you want to remember that jonah made a conscious proactive decision to call the symptoms the lie and he called the promise the real that's that's proactive you got to do that he actually looked at very real symptoms this is not a metaphor this isn't a fairy tale this really happened to a human in real time amen and he looked at the symptoms which could not be equaled by anything you'll ever face and he made a choice to call the symptoms of the lie looking right at him with a wrapped all around him and he called that a lie and he remembered solomon's words and he said that's the truth so he says verse 8 again they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy see so you don't just keep looking at those circumstances you forsake your own mercies doing that but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving it's amazing he couldn't bring a lamb he couldn't build a fire he couldn't build an altar so he gave him the sacrifice of praise amen i will pay that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord and the and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land let's pray master we thank you very kindly lord as i stand here tonight and lord i the enemy has fought this sore and but he he ain't nobody lord i remind him all the time satan you're nobody you don't have any say in my life lord i don't live by the mercies of lucifer i live by the mercies of the lord jesus christ lord and i will not forsake my own mercies tonight i will call everything the enemy has tried as a lie lord it's just a distraction and it's not going to catch my attention lord i my attention now it's focused on your word and i give myself to it humbly and unreservedly not determined not to take my own thought lord i'm just your assistant that's all i am they sang a song they invited me up here and i just followed you up here lord that's all i've done that's all i it's all i wanted to do and here i stand lord now take your word this is this is your people this is your plan this is your message this is your purpose this is your everything lord so we commit it now to you holy and entirely in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you friends you can be seated brother branham took a sermon and i i kind of in on purpose tonight decided not to put anything on a display because i i just i don't want to read these quotes in their entirety but i just want to take some snippets and read them out to you and try to get your mind going in the same direction as mine and uh brother branham in the message i am the resurrection and life uh he preached this sermon at the funeral of garnet peak and brother branham was just so impressed with that young man and uh with his his humble way and his here he was suffering had been suffering for many years and yet he he didn't blame god he actually glorified god to his dying day and we find here that brother branham is trying to get the audience he's preaching this over in kentucky uh back you know among some of his own people and he starts talking about how that if a seed is planted uh no matter how nice that seed looks if that seed is not germatized it will not live i love brother branham's simple ways i love the fact we were we were rehearsing today team of ministers and i sitting there and we got to talking about quantum mechanics and quantum entanglement that's a favorite topic of mine and and and i said you know it's it's amazing that science proves the existence of god and they're too ignorant to see it and the bible says that in their wisdom they became fools and so you really you want to get a clear understanding of the laws of the physical universe just read hillbilly prophet and you'll learn more about the nature of man and the nature of nature amen and the nature of god amen and once you see it all of that then it all makes sense and and so we find here that he makes this simple statement it's got to be germatized it it'll go into the ground and will rot and that's the end of it all right so he says now that how that jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god so brother branham says we are placed here to make a choice and now he bear in mind he's preaching the funeral of this a wonderful sainted young man very godly young man that brother branham not only loved him but admired him would you love to be admired by a prophet and and he's talking about now he's trying to get the audience who have come to the funeral that's why i love preaching funerals i i don't like preaching weddings because everything's nervous and rehearsed and practiced and oh my goodness if you make a mistake it's second chernobyl and it's the end of the world and but but i love funerals and somebody said why do you love preaching a funeral i said because nobody will walk out on you and say whatever you want to say it doesn't even matter what you say everybody will sit there because the funeral and so plus you know if you're preaching the funeral of a believer then it's really not a funeral amen praise the lord uh brother paul and i were talking about that we both lost our dad um you know and uh over recent years and i was talking to my mom and she made the statement and brother paul kind of made the same statement so i jumped in with the same one-liner and uh brother paul started coming out and brother john died i said brother paul he didn't die he's not dead brother eddie brother john no no they're not dead they're more alive than any of us i promise you'd rather be with them than here amen so so when you're when you're preaching it that way and and you can you can even hear brother branham you know he's trying to get this kentucky audience to understand he's trying to get them to to understand the choice that garnet made he's trying to get them to make the same choice that he says it's got to be germatized hybrid corn you can plant it it won't do anything it's a nice seed but it doesn't have life it's a it's a it's life is perverted see and so this is why hybrid religion can never give you life it's got to be the living word of the age that you live in that's the only source that's able to to germatize the seed of god that's inside you the only thing that can bring that gene to life is the word of god the bible teaches that very clearly that we're not born of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word see and so it is faith in the word of god that brings the new birth it always has been that way it's never not been that way and so brother branham says any perverted life from god cannot live again we must be born again you know echoing the words of our lord you must be born again he says a believer has the life of christ within him i understand brother diggs was preaching along the gene of god last night but he talks about here a believer has the life of christ within him who rose up first for our justification to prove there is resurrection of human life a human body see because we because we live again because we've been germatized in other words uh born again of the holy spirit that's what germatized means if you ever wonder what it means to be germatized you're born again of the spirit of god that gene of god which is dormant in you but comes to life and that life that's inside it is zoe life that's god's life and that's god living inside of you and that's god continuing his program inside of you oh my friends that's where we have to remember you know i remember back in the in the day brother lonnie used to always make that point we've always got to see where the i am is that's so vital to see where the i am is that's when moses when he says they're going to ask me who sent you and what answer am i going to give them and god said you're going to say to them i am hath sent me in other words moses when they ask you who you are who sent you what authority do you have just say you're me just say i am hath sent me i'm here with the word inside of me and therefore the word i'm giving to you is his word and it has creative power in it now it's too early to get preaching yet so just calm down everybody so he says wherever you go whatever you look at see it's impossible to pass over these three concepts that are in nature death burial and resurrection we find out that resurrection only comes when it serves god's purpose that's an important point we find out that resurrection only comes when it serves god's purpose if it doesn't serve god's purpose no matter how beautiful it is how pretty it looks how much better it might look than some other seed that is germatized it'll never rise so you know it doesn't matter i mean this this auditorium is prettier than many auditoriums but it won't matter there's got to be germination take place here see you say well it's a wonderful facility that's fine and dandy but that the beauty of it the the the convenience of it won't get you a body change it'll take the word to do that it'll take your faith in the word to do that so if you if you don't then then all of your accomplishments we were pointing out to the church back home how that you know that paul talks about how and i don't want to get ahead of myself but how that paul's paul's great goal was that i may know him and the power of his resurrection i mean what else is there besides that for a believer i mean come on what what is it that you would chase more important than that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death why what's the point so that i can be a partaker of his life because life's all that matters nothing else matters life i gotta have life whatever you accomplish here wouldn't matter i said to the church there's been many great philosophers and many great uh educated men many great politicians many great uh champions of war and champions of politics and champions of education and and they knew the word of god they knew what it said they chose not to have anything to do with it so what does their life equal today zero for them we're we're here enjoying some of their knowledge they left to the world some of the inventions they left they're not enjoying it anymore see so so i'm enjoying it they're not so there's nothing more important than the pursuit of life he says you we might belong to church we might be fine people we might be a good character in the neighborhood a fine father mother sis son daughter but unless we are germatized with the spirit of god we will never rise in the resurrection it's finished i'm just wrapping uh these quotes up here i want to get them out of the way quickly nature calls out day by day the sun rises and sets the moon and stars come out the same the same thing everything in nature revolves in one thing death burial and resurrection isn't that funny he would call it one thing death burial and resurrection how's that one thing because it's all part of one thing as brother branham said in christ as a mystery god revealed the whole bible everything all the people all the stories everything that was ever written brother branham said god was working out one goal one purpose that he had in all the bible and everything and he says and and this afternoon we're going to look and see what that is and it turns out to be expression that god's whole purpose was to express himself god in christ and christ in you that's the hope of glory there's nothing else to give us any hope except that hope see so he says that um it's all one thing it's all a continuation now i can't i gotta breathe super careful because i'll really get into the morning material if i don't stop myself so death burial and resurrection death burial and resurrection it keeps repeating it everything in nature revolves around it every day of our life something is testifying to us death burial and resurrection we walk over the top of it many times but it's it's it's it's about eternal life it's got to be germanized and serve the purpose of god if it doesn't it cannot rise neither will we rise though we be good people and he's going to say it some more in case you missed it when he's talking about just being a good neighbor good character good father good mother good son good daughter and he goes on he says that that that though we be good people though we be church members though we be gallant neighbors fine people educated smart see life belongs to god alone and he's the only one who handles life so we must come to that place to be germatized by the word of god or will never rise again our life is totally finished see when we finish this life here that does it all together see if we're if we're not germatized by the word of god or any he just uses the other phrase or by the life of god see same thing you're going to really learn between tonight and tomorrow that the word of god is the life of god and the life of god is the word of god and the gene of god is the life of god and the gene of god is the word of god hallelujah it's all god continuing himself so we have our choice finally we have our choice we can be germatized by god you got this choice here tonight friends we can be germatized by god by his holy spirit and we can have eternal life if we don't when we die that's it we're ready for the judgment then why we didn't do it then the punishment it follows that for rejecting it so it becomes paramount friends that we can never bypass the most fundamental purpose of that day on calvary which was christ's death and we find out that that his death on the cross and his resurrection from the grave made the way for you to be born again see made the way for you to be born again there's no need to to go through life trying to to if you're a black bird trying to stick peacock feathers in your tail and claim you're a peacock doesn't matter set in a peacock church all you want have a perfect peacock pastor but you'll still be a blackbird you'll go out of here every sunday with with new shiny fluffy peacock feathers they won't stay in you'll have to come back next sunday and get some more they'll fall out you'll lose them you'll misplace them what did i do with my feathers because it's not indigenous it's not natural to you the thing that the thing that makes you a christian the thing that's most indigenous to you as a son of god is a gene of god and there's got to come a time when the omnipotent word meets an omnipotent word and life comes out of that [Applause] then you're off and running then you're building and then you're adding and then you're maturing of course see so it's it's becoming a brand new man as paul would say with a completely new nature not the one paul says we were all at one time had our conversation a lust of the flesh the things of the world and we're by very nature the children of wrath even as others but that that nature was not your original one the original one is god see so the question has never been you know where am i going when i die the question has always been where did i come from see i come from god i'm going back to god and there is not enough devils in hell that can stop that there's not enough circumstances can separate me doesn't matter what the circumstance is and nothing could separate jonah he had the worst set of circumstances imaginable but yet when he prayed god heard from heaven see so we're we we find out that it you become a brand new man with a brand new nature and a life following that demonstrates that supernatural change it's not natural born again of the same spirit that dwelt in christ that's the beauty of that day on calvary it gives you access to that same spirit that raised jesus from the grave if it dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal body see so so when you when you don't when you when you just try to do an end around on that when you try to circumnavigate that and try to go forward serving god then you really you don't realize it but you obscure the reality that you you didn't become a son of god when you repented you found out that you were always a son of god once you're born of the spirit that you you've now begun as brother beckett would say you're now cooperating in the vision of god whose vision god's vision god had a vision of of me yes of you exactly and every day he's working to bring you to that vision i don't know what's happened in your life yesterday last week or what will happen tomorrow but i know what he's doing he's bringing you to a vision you discovered you'd always been a son from the loins of god you're having his seed gene placed deep inside you and and and and and the day you know that that happened brother brown says the day you were put into the earth when you became a living soul and that's an interesting term in the old testament a living soul because adam was formed out of the out of the dust of the earth and and then he became a living soul created he's the only animal built in the image of god and therefore the whole term living soul tr when you take it through the hebrew it's literally saying that it's praying dirt because a man is the only one who prays yes no other animal prays no other animal worships only a human why because he became a living soul see so now now god is connecting himself to the earth oh my oh my okay so he's so now we find then that that we we we certainly believe in spiritual growth and maturity that's what coming to church does that's what reading your bible and praying does and and but but you want to understand that that that maturing that growth is a continuation of a yielding that began in that first total surrender that's what it is it's not something different it's a continuation of that original total complete surrender a life comes forward and you just go the rest of your life surrendering surrendering surrendering surrendering say what does that do for me you grow you grow you grow you grow into whose image his image hallelujah it's a total surrender we receive this newness of life and and it you know it's a it's a it's this complete surrender that brings the gene of god to life and it's not hard to get i i i've been you know several times out this year preaching uh to to young people and my i remember growing up with this message and i don't goodness gracious the the holy ghost was like getting the baptism the holy ghost like pulling teeth like how do in the world do i even do it man that's so hard and and we'd come constantly constantly constantly costly come to the altars come to the altars come to the altars come to the altars say my goodness when is it going to finally change my life and and i want to tell you something tonight the holy ghost is not hard to get in fact his brother brandon would say god wants to give you that more than you want to receive it see so okay well then do tell what's the secret repent repent that's the only requirement that's ever been and then you don't wait 10 days or 10 hours you don't wait 10 minutes you don't have to wait 10 seconds but what you do have to have is a 100 percent total complete surrender you have to have a complete repentance and if you don't i'm here to tell your friends then god will never seal that vessel until that heart is completely 100 you have come to know christ and by the time god gets you to that place i'm here to tell you you are so done with being you and you meet him and you don't want to be you anymore you want to be him hallelujah see this is exactly what they did in the book of acts they repented see and they they followed on to know the lord as hosea because that's the pro that's the promise in the old testament if people would just say man can you define the holy ghost it's not hard to do go read your old testament look what was promised to israel and israel spurned it went to the gentiles what were they promised i'm going to take out your stony heart i'm not going to just live above you i'm going to come down and live with you and i'm going to be a redeemer and then i'm going to live inside you and you're going to be a continuation of me hallelujah this is the jubilee [Applause] how is it today that somebody could imagine that they don't want that jubilee and say and i i get what you're what you run from a lot of times because we sometimes we see fanaticism we see misinterpreted theology and and we see you know all kinds of things that go on but i'm here to tell you don't let scarecrows keep you from a fire-breathing experience of the holy ghost it's the only thing that can change your life [Applause] see and so he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord because the goal remember that the goal is a divine goal restoring you to the perfection of christ now i'm going to say a little bit more about that momentarily but but this is what paul was teaching the colossian church to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom here's why here's the whole reason here's here's the payoff that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus see and so so you you and then you can see that if you if you just read acts 2 38 and then 39 and then 40 you're gonna find out they they become pricked in their hearts they repent there's thousands added to the church and then you know the next the very next thing you begin seeing immediately without any delay immediately you begin seeing then they that gladly received his word were baptized so they are immediately obeying the word and the same day were added three thousand souls verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and the breaking of bread and in prayers hallelujah and and that that's the evidence of the token is when you can say amen to every word not mental ascent but your life is saying amen that's what happened to them they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine [Applause] see because when you believe his word friends you can't you can't make it happen mary couldn't make it happen but mary could believe a word and i'm here to tell you something friends when i when when a child of god is confronted by the word of god there's really only one thing that child god can do and that's say amen and you see in the case with mary and the angel as soon as a a child of god says amen to the word there's only one thing god can do and that's bring it to pass he can't do anything different he has to bring it to pass because you said amen you believed it now he has no option but to do it hallelujah see so it's a definite experience that you have with the person of christ this is what restores the title deed to the church that's what came back to us under the seventh seal it gave us the abstract back it gave us the token back amen so don't don't don't be afraid of that my goodness people say well brother branham said you can't mix pentecost with this message well brother branham's certainly not talking about what happened in the upper room that's what the the upper room is what the message came to take us back to that's what the mess is all about receiving the token receiving the person getting the title deed an abstract deed backing a jubilee hallelujah it's obvious brother branham is talking about what became of the israelis a revival not talking about an original experience my goodness see so so of course we don't mix what became of the azusa revival with this the original azusa revival you it's part of this it's part of the part of the restoration of the bride tree but it but it but what it turned into because brother branham kept warning them he kept warning them you're going to keep sowing denominational seed and when the latter rain comes that's what you're going to be stuck with and you better stop now while it's former rain because as soon as that ladder rain comes that's it there's not another revival coming to the bride then the revival of the last day and when that revival came and seals were open you know what that happened to them they were stuck there's no way to receive those seals and so they had one option kick christ out and when they kept christ out god had one option have a prophet indict them for the second crucifixion of the lord jesus christ [Applause] and call a bride out of among the man-made systems so you're not part of that see so we are we are enjoying our latter reign we're enjoying our revival it is the bride's revival it's the word made flesh again i got to keep moving i got it i got to keep moving all right well we'll we'll go back in the morning the lord willing uh that's always subject to change but that's my plan anyway sometimes you get carjacked and you driving home and boom you you got to do something different so so we find then that that it is christ himself living his life from the throne of your surrendered heart a nature that was always inside the gene of god that was inside of you by election see and so you know it's dormant why you lived in sin before coming to know the lord so so then the so then the new birth is the perfect emergence of a brand new life within you just as a baby is separated from its mother when it when it's born it's a completely different unit and that's what brother brandon would say a brand new life when it breathes its its breath it breathed in the its own life its own personality and that's why brother branham would use the term brand new unit yet you're here we go brother oh my oh no i'm not i'm not going there oh my that's what we were talking about today but this is the continuation of god's life that's why only the that's why only the predestinated are considered in redemption it's not that god doesn't offer a legit chance to anyone to save himself from the sun toward generation you understand the foolish virgin not are not saved in the tribulation they're already saved from destruction but they don't go in the rapture because they're not born again you see what i'm saying they've never been germatized brother branham said they never got the moisture to make the seed grow see all right so so this is why we find that predestination of course is a byproduct of election and elections based on origin and so so this is why and i know people people don't like that though the world don't like it when you start talking about elected sons and i just say listen it's not the man that comes predestinated it's the gene of god in him see let's say what does that even mean well it just means that according to uh isaiah 42 there's only one elected son and that's christ said well how did you get elected i was in him i was in him i'm an expression that was in him and now i'm an expression and therefore i'm elected i come from god i'm going back to god that's why i believe that because i i can't not believe it because what's inside of me is what's inside of here so it doesn't even matter whether i understand it all my faith is supernatural it goes beyond my understanding hallelujah see so it's all about repentance you know when when you come into the world in that way all right now so so then when we come here to jonah said all that to come back around make a full circle so jonah prays unto the lord you're going to find out see that jonah's prayer it's it's a it's such an example it's such an affirmation of god's faithfulness in times of trouble no matter what your trouble is god is faithful do you know that the bible just goes ahead it's not trying to hurt your feelings but it just goes ahead and calls it like it is that even when you're not faithful he can't deny his own word and he must remain faithful thank god thank god see so jonah realized here in the belly of the whale that really nothing could separate one of god's own from him and i'm going to tell you friends there's a strength in that alone that will see you through the darkest time and the darkest trial and the darkest challenge and and and god brings us through these things and the enemy is allowed to get by with it and it's all working in the hands of god but just remember this that nothing as paul said nothing can separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus and i and i i love i've said it for years yes it doesn't matter if it's a sword or peril or famine or height or death doesn't matter nothing can separate me and therefore then me can't separate me you can't separate you if i could have i'd have been finished a long time ago how long come on people ain't that the truth if it was really up to you you'd have been kicked to the curb a long time ago and i'd have been piled up there ahead of you but god rich in mercy loved me while i was a sinner hallelujah [Applause] so jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and said i cried by reason of my affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heard us my voice so when i read this friends i i have to agree that no situation no situation could ever prevent a repenting child of god from being heard when they pray do you just remember that tonight now i want to tell you this i'm at a part now and these next these next lines that i've got here in my notes i don't know why i'm saying it i haven't talked to your pastor about anything other than how good the food was today but the lord brought these necks some these lines upon my heart a couple of weeks ago and said when you get there this is a direction you're going to take you didn't exactly tell me when i found out this afternoon it's right now so i want you to understand this that no situation could ever prevent this is what we're reading in our in our in our text and i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and so right here in the scripture where we're reading we find that no situation could ever prevent a repenting child of god from being heard by god when he prays and i want you to take courage tonight and the lord told me to challenge you to believe that i don't care what's happened i don't care what situation you're in you might have got yourself into it all by yourself but i'm here to tell you god will never not hear a repenting heart from his child i went down the waters come past me even to the soul i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me forever but thou brought up my life from corruption oh lord my god when my when my soul fainted within me this is good advice when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto the end to thine holy temple i want to tell you something friends i've never been in the belly of a whale but i sure have felt many a time like i put myself in hell on earth and only the only only thing i could do at that moment when i couldn't help myself is i remembered that he loved me i remember that i was chosen before the foundation of the world and all i could do was lean back on that with my faith and raise up my hands and repent and i knew he would hear me from heaven and he did say how do you know he did because i'm standing here tonight as a believer and i'm still pressing and i'm still standing and it doesn't matter what the devil has done or tried to do you're still standing here hallelujah friends you realize what an impossible age that you're living in totally impossible too dark too evil too wicked too perverted there's no way no one no one's getting out of here alive it's too too dark and twisted we're going to have to have a body change oh i'm here to tell you something friend we're going to have to have that same god that matthew and the regeneration by the holy spirit he that same life is going to quicken your mortal body hallelujah when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord they that observe lying vanities forsake their mercies but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that that i have vowed and the lord spoken to the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry ground i mean now i want you to think about this and just try to put yourself here wherever you are tonight and you say brother jason you know i understand you know trouser you know don't think it's strange when fiery trials it's more valuable and more precious than gold though it be tried by fire well friends don't don't let those words become a cliche to you those words are there on purpose now you have to understand that god's purpose for you can't be frustrated by you but god will use those things to correct and to grow and to nurture and sometimes it's because you've done wrong and sometimes it's because you haven't done anything wrong sometimes you're in a trial because you did everything right that's what that's what job did job did everything right but everything was turning out wrong see we'll get to get to brother job here in a minute but but you've got to realize that that look at the impossible task i mean how is this how is this prophet going to convert the assyrian nation i mean they're a world superpower of the day this is nineveh for crying out loud this this isn't you know the local village somewhere this is actually a superpower of its time and we but you see having come through the trial let me just give you a piece of courage here having come through the trial jonah 2.0 arrived in nineveh as an improved version over jonah 1.0 and sometimes god just needed to on the way to your big impossibility he needed to upgrade you hallelujah you needed an upgrade friends i hope i get an upgrade tonight i'd like to live a little higher hallelujah i'd like to i'd like to have a little more faith tonight i'd like to have a little more love and i'd like to have a little more shalom tonight how many want to have that with me [Applause] you know just like jonah i want to say tonight in whatever circumstance you might be in don't worry about the circumstance hear me this is directly on my heart from god to this audience don't worry i don't know who i'm talking to but just like jonah don't worry about the circumstances that god has used to get you to the place of repentance don't worry about it the task that he wants you to do is still ahead of you he'll he'll he'll he'll actually he'll have to bring you out of this trial i don't know what it is but i'm here to tell you he will have to bring you out to finally get you down the road to get to the task he's not going to leave you there friends i'm here to tell you though though he slayed me job said yet i'll trust him as david said he'll not leave my soul in hell he'll not suffer his holy one and see corruption i'm here to tell you the hell has come to the surface and the lid has been torn off and demon powers are streaming but here's the good news he won't leave you in this hell on earth he's got a he's got a word here that can lift you up out of it carry you forward as a warrior for god if he was finished with you then he wouldn't have brought you to repentance you're coming out i want to say to you whoever you are whoever how many of you there are here tonight who have lamented that maybe it's too late you've you've made up the mistake too many times you can never get back on track that mission was given to somebody else it was knocked it's waiting on jonah it was way it's waiting on you jonah had to go through a circumstance to get the repentance god needed and when he got to the job he was more equipped to do the impossible [Applause] hallelujah if he was finished with you he wouldn't have brought you to the repentance you're coming out now get ready to do what he told you to do hallelujah hallelujah this is why brother branham could say jonah was never out of the will of god amen never say well it looks like he disobeyed god brother branham said out of the will of god impossible the footsteps of the righteous are ordered over the lord brother jason good grief please make sense of that i'll make sense of it in one sentence god sent him through this trial to prepare him for his impossible mission the mission he had was impossible the mission that's ahead of you is impossible no other age has ever been able to pull it off and you're in the worst age by far you're in the age of complete apostasy total darkness gross darkness upon the people you've got the double whammy of the days of lot and the days of sodom converging on you at once no ages ever faced that this is the only age where satan is actually the god of the whole age this is actually satan's eden he's had 6 000 years to get it ready i'm here to tell you something friends god also has a word ready god also when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises up a standard you believe that you see that in in prophecy you don't think that what you see happening abroad and overseas and see you're seeing prophecy come to pass friends the world is being led to the to the third woe it's irreversible it's irrevocable you can i you know when when i read in the book of revelation and the terrible things that are that are going to take place there i i would love to spare the earth that calamity but i can't neither can you and it's not like the world says well if we could just get them the gospel we could we could save the whole world if they just believed the gospel the gospel never came to save the world the same jesus who gave him the gospel and said take it as the same jesus who told tells him in matthew 24 what's going to happen to the world it's going to be destroyed man's 6 000 year run and a fallen condition is ending this 6 000 year run of mankind in a falling condition and nature can't wait she's groaning hallelujah bride of christ is groaning and god is ready and we're ready hallelujah the world is moving in that direction there's no way to stop it no way to turn it around god didn't come to with the gospel to save the world he came to with the gospel to save his family out of the world i'm here to tell you that there are judgments and calamities rushing to meet us and the only way out is up hallelujah how many want to go up [Applause] so this is why paul would say yay dallas i count all things in philippians 3 8 i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung here's why that i may win christ and i you know i that that means a lot to me that that verse in philippians that i may know him the power of his resurrection this is why he was willing and paul didn't talk about losing losing bad things paul said what things were games no i didn't you know it's not like i gave away things that were hurting me i gave away prestige i gave away advantage i gave away position i passed up on on social acceptance i passed up on money i passed up on a comfortable life i passed up on authority in my church i had lots of friends i had a degree i had more letters on my behind my name than most of you have in your name that was paul amen but paul said what things were gain i counted those as loss because by comparison they could not touch the sufferings of christ they could not be found equal to be for what god had coming for his family and so so we find that that this that this you know so too many times that we we we study our bible and we read our bible and we study the message and we read the message and if we're not very careful sometimes friends we just stop at the accumulation of knowledge that's not even why the message came the message came not to just fill you up full of full of knowledge but the message came to to transform you into something see well we're transformed by the things that we gaze at we feed on the word of god and thus we're becoming the word of god and that's what really that's what really the message has come to do it's come to identify and god has a way don't you worry god's in control of everything you see i know the headlines look ominous but don't you worry god is in control of everybody so we find then that this is why paul would say in second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new so now this this is interesting because when when you think about redemption you you want to remember this and i'm gonna i'm gonna enlarge on this tomorrow the lord willing but redemption is the restoration and fulfillment of god's purpose in creation now say well that's that's a fancy way of saying it but it has a lot of meaning because creation happened at the dawn of everything it happened at the beginning so this is going all the way back to genesis now we're going back to see what's what's it all about what i'm here this has happened a message came i'm a believer i'm in a church before me my parents before them my grandparents before them and it goes back back back back back until we go all the way back through 2 000 years of church history then we end up at christ the keystone then we go on back to the prophets and the kings priest and we go on back to the children of israel we go on back through moses and abraham and and and and go all the way back to noah and then keep on going all the way back to abel and then we go all the way back into the garden and then we go before the garden and then we go we go all the way back to the earth was in darkness and void and chaos was on the face of the of the deep god is a master at bringing order to chaos and so you have to you have to remember that everything that that is in redemption is god it's it's it's a restoration and it's a fulfillment of his purpose in creation this is exactly why that in that when we read from genesis that that god uses that exact same wording god uses uh a new creation and so so so we find out then that that we we see this term used again because we when we talk about light shining out of darkness and and god said this at the time of creation let there be light now this is exactly why when brother branham is going to pick an example among several that he chose when he's going to pick an example how that you where the gene of god came to life he's going to go all the way back to when god said let there be light and brother branham says he was not creating the sun the sun that he already created the heavens and the earth in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth the sun was already there the earth was already there the seed was already there but there was a there was a thick blackness a billowing darkness uh the earth was in chaos and waters covered the face of the deep and there was no way for the sunlight to strike the sea because it was buried under all of that dark chaos and so the voice of command brother branham said the voice of command said let there be light god wasn't creating the sun he was speaking to the darkness divide separate drive back light must strike the seed i put the seed there to come forward and light strength the seed and life come forth and that's you you were born in sin you had a gene of god down inside of you it was covered over in darkness but an eagle screamed hallelujah you heard a word and what what was god doing god wasn't creating a son of god you already were a son of god he was speaking to the darkness and his word of command annihilated the darkness and light struck the seed and life came forward [Applause] so what so now it should make perfect sense to you that if he uses the exact same wording and the exact same plan the exact same methodology and then paul brings it over here and starts using the identical same words you see so what is your redemption it's god continuing his work of redemption god bringing forth his family so listen friends it doesn't matter what victories the enemy might have had in you they can't last say i made mistakes that can't stop you why because that has a shelf life that has an expiration date you weren't a sinner in the beginning you became a you were born in sin but that wasn't your original beginning i'm here to tell you that sin has a shelf life it's not eternal it didn't begin in god it's not going to keep continuing but your eternal life will always be hallelujah god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good see so we find it and i i can see stuff i need to skip here and we'll try to pick it up pick it up in the morning so we come to job i promise you would come to job i want to come to him just before i push paul's button tonight we'll un-pause in the morning when brother branham is preaching this funeral of garnet peak and brother branham starts talking about how that he says you know just as the sun sets over the western horizon now here he is in campbellsville kentucky and he's talking to all these people he's trying to get them to understand why this young man laying in a casket is not a sad story and he said i know it breaks our hearts we're going to miss him he said but but you have to understand that just as the western just as the western sun fell over the western horizon he said it'll come back again in the eastern sky and it doesn't matter how many times it goes over the western horizon it'll come back again it'll come back again friends i'm here to tell you something there's going to be a lot of nonsense of my life that that goes over the western horizon but when it comes back up in the east i'll be clean and i'll be pure and i'll be righteous and i'll be holy is there anything we can desire more than that to know him in the power of his resurrection when it comes back up hallelujah friends that's what happened to me that's what happens to you all my sins went over the western horizon and on the next day when the sun rose i was new i was a new creation i was a brand new person the flowers live and they die and they live again the grass lives it dies it lives again and this is where job came to because that you know as i said to you earlier job my how are you going to make sense of it here's a man and and and job himself struggled with this why it's like i'm being punished and i've and joe just tried to figure he said you know if i had if i had cheated a man from his wages if i had taken a maiden by force if i had if i had lied and cheated and betrayed my family if i had did all of these things but i'm innocent of these things i i've done everything right i've i've given my sacrifices i've served god i taught my children the ways of right and all of these things are coming upon me and as a human being you know don't feel bad if sometimes your negative mind gets the better of you and you forget the promises of god because that's what job did and as righteous of a man perfect in all of his ways he was really missing the whole purpose in what was happening and it really took a profit i'm so glad for a prophet in this day because when i a lot of times when you read it you can get little snippets of of encouragement but brother branham when brother branham takes up job's life and he says see if job could have only realized as a paraphrase don't have it in front of me he said if job could have only realized that everything he went through all those heartaches and all those trials was just for one reason so because god desired to put a little bit more of his expression a little more knowledge of himself into the earth and and god wanted to and say what knowledge did god want to put into the earth he wanted to put he wanted to introduce the thought of a redeemer he wanted to introduce the thought of you didn't begin here you're not ending here just carry on i've got a plan that this is a this is an eternal plan i didn't figure this out yesterday your your mistakes don't make send me back to the drawing board i knew you before you were born i knew you when you were born i followed you around your whole life and i wouldn't leave you alone until i got you to surrender and that's god see that's what god does chases you around and and so so so we find out that that that you know he said that god wanted to put this knowledge of a redeemer in the earth but but you remember when when in the gospels jesus looks out a window and says the field is truly white unto harvest pray ye the lord of the harvest that he send laborers into his field and brother brown says it's interesting because he himself was the lord of the harvest and brother branham said in other words what he's doing is he's saying to the disciples i want to do this but i need you to ask me to do it because you're in this with me we're entangled together we're entangled and we're not separate we're the we're the you're just a continuation of me and so i want that that i mean that that that's what the seventh seal unveiled when it unveiled the mighty god it unveiled his body it unveiled christ we were talking about that today at the table the brothers and i that because that's why brother branham could stand between trinitarians here and oneness here and to say brothers frankly you're both wrong he's not one or two or three like you're thinking because because remember that the trinitarians in their formula they divided god into three persons but the oneness were wrong because in their formula it didn't include his body it was jesus only but the opening of the seals revealed it made the mighty god unveiled and when the mighty god was unveiled the plan of redemption was unveiled and when the plan of redemption was unveiled there was a people being redeemed who were part of the same creation who were with god and were part of god hallelujah and it revealed the bride of christ and chris then christ becomes the mystery of god revealed unfolded unwounded un unwound and the bride becomes the mystery of christ revealed it's it's the word made flesh again moving in the earth because god is after a kingdom and so he's saying god here he desired to put the truth of redemption in the earth and so he needed to find somebody who could ask him a question if a man die shall he live again oh my and god had to find somebody who yeah he got weak in his faith and yeah he felt sorry for himself and yeah he blamed everybody but the president and and finally the the fourth man the holy spirit coming and tried to slap him slap some sense into him come on joe hold on i'm going to talk to you i want you to get ready for this and this this was the revelation that god brought job job you know where were you when morning stars sing together and sons of god shouted for joy think job now god's not being sarcastic he's not trying to make him feel bad he's trying to get him to understand job where you think you were when morning starts singing together sons of god shouted for joy you really think this life is just about this life job do you are you really that small-minded to not realize that you are with god you're here serving my purpose you're going to come back to god and when he and when job asks the question the trees die and they live the flowers die and the grass dies and it lives but what if a man if he dies shall he live and that's when brother man said oh god that was it that's all he needed that he stepped out on a thunderhead and come roaring down get on your feet job i'm going to show you something when morning stars sang together you were there when sons of god shouted for joy you were there you didn't start here job you're not finishing here job this thing's bigger than you job it's bigger than your fails it's bigger than your trouble it's bigger than the devil and nothing can stop it and it's god rich in mercy and job said i get it i get it i get it and though the skin worms destroy this body i have a revelation that in my flesh i shall see god with my own eyes i shall see him [Applause] this is god saying to job you'll be all right job you'll be all right nothing here lasts this life is only temporal it's only here to serve my eternal purpose in redemption you'll live again job everything you ever loved and everything that ever loved you it'll live again job this is a mighty plan and we're caught up in it tonight friends god has invited you to become a partaker of the plan of redemption doesn't matter what satan has done it doesn't matter what he's taken from you even if you were complicit in it i'm here to tell you this message of restoration i don't care what satan has taken from you jesus christ gives it back he gives it back right now and you can experience every characteristic that god ever intended for you to experience this is the evening time hallelujah this is the time when sons of god become made manifest this is the time when people who know their god will do great exploits you are the generation upon whom the ends of the earth have come the ends of the world have come i say it can't come too soon hallelujah how about you tonight friends say i want to be a part of that brother jason i want to be in that number i want to be part of the redeemed oh stand up with me all over the building say lord i want to be part of that redeemed family i want to be part it doesn't matter my life might have this my life might have that i might not understand this or that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because i can repent i can repent and i can say lord oh father oh i want to know you more deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind hallelujah friend is that the desire of your heart say father god oh lamb of god that i might know you the power of your resurrection brother paul would you sing that for us tonight knowing him in the power of his resurrection to know you in your death and resurrection those words echo through me oh that that that song brother paul wrote that years ago every time i get to that point to know you in your death and resurrection oh i want to know you more oh god nothing of this world matters lord i've already passed from it it's passed from view it holds no charm to me anymore i want to know him in the power of his resurrection how many young people say i want to know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings and be made conformable unto his death that i might be a partaker of his life is that your desire tonight friends i hope you'll take that tonight i hope you'll take what you heard is god's word god told me to tell you some of the things i said i i don't know where you're standing i don't know what may be happening in your life i don't know how much the devil has lied to you but i all i can tell you is it's lies all you need brother brandon talks in a prayer line i don't know why i can't get away from this it's just the holy spirit burning me up brother madam comes in a prayer line and here comes a person i think it was a lady and he comes under discernment he says now oh said you're a christian but now you've been away from god you went away from god how many believes he's married to the backslider he's married to the backslider friends he said you but you've been away from god but you want to come back she says yes he says all right you're [Applause] back oh glory to god friends that's what this message has given us that's what it's done for us oh i know you know this song your pastor wrote it it's went around the world i've heard this song sung in some of the darkest jungles of the world amen i want to brother paul to sing it and i want you to sing along with him we know the words god bless you friends we'll pick it up again in the morning god bless you sing for us brother [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] looking in your house [Music] oh i want to know [Music] hallelujah oh it's everything lord it's everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want to know [Music] oh sisters [Music] yes [Music] here our cries lord you are crying [Music] oh come on brothers with me now just the brothers [Music] oh our heartful one more time all of us [Music] [Music] [Applause] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] you just lift your hand say lord that's the cry it's the cry of my heart [Music] hallelujah [Music] god heard the cry from jonah god heard the cry from the darkest place [Music] and it was heard in the temple of god i just think that's just wonderful none of you have been where joan have been none of you've been where job's been so wherever you cry from he's going to hear your cry and my greatest cry tonight with your age hand i just want to know him more [Music] just [Music] jesus jesus jesus saints i can just hardly speak that the lord would bring us a special word two weeks ago last night today this is a special word just us and i'll tell you i receive it i say thank you lord for speaking to me so personally this is minister to me so much tonight [Music] all the in between really doesn't matter when you're looking at eternal life you know the baptists talk about eternal life someone needs to receive eternal life different denominations and our former understanding is you need to receive eternal life and it's like it's something coming someday you receive it you get to live forever someday friends god is speaking to sons and daughters like he ever never has eternal life is not just in the future eternal life is in us right now it has no beginning it has no end and all he wants to get sons to do is in their trials and in their and if they backslide and wherever they're at i thought it was amazing tonight that he allows our trials like he did job so that we would ask the right questions if you didn't have the trial you wouldn't be asking the right questions and god saying i let you go through this because now you're asking some deep questions now you're asking things you should really be asking and god says i'm here to answer all of them i'm going to give you a revelation right now eternal life is not something to come someday their life is now it's his life in us and when it's a it's an eternal life perspective it's more than a perspective it's a revelation we start catching it and we i don't want to repeat what's been said just so perfectly tonight but once we catch these things the stuff that's in between god's bigger than all the stuff in between we heard last night he's god says i am that was i i am i i was help me out brother diggs i was he is he was he is and i i am that shall be amen i'm alpha and omega he that began a good work in you shall be faithful to complete it [Applause] [Music] to us tonight [Music] somebody told me something one time said there's encouragement from her brother i said maybe 10 years ago it helped me out so much i just said don't sweat the small stuff anybody ever heard that before don't sweat the small stuff god's doing something god's working help me out a lot i forget it sometimes but we need to have our minds on something much greater than all this stuff in between it doesn't mean that we don't get emotional we're affected and you know job he's crying and he's you know he's feeling the effects of losing his kids we're emotional human beings god made us that way but the difference in us is that god says you'll not stay there you're not going to stay in depression you're not going to stay down and even if your backside you won't stay there as soon as there's repentance [Music] i just mentioned something to my church can i say this it's only eight o'clock i just mentioned something sunday last sunday brother jason i said that little parable that jesus gives and the pharisees the pharisees in the temple and he's saying lord he's he's praying and there's the sinners over in the corner and they're both seeking justification and all human beings are seeking justification of god it's the ultimate so the subject is justification but you see man you can't get that with god on your own and this pharisee said lord i thank you that i'm not like the sinner over here and that i've given my tithes and he starts listing all of his credibility and all that he's done and he's seeking to be justified by god but by what he's brought and i've lived in this and i've been i grew up in the message and he's bringing all this stuff and then the bible says the sinner over in the corner [Music] he's smiting his his breast he said lord i only want one thing i want to repent right now and i only want one thing i just need your mercy he didn't bring any of his credibility he didn't bring any of his background he did anything that he did nothing it's there's nothing he said god i just want your mercy couldn't even lift his head but jesus couldn't even lift his head you think this is a little parable i'll tell you it's speaking of now don't you dare bring your own things to god we need to know him more we need his mercy he needs to hear the cry of our heart and we need true repentance can you say amen god will allow trial in your life so the son of god will come to true repentance true repentance not not i'm sorry how many knows that i'm sorry is not repenting repentance is returning saying god i gotta return i gotta go back and so he smites his breast and he said lord have mercy you know what the last scripture says he said i tell you that that man went back to his house justified before god wait a minute he didn't present anything he didn't say anything he didn't talk about he just asked for god's mercy he just repented he just asked for god's mercy and he got justified went back to his house i'll tell you the word that we've heard last night and tonight i pray some people walk home repented and you go back to your house truly justified in the eyes of god truly justified and i'm going to live in justification i'm going to live in eternal life god's bigger kenny there's a song that years ago i don't know i don't know if we have it on there i'm just pulling it up this used to be a song says he's bigger than all my problems bigger than all my fears god is bigger than any do we have that up there don't sing it out or i'll have you come up here and lead it [Music] bigger than l my problem bigger than all my fears god is bigger than any mountain that i
