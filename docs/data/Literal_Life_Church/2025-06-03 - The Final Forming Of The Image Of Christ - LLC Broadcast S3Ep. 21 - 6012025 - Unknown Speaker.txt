========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you. [Music] Oh, one more time. [Music] Oh, do it again. Sing it with us. [Music] Oh Lord, you know when I'm giving my all or when I give in. And you know when I'm trying, but my heart's not in it. I'm amazed by the grace that you have for me every [Music] day. How could I let myself give you less than my highest praise? I've seen what we've been through and how much I've been blessed by you. So I'll do my best to bring you glory. Give my all. Tell your story, praise you through the trials, showing you're worth it all. Amen. Oh, you have stepped into my fire. Call me upon the water. You have called me to higher. You gave your [Music] all. So I'll do my best. [Music] Oh, I will lift up my hands when the circumstance pulls me down. When the world tries to silence me, I will [Music] sing. I will turn up my praise in the face of my enemy. Amen. I will dance in my freedom even in captivity. Why? Because I've seen what we been through. and how much I've been blessed by you. So I'll do my best to bring you glory. Give my all to tell your story. Praise you through the trials. Show me you're worth it [Music] all. You have stepped into my fire. Hold me up on the water. You have called me to it higher. You gave your all. I'll do my best. So I'll do my best to bring your glory. Give my all to tell your story. Praise you through the triumph showing. You're worth it all. Oh, you have stepped into the fire upon the water. You have to higher. You gave your own. So I'll do my best. Oh, I'll do my best. Oh, I'll do my [Music] best. I'll do my [Music] best. Philippians chapter 3 um verse 20 and 21. Verse 20 says, "For our conversation is in heaven." Some of these appear to be kind of deep things, but they're not really deep. Paul's trying to bring us something here. Conversation in the Bible usually means your manner of life. It's not just what you're saying. It's actually both. So, our manner of life and our conversation, our manner of life and also our words, our conversation, our manner of life is in heaven. So, it's in a different place. Even though we're here, our focus, our our our our bent, our our our manner of life is has a focus. It's not an earthly focus. It's a heavenly focus. So our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body. So now here's the body change. who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned or formed like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to s subdue all things unto himself. So I want you to notice in two scriptures here before there's a body change before there's a rapture our focus and our place that we've come to has a heavenly focus already. So we come into this place before the body change and then the body change and while that's happening our bodies and our uh character is being formed like unto his glorious body. So I want you to keep that thought in mind and let's just add in 2 Corinthians chapter 3. But even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, and it there he means Israel, when the nation of Israel, when they'll turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. How important is it is to see the Lord, not just uh Bibles and words, and because the Jews were they had the words read to them, but because they had a veil, they couldn't see the word, right? But when they turned the the Lord of the Lord of it, and they met him personally, the veil gets taken away. Nevertheless, verse 16, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed. So it brings all of us in now. We're changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. There's a quote from St. Martin. St. Martin was the church age messenger to the Ephesus murder Pergamus church age the third one and uh there's a quote I wanted to put up of him that is in relation to what we're speaking this morning I thought it was uh really amazing that he has this insight back then early on but he just says this St. Martin says, "Allow me, brothers, to look toward heaven rather than at earth." Allow me, brothers, to look toward heaven rather than at earth so that my spirit may set on the right course when the time comes for me to go on my journey to the Lord. I'm going to read it again. Allow me, brothers, to look toward heaven rather than on at the earth. So that it's he's he's expressing kind of like a prerequisite or a pre uh condition before the body change before the coming of the Lord. The condition is is that may I set my eyes and everything towards heaven and get it off the earth and get it towards heaven first so that my spirit is set in the right direction. How many this morning I'm going to bring it in our terms. How many this morning would love to have that rapturing faith to be raptured? You know the promise right now in front of us is the rapture. This is the coming of the Lord. And so I would want to know anything that the scripture brings me to set me in a place and in a condition to be ready and set in the right direction for the rapture. That's everything to me. It's not about making money. Can you say amen? It's not about all the things of earth. That's fine. Uh I think thank the Lord he's blessed us with a little funds to be able to pay our bills. But my focus is this promise. I want to get out of here. I want to see this rapture take place. We've been waiting for how long now? two 2,000 years that's been promised. And so I thought this was wonderful and I'll just bring it in our terms. In other words, what Martin is saying here is before the journey, he is coming into a certain place and that place that is setting him above earthly things, that place sets him in the faith for a body change. That's in my own words, words that we understand more because when he speaks of the coming of the Lord, then uh we know he's talking about a rapture and a body change. So, we keep looking at the one of my favorite chapters in the Bible is Psalms 27 because it is related to the conditions and the place that we're in before the rapture. Psalms 27. Let's read it together and we're going to break it down a little bit today. You got time with me? We're going to break down the conditions that surrounding the rapture in Psalms 27. So, it's all a secret. It's about a secret place. How many know the rapture is a secret? It's a secret catching away. So, all this becomes a secret. And there's actually a secret place of his pavilion that he hides us in. That's related to the rapture. No one will even see what's going on in this forming that's going on in this secret place. One day, we'll just be gone. But before we're gone, he has to hide us. He has to protect us. And what we learn in this place, if we'll get in it, we learn to overcome these conditions. And we learn to run and hide with him. The safest place to be is in that pavilion with him. And we learn to run to him. We learn to stay in that place with him because the conditions are too overwhelming for you. But this place is so powerful that we actually get two things. We overcome and live above the conditions and we're raptured out of the conditions. It's pretty powerful place. It's pointing us to a place Psalms 27. A position we get into for the rapture. Hiding and living above conditions. Hold that thought. Let me just say it this way. Isolated or more specifically insulated. Because we're not totally isolated from the conditions around us, but we can be insulated from it. spiritually insulated. I like that. So, it says in Psalms 27, "The Lord is my light, my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?" I'm going to read through it and then I'll come back and comment on the conditions. When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh. They stumbled and fell. Though, and host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my talking about a dwelling place. Dwelling place. Can you say amen? To behold the beauty of the Lord, to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, I did a series on the time of trouble. In the time of trouble, what's he going to do? In the time of trouble, fight back. Fight, fight, fight. No. In the time of trouble, he shall hide me. That's God's answer. Come on now. He'll hide me. Time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted above mine enemies round about me. Therefore will I notice this position. Now your head lifted up above your enemies, not below above. Therefore will I offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the Lord. Hear, oh Lord, when I cry with my voice. Have mercy also upon me and answer me. When thou sayest, seek me ye my face. My heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I seek. Hide not thy face far far from me. Put not thy servant away in anger that thou hast been my help. Leave me not, neither forsake me, oh God of my salvation. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take them up. Teach me, take me up, teach me, oh Lord, and lead me in the plain path because of mine enemies. Deliver me not over the unto the will of mine enemies. For false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. I have faded unless I believe to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart. Wait, I say wait on the Lord. I love it. So now if we break this down, what's the conditions before rapture that we're under? First of all, in verse one, fear and being afraid. More extreme than any other thing taking over people's lives. And Jesus said it about the end time. Men's hearts shall fail them for fear. I'm amazed how many Christians sometimes making decisions and the motivation is not faith. It's based out of fear. They're afraid. They're even doing things of the Lord sometimes, but they're doing it. Are you listening? If you obey the commandments of the Lord out of fear, They must not be done out of fear. They must be done out of faith. But the whole generation is full of fear. Being afraid. I got to move on to the next one. Verse two. There are forces who are out to destroy the body. There are demon um demonic uh forces in the realm that bring physical attacks against our body. Sicknesses, diseases. They're increasing. And so in this generation, a great condition that challenges us and makes us discouraged is the attack from the enemy to eat up my flesh. In other words, that's an attack on your physical body. Okay? This condition of this time, always remember, always remember uh that it's the enemy that's doing that. It's some force that's against you. The doctor doesn't even know that. So, we appreciate doctors, but you have to realize that when we're under these conditions, if he can get you down physically, he discourages you when you're physically down and you're physically sick. He did it with Jesus when he was hungry, he attacked them at his weakest point. Now, we have more sickness than we've ever had. We have more migraines than we ever had. We have more sickness, more medicine, but more sickness than we've ever had. So, what is that? What is What is that? Science should have solved the problem already and we appreciate science. But why do we have more sickness? More medicine but more sickness. Why do we have that? Because of the conditions before rapture. This is the attack from the enemy. Can you say amen? So number three verse three. What's another condition? Though a host should encamp against me, my heart should not. So now it's about the heart. It's about your spirit. And though war should rise against me, in this way I be confident. So the feeling in your heart of feeling surrounded, feeling overwhelmed in your spirit, feeling overwhelmed in your mind, this is a condition that I think is even worse today. Mental illness is worse than physical illness today. And they say in mental and and uh and heart it it's it's something that it overwhelms the mind and it overwhelms the heart. spoke on it a few months ago. Jesus said, "Take heed to yourself that you're not overburdened by the cares of life." The the trade of this age is being over our minds are not meant to handle all this pressure and the minds are going mental because it's just it's it's like it feels like David said this feels like because remember David is speaking he's speaking about terms of being a warrior but he's saying what you'll feel like in your generation in rapture time he's prophesying you'll feel like you're sitting somewhere and there's a host in camped around you and you're surrounded by the devil and your mind feels that way. They tell me that a panic attack a panic attack is feeling overwhelmed and then it's all coming at you and it hits you all at once and you have a panic attack. There it is right there in the scripture. Feeling overwhelmed. Verse seven says, "I cried." Sometimes you're so bad that in this generation, you're crying out for God's mercy with a loud urge in your heart. You're just crying out. I won't ask for hands, but I know I've done it. Is that you're just crying out, God have mercy on the situation. God have mercy on this. God have mercy. There's a cry. We're crying sometimes in this journey because we're human beings. It's okay to cry. Can you say amen? Crying out for God's mercy. Verse nine, the feeling I want to elaborate on this one. Are you still with me a little bit? Verse nine, hide not thy face from me. Put not thy servant away in anger. Thou hast been a help. Leave me not, neither forsake me, oh God. Now, David addresses God. And he says, it's the feeling that God is angry with you, that he's turned away his face, and God has forsaken you. Now, let me ask this question. When I read that last night, is that true that God has forsaken you? That can't be true. That's right. Not to his elect, not to his sons and daughters. But the feeling, the feeling is that you feel he's turned his face away. He's angry with me and he's forsaken me. It's not true, but it's so real to you that you feel like God has forsaken you. God, I don't feel his presence. I don't think he's there. And often, and I try to be careful because people start blaming God for things and God's forsaken me and I've crossed the line. And I try to be careful because you have to have a care for their heart because they're feeling that. You can get them to admit, you know, that's not true that God's forsaken you. He doesn't forsake. I will. He says, "I will never leave thee or forsake thee." Right? That's what his word says. But the feeling of it is God has turned his anger towards me. God has forsaken me. Guess what? Jesus said it at the cross. In other words, he come into such a dark time and such a low, the spirit left him in the garden and he's there going to the cross according to what the prophecy said he would do. And it's so dark and he feels so distant from God that he cries out, "My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?" Jesus felt that. Aren't you glad he felt that feeling? Our Lord felt like what it felt like that the father had forsaken him. But it wasn't true. The father was right there ready to fulfill his word. But he Jesus had to go through that so he would understand us when we go through this last days condition of feeling like we're forsaken by God. I've got to move on here now. But now we move to the next place and that's verse 10. And this is probably the one of the hardest ones. When my mother and my father forsake me. What a generation of a breakdown of families. The voice of the father to a son missing in this generation. All of his confidence is is is is uh formed by the approval of the father and you're not getting it because there's a breakdown of fathers then mothers that that woman she looks even to the voice of the father the approval of the father and generationally we're not getting it. So can I say something about this is that you can live your whole life being a victim that my parents didn't do me right. It's time to say, "Okay, we know that, but it's time to look to the victory of the future and not what your parents did." I preach to many people here that were raised the same way. But you know what? They're getting past their past. They're saying, "I can't dwell on that for 20 years. If you didn't have a good father, you have the heavenly father." And his voice speaks to you even this morning. Brings comfort, brings confidence. Amen. It's a breakdown of fathers and mothers. And he's saying that it's because the condition of the last days. When my father and mother, and that's that's a pretty close relationship breakdown. You can have a whole world forsake you, but when it's a father and mother, that affects us. Verse 11, teach me, oh Lord, lead me into the plain path. Well, I got to believe that the opposite of a plain path is a fuzzy path, unclear, a complicated path. That's the hour we live in. We got forces that have are distorting this message and distorting this Bible. Distorting this message to many people. It's the conditions for Satan to complicate things and take something simple and make it complicated. And that's why David cries, "Give me a plain path because everything's fuzzy right now. Deliver me over, not over to the will of mine enemies, for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. I know none of you have ever experienced any of this, but I'll preach it anyway. False witnesses that speak lies and words of cruelty and hurtful words to you. God, help me not to yield over to their will. Because you yield over to people who are saying hurtful words towards you. You wield over to their will under the pressure and you become controlled by their words. Somebody ought to say amen. For years, you're controlled by the hurtful words of somebody else. But we live in a day people are rough. People are hurtful. People are cruel. Pressure being controlled by them. In verse 13, the last one, I had fainted. It means fainting means you feel like giving up. But I don't know if you noticed that in all of those conditions of the end time and pre-rapture time, how first of all, how many raise your hands and say, "I've experienced all these." Yeah. Because this is a rapture chapter. That's what we deal with. But guess what? There are conditions that make us run into that secret place. They should. It should make us run away. The conditions, not the bride. It shouldn't make us more bitter. should make us better for the bride. These conditions, Satan's saying, "I got her. I got her. I'm I'm having her persecuted. I've got fear demons on them. I've got I'm I Their mind is they feel overwhelmed in their minds. I've got this. I'm going to discourage this bride." And Satan doesn't realize, buddy, it's going to backfire on one group of people. It's going to put them in a rapture someday. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." It's going to backfire on you, devil. Put all you want to on the pressure on them, it's going to backfire on this bride. She is going to come out of it. Did you notice every time there's a symptom or there's a condition, there's a positive side to every condition, there's a victory. Number one, when there's fear and being afraid, the Lord is my light and my salvation. The Lord is the strength and my light. Number two, when the enemies surround him, even my enemies and my foes came upon me, eating my flesh, they stumbled and fell. God will make the enemies, the feelings are overwhelming, it'll make them stumble and fall. Verse three, though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. He'll drive away my fear. The war should arise against me. In this will I be confident. You know what God's going to give you through that feeling overwhelmed, and surrounded? He's going to give you more confidence. Every condition has a positive response to it. You know why? Because this bride always gets the victory because Christ is in charge. He'll always get the victory. Skip down to the other ones. Let me get the positive side real quick. And now uh no, verse uh seven. Oh here, oh Lord, when I cry my voice, have mercy on me and answer me. When thou sayest, seek my face, I seek, hide not thy face from me. When you when when it seems like God is forsaking you, he says, be my help. Uh when when my father and mother forsake me, what's the answer? Then the Lord will take me up. He'll be my father. Teach me, oh Lord, and lead me in the plain path because of my enemies. Deliver me not over the will of my enemies, for false witnesses are rising up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. So deliver me not over to what? What's the positive? Here's the positive. Don't let me yield to their will. I want God's will. I don't not I don't want their will. And then I love this one. I had given up. I had fainted. And unless unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, there's a victory in every condition. Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart. Wait, I say wait on the Lord. Can you say, "Praise the Lord." So God turns the test to a testimony. That's right. God turns the loss into a liberty. God turns the lemons into lemonade. God turns the pressure into more potential. God turns the hurt into healing. God turns the panic into a promise. God turns the trouble into more trust. Oh, I should be getting more amens than that. He can turn a man of addiction into a man of conviction. Amen. Amen. God turns depression into possession. God turns mistakes into miracles. God turns confusion into confidence. God turns tribulation into jubilation. God turns problems into a position. God turns the rough days into a rapture because his people in these conditions are going to get the victory over it. Thank you for watching our service today.
