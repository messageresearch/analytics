For the Love of Christ constraineth us that means the love of Christ controls and compels us how many Barnaby compelled by the love of Christ the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should from should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh ye though we know have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so we don't know Christ and the flesh Christ is not in his own flesh of 2000 years ago here today we don't know him that way but we know him by revelation we know he's real we know he's a person he's just as real the only part that's missing he's not in his flesh he fulfilled those days for a certain time I believe it was three and a half years of ministry at 33 years on Earth so we don't know him we never knew Christ in that flesh body we will see him someday but we don't know him but we know him by Revelation can you say Amen but also Paul's teaching us that from henceforth we know no man in other words we don't look at one another by the flesh as Christians we're not viewing one another by the flesh by but by the seed that's on the inside the Christ that's inside someone and you say well I know people they don't have Christ but always always the potential is there that they're a seed that's not been dramatized yet so even with an unbeliever we're always praying and looking at them through eyes of Christ to say is the potential there you see so and and how many knows that's the way God looked at us it's a good thing some of you in the world some of you out there and I mean you know you're the least likely to receive this and yet you're here today hungry for the word of God somebody looked at you beyond your faults and saw your need and somebody seen that you were seen of God and God was the first one that looked at you that way if God looks at that us that way then we have to look at one another that way now I want to add in a scripture back in the Book of Romans just one scripture and Paul says something here um that adds in with the Str the subject this morning and I just want to title this relationships I've been speaking on relationships relationships that look past the flesh relationships that look past the Flesh and Paul says Romans 7 and verse 18. now he's talking about himself for I know Paul's talking about himself for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with you but how to perform that which is good I find not and so I want you to just remember the first part there this is a prophet how many believe Paul was a prophet and the prophet says about himself not the self that's the part of Christ but he says I know and this is almost a revelation that you have to have about yourself first and others I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing that's a prophet talking so how much confidence should we put in the flesh if there's no good thing it's nothing we can offer to God it's a it's a mess can you say the only hope that the flesh has is that you have the Holy Ghost controlling the Flesh and bringing it under subjection but in it in itself there's no good thing in it even a prophet of God and if he said that about himself then certainly if he was a prophet and there was no good in his flesh there's certainly no good in our flesh whatsoever amen it's only through Christ that anything good can come out of us amen and so I I want to go into how much we still look at the flesh relationship because if we're only fleshly driven for example if a husband only looks at a wife and her weaknesses and he begins to dishonor her and only views her according to the flesh he will become disappointed he will be angry he will be upset if a wife looks at her husband only according to his fleshly ways or just the way that he is she will become disappointed and guess what happens the relationship starts to get broken because you lose honor for what you really are a lot of a lot of times marriages just lose their original romance they lose their original attraction to one another because why for years you look at the Flesh and you know the flesh now and the flesh begins to to smother out the way that you should look at one another amen and it goes in churches as well is that if you only look at the Flesh of your congregation or your church if you keep viewing things if you look at your pastor only by the flesh then that will be smothering out what his position really is who he is as the Son of God a pastor can't help you and more if you only view him by the flesh a congregation cannot help you anymore if you only look at all the Flesh of the people and all their quirks and all their personality differences and all the things that irritate you and I'm going to show at the end some examples in Jesus showing the contrast in himself because when Jesus came of course seems the perfect Son of God and he began to be Christ The Mystery of God revealed he was the The Mystery of what God wanted to express through man he was the first time we began to see what God looks like in flesh because we'd never seen it in its fullness before Jesus was Christ the mystery it was the mystery of God revealed we never got to see what God would look like in flesh until Jesus came on the scene we finally get to see what does God look like in flesh and when he began that he began a whole Kingdom of Sons and Daughters of God who would be in the flesh who would be in sinborn bodies who would be born of sin shaped in iniquity saved filled with the Holy Ghost and then with the Holy Ghost they still live in their flesh in other words they still have the potential to walk in the flesh instead of the spirit and with all of that because of the perfect example of Jesus Christ he came into viewing and seeing things by by a vision by the righteousness of God in other words Jesus was viewing everybody he's seen not through the lens of Flesh because there's some people that came to him if he had been looking at the flesh he would have never given them the hope of what God could bring to them but because he was looking beyond the flesh he knew and he could see whether they were a seed of God or not he could see whether they are a god of God nobody else they were looking at the woman at the well nobody else could see she was a daughter of God but because Jesus was not looking at the flesh he could look inside and see there's a Seedling there this is the daughter of God if Jesus did that then we have to do it as well I'm talking about relationships I'm talking about growing into Christ's likeness and how we view things so at the end if I get to it and I want to I want to show a contrast between how Jesus was seeing things and how the Pharisees were viewing things because the most religious people on the face of the earth viewed everything according to the flesh and when somebody didn't line up their only answer was is that if they need to line up with a with the law they need to line up with the law they need to lie because they were all about appearance they were all about flesh this person's flesh is the myth and their only hope is to get under our religion and line up with all the do's and don'ts and then we'll be happy then they'll be right they had no vision for the righteousness of God they had no vision for the seed of God they're the daughters of God that this did not come by a law but it came by the spirit of Life coming in an individual and changing their lives transforming their lives so let's not put it on the Pharisees let's say how much do us sometimes look religiously like the Pharisees and view everything according to how we see in the flesh I'm believing that this series would help build stronger marriages build stronger Church build stronger relationship with with children and parents that's my prayer in this series because once we understand God's Oneness and God's glory coming in us will never view things the same we're looking for God's glory in the next individual let's just take a quick look at how God viewed Eve before the fall and I particularly mention Eve because we know that he created man a spirit man he was created in the image of God so he was a spirit man first before he was a flesh man and I keep repeating these things because I want everybody to understand include including the children when God created a man he says I create him in my own image and so God was a spirit so the first man Adam uh Adam created was not a body like you see it was a spirit man like God then the next thing in Genesis 2 then he takes that he breathes life into a vessel and Adam had a had a body now so he took that and he put it in there and so then in that body was both masculine and feminine Eve was inside of him so then after and then later on in the chapter God takes the next step and listen now when he takes Eve out of from the rib of Adam but now we have a byproduct off of Adam made from Adam with a different vessel and he puts that feminist part in that different vessel which means that she would be different she would think about things different she would look at life a bit different yet even though she's different they'd still be one so there had to be honor and distract and that respect and that's what Adam had so now when he brings that vessel out the way God viewed them in just before the fall God viewed when he looked at Adam and Eve there in two different vessels we know that when he created Adam he created his Masterpiece he created the animals he brought all these things on the earth of the world but when he got to Adam was God's Masterpiece and one day Michelangelo I'm just telling this for those who don't know one day Michelangelo creating that that uh that statue of Moses and one day it just becomes so perfect and so real to him and he just strikes it with one of his tools he said speak he was so inspired that it was so real he strikes it and then there was a flaw in the Masterpiece that it was the flaw in the Masterpiece that actually made it a masterpiece now we don't think that way we think if there's a flaw we're looking at the flesh but even with the flaw and that's when he brought Christ was God's Masterpiece he was perfect but then at Calvary it was like Michelangelo took that that Spirit the soldier took the spear and pierced him and he made a fall and water and blood came out and now the Masterpiece is flawed can you say Amen but that which came out of him actually made it the Masterpiece to make up a bride so God calls his bride Masterpiece it doesn't matter that she's a byproduct she's received the spirit of God and God says that's actually what makes her the Masterpiece what are you saying Redemption is powerful enough to take someone from the myri clay it's actually more powerful to take somebody that's flawed and born in sin shaped in iniquity and raised them up and that flaw that flaw God raises it to Redemption and he says when I look at her I look past the flaw and I see a masterpiece that's great to talk about that about Christ and his bride but what about relationships if God were to keep looking at flaws that it doesn't look like much a masterpiece does it hard to conclude that this is a masterpiece and so he looked at it that way before the fall and I want you to notice something about uh Eve when God looked at even that different gospel before the fall being a byproduct she had within her the potential to leave the word she had within her the weakness which we know now she did she left the word she fell and left the word and that's how every all of humanity fell but when God looked at her he knew even that she had something within her that could leave the word that could make a mistake and God still he's looking at her with Adam one with Adam this is still my masterpiece boy but without the new birth you're capable of doing anything in your flesh capable of taking drugs capable of beingcoming addicted today this is the addictive generation addicted to everything can you say Matt you're capable that's why we have millions falling to addiction they don't have Christ they go for an alternative I got to get some relief so I'm going to take drugs to get high and feel a relief everybody's turning to Alternatives because this generation is just about completely dead and gone insane because it's without the Lord without any hope can you say Amen without without anything some substance of them to change them thank God for Christ today thank God that we have a token thank God that we have the power of the Cross to change our lives and offer it to someone else without it there is no hope we're in moral failure in this country and we have spirits that are taking over I said wow can you that's a spirit wow somebody calls it a spirit and we have a moral failure in our country we have a moral crisis you're not going to hear very much of that when you hear it you ought to say Amen we're not going to bring back this world it's headed for tribulation we have the access to the Holy Ghost how many believe we still have access to the Cross to the power of cross we better be crying out to God for our children we better be crying to God for deliverance in our whole life we better be crying out for a personal Revival in our lives how many will say I commit myself to a personal Revival in my own life we need God more than we've ever need them before the Masterpiece became flawed and even with that even after the fall when God started to you know what even after the fall and Men fell and they lost their glory of God and they lost their Fellowship then God God began to build a nation with Abraham and when he began to build a nation with Abraham he began to look at them as their potential because remember I said you have the potential without the new birth of doing the worst staple things oh as a good person there's a good people praise the Lord you know I thank God for good people but without the new birth all the good that they do they have resident within their flesh the potential to do the most dastardly things dastardly is that a word I don't know they have and you have that this morning you have it within you and you know what I think killing somebody's influence is worse than killing somebody physically it's the same spirit but you'll do it because without something to bring that in control you go without down all those directions but when he began to build a nation in Abraham he began to look at them now here's here's we see you have the potential for evil but when you when God looks at you he begins to see the potential by his grace and he began to see the potential of his people and when he's seen the flaws he still called it a masterpiece in the beginning the fall made it the Masterpiece because the Redemption power of God is stronger than the flaw let me say it again why does God look at us he can see who we are in our potential and God can look past the fall because he knows the power of redemption will always be greater than the flaw there's no way that we can have Oneness true Oneness if we view each other according to the flesh would never come to it and I said something last Sunday that we're all so used to looking at people by the flesh we've had 6 000 years of only seeing the Flesh and we're actually taught to view and judge a person by what we see we actually bestow honor in the wrong places and we lift up the rich ones we lift up the highly gifted ones the highly gifted people get more praise become our become celebrities it's just how we're taught you know there's there's people that get more honor and then people that don't have the greatest gifts and they don't have a lot of money or they don't they're not successful in in what the world says we tend to okay they're they're okay but these are the real people that get more of our honor that's the same because Paul taught us in the body of Christ in in your Bible he taught in the body of Christ he said the ones that seem least likely the Lesser ones the parts of the body that are not seen and don't have that great of a function he said but they're essential to the body that's how the body of Christ functions but the world has taught us we lift up the wrong ones we praise certain ones Superstars movie stars and and then we put down others and this run writer a Christian writer Colin Smith he was talking about the scripture second Corinthians 5 what does it mean to regard someone according to the flesh from here from from now on regard no one according to the flesh and uh it's he says he quotes from first Samuel man looks at the outward appearance but God looks at the heart is natural for us to form Impressions from the most obvious things about other people and so then he he mentions some things here that I'm just going to use the ten things this is how we judge according to the flesh number one we judge by appearance how many would say that's true we we have been taught to judge people by their appearance and that can go from uh you know uh just are they ugly are they good looking um are they wearing the right clothes are they not wearing the right clothes um it can be I don't want to spend a lot of time because you know we but we judge we categorize we put someone in a place based upon their appearance and that's judging according to the flesh number two we judge according to ability gifts talents abilities that each of us has we're gifted in different ways uh in sports in arts in music and so that we live in a world that's just how good are they in this how much have they excelled in this and I think all of us should excel in our different things that God has given us and gifts but I think we should do it to the glory of God our musicians are always probing to get better and better but it's not to show off it's the Bible says to play skillfully upon the instruments we judge people according to age Paul says to Timothy let no man despise your youth so we look down on ones that are younger sometimes oh and then we look at down on the older the Our Generation actually looks down on the gray-haired older people and won't take wisdom from them I think that's a shame I think the Bible teaches otherwise that the young people should be hanging around the older people to get some of their wisdom I think Young mothers should ask the mothers who raise your children how can you help me I've got this child that's doing this have you been through this and you'll find mothers in the church yeah I've been through that been there done that got the T-shirt but the young mothers are too proud to ask the older ones and I think that's sad there's a lot of wisdom there but we live in a Young Generation that we don't need the older ones we're just going to we're going to do our own thing I think that's not scriptural but we judge people according to their age where they're at you know they're they're less if they're older and they have that gray hair the Bible speaks different we judge people based upon the friends that they keep the associates they keep we judge people based upon race how many know we judge people according to their rates we we have had uh uh distinctions in that and divisions that have come it was in the Bible between Jews and Gentiles they're judging according to race and different things we judge people according to gender God has made us male and female and he distinguishes the difference in male and female we judge people according to their work what's their work what's education what's their business what's their health we look down on them if they don't have an education what's that what are they doing their work are they successful when they work we judge people according to their home the the people the car that they drive the vacations that they go to the restaurants they frequent we judge people according to that the communities they're a part of we judge people according to their family and the of origin where they come from did they have a popular family do they have a family that's not popular and all these things and then he says we judge people by experience our experiences shaped us not only by genes but also the environment and so we come as a product of our environment that we grew up in the only thing that corrects the bad part of our history you might have a line of Alcoholics you might have a line of someone that's given to depression the only thing that corrects it is the Lord's power from Calvary can you say Amen how many can raise your hand and say that God has broken the cycle of a family history through the power of the Cross you're sitting here today he broke the cycle amen sometimes it takes years but God says I have power I can break that cycle and your future is going to be much better than your past amen but we judge people according to their families and are they this and are they that and we judge all these things and I could reflect on this but he goes into another part he says Christ changes how you see others and I agree with them it's Christ that changes how you view others and we don't view according to the flesh but something much much deeper and then the real Revelation comes is we see how Christ sees us because when we see how Christ sees us then we can look at others if you judge yourself according to the flesh either you will always be looking down on others because you see yourself as having more going for you than they do or you will always be losing heart because others have more gifts and more talents and more advantages and more opportunities than you and he ends it by saying and I am in harmony with what he says here when Jesus Christ is your Sovereign Lord what he thinks of you is first and ultimately the only thing that really matters thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website
