[0:00] just lift those up in prayer this
[0:01] evening god bless you each one psalm
[0:03] chapter 1 is what we read on sunday and
[0:06] we were here by ourselves with the
[0:07] musicians but we certainly had a good
[0:09] time and that archive got a little bit
[0:11] um the message got a little bit messed
[0:13] up on streaming i understand it was the
[0:15] ice on some of the lines and that
[0:17] restricted it so we apologize it should
[0:19] be up now clear and you can listen to it
[0:20] again and i'll go over a few of those
[0:23] things tonight that we went over sunday
[0:25] just finishing up so you won't miss
[0:28] anything there and we're going to go
[0:30] back to psalms chapter one
[0:32] but we do appreciate the response from
[0:35] sunday and we had about four or five of
[0:37] us here leading the service and sure
[0:39] different not having you all here that's
[0:41] for sure but i think they did a good job
[0:43] of just uh trying to create the
[0:44] atmosphere and i told them to get up
[0:46] before we all got up i said get up and
[0:49] sing and play your instrument and preach
[0:51] like there's 10 000 people out there
[0:53] that's the way i want you to do it and i
[0:55] think they did that i think they really
[0:57] did it and created a good atmosphere for
[0:59] us hopefully in our homes and such as
[1:00] well psalms 1 and verse 1 blessed is the
[1:03] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[1:06] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:09] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:11] scornful
[1:13] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:14] lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[1:17] and night and he shall be like a tree
[1:19] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:22] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:25] his leaf also shall not wither and
[1:27] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper i'd
[1:30] like to read verse 1 again but
[1:32] because that's probably what i'll mostly
[1:34] get to tonight blessed is the man that
[1:36] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:39] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:41] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:45] scornful
[1:46] so i i just want to speak a little bit
[1:48] tonight about walking sitting and
[1:51] standing in the wrong places
[1:54] walking and sitting and standing in the
[1:57] wrong places you don't want to be
[1:59] standing or sitting or walking in the
[2:01] wrong places
[2:02] but you want to be positioned in your
[2:04] position in the times we're living in
[2:07] father i pray you'll bless the word
[2:08] encourage the saints of god we
[2:10] appreciate your presence coming down and
[2:12] being among us we feel know that you're
[2:14] here and we know lord you have something
[2:16] to deposit into our hearts tonight and
[2:19] we pray father that that same anointing
[2:21] fathers we felt you just sweep through
[2:23] our souls lord and just
[2:25] give us a refreshing in the holy ghost
[2:28] may you come through the word now and be
[2:29] an encouragement to your people may help
[2:31] me help us get out of the way and
[2:33] encourage each one to come as believers
[2:36] tonight and anyone who is listening even
[2:38] after this lord though they be maybe
[2:41] unsaved or an unbeliever or someone
[2:43] who's on the on the border line i pray
[2:46] that these words would encourage them
[2:47] lord and get into the ark of safety and
[2:50] to give their all to you in these
[2:52] closing hours of time for lord we know
[2:54] that we are in the closing seconds we
[2:56] know we're in the last wrap-up and so
[2:58] lord every soul is important to you we
[3:01] just intercede for each one we pray
[3:03] you'll bless each life tonight in the
[3:05] name of jesus christ amen amen god bless
[3:08] you once you shake somebody's hand
[3:10] before you're seated tonight greet him
[3:12] in the name of the lord
[3:14] now walking and sitting and standing in
[3:16] the wrong places and i'm gonna make this
[3:18] just as simple as possible tonight
[3:21] and uh and go back into this a little
[3:23] bit i'm just rehearsing a little bit
[3:25] from sunday but we'll just elaborate a
[3:27] little bit more because uh sunday we
[3:30] talked about out of perfect faith the
[3:32] believer's position and what perfect
[3:34] faith is and how we get into that and if
[3:37] you remember we read quite a bit from
[3:39] that message perfect fake to show us
[3:41] that it wasn't necessarily brother
[3:42] brandon pointed to a lot of fasting and
[3:45] prayer although we should fast we should
[3:47] pray none of these things are eliminated
[3:50] but when he spoke the message perfect
[3:52] faith he gave us some different things
[3:54] that we can that that we would think
[3:56] that we would that would move us into
[3:58] living in a perfect faith and one of the
[4:00] things of course was just knowing our
[4:02] position jesus was in perfect faith
[4:04] because he knew who he was he had the
[4:06] confidence not human confidence but a
[4:09] real confidence in his position and who
[4:11] he was in god and what he was there to
[4:13] do what his purpose was on earth and
[4:15] when we begin to have a revelation of
[4:17] that that it creates confidence and
[4:19] faith love was another thing love works
[4:21] in coordination with faith and when we
[4:23] know how much
[4:24] god loves us truly loves us then our
[4:27] love reaches back to him and our love
[4:29] for one another and this creates this uh
[4:32] atmosphere of perfect faith and reliance
[4:35] and confidence that we're not so
[4:37] susceptible to all the fears of this
[4:39] world and the anxiety that's of this
[4:41] world you're not a sinner because you
[4:43] have anxiety today but we have to be
[4:46] reminded there is a resting place for
[4:48] our souls our minds our spirits we have
[4:52] a resting place tonight and if we'll
[4:54] learn as a christian how to move
[4:56] ourselves out of the nervousness of the
[4:58] world and into that position of perfect
[5:01] faith and try to even learn to stay in
[5:03] there every day how many raise your head
[5:05] i'd like to stay in there all every hour
[5:07] that's all of our challenge but we have
[5:09] so many things to try to pull us out of
[5:10] it but we've got to learn that nobody
[5:13] else is interested in this except
[5:15] believers no the message didn't come to
[5:17] everybody but except to believers that
[5:19] perfect faith is for believers nobody
[5:22] else wants that kind of life but we want
[5:24] it and so now we have to learn and be a
[5:27] move into an adoption maturity that we
[5:30] recognize the devil at every one of his
[5:32] tricks we recognize the fear of the
[5:34] world we recognize what triggers us what
[5:37] makes us upset what makes us unhappy
[5:40] what draws us down and soon as we begin
[5:43] to notice it we can quickly change our
[5:45] thoughts and say no no no we're not
[5:46] going there i'm staying right here in
[5:48] this realm of perfect faith amen and so
[5:51] this is something we learn it doesn't
[5:53] happen overnight i don't believe that a
[5:55] believer i believe a believer has
[5:57] everything he needs when he gets the
[5:59] holy ghost to be able to overcome but i
[6:01] don't believe he knows how to overcome
[6:03] overnight
[6:05] i believe we learned this i'm i'm 55
[6:07] years old and i've been serving the lord
[6:09] for 30 some years and i'll tell you i'm
[6:12] still learning every day i read my
[6:14] devotional the last three or four days
[6:16] that i gave as a gift and we had and
[6:18] i'll tell you i'm inspired by the word
[6:20] of god it encourages me can you say amen
[6:23] and i learn things every day from him so
[6:25] i'm like a child when it comes to the
[6:27] word and i just think i'm thankful that
[6:30] we can be teachable can you say amen
[6:33] we're growing into a life of perfect
[6:34] faith and so now why is this man in
[6:37] psalms 1 why is he so blessed and and
[6:40] favored by god he said because he said
[6:42] blessed is the man he's blessed he's
[6:45] favored he's thriving and he's
[6:47] prospering because it ends saying
[6:49] because he's planted in the right place
[6:51] everything he touches prospers
[6:53] everything he does prosper and so why
[6:56] why is he's this way the the simplest
[6:59] answer is he's living this way because
[7:02] it is where he has positioned himself
[7:06] because it says he plants himself
[7:08] besides the rivers of water
[7:11] so it's all about positioning it's all
[7:14] about where you plant yourself
[7:16] spiritually i know where you're planted
[7:18] tonight
[7:19] physically some of you are here in uh
[7:22] petersburg some are in your homes
[7:24] somewhere on the couch
[7:26] i'm having to stand tonight you're on
[7:28] your couch but anyway i know where
[7:30] you're planted tonight every in every
[7:32] other place but i'm talking about
[7:34] spiritually where are you planted
[7:36] because where your position and how your
[7:39] thought life is and how you think every
[7:41] day that's the position that shows
[7:44] whether you're going to live a thriving
[7:45] spiritual life
[7:47] and we have to stay there we have to
[7:49] work we have to walk in that place and
[7:51] so it's where this man positions himself
[7:54] and it's in that world of perfect faith
[7:56] that jesus talked about i read it on
[7:58] sunday that jesus lived in it he lived
[8:01] in a realm of perfect faith
[8:03] the devil couldn't get to him there and
[8:06] it's a place that it was a world to
[8:08] himself that nobody else knew anything
[8:10] about and incidentally praise god if the
[8:14] prophet is preaching that jesus lives
[8:16] there how many knows that jesus said
[8:18] that where i am they may be also
[8:21] everywhere that jesus goes he's bringing
[8:23] the rest of the brother and brethren
[8:25] with him he's the firstborn among many
[8:28] brethren
[8:30] he says he's leading many into victory
[8:32] in other words it's not just jesus that
[8:34] goes there but wherever jesus goes he's
[8:37] bringing every son and daughter of god
[8:39] with him
[8:40] and if he lived in perfect faith now
[8:43] it's time for us to live in perfect
[8:44] faith and it was a world all to himself
[8:47] brother brown says he explains where it
[8:49] perfect faith masters every circumstance
[8:53] how many have circumstances tonight
[8:56] how many has had a life of no
[8:58] circumstances
[9:00] i'd like to sit down with you and see
[9:01] what happened
[9:03] you're probably not breathing
[9:06] the reason brother says because we have
[9:07] a life of circumstances and almost every
[9:09] day there's some circumstance so it's
[9:12] not that we're not going to get them
[9:13] it's not that we're not going to be
[9:14] physically sick it's not that we're
[9:16] going to have not going to have trials
[9:18] we're not going to get sicknesses
[9:20] cancers uh deaths all these things to
[9:23] deal with can't promise that whatsoever
[9:25] but i can promise you from the word of
[9:27] god he gave us an escape he gave us a
[9:30] promise he gave us a place to live that
[9:33] perfect faith can master every
[9:35] circumstances and he can give you
[9:38] things that you know that you can
[9:40] control
[9:42] because there are things you can't
[9:43] control
[9:45] but i can tell you there are things the
[9:47] believer controls through the faith of
[9:49] god
[9:50] amen i told someone the other day you
[9:53] you know you can't you can't control
[9:55] what happens on the outside but you can
[9:58] control your thought life there's a lot
[10:00] of people's given up
[10:02] if thoughts are bombarding me and so i
[10:04] have no control no no you do have
[10:06] control
[10:07] the bible talks about it you have
[10:09] control to redirect your thought life so
[10:11] you ought to take that as a victory
[10:12] tonight to say satan can only go so far
[10:15] because
[10:16] there's a domain of my thought life that
[10:18] i can be in control by the holy spirit i
[10:21] can redirect my thoughts
[10:24] and he wants us to do that so he lived
[10:26] it around perfect a perfect faith
[10:28] perfect faith masters every circumstance
[10:30] and so it's about your spiritual
[10:32] position it's in when it uses the words
[10:36] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[10:38] of the ungodly standeth in the way of
[10:40] sinners sitteth all these words sitteth
[10:42] standeth walketh are all about position
[10:47] i know that's real that's just simple as
[10:49] dirt
[10:50] sitting standing
[10:52] walking
[10:53] is all about position
[10:55] and we think of it physically but he's
[10:57] speaking about a spiritual all these
[10:59] positions that we're in and place
[11:01] ourselves in and expose ourselves to it
[11:04] can be the right thing or can be the
[11:06] wrong thing and this this brother as an
[11:08] example this godly blessed man is chosen
[11:11] to position himself not in these
[11:14] positions of standing and and sitting
[11:17] amongst the scornful or standing and
[11:19] watching the way of the sinners or or
[11:22] walking with the council of the ungodly
[11:24] he distanced himself from that he
[11:26] intentionally positions himself
[11:28] spiritually that he's not going to be
[11:30] under those influences
[11:32] every one of you can do that
[11:35] every one of you can position yourself
[11:37] away from those things and so swalking
[11:40] standing sitting that's what i want to
[11:42] speak on walking sitting and standing in
[11:44] the wrong places i want to elaborate on
[11:46] it tonight because this is real this is
[11:49] the place sometimes that we get where we
[11:51] don't realize spiritually people don't
[11:54] know where they're at but if they stand
[11:55] back and look and they can they can see
[11:57] they've positioned themselves too close
[12:00] to a wrong relationship
[12:02] too close to feeding on something that's
[12:04] not right that can be from something
[12:06] very evil on the internet to always
[12:08] somebody hanging around a jonah
[12:12] you can position you cannot be involved
[12:14] in internet dirtiness but you can be
[12:17] always buddy and buddy with a jonah a
[12:20] backslidden or a person that's running
[12:22] away from the lord and you're staying
[12:23] close to them maybe you're trying to
[12:24] help them but you're staying so close
[12:26] that they're actually bringing you down
[12:29] and the guys on the boat with jonah
[12:31] eventually realize hey bud get off of my
[12:34] boat
[12:38] get off of my boat
[12:40] when they realized and jonah realized
[12:42] why the storm was happening and why all
[12:44] these incidents which had said listen
[12:46] bud we're giving you a kick whatever god
[12:48] wants to do with you but get off of my
[12:51] boat because you're causing storms in my
[12:53] life
[12:55] be loving
[12:56] be kind be gentle but don't let a jonah
[12:59] continue to be so close to you that it
[13:01] keeps bringing you down
[13:04] amen you want me to start over zach all
[13:07] right
[13:09] all right you were listening on the way
[13:10] okay so i can stick with it here
[13:13] praise the lord look at that
[13:14] embarrassing somebody who's late
[13:16] that's terrible isn't it
[13:19] all you remember when you're late i
[13:20] remember all everybody everybody's been
[13:22] late raise your hand that make you feel
[13:24] better brother zach look at all these
[13:25] people who've been late before
[13:28] all right where am i at
[13:30] petersburg michigan i know but where am
[13:32] i at in my notes so now if this position
[13:36] this place
[13:37] this uh
[13:38] positioning that he places a christian
[13:40] is is away from these things you you
[13:43] need to kick a jonah off your boat
[13:46] because he's he's in a uh sometimes
[13:48] they're not backslidden but they're in a
[13:49] place of running from god
[13:52] so you're talking to him maybe you're
[13:53] trying to help him give a word of
[13:54] encouragement but if you got yourself
[13:56] positioned close enough to them it may
[13:58] influence you
[14:01] so it's all about positioning yourself
[14:03] and so we're going to get into that a
[14:04] little bit more tonight that that uh
[14:06] when you were talking about walking
[14:08] standing sitting that about covers it
[14:09] wherever we are spiritually and none of
[14:12] those are in the counsel of the ungodly
[14:15] he chooses i'm not going to be around
[14:17] the council of the ungodly or around the
[14:19] path of sinners or in the seat of
[14:21] scorpio so the first thing in his mind
[14:24] is not to be open to just any influence
[14:27] that's around too many believers
[14:29] position themselves too vulnerable and
[14:32] too influenced by many many voices and
[14:35] then wonder why they have no faith
[14:38] and then wonder what's going on in my
[14:40] life why why do i feel so defeated there
[14:43] doesn't seem to be enough victory and
[14:45] they're not looking at the voices
[14:46] they're listening to they're not looking
[14:48] at where they're positioned they're not
[14:50] willing to pull away from something
[14:52] maybe
[14:54] they're not willing to cut maybe cut off
[14:56] some influences in their life they're
[14:58] not willing to do it and so now there's
[15:00] the defeat there's the thing that places
[15:02] you you can't live where you need to
[15:03] live there might need to be some real
[15:05] prayer to say lord what is it that i'm
[15:08] positioning my life too close to
[15:10] in order that's keeping me weak and that
[15:12] i couldn't be the full potential what i
[15:14] should be so the first thing he says is
[15:16] that this man walketh not in the counsel
[15:19] of the ungodly so to break this down
[15:22] this brother this sister has given a
[15:24] deaf ear to hear the advice and counsel
[15:27] of anyone ungodly
[15:31] he has chosen to give a deaf ear to
[15:34] advice or should i say screening the
[15:37] advice and counsel of everybody because
[15:40] everybody
[15:41] some most people have good intentions
[15:43] but not all council will do your life
[15:46] good right
[15:47] and so this brother this sister is
[15:49] saying i'm not i don't want to listen to
[15:52] the counsel of the ungodly
[15:54] he's not going to follow the advice
[15:56] their advice or their example
[15:59] and you should know friends that in our
[16:01] world you can receive counsel
[16:04] and counseling with not even going to
[16:07] pay
[16:08] and sit on a couch with a counselor
[16:12] in our world
[16:14] and in our environment
[16:16] i don't know if paul would have had to
[16:17] spoke about this as much as i do in his
[16:20] day or even back in luther's day but in
[16:23] our day people are receiving counsel and
[16:26] advice and guidance all the time but
[16:29] most of it's not good
[16:31] you have to sit down on a couch at a
[16:33] psychologist
[16:34] and and pay him 300 bucks an hour to get
[16:37] counseling
[16:39] every day you're getting guidance and
[16:41] counseling
[16:42] by what we read by the news we're being
[16:45] guided a certain way can you say man
[16:48] that the news intentionally guides a
[16:50] certain way
[16:53] and so now
[16:54] everybody else may swallow that
[16:56] everybody else may say you know i'm fine
[16:58] with that but but not us because listen
[17:00] now we had to screen the council that we
[17:02] get we got to watch the council that we
[17:04] get we got to know the source that it
[17:06] comes from and and we got to know what
[17:08] we trust can you say man
[17:10] and you can get counsel of what to do
[17:12] and you didn't even ask for that counsel
[17:14] but you're getting counseled
[17:18] people go and find the counselor that
[17:20] they want to find
[17:24] they only pick the people that's going
[17:26] to agree with them
[17:28] or they're only going to go visit places
[17:30] they can feel better about the guilt
[17:32] that they feel so they're only going to
[17:33] hang around and get the advice of ones
[17:35] that's going to tell them what they want
[17:37] to do
[17:38] i don't think that's wisdom can you say
[17:40] man
[17:41] so now you can you you can get counsel
[17:44] of what to do and you didn't even ask
[17:45] for it sometimes and you can sit right
[17:48] in your home with your phone and receive
[17:51] all kinds of influence within just
[17:54] minutes
[17:55] counsel is counsel is advice given
[17:58] whether formal or informal so it can be
[18:00] a formal counsel and somebody's telling
[18:03] you i'm going to give you some advice or
[18:04] it can just be informal and that means
[18:06] you can receive counsel but it it
[18:08] wouldn't be the right counsel it can
[18:10] mean guidance it can mean direction so
[18:13] you can get guidance
[18:15] by many things in this life and we must
[18:17] screen and we must be holy ghost filled
[18:20] to say i do not wan i want to make sure
[18:22] that i'm not receiving the counsel of
[18:24] the ungodly
[18:25] i don't want to position myself where
[18:27] i'm receiving the counsel of the ungodly
[18:30] you can receive guidance by movies
[18:36] you better choose the movies that you
[18:38] watch
[18:39] because you can receive guidance by that
[18:42] you can receive guidance by the music
[18:43] that you listen to you receive guidance
[18:46] by the books that you read can you say
[18:48] that you're being counseled you're being
[18:50] guided you're being directed a certain
[18:52] way you can receive guidance and counsel
[18:54] from the political voices that are in
[18:56] this world you can be influenced and
[18:58] guided by that political voice
[19:01] there's a lot of information out there
[19:03] especially on the information highway
[19:05] and daniel prophesied and said in our
[19:07] day that knowledge shall increase
[19:11] are we living there
[19:13] knowledge the wisdom of this world
[19:15] there's so much knowledge out there and
[19:18] some of it's good
[19:20] but you see when a christian is looking
[19:22] to the word of god he has an absolute in
[19:24] his life and he really has to be saying
[19:28] lord
[19:29] i don't want to receive the counsel of
[19:31] the ungodly you have given me a source
[19:35] to go to
[19:36] first
[19:39] and if you're not reading this and
[19:41] you're not
[19:43] wanting if you're not reading the word
[19:46] and going to that first
[19:48] and you're going to be swayed
[19:51] a million different ways
[19:54] because the wisdom of this world is very
[19:57] persuasive
[19:59] especially the teenagers
[20:01] especially the teenagers
[20:04] so
[20:05] um there's a lot of information and so
[20:08] but you see now by swallowing by
[20:10] and information is not a bad thing
[20:13] uh is information isn't necessarily a
[20:15] bad thing
[20:16] but swallowing it too quickly
[20:19] not putting it through the word
[20:21] sometimes
[20:22] making quick decisions on those things
[20:25] is not a right thing to do and we don't
[20:27] go
[20:28] with all the political extremes
[20:31] that's in the world today and the
[20:33] conspiracies and the fears
[20:36] politically it's swayed so many
[20:38] different ways but mostly either to fear
[20:41] or to conspiracies or to extreme and
[20:44] both sides whether extreme they are are
[20:46] it's both fear but it's the either
[20:48] conspiracy side or government control
[20:51] side you know what i'm talking about
[20:53] it's but it but it's all i i i i we we
[20:56] cannot
[20:58] go with being swayed by those spirits of
[21:00] the end time
[21:01] and and then there are some message
[21:04] people that are swayed politically and
[21:06] they're even using then they then they
[21:08] get some scriptures and quotes together
[21:10] and then they call it right
[21:13] he's just talking to brother steven
[21:15] shrew about this he'll be in not this
[21:17] sunday but next sunday to visit they're
[21:19] attending the church now so we're going
[21:20] to welcome the family next sunday but
[21:23] you know just talking to him about it
[21:24] the other day it's it's just amazing how
[21:27] swayed we can be
[21:29] and even sometimes in this message
[21:31] people standing for uh conspiracy
[21:34] theories and all these things that they
[21:35] read using quotes and using scriptures
[21:37] i'm just going to say as your pastor be
[21:40] very careful of what you read and not
[21:42] try to attach and put it the puzzle
[21:44] together
[21:45] you have to be careful of the sources
[21:48] and what's being said
[21:50] is that okay
[21:52] and i say that just as polite as i can
[21:54] say it but because we have that
[21:56] happening on both sides we can't just
[21:58] receive the counsel of a source and
[22:01] think that's okay we have to be
[22:03] prayerful we have to be praying we have
[22:05] to be guided by the word and the holy
[22:07] ghost in our lives or we will swing
[22:10] certain ways and not even realize that
[22:12] we're taking the council of the world
[22:15] or the council of the ungodly just
[22:17] because it sounds right doesn't mean
[22:20] it's always
[22:21] right
[22:24] not getting a lot of amens there but
[22:27] i'll say myself amen brother paul
[22:32] you know what we
[22:33] we're not identified ourselves
[22:36] first by democrats or republicans
[22:41] you may be tonight and i respect that
[22:43] but we're not totally identified by that
[22:45] that's not our identification i'm just
[22:47] reminding you
[22:48] conservatives are liberals you may swing
[22:51] a certain way but that's not our
[22:52] identification
[22:54] we're christians
[22:56] we're believers of this message we know
[22:58] what's coming down the road i can't
[23:00] believe people are so surprised
[23:01] sometimes they don't know their message
[23:03] they don't know their bible some of
[23:04] these things are supposed to be
[23:05] happening
[23:07] amen and if they knew their message and
[23:09] they knew their bible they wouldn't be
[23:11] so fearful because fearful sights
[23:13] fearful things men's hearts shall fail
[23:15] them for fear pestilences will continue
[23:18] and increase can you say amen brother
[23:20] brown says cancer will be a tooth day to
[23:22] what's coming down the road there's
[23:24] things coming on the face of the earth
[23:26] i'm not afraid of it because the word
[23:27] said it had happened but the word also
[23:29] said he gave me a hiding place to live
[23:31] in he gave me a hiding place he gave me
[23:34] an atonement and that atonement was good
[23:36] from calvary all the way to 2022. if i
[23:40] get sick if i'm gonna die i have an
[23:42] atonement to go to my god i have healing
[23:45] in the blood of the lamb
[23:47] let's not forget that though god heals
[23:50] true medicine god heals through
[23:51] different things god uses vaccines and
[23:54] all these other things let's not forget
[23:56] our atonement that god has for us
[24:01] didn't intend on saying those things and
[24:03] i don't want to be political but i want
[24:04] to say remember we're not liberals or
[24:06] conservatives we are believers
[24:10] we are christians can you say man
[24:12] this word is our absolute
[24:15] this is what we should be clinging to
[24:17] this is what we should look lord where's
[24:18] my guidance in the word of god
[24:22] amen some people's strong views
[24:24] originate in what they've been feeding
[24:27] on
[24:28] and not the word
[24:29] boy some strong views today
[24:33] not balanced by the word of god
[24:35] when that happens we got to remember
[24:36] we're believers
[24:38] and what we're feeding on
[24:40] has to be balanced and checked by the
[24:42] word of god
[24:44] you might want to quit feeding on it so
[24:45] much
[24:47] you do what you want to do
[24:48] but if this if this scripture and i'm
[24:50] saying i feel that this scripture this
[24:53] psalms 1 1-3
[24:55] and you've read it hundreds of times
[24:58] i think this scripture applies to where
[24:59] we're living right now
[25:02] because we're in a place we've got to
[25:05] know that we're not positioned under the
[25:07] influence
[25:08] mainly of anything
[25:10] but be planted by the rivers of water
[25:13] and by the word of god
[25:14] standing in perfect faith
[25:17] and then make your individual choices
[25:20] for your family of what's needed and
[25:22] what medicines need and all that make
[25:24] those choices being led by the holy
[25:26] spirit but never lose your absence
[25:29] is that okay with everybody
[25:32] some strong views and people get such
[25:34] strong views
[25:35] and
[25:37] you know and and if you watch sometimes
[25:40] it's just us tonight right
[25:43] and the rest that's the world watching
[25:44] here whoever's
[25:47] but
[25:50] you watch sometimes some people
[25:51] influence and i only say this because i
[25:53] last year remember i apologize for being
[25:55] just a tad too political even over the
[25:57] pulpit i don't want to become that way
[25:58] because we're not called to be that
[26:00] i have my personal political opinions i
[26:02] i get frustrated what things are going
[26:04] on but i can only let that go on so far
[26:07] because some things you're not going to
[26:08] stop you're not going to change it
[26:10] so you're not going to change it by
[26:11] voting you're not going to change it by
[26:14] raising a big revolt to it you're not
[26:16] going to change it by that
[26:17] it's not our calling can you say man our
[26:19] calling to say is as to stay as gideon
[26:22] saying tonight burning the midnight oil
[26:26] keep my lamp trend and burning let me
[26:28] say full of the holy ghost ready i've
[26:30] heard the midnight cry but i'm ready to
[26:32] go with him that's our calling
[26:34] and so now people get strong views
[26:37] feeding on certain things but they're
[26:39] not balanced by the word of god we're
[26:41] believers we have to be reminded of that
[26:43] and and my bible
[26:45] reads that we all will come in the unity
[26:48] of the faith
[26:51] my bible reads that we should all speak
[26:53] the same thing
[26:55] now how do you how do you pattern that
[26:58] with a world and a nation now that's in
[27:01] a civil war
[27:02] and in such a divide and digging their
[27:04] heels in on both sides
[27:06] if we let that come amongst us we'll be
[27:08] dividing over opinions
[27:11] and my bible says that we're supposed to
[27:14] come in the unity of the faith
[27:17] how are we going to come to that if
[27:18] we're influenced by the spirits that's
[27:20] in the world
[27:21] i ask you
[27:22] even listening on the internet how in
[27:24] the world do we come to the unity of the
[27:26] faith how do we come all speak the same
[27:27] thing and we're not even we're not there
[27:29] yet but i believe the holy ghost if he
[27:31] said in his word we're going to get
[27:32] there but we certainly can't get there
[27:34] if we're influenced by these strong
[27:36] opinions both sides and all of a sudden
[27:38] you get into conversations which you get
[27:40] into with somebody that's in the church
[27:42] or someone is like okay and you start
[27:43] digging in their heads all of a sudden
[27:44] you're divided on something and you're
[27:46] choosing to divide over that i don't
[27:48] think we should let that happen i think
[27:50] we should say brother i'll pray for you
[27:51] you pray for me help me to be balanced
[27:54] can you say amen but help us both to
[27:56] stay in the word to see a unity of the
[27:58] faith to see the holy ghost movement
[28:00] among us to see souls save to see our
[28:03] young people filled with the holy ghost
[28:05] can we get together on that
[28:09] and lay the political stuff aside
[28:12] because they ain't going to get us
[28:13] nowhere
[28:15] why are we becoming so much more divided
[28:17] because the spirit of our country is
[28:19] dividing
[28:21] i was talking to brother stephen and he
[28:23] had a good point
[28:25] it's clear you can see people get under
[28:27] a spirit of a nation that's in civil war
[28:30] right now and they not realize and i
[28:32] said they don't realize what spirit they
[28:33] get under we don't realize what spirit
[28:35] we get under sometimes politically
[28:36] motivated
[28:38] but yet
[28:39] he said i thought it was good
[28:42] if you're under that
[28:44] you had to first
[28:46] open yourself up to it
[28:48] to receive the spirit of it
[28:50] i thought it was a good point
[28:52] thank you brother stephen for saying
[28:53] that because nobody takes a spirit
[28:56] without first opening themselves up to
[28:58] it
[29:00] without clicking onto something
[29:02] and they opened the door
[29:04] so now they're teeter-totter maybe
[29:06] they're not possessed yet but it was a
[29:08] minister who said here the other day
[29:10] that
[29:10] i think during the retreat online there
[29:13] is a a christian can't be
[29:15] possessed but he can certainly be
[29:17] influenced by a spirit
[29:20] never full possession
[29:21] but he can be influenced you as with the
[29:23] holy ghost can be influenced by the
[29:25] wrong spirit
[29:26] amen
[29:27] you get over in a spirit of
[29:30] anger or something you act out a place
[29:31] you got to make that right right away
[29:33] can you say amen and you're going what's
[29:35] in here well a sprung spirit came in the
[29:36] home between you and your wife or
[29:38] whatever and so you may have all the
[29:40] holy ghost in the world but sometimes
[29:42] you got to repent and say god i see
[29:44] that's the wrong spirit that's working
[29:45] in me
[29:50] amen praise the lord
[29:53] so
[29:56] it's what we feed on
[29:58] and uh you open yourself spirit to
[30:00] spiritual son you open yourself to it
[30:02] then you can take on this thing it's
[30:03] kind of like the black dog white dog
[30:05] story
[30:06] and you can pull that quote up
[30:09] somebody told me brother braham says in
[30:11] 64 somebody told me one time was
[30:14] converted received the holy ghost
[30:16] received the holy ghost
[30:18] and he said to him
[30:20] how are you getting along and he said
[30:21] pretty good and pretty bad now he got
[30:24] the holy ghost and he how are you
[30:25] getting along pretty good and pretty bad
[30:27] he said well how do you mean pretty
[30:29] pretty good he said well since me
[30:30] received the holy ghost
[30:32] he said there's been two dogs in me and
[30:34] one of them is black a black dog one of
[30:36] them is a white dog and said they argue
[30:38] all the time said they growl and fight
[30:40] at one another this is the indian chief
[30:42] describing what's happened to him since
[30:45] he received the holy ghost and these
[30:46] dogs are arguing and fighting each other
[30:48] time and i said the white dog wants me
[30:50] to do good the black dog wants me to do
[30:52] bad said well chief which one of them
[30:54] wins the fight that depends on which dog
[30:57] which one chief feeds the most
[31:02] it's 1964 everybody
[31:05] i don't know why i have to bring up the
[31:06] year but i'm bringing it up
[31:09] brother brenham says
[31:10] that depends on what chief feeds the
[31:12] most so i think brother bram said that's
[31:14] a good answer see there's just just
[31:16] depends on the warring of the body
[31:18] that's in you it depends on which one
[31:21] you cater to which nature you cater to
[31:24] the carnal nature after the things of
[31:27] the world or the spiritual nature after
[31:29] the things of
[31:30] god that's the person with the holy
[31:33] ghost
[31:34] we're to move to adoption we're to move
[31:36] to an overcoming life can you say man
[31:38] but i guarantee you you feed on the
[31:40] wrong things you're going to be defeated
[31:44] and you're going to win victories you're
[31:45] going to lose victories
[31:48] and it all goes back to what you're
[31:49] feeding on
[31:53] questions you should ask
[31:55] if you're feeding on the council of the
[31:56] world is this right council is it truth
[31:59] is it trusted is it tested
[32:02] you should ask those questions
[32:05] a believer should not be living on
[32:07] google for information for the decisions
[32:09] they make all the time not following the
[32:11] dating habits of the worldly shows said
[32:14] that sunday
[32:16] don't live on the advice of people who
[32:17] have left the message and form their own
[32:19] life with what they want of the bible
[32:22] don't don't be under the advice of
[32:23] people like that their fruits show that
[32:25] that's not headed in the right direction
[32:27] so you're not taking scriptures and
[32:29] advice from them they're teaching the
[32:30] scriptures but but watch where their
[32:32] life is going
[32:34] so that's the counsel of someone that
[32:37] has not got the pattern of a life can
[32:38] you say amen and so now if this is some
[32:41] of the influences in your life you will
[32:44] never grow to more faith this uh blessed
[32:47] believer in psalms 1 is not influenced
[32:50] by those things he don't walk in the
[32:52] counsel of the ungodly he's not planted
[32:55] near the council of the ungodly he's not
[32:58] opening his spirit to just anything
[33:00] being said
[33:01] can you say amen
[33:03] we better make sure the council mostly
[33:05] comes
[33:06] if not all from the
[33:08] lord and a holy ghost-filled person
[33:11] don't underestimate someone that you
[33:13] know has the holy ghost to get advice
[33:15] from them
[33:18] don't underestimate what god can speak
[33:21] through them to help you
[33:23] and i'd rather go to a person maybe a
[33:25] little sister in the church
[33:27] sister yeah a sister she's got the holy
[33:29] ghost like a brother
[33:32] and you young sisters should go to the
[33:33] sisters that show that they have the
[33:34] holy spirit in their life and ask advice
[33:37] we don't do that a lot today young
[33:39] people don't ask for advice from the
[33:40] older ones
[33:41] but i'm not just saying the older ones
[33:43] they have some wisdom i'm saying i know
[33:45] this person has the holy spirit in their
[33:47] life they've proved it for years
[33:50] so i can trust i'd rather listen to what
[33:53] they have to say
[33:54] been through it been there done that
[33:56] been through the trials and there's that
[33:58] consistent life now just living for the
[34:00] lord i ought to have my ears open to
[34:02] somebody like that instead of some
[34:04] google or some scallywag or someone
[34:06] that's left the message i ought to be
[34:08] clinging to a holy ghost believer
[34:13] amen amen
[34:16] the next thing he does is that okay now
[34:18] that's the first part is that don't he
[34:20] doesn't
[34:21] he doesn't uh walk with the counsel of
[34:24] the ungodly now he doesn't
[34:26] uh stand in the path of sinners that's
[34:29] an obvious thing that we shouldn't stand
[34:31] in the path of sinners
[34:33] but standing in the path of them doesn't
[34:34] mean you're going down their path it
[34:36] means you're you're standing in the path
[34:38] watching them in the path they're going
[34:39] down
[34:41] you're around them you're watching what
[34:43] they're doing you're standing in the
[34:44] path not necessarily following them but
[34:48] just standing and watching what they do
[34:51] all day
[34:53] you're feeding on what they do
[34:55] and maybe how exciting their life is oh
[34:58] i would never do some of the things that
[34:59] they're doing but it's just fun just to
[35:01] get on and watch
[35:04] them in the path that they're on
[35:06] what path they headed down
[35:09] most of them going to hell
[35:12] amen
[35:13] so you're going to stand on the path to
[35:14] somebody oh i'm not on the path i'm not
[35:16] heading that direction i'm a message
[35:18] believer but you stand all day on the
[35:20] internet and you're standing there
[35:22] watching the path that they're going
[35:23] down this believer says listen i'm not
[35:26] going to stand and position myself
[35:28] watching the path they're going on i
[35:31] could be watching something else
[35:34] amen praise the lord so it's all day
[35:37] feeding on what they do and how exciting
[35:39] their life is how many know the
[35:41] scientists if you sit there all day and
[35:42] listen to that stuff somebody else's
[35:44] life is everybody's life is more
[35:46] exciting than yours their vacations are
[35:48] better than yours your life is a
[35:50] miserable failure you're nothing you're
[35:52] sitting there in your little
[35:53] three-bedroom house and you'll never
[35:55] reach up to where they're at
[35:57] you'll never make a cobbler as good as
[35:59] that person on the internet
[36:02] that's what the whole thing is about and
[36:04] now that's where depression comes from
[36:06] i'll never look like them i'll never
[36:09] have the beauty of them i don't know
[36:10] this is what our world has become
[36:12] christians should not be taking their
[36:14] cues and watching the way and the path
[36:17] of sinners are going down we've got a
[36:19] word to look at can you say man we've
[36:21] got the glory of christ among us
[36:25] god's doing things
[36:27] and we can be looking at something else
[36:29] besides the path they're going down and
[36:31] we can we got another path because the
[36:33] bible says that we can walk in the path
[36:36] in the light of the word
[36:38] thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[36:40] and a light unto my path
[36:43] that's the path i want to be on can you
[36:45] say man
[36:49] you ever sit and watch
[36:51] you ever sit and just watch people for a
[36:53] long time
[36:54] at walmart oh no
[36:56] i should have said that
[36:58] it's
[37:00] it can be a very entertaining day
[37:04] you can see where our world is at right
[37:06] there in central just take four hours
[37:09] if you've got that
[37:11] and if you want an entertaining day it
[37:13] probably for a believer will burn you
[37:16] to become a prayer warrior
[37:19] to see the condition people are in but
[37:22] an airport is another place if sometimes
[37:24] i'm stuck in an airport and it's pretty
[37:26] funny friends
[37:28] just sitting and watching people
[37:32] got a little discernment and you just
[37:33] see and it can be and my son and i were
[37:36] talking about
[37:37] on monday i sent a picture to my kids
[37:40] because the ymca i went to the ymca and
[37:42] the parking lot was packed with cars on
[37:46] monday you might have been there
[37:47] yourself i was there and the place you
[37:50] couldn't find a parking spot of course
[37:51] that's what happens every year
[37:53] all the new year's resolutions the place
[37:55] was packed but
[37:56] some of the things that my son and i saw
[37:59] were chuckling about is this all these
[38:01] big guys coming in there which i'm one
[38:03] of them big guys come in you haven't
[38:05] seen them in there all year but they're
[38:06] coming in and they're going to do
[38:08] everything in one day and there's lines
[38:10] waiting for the bench press and there's
[38:12] lie waiting for the weights and they're
[38:14] going to lift 160 pounds on the first
[38:17] day and they're killing themselves
[38:18] through it it's funny to watch
[38:22] he had a blast watching them and here
[38:24] he's working for months to work up to
[38:26] 160 they're going to do it the first day
[38:29] and they're dying and you probably won't
[38:31] even see them tomorrow
[38:35] it's true it lasts about two or three
[38:37] weeks and spring comes along and it's
[38:39] like well i wore myself that out that's
[38:41] it it's funny to watch people sometimes
[38:44] and so in our nature we watch those
[38:46] things and we watch people but in our
[38:48] nature we can get on the internet and we
[38:50] can just watch people and if we're not
[38:51] strong ourselves
[38:53] we can be influenced by watching the
[38:54] path of others
[38:56] if we're not strong in the holy ghost we
[38:58] start to get we say well maybe there's
[39:02] something to that no no there's nothing
[39:03] to it
[39:06] amen
[39:08] just standing and watching the sinners
[39:10] go on their path a path that leads to a
[39:12] wrong place don't forget
[39:15] watching the life of the backslidden
[39:17] person as i said about jonah
[39:20] we shouldn't do that because it weakens
[39:22] us it's not a good position to be in to
[39:24] be standing in the way
[39:26] of sinners it's not good to be
[39:31] it's not going to be walking in the
[39:33] counsel of the ungodly
[39:36] it's not good to be standing in the path
[39:38] of sinners
[39:40] watching which direction they're going
[39:41] now let me do this deal with this one
[39:44] just before we wrap it up here tonight
[39:49] he doesn't sit in the seat of the
[39:52] scornful
[39:54] and that means the scoffers that can
[39:56] mean people that are critical
[39:59] how many's ever been around critical
[40:00] people
[40:03] you might be one tonight
[40:06] i've been critical before
[40:09] the seed of scornful can mean many
[40:11] things brother bram says i was sitting
[40:12] in the sea the scornful back in 1955 or
[40:15] 56 uh maybe a little later when he got
[40:17] the church
[40:18] and some pentecostals came in
[40:20] and they started to dance and had the
[40:21] tambourine and go at it and the baptist
[40:24] like he was he said my i got real
[40:26] critical i said look what they're doing
[40:27] to my church they're tearing things up
[40:28] they're dancing they're shouting around
[40:30] this place he said i he said i was
[40:32] sitting in the seat
[40:34] of the scornful
[40:36] sat there for
[40:37] 15 20 half a half hour just being just
[40:40] as critical man i'm gonna have to get up
[40:41] and bring some church order this church
[40:43] and just being critical i was sitting in
[40:45] the seat
[40:46] of the scornful
[40:48] be careful what we say when the spirit
[40:50] is
[40:50] moving i know that people sometimes get
[40:53] in the flesh
[40:55] but i would rather have a little
[40:57] wildfire
[40:59] than no fire at all
[41:02] and if someone gets way out of line sure
[41:03] we'll we'll bring them in line will
[41:05] correct him but listen listen let the
[41:07] spirit move let him do what he wants to
[41:10] do
[41:11] amen
[41:12] if we start restricting that we become
[41:14] like a denomination can you say amen
[41:17] we got to let the lord do what he wants
[41:18] to do and so he was scorned for these
[41:20] pentecost until god convicted him in the
[41:22] service that you're sitting in the sea
[41:24] of scornful and he reminded him in the
[41:26] bible of david dancing and embarrassing
[41:28] his wife and dancing before the lord
[41:30] this is exactly what they did in the
[41:32] bible it's what they did on the day of
[41:33] pentecost that's what they did
[41:34] throughout when the blessings of the
[41:36] lord that may not be the anointing
[41:38] because brother bram says the anointing
[41:39] is something different but then the
[41:40] blessings come we ought to enjoy it and
[41:42] let everybody else enjoy it i believe
[41:44] the blessings came in here tonight the
[41:46] whole presence of the lord blessed us
[41:48] tonight we ought to enjoy every moment
[41:50] because we don't get every day like that
[41:53] on a wednesday night the lord visited us
[41:56] and we begin to get blessed can you say
[41:58] amen and the anointing of the word my we
[42:01] ought to say thank you lord for this
[42:02] wednesday night thank you for blessing
[42:04] me he said he would give us times of
[42:07] refreshing and you tell me in here
[42:09] tonight who doesn't need times of
[42:11] refreshing in the day we live in every
[42:13] one of you need a time of refreshing and
[42:16] the more that we can have the better can
[42:18] you say amen
[42:20] he's given us a time of refreshing
[42:22] tonight and we ought to thank god for it
[42:24] but i'll tell you when you're sitting in
[42:25] the seat of the stormfall like brother
[42:27] branham was and so this is i'm going to
[42:29] elaborate sitting around people who
[42:31] complain
[42:32] being around people who are critical
[42:33] being on the internet with somebody
[42:35] who's constantly critical
[42:37] somebody who mopes all the time somebody
[42:38] who's moping all the time
[42:40] now you might try to encourage a person
[42:42] like that and and uh that's great if you
[42:45] can do that i find with people it's hard
[42:47] to pull them out of that stuff and so
[42:49] you can give all your efforts to it but
[42:51] if they keep staying and they're they're
[42:53] moping then you just say i'm going to
[42:54] pray for you they got to encourage you
[42:56] you got to be careful how much you hang
[42:58] around moping critical people trying to
[43:01] find the fault and everything all the
[43:02] time
[43:04] because we're we're called to be
[43:05] positive
[43:07] we're called to give a positive word
[43:10] we're called to talk about our victories
[43:12] not our defeats can you say amen and i
[43:14] don't mean be phony that we don't have
[43:16] defeats we do but but when david was
[43:19] called before goliath goliath and all
[43:21] the children of israel and saul when he
[43:23] got up in front of him and he gave his
[43:26] testimony he told of his victories with
[43:29] the bear and with the lion he didn't
[43:31] share his defeats he shared his
[43:33] victories
[43:34] at that moment was time to share his
[43:37] victories goliath is not a problem
[43:39] because i've done this through the
[43:41] spirit of the lord i've done this back
[43:43] about five years ago i did this god gave
[43:45] me the victory in this i'm living in
[43:47] victory in this i'm testifying i've got
[43:50] the power to be able to handle goliath
[43:52] and he shared his victories
[43:58] he maybe didn't share the time he ran
[44:00] away from such an animal
[44:02] i don't know so david would have never
[44:04] done that how do you know that
[44:06] he didn't share those times he just
[44:08] shared the time when he wrestled them
[44:11] down
[44:12] and the spirit of the lord came on me
[44:14] and goliath
[44:16] is no
[44:17] big deal
[44:21] so you get around negative people and
[44:22] they're
[44:25] they're really negative and really
[44:26] critical
[44:28] and they're always talking about what's
[44:31] wrong and they're always talking about
[44:34] the hurts of the past and they're always
[44:35] talking about what decisions were made
[44:38] that they disagree with
[44:40] and they always talk about and they and
[44:42] if you hang around negative people who
[44:44] never talk about
[44:45] the kingdom
[44:47] and why we come to church and what god's
[44:50] really doing these souls you never hear
[44:52] it
[44:53] there are people sometimes you never
[44:55] hear from them unless it's a it's a
[44:57] warning or it's a it's a critical thing
[44:59] of something that's going never hear
[45:00] from them otherwise
[45:02] and i'm sitting here as the pastor and
[45:04] if i did that i know about a lot of
[45:06] things that's going on i know negative
[45:08] things are going i know more a lot more
[45:09] than what you think and i know the
[45:11] negative things and the devils defeating
[45:13] people and and sometimes people get
[45:15] bound by things i know some of the
[45:17] private things if people share them with
[45:18] me i'm the one that probably could get
[45:21] down and say
[45:23] is this worth it or not
[45:25] that's right but i can't do that because
[45:28] why i got a whole host of other things
[45:30] that i can pull my thoughts away that
[45:32] and say but look what god's doing
[45:35] look at this new soul that come in look
[45:37] at this brother who's been bound for 20
[45:38] years look at this heart that grew up
[45:41] underneath the wrong thing and now
[45:42] they're coming to life
[45:45] so i just switched my thoughts i could
[45:47] get more down by being critical
[45:50] more than anybody
[45:53] but we can't do it we can't become
[45:55] negative and live in that realm because
[45:57] we can't position ourselves and one of
[45:59] the things is to position yourself
[46:02] sitting sitting sitting with the
[46:05] scornful so the standing one we have the
[46:07] walking one but we have the sitting one
[46:10] which sometimes that's where it's at in
[46:12] a living room at the coffee shop
[46:15] and they're going to come and unload on
[46:17] you
[46:18] they're going to just share their heart
[46:19] in a few things
[46:21] and after about an hour
[46:23] there isn't anything positive there
[46:26] and so then you go and meet with them
[46:28] again six months and it's the same
[46:29] things over and over again
[46:32] and after a while you had to say listen
[46:34] you know i pray that god will help you
[46:36] and i'll encourage you but i
[46:39] you can't sit with this at the seat of
[46:41] the scornful or you'll become critical
[46:46] how many has been there done that
[46:48] there was a preacher one time and he uh
[46:52] he had a lot of trouble he called
[46:53] another preacher and he's always putting
[46:54] his wife down putting his wife down
[46:55] putting his wife down it's all i seem to
[46:57] talk about i could give the name and you
[46:59] probably know it but i wouldn't do that
[47:01] this preacher he's called and so
[47:03] this other preacher who heard him on the
[47:05] phone he'd never done that very much to
[47:07] his wife but he noticed in the next
[47:09] coming weeks he started to do the same
[47:11] thing with his wife he'd never done it
[47:12] before he became real critical of her
[47:15] and putting her down and look how you do
[47:16] that and just laughing sarcastic about
[47:18] her and all this other stuff and he all
[47:20] well once he picked up on it he realized
[47:22] wow it's the influence of this guy who's
[47:24] made it a normal just to put your wife
[47:26] down
[47:27] he said god forgive me call the guy says
[47:29] i realize that's not right i don't want
[47:31] to do that forgive me the things i said
[47:32] about my wife to you i shouldn't have
[47:34] said that and got it on track what was
[47:36] it influence of somebody else bringing
[47:39] in a normal that's not normal
[47:46] people that are negative and critical
[47:48] live that way they're not happy they're
[47:50] not content in the lord
[47:52] they're not thriving
[47:54] but you don't want to become that way
[47:55] yourself
[47:57] and so you don't want to sit in the seat
[47:58] of the scornful complain critical
[48:02] hanging around people that never talk
[48:03] about the kingdom what god's really
[48:05] doing in souls you never hear them talk
[48:06] about what god's doing in their life you
[48:08] never talk about the positive what the
[48:09] words being preached what the word's
[48:11] doing in their life it's all about the
[48:12] administration it's about what church
[48:14] decisions are being made or it's about
[48:16] the voting or it's about pushing their
[48:18] opinions on everybody
[48:20] i respect everybody's opinion but people
[48:22] who live in that realm and you never
[48:24] hear them talk about anything else
[48:25] there's a problem
[48:27] because we're not here from
[48:28] administrations and voting on colors and
[48:31] we're not here for that we're here to
[48:33] have church
[48:34] we're here for souls can you say amen
[48:37] god's blessed us they have some
[48:38] beautiful things but we can have church
[48:40] without any of this i want to tell you
[48:42] that
[48:44] we have governments and administrations
[48:46] and deacons and all these other things
[48:48] to have church order and all that but
[48:49] don't ever let that distract you friends
[48:53] and if you ever have a question about
[48:55] anything
[48:56] the the door is open always ask a
[48:59] question that's fine that's fine but
[49:00] don't become burdened downed and
[49:02] succumbed by church business or by
[49:05] things
[49:06] maybe even in a church you went to
[49:08] before don't just say listen let's go on
[49:10] with god
[49:12] amen work through those things take them
[49:14] to the cross and you have to forgive
[49:17] because sometimes people do you wrong
[49:18] you have to forgive
[49:20] they may not ask for forgiveness but
[49:22] you're you're forgiving from your heart
[49:24] so you can be free
[49:26] you don't forgive because of them you
[49:28] forgive so you can be free
[49:31] and that's hard to do sometimes listen
[49:33] let's not get bogged down
[49:35] by
[49:37] how loud something is
[49:41] it's loud for me sometimes that's
[49:44] another thing i said last sunday when
[49:45] all of you weren't here i told these
[49:47] guys to play as loud as they wanted
[49:50] and they did
[49:52] i wouldn't they know i wouldn't normally
[49:54] say that but like a balance sound and a
[49:56] good sound man like ike's back there to
[49:58] balance it all but we're still working
[50:00] on this building it bounces around and
[50:02] and so we're still a work in progress
[50:04] here so give us grace we're working on
[50:06] it and here i am defending and
[50:08] explaining myself
[50:11] but it's not it's not about that
[50:13] ultimately
[50:14] what are we here for
[50:17] it's not about what we wear it's not
[50:18] about
[50:20] who's hurt me
[50:22] we got to focus on the right thing
[50:24] and brother bran says the bride is
[50:26] always positive
[50:28] we got a positive word we got a positive
[50:30] thing he's doing and i don't mean to
[50:32] pretend that
[50:34] uh that we don't have negative and
[50:36] pretend problems aren't there we should
[50:38] deal with problems
[50:39] that's that's being phony we do have
[50:42] issues we have problems to work through
[50:44] but don't let it get you bogged down and
[50:46] give up
[50:48] is that okay
[50:50] amen
[50:54] that's the people you don't really want
[50:55] to hang around all the time the people
[50:56] that are constantly talking about how
[50:58] who hurt them and people that they don't
[51:00] trust and
[51:02] it's never about the kingdom it's about
[51:03] finding fault all the time the bible
[51:05] said there'll be scoffers in the last
[51:06] days sarcastic
[51:08] about the dresses that you wear sisters
[51:10] sarcastic about your uncut hair
[51:13] sarcastic about the holy life you're
[51:14] trying to live scoffers in the last day
[51:17] so where's the promise of his coming
[51:19] and we don't want to be influenced by
[51:21] that can you say man
[51:23] i i don't want to sit too long in
[51:25] atmospheres that are not positive and
[51:27] you shouldn't either there's a statement
[51:29] if you guys want to put it up i always
[51:30] like this statement
[51:32] great minds
[51:33] discuss ideas
[51:36] average minds discuss events
[51:40] small minds discuss people
[51:45] i read that 30 years ago
[51:49] great minds discuss ideas average minds
[51:51] discuss events small minds discuss
[51:53] people i'd like to take that to a higher
[51:55] level to the message
[51:56] the best minds
[51:58] are submitted to god
[52:01] and they discuss the promises of god
[52:06] coming into those promises in their life
[52:09] that's the great minds
[52:11] not just ideas it's god's promises can
[52:13] you say man
[52:14] let me take it a little higher i'll just
[52:16] blow your mind right now
[52:19] scripture says let this mind be in you
[52:21] which was also in christ jesus there's a
[52:24] mind
[52:25] who thought it not robbery to be equal
[52:27] with god
[52:29] and made himself of no reputation true
[52:32] humility but yet true confidence in his
[52:34] position and he said let that kind of
[52:37] mindset be in you
[52:39] wow i'd like to be thinking about that
[52:40] can you say amen let me blow your mind
[52:42] again look at this quote in christ the
[52:43] mystery look what was once god's great
[52:47] secret
[52:48] everybody's familiar with this what was
[52:49] once god's great secret great mysterious
[52:51] secret in his mind is now put into the
[52:54] hearts of the believer
[52:59] next quote says that's what every
[53:01] genuine believer has to do so separate
[53:03] yourself from these doubters separate
[53:05] yourself from the unbelievers and walk
[53:07] with christ it's life to you and abraham
[53:09] did such a thing and 25 years later we
[53:12] find him still believing the same
[53:13] promise why he had focused his mind to
[53:16] the will of god by the word of god and
[53:19] believed it if we can focus ourself to
[53:22] the plan of god for to what god wants
[53:25] for us and what god promised us and let
[53:28] everything else alone
[53:33] there's that psalms 1 christian
[53:36] separate yourself from these doubters
[53:38] and unbelievers and
[53:40] scorners negative people critical people
[53:44] you'll become that way yourself if you
[53:46] hang around that long enough
[53:48] he says another place but i think today
[53:50] when we see our sisters wearing long
[53:51] hair
[53:53] as the bible said that they should
[53:56] i think it's a nazarite sign that they
[53:58] want to follow the lord
[54:00] and i know that sounds flat and i want
[54:02] it to go home see because it's it looks
[54:04] like somebody is trying to do keep uh
[54:06] something that god told them to do no
[54:08] matter what the price the world has to
[54:10] say about it out there and how many
[54:12] scornful or laughers or critics that
[54:15] doesn't bother a person that's totally
[54:17] separated from the things of the world
[54:19] and to the things of god they'll obey
[54:21] the word and separate themselves from
[54:23] the things of the world because the word
[54:25] separates them i know they stand
[54:27] criticism but if we wasn't criticized
[54:30] then there'd be something wrong the
[54:31] world always knows its own but i've said
[54:34] that remember criticism on account of
[54:36] the word of god is only growing pains of
[54:39] his grace
[54:41] it shows that you have separated
[54:43] yourself when you're getting criticized
[54:45] if you're the one getting criticized it
[54:47] shows that you've separated yourself it
[54:50] shows you're living in another world
[54:51] another kingdom
[54:53] and when you it shows that you've been
[54:55] separated to be a christian to act like
[54:57] one to live like one to obey the
[54:58] commandment of god and it's a nazareth
[55:00] vow to separate to call from god that
[55:03] separates you from the things of the
[55:04] world i believe tonight that every man
[55:06] and woman every boy and girl that's born
[55:08] of the spirit of god is a nazarite unto
[55:10] the lord because they have separated
[55:12] them things themselves from the cares of
[55:15] the world and whatever the world has got
[55:18] to say
[55:20] praise the lord
[55:22] amen amen
[55:25] don't sit in the seat of the scornful
[55:28] don't stand in the way of sinners
[55:32] don't walk in the counsel of the ungodly
[55:35] pull yourself away from that
[55:38] be polite be courteous okay
[55:40] because we have to be a witness in
[55:42] testimony but there's certain influence
[55:44] you just pull away from because why you
[55:45] want to position yourself which goes to
[55:48] the next scripture we'll
[55:50] maybe take it up sunday morning i want
[55:52] to elaborate on this
[55:54] where this man's delight is then because
[55:56] if you pull yourself away with you know
[55:58] that's the thing about loneliness
[55:59] sometimes
[56:00] if you pull yourself away which a lot of
[56:03] people don't do that but when you pull
[56:04] yourself away we're human beings you
[56:07] have to fill it with something else
[56:10] and i find a lot of times you go through
[56:12] that signification somebody pull
[56:13] themselves away from all this stuff but
[56:16] you don't feed it with the word of god
[56:18] and good fellowship and develop some
[56:20] other friends you're going to feel
[56:21] pretty lonely there
[56:23] you're going to get depleted
[56:25] and you might turn back to some of those
[56:26] things but when you pull away you got to
[56:28] fill it and that's what this guy did his
[56:30] delight became the law of the lord
[56:33] his delight became the law of the lord
[56:35] and he meditated day and night so i want
[56:37] to talk deeper about our thought life
[56:40] because that's what we have control over
[56:42] what's in your thought life mind is
[56:45] really who you are and that's what's
[56:47] really going on
[56:49] can't deny it that's what's really going
[56:52] on and even a christian for many years
[56:55] can be
[56:56] locked up in their thought life
[56:59] and if they could get victory there i
[57:01] believe they can have victory other
[57:03] places
[57:04] the whole time they're just out here
[57:06] they're worshiping maybe doing
[57:07] everything and they're bound right here
[57:09] something's kind of stuck they're
[57:10] obsessed with something and it's just
[57:12] like they're they're stopped right there
[57:15] never move sometimes for years never
[57:16] move from that thought
[57:19] and paul says casting down imagination
[57:23] and every thought that lifts itself
[57:26] above the knowledge of god so we must
[57:28] have the power to cast down binding
[57:31] thoughts
[57:32] that's lifted itself above you see that
[57:34] we're going to have other thoughts but
[57:36] when it lifts itself to be the dominant
[57:39] thought
[57:40] above
[57:43] christ
[57:44] above your victory in christ that's when
[57:46] it becomes wrong you might have thoughts
[57:48] come to you but it becomes the dominant
[57:50] thing that binds you and christ is down
[57:52] here
[57:53] think about him down here but he says
[57:55] cast down every thought that lifts
[57:58] itself above the knowledge of christ
[58:00] so i might get the thoughts and down
[58:02] here
[58:03] but they're not allowed to go very far
[58:05] because you're but because this guy he's
[58:08] uh obsessed with he is obsessed with
[58:10] something
[58:11] i meditate day and night in the law of
[58:13] the lord that's why i gave you the
[58:14] devotionals you don't have to use that
[58:16] let's stay in the word of god this year
[58:19] spend a little time in the word of god
[58:20] here grab that thought for the day and
[58:22] say man i'm going to think about that
[58:23] and when satan brings you into something
[58:25] else i'm going right back to that
[58:26] thought let me dwell on it controlling
[58:28] your thought life so let's talk about
[58:30] that the lord willing sunday and let's
[58:32] uh let's spend some time more time in
[58:34] the word and we'll let you go home
[58:36] tonight someone said that i was sunday
[58:38] afternoon we were supposed to talk about
[58:40] goals
[58:41] a little bit and we got cheated out of
[58:42] that
[58:44] but i'm going to take two minutes here
[58:46] and you can just close that as the
[58:47] service there and i just want to say
[58:50] it's not rocket science people are
[58:51] asking
