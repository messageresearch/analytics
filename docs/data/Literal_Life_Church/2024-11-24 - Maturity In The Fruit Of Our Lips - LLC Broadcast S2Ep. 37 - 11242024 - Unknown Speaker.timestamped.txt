[5:00] 3 and verse
[5:02] 1 my brethren be not many Masters
[5:05] knowing that we shall receive the
[5:07] greater condemnation in other words um
[5:10] maybe you shouldn't want to be a teacher
[5:12] because teachers who have to stand in
[5:14] front of the people uh are under greater
[5:17] scrutiny sometimes so we have to watch
[5:19] what they say a little closer then he
[5:21] goes into a subject on the tongue for in
[5:24] many things we offend all If any man
[5:26] offend not in word the same as a perfect
[5:28] man and able also to Bridle the whole
[5:31] body behold we put bits in the H's
[5:34] mouths that we may that they may obey us
[5:36] and we turn about their whole body
[5:38] beheld also the ships which though they
[5:40] be so great are driven of fierce winds
[5:43] yet are they turned about with a very
[5:45] small Helm withs soever the governor
[5:48] listeth even so the tongue is a little
[5:50] member and boasteth great things behold
[5:53] how great a matter a little fire
[5:56] kindleth and the tongue is a fire a
[5:59] world of of iniquity so is the tongue
[6:01] among our members that it defileth the
[6:03] whole body and sth on fire the course of
[6:06] Nature and is set on fire of hell for
[6:10] every king of beast excuse me every kind
[6:13] of Beast and of birds and of serpents
[6:15] and of things in the sea is tamed and
[6:18] hath been tamed of mankind but the
[6:20] tongue can no man tame it is an unruly
[6:24] evil full of deadly poison and you guys
[6:27] think I'm a hard preacher Jam is pretty
[6:30] straight on your tongue therefore bless
[6:32] we God even the father and therewith
[6:35] curse we men with the same tongue bless
[6:38] God and curse men which are made after
[6:41] the similitude of God out of the same
[6:44] mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my
[6:46] brethren these things ought not so to be
[6:50] do a fountain send forth at the same
[6:52] place Sweet Water and bitter can a fig
[6:55] tree my brethren bear Olive bear berries
[6:58] either a Vine fig
[7:00] so can no Fountain both yield saltwater
[7:03] and fresh who is a wise man and endued
[7:06] with knowledge among you let him show
[7:08] out of a good conversation his works
[7:12] with meekness of
[7:14] wisdom Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 15
[7:18] one verse there uh to catch and bring
[7:21] into the subject this morning for a
[7:23] little bit Hebrews chap 13 and verse 15
[7:27] by him
[7:29] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[7:32] praise to God continually that is the
[7:35] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[7:39] name it's a good Thanksgiving scripture
[7:42] the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
[7:44] his name but to do good and to
[7:47] communicate forget not for with such
[7:50] sacrifices God is well pleased we
[7:54] believe that God is looking for more and
[7:57] more from Sons and Daughters of God that
[7:59] we are saved and it's a gift of
[8:01] Salvation God gives us the gift of
[8:03] Salvation he gives us the gift of the
[8:05] Holy Ghost they are free gifts can you
[8:08] say Amen you don't have to do any Works
[8:10] to attain that God gives it to you when
[8:12] you ask him but then after he gives you
[8:15] that then we want to grow to please the
[8:17] Lord more if we're doing anything to
[8:19] grieve him then we want to stop doing
[8:22] the things that grieve him and do more
[8:24] and more things that please the Lord is
[8:27] that okay with everybody and so now now
[8:29] when we when when we become God's
[8:31] looking for more and more sunship or
[8:34] maturity and I believe that the word
[8:37] that we're under in the last days that
[8:39] God has blessed us with he has blessed
[8:41] us with an open book The Bible has
[8:43] become open to us the book of redemption
[8:46] has become open to us in Revelations 5
[8:49] the lamb took the book and he took the
[8:52] seals off the book that means he has
[8:54] given us something that's not closed but
[8:57] it's open to us and now that we have
[9:00] been given that it says when he come
[9:02] with the open book it says when he was
[9:04] holding the book he hath made us Kings
[9:08] and
[9:11] Priests it's taking us somewhere the
[9:14] Holy Ghost is taking somewhere the the
[9:16] book being open the seals taken off of
[9:18] our Bibles it's taking the people
[9:21] somewhere thou H has made us Kings and
[9:24] Priests he's making you something guess
[9:28] what both of those positions of Kings
[9:30] and Priests require
[9:35] maturity how terrible would it be to put
[9:37] a king in that's immature we're in
[9:39] trouble character is needed to serve in
[9:42] these positions as God moves Us in then
[9:45] positions us with the open book then
[9:47] character maturity is needed in these
[9:50] positions how do we get character how do
[9:52] we get maturity through our trials
[9:54] through what God takes us through that
[9:56] through our trials we stopped acting
[9:58] like babies and saying God I don't want
[10:00] any more trials I don't want to go
[10:02] through anything else I just want life
[10:04] to be cushiony put a cushion around me
[10:06] and when I bump and like that I got a
[10:08] cushion all around me and God says no
[10:10] I'm trying to grow you as a son I'm
[10:12] trying to child train you here I'm
[10:14] trying to discipline you so that you
[10:16] grow up and you can stand on your own
[10:19] can you say Amen said I'm going to be a
[10:21] defeat to the devil today I'm going to
[10:24] overcome I'm going to hold the power and
[10:27] authority within my hands but I'm going
[10:29] to hold hold it with maturity Israel had
[10:31] a history of immaturities for 40 years
[10:34] in the wilderness uh the Bible says in
[10:37] Hebrews that God was not well pleased
[10:39] and God was grieved with an entire
[10:42] generation and so in 1 Corinthians 10 it
[10:45] gives some of these Grievances and gives
[10:46] some of this stuff here's the people
[10:48] that were under the message in that day
[10:50] under Moses message here's how they were
[10:52] first Corinthians 10 and: 10 you guys
[10:54] can put it up if you want moreover
[10:56] Brethren I would not that you should be
[10:58] ignorant how that our fathers were under
[11:00] the cloud and all passed through the sea
[11:03] and were all baptized into Moses in the
[11:05] cloud and the Sea and did all eat the
[11:08] same spiritual meat and did all drink
[11:10] the same spiritual drink for they drank
[11:12] of that spiritual rock that was followed
[11:14] them and that rock was Christ but with
[11:17] many of them God was not well pleased
[11:19] for they were overthrown in the
[11:20] wilderness now these things were our
[11:22] examples to the intent we should not
[11:24] lust after evil things as they also
[11:26] lusted neither be idolators as were some
[11:30] of them as it is written the people sat
[11:32] down and to eat and drink and Rose up to
[11:34] play neither let us commit fornication
[11:37] as some of them committed and fell in
[11:39] one day three and three we're we're
[11:41] reading the history of messaged
[11:48] Believers and the Bible doesn't hide
[11:51] anything lot of you have lot of you have
[11:53] trouble saying amen this is the history
[11:55] of 40 Years of God's people under a
[11:58] prophet and you got idolatry you got
[12:02] fornication uh let's read a little
[12:04] further neither let us tempt Christ as
[12:06] some of them tempted and were destroyed
[12:08] as serpents how did they tempt the Lord
[12:10] they were saying is the Lord among us or
[12:13] not they were questioning whether the
[12:14] Lord was even among them even though he
[12:16] opened up the Red Sea even though he
[12:18] gave them Mana when they were hungry
[12:20] even though they gave them a spiritual
[12:21] Rock when they were thirsty he did
[12:23] Miracle after miracle and they still
[12:24] come up to tempt the Lord saying but
[12:27] really is the Lord really among us or
[12:30] not tempting the
[12:33] Lord
[12:35] immaturity do you say that when you hit
[12:37] a trial that you don't think was fair to
[12:39] you is God really in my life or not why
[12:43] is God doing this why is God allowing
[12:46] this it's
[12:48] immaturity because whatever God allows
[12:50] in my life is going to be for my good
[12:53] verse 10 neither murmur ye as some also
[12:56] murmured I know nobody ever doeses that
[12:58] here here neither murmur me as some of
[13:01] them murmured and were destroyed of the
[13:02] Destroyer now all these things happen
[13:04] for our examples and they're written for
[13:06] our admonition that's a slight rebuke
[13:08] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[13:09] wherefore let him that thinketh he stand
[13:12] take heed lest he fall when you think
[13:15] you stand take heed lest you fall by
[13:18] these things because you're not strong
[13:20] within yourself you're only strong when
[13:22] you let the Holy Ghost take over your
[13:25] life can I get a further amen You're Not
[13:28] Strong you will fall to the same things
[13:31] and the same immaturities unless you let
[13:34] the Holy Ghost take over your life so
[13:37] all of this history of Israel under the
[13:39] prophet's message it's not good they're
[13:41] gossiping in their tents they're
[13:43] murmuring they're complaining against
[13:44] Moses they're backbiting they're they're
[13:48] uh disrespectful to God's Prophet
[13:49] they're allowed to say anything against
[13:51] God's prophet and get by with it and so
[13:53] they're babies in the wilderness under
[13:55] God's Prophet babies in the wilderness
[13:57] under God's prophet and so I'll just
[13:59] give you two examples I could go into
[14:01] many of them but there's two examples
[14:03] one in the Old Testament one in the New
[14:05] Testament and both of these people were
[14:07] under the ministry of the son of man one
[14:09] in the Old Testament one in the New
[14:11] Testament they had seen Mighty things
[14:13] that God had done they had watch the son
[14:15] of man in action discern Hearts do all
[14:18] of that do Miracles that that that are
[14:21] amazing amazing and they watched it all
[14:25] under the son of man prophetic Ministry
[14:27] and yet we see a lot of immaturities in
[14:30] their life one example is that when and
[14:33] that's mentioned here in the scripture
[14:34] that I read here in 1 Corinthians 10 it
[14:37] talks about them uh they come across the
[14:40] sea they come across the Red Sea so now
[14:43] I was reading a few weeks ago would you
[14:44] get with me Psalms 106 I was reading
[14:46] this in my devotion and here in 106
[14:49] gives the entire history of Israel a lot
[14:52] of things I just read and David is being
[14:55] very repentant saying look what our
[14:56] fathers did look what the you know look
[14:59] look at the some of the things that they
[15:00] did but right in the middle of this God
[15:03] gives what he did verse 9 he rebuked the
[15:05] Red Sea I'm inan Psalms 106 ver9 he
[15:09] rebuked the Red Sea also and it was
[15:10] dried up so he led them through the
[15:12] depths as through the
[15:15] Wilderness and he saved them from the
[15:17] hand of him that hated them and redeemed
[15:19] them from the hand of the enemy they
[15:21] stood there and watched all of Pharaoh's
[15:23] Army be drowned in the Red Sea they
[15:25] walked across on dry land on the Red Sea
[15:29] a
[15:31] miracle and the waters covered their
[15:33] enemies that there was not one of them
[15:35] left not one enemy left how many believe
[15:38] that God's powerful enough to put all
[15:40] your enemies in the Red Sea all your
[15:42] habits all your addictions pornography
[15:45] what it whatever it is he's able to
[15:47] drown all of it in the Red
[15:50] Sea verse 12 then then believe they his
[15:54] words and they sang his praise so I
[15:58] thought well praise the Lord and I've
[16:00] heard so many sermons The Last 5 Years
[16:03] on this part of the children of Israel
[16:05] where Mariam sees the Red Sea and all
[16:08] the enemy there and miam picks up the
[16:11] tambourine do I have a tambourine here
[16:13] or they always hide them from me because
[16:15] they don't think I can play it you
[16:19] have are you sister
[16:22] Mariam Viola Viola that's that's good
[16:25] enough that's close
[16:27] enough I I hear so many sermons and I
[16:30] love to hear it because listen when God
[16:32] drowns your troubles in the Red Sea and
[16:34] your enemy you're going to be happy
[16:36] about it you're going to shout about it
[16:37] you're going to Rejoice about it and
[16:40] that's what they did they said they
[16:41] believe because they weren't believing
[16:43] for the all the years before all the
[16:45] Miracles they weren't really believing
[16:47] but now this happens and they're
[16:48] believing and they're praising God
[16:50] Mariam gets her tamarine and all the El
[16:53] the daughters grabbed their Tamarin and
[16:55] she had the whole church all revived as
[16:58] they watched all the bones and all the
[17:01] the uh the the Pharaoh's Army bobbing up
[17:04] and down in the Red Sea
[17:06] J Mary says let's worship together come
[17:10] on everybody I will sing unto the Lord
[17:14] for he has triumphed gloriously the
[17:17] horse and the rider get thrown into the
[17:21] sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has
[17:25] triumphed gloriously the horse of the r
[17:29] get thrown into the
[17:31] sea woo glory be to
[17:36] God see I can play it they don't think I
[17:38] can play it around here but I can they
[17:40] hide all the tambourines and you can
[17:42] play thank you appreciate
[17:45] it it was a time and I hear so many
[17:48] sermons on it but guess what I hear
[17:51] hardly any sermons of this
[17:54] people how they acted the other side of
[17:57] the Red Sea
[17:59] right
[18:01] and how they were acting just 3 days
[18:05] later after they
[18:09] shouted and it says it in Psalms it says
[18:12] then believe they his words they sang
[18:14] his praise they soon forgot his Works
[18:18] they waited not for his counsel
[18:22] immaturity I tell you friends you can
[18:24] even enjoy the word today and celebrate
[18:27] and feel better with your leave but I
[18:29] don't care how you act in here you can
[18:32] shout you can dance and I I would love
[18:34] for some of you to do it sometimes but
[18:37] it's not what you act like in here it's
[18:40] what you act like in obedience to the
[18:42] word when you leave these
[18:45] doors and they go back and they said but
[18:48] then they lusted exceedingly in the
[18:49] wilderness and tempted God in the
[18:51] wilderness he gave them the requests but
[18:53] sent leanness to their soul they envied
[18:55] Moses it goes on and on so one little
[18:58] verse says they shouted but before the
[19:01] Red Sea they were complaining they were
[19:03] saying we're stuck you brought us out
[19:06] here's our Pharaoh's Army coming what
[19:08] are we going to do and even Moses the
[19:10] prophet is complaining and crying unto
[19:12] the Lord what are we going to do and
[19:15] Moses is complaining and God says why
[19:17] are you crying I've given you commission
[19:19] I've said you're going to make it you're
[19:21] going over I don't care if a red sea is
[19:23] there I don't care if the Mediterranean
[19:25] Sea is after that I don't care if the
[19:27] Atlantic oost is after that I have
[19:29] commissioned you you're going to make it
[19:32] you're going to
[19:35] overcome why are you
[19:38] crying because of immaturity grow up as
[19:41] a Son of God stop crying and speak and
[19:45] go forward and Moses said all right he
[19:48] stood up into his position and he says
[19:50] raised his hands and M you watch the
[19:52] movie and everything else God opens up
[19:55] by his command opens up the Red Sea
[19:58] but that's how they were acting before
[20:00] this side of the Red Sea then they get
[20:02] done and read just three one excuse me
[20:06] six verses later after they shouted with
[20:09] their
[20:11] tambourine they ran out of water and
[20:14] they begin to
[20:15] complain that they didn't have any
[20:19] water wow three days three days I
[20:22] believe it was three days now you can
[20:25] put this off in the Old Testament all
[20:26] you want to but this reflects the IM
[20:29] immaturities that come out of our Lives
[20:30] Many Times what do we talk about on
[20:35] Monday what do we talk about when we're
[20:38] depressed what do we talk about when we
[20:41] don't feel God
[20:43] around I don't feel God like I felt him
[20:46] on Sunday so now you start to say
[20:49] anything which is going to be my theme
[20:50] today for a very short time there's two
[20:53] main immaturities that I think were in
[20:54] Israel and that are in the church
[20:56] sometimes the two immaturities let your
[20:59] giving yourself permission to think any
[21:01] thought that you want to think at any
[21:04] time and second of all giving yourself
[21:07] permission to say anything you want at
[21:10] any time there's a lot of scriptures
[21:12] that does not give sons of God a
[21:14] permission to spill out anything out of
[21:17] these tongues that they want to say well
[21:20] I'm an American I have a right to say
[21:22] what I want to say it's free speech
[21:24] you're not an American you're a
[21:26] Christian you're a son of God and sons
[21:29] of God in are a different Kingdom than
[21:32] Americans thanks God we are and we do
[21:35] not give ourselves permission but this
[21:37] is Israel they gave their themselves
[21:39] permission especially in their tents in
[21:42] their homes to say anything they wanted
[21:44] to say to think anything they wanted to
[21:47] think and you've heard me preach about
[21:49] the Mind our thinking process growing in
[21:51] our thinking bringing every thought
[21:53] captive to the Lord every thought has to
[21:56] be scanned by the word of God and if
[21:59] it's not a thought of God you can't give
[22:01] yourself permission to think it whether
[22:03] it's depressing whether it's criticism
[22:05] to someone else whether it's a doubtful
[22:07] thought towards the word of God it
[22:09] should not be allowed in your thinking
[22:11] to go any further than one thought and
[22:13] it is got captive it the handcuffs are
[22:16] put on that thought and said you are not
[22:19] coming into my thought
[22:22] life you know why we give ourselves
[22:24] permission to do it because nobody sees
[22:26] our thought life
[22:28] and should I take an hour and preach on
[22:31] what you let and what you feed on
[22:32] influence your thought life social media
[22:36] movies you think the way you do because
[22:38] of what you feed on an example in the
[22:40] New Testament is Luke 9ine where Jesus
[22:44] has his adoption ceremony and and he's
[22:48] Peter James and John are invited and
[22:50] they're up there and Moses and Elijah up
[22:52] here and so here they all are and uh
[22:56] they fall asleep first of all you know
[22:58] this a pretty big event and uh Peter and
[23:03] James they fall asleep it's pretty big
[23:04] event it's Jesus adoption something's
[23:06] going to happen in the mountain and they
[23:08] were exclusively invited to this and the
[23:11] Bible says they were asleep so they had
[23:12] to be woke up and when they wake up they
[23:15] see Jesus face transfigured in front of
[23:17] them which means he's receiving the
[23:21] approval of God the father and the
[23:23] approval that this is my son I'm pleased
[23:26] to dwell in him there was a radiance
[23:28] they're sleeping they want to build
[23:30] three Tabernacles then they come down
[23:32] out of the mountain and it's about just
[23:35] two days I think such an experience up
[23:38] there seeing Jesus transfigured and they
[23:40] had a little discussion amongst the
[23:41] disciples who's the greatest Among
[23:46] Us they just come from an adoption
[23:49] ceremony where they're supposed to come
[23:51] and they're they're arguing amongst one
[23:54] another who's the greatest among all the
[23:58] the disciples have you guys ever thought
[24:00] about we haven't really decided who
[24:01] takes go over after he's gone then they
[24:05] get done arguing and so you know what
[24:07] happens is is that Jesus answered their
[24:10] he come up to their discussion about
[24:11] who's the greatest among them and he he
[24:14] said let me tell you who's the greatest
[24:16] Among Us he takes a little child sets
[24:19] him in front of the disciples and he
[24:21] says big
[24:25] preachers this is the greatest in the
[24:27] Kingdom of Heaven
[24:30] if you get your heart like this child in
[24:31] the S because we're to be children in
[24:33] our hearts as far as our response to God
[24:36] adults as far as our power With the
[24:38] Enemy but this is how you receive and
[24:41] this is the greatest in the kingdom and
[24:42] then then just a few hours later Jesus
[24:44] said go into that Village and prepare
[24:46] for the Passover go into that and it was
[24:47] in the Samaritans they go in and they
[24:50] say we won't receive
[24:52] you you can't do it here okay you're
[24:55] Jews we're Samaritans you can't set it
[24:56] up here and you know what they did these
[24:59] guys don't know that we have the son of
[25:02] man here we have the son of man these
[25:04] guys don't know who we are and they have
[25:06] just respected you Lord and they have
[25:07] not received us they have shut the doors
[25:09] to us John said would to God that we
[25:12] call fire down from heaven like Elijah
[25:14] did and just consume the whole Community
[25:16] some immaturities
[25:18] there that's an
[25:20] understatement these are guys following
[25:22] the son of man right next to him every
[25:24] day and somehow gets in this thing is
[25:27] that let's call on on that the same
[25:29] power of Elijah we must have it let's
[25:31] call fire down and blow the whole thing
[25:33] up just because they wouldn't receive us
[25:36] I tell you friends there's a lot more to
[25:37] be said about this but we better ask the
[25:40] Holy Spirit to burn out our bad
[25:41] attitudes you may have truth but you
[25:43] better have character with your truth
[25:45] you may have truth but you better not
[25:47] use that sword on other people you may
[25:50] have truth but I can tell you
[25:51] unbelievers pick up on if it's Pride
[25:53] with your truth and it's not attractive
[25:55] for them to see religious Pride with the
[25:57] truth that you have
[25:59] we don't have a monopoly on truth you
[26:01] don't personally can you say amen God is
[26:03] interested in every human being on the
[26:05] face of the
[26:07] Earth if he had that attitude why don't
[26:10] we have that attitude why are we
[26:12] exclusive Jesus responded and said John
[26:16] and
[26:18] James you don't even know what Spirit
[26:21] you're of right now and that wasn't the
[26:23] end of the rebuke you don't even know
[26:24] what Spirit you got on you let me tell
[26:27] you this
[26:28] you need to know something this son of
[26:31] man Ministry did not come to destroy
[26:34] men's
[26:35] lives it came to save men's lives the
[26:39] perfect man is not sinless Perfection
[26:40] but he is on his way and he's he's well
[26:43] on his way to Growing Up when his tongue
[26:45] is bridled by the Holy Ghost the same as
[26:47] a perfect man he may have SI weaknesses
[26:50] in other areas but he brings that ton
[26:52] control the rest of the body will come
