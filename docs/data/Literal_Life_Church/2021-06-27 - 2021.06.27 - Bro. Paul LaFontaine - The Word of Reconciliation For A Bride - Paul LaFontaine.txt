TRANSCRIPT
========================================
section of scripture the last few weeks and we would like to read from it again second corinthians chapter 5 and verse 19 and verse 20. second corinthians 5 verse 19 and verse 20 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the word the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation everybody saved the word of reconciliation [Music] the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be ye reconciled to god so if you i'll bring you back to the theme here and that is god was in christ so there was a vessel on earth and through that vessel god was calling and reconciling his children to himself and then when christ finished his work and resurrected and sent back the holy spirit then paul's putting them himself in the place in christ's stead now that the work of reconciliation is going on but it's going on through paul and he's preaching and he says i have this ministry of reconciliation you have it and it's called the word of reconciliation reconciliation in other words the word that i'm preaching is not just a sermon it's the father calling his children can you say amen it's the father calling his children it's the father being reconciled with his children again so that's what's happening and we want to speak today a little bit on the word of reconciliation for the bride heavenly father we just pray that you'll bless this word and lord the two songs that were sung and the worship that today has been such a joy in our hearts and lord good music anointed of you has the power to drive away evil spirits it has the power to refresh our spirits like when david came before saul and his spirit was refreshed lord we're thankful for that and the two songs we heard has already preached a sermon to us as it were and so we're rejoicing in that father we pray that you'll just get in your word now and minister to your people and father we're thankful that you have just pray brought all these precious visitors with us today and we pray you'll bless them give them traveling mercies lord on their trips and we just commit the whole day to you we're thankful we want to say thank you lord for your anointing coming down last night lord in such a special way brother rap speaking there lord and we know your presence just come lord and made yourself known in front of those children lord may it never get away from them lord that that different feeling that they felt when you come in the room lord and there's just something special may never leave them i pray god may they be drawn to you whether wherever they went today whatever situations they're in parents and different things may it just draw their hearts lord and find them one day and bring them back to you we just commit them to you all those lives precious to you lord and we commit the day to you now in jesus name amen god bless you once you shake somebody's hand just before you seated say god bless you and once again thank you for all the visitors that are here with us today i haven't even mentioned all of them but melodies in with the children and so many that grew up in our church that come back for kids days and such are just glad to have you you were in kids days yourself and then you bring back come back 10 20 years later with all of your kids the kids days so just families are growing amen and uh jared and betsy aren't here today but they have a new baby a new baby boy and so we're happy for what the lord has done for them amen so we want to uh just take a few moments this morning and speak on this subject again of reconciliation and um paul is standing with a word uh that is is not just to save people and not just to forgive people although it's a wonderful thing to know that when the word is preached then we realize it draws the people to repentance and if they'll repent then god can save that person salvation is a wonderful gift and we're thankful for that and when the word is preached and somebody responds there's repentance and then there's forgiveness but paul is preaching the ministry of reconciliation and he says we have the word of reconciliation what paul preached was more than just to bring someone to be saved but it was a complete restoration bringing sons and daughters of god back where they fell from before they fell in the garden in the garden man had a an unhindered relationship with the lord he'd come down in the cool of the evening there was no sin there was no hesitance there was no adam and eve feeling unworthy there was no hesitation it was complete comfortable peace and fellowship with the lord he'd come down they could speak to him openly about anything he could speak back to them and there was this unhindered oneness and unity with the with the father and his children there in the garden of eden but when sin came in that was all broke away and man become distant man become way far away uh uh and there was a chasm between them and god there wasn't grounds for that type of fellowship but i'm here to proclaim this morning that calvary has restored fellowship between sons again and the word of reconciliation is not just to save us when god gives us this word is to bring all that we lost from god and bring us back into a position in fellowship with god when god gives you his word it's not to bring you halfway god doesn't do anything halfway god does not save you to lose you god does not save you to say oh i made a mistake god does not draw you in in order for somehow you just to bring you halfway if you go halfway it's not god's fault it would be your fault that you only come halfway god's word is bringing you back to a complete reconciliation that there's unhindered fellowship with you and god and i want to talk about this morning several things that are related to that and hopefully one of the things maybe we'll minister to you and bring you along in your christian journey the word is not to take you so far but it's to bring you back completely into a relationship with christ that adam and eve had lost in the garden before the fall and fellowshipping with brother johnny green a little bit yesterday or uh friday we were just talking about this new generation and uh just the the new generation of ministers coming along and i stand amazed and he would say he stand amazed at at just where we're going and where this word is taking the people and we're rejoicing in the the quality of the brothers the purity and the untainted way that they're bringing the the bible and the message it's just been astounding to watch the new ministry rising up and it gives us great confidence to know that the future is bright can you say amen that god knows where the bride is at he knows what to speak to his bride and if we have several years before the rapture we don't know that we got confidence that if i'm out of the way someday god's word is going to take the people beyond and further even than where we're at today and i mentioned to him a quote you know uh if you guys want to bring it up in the back there it's in what is the holy ghost i mentioned to brother johnny this quote and i was saying to him we see things advancing and it's because of the nature of the kind of word through the message that we're under it's not the kind of word that is given that just fizzles out it's not a word that becomes a denomination it's not a word that just goes in a revival and after 450 years it fizzles out somewhere this is not that kind of word this is a word that keeps advancing and advancing and advancing and taking us beyond what we were last year beyond what we were 10 years ago it's just short quote but brother branham says it this way i love this quote especially speaking to youth conventions and such that we do luther walked in one light wesley walked in another well excuse me wesley walked in one light pentecost walked in another but we're walking on higher than that today this is 1959 we're walking in a higher light than pentecost and if there's another generation it'll go beyond us [Applause] praise the lord that shows us that there's a word that's never ending to take us on further can you say amen i quoted something to brother johnny that brother eugene braun said to me he says i'm training my young men and mentoring my young man the ministers and all the young men that someday they can take the people with their gift and the word they can take the people further when i'm gone than what i could take them they can take them further i've never heard a minister say that a lot of times older ministers it stops with them it's over with me they hold on to the congregation hold on it's all about me that's not this type of word when i'm when i kick the bucket someday and we're still here this word will take this congregation and this bride on to know him in a greater way because of the blessing of how powerful this word of reconciliation really is if i could just preach that and get you to see it do you realize the magnitude of the kind of word that we're under this isn't just church this isn't a denomination we have been given the word of reconciliation and it'll bring back every son and daughter of god back to their position as sons again blessed be his name so we have a word that is to bring souls back into fellowship to god's thoughts of them and when he says we have this ministry of reconciliation be reconciled to god we have a word of reconciliation it's not just to bring people so that they'll be saved and that's still going on and we will always see that go on but it's actually a word to bring them further than salvation and to bring them back into fellowship with the thoughts that god had about them before the foundation of the world do you realize this morning that we've through this word tapped into the very thoughts god had before the foundation of the world god's thoughts that he had of you that we have been able to tap into what god was thinking of you before the foundation of the law first of all you were in god's thoughts before the foundation of the world that's a blessing in itself if you're a christian you were in his thoughts but what thoughts did he have of you what was he thinking of you what purpose did he have in this age for you god's already thought it through yes sir god already knew and to think that the word that i preached and that's been bought brought through the message can tap sons of god into the very thoughts that god had for them that's pretty powerful not preaching a sermon and we're just bringing the people just so far along no it's deeper than that it's much deeper than that and that's why we said last sunday to reconcile and i heard a minister teach this a few years ago his brother tim dodd who did even teaching at the men's meeting and i may refer a little bit to that i was looking over my notes yesterday i may refer to it because it was so powerful i never knew this but reconciling and he read this scripture to the word of reconciliation reconcile is a deeper uh relationship or a coming back it's deeper than repentance and it's deeper than forgiveness i thought about that that's amazing because god's blessed us with forgiveness and when we repent well we can't even repent until we're led to repent it's god that leads you to repentance he leads you to repentance then he forgives you and all these things are great things that we enjoy but reconcile when he says the word of reconciliation is to go deeper than just being forgiven because somebody can repent somebody can say i'm sorry and somebody can be forgiven but the relationship isn't restored yet how many is that okay let's how many had that happened in your life when there's a sorry done but there's no reconciliation of the relationship the worst case of it when we're raising kids and one sibling does something to the other and you make them go say sorry because you're trying to tell you're trying to teach them to say sorry and to repent of what they'd done wrong you just went over and bashed your brother's head or you tripped them and they fell down and so you need to go say sorry well they don't want to do it there's nothing in their heart to go say sorry so you're teaching them so it's all mechanical but you're trying to teach them anyway how many has ever had those emotionless cold sorries from your kids and you want so much to get it from their heart but you're teaching so it's all mechanical it's all in the head and the last thing they want to do my mom made me do that one time my mom's here today and i did something wrong to sharon and we were fighting and bickering back and forth i know you'd never believe that sharon my my sister and i but uh we still still do it every now and then but anyway we we had a big fight and mom did did not tolerate fighting and treating one another wrong because she came from a home and i don't know i'm sure she don't mind me saying this but she came for a home with a lot of fussing a lot of stewing a lot of treating each other bad and and fighting and things she can't see that she had no tolerance for it so the things that she disciplined us with when there was just fussing going on and treating what i mean we don't want to talk about it i mean she really got into it but one day i remember distinctly she must have got tired of the i'm sorry and she made me kiss my sister on her cheek i mean she's going to extreme measures because there is no brother that is gonna kiss his sister you talk about the grossest thing you could ever come up with awkward more than awkward just gross mom i'll kiss you but not my sister but it's these extreme measures to get the point across and it worked because you realize but you see these motionless cold things and then when you get it from adults it's even sad can you it's even more sad because it's i'm sorry so you tell you say sorry to her stay sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry well that's real sincere i'm sorry we know it's got to be deeper than that but then when someone comes to the lord or someone comes in a repentance you can repent but there's not a reconciliation of the position and the relationship again and this word has the power in it not just to bring you to repentance and god forgiving you that this message is so much more than that matter of fact i'll just say safely the almost the entire church world in christianity can only bring people to that certain thing billy graham was gifted at it he could bring that audience a whole stadium to a sincere repentance in god and i thank god for it and i would never ditch that and say it's wrong it's wonderful we need repentance we need holy spirit repentance and forgiveness but this word is not just to get you to repent and then you just go on living life without a relationship with the lord this is the power to bring you back into the position you fell from and that's unhindered fellowship with the father reconciliation is a a stronger word than forgiveness or repentance not to minimize these things we have to have repentance and forgiveness to have a start to relationships to get back in relationship but it only goes so far far the church world may preach parts of the word and they led to repentance and forgiveness and it's wonderful but but but there's more to it than this this is a complete work to bring sons back to glory this is a positioning message this is an adoption message and if you understand adoption that's not just that you're birthed into the kingdom but you come to your position as a son that you're trusted by the father this is a word of reconciliation this is a message of adoption and position you're under that this is the opening of the book of redemption amen and thus if it's the opening of the book of redemption there's power in it to put you back into the place again as you were in his mind before the foundation of the world now the bible says that we are i've read these scriptures in the last few weeks we were far off we're referred to as aliens we're referred to as strangers estranged from god we're referred to as as being enemies of god if you're not in relationship with god then the peace is lost we're referred to as enemies of god before we have the lord in our lives we're an enemy of god if we love the world then we're enemies with god you never see yourself as that but when if we don't have the lord we're just working against the lord and so we're referred to these things and then his love and his power and his grace comes in our lives and his power goes out to call you and to bring you out of this uh uh aliens and strangers and afar off back into a relationship with him that you're invited into his house that's a special thing to be invited into his house and then i'm going to take it further today that if you have the term bride and bridegroom you're not just invited into his house but you're invited into a special intimate relationship spiritually into the bed chamber with christ as it were and and i just say that because the bible refers to when you talk about a bride and bridegroom that is one of the most intimate close relationships on the face of the earth or at least should be and this is the term he begins using spiritually in our lives bride bridegroom you're not just invited in the church you're not just invited into his house but you're invited in to share a close relationship with him not a distant relationship not friends of the couple but the couple so when he reconciled whenever you have reconciliation you have an atonement that price has to be paid and he paid the price to bring us back into reconciliation again and the power to pull us back all the way not just halfway to bring us back all the way not just to an altar of repentance but actually the bible refers to us to be seated in heavenly places with christ now that's friends that's not inviting you to come into his house and to repent and to be forgiven that's a that's a position to be seated together with him in heavenly places and the prophet taught us that's not someday i know i'm going to heaven someday that's now it's the believer's position in christ that we are reconciled not just to a place of salvation and repentance but we're reconciled to sit in heavenly places with christ now talk about a power of reconciliation question is are you there today oh now we're going to be the evangelist and be convicting where are you at you've been some of you sent out this message for years where are you at in your relationship with jesus christ well i've been in the message for years you know i've got the eagle belt buckle i've got the whole deal those you know that's that's not pertinent anymore i don't think it ever was but it's not pertinent anymore where are you if this message is to restore us back to complete relationship with jesus christ on an everyday basis where are you at in your relationship with him are you still afar off and going and believing the message it's okay i'm prepared for you to get quiet where are you at in your relationship on a scale of one to ten where are you at today only you can answer that question in your relationship with the lord where are you at from one to ten i might start asking that personally to you because i'm the pastor and i want to get you from a 3 to a 10. i want to get you this 7 to a 10. if you're at 9 i'm not going to stop preaching to you i'm going to get you from a 9 to a 10. why because the word says we can be there there isn't anything holding that back calvary has purchased the full price for you to be completely reconciled and fellowship with him and you say oh i just don't feel worthy well i'm going to deal with that today i don't feel worthy to be there it's not your worthiness it's the price he paid at the cross and that price was fully paid and that price brings you complete if you'll respond it brings you back into heavenly places with jesus christ not a far off that's right not strangers no longer strangers no longer alienated away aliens i don't even like those terms i don't like to be alien has a bad term today especially i don't like the bible calls me an alien before god i don't want to be called an alien i know i'm weird but i don't want to be called that anymore but no longer will we have these these terms but to be brought back into it would be like an example of someone being a way away afar off and wanting to address this we must see this we must see this or we will stop short of where the lord can take us so brother johnny uh slackly didn't know that his song would go with this example i want to give great example in the scripture of the prodigal son that he sang about so we find that uh the prodigal son been preached about a lot but there's so much in there about predestination he was always a son can you say amen got away from the father and so this is predestination people look people preach it sometimes that they have a wayward son and it's a prodigal son coming back to them that's fine that's true but it's a deeper meaning jesus is preaching predestination jesus is preaching what we should already know let me get simple for you okay my four children are here today there was a day that we didn't know them my wife and i didn't know them but they were in me in seed form through the betting round of marriage now today i can fellowship with my sons and my daughters i can see them i can have fellow i can have them over and talk to them i can hug them like i just did my daughter when i came up i can fellowship but before i couldn't do that but they were always in me if that's true if with you naturally it's true with you spiritually if you're a christian today you were always in the mind of the father you were in him redemption is not just getting something brand new redemption is to bring you back from what you were in the beginning so let's take the prodigal son a minute solomon come up here a minute if you would so solomon i want you to go afar off like the prodigal son was all right i want you to go far off once you go back to the back of the church go run run away no running in the church okay he's reminding me all right unless you're shouting go as far as you can go go up in the balcony i want you to go afar off okay and this is what happened with the prodigal son and what happens with us this is this is our life story all of us without god and you were so far away there was no fellowship with father and and you were so afar off and it didn't seem like being that far away that you could come back again i want to make a point again today i want you to catch something there's something in the prodigal son story that we we don't want to miss and that is that uh the prodigal son had a mindset as soon as he started to come to himself he had a mindset that said i'm thinking i'm going to go back to the father i was a son but i i'm unworthy to be a son still so in his mind if i could just come back and enter and just be a servant or just work or just get some food and i want you to just notice that now when we come back a lot of times we only have a certain place that we want to come to you know when we come to god we have needs and we're coming to god for a reason sometimes tragedy can drive people to god so we all have reasons why we come to him maybe you're hungry maybe you're spiritually hungry we come for different reasons so we come and god provides that but we have to remember that this is a word of reconciliation to take you completely back to all that you lost not just to repentance and he's saying if i could just come back and if i could just repent of what i've done then maybe there'll be a job for me in the estate where i can be a servant that's his mentality that's it so as the song sang this morning it wasn't that solomon started to come back it was that the father when he seen him afar off he began to run towards oh i might have to sing yet again johnny he ran to us he didn't wait and say i'll see if he runs to me let's see how serious he is about things the father soon as he see him he ran to him right some i'm going to run in the church because i'm the pastor and i can son come come to me son come to me i bet your cameras can't get over here come on we better get out here in front of the video thank you cameras coming i love you come on he has an unworthy uh mindset so he's just already thought this is only only going to go so far and he's happy just to become a servant he's happy to come and be right here at the altar and his father he's going to repent at this altar and his father goes back up into his position and he's standing over him he's thankful he's repenting this is all wonderful but in his mindset that's all the further he goes but this is a word of complete reconciliation and he's a son he's my son if he's my son he can never stay in the category of a servant he may try to keep himself there in his humility but there is no way that the father is going to leave a son in a category of servant when he's predestinated to be restored completely back to his position again so you know he's he's staying in that thing but the father says no no no no i wanna i want you restored back i want you to be back in fellowship just doing some uh furniture rearranging here this morning you're all gonna think i'm crazy so this is the father this is where he is okay and he said no son i am glad to have you back you you're not a servant you're my son i want you back in fellowship i want you back in your position completely sit here with me and we'll have some fellowship together this is your christian walk it's not just repentance it's back with unhindered fellowship with the father because you are a son amen so then he says he goes beyond he's happy he's happy he's already happy he said i didn't deserve any of this i don't deserve any of this dad but he says let's have a celebration let's get my robe son this is my robe i'm so glad to have you back get up and put my robe on it's my robe but you're my son you wear my robe praise the lord you look good in that bring bring bring me a ring bring my ring puts the ring on his finger you're my son wear my ring what's this here this is the fatted calf bring the fatty calf time to have a party it's time to celebrate bring in all the feasts bring the fatted calf my son has come back home to me amen this word is not just a word to bring you to repentance your christian walk you came to the message 10 years ago you came to the message 20 years ago where are you at today where's your fellowship with the father it's not just to get your dress all right and you're wearing the right dresses and you have your devotion every day it's called fellowship it's called being completely sitting in the father's house back into fellowship with him and nobody can keep you from that fellowship not even the older brother the older brother was resentful about this i've been sitting around here working for years this guy comes back he's spoiled every event of inheritance he's done all this other stuff he gets this position back again just like that yes he does so the servants made fun of him his elder brother made fun of him people wait make fun of you but god has called you to a relationship teenagers god's called you to a relationship not a religion not smearing the message on the outside where are you at in that relationship today it's you and him personally exclusive together can you say that i love you bud it's good to be back in fellowship with you again amen you better take that and put it in the freezer out back let's give them a hand [Applause] anybody ever heard the story of the talking about value anybody heard the story of the uh the man that went on the island in the pacific and wanted this wife and i'm only saying this because some of the older ones know it but the younger ones may not know it and on an island in the pacific lived a woman named sarita who on the other islanders agreed was quite plain and lacked any of the social graces expected of women on the island she was in the eyes of the islanders and even her own father not likely to marry because he was a woman without worth then one day a man named johnny lingo isn't that interesting his name is johnny we have somebody johnny's here today johnny lingo appeared and offered her father the unheard sum of eight cows to marry sarita the islanders were shocked because no one had ever paid more than five or six cows for a wife not even the most valuable woman of the island got more than six cows johnny however paid the eight cows and took his new wife home to his own island months later a visitor to the islands heard the story of john lingle and his eight cow wife and decided to visit the couple to find out why johnny would pay such a high price for a woman viewed as having little or no value and to his surprise he met sarita and found her to be stunningly beautiful and one of the most graceful woman he had ever seen confused he asked johnny why his wife seemed to be so different than the other island women had described to him johnny's answer was simple the change happened the change in her took place was because i have an eight cow wife and i paid eight cows for her and when she knew that she was of that value she started to act like an eight cow wife [Applause] jesus christ has paid the ultimate price for you can you say amen and you have to know how valued you are can you say man yes sir how many of you husbands have a eight cow wife raise your hand very good very good praise the lord so let me go into this just a little different way if you got time this morning it was a husband and a wife at the beginning that relationship of husband and wife becomes the ultimate one in the end spiritually because we know there was a first adam there was a first eve and then jesus christ is referred to the second adam through redemption and we're referred to as the second eve so what happened back there in that marriage was a type and shadow of what god was going to do spiritually and that there would be a relationship at the end in revelations called the marriage supper of the lamb the bride the lamb's wife has made herself ready the beginning of the book talks about a marriage husband and wife relationship not an uncle and aunt not family not sisters not no it's a husband and wife which is the most intimate close exclusive relationship and the bible starts with a marriage and the bible ends with that type of relationship not servants not slaves can you say man it doesn't say at the end the slaves have made themselves ready for their master it speaks of this relationship of a bride and so now you have a picture of that husband and wife at the beginning the bride the bridegroom speaks of a close intimate relationship and fellowship not shared with anyone else it's exclusive it is a fellowship and a relationship like no other it is special or i should say it it should be special let me take a moment to say that the world has cheapened the exclusive relationship of husband and wife bride and bridegroom the world has cheapened marriage the world has cheapened sex that is meant to be only in a marriage the world has cheapened even those terms of husband and wife they don't even have bride and bridegroom they don't have the commitment anymore they don't have the value to them anymore people are already doing prenuptial agreements before they're even married they don't have the commitment so satan has taken that very term that's supposed to be an exclusive unadulterous relationship only an intimate that's only shared between the two of you and satan has even taken those terms and watered them down but god hasn't done that it's still an exclusive relationship it should be a special relationship and this is what we teach young people here and we're going to remind you of it young people here in our church that the world has cheapened things that are meant to be special an intimacy of touching a woman or touching a man or in any way intimately is to be reserved for one place one place and one place only and that's within a marriage vow and you're not to touch a woman or a man not to talk to a woman not to touch a man to kiss before marriage to touch one another in an intimate way before marriage they're not to do that until they made the commitment of marriage why because god allows certain special things to be only in an exclusive hidden quiet relationship between husband and wife after they are married now you look at my world and you can see that's all messed up now and i teach our young people that dating come along in the 19 20 30 right about the time we got cars is when we had the term dating come along and dating come along every since before that was called courtship and courtship was something that the guy was interested in the girl he came over and visited the girl at the at the family's house and so he didn't have a choice if he wanted time with that girl he was around the family so it was there's a book that i you can read it was written years ago from the front porch to the back seat of the car that's when dating changed from around the family in open area it changed from the front porch sitting on the front porch and maybe maybe you could get the dad and the mom and everybody and the siblings to get out of there a while so you could talk to her privately but that's where it all mostly happened but when the car came along and a guy got a car then they took off out which which is is not necessarily wrong but what they're saying it made a big transition on our country because it changed from just this thing of going out and having marriage relations and petting and doing all these things that belong to head towards a marriage type intimacy am i am i being general enough and plain enough at the same time it all changed so we try to teach younger teens especially but all young people to be mindful of your hormones and to be mindful of how god's made you he's made you to be married he's made you to have intimacy with somebody but god has put it in a blessed place and it's called marriage it's within the world we got all kinds of partners and okay girlfriends and dating the dating game is that you share this intimacy with your heart with like 10 or 12 people by the time you get married god never intended for you to give your heart and your body to that many people god really has called you to be young guys a one one-woman man and he's called you girls to be a one-man woman now you're going to have friendships you're going to have affections for different ones and might take you a little while to figure out which one is the right one that's all fine you're going to have friendships but friendships is different talking and friendships and complementing one another all that's normal it's right i don't want to be the bad guy here to say it's it's abnormal to have attractions to the opposite sex and don't you dare have it if you don't have an attraction to the opposite sex you got a problem you're not normal i need to pray for you it is every bit normal to have an attraction to the opposite sex god put that thirst within you to have that kind of fellowship am i being good fellowship with a man or a woman but he intended it to be within the blessed place called marriage and whenever you take anything related to marriage intimacy outside of marriage and do it before or do these things over here you cheapen it you keeping it and god wants it to be special god wants it to be exclusive because of the world we live in we're thankful for the grace and the blood of jesus christ because there's a lot of people sitting here that did not know these things and sometimes knew them and overrode them and his grace has forgiven them their mistakes and they have great marriages today they have great families today god can forgive and wash you clean but i'm speaking to the ones who have the opportunity to keep it special to keep it real and i'm telling you young people keep it special keep it real hold your heart and hold your body until that day on the wedding day and after that that's where god says it's blessed the barrier the bible says the marriage bed is undefiled the marriage bed is undefiled not the dating bed not to be in college in bed with somebody that's not undefiled that's defiled but the marriage bed it's undefiled none of this is in my notes up there i don't even know what my notes say right now but i just want to make the point again that this marriage husband and wife this was to be special and i encourage young people to keep it special you're going to fall in love with somebody someday you might be in love right now i don't know but you are going to have an attraction and you're praying for the will of god you you do that we encourage you to just follow the lord and all that's going to happen and it's and it should happen according to his will all that is of god but when you're real young teens you tend to say i'm going to go date somebody then i might be dating somebody different next year and you just kind of play in the field a little bit we don't do that around here another thing we don't do around here is a lot of touching and hugging in the world and in certain churches it's become normal for everybody to hug one another it's an expression of love i understand that but we don't do a lot of that around here because because we like to have some boundaries because if we kept it going we'd be constantly hugging and we'd have husbands hugging bear hugs to another man's wife so it's it's it's about where it goes it might be all innocent to start but it doesn't stay innocent so for the married folks and for the younger folks and i'm saying this because we've had a little hugging going on lately we just don't want to bring that in here and you can shake that girl's hand and say god bless you say i'd like to talk to you a while you can you can stand out there and talk to her till 11 00 until we kick you out you can talk to her all you want to to get to know her and then later on you can ask the father can i talk come over and talk you can go over and talk to her and the father gives us permission you can go to and then eventually down the road you're going to go out for a nice coffee or something together the father gives permission you're going to do that it's all but all of that can happen so purely and so right without bringing in what belongs in marriage is that okay none of this is none of this is in my notes this is this is free this is all free but this is the way we teach it here it is good for a man first corinthians 7. some of you visitors aren't even going to come back ever again but we live in a world you know i got to be counter culture here i got to tell the truth first corinthians 7 says it's good for a man not to touch a woman keep your hands off until the ring is on the finger i'm talking about sexually it's all about things that lead to sex that's what i'm talking about keep your hands off and it's all right there in the bible black and white it's clear don't listen to the cultures and watch the way the culture culture's doing listen to the word of god can you say amen is that okay with everybody dating has keeping things to take the specialness out of so it's special marriage husband and wife should be kept that way it's wonderful i would you know i love marriage listen i love the closeness between me and my wife the intimacy that we have and fellowship together i wouldn't go back to single life for no money in the world i love it and hopefully she loves it it's great to be on this side i wouldn't go back to sing a life for nothing because it's a special relationship and god's going to give that to you young people someday wait until it's the right thing don't be in a hurry but wait till it's the right thing when it's the right thing go for it because it'll it'll be good it'll be good praise the lord so you know because the world has cheapened the word bride i don't think that we should let it become common among us as well amen because we've used it for years as a term the bride but it can lose its meaning and lose its close relationship that that means between you and christ the bride becomes the people that are a part of a movement for the last days i think about this last night it becomes also it becomes just those that are part of a movement part of the message it becomes only the ones that message conventions are the bride it's only message churches the bride because they got a message sign on the door that's the bride that's the only bride or i'm in the bride because i go to this church i say we cheapen the term bride i'm in the bride because i go to this church or i become i go to its camp meetings so bride becomes a pride instead of a relationship because i'm a part of this church that i must be bride i'm sorry my friend i'm here to tell you just because you go to a message church does not make you bride the bride is the term of an intimate relationship with christ that's going on just between you and christ it's not a convention it's not a camp meeting it's not a movement you're not in the bride because you go to a message church or you believe god sent a prophet you're not in the bride because of that you're in the bride because the blood of jesus christ has brought you into a marriage with the husband jesus christ and you're in that relationship every day let me say it to those that are listening around the world that's who the bride is it's the wife of the husband jesus christ the word it's not a church it's not a movement it's not a group of people i know it's a mini-member bride but it's a relationship and we should never forget that and if you're not in a relationship with this husband that i'm preaching every day you're not reaching the full potential of what this is if you're afar off there's something wrong is that okay to say see you're the bride because i want to remind you everybody it means you have a new birth it by his word and have been washed by the blood of the lamb and have come into personal intimate special relationship every day with him you live in his house you took on his name can you say a man a bride takes on her husband's name and that means you represent everything that he represents in the word you don't say i'm a confess christ and you go out here and live like the world no you take on the very name of jesus christ so everything you do and say and watch and listen to represents christ you are his wife and you represent him my wife today represents me everything that i preach everything that i stand for you'll see it reflected in her and the bride of christ what the word says she stands for and you'll be able to see it in her life she's not another woman she's not a harlot spiritually the book of revelation speaks about the mother church and it's harlots but the bride is not that harlot she has an intimate exclusive relationship with the husband jesus christ the word is that okay with everybody now god begins to refer to i hope you give me just another i'm just buying some time here because i can finish some of it next sunday so we're only 20 minutes to one give me about 15 minutes praise the lord turn with me to isaiah 54. god begins to use the term husband and wife in isaiah 54 when his people have backslidden got away from him and they were his servants israel he was referred to as god referred to him as the the children of israel how many knows that he referred to them the children of israel all those throughout the old testament the children of israel but in isaiah 54 when restoration begins he has to really build up his people in speaking to them and referring to them and the relationship changes they're no longer going to be the children of israel but he's going to take on and it's the first time we begin to hear from god the term husband and wife referred to in a spiritual relationship with god isaiah 54 and verse 5 says for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall be he be called for the lord hath so so notice what he says now i'm changing relationship with you now it's not just that you're my children and i'm your maker but now i want you to refer to me as thine husband for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused saith the lord so now there was a marriage relationship he looked at but as a wife of the youth she rejected the lord the days of jeremiah prophesied you were going into captivity all these other things but isaiah speaks of the restoration the reconciliation and when she comes back he starts to use the term husband refer to me as husband for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee say of the lord thy redeemer for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee for the mountains shall depart so we'll just stop right there so i have sworn like i swore with no i won't destroy the earth by water anymore but now i'm swearing to to you that i will no longer be wrath with thee nor rebuke thee and then there's so much more there but i just want you to get the boy this is where he begins to refer to husband isaiah 62 just a few chapters over isaiah 62 and verse 1 for zion's sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest until their righteousness there or i go as a brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness in all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which thy mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of god now we haven't heard much of this kind of language coming from god referring to his people royalty diadem it's kind of like bringing someone back up here to the throne with his father coming back with the robe and the royal ring and the fatigue have all these things being restored he's referring to his people with these terms so that they can know that you're coming back into a place of reconciliation and royalty again you will be my wife i will be your husband can you say amen thou shalt verse 4 verse 4 thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be term desolate but thou shalt be called hazzaba and thy lambula for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a young man married a virgin show shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee i'm telling you the children of israel who were called forsaken who were called desolate that's the term that they have took on for years because of their rebellion you're the forsaken you're nothing god has to restore say i will no longer refer to you as the forsaken bride but you are the restored bride and like a young man has a virgin and a bride and he rejoices in her i want to let you know i am not wroth with you i am no longer angry with you you are my wife i am your husband you're not no longer called forsaken but you're called my wife and i delight in you and i rejoice in you i delight in you i rejoice in you you're my wife all right it's wonderful i love the book of isaiah as it comes into redemption that way it begins to build the people back up go over with me says it also in hosea chapter 2 another prophet speaks it if you can find it hosea chapter 2. and verse 1 through 13 is all referring to israel's adultery spiritually she is an adulteress look what happens though in our adultery you know spiritually you're an adulteress we're an adulteress against god right so she's in adultery but look at verse 14 i believe is where it picks up therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her and i will give her vineyards from dents in the valley of acor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the days when she came up out of the land of egypt and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call me ishii and shall call me no more valley for i will take away the name so let's just stop right there once again just like isaiah says you shall no longer call me bally which means master but you shall call me ishi which means husband first seal yes as the word begins to open up come on brother brother brown's talking and he just says i i won't refer to you as church i call you bride and that's at the opening of the seals i call you bride you no longer address me as master but is she husband i just i know we're getting a little tired but listen listen now i just hope you don't miss it the powerful relationship that that means a servant and a slave is nowhere near in their intimate relationship as husband and yet god says i'm reconciling you and i'm bringing you into this relationship because i love you moving into the new testament now jesus begins using the term bride and groom you remember the one time it's familiar to you the prophecy for the end time he says there'll be ten virgins in the end time five foolish five wives wise and then he says all of them heard the call behold the bride groom cometh this when jesus begins to refer to bride and bridegroom behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to me him the foolish virgins didn't have oil which means the holy spirit they tried to go but didn't have holy spirit to go with right so this is all about the end time what's it about bride bridegroom the bride who cometh go out to meet the bridegroom but only five virgins have oil they're the ones that meet him so that's one place he refers to it but john 3 if you would turn with me to john 3 john the baptist refers to it and i referred to this last sunday we have to catch this john chapter 3 and verse 25 if you would john chapter 3 verse 25 then there arose a question between some of john's disciples and the jews about purifying and they came unto john and said unto him are everybody still awake i shouldn't have a kids days that long and then preach this long the next day i'm getting ready to close i promise just in a few minutes but the word is good amen not me but the word is good everybody stand up with your body stand up for a minute say praise the lord raise your hand stretch a little bit amen this is a little spiritual exercise i would have you do what josh my son-in-law does to me every day but you'd be dying by the time i got done all right praise the lord sit down look at this there was a question between john's disciples and the jews about purifying and they came unto john and said rabbi he that is with thee beyond jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him john's disciples say the one you said is the lamb he's over there he's baptizing too so the question is about first of all about purifying with the jews they were having discussions about it how is a person purified and they're asking why is he baptizing over there jesus has disciples he's baptizing and we still have disciples we're baptizing this is john's disciples they were disciples of john the baptist who by the way had the spirit of elias on him how many believe that so there's disciples of the people who are following the guy that has the spirit of elias on him and they're staying with john and still helping him baptize and this was john's response john answered and said a man can receive nothing except be be given from heaven so first of all he answers the question about purification you're not purified because you're baptized you're not fearful if you receive anything it's because a man can resiliently accept he'd be given him from heaven you're given this purification you're given something from god in your soul it's not baptism that does it right then he goes and he says you yourself bear witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am set before him he that half the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and hearing him rejoice greatly because the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled do you know that john the baptist just said that there's two groups under the whole ministry of elijah because he had the spirit of elijah and jesus coming and all the movement going on john says there's two groups there's the bride who will be married to christ and then there's the friends of the bridegroom now don't go away saying that i'm saying that john the baptist was just a friend of the bridegroom he was elect but he's the one making the separation saying there's the friends of the bridegroom but then there's the bride at a wedding there's the best man there's the maid of honor there's all the other people there's the friends of the family there's the friends of the bridegroom there's a friend of bride and they sit on both sides and they do this but there's only one bride standing there and john says there are those that are friends of the bridegroom that rejoice just because of the bridegroom's voice but there's a deeper group there's a there's a there's a group that goes deeper than just rejoicing in the bridegroom's voice respectfully i believe that there's been many conventions through the years with a lot of people rejoicing over the bridegroom's voice but my question to you is just because you're rejoicing over the bridegroom's voice doesn't mean that you're the bride of jesus christ i don't know about you but i want to be the bride i want to be in fellowship with him i want to be in relationship with him i love his voice i love to hear his voice too but i don't want to just be going and shouting over the voice that's come i want to be intimate close spiritually with that who that voice is yes john was a voice and he says you were willing for a see jesus said you were willing for a season to rejoice in that light to rejoice in john's voice but that's not the voice we're looking to today and there are movements that are building up and keep building up the prophet and building up the prophet and keep pointing the people to the prophet and i'm here to say this scripture says there's two groups we're not just to continue to emphasize just the voice that came through the prophet but this message has called us to come into a relationship with the husband jesus christ [Applause] it's not a movement it's a relationship it's not a movement it's a relationship and then john says the words verse 30 if you still have it up i know i'm ending in a minute john says the words in verse 30 he christ must increase but me the prophet must decrease that transition is happening today too where he the prophet as far as personality and all that must decrease and christ must increase the marriage of the lamb has come the invisible union has come you find everything i'm saying in the message i don't have time to read the quotes today but when he has titles like the restoration of the bride tree that's what i'm preaching the reconciliation of the bride when he has titles like the invisible union of christ with christ and his bride it's speaking of this marriage that's taking place it's beyond just a message can you say amen so when i said at the beginning i'm going to try to wrap this up so i don't have to do it next sunday listen when i said at the beginning when we come to god we come to him for certain things at a certain level can you say amen and but we don't expect that he when we first came we didn't know that he wanted us to be his bride there are women in the bible if you go through the bible that realize when they came to god they were expecting certain things from god but they didn't realize that they would become his wife when rebecca watered isaac's campbell's camels in the mind of god she was to be isaac's wife but she didn't know that so she just politely and humbly she says i'll water all of your camels for you and she didn't know in the mind of god the man of god had already spoken and it says the girl who waters all my camels and it offers to do that willingly she'll be the one she didn't know it she just did it she just did that to service and she didn't realize she would be the bride ruth came with naomi and there was a famine in the land they were just hungry they just needed food we're going to have to get out of here so both her nanome and naomi left she didn't know the mind of god she didn't know the thoughts of god and so she gets in the middle and naomi says that's my kinsmen over there see if he has any food get around him start to go work in his food so ruth says i'm going to go work in his fields i'll just get close start working around him and all that she just wanted food she just wanted to be sustained during a famine she didn't know that she would become the wife of boaz everybody see what i'm seeing sure we come to god for certain things but he doesn't want you to come just for forgiveness he's invited to be his bride you getting it should i go abigail she's married to another guy nabo he's a mess he's saying disrespectful things to david who's the type of christ and she's going what am i going to do with this man he's a mess so she goes secretly because david's going to destroy all of them she secretly goes and talks just bows before david as a servant you're handmade she keeps using the term handmade your servant your slave and she's respectfully saying do this if you did this and she she talks david out of destroying her husband and the whole family she's just coming with a cr request to christ but in the mind of god in the mind of god she would become his wife isn't that wonderful because her husband passes away i think in a heart attack and that bang bang bang and the bible says david takes her abigail to be his wife she didn't know that she didn't know it'd be that type of relationship so let's so listen when you come to the lord and maybe even today i'm convinced a lot of us don't realize how close the lord wants you to him you young people i don't know if you realize how close the lord wants to be to you and it's only your limitations that keeps you going just so far with him but he's reconciling you to a much closer relationship than what you have today they came to god with a certain need god met the need but they didn't realize i don't want you just to be my handmaid i want you to be my wife aren't you don't you feel good today don't you feel love of god from the very songs this morning don't you feel loved by god he ran to me he wants me to be his bride he wants to be infested i say to message believers or whoever's listening and streaming whatever it is i challenge you today where's your relationship with this christ this husband this word on a scale of one to ten where are you at today because to me this message is about relationship not rules not religion this isn't another movement this isn't another dress code amen it's not what the message is about it's part of it but it's not what this is taking us to if we can just get all the women dressed right and all the men just dressed perfect then we're the bride no no no no no it's a about relationship with the husband you young people come into close relationship with him and feed on his word every day and talk with him and you with him and have communion you don't have to worry about things in your life god will show you how to live god will bring the things in your life that you need just come into relationship with you can you say praise the lord into thy chamber be free holy spirit speak to me gently as i close the door heaven [Music] [Music] this is this is what he wants to hear you say let's stand into the can you imagine now you inviting him in be free shut all the world out all everybody's opinion it's just about me and you lord as i close the door [Music] heavenly [Music] me [Music] just whisper to him whatever you want to say to him just now isn't it amazing that you could you don't have to go through a priest or go through some other means but you can speak directly to the lord from your own lips and your own heart just now you might be saying i feel a far off lord i feel distant from you [Music] i've been feeding on the wrong things maybe i've been too busy for our relationship lord forgive me this is not a servant thing that i come around every now and then and i work hard for you [Music] lord i know now today this is a husband and wife relationship lord i don't want to be distant from you i want to speak to you my heart i want to be closer than i've ever been before forgive me of my sins forgive me my weaknesses lord the things that put a wall between us let there be no walls today lord let there be no walls between us cleanse me of any iniquities let there be open reconciled fellowship with you maybe you've been swayed by the opinions of others and their diagnosis of where you are don't worry about that you know where you are your husband knows where you are only you know how to bring it back and say into thy chamber be free holy spirit come lord jesus commune with me fellowship with me talk with me lord i want to respond to you i want to be your your representative as it were lord when the world looks at me they see jesus christ my husband reflected in this time before we go today you raise your hand say brother paul pray for me that i get from wherever i'm at to a closer relationship with this husband jesus christ pray for me i'm at i'm at a number two and i want to be at a 10. pray for me i'm i have about a six and i need to be at a 10. i want to be in a 10. god bless you god bless you if i could just be closer to the lord if i could just find that real close fellowship with him that maybe you used to have you used to have it but you don't have it anymore may god restore it back to you this morning bless every hand in every heart lord we commit their souls to you this is what the message is all about you being reconciled your wife being reconciled back you no longer want them to be referred to as forsaken or desolate the bride that we no longer look at you and call you master but lord we look at you and say this is my my mate my husband the word i want to be one with him god bless you each one god bless them lord as they travel on this spiritual journey may what i said help them in their journey i pray and we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ lay your hands on one another just for a minute lay your hands on your brothers brothers sisters sisters pray for them just now would you pray for them father build up my brother and sister in this faith lord cometh by hearing and hearing by the word as we've been in here today we lay our hands on one another that you would encourage and strengthen the body of christ and lord the words that have been said that they become real uh real in our hearts strong in our hearts and it would be more than just a distant relationship with you but it would become a close relationship the brother and sister that's beside me i'm praying for a closer relationship with the lord break down every barrier every wall may they come into that lord if they're at a seven a day may you draw them into your presence to be close to you lord bring that chicana lord into your presence lord bring it in there so we can be close to you we love you lord bless them in jesus name into
