[5:39] yeah sure sure I mean you guys can come

[5:44] as you want
[5:45] [Laughter]
[5:47] uh well we're certainly looking forward

[5:52] October 19th I think is when
[5:53] registration opens so y'all come come
[5:55] one come on and man we love the young
[5:58] people love to see the Lord move upon
[6:00] the hearts of our youth amen well God
[6:03] bless you if you have your Bible turned
[6:04] to John chapter 16. amen John chapter
[6:07] 16.
[6:15] good to see amen all the youth that are
[6:18] here amen those that came amen and
[6:21] there's brother Elliot McGeary God bless
[6:23] you good to see you amen your dad told
[6:25] me you'd be here tonight and so good to
[6:27] see him and amen it's certainly been a
[6:30] privilege to be here with you I trust
[6:31] that something was said for those of you
[6:33] that were here this morning that was a
[6:34] blessing Amen to your heart and we have
[6:37] more that's upon our heart that we just
[6:39] want to say knowing that this service
[6:41] would be here tonight and that we'd be
[6:42] speaking and I just was seeking the
[6:45] direction of the Holy Spirit you know
[6:47] you can say it the the the well that we
[6:49] draw from is just a bottomless well the
[6:52] word that we have is so rich it wouldn't
[6:55] almost matter what scripture or what
[6:57] thought I would take there'd be
[6:58] something good you can say but I believe
[7:01] that the Holy Spirit doesn't the Holy
[7:03] Spirit doesn't just generically bring
[7:05] something you know across the pulpit but
[7:07] I believe that there's a specific word
[7:10] for a specific time for a specific group
[7:13] of people and I want to say Lord I just
[7:16] want to tune into your mind how many
[7:18] young people would say Lord let me
[7:20] harmonize my spirit with your Holy
[7:22] Spirit tonight and let me hear what the
[7:25] spirit of God is saying to the church
[7:27] here tonight I've got very uh just
[7:30] caught great confidence that the Lord
[7:32] has has me in the direction that he
[7:34] wants me to go and oftentimes that's not
[7:36] the direction that a preacher wants to
[7:38] go you want to go a certain way and
[7:40] preach a certain thing then the Lord has
[7:41] a will and you just have to surrender to
[7:44] that so I'd ask for your help how many
[7:46] believers do we have here raise your
[7:48] hand say I'm a believer of the word of
[7:49] God Amen so you know preaching the
[7:52] gospel of spiritual warfare
[7:55] praying every time you bow your head and
[7:57] you close your eyes and you pray you're
[7:59] entering into spiritual warfare and you
[8:02] know it's it's you're fighting demon
[8:04] Spirits you're the brother Branham said
[8:06] in this room right now as Angels trying
[8:08] to energize people's Faith there's
[8:09] demons trying to get people to doubt the
[8:11] word of God into question but in all of
[8:14] that I just want to say Lord would you
[8:15] just pull us up to your table tonight
[8:17] would you let your Holy Spirit just come
[8:20] and speak exactly what you want to say
[8:22] Lord I've got an open heart here how
[8:24] many would raise the hand and say Lord
[8:26] I've got an open heart to hear what your
[8:28] word has to say amen I believe that amen
[8:32] the Lord can really honor that amen John
[8:35] chapter 16 I'm going to just going to
[8:37] preach to you here tonight and I'm just
[8:39] going to title this message what is
[8:41] truth
[8:42] what is truth
[8:45] how be it this is John chapter 16 very
[8:47] familiar scripture let's just begin
[8:49] reading it here in verse 13. I'm sorry
[8:52] verse 12.
[8:54] I have yet many things to say unto you
[8:58] but you cannot bear them now
[9:02] pretty powerful that the prophet of God
[9:04] would actually say that's why this
[9:05] revelation of the Seven Seals had to be
[9:07] opened because Christ had more that he
[9:11] wanted to say I'm glad I've got an ear
[9:14] that has heard what the Lord wanted to
[9:16] say
[9:18] and he says I have more that I want to
[9:20] say but you cannot bear them now how be
[9:23] it when he not what not it but he
[9:29] the spirit of Truth is come he will
[9:34] guide you into all truth somebody say
[9:37] all truth
[9:39] for he shall not speak of himself but
[9:41] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[9:45] speak and he will show you things to
[9:47] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[9:51] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[9:54] you all things that the father hath are
[9:57] mine therefore said I that he shall take
[10:00] of mine and shall show it unto you a
[10:03] little while and you shall not see me
[10:06] and again a little while and you shall
[10:09] see me because I go to the father
[10:12] Lord Jesus we just bow our heads here
[10:15] tonight Lord all together Lord so
[10:18] Desiring now God just to move ourself
[10:20] out of the way
[10:22] Lord I feel just such an unction of your
[10:25] Holy Spirit and Lord I just stand here
[10:27] right now God and say I surrender myself
[10:30] I Surrender my mind I Surrender Lord you
[10:33] know my heart God you know father is
[10:36] that even the weak leading up before
[10:38] this meeting God I would be praying and
[10:41] be meditated and asking you Lord what
[10:43] direction would you have me go for
[10:45] tonight this Tri-State meeting and what
[10:47] would you want me to say Lord I waited
[10:49] all Lord through the weekend and even
[10:51] this afternoon Lord and you came and
[10:53] showed up and gave me such Supernatural
[10:56] Vindication Lord that just showed me a
[10:59] such a clear path in what direction Lord
[11:02] I believe that you work on both ends and
[11:04] that I'm preaching to your children here
[11:06] tonight Lord and there's needs and
[11:08] hearts and father then I pray God that
[11:10] those that are here tonight who this
[11:12] service Lord would speak to I pray God
[11:14] that they would just say Lord let it
[11:16] fall into the fertile betting ground of
[11:19] my heart and let me receive my portion
[11:21] tonight God I Just Surrender my vessel
[11:24] Lord now to you may you come and take
[11:26] your word Lord and make it real to your
[11:29] children we ask it in the name of the
[11:31] Lord Jesus Christ and the church said
[11:35] and the church said amen you can be
[11:38] seated
[11:41] truth is an absolute standard we could
[11:44] say you could use this word standard or
[11:47] Plumb line
[11:48] truth is the absolute where in which
[11:51] everything is measured I believe that
[11:53] there's nothing more vital and nothing
[11:56] more Paramount and important in our
[11:58] lives that we have than truth and pilate
[12:03] comes to Jesus and he asks a very famous
[12:06] question and he asks him this mess this
[12:09] this question and says who is truth or
[12:12] what is truth and it's amazing because
[12:14] it's the same question that man has
[12:16] asked from the beginning of time really
[12:18] what is really truth and I could say
[12:21] that truth is God's view on any subject
[12:24] care what it is subject you want to
[12:27] bring here tonight and what topic we
[12:29] could talk about truth is God's view on
[12:32] any situation on any question and on any
[12:36] idea let me say that truth is not what a
[12:40] scholar a theologian a preacher or
[12:43] anyone says that it is truth is what it
[12:46] is
[12:47] uh the message if I could say it this
[12:49] way the message of the hour is not what
[12:52] brother Matt says it is it's not what
[12:53] brother Paul says it is it's not what uh
[12:56] any preacher anybody makes it or has
[12:58] made it uh it's not what any person
[13:00] preaches it because no matter how
[13:02] dogmatic a person is or how they sound
[13:05] uh as they sound that they are the
[13:08] end-all people can sometimes be the end
[13:10] all to all truth and that they are the
[13:12] orator or the Arbiter of truth but let
[13:15] me say this that you know and people
[13:17] would say I'm I'm preaching the truth
[13:19] and it's the end and my interpretation
[13:21] of what the Bible says is the truth and
[13:23] my interpretation of what the prophet
[13:25] said is the end and it's the solution
[13:27] it's the all-in-one and and the one all
[13:30] finality of everything and that's just
[13:31] carnal man that's how he has a tendency
[13:33] to be in his mind just to say that I
[13:36] have all the truth as if he's has the
[13:37] rights to all the truth but let me say
[13:40] just because a man says that it's true
[13:42] doesn't make it true
[13:44] hello somebody I need your help here
[13:46] tonight
[13:47] just because that my man says that it's
[13:49] true and just because Google says that
[13:51] it's true doesn't make it true
[13:54] let me say it this way the truth speaks
[13:57] for himself
[14:00] and it doesn't need a preacher it
[14:03] doesn't need an interpreter to give it
[14:05] its meaning it doesn't need a theology
[14:07] degree it doesn't need an intellect it
[14:09] doesn't need anything it the truth
[14:11] speaks for itself I'll go further and
[14:15] say the message of the hour it is what
[14:18] it is
[14:19] it's not the message of brother Branham
[14:21] either letting people has confused the
[14:23] message of the hours brother branham's
[14:25] message and people have misunderstood
[14:27] this and it's caused me much trouble
[14:29] among people but let me say he was the
[14:32] messenger but it wasn't his message he
[14:34] was only the mailman of the message
[14:36] that's why brother Brandon would say it
[14:38] wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio
[14:40] River I was only standing there when he
[14:43] appeared it's not me who does these
[14:45] signs and wonders amongst you brother
[14:47] Branham says I just happened to be close
[14:49] by as he begins to discern thoughts and
[14:52] begin to discern Hearts it wasn't his
[14:55] message it's a message from the throne
[14:57] listen it wasn't Jeremiah's message when
[14:59] Jeremiah would come with the thought of
[15:01] God he wasn't preaching his own
[15:03] Revelation or his own message when Mike
[15:06] hail would preach the word of God it
[15:08] wasn't my chaos message it was a message
[15:10] from Jehovah he was simply the anointed
[15:13] vessel that God had used to and to
[15:16] translate or be a conduit for that
[15:18] message from God so when when you
[15:20] rejected Jeremiah you weren't rejecting
[15:23] Jeremiah
[15:26] and when you rejected Micaiah you
[15:30] weren't actually rejecting you could
[15:31] mock Isaiah but you would never you
[15:33] actually weren't mocking Isaiah or
[15:35] rejecting Jeremiah you were rejecting
[15:38] Jehovah
[15:39] because it wasn't Jeremiah's thought it
[15:42] was the thought from the throne room of
[15:45] God sent down to a prophet messenger and
[15:48] he would speak and you either have a
[15:50] choice to believe it or to reject it
[15:54] and so the Book of Revelation was not
[15:56] the book hey we could say it that way
[15:58] that even the Book of Revelation was not
[16:01] John's book John was not the author of
[16:04] the book of Revelations
[16:06] hello somebody
[16:08] John was just the Scribe he was just the
[16:11] person writing it down the author the
[16:14] Bible says was written by Jesus Christ
[16:16] himself
[16:18] oh come on don't we have some Believers
[16:20] here
[16:22] Revelation the revelation of Jesus
[16:25] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[16:28] unto us his servants that were the
[16:30] things which must certainly come that
[16:32] was the message of Jesus Christ and John
[16:34] says he bore record of the word of God
[16:37] and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[16:40] all things that he that he saw unless it
[16:42] was uncomfortable for you it was really
[16:43] nice up here till you changed it but if
[16:45] it's bad out there I'd rather me suffer
[16:47] than them suffer so the prophet was
[16:50] listen the prophet wasn't the author of
[16:53] the message he just was the mailman
[16:59] who was Vindicated by God
[17:01] and what was the purpose of his
[17:03] Vindication to give you Faith to believe
[17:05] that what he spoke was not his own
[17:08] thought it was in his own mind so that
[17:11] your faith would not be anchored in a
[17:13] man but that you would have faith in
[17:15] that message that the message the man
[17:17] brought was from the throne room of God
[17:20] brother Branham was not who I say he was
[17:22] it's not who any man says that he is he
[17:26] was who he was
[17:28] he was who the word said that he was
[17:31] and so you say what is truth brother
[17:33] Matt it's the word which is the thought
[17:36] of God expressed
[17:40] and it's communicated the truth of the
[17:44] Gospel is communicated not by a human
[17:48] dialect or an articulation even though
[17:51] God uses men and it's important how we
[17:53] communicate but let me say this the
[17:55] truth by Revelation is a language that a
[17:59] human being cannot speak
[18:03] but it's a language that only the soul
[18:06] can understand
[18:08] true Revelation as brother Branham could
[18:10] say you could even have all of the
[18:12] doctrine of the godhead and miss the
[18:14] revelation of the godhead you could have
[18:16] him put it on a chalkboard and be able
[18:17] to lay out serpent seed with Biblical
[18:19] Doctrine you don't think that the devil
[18:21] understands what the serpent seat is you
[18:22] don't think the devil understands
[18:24] predestination and and the and the and
[18:26] the godhead listen the the the the
[18:28] understanding the intellectual academic
[18:31] knowledge is not the Revelation you
[18:33] could get all of the information
[18:36] and miss the revelation
[18:40] I could try to get you to understand it
[18:42] we could try to to teach it you could
[18:44] intellectually say aha I get it one plus
[18:47] one equals two two plus two equals four
[18:50] and and listen a lot of people have this
[18:53] kind of understanding it and it starts
[18:54] there that's perfectly fine it's good
[18:56] that we understand it's good that we we
[18:58] believe listen friends it's good for us
[19:00] to have knowledge it's important what
[19:02] you believe
[19:04] I said it's important what you believe
[19:06] what you believe will determine how you
[19:08] live what you believe will determine how
[19:11] you dress what you believe will
[19:13] determine how you how where you go and
[19:15] what you do it's important what we
[19:17] believe right
[19:19] so you can understand it you can
[19:21] understand it intellectually but no man
[19:24] has the ability to reveal it to you only
[19:28] God can do that himself
[19:32] that's why Peter says Jesus said who do
[19:34] men say that I am some say you are
[19:36] crying some say you're Jeremiah others
[19:38] say you're Isaiah and Jesus says but
[19:40] Peter who do you say
[19:43] and he says I say that you are the
[19:45] Christ the son of the Living God I know
[19:48] this is Elementary but friends I'm just
[19:49] going to be honest with you here tonight
[19:51] sometimes I believe that we glaze over
[19:53] some of these things and it's important
[19:55] for our young people especially to go
[19:57] back to some of the fundamental original
[20:00] truths and go over them again to make
[20:03] sure we don't just gloss over them as
[20:05] brother random says we're getting people
[20:07] to church but are we getting them to
[20:08] Christ the word we're getting them to a
[20:10] Doctrine or a theory but are we really
[20:12] getting them to the message
[20:17] and so that's why brother Brandon says
[20:19] above all else you should pray for
[20:21] revelation
[20:22] for with true Revelation in your life
[20:25] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[20:28] it but we will prevail against them
[20:31] so God is a god of Truth let me just say
[20:33] the Bible says the spirit of God is the
[20:36] spirit of Truth when you have the Holy
[20:39] Ghost you have the spirit of Truth when
[20:41] you have the Holy Ghost you have the
[20:43] spirit of wisdom when you have the Holy
[20:45] Ghost you have the spirit of
[20:46] understanding when you have the Holy
[20:48] Ghost you have the spirit of God it's
[20:49] the Holy Ghost the person the tutor the
[20:53] Redeemer the Savior the brother the
[20:56] Healer the forgiver he's all of the
[20:59] above
[21:01] and to deny one part of him you excuse
[21:06] and reject all of him
[21:10] let me say that again to deny one part
[21:13] and you miss out on the whole
[21:18] and so the spiritual battle God only
[21:21] functions in a realm of Truth whereas
[21:23] evil or the evil one our enemy is the
[21:26] father of Lies the Bible calls him and
[21:28] so God only functions in a realm of
[21:30] Truth whereas the evil when our enemy is
[21:33] the father of Lies so the spiritual
[21:35] battle that we face is a battle between
[21:38] lies and Truth
[21:41] so if you want to see victory in your
[21:43] life
[21:44] you got to start with God's view of the
[21:46] matter
[21:49] is that good
[21:51] and so many times in our spiritual life
[21:54] we get everyone else's view but we
[21:57] bypass God's view
[22:00] many times we get everybody else's
[22:02] opinion and we bypass the word of God
[22:04] what the word of God has to say to say
[22:06] about it so let me say this you can many
[22:09] times you can get everyone even our own
[22:11] understanding our own intellect our own
[22:14] knowledge
[22:15] and we can think we have all the facts
[22:19] but you can have the facts
[22:21] and not know the truth
[22:26] and let me say the facts
[22:28] can't set you free
[22:33] you can have all the information
[22:36] but not have the truth
[22:39] and I can say you can have all the
[22:40] emotions you can have all the feelings
[22:43] you can have all the sensations I'm not
[22:45] preaching against any of that you can
[22:47] have all the intellect and all the
[22:48] understanding and all the knowledge and
[22:50] all the feelings and all the emotion and
[22:52] all the sensation and miss the person
[22:58] you can completely miss the person let
[23:01] me say friends we need it all you don't
[23:04] just need a part of it you say brother
[23:05] Matt do you believe in do you believe in
[23:07] teaching I absolutely believe in
[23:09] teaching of the word of God do you
[23:10] believe we ought to study our Bibles I
[23:12] absolutely believe that every believer
[23:14] should be picking up his Bible and
[23:16] studying his Bible do you believe that
[23:18] the believer should study the message I
[23:19] believe that not just preachers but I
[23:21] believe Believers young people old
[23:23] people should be listening to the
[23:25] prophet of God the voice of vindication
[23:27] for this generation do you believe we
[23:29] shouldn't speak in tongues I absolutely
[23:31] do you believe we should dance in the
[23:32] spirit I absolutely I believe that's
[23:34] part of maybe not all not everyone will
[23:37] not everyone has to you need all of it
[23:40] friends
[23:42] I'm just going to stop here and preach
[23:44] for a moment I felt that and I'm just
[23:46] gonna I'm just gonna confront it right
[23:47] now
[23:48] let me just say this there are two
[23:50] ditches always
[23:53] there's always a ditch brother would
[23:55] deal with it of armenianism and
[23:56] Calvinism and and he said this cold
[23:58] start uh starts you formal church and
[24:00] then the hysterical fanatical Church
[24:04] and he said there's always two ditches
[24:06] to both sides
[24:07] and he said yeah he said it this way
[24:09] some people make Church a frolic
[24:14] and he said others make it a funeral
[24:19] and brother Branham says but it's
[24:20] neither a follicle nor a funeral it's a
[24:22] feast
[24:25] hallelujah oh glory to God I love that
[24:28] and he says and the bride goes through
[24:31] the middle
[24:33] and then he says that this way Pauline
[24:35] from both sides
[24:40] so what is the truth that's made up of
[24:42] both the left and the right ditch oh
[24:44] friends I've seen some cut out emotion
[24:47] I've seen others cut out teaching of the
[24:49] word of God I've seen some cut out
[24:52] dancing others cut out brotherly love I
[24:54] see some cut out the tapes others cut
[24:56] out the preachers some cut out the
[24:58] message others say we don't need the
[25:00] Bible some cut out repentance some cut
[25:03] out Grace it's the tactic of the devil
[25:06] to push us into ditches
[25:09] you say brother Matt then what do we
[25:11] need all of it we need every part of it
[25:14] I say God give me every part of what you
[25:17] have for me Lord don't let me sell
[25:19] myself short of anything you want to
[25:22] give me
[25:23] you say do you need the gifts of the
[25:24] Spirit you do do you need the fruits of
[25:26] the spirit you do you need it all
[25:32] the first church had the knowledge and
[25:34] revelation of the word of God and they
[25:36] told it
[25:37] and they preached it you think that the
[25:39] Bible doesn't tell the early church
[25:41] didn't teach the word they taught the
[25:43] word the Bible says they continued
[25:44] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine
[25:46] they understood the word they believed
[25:49] the word they preached the word they
[25:51] live the word
[25:53] I'm almost the first church had
[25:56] maybe I'm the only one I maybe I'll be
[25:58] greedy and just take it all for myself
[25:59] how many would say I want what the first
[26:02] church had that's the revelation of the
[26:05] message of what God was going to send us
[26:07] back to not to owe six Azusa Street but
[26:10] to 80 33 the original Pentecostal
[26:13] experience the original Pentecostal
[26:16] message the original Pentecostal word I
[26:18] say God give us it all
[26:24] the first church had the knowledge and
[26:26] revelation of the word of God the first
[26:28] church had the demonstration of the Holy
[26:30] Spirit by the manifestation of gifts in
[26:33] the entire body
[26:35] not just the preachers
[26:39] they were participators the first church
[26:41] had the divine nature of Christ in
[26:44] dwelling in them on a daily basis they
[26:46] were kindly affectionate one towards
[26:48] another with brotherly love the first
[26:50] church had the gifts the first church
[26:52] had Faith wisdom knowledge speaking in
[26:55] tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts
[26:58] of healing the working of Miracles can I
[27:00] get somebody to help me preach her
[27:02] tonight the gift of Prophecy the
[27:04] Discerning of spirits
[27:06] they also had the fruits of the spirit
[27:09] love and joy and peace along suffering
[27:12] gentleness goodness godliness meekness
[27:14] temperance
[27:16] do you realize if we major on any one
[27:21] thing
[27:22] and leave out any one thing
[27:25] we miss the whole thing
[27:32] are you with me here tonight
[27:36] he says I have many things that I want
[27:39] to say unto you but you cannot bear them
[27:41] now
[27:42] you cannot you cannot you cannot
[27:43] understand them now you cannot bear them
[27:45] now I'm just going to take a little turn
[27:47] here just for a moment
[27:48] I have many things yet to say unto you
[27:50] but you cannot bear them now how be it
[27:52] when he the spirit of Truth has come
[27:54] he'll guide you into all truth so
[27:57] brother Bannon says that the the Bible
[27:58] Jesus actually said it this way he that
[28:01] loveth the world
[28:03] now that word world is actually the word
[28:06] Cosmos it's the opposite of the word
[28:08] chaos now remember that just here for a
[28:10] moment he that loveth the cosmos which
[28:14] is the structure or the world system or
[28:18] the world order you say brother Matt do
[28:20] they mean the world has an odor oh yeah
[28:22] they certainly do you think education
[28:25] systems cultural systems social systems
[28:29] political systems
[28:31] you might think that they're separate
[28:33] they're all operating under the same
[28:35] orchestra that is playing a different
[28:36] instrument
[28:38] but they're all being led by the same
[28:40] exact Spirit you mean Republicans didn't
[28:42] put Donald Trump in the White House no
[28:44] they sure didn't you mean that Democrats
[28:46] didn't put doesn't matter if it's Joe
[28:47] Biden Donald Trump it doesn't matter who
[28:50] it is
[28:51] there's only one spirit that is
[28:53] controlling there's only one prop book
[28:55] of Prophecy that is controlling the
[28:58] whole world now brother Brandon would
[29:00] say you're either under one or two
[29:02] spirits
[29:03] you're influenced by one or two things
[29:06] not not three not four not five
[29:08] brother random said everything in your
[29:10] life you're either controlled from above
[29:13] or from beneath
[29:16] everything the clothes you wear the
[29:18] things that you put on your body the
[29:20] things that you listen to you get in
[29:22] your car and you make a decision to turn
[29:23] on a certain type of music let me tell
[29:26] you something friends you're controlled
[29:27] and influenced by either what's from
[29:30] above or what's from beneath I say oh
[29:33] God let my life be subjected only to
[29:36] what's from above let Angels influence
[29:38] me not demon Spirits oh God how many are
[29:41] with me here tonight to say Lord let me
[29:43] be influenced let my decisions and my
[29:46] lifestyle be up be a be a representation
[29:48] of an influence from above oh God
[29:51] [Music]
[29:55] so there's only one or two Spirits he
[29:57] said that are controlling you only one
[30:00] you're you're being influenced by one or
[30:04] the other
[30:06] and so the carnal mind Jesus says is
[30:10] enmity
[30:12] how many knows the Bible
[30:14] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[30:17] that means it's like oil and water this
[30:19] is Romans actually Romans chapter 8 the
[30:21] Bible Paul speaks it and says that the
[30:24] the carnal mind you say brother Matt
[30:26] what I don't what's a what's a column
[30:29] who has a carnal mind
[30:31] every person that's a human please raise
[30:35] your hand
[30:37] those of you that aren't humans and
[30:39] you're aliens or whatever you are here
[30:40] tonight you can keep your hand up
[30:42] do you know that every person in this
[30:44] building that just raised their hands
[30:45] has a carnal mind
[30:49] all of you you were born with you mean
[30:50] the Holy Ghost doesn't take that away
[30:52] from me no you get the mind of Jesus but
[30:54] brother random says you'll have this
[30:55] this rotten flesh will bother you until
[30:57] the day that you die a cockle burn
[31:00] nature he said the inside is a seed of
[31:01] God but the outside has a sticky nature
[31:06] to be carnally minded the Bible says is
[31:09] death
[31:11] but to be spiritually minded is life is
[31:14] that what the Bible says it says to be
[31:17] spiritually minded is life and peace
[31:21] because the carnal mind is enmity
[31:25] against God for it's not subject to the
[31:29] law of God nor indeed can be
[31:34] that means you can't train it you can't
[31:36] discipline it you can't force it you
[31:39] can't make it it is in its own nature
[31:42] and efforts of essence brother by Adam
[31:44] says and why I'm against organized
[31:45] religion 1962 the wisdom that man can
[31:49] accumulate to prove and to show all
[31:51] these things why man should do this and
[31:53] man should do that it's contrary and
[31:56] enmity the carnal mind to God so what
[32:00] did the prophet say after enmity meant
[32:01] it meant to be contrary brother random
[32:04] says it means it means Romans 8 it means
[32:07] it's contrary to the word of God let me
[32:09] just stop here for a minute and just say
[32:11] that the Apostle Paul was saying that
[32:13] the carnal mind was the the Apostle Paul
[32:16] did not say that the carnal mind is at
[32:19] enmity with God
[32:21] but he said it's enmity it's self
[32:26] he put it even stronger than that and
[32:28] said the carnal mind is enmity against
[32:33] God
[32:36] it's not black but Blackness it's not at
[32:40] enmity but it's enmity itself it's not
[32:44] corrupt it's corruption
[32:48] it's not rebellious it's Rebellion
[32:53] I'm going to preach I'm just going to
[32:54] keep on preaching
[32:56] this is the carnamine the human mind
[32:58] it's not rebellious it's it's
[33:01] self-rebellion it's not Wicked it's
[33:05] wickedness
[33:08] the heart though it be deceitful is
[33:10] positively deceit it is evil in the
[33:13] concrete sin in the essence
[33:19] it's not envy envious against God it's
[33:22] in the itself it's not at enmity it's
[33:27] actually enmity
[33:31] brother Adam says here then they bound
[33:33] the church with another Court as Delilah
[33:35] did and they begin instead of having God
[33:37] called men who were called by the Holy
[33:39] Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs but
[33:41] they knowed Christ then the church got
[33:44] stylish and fashioned after the
[33:47] political speakers and they had to give
[33:49] their preachers doctors degrees and
[33:50] everybody had to be a doctorate of
[33:52] divinity that was another Court to bind
[33:54] the church men go off and study each
[33:57] Seminary tries to produce a better
[33:59] scholar so that their churches can brag
[34:01] our pastor is the doctor of divinity and
[34:04] what they what what did they do one
[34:06] would try to have more knowledge than
[34:08] the other well that doesn't mean
[34:09] anything in the sight of God there's no
[34:12] for no need for any man to try to take
[34:14] his worldly knowledge and ever please
[34:16] God with it it's an abomination in the
[34:19] sight of God you'll never please God
[34:21] with the worldly Ambitions of knowledge
[34:24] because it's enmity to God
[34:28] it's sort of like we read this morning
[34:30] when Peter says Silver and Gold Have I
[34:32] None but such as I have give I unto you
[34:36] know what the modern church can say
[34:37] today power of God Have I None but
[34:40] silver and gold give I to you
[34:45] the very opposite a church that was rich
[34:47] increased with Goods would have need of
[34:50] nothing listen what the prophet says
[34:51] here there's no need for any man to try
[34:53] to take his worldly knowledge he says
[34:55] and each one tries to have all the
[34:57] knowledge they know just what to do the
[35:00] words to say and it becomes just a
[35:03] political speech
[35:04] in the stead of a powerly demonstrated
[35:08] Holy Spirit message that sinks to the
[35:12] heart of a man and discovers his sins I
[35:16] say God give us a powerful message that
[35:19] sinks to the very heart of man and
[35:22] Pricks him in his heart and he says what
[35:24] must I do to be saved
[35:29] I'm just going to keep reading him this
[35:30] is so good I don't want to skip over
[35:32] brother random says we don't need that
[35:34] Paul said the word come to us not only
[35:36] are the gospel in word only but through
[35:39] the power and the manifestation of the
[35:41] Holy Ghost that brought the gospel
[35:43] demonstrating the power of the Holy
[35:46] Ghost but all these men go off to
[35:48] seminaries and they learn great
[35:49] education how they must stand before the
[35:51] people and how they must prevent present
[35:53] themselves how they must stand before
[35:55] and he says and how they must stress and
[35:57] how they must act and they should never
[35:59] use the wrong grammar now that's all
[36:01] right
[36:03] for a political speech
[36:06] but we're not after the enchanted words
[36:09] of man I say Amen brother Adam
[36:11] Paul said the gospel that I preached I
[36:13] didn't come like that but it came
[36:15] through the renewing of the Holy Ghost
[36:16] and the power and demonstrations does it
[36:18] come by a right form of speech that your
[36:20] wisdom would be or your trust would be
[36:22] in the wisdom of a man but it come
[36:23] through the demonstrations of the power
[36:26] of the Risen Christ that's the gospel to
[36:28] know him
[36:30] in the power of his resurrection
[36:34] and so brother Madam says this this is a
[36:37] this is this is so powerful here I'm
[36:38] just gonna stop here just for a moment
[36:40] and maybe take a a little turn but it
[36:43] was so so amazing to me as I was seeing
[36:45] a video of a man a pastor of a massive
[36:48] mega church and he's got thousands of
[36:51] people there uh in his in his assembly
[36:53] and he's just a modern day uh uh Church
[36:56] theorem and he's up there talking and
[36:58] he's gonna try to address the the trans
[37:01] community and the homosexual and lgbt2
[37:05] uh well I'm not even going to try to say
[37:07] it uh Community any any and he's and
[37:09] he's gonna this is good man I'm not not
[37:11] criticizing him but I just thought how
[37:13] pitiful it was you see I watch him as he
[37:16] gets up there and he says we just want
[37:17] to give a message to our trans Community
[37:20] we want to give them something that just
[37:22] to say something and he says him he says
[37:24] I just want to show the community that
[37:26] we love you
[37:29] and we understand you
[37:31] and and and and we just want you to know
[37:34] that trans people are welcome here
[37:39] and I just sat there and watched this
[37:41] man as you can tell every word was so
[37:43] measured and so careful and he was just
[37:46] tiptoeing on everything he could say you
[37:49] imagine the amount of pressure I can't
[37:50] even imagine the amount of pressure that
[37:51] a man's under with thousands of people
[37:53] and got a big congregation and all the
[37:56] expectations that that that were under
[37:58] him and I watched that man as he tried
[38:00] so carefully to dance around it and to
[38:02] be careful over the words that he spoke
[38:04] and be careful of how he worded and be
[38:06] careful of how to set it to make sure
[38:08] that he said it just right and and said
[38:10] it in just the just the right way and
[38:12] and you know we're going to teach you
[38:13] the word and they were just walking on
[38:15] eggshells trying so hard not to offend
[38:18] anybody
[38:20] let me just say this you will never help
[38:23] a demon spirit
[38:25] by petting him
[38:29] oh I should get a loud amen from that
[38:31] you will never help a person like that
[38:34] because you're not dealing with a person
[38:36] you're dealing with a spirit and until
[38:39] you're willing to call it what it is
[38:44] because the spirit loves to be better
[38:49] just pet me more
[38:51] walk around me more I love to hear it
[38:54] that way they love to be Patty caked
[38:59] but let me just say it here today it's a
[39:01] spirit
[39:04] and let me just say men have become if
[39:06] we're not careful we become afraid and
[39:09] let Spirits back us into Corners I'm
[39:12] just going to stop praying be real
[39:13] simple and say more than ever before we
[39:16] need to preach the word of God preach it
[39:18] without fear preach it on a shame preach
[39:22] it boldly my brother and my sister well
[39:24] we need more than ever before and I
[39:26] believe that there are believers and
[39:28] young people here tonight they don't say
[39:30] preach the word of God brother Matt
[39:32] preach it straight preach at Gun Barrel
[39:34] straight don't hold back for my feelings
[39:36] brother Matt
[39:38] preach me the word of God
[39:40] you will never change a disbelieving
[39:43] heart
[39:45] by playing around with it
[39:48] let me quote the words of my good friend
[39:50] feelings are overrated
[39:57] put that on a T-shirt and wear it
[40:00] I said feelings are overrated
[40:05] what we need is the bare knuckle gospel
[40:08] it's the only thing that will set you
[40:10] free I say the bear-knuckled gospel of
[40:14] the truth of the Living God is the only
[40:16] thing that brings power over the kingdom
[40:19] of darkness
[40:21] we have become so afraid to offend
[40:24] people but let me just say this the true
[40:26] gospel
[40:27] the true gospel I'm not talking about a
[40:30] Jesus that's just preached the nominal
[40:32] churches I'm preaching the true word of
[40:34] God the truth of the word of the Gospel
[40:37] has always been and will always be a
[40:41] bold declaration that doesn't care about
[40:44] your feelings
[40:50] and I say

[40:57] with that and say God give me the word

[41:04] true unadulterated word of God give me
[41:08] the bare-knuckled gospel that will

[41:15] free listen friends what did Jesus's
[41:17] gospel get him crowds people popularity
[41:20] it got him hung on a cross
[41:23] what about Peter what about Paul got his
[41:25] head chopped off
[41:27] what did the true gospel where Peter
[41:29] would say I am not ashamed or Paul of
[41:32] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[41:34] and we live in a culture that doesn't
[41:37] want to hear the truth
[41:40] we live in a culture even the carnal
[41:42] mind and listen friends I'm just going
[41:44] to go out and preach it we deal with it
[41:45] right in message churches we deal with
[41:47] spirits of rebellion that wants to hold
[41:49] back or or wants to sit there and resist
[41:52] the word of God and resist the truth of
[41:54] the Gospel but I say more than ever
[41:55] before preach the word of God preach it
[41:58] be instant in season and out of season
[42:00] it's the only thing that'll set you free
[42:05] this is what Paul told Timothy and he
[42:08] warned Timothy I love this so much
[42:09] listen the the the spirit of this age
[42:12] listen I'm so glad to say this we've got
[42:15] a message that we shouldn't be ashamed
[42:17] of we've got a message that we don't
[42:19] have to dance around or move around or
[42:22] be careful with or try not to hurt
[42:24] anybody's feelings we've got a message
[42:26] that came from the throne room of God
[42:27] and I say we are To Boldly declare it we
[42:31] ought to boldly stand for it as we sing
[42:33] the song Take Your stand for the word of
[42:35] God take your stand for the message of
[42:38] the hour it doesn't matter what it costs
[42:40] you it's the only thing that'll bring
[42:42] freedom
[42:44] do you realize what you have
[42:47] is the rapture message
[42:52] do we realize Church what you have is
[42:56] the body change
[42:58] message
[43:03] excites you here tonight
[43:04] what you have is the coming of the Lord
[43:07] message it's the spirit of truth it's
[43:10] the guide it's the things that are to be
[43:12] it's the fullness of the revelation
[43:17] how do we think how do we believe that
[43:22] we will take a Rapture if we're not
[43:24] hearing the Rapture message
[43:28] well I would say I'm going to hide
[43:30] behind this Pulpit but everybody can see
[43:31] me anyway
[43:35] I'm just going to preach the truth come
[43:37] on Church
[43:38] how do we think that we're going to
[43:40] receive a body change when we're not
[43:42] listening to the message that changes
[43:43] your body
[43:46] you say brother Matt you believe the
[43:47] message I believe that Faith cometh by
[43:49] hearing and hearing comes by the word of
[43:51] God and there's no possible way you say
[43:54] how are we going to take a body change
[43:56] you won't how you going to take a
[43:58] Rapture if you're not hearing a Rapture
[43:59] message you won't
[44:03] why did Jesus say over and over again I
[44:05] think it's a spirit in this day and I'm
[44:07] just going to preach it here for a
[44:08] moment and disobeying the Lord you know
[44:09] there's a spirit that Creeps in our
[44:11] churches that say we shouldn't quote the
[44:12] prophet anymore
[44:15] well I knew that'd go over pretty sour
[44:18] so it's all right I was expecting it
[44:20] there's a spirit that says don't quote
[44:22] brother Brandon anymore
[44:24] you know the same exact time there's
[44:25] also a spirit that says preachers don't
[44:27] not ought to preach you ought to this
[44:29] play tapes
[44:32] isn't it amazing that the devil always
[44:34] tries to put a scarecrow up to keep
[44:36] God's family away from the real truth of
[44:38] the animal
[44:40] and we don't believe in playing only
[44:42] playing tapes push play and Obey we
[44:44] don't we we don't believe in that but
[44:46] let me just say here today I push play
[44:48] every day
[44:52] and you better be pushing play every day
[44:54] don't you realize Satan would take
[44:56] something that's so valuable to the
[44:58] family of God and put a scarecrow up to
[45:01] try to back you off of something and
[45:03] push you over into a corner into a ditch
[45:07] and then others say you shouldn't well
[45:09] we shouldn't quote brother Brandon we we
[45:10] can we can we can preach it but we don't
[45:12] have to say brother Branham said let me
[45:14] just tell you Jesus over and over again
[45:16] would say that it might be fulfilled by
[45:19] the words of the prophet
[45:21] you think Jesus didn't quote a prophet
[45:23] Jesus lived and preached the message of
[45:27] prophets
[45:29] all right somebody I said Jesus lived
[45:32] and preached the message of prophets
[45:37] Luke Chapter 18. you don't don't believe
[45:39] me let me give you some scriptures then
[45:41] he took unto him the twelve and said
[45:43] unto them behold we go up to Jerusalem
[45:45] and all things that are written by the
[45:47] prophets concerning the son of man shall
[45:50] be accomplished Luke 24 then he said
[45:53] unto them all fools and slow of heart to
[45:55] believe all that the prophets have
[45:58] spoken
[46:00] Paul says in Acts chapter 3 yea and all
[46:03] the prophets from Samuel and all those
[46:05] that follow after as many as have spoken
[46:08] have likewise foretold of these days
[46:10] John the Baptist in John Matthew chapter
[46:12] 3. now in those days John the Baptist
[46:14] came preaching in the wilderness saying
[46:16] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[46:18] hand for this is the one referred to by
[46:21] Isaiah the prophet
[46:24] I'll just go ahead and say it if Jesus
[46:26] would quote prophets and Paul would
[46:28] quote prophets and John the Baptist
[46:30] quoted prophets I think it's high time
[46:32] we're not ashamed to quote the prophet
[46:34] of God
[46:35] [Applause]
[46:40] don't you realize it was this is the
[46:42] same exact spirit that would come in
[46:44] Acts chapter 2 and try to tell them not
[46:46] to preach from Jesus
[46:48] not to quote from Jesus this is exactly
[46:51] what he says he says no don't you know
[46:53] in Matthew chapter 12 it says that they
[46:56] tried to warn them not to preach in the
[46:58] name of Jesus because he's scared of the
[47:01] name he's scared of what you speak and
[47:03] what you confess and what you say but
[47:05] let me just say this what did Peter say
[47:06] when the word was being fulfilled in
[47:08] Acts 2 the Bible says others mocking
[47:11] said these men are full of new wine uh
[47:13] Peter standing up with 11 lifted up his
[47:16] voice
[47:20] I already said it like this for the
[47:21] matter he was real quiet when he said it
[47:24] and it is real quietly just very calmly
[47:27] oh no he wasn't like he was a very
[47:29] monotone
[47:30] very monotone when he spoke it
[47:33] and he spoke it just like this no
[47:37] he said by the man you believe that we
[47:39] always got to raise a voice no not all
[47:40] the time but I believe when you're
[47:41] declaring the word of God it should be
[47:43] cleared by inspiration and boldness
[47:46] the Bible says that he lifted his voice
[47:51] and said you men of Judea and all the
[47:53] men that dwell at Jerusalem be this
[47:55] known unto you and hearken to my words
[47:58] for these are not drunken as you suppose
[48:00] seeing it's the third hour of the day
[48:01] but this is that which was spoken by the
[48:06] prophet Joel so what was he doing he was
[48:09] prophecy he was relating and resaying
[48:12] what a prophet said because the words of
[48:14] the Prophet were not the words of the
[48:16] Prophet they were the words from the
[48:18] throne room of God and I say today we
[48:20] ought to be unashamed to declare the
[48:23] full counsel of God
[48:28] let me say that Satan doesn't hate
[48:29] preachers
[48:31] nope Satan doesn't hate preachers in
[48:34] fact he's got quite a big crew of them
[48:40] what he hates is what's being preached
[48:48] preach in fact do you realize in this
[48:50] end time the day and age that you're
[48:52] speaking of and I'm talking about 20 23.
[48:55] the day and age you're speaking of in
[48:57] fact the Bible says that it would be
[48:59] Satan who would anoint people's hearts
[49:02] to Heap unto themselves teachers
[49:07] having itching ears
[49:12] this is what it says in second Timothy
[49:13] chapter four I love this so much
[49:16] Timothy I charge thee II Timothy 4 verse
[49:19] 1. I charge thee
[49:23] notice the
[49:24] soberness
[49:26] tough pause the words to Timothy
[49:29] Timothy
[49:31] charge you
[49:32] in other words this isn't a
[49:33] recommendation I'm not just going to
[49:35] give you good free advice and good to
[49:36] Sound Advice Timothy you know what you
[49:38] know it'd probably be a good idea no no
[49:39] no this was important Timothy I charge
[49:43] you
[49:44] in other words I command you
[49:47] I command you Timothy
[49:49] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:53] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[49:56] and his appearing what was he doing he
[49:58] scanned Timothy I want you to know how
[50:00] important this is I want you to know how
[50:02] essential this is
[50:04] I'm going to command you
[50:07] not just by the Lord Jesus Christ but
[50:09] Paul goes on and he says by the judge
[50:11] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[50:13] preach
[50:20] preach the word
[50:22] the word be instant in season
[50:25] out of season
[50:27] reprove
[50:28] rebuke
[50:30] exhort
[50:31] with all along suffering and Doctrine
[50:36] for the time will come when they will
[50:38] not endure sound Doctrine
[50:43] all my friends if you are ever living in
[50:45] the Fulfillment of sex of second Timothy
[50:48] chapter four it's right now
[50:51] for the time will come when they don't
[50:53] want to hear it
[50:54] they want to hear something
[50:56] they don't want to hear the word
[50:59] you know that's what separates and
[51:01] always makes the difference
[51:07] as we said this morning they came for
[51:09] the fishes and lobes but when Jesus
[51:11] began to teach the word
[51:12] oh the Bible says many of them that
[51:14] walked with him walked with they said
[51:15] this is a hard Saiyan who can bear it
[51:19] who can bear the Saiyan did it
[51:22] rationalize it didn't fit
[51:25] with their carnal mind it didn't sound
[51:27] right
[51:29] he says preach the word reprove rebuke
[51:33] exhort for the time will come when they
[51:35] will not endure sound Doctrine but after
[51:38] notice after their own lusts
[51:43] shall Heap unto themselves
[51:46] barstools bar rooms drugs no that's not
[51:49] what we're talking about here don't you
[51:51] realize friends one of the worst Spirits
[51:53] the one of the most binding Spirits a
[51:55] person can receive as a demon Spirit of
[51:58] religion that'll make you more spiritual
[52:00] than you ever were when you sat on a
[52:02] church pew it'll make you more religious
[52:04] because the religion is no longer the
[52:07] Bible or the unfallible word of God the
[52:09] infallible word suddenly now the new
[52:11] denomination a new religion that they're
[52:13] following is the religion of themself
[52:18] because they believe what they think
[52:21] more than anything that is written or
[52:23] said or prophesied
[52:25] this is the day and age that you're
[52:27] living in
[52:28] It's A Dark Day an evil day where men's
[52:30] thoughts the Bible said men would become
[52:33] lovers of their own self
[52:38] I know we've preached on this here
[52:39] before but I'm just going to go over it
[52:41] again it doesn't mean you stand in the
[52:42] mirror and go oh boy I just look so good
[52:45] my goodness look at my look at myself oh
[52:47] boy I'm just such a good looking guy I
[52:49] just look so that's not what it means to
[52:50] love yourself
[52:52] oh no no no it's much more closer than
[52:54] that To Love Yourself is simply to exalt
[52:57] what you think
[52:58] over what's been revealed
[53:04] men shall be lovers of their own self
[53:09] posters proud indignant
[53:15] and they will become lovers of their own
[53:17] self of what they think Paul said
[53:20] Timothy the time will come when they
[53:22] don't want to hear sound Doctrine but
[53:24] after their own lusts they shall Heap to
[53:26] themselves teachers having itching ears
[53:30] and they shall turn away from the truth
[53:32] and shall be turned unto Fables
[53:37] I'm going to read you this from the
[53:39] message translation
[53:41] this is Eugene Peterson not the message
[53:43] of the hour but I'm thankful for this
[53:45] translation called the message
[53:46] you're going to find that there will be
[53:49] times when people will have no stomach
[53:52] for solid teaching
[53:54] but will fill up their bellies on
[53:57] religious junk food
[54:01] and opinions that tickle their fancy
[54:05] they'll turn their backs on the truth
[54:07] and Chase mirages
[54:14] do you realize this is prophesied in the
[54:16] day and age that you live in for
[54:17] instance
[54:18] or people are more content by just
[54:22] rationaling and out well I've got a
[54:23] relationship for God you don't have to
[54:25] tell me I've got my own relationship
[54:27] with the Lord
[54:29] I no doubt that you have a relationship
[54:30] with the Jesus that is not so Church the
[54:32] Jesus of the Bible
[54:35] well you don't have to tell me how to
[54:36] live I got my own relationship and
[54:38] people listen we live in an age where
[54:40] people will just sit in a message Church
[54:42] no matter what's being preached and
[54:43] they'll open their Bible they'll start
[54:44] studying their Bible they'll start
[54:46] writing notes why are the preachers
[54:47] preaching be right on their phone doing
[54:49] their own little thing doing their own
[54:50] little in their own little world
[54:51] disconnected hearing uh no doubt but
[54:54] people have developed the ability to
[54:56] tune out
[54:58] the preaching of the word of God
[55:02] we live in this kind of age where man's
[55:04] mind has been so exalted but do you know
[55:08] what the real truth you know what the
[55:09] real evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[55:11] Ghost is it's not a dance it's not a
[55:13] shout it's not an emotion it's not a
[55:15] sensation it's what are you doing with
[55:18] the word for your age
[55:21] that's the evidence of the baptism of
[55:23] the Holy Ghost what are you doing with
[55:25] the word that's been revealed to you oh
[55:27] come on friends I even think to myself
[55:30] and say what am I doing when the word of
[55:32] God comes and confronts my life and
[55:34] confronts my lifestyle and can trench my
[55:37] thinking how am I reacting to that
[55:43] do I humble myself
[55:46] am I able do I have the ability to
[55:49] humble myself
[55:50] and say Lord I humble myself to the word
[55:53] of God
[55:55] render myself to the world
[55:57] or is there something in me that raises
[56:00] up against that and thinks I don't like
[56:01] that too much
[56:04] and if we're not careful we become
[56:05] disclippers of the Bible and we like
[56:07] this part but this part we just clip
[56:09] that out
[56:10] flip I don't like that part over there
[56:12] you might not physically clip it out but
[56:14] I promise you you'll ignore those
[56:15] scriptures
[56:17] you do the same exact thing people do
[56:18] the same thing with the message of the
[56:20] hour that's just the opinion of brother
[56:21] Bannerman I don't really think you know
[56:22] brother man I yeah that was an opinion
[56:24] over here in opinion listen friends it's
[56:25] time we start questioning the word of
[56:27] God and start believing the word of God
[56:29] let me just say this until you believe
[56:31] the word of the hour it can't do you any
[56:34] good anyways
[56:36] if you hold it with a 10-foot pole and
[56:38] question a part over here and question a
[56:40] part over there it can't do you any good
[56:43] Jesus said he that cometh to me must
[56:45] first believe that I am
[56:49] amen
[56:50] [Music]
[56:52] that's the truth brother Matt amen
[56:57] though turn their hearts and Chase
[56:59] mirages listen what he says here but you
[57:03] keep your eye on what you're doing
[57:05] except the hard times along with the
[57:07] good isn't this amazing this is actually
[57:09] what the message translation says from
[57:11] Eugene Peterson keep the message alive
[57:16] praise God
[57:17] do a thorough job as God's
[57:29] what is truth can we go a little bit
[57:31] further is everybody's still here
[57:32] tonight
[57:34] what is truth for the man let me just
[57:37] say if you want victory in your life you
[57:40] have to identify the truth from the lies
[57:43] because all the while the devil is
[57:45] speaking all the while the truth is
[57:48] speaking the devil's speaking right
[57:49] there with it
[57:51] and the devil will be on one side trying
[57:53] to cause you to reason and rationalize
[57:55] and let me say this our in reality your
[57:58] scope of knowledge I don't care what
[58:00] subject it is is very limited I don't
[58:02] care how academically you acquire it all
[58:05] you see is what you can see and what you
[58:07] understand and let me say that if all we
[58:09] see is what we see we really don't see
[58:12] all there is to be seen
[58:14] since this is a spiritual battle it's an
[58:17] invisible War
[58:22] go through our PowerPoint if you could
[58:23] brother Matt brother uh the brother
[58:25] there in the back who's ever controlling
[58:26] that I just want to come to something
[58:28] here and then we'll close
[58:30] Pilots therefore this is John 18 verse
[58:32] 37. pilate therefore said unto him art
[58:35] thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[58:38] sayest that I am a king to the Ascend
[58:40] would to this end was I born and for
[58:42] this cause came I into the world that I
[58:45] should bear witness of the unto the
[58:47] truth everyone that uh everyone that is
[58:51] of the truth
[58:52] heareth my voice
[58:55] so this is a question that philosophers
[58:57] and researchers and Men even today ask
[59:00] the same question I haven't been asking
[59:02] for centuries the same question pilate
[59:04] asks it's the same question what is real
[59:07] what am I what is this do I just think
[59:10] that I'm here am I actually here is this
[59:13] really taking place what is real brother
[59:15] man what is what is this the same
[59:17] question we ask about religion
[59:19] because our religion claims that there's
[59:22] only one God
[59:25] another religion claims that there's 30
[59:28] million gods
[59:31] so which one's right
[59:36] another one claims there's no God at all
[59:40] you see the LIE
[59:42] right mixed in with the truth
[59:45] of the devil
[59:47] oh boy it's quiet in here that's all
[59:49] right
[59:51] the real question is not what we believe
[59:54] the real question it doesn't matter
[59:56] listen it's not what you think or what
[59:58] you rationalize as pilate had this
[1:00:00] skepticism that many people would have
[1:00:01] today to say what is truth how do you
[1:00:04] know how do you find out how can you
[1:00:06] know the answer to pilate's question was
[1:00:09] standing ten feet in front of him
[1:00:13] because Jesus said I
[1:00:16] am
[1:00:20] aha so truth is a person
[1:00:26] I said truth is a person
[1:00:29] he's the person
[1:00:31] of Jesus Christ oh listen to me friends
[1:00:34] uh you you want to talk about some of
[1:00:36] these things that we face today the
[1:00:38] first is this rationalism I want you to
[1:00:40] skip on down if you could to the slide
[1:00:42] that says what is truth you know if you
[1:00:44] would have asked the apostles and the
[1:00:46] days of Jesus and if we could come there
[1:00:48] and somehow use a time machine and
[1:00:50] travel back in time and be there in the
[1:00:52] book of Acts and you were to ask any of
[1:00:54] the Apostles and you were to ask that
[1:00:57] simple question that's asked today and
[1:00:59] you were to say what is uh the truth
[1:01:01] they would have one simple answer
[1:01:05] this is truth
[1:01:09] well anyways I believe it I hope
[1:01:11] somebody online believes it too
[1:01:14] come on can I get an amen here anybody
[1:01:16] here y'all still awake
[1:01:18] if you would ask them they would say
[1:01:20] God's word is truth because no one
[1:01:22] questioned what the word of God was
[1:01:25] no one questioned what truth was because
[1:01:27] they knew truth was a person it was in
[1:01:30] the Reformation that people rose up and
[1:01:33] said truth isn't what the church says it
[1:01:35] is but truth is the word this is
[1:01:38] rationalism this is what it means but
[1:01:41] then a few hundred years ago there was a
[1:01:44] great shift in our world
[1:01:46] whether you're aware of that young
[1:01:48] people here tonight there was a great
[1:01:49] shift in our world of what truth was we
[1:01:53] call this the enlightenment
[1:01:56] I think it's more of an indarkenment but
[1:02:00] the enlightenment
[1:02:02] it was the shift was truth is no longer
[1:02:06] what God tells us it is but it's what we
[1:02:09] find out for ourself
[1:02:13] to put it simply human reasoning has
[1:02:17] replaced divine revelation
[1:02:20] you can no longer accept what the word
[1:02:22] teaches but you thought of it you think
[1:02:25] of it for yourself you use your own
[1:02:28] critical thinking
[1:02:35] you use your own rationale or let me say
[1:02:38] what others say you just use common
[1:02:40] sense God gave us common sense and
[1:02:41] Common Sense will lead us to the truth
[1:02:46] truth is what I think it is
[1:02:48] let me say that's the heart of
[1:02:50] rationalism
[1:02:52] it makes man his own God
[1:02:55] whether he would ever admit that listen
[1:02:57] you think a lying demon Spirit would
[1:02:59] ever tell that man that you're your own
[1:03:01] God no no no he would hide that from
[1:03:02] that man but let me say the worst Spirit
[1:03:04] and the most binding Spirit you could
[1:03:05] ever get is a religious spirit
[1:03:07] and it's so blinding to the person that
[1:03:10] don't realize they've exalted what they
[1:03:12] think
[1:03:16] it makes man his own God because now he
[1:03:19] can discover Truth for himself
[1:03:22] he didn't need God to help him do it he
[1:03:25] can Discover it with the use of the mind
[1:03:27] and the human faculties and intellect
[1:03:29] through his own five senses which of
[1:03:32] course opened up the field to science
[1:03:38] let me say this here for a moment to
[1:03:40] young people all the original scientists
[1:03:42] most of the most of the original
[1:03:43] scientists were not atheists
[1:03:46] they believed in God
[1:03:49] come on that's the truth you can look at
[1:03:51] that historically most scientists
[1:03:53] believed in God you could look at men
[1:03:55] like Galileo and Isaac Newton and and
[1:03:57] and bacon and Copernicus these were men
[1:04:00] who believed in God they believed in a
[1:04:01] higher power
[1:04:03] but that Revelation that that
[1:04:04] rationalism led to the next ISM in our
[1:04:08] age called deism deism is simply the
[1:04:11] belief in the existence of a Supreme
[1:04:13] Being specifically of a Creator who
[1:04:16] doesn't intervene in the universe at all
[1:04:19] he's just a Creator somewhere up way up
[1:04:22] there in the in the Milky Way somewhere
[1:04:24] in the misty blue but he's not
[1:04:25] intimately acquainted nor does he care
[1:04:27] about the Affairs of mankind
[1:04:29] this term used uh chiefly I'm pulling
[1:04:33] some of this straight from uh you know
[1:04:34] some different sources so I can give you
[1:04:36] some of the sources later if you want
[1:04:37] them I just thought it was really good
[1:04:39] really powerful and so the this this
[1:04:41] rational or This deism this term is
[1:04:44] chiefly of an intellectual movement of
[1:04:48] the 17th and 18th century that accepted
[1:04:51] the existence of a Creator on the basis
[1:04:54] of reason but be rejected the belief in
[1:04:57] a supernatural deity who interacts with
[1:05:01] mankind
[1:05:03] it simply means that God created the
[1:05:06] world but he's no longer in control of
[1:05:07] the world
[1:05:08] sort of like a clock that you just wind
[1:05:10] up and God just wound up the clock of
[1:05:12] time sort of like a timer and it is put
[1:05:14] it down and it just sort of unwinds and
[1:05:15] whines and whines and wines that sort of
[1:05:17] wind itself out and eventually it'll
[1:05:19] stop and it's just wound up and you know
[1:05:21] many of these scientists believe many of
[1:05:24] these scientists even even themselves
[1:05:27] believe that God himself couldn't change
[1:05:29] the order of nature so they gave their
[1:05:31] minds over to discover the laws of
[1:05:34] nature and to become very proud in their
[1:05:36] discoveries
[1:05:38] very proud of what the human reasoning
[1:05:40] and so by reasoning we became the people
[1:05:43] in charge
[1:05:46] of our universe
[1:05:49] the same place where you go globalist
[1:05:51] and global warming and we're we're in
[1:05:53] control of our destiny and the worlds
[1:05:55] eventually they believe in a in a
[1:05:57] apocalyptic age in the end of the world
[1:05:59] in the end of time but but but but
[1:06:01] people we can control that if we just
[1:06:03] make the right changes in the right
[1:06:04] steps listen friend I don't care how
[1:06:06] much you think you can control it you
[1:06:08] can't
[1:06:09] I don't care how much you could control
[1:06:11] climate you can't control it I don't
[1:06:13] care how much you think you can control
[1:06:14] listen to me friends uh Putin is not in
[1:06:17] control of the end of the world Putin to
[1:06:20] me say he has a hand over that that
[1:06:21] button and oh my goodness if one person
[1:06:23] listen Putin's finger's not on that
[1:06:25] button I'm going to tell you whose
[1:06:26] fingers on it Jehovah Jireh that's his
[1:06:28] fingers on the button and when he says
[1:06:31] the end is the end that's when it's all
[1:06:32] over
[1:06:34] and it won't happen a day before God
[1:06:36] says that it's over can you say Amen
[1:06:39] and so this introduced the age
[1:06:42] and by reason and we become the people
[1:06:44] in charge of our universe in other words
[1:06:47] the authority of human reason took over
[1:06:50] from the authority of divine revelation
[1:06:54] and this introduced us into the age of
[1:06:57] skepticism
[1:06:59] that's prophesied in the Bible actually
[1:07:01] prophesied in the in the book of Jude
[1:07:03] prophesied in other places that that
[1:07:06] that men would creep in unawares and men
[1:07:09] who were foreign
[1:07:10] ordained of this condemnation and so
[1:07:13] people no longer would believe a thing
[1:07:16] just because they're told a thing but
[1:07:19] they want to find out for themselves
[1:07:22] that whether it appeals to their logic
[1:07:25] or whether it appeals to their rationale
[1:07:27] whether they can understand it or not
[1:07:29] all friends you sell yourself so short
[1:07:30] if you only believe in what you can
[1:07:33] understand
[1:07:36] we sell ourselves so short if we'll only
[1:07:38] let our faith reach to the border of our
[1:07:41] own understanding
[1:07:43] Peter couldn't walk on water until he
[1:07:44] stopped under believing only what he
[1:07:46] could understand he had to get out of
[1:07:49] the boat and leave his own think and
[1:07:50] stink and thinking behind and say if God
[1:07:52] said it I believe it that settles it
[1:07:58] in fact what happens notice this here
[1:08:01] it have what happens is the result of
[1:08:04] rationalism is that we become with the
[1:08:07] creation we we we worship the creation
[1:08:10] but we forget the Creator
[1:08:13] because science can tell you nothing
[1:08:15] about the Creator it can only tell you
[1:08:17] about the creation
[1:08:19] which has changed our vision from heaven
[1:08:23] to Earth
[1:08:26] do you know this is what the devil wants
[1:08:28] to get you to do to change your vision
[1:08:29] that should always be upward
[1:08:32] and get you to look downward
[1:08:35] and when Satan can get your head from
[1:08:37] looking from the things above and the
[1:08:39] things that are beyond your own
[1:08:41] understanding it can get you down to
[1:08:42] look at only what you see in the here
[1:08:44] and now he's really got you then
[1:08:50] and this great shift in humanity moved
[1:08:54] from there and it moved from divine
[1:08:57] revelation to human reasoning I can't
[1:08:59] understand it
[1:09:01] so it must not be true
[1:09:03] or you've got to explain that to me
[1:09:05] before I can believe that it's true
[1:09:08] the reaction of rationalism
[1:09:11] is what's called a movement of
[1:09:13] Romanticism
[1:09:15] it's called the romantic era
[1:09:18] and Romanticism it was an artistic uh
[1:09:22] literary Musical and it was an
[1:09:24] intellectual movement but not just
[1:09:26] intellectual it was started to stir the
[1:09:29] intellect and move into the emotional
[1:09:31] Realm
[1:09:33] and it originated in Europe towards the
[1:09:36] end of the 18th century in most areas it
[1:09:38] was at its peak and maybe around 1800 to
[1:09:41] 1850 and some of the main
[1:09:43] characteristics of romantic literature
[1:09:45] they include a focus on the writer or
[1:09:48] the narrator's emotions and inner world
[1:09:51] and it's the celebration of Nature and
[1:09:54] beauty and Imagination the rejection of
[1:09:56] into of organized religion and
[1:09:59] rationalism and social convention it's
[1:10:02] as humans aren't just thinking creatures
[1:10:04] they're also feeling creatures
[1:10:08] and so I'm not going to believe it
[1:10:10] unless I feel it
[1:10:13] okay
[1:10:16] you see some people only believe it if
[1:10:18] they understand it others believe it
[1:10:19] only it's only true if I can feel it
[1:10:24] and so it says humans they're they're in
[1:10:27] reality they they need to music should
[1:10:30] be felt and it should art should be felt
[1:10:33] and what is true is what I feel is true
[1:10:39] and so there came not just a desire for
[1:10:41] a scientific explanation of things but a
[1:10:44] desire to experience
[1:10:46] things
[1:10:48] because people want to feel something
[1:10:50] they don't feel it's re they don't feel
[1:10:52] it's real unless they felt it
[1:10:57] hello
[1:11:00] that's even sometimes the test some
[1:11:01] people apply to worship well only if I
[1:11:03] feel that I'm really worshiping you know
[1:11:05] friends some of the most powerful
[1:11:07] worship you could ever do is when you
[1:11:08] don't feel like it at all when you feel
[1:11:10] complete a million miles away from God
[1:11:12] but something in you raises your hands
[1:11:14] anyways and you clap your hands anyways
[1:11:17] sometimes you don't want to say Amen to
[1:11:18] the word of God but just say Amen
[1:11:20] anyways sometimes God could do more out
[1:11:23] of that kind of Praise than he could
[1:11:24] ever do out of an emotional feel a
[1:11:26] worked up praise but it comes from the
[1:11:28] very inner core of your being and you
[1:11:31] say God you're worthy of my praise
[1:11:33] whether I can feel you or not you're
[1:11:35] worthy of my adoration whether I consent
[1:11:38] you or not
[1:11:40] because what is true is it's only what I
[1:11:43] feel
[1:11:49] it hasn't been good a good church
[1:11:51] service unless we felt it
[1:11:56] well sometimes you do feel it just
[1:11:58] sometimes you don't feel good sometimes
[1:12:00] you leave church and you feel bad
[1:12:01] because you feel convicted you feel beat
[1:12:03] up you know sometimes the word of God
[1:12:05] does that to us and we ought to be able
[1:12:06] to receive it as children when the word
[1:12:08] of God comes for correction that's just
[1:12:10] as powerful as when it comes for
[1:12:12] encouragement
[1:12:13] foreign
[1:12:16] and so Romanticism said I've got to fill
[1:12:18] it
[1:12:19] so you had the cold clinical academic
[1:12:23] intellectual rationalism which led to
[1:12:26] the field of science and then we had
[1:12:28] Romanticism which led to the field of
[1:12:30] arts and painting and music
[1:12:32] and these were to help us fill our
[1:12:35] reality of what was around us and so
[1:12:38] people look to the world around us and
[1:12:41] they want to feel it they want to they
[1:12:42] want to absorb it we need to feel the
[1:12:44] music and and it's powerful it's true
[1:12:46] music touches you at a very emotional
[1:12:48] level rather than an intellectual level
[1:12:50] and and it's just like artwork as we
[1:12:52] were saying on on Saturday night you
[1:12:54] know Modern Art uh uh you should I've
[1:12:58] even heard it said you can't understand
[1:12:59] Modern Art
[1:13:01] and if you misunderstand it that's when
[1:13:03] you've understood it
[1:13:07] I said that you know to someone and they
[1:13:09] were they was at their house and they
[1:13:11] had a painting and I was sitting there
[1:13:12] going brother can I be honest with you I
[1:13:15] don't get it
[1:13:17] and he said that means you got it
[1:13:22] okay
[1:13:22] if you don't get it that means you
[1:13:24] understand it
[1:13:26] all right
[1:13:27] I guess I got it then you keep it
[1:13:33] but what it's saying is is that the
[1:13:35] world doesn't make sense and I look at
[1:13:37] it and it's crazy and it's nonsensical
[1:13:39] and the world doesn't make sense and you
[1:13:41] don't have to understand you don't have
[1:13:42] to understand it because you can feel it
[1:13:45] so you have these approaches these are
[1:13:47] all the approaches to what is truth
[1:13:50] rationalism says truth is what I can
[1:13:52] learn or understand Romanticism says
[1:13:55] it's what I can feel then Jesus steps
[1:13:57] and walks right through the middle of
[1:13:58] both of them and says no I am the truth
[1:14:02] I am the way I am the person and I
[1:14:06] contradict both of these the only truth
[1:14:08] is and revealed in one person and it's
[1:14:11] not what you understand and it's not
[1:14:13] necessarily what you feel it's what
[1:14:15] Revelation says of the word of God of
[1:14:17] who he said that he was and something
[1:14:19] inside of me that goes beyond my feeling
[1:14:21] and goes beyond my intellect says amen
[1:14:24] Lord I believe the word of God yes Lord
[1:14:27] I can't explain it I might not feel it
[1:14:30] but I know it's true I know that I know
[1:14:32] that I know that it's true
[1:14:36] because I know the person of Truth
[1:14:40] when Jesus comes to Peter and he comes
[1:14:43] to Andrew and here's these fishermen
[1:14:44] fishing and they're casting their Nets
[1:14:46] on the water the Bible doesn't say hey
[1:14:48] hey you know Jesus walked up to these
[1:14:50] guys and said hey uh hey uh excuse me uh
[1:14:54] excuse me sorry not to bother you and
[1:14:56] Peter sort of looked over there you know
[1:14:58] well he wasn't doing this I guess he was
[1:15:00] more doing this with his net
[1:15:03] you know hey guys uh I I sorry to bother
[1:15:06] you and and what what do you got to say
[1:15:07] bud what's on your mind well I just want
[1:15:09] to I want to show you if I could show
[1:15:11] you this scroll over here uh you know
[1:15:13] could you just take a minute just to
[1:15:14] read it just hear from look over here in
[1:15:16] Isaiah I want you to read over here in
[1:15:17] the book of Isaiah you see all it says
[1:15:19] over here that behold the uh you know a
[1:15:22] prince of peace a governor a child shall
[1:15:25] be born and and he'll be the prince of
[1:15:27] he'll be the prince of peace and the
[1:15:28] government will be upon his shoulders
[1:15:30] and you'll see how yeah I see that Jesus
[1:15:32] yeah yeah I see all that over there yeah
[1:15:34] you know over here Jeremiah and even
[1:15:36] David begins to prophesy can you turn to
[1:15:38] the psalm Jesus pulls out a scroll of
[1:15:40] the psalm and starts to get him to read
[1:15:41] the Simon and then Jesus says you see it
[1:15:43] now look over here if I compare Isaiah
[1:15:45] and then I compare Jeremiah and then you
[1:15:48] bring the psalm over here or where David
[1:15:49] said this and and then Isaiah said this
[1:15:52] guys guys do you see it
[1:15:55] do you do you see it it's me
[1:15:58] it's me
[1:16:00] and then Peter it goes yeah
[1:16:02] you know maybe maybe that might you know
[1:16:05] what let me get back to you let me go
[1:16:07] home and pull out my my book of the law
[1:16:08] and let me begin to study it and I'm
[1:16:10] gonna I think if I read me you know me
[1:16:12] you know me does the bible say that
[1:16:13] that's how Jesus revealed himself to his
[1:16:15] children no the Bible says he simply
[1:16:17] spoke their names and said come follow
[1:16:20] me and the Bible says immediately they
[1:16:23] dropped their Nets they left everything
[1:16:25] that they thought before and they
[1:16:27] followed Jesus why my sheep know my
[1:16:30] voice and a stranger they will not
[1:16:33] follow I said my sheep know my voice and
[1:16:36] a stranger they will not follow
[1:16:40] because when truth revealed to you no
[1:16:43] devil can take it from you
[1:16:48] no devil not an opinion not of what
[1:16:51] somebody thinks but brother Branham says
[1:16:54] it's got to be in something that's
[1:16:55] revealed to you something that
[1:16:57] transforms you something that changes
[1:16:59] your very nature something that takes
[1:17:01] you from the creature that you were and
[1:17:03] you can say I may not be what I ought to
[1:17:05] be but I know I ain't what I used to be
[1:17:07] I know there's been a real change down
[1:17:10] inside of my heart because I met the
[1:17:12] person of Truth
[1:17:15] God transform us today by your power
[1:17:19] this is slide four by the renewing of
[1:17:21] her mind to turn from the meager
[1:17:23] elements of this world now unto the word
[1:17:26] of God and may we be renewed by the
[1:17:29] transforming power oh how many want to
[1:17:31] raise a hand and say Lord that's my
[1:17:33] prayer let me be renewed by transforming
[1:17:35] power upon the seed that's in our heart
[1:17:38] that we believe under creatures called
[1:17:40] Sons and Daughters of God this is my
[1:17:43] prayer to you father for the people in
[1:17:45] Jesus name amen
[1:17:49] listen to what he says now to you that's
[1:17:51] out in the broadcast wherever you are I
[1:17:54] want you to receive Christ out there as
[1:17:57] your personal savior
[1:18:02] and stop there
[1:18:05] come on somebody help me preach
[1:18:08] receive him as your personal Savior and
[1:18:11] stop there oh no brother in fact if you
[1:18:13] stop there you're in one of the most
[1:18:15] dangerous places you can ever be
[1:18:18] because God didn't just want you to
[1:18:20] accept him to be justified and just
[1:18:23] accept him and say I accept Jesus in my
[1:18:25] heart and what does that mean I've
[1:18:26] repeated a sinner's prayer and you know
[1:18:28] what you do you get a person the Bible
[1:18:30] says one of the most dangerous places
[1:18:32] you can be
[1:18:34] is cleaned
[1:18:36] but empty
[1:18:40] one of the most dangerous places you can
[1:18:43] be it's cleaned
[1:18:45] but empty
[1:18:47] that's why even in the book of uh of
[1:18:49] Matthew and the Bible speaks of a
[1:18:51] Matthew chapter 12 it says when an
[1:18:53] unclean spirit is gone out of a man he
[1:18:55] goes through Dry places seeking rest
[1:18:58] and when he findeth cometh back and he
[1:19:00] findeth none he finds a house that's
[1:19:02] clean swept clean sanctified
[1:19:05] but nobody in the house
[1:19:08] oh friends what we need more than ever
[1:19:09] before is not just a cleaning we need a
[1:19:12] filling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:15] something that's more than a Doctrine
[1:19:16] something that's more than an emotion
[1:19:18] something that's more than just an
[1:19:19] intellectual understanding but that
[1:19:21] thing that comes on the inside and
[1:19:24] changes your very nature
[1:19:28] I want you to accept him receive him as
[1:19:32] your personal Savior and be filled with
[1:19:36] his spirit
[1:19:39] that's the only way you'll ever know
[1:19:40] truth
[1:19:43] be filled with
[1:19:46] his Spirit the words that's been said
[1:19:49] this morning I'm closing as brother
[1:19:50] Diggs says don't get scared I'm about to
[1:19:52] close
[1:19:54] may they drop into your heart
[1:19:57] and may there you receive Jesus
[1:20:01] and you watch your life
[1:20:05] and you see what you live afterwards
[1:20:09] not what you might receive initially
[1:20:11] that's a wonderful thing but watch what
[1:20:14] fruit it produces in your life
[1:20:19] if you think you've received truth and
[1:20:21] it produces corruption you've never
[1:20:23] received truth
[1:20:25] watch what you live afterwards and take
[1:20:29] the thinking man's filter you see
[1:20:31] yourself doing something that's contrary
[1:20:33] to this word move from it right quick
[1:20:38] because there's a filter that keeps
[1:20:40] death away from you and that's God's
[1:20:42] words his words are life and they will
[1:20:45] keep you from death
[1:20:48] what we need to convince them then
[1:20:50] concern 1962 what we need is a candle
[1:20:53] lighting time the power of the Holy
[1:20:56] Ghost instead of so much of this
[1:20:58] man-made Dogma theological training I'm
[1:21:01] convinced that's what the people needs
[1:21:02] whether he knows his ABCs or not whether
[1:21:06] he knows beans from split coffee if he
[1:21:10] will just let that candle get lit God
[1:21:13] will take care of the rest of it
[1:21:16] you say what do I got to do brother Matt
[1:21:17] just let that candle get lit God will
[1:21:19] take care of the rest of it what do I
[1:21:21] got to do to know the Lord just let that
[1:21:23] candle get lit say God I want to get my
[1:21:25] candle lit here tonight I want to be
[1:21:27] filled with all the fullness of God that
[1:21:29] I may know him as Paul said in the power
[1:21:32] of his resurrection and then God will
[1:21:34] take care of the rest of it friend
[1:21:37] God will take care of the rest
[1:21:40] of the blind man that Jesus healed he
[1:21:41] couldn't argue them pre-theology they
[1:21:44] come up all them preached around and
[1:21:45] said you know here's Dr so and so you
[1:21:47] belong to a certain church he couldn't
[1:21:49] argue their theology they said well we
[1:21:52] know this man's a sinner we know he is
[1:21:55] he don't who are they calling a sinner
[1:21:57] Jesus
[1:22:00] we know this man's a sinner he don't
[1:22:03] agree with our teaching what does he do
[1:22:05] he deceives our people he leads them
[1:22:08] astray we know he's a sinner brother he
[1:22:10] couldn't argue theology but he was sure
[1:22:13] convinced he could see
[1:22:16] I said he couldn't argue theology but he
[1:22:19] was sure convinced where once he was
[1:22:21] blind now he can see
[1:22:24] I may not have all the answers I may not
[1:22:26] have all the questions right I may not
[1:22:28] be able to line it all up and cross all
[1:22:30] my T's and Dot all my eyes but here's
[1:22:32] what I know that I know that I know I
[1:22:35] was once blind but now I see I say thank
[1:22:38] God that God has given me eyes to see
[1:22:41] ears to understand ears to hear the word
[1:22:44] of God I say I'll trade it for any
[1:22:46] education I'll trade it for any college
[1:22:48] degree it's more important than anything
[1:22:51] you could ever do in your life young
[1:22:52] person
[1:22:54] it's greater than any degree that you
[1:22:55] can get to know him is life not to know
[1:22:59] his word to know him and the power
[1:23:02] of his resurrection musicians could you
[1:23:04] come
[1:23:05] brother random says he couldn't argue
[1:23:07] theology but he was sure convinced he
[1:23:09] could see
[1:23:10] I think that's the main thing today I
[1:23:14] can't tell you where I ought to be and
[1:23:16] whether you have to be this or be that
[1:23:18] but we're certainly convinced that we
[1:23:21] got something
[1:23:23] oh Hallelujah
[1:23:25] amen Lord I'm so convinced I may not be
[1:23:29] able to understand it all but here's
[1:23:30] what I know you say brother Matt what do
[1:23:32] you know I know I'm not who I used to be
[1:23:34] I know something's got a hold of my life
[1:23:36] and it won't let me go I know something
[1:23:38] changed my nature it changed my desires
[1:23:41] it changed what I was thirsting for it's
[1:23:44] a real Risen Savior how many Believers
[1:23:46] can identify and say it's real it really
[1:23:49] happened to me the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:51] Ghost it's a real thing that you can
[1:23:53] receive
[1:23:54] and it changes everything in your life
[1:23:57] like the old color lady said brother I I
[1:24:00] want to give a testimony said I hate
[1:24:02] what I ought to be and I ain't what I
[1:24:04] you what I want to be but she said one
[1:24:06] thing I sure know I ain't what I used to
[1:24:09] be
[1:24:09] I think that's good I'm not what I want
[1:24:11] to be I'm not what I ought to be how
[1:24:13] many Believers would stand young person
[1:24:15] and raise your hand and say I I come on
[1:24:18] stand to your feet and say I'm not what
[1:24:19] I ought to be but here's what I know I
[1:24:22] ain't what I used to be
[1:24:25] at least my candles
[1:24:28] oh Lord Jesus we bow our heads here
[1:24:30] before you today
[1:24:32] God in total reverence and total
[1:24:34] obedience wanting to be obedient to your
[1:24:36] word Lord more than anything else oh God
[1:24:39] I pray that you would give us a heart
[1:24:42] that could say Lord I may not understand
[1:24:44] it in fact I may not even feel it
[1:24:47] but I believe it
[1:24:48] with all that's within me
[1:24:51] I believe the word of God I may not be
[1:24:54] able to always live it I may not be
[1:24:56] always able to line up to it in fact
[1:24:59] I've got a life that's full of faults
[1:25:01] and full of failures and and I don't
[1:25:03] always do what's right but here's what I
[1:25:05] know Lord down inside the inside of my
[1:25:07] innermost being I've got a desire to say
[1:25:10] Lord I want to serve you I want to throw
[1:25:13] aside my thinking I want to throw aside
[1:25:15] what I think and what I thought maybe
[1:25:17] even as Paul said I forget everything
[1:25:19] that I've learned to know Jesus
[1:25:22] I want to say tonight Lord
[1:25:25] I love you with all of my heart

[1:25:48] by faith say Lord I want to come subject
[1:25:53] to the Vindicated word of the hour

[1:26:00] to doubt it I don't want to look out I
[1:26:02] don't just want to wonder about it God
