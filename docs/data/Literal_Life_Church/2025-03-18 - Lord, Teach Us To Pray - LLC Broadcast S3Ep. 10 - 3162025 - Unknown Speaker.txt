I want to hear him say well done Luke 11 and verse 1 and I might add in a scripture we've been referring to uh in Philippians chapter 4 but we'll read this one first and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and then it goes into verse two as he begin to say when you pray Our Father which say Our Father which is in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil so it was the disciple here asking the Lord to teach us to pray that's my title this morning Lord teach us to pray and I think it's interesting that we've always called that the Lord's Prayer but it's not really the Lord's Prayer it's the bride's prayer because this is what he told us to pray and then uh something we've been referring to over in Philippians if you just turn there chapter 4 verse 6 says be careful for nothing don't be worried about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus seems like when I was researching more and more of the scriptures that Express the particular time that we live in today which I've called the time of trouble the day of trouble the times of trouble Daniel called it Troublesome times and uh as we look at at that particular season that we live in that it's a great time of trouble it seems like as I keep researching I I'm looking for things of the answer how God wants us to respond to him choosing us to live within these times of trouble and I find it in uh emphasized many times is there's an encouragement for us always to pray uh the biggest emphasis above all the challenges that the is coming from the attack of the enemy and we've talked about the the greatest attack being on our minds and being on our hearts our thoughts and our emotions are under attack uh in this hour in this time of trouble it's our minds it's our thoughts it's our emotions that get that get um and we we've talked about our minds being manipulated by the wisdom of this world and intentional manipulation to form thoughts that are worldly thoughts we talked about our hearts and emotions being clouded being perverted even and being distressed and being surrounded and filled with fear these are all the things that are mentioned in the Bible about this time our minds being attacked with fear and surrounded by fear and men's Hearts failing for fear and distress of Nations and perplexity and our hearts being weighed down these are all terms that I read from the Bible to show you this is particular pressures for our time and our day that we see under this time of trouble but I believe the Lord has provided a place for us to run into and be safe the name of the Lord is a strong tower where in the righteous can run into it and be safe in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and in the secret place of his Tabernacle I'm glad to say that in these times God knew it was coming God knew the hard times God knew the financial trouble God knew all the distress and God said I'll provide a place for my people to run into I'll provide a place for their families I'll provide a place for their soul to rest I'll provide a place that they can come under the protection of my presence can you say amen and they will be safe in that place it's a place to hide it's a place of peace and one of the main things that comes out of these scriptures though is for us to pray for us to pray one of the main responses and resources we are are to pull from is our prayer now this may seem a bit strange because uh brother Paul we know that already we know we're supposed to pray not that we are praying but I as a pastor I want to talk about prayer this morning because sometimes Believe It or Not people do not know how to pray sometimes people know how to pray but they don't know they won't pray because there's many reasons that the devil gives that that holds us back from our prayer but I want to give value to our prayer because in those places in hard times in the time of trouble he his number one thing for us to do is to pray and to keep praying and the term says to always pray to guard our hearts but to always pray and so now we're going to have to have a value that when we go to God that our prayer is going to get through to him we're going to have to watch over a devil who tries to hinder our prayer make us feel unworthy to pray we're going to have to remove those hindrances because I'll tell you we're in a time we're going to have to pray but we're going to have to ensure that our prayer gets through can you say amen and so so now we when we pray we want our prayer to be effective we don't want it to be hindered so I'm LED as a pastor to talk a little bit deeper about prayer because we need the kind of prayer that moves God in these times we need the kind of prayer that getss through to God we need the kind of prayer of faith that goes Deeper Than Just Words Can you say Amen it can't be just words it can't be a ritual it can't have hindrances that somehow that we're unworthy to pray if sometimes there are some situations that we're in in this hour that the only thing that we have left that we have is prayer and so sometimes if the only thing we have left is our prayer we we want to know that we can pray the prayer of faith and we want to know our prayer is going to get [Music] through so I want to talk about that James is the one that refers to the prayer of faith shall save the sick the prayer of faith not just praying not just saying prayers not just repeating prayers but the prayer of faith shall save the sick he goes on to say he says confess our faults one to another and the effectual Fair uh the effectual prayer read it in a minute the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much it's a prayer that'll get through because it's not only a righteous man but it's effectual prayer it's fervent prayer it's supplication prayer it's not saying a quick prayer at dinner say Lord God in the morning say God bless me bless our day we may have to do that but that's not the prayer that we're talking about we're talking about prayer that has supplication behind it it has burden behind it can you say amen and it's a Son of God behind it which God will hear a son and daughter of God we have to have that confidence when we go to pray oh I'm going to have somebody else pray for me somebody else may not be there to pray for you and Believers have a direct line to the throne of God can you say Amen can you raise can you raise your hand I'm a Believer this morning I'm a son and daughter of God did you know you have a direct line to the throne of God God you don't have to go through anybody you don't have to go through the pastor it's nice to have hands laid on and the Bible says that there's sometimes the pastor is not around somebody else is not around you're going to have to know and have confidence that you are a believer that everything's under the blood can you say amen and when I go to pray God hears my prayer we're going to need it more and more in this hour we're going to need it when we don't have anything else to turn to say brother Paul I don't see myself as a a prayer Warrior I think we're all going to have to be molded into prayer warriors how many would like to be a prayer Warrior so in you know when he says the prayer of faith that's that's not just a prayer but that's a confidence when we pray in order to have a confidence when we pray you will need sometimes uh to remove hindrances to your prayer so that the channel is free and clear I believe the channel for prayer should always be stayed free and cleared up that we can go to God at any time and so sometimes there's hindrances uh one thing is that when we have trouble rise in our life sometimes you can have trouble but it's worse to have trouble with your prayer you see because if you had all kinds of trouble but you didn't have trouble with your prayer then you can lean on that you say listen everything's intact everything's in place and and I don't have anything left but to speak to my God from the burden of my heart and know that it gets through it's worse if you have trouble in your life it's worse that you have trouble having confidence in your prayer that's worse because then you're really left with nothing we got to be able to speak to God we got to be able to have confidence when we speak to God we got to be able to talk to him freely um I just mentioned this I didn't have it in my notes but you know some of the things that I look at and stud in in people's lives still studying it and I'm just on a real journey right now because I want to help people more I want to help people's hearts and you know that I preached for years now it spills out over my Ministry to realize people can love the word have the some of the best preaching they can have all that but if there's a hindrance in their heart then it can cause other trouble and it just lays there God wants to deal with our heart so in in research and all these other things sometimes people have trouble once something in their heart is exposed and they realize the devil's using this to hinder me then it that has created a condemnation that they don't have the confidence to pray and be specific in their prayer so I've watched some of these uh these things where they actually lead a person and teach them how to pray and they teach them you should say this and to be honest in your prayer to be to be to to to not try to um how should I say it to make it really sound real holy before God so we answers no God wants you to be real God wants you to be honest even when you've made a mistake he wants you to tell him exactly what you've done don't smooth it over don't make it try to make it holy can you say man he just wants you to talk to him from your heart whatever it is and sometimes people have to be taught because they don't know they smother over their prayers they don't feel worthy to pray they don't know how to talk to God so they have to be coached talk about it this way you don't need any of that you just need to know that you can talk to God honestly from your heart and sometimes they encourage somebody have had bit they've had bitterness towards somebody for years to actually name that person in their prayer people are afraid to do it they're afraid to talk about the person that they've held bitterness for but see when we bring that all kind of like Esther in front of the enemy she exposes her enemy in front of her King payman sitting there and holding this over the Jews and Esther says I want to invite you over for dinner she invites the her King and she invites her enemy and all in the same room she exposes the enemy I think our prayer should be that way we shouldn't hold anything back expose what's wrong in your life this is what I did this is what I said God I'm so sorry for it but I'm not going to let the devil hide behind some Grudge or hide behind something that I'm going to expose this I'm going to be open with it in my prayer people don't really know how to do that sometimes and so maybe that part of it needs to be talked about that sometimes if we are saying like the disciple that day and I'm going to get into this in a minute why he's saying Lord teach us how to pray how many to raise your hand and say Lord if this is all I'm left with sometimes teach me how to pray and you know why they're asking that because when he prayed those Jews those disciples those Pharisees all of them they prayed all the time Jews pray but why are they asking Jesus to teach them how to pray because I'll tell you why number one when he prayed he got through to the father his prayer had results and some of they they got into saying prayers they may had a books of prayers maybe I'm going to copy what the Pharisee I just heard him at synagogue and he prayed so maybe that's my way and They're copying things no no no no no you don't have prayer books can you say Amen you have direct access to the king can you say amen and so they seen they seen the Son of God the Lord and they seen that he was a Son of God and he wasn't afraid to ask whatever he could from the father and he got results when they've seen that say you know I pray but I don't pray like that they said Lord would you just teach us how to pray pray maybe you say in your heart this morning Pastor Could you teach us how to pray because when I pray I want to pray the prayer of faith I want confidence behind my prayer a lot of you people we've got some pray prayer warriors in this church that actually taught me and made me a lot uh um you know how you have peer pressure there's such thing as a good peer pressure and God has put those people in my life that they've grown in areas that I haven't yet and that's good peer pressure because I see man that man's a prayer where all all I hear of him is praying that woman she's got this she's got this strength that I don't have and that's why you get in a body of Christ because don't feel condemnation or guilty or you're less just look and say God's made them to grow further I'm watching that but he said Lord teach us to pray so you know there's a lot of things that you just know so you know let me just say it this way there's we want confidence when we speak to God and there's a lot of items sometimes and you just don't know your god-given rights as a Believer you have god-given rights as a Believer and they are given to you not because you are always perfect those rights have been purchased through Calvary and you have God given rights this morning and Satan tries to steal or question your rights and weigh your rights with whether you're worthy of those rights I want to remind the devil this morning I want to say that to him this morning and encourage you as a Believer you have rights as a Believer and those rights have been purchased through Calvary and they're not weighing upon whether you're perfect or not you have those rights because he's given you those rights and one of those rights is I have a right to pray I have direct access to him Hallelujah so you know sometimes Satan he's stealing our rights or tries to act like that we he's questioning our rights you don't have you don't have worthiness to speak to God this week look what you've done he's a professional at bringing up all of our mistakes he's a professional at condemnation he's a professional of trying to question whether you're a son and daughter of God if Satan did it to Jesus himself he's going to do it to every son and daughter of God if he came blatantly to Jesus and said if you the son of if thou be the Son of God and tried to make him question whether he even was a son if he'll do that to Jesus he's going to do it to you and that's what Satan does he's always and and so we know going to the hindrances we know there's certain hindrances that we know that can be to prayer certainly we one of the standard ones we know is unconfessed sin is a hindrance to prayer you must bring that sin sin underneath the blood so we must put things under the blood but Satan is so clever he he tries to bring you when even when you confessed your sin he's the one that brings you under a certain Penance a certain payback plan it's not a part of the Bible that we do a residual payback for our mistakes is anybody listening here this morning you say well we know no no no listen Believers get struggled sometimes and that is you have to pay back or do penants for something you've done wrong my Bible says if we're if we we repent he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and there is no Penance program there's only one way to be accepted and that's accept what he did for you at Calvary and let him wash away your sins the devil's religion to work off debt debts work different with God Satan twists God's forgiveness and justification say what are you doing brother Paul I'm trying to build confidence in our prayer I'm trying to say that Satan twist up God's forgiveness and justification and he mixes in a repayment plan for debt with interest cuz any of you go get your loans you know it's going to be with interest you can't borrow money unless there's an interest with it if you get a chance to do it without interest you're getting pretty lucky but that's Satan's plan and we know the Bible says debt and interest is slavery the borrower is servant to the lender anytime you put yourself under a bunch of debt you're not going to be free I think I think we should be working and praying to get out of debt as I said there'd be a lot of testimonies here if we gave just the entire service to Money Matters we realize there's tons of testimony people in h 100,000 $200,000 in debt but they begin to take God's structure of the word pay their tithes first put a structure for it pray and when they begin to pray and be faithful and tell every dollar where to go and they got discipline with it I have my own testimonies of a lot of debt with some rental properties somehow by by God's grace today I don't know how I was going to get out of it but God I didn't even deserve it but God helped me and gave me the wisdom to get out of it and today I stand completely debt free and accept my home which I'm working on to pay it all off I'll tell you when you get that paid off you feel free debt is slavery and the devil knows that we got a world that's full of loans and debt and interest on it where does that come from it's Satan's system to bind somebody up and so in your heart he binds you up with a debt payback system for your mistakes and your sins with interest Satan's religion Satan doesn't want you to have rights and no you can't have rights you you're going to pay for years it lingers for years it's because Satan don't want you to feel that you have rights the right to pray the right to be happy God does not have a Penance plan to set up to make you pay for years for your mistakes he he pays it all when a heart asks in sincerity for forgiveness he pays it all paid in full by the blood of the Lamb can you say Amen it's not a residual Penance that you have to do well I need to do this and I need to do that somebody sometimes people even give out of guilt you heard the scripture we should not give out of guilt we should give as a cheer cheerful Giver God loves that kind people give maybe if I help this it'll relieve the guilt of my sin you don't do that to relieve your sin you bring your conf ction to God and when you do then he says the devil says you don't have any rights while you're under that cloud but the de devil says it but God says you have God given rights would you like to hear some of them brother brah says in 1962 I'm an heir of Divine Healing if you guys have that quote I'm an heir of Divine Healing I'm an heir of Joy I've got a right to be happy you have god-given rights Satan wants to take them away but I got a right I'm an heir of Joy I've got a right to be happy so what makes you so happy I've got a right to be that's a good way to tell the devil why are you so happy today well I can't really think of a reason but I got a right to be happy now if you're religious yes I'm an heir to happiness I'm an heir to Joy I'm an heir to peace I'm an air to internal life listen we're not
