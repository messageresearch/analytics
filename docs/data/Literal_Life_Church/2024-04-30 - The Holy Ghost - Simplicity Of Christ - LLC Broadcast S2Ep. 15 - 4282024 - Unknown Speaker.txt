TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi everybody Pastor Paul Le Fontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today Shadows deep and my heart [Music] pleas I will not [Music] qu the way he leads This Side of Heaven we know in power I will not question a broken heart sing it with me we'll talk it over in the by and by we'll talking over my Lord and I I'll last the reason you'll tell tell me why when we talk it over in the by and [Music] by I'll Trust his leading he'll never fail through Darkness tunels or Misty Veil oy his biding and faithful [Music] be the only one step ahead I see we'll talk it over in the by and by we'll talk it all my Lord I I'll ask the reason you tell me why when we talk it over in the by and by I'll ask the reason you tell me [Music] why when we talk it [Applause] over in the by and by in the by and by who am I am by [Applause] for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ and that's the prophet for the age Paul's speaking that that's his purpose that's his agenda is to present the people of God as a chased virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beg Eve through his subtility so your minds should be corrupted notice now he pulls all the way from the fall the beginning and says not just what happened not just that we know what happened but he he looks at how Satan come through his subtility and how he dealt with eve and he's saying that the same Enemy enemy will try to work the same way in you can you say Amen so this is our enemy and in the same way that he beguiled Eve through his subtility so your minds should be corrupted from what from the Simplicity in Christ that your mind should be corrupted now when we think of corruption we think of your mind's being corrupted by the dirtiness of This World by the filthiness by the immorality we think of a corrupt mind and that is that is corrupt those things uh shouldn't we shouldn't look at those things as a Christian because we corrupt our Minds how many knows that the the world and and fornication and adultery and just pornography all these things but we think in terms of of of that type of corruption but see this is this is a bit different is that Satan would in his subtility corrupt our minds from the Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ so how many know that God is not the author of confusion so who's the author of confusion Satan's the author of it and so he says there he says I I fear lest your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if we receive another Spirit which ye have not received or another gospel so these are things that come after the message has been preached these are the come things that come after the true message has gone forth now we see other another Jesus preached we see another Spirit brought we see another gospel presented and that's the thing that's can corrupt the people's mind and he says you might well bear with him and then I'll just repeat in verse three that your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ we want to teach and to preach on the Holy Ghost a little bit of both that's called preaching I want to go into it and speak on it just a little bit and and uh uh a few weeks ago we had read uh Matthew 25 which is the parable or prophecy for our times it speaks about five wise virgins and five foolish virgins and we realized that they were called virgin virgins and they were uh Christians they were all Christians they weren't the uh people of the world but in this parable of the end time at the Midnight Hour at the very last hours we find a parable that we have many Christians and the only difference at the last moment is that five of them had oil and the other five didn't have oil that was the only distinction is that five had the Holy Spirit five didn't have the Holy Spirit and that's one of the last Parables before the coming of the Lord is that we have the only distinction between Christians and one who have the oil and ones who don't have the oil so that's a very significant thing and I trust it was a challenge to all of us not to preach condemnation to us but to preach conviction because I think in order to live in this hour and in order to be a Christian and in order to fight against the devil who belittles us and puts us down and fights against us I think we ought to everyone know that we have this oil amen so I think it's essential can you say Amen it's essential for Christians to know that they have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and and so uh that is the only difference in the closing seconds of time and so but I'm always amazed sometimes when I preach a little bit on the Holy Ghost I'm Amazed at the response sometimes and sometimes it's good response it's all good response but I'm amazed when I preach a little bit about the Holy Ghost I'm amazed sometimes the response that the enemy jumps into the situation and begins to jump in and mess with minds and begins to speak to people and begins to raise other questions you know you preach these things to settle questions but the devil doesn't want questions settled he wants to raise more questions and he wants to raise them in your mind that you begin to fear you begin to doubt you begin to doubt your experience with the Lord and I want to say this morning listen if the Lord has dealt with you in any way it doesn't matter what level if it is the Lord then we should rejoice and praise God for how he's dealt with you in your life and I got to say to you that I've Got Confidence that whatever God has done and you can say I know God did this in my life if you know he's in your life if you'll stay in that channel God will give you everything that you need to finish this journey I say that because the devil is present and he listens too and I'm tired of him messing with people's minds we may struggle we may try to get our handle on things we might have different things but we should stop it at the door stop it at the door when the devil tries to mess and corrupt our minds that's one place he should not be allowed to be in but I find that I find that when that subject is presented it's it's it's such a thing that the devil begins to wrestle with people's minds and raise questions and and so I I just want to as a pastor break it down just a little bit if that's all right with you so now as a foundation there are some things that we know about our enemy we have learned through the years serving the lord we there's things that we know about our enemy and we know that Satan puts in extra hours extra time when something good is getting ready to happen to a Believer something good is coming to them if he picks up on it or senses that you're a lot of times he says you're beginning to yield more you're beginning to come to the altar you're getting broken uh you're beginning to respond and Satan is watching you do that and that means he's learned that if there's Brokenness and there's yielding and there's obedience and there's this Rush towards God he gets nervous because he knows something good is coming from God to you and I find the devil's nature is that when he knows something good is coming he tries to jump out ahead of it God wants to connect with you but know your enemy he's stepping out in front of it and he wants to distract you can you say amen and then in the Bible just before the promise came the devil has learned when people really supernaturally connect he jumps out in front of the promise he he gets people nervous before the true promise comes the real the real thing and he jumps out ahead and he tries to tries to get a counterfeit to the real thing coming so that's the way the devil works too we know in the promise of Abraham okay Sarah saying nothing's happening nothing's happening get Hager my servant have maybe God meant it and they try to mechanically or they try to work something up and the devil works in those things keeping a person from the true promise coming to them how many knows the Holy Ghost is a promise it's your promise but the devil through history in the Bible has jumped out in front of the promise to try to confuse and to try to turn it into something else and just before the promise he has learned when people and I'm just exposing him because we know him now after all these years just before Satan has learned when people really truly connect supernaturally connect with God's promise for that hour when they connect with it those people become powerful they become invincible they become stronger than ever before and Satan knows knows that and so he's going to keep them from the true promise of the hour he would love to stop it before it happens he would love to stop the promise before it happens but he's never been able to do it no that's the track record now of God you see the thing is is that once God speaks the promise through a prophet once it's spoken that's it it's as good as done and there isn't a demon there isn't a devil with all there is the devil and his minions the devil there isn't any devil or any spirit that once is spoken by the mouth of a prophet you can never stop that promise coming to pass Hallelujah even if it hasn't even come in the people yet or manifested yet you can't stop it see that's before it even gets to you that's just when it's released because God says when I speak a word it will not return void unto me it will accomplish what I set it out to do and the way that he accomplishes it the way he spreads it out there the the way God puts out his word is through the mouth of a prophet once the promise is spoken and once it lodges in the hearts of the people and starts to manifest there isn't a thing that he can do to stop it and the if the wheels are set in motion that's why I say about your own experience with the Lord because in this series I'm going to separate between what God does as a group and and a and a generation to the individual because it's the same Holy Spirit but he works with you individually and whenever we compare our experience with someone else's we get in trouble but as an individual God works with you and he has your experience and you have to realize when he begins to deal with you Satan becomes angry and no wonder he wants to mess with your mind and make you doubt everything that God has given you because he's got to stop this process but to me when the we are set in Motion in my life when I was 16 years old when I was 8 years old and got baptized I did it because the Lord led me to do that the Lord was in my life then a few experiences later and then at 16 he filled me with his holy spirit I look at this as a journey and I see God dealing with me and once the process has been set in motion if God started it God will finish [Applause] it and you start resting in that that's what the Holy Ghost is is rest he rested the seventh day because the works were finished before the foundation of the world catch that Revelation catch that Revelation I'm resting in the Holy Ghost because the works were finished at Calvary everything that was done was done there the victory was won there for my life the victory has already been won all I need to do is yield myself and once things are set in Motion in your life then you say God has Set Me In Motion I'm G to stay right here I'm going to keep following and everything that I need he's going to give me that is the basic purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost it's when he the person of Truth the person of the word comes in you to make the promise and word for this hour live for this hour that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost can I say it again the basic purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost is when he the person of Truth the person of the word comes into you to make his word for this hour live through you and to lead you and to guide you into all truth let's look at this after it filled those in the upper room because that's the example we go to right away that's the best example a after the Holy Ghost filled those in the upper room the question was raised for those who were looking carnally and looking at here they come out of the upper room something happen happened up there they weren't up there so but they see the effects of the Holy Ghost they see the effects and the effects was my they were baptized in something that made them just begin to glorify God and lose all their pride and lose all the and come down there staggering drunk drunk like drunk men coming out of the upper room and but what they were doing is not speaking unknown tongues they were glorifying God and they weren't ashamed to do it praise be to God God has done something God has done something but I want to say to you they weren't just saying oh and because the question was what is this Peter what is going on here what is this they were asked and that's the question what is this going on what is taking place and I want to say that Peter did not point to any emotion he said they are not drunk as you suppose people are drunk he didn't say well we were just up there and we were all together and man we we started to sing and all of a sudden just we just got built up in EM motion he didn't say that Peter said what is this Peter pointed to the the word he said this this is that which is spoken by the prophet Joel everything that you're seeing here and especially as far as the person of Christ coming by the Holy Ghost in their souls first time ever in history it came on David's spirit and by the way the Holy Ghost came so much in David spir it couldn't come on his soul yet because there was no Calvary his soul would have the serpent nature you can't put the Holy Spirit on a serpent nature so but David with the holy ghost on his Spirit worshiped and danced and and glorified God and it was only on a spirit glory be to God with just the Holy Spirit on his Spirit he says I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord if you're hungry for the Holy Ghost and it's doing something to you you might be saying the same thing I was glad when it was Church time I wasn't looking for a reason to miss it my schedule's too tight the Holy Spirit leads a person to say I'm glad it's church now I'm ready to go to church oh somebody ought to give me an amen somewhere without the B because so now I've got to get on this is that now it can come in the soul and but Peter did not say we're having a big Revival here and there's there's something strange going on I don't understand what's going on but it just feels good P Peter never said that Peter could take the word that came from the prophet Joel and say What's Happening Here In The Souls of men is right here in the scripture it's a promise in Joel and that promise now after hundreds of years is happening and has happened in this upper room it's to the word this is that it wasn't it just I don't know we're just all drunk and we don't know what's going on but I'm enjoying it what you it's like people come to say what did he say today I don't know what he said but it sure felt good come on people and you know I'm correcting things because we can't live on the surface we can't live on Bubble dances we can't just live on a Feeling can you say Amen Monday morning the feeling may be gone but the word in our life is not gone the promise is not gone what God has done in your life is not gone so that's why we can shout and rejoice on Monday morning the same as we do on Sunday at church that's why our Revival is not to the next camp meeting our Revival is every day in the Holy Ghost and we don't need any music we don't need anybody around we don't even need the preacher the revival can stir up within us on Monday morning and say devil I'm ready to meet you there was a reason Peter said what is this this is the word being fulfilled in us there's this is the promise happening in me there was a reason for the outward motion there was a reason that they were drunk in the spirit and glorifying God the word the promise was Happ happening something on the inside was happening and it was showing up on the outside he the person came in them to fulfill the promise of that hour it's from the inside out not the outside in what is the Holy Ghost when it really TRS really comes to you it's working it's the inside out not the outside in you don't get caught up in something on the outside and don't get nothing real on the inside it's in the inside out not the outside in so the devil tries to stop the promise but if he can't stop it which he can't he looks to mess with it afterwards he tries to get it before he can't do it and then he tries to do other things maybe while it's going on but he really observes and watch watches what it is that's happening outwardly and tries to copy itah but he can't copy the real life of the Holy Ghost Inside a Believer he can't get it himself because if he if he if he got it himself he'd have to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then he wouldn't be the devil he'd be your brother and you'd have to shake his head but when you go down that path of justification and baptize with the true Holy Ghost he's he's he's your enemy can you say amen and so now Satan watches I've said it this way it's is he he's watching everybody in in Jud Jud everybody in Jerusalem is watching these come out of the out of the upper room but Satan is watching too and he can't duplicate or copy what's happening to them on the inside but he has through countless years tried to copy the acts and the manifestations of the Holy Ghost now why why would he do that why would he try to copy that because he can't have the life he can't do that he can't find find the source of what's really happening in the soul level he can't get there he has no hands to touch that he can't do it but he can copy he's a copycat he's a copycat he's a duplicator he's he's trying to recreate situation recreate atmospheres do that and but why why does he do it he does it because he wants to misdirect people from the power of the Holy Ghost now Satan is able to in that atmosphere every gift of the nine spiritual gifts can be imitated now I don't understand all that I just know that it's true he can't touch the life of it he can't change a life but he can make a life copy what's going on and he can allow people to get under because the rain falls on the just and the unjust now why would he do that why wouldn't he go just say let's go to the bar man forget all this rejoicing in this holy ghost stuff let's just go serve the world uh he's smarter than that so if he can through 2,000 years of church history if he can get people to come back into works doing Works doing things then he can Sidetrack a real genuine New Birth and a change in the soul and if they do the works if they imitate the emotion or if they can do all the stuff that's around it then he deceives that person because they didn't really get the real thing and that's all he needs because when they get the real thing they become an invincible Army he don't know how to deal with them and I've said before if he was really smart which he's not he's dumb if he's really smart he would have never planted Jesus in the ground what a dummy because Jesus already says you plant this in the ground it's going to bring forth so he for three three and a half years he had one to deal with with the power of the Holy Ghost all over him he plants it in the ground it resurrects and a few days later he's got 120 talk about Harvest and then thousands of souls came to the kingdom got filled with the Holy Ghost and Satan's going what did they do I was better just to deal with one now he got 120 now he got a thousand with the same Spirit on them because he's dumb he didn't realize that if you allow that to be planted that that's what grows and it grows and it grows this Holy Ghost grows and grows and grows it is the power to grow it is the power to bring the full promise it's the power to take you to a rapture it has power that Satan can't stop this is what we know of Satan as well he likes to complicate and confuse what God has done or is doing what God sends is always simple it just needs simple Faith now I'm quoting the message now how many know that the message comes God sends it in Simplicity that it confounds the wise don't you ever make this message complicated that's the the devil when God sends something it's simple and matter of fact it's so dirt simple that most of the world miss it and say that can't be God but we know that the message is simple and we know that it takes just simple Faith as a mustard seed to believe it that's what he needs that simp simplifies it God s what he sends is simple can everybody just get that point this morning to say what God sends is simple and the way to receive it is through simple Faith simple faith not complicated Faith simple Faith the devil Works overtime and puts in extra hours to take what comes from God and to complicate it where our text says in the minds the corruption in our thinking to take something simple that's come from God and to confuse it questions can confuse people instead of help people so you always say who's asking the question what's the source of the question there's nothing wrong with the question but what's the spirit behind the question I think the Pharisees motive for asking questions was different than a sincere believer Satan likes to confuse the minds of the people from what God has sent so now in relation to my subject on the Holy Ghost in relation to the Holy Ghost I don't know of a subject Satan has tried to mess with so much as the subject of the Holy Ghost since this filling and this baptism and this change and this Born Again experience happened Satan has tried to confuse people's minds as to the interpretation of it what it is he wants to confuse people isn't it amazing that the most important thing that God can ever do to an individual is one of the most confused things by Satan in the church it's your experience with Christ that he will discredit the most and try to discredit the most and try to play with your mind the most to try to figure it all out and the more we try to figure it out the more confusing it becomes we live in a complicated world we live in pressure we live in financial pressure how we going to make ends meet all these other things but if it's a complicated world it's hard to make a living it's hard to put things together and you're you're sometimes you're worried about it what's the next step what am I going to do you need to leave those cares to the Lord but listen one thing don't let the devil complicate your walk with the Lord thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting
