[0:00] few moments
[0:04] greet you all in the name of the
[0:06] lord our visitors as well good to good
[0:08] to see you in many years some of us
[0:11] um before we i won't be singing any
[0:13] songs i
[0:14] i've been told before that uh my brother
[0:16] has a singing gift in the family so we
[0:18] just try to keep
[0:19] keep where we're called and gifted as
[0:21] much as possible
[0:22] now yeah i stand next to gideon choir
[0:25] sometimes he notices i give him our time
[0:27] he holds the ear next to me and i try
[0:30] not to take that personally
[0:34] but um yeah we do our best
[0:36] before we get started i just want to
[0:37] give a give a short testimony
[0:41] on monday
[0:42] this week my my wife and son were
[0:45] heading to a doctor's appointment and
[0:46] i'm in the middle of my uh middle of my
[0:49] english class
[0:50] and i and i get this phone call and i
[0:53] almost didn't hear the phone because i
[0:54] have it on on silent but i heard
[0:56] something vibrating
[0:58] back behind me so i picked it up and it
[1:00] was my wife it's always good to pick up
[1:02] your wife's phone calls no matter if
[1:03] you're in the middle of something else
[1:05] and this time it certainly was because
[1:07] she and joba just got in an accident
[1:09] maybe you could show the first light
[1:11] here
[1:12] um
[1:13] there's the uh there's her car
[1:16] she'd gone through a uh red light and
[1:18] gotten hit by a uh
[1:20] gotten hit by another vehicle and i was
[1:22] uh
[1:23] we were just glad that uh it was just a
[1:26] car that was damaged uh a wife didn't
[1:28] have any uh she was a little bit sore
[1:30] for a day but
[1:31] nothing bad she often has headaches and
[1:33] things like that but the lord just
[1:35] really really touched her
[1:40] so we're just very thankful you know we
[1:43] uh we pray watch over our families uh
[1:46] when we go to work and things and uh
[1:48] it's good to see how god does uh it does
[1:51] protect us
[1:52] and uh you know i think her your
[1:54] guardian angel just might have gotten a
[1:55] promotion this week
[1:57] we're very thankful for that but now the
[1:59] other part of the testimony was uh
[2:02] last week brother brand i were talking
[2:03] about the uh about the used car market
[2:05] we both drive old cars and things i said
[2:07] lord i told i really pray our cars just
[2:10] keep on doing it for a really long time
[2:12] because
[2:13] i hear it's really hard to find a car
[2:15] right now when you do find a car
[2:17] people pay above the sticker price
[2:19] everything i don't like paying above
[2:21] sticker prices things like that and it's
[2:24] the very next morning
[2:25] i get the phone call your car's in
[2:27] trouble uh so we went and got ahead
[2:29] checked out it was uh totaled pretty
[2:31] quickly
[2:32] but my dad he said okay i think to help
[2:34] you he walked around he went to a used
[2:36] car used car lot
[2:38] and he walked in the door and right
[2:40] behind him
[2:41] uh walked walked in the owner of the
[2:43] company
[2:44] um tom all
[2:46] this is not an advertisement but he had
[2:48] just been to our school a couple about a
[2:50] month before um giving the kids gideon
[2:53] bibles so he knew he he knew who we were
[2:55] and things
[2:56] and he said yeah just the day before
[2:58] somebody had traded in a dodge caravan
[3:02] low miles great condition uh good price
[3:05] and
[3:06] within that same day i went home eight
[3:08] o'clock that evening with a new van and
[3:09] that's a god provided he protects and
[3:12] provides
[3:14] so we're just very very grateful
[3:19] my wife and i were talking in the
[3:20] evening we just you know when god takes
[3:22] care of you in such a way you just feel
[3:24] so loved
[3:26] he takes care of us
[3:29] well this morning um
[3:33] lord laid on my heart
[3:35] i had to give it a give it a title i'd
[3:36] call it the
[3:38] broken image
[3:39] and we'll start out
[3:41] in genesis 1 27 i have it here on the
[3:43] slide we can stand and we can read it
[3:47] in genesis 1 27 god
[3:49] so god created man in his own image
[3:53] in the image of god created he him
[3:56] male and female created he them so when
[3:59] adam was created
[4:01] we can see he was a mirror image of god
[4:04] and then when when eve was separated out
[4:06] of adam together they formed a mirror
[4:10] image of god and if there had been if
[4:13] the fall hadn't happened and there have
[4:15] been more many more mirror images of god
[4:17] populating eden one way or the other
[4:19] know how that would have happened but
[4:21] there was humans would be able to look
[4:23] at each other and say i can see god in
[4:25] you because we're mere images of god we
[4:27] can see god in one another that
[4:29] was what the intention was
[4:32] were mere image we were created as a
[4:34] mere image of god
[4:36] however with the fall
[4:39] the mirror image of god that was in them
[4:42] was broken it was it it was shattered
[4:46] and
[4:46] that's the broken image you want to talk
[4:48] today about that broken image and how
[4:51] god works to repair it and how satan
[4:53] tries to keep us from getting that image
[4:55] repaired you may be seated
[4:59] go back to the powerpoint presentation
[5:04] thinking about a a broken image and now
[5:06] we use uh i might use a mirror in them i
[5:09] was driving up and asked my wife in the
[5:11] car to know what what day is it today
[5:13] and i was thinking about uh today is
[5:15] halloween but she corrected me she's the
[5:17] more spiritual she said no it's
[5:19] reformation day because this is when
[5:22] martin luther nailed his 95 theses so
[5:24] she put me in my place there but i was
[5:26] just kind of thinking about
[5:28] about halloween and one of the
[5:30] superstitions that we know it's a if you
[5:32] break a mirror it said to bring
[5:34] seven years bad luck i don't uh i don't
[5:36] believe in that but i kind of thought
[5:38] the idea behind it why why do people
[5:41] associate that bad luck with that
[5:43] superstition well because
[5:45] they they look at this as a picture of
[5:47] you
[5:48] and when this image of you is broken
[5:50] that's a bad thing
[5:52] and i think you can take it back
[5:54] uh
[5:55] this this idea of an image being broken
[5:58] it goes back to the fall
[6:00] how god created man in his image and
[6:03] when that and when that image is
[6:05] shattered when that image is broken you
[6:07] can try to look in the mirror again but
[6:09] if there's a shattered mirror you're not
[6:10] going to see a clear picture of who you
[6:12] are
[6:13] and when that image of god
[6:15] within the human being was was broken
[6:18] with the fall there is no clear image of
[6:20] who we are when we look at one another
[6:22] we can see shattered pieces oh yeah
[6:24] there's there's something of there's
[6:26] something good because in in every human
[6:28] being no matter whether they're
[6:30] have if they've been washed in the blood
[6:32] if they're justified sanctified and
[6:34] every human being they're there there is
[6:36] still a broken image of god and they're
[6:38] capable of creating things of great work
[6:40] that's why even in in secular literature
[6:43] and secular music you can see some real
[6:46] kernels of truth out there because each
[6:48] person is made in the image of god
[6:51] but it's a shattered image and that's
[6:53] why we can't just focus upon upon any
[6:56] one individual to be our salvation
[6:57] because it's a shattered image of god
[7:01] so immediately though after after the
[7:03] fellowship with god was broken the image
[7:05] of god was shattered with an adam and
[7:07] eve immediately god comes down to seek
[7:10] his fallen children because they've lost
[7:12] their identity and the only place that
[7:14] they can see their identity clearly
[7:16] again is in god himself so the image of
[7:19] god is shattered they cannot look at
[7:21] each other and see exactly who they are
[7:23] god comes down himself so they can see
[7:25] ah that's papa god that's where i came
[7:28] from that's who i am he had he wanted to
[7:30] come right down to reaffirm who they are
[7:33] that they're his children
[7:35] and we're going to find whenever god
[7:37] comes down to try to reaffirm who his
[7:40] children are the devil's going to come
[7:41] right in very quickly to to to hinder
[7:45] that
[7:46] one of the uh maybe our next slide then
[7:49] our next one
[7:50] one of the very first of the ten
[7:51] commandments
[7:53] is thou shalt not make into the any
[7:56] graven image and i think this is
[7:59] significant not just because it's the
[8:01] second of the commandments but i think
[8:02] it's because we're made in god's image
[8:05] the image is broken and whenever we go
[8:08] to try to find out who we are from
[8:09] another source
[8:12] that's going to be an image instead of
[8:13] god
[8:14] only god only by looking at god can we
[8:17] see a clear image of who we really are
[8:20] and we can see right as god gathers the
[8:22] children of israel there at mount sinai
[8:24] with the purpose
[8:26] of establishing a covenant with them
[8:28] making clear their identity with him
[8:31] making clear their relationship with
[8:33] them they are his covenant his chosen
[8:35] people
[8:36] in this first one of his first grant is
[8:38] thou shalt not make any graven image and
[8:41] as he's up there on the mount one of the
[8:43] very first things they do
[8:45] is they make the grave an image
[8:48] and we see clearly in this situation
[8:51] why this is so bad
[8:53] maybe our next slide
[8:56] psalm 135 gives gives i think a good
[8:58] reason for
[9:00] why these images are bad the idols of
[9:02] the heathen are silver and gold the work
[9:04] of men's hands
[9:06] they have mouths but they speak not eyes
[9:08] have they but they see not they have
[9:10] ears but they hear not neither is there
[9:12] any breath in their mouths so it's
[9:14] completely illogical to worship a god
[9:16] that you make yourself but the next part
[9:19] is is the key they that make them are
[9:22] like unto them
[9:24] and whenever you set up an image instead
[9:26] of god
[9:28] in our life we're not going to become
[9:30] more like god we're going to start
[9:31] becoming like the image that we set up
[9:34] and then the book of exodus as soon as
[9:36] they uh they have set up this uh this
[9:38] molten calf they get up early the next
[9:41] morning they offer burnt offerings and
[9:42] peace offerings they get up to eat and
[9:44] drink and then they rose up to play
[9:47] they stopped acting like the chosen
[9:49] people of god and they started acting
[9:51] like animals
[9:53] because they who make the image become
[9:56] like undo it
[9:58] so when god wants us to be our attention
[10:00] completely focused on him because that's
[10:03] that's the only way that we can see who
[10:05] we're supposed to look like
[10:07] because the image is broken god wants
[10:09] our attention to be fully on him because
[10:11] as we focus upon him as we gaze upon him
[10:14] and open our hearts to his word we
[10:16] become changed more and more into his
[10:19] image because that's where we come from
[10:21] that's what he wants to restore us to he
[10:23] wants to repair the broken image and we
[10:26] didn't that image is repaired by
[10:28] focusing upon god and drawing closer to
[10:31] him the devil wants to get in there get
[10:34] some image in between
[10:36] whether it's a graven image whether it's
[10:37] a mental concept doesn't matter get
[10:40] something in between so that we'll be
[10:42] looking at something else besides god
[10:45] because only by looking at pen upon god
[10:48] gazing upon him accepting him that's the
[10:50] only way that the broken image within us
[10:53] can be restored
[10:58] idolatry carried a stiff penalty in the
[11:00] old testament
[11:02] because if you're not drawing your
[11:03] identity from god
[11:05] you will fall for anything and you will
[11:07] start acting like anything so there was
[11:09] a
[11:10] there was a clear
[11:11] penalty in deuteronomy 29 talks about
[11:14] if anybody starts setting up idols
[11:15] turning your hearts away from the lord
[11:17] your god to serve other nations etc
[11:20] and they'll say when this happens um
[11:22] they might bless themselves in their
[11:24] hearts from deuteronomy 29 and say i'll
[11:26] have peace i'll walk in the imagination
[11:28] of my heart i'll add drunkenness to
[11:30] thirst
[11:31] the lord won't spare him
[11:33] and his name would blotted out from
[11:35] under heaven it's a it's a serious thing
[11:38] to reject the image of god to reject the
[11:40] identity of god and then lead other
[11:42] people
[11:43] astray in that
[11:46] and then brother branham says um
[11:48] when israel this is in the sardisian
[11:50] church age when israel rejected the
[11:51] leadership of god in the pillar of fire
[11:53] and turned to worship the golden calves
[11:56] their names were removed from the book
[11:57] of life
[11:58] and then he says
[12:00] if it happened then
[12:02] most assuredly israel's rejection of
[12:03] jesus christ is the messiah would demand
[12:06] as severe a penalty
[12:08] so i want to take a look at another time
[12:10] take a look over in the book of um
[12:12] well
[12:13] we'll
[12:14] we'll be thinking more about matthew now
[12:16] when when jesus christ comes as the
[12:18] messiah
[12:20] here he's coming god and flesh
[12:22] if there's any way that we can see who
[12:24] we are who we're supposed to be who
[12:26] we're made to be it is in the ministry
[12:28] of jesus christ
[12:30] god and flesh this is what this is what
[12:32] god's will was at the beginning
[12:35] but very quickly whenever god is
[12:38] bringing forth a clear image of himself
[12:40] for us to focus on become connected with
[12:42] so we can be restored our broken image
[12:45] can be repaired whenever that happens
[12:48] the devil is going to come in
[12:49] with another image for us to look at now
[12:53] in the book of exodus we see this was a
[12:55] physical graven image
[12:57] in the um in in the gospels we see we
[13:00] don't see the scribes and pharisees
[13:02] erecting statues that we should be
[13:05] of jehovah we don't see a graven image
[13:08] but we do see images
[13:10] that they have in their own conceptions
[13:13] of how god would work and their own
[13:15] doctrine and those become the image that
[13:18] they seek after it's so important not to
[13:21] take anything else but just what god is
[13:23] because when you make an image whether
[13:25] it be a grave whether it be a graven
[13:27] image in the old testament you look in
[13:29] the all the old pagan literature they
[13:31] have all these gods and godlesses the
[13:34] gods and gods they create they're more
[13:35] like humans they're nothing more you
[13:37] can't you can't go beyond them and
[13:38] become more godlike they you become more
[13:41] depraved
[13:42] when you take a look though in the all
[13:45] in the um
[13:46] in the new testament as jesus comes the
[13:49] messiah comes fulfilling all the old
[13:51] testament scriptures the scribes and
[13:52] pharisees
[13:54] refuse
[13:55] to accept it
[13:57] and it's interesting the things maybe we
[13:58] could look over
[14:00] in psalm 69.
[14:02] i mentioned i said matthew we're going
[14:04] to look at psalm 69 this is a messianic
[14:06] psalm
[14:07] and
[14:09] david
[14:10] makes many statements about the messiah
[14:12] here
[14:13] that
[14:14] jesus ends up accepting
[14:16] or quoting about speaking about himself
[14:20] as you're turning i think it's
[14:22] interesting when we look
[14:23] when jesus comes as the messiah
[14:25] some of the things that happened around
[14:27] israel at that time i didn't realize but
[14:29] the description the sadducees in the
[14:31] pharisees
[14:32] they were two very very different groups
[14:35] within judaism actually about the
[14:37] hundred years before before jesus was
[14:39] born there was a there was a jewish
[14:41] civil war
[14:42] and the sadducees and the pharisees were
[14:43] on opposite sides they were fighting a
[14:45] civil war the sadducees were more
[14:47] associated with the greeks and they
[14:49] wanted to hellenize make it more make
[14:51] jewish more like the greek religion and
[14:53] the pharisees wanted to know keep it
[14:55] simple keep it back the traditions of
[14:57] moses
[14:58] and they fought a war about this thing
[15:00] but when they
[15:01] what's the one thing that could could
[15:03] unite these two groups in the spirit of
[15:05] bipartisanship
[15:07] it was the rejection of jesus
[15:09] people who had great enmity would never
[15:11] work together but when jesus comes and
[15:13] the messiah comes it brings these two
[15:15] groups together
[15:18] so when when the messiah comes here
[15:20] let's just take a look at psalm 69 and
[15:24] we'll just pick out a couple of
[15:25] scriptures here
[15:27] um verse eight a couple of couple of
[15:29] scriptures that we can easily identify
[15:31] with jesus i am become estranged to my
[15:33] brethren an alien to my mother's
[15:35] children
[15:36] here this is a case where this is one
[15:38] that clearly can be identified with
[15:40] jesus
[15:42] he says verse nine the zeal of your
[15:43] house has eaten me up and there are
[15:45] approaches of them that reproach thee or
[15:47] fall upon me jesus quotes the scripture
[15:49] as he's going through the temple and
[15:51] cleaning it
[15:53] of the money changers
[15:56] let's see here
[16:03] let's take a look down at verse 20.
[16:05] reproach has broken my heart i'm full of
[16:07] heaviness and i looked for some to take
[16:09] pity but there was none and for
[16:11] comforters but i found none
[16:14] and they gave me also a gall for my meat
[16:16] and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[16:19] drink this is this is fulfilled they're
[16:21] on the cross
[16:23] verse 22 let their table become a snare
[16:25] before them and that which should have
[16:27] been for their welfare let it become
[16:30] a trap
[16:32] and this is a scripture that that really
[16:34] um
[16:35] i'd never seen that before in this slide
[16:37] until we were teaching our sunday school
[16:38] class a couple weeks ago and we were as
[16:39] we were reading this in the sunday
[16:40] school class it opened up to me like it
[16:43] hadn't before
[16:44] let their table become a snare before
[16:46] them
[16:47] their table this is where the torah
[16:49] would have been this is their their
[16:50] conception of how god should be coming
[16:53] we want god to come and throw off this
[16:54] roman yoke god has to come our
[16:56] particular way
[16:58] this is what what we this is this is the
[17:01] this is this is our grave our our graven
[17:04] image as it were how god has to work
[17:07] but when they reject
[17:09] truth
[17:10] when jesus comes and he fulfills all
[17:12] those scriptures
[17:14] the thing that had been a help to them
[17:16] this table of the torah the scrolls they
[17:19] had their table had been a help had been
[17:22] a guide for showing what god's will was
[17:24] but when you reject truth the same thing
[17:27] that had been for your good for so many
[17:29] years for centuries had been for their
[17:31] good it now became a snare a trap for
[17:35] them
[17:36] this word of god the law of the torah
[17:38] had been for their welfare
[17:40] but when they refused the fulfillment of
[17:43] it
[17:43] it becomes a trap because they think
[17:47] we've got it
[17:48] this jesus he's not in it at all and
[17:50] they're going to they're going to just
[17:52] they're going to the dutch have an
[17:54] expression when you're having an
[17:55] argument you're going to keep your legs
[17:57] stiff i'm not going to bend at all
[17:59] and this is why what happened here the
[18:00] things that they had held near for so
[18:03] long had fought wars over they'd
[18:05] confessed
[18:07] jehovah's name for so long yet now when
[18:09] they refuse truth when it's open before
[18:11] them the very things that they'd held
[18:13] there that were god's word becomes a
[18:15] trap and a snare to them because they
[18:18] are now drawing their identity from
[18:20] something besides
[18:22] god's revealed word
[18:24] god comes down in flesh this is who
[18:27] you're supposed to be
[18:29] here i am jesus says i am he
[18:34] he comes down in this way and the devil
[18:36] comes right with him
[18:39] at the same time to give them something
[18:41] else no you don't want this hold on to
[18:44] this interpretation of the truth and
[18:46] they they turn away from that from the
[18:48] god's revealed word to what they thought
[18:50] was true
[18:52] and what they had had becomes
[18:55] a trap and a snare for them
[18:59] when you look at
[19:00] if you follow paul and barnabas
[19:02] through the
[19:03] through the book of acts on their
[19:05] missionary journeys now we remember when
[19:07] we take
[19:08] whenever we take a whenever we erect a
[19:10] graven image
[19:12] we become like unto it
[19:15] and when um
[19:17] one of the amazing things that happens
[19:20] as
[19:21] as
[19:21] jesus is going to be crucified
[19:25] god has provided them with a king
[19:28] a king very different to what they had
[19:30] wanted or expected but god provided a
[19:33] king
[19:34] well in john 19 15 as the jews are
[19:38] betraying jesus now the pilate they
[19:41] shout with all their hearts we have no
[19:43] king but
[19:45] caesar
[19:47] as they reject what god has provided for
[19:50] them as they reject that they're making
[19:53] a full-hearted acceptance
[19:55] of the bondage that they had actually
[19:57] wanted to be freed from
[20:01] they'd wanted to deliver from that
[20:02] bondage when you resect when you reject
[20:06] god's revealed truth
[20:08] everything that you had had becomes a
[20:10] snare to you and you're making it
[20:13] open-hearted acceptance of bondage
[20:16] and they think they're doing
[20:18] right the whole time
[20:21] now paul on barnabas we can look at um
[20:24] acts 13.
[20:26] whenever paul and barnabas are traveling
[20:28] through asia minor they
[20:30] for a while they have a
[20:31] up to this point i believe there's
[20:33] there's a pattern they follow whether
[20:35] they go there in cyprus or in asia minor
[20:38] they first go to the synagogues
[20:40] because god god worked with the jews
[20:43] first before we start working with the
[20:44] gentiles we'll go to the jews first
[20:46] and every time they got they started
[20:48] getting put out of the synagogues after
[20:50] a while
[20:51] in acts 13
[20:53] we see the jews now they have a likeness
[20:55] that they have erected of how god should
[20:57] work
[20:58] it is different from god's
[21:00] fulfillment in in in in jesus we're
[21:03] going to see them becoming like unto the
[21:06] image that they've erected
[21:08] acts 13 45
[21:11] when the jews saw the multitudes of
[21:12] gentiles who were following paul and
[21:14] barnabas they were filled with envy and
[21:17] spake against those things which were
[21:18] spoken by paul contradicting and
[21:21] blaspheming
[21:23] now now the jews are acting like the
[21:25] very image that they directed
[21:28] they reject the image of god they take
[21:30] on the image of caesar caesar's our king
[21:33] and that starts affecting how they live
[21:35] they don't want anything to do with
[21:37] these people who are actually teaching
[21:39] from the law the truth from the torah
[21:41] taking them beyond that they don't want
[21:42] anything to do with that and they're
[21:44] crying out as hard against their they
[21:47] persecute paul and barnabas just like
[21:49] they had been persecuted by greeks and
[21:51] romans earlier but when you reject god's
[21:55] revealed truth take on another image
[21:57] you're going to become like that image
[22:00] paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it
[22:02] was necessary that the word of god
[22:03] should first have been spoken to you
[22:06] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[22:07] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[22:09] though
[22:10] we turn to the gentiles
[22:12] and from that point on
[22:14] the the the pattern changes when they go
[22:17] to cities they don't always go to the
[22:18] synagogues first they start going to the
[22:21] gentiles
[22:22] they had
[22:24] taken something else the jews had taken
[22:26] something else as their image and they
[22:29] became like it brother branham says you
[22:31] know god doesn't send anybody to hell
[22:35] you send yourself to hell
[22:37] god god directs barrier after barrier he
[22:39] sends the truth to you and every time
[22:42] that we step over that
[22:44] god's not sending us to hell god's not
[22:46] sitting in judgment in our lives it is
[22:47] we who are taking that choice
[22:50] whenever we take a
[22:52] that whenever the devil gives us a
[22:54] temptation he's giving us one end of the
[22:56] stick it looks very attractive very
[22:58] beautiful but we can't separate the end
[23:01] that the devil shows us from the end
[23:02] that's in his hand
[23:04] because it's very tempting is out there
[23:06] we want to grab that but the judgments
[23:08] the the difficulties that come with it
[23:10] are connected there at the other end of
[23:11] the stick and that can't be separated
[23:15] now as uh as paul continues his
[23:18] journeyings many different people start
[23:20] working with him but
[23:23] maybe we can turn over to second timothy
[23:24] one of these men was
[23:27] demas
[23:29] second timothy chapter four
[23:31] and we don't know a whole lot about
[23:33] demise's
[23:35] testimony
[23:36] what we do know though is he worked
[23:39] well with paul
[23:40] for a time
[23:42] but at some point
[23:45] demas
[23:46] started getting his eyes off
[23:48] of what god was doing
[23:51] and the world to come and the gospel
[23:53] that was being preached and he got his
[23:54] eyes on this present world
[23:57] and ii timothy 4 10 says demas hath
[24:00] forsaken me
[24:01] having loved this present world that's
[24:04] such a sad thing because demas was
[24:06] working with
[24:08] the apostle paul god was clearly working
[24:10] through the apostle paul's ministry
[24:12] doing a great and mighty work but how
[24:14] easy it is even then we're so close to
[24:17] truth it's being
[24:18] revealed how the one that god's working
[24:20] with we can still have our vision
[24:22] clouded we don't know whether there was
[24:24] a disagreement with paul i think he got
[24:26] his toes stepped on at some point or
[24:27] maybe he got flagged or thinking i
[24:29] should be getting some more attention
[24:30] maybe he just
[24:32] maybe he just wanted to wanted more
[24:34] money we don't know what it was but one
[24:37] way or the other got his eyes off what
[24:38] god was doing
[24:40] got his eyes on the present world and
[24:42] there was a desire out for that
[24:45] that's a sad thing
[24:48] now i spend a little bit more time
[24:50] looking more what
[24:52] what the antichrist what the devil tries
[24:54] to do
[24:55] even in this end time
[24:59] as god
[25:01] we can take a look in the book of acts
[25:03] in acts chapter 2 see how the how the
[25:05] church started out and it's very clear
[25:07] god's working in a in a supernatural
[25:10] marvelous way uh the holy spirit's being
[25:12] poured out it's just amazing
[25:15] but if you compare the book of acts with
[25:18] the description of the church that's
[25:21] given in the book of revelation chapter
[25:23] 2 and 3 and the church ages
[25:26] there's a very big difference
[25:28] between the book of acts and how the
[25:30] church became over the succeeding
[25:33] centuries very big difference
[25:36] and we see it some somehow
[25:38] somewhere
[25:39] the church started perhaps getting their
[25:41] eyes off of
[25:42] god started looking around and becoming
[25:45] more and more like the world brother
[25:47] braham talks about how the church was
[25:49] very similar to what how israel was back
[25:51] in the days of samuel how they wanted
[25:54] the king they wanted to be like the
[25:55] nations round about them when they do
[25:57] that they're getting their eyes off of
[25:59] what god is god is their king they start
[26:01] getting their eyes off of him looking at
[26:03] the other nations around them and they
[26:05] want something more like that
[26:08] so in the in in the day that we live in
[26:11] now
[26:13] god has shown what the son of god
[26:15] looks like
[26:16] he worked mightily in brother branham's
[26:19] ministry in the ministry of many others
[26:21] but he worked mightily in this way to do
[26:23] a restoration
[26:25] and i just want to i want to assert you
[26:28] that the antichrist is offering today if
[26:31] you look at pop culture and popular
[26:32] religion the antichrist is offering a
[26:35] substitute image for the church to
[26:38] identify with
[26:40] the bible give us a clear image of
[26:42] christ the the gospel that paul preached
[26:45] we want to be looking at that as we look
[26:46] at that we'll become more and more like
[26:48] that and the broken the shadow image
[26:50] within us will be repaired
[26:52] the devil wants to do anything and
[26:54] everything he can to get our eyes off of
[26:56] this truth is look at anything else
[26:59] so that that broke image within us can't
[27:02] be repaired
[27:03] his goal though he knows how we're made
[27:06] he knows that we need there there's a
[27:08] need for something bigger than ourselves
[27:10] there's a need for this sense of the
[27:12] religious for the sense of the spiritual
[27:14] so he does offer religion today he helps
[27:18] men scratch their spiritual itch he
[27:20] wants to do anything to keep that quiet
[27:22] enough so that they don't reach out to
[27:25] christ he's doing everything that he can
[27:28] to keep us from spying our true identity
[27:30] which can only be found
[27:32] in the word of god
[27:35] now in um
[27:36] kind of looking at how how the devil
[27:38] would be working in our day in the 20th
[27:41] century 21st century now
[27:43] i read a quote a few years ago by a man
[27:46] named william booth and he was the
[27:48] founder of the salvation army he was uh
[27:51] you could have on the slide here there
[27:53] he is he almost looks uh like this
[27:55] picture he looked like an old prophet
[27:56] almost but he as he's at the beginning
[27:58] of the 20th century he's writing he says
[28:00] the chief danger
[28:02] that confronts the coming century will
[28:04] be religion without the holy ghost
[28:08] christianity without christ
[28:12] forgiveness without repentance
[28:15] salvation without regeneration
[28:18] politics without god
[28:20] in heaven without hell
[28:24] i read this the my he describes our
[28:27] world today to a t the devil has done
[28:31] everything he can
[28:33] to give you religion without god
[28:35] religion without the holy ghost give you
[28:37] christianity without christ because if
[28:39] you have christ in the picture and
[28:40] you're looking at christ you're going to
[28:41] become more like him but he want to give
[28:43] us a sense that we're worshiping christ
[28:45] without ever knowing the real one
[28:48] want to give us a sense of spirituality
[28:50] the devil's not against spirituality
[28:52] he's for spirituality he's not against
[28:54] that he wants to encourage spirituality
[28:57] to turn you aside from truth from the
[29:00] bible that when god came down set as two
[29:03] feet on earth in the body of jesus
[29:05] christ that's who we should be
[29:06] identifying with the devil wants to take
[29:08] that completely out let you feel
[29:10] spiritual but not have this
[29:13] and what we have described if you look
[29:16] at the uh
[29:17] the next slide
[29:19] this is a picture from uh from pilgrim's
[29:21] progress this is when
[29:24] when pilgrim is carrying his his burden
[29:26] there on his back foreign pilgrim's
[29:28] progress is a really good thing you
[29:30] should have your your kids read at some
[29:31] point there's great uh can children's
[29:33] versions you can get for upper
[29:35] elementary junior high versions high
[29:36] school you can read the full thing it's
[29:38] a great book highly recommended
[29:41] but here you got pilgrim with his with
[29:42] this burden of sitting on his back and
[29:44] the evangelist just told him you've got
[29:46] to go go through that wicked yonder
[29:48] wicket gate that there's one way to get
[29:51] that off your path and and the door the
[29:53] gate is jesus christ you have to go
[29:55] through that gate and as he's going he
[29:57] makes at the gate as he's going he's
[29:59] good he's heading to an area that's
[30:00] going to be the cross at some point but
[30:01] he meets this man along the road named
[30:04] worldly wise man
[30:06] a worldly wise who says no you don't
[30:08] have to go that way that's way too hard
[30:11] you need to go over this way i've got a
[30:14] nephew a cousin in this little town
[30:15] called legality
[30:17] his name is mr civility and he can get
[30:20] that burden off your back and no time
[30:22] not so long a journey pain-free and
[30:25] you'll be able to settle nicely here
[30:27] legality and civility and he
[30:30] christian goes along this way it sounds
[30:32] nice
[30:33] but shortly
[30:35] along along the path
[30:36] he comes and
[30:37] he he comes by this mountain of the law
[30:40] because we can do all these things in
[30:41] our own minds we can take we can we can
[30:44] try to be nice people and we can try to
[30:46] we can try to follow the law of god the
[30:48] best we can but it doesn't always sate
[30:51] the conscience inside of us
[30:53] and he pilgrim goes along mount sinai
[30:56] and there's that's typing the law of god
[30:57] and he's feeling i'm going to be
[30:59] condemned that is not good i'm going to
[31:00] be
[31:01] death is upon me unfortunately
[31:03] evangelist comes just the nick of time
[31:06] and evangelist does not speak nicely
[31:10] to a christian
[31:11] he rakes him over the coals
[31:14] i mean if christian were to be offended
[31:16] this is the place where he would get
[31:17] offended
[31:18] but he says what worldly wise man has
[31:21] preached to you with all his kind
[31:24] kind sounding words he sounds so nice
[31:27] what he has done
[31:28] he
[31:29] he has tried to take the cross out of
[31:31] your experience and any
[31:34] any any kind of spirituality or religion
[31:37] that takes the cross the blood jesus
[31:40] christ out of your religion out of your
[31:42] experience with god it does a disservice
[31:44] to you and that should be offensive to
[31:46] us
[31:47] because it sounds so nice worldly wise
[31:49] men said civility this is a place with
[31:52] nice people who wants to live with nice
[31:54] people yes we all do
[31:56] but if they're not
[31:58] if they haven't met jesus christ if they
[32:01] haven't if they haven't seen meth met
[32:03] the cross but filled with the holy ghost
[32:05] you won't be helped there you might feel
[32:07] good there sometimes but christ didn't
[32:10] come to make us feel good christ didn't
[32:13] come to make us nice people christ came
[32:16] for dead people to be made alive
[32:19] if you go to the doctor and go to get
[32:21] surgery done i'm not looking forward to
[32:22] having surgeries done you're going to
[32:24] get shots you're going to get cut you're
[32:26] going to be have things done you that
[32:27] are not nice
[32:29] but those things have to be done to get
[32:32] work on the inside if you have if you
[32:34] want your heart to be changed open heart
[32:36] surgery they take this soul and they cut
[32:37] through your sternum they might break
[32:39] some ribs because something in your
[32:41] heart needs changed it's not nice
[32:44] this doctors come with this thought
[32:46] doctor i want a nice doctor no you've
[32:48] got to have a doctor who's willing to do
[32:50] what needs to be done and a worldly wise
[32:53] man isn't that doctor
[32:55] in 2005
[32:57] the university of north carolina at
[32:59] chapel hill did a study of youth and
[33:02] religion and they studied the religious
[33:04] beliefs held by american teenagers and
[33:07] they conducted over three 000 interviews
[33:10] that's a lot to a lot of people to talk
[33:12] to
[33:12] i'm just i'm thinking here they're
[33:14] talking to folks who were teenagers in
[33:16] 2005.
[33:18] if they were 15 in 2005 they're going to
[33:20] be in their 30s now
[33:23] so um
[33:24] it says we'll just kind of see what they
[33:26] have to say about them but the dominant
[33:28] faith posture among american teenagers
[33:31] and indeed the culture at large the
[33:33] doctor the
[33:35] the the researchers summarized as
[33:37] moralistic
[33:38] therapeutic
[33:40] deism
[33:41] it says this is the this is the general
[33:43] religion of
[33:44] teenagers today and of our culture today
[33:48] i just want to spend a little bit
[33:51] reading
[33:52] reading about this because we're at a
[33:54] time
[33:56] remember we have a broken image of god
[33:58] inside of us
[34:00] that all of us do
[34:02] and god wants to repair the broken image
[34:05] the only way for that broken image to be
[34:07] repaired is for us to
[34:09] gaze upon the image of christ
[34:12] focus upon that
[34:13] and anything that tries to come between
[34:16] us and the true image of god it will be
[34:18] another image but it's going to keep us
[34:21] from being for knowing who we truly are
[34:25] and this moralistic therapeutic deism
[34:28] this describes the church today and if
[34:31] we're not careful it'll get in our homes
[34:33] how we even tell our bible stories how
[34:34] we tell our kids what it means to serve
[34:37] god it's not always a happily ever after
[34:39] ending in every single area of our life
[34:42] it can it can affect us
[34:48] on your next slide
[34:49] moralistic therapeutic deism what is it
[34:52] well it has five main uh main tenants or
[34:55] five laws about it first the idea god
[34:57] made the world to watch is over it
[34:59] um god's main purpose for us he wants us
[35:02] to be nice he wants us to be good and
[35:05] fair
[35:07] his main purpose for us according to
[35:09] moralistic therapeutic theism he wants
[35:11] us to be happy and feel good about
[35:13] ourselves
[35:14] and
[35:15] this is we we want this as well but
[35:19] you can have something that's
[35:20] that is con that is good but if it
[35:23] misses other things that are true the
[35:25] thing that you're being given is not a
[35:26] good thing
[35:29] nice people will live happily ever after
[35:31] there is an afterlife and if you're nice
[35:33] and good in this world you'll live
[35:34] happily ever after
[35:36] and lastly
[35:37] god does exist
[35:39] but he's cool with giving you your space
[35:42] he'll be there if you want him to be
[35:43] there but otherwise he's hands off do
[35:46] your own thing just be nice to everybody
[35:49] this is kind of a summary of moralistic
[35:52] therapeutic deism
[35:54] and one author says in a very real sense
[35:58] this idea of being nice kind pleasant
[36:01] respectful responsible working on
[36:03] self-improvement taking care of your
[36:05] health trying to be a successful person
[36:07] this sounds nice we want this and in a
[36:09] very real sense this appears to be true
[36:12] of a genuine faith commitment as well
[36:15] but insofar as this can be described as
[36:17] a faith commitment
[36:19] this is held by a large percentage of
[36:20] americans
[36:22] these individuals whatever their age
[36:24] believe that religion should be centered
[36:25] in being
[36:27] nice
[36:28] so whenever you try to take a stand for
[36:30] something taking a stand for anything is
[36:32] not going to be nice so kind of anything
[36:35] goes
[36:36] so it's moralistic in the sense that you
[36:39] have you got to be you've got to give
[36:41] general frame of what does nice behavior
[36:43] look like
[36:44] but it's therapeutic it wants to give
[36:47] therapeutic benefits to its adherence
[36:49] this is not a religion the researchers
[36:51] explained of repentance from sin or of
[36:54] keeping the sabbath or of living as a
[36:56] servant of the of of a sovereign god
[37:00] this is not a religion about saying
[37:02] prayers or observing holy days or
[37:04] building character through suffering
[37:06] or basking god's love and grace
[37:10] this is more a religion
[37:11] of spending yourself in gratitude for
[37:13] the cause of social justice
[37:16] it's about feeling good the dominant
[37:18] religion among u.s teenagers is
[37:19] essentially about feeling good happy
[37:21] secure in peace
[37:23] and this is the dominant religion in
[37:25] 2005 among teenagers that means these
[37:27] are our 30 year olds
[37:29] today
[37:31] it's about attaining subjective
[37:33] well-being being able to resolve
[37:34] problems getting along amiably with
[37:37] other people
[37:39] it's uh
[37:40] just being nice next slide
[37:46] it says god is something like a
[37:47] combination of the divine butler and the
[37:50] cosmic therapist he's always on call
[37:53] takes care of any problems that arise
[37:55] professionally helps his people feel
[37:56] better about themselves and does not
[37:59] become too personally involved in the
[38:01] process
[38:03] this is the rel this is the god
[38:06] the image of god
[38:08] that most people will carry today
[38:11] and there is not a church of moralistic
[38:13] therapeutic deism there's no
[38:14] denomination of that but the authors
[38:16] have kind of described this um this is a
[38:19] more of a dominant civil religion and
[38:22] they don't have their own church but
[38:23] they're almost colonizing
[38:26] the existing churches
[38:28] more people come to church saying these
[38:30] kinds of things that do sound nice but
[38:32] if you believe this without believing
[38:34] the cross without believing christ
[38:35] without believing the death of
[38:36] resurrection that he's in the need for
[38:38] the holy spirit
[38:39] you're saying some things that will
[38:41] sound you might sound like you're saying
[38:43] the same thing as a true believer
[38:44] sometimes
[38:47] but you aren't but but you aren't
[38:50] and it's this is this is a dangerous
[38:52] thing because
[38:54] the devil is giving us another image
[38:57] to be looking at that's going to keep
[38:59] the image of god
[39:01] within this
[39:03] from being repaired
[39:06] the authors of this study argue that
[39:07] this distortion of christianity has
[39:09] taken root not only in the minds of
[39:11] individuals but also in the structures
[39:14] of at least some christian organizations
[39:16] and institutions how can you tell
[39:18] the language and the experience of
[39:21] holiness sin grace justification
[39:24] sanctification heaven hell those things
[39:28] aren't often talked about
[39:31] right it's about being nice communion
[39:34] with god having good feelings
[39:37] be moralistic we're supposed to be good
[39:38] people supposed to feel good about
[39:40] ourselves or have some honor to to god
[39:43] and said about talking of these things
[39:44] the doctrine of the bible
[39:47] it's been these things have been
[39:49] supplanted by the language of happiness
[39:51] niceness and if you're nice
[39:53] you'll have some heavenly reward there
[39:56] at the end
[39:58] in this therapeutic age human problems
[40:00] are reduced to pathologies in need of a
[40:02] treatment plan
[40:03] sin is excluded from the picture and if
[40:05] you don't diagnose the problem right you
[40:07] won't deal with the sickness
[40:11] sins excluded from the picture doctrines
[40:13] like the wrath of god or the justice of
[40:15] god are discarded out of step with the
[40:18] times
[40:19] unhelpful to the project of
[40:20] self-actualization
[40:23] we're not supposed to be self-actualized
[40:25] you're supposed to be god-actualized
[40:27] but when we have a picture like this in
[40:29] front of us we want to become like this
[40:30] that is going to hinder
[40:33] the repair of the broken image of god
[40:35] inside of us
[40:43] when you think about
[40:44] this is the image of god that is
[40:46] preached
[40:47] in many churches throughout the country
[40:50] many places
[40:53] so even when even though we're made in
[40:54] the image of god
[40:56] the religious being that's offered in
[40:57] most churches is one where god of the
[40:59] god of the bible is largely absent
[41:03] that means there's no real mirror for us
[41:06] to see who we actually are just kind of
[41:08] think about in the dark ages had the
[41:10] devil do this he did it by doing the
[41:11] holster service in latin
[41:13] and now in our ssi today we have bibles
[41:17] everywhere you can get bibles get bibles
[41:19] anywhere you used to be thrown in jail
[41:21] for smuggling them now you can get them
[41:23] you can't you have you have a dozen
[41:24] bibles perhaps in your own house you
[41:26] have it on your telephone you have on
[41:27] any device you have them all over the
[41:29] place
[41:29] but it's deceiving us thinking that this
[41:31] is the god of the bible when it's not
[41:35] so there's no mirror for us now to see
[41:37] there is but we're not using it
[41:39] there's no mirror for us to see who we
[41:40] actually are so we're going to believe
[41:42] we are whoever the
[41:44] devil tells us we are
[41:47] and i just think that this if you look
[41:49] at
[41:50] many of the
[41:51] news stories and the some of the
[41:53] controversial issues in our day-to-day
[41:54] it has to do with
[41:56] teenagers especially but folks of all
[41:59] ages having an identity crisis who am i
[42:02] am i a boy am i a girl am i some
[42:05] combination between am i going from one
[42:07] what what is this why do we have this
[42:10] this huge identity crisis well the image
[42:12] of god has been shattered within us and
[42:15] now the the bible that tells us who we
[42:17] are who we're made to be has been subs
[42:20] the mirror's been put aside we're given
[42:23] you are whoever you're happy feeling you
[42:25] are
[42:26] and that's a moving target because one
[42:28] that you'll feel happy one way never you
[42:30] feel happy another way there's no real
[42:32] basis for who you are because the image
[42:34] of god has been shattered and our
[42:36] reference point for who we are the god
[42:37] in the bible has been pushed aside
[42:40] it's here though we can look at the word
[42:42] of god we can be changed more and more
[42:44] daily into his image we have to look at
[42:46] it and not take any substitute from the
[42:48] devil
[42:51] now the book of revelation talks about
[42:54] the bride of christ
[42:56] being clothed in white robes
[42:59] robes of righteousness
[43:01] and i just want to ask how is the modern
[43:04] church
[43:06] ever going to have
[43:07] such clothing
[43:10] if a religion without the cross is being
[43:12] preached
[43:13] if a religion without the blood is being
[43:16] preached
[43:17] a religion without the holy ghost is
[43:18] being preached repentance is not a fun
[43:22] feel-good process
[43:24] but it's very very necessary
[43:26] and if you're saying and as william
[43:28] booth said in this uh in this 20th
[43:30] century he's thinking there's going to
[43:32] be forgiveness without repentance i'm
[43:34] sorry but there is no forgiveness
[43:36] without repentance
[43:38] it's not it's not possible and if you're
[43:40] being told you'll be fine it'll be just
[43:42] fine but if you're not ever going
[43:44] through and repenting it's not fine
[43:49] if there's salvation without
[43:50] regeneration where regeneration is a
[43:53] work of the holy spirit where yes you
[43:54] come just as you are but you don't leave
[43:57] just as you were
[43:58] if you leave as you were you didn't meet
[44:00] anybody there at the altar
[44:03] so william booth is saying
[44:05] this coming century there'll be a great
[44:06] danger people will be thinking they have
[44:08] been forgiven but without having any
[44:10] repentance they'll think they're saved
[44:12] without being regenerated
[44:14] that's a lie
[44:16] a complete lie if this is the kind of
[44:18] thing that's being preached
[44:20] how will the ever how how will a church
[44:23] ever be clothed with robes of
[44:25] righteousness
[44:27] moralistic therapeutic deism does not
[44:29] clear spots wrinkles and such things
[44:32] from your clothes it does not
[44:34] let you be holding without blemish
[44:36] there's only one way for that that's for
[44:38] the blood of jesus christ to come and
[44:40] flow over us for us to be washed by the
[44:42] water of his word for his word but his
[44:45] anointing is being preached week and
[44:47] week out where we're fellowshipping not
[44:49] just around the world but in the spirit
[44:50] of the word with revelation of god
[44:52] that's the only way
[44:55] the only way
[44:57] for the bride of christ to be clothed
[45:00] in the white robes
[45:03] now there are many voices in the church
[45:05] world um
[45:07] i'm by far not the only one um
[45:09] many voices in in the church world who
[45:11] diagnose the problems with moralistic
[45:14] therapeutic deism and they're very good
[45:16] at diagnosing it much better than i am
[45:19] uh much better describing what's what's
[45:20] what's wrong with it but
[45:23] i i i'm going to suggest they're better
[45:25] at diagnosing than than treating
[45:28] so this moralistic therapeutic deism
[45:31] was published in a was described in the
[45:34] book written in 2005.
[45:36] in 2010 we could take a look at our next
[45:38] slide an evangelical pastor named david
[45:41] platt he published a book called radical
[45:45] taking back your faith from the american
[45:47] dream
[45:49] and in his book
[45:50] he critic he critiques the church for
[45:53] becoming like a corporation
[45:56] this uh
[45:57] church inc offers all kinds of benefits
[46:00] social centers daycare
[46:03] entertainment a consumer version of
[46:04] christianity and all these churches they
[46:07] compete for the local market share
[46:11] and many christians are simply pursuing
[46:14] in a spiritualized version
[46:16] of their worldly goals
[46:19] and
[46:21] one of the
[46:22] one of the pictures along with uh
[46:24] plant's book
[46:25] his diagnosis says
[46:27] we are not worshipping the jesus of the
[46:29] bible
[46:31] he's right
[46:33] he's right the american dream has taken
[46:35] over
[46:37] the church at large
[46:39] he gives a good diagnosis here
[46:42] his his treatment though his solution is
[46:45] that we should surrender our
[46:46] materialistic dreams i can say amen to
[46:49] that if we were to to
[46:51] to spend less and and and and and give
[46:54] more to uh in our tithes and offerings
[46:56] give more to charities to give more to
[46:58] other other other ways of helping the
[47:00] needs in the world that's a great thing
[47:01] he's suggesting do more mission projects
[47:03] in the third world
[47:06] live on a
[47:07] live on a percentage of your income give
[47:10] away a much larger percentage of it this
[47:12] is this is a great thing this will be
[47:14] killing the american dream within us
[47:17] there are great goals in these sets
[47:18] there's nothing to be said against them
[47:20] we'd be due to a lot better if we lived
[47:22] on less and gave our surplus to good
[47:23] causes
[47:25] but i'd say even though he diagnoses
[47:27] this really well
[47:29] his idea of living on less and giving
[47:31] more
[47:32] doesn't really restore a church
[47:35] who's held the doctrines of balaam
[47:37] who've gone into jezebel religion and
[47:39] estate who believes all kinds of things
[47:41] that are not true about god in the bible
[47:44] he gives a good diagnosis and it would
[47:46] be good if we spent less and gave more
[47:49] but we need
[47:50] something
[47:51] other
[47:52] than what he's prescribing what god
[47:54] prescribes god god looks at the very
[47:56] same situation if you read revelation
[47:59] chapter 3 when he looks at the loud to
[48:00] see in church age god is describing the
[48:03] very same things that these these the
[48:05] evangelical pastors would be describing
[48:07] this is this this this last stage church
[48:09] is going off the rails
[48:12] people are catching it they're
[48:13] diagnosing it but god's
[48:16] given god's description god's diagnosis
[48:18] knows notice god's treatment is
[48:20] different in revelation chapter three he
[48:22] says anoint your eyes with isaf
[48:24] if you look at revelation chapter 3
[48:26] revelation chapter 2 this is not a
[48:28] church that needs to give less or spend
[48:31] less and give more it's a church who
[48:33] needs to be restored back to what the
[48:35] church was at the beginning this is a
[48:37] that is god's uh treatment plan if we
[48:40] were to call it such
[48:43] so even though platts um
[48:46] plants treatment plan might be uh uh
[48:48] different than what god's was some of
[48:50] the things that he says in this book i i
[48:52] came across this first in the new york
[48:54] times book review years back
[48:56] but um this this sentence i just
[48:59] wowed me he says when we gather in our
[49:00] church building to sing and lift up our
[49:02] hands and worship we may not actually be
[49:04] worshiping the jesus of the bible
[49:07] instead we may be worshiping
[49:09] ourselves
[49:11] we may be worshipping ourselves he says
[49:14] and i get to thinking
[49:16] i always heard there's only two choices
[49:18] on the shelf pleasing god or pleasing
[49:20] self
[49:21] when we please self who are we really
[49:23] pleasing
[49:24] it's i can think back to isaiah isaiah 7
[49:27] or 14 i forget wish but satan
[49:31] lucifer wants to exalt himself above the
[49:33] stars of god he wants to be like the
[49:35] most high he's the first one who
[49:37] worships self that's right and whenever
[49:40] we take that spirit upon ourselves we
[49:42] want what we want i want to worship
[49:44] myself never take that spirit upon us
[49:46] we're not worshiping ourself it's really
[49:50] a nice looking version of worshiping
[49:52] lucifer
[49:53] and if you look at what he's saying
[49:55] in the church building singing and
[49:57] lifting our hands in worship
[49:58] you may not actually be worshipping
[50:00] jesus of the bible but worshiping
[50:02] ourselves
[50:03] and when i read this for the first time
[50:06] i maybe go back and think of a
[50:08] quote that brother branham i i'd heard
[50:10] of brother branham quoted many times
[50:12] and it can be honest as a teenager and
[50:14] i'd heard that when i would hear this
[50:16] quoted i kind of have the problem with
[50:18] it i didn't get it
[50:20] how is it possible for people brother
[50:22] branham says you'd be worshiping
[50:24] the devil thinking you were worshiping
[50:25] god how is that possible
[50:27] but if you look around us
[50:30] it's happening let's go to our next
[50:31] slide
[50:33] this is the message satan eden satan's
[50:35] eden the god of this world today the
[50:36] worshiped person of this world today is
[50:38] satan and the people are ignorant of
[50:41] worshiping satan but it's satan
[50:43] impersonating himself as the church see
[50:45] as the church
[50:46] they worship satan thinking they're
[50:49] worshiping god to the church
[50:52] and i had a hard time getting this
[50:54] but you know what
[50:56] if he's preaching this in 1965 i was
[50:59] hearing in the 1990s and i'm processing
[51:02] then things have gotten so much worse
[51:05] so much worse and you can see the shoe
[51:07] fits
[51:09] the shoe fits
[51:10] and what we need today we don't need
[51:12] somebody to tell us how good we are help
[51:14] us feel good about ourselves we need
[51:17] a prophet to come out of the wilderness
[51:18] and say this is what's wrong with you
[51:20] this is god's solution wake up
[51:23] we need somebody you know they were
[51:25] teaching in sunday school class about
[51:26] the wise and foolish virgins last week
[51:28] in matthew 25 it says all 10 of them
[51:31] were asleep
[51:33] all of them were asleep so
[51:35] why is virginia start feeling good i'm
[51:37] i'm the good one no none of us are
[51:39] because all of them were asleep and when
[51:41] you have to wake somebody up i have to
[51:43] to my kids
[51:45] uh in in the morning getting ready for
[51:47] school you're not a nice person when you
[51:49] wake somebody up in the morning
[51:50] you're not
[51:52] i had we had a
[51:53] fire a firefighter come to school this
[51:56] past week and talk about fire safety
[51:58] with the kids
[51:59] and
[52:00] he's talking about if if the fire alarm
[52:03] goes off and if the smoke run goes off
[52:04] in your house what are you supposed to
[52:06] do you get out and you stay out where
[52:08] you're supposed to go you have to go to
[52:09] your place of safe everything and he's
[52:11] talking about with these kids and he's
[52:12] the he's the fire inspector he's this
[52:15] this is his thing he goes through
[52:16] schools teaches about it he says you
[52:18] know kids you should be having you
[52:20] should be having fire drills in your
[52:22] homes several times that you'd be doing
[52:24] that so that if there's a fire happen
[52:26] you need to be ready knowing exactly
[52:28] what to do he says my wife mrs myers she
[52:31] doesn't like when i do fire drills
[52:32] because i do fire drills at six in the
[52:34] morning and eleven at night like ah
[52:37] wow this is not a nice guy making
[52:39] everybody think's going off six in the
[52:41] morning
[52:42] not nice but he's seeing value most
[52:46] fires happen and everybody's asleep i
[52:48] want to get my folks up and out i don't
[52:50] care if my kids are crying if my wife's
[52:52] upset with me i want them out
[52:55] that's what we need that's what we need
[52:59] next slide
[53:02] satan is good at misconstruing parts of
[53:04] scripture that applies to the day
[53:07] he'll let you know all that moses did
[53:08] was perfectly well
[53:10] the scribes and pharisees had that what
[53:12] moses did was perfect it was great but
[53:15] when they were when they rejected jesus
[53:18] christ
[53:19] the table that had been for their
[53:20] benefit became made a snare became a
[53:22] trap
[53:24] when you take the promises that they
[53:25] gave for this day and then apply it to
[53:27] another age that's the devil's good at
[53:29] misapplying it
[53:30] that's all he has to do see is to get
[53:32] the people to believe it that way and
[53:34] that's all he doesn't have to translate
[53:35] the bible into latin he doesn't have to
[53:37] block the app and the whole country he
[53:40] just has to get you to think this isn't
[53:42] for me
[53:44] he's accomplished his goal then
[53:47] he says people ignorantly worship satan
[53:50] thinking they're worshiping god
[53:53] and i think that's what that's the case
[53:55] we see in the time that we live
[53:58] ii thessalonians chapter 2.
[54:01] let's see here
[54:06] this is the next slide
[54:10] paul writes here let no man deceive you
[54:12] by any means
[54:13] actually i'll read verses one and two
[54:15] also we beseech you brethren by the
[54:16] coming of our lord jesus christ by our
[54:18] gathering together with him that ye be
[54:20] not soon shaken in mind or troubled
[54:22] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[54:24] letter as tramas is that the day of
[54:26] christ is at hand it's not yet paul says
[54:29] one of us reap one of the signs of his
[54:31] coming will be this let no man deceive
[54:32] you by any means for that day shall not
[54:34] come except there come a falling away
[54:36] first and that man of sin be revealed
[54:40] the son of perdition who opposes and
[54:42] exalts himself above all that is called
[54:44] god or that's worshiped so that he as
[54:47] god sits in the temple of god showing
[54:49] himself
[54:50] that
[54:51] he is god
[54:54] and here we have it being set up
[54:56] where satan is being
[54:58] seated and thrown in the church people
[55:00] are worshiping him thinking that it's
[55:03] that they're worshiping
[55:04] god now the book of revelation describes
[55:10] clearly an attempt of the devil
[55:12] to substitute another image for the
[55:15] image of god
[55:17] maybe we can turn over to revelation
[55:18] chapter 13.
[55:25] now in jesus day there was a
[55:28] large group of jews
[55:30] who would been following moses
[55:35] were who were religious
[55:37] and the church age book
[55:39] brother branham says as israel the
[55:40] chosen people of god in majority
[55:43] when they rejected jesus they forfeited
[55:45] their rights in the book of life and he
[55:48] also says then so also will the majority
[55:50] of the gentile church
[55:52] come into condemnation with the
[55:54] resultant removal of their name from the
[55:56] book of life
[55:57] by rejecting the word
[55:59] and thereby entering into the world
[56:00] ecumenical movement which is the image
[56:02] directed to the beast
[56:05] and that's when i read that statement a
[56:07] month or two ago i was that's a huge
[56:10] statement
[56:11] the majority of the names
[56:13] of the majority of the gentile church
[56:15] kept their names moved from the book of
[56:16] life
[56:17] but think about the majority of the
[56:19] gentile church
[56:22] what's being preached
[56:23] if it's moralistic therapeutic deism
[56:26] there's nothing there
[56:28] that'll let your robe
[56:30] be white and righteous there's nothing
[56:33] there that'll do that for you
[56:36] next slide
[56:37] revelation 13.
[56:42] i beheld another beast coming up out of
[56:44] the earth and he had two horns like a
[56:46] lamb and he spake is a dragon he
[56:48] exercises all the power of the first
[56:50] beast before him and causes the earth
[56:52] and then which dwell therein to worship
[56:53] the first beast whose deadly wound was
[56:56] healed and that brother branham
[56:59] commenting about the scripture says it's
[57:00] another beast coming out of the earth
[57:03] and it has two horns like a lamb
[57:05] go back a slide maybe
[57:09] again yeah another one
[57:11] here we go
[57:12] um
[57:13] now
[57:14] if we hadn't seen what a buffalo was
[57:17] this is these are baby buffaloes but if
[57:20] you can put yourself in john's position
[57:22] what would you call these
[57:24] animals yeah is it a cow is it what is
[57:28] it exactly
[57:31] so he says yeah like like a lamb next
[57:33] and you can see
[57:35] next slide so you can see who it is
[57:37] there's a you see by looking at the
[57:39] parent you see the identity is go on
[57:41] then brother branham says this this
[57:43] creature next slide like a lamb coming
[57:45] out of the earth this unpopulated region
[57:48] the sea is filled with multitudes of
[57:49] people but this buffalo comes this land
[57:51] animal comes up out of the it says out
[57:53] of the united states this is this is
[57:54] this was the last frontier as it were
[57:58] and
[57:59] it speaks of another beast coming up out
[58:01] of the earth who's going to succeed in
[58:03] making an image to the beast
[58:05] that everyone in the world would worship
[58:08] and i just want to uh this is this is
[58:10] not new news
[58:11] but about 10 or 11 years ago pope
[58:14] francis
[58:15] he's been exceptionally effective in
[58:17] expanding the ecumenical movement he's
[58:20] making inroads in all kinds of in all
[58:22] kinds of churches
[58:23] especially among american charismatics
[58:26] but
[58:27] in february 2010 he spoke to kenneth
[58:30] copeland's word of faith ministries next
[58:32] slide
[58:34] and he speaks by uh by iphone and he
[58:36] says let's each give each other a
[58:38] spiritual hug and let god complete the
[58:40] work that he has begun
[58:42] a work of unifying us all together and
[58:45] kenneth
[58:46] kenneth copeland all these other men and
[58:48] women they thought this was just a a
[58:51] wonderful wonderful thing
[58:53] and the america an anglican
[58:56] bishop
[58:58] before he plays this video message
[59:00] this bishop palmer speaks to the crowd
[59:02] and says when my wife saw that she could
[59:04] be catholic and charismatic and
[59:06] evangelical and pentecostal and he was
[59:08] absolutely accepting the catholic church
[59:10] she said she'd like to reconnect her
[59:12] roots with the catholic church so she
[59:14] did
[59:15] and this is what the book of revelation
[59:17] talks about so are the so is the mother
[59:19] so are the daughters coming back
[59:21] together and the crowd cheered and
[59:24] palmer continues brothers and sisters
[59:26] luther's protest is over is yours
[59:29] and
[59:30] kenneth copeland after he uh after the
[59:32] next slide
[59:35] today this this this gathering his
[59:37] comment on this was heaven is thrilled
[59:38] over this you know what is so thrilling
[59:41] to me when we went to the ministry 47
[59:43] years ago
[59:44] this was impossible
[59:46] and
[59:47] if you look at what happened in jesus's
[59:49] ministry around the crucifixion
[59:51] people who were at odds with one another
[59:54] were unified
[59:56] in their condemnation of of christ
[59:58] pilate and herod they were political
[1:00:01] enemies
[1:00:02] but in getting together to condemn
[1:00:04] christ john says they became friends
[1:00:07] jesus unified them
[1:00:09] the sadducees and the pharisees they'd
[1:00:11] been at each other's throats if you
[1:00:12] watched the chosen that's kind of
[1:00:13] alluded to
[1:00:15] these groups of the pharisees who don't
[1:00:16] get along all these politicking that
[1:00:19] that's alluded to but jesus brought them
[1:00:21] all together the scribes the pharisees
[1:00:23] the sadducees the herodians all these
[1:00:25] different groups came together and they
[1:00:27] joined to condemn jesus
[1:00:29] and
[1:00:30] matthew 13 says
[1:00:33] there before the rapture will take place
[1:00:34] there'll be a gathering
[1:00:36] and here we see
[1:00:38] a gathering of many many tears
[1:00:41] back to the roman system and uh
[1:00:44] pope francis we don't know uh how long
[1:00:46] he'll be pope or what but not but he's
[1:00:47] done really good job at gathering people
[1:00:49] together first with the the waldendians
[1:00:52] a group in italy that the catholic
[1:00:53] church had just martyred and persecuted
[1:00:56] terribly in the middle ages but he went
[1:00:58] to tour to apologize for that and uh and
[1:01:02] to draw them back together
[1:01:04] the lutheran so as if there was ever a
[1:01:06] big break with rome that would be it but
[1:01:08] many lutheran nominations have renewed
[1:01:11] ties with the vatican pentecostals
[1:01:13] charismatics and if we look about this
[1:01:16] is a this is a pope who's all about
[1:01:18] gathering people in i mean this pope
[1:01:21] writes encyclicals not just about
[1:01:23] doctrinal matters but about climate
[1:01:24] change he's associating himself with
[1:01:27] every woke popular cause this is a man
[1:01:30] this is this is an office who'll be
[1:01:32] gathering people together
[1:01:34] and what's going to be happening brother
[1:01:36] braham talks about the message christ is
[1:01:38] the mystery
[1:01:40] this would be an or an
[1:01:43] organizational association of ministers
[1:01:45] to make an image to the beast as the
[1:01:46] bible said
[1:01:48] a lot of people who might not go and
[1:01:49] worship
[1:01:50] there in the vatican they'll be
[1:01:52] worshiping in their own churches
[1:01:54] but they've they've made an image to the
[1:01:56] beast
[1:01:57] and they're in their protestant churches
[1:01:59] which brings the worship back to the
[1:02:01] beast himself
[1:02:05] what shall we do with jesus brother
[1:02:06] branham says today the protestants are
[1:02:08] throwing themselves together in the
[1:02:09] ecumenical council doing the same thing
[1:02:11] grafting in tradition of man instead of
[1:02:13] taking the word of god which is
[1:02:15] thoroughly identified by the holy ghost
[1:02:16] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:18] forever
[1:02:20] the church stand in the balance today
[1:02:22] and is found wanting your back and
[1:02:24] pilates judgment hall yes sir
[1:02:26] what does it do it's making an image to
[1:02:28] the beast it's a satellite to rome when
[1:02:30] the ecumenical council is forcing and
[1:02:32] will force every protestant nomination
[1:02:36] to do it
[1:02:37] he says what is it protestant harlots
[1:02:40] with the old mother rome the great
[1:02:43] this protestant nomination to do that
[1:02:46] what do we need today
[1:02:50] i would say that we need the wake-up
[1:02:52] call of matthew 25.
[1:02:54] we look in revelation chapter 3.
[1:02:57] i'm closing here so if musicians want to
[1:02:58] come you you're welcome to
[1:03:03] verse 14 under the angel of the church
[1:03:06] of the laodiceans write these things set
[1:03:08] the amen the faithful true witness the
[1:03:10] beginning of the creation of god
[1:03:12] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:03:14] cold nor hot i would that were cold or
[1:03:17] hot
[1:03:18] the legacy in church i would say is nice
[1:03:22] nice isn't hot not nice not cold it's
[1:03:25] just nice water
[1:03:27] that's what the legacy in church is so
[1:03:29] then because you're
[1:03:31] lukewarm just nice
[1:03:33] not on fire for god just nice
[1:03:36] i'll spew the out of my mouth because
[1:03:37] you say i'm rich increased with goods
[1:03:39] have need of nothing i'm exercising the
[1:03:41] american dream fulfilling the american
[1:03:43] dream in my church
[1:03:45] because you think you you feel good
[1:03:46] about yourself you think you think
[1:03:48] you're great you don't know
[1:03:51] that you're wretched miserable poor
[1:03:52] blind and naked what's his advice i
[1:03:56] countless the buy of me gold
[1:03:58] tried in the fire that you may be rich
[1:04:00] true riches white raiment that you'll be
[1:04:02] clothed that the shame of your naked
[1:04:04] does not appear and anoint thine eyes
[1:04:05] with i said
[1:04:07] that thou mayest see
[1:04:09] that i salve is what we need and it can
[1:04:12] be i understand um
[1:04:14] i'm putting on a tape brother branham
[1:04:16] sometimes that can be a hard voice
[1:04:19] it can it can rub against the grain it
[1:04:22] can make you feel uncomfortable
[1:04:23] sometimes
[1:04:25] that's what we need
[1:04:27] and i would just encourage you
[1:04:30] take a look at
[1:04:32] make time
[1:04:33] for god
[1:04:35] make time to play a to play a tape
[1:04:38] make time to read a message
[1:04:40] because you know what we ask
[1:04:42] just like the scribes and pharisees they
[1:04:44] had their idea of what they want how
[1:04:45] they wanted god to come they wanted him
[1:04:48] to come on a white charger
[1:04:50] knocking the heads of all the romans off
[1:04:52] and sometimes we wish perhaps people
[1:04:54] would wish that god would have seen a
[1:04:55] theologian
[1:04:56] who could give a well-reasoned
[1:04:59] explanation of this or that
[1:05:01] god didn't send a theologian
[1:05:03] god sent a prophet
[1:05:06] he's in the prophet within the anointing
[1:05:08] and that's what we need
[1:05:11] because the anointing of the world it's
[1:05:12] everywhere you go into you go through
[1:05:14] the stores you you peruse your phone
[1:05:17] that anointing is there i need this i
[1:05:19] need that distractions i think i don't
[1:05:21] have time for god we think we don't have
[1:05:23] time to do this well how can i do it
[1:05:24] brother i'd say take on you take a look
[1:05:26] on your phone there's usually a screen
[1:05:28] time app they say how much time do i
[1:05:30] spend on my phone
[1:05:31] if you're talking three or four hours
[1:05:33] try just giving 10 percent of that
[1:05:37] because we've got
[1:05:38] that that time that we spent on our
[1:05:39] screen that's usually disposable time
[1:05:41] where you could be doing something else
[1:05:43] but you're just
[1:05:44] vegging
[1:05:46] just give a little bit of that time
[1:05:47] because i don't have time check how much
[1:05:49] time you actually have on your app it'll
[1:05:52] tell you how much time you actually have
[1:05:54] and there's probably something better we
[1:05:56] can do with that time
[1:05:58] by listing
[1:05:59] god that's described our day with such
[1:06:02] clarity and the devil has pushed that
[1:06:05] aside
[1:06:06] getting us to push that aside
[1:06:08] maybe our last slide sorry
[1:06:11] what's the uh
[1:06:12] what's the solution
[1:06:14] second corinthians 3 18 we all with open
[1:06:16] face beholdings in the glass the glory
[1:06:18] of the lord as we behold the glory of
[1:06:21] god we're changed into that same image
[1:06:24] from glory to glory
[1:06:27] get the true accurate image of god
[1:06:29] before you look at him next slide and
[1:06:32] that'll tell you who you're supposed to
[1:06:34] be
[1:06:34] who are you supposed to be i think i
[1:06:37] can't do it i'm a sorry excuse for a
[1:06:39] christian but if you start looking in
[1:06:40] god's word his word will tell you what
[1:06:43] you're going to be where you're supposed
[1:06:45] to be who your daddy is that's where you
[1:06:47] need to go
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:55] let's stand and pray
[1:07:02] heavenly father
[1:07:03] thank you very much lord for
[1:07:06] for your word father
[1:07:09] i thank you lord that you've given us
[1:07:12] exactly what we need
[1:07:16] lord i thank you for
[1:07:18] a message that goes and and wakes the
[1:07:21] sleeping person up
[1:07:22] that says the bridegroom's coming go out
[1:07:24] to meet him go out to meet and the
[1:07:26] bridegroom's coming as long as we can
[1:07:28] just roll over and
[1:07:30] look at our phone and see what's going
[1:07:31] on i'm too tired to go out to meet him
[1:07:33] no the bridegroom's coming go out to
[1:07:35] meet him
[1:07:37] lord i pray o father you would
[1:07:40] shake us also
[1:07:43] wake us lord
[1:07:44] that we might see where we are
[1:07:48] paul said the last days won't come upon
[1:07:50] you except unless this this thing
[1:07:52] happens first
[1:07:54] or someone's going to be set up in the
[1:07:56] temple of god calling himself as though
[1:07:58] he were god even though he's not and
[1:08:00] we see that happening
[1:08:02] check
[1:08:03] or we see these things happening around
[1:08:05] us
[1:08:06] we see you being pushed out i mean
[1:08:08] there in the laodicean church age
[1:08:10] brother brethren said look christ is on
[1:08:12] the outside of the church
[1:08:14] and if we look at the doctrine of
[1:08:15] moralistic therapeutic deism that's
[1:08:18] preached and believed by many christians
[1:08:20] today you're not in it you're outside
[1:08:22] that church knocking to get in
[1:08:26] lord i pray o father that you would
[1:08:28] anoint our eyes with isaf
[1:08:31] lord i pray that you would help us to
[1:08:33] take time each day
[1:08:35] to spend with you because my atmosphere
[1:08:38] of the world is just like a poison gas
[1:08:42] you can go into your house get a gas
[1:08:44] leak you won't realize it you'll be
[1:08:45] affected by you'll be sickened by it
[1:08:48] help us lord
[1:08:49] have our eyes anointed each and every
[1:08:51] day lord breathing the pure heir of your
[1:08:54] word oh god
[1:08:56] lord i pray that when we do that
[1:08:59] we may not even understand everything we
[1:09:00] listen to oh i've heard this a gift
[1:09:03] through the sermon so many times he's
[1:09:04] still in this story again i don't care
[1:09:07] because there's a spirit with it
[1:09:09] god is moving with that there's an
[1:09:11] anointing upon it i want that anointing
[1:09:13] because he says anoint your eyes with
[1:09:15] eyes
[1:09:16] anointing is available
[1:09:20] just want to say if there's anybody that
[1:09:21] says war
[1:09:22] pray for me i need that i need that
[1:09:25] anointing upon my eyes
[1:09:29] raise your hand i'll pray for you
[1:09:30] because i've had a hard time before in
[1:09:32] the past i've had a hard time accepting
[1:09:34] the message because it seems so hard and
[1:09:36] rough sometimes i understand that
[1:09:38] but that's what we need help me to
[1:09:40] accept what god's given yes i'll pray
[1:09:43] for you on that i know what you're
[1:09:45] saying
[1:09:46] lord i thank you for each heart lord
[1:09:48] who's sensitive and open
[1:09:50] lord i pray that you'd move and but as
[1:09:53] we take a step toward you your word says
[1:09:55] you will take a step toward us
[1:09:57] and we can't even take a step toward you
[1:09:59] without you pulling on our heart first
[1:10:01] it all starts with you
[1:10:03] if you're here today
[1:10:04] god's working on your heart it's god you
[1:10:07] can't have come to church without god
[1:10:09] working and pulling you in some way
[1:10:11] recognize that you are a daughter of god
[1:10:13] you're a child of god god has a plan for
[1:10:15] your life
[1:10:16] wonder who am i i'm so confused look on
[1:10:18] the word of god because that is the only
[1:10:20] true accurate image of who we are
[1:10:24] i pray oh god you would help us to stare
[1:10:27] into that gaze upon it we might be
[1:10:29] changed more and more in your image each
[1:10:31] and every day o god
[1:10:33] bless each heart i pray in jesus name
