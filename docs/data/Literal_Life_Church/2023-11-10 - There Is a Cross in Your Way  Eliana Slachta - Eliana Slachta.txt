There Is A Cross In Your Way

Lyrics:
Verse 1
It isn't easy to end up in Hell
Heaven built a barricade 
Time rotted the wood
And rusted the nails
But there is still something
That stands in your way

Chorus
There is a cross in your way
A wall of mercy and grace
There's just one way
Your soul can be lost
You gotta trample the blood
Climb over the cross
No it's not easy to stray
There is a cross in your way

Verse 2
Hell's getting bigger 
The gate's open wide
The road gets broader every hour
And your easy street living
Just letting things slide
You can't skip down the lane
And just pick the wild flowers

Written by Misty Freeman
