my supplications because he had inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as soon as i leave hallelujah somebody see a god answers prayer it's worth of what you've been called upon all

soul gracious is the lord and righteous yeah our god is merciful the lord preserved this simple i was brought low and he helped me amen has anyone ever had ever been brought low like that oh i've that's me right there i've been there so many times i was down casted with the gideon no hope and something happened after i prayed it brought him back to my set my feet and we're having the same god

me i will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord he met somebody god bless my have a seat tonight what is the call of salvation the last time i said i heard the person announcing the communion coming up in few days every time i come to the house of god they went coming on service and that one was giving trust when the coming unwind that one represent the blood of christ eli amen somebody we're not saved by that one we are saved by the blood of christ the cup of salvation amen amen also james chapter five you have a bible quickly james 5 13 to 18 the power of prayer prayer changes things is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let me sing psalms is anything among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anoint him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up not only that and if he are committing sins they shall be forgiving him i love that i don't hear somebody and letting the sick oil enforce the blood of jesus christ not only to heal the sick but to enforce forgiveness of sin even suffer the bible says amen confess your faults one to another and pray one for another pray for one another why the ye may be healed the virtual foreign prayer of a righteous man a villain much means it's very powerful amen elias was a man's subject to like passions as we are and he prayed they might not rain and it rained not on the earth for the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit my what prayer can do tonight are you with me something on somebody the power of prayer prayer changes things we found out prayer is an integral part of a christian life they're inseparable someone said in nigeria some years ago brother josiah he said a prayerless prayerless christian is a powerless christian you don't pray as a christian you know no you don't got no power amen and brother ken in the book of proverbs 24 10 24 verse 10 says if thou faint in a day of adversity thy strength is small if you're weak in prayer when the enemy attacks you you're going to pour the center it means somebody and children of god we cannot faint now in this hour that we believe in him and these troubles hour that we're living in the world today since the past two years our has changed is that true that's this has changed and it should not be the same anymore never now they are talking about uh micro or omega omicron variant god have much upon us so why wouldn't we play with pray then being not he did not but the devil harassing people of god when we finally in the beginning of creation when i was still in eternal relationship with god there was no need for him to pray bro ken he has no need to pray in the beginning why dada was a little god on earth amen he didn't have to pray i would not need to pray today as god's people is over the fall of genesis 3. amen and the reason why we pray today is to have our faith when you have a problem in your life and they will try to bother your mind and someone reminds you that i already pray about it that comes your knives down that's gonna be okay so we pray today to help our faith amen but very soon we don't we're not gonna need to pray anymore i mean somebody after our full restoration back to eden remember baron told us in their message christ beast of god revealed that christ is written this day god is doing this in the last day of messenger prophet ministry for three things three reasons one to reveal who god is to know who god is hallelujah somebody because now we know god is not jesus is not they don't tell person personal trinity anymore jesus almighty god he is the earth to see of god hallelujah somebody and suddenly he was revealed to have preeminence in his bride hallelujah somebody and thirdly to restore the kingdom back to eden where adam fell from all right and when christ was here on earth san francis and john the baptist followers quoted jesus why is disciples are not fasting would you know fast and go prayers if you have any issues in your life any problem in your life and you're having a problem delivering for victory just go faster with it it will happen you see the result right right right right quick fasting always prayer amen and you just told the disciples the accusers how can they mourn or fast when i'm still here with them but once i'm taken from them no one will need to teach them a reminder of the fast list of the marks mark chapter 2 mark 2 verse 18 mark 218 example of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but the disciples passed not and that was look rabbi we fast all the time but your stuff are taking taking it easy and you just say not to them can the children of the bride chamber fast while the blood may still with them you know after i'm with them they don't need to fast or pray amen like the word that like that were children of i lied about when they said of the brass chamber amen and we are the chin of the blood chamber today remember about the pyramid in the pyramid i don't know a person will take care of that maybe sometimes to show us in their pyramid there is a stair which you've got gallery grand gallery which originally have seven steps that that have seven churches and it leads to the king's chamber hallelujah if you have studied before and at the end of that seventh step that's where we are today we are at the end of the seventh church age which they call a secret chamber in that pyramid we are right now in the supreme chamber in the little spot out of ladies are called the bride's age amen is it is a place of preparation to meet the king amen somebody and that's why we are today we are shot in a guard in the second place or somebody we are willing to be taken into the inner place hallelujah to meet our our king a husband very soon but those staff don't know how to pray with the jessie but they're in palestine i don't have to pray because the master is there with them they didn't prayers let's finish reading this in verse 20 of that marked mark second chapter the lord said but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days you cannot be in god's presence presence 24 7 i need prayers you don't need it he means somebody like they were and you know we found out that after the law was taken from them they don't have to talk to pray they will quickly prepare a place in enough state and john marks after prayer meetings right they're praying they are praying and fasting every day and they're in that prayer mode on the illegals came down day of pentecost amen remember one crowd was even alive they don't pray they don't pray did they pray no but okay they don't know how to pray but the bible say jesus pray all the time we've seen the bible i heard that the lord would take them to the mountain and so you stay here you see that got a question stay here and you know go for that and lead them pray amen somebody i'll pray and after it's done he said oh come on let's go they don't they don't have they don't know how to pray one day they felt bad about they said lord please teach us how to pray and lord said when you pray you say our father which are in heaven hallelujah then and they taught them about we know this story amen praise the lord neither did adam need to pray in the beginning because it was god he didn't know the fasts in the garden of eden he wasn't fellowshipped with god he was eternal himself knew adam knew all things he was god over the earth so what need for prayers for other he doesn't need it none the bible told us that adam had dominion right at the beginning he was god over the whole earth why the almighty god was god about the whole universe and adam and eve and unicorns speak things to their existence they could create things with just their words hallelujah somebody adam has so much dominion so much that after god created all the animals he brought them to adam to name them why is that a bible and god said adam what do you call this he said you be called lion what about this you are leopard what about you you eagle what are you you dove and that's the name of this column today that's what i call dominion amen somebody come to genesis 2 genesis 2 verse 9 19. genesis verse 19 to 20. and under the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fall of the air and brought them onto adam to see what he will call them and whatever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof now that's what i call doing dominion that's authority amen that's why he didn't pray it has an eternal dominion kingship over the earth amen i kind of love how the holy ghost describes adamic dominion in the bible we turn to some some chapter eight psalms eight verse five which paul quoted in hebrews 1 verse 10 to 14. psalm 8 verse 4 let's see how the bible describes adam's dominion i want to refer to that then feminine is very close say what is men that are mindful of him and the son of man that thou vist him but that has made him a little lower than the angels and that's crowning with glory and honor that we don't have dominion for the worst of their hands does put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen air and the beast of the field they follow the air and the fish of the sea and whatever passes passes through the paths of the seas oh lord our lord how excellent is the name in all the earth now tell me how can a man need prayer in this glorious supernatural condition he doesn't need it adam don't need to pray he doesn't need to no no he knows all things he lacked nothing amen he was king over the earth but after then came the fall of in genesis 3 which you all know the story oh they fell through the last of the serpent a man lost his dominion and kingdom through disobedience to god's word and he was killed of the garden of eden and i i'm glad tonight that is not the end of the story amen somebody aren't you glad tonight for god promised to redeem them back which he achieved by the blood on calvary eli amen and the goodness of our own association back to identities because where we have adam dominion kingship plus yes sir adam was truly kicking over the earth but he was on the priests christ shed the blood to redeem us he'd not only make us kings because we cut because priests unto god his father yeah version of chapter one verse five quickly we don't i don't want to i don't take your time tonight one close in a few minutes bear with me religion chapter one verse five and six and salish attention of john to the seventh seventh church or churches see from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and watched us from our sins in his own blood and made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen also revelation chapter 5 verse 6 to 10 it also says and i behave like lord in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as they have been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent from forth into the all to all the earth and he came unto the book under the right hand of him that sat upon the throne which is the book of redemption which is the bible the bible is the bible also he means somebody physically open revelation 10 verse 1. and when you're taking the book the four beasts and the four four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harp and golden vials full of order which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain and as redeemer redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto god our king our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth he means somebody and he found out that the the oppressor said this is why these elders are were just because because no one was found worried on art and have to open the to take the book until the lamb stepped out of the throne and checked the book and said john wept the bible says that also he wept because if nobody take the book you'll everyone is finished amen hallelujah somebody so we found out that after the fall of man the first one to start praying calling upon the name of the lord was said bible says so whom god gave adam to replace abel whom cain slew turn to genesis with me genesis chapter 4 verse 25 yes genesis 4 25 another knew his wife again and she based on and called his name seth for god said she had appointed me an an another seed instead of abel whom can sleep and to say to him also there was one son that called his name inus then began meant to call upon the name of the lord for the first time ever see certainly was something was wrong style rebecca he knew daddy and mommy messed up i knew i need god's help i can't bear this button alone and that should be a believer's attitude you're saying that i must tell jesus i must tell jesus i cannot bear my burdens alone hallelujah that's right attitude believers because there is power in prayers back to our test this tonight we read in a text today david saying in some psalm 116 i love the lord because he had heard my voice and my supplications because he had a clan his ear unto me therefore will like call upon him as long as i live and also in the book of james also we read jesus 5 verse 14 said is any man among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let me sing swarms send a sing among you let me call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and lord shall raise him up raise them up and we are committed since they shall be forgiving him i want to notice something of god that all does not heal you because the blood that heals you that blood is just a bumper to somebody that's a process it's a bumper between the one praying for you and the and the sickness because when you pray for the sick and you don't have faith it's going to come upon you but when i say as long as i know we have that all sister rebecca and that that will go back to hell where i come from so that all is a bumper even somebody that all does not hear what the blood of christ heals amen somebody thank you lord jesus the healing is an atonement he cried down on the cross it was double atonement brother brian brian this double atonement amen christ died for our saints sister sashiron he is all there for our sicknesses that's the bible isaiah 53 assassination 3 verse 4 as if it was proceeds surely absolutely he had borne our griefs and created our sorrows yeah we did esteem him stricken speaking of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities this church targeting our peace was upon him and with his stress we are healed hallelujah somebody see wonderful our transgression and with his strength were healed double atomized through the blood they met somebody that blood was shed that's isaiah looking at calvary in the future it was the prophet then promised then but after that after the blood was shaped like a lie many years after peter looked back to calvary he said by whose stripes you are healed now is past tense it's history you are healed already accept your healing somebody tonight amen somebody the power of prayers prayer changes things i just try to close on this thought to that tonight i really noticed today that people don't pray like they do in the past in this message pastor paul and first in the message we used to pray a lot is that not that pastor now we're kind of relaxed we everything comfortable around us when we are broke we have our credit cards we are sick we have our insurance to run to yet does not heal you he heals you hallelujah somebody he's the healer and he's here with us tonight if you assist now i challenge your faith to be healed you my lord will heal you amen somebody people are so soft they don't pray anymore they don't see any reason for it that's so sad we need to stop we're going to change to change from that and that's the answer this age last age let's look one minute blind and wretched are making and don't even know it what is that connection to be let's turn to revelation 3 verse 14 also where the holy ghost identify the spirit of this lucom age revelation 3 14 announcer unto the angel of the church of louisiana's right they sincerely even amen the fatal and true witnesses the beginning of the creation of god i know that works no i know you are that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that that was called a heart so then because that are lukewarm neither cold not hot you know why they are not cold or hot because they are sticking on the church the second bible but they're not off the power in christ they don't play anymore you know that some people don't even read the bible anymore they're going to turn to the bible they only draw something for all the pastor preached all the time shouldn't be like that no so it shouldn't be like that we feed on god's word as believers the bible the lord said men shall not only vibrate alone by every word alleluia somebody you cannot depend on what the preacher only preaches you must feed or need yourself new house verse 16 so then just give me a few more minutes okay sir so so versus said so then because that at lukewarm and neither corner hall i will spill the out of my mouth now i will throw you out of my presence 17 because thou said i am rich and increased with goods having known nothing and knowing us doubt not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked a council need to buy of me gold tried in the fire that there must be rich and white remain that there must be clothes and that the shame of their nakedness do not appear and anoint their eyes with eye serve that thou may see as soon as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock but the brown said that door is not though of the church that were taught in the organizations that dog is of our hearts amen somebody if any man or any woman hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and heal with me i'll leave somebody tonight the devil is giving us so much today on our place plates to hinder our from praying as we should as believers yet the bible says to pray without ceasing now do not stop praying 1st thessalonians chapter 5 verse 17 says so and in 42 verse 8 it says i will therefore that men pray everywhere and women women also lifting up holy hands without doubt thing and without wrath i'm doubting jeremiah verse 11 and 12 says if i know the thoughts that i think toward you say the lord the thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me i will i will hacking unto you amen somebody tonight my brother's my sister tonight the gossip the gospel answer prayers then yes he does of course he does god still answers prayers yes we read also in james chapter 5 17 and it is elias was a man subject to life passions that as we are sister jean and he prayed honestly that might not rain and rain not on the earth by the space of three years and six months a man like us and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit and guess what we are having the same god of elijah today the same god just tried to see me yesterday today and forever he does not chamber the kenny and just look at the cloud of witness that we have in the bible who have brought miracles through prayers email somebody i want to i'll just give one instant before i close tonight before the pastor take over look at for instant hannah in the book of first samuel first time in chapter one we know we we we know i heard it sure about about hannah and we go if you look at looks like in history from midrash and nagarash jewish women archives they said that anna was buried for 19 years that's a long time you will see the then bible but use archives that was banned for 19 good years and we founded a husband in kana and two her two wives hannah and the other one peninnah right and penina had children juana was barren for almost 20 years and to make it worse the other woman wife bernina and a children made fun of her all the time the bible said they provoked her soul amen that is the ridiculous the point of committing suicide but she did not give up what what what rather she choose the best option she chose to pray to overcome her trials over her name amen she did not stop coming to church she now could leave the message she's not on against the messenger she choose to pray brother angry hallelujah somebody may god give us more honest in these days i want to also hear satan's testimony you have a bible tongue tomato book of first simon chapter one first time in one verse nine before i close tonight so anna rose up after that well the bible said el canaan is what two wives traveled yearly from mount ephraim to shiloh to worship the lord and offer sacrifice every year this particular year when they got there with the dinner and as they were there and i went begin to pray to the lord to poor heart for god in prayers verse 9 of that chapter says suanna rose up after they are eaten in shiloh and after they are drunk now eli the priest sat up upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord and she was in bitterness of soul anna was and prayed unto god on the lord and what saw and survived and said oh lord of hosts if that will indeed look upon the affection of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmade but will give unto muhammad a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no result come upon his head what about the mixture rebecca said lord i'll make that child a nazirite unto you now i want to watch this now she spake in her heart only her lips moved then i was and i was praying she was playing her heart hallelujah somebody that should you can pray anywhere people of god you can print your car hallelujah somebody okay pray in this restaurant hallelujah in your heart covered brown said the angel they told me beyond the curtain of time that god our thoughts running louder before god than even our voice what is going on in your heart god hear us in heaven amen some of you have to be in the church to pray pray with us to somebody was trusted and she was trapped praying before the lord the eli marked her mouth thirteen now hannah hannah she is paid in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not hard therefore eli thought she had been drunken and he lies around to her how long will that be drinking put away that wine from thee and answered and said no my lord i am a woman of soulful spirits i have nothing neither wine nor stronger but i poured out my soul before the lord and that's how to the people of god pour out your heart before him that's what i'm saying jesus jesus said say say the lord is our is said the lord he said no i'm not trying to strike divers i said pour heart your heart before him for god is a refuge for us is our protection sister julie he's our shiddan buckler pour your heart behind like like anna amen sebastian said can't not the handmaid for a daughter of biliar the daughter of the devil for other than the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken heather to then he lie accidents and say go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou has asked of him my brother and sister tonight has to have closing did god answer hannah's prayers immediately yes he did for that same month she got pregnant amen she i have a bunch of baby boy she asked for a a man child god not the only give me my child god gave me a prophet not only a prophet a major prophet of the world samuel what prayer can do to the people of god you show that god is faithful amen if you have time to pray god has the time to answer sometimes we get discouraged because we don't see the evidence that our prayers have been answered by god but i want to show you tonight beloved god god answers prayers in one of the three ways i heard a god is that a god answer your prayer immediately i'll give you what you want want oh god don't answer you say god said no and you're moving with life or you is he said not yet to teach you patience amen isaiah said in isaiah fought four forty verses there forty verse that one said but they thou wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they are met up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint hallelujah somebody if god live prayers it's time to teach you patience god paul said because god deals with you as a as a son amen in isaiah also isaiah 59 verse 1 and 2 as everything never was isaiah 59 102. my bible said behold the lord's sand is not shutting that i cannot save neither is here heavy that i can't hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins had hid his face from you they were not here and what is the iniquity of god what's iniquity but the grant said iniquities know the writing and refuse to do it and sin is unbelieving the god's god's word amen it means somebody yet our lord still answers prayers for prayer changes things in the message of perfect faith but the brahman said name and that message prophet faith faith august 25 93 say if you're if you're a christian you have right to any redemptive blessings that jesus died for you for it's all yours it's already already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it another is yours and you can possess it oh that is the concrete faith amen somebody hallelujah somebody listen god does not answer your prayer on your own merits on how good you are or holy unrighteous you are no god answers prayer because he is faithful to his word in the message fellowship by redemption uh april 3rd 1955 brother brown said look god has never promised to meet any man upon his merits upon how good he is or how good she is he has never promised to meet them there there's there's no full relationship with god upon your own marriage the only place there is fellowship is under the shed blood hallelujah somebody i can have some jubilee dance now i can have them down some dance i feel like dancing now hallelujah because i ain't no good people of god i'm no good i'm a sinner saved by grace i'm not worthy people of god but he is worthy tonight he means somebody you know i i know you probably heard my testimony last time that i suffered stroke twice remember i told you here in the other church has struck swift twice my mother was still sideways sister becky my son was paralyzed in texas when i was working in the oil field my son last in florida he was here not long ago said that it's over for daddy you know you know i preach again what am i doing tonight there was a lie of somebody he is a loser hallelujah because our gossip answers pray at somebody and after god healing healing pastor apostle paul do you know how many sons have sent to the kingdom in nigeria i went to a convention i baptized 50 souls in one service one salmon what 50 people baptized in christ's name i went to colombia south america and when you suffer for god why because god answers prayers people of god you can't stop if you're a child of god you believe god no devil can stop you just learn to wait on him for god's sake answer prayers amen i'm going to read this quote in closing if you don't mind here quickly is that okay pastor thank you sir in the messy expectation um uh february 1761 but abram says was talking about i said what man cause great god calls foolish and well man calls foolish god calls grace so what we've got to do is get back into the program of god and find out after all what god wants us to do and the only way i know to do it is prayer amen prayer is the key that is the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb or as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of god did you know that he did this one time you know what i'm going to close pastor i'm sorry i'm trying to not to take time you know back night just some years back my father
