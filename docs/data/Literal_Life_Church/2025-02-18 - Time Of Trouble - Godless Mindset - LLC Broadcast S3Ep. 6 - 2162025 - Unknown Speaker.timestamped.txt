[5:54] well through it all through it all
[6:00] my eyes are on you and it is
[6:05] [Music]
[6:07] well with
[6:12] me I want to read from Romans chapter 12
[6:15] and we'll start with verse two be not
[6:18] conformed to this world but be ye
[6:21] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[6:24] how many know that we are not here to
[6:26] conform to the world to the mindset of
[6:29] the world but we're here to expose
[6:31] oursel to a presence and to the Lord's
[6:34] work that can bring real
[6:37] change and because it mentions being
[6:39] transformed and changed by the renewing
[6:41] of your mind then we must realize that's
[6:44] the place that God wants to work to
[6:46] change to cause us to grow it's in our
[6:48] thinking it's in our mind and so we can
[6:51] tie that back to the reason that we
[6:53] become conformed to the world it starts
[6:57] in the
[6:58] mind Satan starts in the mind and when
[7:00] we are conformed to that uh through the
[7:03] thinking then we conform to the ways of
[7:05] the world that's the way it works you
[7:07] turn that around our minds can be
[7:09] renewed and changed and transformed in
[7:12] our minds we can be renewed that we may
[7:14] prove what is that good and acceptable
[7:17] and perfect will of God I could safely
[7:20] say if you're interested in Walking in
[7:22] the will of God then you would be
[7:24] interested in God transforming and
[7:27] Renewing Your Mind If it's it's tied to
[7:30] the will of God and you want to be in
[7:31] the will of God then there's an exposure
[7:33] to the Lord to keep changing and
[7:36] renewing our
[7:37] thinking for I say through the grace
[7:39] given unto me to every man that is among
[7:42] you not to think of himself more highly
[7:45] than he ought to think my it deals with
[7:48] the pride of thinking and that our
[7:50] thoughts are always lower than God's
[7:52] thoughts and our thoughts have to come
[7:54] under submission to his thoughts don't
[7:57] think of yourself more highly than you
[7:58] ought to think but to think soberly and
[8:01] I would say humbly a humble thinking
[8:03] mind according as God hath dealt to
[8:06] every man The Measure of Faith so verse
[8:09] two is what I want to emphasize be not
[8:11] conformed to this world in the Amplified
[8:14] it says to this age don't be conformed
[8:17] to the age that you live in but be
[8:19] transformed and that's by the renewing
[8:22] or the renovation of the Mind a complete
[8:25] renovation of our
[8:27] thinking now if you don't think I I know
[8:29] ministers speak on the Holy Ghost and
[8:32] that is the new birth and that is
[8:34] essential you can't have the Mind
[8:36] affected and our thinking affected until
[8:39] you have some power in here to work in
[8:40] your life but once that power has come
[8:43] to the soul our growth as a Christian is
[8:47] our minds being changed our thinking
[8:50] being changed because when we think
[8:52] different and think like God thinks then
[8:54] our lifestyle will change now going back
[8:56] to that word conforming so that we
[8:59] understand it and I trust I have your
[9:00] attention this morning for the word of
[9:03] God I believe it'll be helpful to all of
[9:04] us that are here those that are
[9:06] listening online but conforming to the
[9:09] world uh has a Greek word meaning the
[9:11] Greek word for conform is systematical
[9:15] and it means to be molded according to a
[9:18] pattern so when you're conforming to
[9:20] something you're actually being molded
[9:23] and that's a process you're molded
[9:25] according to a pattern so there's a
[9:27] certain pattern there's a certain mind
[9:29] ET there's a certain way to do things
[9:31] and over time you are formed or you are
[9:34] molded according to that pattern the
[9:37] world has a pattern the world has a
[9:40] pattern of thinking and God has a
[9:42] pattern of thinking the world has a
[9:44] thing called the wisdom of this world
[9:46] and many times it looks very good but
[9:49] often it's in conflict with the wisdom
[9:51] of God and so every human being has to
[9:54] make a choice what they want to be
[9:56] conformed by and how they want their
[9:58] mind our minds some are quickly when
[10:02] we're young sometimes our minds are
[10:04] quickly turned over to be open as an
[10:06] inlet to any thought to any image um I
[10:10] could quickly go to the subject of
[10:12] pornography because uh it's been proved
[10:14] over and over again when uh young people
[10:16] are exposed to that at a young age that
[10:19] that affects their whole system
[10:20] especially their mind we don't quickly
[10:22] get those images out of our mind because
[10:24] it's the way that God has made our minds
[10:27] is that if we see an image or we read
[10:29] need something then we find it gets into
[10:31] our mind it gets lodged into our spirit
[10:34] and that's something that we can
[10:35] remember and then it can affect our
[10:37] behavior and lifestyle down the road
[10:40] that's why many men uh turn to certain
[10:42] things that have been addicted to that
[10:44] because eventually there's going to be
[10:45] an expression of what's been planted in
[10:47] your mind and so now this is the way God
[10:50] made our minds this is the way he makes
[10:52] us uh us work and so to be conformed
[10:55] means to be molded another Christian
[10:58] writer says conform to this world means
[11:00] to follow the common behaviors and
[11:03] trends of the society even if they don't
[11:06] align with your personal convictions now
[11:09] can you imagine that the world's
[11:11] influence can be so strong through what
[11:13] thoughts it puts in our mind that it
[11:15] actually can take someone's personal
[11:17] convictions that they've always held
[11:20] that's what they believe maybe they were
[11:21] raised in it and they become personal
[11:23] convictions maybe they're God's
[11:25] convictions but they became personal if
[11:27] you let this happen this power can
[11:30] undermine personal convictions and all
[11:33] of a sudden you start conforming to the
[11:36] behaviors and trends of
[11:38] society and it all happens the same way
[11:41] for every one of us whether you've been
[11:43] in the message 30 years or whether you
[11:44] had not serving the lord it doesn't
[11:46] matter you're not above everybody you
[11:48] see your mind works the same way and
[11:51] what you put in that computer what you
[11:53] feed on in that computer the inlets to
[11:56] our spirit is what will determine our
[12:01] Behavior praise the Lord he goes on to
[12:04] say this writer he says this can involve
[12:06] this conforming can be Evol uh in uh
[12:10] involve adopting popular Styles beliefs
[12:13] and values being drawn to the world
[12:15] imitating the world studying how the
[12:17] world acts dressing like the world being
[12:20] influenced by people who are opposed to
[12:23] God maintaining friendships with
[12:25] Believers or antagonist neglecting God's
[12:29] means of Grace failing to engage in
[12:32] private and family worship and so now
[12:34] this is all part of conforming to the
[12:38] ways of the world because it starts with
[12:40] the mind but it's a conforming of our
[12:42] Behavior to those things and so
[12:44] according to the Bible Christians he
[12:46] says can escape the world's grip of
[12:48] Conformity is s suggestions he makes
[12:51] renewing their minds through the gift of
[12:53] the Holy Ghost I agree with that we can
[12:55] renew our minds this is how we counter
[12:57] that we allow our minds and thinking to
[13:00] be renewed by what by the power of the
[13:03] Holy
[13:03] Ghost he says looking to
[13:06] Jesus he says placing their everyday
[13:09] life before God is an offering fixing
[13:11] their attention on God these are all
[13:13] things I agree with is that when a
[13:15] person would turn their attention
[13:16] towards God sometimes I've watched
[13:18] people just turn more of their attention
[13:20] toward the things of God let go of some
[13:22] of the things they're feeding on and
[13:24] start their attention towards the things
[13:26] of God and just that in itself helps
[13:28] them to break break out of that
[13:30] Conformity to the world and Conformity
[13:32] to the mindset of the world he says
[13:34] recognizing what God wants for them and
[13:36] responding quickly so I agree with all
[13:38] those I think those are good so now my
[13:41] question is how do we finally conform to
[13:43] it where does it start when someone
[13:45] conforms to the lifestyles of the world
[13:48] where does it start starts in the
[13:51] mind it must start in the mind first and
[13:55] the devil knows that he must for form
[13:59] your thinking before he forms your
[14:03] lifestyle before he controls you to
[14:05] conform to something that maybe
[14:07] initially you didn't even want to
[14:09] conform to it but before he would go and
[14:11] say I want you to dress this way or act
[14:13] this way I want you to act out this and
[14:15] I no he has to slowly work in your
[14:18] thinking first the only thing that we
[14:21] have left that we can protect and guard
[14:24] over is our hearts and our minds
[14:29] we can't change anything else but the
[14:32] Bible says we can have our thinking
[14:38] transformed in other words if we'll be
[14:40] on guard and we'll put the scripture
[14:41] there for a guard he says he'll protect
[14:44] that and that's an area Satan can't get
[14:47] to if we'll protect it but that's the
[14:50] part Satan wants to get to he would love
[14:52] to get your soul but if you're
[14:54] predestinated of God and you've received
[14:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan
[14:57] can't get in the soul anymore he's been
[14:59] locked out you've been sealed in Christ
[15:02] has been sealed in until ET through
[15:04] eternity can you say Amen Satan can't
[15:07] get the soul it's almost like Satan
[15:09] couldn't get job to deny his God and
[15:11] stop his God so the only part he was
[15:14] left with is Job's life his family his
[15:17] Spirit his emotions his mind can you say
[15:20] amen and actually God said go at it
[15:23] because I've Got Confidence in job go at
[15:25] it have you considered job now job
[15:28] didn't know that but if he' have known
[15:30] that he' say God what what are you doing
[15:33] to me but we don't know these
[15:36] conversations that go on that have so
[15:38] much confidence in what God has
[15:40] deposited within us that God would say
[15:43] just let a little something go in their
[15:45] life let the have you considered my my
[15:48] can you have you considered my daughter
[15:50] Rachel have you considered my son John
[15:53] have you considered my son Joel
[16:00] see well that happened thousands of
[16:01] years ago well who told you it can't
[16:04] happen now who died made you interpreter
[16:07] of the
[16:09] word and he said have you considered and
[16:11] so now all this stuff sweeps through and
[16:16] if we don't get a solidness in our soul
[16:19] then we're not going to survive
[16:21] it but when we can survive it God loves
[16:25] to hear us sing in the midst of a trial
[16:29] he just breathes it in God loves to hear
[16:32] us sing in the
[16:35] valleys and so we see then that job was
[16:39] affected in his family I don't want to
[16:40] spend much time that because you know
[16:41] his story but my point is is that if the
[16:44] only part that we're left with is our
[16:46] minds and our spirits and the inlets of
[16:48] our memory imagination conscience
[16:50] affection reasoning if that's what we're
[16:52] left with that the only thing that we
[16:54] have the power through the Holy Ghost to
[16:56] put a guard up to put a protection over
[16:59] then that's what we should do if we're
[17:01] trying to guard all the rest of our life
[17:04] and guard our finances and do all that
[17:06] that's fine but listen my brother and
[17:08] sister and I don't know why I mentioned
[17:10] this a lot but listen do not do not put
[17:13] your trust in some retirement account do
[17:16] not put your trust in something that the
[17:18] devil couldn't touch in your money do
[17:20] not put your trust in that because we're
[17:23] going to hit times that may be taken
[17:24] away from us the only thing through the
[17:27] holy ghost that we want to protect now
[17:29] under this condition is our hearts and
[17:31] our minds we need to have the Holy Ghost
[17:33] protect our minds and protect our
[17:36] spirits and say Satan you can only go so
[17:40] far and if you don't put those
[17:42] Protections in place then you are
[17:44] vulnerable for you to take on a
[17:46] conforming
[17:48] state to things you maybe don't even
[17:51] want to be conformed to how Satan comes
[17:53] in is very subtle it's not out there
[17:56] saying hey dude I want to go to the bar
[17:58] are with you let's
[18:00] go he doesn't do it that way true he
[18:04] does it through a subtle way he gets in
[18:07] we had a problem the last few months
[18:09] with uh with mice getting in my garage
[18:12] and you know it's we we haven't had that
[18:15] 5 years in the house all of a sudden now
[18:17] things changing and now we got some mice
[18:18] popping up in the garage so we had to
[18:20] deal with it for about two or three
[18:21] weeks my son-in-law and and I we you
[18:24] know we're putting the traps out and
[18:25] we're doing all these things and we
[18:26] caught about six of them looks like we
[18:28] taken care of the problem but the
[18:29] question is how do they get in they
[18:31] weren't getting in before how did they
[18:33] get in I mean I didn't put a sign
[18:36] up and say hey guys it's getting
[18:39] cold why you come on the garage you know
[18:43] I didn't welcome that and a lot of times
[18:46] the enemy has things we wouldn't welcome
[18:49] it at
[18:50] all but then you look how did it get in
[18:53] where did it start what music did I
[18:56] listen to where did it start how did it
[18:59] get in my mind what did I read what did
[19:01] I feed on because there's always some
[19:04] other way that the mice can get in we
[19:06] had a house in B bcro solone lives there
[19:08] now for years I dealt with Critters in
[19:10] the ceiling in the attic and they were
[19:13] making noise all the time waking us up
[19:15] nervously I dealt with those things
[19:16] about 5 10 years I paid a lot of money
[19:18] for companies to come out and we could
[19:20] not find where these Critters were
[19:22] getting in and I was checking all along
[19:24] had companies and myself check along the
[19:26] top looking for holes to get in I found
[19:28] a few I sealed those holes we still had
[19:31] Critters every winter they weren't
[19:34] invited you know I it got so bad I
[19:36] wanted to start charging them rent and
[19:39] you can't do that it's like I can make I
[19:41] wish I could make some money off these
[19:43] guys CU they're taking my heat that I'm
[19:45] paying for and they're just making it
[19:47] home up there and usually have their
[19:50] parties when me and Becca were
[19:52] sleeping and so one day here uh the LA
[19:55] one of the last years I lived there one
[19:57] of the guys that had come out finally
[20:00] we're looking and we're looking at a
[20:01] place we would expect it's down below
[20:03] it's underneath the siding and and so
[20:05] there's a big hole there and all those
[20:07] 10 years they're getting in a place that
[20:10] we didn't
[20:11] expect it's always been a lesson to me
[20:14] to realize he'll come in unexpected
[20:17] places the mice the critters will get in
[20:21] in unexpected places there are inlets to
[20:25] our spirit of me memory imagination
[20:28] conscience affection reasoning these are
[20:31] the places that Satan can wreak havoc
[20:33] with in your own personal life because
[20:36] you're letting him invade your thinking
[20:39] and then conform you to something now
[20:41] you know I don't the word conform I just
[20:44] wish that we had more time about that
[20:46] but I just want you to know it's not
[20:48] just Satan's agenda to conform you to
[20:50] the behavior of the world Conformity can
[20:53] happen in many different environments
[20:56] including the church
[21:00] yeah and churches can preach Conformity
[21:05] and reform instead of
[21:07] transformation instead of Change by the
[21:10] Holy Ghost instead of true bringing
[21:12] something to True repentance that their
[21:14] life can be changed they're happy just
[21:17] to see people conformed to a certain
[21:21] Behavior that's even within our ranks if
[21:23] you just dress this way if you'll do it
[21:26] this way and so we must be careful we've
[21:28] got a lot of young people that's growing
[21:30] up and the the emphasis was if you would
[21:32] just conform to this you'll be okay I
[21:35] think that's just as wrong as conforming
[21:36] to the world the Bible says we are
[21:39] transformed we are not conformed even to
[21:42] Christianity we're not conformed to it
[21:44] we're changed into Christianity can I
[21:46] get an amen this morning it's a change
[21:49] it's not being forced to do something
[21:52] you say well parents do that because
[21:54] yeah yeah you you give them Direction
[21:56] you do all that but listen if you're
[21:58] giving your kids something to live by
[22:01] without praying for them to get a
[22:03] relationship with Christ you're doing
[22:05] them a
[22:09] disservice it has to be a balance I'm
[22:12] not wanting to conform to any other
[22:14] man's idea I want to preach this Bible
[22:17] in power and
[22:20] demonstration and make the Bible live to
[22:23] people because people need a God that's
[22:26] living can you say Amen they need a
[22:28] super natural God they don't need a
[22:30] religion can you say Amen we need a real
[22:33] God that we can talk to every day we
[22:35] need a real God it answers back to our
[22:37] prayer we dealt with cancer and other
[22:40] things we need a real God for
[22:42] that and people are
[22:46] transformed transformed by the preaching
[22:50] of the
[22:52] word maybe you're sitting here this
[22:53] morning you said I have felt that being
[22:56] conformed and I res Ed it and I've ran
[22:59] away from it I understand what that
[23:03] feels like I minister to thousands of
[23:06] people who've grown up underneath that
[23:09] and it's a rough road but I just want to
[23:11] encourage you you don't have to be
[23:13] conformed anything because I preaching a
[23:17] God to you if you'll open the door he
[23:20] wants to
[23:21] change what you can't change see you can
[23:24] you think you can change yourself you
[23:26] can't change yourself but this a God
[23:28] that can change you so I've been there I
[23:32] understand being conformed to something
[23:34] you want to run away from it a lot of
[23:36] people are very susceptible to all the
[23:38] criticisms to the message the the people
[23:41] that's most susceptible to it has grown
[23:43] up and it's become a bondage to them and
[23:45] they're looking for escape and that's
[23:47] the endorsement this thing is wrong well
[23:49] you've taken my goodness friend be
[23:51] careful because uh Jesus said Elijah
[23:55] will come and restore all things Jesus
[23:58] said said that so be careful what you're
[24:00] going against in the name of it's all a
[24:03] Conformity to me it's all I understand
[24:06] that but listen now there's a God that
[24:09] loves you there's a God who wants to
[24:12] give you true change Romans 1 verse 18
[24:16] says for the wrath of God is revealed
[24:18] from Heaven against all ungodliness and
[24:20] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[24:21] truth and
[24:23] unrighteousness because that which may
[24:25] be known of God is Manifest in them for
[24:27] God hath showed it unto them them for
[24:29] the invisible things from the creation
[24:31] of the world are clearly seen being
[24:32] understood by the things which are made
[24:34] even his eternal power in Godhead so
[24:36] that they are without excuse because
[24:38] that when they knew God they glorified
[24:40] him not as God neither were thankful but
[24:43] became vain in their imaginations and
[24:45] their foolish heart was darkened Pro
[24:47] professing themselves to be wise they
[24:49] became fools and changed the glory of
[24:51] The Incorruptible God into an image make
[24:54] made like un corruptible man and to
[24:56] birds and to four-footed beasts and
[24:58] creeping things wherefore God also gave
[25:00] them up to uncleanness through lust of
[25:02] their own Hearts to dishonor their own
[25:04] bodies between themselves who changed
[25:06] the truth of God into a lie and worship
[25:08] and serve the creature more than the
[25:10] Creator who is blessed forever amen for
[25:13] this cause God gave them up unto vile
[25:16] affections for even their women did
[25:17] change the natural youth use into that
[25:20] which is against nature
[25:22] lesbianism and likewise Al also the men
[25:25] leaving the natural use of a woman
[25:26] burned in their lust one toward another
[25:29] men with men working that which is unly
[25:31] and receiving in themselves the
[25:32] recompence of their Heir which was meat
[25:35] skip verse 28 I'm coming back to it
[25:37] being filled 29 being filled with all
[25:39] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[25:42] Covetous maliciousness full of eny
[25:44] murder debate deceit malignity
[25:47] Whisperers backbiters haters of God dis
[25:51] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[25:54] evil things disobedient to parents you
[25:57] just just see the whole atmosphere just
[25:59] get very
[26:00] very without understanding Covenant
[26:03] Breakers without natural affection
[26:04] implacable unmerciful who knowing the
[26:07] Judgment of God that these things commit
[26:09] such things are worthy of death not only
[26:11] do the same but have pleasure in them to
[26:12] do you're looking at all that and you're
[26:14] going how in the world that people
[26:16] conform to all of
[26:17] that and I think the answer is back to
[26:20] verse
[26:22] 28 and even as they did not like to
[26:26] retain God in in their knowledge God
[26:29] gave them over to a reprobate mind to do
[26:33] things which are not convenient the
[26:36] pattern and the Conformity came after
[26:40] they made a choice to not retain God in
[26:44] their knowledge be careful for nothing
[26:47] don't be anxious or worried about
[26:49] anything see one of the things when our
[26:51] minds are so bombarded and not guarded
[26:54] one of the attributes is
[26:56] anxiousness some sometimes panic
[26:59] attacks sometimes
[27:02] nervousness because our minds are
[27:04] actually our minds were not built to
[27:07] handle
[27:09] the
[27:11] environment of that we're in in other
[27:13] words the growing uh intellectual side
[27:16] the growing technical side our minds
[27:19] were never meant to handle all of that
[27:22] stuff and science shows that we we don't
[27:25] that's not our minds are supposed to be
[27:27] more simple than that
[27:29] so all this that Mar bars he says 'do
[27:31] not be anxious or worry about anything
[27:34] but he says but in everything by prayer
[27:37] and supplication with Thanksgiving let
[27:40] your request be made known unto God who
[27:44] are we turning to we're going to turn to
[27:47] God every time and if we do he says
[27:50] don't be anxious don't be a worried
[27:52] about anything quickly take it to God
[27:55] the peace of God which passeth all
[27:59] understanding shall
[28:01] guard and keep your
[28:04] hearts and your
[28:06] minds through Christ Jesus thank you for
