we wish it open up to Matthew 14. uh surely it's good to be with you all and uh I I thank the Lord uh we bring greetings from True Word Tabernacle there in Bluffton Ohio we just put our shoulder with you all and we just we just love you so much I'm thankful to have my wife with me as well Carrie and my family my four lovely daughters amen and we're just happy to be with you all amen amen I see my wife's boss back there too God bless you brother Raph I just say that's a little joke I think it's funny yeah no back to all of you really it seems like the galushas are unofficial babysitters for our kids really Don Graham's really good to see you back there too buddy love you buddy spent many time with him and so forth and we just love you all on the Lord spent all day talking about you God bless you Brother Kyle good to see you buddy amen God truly is good amen amen um if you have your Bibles we should read from Matthew 14 and keep your fingers here we're going to go over this a little bit but we're just going to read a couple verses in here we're gonna start we're gonna read verse 28 and 29. uh Matthew 14 and verse 28. the scripture reads and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus I'm going to preach a message this morning called the word said come the word said come power hits word prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy this morning Lord as we gather together as the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord we do look within ourselves and we find insufficiency with our own flesh but Lord when we look into your word and we look at what the promises you've given to us Lord you have made us more than able Lord for this time that you put us in Lord for such as time is this Lord you have given an extra dose of grace to the bride to help us Lord to handle this this moment of time that we're in Lord we all come from different walks of life different struggles different battles but Lord you have ordained this time oh God you said the preaching to the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but to us Lord that believe it is the power of God Lord the power of God to meet each need this morning Lord God I believe Lord that you can meet each need Lord there's not a need too hard for you Lord this morning and I pray in the name of Jesus you will anoint us all Lord to fulfill thy will God Lord I'm praying right now may not a sick person leave this building this morning Lord may not a doubt Lord remain after this service Lord God I pray if a soul doesn't have the Holy Ghost I pray you reach out this morning Lord and you will meet them Lord and show them desperation of how much they need you Lord I believe Lord you'll meet each need this morning God may we all step aside Lord and allow the Holy Ghost to use us this morning God we're asking you now for it and dear and in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride say together amen God bless you may be seated and like I said I'm going to preach a little message called the word said come the word said come and it's really neat how the Bible is written and how the Bible though is written hundred years ago and and there's a lot of stories that sometimes can be hard to maybe understand in one sense and it uses those vows and and all those different Old English words and so forth it's amazing that the Bible is written in such a way that it not just speak to the time it was written but it speaks to all generations and all peoples and I think God set it up like that because he knew we were going to need something amen these stories that you read in the Bible and so forth and happen to individuals they were not there just for you to look at and go oh that's neat what happened to them but it's to encourage you to understand that God can do the same thing for you when you read about what Moses went through what David went through well all these Bible characters went through amen they're not just supposed to stay on the pages amen you don't read the Bible like a newspaper amen the prophet of God taught us that but when we read the Bible we're going Lord if you did it for them you'd do it for me amen oh my and so I want to go over this particular story and I want to and I want what I want to do this morning is parallel it to our day amen oh it's just neat how God set up the Bible like that amen if you kept I told you keep your fingers there right Matthew 14 amen we're going to read about Jesus walking on the water amen and just before this he does a mighty Miracle he feeds 5 000 people with two fishes and and some loaves amen and we get to this point of the scripture here where it says in verse 22 we're going to start in verse 22. and keep you there because I'm going to be going back and forth amen Matthew 14 verse 22 I want to read this because I want to start I want you to start seeing yourself in the scripture amen and I hope I can encourage you this morning and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a Gospel Ship if you will amen that's what we've been sailing on too amen a Gospel Ship amen remember a ship's got a destination you're not here just to sit in the Pew and then go home later we got a destination amen that's why we're all participants two million people sitting on the sideline you got a job to do not just a preacher amen we all got a job to do because we're on this Gospel Ship we got a destination we're going somewhere there's an end to all of this be encouraged the world's not going to keep going on like this I mean how could it at this point amen how could it keep going on you got a destination and straight away Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude his way and when he has sent the multitudes away he went up to a mountain of Park to pray amen maybe to intercede for some people amen when Jesus Christ died on a cross where did he go he went above where they were just like in this store he goes up to a mountain to intercede for them amen that's what Christ did for us amen amen and when the evening was come he was there alone kind of like the evening time if you will verse 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed through waves for the wind was contrary Winds of Doctrine started blowing in opinions started blowing in thoughts and and emotions and people trying to figure things out there's nothing wrong with trying to understand things but when it starts taking the place of Faith you've missed something amen remember this amen we need God more in this day than any other age brother made up said that we have to have more faith today than we've ever had why our bodies have got to change what do we deal in our age well here we go okay what do we deal in our age in the four I know raps going over the church ages each Church age had their own battle during the especially during the four Church age brother Ben taught us as the Dark Ages and during that time you had to seal your testimony with your own blood I tell you what if somebody puts a sword in your neck and says you're going to believe God or not or I've got your head off you don't announce Christ guess what you have far few Hypocrites during that time far few hypocrites but that's not our day that's not the battle we deal with what's the laodicea church age what do we deal with lukewarmness lukewarmness brother bam said thinking you're a Christian when you're not it's your brother Steve you're making me a little scared you shouldn't be Peter said Baker Colony election sure you ought to know whether you're going to make it or not many Christians are wondering where they'll be in the Rapture you ought to know you'll be in the rapture I asked a guy one time at what when I when I was a young kid I asked him I said are you going to heaven or hell he said well I got a 50 50 shot don't I I said boy I'm so glad I don't serve your God only give me a 50 chance no God gave you a promise and you can know today whether you'd be in the Rapture or not and I'm gonna say like this you ought to you you're better it's not just said it's not just good enough to believe you got the token you got to know that you know that you know that you got the token brother Stephen I'm at the Holy Ghost for 29 years then you better make sure 29 and a day then you better make sure 29 in two days you better make sure this ain't worth the message amen [Applause] you're not hurting God's feelings checking hey man this is worth more than life this is worth more than your job uh oh oh I might get in trouble Paul this morning but it's just more important than all the money you got oh my sometimes we do get too comfortable don't we listen I am preaching to you know a bunch of well I'm preaching one African I guess there but I see your brother Mike but yo we are in America brother Stephen why do we always get preached on like this because this is what we deal with getting lazy lukewarm that's why we keep powering the pulpit you and Billy bear said why these people get weak it's because of weak pulpits you ought to thank God you got a pastor you got to thank God you got a five-fold who's willing to tell you [Applause] brother ramstead of pastors ordained of God to lead you into a rapture yeah well that scriptural Ephesians 4 tells us that the five-fold is going to bring us unto the statue of a perfect man oh I don't like those preachers too bad I I mean I don't know what to tell you you better figure something out it's God's ordained way amen you love the Lord oh my it's getting to the evening time ain't it the Bible talks about Zechariah about the evening time that's going to be a time that's either light nor dark but it's a gray time just good enough to be a Christian lukewarmness just hot enough to sit and appeal just and listen all that stuff's great you should pay your ties you should show up here this morning you should be worshiping God that's all great you ought to be doing that but don't let Satan trick you in thinking that's it being on fire means you can light somebody else oh that was so good right there if you're just a little lukewarm match you can't light nothing else if but if you're on fire some other Soul can find out about God [Applause] be on fire so much that even if you're the only lick there you can light the whole place Ablaze you know what the Bible says the Bible says quench not the spirit you know what that word quench means to extinguish a flame I've said this brother Paul I said we got too many firemen in the church sometimes too many firemen be on fire so much that if you're the only one in your church on Sunday morning you can light the whole place Ablaze don't be so scared don't be so scared don't you we'll know if there's a wrong spear in the church we got the Holy Ghost with us don't worry so much well I might be controlled by a contrary Spirit Well no don't worry about that you're a child of God don't act like a serpentine you ain't Serpentine you're a child of God the Bible says in Luke 11 if a son asks for his father for bread would he give him a stone if he asked for an egg would he give him a scorpion if you then being evil know how to give good gifts how much more shall my heavenly father give them the holy ghost that ask of me so don't act is he your dad is he your father then when you ask him for something he's going to give it to you while you're hungry can I can I say something the prophet of God in 65 said he was hungry for more God he was hungry for more God he said I want to see God more in my life and you think what this is William Branham he saw it all and yet he wants more how much more should the bride be crying out and we're gonna find out when you cry out he said come you can have it we always ask God with this thing in the back of their mind thinking what if it don't happen I'm gonna use that in your mind you'll go well what if well you know maybe it's not my time maybe it's this maybe it's that we do so much reasoning worrying so much well brother Paul we're here I'm sorry brother Paul it's supposed to go a little differently but worry so much it's ready Simon his word perfect love cast out all fear you need to when you start feeling that fear creep into your heart you know what it is you know what it is think about it if I've always said it like this we always sometimes pray Lord if I could just have more faith I if I could just muster off more faith I could finally believe God and you sit there and I want to ask you a question if you're a believer of God why wouldn't you believe why wouldn't you I mean did God make everything you made your body didn't you yeah he he made other chairs you're sitting in today he made the light shining on me he made the air can he made it all so if he made all that and he promised you something why would you worry why wouldn't you believe you see what I'm saying we always try to muster up stuff why don't you get in the word and be convinced of God Abraham said he believed God because he was convinced that he was able to do what he said and we're going to find out in this story amen he gave you a promise you you're not alone he's coming to you he's coming to you here let me try to get back to this verse 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed her away for the wind was contrary those false doctrines I know we hear all this stuff all the time we're message people I've been around you message people for a couple years all right yeah you'll hear one little thing and it'll just disrupt somebody hear one little thing always tossed about always tossed about I'm not necessarily blaming you what I'm telling you is there's a source you can go to where you don't have to be so tossed about you hear this one opinion and you think oh maybe that's right maybe maybe I'm the maybe God's leading me this direction maybe God's leading me that direction I've always said like this you want to know God's will for your life you want to know what God's will for your life it's easy you know what you should do go ask him go ask him oh brother rap I'm stealing God of your thunder from the church agent so you forgive me for this already amen but but you know what you know what brother Ram said he said God can talk and you think what does he have to say something like that he actually says it a couple times in a couple sermons you go home and you look in your search engine because I can't remember the exact circuit off top my head right now but he literally says God can talk amen and you know what brother bear said in the church age book he said when when when when Satan was trying to get worship directed to him he did it in stages he didn't do it immediately he did it in stages the first stage was to bring Trinity Doctrine father-son Holy Ghost he said but that wasn't good enough so that he transformed into father mother son and he started transferring into more of that worship of that but then he said Satan was still not content so what he had to do next was to convince the people that God was silent and that he was the silent God matter of fact he said in India they have temples today to the silent God remember in the book of Acts 16 Mars to the unknown God this was a thing so Satan was convincing him that the father oh he's just a silent God he's not really concerned with you and so that's what moved worship to the mother and son now into modern-day Catholicism but the first step he had to convince the people God was and I'm here to bust that up this morning amen God ain't silent God can talk Cayman God still speaks he can talk he can talk behind the pulpit amen he can talk in a song he can talk in a still Small Voice in your heart you remember the story brother bam about Joseph he's never said it was a voice he never said it was a vision it was something spoke to his heart he was going to have a son and his name was Joseph it took two kids after that but it finally came didn't it it can happen like that it can also happen get ready for this you ready for this now it can happen lip to ear I believe God can talk do you God can speak directly to you know what the Bible says the Bible says that you don't even need a man to teach you now I know people have took him that far but we're not taking it too far see you see what happens a lot of times people will quote a scripture and you go oh yeah but what about this over here it's still scripture we still gotta face it of course he's not getting rid of teachers his point is this is that when the word comes forth you have something in you that tells you that's the word so it's not really the man teaching you it's word meaning word brother Stephen I'd so like to read that I'm glad you asked that because it's in first John 2. let's read it together first John 2. let's see if I can find it let's test my brain I feel so at home here brother Paul sometimes I can do stuff like this you know sometimes you get nervous you know did I get the right scripture yeah I did I love you all so much watches here let's just start first John 2 verse 18. watch this here first John 2. and verse 18. the scripture reads little children it is the last time amen as you have heard that the Antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time amen they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifested they were not all of us watch this here but ye see you're different than that group we just read we just read about a group that went out and they would have continued us but ye have an ump from the Holy One and you know some of the things you know half the things you know it all you're a bunch of no-walls know what else with the Holy Ghost you are yeah but see here's his point he gets to you have an unction what does that mean it's more than just something from the outside pouring in an unction means something from within you that's screaming out do you know what that word unction is it's the same hearty words jump down to verse 27. but the unction go look it up for yourself that word unction is the same word for anointing but the anointing which you have received from abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you all things you see the anointing is teaching you so when I speak the word there's an anointing in you that comes back and says yup that's the word and that is what's going to save your soul that right there what I just did we think it's so small sometimes in this church but do you understand that's what's going to Rapture you when the same word cries and says it's time to come up higher that anointing Union's gonna say it's time to go up higher [Applause] that's why we come to church that's why we get under the anointing we're getting ready come up and get ready Jesus is coming soon you see why that's so important to understand about yourself when you got saved it wasn't it wasn't just that night you went to the altar you were in the mind of God before the foundations of the world and because God knew you were going to receive it he placed that something in you so that when the word would come it bring it to life when it rains on the crops only the light comes brother Brandy even taught us that the reason why the rain comes is because it's to bring life out but if it rains on a bunch of just dirt it doesn't do anything no life comes out of that but if there's a seed there now it comes to Quicken everything but God's only coming back for a certain time to life you say brother Stephen how do I know if I'm that light how do I know if I'm that predestinated amen it's all based on faith listen we don't have the book I don't have the black book to tell me yep you're a bride foolish nothing bride foolish version nothing I don't have the book guess what neither do you so quite acting like you got the book sometimes okay that was just free right there we won't go too far into that but okay but if I haven't just don't act like you got the book either but how do you say but brother Stephen how do I know I'm the bride look at what you're doing right now you're sitting here in a message church hearing the word of God you want the word of God in your life nobody told you to do that you could easily go down to church I drove ads a bunch of churches on the way here you could easily go there but yes something tells you they come here what is that that's that's something that's going to change your life it will change your body amen [Applause] let's never let's never never devalue the Holy Ghost don't ever forget that I'm gonna try to get to that here in a second I got some more points I did want to make but let's see what happens but with a ship in verse 24 there but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth seal I mean Fourth Watch sorry uh did I interject that a little bit but on the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them now remember this is Jesus went down to them walking on the water now you don't see this every day do you brother Gideon somebody walking on the water that's pretty Supernatural you know what brother bam said actually brother I know I can send you those quotes is that first quote I mean you know I'm just got brother bam say for you it's in Jehovah Jireh number two if you can bring that up for everybody I think I sent it to you brother being said in Jehovah Jireh number two I wanted you to see brother bam say it yeah God always how much always is Supernatural Works in Supernatural as long as there is a God there there is Supernatural if it's Jehovah God now I want you to understand this sermon tends to turn into a more of a unders more understanding of the supernatural I've preached this a couple times but we're bringing it here this morning amen is that the supernatural we we always try to figure it Supernatural out you can't figure out Supernatural with natural things I can't take Supernatural and stick it between two glasses and put it under a microscope and Jesus there's the supernatural there's no there's no grabbing it there's no molding it there but it's still real it's still evident you think about this all healing is Supernatural brother bam taught us that a doctor can send a bone but he can't actually heal it you say but brother Stephen I took a pill that pill had been made from something it's made from some sort of chemical well who decided that chemical is what actually makes your head feel better I don't know if you hate headaches but I hate headaches too and I look and it's when I get a really bad headache I take some ibuprofen well who decided ibuprofen was what was going to make my head feel better well the doctor set it up yeah but the doctor didn't decide that that certain chemical would make me feel better God decided that so see God is still the Healer now you want to let's get all this science stuff out of our brain for a second let me give you a there's a really neat parable about this one time a scientist went up to God and the scientists said God we can do anything you can do oh really God said yeah we can even make a person and God said okay go ahead so the scientists went down he went and grabbed some dirt and God said uh get your own dirt [Laughter] when they come up with all these scientific theories who decided it would work like that anyways the dirt still came from God the Stars still come from God all this stuff still comes from God the whole world's made of Supernatural it's not a strange thing the supernatural in one sense okay you know they even proven that healing's Supernatural I know there's some doctors and nurses in here and stuff there's a medical term called a placebo you know what that is it's a placebo is a thing where they'll hand you something and the doctor says yup this if you take this you will feel better it can be nothing but a sweet tart you know they take the sweet tart but because they believe that sweet tart was medicine they'll start to feel better it's called a placebo there was nothing in it so what actually is the healing now was it the pill see it's supernatural it's Faith it's the supernatural you see and I think as Christians sometimes and I'm just getting it right to America now remember I'm not preaching to Germans I'm not preaching to Africa I'm preaching to us here in America it's easiest for for us for to forget the necessity of Supernatural in your life and I'm not necessarily throwing you the bus I'm the first to throw myself under the bus amen we always do those things right we always try to figure things out we got a bunch of science we got a bunch of websites they could tell us all these things and yet we sometimes forget the necessity of Supernatural of when God comes on the scene he can and I'm not even talking about supernatural people always can play Supernatural jumping up and down jumping up and down anybody can jump up and down I'm talking about when God comes and changes you now when God comes and does his Supernatural there might be some jumping up and down I get excited when he's on the scene doing something right Boaz I get excited when he does something some people sit there and cry something who cares about all that stuff let's just see God working Our Lives everybody fussing about everything and yet we got dead people who can be raised again we got people with cancer that can be healed [Applause] tired this social trying to figure out every little thing and things like that let's have God come on the scene and allow the supernatural to do something don't be so scared of Supernatural people always get what do you mean Brothers you my Supernatural it shouldn't be like that we're Christians we're the bride amen the Holy Ghost is Supernatural brother if you got that quote it's here ye him it's that third quote 62. and I believe that God and every age sending forth a messenger always first meet the people on sacred ground because it's got to be sold there's too much of evil to try to explain all the supernatural away and where there's a supernatural God there's going to be Supernatural seeds can I say something here I'm gonna I'm gonna break this quote down for you a little bit okay things you know what a thing is it's something you can hold this is a thing you want to mean emotion isn't necessarily a thing he's talking about when God's on the seed Supernatural things happen I'm tired of people just thinking if you scream Supernatural happen I'm not saying you ain't going to stream but I want to see things happen they even after the screaming they're living a different life there's something happen to them they're praying all of a sudden now they're seeking God more something changed in them I want to see Supernatural things have been amen somebody who walked in you with cancer and leaves healed things happen amen oh I feel so good I can speak in tongues Hallelujah that's what I want to see happen sometimes we just stop and don't go on that's what can hinder you too amen let's go on let's actually have those things in our hands she said brother Stephen am I allowed to huh boy I'm so glad you asked let's keep reading this story in Matthew 14. in verse 25. you love the Lord God surely is good to us ain't he who man I don't know that was all about I gotta Catch My Breath a little bit praise the Lord we need more of this in our life do you do you understand where blood Stephen's heart's coming from sometimes it feels like Supernatural is the last thing we think about something you know medical happen you try to figure out medical reason not saying any of that stuff's bad I love doctors just much the next person there's nothing wrong with that but Supernatural Faith ought to be the first thing do you see what I'm saying we should start leaning on God do you know what it means when you're leaning on something when you're truly leaning on something you know what that means that means if that thing would fail you would fall down some people are too busy standing straight up what if what if what if you know brother Bam's talked about that one story I think he was over in Africa you forgive me if I get the details wrong but he met a person who was supposedly converted to Christianity but they still had that Idol I think it was Macaulay or something I can't remember the exact terms to use like I said why are you still carrying that idle around if you're a believer of Jesus he said well just in case Jesus fails I got this now see we we condemned that we go look at that that'd be terrible but some of us do that with our phones someone's do that with internet websites see when you're truly leaning on something if it would fail you would fall that's how much you need to lean on the supernatural leaning on faith leaning on God if you're not sold get sold listen we got testimonies Galore to tell us that God is faithful that God never fails we are surrounded by so great cloud of witnesses let us put aside every sin and wait not just sin but every weight that would take us away from the gospel of Christ it's not just sins that get in the way it could just be a a burden a way that you've been trying to carry yourself what did he say he said come unto me oh ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest rest you know important rest is in your life rest is so important you know how important rest is God even told us to have the ground rest remember the law you had to plant the ground for six days but on the seventh day you'll let the Earth rest ain't that something God even tells you give the earth a rest it needs it do you know how important rest is rest is so important even God did it God has Infinite Strength don't he what do you mean he gets tired he needed a rest the Bible says he rested on the seventh day from all of his works and yeah we sit there just try to figure every little thing out you need to start resting in the promises of God when you're right when you're leaning on something which you fall if it fail you sold out and now we're taking a step further now because I feel that pull a little bit I'm not just talking about Divine Healing anymore I'm talking about Christianity there was a story brother man talked about um there was an Army I forget I don't know if it was the Vikings I can't remember who the exact Army were but they were known to be so ruthless that they would take their boats when they would go try to take out a village or something they would take their boats hit the shores to get off the boats and burn the boats behind them why they're not getting off of there until they win every battle there was no Escape for them I think some Christians have that Escape Route in their mind if this don't work I have something to fall back on amen and see and this goes to a lot of things in Christianity and then you wonder why don't I see God the way I should see God the way I read about God have you really sold out and listen I can't answer that question Paul can't even answer that question but I know somebody who can Paul or I'm sorry God can answer that question and listen I know people always sometimes people wear you out with their issues and times and you have to sit there and wonder are you really sold are you really sold out to this gospel maybe I'm getting like this a little bit because listen Church you say brother Stephen do you think the raps are going to happen tomorrow it could of course it could happen 10 minutes from now but guess what you're not even guaranteed to make it there the Bible says it's appointed unto men wants to die then judgment yeah I had somebody asked me one time said how do you think the end of times is going to happen I said who cares once your end times going to happen doesn't matter how the end times is going to work it doesn't matter about you know a mark of the beast and all this stuff you're in the times might happen tomorrow and guess what you just met the end of times and guess what we're going to see whether you have it or not hey man Quit Playing Games With God he said brother Stephen how do I Quit Playing Games With God get in the Supernatural find out get sold out to Jesus Christ give your all to it it's worth your all God doesn't ask you to have a bunch of money guys I ask you a bunch of skill he's just asking for you give yourself to it and then you'll see God start moving in your life you'll start seeing Bible days happen before your eyes amen it won't just be a story anymore to you would be reality to you we need more Supernatural in our life even to you old Christians some of you've been serving God 30 40 50 years we still need Supernatural you're not going to make it without Supernatural you're not even saved without Supernatural do you know that you can't even be saved without it amen you're not saved by thoughts you didn't sit there one day and just think yourself into salvation no it was the power of God that saved your soul when he died on the cross for you amen see you see what I'm saying so if that's how much we need is Supernatural to get saved you're going to need it every day of your life here I'm going to read this to you here because I'm going to show you the disciples going through this a little bit our own personal struggles with salvation or with uh Supernatural verse 25 and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea Jesus is always going to come you cry out to him he's going to be there even when sometimes you don't cry out he's gonna be there did he say Amen I know there's times I've done some pretty bone-headed things and he still shows up even when I wasn't even worthy of it he still shows up God doesn't fail God don't fail his word I can testify I'll give you my own testimony I've done some pretty stupid things now you can't tell from this good looking guy up here but just don't talk to my wife later okay but I've done some pretty dumb things I've done some things that I'm ashamed of be both before I was a Christian even after I was a Christian I've done some things that I am ashamed of every time I've ever asked God to show up no matter what condition I was in he'd show up every time he's never we failed God sure he never fails brother Bram said that one time he said God can't do one thing he can't fail he promised it to you he's going to take care of you he promised it to you he's always there with you don't ever doubt that don't ever listen to this world you know what I mean don't ever listen to psychology you know sometimes you got to stop thinking so much about it brother bam wrapped up the seals in a sermon title called God hidden in simplicity don't complicate it so much the supernatural ain't that hard it really ain't people always think it's complicated and how did Moses split the Red Sea you know all these powerful things that we see happen in the Bible you know what the Bible says about Elijah Elijah shut the heavens for three and a half years no rain not three and a half months three and a half years that's a long time and yet the Bible says Elijah is a man of such like Passions he dealt with the same things you deal with he was a man I no doubt he probably dealt with lust just like any other man would dealt with Envy Strife get angry they all deal with issues Elijah spirit in one sense was a loner you know he was a moody kind of guy you researched the Bible you find out that Elijah's Spirit they're very moody up and down up and down Elijah shut the heavens he had a letter from Jezebel scare him he's run into a cave saying I'm the only one left Lord John the Baptist one time says behold the Messiah behold the Christ he ends up in a jail he goes back says hey are you really the guy are you really there see Moody see you see but so they were subject to those kind of passions just like you are and yet they shut the heavens for three and a half years do you think I'm gonna do that brother Stephen I really don't know to be honest with you but it doesn't have to be that what I'm trying to tell you is that same stupid I'm not talking about the supernatural acts I'm talking about there's a supernatural God that's with you that whatever God is Supernatural things happen amen you see what I'm saying I think sometimes we bring too much denominational thinking in our mind acting too much like a Baptist a Methodist we're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen God's your brother may have said and I don't got the exactly I can get a lady for you if you want but brother bam said this he said if it was flesh if the supernatural was flesh during Jesus's day in his flesh it will be Supernatural In the Flesh of the Bride you know what Jesus said I'm sorry brother man said brother man said the bride will have the same ministry as Jesus Christ the same God in you it's not a different God you say well I have a less of a god well maybe you do but brother man Thomas you just take a little spoon in the ocean take it up it's the same stuff I tell what just a little guy can do a lot let's just get that little God working then maybe we can start seeing the big guy working I don't know you see what I'm saying we get so frustrated in our mind about bills and work and things like that you know we got people who are sick people got cancer and things like that you see what I'm saying sometimes we take our problems and Elevate us so much we if we had the supernatural Mar in our life you would just see how small those problems you have are if you just enter into his presence more I don't know if you know her sister Wendy Chan great sister and Lord she gave me a magnet one time it has a little cat on it everything a little cute fridge maggot and it says you're telling uh God how big your problems are why don't you tell your problems how big God is you see why you need more Supernatural in your life your problems look too big this morning you've allowed problems in these issues to grow and to this thing that they're actually not compared to God but you will start comparing them to yourself and you're going I don't know how I'm going to do this of course you ain't gonna do it if man could save his own soul why would he need God if you could solve every single problem of course you wouldn't need God of course you need these problems this so of course when you look at it through yourself of course you fail it actually shouldn't really surprise you but you need to start comparing them to God's promises you need to start looking out on the water and though you're on this Gospel Ship waving tossing to and fro Jesus is still walking on the water the Supernatural is still there to handle any problem amen I'm gonna keep reading this and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they received him with joy is that what it says with the audition it was Jesus I thought wait Jesus is walking to them they were tossed on the sea and it was God coming to them they were troubled they were scared I wonder what happened sometimes in church then when you feel that unction in your heart and you don't have me or Paul to have to teach you what that is you know what that is that is when you feel that emotion in your heart you feel that Supernatural coming when you feel that Faith rise up in your heart I think I preached this here a long time ago pulsation of faith when you start feeling that pounding and it's time to believe what is that that's Jesus Christ walking on the water Jesus is coming to you what happens to a lot of us when Jesus was walking to him they get troubled saying it's a spirit and they cry out in fear oh devil speak in tongues too I know the fears we get well let's talk about our day a little bit oh I might look better than the other oh somebody might think I'm too spiritual in the church I know that one happens I've heard it oh I don't want to look too spiritual compared to other people oh I don't want to be too prideful what do you mean too prideful see you see what happens if Satan can't get you actual proud he make you think you are always this that and other and nothing gets done he printed this bunch of that you know what sometimes maybe you did get a little proud but at least somebody got healed of cancer Maybe you might get a little uppity up but somebody got saved still we worry too much about things you know what I mean worrying too much they cried out in fear scared of the Supernatural coming to him it's Jesus coming you made serpents he quit acting like it I might mess it up of course you're gonna mess it up you're human there's that saying right to air is human we all do it so quit acting like you ain't gonna do of course you're going to do it God that's why God gave you Grace that's why God gave you Grace you know I had this quote right here I read it in a broken cisterns and I was listening back there before the service and I thought I think I'm going to say this quote this morning brother bam said now speaking of Grace just for a moment what the grace of God is we got laws and bylaws and if you don't measure up to this standard I got a religious measuring stick if you don't measure just up to that you've got you can't come in he said and so forth but God Saves Us by grace not by a measuring stick you know what you ought to do this morning take your religious measuring stick bam time to break it and enter into the supernatural of God [Applause] quit trying to work it up you know what I mean you're saved by grace amen you don't got a bear in your body the marks of Jesus you don't got to beat yourself up to finally believe God I don't care what you've done Grace can overshadow it Grace not only overshadowed it I should even say grace obliterates it the blood of Jesus Christ think about this the blood of Jesus Christ if it wasn't so perfect if it wasn't perfect that means you could say I said it wrong if you could sin so much of the blood of Jesus Christ couldn't take care of it then that means the blood wasn't perfect it would have been a perfect sacrifice because a perfect sacrifice had to pay the price for All sin the Bible even tells us it did not just forgive your sins it forgave the sins of the whole world so if you could somehow sin so much that the grace couldn't reach you he wasn't perfect then and we know that ain't true you haven't sinned away your day of Grace amen you still love Jesus you know brother Brown said that that's actually a quote you haven't sinned away your day of Grace do you still love Jesus if you if you still love Jesus you couldn't love that unless Grace was there for you amen you're not saved by a measuring stick you you don't have to um you don't have to earn this kind of Supernatural I'm talking about if you would just reach out in faith I wouldn't even wait till I was done I tried to do it right now if I was you to be honest with you especially if you got the Holy Ghost don't wait on me if you ain't got the Holy Ghost I'd figure something out right now if you really want the supernatural working in your life you need to lift your hands and say God I receive it God I'll take it God I'm calling to you I want it so bad Lord I Want My Life changed more I know I can live better for God I don't know about you maybe you're all angels in here but I know I could use more God in my life I did jump a little ahead but let's repeat her saying this I did jump ahead watch this verse 26 again and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Hallelujah aren't you glad God doesn't leave you in that situation for so long they were scared for a little bit maybe just a little bit but straightway Jesus Hallelujah speak unto them saying be of a good cheer it is I I Be not Afraid oh can you say Amen you don't got to be afraid he's gonna take care of it remember what I said if you're leaning on something if it would fail if you'd fall right but Jesus Never Gonna fail you Jesus is never you're never going to fall you may feel like your fault but he's always going to be there ready to catch you oh aren't you glad for that friends I hope you can I hope you can feel the sermon's heart this morning I hope you can feel God's heart in this sometimes we condemn ourselves so much we can't experience God we think we can't experience God as much because we failed him so much these people were scared of Jesus Jesus is trying to come help and they were going ah in straight away Jesus cried out to them still he never gives up on us Hallelujah remember when Adam sinned Adam never looked for God but God was looking for Adam he's still walking in that Garden looking for you and I'm not just talking those who need saving though he's doing that too maybe you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost maybe you've had those experiences with God but you've been too busy getting worn by a painted fire oh I had a great testimony two months ago get one today then amen quit being warned up by your past experiences get a fresh anointing of the Holy Ghost today that I've got to be a bunch of jumping I don't care what it looks like just get it amen spending's too much time well what if I do this what if I do that who cares what you're gonna do let the experience come in it's going to change you can't be lighted by a pane of fire you want to be on fire for God get God there then amen aren't you glad God's like this to us uh I think brother Wayne at our church said it one time pretty beautiful he says not just the god of the Second Chances oh no this is Samuel Browning Thursday it wasn't he's not just a god of the Second Chances he's a god of the Third then the fourth then the fifth and then as many chances as it takes for us to finally get into our head amen that God loves you and he's going to take care of you just start leaning on him this morning and your life will be so much better for it I know that young people listen to brother Stephen right now for a second you don't want what this world has to offer I was that young person I know what the world is I have been to my shame brother Paul I hope this is okay brother Paul I'm gonna be a little candid with you this morning amen I know what it means to be buzzed I know what it means to be high I know I know he's to be drunk and not if it compares to what God did in my soul amen I've had the cigarettes I've had the drugs I've had the alcohol not only do I know God can deliver it from you but young people hear me do not be jealous of my testimony you don't want what I've experienced I hope I scare you straight this morning you don't want my testimony I'm jealous of your testimony people look at me sometimes but it's even God deliver you for so much yeah and I wish I'd never done it you know why I get around somebody who's smoking it doesn't bother me I condemn myself I breathe it in just fine it doesn't bother me why my body is used to it and I wish it didn't I wish I but I don't and I can't stand it about myself I remember every single thing I've ever I remember what those feelings are they come back to you ever so often that's why you don't want what I have you don't have to go out in the world to find Christ he's right here right now amen [Applause] I know that's a struggle for some of our message kids sometimes I know it is good brother Stephen I don't have that great testimony you have it's not that great I'm being real with you it may sound great right here it ain't that great you're to I wish I had your chance I did it and God knows what he's doing I'm not I'm not denouncing what God has to do sometimes God had to do in my life specifically for me and that's great and God is good don't ever try to impersonate a testimony like this it ain't worth it I don't know if you'll come back okay we understand brother Stephen you don't want my kind of testimony don't even Envy it just be thankful God Did It For Me amen and then get your own experience with God amen don't be so scared of that Supernatural don't be scared of God coming into your heart God changing you God doing something again for you amen watch us here verse 27. and stay away Jesus spake unto them saying be of a good cheer it is I be not afraid aren't you glad he said that when Christ is here this morning you don't have to be afraid of it now watch what Peter says I love this and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto the water what a great what a great way to find out what does he say Lord if that is you I just heard you say it Jesus but Lord if that's you let me do the same thing you're doing if it is you Lord let me come on Lord if you said you can be healed by your stripes you're here Lord if that is you bend me to come cry out to me Lord tell me to come in and what do you say in the next verse going to go to the next 29. and he said come you don't have to wonder what it means to have a supernatural God in your life if this Supernatural is written I challenge you all this morning so maybe some are teetering I don't know where you're at God does but if you feel that teetering spirit is this really God oh let's take it a step further we're in the message Church aren't we is the message really right you know I've been hearing this stuff about the prophet and you know this that or another and there's so many of these opinions and stuff like that I've been accused of being a brand of my I wear like I wear like a badge though to be honest with you but that's all right because I know where I stand I know where I stand amen I don't think brother Brandon was God just as much as I don't think you or as the single person God Amen but I do believe brother Ram is the prophet to this age hey man we needed something like this to happen all right somebody asked me that one time why do you say brother Bradham said I said because I'm not Malachi 4. he's Malachi 4. God prophesied of his God anointed another Prophet to prophesy about this prophet he must be pretty important then amen it ain't remember when we're following this message we're not just following it because he did more fancy stuff than the guy down the road it's not just the supernatural this message is scripture being fulfilled in our day Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10. it's scripture happening before our eyes that's why I follow it that's why I lead and sell my soul out to it if this message failed I failed sold out Lock Stock and Barrel that's why I've been called a brand of mine that's all right it doesn't affect me too much but you need to know where you stand are you sold out to this or not see we always get these opinions going back and forth is this really right or not you you know how I found out this mess is right you're gonna be shocked by this I know you are all right when I first came and I was praying about this message you know what I did I talked to God about it uh oh I asked God is this it is this it and all of a sudden God started showing me things in my life I didn't even see before but I found out I was surrounded by the message the whole time I hope you don't mind this I'm gonna give a little testimony I know we got to be a little careful about time you warned me already and I just tease it I'm just teasing let me just give you a little testimony I'm gonna try to bring this down a little bit well when I when I like I said when I first found out about this message and so forth I was praying Lord is this right Lord is this right I'm trying to catch it then all of a sudden one day I'm walking up into my grandpa's house and I looked and I stepped on the step I've been in my grandpa's house since I was a little boy stepping over that same step he painted his four green I don't know why he painted a green but the garage floor was green and but it was a little concrete step go up and I went up and I looked on the corner this is the first time I've ever seen this I've never even seen it like I said I think I was 23 years old now look and I saw a little V on the corner of a of a of the mat and I went what's that little V somebody carved something into the concrete I took it off and I found out later my uncle when he was a boy painted the Pyramid of the Seven Virtues into that concrete step with the Capstone and everything there and I went I never noticed that until now when I asked God is this message right and I stepped right onto it walked in the house I looked to my left I noticed my grandpa had the picture of the pillar fire right there and I went seen that picture of my whole life never knew what that meant until right this moment look to my right he had a picture of the seven angel cloud I was surrounded by the message the whole time didn't even know it and I got a whole long story about that but I'm talking about me for the second is as soon as I started asking God for it as a matter of fact there was a picture that my grandpa had that I was always intrigued by I remember as a kid I would look at it go that's just something it's a picture of brother Brian I'm preaching with the Flames coming on him and I remember when I was a little boy I'd look at that picture and I go that's just something what's going on there nobody told me until I was 23 years old and I asked God is this message right and I looked at that picture and I said yup there's something about that man and that anointing and that war that came forth that is sent to us to prepare us for our rapture don't be scared this message don't be scared of that brain of Might and what they like to say about it people will come around you accuse you to be a man father don't even listen to it you know where you stand I'm not following a man I'm following the word made flesh in my day I'm following scripture that happened let the world go by God he was mindful of you to send you that word don't want to be ashamed of this message don't ever be scared of it it's Jesus walking on the water still hey amen when God sent us a message he said it's the most Supernatural brother Brandon even told us he did more miracles in his ministry than he did in his own Ministry remember that the supernatural followed us it's a part of us it's a part of Who We Are if it is him Lord bend me to come Lord if this message is real bin me to come and I'm here to declare to you the word said come you don't have to guess anymore whether this message right you don't have to guess anymore whether you're going to make it into a Rapture can I just stress on that just for a little bit here amen you need to find out whether you're going to be in the Rapture or not you need to know that you know that you know me and brother Alex I think you've had him here before Alex a good buddy of mine we always joke around sometimes if he can't I'll call him and if he can't oh no he's called me one time he couldn't reach me and so he told my wife he said well I know he didn't go no rapture he said because if he was going to a Rapture I'd be gone too that's the kind of attitude we need amen you know the Bible says the Bible says in um oh I believe it's in Matthew talks about when Jesus was accused of eating the show bread in the temple and the the the the Pharisees said your disciples do that which is unlawful he said have you not read when David also ate of the show bread and so forth he said for the Lord or for for the son of man is Lord even on the Sabbath day and the point he's making is this is that sometimes we get too religious in our mind about things and he was saying it wasn't like when God was there before the foundation of the world there was this great thing called the Sabbath day and he looked at the Sabbath day and he went oh there's a Sabbath day you know what I'll do I'll make man to worship this sabbath day that's not what happened no God first made man he made man and his own image and then he noticed he needed them to have a rest so then he said you know what I'm going to make a rest for them called the Sabbath that's the point of the Sabbath the Sabbath it wasn't that man was made for the Sabbath it was that the Sabbath was made for man now let's look at the rapture it's not that you are the you are made for the Rapture it's that the Rapture was made for you God knew you were going to be here in this end time and do you know God can even judge this world while you're here he can't do it why because the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit of God is in you but the BAM taught us that the Church of God is the blood of God by the spirit so while you're here there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat oh Hallelujah do you see why we can still reach out to souls out there I think I told Paul this this weekend I've been lately I've been getting such a heart for missionary work lately I think I think oh man brother Paul I get really at home here don't I think we're getting a little too close-minded in the message I'm gonna be real with you this is my heart okay I think we're forgetting about other people we're remembering each other and that's good don't get me wrong we should be worried about each other of course you should you should be praying for your brothers and sisters praying for sickness and so forth do you know how many people are out there and have you even had a chance to hear what you heard you know how many people that were his who haven't even heard the even a hint of the things you've heard what if they did what if they did hear something that you've heard what would it do to them oh Stephen I've been rejected so many times so so have I but sometimes it just takes one I'm going to give you one more test you know what I'm gonna give you one more testimony I'm gonna shut her down I'm gonna because I want to tell you my testimony oh I see I see you back there Kyle but Laura stayed home huh yeah a little baby oh is she back there good okay good I just don't see her good one of those Delaney's better show up Ashley bailed on me so Josiah went on his month trip to Vain you make sure you get him a little hard time for me okay missing my service give him a not a huge amount but a little bit okay anyways you know sometimes you don't know what it's going to take to save somebody you don't even know here let me just give you my testimony about the delaneys one time I started working I started word working on third shift and uh that first night I worked there I was on fire for God and I lit that whole place on fire now that I'm thinking about it I sure did because I worked with the lady named Jessica she trained me on the job for eight hours and I gave her eight hours worth of God just drowned her in it you may see you think that was why Stephen I actually in one sense no I don't think it was wise but I believe God was in it still see sometimes we get so much thinking was that really the best way could I have done better maybe you could but God knows how to work things anyways amen because what happened was I talked to her so much about God that also I'm walking out the door the end of this is the very first night I'm there and the guy later I found out his name's Eddie he approaches me say hey uh I'm Eddie nice to meet you I said hi I'm Stephen he's like are you a Christian I said well now that you ask me yes I am a Christian he said well I already knew that how do you already know that apparently there was a forklift driver driving by and he overheard me talking about God to Jessica and he said and that forklift driver and me get together every night he works third shift and I work first so we get together and pray with each other as we go our separate ways would you like to pray with us amen I love to pray with you that'd be great we also do a man's bible study on Tuesday nights would you like to come amen I'll come so sure enough and that other forklift driver overheard me ended up being Steve Delaney so we started doing Bible studies on every Tuesday nights every Tuesday nights we started doing Bible studies and one night and it was there was a guy there's old Mennonite there named Pete and uh Pete Pete didn't really like me too well and that's because we start talking about something that I would just take it and just go a million miles away from what they were talking about right and I ended up actually kind of inadvertently taking over the Bible study a little bit one night we started talking about End Time stuff you know what God's going to do in the Book of Revelations and so forth and I and we're getting towards the end and I said you know before God can do any of this that we're talking about tonight he said he promised there was a last sign to the Gentiles and it was getting closer and I said you know if you guys don't mind maybe next Tuesday I can come and I can share with you what this last sign is they said yeah brother Stephen come in you know that that takes wisdom God gave me a rapport with them God gave me a testimony with them so they're like yeah bring it Stephen we'd love to hear what you have to say so sure enough that next Tuesday I bring and I taught brother Brandon right out of this remember something what we're following is a hundred percent scriptural we're not we're not man follower I know people like to call you a man father you ain't actually a man follower well you're a man Christ Jesus follower I'll say that amen but this I took brother Branham and I preached him right out of here I didn't need a single quote to do it and I did that on purpose just for them but I'm just letting you know that this message is a hundred percent scripture so I showed him in the scripture what I did was I made a gap in the scripture of the Gentile Church ages and then the end times with when God starts dealing with Israel I said but there's something here and I took brother Manor's Ministry and went bump there it is that night I gave them all Church age books and I gave them all the uh um pictures of the prophet and so forth like that and I told him I said and I believe by God's grace this man fits the bill that it's not just the man either but his ministry is what fits right in here for the last sign of the Gentiles so I did that that night at night I go to the feeder line of the hymen line Myers Road and Sauders Archbold Ohio I'm sorry I'm working all of a sudden ly drives to this forklift gets off of it and he starts pounding me with questions he just starts talking to me all night so Stephen what are you talking about this guy's a prophet how to come nobody knows about him kept talking me over and over and over again I went to his house one time and we started talking about godhead the Lord can tell you the story a little bit better because what happened was apparently they tried to do a little joke on me while I was talking about the godhead trying to do a Bible study with him apparently he gave me a bunch of nuts or Wasabi nuts and they're supposed to be like super hot they said I took those nuts just pounded them and just kept on preaching did a phase me elect they're like what's going on so about about two months later Steve Delaney ends up getting baptized in the name of the Lord him and his wife and then sure enough through that now remember this this all started because I was talking to somebody else didn't even meet Steve Delaney Steve the lady met me first oh that was good I never actually I've said this testimony a hundred times never said it like that before I was talking to somebody else and God made sure Delaine Steve Delaney was right there sure enough what happens is one daughter amen Ashley turns into the skirt girl at school she starts understanding this message she got the Holy Ghost and I believe it was 2012 she told me a Tim mechanic Church gets the Holy Ghost amen Allure gets the Holy Ghost Aubry gets the Holy Ghost banned still working on him a little bit but he's coming in none the same their whole family gets saved and I'm saying this you're saying oh that's beautiful Stephen I'm so glad to hear God doing that I'm not telling you this testimony to tell you how pretty it is what I'm trying to tell you is that God could use you just the same God can use you just the same just speak to a soul who knows maybe somebody's overhearing you I think we've like I said I think in the message we're starting to get too much of a bubble where we are starting to forget about the people outside of us and we need to start being concerned about that and I'm not even missionary work is great I'm glad we're doing it actually I'm glad we're starting to send pretty well what I'm saying is what about that co-worker next to you what about that neighbor oh well brother Stephen I don't want to scare them we can scare them to Hell number two you see what I'm saying is it really gonna be that bad you're already the skirt girl sister you know what I mean you're already the skirt girl brother Paul I hope this is okay this morning I'm getting a little friendly this morning but I I hope you can feel my heart is that I've noticed this about myself lately too worried about so much message issues and I'm I'm being real candid this morning I am being and not and and I'm not saying these problems aren't worth looking at sometimes but I think they're getting too big and we're forgetting the bigger picture which is what Souls being saved for God Hallelujah we sometimes forget those Souls out there and who knows if they would hear the same word you heard what would they do you don't know what they're going to do they might reject you yeah they might reject you they may say there's nothing to this yeah maybe they would but what if they do come what's that Worth to us oh Hallelujah that just struck my soul a little bit I might have to do some repentance this morning myself to be honest with you what is that word I I you know what you forget I'm doing a little reflection of myself you know when I first got saved I did a lot of Street witnessing I'm not saying everybody has to do it but I did and I went door to door I did a lot I docked on almost every single door in northwest Ohio Defiance Napoleon Liberty Center Delta Wauseon I went through all those towns you know how my soul's got saved from that zero but it grew me to a point where I could talk to somebody else and God could bring a Delaney around to me and I think about that for a second and I go was it worth it was it worth all that time I walked I mean I walked I one time I I used to do with a buddy Simon Smith that he goes to camp Smith's church in Napoleon me and Simon we we hit the streets all the time one time we got so tired I was late to work I worked third shift right and I fell asleep on his couch my wife woke me up too late and we were late to work I said glory to God I was late to work serving God I'm not suggesting duh we like to work all of a sudden but now that I'm looking about it I'm actually confessing my heart before you right now was it worth it was it worth all that effort I did you know what I say absolutely and 100 I do it again and if I got rejected another thousand times would it still be worth it do you understand what brother Stephen's saying this morning let's not be worried so much about our inner working sometimes you know I heard a preacher say this one time I'm close with this statement right here said are you getting sick you're getting sick in Christianity get on a missionary diet start sharing your faith you know what I mean when you go to I'll give you a little tidbits here when you go to the cash register and she's ringing you up why don't you say that God bless you want to thank you so much for your help God bless you bring it up bring who knows who's listening and who knows they might end up in this church and get saved because of what you were willing to sacrifice how many missed opportunities do you have I know I have plenty you understand what both Steven's saying that's why I appreciate Paul so much as well we had this conversation similar to this I think I think we need to we need to start being more worried about those Souls that need it you know what I mean let's bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord as I pray right now with this congregation Lord I do feel like there was a shift in the spirit God and I feel that shift right now even with me Lord God I pray Lord that we start looking within ourselves and start crying out as it says in the Book of Ezekiel start crying out for the Abominations done in the city Lord a church is not just called to to their four walls they're called to a location lower these families wherever they may live they're not just put there randomly but you have placed them there for a reason Lord maybe there's a soul next to them that needs to hear this glory is Gospel I pray these these men who may feel like they're not the greatest gift in man that they would just throw those thoughts out of their mind and just and just talk about the goodness of God as brother bran would say if all you could tell them that it was lit then tell them that the Bible says he'll give you the words to speak in that very hour so take no thought of it these sisters out here may they not be discouraged what can I do for God may they understand with their Holiness they they shot upon themselves that they're preaching the gospel more than even I could ever preach it and that they're declaring the goodness of Jesus Christ when they're going through Walmart and things like that they're going through the stores may they understand they're preaching more than I ever could and they're showing the gospel on display I pray for myself as well I pray you forgive me for those times that I have failed you personally Lord when I should have said something and I pray Lord as a minister of this gospel looking upon the Bride of Jesus Christ help us Lord God I pray I just feel the unction in my heart right now for these Souls that we talk to Lord may we just take a moment to think about somebody maybe it's a co-worker maybe it's a loved one a family member maybe they've lost their way and they're out in the world maybe it's a neighbor that you talk to every morning when you go to work maybe it's a co-worker that you've worked beside for the last 20 years maybe it's time for them to know what God has done for them help us lord of the Bride of Jesus Christ that as we enter in more Lord to the Supernatural and as we enter in more to get our fires lick that we get so on fire with God that will start igniting those people beside us and start spreading that fire to other people Lord help us God is the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord maybe it's a gleaning time as Ruth would go before it was time for her to lay before Boaz she walked behind the the sheepfolds and the people harvesting the Grain and she would just glean the other little corn one here and one there Lord maybe that's what's happening right now Lord that there's one here maybe there's one by by the place you work maybe there's a co-worker maybe that's the last seed and once that last he comes in we can all go home then help us Lord to be more yielding to your spirit maybe that's why I had to preach this morning Lord I don't know but that same Supernatural God that we need to enter in more we need to also start handing out to other people as Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give and what did Peter give a supernatural promise in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk help me Lord help us all Lord to be more of that witness of you God we just thank you Lord for this time I pray for this special group of people Lord who just Lord I just believe there's such a blessing willing to suffer with me Lord and be able to hear your word Lord and however you bring it Lord and whatever capacity you need to do Lord I thank you Lord at the Liberty I feel this on Lord Lord you know I don't act like this all the time God but here it feels like I can just let my hair down and just just let my heart just break before these people Lord and I thank you Lord for that is not an accident but that means there is a holy ghost moving in these people Lord and that Holy Ghost is is with that Liberty is able to reach to each soul and meat whatever need that they had Lord you can meet each need Lord when we open up the floodgates Lord we can allow the Holy Spirit to move in Lord and as brother Braden said we don't use the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost uses us so Lord may we start becoming yielded vessels unto you Lord and start being used more of you God and whatever capacity you call us to God thank you Lord for this time and I thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy and Jesus precious name the bride said together amen you love the Lord God surely is good
