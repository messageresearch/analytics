========================================

we've been reading out of Luke 15 we've been teaching out of it a little bit and preaching and so we're gonna pick it up now and the prodigal son Luke 15 has three parables in it and this is the last parable that he gives starting here in verse 11 he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that fall it to me and he divided them unto his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there was there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would fain have filled his belly with husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him notice what happens here right now he's not wet back with the father yet he's not back in church he's not but something happens that's very significant and when he came to himself and that tells us he came to who was himself it wasn't out with the swine who was his true identity he's a son of God can you say man but he had to recognize I'm not this I'm a son of God and so now that at that mother end to me friends that's a crucial moment that's the most important silent moment in a person's life only God can give that man a woman a revelation like that sometimes it's not with the big emotion not big on television stations it's a personal revelation I am a son of God I am NOT a son of this world and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare and I perish with hunger I will arise and go to my father and will sand him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee look at the humility now and AM no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of the hired service look at the humility he doesn't come with arrogance and pride expecting anything he comes with repentance and humility and that's the way to come back to God and he arose and came to his father and when he was yet a great great way off his father saw and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father I've sinned against heaven in thy sight and no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet this sure isn't a different this is a very different response than a lot of religious Pharisee people when somebody comes back oh boy you got to come through the seven steps of whatever here you can't just walk in here that's not how the father did it put a robe on it why he's a son he was born a son in any trouble that has been caused the father's going to take care of it but the subject in the rejoicing he's a son and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive he was lost and is found and they begin to be merry somebody say praise the Lord now I know I'm keeping you standing but I just want to add a couple other scriptures with this so that when I refer to them you'll see where they're at mark chapter 13 and verse 27 and I'll try not to be too lengthy today because this is a vast subject so we'll just take it in pieces but we'll just get in this segment here and I want to speak on the ministry and joy of sons coming back the ministry and joy of sons coming back and I believe we're in that hour can you say man dispensation Lee were in the hour where sons are recognizing who they are and they're coming back to the Father amen wherever you're at mark 13 verse 27 and he's in prophecy now for the end time I can't read all these but Jesus is breaking down the seven seals and the time of the seals and the time of the church and all the pressure on the church but in the middle of all this he seeks about false Christ's and false prophets shall arise with the true anointing on them the anointing is not false but the Prophet himself is false because he doesn't bring the true Word of God so we learn all that but he went in the middle of this he says this verse 27 and shall he send His angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven go with me quickly diffusions chapter 1 and you'll hear it again and the reason I'm really reading these prophetic scriptures from Paul and from Jesus is because I'm finding now that Luke chapter 15 in the three parables I really believe that they're prophetic of the day we live in if he's in chapter 1 appreciate your patience so you just wanted to read these in that way you'll know where I'm getting them from you love the Lord this morning seasons chapter 1 and verse 10 the same theme that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he'll do what he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him what's that mean sons coming back sums coming back in whom sons and daughter excuse me I got to say that you know sons in the Bible represent sons and daughters we're all sons of God spiritually but it's the sons and daughters coming back in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also that after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest or the downpayment the Holy Ghost is the downpayment it's not the full possession yet which is the downpayment of our inheritance until look at this season now the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory it's prophetic we get the Holy Ghost all through the agency got the Holy Ghost but it's only the downpayment there's a day coming we get the full possession and we're living in that time may the Lord had his blessings to the word god bless you may be seated now as I said the whole chapter in in Luke chapter 15 the whole chapter is about lost sons and backslidden sons coming back that's the theme the whole theme you remember I started out this with Jesus sitting there and this is the chapters start with Jesus amongst the sinners amongst the publicans and he didn't go out to them they came to him and they were around him listening to him talk and it was the Pharisees in Chapter in verse two that said why does he receive publicans centers so that's what set the theme for these parables is Jesus the Son of Man was actually so attractive that the public Republicans and sinners felt comfortable to be around him you remember what I said how many would like you to live a Christian life that it's so much Christ that this same manner that sinners and publicans actually enjoy being around you too often in the church Christians are not an enjoyment to be around because there's no passion in their life about Christ it's a religion to them I don't think it was that way with Christ I believe there's something about him that even the sinners and publicans felt comfortable to be around him and so that's how this theme because when the Pharisees criticized it and said hey you know you're receiving you're eating with publicans centers and these people we don't get around people like this and this is not what we do and so he criticizes so now in order to explain what was happening there he goes into three parables and the parables are about lost sons lost sheep lost coin and a lost son or son that backslidden so the parable is about lost sons and sons coming back sons that were lost coming back that's the theme in the parables at the Sheep it's a coin it's a son that's already belonged to the father they were just lost I want you to remember the Sheep it was already the shepherd sheep the coin was already the woman's coin the prodigal son was already a son can you say mine it wasn't he became a son he was already a son in anybody who studies the Bible knows predestination if you ever were a Christian you were a Christian in God's mind before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in God's mind because he knew sons had to be redeemed and so this parable says these are not people that are people that are coming they're already sons but they've lost their way they either backslidden or they haven't even come to the Father yet and so now it's this I want to say this clearly now these parables are not about serpent seed he's not referring to serpent seed what's serpent seed give me another servant to talk about that there were two seeds that were in Genesis can you say men and and so so now but he's not referring to serpent seed he's referring to sons that were already the fathers sons everybody understand that so so now it's sons coming back and the reason that Jesus did not push away these sinners and publicans listen the reason he didn't push away reason Jesus didn't say oh man wait a minute why are you guys gathering around me what are you doing like this is this is making me nervous here I mean what's this gonna look like me sitting around with publicans and sinners he didn't say any of that and you know why he didn't push away the sinners and publicans because in that group might be some of his sons in fact I think he knew that was some of his sons and so why would he push away people that were potentially that his own sons his own seed can you say man that were coming back to him that's all that's what his ministry is all about is finding lost sons that were predestinated in the father before the foundation of the world why would Jesus push away the sinners Republicans because among them is some of his sons and this is the only way for them to come back that's what his ministry is all about and the Pharisees in their religion and denominations had got to a place that I can't even be around in other words they had lost the focus of who the son at what the ministry was can I get an amen they completely lost what Jesus Christ the cinnamon and the whole ministry was all about they completely lost the idea because they said look at him being around the sinners and Providence they lost the fact that this whole thing the gospel is about calling sons calling sons drawing them back to God so I don't know what they were doing they were all about their rituals and religions and outward manifestations of what a righteous man should be if you know your Bible that's what Jesus always repeat the Pharisees for it was an external thing it was all about external things let's be careful in the message we don't become all about external things can I get an amen there's too many too many slants to the years that put emphases on external things and don't dump out the external things I believe there's external things that are spoken over the scripture that are important don't you dare dumping dump them out but don't you dare take the message and make an emphasis on external things before you see a son come back in his soul because you're gonna make another religion and lord have mercy we don't need another religion we don't need another denomination within Christianity there are thirty five thousand different denominations within Christianity we don't need another denomination we need a manifestation of the son of man in the people's lives that draw sons back to God somebody say Amen this morning oh man I'm heated up I'm heated up about this this is what the message is all about just what the mess is all about I'm just got to warn you today I had seven fillings put in my teeth just a couple days ago and my wife noticed and getting a notice that I'm talking kind of funny because something's happening back here don't know what it is so I'm just warn you if I talk funny don't laugh and also this may be a very short service today because if I recognize I'm talking funny I'm not gonna go on with that too much further but you know this is such an important thing to recognize that Jesus did not pushed him away when they were sinners because out of that there might be sons there who were coming back and he said in one place I forgot to quote this last Sunday because I forget a lot of things but he said in one place he says I did not come to call the righteous the son of man did not come to call people that were already righteous in their own righteousness my ministry that even the message did not come to call the already righteous it come to call sinners to repentance and we need to be reminded of these things can you say men so now the the ministry now as we focus in deeper the ministry my ministry is to call my sons and daughters to call my sons the gathering of Christ the Son of man in whatever age the gathering is not for the purpose to stroke the religious pride of people the correct preaching of the gospel is not to stroke and comfort the religious pride that's in people can you say Amen that's why you look in the Old Testament and in the new you find in most cases biblical prophets usually weren't coming in prophesying good they were for correction they were to get Israel back in shape they got away from God that's why they were popular so now in the ministry of Christ in the atmosphere in gathering of of where he is around it's not to stroke the religious pride of people that's not the son of man that's not the ministry in the last days we cannot have an atmosphere in our lives or our churches that drive people away and make it comfortable for us that was so good I think I'll say it again you say well you're just gonna read from your notes today don't you don't you just let the Holy Spirit lead the Holy Spirit was leading me when I typed these out last night let me find it again there it is we cannot have an atmosphere in our lives or in our churches that drive people away and make it comfortable for us that's not the Ministry of the Son of Man something's wrong even in our own ranks if the atmosphere is not comfortable that they can sense the presence of God and they can come to a repentance in God and they can recognize their identity as sons and daughters of God that's what we gather in church for that's what the preaching of the gospel is for and so now we can't and and and we can't preach the blood is off the mercy seat and expect to find the last predestinated seed and some of you know what I'm referring to certain doctrines that start to emphasize the Lambs off the mercy seat he's left the mercy seat how could we ever have an atmosphere taken the doctrine that far I realize he arose in revelations 5 I'll refer to in a minute when he arose and he advanced into the vision of John and the the title deed to the earth fell out of son's hands fell out of Adam's hands went back to the hands of the original owner and until that time nobody had rights to the earth again like son should have it but somebody stepped forth into a vision and they said the line has prevailed John don't weep the line of prevailed you know who stepped forth in that vision when John looked to see a lie and he didn't see a line he's seen a lamb who's the lamb your kinsmen and you ought to rejoice because your kinsman somebody who was worthy and your kinsman took the book of the title deed that has happened in our day can you say man but then we have we have a process that's going on in the last days of him calling sons and then taking his full possession ending in a rapture so don't you dare tell me that mercies there's no mercy on the on the mercy seat because the lamb has went forth and now it's all a judgment seat you can't preach that and create an atmosphere for the last elected scene to come in it's the false doctrine and so now Jesus didn't say I really can't stay and talk with you senators I got like I've got a kingdom to run I got a I got things to do I got a plan for a kingdom I don't have time to be around sinners the kingdom is about sons and daughters of God the kingdom isn't about this church or the church that we build this year next year the kingdom is not about a building can you say man the kingdom is not a the kingdom is not about a place the kingdom about is not just the money in because what good would the Millennium be without sons and daughters there that are the kingdom people what good is a kingdom without the king and the queen and I'm here to tell you he's building a queen with character that she'll rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years honeymoon in the Millennium I wouldn't want to be there unless I was with the rest of the bride of Jesus Christ can you say man and my King Jesus Christ yeah I'll tell you the reason he that he was about these is because that is what the King knows about there is no Kingdom without his sons to rule with him and they're never that it'll never listen now his kingdom will never be complete until every one of his sons have recognized who they are and have come back to him Jesus doesn't say let me count up you can make calculate okay we got enough numbers now we can make it happen that was funny laughs thank you have a calculator and say you know what we've meet we've met the quota this is about how much people we needed a millennium we're good shut it off rapture we're done no no it won't be complete until every son is back that was in the mind of God from the foundation of the world so a lot of the reason we're still on this earth some of you fed up with her server I'm fed up with it too but most of the reason why we're still here is the last elected scene hasn't come in yet the last son hasn't come yet but when it comes when the last elected seed and all of his sons have come back to the Father we're getting out of here that's why I can sing it's going to it's going home time I said it's going home time we're in the hour can you say man he's calling his final son's back and when they come whether they're sitting here in this congregation and have not come back to God or whether they're a prostitute on the streets of Toledo when they come God's going to draw them and when the last one comes in we're getting out of here and the kingdom and the Millennium will not be complete until every Sun is back some of you have been some of you have child children that are away from the Lord he ought to reach a hold of that right now with your hand reach all that promise and said I believe my son is a son of God I believe my daughter is a daughter of God and I reach a hold of the promise right now that not one that the father has given me not one will be turned away all that the father has given me will come I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know how we're going to do it I don't know how it's it's a big hurdle and you look at this prodigal son you look at this prodigal son he felt unworthy to come back and you would think he'd be running back he wasn't running back because he felt unworthy to come back he's hasn't he stayed a far off role for a long time and I find sons that have messed their lives up they are they have it in their heart already to come back but they feel too unworthy let me tell you what the father did was that he didn't wait for him to come and repent he didn't wait for him to get all the way back to church the father ran out to him what do we do with sons that are far off we go to them praise be to God I feel like running today hallelujah am I talking funny or I'm doing all right everybody understanding all right we can continue so now there's there's no Kingdom without a son so let's move on so now I feel there's take just a bit deeper now I feel that this mark 11 excuse me this Luke chapter 15 I feel that this the seventh seal revelation is all over this chapter and I didn't realize it till just the last few days but the seventh seal the coming of the Lord the seventh seal revelation what he's doing in the last days is all over these parables why do you say that brother Paul because in the last days as I read you two scriptures there's many more that refer to it the scriptures for the last days it refers to there is a gap during there's a gathering there's a calling and there's a gathering of his elect from the four corners of the earth the angels will call for it and there's a gathering of is his elect from the four corners of the earth now naturally that's happened to Israel and it's still happening to Israel right now whatever happens naturally to Israel happens to the bride's spiritually you listening whatever happens to Israel naturally happens to us spiritually so with the Second World War and the wars that took place many of the wars we find that there was a gathering of Israel back to her homeland she's still gathering back there it's a spiritual gathering and all his elect which would be there'll be many Jews gather back but there's a hundred and forty-four thousand their elected Benjamin Jews that are going to come back to Israel and receive Christ they're the elect but they've been gathered for the four wins spiritually God calls his sons in the Gentile bride he calls his sons from all the corners of the earth I don't know what corner you were in but whatever corner it is you were sitting in a bar you were with all kinds of men you women you were abused you were somewhere you you were atheist you didn't believe in God at all it doesn't matter what corner you came from if you're a son you're coming the obstacles isn't a problem with God because you're a son and what's that son recognized he's gonna start heading back once he recognized like the praça side what am I doing here what a discovery that the greatest discovery that can happen in a believers life is like what am i doing this for what am i doing here why I'm why am I in this bar why am I in this adulterous relationship this isn't me greatest discovery you can make I've tried my whole life to live like they live out there but this isn't me I'm a son of the father and I'm going back can you say man friends what a wonderful thing hope Solomon doesn't mind me sharing this but he shared it with his mom but you know he works in a restaurant as a waiter and so people can when they get a little you know drunk or sniffing he start saying so they asked him wearing what to school he said I went to Stateline Christian school right away they know that it's a conservative school they're very you know strict in certain areas there which I'm glad for and so right away oh yeah so the next question are you a virgin you take some off guards well yes I am so you've a matter of fact he says I've never even kissed a girl you'd imagine the laughter you can imagine this the smirks they said Oh son I let yes and here's my car let me take you out let me talk to you a little bit about about real life and having some fun so first of all young people and everyone you're always going to have traps for somebody to redefine your identity and to tell you you know what you're like us you're more like us than what you realize if you really let your you let yourself go there a little bit you'll find you're missing out on a lot of fun what a trap what a what a deception so he thinks that because he was at state liners because he's me raised in a Christian home whatever it is but I just started that as I was preaching I thought thank god praise the Lord Solomon took a stand said no this is the way I believe this way I'm gonna do it praise God but I got to thinking now if that goes deeper in Solomon that's not because he went to Stateline Christian school that's not just because he was raised in a Christian home that's all great and I think us parents should provide the best atmosphere that coincides with our beliefs as much as we can that's just my per se that's my opinion as a as a as a parent that's the way I've approached it is that if I can I tried to bathe and then ease them into being exposed to the things of the world that they have to be exposed to but when they're young I'm gonna try to put them as best I can as atmospheres at the closest to what I believe and so now but I want to that being said that doesn't guarantee that there would be someone that stays a virgin can you say man what does it come down to a son of God recognizing his identity that I'm a son and when that revelation is strong and powerful it's strong enough to go up against the temptation to say the same thing that Jesus said I am not of this world I am not from here I live here I'm in this world but I'm not out of this world I'm not a son of this world I don't function like they function in the world I'm a son of God can you say man was it state line that did it I believe it's a recognition that I could he didn't say it but he could say to them this is real simple I am NOT you and I know the reason we don't say that sometimes because it's belittling that person you have to be careful what you say but you say in your heart I know why I'm not you we're different by the grace of God I'm not you I'm a son of God okay can you say man that's the revelation that's needed so now the seventh seal revelation is that is in the last station it's a gathering elect to come back to the full inheritance you're still with me alright in their renovations yesterday they took the clock down so we're all in trouble now the taking of this book in Revelations 5 is about taking his possession back and our rights as sons bringing sons back to full inheritance revelations 5 when he takes that book it's the title deed to the earth Adam lost it he was the son of God on the earth he was in charge of the earth he had all power he can name the animals he can move trees he can move mountains he was a minor God on the earth can you say man but that title NIDA and that power and all that went with that he lost it in the fall so he didn't have the rights to it anymore I'm here to tell you when our lamb steps forth in revelations chapter 5 after 2,000 years of ancestry ancestry in incest in seseri work in other words he was our intercessor for 2,000 years and he was making our high priest making Appeals because he was our high but there was a change in motion when we come to revelations five that our lamb we went to Calvary and paid the price now steps forth and he's the only one worthy to take that deeded book and take that with our names in that book and he knows who the sons are he's gonna call his sons now from heaven and from Earth that's why in Revelations 5 he says when he took the book the Prophet said that it was a most sublime thing in the scripture and last Sunday I preached to you heaven begin to rejoice fact all the elders and all the ones where the prayers went up all those years they begin to rejoice over this taking of the book and it's word he has made us kings this priest the prophet word that he says he's taking us back to make us kings and priests in other words it's not just the sons on earth it's all of heaven rejoicing and they're saying he's gonna bring us all back to sons and daughters about he's gonna bring us back to be kings and priests and we shall reign on this earth wasn't gonna happen until the lamb took the book and that's why I said last Sunday whatever heaven rejoices over we're rejoicing over I was trying to just say what is it Lord about this what is it about this book this book going into the hands of our kinsmen that's a significant thing because your brother Christ your kinsman one of your own kind is that you understand what I'm saying came to earth and lived in a flesh body like yours has today has a hold of the title deed with all the names of the sons in it that's why they rejoiced that's why John shouted so loud he said everything in earth and everything in heaven and air all the ana lever ething heard me shouting I got a tad excited must have seen his name there under the seals he got excited can you say man I'm gonna skip over most of this part skip to the end here but this now because of that in the last days is a ministry I'm gonna call it of reconciliation Paul in second Corinthians five said Christ was reconciling us back to the Father and he says we have this Ministry of reconciliation so Christ had it wherever Christ is and if crisis in his bride what is it it's a ministry to reconcile sons that have gone away and reconciling put them back with the father so our ministry is to through the word this is to wrecked because he said it's a word of reconciliation our ministry is to take this word and take the life of Christ and reconcile sons back to the thoughts that God had in them before the foundation of the world somebody say praise the Lord and guess what you want to know what the message is that's what the message came to do this message is a gathering of sons it's the it's the angels calling in the last days for all the sons for the four corners and gather all in that are in Christ and gathered and whether in heaven on earth it's a great gathering of sons to call them all back to their inheritance and the lamb has the inheritance the title deed to all the inheritance and it's ready now to be handed back into use his children but you see now the word is to reconcile us back to the thoughts of God don't you forget that that's if you have Christ that's one of the main reasons he's given you Christ inside your life and that is to be available and create an atmosphere for lost sons and loss and backslidden sons to come back to God and I'll say it again this is the message that's what the message is you say well what about all the parts of it that trying to refer something else because I always refer to the same thing seems like but what about all the details about dressing modest and what about this and what you know what about all this that's that's in the message it's all still a part of sons coming back because if he's restoring daughters back to God then he would reconcile them back with what - what a daughter of God really dresses like can I get a name man that doesn't have to do with religion or Amish or anything like has to do with our Father God hovering over his daughters and saying I loved them so much I want to reconcile them back to what a daughter of God really is because they've heard way too many images they watched Hollywood way too much and they're tainted in their mind what a woman is I love them enough I'm gonna tell them through a prophet the restoration of this great position of a woman somebody pray your sisters ought to be clapping right now for me thank you that's what the message is every detail would see how fast to drive and all these other all those other things well I just look at it and saying sons are B sons are being called back to their true identity because the identity of the world and sometimes the identity of a denominational Christian and I don't mark all denominations like this but sometimes the image of a denominational Christian I couldn't follow it because there's no holiness there there's no sanctification anymore sanctification is marked but I believe in sanctification because it's in the Bible so that Christian he can keep his movies all the dirty movies he can still say some dirty jokes at work he can drink a little here and there he can do this I'm not happy with that type of image because I look in my Bible that's not the Bible image sons of God are gonna walk around he can't tell any difference in them and the guy at the bar I'm preaching hard now but I'm not here to not here to make it soft for you I'm here to tell you the truth are you interested in the I dieted identity of sons and daughters of God or are you interested in somebody's version of what a Christian should be I can't follow that I'm not interested in that it should be something different not odd or strange but it should be something distinct something different the identity of sons and daughters of God are coming on the face of the earth and they're gonna be displaying what the true sons and daughters of God are young people don't borrow from the image of the world get your mind out of the magazine get your mind out of the books because it's tainting your image of what your identity really should be where should I get I might get in the Word of God say why is the person doing that why are they starting to dress so sexy and why are they going off in that direction I'll just tell you one thing they're not in the word there's no way you can say baptized or bathed in this word all the time and come up with conclusions like that and come up with me you can't do it because the words a filter a thinking man's filter and back in the old days they had a slogan for the cigarette company a thinking man's filter or smoking man's taste and they were they were doing it to try to sell more cigarettes so they put a filter so you get all the tire you just get some of it oh did it make people want to smoke more of them because they had to get the same amount of tower tar oh yeah this is God's filter we bring our lives through this filter this is a thinking man's filter we bring our lives through the filter this word and I guarantee you what comes out the other side is a son and daughter of God the true identity of God amen praise the Lord you love him so now let me get done this last part here of your true identity because this is the calling of sons alright anybody seen in the last few years the great thrust anybody seen in the last few years the great thrust of companies doing ancestry research and DNA testing and that just come up I don't know how many years it just you just noticed it now it's a huge thing big thing so you pay so much money to ancestry.com and so and so now as believer in mature believers now look at this what happens in the natural in science is the type of what God's doing spiritually in the church so what the Prophet taught us okay we were in the horse and buggy days we didn't have automobiles well the church was in the horse and buggy days under Luthor restoration of justification then we came to the Automobile science invented the automobile so we're going faster the church is going faster it came in to the Wesley's age of sanctification the church was restored back more then we come into the airplane somebody the Wright brothers science develops an airplane so we're no longer in horse and buggy we're no longer no automobile we're flying high you know who that was 1906 Azusa Street Pentecostal the Pentecostal movement had a flying high brother enjoying the blessings of God the nine spiritual gifts in the church clapping our hands rejoicing can you say Amen I'm glad we still got that but it's not the last move of God Pentecost is not the last move of God that was the only small reflection of the original pink costs we're supposed to get going back to all of Pentecost lost not Azusa Street back to the damned Pentecost so science brought to the airplane and what was the next step astronaut Age so we're not just staying in the Pentecostal age the astronaut age where you leave the earth can you say man you're not just flying above above the where the clouds are you're going above the clouds and you're going to different planets so spiritually the church began to do this so what I always look in the news I would look for these developments in science one of them you could talk about is the development of the laser of light the development of light light light has been developed so much they can do so many things with light and surgeries with light piercing so what is that reflective of the light has become stronger the light has become more powerful the light is the word for the church she's got a powerful word so here when I begin to see these ancestry things come up it's all about identity it's all about people who have a hunger to find their true identity where did I come from why do I use my nose look this way whoa who's my what country did I come from did I originate in Africa that I did I did an Elizabeth Warren she got in trouble for all this you know she just threw it out there and it's something and then she had the dita so anyway let's leave that alone but anyway you know it's people who want to attach themselves but they want to find out their true ID can you say men and this thrust and this hunger is so so now they come to this place that they are no longer satisfied with things that are judged from the outward appearance are no longer satisfied with things that are judged from the outward appearance they want to find get to the seed realm they want to get to the DNA realm oh friends we ought to be shouting right now whatever happens now she's having spiritually the bride I'm no longer happy with a religion people judge me from the outside what's my spiritual DNA where did I come from how so now these people pay big sums of money now to say where they come in and they can stand there and say showed up a picture and here's my great-great-great-grandfather not actually I thought I came from this plant I come from this country and it goes back and it makes them feel happy or makes them fine kind of like a sound like a son that didn't know his father a daughter didn't know his father and they'll have these shows on TV where they'll have a a reunion they're gonna see their true father after 30 35 40 years old they're gonna for the first time see their true father by the DNA testing by the by the testing they do in science and so it's a great union and a lot of times it reek brings a lot of peace to that person who's tried to figure themselves out their whole life looking at their adopted father and mother and trying to say I don't look like that why do I act this way they're not me they're not my blood I love them they're my surrogate father mother but but but they're but they're who am I like where did my traits come from can you say mine and a lot of times that Jesus you know Jesus felt the same way he looked over one day and he's looking in the mirror he looks over at his mom he's looking at his face look at his features looks at his mom's doing man I don't know I don't look like that very much looks over his dad I you know I don't look that hood and begin to wonder himself Who am I where did I come from something's odd here something strange and even though she was the incubator can you say man Joseph had nothing to do with it but these people get on these shows and all of a sudden when they meet and they spend a few days with their true father this is test their testimony a piece settles in their life because now I know really where I came from I'm telling you that's a spiritual meaning to it for the hour that we're in right now this isn't just the Pentecostal blessing friends this isn't just an external identification of a Christian this is a search spiritually the seals are the seals is a spiritual exploration of the DNA of the church so the other one that came up a few months ago is this place called 23andme okay science fulfilling man's hunger to be to get it you are and they say on this website you are made of cells and the cells in your body have 23 pairs of chromosomes zomes your chromosomes are made of DNA which can tell you a lot about you explore your 23 pairs today find out what your 23 pairs of chromosomes can tell you 23andme offers two personal genetic services health and and ancestry and then just ancestors you can pay for however much it is and you can do healthy can you imagine now listeni and this I read this on the radio there they're taking these things and they're finding out their individual health weaknesses their health Bent's that that they have to watch out for and they're not doing it by a doctor looking externally at symptoms anymore they're doing it from the DNA it could preach another our friends can you say man the word has been open to us the book of redemption has been open the seven seals have been taken off and the bride is learning her true spiritual DNA we're learning what sons of God didn't say in Romans that were in the day when the manifestation of the sons of God will take but all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God amen that's why I say that when Jesus our kinsmen took the book another son took the book back that our first son our first father Adam lost and when he fell we all fell with him does everybody understand when Adam fell we all felt with them that was the first Adam how many know there was a second Adam how many know there's our first Eve she found by the word she fell away from the word but if there's a second Adam there has to be a second Eve can you say man and our second Adam Jesus Christ he's our kinsman and he emerged into this this vision of John and he has the book of redemption in his hands and he begins to break the seals off and it begins to show our true identity and a so the sons of God can see who they really are from the foundation of the world and begin to rejoice in it can you say man he said ancestry services in house services proofs gives insight on your genetic health risk carrier status traits wellness and ancestry we analyze

relatives who share the similar DNA praise be to God what we all here for how in the world do you get a group of people that have come so many different backgrounds sitting here this morning worshiping together brothers and sisters because he's revealed our true DNA and it brings our true family members together praise be to God that's why you're here you're not here for church you're gathering with your family here blood family can you say me you're discovering who you are can you say man no wonder it's a rejoicing no mother it's a joy like the prodigal son hey I'm going back to my father because that's who my identity is blessed be his name we're in so what hell that's just wonderful so their yarn science and here we are spiritually when the seven seals were open I'm wrapping up now I promise you when the seven seals were opened it reveals our spiritual identity why now why did you do it in the last days because it's time for the manifestation of the sons of God all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God why to get back to the sons with the title deed in their hand again you say now here's what I want you to catch we were saved and we were we knew we were forgiven 2,000 years ago by Christ who went to the cow our land went to Calvary and he paid the price to redeem us back that's all he did you say man and that's fine we rejoice in that most of Christianity today in their churches celebrate Calvary and the forgiveness of sins but they only go that far but they haven't read their Bible close enough to realize at the end time under the seventh angel revelations 10-7 there'll be a the mysteries of God should be finished and we have our lamb and revelations 5 he's done with Calvary 2,000 years or worse yet sitting at the right hand of authority of the Father there's a movement and he steps forth so now remember what I said the first Adam because it is him and he's because their fault we all fell so if that can happen that way then when our kinsman our brother second Adam takes this book and he has it in his hands if we all fell by our first Adam we're all beginning to rise by the second Adam but we're not just forgiven by Calvary we're taking the full possession back God's gonna give it fully back to his son all right I'm gonna end on this example when to quit I said much more there say for example the LaFontaine family here there's about 22 23 24 of us say we had a piece of land and we all lived on it say we all went in debt and we all went to jail all of us we lost our land lost our possession it was sold and given giving back and it was just in a place and we all were in jail because of the debt okay Isaac is the only one who survived it he didn't go to jail Ickes my brother if you don't know Isaac's my brother he's up here playing the organ so we're all in jail we're just waiting okay so then because I guess the one who's able to do it Eike Eike wins the lottery and he has the money to go and bail us out and pay the price so he goes to the pawn shop as it were he goes to the city he goes to this and say now listen this is this land was owned by our family okay I'm their brother and I have the I can pay the price they can't pay it but I'm paying the price right now are you children young people listen to me I'm explaining revelations five to you all all your children all the children they owned this all that all all the family owns that but I'm here because I'm able and I'm paying the price right now but for some reason Isaac he pays the price but he doesn't get the deed he leaves okay so now when he comes back and gets his cellphone and calls us while we're in jail we start to pass the phone around we're pretty excited because the price has been paid our redemption has been paid that's that's quite a rejoicing that's one of the first things I believe our needs are recognized can you say mine you don't pray the price for your own sins you don't pay the price for your mistakes you don't do penance for your mistakes Jesus either paid it off or he didn't pay any of it he paid it all every mistake you made every sin that you were born with sin that you were born with and everything that you've committed came on that cross that day and he took and paid the price for it that's what makes us live reverent before the Lord but we're all rejoicing we're having a good time but there's still a bit of hesitancy in our heart because we don't have our land back and we haven't been delivered out of jail yet we're basically still held up in jail and so you can rejoice over your price being paid it's the potential but the finish of redemption is not completed yet can you say Amen so now I I goes and he's already paid the price and he walks into that place and he shows his receipt for paying the price which in this case it was Jesus in his blood he shows I paid my blood for this we I paid the price of blood and so when he shows the receipt the guy goes back in the file and he gets the entire possession of the land everything is set free everything and he brings that paper out the title deed to ownership to it and he hands that to Ike and Ike has that catch this now catch this it's not in the hands of the city anymore it's not in the hand of the enemy anymore the ownership and the title deed is in the hands of my brother hallelujah it's not in some file it's not there anymore it's changed I'm preaching what has happened in the last days according to revelations 10 and according resolutions 5 were not in the age of the seven churches anymore we're in the last days when the mission should be finished and what's the ministry to reconcile all sons back to their full possession and the first thing that had to happen in the last days as the seals had to be ripped off of the book of Redemption and now he throws it to his prophet on earth and he begins to reveal these things so the identity so you can see your name in the book and so my brother Ike he gets his cell phone matter of fact we call him we heard he was going down there to pick up the title deed and we call him on his cell phone and say I I what did you do he said I went in I show my receipt I've got it you've got it I've got it you got it Ike kind of like what I call him when he's at the Music Store did you get it I got it did you get it can you got it I've got it guys guys the Fontaine's where they add guys he's got it in his hand our brother has the ownership in his hand our kinsman has the ownership in his hands so whether we're completely out of jail or not it doesn't matter it's gonna happen real soon now cuz our brother Jesus Christ our kinsman today has the book of redemption in his hands we're in a different hour we're not in a denominational time it's a different day God has blessed us I'm sure you got a dyke like where you at where are you at he's not even here call me where you at shoulda brought my phone Mike do you have it I got it so I passed the phone around to the whole family because they have to hear that he has the title deed got it I got it got it where we had like in the bathroom okay you've been here what I've been saying you do do you got it you got the title deed you got it you sure you got it is it in your hand it's in your hand I don't think he knows what I'm talking about does he's in the bathroom you think you think we're gonna be happy in jail I think we're gonna get cited and then he begins to make the movement brings the title deed up too we see our names in that I my name's on the deed my name's on the possession jailer comes and says is that your name that's my name it's me it's my true identity it's my possession it's mine opens up the jail door walk out of there free man tell Fontaine family's got you happy family lafawn days are gonna sing a little bit been singing for 50 years but no sing is gonna come like this I think they ought to come and sing right now so I can quit preaching come on come on the Fontaine family I just told you you're rich I know a lot of you think you're not rich but you are as sons and daughters of God your spiritual millionaires this morning I'm talking to you all now as sons and daughters of God your spiritual millionaires this raptures as good as in the bag it's as good as done because why my kinsmen my kinsmen has the book of redemption in his hands have you recognized your true identity have you recognized who you are have you recognized who the prodigal sons are brother loyal it's those that are recognize your identity you know it's beautiful about that story is that he didn't come through in a 10-step seminar on how to work his way back to a son he already was a son and you know the moment he changed you know the moment the real change we think well it's when he come back and repented or he said when he come back and got the robe on no no the moment he changes when he said is when he said somebody help me out he came to himself I just came to myself trying to remember that the change happened I mean remember the story that brother Branham told one time of the used car dealer and the used car dealer was a center he doesn't didn't serve God his wife did he went not she went to all these conventions everything but he what he didn't care about God anything so he reaches one day he's working as a used car salesman which is usually isn't this little shady anyway but uh he picks up this track somebody threw it in the trash and he picks this track so where were you spend eternity here some some little track from whatever and so he starts to read through this and read the scriptures and something happens in him and he recognizes his need for God he turns his life right there okay so now what happened with him is that he went to his wife she said you need to come to the convention story you got to get this so they went to a Billy Graham they went to different conventions not Pentecostal ones they different different conventions and he was searching for and I got to get this I gotta get something he says whenever I went he told this to brother bream says whenever he says I tried to get something I couldn't get it then he goes to the Pentecostal conventions and he had people prophesying over him and different things and all these different things going on and and so now then then they go to all these conventions and he goes to all Roberts and our Robert says you mean you can get it you get it speak speaking tongues and tried to teach him to speak in tongues hello hello you're not to teach somebody's speaking Tony's the Holy Ghost does his work but you see he's searching for something and we came to brother Brandon brother Brent says you know what you know when your change took place you said you don't need to keep searching when you read that tract your heart changed right there you got your you got what you needed right there now you just need to grow in the Lord and that's what happened to the prodigal he recognized I'm not this I'm a son of God and to the father that's all that needed to happen can you say man can we stand together are we happy that other preachers getting done here what are we singing guys to hopefully I priests over you can think of a song we need a drummer and we need other people I did just do rejoice look what the Lord saw about that give it a key for Cherie there you guys glad to be out of jail [Music]
