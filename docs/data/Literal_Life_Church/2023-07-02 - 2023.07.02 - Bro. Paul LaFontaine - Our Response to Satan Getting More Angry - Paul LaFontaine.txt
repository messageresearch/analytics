========================================

Nehemiah we're going to read from Nehemiah chapter 4 Nehemiah chapter 4. thank you for giving me time to just share those things from my heart Nehemiah chapter 4 and verse 1. we're going to read through verse 17 I'll try to read rapidly but I just want you to catch the theme here in the time when they were rebuilding they'd finished the temple and now they were rebuilding the walls of protection around the temple which ended up being the the finish building the walls was the finishing part and I'm always attracted to these scriptures that they were finishing the work because we live in a day that we're in the finish of the work of God how many know that God's Building a building a spiritual building and you're you're that habitation it's not about this building it's about your building being a temple for the Lord and he's finishing that now we're in the finished work of God building his temples and his Temple and now this final stage was building the wall but we find here that when they were in that final stage they got some opposition from the enemy and that's what I want to read about here this morning Nehemiah chapter 4 but it came to pass that when Samuel had heard that we build the wall he was Wrath he was angry and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spake before his brother and in the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews well they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned well spiritually speaking yes they will revive and take all the stones that the temple was destroyed and they will be used to revive and bring a Revival and put all that back together the answer is yes that's what we're doing now tobiah and the the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall hear o Our God this Nehemiah asking God now for we are despised and turned their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the Builder so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work so now the people would not be and Nehemiah had to encourage them don't be distracted by the anger of the enemy keep your mind on what we're doing we're in a building project and we're finished in this building but Satan would like in his anger to stop that to discourage us and Nehemiah says we're going to pray we're going to continue and we're going to the people were of a mind to get back to the work that we're doing but it came to pass that when Samuel and tobiah and the Arabians and the amorites and the astodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very raw so before their wrath and now they're very Roth Wednesday night I said why is the devil becoming even more angry now they're very Roth at this this work is continuing they're getting a revelation of what to do and they're doing it can you say amen and conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it so now they're going to gather and they're going to fight against this here's nehemiah's response nevertheless we made our prayer unto God and set a watch against them day and night because of them listen there are some incidences today that we don't have the answers for many times and so we have to go to prayer fervent prayer his response is that you know what we're going to pray and we're not going to stop praying because the devil would like us to stop praying but we're not going to stop praying and sometimes that's the only thing we have left to do but we're going to bring a fervent prayer in faith for every need and Judah said the strength of the Bears of the burns is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall verse 13. therefore said I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles into the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives your houses blessed be the name of the Lord don't be intimidated by the anger of the enemy can you say Amen we're going to pray and we're going to continue to fight not just for us but for our sons and daughters as well and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to not God stepped in and brought their counsel to not that they couldn't even fight when that happened then they that we returned all of us to the wall even one unto his work back to the job back to our Focus back to God's achievement can you say Amen because why vengeance is mine saith the Lord let God take care of your problems we pray and we get back to the work of the Lord and it came to pass from that time forth that half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both their Spears the Shields and the bows and uh habardians and the rulers behind all the house of Judah they which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laided everyone with one of his hands everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon every Everybody anybody ever see a picture like that with one hand they're building the wall the other hand they got a weapon for protection for the builders everyone had a sword girded by his side and so build it and he that sounded the trumpet was by me praise the Lord we'll just stop right there there's so much here in fact I already preached my sermon so we could close now we could shout for an hour praise the Lord we don't have to be afraid can you say Amen let's pray I want to speak on our response to Satan getting more angry father we pray you'll bless your word this morning we pray that the anointing of God would fall on me and upon my lips Lord and I am feeble Within Myself I tell you that all the time I I don't know why you chose me for this work to Shepherd your people but lord I can't get away from the calling and so I offer up not myself but I offer the word before the people I offer your promise to anoint their faith this morning I pray to reach out and stand and I pray that you'll bless every need that's under the sound of our voice wherever it may be I pray that you'll bless each one with the word today as we commit the service to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen God bless you may be seated how many know that Satan is getting angry and getting even more Angry all the time we are seeing Satan's Fury Unleashed like never before we've been in conversations with Believers saying it just seems like there's an increase of the devil doing his work and he's very angry and his anger is increasing towards Believers and as we spoke Wednesday night the main reason is that there is a people in the last days that's becoming one with the head Jesus Christ because the head Christ has returned to us his full headship has returned to us we can't become one with our husband until he is present here and then we can become one with him he the word Christ has returned to us in the last days the full word Christ has returned to us and it's not just your Bibles it's the person of Christ and when the bride gets a revelation that his headship is here then they know they're the only ones on Earth that it's time for me to submit to it it's time for me to come under that headship and become one with that head I mentioned Wednesday night about a wedding if a bride was there and all the wedding party everybody showed up but the husband didn't show it up you couldn't have a wedding and so everybody's waiting you know and then maybe uh he maybe he's a bit late and so then he shows up he comes back to the back of the building somebody sends a notice to the front and tells the bride he's in the house he's in the building he's here and great joy settles on her because he's the husband's an out you can't proceed with the wedding without the husband and so when she gets the word he's in the house great joy comes because the wedding can continue there can be a wedding I want to tell you in the last days ahead Christ has returned to us in the form of the word can you say amen and when he's here the body can become one with the head she can become one in a marriage and then we go to a marriage supper of the Lamb so now the head Christ is here we have the mind of Christ but even greater than that there's a body coming one with it and they're manifesting Christ through her Christ is manifesting that he's here through the body in the last days and this is what Satan is howling about I'll read some quotes in a few minutes or minutes where he says in Christ the mystery the prophet says he says that that this is what Satan is howling about this is what Satan is so angry about Christ is here the headgem is here the bodies become Wing one with it there's a Vindication he is here and so he keeps saying this is what Satan is angry about as I said Wednesday night it's not your personality that Satan doesn't like it's not that you God would bless you or you don't have a lot of things that has nothing to do with Satan's anger it's when a Believer is becoming one in a marriage with Christ the word that's what he how's about that's what he gets angry when he begins to see the life flowing through body members and it's manifesting the same way it did two thousand years ago Satan begins to get angry now the climax comes in and gets even more Angry the bride has been laying in the presence of the Sun for many years now and she's maturing into manifested sons of God and you that know your Bible know that this last days is when it says all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God well we can't manifest anything until he's here I know we meet him in the air there's the physical return of Jesus Christ there's a coming of the Lord that we're still looking forward to but he comes because we have to become one with his headship he has to have the preeminence in the bride's life and there's no other group of people in the face either they accept those elected ones those that are Holy Ghost people that are coming one with this word and she's doing it and Satan is howling at it he doesn't like it because they're maturing into these manifested sons of God and that is happening now by the power of God not by intellect not by Mysteries not just knowing the Mysteries not by head knowledge not by understanding it up here but there's a power in it that's manifesting through his people preaching Satan can't stop that no intellectual mind can stop what's already been put in motion in the cycle of the seventh seal which is the coming of the Lord he said we're in the cycle of it already and once that's put into motion Satan can't stop it no matter no matter what he does he can't stop it no matter what what fighting he does there's no demon in hell can stop what God has put into motion he couldn't stop at the turn the first time when Christ came the first time when things were set in motion and that that that young 15 year old girl believed the word and something happened inside of her and and a supernatural uh uh seed was planted inside of her which was Christ by her believing there isn't one Herod there isn't one Spirit there isn't one demon there's no political system that could stop that child from being born Paul says I travail until Christ be formed in you and once he's formed inside you it's going to begin manifesting and there's nothing Satan can do to stop it it's good you can't stop it can't stop this power it's always been about getting angry at our Revelation I forgot something Wednesday night and I woke up before in the morning I said you forgot to say this you forgot to complete that point so thankfully I have another another service to complete it I was trying to give the example from the very beginning of the garden Satan's trouble and his anger was rooted in the Revelation that Believers had he became jealous and resentful towards it so I went through this thing and how Cain brought this and said this is what God wants this is where I'm going to worship Abel brought a bloody Sacrifice by Revelation but I forgot to end it that that's where Cain got so angry at Abel that he actually killed him he murdered them that's how angry people be can become under the spirit of Satan at another believer don't take it personal if you've got a revelation from God and you're acting that out by Revelation not into that you should expect that some are going to get upset about it you can expect to be persecuted can you say Amen so here that began in the garden and all the way through there was tension all the way through there was tension and the tension between the cap of Satan and the camp of God was usually this God God's people were living out of Revelation by a mystery they caught by Revelation they're living it out uh there's a comment there in Christ the mystery God revealed the people of the Old Testament he says they were they they didn't know what they were doing they only knew they were LED of God to do something I love that statement they didn't know what they were living out in the Old Testament but they were in the vision of God living out a type and Shadow of Christ they didn't know what they were doing but they only knew they were LED of God to do something that's the way we are today we can't explain everything we're doing when you're doing it by Revelation you can't explain it all up here but you're living it out can you say amen and Satan's going where's this coming from it's coming from a revelation that Satan can't get his grubby mitts on Hallelujah and so now here we come Satan getting angry more angry and uh did you ever have somebody get mad at you and more mad and more ad and just more and more more mad and it just keeps festering against you and you weren't doing anything intentional to make them mad now if you're doing something intentional I'm talking about a person now because the devil I like to make you mad intentionally but not a not a not a motive of Just In My Own Strength but if this word if it bothers him to keep preaching all the message and all the counsel of his word if that bothers Satan then I'm going to keep preaching it amen if that makes him more Angry then I'm going to keep doing it I'm going to keep building this wall I'm going to keep doing I'm going to keep believing it but did you ever anybody ever have somebody just they're just angry with you and getting more and more angry but you didn't do anything intentional to to to receive that type of anger towards yourself and uh this is how it is sometimes is that you're not really doing anything necessarily out of the ordinary but just living the life and believing and uh uh you know when someone is mad at you and becomes more angry at you and you haven't done anything intentionally to bring it then you got to look and say I don't have the problem here that person has a problem they come to you with built up angers I just I can't believe you did this then they go off on you and you're going my goodness chill out a little bit what did I do and if I did something I want to apologize for it a lot of people don't come and tell you what you did wrong I think we should be adults in Christ and brothers and if you got something to get somebody the Bible says to go tell them but the investor in their anger then they're so angry at you they lash out at you and they've never even talk about you don't even know what you've done and so the problem is not with you then you have to release that because they've got the problem they've got the problem with their anger this is the devil is that I can safely say that he's the one with the problem brother Wallace I'm not the one with the problem I have the Lord the devil's the one that's got the problem with the word of God and a problem with my revelation and so I'm not going to live under his guilt I'm not going to live under his threatening can you say Amen I'm not going to live under this devil is becoming more Angry in these last days before this Rapture I'm not going to be affected by that I want to lose sleep over that can you I'm not going to be intimidated by the report of the enemy can you say Amen his anger is not going to bother me because he's the one with the problem I say to all of you and those those are listening in the Toledo area and the broadcast what Toledo needs in all this area in this Michigan area what what this area needs is thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God centering out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity and undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish real Christians that's thundering out against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how you can jump and how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrate into God if you say anything to them call them anything you want they're just as sweet as they can be and they move right on oh my that throws them away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil Hallelujah that's what the kingdom of God needs that's what this area needs that's what the world needs it's not your personality it's when someone gets a revelation and they're living a Sanctified life with that revelation that's what makes the enemy mad Thunders out against the enemy he hates a confession of faith Satan hates a confession of faith when it's dark and there's no hope he can't stand a confession of faith Satan hates that but the Believers are going to do it Believers are going to say Lord anoint my faith I have faith given to me by God but anointed make it Revelation faith because this is the thunder that comes out against the enemy so now I want to move along and say another reason that Satan is mad and I know this is simple but another reason that Satan is getting more angry now is because I believe his days are numbered I believe his days are numbered and I'm I'm wondering if lately Satan is trying to take his final swing right now the final punch the the final because he's so weak he hardly has anything left after fighting the bride for six thousand years he hardly has anything so he's going to take the final swing that he has the final punch that he has because he has nothing left and he knows that his days are numbered and it's in these final days that he gets angry it's when the time came listen now it's when the time came for the Deliverance that that is when Pharaoh got more angry with God's people when it was time for their Deliverance Pharaoh got more angry shouldn't that say something to us we're close to Deliverance so what's going to happen the devil's going to get more angry at you now you can look at it and say I'm scared of her no don't be scared him just say my my homecoming is very very soon here let them get angry because it's probably all through the scripture every time he got more Angry it was time for the people of God's Deliverance to get out of here Pharaoh increases the pressure Pharaoh increases then when they he said he let him go then he got more mad and he turned on them and he came with an all Pharaoh's Army he kept his anger increase more and more all the time it's because the time of Deliverance was at hand Speed Ahead 2000 years it's when Christ was about to be born that the Bible says that Herod got Roth he began to kill the children he began to take extra measures to kill the children because the Bible says he got more wrath about this thing why the time of Christ being delivered was at hand I look at the lgbtq if I'm saying it right XYZ chanting in their parades were coming for your children Satan has become more Wrath a home that is chosen to apply the token and live a Sanctified life and those children are under that headship and Direction and obedient to it I've been studying that Passover night some stuff Charles Spurgeon said I'll probably read it in a few weeks Charles Spurgeon elaborates on this Passover and says it's it's not just that Christ paid for us but look at them in that evening because the the CR what happened was is the death angel was coming to the home into the firstborn and God gives them a token to apply to the door of the blood to the door on display but then he says be in your home there and they begin to Rejoice because it was a Passover Lamb unleavened bread they ate together was a Passover which means that Death Angel would pass over their house and without the blood without the word which the bleeding word is that benefits of the Lamb without that he won't pass over our house we have no protection against homosexuality for our children we have no protection outside of the token Holy Ghost can you say Amen don't try to do it in your own intellect try to try to hold your kids back pray with them and apply their token to your home can't I don't have enough amens in this this morning you know this is reality he's coming for your children we have nothing but the token of the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost and they were rejoicing because they heard that Death Angel pass all the houses and go to different ones and the screams and cries as firstborns would die but in their home their firstborn was still that means it passed over and Christ Our Passover land went to Calvary you don't have to go to judgment you don't have to be judged for your sins your mistakes are under the blood of Jesus Christ jobs that's going to pass over your life and you ought to rejoice in that this morning [Applause] Hallelujah it was it was coming the enemy the death angel for the children coming for the children Herod was Roth coming for the children a lot more could be said about that I want to show you his time is short out of Revelations 12 verse 1. notice this this is a little bit lengthy reading as well but look at this I know you've studied this before but look how real it is and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet upon her head a crown 12 stars and she being with child child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered so right now we have a vision that John is having of a woman the Jews and they're getting ready to be delivered to that man-child and this happens first of all to Christ coming and then Herod becomes wrath but then second of all is Christ being formed in the bride so it's just spiritual happening and she being with child cried travailing and birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew a third part of the stars of Heaven and did cast them into the Earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born this is our devil this is his anger this is his agenda when Christ is being formed inside of a people and ready to be delivered that's when he becomes more angry she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up into God into his throne the devil missed him he couldn't get him and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she had the place repaired of God that they should feed her there are three thousand two hundred and three score days all that types into eventually the gospel spreading and coming over to America which was a Haven for the church to come to in that time she had no safe place in Europe anymore so she came over here so she could be protected for a Time the United States was that haven for them to come to well she wouldn't be prosecuted by the church of England and also the Catholic church so she come over for a season to be here now Speed Ahead of our country now look where we're at now and everything turns around and now we have the same devil that's going to go after an economical Council go after ones go after that that true faith of Pentecost in the people he's going to go after that in our same country of America because it's the Dragon then then he sees the vision and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels because there's been a war going on ever since Christ was born actually actually ever since the beginning there's been a war going on but when Christ was born and he didn't grab that man child and stop that because he couldn't stop it now there's been war in heaven for 2000 years and he Satan prevailed not neither was there Place found any more in heaven and that great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan was deceive of the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I Heard a Voice Now notice now he's fighting in the other dimension he's fighting constantly fighting Believers and fighting the faith of the Believers but now notice the change he's cast out of the Heavenly Dimension to Earth and the same things happens the only reason he could be cast out of Heaven to the Earth is because the bride's being delivered and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying now is salvation come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death I say praise the Lord I say we need to hear testimonies more and more and more I say we need to overcome by the blood of the lamb and by our testimony I want to hear the testimonies text them to me send them to me because we're in an hour we need to hear the testimony of what the Lord is doing it'll make the devil angry but we're going to make him angry because what we're not going to stop testifying of what God is doing in this last minute if we don't testify of God's work then we're going to hear all the gossip and the persecution and the negative of the even this church it's good preacher negative travels faster than positive somehow with our cell phones and with our what we tell our children and our families and the gossip and it's mostly all negative and it just passes along passes along that's why sometimes it takes a while when you come together just if you'll yield yourself I didn't intend on saying this but we live in a dark time and then you hear all the stuff this and the messages going on this family and the church don't like me and oh and that's why it's hard for the song leader to just get you in the spirit of God that's his job because you're all down and depressed sometimes when I start preaching it takes a while for you to come on into the Same Spirit I'm in I don't blame you for that but listen try some Services where you come all prayed up ready to go and you you spend Saturday go to bed a little early praying and spend Saturday maybe talking about the testimony and the positive things that are going on the things God is doing the devil doesn't like that and he his gossiping Spirits tend to run away and other people will run away if you start talking like that because that's not their language positive is not their language talking about the kingdom of God and the good things are it's not the devil's language gossip is this language negative is his language persecution accusing Elders is his language you start doing it in Satan flees like my dad in the car one day devil telling them you're you're not even a believer depressing and putting them down and speaking to them my dad got so upset he said I can't believe you come in this car like this and start talking to me like that so well you're not even going to make it and he started responding to that we said if you want to have a conversation I'm going to start talking back to you I am a Son of God I've been washed by the blood of the lamb and he just said lay that laid it all out and he says Satan guess what I am going to make it in a rapture and the whole atmosphere in the car chains and Satan just Scurry It Off don't let him talk to you don't let the gossips [Applause] it's tough and say if that's where you go ahead and do it I've got a work to do in the kingdom of God God is doing great things and I'm going to stick with that word trying to help you out it's the negative that travels faster than the positive but I believe these people are testifying of the glory of God not only overcoming but the testimonies the word of their testimony is the way they overcome and they love not their lives under the desk and death I got to finish this now and therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell on the earth woe to the inhabitants of the earth of the sea for the Devils come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time ah see so what in in this knowing that is time and short what's the response it says that having great Wrath uh fairy I'm getting mad and why is it he knows that his time is shorts I know when this is this is when the bride goes up in a Rapture and he's cast to earth oh you don't want to be on earth during tribulation because the full theory of judgment and Satan's wrath and you know he wanted to take it out on the bride but God takes the bride in a Rapture he's going to take it out on the foolish virgins he's going to take it out of the Kingdom he's going to take it out because he's just so angry I lost I didn't win and I'm just gonna take it out on everybody but he's feeling that way now because he knows his time is short I'm preaching to you this morning but I'm preaching to the devil too because he's here in the service did you know he goes to church pretty faithful more faithful than some of you he's here every service so if he's here devil I might as well preach to you too your days are numbered get angry all you want to you can't stop Christ being formed in the people there is not a thing that you can do to stop it you can bring sicknesses you can threaten us you can scare us Satan you can do a lot of things to a Believer matter of fact tomorrow we may not know the next thing that you would try to do but Satan we are not afraid we are not afraid of what you would bring us because the Revelation in my heart you can't take that away glory be to God I feel like doing a victory march Hallelujah we haven't had one in a while we may just have one at the end of this service of victory march and that that's things the devil doesn't like as well get back up here and get on your notes brother Paul I'm walking a little slow today because I scraped my toe pretty bad so might as well be honest about it that's why I'm walking a little slow and Catering to that toe so going back to a few quotes here from Wednesday night just not all of them but just a few if you guys want to pull that now say so now just going back to that theme that it's it's what he housed at is the Revelation that the people of God are catching in the end time not saying well glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing that ain't it I'm a missionary what he's saying is that that's not what Satan how's that that's not what Satan get angry gets angry at we believe in that I feel like shouting even right now and I might do some of it but that's not really what Satan gets really angry at he said I'm a missioner I've been seven times practically around the world see I've seen heathens devils and everything else dance and Shout I've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestations that's carnal but I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the to the devil's question amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and raised up the head or the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body you think I'm beside myself I'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me so Satan's question that's why I was asking what's he saying the devil's question we've got the answer to the devil's question it's got to be related to Bringing doubts about is this real is this just a cult is is he really here the people of God say his headship is returned again and so his question are you really the one are you the bride receiving it but you see now if it's him and he's living his life through you the resurrected risen Christ and that Vindication is there living it out of your life that is the Vindication can you say amen and so if he has a question that's the answer to his question it's happening it's happening in me and I don't have to intellectually try to go go to bat with you to try to prove it any other way it will speak for itself in the bride's life we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ the word live within me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word that's why when you go at it intellectually with somebody that's a whole different ball game because this isn't based in intellectualism this that's why I like my daughter's song there uh here I stand his truth is what I follow it will still be true tomorrow what I believe is not the work of any man not even William Branham it's not the work of a man this is Christ the headship coming back into my life his truth is what I follow it'll still be true tomorrow what I believe is not the works of any man his kingdom can't be shaken on this solid foundation While others fall here I stand wonderful song Praise the Lord amen what I believe is not the works of any man it's not my idea it's his word he promised that here it is that's the answer to double questions he promised that he'd send a message and restore the word back to us and Satan here it is for 20 30 40 50 years seeing the manifestation of seeing the dead race if you're going on those things God will show himself the dead raised the blind eyes open the the cancer healed we've seen it identified over and over and over and over against and then not just that the character being molded in The Bride of Christ's character in her seeing the same Works in her this is happening and and that's what you tell the devil is that here it is it's happening it's manifesting don't look at the borderline Believers don't look at the carnal ones are not all in yet Satan would love to look at those and say well yeah this isn't the real thing no no no you better look at the people that have caught a revelation of this and you're seeing it in their lives devil you better look at them but he always wants to point to the borderline Believers they're not all in oh God help me Jesus described people like this as they honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me there's some people and their heart is not in this message sometimes even intending a message church only God knows where your heart is and he does know where your heart is but if you were to unveil it and peel back layers you see their lips are complementary and saying all the right things they need to see maybe they grew up in the message they know how to say all the right things in the message language but their heart is way far away from their heart being in this thing so I would encourage you it's manifesting time if you love the Lord get your heart where your mouth is it's time to get your heart where your mouth is don't be a pretender don't be a message believer just by wearing the right dress get your heart in this thing put your money where your mouth is I think that's a statement put your heart where your mouth is stop complimenting it and pretending and your heart if you were is not I just encourage you through a just a convicting thought this morning make sure your heart is in this thing I can't I can't take you in a Rapture on my coattail I can preach the word I can lead you into it but don't don't let your heart be if it were true your heart's away I I'm not believing this thing that's something to really hit the Altar and pray about I can't do that for you but Jesus said there are people whose lips honor me but because he can see that my their heart is far from Christ the word so he goes on to say and I'm finishing this up now he said it would be here here it is we got his answer we have Satan's answer God is vindicating himself God has proved himself to his promise in this day Hallelujah the headship is here amen Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was how many believe that today Christ is here with the same power as his resurrection that ever was before it's here now manifesting himself there's the devil's answer is there another one there no okay I'm done so he keeps you see both those statements keep popping up in Christ's mystery this is what Satan's howling at this is the answer to the devil's question this is what he's angry at this is the answer to the devil's question we have the answer to the devil's question it's possible that he in his anger is bringing questions and raising doubts and questions for you I wonder if that's the only thing and weapon that Satan has left just thinking out loud in front of a hundred and 20 people I wonder if he's getting more angry and the only thing is left to do is to raise questions that's his weapon is this real is this of man are you really the bride is this really him is this message to manifest Christ in the last days is it really we have the answer not because we say it but because we live in it the head the Holy Ghost is flowing through the body doing the same works and she stands unmovable in that Revelation that is him yes it's him if I were to answer the devil's question yes this is him this is not a man this is not William Bradham this is him Christ Our Lord doing this work by the Holy Ghost he is the head Satan this is your answer yes it is him he is the head here he is proving himself we are responding by saying the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself that might need to be your answer tomorrow morning when he fights you it's pretty long but I can say it again our response is to say the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself if the devil's question is is it really him yes it is this is him you're in trouble devil you know it's manifesting time what's in people is spilling out sometimes after 20 30 years things come out you never realize we're there the confession of their mouth is one thing but their heart is far from this message then it comes out what they are and all the words the world it's a coming out like all the perverts and coming out but there's another thing coming out manifested sons of God and they're saying Satan we're not bowing we're not bending and we're not burning like the Hebrew children I'm not going to bend I'm not going to Bow and I'm not going to burn I'm not going to stop praying even though I'm intimidated the prayers don't work somebody can I say this quote without it a a shallow person they would lose faith in this but I'm only quoting because a prophet who watched hundreds of thousands of Miracles and God manifest himself he said if I prayed for 20 000 people and they didn't get well they died the next morning he said I'd go back the next night and pray for another 20 000 people because this is not my word this is his word and my duty is to believe it is that a I can you can only say that to mature Believers because majorably mature Believers are saying to Satan listen I'm here for the duration of this thing I'm applying my faith that all things are possible with God I'm not going to believe the doctor's report I'm going to believe his report that's my duty I stand in his army I'm not wishy-washy that if he doesn't answer my prayer then I I may question this entire message no no no I'm here to stay whatever God does whatever is will but I believe he's able to heal the worst cancer I believe he's able to do what he said he would do that's my stance I'm not moving I'm not changing this is where I stand and the devil's going to know it every day I'm not going to stop praying I'm not going to stop believing I'm not going to be wishy-washy I'm not going to exit the very life of this word because some prayer may look like it doesn't get answered I love that lyric just get ready to sing that with my daughter Gabby I love you more by The Isaacs and it says it's not your fault Lord I won't blame you even though to me it looks like you didn't come through you must have known that I would get closer to you through this and the course says through it all I love you more now he doesn't always give us what we want but if it brings us to a deeper love for him he loves that is that okay to say to mature Believers this morning now in Jerusalem when these people gathered and the Persian king had given permission to Ezra and Nehemiah to go and rebuild the Temple and also rebuild the walls a Persian king release them and let them go back and to be able to build it and when they came back you know they realized you realize there was people there that didn't go down to Babylon there was a mixture of people there in Jerusalem there's such a mixture of all kinds of people once they got there for this final work of building the Temple rebuilding it rebuilding the walls uh the Heathen was there and some Jews that were there mixed with the Heathen they let their kids marry heathens and so because when you mix marriages like that you have a lot of different influences you have a lot of different mixed things the Jews that mixed with the other nations that were there and some of them worshiped Jehovah God but some of them were mixed up in idolatry so it was just a mixture but in the middle of all this in Jerusalem now was this people understorable under Ezra and under Nehemiah that caught the vision of this rebuilding and caught the vision that this God's behind this and the Persian king has given us permission to come back even help them a little bit financially to go back and read build the temple talk about God being in charge of worldly Kings it's like brother Ron said they're I think Saturday night it's not the presidents that control Our Lives it's not even them controlling their own lives it's God that's controlling what's going on praise the Lord and and so uh they had influences there but you see now these people caught the vision of God and this King had sent them back rebuild the Temple rebuilding the temple has to do with this restoration of Malachi 4 5 and 6 that in the end time I'll restore the faith and Pentecost I'll restore the truths that were lost I restore the faith that's in the people I restore them back to Pentecost again in the end time under Malachi 4 who was a a type of a a a zerubbabel zoruba was the type of Malachi four five and six in the rebuilding he'd come back and bring the word back to the people bring the true experience of the baptism the Holy Ghost back to the people again they would be restored that's the rebuilding of the temple today because we are his dimple we are his Stones can you say them out so now this rebuilding is that and there's only a small amount of people caught the vision of why we go to church cultivision of Why We Gather cultivision of why we're here but others didn't catch it and guess what the other ones that didn't catch it are going to start persecuting now and getting angry at those that are starting to rebuild the Temple and build these walls there's an increased anger and there's really no explanation why they got angry if there's Jews there even if they're mixed they actually should be rejoicing that the work of rebuilding the temple they should be shouting and rejoicing just like all the rest it's strange why are they becoming angry at their brothers building the work of the Lord I don't have the answer to that except for Satan always gets upset of the promised word of the age and to rebuild that Temple was the promised word of the age and Satan always is mad at that so they begin working by the vision and by what God told them to do they said this is God's Temple and and so now but but we must go deeper than just the temple we must build the walls I got a little sermon on that is that the finished work is not just the temple was rebuilt and the faith is restored back to Pentecost but the walls are the protection in place David said it when he repented Lord God forgive me apply the hyssop to my life his adultery that he did it's in Psalms where he repents I forget the psalm now but he repents and in his repentance the last thing he says he says build the walls of Jerusalem so it's not just being forgiven it's not just being restored it's not just coming from the world and your life being changed and you become a temple of God by the Holy Ghost but the final stage is him saying Lord build the walls of Jerusalem if you had a city and a temple without any walls the enemy could try to get in so when Christians go deeper in their lives they're not just have they don't just have the Holy Ghost they're not just a temple of the Holy Ghost but they say God let me go deeper and let me build walls of protection that the devil doesn't know how to get in that's where you find this Prophet saying that I'm so glad a man can live so close to God the desert devil doesn't know how to get in and doesn't have a place to get in so the walls were important and that this is the final stages let's build the walls let's do this they caught the final Vision let's go deeper I don't know what you're doing but the people of God say I want to go deeper take me deeper not everybody had that vision that did not stir some people up like it stirred some of the Believers up some were adversaries and guess what they never give a reason why they're becoming angry and adversary to it they were just the first thing they did is they began to mock it they begin to mock the people of God and they said lies against it the people of God had to work in the middle of being mocked and put down so I'm bringing this to a close in a minute what's our response to this anger because if you haven't experienced it yet then I say to you maybe you're not living close enough to the Lord because if you're really saying Lord I want to be filled with the spirit every day and I want to be living close to you get ready now some years I'm running off I don't want to do that but there's got to be reasons for that if you're living and standing for this message not the Intel not intellectually but by the whole ghost we're standing and we're believing this is Christ's headship returned to us get ready I can't believe it hasn't happened to you yet I can ask her to show hands but the devil's anger is increasing against me he's trying to strike my family he's trying to strike he's taken a final swing but I'm not afraid so they're mocking the people of God number two notice they never formed an army and fought against samblet and tobiah it just kept building oh there's an army being formed we got to they did get their swords together for protection but it's not they say we're going to go off of the building now and we're going to start fighting they didn't even do that they just kept building God will fight our battles God will step in for us and that's what he did they they stopped they said we're not going to do it it was just a threat isn't that like the Devil he's just a threat it's just to scare you I'm gonna do this if you keep going this way I'm going to do this but yet you got a bigger God that steps in and says no you're not going to do that Hallelujah vengeance is mine saith the Lord leave the Vengeance to him as our brother preached last Sunday this is a time of war and God has an Armory and he'll pull out all the weapons he needs and you might be one of those weapons if he needs you be available to him God you're pulling on me to be faith for someone else who needs Faith I'll be that weapon that you pull out and use but God is a man of war and you our captain is the Lord if he asks us to fight that's one thing but ultimately if Satan starts to gloat if Satan starts to threaten if he starts to make you afraid then that's really all he wants to do is to make you afraid but we should not be afraid you you should say Satan God is my captain of this Army and if you're having trouble with me then your habit you're going to get in trouble with my God glory be to God your problem is it with me Satan you you touched me you touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm God said don't touch my anointed or I'll step in I've removed armies I've opened up Red Seas I've done what I have to do because he says don't touch my anointed you don't have to fight the battle yourself brother and sister this morning we're not fighting alone we have a captain and you know they didn't form an army and fight against Samuel they just kept building they kept focused I think that's nice simple answer to you today just stay focused on the word of God stay in it every day become a prayer Warrior say well I don't have a position in the church let me give you a position become a prayer Warrior like brother Jim back here and sister Julie I know they are I couldn't I've got about I don't know I I know a lot of you pray for me but there's some prayer warriors that know how to bombard heaven and I could not make it keep him preaching unless I had them behind me say I don't have a position why don't you become a silent prayer Warrior and know how to bombard heaven greatest position you take and there's some there's some opportunities available there's some slots open because we're going to need more prayer with what's coming up than ever before what do you need in the church brother Paul you need somebody to wash the toilets well we might but we need Holy Ghost filled prayer warriors more than anything else [Applause] I need people to stop worrying about the fusses in the church I need people to get filled with the spirit and get ready for what's coming ahead that's what we need in the church Hallelujah they stayed focused they they just dealt there with that contrary spirit always laying there it's always there it always will be there at contrary Spirit but stay focused on the work of the Lord samblet means sin and tobiah means Jehovah is good which is really strange samblet means sin and tobiah means Jehovah is good these two influences con are contrary to the deeper walk of the Lord in you sin is your is contrary and someone who just wants to see Jehovah as a good God not a God of War not a god of overcoming but just a good God brother Paul why can't you just I bring visitors here why can't you just be nice he's a good God just preach the good things he is a good god I believe that but he's a man of war he's a man of Justice he's a man that tells the truth Christ is one who tells us Christ is the very essence of Truth so if you get around Christ you're going to hear truth might take the very height off you but you're going to hear truth not just that he's a good God you're a good boy you're a good little boy you're okay everybody's they're doing you wrong you're a victim of everybody I'm not going to continue to make you a victim because victims victims that are getting the Holy Ghost are rising above victimhood today is that anybody can do anything they want you that's their problem I'm going to go on serving the lord I will not encourage your victim ism the government will but Christ doesn't I've been done wrong by every church I've been to brother Paul and I'm thinking this one's going to do me wrong just like all the rest of them victim time to grow up trying to become a warrior time to get back on building the kingdom and the walls and this finishing work there's so much to do for the kingdom of God and that's why these fusses even around our ranks and in the message and who the greatest preacher is and all the greatest revivals just I want to stay out of it because I got a work to do here we got something to do here you've got something to do quit getting online and doing all the fusses there's a work to do here I'm not going to have a two-hour conversation with somebody who's trying to to to to de-establish everything that's in me saying amen and try to de-establish that I've got too much to do for the kingdom to do that I respect you I'll shake your hand I respect you whatever you want to believe that's fine because I have a right to believe whatever I believe but don't waste my time when I know there's good things to do for the kingdom of God trying to find the reason why tobiah and Sam Billet were contrary as Samuel and Tobias had positions maybe maybe they were jealous that the king never gave them positions in this I don't know why they were so angry but they were grieved that someone was seeking the welfare of the Jews maybe they could have been jealous could be they were not put in charge of it and Samuel and tobiah why didn't this King who's our King put us in charge of this work maybe they were jealous of that we were not informed maybe they were mad because I was not informed of this myself we didn't vote on that I don't know but they got the angry of the devil against the wrong people the people that are trying to do the final work of the Lord you can be angry at a lot of people but don't be angry at those don't be angry at the preachers that preached the clear gospel in the message and with without holding back that's not the person to make your children angry at everybody listening this morning he's not your enemy he's your friend I'm not your enemy I'm your friend I'm not perfect I don't do everything just right and I don't make all the administrative decisions that you may agree with I'm sorry about that but there's a bigger calling there's a bigger office here can you say man and if you if you respect it brother Brown says God's ordained for that Pastor to lead you through to the other side so the office is that you don't want to make that office and the leadership of that church and everybody your enemy in your eyes of your children you don't want to do that there's a lot of people to warn them against but it's not the True Church of God be angry at something else be angry at the Devil these are not in my notes it's just my heart they could have been jealous the facts are if you develop a resentment and brother Stephen preached on that last year last week brother Steve Caruso mentioned resentment and bitterness if you develop a resentment no matter how right you are you keep that resentment and bitterness you're on your way out God can't bless you if you're filled with resentment and bitterness and wrath and wrath and anger and built up God can't use you for the work of the Lord so they became Roth at this work of God they misread what was being done so they laughed at them they pronounced doom on that they they said they will go no farther this isn't this is nothing this is a cult movement it's all going to fizzle out and their response was from Nehemiah listen this is God's work if it is God's work he will prosper it if it's not God's work it won't if you're called to this and you have a part in it that's fine otherwise leave us alone let us build his response was not the same as they were dishing out mocking slinging mud back at them defending themselves it doesn't do any good to fight argument with argument it doesn't do any good to sling mud to the ones who are singing mud at you what Nehemiah said listen if you don't call to this that's fine God bless you we'll be brothers Sling all the money you want but I'm not going to sling mud back at you I'm not going to defend myself God has given me my commission can you say Amen there's a work of God to do and we want to do it leave us alone and let us do this work can you say Amen this morning the next time they said nothing back to them and you have to read this in the story I read most of it you just read these these efforts to to be angry and to stop the work of God the next time they made an effort nothing was said back Nehemiah said we're just going to pray and sometimes that's what that's how you respond there is no response I'm I'm going to pray has everybody learned that today you got to have faith in your prayer brother and sister the effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much and then then the prophet said well you feel unworthy to pray well Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he was really like us as a human but God heard his prayer so righteousness is not based upon your righteousness that I that I haven't made any mistakes so I have a right to pray pray for anyone no no it's it's that your righteousness is in what he did for you at the cross it's in Christ and so with that you are worthy you do have a right to pray you do have a right for ask for anything no matter how high it is you have a right to ask for it don't underestimate the power of your prayer before the Lord the effectual fervent prayer Avail as much can you saith man amen and so now we see then that we're gonna uh form an Harmony and their response was to protect but not to fight back I got to get through this now I realize I'm going over time to protect with a sword in one hand but not the building in another hand why did they do that because I think it's wrong to let someone try to destroy what God has built in you refuse to let the adversary destroy what he's built in you and me we will not let them bring our spirit down with guilt and mocking or their anger can you say Amen that this in me is not destructible because God put it in me I'm not uh I'm not in a cult someone that says that it's just a crazy conclusion so you protect yourself from those voices with a sword in one hand and building this this temple in another hand this walls but if you spend hours forming a fight against them then the building stops the finishing work stops the work of the Lord stops let's stay on the work of the Lord can you say Amen let's not let anything distract us from the work of the Lord the last effort I don't know if you read your Bible I didn't read it this morning but it's in there the last effort they gave to come against the work of the Lord was they called Nehemiah samuelit and Nehemiah and said could we get together in the village and I like the word this way can we just have a coffee and talk try every means I mean this is the same guy who was putting together an army to fight against them this is the same guy that mocked him him and Tobi the same guy who gossiped against them the same one now says can we have coffee and just talk you know what Nehemiah said no we can't people get quiet but I've had to tell some people sometimes it seems impolite say you know I'd love to fellowship around the word but when the motive is there and I can see it Nehemiah said I'll read it to you no I won't be able to go he says oh I'm in Revelations and not Nehemiah you got to hear his response to this he says samblet and geisham said unto him saying come and let us meet together in some one of these Villages at Starbucks let's meet at Starbucks and just discuss this now this is the same guy that wanted to destroy you let's have a coffee at Starbucks it doesn't say that but they thought but they thought to do me Mischief so now he's calling it mischief and I sent Messengers to them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down to Starbucks [Applause] why should the work cease while I leave it and come to Starbucks with you that seems harsh that seems but listen if someone's got a sincere heart and want a fellowship around the world and sincere questions I'm all there but when there's a track record that shows listen I'm not going to be drawn away from the work of the Lord and people's lives that I need to pour myself into yet they sent unto me four times an invitation to Starbucks and I answered them after the same manner the devil is becoming more and more angry and when he they have the swords and God backed them off and the people of God had the swords they kept working on the Lord he got more angry and said they're not going to stop they're not going to stop doing what they're doing and he became more festering and more angry or angry until he tried other means and everything and as I said at the beginning after a while you have to say this is not a problem with me as much as it is it's a problem with their anger and they need to resolve their anger if you have anger this morning you better resolve your anger you better bring that to the to the cross because the devil will use that he'll take his anger with your anger and it's not good so we release it forgive we let it go because I want to be doing the work of the Lord I don't want to spend my whole life in anger I don't want to spend my whole life participating in coming against the word of God I want to be the ones that's in the army of God identifying myself I'm all in I'm part of the army of the Lord I'm part of the solution not the problem part of the solution and part of the Kingdom I'm part of what God's trying to achieve here I want to be a part of that the old lady she's at the end of the line with all the soldiers with their guns and he the the the commander comes down and sees them all perfect in order and Grandma's down Grandma's down at the end with her broom and her dress and at the end with her broom and standing at attention like the rest of the soldiers what are you doing here you can't fight with these men you can't do that I know but I just wanted to let all you know whose side I'm on amen sometimes you can't tell which side people are on but we ought to make a bold statement whose side we're on I'm on the Lord's Side I'm for the work of the Lord we're finishing this work brother Wallace we're finishing this work didn't Jesus say it my meat is to finish the work of the Lord that he gave me to do and I'm going to here to finish the job I like what brother Tim Pruitt said Friday night he was talking about the building all these other things and the dedication of that building and we're the temples of God wonderful message and he says he says Saints he said God gave us this work to finish then let's finish it let's finish this work let's get it done can you say man praise be to God our response to Satan's anger is that I'm going to keep praying our response to Satan's anger is that I'm going to keep loving our response to Satan's anger is not more anger but our response that I believe this message with all my heart our response to Satan's anger is to say I don't have time to spend countless hours doubting this message I've got a work to do here and I'm going to stay on the wall I'm going to keep building I'm going to keep praying my children onto the Holy Ghost I'm going to keep loving can you say Amen I'm going to keep applying the token I'm going to keep him in the word of God I'm going to grab my Bible every day and read my Bible and pray because the prophet said you want to get closer to God read my Bible and pray my response to Satan's anger is that I'm going to be in the word more and in my phone less Hallelujah my response to the devil's anger is I'm going to be on the in the word more instead of on my computer more that's my response to the devil I'm going to participate in good Fellowship positive Fellowship instead of the wrong kind that's my response to Satan's anger and to say he gave me this revelation Satan can't take it away he gave me this and Satan can't take it away I don't know where you feel you are today in the Lord but I'm going to give that most of you are sitting here because something has been deposited in your heart that you know had to come from God you may not feel like you're all where you need to be but if you can say that something is in your heart that's come from God and not yourself and he deposited in there even it was 20 years ago even it was the last week if you can say that then you have enough response to the devil to say you didn't give that to me and Satan you can't take it away amen come on brother Kenny you didn't give it to me and you can't take it away and what God has joined together let no man put asunder this Union this headship and this bride in this body is a work of the Lord you know what it says later in Nehemiah even sambalit and tobiah and the enemies come back later and said they said this they had to confess this is a work that's been wrought in God they said that and one day even the enemy is going to testify I was fighting against the wrong thing because this was not wrought in those people this wasn't me this isn't brother branham's message this was a work wrought in God and it's proved it you say Vindication it's been Vindicated but the final Vindication is coming more and more and the Bible says someday every knee shall bow and every tongue will have to confess that Jesus is Lord every one of them they had to say this work was wrought in God read it this week in your Bible it's wonderful to see that the enemy will someday have to testify this is not wrought in God I've got a revelation of predestination I've got a revelation God is my father sister Sharon wrote this song years ago I've got a rest let's Stand Together Worship the Lord [Music] got a revelation God is my father [Music] I know where I came from tells me where I'm going and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail again well [Music] all right [Music] God is my father tells me where I'm going and the gates of hell can never Prevail again well I've got a rest congratulations [Music] [Applause] God is my father oh yes he is [Music] in hell can never be there again [Music] please [Applause] Satan can't move a man with a true revelation I like that brother sister Wallace here look at their lives and faithful faithful since before I was born faithful to the Lord they know what the power of the Holy Ghost can do no they know what a Believer surrendered to the Lord what it means and the devil today would like to say well the the day has changed it's a different time different age you know modern no no no no Holy Ghost is still the same someone filled with it acts the same way and they're going to come to adoption they're going to come to their place and that's the person the devil is afraid of that's the young person the devil's afraid of he's not afraid of you for anything he's afraid when you get filled with the spirit of God before we pray today you have to look at your life and say God knows exactly where I'm at right now if my heart is far from him God knows that if your heart is close it doesn't matter where you're at what you've been through you have to rest and start here God knows where I'm at but he also knows where to get me from where where I'm at to the next place so that I love him more I may believe that today how many believe God knows where you're at and he doesn't condemn you where you're at he convicts you probably a lot of you felt conviction today but he doesn't condemn you but he knows where you're at okay he knows if there's bitterness whatever he knows but he also how many raisins he knows how to get me from where I'm at to being closer to him if you know that you can
