========================================

other tonight and uh we're gonna start at verse 51 and i think that yes yeah this is the one all right luke 9 or verse 51. everybody have it i think everybody has it before i have it and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and just consume them even as elias did but he turned and rebuked to james and john and said you know not what manner of spirits you are of for the son of man is not come to destroy men's life but to save them and they went into another village amen may god bless the reading of his word tonight god bless you may be seated i want to speak a little bit tonight on what sons do with authority and clearly these guys here these these brothers will call them but they're certainly not fully acting right here james and john clearly these guys are not ready to handle the authority of god and and yet they're with jesus they're disciples of jesus they're around the message they're around the son of man they've been around him for several years now but they are clearly and they are sons can you say amen they're sons of god have all the potential sons of god have all the access to all that they will be become but in this incident they prove that they're clearly not ready to handle the authority of god the right way but they are sons can you say man and the positive thing that i can say tonight is that we can go ahead and read at the end of our bible we can read the book of james and we can read the book of john they actually must god must have really worked on them because they were allowed to write a book that's in the bible can you say man so that's that's the thing of sons you know it's just like we we have our struggles and god has to teach us and child train us and we're not ready for certain things and we go through all kinds of stuff but the positive thing is we can look ahead now and we can read in our bibles men who acted that way but they wrote some wonderful things in the book of james and incidentally this guy that wanted to call fire down from heaven and consume the whole thing like elijah john if you read the book of john he's all about brothers let us love one another something happened to john some change took place in john some the immaturity that john had god dealt with the immaturity and he was able to write better than anybody in the scripture about the love of god so i want to speak tonight just a little bit on what sons will do with authorities what sons do with authority and there have been several days in study uh for the men's meeting and uh we're speaking in this uh speaking in the setting of the men's meeting is a privilege it's i feel honored to do it in some ways i don't want to do it i'd rather go listen to the good things of god but in speaking for it it's a real privilege we have just hundreds of men there that come and you can speak on the subjects uh related to men and what's been in our hearts is authority the subject of authority and there are many elements to authority but tonight i just thought i'd taken a segment of it that we'll speak on this weekend a little bit just a little portion of it but there are many things to talk about in relation to authority the bible's full of it our subjection to authority our subjection to god's headship our obedience to delegated authority because god delegates his authority his authority to certain men and so when you subject yourself and uh be obedient to god's men you're not being obedient to the man it's not about the man but god's authority in the man and you know about that and then there's a whole thing we'll talk a little bit about tonight that that is the authority that we have brother graham says the church doesn't realize the authority but god has given the church the authority all the way from pentecost can you say amen and you shall receive power after which the holy ghost has come upon you and so he gave peter the keys to the kingdom so god is handing it and all of this handing of authority to sons we know that it climaxes at the end time because we find the final move of god in this last day is actually to give back to sons all of the inheritance and all of the position that they fell from in the garden of eden this last climatic uh portion of the word that we're in we've had a lot of good days we've had pentecost we have seven church ages we've had a move of god we've had healing signs wonders we have we still have that happening but the final climatic time that god is doing is to hand back the full inheritance to you as sons and daughters of god the book of redemption held our inheritance he took the seals off it he threw it down to earth to his prophet that was on earth he spoke it but that wasn't the last thing he did he spoke it so the sons of god could take that book back again that's the hour you live in this is the time that we live in can you say amen he's putting his life and his authority back in his sons and daughters again it's pretty exciting i said it's pretty exciting the work that's going on every day in your lives it's pretty exciting the work that's going on you always look at the other guy said man it seems like they're all excited and things are going good for them it's pretty exciting the work that's going on in your life and you may go through stubborn times but if your son you're going to come out of that and the overall work that's going on is god's giving you back your authority god's given you back your inheritance that you lost in the garden pretty exciting work that's going on every time we gather together have church it's pretty exciting what's happening on wednesday nights like this it's pretty exciting you think this is a regular service this is not a regular there is no regular services when god's handing back his inheritance to his people you as sons you as daughters there is no boring service there is no in between filler services every time we meet every time we open the bible every time we get in the message every time we commune with him god is handing his book of redemption back to the people it's pretty exciting i don't know what you feel about yourself tonight but it doesn't matter how you feel about yourself it's what the word said about you if you still this see this thing is just a little movement that just follows the teachings of william branham you need your eyes open because that's that's that's not what this is a little movement that follows the teachings of william branham that's not whether you need your eyes open you need to know he's bringing sons to glory he's giving back authority he broke off the seals he handed the pro handed him to the prophet on earth a book in order to give the book back to his sons in the end time and that's exactly what he's doing and when he gives that back it's the same as christ was when he said i put my life and i put my authority he said it in john chapter 5 i put my life all my life is in my son and then the next is and all of my authority is in my son and he didn't just do it with jesus christ jesus christ was the firstborn of men among many brethren he didn't just give the authority but to jesus christ but he gives it back to all of his sons it climax at the end where he brings it so so as as he proclaims and the prophet comes to this in christ the mystery especially that message he begins to proclaim in christ the mystery that the headship is coming down and when you talk about headship you talk about authority you talk about the head and we know we've had heads we've had corporations we have had denominational heads we've had all kinds of man's type of headship and authority that rules but in this this is the hit this is the true head this is christ's the head descending and coming to his body and that's what's happening with the seals revealed is christ the mystery of god revealed he the head comes down to unite with the body if the threefold purpose of god that he would reveal himself to man number one and i only go back to qualify these things because there's some new ones who don't know this in christ the mystery god had a threefold purpose in all of the bible you see this is the entire purpose of god all of the all of the parables all of the stories in the old testament that you heard in sunday school all of the bible speaks of a threefold purpose of god that he would reveal himself to man number one that he would get the preeminence in his people number two and then he would take them back to eden again as sons and daughters adam and eve back again the book of the book of redemption it's a it's a work of redemption so you know to have the preeminence that's the thing and so sons are glad to come under this true headship sons are glad to do it now that's when you have good leadership and good authority is when people are glad to come underneath it when you have the wrong type of authority people are hesitant even though they're forced to come underneath it there's nothing better than have a compliant child and i know some of you haven't had them all mine were perfect but none some of yours had problems all mine were perfectly compliant and everybody's laughing but you know there's a scripture in proverbs it's wonderful it talks about the the vision and he says when a father corrects his son happy is he and he's it's like i'm reading him going where does that come from when he corrects the son happy is he that's the response you get but when when things are right and there's a reverence for the right kind of leadership and authority then there's a response that's a correct subjection because it's not forced and so you can see how important so now when this headship comes of christ we have no problem seeing that this is the who true headship we've been looking for so the sons of god are happy the daughters of god are happy to come under that true headship and to blend with that but it's not a headship like the world where it's just the subjects you're just subjects and you're nothing more you just obey and the authority has his thumb on you that's not the authority of god that you're detached as a subject and you're under the authority of the land a dictatorship and you just subject yourself and you have no part in it that's not the authority of god this headship comes and becomes one with the body can you say amen and so becomes one that every bit of the life and authority comes down and is in the subjects can you say a man the same authority comes and make causes us to have authority to rule and reign so uh this is not in the quotes i sent you guys but this is quickly what he says in christ the mystery now you might have it there then we are united under one vindicated headship that is christ the word not under any church then our headship now notice i just i just pulled something out because i can't read all the quotes i want to we are united under one vindicated headship and that is christ the word 1963 after the seals are preached our are full the word has come christ has come and we're coming under no we're not on any any church listen to this now then our headship is a kingdom that's the first thing that i read and said this is not like the authority and headship of the world our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you said the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination not even denominational churches that have a headship in christianity reflect the true headship that god intended if you're a denominational here tonight i'm not speaking against you i'm telling you the entire denominational headship system that started with the mother church and continues today is completely contrary to the word of god and true headship our headship is christ the word and we find then an organized religion and organized systems build a headship well we see we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life he's talking about headship he's talking about authority he's talking about the head coming down and he's saying it's a kingdom and he says you know what it does the spirit and life of the king come into the queen and this kingdom lives out in your own life what kind of headship is this what kind of authority is this that we're under what kind of umbrella and by the way being under his authority is the greatest protection for you and your family you can have can i get an amen this authority is the greatest protection and safety place that you can have for you and your family it is an umbrella of the ultimate protection in this hour god's authority is not a dictatorship it's a protection but it's also a kingdom that the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in the day as it did in the day when the word and god was one he's pointing back to jesus the word becoming one with god they were one i and my father are one as it did in the day when they become one this is the same thing that happens under this headship the body unites with the head coming down and they become one and now it feeds into that body sons and daughters every bit of life and every bit of authority that god has begins to flow through the queen we have his authority tonight you hold his authority sometimes we don't recognize what we have so in in um in my studying this now i have found i found many things but i found something i wanted to bring up tonight god puts this in his sons when they don't even have the maturity yet to use it right that's amazing thing to me because things don't normally work that way god doesn't say he don't wait and say when you're perfect when you're fully matured then i'll pour my life and my authority into you but it didn't happen that way with jesus and it doesn't happen that way with sons of god i'm one that believes that we receive the spirit of adoption and that spirit takes us to full mature adoption you won't hear that from all the ministers but that's just the way i believe it because the whole subject of adoption means growth to maturity can you say amen and so you receive the spirit of adoption you have all the potentials through the holy ghost to become a fully matured son raptured can you say amen but at the moment of birth you have the potential of it but you're not that yet so now comes this child training might take five years might take two years some of us went on to be with the lord some of the people went on to be the lord they got their victory in divine love a lot sooner and we thought god took them god that's it you won the victory in divine love he took them for the rest of us we're not done yet we're still here that means you still need some work on you you're still here so it's best you just come to the altar and say lord here i am finish your work in me because i want to get out of here amen so he don't say when you are perfect then you i will put this into you now no he says john says now are we the sons of god and it does not appear what we shall be but when he shall appear we shall appear with him in glory so these things that that's why we're able to see this great thing this headship come to us but also as we see this great thing has come to us and i'm naming you know in the 60s 1963 i'm naming years because we see the unfolding of spiritual prophecy the prophecy in revelations how it all transpired how he would look open the lamb's book of life through the vessel that he would begin to do it and just these different things that's all history now and that points to revelations 10 1 the mighty angel coming down our great head christ descending the word the lion whatever you want to call it he's now come down to become one with his people the capstone uniting with the rest of the body and all this begins to happen this great thing comes to us but also we watch in the years since it's come great immaturity in using his authority the wrong way can i get an amen here it comes to us and we've had to observe not only in our own lives but in preachers lives and many different facets within our ranks great immaturity in handling this word great immaturity in handling the authority of this word and people using the sword on one another instead of the devil and people like james and john who says we've got the authority let's call fire down from heaven and burn them all up well there's a real christ-like spirit on you boy i'm being sarcastic because jesus themselves are boys boys you don't even know what kind of spirit you have on your way now it's terrible let the authority come down and just burn them all out like elijah let's have the authority of elijah and that's it's all sons but immature not ready to use the authority of god everybody with me so we watch years now and i can be honest tonight just my home church but we watch years of this immaturity but you see then that that even jesus even jesus who was the perfect son of god when he was in this days of the flesh the bible says jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered so even jesus himself with the full authority and life of god had to go through a process of learning if jesus the perfect son of god had to go through a maturing or a learning process then certainly we do here tonight in order to not have it's not about having authority in order to use the authority in the channel that god wants it used in order to use it the right way can you say amen and uh brother branham referred to it this way and you don't have this quote up there but brother brown referred to he says could you imagine this building here being energized tonight for light by electricity so this is so this we have power in here tonight and uh we have a power source that brings in but the power source has been made that it can get to these lights and bring light now that was a process can you say man that took a process and so brother brown comments and i just want to use it the way he says it electricity is an unseen force you can't see the power behind it you can't see the authority behind it when it's harnessed and brought on he said i like this when benjamin franklin first found it he screamed and said i've got it i've got it but brother bram says but he didn't know what he had praise the lord and and i'm bringing this to show you god can bring his authority to his people and they're they're they're shouting saying we've got it we've got it i wonder how many message conventions through the years where people have shouted we've got it we've got it we've got it but they don't really know what they have yet and they certainly don't know what channel to put it in for god to use it effectively i mean it's not a thing wrong with shouting and rejoicing what god has given us and the authority that we have it's kind of like i was talking to this with my boys last night it's kind of like when brother brown says don't live don't shout any higher don't jump any higher than the way you live shout all you want to dance all you want to get excited stimulated by the word of god but if you're not living the life it doesn't matter how high you shout doesn't matter how high you dance and he says you pentecostals he said he said i love it he says i have nothing against it but he says you see him to take all of this and you just blow the steam out in one service you just blow it all out but he said if you could ever harness that and get that power of the holy ghost channeled into a sanctified life channeled into a life every day so that you may shout on sunday but on monday you know how to take the sword to the enemy that's the problem we have with a great emotional workup is that people don't know how to go against the enemy when they're on temptation on monday morning so he says benjamin franklin he says screamed and said i've got it i've got it but he didn't know what he had he had something but he didn't know what he had but along came edison and edison took it and put it to work notice that transition i don't even know the history i didn't have time to read it today but i'm intrigued i'll read it i'll get my book out and read you know how did this transpire i don't know how many years it was past one saying i've got something here i've got it i got it i don't really know what i have i don't have it harnessed yet but another one comes along and he harnesses it he puts it in a certain channel man did it ever become effective because all of us live on it the last week when we lost ours for 12 or 15 hours boy this boy felt not this boy felt it not having power for my refrigerators and uh boy i tell you we depend on it a lot right it's because somebody some somebody harnessed the power or else the power would just been there but somebody harnessed it so we can flip a switch on actually do it from our phones now my wife can control the temperature at our rental property on her phone so so somebody's harnessed this power it's a natural type of the spiritual you can't just say i've got the holy ghost let me see it how it's channeled in your life against the enemy let me see it how it makes you love your brother let me see how it continues to sanctify your life can i get an amen tonight you can't just say i got it i got it i got it and shout and sing sing i've got it i've got it there's something about the power of the holy ghost and i've got it i can't explain it but i've got it that's great praise the lord but what you've got you've got to take harness and channel it into an overcoming life praise be to god amen can you say amen so we have something god the headship comes down but you can have it but it's not channel right it's not harness and if it's not harnessed right it's misused as james and john had authority but had not learned what to use the authority for they personally were not harnessed yet that's what we find when brother branham preached the message paul a prisoner how many remember that message you know there are some messages of brother branham that are not doctrinal messages there's some that are doctrinal there's some that are revealing of truth especially after the seals opened there was a bursting forth of restored truth and truths that we had lost and truth some ways we didn't even know that we're laying in the bible and it just bursts and so he goes there christ the mystery god revealed anointed ones at the end time we didn't know we didn't know that the scripture proclaimed that the rain falls on the just and then just and that someone could be anointed by the genuine holy ghost and be a false vessel so god had to reveal these things and he goes and he's into satan's eden and he's in the god of this evil age these are doctrinal biblical things that the bride the sons of god needed to know can you say amen but not all the messages after the seals are doctrinal sermons some of them i believe are teaching sons the channel that we put our lives in to see this authority work in our lives and paul a prisoner is one of them because that's when he used the word harnessed paul was a prisoner and paul was harnessed to what the will of god in other words it was about god's will and it was it was about denying paul denying his own will and all paul denying the will of other men and that we didn't know it but we become free in jesus christ but to use the authority of god and all this message has given us we become prisoners to our own will prisoners to the will of other people prisoners harnessed bound in chains of love he said that's right i said god i am i'm given my life and you become that's why he said that electricity electricity becomes harnessed the vessels of god become harnessed they become into a channel they become and you don't need to look any further than jesus christ himself in john chapter 5 when it says jesus christ after he said he put the life and the authority into jesus i have put it in my son then we find can i read it a minute can i i'm i'm i don't want to just quote it john chapter 5. look at this verse 25. verily realize saying to you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they shall hear his voice for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to his son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel nodded this for the hour is coming in the which that all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth and they that have done good unto the resurrection of the life and they have done evil under the resurrection of damnation verse 30. this is what jesus is talking now here's now here's the vessel that god said i've put my life in him and i've put all my authority in him and here's what the vessel says i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just in other words i don't issue a discernment or a judgment call on my own i'm listening for the voice of the father to make judgment calls my decisions are so rooted in this voice and this father behind me is that i don't want to act i do nothing except the father show with me you know what you see there humility so now we see a vessel of character that matches this power that he's going to receive anybody listening tonight i won't be long so give me enough amen's here we'll wrap it up we have a character that matches the authority that he's going to hold and that character says i can do nothing of myself nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which sent me that's the vessel that god needs to exercise the authority of god he says the same thing over in in i believe it's hebrews where he says he says think it not god he thought it not robbery let this mind be in you philippians let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let this mind be in you who thought it not robbery jesus to be equal with god he it didn't he he had confidence in his position that he thought it not robbery to be equal with god he knew god had poured all of his life and authority into his vessel but here it is here's the balance now he said he thought it not robbery to be equal with god and yet made himself of no reputation humbling himself even unto the death of the cross if you do not have that mixture then you can't use the authority of god like god wants you to use it so paul a prisoner is not a doctrinal message like many others humble thyself he cares do you care i don't see him as doctrinal sermons i see it as a lot of those things as teaching sons the channel god in simplicity is the channel to come into the seals there's only one channel and there's one attitude in frame of mind and that's humility you say don't try to figure all this out with your head don't try to make something out of these seven seals come into it through the channel of humility and simplicity and don't be looking for something big look for god being hidden in simplicity that's the channel you got to come through and people you know ministers skipped over skipped over god in simplicity and jumped right to what was being revealed and if you do you miss the humility that you need to realize god we reveal himself in simplicity every time amen they skipped over it there's some things that you skip over like brother uh ben said sunday i was really convicted he read the quote he said worry has no virtue he said skip worry and go right to faith boy i got something from the lord on that i didn't know that i could just skip that part skip the worry and jump right to the faith so i'm going to try to live that better here's the worry that's the direction i go down most of the time but just skip the worry brilliant i can just skip it skip days of losing sleep skip days of worrying about something you can't get you can't get to the bottom of it just skip worry and go right to the faith amen oh that wasn't in my sermon but i sure had a good time saying it again so we got this these services and this message with glorious restored truths and especially after the seals those truths are teaching sons and opening their eyes so that they won't be deceived it's wonderful but other messages are teaching sons christ the mystery of god revealed christ is him christ coming back to the church and paul a prisoner is how he harnessed sons to his will to use the authority the right way the next quote i want to get to and i'm moving along here the original seed spoken words original seed and he's said at that part where he says pick up your pen and write this what god gives them they the bride will love him love his and will have his potentials you have that one sis they will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subject subject to his head the headship of christ was his notice what harmony jesus never did anything until he seen the father the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise up again amen then i got a great big hallelujah on his notes pick up the pen and write i wrote down hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word some of you missed that i might read it again here's the secret the word is in the bride how many believe that part and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord it's not that she says thus saith the lord or that she she speaks thus saith the lord and that's fine but it's it's not something you say as much as you have and i'm just going to say that about authority too and you brothers see authority plays out in your homes plays out in your marriages it plays out with your children every day we deal with authority do you know that every day authority is playing out in our lives but when you're looking at god's authority listen now uh she know he knows she knows what he wants done authority is not something brothers you have to defend it's something you have and i'm taking that from where he says she has thus saith the lord it's not that she boldly proclaims thus saith the lord or she speaks thus the lord or she knows all the quotes of thus saith the lord or she re-speaks it go ahead and re-speak it that's fine but it's not something you speak as much as something she has and it's the same with the authority of god it's not something that you have to defend it's not something you have to explain you either have it or you don't have it and if you have it you don't have to defend it the the the uh the uh pharisees and sadducees came to jesus and said by what authority do you do these things who can so it's here now it's the religious people that question the authority of the message the son of man well the other incident is where when they came and heard him speak they said this is different because when he speaks he speaks like one who has authority once again he has it he didn't get in there and say now i've got the authority of god friends and i'm getting ready to preach the word but just know i've got the other he never had to say that they sensed it glory be to god they knew it he speaks different than the pharisees and sadducees and guess what he was reading from the same scrolls he was reading from the same bible and somehow they sense he's different than the pharisees they're lacking something when he speaks it is there's an authority behind it and i don't believe it is how he was speaking into there he was speaking it bold isaiah said boy he speaks with such authority no no that's not it he has authority there's something they sent so when he was asked you know what jesus did when he was questioning it was the religious leaders that questioned his authority which it always is because they don't understand god's authority they don't understand god that god giving it to this simple man in front of them he didn't come through the religions he didn't come through teaching and yet where did you get your authority why do you have it where did it come from and jesus said well i get it from no he didn't answer the question he said i'll tell you if you'll answer my question and just stop i'm only you've heard that preach some i'm just making a point jesus did not ever have to explain his authority husbands mothers over children pastors and trouble comes in the church and they're scrounging for all the quotes to endorse the pastor's authority and take a series on it the pastor has full and complete authority of the church bless god and yet jesus here he don't have to answer where his authority comes from he has it and if you have it you've got the goods god will back you up oh somebody should be shouting amen so we asked him i forget the question it was about was john's baptism of god was it of men so he just caught them all and said no if we say this they're trying to reason with it and they take a few we said we can't answer that he said well i can't answer your question notice he had the answer to the devil's question brother brandt says the bride has the answer to the devil's question in christ the mystery but we don't necessarily have to say it but we have the answer to the devil's question we have it we may not always say it but we have it who gave this bride this authority who who who are you as a group of people who gave you such this i'll just have to let you watch and observe we'll see how all this ends up but i don't have to defend something that i didn't give myself god gave it to me it will defend itself can i say pray can you say praise the lord she has thus saith the lord if you guys bring it up on finishing she has thus saith the lord then it is germanized so the holy spirit waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose they do only his will amen i believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the lord or they keep still praise the lord praise the lord let's um i think we'll just wrap it up and finish this next wednesday night anybody got time next wednesday night can you come out all right let's let's pick this up next wednesday night and and do that i don't if i get into the next section here it'll be quite a bit but i i want to take time on the amazing thing to me is to see all the authority that was placed in this prophet of the last days okay he has it he has life he has authority his ministry's going around the world and yet when i read it i find incident after incident where he as a son is personally being corrected how he handles the authority of god happened back in 1946-47 and he made a a judgment call one night to do the healing line a certain way and the angel didn't talk to him i think for six months and he found out it's because the angel said i'm behind i'm behind the ministry but i didn't tell you to do the healing line that way. and then incident after incident and even up to 63 when he says and humble thyself he says you know i i feel like i just need a little change in my life i just i'm going to go to prayer this is after the seals he's got all this authority he's done all these things in his position and yet and yet it's what i'm trying to get as a man he has to grow into the maturity of a son and daughter son of god and the work that he's doing is to take now the life and authority that you have within got the holy ghost tonight you have his life and authority within you but to take sons personally and deal with them i remember when i preached about jonah you know what that was all about god taken all of his attention off of nineveh and focusing on one son to get him straightened out god will leave all these things to focus on sons and daughters on a daily basis to get you where you need to be because you got a lot within you you got a lot within your saints so that's where we want to go and i hope i can share some of my personal testimony too because when i think of brother random's life then i think of my own life you probably think of your own in my journey here i'm still here i'm so i'm still believing this i'm still going on and i'm not perfect by any means but i'll tell you what i'm only perfect by the blood of jesus christ but as a man i can give testimonies of god correcting things in my life god correcting attitudes god correcting impatience god correct i said it last sunday god correcting my worrying too much and he's going to keep working on me and keep working on me because why i already have his authority in me but at this very moment if i don't have the character i can misuse his authority so let's end by saying this if esther is a type of the bride she rose didn't the brother speak on esther sunday night i think he did she rose to this place of authority next to the king he said what do you want up to the half of my kingdom the bride rises to this place she's got full authority the question is what did she do with that authority it's not a question that you have authority what do you do with it what did you do with it you know what esther did with it the first thing she did real quick and i'm closing she said why don't you and haman come over for a banquet to my house comes over she gets a little nervous so she's a human but she's holding this authority she has it invites him a second time but i think invites him third time i can't remember just now but finally she gets the courage with the authority of god to expose her enemy in the presence of the king hallelujah that's what you should use this authority to do don't use it on somebody else don't try to call fire down from heaven at the person who said something bad on facebook about you i want you to use it for the right thing and she used it to expose she used her authority to invite him in the present and to expose her enemy you have an enemy expose him you're bound by something privately expose it in the presence of the king why don't you use your authority and your sword against what's defeating you personally in your life and take that sword and drive it to the heart of that enemy once you use authority for that and the second thing is the bible says it this way she wrote with all authority esther wrote with all authority and what did she write she wrote the redemption and the deliverance of all the jews use your authority to save somebody else and redeem somebody else and that's why jesus said james and john you're totally of the wrong spirit right now you don't even understand the authority of god you're totally out of order this is completely wrong i the son of man didn't come with this power and authority to destroy men's lives but to save men's lives there's a good thing to use your authority in you got it use it use it to help somebody speak words of life to help somebody there's more in you in potentials than what you realize tonight god has deposited more in you than i can ever preach and get clear to you god has deposited his life and authority in you it's not coming it's in you now how will you use it what will you do with it i say help us lord praise the lord is that good tonight is that good is that good with everybody amen let's stand together what a wonderful wonderful thing god has brought us in the word of god and showed us that we have this life what will we do with it we have this power of electricity when are we going to harness it and bring it into the right thing to do something good with it praise the lord amen he's good impress us lord as we come to this tonight this great truth that you have presented to us lord we pray that you would help us to offer up humble hearts to you help us to find that character that says not my own will but thine be done help us to walk with you every day in fellowship lord i wanted to get into adam and where he fell and he exercised authority over control over the elements and the animals and he named the animals and lord he's exercising all this authority and yet the prophet said but the place that he fell in was to take that and use that power for himself and over his own situation with the serpent he had all authority and yet somehow he backed off from using it in a personal way for his personal his wife got out of order his wife got out of her got out of a place and fell to the serpent's reasoning and he fell with it and all this stuff began to happen and satan was messing with adam's promise that he'll multiply and replenish the earth misinterpreting and all those things he should have stood there with the same authority that he spoke to the winds and spoke to that personal situation father [Music] grow us as your sons and your daughters lord grow us into that esther grow us into that faith to use the authority of god to expose our enemy and to redeem people who need to be redeemed ran it lord forgive us of our sins forgive us of our weaknesses and
