TRANSCRIPT
========================================
18 and he says and said they then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in in how jerusalem lay uh a waste in the gates thereon are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of jerusalem the way that we be no more our reproach then i told them of and then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me and as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work amen so today by god's grace if we if we can title this i i did this bible study with the youth a few a couple of years or three years ago so it's a lengthy one but we're gonna take two hours tonight amen i know we understand is is uh wednesday and you may be tired but we're just gonna get where the lord wants us to get amen so the we we can title this redemption the king's words amen so uh you know the prophet of god tells us and he he says that when we read our bible we must seek christ through the scriptures if we don't we have to go back and read the scriptures and read and read the bible again until we see christ amen and one more thing now is not only we have to see christ but we now we have to see ourselves in the scriptures amen and and with that in mind we we can we can start this evening you know we read in the book of revelations that there is a holy city that is descending that city has walls that city also have 12 gates amen and and we have we have heard many times the prophet of god saying that jerusalem that we are seeing in in the in the book of revelations now it is talking about about us that's what we're saying like when as i said when we were reading john was seeing a finnish product and i can imagine john was rejoicing because he's like i'm not seeing a a church i'm not seeing a bride that is defeated or a bride that is incomplete i'm seeing someone that is shining someone that is perfect and now that that perfection he is he he was seeing you he was seeing me amen so you know we're talking about that that's the lamps well the the lamps wife and and and then that gate that um city it has gates amen so in in those gates they have to be in perfect conditions amen and that's what we're looking forward tonight if if we can think about a process and that we can ask ourselves in where where am i in that part of the process amen do i need salvation tonight he is my savior do i need healing he is my healer do i need to be adopted he is my father so now if we now enter into the book of nehemiah we can see that in the first chapters we see how there was a desire in nehemiah's heart to rebuild the city because you know when he comes before the king the king saw his face and his countenance he was like he was sad and he was like what's going on nehemiah you're supposed to be happy in the presence of the king but there was something in nehemiah's heart that he was not fulfilled that he was incomplete and he's like they asked him what's going on in and he was a well you know my people my city the walls the gates everything is destroyed and then he went in the presence of the king and the king told him as we read in the second chapter then he then he went back to them and told them what the king had told him because now when he's in in the presence of the people when he when he he was in the presence of the king then the king gives him letters then the king gives him kind of the the the the materials if you will so that he can go back and rebuild or he or he gives him money so he can come back he can go back and rebuild amen so when he goes back to his people and he's like we have i'm here in jerusalem and you are all distressed we are all distressed that we are in now how jerusalem is is wasted jerusalem is destroyed but guess what there is someone that has been sent with a commission with a desire to reveal the city so this day we can say it is the same thing there was a prophet that was sent the prophet is gone but still god is rebuilding the city god is restoring the people god is changing the hearts god is giving salvation to those that need salvation god is still giving you peace give he is still giving you joy amen and what i like from this scripture that you can see on the screen is like then i told them of the hand of my god which god which was good upon me i'm coming here with by by with the hand of my god and not only that but also i'm here with the king's words how when we received a commission these days the prophet of god when he was in up in that mountain he received the king's sword he's the same the same thing talking about restoration talking about a change that we need to have that needs to happen in our lives amen so there was a desire in your mind he's like i need to reveal the gates i need to do something with this with this with the walls with the gates they cannot be like that for the rest of our lives amen so before we go further you know the prophet of god says there was an old you know these old biol violinists he had no violin and he was going to sell that violin and they wanted to sell it for a certain thing you know the actioner said well who gave me so and so and i believe he was offered just a few coins maybe 50 cents or something and then he says going once going twice and then directly there are men raised up in the back and he said just a minute he woke up and he got it and the prophet of god you know we can say that he had that violin and then he started tuning it he started adjusting the the the strings there and and and everything and and then with with the the the ark how is it called like the ball yeah then he started fixing that and then he started playing this song and the prophet of god says he started maybe playing there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins when sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty slave stain then he laid it down and then he says there wasn't a dry eye in the place why because and then he asked like who offered five thousand ten thousand it was priceless why because the master of the violin had revealed its true quality amen how many times we have feel that we we are we're worth nothing but the master of the violin have come tonight and he has revealed our true worth a real worth and the prophet of god says that we are worth more than ten thousand million worlds and then he says oh brothers sister now let the master of this world who wrote it the great holy spirit rosing up his bone with love and pull it across your heart i will lie that in my heart lord may you come tonight and and whatever my need is lord may you can't come in and change the atmosphere changed my life changed my heart man now if if as i said in the book of nehemiah he's talking about uh he was trying to restore something so we see that they revealed the walls and now he he was like you know what we need to do something else because you know the there was a way that they have to go to the city amen so in order for them to enter into the city there were gates amen and as we read here in the book of revelations the city had 12 gates amen so that's what we want to look at tonight amen there were gates in the old jerusalem and in the in the future jerusalem or in the jerusalem that is to come there were 12 gates in the old jerusalem there are 12 gates amen so we want to see that tonight so as we said when nehemiah goes back to jerusalem he goes around the wall and he sees that it is destroyed and not just the wall is destroyed but also the gates of the city they are destroyed but in him there was a desire so i was saying there was a desire to reveal the wall and reveal the gates to restore that formic lord that that former glory to jerusalem amen and but then then as we read the hand of god was with him and now so the king's words were with nehemiah and one thing he had the king's support to restore he got he had the the king we can say it nowadays the king's endorsement endorsement to restore that city and one thing that i was thinking is like he comes straight from the king's presence with a task amen and he comes from the king's presence with a task he comes with a commission straight from the presence of the king hey i need to restore i need to reveal amen if that was in the natural now you have the king's word today to restore your life certainly you know there were so many obstacles to reveal the wall in the gates but that wasn't a problem for him or his people because he had the word of the king amen so we see our lives how our life our maybe our lives were hurt our life where our lives were destroyed by our by our decisions and people that have come and that have left amen but we can also see the obstacles also the enemy trying to destroy the lord's work in our lives but the believer we have promises given by god and then we have the hand of god and the king's letters that say i will restore and i was thinking about this scripture in order it doesn't say i'm gonna send someone to restore it says i will restore it is beautiful when you start looking at the scriptures when when he's in the in the in the personal pronoun i is because he is that work is so special for him that he has to do it i will restore i will descend amen it brings security to us that he will finish the work of restoration no matter what if you feel defeated tonight if you feel disappointed if you feel discouraged tonight just rest assured in that that he has said i will restore amen by his grace he put that in my anointing to rebuild to rebuild us to bring us back to our former glory you know the scripture says in the book of hagai it says the glory of this later house of this latter house shall be greater than of the former house of the former glory said the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace i will give you peace i will restore you i will descend think about it you're so special to god that it is his word he's not sending somebody else to do the work he's saying i will restore i will design i will descend i will change your heart i will give you a new heart i will give you a new spirit i will give you a new life i will go and prepare a place for you if you are not if you don't don't get it tonight or you haven't gotten enough and gotten it in all these years i don't know but he's doing the work he says i so lord you are you are the i am as you said you as moses was like who is sending me you sold them there i am he's sending me is sending you moses amen what is that former glory it's our life before we we met the lord what is that louder glory or later glory is our life after he came and started his work in us that's why nehemiah was so sure about it he's like i have the king's word i have the king's letter and the hand of the lord is with me therefore i will go oh lord give us give us that courage that nehemiah had and now lord establish your kingdom in our hearts amen now we can start with the first one if you will here it says nehemiah chapter 3 verse 1. and i want you to look at the types in the shadows because they are talking about some something that is so beautiful you know that's why i said at the beginning if when you're reading the scripture you don't see christ and you have to you have to go back if you when you're reading the scriptures and you don't see yourself you have to go back and read the scriptures because this is not just a book full of information it is good you know like kind of a good of good practices and things but this is more than that this is life for us amen and then here in nehemiah chapter three verse one it says daniel eliashif and then i was looking you know some sometimes we go and and look up for for um the meanings and things so this was a high priest that rose up with his brethren the priest and they builded the ship gate they sanctified it and they set up the doors of it even unto the tower of mia they they sanctified onto the tower of hanonel but i want you to notice here this was a high priest and look what his name means his name means the god of conversion the god that can change or the god of translation so here this restoration in your life starts with a high priest isn't it amazing if i ask you tonight what is the office of a high priest he's an intercessor he's interceding for you and that's why he is our christ is our high priest that he is interceding for us every day amen jesus is our high priest and he is our intercessor that's why he's studying the work in us because we need that we need to be safe to enter into his kingdom amen you belong to god you are engraved on the palm of his hand and nothing can not nothing can take you from there how many of us needed salvation we we needed to be safe in order for us to come into the kingdom of god so he sent the high priest that that sacrifice of as we said it before that suck the high priest that had to go every year but now that's that that sacrifice or that uh high priest doesn't have to go every year now the veil was open the veil was rent and now how many times can i go into the holy of colius i can go now every day every hour every minute if i need salvation lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation restore to me what the what the enemy has taken away but here had we had to have the nehemiah annoying thing wanting to restore something you are engraved on the palm of his hand and nothing can take you from there he reached down his hands for us i mean what what does this gate speaks about it speaks about salvation it speaks about sacrifice it speaks about the gate this gate shows that we need salvation and the sacrifice he made for us at calvary amen that's what this gate means in other words you know when the lord starts his process in our life you you didn't go you know if we put it this way you didn't learn algebra before knowing your basic math so in order for for for you to to grow in christ you first need the foundation and the foundation i will say is salvation amen so now john 14 i mean john 10 26 through 30 he says my sheep they hear my voice and i know them and they follow me you know when the prophet of god speaks of a sheep like he's talking that that that is the the the the most meek the mikas i would put it that way animal that you know if you leave that if you leave them they will die they need someone to guide them and then here john talking and says and i i give them unto them i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any men plug them can pluck them out of my hand because my father which gave them is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand because and now he says i and my father are what we are now one so that's why he now if he wants us to come through the ship gate he has to liken us onto a ship that's why he's like i'm the i'm the good shepherd so if i'm a shepherd there has to be amen and now psalms 41 through and 2 it says i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry and he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and he set my feet up on a rock and established my coins when salvation comes to you he establishes your goings amen he establishes your steps now you you are gonna be led amen that's what you when you're when you're thinking about a process you have to come and you have to be safe first and then he's going to start a process and then you know as the scripture says that he that began a good the good work he will finish he will finish the good work in the day of the lord but he has started the work if he has started the work he's going to finish the work so how is he studying the work the work well how is he going to start it by us being safe but now he's setting my feet up on a rock and now i can walk in his commandments in his statutes amen so now this again this game shows the need that i need salvation i need to be saved because that's one of his attributes in order for him to to save someone there has to be some someone that is lost and the sacrifice also this gate also shows the sacrifice that he made for us at calvary amen now there is another gate here number two the fish gate it says but the fish gate did the sons of hasena they built hasanah build who also laid the beams thereof instead of the doors they're off the locks they're off and the bars they're off so what i want you to notice is that when they were repairing those gates they didn't leave anything incomplete they were making sure that all the posts in the beams and everything was perfectly in its place and when god comes to your life as we were hearing on sunday you know you may have to go through through some kind of bitter uh bitter bitter times but that's also because the lord is kind of fixing that those gates in our lives he's fixing something in our lives so then we he when he looks at it at the end he's like well this is perfect that's how i like it amen sometimes we don't like it but that's that's that's the way it is you know after there is a need of salvation from within your heart the lord puts a desire in in you what is this fish gate this this gate is the gate of the testimony after you're saved now there is a desire in your heart now you want to share the good news with everybody hey i was saved i received christ he puts that desire in you to be a testimony that he lives in that he has done something in your life that he has taken away all the burdens that you were carrying for years and now that you're free now you can testify that to other people because god will always have something to show in your life to others amen sometimes we don't like that but that's how it is amen if he he needs someone on this earth to display his attributes and if someone is willing lord when we say we're willing we will have to share our testimony amen i can just say help me lord that my testimony attract others that you're still god in the 21st century and we listen to this we can say that in heaven there was perfection and in the midst of perfection there was one that exalted himself and he was brought down to earth that was lucifer and then in the garden of eden there was also perfection and there was adam and eve they were perfect but there was the original scene that cast cuts them out of the garden of eden you know in the midst of perfection imperfection try tries to try to sneak in amen but what a testimony we can say tonight that in the midst of satan's eden the lord is bringing a bride to perfection the lord is showing the world that even though satan's eaten we're living in the midst of it there is a bride there is a people that they are they are going to perfection amen that is the greatest testimony that could ever exist you know sons and daughters of god living in this evil age and still reflecting the life of christ isn't that amazing that is we can say that is a paradox amen you know this this is an insane age people is kind of you know all sort of things and we're still with sound minds that we can still think for ourselves a man that we can still sleep in that we we are not we we may deal with depression with anxiety but we we know where to go we know where to bring those things and he will give us that rest amen that's what he promised that i will give you rest come come to me all you that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest you see again i will give you rest i will restore amen now you know the first gate was about salvation the second gate is like now i'm saved now i have to share my testimony how the lord saved me how the lord filled me how how would the things that he's done in my life but now he brings us to to to an ex another gate and that's the oil gate you know moreover the old gate repaired jehoiada in the son of paseo in in meshulam in the son of besoidea they laid the beams there off and set up the doors are off and the locks are off and the bars they're off what is this all gate it is talking about the old experience amen the prophet of god you know we can say that give me that old-time religion if it was good for the prophets it is also good enough for me and the prophet of god says i believe in an old-time backwoods sky blue sink killing religion yes sir that kills out sin and self in yourself and you're born again of the spirit of god and you're living now for him amen that's the kind of religion that we can say that will save savior not a religion of you know of just a kind of uh conforming but a religion that is gonna change our mindset that is gonna change our life for the good and you know one thing i i noticed in these quotes that we're gonna put here on the screen in this first one he's saying i believe that we that we need an all-time backwoods religion and then in this other one he said he says what we need is an old-fashioned godsend it's called the religion that will escalate worldliness out of the church we need to come back to what to the holy ghost and fire back to the things that burn out the draws brings the old-fashioned preaching back make heaven high and hell hot amen we need that kind of a preaching in other words if that gate in your life needs to be repaired lord tonight give me that old time experience that i had a year ago helped me to renew my experience every day lord i want that old-time religion that is burning the scene out of my life he's saying i believe what we need and now he's he says what the the church is hungering now the church is hungering today that once more they all fashion god send revival from the pulpit plum to the janitor and that old fashioned cleaning up an old-fashioned revival amen how many won that tonight with the power of god a gospel that cleans a man from the inside out how many want that he takes all the hollywood out of you there was there he was praying not a new denomination not a new creed but of indication of the word i believe we need the church is hungering today and if you're hungering for something tonight the lord can come and give you that he can provide that bread for you so that you won't go hungry anymore that gate needs to be repaired sometimes salvation testimony that all experience that you were just crying and i can say on sunday what while the preaching was going what was what's going i was just crying i was like that's a good experience but lord don't let it be just tears coming out of my eyes but a real change in my heart if i'm going the wrong the wrong way lord come and change that that's what i want or we want that old religion that brings the sinner to repentance that changes the drunkard to a son of god amen now this takes us back to another gate it takes us to the valley gate what is the valley the valley gate repair hanun and they have inhabitants of sanoa they built it and they set it up and the doors are off and everything and you know here hanun his name means gracious his name means merciful in other words when you go and look at all of these like all these people that were repairing they were typing christ as well amen this gates speaks to us about humility it is the gate of the small things amen isaiah 41 through 5 it says comfort he come for ye my people say your god speaking comfortably to jerusalem i mean crying to her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity her iniquity is pardoned for she had received of the lord's hand double of for all her sins but it doesn't doesn't stay there he's now speaks about the voice of him that cried in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make a street in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted and every mountain in hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made as straight in the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it shall see together for the mouth of the lord had spoken it what is true humility is to obey all the word that comes from the mother of god in its fullness that is is if if the word is coming and it's correct in my life lord i humble myself and i say help me change my heart amen the world we the word will always make us to recognize our mistakes and listen to this greatness to be great greatness will never hide the fact that you are a sinner amen if you want to be great you have to humble yourself humility it was it is what brought the lord to glory and arrogance is what brought lucifer from heaven i he and what what was lucifer's position he's like i will ascend and i will make myself greater or the same as god he wanted to be worshiped but it was not his place he wanted to be praised but he he wasn't called for that purpose his purpose was just to worship god amen and you know we we know in the scriptures that even there was one king that he was he he was his office he was good as a king but he wanted to do the office of a priest and and the priests were like no this is not your position and then he he got he he was he god sent him a leprosy and then he died a leper why because he was out of his position and you know how many how many people can be living stuck at this gate because they if they don't recognize their position in christ the only thing that will produce in them that will be arrogance because the lord wants to bring you beyond humility he wants to bring you to another level he wants to bring you beyond salvation beyond your testimony beyond beyond that all of fashion experience now he wants to bring humility but he wants to bring it to another level but people get stuck there in that gate and they say well i know better than the pastor i know better than the deacon or the prophet i can guide i can i can be my own guide but guess what he's a blind leading the blind but help us lord to be of a meek in a humble heart that's my desire tonight and peter says humble yourselves therefore under under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in when when it is time and then when you humble yourself it doesn't stay there because now he says casting all your care upon him because he cares for you so when i humble myself lord that means that you're going to care take care of my spouse or my life you're going to take care of my needs yes that is correct humble yourself say lord i just come tonight and i just humbled my life humble myself to you so that you can use me for your glory and i know that you're going to take care of me now philippians 2 6 through 9 it says verse 8 and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself if the god of glory he humbled himself how much more we that are humans but guess what if if you have received him if you have received salvation from him if the seed of god is living in you you're going to produce the same fruits amen it is like and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and wherefore god also had highly exalted him why because he humbled himself you know when when he came to earth they thought that he was going to be the king coming from heaven on on a big horse and and things like that but he came as he and he was born in in the humblest place on earth why just to show them that he can go to the lowest to bring them to the highest amen because he got it also had exalted a highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name what was that name our savior of our lord our king amen now think about it look at naaman that great syrian captain he had everything in life but what he was a leper you know and and for sure we know from the scriptures that he was a gentile amen and but one thing is that there was a woman among among his servants that she knew that there was a prophet in the land and that that he could tell him what to do to be to be cleansed and i can ask you tonight if someone would have the answer to your situation will you do what they say or would you question that instruction he was in a dilemma we can say because you know he was like there are other rivers seriously prophet there are other rivers there that i can go in in in immerse myself or kind of go deep myself in there and you're sending me to jordan you're sending me to separation you're sending me to to the one that is full of you know [Music] everything and and and it was like well the the young like he the maid told him well if the prophet is telling you what why why wouldn't you go amen and one thing that i like here is that you know his servants came near and spake unto him and say my father if the prophet that had beated to do some great thing would wouldn't would as thou not have done it how much rather than when he said to thee washed and be clean he needed humility he needed to be humble he needed to go he needed to repair that gate and say you know what that gate needs to be repaired and guess what i'm gonna go and i'm gonna dip myself into that jordan river and he's gonna do what he has to do because he said it the word of god just came he did himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh look his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean now look he received a message of transformation naaman when you go to the river your skin will be like the skin of a babe that was the way it happened how many name and attitude exists today many people not being humble enough and they are not seeing the lord's doing in this time it is time for us to go down to the jordan river and be transformed from our own glory to his glory amen this is the type of the message that we have received or the message that name and received was a message of restoration a message of transformation uh of to a new body because when he came out out of there what was he how was he looking like he was like a little baby you touched the the skin of a baby how does it feel it's very soft that was neyman's name nameless skin amen what was that it was from one glory to another glory he now humble yourself and he will exalt you and you know we have to be humble again i can respect repeat and repeat again but that's what we need today and then you know yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now these we're going through the valley to the through the times of humility and sometimes it it seems that we're going we're passing through death but guess what if there is a shadow is because there is light if it says if even if i go through the shadow it's because there is light amen and we're walking with god's hand by his handle or he's holding our hand amen so now he brings us to the long gate now what what is donggate and you know it says here that they repair everything that needed to be repaired in this malkai or if i can read it that way it means the lord is my king or the lord is my counselor and you know this is a door that was also provided by the lord and it was where they will take the dong from the city now look the don was not to stay there it had to be taken out of the city to the right place but there was a specific gate where they all the the the people that was living in the city they have to go through that specific gate to take out all the dong and then now look what what paul is saying here he says in verse seven he says but that what things were gained to me those i counted i counted laws for christ and not he didn't stay there yeah doubtless and i count all things but laws for the excellence excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord from for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but tongue that i may win christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the fate of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith so now we are seeing paul going through this gate now paul is saying everything that i had everything that i have learned now this is done for me what can you say for your life tonight everything that you have everything that you know oh you know it is great i know all things no count them as done for christ amen now what else can we say here second corinthians chapter 6 verse 17 and 18 it says wherefore come out of from among them and ye be separate said the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and i will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters said the lord almighty what can we say here through this gate any worldly thing is long before the lord the lord invites us to separate ourselves from the world and consecrate ourselves in the spirit and in body in our souls we have to live for him we have to love him we have to we have to love him more than your words but with our actions amen so we how many of us can say tonight sometimes we need to go and and and go by the dung gate but don't stay there just take the trash out and and then keep repairing everything else paul could say he's my pastor he he he could share a testimony of the life of christ having a fulfillment in his life it brought him humility and he considered everything as long as done to gain christ and we can say that the revival that is happening in our lives is taking all day down from our lives where do we go from here he's talking to me about salvation about humility about the old experience he's talking to me about dong are you going to leave us there no no we're not going to stay there you want you cannot be all your life in justification or you cannot build your life in sanctification you have to go you have to you have to keep moving in in the spirit of god now the fountain gate it was repaired by shaloon you know the the son of call jose the ruler of of part of mispa and what's the meaning of this shalom he it is the one that retributes and it is a man of prosperity amen and now look at this at this fountain fountain this fountain is a spring of living water what a precious fountain that is flowing for for all this is the gate of the holy spirit amen the gate of the holy spirit that needs to be repaired in our lives look at rebecca she had to face the water test the angel move her to so that she that she will go where the where the angel told her go to the well because it's time to go and get and draw the water and then the angel was at the same time moving with who with a loser to to go and meet rebecca he meant so eliezer's a message was that living water that she was longing for how many can say lord repair this gate in our lives more of you every day we can say i want to come to the washing of water by the world his holy spirit that cleanses that changes that fills you your life with his presence that takes away all the desires that are not right before his presence out of your life is that holy spirit that this is the gate where the holy spirit is sealing your life is is is he is marking you that you belong to someone that you belong to him how many can say lord the prophet of god says let the holy spirit search my conscience and then she talking about you know she found on she found out that there was a prophet daniel was among them that he was a dissolver of doubts the lord you led the holy spirit he is the prophet of the day let he come into your heart right now and if you examine with the word of god and the doubts about the message will be all dissolved why because god dissolves all doubts he's the holy spirit that through the revelation of the word can come in if you have questions it's good to have questions don't get me wrong because people are like no you're not supposed to have questions about anything yeah you it's good to have questions because when you have biblical questions there will always be biblical answers and as brother paul always says don't go to google or or the internet to find your answers go to your bible go to the message and find the answers that you're looking for because the answers are there are there if you have a question there will always be an answer so what is all this gate about is about receiving the holy spirit it's about you know we talk about being humble we talk about kind of removing all the trash out of our lives now what is next lord i want to receive your holy spirit and if that gate gate needs to be repaired tonight if i need a refilling of the holy spirit lord i can take it tonight and ephesians 4 30 it says in greek not the holy spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption what is this his holy spirit will always bring revelation to our lives we can say this that the process of redemption god has started it before the foundation of the world he started with the ship gate where we spoke about the salvation and the sacrifice that he made for us then he brings us to the fish gate where the lord wants us to give testimony that he is alive then he bring us to the old gate that old religion that can come and change our lives then he brought us to the valley gate that demand from us humility and that if we kind of we humble ourselves he's going to exalt us then he brings us to the dung gate from where where all the worldliness must go by and not stay there he wants to take all of that from our lives and then now he he brought us to the fountain gate that that is the holy spirit coming and sealing our lives until the day of our redemption how many are grateful tonight and we can stop here how many are grateful tonight that lord these are not just scriptures that were written there it's like there are the treasures that we can come and we can we can we can read the scriptures and now through the revelation that we have received from the lord now we can understand that when we read the scriptures it has to be applied to my life because like when nehemiah had that desire it was representing someone that needed to come and that that someone needed those steps to take place in their lives that was me lord i needed salvation that was me lord i needed to have an all-time religion experience can we just buy our heads if the musicians can come let's just bow our heads and say lord thank you for your word father thank you for these scriptures thank you for for for these types these shadows lord that they were talking about about something and that's something that they were talking they were talking about oslore about how you can come and restore how you can come through that process lord through through um cleaning our lives lord through salvation or through restoration or as you you have promised for for this day lord you say that you will restore and that's what we're believing tonight father thank you for your children that were able to come tonight and hear your word lord thank you for this this book of nehemiah lord because we can see ourselves there we can see that while they were rebuilding that city well they they were rebuilding those walls those gates they needed that strength they were all distressed they were all under under a lot of pressure lord because they didn't know where to go father but through the anointing of nehemiah you sent them what they needed you send them the word of the king so they needed where to go they needed directions lord and you send them through your your servant nehemiah we have received the same lord the in this the message of these last days lord that now we we have the word that we we we are not we could be this in distress or we can we can be under a lot of pressure father but that's what you send your profit and we we have her messages like letting off the pressure lord why is the people that toss it about and then the other other sermons lord like he cares do you care lord you send all those messages lord to tell us father that they were coming from the king and that these things needed to be rebuilt these things need
