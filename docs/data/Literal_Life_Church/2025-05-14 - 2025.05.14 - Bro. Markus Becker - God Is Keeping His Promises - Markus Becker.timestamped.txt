[22:48] brother Marcus Becker. It's been a
[22:50] couple years since he's been here and we
[22:52] appreciate his uh he's an evangelist
[22:55] from Beaslesburg, Germany. And we just
[22:57] uh we're talking in the office how that
[23:00] he first time my wife and I went over to
[23:01] Germany. I preached a youth camp there
[23:03] in one of the old castles, the
[23:05] historical castles. And brother Marcus
[23:08] was uh my original um translator
[23:12] translated while I preached there. And
[23:14] this is when Amariah and Solomon were
[23:16] babies. We took them with us for some
[23:18] crazy reason. We took our babies all the
[23:20] way to Germany and didn't get any sleep
[23:22] the whole time and trapesed up three
[23:24] stairs in the castle. There was no
[23:27] elevators. Three uh three floors up to
[23:30] the meeting place, three floors down to
[23:32] the cafeteria and then our room. And it
[23:35] we were going up and down with the
[23:36] babies all week. But brother Marcus was
[23:39] our translator and helped preach this
[23:40] all for us all the way back then. But I
[23:43] told him I will not be able to translate
[23:45] for him tonight from German to US.
[23:47] That's for sure. For uh our language,
[23:50] but thankfully he knows English and um
[23:52] for for years I'm being honest tonight
[23:54] cuz Germans are always honest. So I'll
[23:56] be honest. Uh I didn't like Germans for
[23:59] many years uh until I begin to meet
[24:01] people like uh brother Marcus and uh I
[24:05] realized that God uh has his hand on
[24:08] every culture and every person and every
[24:12] and especially us Americans. We need
[24:14] help more than any of them. No sense in
[24:16] being critical. Uh so I love him and I
[24:19] appreciate him and I know he'll have a
[24:20] good word for us tonight. God bless you
[24:23] all and may you enjoy the word of life.
[24:25] That's what we're here for.
[24:27] May you enjoy it. May you take it in.
[24:29] And just we are so How many you can
[24:31] raise your hand? We are so blessed. And
[24:33] I don't mean this church. I don't mean
[24:35] me. I mean we are blessed with the word,
[24:38] the level of the way God speaking to us.
[24:41] It's just we're so blessed. And we
[24:44] should never take it for granted. Praise
[24:46] the Lord. Amen. Let go and let God have
[24:48] his way tonight. Just let him have his
[24:50] way. Let go and let God have his

[25:52] vanish. Your night turn to
[25:57] day. Let go and let God have his
[26:04] way. Hallelujah. Now, while the music is
[26:06] softly playing, let's bow our heads. And
[26:10] if you want that the Lord speaks
[26:11] something to you personally, you just
[26:14] raise your hands to the Lord and say,
[26:16] "Heavenly Father," you can even use
[26:17] Brother Marcus to tell me something that
[26:19] helps me on my way. Heavenly Father, we
[26:22] thank you so much for this evening. Your
[26:24] name may be glorified. May you help the
[26:27] minister. May you help the listeners.
[26:29] Father, I know it's a Wednesday night

[27:02] these things in the name of the Lord
[27:04] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[27:08] Amen. God bless you all. And while we
[27:10] are standing, let's open the word of the
[27:12] Lord. Yes,
[27:14] I in the second book of Kings chapter 20
[27:18] verse one. And I thank definitely the
[27:20] musicians for these wonderful songs that
[27:22] we that we heard. Second Kings 20 verse
[27:29] one. For me, it's page 520, but it
[27:33] doesn't it's not helpful for you. Okay.
[27:37] In those days was
[27:39] heiah sick unto death. And the prophet
[27:42] Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and
[27:45] said unto him, "Thus sayaest the Lord,
[27:48] set thine house in order, for thou shalt
[27:50] die and not live." Then he turned his
[27:53] face to the wall and prayed unto the
[27:56] Lord, saying, I beseech thee, O Lord,
[27:59] remember now how I have walked before
[28:01] thee in truth and with a perfect heart,
[28:04] and have done that which is good in thy
[28:07] sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. And it
[28:10] came to pass before Isaiah was gone out
[28:13] in the middle court, that the word of
[28:15] the Lord came to him, saying, "Turn
[28:18] again, and tell Hezekiah, the captain of
[28:21] my people. Thus sayaeth the Lord, the
[28:24] God of David, thy father, I have heard
[28:27] thy prayer. I have seen their tears.
[28:30] Behold, I will heal thee on the third
[28:32] day, that thou shalt go up unto the
[28:35] house of the Lord." May the Lord add his
[28:38] blessing to the reading of his word. We
[28:40] may be
[28:41] seated. Now, it's a great honor for me
[28:44] to to take this service for this evening
[28:47] and uh I know it's a very prominent
[28:50] pullpit here and with a tremendous
[28:52] ministries that are passing by and your
[28:54] own pastor is a wonderful man and a
[28:56] tremendous man. And so I I just thought
[29:00] to to to come by because we have a
[29:02] project and uh that I will not enter too
[29:05] deep in this because then my time is up
[29:08] just presenting the project. But then
[29:10] brother Paul said why don't you uh
[29:12] preach for us on that Wednesday evening.
[29:14] It's a great honor. It's a great
[29:16] pleasure and uh it's a great pleasure to
[29:19] see the the family laines and and and
[29:21] you Gideon and Solomon. I saw the whole
[29:24] dream team already. Yeah. We are we are
[29:26] good friends since we met at the youth
[29:28] camp many many years at brother Ron
[29:29] Peterson. You remember huh? And yeah
[29:32] definitely. So and brother brother
[29:34] brother Paul one time said to me brother
[29:36] Marcus you will never become a fan of
[29:37] laantine music. Okay I said I have on my
[29:40] playlist I have some laugh songs. Okay
[29:43] but I said it might be so that I'm too
[29:45] German for that but I said I'm
[29:47] definitely a fan of the Leafantine
[29:49] family. Okay. And that's so wonderful.
[29:51] We believe that is uh not with words of
[29:53] flatteries that that uh God placed here
[29:56] a man and and a church with really a
[29:58] wonderful vision. A wonderful vision and
[30:00] I'm praying that God will continue to
[30:02] bless you that way. And um uh yeah,
[30:05] we're just a family of God. I bring
[30:07] greetings from Germany, from my pastor,
[30:09] brother Rodald, and from many of the
[30:11] believers uh that know you and uh yeah,
[30:15] bring the greetings from there to the
[30:17] family, to the Lant family, and to all
[30:20] of you. And if you wouldn't mind, I I
[30:23] would enter directly into the subject.
[30:26] Yes, sir. And uh because I know it's a
[30:28] Wednesday, I'm not a I'm I I will
[30:30] respect time, but give me give me that
[30:32] time to to develop a certain a certain
[30:35] picture. Okay. And um I I I I I would
[30:40] like to entitle the subject and
[30:43] definitely I was preaching it in South
[30:45] Africa when I was there two weeks ago.
[30:47] Um but as I don't have notes, every
[30:50] sermon is is a little bit individual. Um
[30:53] God is keeping his
[30:56] promises and the the
[31:00] the story that we have found here is the
[31:04] story of
[31:06] Hezekiah. And now the prophet comes to
[31:10] him and says, "Thus sayaeth the Lord,
[31:13] you shall
[31:14] die." And Hezekiah wept sore. And it
[31:18] seemed that God
[31:20] heard the cry of
[31:23] Hezekiah. And when the prophet Isaiah
[31:27] when he left the inner court, the middle
[31:30] court, God speaks back to the prophet
[31:34] Ezekiah and says, "Go back and tell the
[31:38] king that he shall live."
[31:42] Now my question to you this evening,
[31:44] what thus sayeth the Lord was thus
[31:47] sayaeth the
[31:48] Lord because it was completely
[31:51] contradictive
[31:53] completely. And I want to say both thus
[31:56] sayaith the Lord were but thus sayaith
[31:58] the Lord both both and we will see this
[32:02] evening that brother Brandon makes it
[32:04] very clear that God does not change his
[32:08] mind about his word. But at the same
[32:11] time, brother Blammy said God changes
[32:14] his mind about situations
[32:17] and that makes that Bible applyable to
[32:21] our own life. That makes that message
[32:24] brother this
[32:26] message now we had for 2,000 years we
[32:30] had all kind of
[32:31] fanaticism because we didn't understand
[32:34] God's nature. Therefore, we tried
[32:37] reformation and reformation is only
[32:40] there to frustrate
[32:42] people. I tell you one thing, we were
[32:44] too long in legalism. Legalism is a dead
[32:47] end. It has no solution. It can
[32:51] frustrate people. We tried reformation,
[32:54] never worked. We tried liberalation, it
[32:56] never worked. We tried Pentecostalism
[32:59] and it never worked. Amen. Uh we tried
[33:02] we tried churchianity, it never worked.
[33:05] But the Bible says in the days of the of
[33:07] the voice of the seventh angel, the
[33:10] mystery, not mysteries, they were
[33:13] revealed by Scullfield. And so, but the
[33:15] mystery, God reveals who he is. For the
[33:20] first time, we could look in the back
[33:22] part of of of God's mind. Therefore, we
[33:26] understand God better than Adam in the
[33:29] Garden of Eden. It's a tremendous time.
[33:32] It's a tremendous time. Amen. I'm a
[33:34] little bit like Trump. Tremendous. But
[33:36] okay, it's how it is. But it's
[33:38] tremendous. Honestly,
[33:40] unbelievable. Amen. So, we see remember
[33:44] uh between the first dust sayaith the
[33:46] Lord and the second dust sayaith the
[33:48] Lord, there's a changing of shift a
[33:50] shifting of guards. Okay? So, the next
[33:53] day, and if I'm walking up and down,
[33:55] it's it's just that I feel good. Okay?
[33:57] Please don't take it personal. Okay? Uh
[34:00] it's it's it's it's a it's it's a it's a
[34:02] shifting of guards and they might have
[34:05] seen one another the next day and uh one
[34:08] guard said to the next wasn't it
[34:10] wonderful what the prophet said and the
[34:13] first guard said what what was wonderful
[34:15] the king shall die he said no the king
[34:18] shall live and the first one said I have
[34:20] it on
[34:21] tape the second one said I have it on
[34:24] tape too the first one said but that was
[34:26] before 63
[34:27] free. I mean, so Bose is on tape. How
[34:31] can it be that God corrects himself? And
[34:34] we will see this evening how great our
[34:38] father is. And we we before we start
[34:41] with that thing, we we we have to
[34:44] understand the nature of God. That is
[34:47] once we understand God, we can
[34:50] understand ourself. You can only become
[34:52] a child of your father if you understand
[34:55] how your father thinks.
[34:57] Okay. And then you learn to treat
[35:00] people. You understand people. You
[35:02] understand their background. And so lean
[35:05] a little bit back and just rejoice this
[35:07] evening. How how how because this
[35:09] message revealed the almighty God to us.
[35:13] He's not a stranger anymore. I mean,
[35:15] blessed be the name of the Lord. And if
[35:17] if the brothers would help me, I would
[35:18] definitely appreciate with the technique
[35:20] with the technical
[35:22] part. So here's what brother Brand said.
[35:25] He said don't misunderstand me now and
[35:28] say brother Brandham said Jesus will
[35:30] come in
[35:31] 1977. I never said no such a thing Jesus
[35:34] may come today but I have predicted that
[35:37] between 33 and 77 something would take
[35:41] place that these things that I seen come
[35:44] to pass in the vision would take place
[35:47] and five of them has already took place.
[35:50] Now I know as ministers we try to defend
[35:54] the message but the message defends
[35:56] itself. The lion does not need somebody
[35:59] to defend. The only person the only
[36:02] animal in the jungle who doesn't feel
[36:05] the lion is the lioness. Okay she
[36:08] understands he's roaring. But here
[36:10] brother Bam said five of these uh vision
[36:14] took place and but the rest will be
[36:16] finished between 33 and 77.
[36:20] Now I'm strongly against personal
[36:23] interpretations of the message. Now
[36:25] people can think the sixth vision is uh
[36:29] Hillary
[36:30] Clinton but I always said look brother
[36:32] said it will be a beautiful
[36:34] woman. I don't want to hurt your
[36:36] American feelings but that is up to
[36:39] opinion. Okay, it will be beautiful. But
[36:42] but the thing is this. We always say
[36:45] brother Brandham said it. I predict.
[36:48] Okay. But he said it 13 times. And if
[36:51] brother Brandham just was wrong, then
[36:54] it's a question to our young generation.
[36:57] Where else was brother Brandham wrong?
[36:59] Okay. And I want to tell the young
[37:01] people this message is watertight.
[37:05] But it takes our our understanding has
[37:07] be has to be adjusted. We understand too
[37:11] that brother Bram said things as a human
[37:14] being. That was his opinion. We are very
[37:17] clear on that. Okay. But when it comes
[37:20] to
[37:21] teaching, we have an infallable message.
[37:24] When it comes to teaching, it must be
[37:26] solid. Okay? If not, we can put into
[37:29] question everything. Okay? So here we
[37:32] have the challenge. How can the prophet
[37:35] say something like this? And obviously
[37:39] it's not fulfilled in that way. Okay. He
[37:42] says I predict but he used it 13 times
[37:45] in his preaching. Let's see if we can
[37:47] find a solution this evening. Please
[37:49] make the next one. Now you remember when
[37:52] I was preaching here last time about
[37:54] Esther and brother Bam said so he was
[37:57] first God Jehovah and out of him let's
[38:00] just picture now a little drama so you
[38:03] can get it. Let's see coming out of
[38:06] space where there was nothing. Let's
[38:08] make it a little white light, like a
[38:10] mystic light, like a halo. That was the
[38:12] logos that went out of God in the
[38:14] beginning. That was the son of God that
[38:17] came out of the bosom of the father.
[38:20] That was what was in the beginning was
[38:21] the word. And the word was with God, and
[38:23] the word was God. And the word was made
[38:26] flesh and dwelt among us. In the
[38:28] beginning was God. And then out of God
[38:30] came the logos, a part of God that went
[38:33] out of God. Now we we remember that
[38:36] brother Brham said the first thing that
[38:38] God created were angels. Quotes brother
[38:41] Brandham. And I always said, brother
[38:42] Brandham wasn't very clear. But the
[38:45] difference between a creation and a
[38:49] birth is that part of yourself is in
[38:53] that
[38:54] birth. Okay. Now me as a man I created
[38:58] many things. I builded houses. Okay. But
[39:01] I only b one daughter. The difference
[39:04] between the birth of my daughter is part
[39:07] of my DNA is in my daughter. So the
[39:10] pillar of fire was not
[39:12] created. It came out of it was birthed.
[39:17] Can you say amen? It's a difference.
[39:19] Angels are created but the pillar of
[39:22] fire was the logos that came out of God.
[39:25] It was part of God. Out of the logos
[39:28] came
[39:29] Melchazdc. Out of Melzdc came the Lord
[39:33] Jesus Christ. Okay. The bride in what
[39:36] form ever was always in Christ? Brother
[39:40] Brham said even we in Christ paid for
[39:43] our own sins at the cross. Who could say
[39:46] yes? Okay. So if the bride was in
[39:49] Christ, have you ever thought about
[39:51] that? As Eve was in Adam, the bride was
[39:55] in Christ. Now when God called Adam in
[39:58] the Garden of Eden, God didn't call Adam
[40:00] and Eve come. Eve had no name. She was
[40:03] part of Adam. God called Adam. Let Adam
[40:06] come. Adam, where are you? And two
[40:09] people came. When God called Adam, Eve
[40:11] was called with him. Eve had no name.
[40:14] She was just a helper. Huh? God called
[40:17] her a helper. Adam called a woman taken
[40:20] from a man. That means when when the
[40:22] bride in what form ever was in Christ,
[40:25] then the bride must have been in Melzdc.
[40:28] When the bride was in Melzdc, she must
[40:31] have been in the pillar of fire. And
[40:33] when she was in the pillar of what form
[40:35] ever, she must have been in God.
[40:38] Can you say amen? She is bone of his
[40:41] bone, flesh of his flesh, part of him as
[40:44] Eve was part of Adam. Okay. So we see
[40:49] God in his provision and then please
[40:51] make the next one and then brother B
[40:53] said something the eternal thoughts of
[40:56] God. Let me ask you are the thoughts of
[41:00] God eternal? If you can see this you
[41:04] will see many
[41:06] things in other words if you don't see
[41:08] this you just see God send a prophet and
[41:12] I mean but if you see this you will see
[41:14] many things. God is unchangeable in both
[41:17] essence and behavior. He is omnisient.
[41:20] He has never had a new thought about
[41:22] anything because all of his thoughts he
[41:24] has always had and always will have and
[41:26] knows the end from the beginning because
[41:28] he's God. Thus, the thoughts of God are
[41:31] eternal. They are real. They are not
[41:34] simply like a man with a blueprint he
[41:36] has drawn up which one day will be
[41:38] translated into substance and form. But
[41:42] they are already real, eternal, and part
[41:46] of God.
[41:49] Can you say amen? That's his family.
[41:51] Amen. There's a quote when brother said
[41:54] in the beginning, God was alone with his
[41:57] thoughts. But he never said God was
[42:00] thinking. He said he was he was alone
[42:02] with his thoughts. In other words, he
[42:04] wasn't alone. That's right. because his
[42:06] thoughts are eternal are part of him and
[42:10] they are already real.
[42:13] Amen. So we are his thoughts expressed.
[42:17] In other words, there is a big
[42:20] difference between the church and the
[42:22] bride. Amen. Amen. The bride comes from
[42:26] God and your destiny is your origin.
[42:29] Amen. And there is a church and I always
[42:32] want to say there is still time to say
[42:34] whosoever will let him come. There's
[42:37] still time to evangelize. There's still
[42:39] time to search the lost sheep. But you
[42:41] cannot preach somebody into into the
[42:43] bride.
[42:45] Nobody can preach you into it. Nobody
[42:47] can preach you out of it. I mean, you
[42:49] were part of his thinking in what form
[42:52] ever? And you expressed on this earth.
[42:55] And I tell you one thing, maybe you
[42:57] think you came wrong on this earth, but
[42:59] you will leave the right way.
[43:02] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon makes it
[43:03] like this. And I remember how brother
[43:05] Beckett, I know I was preaching it
[43:06] already, but let me follow the the
[43:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost uh in that
[43:10] thing. God, brother Ram said, before the
[43:12] foundation of the world, God made a
[43:14] picture of his family. And here we
[43:18] were. Therefore, brother, if you know
[43:20] who you are, there's no need to become
[43:22] arrogant.
[43:24] There's no need for superior complexes
[43:26] or inferior complex. You are who you
[43:29] are. You we don't have time to play the
[43:32] victim card. I mean, we are overcomers
[43:35] by our father. Okay? And God took our
[43:38] souls and throwed us on seven continents
[43:42] on seven church ages. He put part of
[43:45] himself into us. Amen. Because because
[43:48] David said God made everything wonderful
[43:51] in his time. He even placed eternity
[43:54] into our hearts. And there's only one
[43:56] who is eternal. That's God. God placed
[43:59] eternal part of himself into us. And he
[44:02] throwed us into life. And God is knows
[44:05] one thing. When seven church ages are
[44:08] over, the whole family of God will be
[44:09] there.
[44:11] Nobody is missing. And brother Brandon
[44:13] was the first messenger who could say,
[44:15] "God is not anymore complete without
[44:18] you." Amen.
[44:20] I tell you, nobody can preach you out of
[44:23] it. Nobody can preach you into it. It's
[44:25] glorious.
[44:27] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[44:29] angel, the mystery.
[44:31] Amen. The mystery. Amen. Amen. Amen. God
[44:34] has a family. God has a has a part that
[44:37] was taken out of him and he takes that
[44:40] part back to himself. Amen. Can you say
[44:42] amen? Amen. So, so, so, so let me let me
[44:47] make it a little bit
[44:48] sophisticated. We all know that only
[44:51] species of the same category can marry.
[44:55] The rest is perversion. A cat can only
[44:57] marry a cat. A dog can only marry a dog.
[45:00] A human being can only marry a human
[45:02] being if not his sodomic condition. You
[45:05] understand what I want to say? Now, if
[45:07] God wants to marry, who can he marry?
[45:11] Himself.
[45:13] God can only marry himself.
[45:16] Amen. That part we we hear faith comeths
[45:18] from hearing hearing of the words. But
[45:20] it's not only the words here. It's the
[45:22] word that God placed here. Brother Ramy
[45:24] said the deep calls to the deep. Amen.
[45:28] That means we are not better than
[45:31] denominations.
[45:32] We're not better. We're not better
[45:34] people. No. There's no way for us to be
[45:36] arrogant. We are over that time. You
[45:39] know, when we were younger, we were
[45:40] cursing everyone. Now we became older.
[45:42] We are blessing everyone because we are
[45:44] seed of Abraham. We are we are we are
[45:46] born to bless. Amen. You have a nice you
[45:48] have you have a friendly person at the
[45:50] gas station. He helps you. God bless you
[45:53] because we are seed of Abraham. We are
[45:55] born to bless. Amen. Amen. It's a
[45:58] special type. It's no need to for
[46:00] arrogance. No need. You will not help
[46:02] people by despising them. Give him a
[46:04] helping hand. Give him a give him give
[46:06] him a little bit of love. Can you say
[46:08] amen? Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46:11] Family of God. We are not only church.
[46:14] Amen. We are we are we are the
[46:15] expression of God. His thoughts made
[46:18] flesh in our life. Amen. Please make the
[46:21] next one. Now
[46:23] God that's what brother Bam said just a
[46:26] little dew drop. I don't know too much
[46:29] about chemistry but it must be that
[46:31] decongelling of humidity under stand or
[46:34] atmosphere. And when the nights get dark
[46:37] and cold, it falls from heaven and drops
[46:39] upon the ground. It fell from somewhere.
[46:43] But the next morning before the sun
[46:45] comes up, it's laying there. Little
[46:47] fellow shivering. But just let the sun
[46:50] come up watching go shining. It's happy.
[46:52] Why? The sun is going to call it right
[46:56] back from where it come from. Oh, that's
[46:58] the way with a Christian. Hallelujah. We
[47:01] know when we walk into the presence of
[47:02] God, something in us tells us that we
[47:05] come from somewhere and we are going
[47:07] back again by the power that's pulling
[47:10] us. The little dew drop, it glistens and
[47:13] shines and shouts because he knows he
[47:15] come from up there and the sun is going
[47:17] to draw him right back up again. And the
[47:20] man that's an attribute of God born of
[47:22] God knows hallelujah when he come in
[47:24] contact with the son of God he's going
[47:26] to be draw up from from here someday for
[47:30] if I be lifted up from the earth all
[47:32] draw I will draw all men unto me. Now
[47:36] please understand in our time brother
[47:40] Benham was a was a was a was was a was a
[47:43] star in the night. He was a seventh
[47:45] angel. But 1964 he starts this year. He
[47:49] said
[47:50] shalom. Good morning. Good morning
[47:53] church. In Finnish youana good morning.
[47:56] What does it mean? The night is over.
[47:59] The sun went up. What time do we live?
[48:02] It's the rising of the sun calling us
[48:04] back. Amen. It there's a man who can
[48:08] turn on the lights.
[48:10] Please understand we don't talk about
[48:12] any predestination of our physical being
[48:16] but the word attribute our true identity
[48:20] the one who lives on the inside.
[48:22] Amen. Can you say amen? Please
[48:26] understand if you understand that the
[48:29] great person in our generation is not
[48:32] William Brham. It's the Lord Jesus
[48:34] Christ. Therefore we are not
[48:36] Brenhammites. We are not Brandon fan
[48:39] club.
[48:41] Not at all. Amen. Look at this. Amen.
[48:43] This message does not come from America.
[48:47] I'm hope I'm not hurting anybody any
[48:49] feeling. This message comes from the
[48:51] presence of Almighty. That's what the
[48:53] angel told brother Brandham. Brother
[48:55] Brandham was just a voice. Amen. But the
[48:58] postman, if if if if you receive a
[49:01] letter from your beloved, you will not
[49:03] embrace the postman. You will not kiss
[49:05] the postman. I mean you will kiss the
[49:07] one who sent the letter. There was not
[49:09] William Brandham. He was just a voice
[49:11] but the Lord Jesus Christ sent the
[49:13] letter.
[49:15] Brother I tell you one thing this
[49:16] message is not a cult. Why should we
[49:18] become cultish? It's not a denomination.
[49:21] Why should we now apply denominational
[49:24] nonsense? Have a little bit cold war
[49:26] with him and cold war with that. The
[49:28] bride has cold war with no one. We are
[49:31] body. I mean we have our differences but
[49:33] we learn to respect people of God. Can
[49:35] you say amen? This message is not a
[49:38] sect. Why should it become sectarian?
[49:40] What is this message? Our father.
[49:44] Our father talking to us. Can you say
[49:46] amen? Do you love the voice behind the
[49:49] voice? I tell you one thing. We Germans,
[49:52] we we are not crying fast. Only in
[49:55] football, in soccer, that's when we cry.
[49:58] Okay. But I want to ask you one thing.
[50:00] Even if you're some tough guy, some real
[50:02] hunters and fishers, whatever. Didn't we
[50:04] all cry when we when we were reading the
[50:06] life story of brother Brandon? We were
[50:08] all crying because that was our story.
[50:10] That is our true family. That is part of
[50:13] us. Can you say amen? So here please
[50:16] make the next one. So we came on this
[50:21] earth and brother Brandham explained it
[50:24] like
[50:24] this. Your birth was pre-planned.
[50:30] God did not only know that you would be
[50:32] here, but your birth was pre-planned.
[50:34] And brother Bram said, in things that
[50:35] are to be, he said, for many
[50:38] generations. Therefore, God protected
[50:42] your
[50:43] seed over seven church ages. Therefore,
[50:47] brother Blame said the the the virgin
[50:50] birth is not as mysterious as the
[50:52] natural birth because you must that is
[50:55] no Marcus. Okay? But God had to pay
[50:59] attention on your look because you must
[51:01] look like your theophony.
[51:04] Brother Ram said me had the same black
[51:06] hair on the other side as he has on this
[51:08] side. But that's no Marcus. Okay? If you
[51:10] see a difference, that's accepted. Okay?
[51:13] So be sure be happy about your color.
[51:17] Be happy about your about your outward
[51:19] expression. Be happy about your culture.
[51:22] Please understand, we don't preach to
[51:24] colors. We talk to theophanes to the
[51:27] inner body to the inner person. Don't
[51:29] let nobody give you minority a minor
[51:32] complex. I am the way how my creator
[51:34] made me. Blessed be the name of the
[51:37] lord. I have some I have I take care of
[51:40] a little outreach just on 20 30 people
[51:42] but a lot of Africans good people really
[51:43] wonderful. Okay. And we're good friends
[51:46] and they are young people. They are
[51:47] ministers. They consider me a little bit
[51:48] as their mentor as their I helped in the
[51:50] ministry but they I'm always in the
[51:52] minority. And I always said and boys
[51:55] remember white life
[52:00] matters. But look at this. So we came in
[52:04] this earth in a body that we don't like.
[52:08] Amen. Amen. I'm when I when I when I
[52:11] wake up in the morning and I look in the
[52:12] mirror, I said, "I don't know you, but I
[52:14] wash you anyhow." Okay. We came into
[52:17] families that we don't
[52:18] like. I come from a broken family. I
[52:21] come from a dysfunctional family. and
[52:23] you hated yourself. Amen. I had no
[52:26] father. My my family was divorced. I
[52:28] know what it means to be
[52:30] underprivileged. But I tell you one
[52:31] thing, when I gave my life, I was 14
[52:33] years old and I had cancer like a
[52:35] leukemia. I had I I was not I was not I
[52:38] was not unhappy to die because there was
[52:41] no vision for me. I said, "Okay, if I'm
[52:44] life is miserable anyhow." Okay. And I
[52:46] was saved I think for a purpose. And
[52:48] when I came to the Lord Jesus, I was in
[52:50] my age of 20 21. God revealed to me that
[52:53] he was my father.
[52:55] And I said, I'm the most privileged
[52:57] people on this earth. I have a friend in
[53:00] life. I have a father. I have a family.
[53:03] Amen. Maybe not on this earth, but I
[53:04] have a heavenly family. I'm not alone.
[53:07] Amen. Can you say amen? But we came into
[53:10] situation that we were not choosing.
[53:13] Amen. Amen. So God pre-planned our
[53:16] birth. Your grandfather could not die in
[53:20] World War I because your father was in
[53:22] him. Your father could not die by the by
[53:25] the Hitler boys. No way. Because you
[53:28] were still in him. I remember I told you
[53:31] already last time when I was years ago
[53:32] here, there was that kind of uh uh
[53:36] Veterans Day. And Veterans Day, you get
[53:39] something for free in in the
[53:41] restaurants. And here's the old veteran
[53:44] looking at me uh looking bar did you
[53:48] serve and and I want to say yes but I
[53:50] was on the wrong side but but I didn't
[53:53] dare to do that because I was one of the
[53:55] you understand but look I mean we we can
[53:59] understand the Bible if you understand
[54:01] our father so here we have two famous
[54:06] players France Beckenbau and Bertie
[54:09] Folks and the thing is is both had the
[54:12] same success in
[54:14] football both world champions as players
[54:18] and as coaches but Mr. Beckenbar was
[54:22] always self-confident okay when he was
[54:26] losing a match he was asked Mr.
[54:28] Beckenbar what was the reason for the
[54:30] losing of the match for the defeat he
[54:32] said what's the heck next match we will
[54:35] win what's what's your problem okay now
[54:37] Mr. folks. No, he was always explaining
[54:40] himself. He was always insecure of
[54:42] himself and yeah, you must understand uh
[54:45] the defense was not uh as they should
[54:47] and the midfield players we had
[54:49] technical problems. We have to solve
[54:51] this and they had to find out what was
[54:54] the difference between both because both
[54:56] had the same success and they found out
[54:59] it lays in their youth because Mr.
[55:02] Beckenbower comes from a wealthy
[55:05] family and he his his uncle was already
[55:08] a player. That means he he
[55:11] heard all the time boy your name is
[55:14] Beckenbower you make it you always
[55:16] better than the rest because already of
[55:19] the genes and Mr. Folks, he had no
[55:21] father no mother. He lost his parents.
[55:25] And they found out he he was missing
[55:27] some kind like a bonding. They call it
[55:29] bonding between the parents and the
[55:31] children which is so important for the
[55:34] personality of a of a young man. He
[55:37] needs that bonding. It gives him
[55:40] stability in life. Okay. And and and and
[55:44] I want to say this. Therefore, it's to
[55:47] to solve the problem of our day. We need
[55:49] the bonding to our heavenly father.
[55:53] And for 2,000 years, we didn't
[55:55] understand our father. We thought he's a
[55:56] dictator. We thought he's never
[55:59] satisfied. We thought he
[56:01] is. He was always criticized in the
[56:04] church. And God had to reveal who the
[56:06] father is. That we come into a
[56:09] relationship. We become happy people.
[56:12] Can you say amen?
[56:14] So, so, so therefore the picture is so
[56:17] important. The message that we believe
[56:19] is not a doctrine. It's a relationship.
[56:23] It's a relationship. Amen. How can we
[56:26] become how can we make our children
[56:28] happy if we're not happy? How can we
[56:31] become good ministers if we all ch if we
[56:34] always chased our own tail? No, we must
[56:37] arrive somewhere. Here I am. Here I
[56:40] stand. I don't have to prove nothing.
[56:42] I'm a son of God. My father loves me
[56:44] exactly the way I'm a bad preacher, but
[56:46] I have a theophony. Amen. Amen. I'm a
[56:48] bad singer, but I have a theophony. Can
[56:51] you say amen? Amen. Blessed be the name
[56:53] of the Lord. Amen. So, we see the
[56:56] bonding
[56:58] explains. And here is Mrs. Joyce Meyer.
[57:02] And he she's not a message believer, but
[57:05] I can tell you one thing. If you have
[57:07] the Holy Ghost, you can learn from every
[57:08] person. You can learn from every person.
[57:12] There the time is over when we were
[57:13] despising everyone. And if you're not in
[57:15] the message, you are nothing. you are
[57:17] just sort of no no people have insights.
[57:20] Okay. So she she is a a prosperity
[57:24] gospel minister. We are not agreeing in
[57:26] that. Not at all. You see but I had to
[57:28] look her up because we had some fans
[57:30] that that that that liked her because we
[57:32] had some visitors in our church. And her
[57:35] life is she was abused as a child from
[57:38] her own father nearly every day. Child
[57:42] abuse, sexual
[57:43] abuse. and she throwed away her own life
[57:47] and she said and her life testimony is
[57:49] how the Lord Jesus find her and and and
[57:52] and and healed her in a
[57:54] denomination. I thought by myself if the
[57:57] Lord Jesus can do a thing like this in a
[57:59] denomination, how can he do things in
[58:01] the message of the hour?
[58:03] There's healing power in the word.
[58:05] There's healing power. If God can do
[58:07] this in a Baptist church, why can't he
[58:09] do this in our church?
[58:12] Definitely. So, and then she said
[58:13] something that I never forget in my
[58:15] life. She says, "People who got hurt do
[58:18] silly things." That's the reason that
[58:21] people act the way they act. That's the
[58:24] people That's the reason people react
[58:26] the way they act. Mostly it's hurted
[58:29] feelings. That's right. Amen. Takes a
[58:31] little bit of of of balm of Gilead. I
[58:34] told I told brother brother Paul, you
[58:37] see, as I was taking care of the young
[58:39] people, you always have to deal with
[58:41] people who leave the message or leave
[58:43] the local
[58:46] church. And I always make them I always
[58:49] let them know, look, when we were
[58:51] brothers before, then we're still
[58:54] brothers because it's not a question of
[58:56] membership to a local place. We talk
[58:58] about the family of God. Okay? So I I
[59:02] from time to time I send him a little
[59:03] note. I said, "How brother brother, how
[59:06] are you
[59:07] doing? I I'm not exaggerating, but I
[59:10] show you that that the drama in in our
[59:12] places." He's writing back, "Brother
[59:14] Marcus, I wasn't in church on Sunday." I
[59:17] said, "That wasn't my question. I
[59:18] understand I'm over 50, but I'm not as
[59:20] old as you think. I understand
[59:22] perfectly." But that wasn't my question.
[59:24] My question is, "How are you doing,
[59:26] brother Marcus? I'm back next Sunday." I
[59:28] said, I think by myself he's not back
[59:30] because if a person wants to come back,
[59:31] he doesn't write that he will be back.
[59:32] He will be there.
[59:34] Amen. But you see, young people think
[59:37] when a minister contacts them, the only
[59:39] question that he has is, "Where were you
[59:41] on Sunday?" And I'm writing back. I
[59:43] said, "Hey, you're a human being. Can I
[59:45] help you? Can I do something for you?"
[59:47] Amen. And and and and and sometimes the
[59:50] boys are speechless because they think
[59:51] once they leave the church, we have to
[59:53] despite them. No, we have to take our
[59:54] arms around them. Amen. You're not
[59:57] helping people by despising them. You're
[59:59] not helping them. Amen. God has to call
[1:00:02] them back in his time. Don't you see how
[1:00:04] how how beautiful the Lord Jesus is? I
[1:00:07] mean, here is here is that prodigal son.
[1:00:10] That was his mistake. A righteous living
[1:00:13] a red light districts. And that was his
[1:00:16] problem. But but you see there's two
[1:00:20] miracles that happened. The first
[1:00:22] miracle that comes is that the Bible
[1:00:24] says and the boy came to himself. People
[1:00:28] say, "Brother Marcus, where are the
[1:00:29] miracles in the message?" We are the
[1:00:31] miracles. That's what the Bible says.
[1:00:33] Israel here, O Israel, you are the
[1:00:35] miracles and you are a sign. Your life
[1:00:38] is a miracle.
[1:00:40] Amen. There was no deacon coming. No,
[1:00:43] there was no minister coming. Amen.
[1:00:46] There was God reminding him, hey, don't
[1:00:48] forget you have a father. And the first
[1:00:52] the first revelation that this boy had
[1:00:54] was not I have a message church. I have
[1:00:56] brother Brandham. No, he said I have a
[1:00:59] father and my father is a great man.
[1:01:03] Can you say amen? Please, if you come
[1:01:06] into the house of the Lord, come into
[1:01:07] the house of your father and say here I
[1:01:10] am. Sometime have you ever have you ever
[1:01:13] had that situation that you really felt
[1:01:16] bad really and the thoughts are bad and
[1:01:18] you really and then you hear a voice
[1:01:20] which says especially on Wednesday uh uh
[1:01:23] don't go to church some we have a little
[1:01:26] bit and the voice is oh it's a pandemia
[1:01:28] no no you cannot go to church you have
[1:01:31] you ever heard that voice which when you
[1:01:33] really felt bad that this voice said no
[1:01:35] stay at home you're not a blessing for
[1:01:36] the people can you say
[1:01:38] amen word that voice speaks English and
[1:01:41] German. I hear it in German. You hear it
[1:01:44] in English. But I tell you one thing, if
[1:01:46] Satan tells you to stay home, you'd say,
[1:01:48] "Satan, you stay home." I tell you one
[1:01:51] thing, you're not becoming more
[1:01:52] spiritual by staying home. That's the
[1:01:54] moment you come into the house of the
[1:01:56] father and say, "Heavenly Father,
[1:01:57] everything went wrong. I'm in a complete
[1:01:59] disaster, but you are my help." Amen.
[1:02:02] You are my all in all. Can you say amen?
[1:02:06] So, please make the next one. Now to
[1:02:10] understand I I made that little
[1:02:12] introduction to show the precision of
[1:02:15] God, the precision because brother Bram
[1:02:19] said when it comes to the 144,000,
[1:02:21] brother Bram said they don't know who
[1:02:23] they are, but God knows all of them. For
[1:02:27] 6,000 years or 2,000 years, God was
[1:02:31] following every seed line.
[1:02:34] The precision of God. Look now here's
[1:02:36] brother Brandon. Okay. Now you must
[1:02:40] understand your life in my life. We have
[1:02:44] divinity in humanity.
[1:02:47] Have patience with yourself.
[1:02:50] Don't expect too much from yourself.
[1:02:53] Once that we are that one that we don't
[1:02:55] have much too much illusions about
[1:02:58] ourself, we lose illusions about our
[1:03:00] brother because my brother is fighting
[1:03:03] the same fight that I fight. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:06] Exactly. So here's brother planet man
[1:03:08] and he is a tremendous man but he had
[1:03:11] some little complexes and you see him
[1:03:14] standing beside Ara Robert and if you
[1:03:16] see the whole picture he stands like
[1:03:18] this. He realized he's a short man and
[1:03:22] you must understand especially the young
[1:03:24] people at home I'm a little bit sometime
[1:03:26] a coach for them. You must understand we
[1:03:29] live in time of psychological warfare.
[1:03:33] You wake up in the morning, you have
[1:03:34] strange thoughts from immoral thoughts
[1:03:37] up to up to up to all kind that you that
[1:03:39] you're a loser and you everything. You
[1:03:43] wake up that morning and I'm sure I'm
[1:03:44] not the only one. That's the moment when
[1:03:47] you take every spirit under the control
[1:03:50] of the Lord Jesus Christ because here
[1:03:53] comes brother Brandon was at was there
[1:03:55] were two messengers that were
[1:03:56] outstanding.
[1:03:58] One was Paul who was laying a foundation
[1:04:02] and the seventh one was brother Brandham
[1:04:04] who brought down the
[1:04:05] capstone. None of the messengers had the
[1:04:08] authority like William Brandham. None
[1:04:11] could come who going into a room and
[1:04:13] says I take now every spirit under my
[1:04:15] control for the glory and honor of God.
[1:04:17] None of them had had the authority. But
[1:04:19] here comes he passes by Oral Roberts
[1:04:23] University and he sees that great statue
[1:04:25] and he thinks about himself having just
[1:04:28] one typewriter and this man has a big
[1:04:30] university and he starts feeling sorry
[1:04:33] for himself and he says and I heard the
[1:04:36] voice which told me you God could not
[1:04:38] trust your money look a man who took
[1:04:41] every spirit under his control believes
[1:04:44] a lie of Satan. Don't you understand
[1:04:46] that we sometime believe in the lies of
[1:04:49] Satan too? Don't trust your own
[1:04:52] thoughts. No, I don't trust my own
[1:04:53] thoughts. You see, and then God had to
[1:04:56] intervene. He said, "Look up. I'm your
[1:04:59] portion." That's therefore we come to
[1:05:02] church. Therefore, we come to hear about
[1:05:04] eternal things. Can you say amen? That
[1:05:08] our father can talk to us. So, here is a
[1:05:10] man, brother Ben. He was together with
[1:05:14] great men Jack Moore, Gordon Lindseay,
[1:05:17] Aubra Roberts. Most of them they were in
[1:05:21] Bible school. They could talk Greek,
[1:05:24] Latin,
[1:05:27] Hebrew. And Brother Brandon was just how
[1:05:30] he calls himself, a hillbilly.
[1:05:34] and he said this and they they made him
[1:05:38] know that they didn't have much respect
[1:05:40] for the man William Brandon saying you
[1:05:43] don't know your Bible very much and we
[1:05:45] all know that brother Brandham says I
[1:05:48] don't know my Bible very much but I know
[1:05:50] the author very well and we always
[1:05:52] thought in a Pentecostal way yes and the
[1:05:55] power of miracles and the power of his
[1:05:58] resurrection but I want to tell you
[1:06:01] this if I write a
[1:06:04] book and you know
[1:06:06] me, you understand the book.
[1:06:10] You must understand how I think to
[1:06:13] understand my book. It's for example,
[1:06:15] make a little make a little example. You
[1:06:18] don't know me and I make a certain joke.
[1:06:22] If you know me, you understand it's a
[1:06:23] joke. But if you don't know me, you can
[1:06:26] take that serious. You see? Therefore,
[1:06:28] with friends, you can make jokes. You
[1:06:30] can speak ironically. with strangers you
[1:06:33] cannot do. You must understand the
[1:06:36] person to understand his language. Can
[1:06:39] you say amen? In other words, if you
[1:06:41] don't know the nature of God, you will
[1:06:43] never be able to read the Bible.
[1:06:46] You will never understand to read the
[1:06:47] message. You bring people into any kind
[1:06:50] of an extreme.
[1:06:53] Can you say amen? You must first
[1:06:56] understand the author, his nature, his
[1:07:00] way of thinking. Amen. And then you can
[1:07:03] understand the Bible and then we can
[1:07:05] understand the message of the hour.
[1:07:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord. That
[1:07:09] means brother Brmond said that means
[1:07:10] this book can be revealed to anyone but
[1:07:14] a special class of people. It will take
[1:07:17] one with prophetic insight. It will
[1:07:20] require the ability to hear from God. It
[1:07:23] will require supernatural instruction.
[1:07:26] Not just a student comparing verse with
[1:07:29] verse. though that's good but a mystery
[1:07:32] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:07:34] it never becomes clear how we need to
[1:07:37] hear from God and lay ourselves open
[1:07:39] become yield to the spirit to hear and
[1:07:41] know brother
[1:07:45] therefore we have to learn the doctrine
[1:07:48] of the message but we must understand
[1:07:51] that our personality has to grow with
[1:07:54] that doctrine if not we have a sort I
[1:07:57] mean with a childish Holy Spirit. It
[1:08:01] takes maturity. It takes personality. It
[1:08:04] takes integrity. It takes a person who
[1:08:07] who who who leaves childish things away.
[1:08:11] Therefore, brother Brian
[1:08:13] never God never took away the new birth
[1:08:17] from the Pentecostals. Never. Amen.
[1:08:20] Because he said you cannot teach
[1:08:22] Pentecostal babies supernatural things.
[1:08:24] A baby is born again, but you cannot
[1:08:27] marry a baby. Amen. The rapture is not
[1:08:30] for spiritual teenagers. It's not for
[1:08:32] babies. It's for mature people. She
[1:08:35] knows who she is. Amen. That's the
[1:08:37] opening of the word. She finds her situ
[1:08:39] her position. Definitely. So God is
[1:08:43] revealing constantly himself to his
[1:08:46] bride. Service by service, he shows more
[1:08:50] of himself. And once you understand how
[1:08:52] your father is, you understand that's
[1:08:54] me. That's right. That's the person
[1:08:56] that's that's my image in which I'm
[1:08:58] changed. Brother says that this message
[1:09:01] has transforming power. We were we were
[1:09:04] unbelievers. And I I think I showed you
[1:09:06] last time already. We were we were just
[1:09:08] we didn't have we didn't we had didn't
[1:09:10] we we didn't we didn't go to church. My
[1:09:12] family was a was a broken
[1:09:14] family. I was I was I was fan of Arnold
[1:09:17] Schwatzenegger and Sylvester
[1:09:19] Stallone. And I saw one time Arnold
[1:09:22] Schwatzenegger making that brush muscle.
[1:09:25] M so I started bodybuilding and I tell
[1:09:29] you one thing and for you elder brothers
[1:09:30] that is a great help. Everything that
[1:09:32] you see here was
[1:09:34] here. It's just a change of
[1:09:37] dispensation. Change but everything that
[1:09:40] here was here. Therefore we tell the
[1:09:42] young people it's not not wrong to make
[1:09:44] sport but invest in your soul too. Can
[1:09:47] you say amen?
[1:09:49] Amen. So what happens is this. When I
[1:09:52] came to the Lord Jesus, we were standing
[1:09:54] on the street and on testify and people
[1:09:58] come to us and say, "Look, this is just
[1:10:00] psychology. This is just making up your
[1:10:02] mind. There is no Jesus. There's no
[1:10:04] nothing." And I could tell, "Boy, you
[1:10:06] come too late. I can tell you what the
[1:10:08] Lord Jesus did in my life. You come too
[1:10:10] late. It's not a theory for me. I see
[1:10:13] how the Lord Jesus changed my life." And
[1:10:15] look, and we came into the messy and we
[1:10:17] didn't see the signification of William
[1:10:19] Brham to be honest with you. No, not in
[1:10:21] the beginning. It took us some years to
[1:10:22] see the importance of it, the opening of
[1:10:24] the word. But today, you must understand
[1:10:28] it's it it changed from the messenger to
[1:10:30] the message, from the prophet to the
[1:10:33] prophecy. People come to me and said,
[1:10:35] "Brother Marcus, yes, but there were not
[1:10:37] 13 people fell from that bridge, but 20
[1:10:40] people." And brother Brian was wrong. I
[1:10:42] said, "Look, again, I tell you one
[1:10:44] thing, boy, you're too late because I
[1:10:46] experienced the changing power of this
[1:10:49] message. I'm not anymore interested in
[1:10:52] the messenger, but I see how this
[1:10:55] message changed me. I can just say I
[1:10:58] will not argue with you, but you're too
[1:11:00] late. You're just too late. Can you say
[1:11:03] amen? So, blessed be the name of the
[1:11:06] Lord. This is soul building. This is
[1:11:08] character building. This is personality
[1:11:10] building. This message changes us into
[1:11:13] our true image. takes away our
[1:11:16] complexes, our our our our bad
[1:11:19] upbringing or whatever. Okay, so please
[1:11:22] so we understand. I repeat myself as a
[1:11:25] little
[1:11:26] thing. It takes supernatural
[1:11:29] instruction. Not the best speaker is the
[1:11:32] one who understands God. That's right.
[1:11:35] Amen. This message is not a seminary.
[1:11:38] It's not it's not you want to have a
[1:11:41] fight. I have some
[1:11:43] quotes. That time is over. That was our
[1:11:45] child. That that that that was our our
[1:11:47] John Wayne time. Okay. Okay. Should
[1:11:50] first shoot then. This message is a love
[1:11:54] letter. Can you say amen? This message
[1:11:57] is holy to us. Because it's our father
[1:12:00] revealing
[1:12:01] himself. If somebody doesn't agree, I
[1:12:04] say that's fine for me. All is good. But
[1:12:06] for me, it's so precious. Maybe it's not
[1:12:08] your love letter, but for me it means a
[1:12:09] lot. And I know I talked to people who
[1:12:11] feel exactly the same thing. Okay. So,
[1:12:15] so it's not for the most anointed ones,
[1:12:18] but it's for the one who loves the Lord
[1:12:21] Jesus. The more you love him, the more
[1:12:23] you have him. Revelation is not a
[1:12:26] question of intelligence. It's a
[1:12:28] question of love. God reveals himself
[1:12:32] more and more. He speaks the mystery
[1:12:34] into the ears of his brides. And she
[1:12:37] will not boast about this. She will be
[1:12:40] feel so privileged about it. So can you
[1:12:43] say amen? Please make the next one. So
[1:12:45] we
[1:12:47] understand understanding God. You see
[1:12:51] now here is Jesus of Nazareth and he is
[1:12:54] a tremendous man and we understand that
[1:12:57] the Pharisee had to find an answer. So
[1:13:00] they had their little gathering. They
[1:13:02] come together and there was quite some
[1:13:06] debates and everybody went his way and
[1:13:08] they said and they answered and said
[1:13:10] unto him are thy also of Galilee search
[1:13:14] and look for out of Galilee arises no
[1:13:16] prophet and everyone every man went unto
[1:13:19] his own house. So the Pharisees come
[1:13:22] together and they leave that little uh
[1:13:24] ministers meeting and everybody is
[1:13:26] writing to the nexus uncchristianizing
[1:13:28] him. Yes, but because you don't
[1:13:30] understand and you don't understand. But
[1:13:32] the thing is, please understand and put
[1:13:34] on the spiritual jacket. Jesus of
[1:13:36] Nazareth was never Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:13:39] That was not his name. That was his
[1:13:41] nickname. And I and and if I use some
[1:13:44] some words, please understand that my
[1:13:46] range of words is limited. Jesus of
[1:13:48] Nazareth never was even the angel came
[1:13:51] to Mary and says, "You are searching
[1:13:54] Jesus of Nazareth." I mean, that was not
[1:13:56] his name. It was his fake name because
[1:13:59] he was Jesus of Bethlehem. He was not
[1:14:03] born in Galilee. He was born in
[1:14:05] Bethlehem in the bread house of God.
[1:14:08] Amen. Therefore, his true name is Jesus
[1:14:10] of Bethlehem because the city indicates
[1:14:14] your birth. He was not born in Ba in
[1:14:16] Galilee. He had to go in the city of
[1:14:19] David according to the story. Amen.
[1:14:22] Therefore, his true name is Jesus of
[1:14:24] Bethlehem. But if they if they would
[1:14:27] have known that he was born in
[1:14:28] Bethlehem, he could they would directly
[1:14:30] see it in the scripture. So God hides
[1:14:33] himself behind a nickname. Calls himself
[1:14:36] Jesus of Galile Jesus of Nazareth. He
[1:14:38] was never born in Nazareth. He was grown
[1:14:41] up in Nazareth. You understand? Can you
[1:14:44] say amen? God hiding himself. Amen. He's
[1:14:48] Jesus of Na Bethlehem. Therefore, by the
[1:14:50] blame seed, why little Bethlehem?
[1:14:53] Amen. He was never Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:14:55] Raised up in Nazareth, but not born in
[1:14:57] Nazareth. Amen. But God loves to
[1:15:02] confound. God loves this to hide himself
[1:15:04] behind little things and let the
[1:15:07] scoffers discuss and let them write
[1:15:09] their email. And God says, "Look,
[1:15:11] there's a little re revelation behind
[1:15:13] it, but I only re reveal it to my
[1:15:15] children. Don't be nervous by scoffers.
[1:15:18] They have their place." Can you say,
[1:15:20] "Amen." So you understand, please. The
[1:15:22] next next make the next one. So we
[1:15:24] understand that now a prophet
[1:15:28] is now sometime God can talk to a
[1:15:32] prophet and the prophet repeats what he
[1:15:35] hears. Okay. Or what he feels. Okay. For
[1:15:40] example, let me say let me be brother.
[1:15:42] Yeah, brother B. That sense. And I said
[1:15:44] for example uh uh take brother Paul I
[1:15:49] see you.
[1:15:51] You come from a place with a lot of
[1:15:54] seas. Okay. And I'm hearing this. Okay.
[1:15:57] And you are a pastor. Yes. And and and
[1:16:01] you're a musicians. Not a good one, but
[1:16:03] a
[1:16:06] musician. Now you have to have lamb's
[1:16:08] nature, brother Paul.
[1:16:11] Okay. And your name is Lafantine. Is it
[1:16:14] all true? Raise up your hands. Okay.
[1:16:16] That's all true. Okay. So the prophet
[1:16:18] hears it. But a prophet, God can speak
[1:16:21] through a prophet in the first first
[1:16:23] person. David says they pierced my
[1:16:26] hands. But it was not David who was
[1:16:29] pierced. It was Christ that was pierced.
[1:16:31] But David said never said he they
[1:16:32] pierced his hands. He they pierced my
[1:16:34] hands. So when brother Brandham says I
[1:16:37] will ride this trail again, it doesn't
[1:16:39] mean brother Brandham will come back.
[1:16:41] That with Christ riding this trail
[1:16:43] again. Can you say amen? Thousands of
[1:16:46] people in South America wait that
[1:16:48] brother Brandon comes to fulfill the
[1:16:49] tent vision and they say he will ride
[1:16:51] this trail again but he will ride this
[1:16:54] trail again through this to the bride.
[1:16:57] Can you say amen? It's Christ riding
[1:17:00] this trail again but through you and
[1:17:02] through me. Therefore the Bible doesn't
[1:17:04] say in the life of the seventh age in
[1:17:06] the days of the voice of the seven and
[1:17:08] the voice is still living. We are that
[1:17:10] voice. There will be a people who will
[1:17:13] be the final voice for the vital age
[1:17:16] under their messenger.
[1:17:19] Brother, we have no message of ourself.
[1:17:21] We are happy that we have a every every
[1:17:24] father is the head of his home. Every
[1:17:26] pastor is the head of a local church.
[1:17:28] Every messenger is the head of the of of
[1:17:30] of his church age and Christ is the head
[1:17:33] of all seven messengers. Sometime people
[1:17:35] ask me, "Brother, brother Marcus, does
[1:17:37] somebody have a right to correct a
[1:17:39] prophet?" They said, "Sure, God has a
[1:17:40] right."
[1:17:43] God is the head of all prophets. He
[1:17:44] corrects who he wants. Every prophet has
[1:17:47] a head. That's Christ himself. Can you
[1:17:49] say amen? So, so, so it's confounding,
[1:17:53] but we must understand God's way of
[1:17:56] speaking. That's right. Can you say
[1:17:58] amen? Therefore, we learned as
[1:18:00] ministers, whatever we believe, we make
[1:18:02] a comma. Maybe my vision was a little
[1:18:05] bit too small. Maybe I come back next
[1:18:07] year and I see the picture a little bit
[1:18:09] bigger. So never fight of little
[1:18:11] doctrinal things. Though the prophet
[1:18:14] said yes, but we must see the bigger
[1:18:16] picture. Can you say amen? And if we're
[1:18:19] humble, if we're simple, if we're not
[1:18:22] arrogant, God will just in his time will
[1:18:25] show us greater things. Blessed be the
[1:18:28] name of Please make the next one. So we
[1:18:30] understand, Amen. that the problem in in
[1:18:33] in in in
[1:18:34] in the in the thus say is the lord of
[1:18:37] denomination is it's too it's too uh
[1:18:42] it's too general it's like a horoscope.
[1:18:45] Okay. Now here we have Benny Hinn and he
[1:18:49] tries to to to to uh he tries to copy
[1:18:53] William Brandham.
[1:18:56] Okay. I see on this
[1:18:59] side marriage problems. I mean if you
[1:19:03] have 20
[1:19:06] couples
[1:19:08] okay so he says I see on this side heart
[1:19:13] problems. Yeah. I mean if you always eat
[1:19:15] McDonald's and have Tik Tok seven hours
[1:19:17] per day and don't move your cholesterol
[1:19:19] goes up. I understand. You see it's not
[1:19:21] a big mystery. So that's the problem.
[1:19:24] But here is a man by the name of
[1:19:28] Jonah and and he he he's not he's he he
[1:19:31] is he is precise. He said thus sayaith
[1:19:34] the Lord in 30 days
[1:19:39] in 30 days or or 40 days. Okay. And God
[1:19:44] postpones.
[1:19:46] Huh? It's thus says the Lord, but God
[1:19:49] postpones his own judgment. Here's what
[1:19:52] brother said. What about Jonah? Now all
[1:19:54] the quotes that I'm reading is in the
[1:19:55] message God judgment. God doesn't call a
[1:19:58] man to judgement with was first warning
[1:20:00] him. What about Jonah going through the
[1:20:02] streets saying oh the city is going to
[1:20:04] be destroyed within so many 40 days and
[1:20:06] then God didn't do it. See you have to
[1:20:09] watch. God don't always strike when he
[1:20:12] warns. But there is one thing then the
[1:20:15] prophet is mocked. And brother Benon
[1:20:17] continues there is one thing that can
[1:20:19] stop it. That's a quick repentance.
[1:20:22] Amen.
[1:20:24] God loves to forgive.
[1:20:28] That's his nature. God is even stopping
[1:20:31] his own judgment. If a person is ready
[1:20:34] to repent,
[1:20:36] brother, that that shows the nature of
[1:20:39] our father. Can you say amen? Now look
[1:20:42] at this. And and he is and we will see
[1:20:44] the example at the end of the service.
[1:20:45] God is not ashamed. Now here's for
[1:20:48] example, brother Marcus. So, brother
[1:20:51] Paul is not in his office and I see the
[1:20:53] cast of the church and I said, "Look,
[1:20:57] um, we can use it for German ways."
[1:21:00] Okay? And I'm stealing the money of the
[1:21:02] church. And here, for example, comes the
[1:21:05] pillar of fire. He says, "Thus says the
[1:21:07] Lord, because you stole the money of
[1:21:08] God, you will be dead in between of two
[1:21:12] weeks. Thus says the Lord." Now, two
[1:21:15] days
[1:21:16] later, and I don't talk about saying
[1:21:20] sorry. Sorry is not in the
[1:21:23] Bible. Sorry is making a little bit nice
[1:21:25] weather. But fruits of repentance and
[1:21:29] here's Mark and he really feels Lord,
[1:21:31] please forgive me. That was so wrong.
[1:21:34] Please forgive me. The next Sunday, the
[1:21:37] pillar of fire could come back and say,
[1:21:39] Marcus, everything is forgiven.
[1:21:41] God loves to forgive.
[1:21:45] Whatever you made the mistakes, you are
[1:21:46] never in a dead end. A person says
[1:21:49] sometime to me, "Brother Marcus, there's
[1:21:51] no way for me." God Jesus is the way.
[1:21:55] Amen. Can you say amen? If you have the
[1:21:57] Lord Jesus, you always have a way. Never
[1:22:00] give up. God will make a way where there
[1:22:04] seems to be no way. Judgment stops the
[1:22:08] wrath of God. Amen. Huh? Brother Blam
[1:22:12] says in the same message, "Here is
[1:22:13] people and they have already a black
[1:22:15] cloud over them. Death is already
[1:22:17] pronounced over them. If I can bring
[1:22:19] them to a point that they could promise
[1:22:22] to God, heavenly father, if I if you
[1:22:25] give me some more time, I I I I I will
[1:22:28] serve you with all my heart." God, he
[1:22:31] said, "Can okay, God can God can take
[1:22:35] that judgment away and give that person
[1:22:38] some more years.
[1:22:40] though the the black cloud is already
[1:22:44] over that person. Amen.
[1:22:49] Repentance right stops
[1:22:53] God. Every every Holy Ghost filled
[1:22:56] believer is ready to forgive
[1:23:00] all that thing of uh I cannot talk to
[1:23:02] sometime you have people they're not
[1:23:04] fussing okay but they are in cold war
[1:23:08] sometime there's churches even in cold
[1:23:09] war we don't hate our brother but you
[1:23:11] don't have time I don't have no no the
[1:23:13] bride cannot be in cold war I'm that is
[1:23:17] the thing sometime people cannot forgive
[1:23:20] because they have a doctrine of the
[1:23:22] message but they never knew what it
[1:23:23] means to be forgiven.
[1:23:26] Amen. Amen. But once you see what the
[1:23:29] Lord Jesus did for us, you can forgive
[1:23:30] your brother. You can you can say it
[1:23:32] still hurts, but brother, God forgave me
[1:23:34] so much things, so I will forgive you.
[1:23:36] Let's find a way together. Let's let's
[1:23:37] don't be stubborn. Can you say amen?
[1:23:40] Amen. Amen. It's no time for cold war.
[1:23:42] We're too way too far on the way. Amen.
[1:23:45] Hezekiah was told to make ready and get
[1:23:47] ready because he had to meet his maker.
[1:23:50] Now Hezekiah was a king, a great man.
[1:23:53] Did you notice it's
[1:23:54] clear? Lord, I beseech you to consider
[1:23:57] me. I have walked before you with a
[1:23:59] perfect heart. What a testimony to us.
[1:24:01] How we should a man walk before God.
[1:24:03] Even death was pronounced upon the man.
[1:24:06] And yet God changed his mind about him
[1:24:09] because Hezekiah wanted to do something
[1:24:11] and God said, "I would give you the
[1:24:13] desire of your heart." God does not
[1:24:16] change his mind about his word. That's
[1:24:19] very clear. But he changed his mind
[1:24:21] about situation. Let things come later
[1:24:24] than it was first prepared.
[1:24:27] God is not dogmatic.
[1:24:29] Amen. God is not a computer. God is a
[1:24:33] father. He loves his to he loves to give
[1:24:36] that second chance to his children. He
[1:24:38] loves to communicate. So never give up.
[1:24:41] Never give up. Can you say amen yet
[1:24:44] change his mind? Amen. Please make the
[1:24:47] next one. So can God can he count? Yeah.
[1:24:51] Amen. Please don't read. But you see God
[1:24:55] comes the precision of God. That's our
[1:24:57] father. I mean you have to understand
[1:24:59] the whole universe takes the
[1:25:03] universe. Amen. That's our
[1:25:05] father. Every planet stands there. Amen.
[1:25:10] God knows what he does. Amen. You see,
[1:25:13] can he count? Yeah, he can count. Amen.
[1:25:16] He's the author of of all physics, of
[1:25:19] all science. He's the author of it.
[1:25:21] Science is not contradictive to the
[1:25:23] message. Not at all. Medicine is not
[1:25:26] contradictive to the message. Not at
[1:25:27] all. Amen. So here he comes to Abraham.
[1:25:30] He says, "Look, 400 years you will be in
[1:25:33] a strange country. 400 years." God is
[1:25:37] specific. Speaks to Abraham. So now 400
[1:25:40] years is ready. God's time is ready. I'm
[1:25:43] according to your appointed time. Moses
[1:25:46] is ready and he goes and he is killing
[1:25:50] just that one Egyptians. And here's what
[1:25:52] brother Benham he explains. He said God
[1:25:55] was ready. Moses was ready but Israel
[1:25:58] was not ready.
[1:26:01] Amen. And God does not say
[1:26:04] okay. That's your problem. It's your
[1:26:06] problem. I sent you the I sent you the
[1:26:08] liberator. You don't want that's up to
[1:26:10] you. No. No. God is a father.
[1:26:13] He understands the situation. Takes
[1:26:16] Moses back. Okay. Gives him a nice wife
[1:26:19] to form him a little bit. Amen. And he
[1:26:22] gives him a nice Pharaoh to put on that
[1:26:25] pressure that when Moses will come the
[1:26:27] next time, they will be happy to go.
[1:26:30] Okay. He said, "Okay, I will give you
[1:26:32] some." Okay. You like to be here?
[1:26:33] Wonderful. You You reject Moses? That's
[1:26:35] very fine. Uh I will I will I will I
[1:26:38] will make that that that your suffer
[1:26:40] your your sufferings a little bit
[1:26:41] bigger. God does not give up. But God
[1:26:46] comes stops the judgment. Amen. Waits
[1:26:49] another 30 year though it's not in the
[1:26:52] plan of God because he said 400 but God
[1:26:57] changed his mind because the situation
[1:27:00] did not allow him to go. God thinks
[1:27:04] strategically.
[1:27:06] God waits until we are ready. Amen. God
[1:27:11] therefore sometime you have a good
[1:27:13] person. He's a good minister in a
[1:27:14] church. A young man. Amen. Sometime the
[1:27:17] boy is ready. God is ready but the
[1:27:19] church cannot receive him. So the boy
[1:27:22] needs just patience to sit and wait
[1:27:24] until God changes the heart of that
[1:27:27] church to receive it. There's great
[1:27:29] power in patience. Yeah, great power
[1:27:31] because God's gift find anyhow their
[1:27:34] place but never force nothing. God will
[1:27:36] not make a mistake. God doesn't give up
[1:27:40] because he's a pastor. A pastor cannot
[1:27:42] give up. Amen. Cannot. And father cannot
[1:27:46] give up. No way. God is the greatest
[1:27:49] father. He said he doesn't say okay now
[1:27:51] that's your problem. I send I kept my
[1:27:52] word. You do whatever you want. There's
[1:27:54] no up. No. He's a father. He said they
[1:27:57] are my children. I have to even break my
[1:27:59] own word, wait and come back. Did you
[1:28:04] know that before? God knows all things.
[1:28:08] Remember the Bible is the revelation of
[1:28:10] Jesus Christ. God wants to reveal his
[1:28:14] way of thinking.
[1:28:16] Can you say amen? Amen. Amen. Here it
[1:28:18] is. Now 1962 is this the sign of the
[1:28:22] answer. Amen. We have six dreams and we
[1:28:25] have the vision that brother Brandham
[1:28:26] had. Now the food, that was sister
[1:28:29] Collins's dream. Now the food, the bride
[1:28:32] isn't perfect, but the bridegroom is
[1:28:35] perfect. The bride is not perfect yet,
[1:28:38] but the food that was given being given
[1:28:41] was not literal food. It's spiritual
[1:28:43] food that you have been wave having all
[1:28:45] along. Now I want to ask you a question.
[1:28:48] Was the bride ready 1963 for the
[1:28:51] rapture?
[1:28:53] No. Was the bride ready 1965 for the
[1:28:56] rapture? She was not ready. Was the
[1:28:59] bride ready 1977 for the rapture? She
[1:29:01] was not ready. Was the bride ready in
[1:29:04] 2024 for the rapture? Was not ready.
[1:29:07] Brother Marcus, when will be the
[1:29:09] rapture? When the bride is ready and God
[1:29:13] will wait until all his children are
[1:29:15] ready to go. If it's tomorrow, if it's
[1:29:18] ne all the calculation, let's be honest
[1:29:21] with one another. All were wrong. All
[1:29:24] were wrong. Okay. When will be the
[1:29:26] rapture? When the bride is ready, we're
[1:29:28] going. Not one day before.
[1:29:33] Can you say amen? Amen. Was the bride
[1:29:36] ready 1977? No, it was not ready. Did
[1:29:39] God want to be them ready? Yeah. But he
[1:29:41] saw they are not ready. So what we have
[1:29:42] to do the same like for Israel the same
[1:29:46] biblical principle God breaks his own
[1:29:49] word so that his judgment so that it
[1:29:52] shouldn't come home. Have you ever
[1:29:54] thought about the ark of
[1:29:56] Noah all the animal must be in the ark.
[1:29:59] Okay. So here's the ice spear. Okay. He
[1:30:01] takes 30 years. Okay. To go to the ark.
[1:30:05] Okay. And here's the kangaroo coming
[1:30:07] from from from Australia. Okay. He's
[1:30:09] looking. He's just
[1:30:13] the pier of fire comes. He said, "Look,
[1:30:15] there's a flood coming and uh you follow
[1:30:18] the direction. I will send an angel
[1:30:20] before you. He will lead you." And the
[1:30:22] camel uh the the kangaroo takes his wife
[1:30:24] and said, "We have to go into the ark
[1:30:26] because destruction
[1:30:28] comes." God was not nervous. God didn't
[1:30:32] say at a certain point, "Okay, the ar
[1:30:33] the ark is now closed. That's your
[1:30:36] problem." No. Okay, I set a date. God
[1:30:39] doesn't set dates. God is waiting until
[1:30:42] every animal is in the ark. And God
[1:30:45] waits for the rapture till all his
[1:30:47] children are ready to go. Blessed be the
[1:30:49] name of the Lord. Can you say amen?
[1:30:53] Amen. Now, the bride isn't perfect. The
[1:30:56] bride isn't perfect until now because
[1:30:57] the rapture is when the bride is ready.
[1:30:59] Amen. Can you say amen? That is for me
[1:31:02] one biblical explanation how God
[1:31:05] sometimes says thus says the Lord and he
[1:31:07] doesn't fulfill. And people say the
[1:31:08] prophet was wrong. No, it was not wrong.
[1:31:10] You must read the Bible how God acted in
[1:31:13] the past. God is not dogmatic. He's he's
[1:31:16] he's he puts never a dogma over a soul.
[1:31:19] First the soul of a person. Can you say
[1:31:22] amen? That's our father. Amen.
[1:31:24] Therefore, he said legalism will never
[1:31:26] make it. You must understand God is a
[1:31:28] God of the second chance. Never wipe
[1:31:31] nobody off. Maybe God has another plan
[1:31:33] for him. Blessed be the name of the
[1:31:35] Lord. Hallelujah. I never wipe yourself
[1:31:38] off. Brother Marcus, will you make the
[1:31:40] rapture? I believe I make the rapture.
[1:31:43] How can you make it? By God's grace. By
[1:31:46] God's grace. I think it was Tony Upma
[1:31:49] who told us that story. You must
[1:31:50] understand the the the the the
[1:31:53] resurrection is an event and is a
[1:31:55] person. Jesus said, "I am the
[1:31:56] resurrection." The rapture is an event
[1:31:58] and is a person. The bride can say, "I
[1:32:00] am the rapture." Definitely. She is is
[1:32:03] is in her. He was one I think it was
[1:32:05] Tony Atma. He was in Canada and he was
[1:32:07] just running to the to the to to the to
[1:32:09] to the to to the plane and he was a man
[1:32:11] just walking beside him. He said, "Yes,
[1:32:13] we have to go to the plane." I think it
[1:32:15] was Calgary or Montreal or whatever and
[1:32:16] we come too late. And the man was a
[1:32:18] stranger said, "No, you don't come. You
[1:32:19] don't come too late. You make it with
[1:32:21] the plane." No, no, no. It's already
[1:32:23] boarding time. We don't make it and we
[1:32:24] have to run and you have to hurry up. He
[1:32:26] said, "We don't have to hurry up. We
[1:32:27] make it." And the man, and brother Tony
[1:32:29] said, "How do you know that you make
[1:32:30] it?" He said, "I'm the pilot.
[1:32:33] I'm the pilot. There's so many people in
[1:32:36] the message, they are afraid of the
[1:32:37] rapture. Now the new pope comes and and
[1:32:40] they're afraid of what is what is we are
[1:32:42] the rapture. It lays in us. Amen. I
[1:32:45] don't have I don't have to read the
[1:32:47] news. That's fine. But I have to see
[1:32:48] what God does right now in in his right.
[1:32:51] That's the time clock for me. Can you
[1:32:54] say amen? Don't be traumatized because
[1:32:56] of whatever comes. I'm in I'm at lace.
[1:32:59] If you come from God, he will not forget
[1:33:01] you. That's right. cannot forget you
[1:33:03] because God is not anymore complete
[1:33:05] without you. Cannot forget you. I mean
[1:33:09] he sometime loses he he throws away from
[1:33:11] 100 sheep just to find that one sheep.
[1:33:13] You can say I mean if 99 or no no it's
[1:33:16] he will not forget one of his children.
[1:33:19] Can you say amen? Please make the next
[1:33:21] one. What a father we have. I'm hurrying
[1:33:23] through. Now look,
[1:33:26] God can make a thus says the Lord and
[1:33:30] the fulfillment is already in the past
[1:33:33] because his his ways are way higher than
[1:33:36] our ways. That's what the Bible says.
[1:33:38] Here's brother Bren warning then
[1:33:40] judgment. And he explains all the time
[1:33:43] how God works, how he thinks. Now here's
[1:33:47] that woman. They are backsliden. I say
[1:33:49] it in my own words. They're backsliden.
[1:33:51] And the woman she she's pregnant and the
[1:33:54] baby died in the womb as far as I
[1:33:56] understand from that story and she must
[1:33:58] be operate but the operation cannot be
[1:34:00] done. Okay. So the woman they call for
[1:34:03] brother Brandham and brother Brandham
[1:34:05] prays for that girl and the girl gives
[1:34:08] her heart to the Lord Jesus and the
[1:34:11] family gives her heart to the Lord
[1:34:12] Jesus. They all backsliding, give their
[1:34:14] heart to the Lord Jesus. And brother
[1:34:15] Brandon prays for that girl and the girl
[1:34:17] gets
[1:34:19] healed and it's a great thing in the
[1:34:21] family. So he has to go on a certain
[1:34:24] mission trip and what happened is in the
[1:34:27] meantime the girl tells her mother,
[1:34:28] "Mama, I'm going home." The mama says,
[1:34:31] "Yes, sure you're going home. Brother
[1:34:32] Brandon prayed for you." The doctor
[1:34:34] said, "You are healed." She said, she
[1:34:35] said, "No, I'm dying. I'm going home to
[1:34:37] my heavenly home." Mama said, "No, no,
[1:34:39] brother Brandon prayed for it. Couldn't
[1:34:40] be." And after some minutes he passed
[1:34:42] away. Brother Brham said this. He heard
[1:34:45] and I don't know what caused me to do
[1:34:47] but I said Lord you owe me an
[1:34:50] understanding after me going out there
[1:34:52] telling that husband him coming to the
[1:34:54] Lord after you have done these things
[1:34:56] for him and all that and then take that
[1:34:58] girls like that. I said you owe me an
[1:35:01] understanding. When you tell God
[1:35:03] something like this he will leave you
[1:35:04] sitting alone. He don't owe me nothing.
[1:35:07] I'm in debt to him. Well, he just let me
[1:35:11] put out for a days, you know, and after
[1:35:14] about 3 or 4 months, one day I was out
[1:35:17] on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to
[1:35:19] me in a vision and said, "Now go to her
[1:35:22] mother and say this to her mother. Did
[1:35:25] not her time come the year before that
[1:35:28] when she was drowning in a creek on a
[1:35:30] picnic? She should have went at that
[1:35:33] time, but I had to take her when she was
[1:35:36] ready to go." And that's why all this
[1:35:38] happened. and why you went out there.
[1:35:40] Then I got down and cried. I said, "Lord
[1:35:42] Jesus, forgive me. Your poor stupid
[1:35:44] servant." I remember I was sitting in my
[1:35:47] car and I heard when brother Ben start
[1:35:49] to cry at that at that. And I cried with
[1:35:51] him. How God so many time is
[1:35:54] misunderstood.
[1:35:56] You understand? Brother Bam said you
[1:35:58] will live and the fulfillment was
[1:36:01] already a year ago.
[1:36:04] Time means nothing for God.
[1:36:07] God is thinking in other fears. His ways
[1:36:10] are way above our ways. Brother, I tell
[1:36:13] you one thing. Sometime God takes
[1:36:15] teenagers and we don't understand that.
[1:36:17] But God calls a man and a woman at its
[1:36:21] best
[1:36:23] because it's our father. God takes
[1:36:25] children. God tells young takes young
[1:36:27] people. We don't understand it. We have
[1:36:29] a we have a we have a right to to mourn
[1:36:32] but we don't have a right to be critical
[1:36:34] with God. You can only say God you know
[1:36:36] better.
[1:36:38] God sometime takes children. He knows
[1:36:40] what he does. God calls a person at his
[1:36:44] best time.
[1:36:45] Can you say amen brother? Amen. Sometime
[1:36:49] we think we think human I knock on the
[1:36:52] pulpit and we hear the sound but God can
[1:36:54] make the sound before I knock on it
[1:36:56] because he is the author of time of
[1:36:58] space of everything. Amen. God's ways
[1:37:01] are way higher than our ways. Can you
[1:37:04] say amen? One thing is sure. Amen. God
[1:37:08] does not make mistakes. He calls a man
[1:37:10] at his best. He calls a woman at the
[1:37:13] best moment. Therefore, I always say be
[1:37:16] prepared in your life. Amen. Tell the
[1:37:18] young people always if you want to do
[1:37:20] something for God, do it now. You don't
[1:37:22] know if you have a tomorrow. And I
[1:37:24] always think by myself, I'm we're
[1:37:26] getting a little bit older. Amen. One
[1:37:28] day we stand before the Lord. We want to
[1:37:30] have a good testimony before the young
[1:37:31] people. Amen. not not that kind of of of
[1:37:34] of selfish things and that young people
[1:37:36] could say he was a good minister but
[1:37:38] look I give you an example we had a good
[1:37:40] minister in our in our community our
[1:37:43] church and the young people said he's a
[1:37:45] good minister but he can even he cannot
[1:37:47] even lose table tennis
[1:37:49] match that was that was the personality
[1:37:52] he could not even lose one table tennis
[1:37:54] match then it was too much for him but
[1:37:55] when it comes to the preaching skills he
[1:37:57] was good I thought by myself we must
[1:37:59] understand these young people they are
[1:38:00] watching on us how we react, how we get
[1:38:04] critics under our controls, how we deal
[1:38:06] with opposition, how we react. And the
[1:38:09] young people have a right to watch us.
[1:38:12] Amen. Look, brother, we we don't want to
[1:38:14] become just gray in the message. We want
[1:38:16] to become mature in the message. We want
[1:38:18] to be changed. A not these youngsters
[1:38:21] that we were years ago. We want to deal
[1:38:23] with God's people and God's word in a in
[1:38:25] a in in a matured way. Can you say amen?
[1:38:28] Amen. You see, Amen.
[1:38:31] Tell her the girl should have died one
[1:38:34] year ago, but the girl was not ready
[1:38:37] yet. Go. Brother B made some assumptions
[1:38:40] to God. But when he heard how God's plan
[1:38:42] was, he started just crying. Amen. What
[1:38:46] a father we have. God is more interested
[1:38:49] in our soul than we are sometime
[1:38:51] interested in our soul. Brother Bram
[1:38:53] said, "God wants to give you more the
[1:38:55] Holy Ghost than you expect to have the
[1:38:56] Holy Ghost." Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:38:59] Please make the next one. I'm hurrying
[1:39:01] through. Amen. Here we go. Amen. What a
[1:39:03] beautiful thing. Can God correct
[1:39:06] himself? He loves to do this. God is not
[1:39:10] changing his mind about his word. That
[1:39:13] is please speak about Balum. But about
[1:39:15] situation that people understand I'm a
[1:39:18] living God. I'm not a statue. I'm a
[1:39:22] father. You can talk with
[1:39:24] me. Brother, when we were younger, we we
[1:39:27] we just had Muslimic worship. Okay.
[1:39:29] Amen. Let me say we came to church. Oh
[1:39:32] heavenly father, you are great and you
[1:39:34] are great brother. Every Muslim can do
[1:39:37] this. Do you want your children come to
[1:39:39] you come home from your work and your
[1:39:41] children oh father comes home he has the
[1:39:44] money. We can go to Amazon. Thank you
[1:39:46] father. And you want your children to
[1:39:49] grab you. And I hope it's the same for
[1:39:52] you. And as we become a little bit older
[1:39:54] we have another relationship to the Lord
[1:39:56] Jesus. Sometime just during the day I'm
[1:39:58] I'm just there and I hope you don't
[1:40:00] misunderstood when I say this but I said
[1:40:02] heavenly father I I love you so much. Is
[1:40:06] there anything that I could do that that
[1:40:08] would please you today I mean that time
[1:40:11] of legalistic thing is over. You cannot
[1:40:13] earn the rapture. You are the rapture
[1:40:17] unmmerited. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the
[1:40:20] name of the Lord. Can I do something for
[1:40:22] your children? Maybe I can help a weak a
[1:40:24] weak child and just be a blessing.
[1:40:26] Brother Bram said, "If you love me, help
[1:40:28] my children." Does God says the same
[1:40:30] thing? Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[1:40:33] Lord. A lady in my church, Brother Bea,
[1:40:36] Miss Weber, she was dying with
[1:40:38] tuberculosis. She was in the sanatorium
[1:40:40] at the last stages. They sent her home
[1:40:42] to die. Said there is nothing could be
[1:40:44] done for her. Miss Grace Weber in
[1:40:47] Jeffersonville. She lived just beyond
[1:40:49] the tabernacle. She had got five or six
[1:40:51] children. So the angel, look, thus
[1:40:53] sayaith the Lord. So the angel of the
[1:40:55] Lord come to me that night said, "Go
[1:40:57] tell Mrs. Weber, tell Mr. Weber rather,
[1:41:00] to get things ready for he's going to be
[1:41:02] left with those children on his hands
[1:41:05] for his wife is going." Well, I went and
[1:41:07] told Mr. Weber, I told this little girl,
[1:41:10] little Jean Rose, which is a nurse now.
[1:41:12] She was a little bitty fellow then.
[1:41:13] She's a young lady now, seven years ago
[1:41:16] or more. I said, "Jeanie, your mother is
[1:41:18] going to die." According what the angel
[1:41:20] said she can't live but a little while
[1:41:22] longer and two days after that or three
[1:41:25] days there was some ladies from the
[1:41:27] government depot where they were worked
[1:41:29] come in work there and come in and she
[1:41:32] and Grace Mrs. Weber said, "If I could
[1:41:35] only have brother Bill to pray for me
[1:41:38] once more." She said, "I have seen my
[1:41:40] cousin Opal was healed with the cancer
[1:41:43] and the doctor just give her till
[1:41:45] morning to live and her daughter is a
[1:41:47] nurse also." Please make the next
[1:41:50] one. Said, "And that girl out from the
[1:41:54] government where she worked with her
[1:41:56] said there ain't nothing to that guy.
[1:41:59] Said he is nothing but a hypocrite.
[1:42:01] That's our religion. It's just a bunch
[1:42:03] of fanaticism. And so Mrs. Weber said,
[1:42:06] "Look, I'm dying. You must see the
[1:42:09] scenery." I mean, here she is. And she
[1:42:11] hears what these girls and I see
[1:42:13] her. I tell you one thing. I have no
[1:42:18] voice, but I will not stand still for
[1:42:21] that thing. Amen. Amen. A She said, "I
[1:42:26] lived here around that city, around that
[1:42:28] man all the time. I seen him from a
[1:42:30] child grown up." She said, "You can call
[1:42:32] it fake if you want to, but I have seen
[1:42:35] just so much and seeing God heal the
[1:42:37] people." She said, "And I know the man's
[1:42:39] life, and I know it's the truth." And it
[1:42:42] happened to be the angel of the Lord
[1:42:44] heard that the very night sitting on the
[1:42:47] side of my chair the room after I got up
[1:42:50] and went went got a drink of water about
[1:42:52] 3:00 in the morning sitting on the chair
[1:42:55] I see him coming walking through the
[1:42:57] door said tomorrow they are going to
[1:42:59] pick Miss Weber up bring her down she
[1:43:02] will be sitting on the right hand side
[1:43:04] far back in the tabernacle said I heard
[1:43:07] her and tell her I heard her what she
[1:43:10] said and tell her, "Thus says the Lord,
[1:43:13] she will live and not die. There you
[1:43:15] are. You can go down see her if you like
[1:43:18] to." About seven years ago, his presence
[1:43:21] was there when she was taking up for
[1:43:23] what was right. His presence was there.
[1:43:26] He found her. So he come and told me
[1:43:28] what she had said. And she said to these
[1:43:31] women and said, "And he had respect to
[1:43:34] her because she had respect to what was
[1:43:38] representing God. So God will do the
[1:43:41] same thing for you, not to respect me,
[1:43:44] but to respect to him, to Christ, the
[1:43:46] one who died for your healing. If you
[1:43:49] just give respect to him and his word,
[1:43:51] God will do the work for you. Amen.
[1:43:55] Look, God comes to the prophet said,
[1:43:58] "Thus sayaith the Lord, prepare her. She
[1:44:01] will die." Didn't he know before? Sure.
[1:44:05] But God
[1:44:07] loves to interact on our action. God
[1:44:13] loves to bless. That's his nature. God
[1:44:16] loves to forgive. That's his that's his
[1:44:18] DNA.
[1:44:20] God loves to reward. Look the look the
[1:44:23] book of Revelation. Everything is a
[1:44:25] reward. God loves to reward. And here he
[1:44:29] knows what he does. Comes to brother
[1:44:31] Brham. Tell her thus says the Lord she
[1:44:34] will die. Did he know before? Sure. But
[1:44:37] he
[1:44:38] loved to bring his children into an
[1:44:41] action so he can reveal himself as the
[1:44:44] almighty God. And look how beautiful he
[1:44:48] was there when she took up a stand for
[1:44:52] the word. I always tell this young
[1:44:55] people if you are alone in school you
[1:44:57] are always in the
[1:44:58] majority. Amen. Because if God is with
[1:45:01] you, you are just in the majority. And
[1:45:03] look how God knows the future. The angel
[1:45:06] comes and tells she will be sitting
[1:45:08] tomorrow way back in the tabernacle. God
[1:45:11] knows where you are sitting next Sunday.
[1:45:14] God sees you in the rapture.
[1:45:17] Therefore, he says, "I call you bright."
[1:45:19] You say, "I don't believe it for
[1:45:20] myself." God say, "I see you already
[1:45:22] there."
[1:45:23] Therefore, brother Brandham says,
[1:45:26] "Quickening power brought me behind the
[1:45:28] curtain of time and I've seen all of you
[1:45:30] there."
[1:45:32] I said, "He must have seen me." How you
[1:45:34] can prove it? My love to the message of
[1:45:36] the hour and to the word of the Lord
[1:45:38] must be a proof that my I must be one of
[1:45:40] them. Can you say amen? Amen. Blessed be
[1:45:43] the name of the Lord. So what happens is
[1:45:47] this. It matters to serve the Lord.
[1:45:52] Amen. The doctor says to you, uh, you
[1:45:55] are dying. You say, I will talk with my
[1:45:57] father about that.
[1:46:00] Amen. I I heard the diagnosis. I talked
[1:46:03] with my father. I'm not dying because of
[1:46:06] that cancer. Amen. Brother Ram said, "A
[1:46:09] Christian cannot die because of a
[1:46:10] sickness. A Christian dies because his
[1:46:12] time is up. God calls him home." Amen.
[1:46:15] Can you say amen? Amen. Whatever comes
[1:46:19] in your life, you talk with your father.
[1:46:21] I have a father. He knows all things.
[1:46:24] She took up for the Lord and God, the
[1:46:27] angel of the Lord was there. Did he know
[1:46:30] that before? Sure. I mean, God is the
[1:46:32] author of the whole universe. But
[1:46:34] remember, God wants to
[1:46:36] show his ways. Amen. In the days of the
[1:46:41] voice of the seventh angel, the mystery
[1:46:43] of God shall be revealed. Can you say
[1:46:45] amen? Please make the next one. come to
[1:46:47] the end. Amen. Amen. Look at this. You
[1:46:51] remember we were talking about this.
[1:46:54] Amen. The little girl last time I
[1:46:56] remember I saw the picture from my last
[1:46:58] presentation. That's not the
[1:46:59] grandfather. That's what that's the
[1:47:01] father of that little girl, but he has
[1:47:02] cancer. There's no time to live anymore.
[1:47:05] He's an unbeliever. It's over there. I
[1:47:06] think it was in Holland. But what they
[1:47:08] did is that little girl is his daughter.
[1:47:12] And the father knows one thing. I will
[1:47:15] not be there for her
[1:47:17] wedding. Amen. But so what they did they
[1:47:20] were playing
[1:47:22] wedding till she receive till she
[1:47:25] arrived at the altar and they stopped
[1:47:28] that wedding there and when she will
[1:47:30] marry one day they will continue the
[1:47:33] wedding from that point on so that she
[1:47:36] can say my own father brought me.
[1:47:39] Father mother that is here never
[1:47:41] underestimate your position. You mean a
[1:47:44] lot to your children. You say, "I'm
[1:47:46] dead." No, no. You mean a lot to your
[1:47:48] children. They need you. They need,
[1:47:50] brother, sister. We live in a sick
[1:47:53] society. Brother Ramy said, "The only
[1:47:55] normal people will be those with the
[1:47:56] Holy Ghost." We live in a sick society.
[1:47:59] And the rem remedy against sick society
[1:48:01] is healthy families. Legalism will never
[1:48:04] make it. Healthy family where love
[1:48:07] reigns the family. healthy churches full
[1:48:10] of compassion, full of empathy, full of
[1:48:13] heart, full of soul. Mix that message
[1:48:15] with a lot of heart of soul and says I
[1:48:17] love you Lord and I lift my voice. I'm a
[1:48:20] little bit of of of feeling brother.
[1:48:23] Sometime God gives difficult character
[1:48:25] in our churches just he wants to see if
[1:48:27] we can handle these kind of characters
[1:48:29] or if we kick them out. Amen. Amen. God
[1:48:33] wants to see if we can handle these
[1:48:35] people. They are uncomplicated. They are
[1:48:37] complicated. uncomfortable but we have
[1:48:39] enough Holy Ghost to take that sit
[1:48:41] situation under our situation. Can you
[1:48:44] say amen? We all love that. We all love
[1:48:46] to have a family you know like the old
[1:48:48] the old holiness movement. Here's the
[1:48:50] father, mother and here are the children
[1:48:55] and all come to church and all that. But
[1:48:57] sometime God gives us difficult children
[1:49:00] I tell you one thing. It's a little
[1:49:01] secret. Amen. My my my my my my girl.
[1:49:05] Amen. I understood our children are our
[1:49:08] brothers and sisters. Even the little
[1:49:10] ones, if you have a car accident on the
[1:49:12] other side, you have the same size of a
[1:49:13] theophony. They are our brothers and
[1:49:15] sisters. We just had the privilege to
[1:49:18] help them a little bit in life, but they
[1:49:20] they don't we don't own them. Amen. They
[1:49:22] are God's children, not our children. I
[1:49:25] told my daughter, I said, "Honey, look,
[1:49:26] I cannot I" and and she has always been
[1:49:28] a darling. I said, "Honey, I want to
[1:49:30] tell you one thing. I believe that God
[1:49:31] put you in our family and I don't know
[1:49:34] how your future is. You see, we want to
[1:49:36] live a life before you that that you
[1:49:38] love the Lord Jesus. Okay? But maybe you
[1:49:40] you will become a Muslim one day. I be
[1:49:42] so and I even said this and I hope that
[1:49:44] you understand. He says maybe you become
[1:49:46] a
[1:49:47] homosexual. Amen. But never forget one
[1:49:49] thing. Daddy will always be your daddy.
[1:49:52] Always. I will never let you down.
[1:49:54] Never. I will never I will not I will
[1:49:56] not be agreeing with your lifestyle. You
[1:49:58] know that. But but daddy and you we are
[1:50:01] always friends and my door is always
[1:50:03] open because God put us together. And by
[1:50:06] that she said it took so much religious
[1:50:08] pressure from us. You know one thing I
[1:50:11] mean when I was an unbeliever I could
[1:50:13] dance like Michael Jackson. I could I
[1:50:16] could make the moonwalk. My daughter
[1:50:17] said never make it behind the pullpit. I
[1:50:18] said no I would never. She always said
[1:50:20] don't be so embarrassing but I could
[1:50:22] dance like Michael Jackson. I can show
[1:50:24] you but I'm not.
[1:50:27] and all and all the and all the demon
[1:50:29] world said look what what what what what
[1:50:31] a what a loser is this and my father in
[1:50:33] heaven always said no that's my son he
[1:50:36] doesn't know who he is but wait until I
[1:50:37] will reveal myself in heaven was never
[1:50:40] ashamed of me why should I be ashamed of
[1:50:43] my own daughter said honey maybe I don't
[1:50:45] and then she gave her heart to the lord
[1:50:46] at at 17 and look I tell you one thing
[1:50:49] what we did every Sunday and and many
[1:50:52] times showed on youth cam what how
[1:50:54] people come to church and so forth but
[1:50:55] every Sunday we were half half an hour
[1:50:57] before and as a family we were all
[1:50:59] kneeling at the altar like brother Bram
[1:51:01] said laid our hands my wife and me
[1:51:03] around our daughter heavenly father one
[1:51:05] day you will call her one day you will
[1:51:07] bless her help us bless the pastor every
[1:51:10] Sunday and when she was 13 14 15 there
[1:51:14] was no question asked because I believe
[1:51:16] my own prayer brother Ram said God
[1:51:18] believes his own word
[1:51:20] we believe our own prayer and leave it
[1:51:23] up to God in your time you do everything
[1:51:25] wonderful can you Say amen. Brother
[1:51:28] Hammond, I tell you one thing. This is a
[1:51:31] generation who can break that cycle of
[1:51:33] traditions of bad upbringings of of life
[1:51:38] e complexes in family. I can see certain
[1:51:40] strains in families through generation
[1:51:42] and and they could never find a
[1:51:44] solution. But this generation finds a
[1:51:46] solution because we have the open word.
[1:51:48] We can understand who we are and the
[1:51:50] power that lays in us. That brother
[1:51:52] Brandon could say I'm not anymore the
[1:51:53] child the child of Charles and Ella
[1:51:55] Brandham. This is just the outside man,
[1:51:57] but the inside man comes from God. Can
[1:52:00] you say amen? I'm hurrying through God a
[1:52:03] father. I don't know if I preach today
[1:52:06] if 197 if if this was the answer. But I
[1:52:10] tell you that was the biblical answer. I
[1:52:12] can show you that is how God always
[1:52:15] reacted when people were not ready. God
[1:52:17] was just waiting until because he's a
[1:52:20] father. Okay. So, so here's what brother
[1:52:23] Brand says. He speaks about the third
[1:52:25] point. Now there is another far greater
[1:52:30] I have to make it clear. Amen. I'm
[1:52:32] completely against homosexuality. That's
[1:52:34] that's for sure. Okay. Now there's no
[1:52:36] question about it as a spirit. Okay. Not
[1:52:38] no it's sodomic. No no but the soul of a
[1:52:41] person. Amen. God doesn't love sin but
[1:52:44] he loves the sinner. That we please make
[1:52:47] the difference. Okay. This distinction.
[1:52:49] Okay. H. Okay. But I told my daughter
[1:52:51] look whatever comes your way you become
[1:52:53] a Muslim. Daddy will always be your
[1:52:54] daddy. Okay? Because we are not helping
[1:52:57] the youngsters by despising them. So we
[1:52:59] have to throw them out. I'm hope I'm
[1:53:01] happy my heavenly father never throwed
[1:53:02] me out. He gave me a hand when I was
[1:53:05] down in in sin and I want to be exactly
[1:53:07] that way. Amen. Blessed be the name of
[1:53:09] the Lord. Here's God. Amen. Third pull.
[1:53:13] Brother Bland. Now there is a another
[1:53:15] one far greater than all the rest of
[1:53:17] them put together. Already confirmed and
[1:53:19] ready. I hope it happens tonight. I just
[1:53:22] may say this. I don't have the time to
[1:53:25] explain it to you, but the brethren who
[1:53:27] does know about it is wonderful. It
[1:53:29] would be such a great thing for the
[1:53:31] people. And I'm grateful to God that the
[1:53:35] hour is soon at hand when God is going
[1:53:38] to help his children. Especially, it
[1:53:41] will be for those who can't muster the
[1:53:43] faith to raise up and got a hold of God
[1:53:46] like they should. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:53:49] Brother Freddy Mercury is singing. We
[1:53:51] are the champions. No time for loser.
[1:53:53] But this message has time for losers.
[1:53:57] This message has a solution for people
[1:53:58] who are standing in their own way
[1:54:00] because I was too long. Brother, I tell
[1:54:02] you one thing for my own life. We were
[1:54:04] never in a wrong doctrine.
[1:54:06] But I have too many years in my life
[1:54:08] where I was just carnal. Just carnal.
[1:54:11] Just a carnal message believer acting
[1:54:13] carnal, thinking carnal. And one time
[1:54:15] really God spoke to me. He said,
[1:54:16] "Marcus, you have to grow. You have to
[1:54:18] come out of the kinder shoes, children's
[1:54:20] shoes. You have to grow into a maturity
[1:54:22] because because I mean and I understood
[1:54:24] I was never lost but God couldn't do
[1:54:26] much with me because it was too carnal.
[1:54:28] He said this and he was that and my no I
[1:54:31] said Lord let let me grow. Let me come
[1:54:33] into a vision then I can be of help. God
[1:54:37] loves to help his children and the
[1:54:39] weaker you are the more God loves to
[1:54:41] help you. Amen. You see especially it
[1:54:43] will be for those who can't mess the
[1:54:45] faith to raise up and get a hold of God
[1:54:47] like they should. I believe the Lord is
[1:54:50] providing a way for us now to take care
[1:54:53] of them. Also, some run into faith that
[1:54:56] they can just reach over receive
[1:54:57] anything. There's great faith. Some of
[1:54:59] them has mustard seed faith and has to
[1:55:02] wait so long to get through. I believe
[1:55:04] the Lord is making a way for those
[1:55:06] people now. I don't know when it will
[1:55:09] be, but it will be just as certain as
[1:55:11] I'm standing here. And brother Brandon
[1:55:13] speaks about the third pull.
[1:55:16] The third point is not to make us more
[1:55:18] arrogant. It's to understand how God
[1:55:21] sees the scenery. And now we see
[1:55:23] ourself. You say, "And we can sing I
[1:55:25] have a father and we see amen." If the
[1:55:29] musicians would come, I mean, brother
[1:55:31] Brandham was so beautiful. Amen. He
[1:55:34] spoke about the prophet
[1:55:36] Elijah. And Elijah was such a And I'm
[1:55:40] finishing up with two thoughts and then
[1:55:42] we we we're we're up. Are we? Do you
[1:55:45] love the Lord Jesus? Isn't he wonderful?
[1:55:48] This message showed us what a father is.
[1:55:52] I said, I already said, Lord, if I can
[1:55:54] be just half of a father to my own
[1:55:56] daughter like you were unto me, I'm a
[1:55:57] good man.
[1:55:59] Amen. If I can just learn from you,
[1:56:01] therefore, Jesus said, learn from me.
[1:56:04] Yeah. Yeah. Because we were we we we we
[1:56:06] know how to how to make discipline. We
[1:56:08] were very strong in disciplining. But a
[1:56:11] father is more than just disciplining.
[1:56:12] We're not corporals. We're not
[1:56:14] sergeants. We must we must give a a
[1:56:16] heart, a soul to them. Definitely a
[1:56:18] soul. Come on. Brother Bren speaks of
[1:56:20] the prophet Elijah. He was so
[1:56:23] discouraged. A man just how do you call
[1:56:26] it?
[1:56:28] Depressed. And when he was when he just
[1:56:31] wanted to die, I remember there was an
[1:56:33] angel coming down with something to eat.
[1:56:35] And brother Bram said, I wanted to know
[1:56:36] what was what were the vitamins in those
[1:56:39] cookies. This is what he says. Because
[1:56:41] for 40 days and 40 nights Elijah was
[1:56:44] running. You must understand one thing.
[1:56:47] This message that we believe is Red
[1:56:49] Bull. Amen. It's Red Bull. There's power
[1:56:52] in this message. And we're running for
[1:56:54] 40 days and 40 nights. Amen. To the
[1:56:57] rapture and to the million to the great
[1:56:59] things hereafter. It's a person.
[1:57:01] Remember what happened to the prophet
[1:57:03] Elijah and to what happened in
[1:57:04] Revelation chapter 10 when the angel
[1:57:06] comes down with a book to eat and we
[1:57:08] become that book. Amen. And brother Ram
[1:57:12] said this quote. Amen. Wonderful for me.
[1:57:16] Yeah. For us weaklings, for us losers,
[1:57:20] it gives me strength to say Marcus you
[1:57:22] make it because God makes it in us. He
[1:57:24] says, "If you did your
[1:57:27] best and you cannot move on, God is
[1:57:30] obligated to send that same angel to
[1:57:33] you." That makes that gospel personal to
[1:57:37] me. God is not standing there and said,
[1:57:40] "We will see who make the
[1:57:41] rapture." That God comes down said, "I
[1:57:45] help you. We make it together."
[1:57:47] Revelation chapter 10. Amen. Blessed be
[1:57:49] the name of the Lord. The great person
[1:57:51] in our generation is not William
[1:57:53] Brandham anymore. It's the Lord Jesus
[1:57:55] Christ. But not only the man at the
[1:57:57] cross, the man who came down to bring us
[1:57:59] home. He's the way. Isn't that
[1:58:01] wonderful? Isn't that Isn't that Isn't
[1:58:03] what a father we have? Who want to be
[1:58:05] boasting? Who want to be the man of the
[1:58:07] hour for for the bride? Christ is the
[1:58:08] man of the hour. Oh, we find our
[1:58:11] bridegroom. We fall in love with the
[1:58:12] word. And if do you know this nicely the
[1:58:15] song uh the goodness of God. Isn't that
[1:58:18] wonderful? We sing a lot of
[1:58:19] denominational songs. That's fine. But
[1:58:21] we sing them different. We sing the same
[1:58:23] song. We sing when we sing He is here.
[1:58:26] Hallelujah. We sing it different. Let me
[1:58:28] finish with a little story and then I'm
[1:58:30] really
[1:58:32] finished. Did I say something wrong? All
[1:58:35] is
[1:58:39] well. It's a true story, but it shows
[1:58:42] how great our father is. Amen. In the
[1:58:46] Anglican church in the beginning of last
[1:58:49] century, there was a runner by the name
[1:58:51] of Eric Liddell. And remember the
[1:58:54] Pentecostals 100 years ago, they were
[1:58:56] the eagles of their time. Don't miss.
[1:58:58] No, they were the eagles of their time.
[1:59:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Okay.
[1:59:02] Huh? And he was a professional runner
[1:59:04] and he was a preacher in the Anglican
[1:59:06] church. Eric Liddell, they call him the
[1:59:09] locomotive of England. Yeah. There's a
[1:59:13] film Chariots of Fire around the man.
[1:59:15] Amen. And he he was in the two
[1:59:19] finals for the Olympic game. I I think
[1:59:21] he was in Paris. I'm not very positive.
[1:59:23] 24 I think around 20 or 12 something
[1:59:25] like this, please. Beginning of last
[1:59:27] century. And he was the absolute
[1:59:30] favorite for the first final. Amen. But
[1:59:34] he refused to run. He said, "No, that
[1:59:36] final is on a Sunday. We're not running
[1:59:38] on a Sunday. No, we refuse to run. Just
[1:59:42] I mean, God sees that. God honest
[1:59:44] that you see and then he was in the
[1:59:47] final but he had no chance on a Tuesday
[1:59:50] on a Wednesday and while he prepared for
[1:59:52] his run the I think it was the American
[1:59:55] coach came to him and gave him a little
[1:59:57] piece of paper and he put that paper in
[2:00:00] his little pocket and the race started
[2:00:02] and they the eyewitnesses said he was
[2:00:04] like a tour behind that man he was
[2:00:07] winning Olympic gold having no chance.
[2:00:10] Amen. And after after he was the
[2:00:14] ceremony was over, he remembered that
[2:00:16] little piece of paper that the American
[2:00:18] coach gave to him and it was a leaflet
[2:00:20] from the
[2:00:22] Bible. It's a story of Samuel which
[2:00:25] says, "I honor those that honor me."
[2:00:29] Brother, it matters to serve the Lord.
[2:00:32] He's a very present help in time of
[2:00:34] trouble. It matters to make things right
[2:00:37] with God because God loves to forgive.
[2:00:41] Amen. Amen. Just tell him, Lord, that's
[2:00:43] my greatest weakness. God says, I know.
[2:00:46] Amen. What a father we have. What a what
[2:00:49] a friend in life we have, brother. We
[2:00:53] cannot leave the message. Where should I
[2:00:55] go? There's nobody who loves me like the
[2:00:58] Lord Jesus. No. Where should I go? In
[2:01:00] which church should I go? Amen. I told
[2:01:02] my daughter, I said, "Honey, you can go
[2:01:04] in the things of the world, but we will
[2:01:06] find nothing because we come from the
[2:01:07] world." Um, this message is much more
[2:01:10] than just indoctrinating people with
[2:01:13] some seals and so forth. This message
[2:01:15] reveals who the Lord Jesus is. In the
[2:01:18] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[2:01:20] the mystery of God shall be revealed.
[2:01:23] Have you ever read the the generations
[2:01:25] book? You see, and you can see many of
[2:01:28] the conclusions is is is not very
[2:01:31] spiritual, but you can see how people
[2:01:34] were impressed by the man William Brand.
[2:01:36] They love that man William Brandham so
[2:01:39] much. They were so impressed by just and
[2:01:42] I always said if William Brandham must
[2:01:44] have been such a wonderful man what
[2:01:46] about the Lord Jesus? You take this plus
[2:01:50] 100 plus thousand trust me that must be
[2:01:52] our
[2:01:54] Lord.
[2:01:55] Amen. Amen. I tell this and please don't
[2:01:59] forget this. We are the only people on
[2:02:01] this earth who doesn't have a religion.
[2:02:04] We have a father. Amen. Amen. Don't make
[2:02:07] that message to be a religion. It is not
[2:02:09] meant to be a religion. It's not a cult.
[2:02:11] It's not a denomination. It is a
[2:02:13] relationship between a heavenly father.
[2:02:16] For the first time, we understand God.
[2:02:19] Amen. We understand God better than Adam
[2:02:21] in the Garden of Eden. We understand his
[2:02:23] ways in the thousand millions of time
[2:02:26] brother thousands of time brother said
[2:02:28] is that all true? Amen. You come from
[2:02:30] this city. But in the third pool, God
[2:02:32] reveals the back part of the mind of
[2:02:35] God. And now we understand our father.
[2:02:39] We don't fear him. We reverence him. Ah,
[2:02:43] we love him more. The more he reveals,
[2:02:45] the more we see, Lord, you are so
[2:02:46] wonderful. What a wonderful thing it is.
[2:02:49] Can you say amen?
[2:02:51] Therefore, man, I want to tell you this,
[2:02:53] and I think brother Paul agrees with me.
[2:02:55] It's a pleasure to preach the message
[2:02:58] because it sets people free. It's a
[2:03:01] pleasure to be a message believer. It's
[2:03:03] not It's not hard at all. It's a
[2:03:05] pleasure to be part of the economy of
[2:03:07] God. I will not change it for anything.
[2:03:10] Can you say amen? Unmmerited grace. Do
[2:03:14] we have the song? God bless you.
[2:03:17] Amen. I love you, Lord,
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:23] for your mercy never fails me.
[2:03:29] All my
[2:03:31] days I've been held in your
[2:03:37] hands. From the moment that I wake
[2:03:41] up until I lay my
[2:03:46] hands. Oh, I will

[2:04:41] fire in darkest nights.

[2:04:49] other. Oh, I've known you as a
[2:04:55] father. I've known you as a
[2:04:59] friend. And I have
[2:05:02] lived in the
[2:05:05] goodness of God.
[2:05:10] Oh, and all my life you have been
[2:05:17] faithful.

[2:05:28] good. Every breath that I am
[2:05:34] made, oh, I will sing. I love your
[2:05:38] voice. The
[2:05:40] goodness of God. I love his voice.
[2:05:44] I love your voice.
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:49] You have led me through the fire.
[2:05:54] Our father brought us darkest nights.
[2:05:57] You are close like no other.
[2:06:03] Oh, I've known you as a
[2:06:07] father. Oh, I've known you as a
[2:06:11] friend. And I have
[2:06:14] lived in the
[2:06:16] goodness of
[2:06:19] God. Oh my
[2:06:23] life. All my life you have been.

[2:06:36] so
[2:06:40] good. Every breath that I am
[2:06:46] made. Oh, I will
[2:06:49] sing of the
[2:06:51] goodness of God.
[2:06:56] Oh, your goodness is running after. It's
[2:07:01] running after
[2:07:04] me. Oh, your goodness is running after.
[2:07:09] It's running after
[2:07:12] me. With my life laid down, I'm
[2:07:16] surrendered now. I give you everything.
[2:07:22] Oh, your goodness is running after. It's
[2:07:27] running after me.

[2:08:05] If that is fine for you before the
[2:08:07] prayer, do you have the song Jesus lamb
[2:08:09] of God? Can we sing it? I know it's a
[2:08:12] little bit later, brother Paul. I don't
[2:08:13] want to be disrespectful, but it's just
[2:08:15] a a wonderful response to Amen. Then we
[2:08:19] have a word of prayer. You are my
[2:08:22] strength when I am weak. You are the
[2:08:27] treasure that I seek. You are my all in
[2:08:33] all.

[2:10:31] God,
[2:10:33] worthy is your name. While the music is
[2:10:38] softly playing, I want to ask you to
[2:10:40] just all sit down. We are praying
[2:10:42] together. Please sit down. And I was
[2:10:44] while our heads are bowed and I please
[2:10:47] ask not to film at that moment. I want
[2:10:49] the youngsters to stand up. If you want
[2:10:52] to ask the Lord Jesus to receive the
[2:10:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost, said the
[2:10:55] heavenly father, I want to have a friend
[2:10:57] in my life. I want to I I I need someone
[2:11:01] who takes my hand in all situations of
[2:11:04] my life. I'm a weak person, maybe weak
[2:11:06] in my psyche, weak in my this, but I
[2:11:08] want to ask you just be my friend. Just
[2:11:11] lead me and guide me. I want you just to
[2:11:13] stand up before the Lord. Those who seek
[2:11:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And while
[2:11:16] we are praying, heavenly father, amen,
[2:11:20] God bless you. God bless you, young
[2:11:21] girl. Amen. Heavenly Father, just a
[2:11:24] moment, a solemn moment. It was longer
[2:11:26] than I thought. I asked the congregation
[2:11:28] for forgiveness. I want to be a
[2:11:29] respectful man, but it seems that I
[2:11:31] forgot the time. Lord, I don't want to
[2:11:33] be that way, but it seemed that you want
[2:11:35] to talk to some of these youngsters.
[2:11:37] Father, may you bless each and everyone,
[2:11:39] Father, and those who are standing up.
[2:11:41] Fill them with the Holy Ghost. Father,
[2:11:43] you have your time for them. Maybe it's
[2:11:45] not this evening, but you're just
[2:11:47] standing before you say, "I need it. I
[2:11:49] want it. I don't want to be just a a
[2:11:51] message believer. I want to have the
[2:11:53] person that this brother Brandham just
[2:11:56] just just presented to us, Father. May
[2:11:58] you may you fill them with your good
[2:12:00] Holy Ghost. May you lead them and guide
[2:12:03] them. Father, I know I was not preaching
[2:12:05] emotional this evening. Was just a
[2:12:08] little teaching of understanding how God
[2:12:10] thinks and you answer to their heart.
[2:12:13] And Lord, you made the you made the you
[2:12:15] are you are calling each and everyone in
[2:12:18] your time father. So bless them, fill
[2:12:20] them, guide them and lead them father on
[2:12:22] a just simple Wednesday evening service.
[2:12:25] And father all of us that are here let
[2:12:28] us learn from you. Lord we made so much
[2:12:30] mistakes with our carnality with our
[2:12:33] humanity and we we made so much damage
[2:12:36] in our lives. Lord, let these last years
[2:12:39] that we have to live, let we live for
[2:12:42] the glory and for the honor of the Lord,
[2:12:44] let us become a blessing for the bride.
[2:12:46] Father, maybe people see things
[2:12:48] different than us, but let us treat
[2:12:50] people like you are treating them. You
[2:12:53] have patience with people. You are long
[2:12:55] you're longsuffering. You have patience.
[2:12:57] Father, you understand upbringings. You
[2:12:59] understand people, Father. Don't let us
[2:13:02] be too judgmental because we understand
[2:13:04] that you have a bigger view on a
[2:13:06] person's life. Father, take our lives.
[2:13:09] And I want to ask for my most noble
[2:13:11] brother, brother Paul, for this church,
[2:13:13] the ministers that are here. Bless them.
[2:13:15] They are already blessed, Father, but
[2:13:17] let them be more blessed even in a
[2:13:20] greater way, Father. And let this church
[2:13:23] prosper. Let it be a a lighthouse for a
[2:13:26] dying world father for a people who
[2:13:29] suffer that they always come here and
[2:13:31] feel home with all their burdens with
[2:13:33] all their problem but I'm home I'm in
[2:13:35] the house of my father and my father
[2:13:38] takes care of situations father we thank
[2:13:41] you for this moment of consecration and
[2:13:43] we commit our lives into your hands ask
[2:13:46] it in the name of the lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:48] and I want the youngsters to sit down
[2:13:51] for who are standing up for the baptism
[2:13:53] of the holy Holy Ghost and God saw your
[2:13:55] action. That was just before the unseen
[2:13:59] world. Amen. And God bless you all. I
[2:14:01] give over to the pastor again, brother
[2:14:03] Paul. I don't want to be disrespectful.

[2:14:30] Jesus name. Gideon can sing somewhere
[2:14:33] you can worship. But I don't want to add
[2:14:34] to that. The Lord has spoken. The Lord
[2:14:36] has spoken to many lives. And uh I just
