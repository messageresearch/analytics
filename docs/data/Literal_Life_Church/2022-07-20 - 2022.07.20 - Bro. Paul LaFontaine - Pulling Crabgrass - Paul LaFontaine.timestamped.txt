[0:00] 24
[0:02] and we greet you on this wednesday night
[0:04] in the name of the lord jesus christ it
[0:06] is such a great privilege to gather
[0:08] together
[0:09] to worship him to feel his presence
[0:11] to feel a breath of fresh air
[0:14] and
[0:15] the book of acts says there should be
[0:16] times of refreshing
[0:18] and i really believe that church is a
[0:20] time for that so we're just glad to be
[0:22] here and glad each of you are here
[0:23] tonight as well
[0:25] we love the lord we love what he's done
[0:27] in our lives we look forward to what
[0:28] he's going to do and each
[0:31] time we hear
[0:32] a portion of the word of god it's
[0:34] special to us and we know that
[0:37] we were this word was meant for a
[0:39] special group of people and that's his
[0:41] people and so when we get into it we
[0:43] realize we may have a connection with it
[0:45] sometimes we read it and we don't
[0:47] understand everything but we're still
[0:49] connected to it and we know god will
[0:50] give us understanding proverbs 24 and
[0:53] verse 30.
[0:58] i went by the field
[1:00] of the slaughter
[1:02] and by the vineyard of the man void of
[1:04] understanding
[1:05] and lo it was all grown over with thorns
[1:09] and nettles
[1:11] had covered the face thereof
[1:13] and the stone wall thereof was broken
[1:16] down so solemn in his wit by
[1:18] this man who has this vineyard and he's
[1:21] seen it grown over i want you to
[1:23] remember that term it's all grown over
[1:26] with thorns and nettles covered the face
[1:29] thereof and the stone there was broken
[1:30] down and then i saw and considered it
[1:33] well i looked upon it and received
[1:36] instruction now it's strange that you
[1:39] would look at a man's yard and vineyard
[1:42] and garden and receive instruction
[1:45] but god can speak through anything
[1:48] i received instruction yet a little
[1:50] sleep a little slumber
[1:52] a little folding of the hands to sleep
[1:55] so shall thy poverty come as one
[1:58] that traveleth and the and thy want
[2:01] as an armed man may god add his
[2:04] blessings to the word of god you may be
[2:05] seated tonight
[2:07] and i want to speak tonight on a short
[2:09] subject of pulling crab grass
[2:15] don't look at me strange
[2:18] don't laugh at me
[2:19] after a title from last sunday of it's
[2:22] all about the mail
[2:24] that was brother rich's title it's all
[2:26] about the mail it's all about the man i
[2:28] don't know how he got by with that title
[2:30] but he did and what he spoke was truth
[2:33] so don't worry about my pulling crab
[2:35] grass tonight and we are in the season
[2:37] of pulling crab grass
[2:40] you know there are some lessons
[2:42] sometimes that we get by reading
[2:45] by hearing preaching by hearing teaching
[2:48] we not only receive lessons but we
[2:50] receive revelation from the word of god
[2:53] and so there are there are channels that
[2:55] god has given us
[2:56] for us to get lessons from
[2:59] and most of the time it's from reading
[3:01] and hearing and preaching and teaching
[3:03] but then there are some lessons and
[3:05] instruction and even revelation that we
[3:08] get in everyday life
[3:10] and that's everyday life
[3:12] by experience
[3:14] and a lot of that experience is not just
[3:16] going through things ourself but
[3:19] observing the life of others watching
[3:21] the life of others we can receive
[3:24] instruction
[3:25] by watching the life of others
[3:28] and
[3:29] we can we can receive wisdom by looking
[3:32] at the fruit of other people's lives
[3:35] and how they are acting how they are
[3:38] responding and we watch it more than
[3:40] what we'll give up or what more than
[3:42] what we'll admit sometimes that we're
[3:44] very observant of other people's lives
[3:47] and uh often we compare ourselves and
[3:50] the bible says talks about comparing
[3:52] yourselves and evan brother branham
[3:55] mentions also about comparing ourselves
[3:58] and everybody's trying to keep up with
[3:59] the joneses and get what the next person
[4:01] has so in doing that we're always
[4:03] observing we're always looking and those
[4:05] who are on social media are always
[4:07] watching someone else and whether we
[4:09] realize that
[4:10] we learn from that and we take
[4:12] instruction from that and we can be
[4:14] influenced from that and we watch how
[4:16] people act and so we can be watching
[4:19] from sometimes
[4:21] and watch not just a day not just a
[4:23] moment but we can watch for uh many many
[4:26] years from a distance
[4:28] we can watch years unfold in a person's
[4:31] life and then we can see the end result
[4:34] of a person's life and we can observe
[4:36] and see we can watch them for years and
[4:38] then we see the end result of what
[4:40] direction they went and what they did
[4:42] and we can see the fruit of that and
[4:45] sometimes when we look at a life we're
[4:47] impressed sometimes we say we conclude
[4:50] and say you know what if i would like my
[4:52] life to end i would like to end it to
[4:55] end that way um sometimes we are
[4:58] attracted to a life and we say i would
[5:00] like to be more like that there's
[5:02] several mentors in my life that i that i
[5:04] look to and i've looked up to and many
[5:07] of them some of them are even in this
[5:08] church but many of them around the world
[5:10] and i'm glad that god put somebody there
[5:12] because paul said in the bible follow me
[5:15] as i follow christ
[5:17] follow in other words if christ is in
[5:19] that person and you see the fruit of
[5:21] them growing in the fruit of christ then
[5:23] we realize that's a person to follow
[5:25] that's a person to look to and i've said
[5:27] i said i want to be i want i don't want
[5:28] to be like that person i tease preachers
[5:30] sometimes because i'll i'll say them
[5:32] even sometimes when they're younger but
[5:33] when i see something good in them i tell
[5:35] them i want to be just like you when i
[5:37] grow up
[5:38] and uh they kind of chuckle at that
[5:40] because they say the same thing back to
[5:42] me but that's that's something that we
[5:44] look at because we as we get older we
[5:46] look at and we observe things and we see
[5:48] good things and so we're sometimes we're
[5:50] impressed with watching people's lives
[5:52] but sometimes we're disappointed and
[5:54] then we learn from that and watching
[5:56] them and we conclude i don't want to be
[5:58] that way i don't want it to end up that
[6:00] way i don't want to take the same path
[6:02] that that one took
[6:04] i remember uh in the bible there was one
[6:06] of the patriarchs i believe it was isaac
[6:08] or excuse me um jacob and uh uh he he
[6:12] had said when his sons went and uh took
[6:14] the the men of the city and
[6:17] one of them had violated their uh their
[6:20] sister and so they went all the brothers
[6:22] and they went and uh circumcised all the
[6:24] men and
[6:25] and and killed some of them and the
[6:28] daddy didn't know they wouldn't get it
[6:29] when they come back he said you
[6:30] shouldn't have done that and then he
[6:31] prayed he says lord let me not come into
[6:34] that type of anger that's the way he
[6:35] quoted he says lord let me never come
[6:37] into that type of anger so he's saying
[6:39] i've seen what they've done but oh lord
[6:41] i don't want to take that path and
[6:43] sometimes you can look at a life and say
[6:44] i know i don't want to take that path
[6:46] and sometimes you see the path they took
[6:48] and you see the end result and when you
[6:50] see the end result then i know i don't
[6:52] take that path
[6:54] and and a lot of this is learning a lot
[6:56] of this is is growing and i don't want
[6:59] to take that path that didn't work out
[7:01] so well even young people can do that
[7:03] now they can look at people's lives
[7:04] where they ended up and you can learn
[7:06] from that you can get instruction from
[7:08] that and say now if i make the same
[7:10] choices then i could end up the same way
[7:13] so now i have a chance here to make the
[7:15] right choice so my end result isn't that
[7:18] can you say amen
[7:19] and and how many know that a life speaks
[7:21] louder than words life speaks something
[7:24] so when you watch a life you can learn
[7:26] from it we're watching we're watching it
[7:29] and guess what kids don't miss very much
[7:33] kids don't miss very much kids catch a
[7:35] lot more than what we realize i actually
[7:38] believe that what we see
[7:40] has more effect on us than what we are
[7:41] taught
[7:43] i really believe that and that's after i
[7:44] didn't believe that early on as a pastor
[7:46] or a young pastor but i believe it now
[7:48] that it has a great effect upon us what
[7:51] we catch and what we observe and what we
[7:53] see in images you can tell a teenager
[7:56] all day long don't do this don't start
[7:58] that don't get that started don't let
[8:00] that in your life and they many times
[8:02] struggle with it because basically it's
[8:04] an instruction from a parent or a pastor
[8:06] and from the scripture don't do that
[8:08] don't do that and so they struggle with
[8:10] it they're still blind to maybe where it
[8:12] would go if they make that choice until
[8:15] until they would look at the lives who
[8:17] took that path and when they really look
[8:19] at that then that's a greater revelation
[8:21] to realize not only does the word say it
[8:24] not only does my parents say it but
[8:26] somebody who took that path this is
[8:28] where they ended up
[8:30] so it's instructional isn't it it
[8:32] teaches us
[8:33] and watching the lives of people
[8:35] sometimes young people make the choice
[8:37] as they watch a divide in marriage
[8:39] they'll make a choice now i'm going to
[8:41] look at the life of my mom and my dad
[8:43] and unfortunately that's unvery it's the
[8:45] most unfortunate thing for a kid to have
[8:47] to make a choice between mom and dad but
[8:49] they're allowed by the courts to make a
[8:50] choice what do you want to do get to a
[8:52] certain age which one do you want to be
[8:53] with and they'll look at what they feel
[8:55] the security in their hearts and the
[8:57] comfort in their hearts this is
[8:59] something i feel more secure with to go
[9:01] with this is what i'd like my life to be
[9:03] someday and see all these things have an
[9:06] effect on us and we are we are
[9:08] instructed by certain things as we watch
[9:11] lives and uh you know you take a
[9:14] teenager that won't listen take them to
[9:16] a prison sometime let them sit all day
[9:18] in a prison and let them talk to people
[9:20] in the prison and by the way they will
[9:21] talk to you especially a young teen and
[9:24] they'll share their life and they'll
[9:25] share the choices they make and
[9:28] sometimes there's even a a documentary
[9:30] that was mentioned to me by brother mike
[9:32] carter and they actually do that they
[9:34] take kids that are making the wrong
[9:35] choices and they take them to a prison
[9:37] and let them sit down all day with them
[9:39] and then they they let them talk with
[9:40] them they see their lives they see where
[9:42] they're at how tragic it was and see
[9:44] where they're at now and it actually in
[9:46] some cases can sober the kid up and to
[9:48] realize listen this has been something
[9:50] to me i don't want to take this path
[9:54] so uh you know i think these things are
[9:57] are
[9:59] something that jesus said
[10:01] we shall know them
[10:03] by their fruits
[10:05] not by the seed
[10:07] but by the fruits the fruits the seed
[10:09] produced
[10:10] so and the interesting thing about a
[10:12] seed is you can look at this you can't
[10:14] see a seed until you put it in the
[10:16] ground then you can you see it but you
[10:18] can't see it when you put it in the
[10:19] ground so a seed the seed form a lot of
[10:22] that we don't see it's not visible but
[10:24] we see the fruit of a seed so we see the
[10:27] life of a person we see what it produced
[10:29] can you say about and we make choices
[10:32] based upon the fruits and jesus said you
[10:34] shall know them by the fruits a man told
[10:38] me one time here many years ago and as i
[10:41] was laboring and preaching against
[10:43] watching worldly movies and
[10:46] these chick flicks and sometimes things
[10:48] under a category of maybe not a rated r
[10:51] but just a chick flicks and it's a
[10:52] romantic comedy and so i was just really
[10:56] blasting that thing that it can be just
[10:57] as damaging to your spirit and your mind
[11:00] and every time you get on those you're
[11:01] not a very popular preacher because
[11:03] sometimes people give a lot of room in
[11:05] their lives privately to watch these
[11:08] chick flicks
[11:10] and
[11:11] but i was noticing he come up right out
[11:13] to me after the service he says that's
[11:14] exactly the truth and you need to preach
[11:16] on that he says i'm i i and i don't want
[11:20] to describe too many details but he said
[11:22] i can tell you clearly that the start of
[11:25] my wife and i divorcing the start of it
[11:27] and adultery in the marriage the start
[11:29] of it was that we sat
[11:31] countless hours and watched these
[11:33] romantic comedies and watched these
[11:35] these netflix and he said then that's
[11:37] that's where it ended up
[11:40] he said that's the start of an adultery
[11:42] in a marriage
[11:43] so if you could see the devastation
[11:45] you'd make this different choices
[11:47] sometimes can you say amen
[11:49] kind of quiet tonight but i'm going to
[11:50] continue on
[11:52] this is what solomon did here in the
[11:54] text when we read that he got a huge
[11:57] lesson by walking by someone's garden
[12:00] someone's yard solomon walked by a
[12:02] vineyard and he seen the garden not kept
[12:05] up
[12:06] seeing the garden was not kept up so
[12:08] things were falling apart and there was
[12:10] weeds growing and there was nettles
[12:12] growing and there was thorns coming up
[12:14] and so he seen the vineyard and he seen
[12:16] this garden was not thriving it wasn't
[12:19] producing like it should it wasn't
[12:21] beautiful like it should be and he
[12:23] observed it and said he's seen things
[12:25] overgrowing and things coming out and
[12:28] and so and i'm sure that person that
[12:30] owned the house and vineyard they
[12:32] started out they wanted a beautiful
[12:33] every person's want it's a beautiful
[12:35] vineyard a beautiful yard or a beautiful
[12:39] thing
[12:40] but we all realize that if we watch all
[12:42] the if we if we look in all the
[12:44] magazines of the beautiful landscape
[12:46] yards uh it doesn't happen
[12:48] just by a picture
[12:51] can i get an amen out of that tonight at
[12:53] least you know you can look at it all
[12:55] you want to but it takes a lot of work
[12:57] it takes a lot of effort and then once
[12:59] you get it in and it looks beautiful
[13:01] then it takes a lot of work after that
[13:03] to keep it thriving to keep it beautiful
[13:05] can you say ma'am that's why i don't
[13:07] like gardens i don't like to plant all
[13:08] this stuff because there's you know
[13:11] weeds that come up and things and so i
[13:13] in the family get left with weeding and
[13:16] why have a garden when it's going to be
[13:18] all suffocating with weeds and all that
[13:20] and that's just the personal little uh
[13:23] trouble that i have with gardens
[13:27] but you see now uh
[13:29] solomon said it's evident that this
[13:31] person in this so solomon he looked at
[13:34] the garden and he looked at this and it
[13:36] was actually a reflection of the person
[13:38] a bit now that seems a bit critical but
[13:40] it is what it is
[13:42] you know brother burley has been telling
[13:43] me that for two weeks you know it is
[13:45] what it is
[13:47] i love how black people say it it is
[13:49] what it is but paul
[13:52] but but it is your life and you your
[13:56] your home and your life and your
[13:58] finances and things like that it can
[14:00] reflect something that might be lacking
[14:02] in your life and people get defensive
[14:04] when you talk about it but solomon's
[14:07] doing that he's walking by this i'm sure
[14:08] it was a nice person i'm sure they had a
[14:10] great goal to have a vineyard they had a
[14:12] beautiful fruit coming from it grapes
[14:14] and all but it was evident that the
[14:15] person in the house was not willing to
[14:17] put in the time it takes to keep it
[14:20] flourishing and to keep it growing and
[14:22] there was visible outside things that
[14:24] became a reflection of the person in the
[14:27] house because he made that diagnosis he
[14:30] right away called him a sloth he said
[14:31] he's this is a slawful person and he did
[14:34] it by looking at what was taking place
[14:36] outside uh and so so now the visible
[14:39] outside became a reflection of the
[14:41] person in the house and solomon said
[14:43] he's slaughtered
[14:44] and slaughtered means lazy and uh
[14:47] slaughter also means the lack of courage
[14:50] i thought this was interesting an
[14:51] interesting meaning to laziness because
[14:54] we look at laziness a certain way but in
[14:56] the spiritual way
[14:58] laziness is a lack of courage and zeal
[15:02] for the great things god has in store
[15:05] for those who love him
[15:07] can i say it again
[15:10] laziness spiritually is is is kind of
[15:13] the lack of courage or zeal for the
[15:16] great things god has in store for them
[15:18] that love him god has great things in
[15:20] store god has more fruit to bear from
[15:22] your life
[15:23] when jesus in john 15 was speaking about
[15:26] abide in the vine you shall bring forth
[15:28] more fruit and then he goes and said
[15:30] then you'll be pruned and you'll bring
[15:32] even more fruit can you say amen and
[15:34] then he says in other states he said you
[15:35] bring forth much fruit more fruit much
[15:38] fruit and as god keeps pruning us and we
[15:41] keep yielding and he keeps cleaning the
[15:42] garden and all these other things he
[15:44] wants us to bring forth more fruit
[15:48] from this garden that god has given us
[15:49] can you say amen so now i'm reading
[15:52] again the laziness the lack of courage
[15:55] and zeal for the great things god has in
[15:58] store for them that love them how many
[16:00] know that god has great things in store
[16:02] for them that love him
[16:04] we know that can you say man but we we
[16:07] don't want to offer a slackness or a
[16:09] slothfulness or a laziness towards god
[16:12] when we know that there are weeds
[16:14] growing in our garden when we know that
[16:16] there's something that's growing within
[16:17] us and we won't address it we'll let it
[16:19] overgrow everything we can't ignore it
[16:22] can you say amen we have to be willing
[16:24] to say if i want the results that god
[16:26] has promised me then i got to be willing
[16:29] to take these weeds and things in my
[16:30] life and really be serious with them
[16:34] hallelujah solomon said he's lawful he's
[16:37] lazy and then he says the end result
[16:39] will be poverty and an armed robber
[16:42] that's what it means there the end
[16:44] result of that person's life will be
[16:45] poverty in other words they were getting
[16:47] fruit there from their garden but after
[16:49] all the weeds grow up and take away he
[16:50] has no fruit he has nothing to eat and
[16:52] so now he has to go to extreme measures
[16:55] to steal food from someone else an armed
[16:58] robber would go steal food an armed
[17:00] robber if they're not if listen let me
[17:02] say it this way and i'm jumping quickly
[17:04] through things here if they refuse to
[17:06] make their own garden flourish to feed
[17:08] themselves so they'll start stealing
[17:11] from others or bumming off of others or
[17:14] mooching off of others
[17:17] let me say this
[17:19] if if if you don't get the holy spirit
[17:22] yourself then you'll mooch off the holy
[17:24] spirits from somebody else and you can't
[17:26] do that they said give us of your oil we
[17:28] don't have enough for ourselves go and
[17:30] buy and get your own oil
[17:33] amen so now we can't mooch out with
[17:35] somebody else this is your own garden
[17:37] this is your own place to flow this is
[17:39] your own spiritual walk and guess what
[17:41] if everybody falls by the wade side
[17:44] you're not going to want to be depending
[17:45] on them can you say amen if you have to
[17:47] stand alone you want to say lord i'll
[17:49] stand with you and this is my garden and
[17:52] i want my garden to flourish in the name
[17:54] of the lord hallelujah
[17:56] this is mine if i'm only the only one
[17:59] sitting in church on the front row uh
[18:01] which we don't have too many on the
[18:02] front row but lord if i'm the only one
[18:05] i'll be there i'll be worshiping the
[18:07] song leader is going to see me entering
[18:08] in if everybody forsakes this thing i'll
[18:11] be standing because i need the word
[18:13] every day i need to flourish i want to
[18:15] thrive spiritually can you say amen i
[18:17] want to stay in the spirit of revival
[18:20] blessed be his name
[18:22] so this text could be taken many ways
[18:25] it has good lessons in it that i could
[18:27] preach many ways it has good work ethic
[18:29] i could preach on that
[18:31] it it it shows what it leads to leads to
[18:33] poverty i could preach this text and
[18:35] preach about procrastination
[18:37] procrastination i could preach about
[18:39] business
[18:40] i could talk about wealth
[18:42] i could talk about good gardening
[18:46] it's all in there
[18:48] but that's not my subject tonight
[18:51] my subject is pulling crabgrass
[18:57] because i hate crabgrass i hate it
[19:00] and
[19:03] this this lesson tonight that i want to
[19:05] take from this scripture is about thorns
[19:08] and nettles and crabgrass
[19:12] and things that we need to weed out
[19:15] and they're not being weeded out
[19:18] this is a spiritual lesson in laziness
[19:20] spiritual laziness
[19:22] to not root out things
[19:25] that take over
[19:26] a good spirit-filled life
[19:29] be not willing
[19:30] to address what it is that's starting to
[19:33] grow
[19:33] slowly
[19:35] not willing to do it and ignoring it and
[19:38] you can't thrive
[19:39] spiritually
[19:41] that's what this is about tonight so
[19:43] it's about pulling crabgrass and i want
[19:44] to be specific about it so it's about
[19:47] these things my subject is pulling
[19:48] crabgrass because i hate crabgrass
[19:52] crabgrass is trying to be real grass and
[19:54] it's not real grass it doesn't look like
[19:55] rugrats it looks close sometimes but
[19:58] it's not real grass it's crabgrass and
[20:00] it gets right in the middle of real
[20:02] grass and it makes it look bad and this
[20:04] fella in proverbs was not willing to see
[20:07] it and to do something about it and if
[20:10] you don't deal with it it begins to take
[20:12] over it begins to keep growing and the
[20:15] term is grown over everything else grown
[20:17] over and that's that's what you got to
[20:19] look at is that when these things are
[20:20] let go in your life then they grow over
[20:24] the other things
[20:26] grown over they're not meant to be there
[20:28] they're squelching you spiritually
[20:30] they're holding you back and they grow
[20:32] over everything else and it breaks a
[20:34] makes a real
[20:35] bad journey so this thing of addressing
[20:38] our spiritual life and our garden
[20:40] started at the beginning when in genesis
[20:43] 2 15 it says adam and eve he put them in
[20:46] the garden
[20:47] to dress it and to keep it
[20:50] he put them in the garden of eden to
[20:51] dress it so this is part of the original
[20:53] plan of god and i know that was a
[20:55] literal garden of eden but it has a
[20:57] spiritual connotation we preach out of
[20:59] genesis all the time about adam and eve
[21:01] about the first adam the second adam we
[21:03] preach everything so don't leave this
[21:05] part out that god puts a man and woman
[21:09] in a garden to dress it and to keep it
[21:12] and the word keep of course means to
[21:14] guard it so there's a certain guard you
[21:16] put over it from animals getting in or
[21:19] that's why they put a wall up sometimes
[21:20] they that's why they put certain
[21:22] fake animals to scare other animals or
[21:24] scarecrow or whatever but what are you
[21:26] doing you're guarding your garden you're
[21:28] guarding it when you're asleep you're
[21:29] guarding it when you're away because
[21:31] other things could get in and destroy
[21:32] your garden he put them in the garden of
[21:34] eden to dress it and to keep it to guard
[21:36] it and but but to dress it uh he said i
[21:39] put them there to to to guard it but to
[21:43] dress a garden means to preserve it to
[21:45] preserve it and to preserve a garden you
[21:48] have to pull things out that don't
[21:50] belong there
[21:52] that's what adam and eve were given as a
[21:54] commission
[21:55] to dress and to guard to preserve
[21:58] to protect this is what they were given
[22:01] and we don't have those things literally
[22:03] today
[22:04] we have a spiritual inheritance we have
[22:06] a spiritual place that god is planting
[22:09] seeds
[22:10] how many knows where the the mind is the
[22:13] womb to the soul the mind is where the
[22:14] seed is planted
[22:15] we want it to drop from the mind to
[22:18] revelation
[22:19] but it starts in the mind
[22:21] and when the mind is all messed up and
[22:23] the mind is too busy and the mind is
[22:24] confused or the mind is filled with
[22:26] pornography or the mind is filled with
[22:29] people that hurt you or the thinking
[22:31] life is filled with all kinds of trash
[22:34] god can't plant that seed properly in
[22:36] you because your mind's all messed up
[22:39] so we're guards over our minds we're
[22:41] preserving our minds because that's the
[22:43] betting ground to plant god's seeds can
[22:45] you say amen so this vessel is a garden
[22:47] of god this vessel is a is this garden
[22:50] that he's given us to to dress and to
[22:52] keep and to guard over and to watch over
[22:54] our minds and to watch over our spirits
[22:56] because god is wanting to bring forth
[22:58] more fruit from our lives so in this
[23:01] man's garden in proverbs it says thorns
[23:03] were there and you know what i'm going
[23:05] to jump to the meetings now thorns speak
[23:07] of defenses
[23:09] thorns speak of defenses
[23:12] brother brandon i'm going to need a
[23:14] a plug-in here my my
[23:16] ipad is going out
[23:20] thorns speak of defenses
[23:23] thorns poke other people
[23:26] thorns
[23:27] say back off
[23:29] isn't that what ellie says sometimes
[23:31] back off get back
[23:34] thorns are defenses that we have the
[23:36] prophet spoke of the desert
[23:39] and everything in the desert becomes
[23:41] thorny and sticky
[23:44] in the desert
[23:45] brother ryan you lived out in arizona
[23:48] everything becomes thorns and sticky and
[23:50] brother might say because it's a lack of
[23:51] water
[23:53] there's a lack of moisture so that's the
[23:54] problem with that but thorns when they
[23:56] come up and it's more thorns than it is
[23:58] fruits more thorns then it speaks of our
[24:00] defenses and that we poke other people
[24:03] and that we don't have fruit coming of
[24:04] our life but we have more more defense
[24:06] systems and mechanisms set up in our
[24:08] life and then when it moves to the word
[24:10] uh nettles it talks of thorns and it
[24:13] speaks of nettles or nettle or nettles
[24:16] when it speaks of that then we realize
[24:19] you probably didn't know what nettles
[24:21] was
[24:22] if you did you're really good
[24:24] but i didn't know that so if you're
[24:26] asking i'm going to tell you tonight it
[24:28] is an herbal plant back in that day it
[24:31] still is today and they actually use
[24:32] some of it for medicinal purposes or
[24:34] whatever but the problem with the
[24:36] nettles plant is that it's got some fine
[24:39] hairs on the leaves and and the stems
[24:42] that if they're touched to the skin they
[24:44] get irritating to the skin that's not
[24:46] meant to be that's not meant to be
[24:48] you're coming in the garden to grab some
[24:49] grapes and you get over it because it's
[24:51] overgrown you get thorns in you and also
[24:54] you get this uh this nettles plant that
[24:56] is if you touch it to your skin it's
[24:58] kind of like poison ivy it becomes
[25:00] irritating to the skin and another
[25:02] meaning to nettles that is that is
[25:05] actually not related to the plant means
[25:07] to irritate or to annoy
[25:11] i was nettled by bertha's tone with me
[25:14] today
[25:16] bertha
[25:18] why do you use bertha because then i'm
[25:20] safe not using everybody's name here
[25:23] there's not too many birthers in the
[25:24] world
[25:25] i was neddled by bertha's tone today he
[25:28] was irritated you were annoyed because
[25:31] because because bertha was being
[25:33] annoying to you i know nobody in your
[25:35] life is annoying to you here tonight but
[25:37] just for the sake of talking about it i
[25:39] was nettled by bertha's tone so it's to
[25:41] irritate to annoy when you're in a place
[25:43] in your life and you've got thorns and
[25:46] nettles and crabgrass and you're crabby
[25:51] you're irritating everybody
[25:53] you're annoying everybody
[26:01] and and so crab grass is actually simmer
[26:04] to similar to that nettles and that's
[26:06] why i use the text because a cr crab
[26:08] crabgrass is a creeping grass i don't
[26:11] even like the name already the meaning a
[26:13] creeping a creeping grass if you're real
[26:16] grass you don't need to creep
[26:19] it's just something
[26:21] devilish about that whole thing creep
[26:24] you have to creep you just grow up as
[26:26] healthy grass
[26:28] but when you're creeping there's already
[26:29] something wrong with you you gotta go
[26:32] it's a creeping grass that can become a
[26:35] serious weed
[26:38] creeps up
[26:40] and i'm right in season here because
[26:42] it's creeping up in your yard
[26:44] as we speak
[26:47] it's going on i got this beautiful yard
[26:49] i've actually conditioned it and
[26:51] fertilized it my goal like i said is
[26:53] have my yard like
[26:55] john garrett someday when i grow up
[26:58] and i put it i do it and with all of
[27:01] that then all of a sudden these little
[27:03] odd strains
[27:05] grass with
[27:07] with legs that are growing out
[27:11] guy says crabgrass is appropriately
[27:13] named as it often grows low to the
[27:15] ground spreading outwards you're
[27:18] supposed to go upward and you're
[27:19] spreading outwards
[27:21] resembling a crab and that's where
[27:24] crabgrass
[27:27] and the legs just to kind of grow out
[27:30] from it
[27:32] and like this nettles it just keeps
[27:34] growing and growing and takes over and
[27:37] it sucks the life from the good things
[27:39] and so uh i don't i won't go on but i'll
[27:42] just say it's got to be pulled up from
[27:44] the roots
[27:46] can you say man
[27:47] it's got to be pulled up from the roots
[27:49] there's no other way to deal with it and
[27:51] if we don't deal with i'm going to be
[27:52] direct if we don't deal with our
[27:54] defenses our thorns our anger our
[27:58] resentment our crabbiness
[28:00] our victim mentality
[28:05] our negativity our complaining our
[28:07] crabbiness if we don't deal with it it
[28:11] will just keep growing in our life and i
[28:13] know this is a simple message to you
[28:15] tonight but it's where the rubber meets
[28:17] the road if you ignore the crab grass in
[28:20] your life it'll take over the good
[28:22] that's in you
[28:25] it'll smother out living in the spirit
[28:26] of god
[28:28] we can't be lazy can you say a man about
[28:30] something in our life that's irritating
[28:32] others and irritating us it should be
[28:34] irritating you
[28:36] and we can't be lazy about that it's
[28:38] going to keep growing and it's time to
[28:40] get it out and to root it out and to say
[28:43] well some people say well that wasn't
[28:45] that wasn't really me
[28:47] i've had a bad week that really wasn't
[28:48] me well if it wasn't really you then get
[28:51] it out of you
[28:54] because it's taken over your garden
[28:57] people said
[28:58] well that i acted out of place but that
[29:00] wasn't really me well if it wasn't you
[29:02] then why did you do it
[29:06] if it's not a part of your garden it's
[29:08] not a part of your plan it's not a part
[29:10] of your vineyard it doesn't fit the word
[29:12] don't be criticizing somebody else look
[29:14] at your own garden say do i have some
[29:16] crabgrass here do i have some nettles
[29:18] here do i have some thorns in my life
[29:21] can you say man
[29:22] that i'm ignoring and it's becoming
[29:24] irritating to my wife or to my husband
[29:26] or to my children
[29:30] praise the lord
[29:32] i'll tell you where this little lesson
[29:33] started i won't be long tonight this
[29:35] little lesson started when i seen some
[29:37] crabgrass in our church landscape out
[29:39] here last week
[29:42] and i said i get mad at it
[29:45] and i get upset
[29:47] and i just said it needs attention now
[29:50] uh
[29:52] and i there was more out there growing
[29:55] than what we could actually see from a
[29:56] distance and maybe that's why we didn't
[29:58] recognize it but so in the heat the
[30:01] extreme heat last week i got down
[30:04] on my hands and knees
[30:06] i used to make fun of people
[30:08] old people especially that got down
[30:11] and i'd watch them all day in their
[30:12] front yard in their gardens and in their
[30:14] landscape down in their hands and knees
[30:17] i laughed at them for years because
[30:18] they're they're
[30:20] they're pulling
[30:21] everyone out pulling everyone out for
[30:23] hours in the heat and i laugh because as
[30:25] a young person you say
[30:27] you know there's other things for that
[30:31] you know i was going to title this
[30:32] message tonight
[30:34] the young use a weed whacker
[30:36] the old pull it out from the roots
[30:44] put that one as the title because it's
[30:45] working better
[30:50] i thought about that when i was out
[30:52] there in that heat
[30:54] i said i thought all those years i've
[30:55] been laughing at those people and i'd be
[30:57] getting the weed whacker and thinking
[30:59] that's that's that's solving the problem
[31:01] and you know why we choose it because
[31:02] it's the easy way
[31:04] we choose the wing whacker because it's
[31:06] a quick and now we got batteries i got
[31:08] the battery we whackers you don't have
[31:09] to string the cord all the way out there
[31:11] it's got a good battery you can go for a
[31:13] long time and you weed whack off the top
[31:15] of the weeds but you're not pulling it
[31:17] out by the root
[31:19] now i'm describing many many christians
[31:22] today
[31:23] including in our message ranks that are
[31:25] willing to come into service and the
[31:27] weed rocket whacker knocks the surface
[31:30] things off and you feel good for a while
[31:32] but nobody hardly is willing to stay
[31:34] with it until god you say god i want you
[31:37] to root this out of my life
[31:41] but when you get older you don't think
[31:43] in the terms of young because you
[31:44] realize all the years i'm whacking that
[31:46] off it's not doing any good i'm gonna
[31:47] have to get down as an old person even
[31:49] not even when your back problems
[31:51] everything else i'm gonna have to lay
[31:52] down there like they're doing and i'm
[31:54] gonna have to grab that and pull it out
[31:56] by the roots it's the only way to solve
[31:58] it i know there's fertilizer and there's
[32:00] pesticides and all that and i use them
[32:02] too
[32:04] but i haven't had a lot of success with
[32:06] them
[32:07] and next summer crabgrass is going to
[32:08] come up again but i'm telling you
[32:11] there's a lesson to be learned and that
[32:13] we grow older even in our spiritual walk
[32:15] that we don't want to just take these
[32:17] these brother branham called him in
[32:19] meetings and in conventions and camp
[32:22] meetings he said we get on these these
[32:24] shallow bubble dances
[32:27] instead of settle down in the real
[32:29] reality of god
[32:32] shallow bubble dances where we feel good
[32:34] and shout for a week but we're right
[32:36] back to our same habits right back to
[32:38] the same things in our life and i'm not
[32:40] against shouting i believe in it praise
[32:41] the lord you did it but my question is
[32:43] is the holy spirit dealing deep enough
[32:45] with you that it's rooting things out of
[32:47] your life i've watched many young people
[32:49] go from dancing and shouting right back
[32:51] to their habit of pornography i've
[32:53] watched many adults go right back from
[32:55] these services right back to their anger
[32:57] right back to their they're treating
[32:58] their wife bad treating their husband
[33:00] bad and if anybody's listening i'll tell
[33:02] you that's just using a weed whacker on
[33:04] your problems it's not getting to the
[33:06] root of it can i get an amen here
[33:08] tonight
[33:11] and i'll be the weed whacker i'll do it
[33:12] but i'm not interested in just weed
[33:14] whacking i'm interested in you find the
[33:16] kernel of the problem
[33:18] saying lord deal with me and root this
[33:20] out of my life
[33:23] praise the lord
[33:24] i could not believe sitting out there
[33:26] in the heat
[33:28] for an hour and a half i couldn't
[33:29] believe how hard it was
[33:31] this was a lesson for me and i'm just
[33:32] telling you how hard it was after that
[33:35] gets rooted down to pull it out i hardly
[33:38] had the strength my it took all of my
[33:40] strength
[33:41] to to pull because it got so big and
[33:43] pull it and then some of the roots grew
[33:45] under the edge of the blacktop and they
[33:46] were worse and they must know that if i
[33:48] grow further under the blacktop nobody
[33:50] can get me out
[33:52] the devilish mind of their own
[33:57] just
[33:57] shaking that thing said how far do you
[34:00] go down there am i going to pull up the
[34:02] entire driveway here
[34:05] just down there and rooted in but guess
[34:08] what no matter how hard it is i would
[34:10] never take the weed whacker to that it's
[34:12] not going to solve it i'm going to stay
[34:14] there and keep jerking on that thing
[34:16] until that whole entire route comes out
[34:18] of there is anybody listen to what i'm
[34:21] preaching here tonight i'm gonna stay
[34:22] with
[34:23] if you need the holy ghost you're gonna
[34:24] stay with it until god gives it to you
[34:26] if you need a deeper walk with god
[34:28] you're gonna stay with it you're gonna
[34:29] keep bringing that prayer before god if
[34:31] you've got habits in your life say god
[34:32] i'm going to stay before your throne
[34:34] until you take this habit away from me
[34:36] lord
[34:37] you don't quit can you say man you don't
[34:39] give up when you've got a garden and you
[34:40] want it to flourish you don't give up
[34:42] you keep working at it
[34:44] may god help us to keep working at it i
[34:47] laid out there for an hour and a half
[34:49] and you know just trying my best and
[34:51] pulling so hard on these things and you
[34:53] know what my thought was you want to
[34:54] know what i was thinking out there you
[34:56] know what came to me as i was jerking on
[34:58] these roots
[34:59] i said
[35:01] i'm out here doing this
[35:04] this is my thought
[35:06] but this is what i i'm doing these
[35:08] crabgrass but this is what i do every
[35:10] sunday in the pulpit
[35:16] so i thought that's what i'm doing every
[35:17] sunday in the pulpit
[35:19] for me for my life and for your life
[35:21] i'm pulling crab grass
[35:24] something's not a god i'm encourage you
[35:26] to pull it out
[35:31] don't deal with the surface things
[35:33] don't deal with just weed whacking it
[35:35] can you say amen
[35:37] and we can spray too
[35:39] poison can go to the roots
[35:41] but nothing is better than the old way
[35:43] can you say amen i rejoice when someone
[35:46] is willing to be honest and submit
[35:48] we have many in this congregation
[35:51] and i like the atmosphere maybe it's
[35:53] because it's the way i lean but i light
[35:55] people who will get real honest and real
[35:58] submissive to say i want to get to the
[36:02] bottom of my issues and why i'm acting
[36:04] the way i'm acting
[36:06] sometimes it ends up i need the holy
[36:08] ghost but sometimes it's not that
[36:10] sometimes that you're ignoring something
[36:11] that satan's using
[36:13] you're giving satan to territory
[36:16] and when we cross into this promised
[36:17] land of the life of the holy ghost no
[36:19] territory belongs to satan at all you
[36:21] got to go take it
[36:23] when they stepped over jordan and they
[36:25] had the whole land before them that new
[36:27] generation and god encouraged him and
[36:30] says i will be with you as i was with
[36:33] moses what a charge that should give to
[36:35] your hearts can you say man to tell
[36:37] joshua as i was with moses i will be
[36:40] with you you go and take it every place
[36:43] to foot your ghost
[36:44] every place your foot will get upon is
[36:47] your ground
[36:48] satan can be ran out of there
[36:51] and then later on in joshua's they
[36:53] conquered many of the lands he joshua
[36:56] when he when he was old
[36:58] he said stand up he says listen
[37:01] tell the rest of the tribe to be israel
[37:03] how long will you be slack concerning
[37:06] the promise there's still so much more
[37:08] land to possess you read your bible
[37:10] that's what it says there's still land
[37:12] to possess how many believe there's
[37:14] still land in your life to possess
[37:16] yeah we're still here there's still land
[37:18] to possess so we've got to be up and
[37:20] going we can't lay back we can't give up
[37:21] we can't get lazy now no it's too late
[37:24] to get lazy we got to take this whole
[37:26] promise and territory that satan is
[37:28] squatting on we got to say i'm going
[37:31] after him i'm kicking him out i'm taking
[37:33] the land i'm taking all of me body soul
[37:36] and spirit memory imagination conscience
[37:38] effect is reason see taste fill smell
[37:41] and hear can you say amen

[37:45] to god i'm going to take my territory
[37:47] away from satan somebody say praise the
[37:49] lord
[37:50] amen i rejoice when someone says i want
[37:53] to get to bother my issues
[37:54] because i want to know the why i know i
[37:56] do it but i want to know the why why do
[37:58] i do it how is satan connivingly getting
[38:01] to me with this
[38:02] not just a weed whack job at church
[38:05] and the same thing comes back again in
[38:07] your life six months later
[38:09] anybody listen to me tonight
[38:11] a weed whack at church in six months it
[38:13] pops up again and here you are got the
[38:15] same thing
[38:17] i told a man one time coming to my
[38:18] church years ago he doesn't attend here
[38:20] now
[38:22] i watched his life for a few months i
[38:23] watched his marriage
[38:25] and i said you know what your problem is
[38:26] you're an angry man
[38:28] you have unresolved anger
[38:31] from somewhere i don't even know where i
[38:33] don't know if the lord would tell me but
[38:34] you're an angry man and he got angry
[38:37] with me
[38:39] he did he got right in the parking lot
[38:41] he got angry from me saying that i'm
[38:43] just i'm just telling what the lord
[38:44] showed me i've been watching your life
[38:46] and you're making your wife the problem
[38:48] and you're making this the problem
[38:49] you're making the kids a problem and
[38:51] your wife ain't keeping their house
[38:52] clean enough and you're doing this and
[38:53] doing that i'm saying you're an angry
[38:55] man and your anger is bringing all this
[38:58] stuff to the surface and you're angry at
[39:00] everybody else but deep rooted there's a
[39:02] there's a churning anger towards
[39:04] something and he got angry with me and
[39:06] he he never never resolved it
[39:09] never tackled it
[39:11] i really believe there's rooted things
[39:13] sometimes
[39:14] that the holy spirit wants to take
[39:17] can you say amen
[39:19] just before we close let's go over to
[39:21] hebrews chapter 12 because paul brings
[39:23] it up here in the new testament so
[39:25] wonderfully
[39:27] spiritual garden he says here in hebrews
[39:29] chapter 12 wherefore seeing we also are
[39:32] compassed about was so great
[39:34] a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[39:36] every weight in the sin
[39:39] which does so easily beset us let us run
[39:42] with patience the race that it says
[39:43] before us looking into jesus the author
[39:46] and finish of our faith who for the joy
[39:48] that was set before him endured the
[39:49] cross
[39:50] despising the shame and is set down at
[39:52] the right hand of the throne of god for
[39:53] consider him that endured such
[39:55] contradiction of sinners against himself
[39:57] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[39:59] minds you have not yet resisted unto
[40:02] blood striving against sin and ye have
[40:04] forgotten
[40:06] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[40:08] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[40:10] my son
[40:12] despise not thou the chastening of the
[40:14] lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[40:16] him for whom the lord loveth he
[40:18] chasteneth and escorts us every son whom
[40:20] he receiveth if he endure chastening god
[40:24] dealeth with you as with sons for what
[40:26] sin is he whom shall the father say that
[40:29] jason and not if he's chastening you it
[40:31] shows you're a son but if you be without
[40:33] chastisement where of all are partakers
[40:36] then are ye bastards and not sons
[40:39] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[40:41] flesh which have corrected us and we
[40:43] gave them reverence shall we not much
[40:45] rather being subjected unto the father
[40:46] of spirit and live for verily
[40:49] for they verily for a few days
[40:51] chasteneth us for their own pleasure but
[40:54] he
[40:55] for our prophet that we might be
[40:56] partakers of his holiness now no
[40:59] chastening for the present seemeth to be
[41:01] joyous but grievous
[41:04] nevertheless catch it here we go now
[41:06] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[41:09] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[41:12] them which are exercised thereby
[41:15] he's talking about your garden
[41:18] bringing forth fruit can you say amen
[41:21] it yieldeth no chastening seems joyous
[41:24] from the present when you're getting
[41:25] rebuked and whipped by the father of
[41:27] spanking from the father i've never seen
[41:30] a kid with a smile on their face taking
[41:32] a whip in i've never seen him do it
[41:34] they're crying they're resisting they're
[41:35] saying no i don't want this spanking
[41:38] and so no he says no chastening for the
[41:41] president seemed to be joyous but
[41:43] grievous nevertheless after what it
[41:44] yieldeth peaceable fruit of
[41:46] righteousness unto them which are
[41:47] exercised thereof wherefore lift up the
[41:50] hands which hang down and the feeble
[41:52] knees and make straight to pass through
[41:54] your feet lest that which is lame be
[41:56] turned out of the way but let it rather
[41:57] be healed
[41:59] here we go now listen here's the garden
[42:00] here's the here's the yielding peaceable
[42:03] fruit by god's correction god rooting
[42:05] things out of our lives notice now he's
[42:08] make straight the path stand up you know
[42:10] in other words he's saying don't be lazy
[42:12] if god's given you correction don't be
[42:14] lazy with it stand up and take your
[42:16] correction
[42:17] then he says verse 14 follow peace with
[42:20] all men and holiness without which no
[42:22] one will see the lord looking diligent
[42:24] lest any man fail of the grace of god so
[42:27] now
[42:28] this subject of follow peace go back to
[42:30] the other one follow peace with all men
[42:34] follow peace with all men that's a daily
[42:37] life
[42:40] that's not just in church
[42:42] that's a daily walk of what people see
[42:45] in your life
[42:46] what you see in your life follow peace
[42:49] with all not crabgrass
[42:52] not crabbiness not uncontrolled anger
[42:56] not ungentleness and treating people
[42:58] wrong
[42:59] fought peace with
[43:01] just your family
[43:05] follow peace with just the selective
[43:07] ones you want to find relationship with
[43:10] and
[43:11] this is a goal in your garden of
[43:13] following peace with all men
[43:15] and holiness without which no man will
[43:16] see the lord the next one says looking
[43:19] diligently lest any man fail of the
[43:21] grace of god
[43:23] last
[43:24] last
[43:25] any route of bitterness springing up
[43:29] trouble you
[43:31] and not just trouble you
[43:34] thereby many
[43:35] be defiled
[43:38] that's my sermon to you leave it up
[43:40] there
[43:43] you fail of the grace of god you fail to
[43:45] have grace for others
[43:46] you fail to follow peace with all men
[43:49] you fail to receive the god's chastening
[43:52] if you get that long enough a root of
[43:54] bitterness will spring up in your life
[43:58] and trouble you
[44:01] and defile many
[44:04] why because crabgrass spreads
[44:08] spreads to others and someone can't walk
[44:10] in your garden in your vineyard because
[44:12] they're going to get thorns they're
[44:13] going to get defenses
[44:15] they're going to get
[44:17] poison ivy
[44:18] they're going to get
[44:20] nettles
[44:21] they're going to be irritated in their
[44:23] skin
[44:24] all this is happening
[44:26] because it's defiling others it's not
[44:28] just troubling you it's defiling others
[44:31] and if it doesn't trouble you there's
[44:33] something wrong
[44:34] when i get out of sorts it troubles me
[44:39] when something's springing up that's not
[44:42] of god
[44:43] i'm troubled
[44:45] and it should trouble us i'm not talking
[44:47] about everybody else's life and talk
[44:48] about our own life god
[44:51] where did that come from
[44:53] that was not of you
[44:54] that reaction was not polite that wasn't
[44:57] gentle
[44:59] please forgive me
[45:00] help me lord root that out of me what's
[45:02] making me angry i've often said before i
[45:04] learned as a young man to at least get
[45:06] the bottom of what's making me upset
[45:09] a lot of times it's the current person
[45:11] that's in front of you that you think
[45:12] you're upset at but it's something that
[45:14] happened that morning
[45:15] it's something somebody said
[45:17] it's something somebody said four days
[45:19] ago and because words have power over us
[45:22] they said it it was a negative thought
[45:24] they put you down whatever and that
[45:26] thing has stayed with you
[45:28] it's like i was preaching last week
[45:29] about lies lies have a power with them
[45:32] to bind you
[45:33] somebody speaks a lie over your life
[45:36] there's a delusion there's a cloud that
[45:38] comes over you if you believe it and you
[45:40] start you start mulling over that why
[45:42] did they say that and so what i learned
[45:44] early on in my life is to sit down start
[45:46] praying say now wait a minute first of
[45:48] all is what they said is it the truth
[45:52] so i'm exposing satan that's right if
[45:54] that worker if that co-worker said that
[45:58] is it the truth because if it's the
[46:00] truth and you're doing it then you've
[46:02] got to own up
[46:04] but a lot of times it's not you
[46:06] it's a lie that's told on you you're
[46:08] suffering from it so you sit there and
[46:10] say lord this is not true that's between
[46:12] them and god i forgive them i'm going on
[46:15] with you and if i did anything out of
[46:17] place i ask for your blood to cleanse me
[46:19] and forgive me
[46:21] and that's how you go on
[46:23] and so the crab grass has to be dealt
[46:25] with quickly because this brood of
[46:26] bitterness will continually affect
[46:29] others and will trouble you if you're
[46:30] not troubled by it then it's not a good
[46:32] thing i'm going to close now
[46:33] one more quote
[46:36] did i finish with hebrews wait a minute
[46:38] let me make sure i finish okay so lest
[46:41] any root of bitterness spring up trouble
[46:42] you and thereby many be defiled yes i
[46:45] was done right there so i'm going to
[46:46] read a quote to you it's an interesting
[46:48] quote
[46:49] because the prophet said probably about
[46:51] 12 to 15 times he said
[46:54] he referred to as the root word for
[46:57] cancer being crab
[47:00] and he'll refer to it here many times he
[47:02] does he refers to the cancer so we're
[47:04] we're aware of what cancer does it
[47:06] spreads like like a crab's legs or also
[47:09] like crab grass it spreads and goes this
[47:11] way and begins to go into your body and
[47:13] begins to grow today we have so many
[47:15] things we're trying to conquer it trying
[47:17] to do it through medicine but i know a
[47:19] god that has completely dissolved cancer
[47:22] completely killed it but i want you to
[47:23] notice what brother bram says here in
[47:25] this quote did you guys get it a lady
[47:27] sat right here in somewhere
[47:28] that was called and it was a sister by
[47:30] the name of bruce and i don't see her
[47:32] this morning but she was she's a very
[47:34] much of a woman to pray
[47:36] and this woman come in and it was last
[47:38] time i was here and there was no prayer
[47:40] cards give or nothing so there wouldn't
[47:41] be nobody no prayer lines so they just
[47:43] holy spirit just called her over the
[47:45] audience
[47:47] and this little miss bruce she she was
[47:49] healed once herself with cancer and she
[47:52] just always got a burden on her heart
[47:54] for somebody else who has cancer and she
[47:56] was just praying and there was a lady
[47:58] from louisville that was dying cancer in
[48:00] her throat and while she was praying the
[48:02] holy spirit goes right to that woman
[48:04] calls her and whatever it did tell her
[48:06] who she was tell her rather who she was
[48:08] and what her trouble was and about her
[48:10] having cancer and she said it would she
[48:14] said
[48:15] said she it said she would be all right
[48:17] and the little lady went home a couple
[48:19] days after that she just started
[48:22] choking to death nearly just her throat
[48:24] swelled up way up she gave a big cough
[48:27] and the cancer jumped right out and
[48:28] she's perfect you see
[48:30] what happened you see the lump itself
[48:33] is a malignancy that's got a life in it
[48:35] see
[48:36] cancer that comes from the that comes
[48:38] from the word the medical term crab
[48:41] which means
[48:43] it's got a lot of legs just stop right
[48:45] there
[48:46] so he's describing
[48:48] the cancer at a deeper level
[48:52] than just what we call it and the
[48:53] doctors call it right
[48:55] he's saying what it really is i remember
[48:59] the prophet talking about seeing things
[49:01] other in the other dimension and what
[49:03] demons look like they look different
[49:05] than what it is in the physical body
[49:06] demons and something physically in
[49:08] somebody but he would describe different
[49:10] things
[49:11] and uh you know he would describe like
[49:13] the depression demon is like a
[49:16] he used the term a cloud over a person i
[49:19] see a cloud over you and that's what it
[49:21] looked like in the other dimension
[49:23] but then that person's suffering with
[49:24] depression
[49:26] and i remember i was in a motel one day
[49:27] and i seen those commercials on
[49:29] depression medicine
[49:30] and they had a person walking around the
[49:32] yard trying to enjoy their children and
[49:35] they got a cloud
[49:36] just following them and they couldn't
[49:38] get away from the cloud and they're
[49:39] selling depression medicine
[49:42] which is fine but i thought wow that's
[49:44] the way brother branham described what
[49:46] it looks like in the other dimension
[49:50] and here now you know 70 years later
[49:52] they tap into it and that's the image
[49:54] they use
[49:55] for depression
[49:57] and then you know uh nelly sanders and
[50:00] how that big demon come out of there
[50:01] that was from when she danced on the
[50:03] dance floor it was a pretty ugly looking
[50:05] thing that come out of her in that
[50:07] in that demonic form
[50:10] they tell me one place the prophet says
[50:12] if you've seen the demon behind that
[50:15] woman that's dressed immodestly you
[50:17] would never look at her again i haven't
[50:19] found that one but there was some
[50:20] reference to it that if you could see if
[50:22] boys could see the demon behind her
[50:23] you'd never look at it again because a
[50:26] whole different picture in the other
[50:27] dimension
[50:28] it's demons
[50:30] cancer is a demon
[50:31] there's a life of that cancer somewhere
[50:33] but i want you to notice what he says
[50:35] what happened you see the lump itself as
[50:36] a malignancy and the medical turn of
[50:38] crab which means it's got a lot of legs
[50:40] and he says this like the crab you get
[50:42] from the seed and it sucks your blood
[50:43] from you and this malignant growth in
[50:45] your throat had it was what that's what
[50:48] it was doing see now i'm dealing
[50:50] this is the statement i want you to
[50:51] catch look at this look at this
[50:53] i'm not dealing with the growth i'm
[50:56] dealing with the life that's in the
[50:59] growth
[51:00] that's our holy spirit
[51:02] and he's still here tonight can you say
[51:04] amen
[51:05] he's not dealing with the growth he's
[51:07] not dealing with the actual
[51:10] visible crab grass or weed can you say
[51:12] man he's going to the root of the
[51:14] problem and the holy spirit did that
[51:16] through his ministry for countless years
[51:18] while god did that through the
[51:20] discernment i can tell you there's a
[51:22] nature of the holy spirit that we learn
[51:24] he never deals with you in a surface
[51:26] manner he's wanting to get to the source
[51:28] of the problem
[51:30] he did it through brother branham he
[51:31] does it today because he said the word
[51:33] is a discerner of the thoughts and the
[51:35] intents of the heart you stick around
[51:38] here and the holy spirit's here
[51:40] sometimes it may get a little
[51:41] uncomfortable
[51:43] not because i want to make it that way
[51:45] because we're not interested in just
[51:47] being patted on the back all the time
[51:49] we're saying lord is there something in
[51:51] me that's deeper that needs to be rooted
[51:52] out and that other person may never
[51:54] change themselves that other person may
[51:56] never ask forgiveness that other person
[51:58] may never do what he needs to do but i
[52:00] can go on victory as the holy spirit
[52:02] roots out the things out of my life can
[52:04] you say praise the lord tonight amen can
[52:06] you say praise the lord
[52:09] i love that
[52:10] and this is in 1963 all the way through
[52:12] all that ministry but he's letting it
[52:14] know i'm not dealing with the growth i'm
[52:16] dealing with a life that's in that
[52:18] growth see the life that's in the growth
[52:20] is what we're dealing with see in my
[52:22] name they shall cast out devils the word
[52:25] devil is tormentor like the body and
[52:27] this was the devil through his name we
[52:31] deal with the life of the problem the
[52:33] source of the problem can you say amen
[52:35] and in my name we shall cast out the
[52:37] devil that's the source of it
[52:40] go to the source of it go to the life of
[52:42] it that's why demons would tremble
[52:43] because there's a there's a life there
[52:45] attacking that life of the enemy
[52:48] and the holy spirit would just begin to
[52:50] draw things out not only problems with
[52:52] physical but you know problems
[52:54] emotionally problems mentally
[52:57] problems with
[52:59] nervousness everything but it wasn't
[53:00] just it wasn't the nervousness is
[53:03] what started it
[53:05] what caused it
[53:06] boy the moment the devil starts to see
[53:09] he's gonna get exposed
[53:10] he just starts to run
[53:13] i'm comfortable with that atmosphere
[53:15] because i want my garden to flourish in
[53:18] the lord
[53:20] i want to be a well-watered i want to
[53:22] stay in church so i can say keep the

[54:12] i can be watered so i don't become dry
[54:14] can you say amen
[54:16] you have a garden in your life
[54:19] sons and daughters of god
[54:20] that was adam and eve's commission to

[54:24] you have a garden in your life and it
[54:26] can be grown over
[54:28] with the wrong things
[54:31] but i'm here to tell you it can flourish
[54:34] as the holy spirit
[54:36] says what the prophet says i'm not here
[54:38] to deal
[54:40] with the visible part
[54:43] i'm here for in his name to cast out
[54:46] whatever is called and to root it up
[54:48] from the root
[54:50] take it from the very root and pull it
[54:51] up you know what guess what i couldn't
[54:53] get it out the other day i couldn't get
[54:55] it out
[54:58] and this it's the grace of god because
[55:00] when we can't discover what it is and we
[55:02] can't pull it out he says step aside if
[55:05] you let me i'll pull the root out for
[55:07] you
[55:10] good thing we don't have to do this
[55:11] gardening on our own
[55:14] but his holy spirit would just navigate
[55:16] our lives say there it is there would
[55:18] you like me to take that from your life
[55:20] how willing are you for me to take that
[55:21] jealousy and that crabbiness how willing
[55:24] are you and when willing says step aside
[55:26] i'll pull it out of you
[55:28] amen
[55:30] we can be close to the lord
[55:32] and that we can be a garden well watered
[55:34] amen let's stand and pray tonight
[55:44] precious jesus
[55:46] i've delivered my heart tonight lord in
[55:48] this simple message
[55:50] but i pray that it would have
[55:53] fruit come forth from my life
[55:56] and from the precious lives of these
[55:57] people
[55:59] they are your sons and daughters
[56:02] you loved them from the beginning lord
[56:05] and you loved them at calvary
[56:07] you loved them when you sent a prophet
[56:09] in the last days
[56:10] you showed your love again by making
[56:12] contact with us and speaking to us for
[56:15] this generation in this time
[56:17] even sometimes the devil tries to tell
[56:19] us well we don't have anything to go on
[56:21] for that this is a new problem in our
[56:23] society lord you have timeless truths
[56:26] and they address every problem with
[56:28] every society your holy ghost is the
[56:30] answer lord it is the answer i pray
[56:33] father that there will be some light
[56:35] come upon
[56:36] the people's lives tonight and they can
[56:37] look at themselves lord
[56:39] and as solomon walked by this person's
[56:41] yard
[56:43] and seen this great lesson and
[56:45] instruction he got from it may as we
[56:47] drop by your house tonight that we
[56:50] received instruction that we looked at
[56:52] things in a different way and seen lord
[56:54] that
[56:55] you said in john 15 you said
[56:58] that if you abide in me and i abide in
[57:00] you then you'll have fruit from your
[57:02] life you have fellowship and whatever
[57:04] you ask that that well i do this this
[57:07] part of being connected with you and
[57:08] being a healthy
[57:10] lord
[57:11] plant growing
[57:13] showing fruits bringing forth much more
[57:15] fruit the lord when we do that we can be
[57:17] a blessing to others lord but we must
[57:20] keep our gardens free
[57:22] of of animals getting in we must keep it
[57:26] free of bitterness
[57:27] we must keep it free of the crab grass
[57:30] and lord i see in this season of this
[57:32] heat it's amazing to me lord that
[57:36] that these type of weeds can thrive in
[57:38] the heat like this they don't need much
[57:40] moisture regular grass it needs moisture
[57:42] because they're a regular healthy plant
[57:44] that way but all these can thrive in
[57:47] just the heat with no moisture nothing
[57:49] it just begins to grow it's amazing to
[57:51] me lord that we don't have to
[57:52] necessarily be taught
[57:54] in crabbiness or bitterness and these
[57:56] things they just grab a hold of our
[57:58] lives and start to take a hold of us and
[58:00] lord we see this this summer in the
[58:02] natural and then we see it in the
[58:04] spiritual as well
[58:06] forgive us father wash us by your word
[58:08] lord may we find that
[58:10] close walk with you i pray
[58:13] through the holy ghost that we could be
[58:15] filled with your spirit and our minds
[58:18] to give our minds that is the womb to
[58:21] the soul the place where the seed is
[58:23] planted may we give our minds completely
[58:26] to you and yield to you father
[58:29] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[58:31] ask it
[58:32] amen
[58:34] amen thank mind
