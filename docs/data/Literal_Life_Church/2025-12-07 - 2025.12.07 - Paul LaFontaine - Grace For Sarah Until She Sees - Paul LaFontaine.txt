Nothing seemed to make the wrongs right. Oh, I can't believe the pain I've seen. But looking back to every step you never left. And I'm so thankful that I'm coming out the other side stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising, heart still raising. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Through the storms in hell and high water, I never left the hands of my father. I'm still breathing. Thank you, Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Oh, it cost me, but it taught me that you won't quit. How faithful, how amazing that your grace is. No matter what this life may bring, I know you'll bring me through. And even in my suffering, Lord, I can trust in you. I'm coming out the other side stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising, heart still raising. I'm made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Through the storms in hell and high water. I never left the hands of my father. I'm still breathing. Thank you, Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it to more than I thought that I could. I walked through the worst, but it worked for my good. It's a miracle that I can stand here and say I made it. Oh, I made it. I made it through more than I thought that I could. I walked through the worst, but it worked for my good. It's a miracle that I can stand here and say I made it. Oh, I made it. I'm coming out the other side stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising. Heart still raising. I made it.

Thank you for blessing us, girls. And if you know the testimonies of all three of these young sisters, they're still breathing. They've been through individually many, many things. They're still breathing. They made it. They're still here. Still believing. I say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a blessing, girls. Thank you. Through it all. A little bit higher. Through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Oh, through it all. Through it all. I've learned to depend upon you. So, let's stand together.

I thank God for the mountain. And I thank God for the valleys. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. For if I never had a problem, I'd never know that God could solve it. I'd never know what faith in God could do. That's the reason I say through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Hallelujah. Amen. Genesis chapter 18. And we look forward to hearing brother Eli Ortiz this Wednesday night. So we look forward to hearing him in the service. It's our my wife and I's anniversary. We will be here. But I thought I'd take that off and let brother Eli speak for us. So we're looking forward to that. Genesis 18 and verse one. And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamry. And he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day. And he lift up his eyes and looked and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant." So Abraham is seeing that this is not just ordinary men. It's not just an ordinary visitation. His eyes have already been open to who's who these men are and these angels are to visit him. So he has a revelation. He sees it and this is his reaction. He calls him Lord. Calls one of them Lord. If now I have found favor in thy sight passed on away I pray thee from thy servant. Let a little water I pray you be fetched and watch and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts. After that you pass on. For therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, "So do as thou had said." And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, "Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal. Knead it, and make cakes upon the earth." Isn't this like a a husband would do to his wife, uh, invites them all in and says, "We're going to make you a meal here." And then he goes back and says, "We got company. Make a meal right away." I told him. And he said, "We would make the meal." And his wife's probably going, "What you mean we just springs in on them. We're having people over. They're here already. I need you to make a meal." And Abraham ran into the herd and fetched the calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man, and he hasted to dress it. And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them, and he stood by them under the tree, and they did it did eat. And they said unto him, "Where is Sarah, thy wife?" And he said, "Behold, in the tent," and he said, "I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life." And lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son, and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well strucken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure with my lord, being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of surely bear a child which am old?" And before you're seated, I just make a comment here. A couple things that stick out to me in this. And that is Sarah has not seen uh what she needs to see yet. Abraham sees it all. And that's why he's reacting that this is the Lord visiting us. He's coming to confirm his promise from years ago. Sarah knew the promises as well, but she's not where Abraham is yet &gt;&gt; in her believing obviously. And actually, I'll say this, she's become a bit sarcastic about the promise. &gt;&gt; And this is what happens when you go for many years and you're slow to believe. You can actually become a bit bitter. You become sarcastic. And she's laughing in her heart. &gt;&gt; And uh Abraham sees something, but Sarah don't see it &gt;&gt; yet. That's right. &gt;&gt; How many know she sees it later? &gt;&gt; Well, obviously she did. &gt;&gt; But she don't see it right here. Even while the Lord's visiting, &gt;&gt; she don't see what And she's sarcastic. She's bitter. She's probably went through depression. She heard the promise because she's probably went through being depressed about the promise not coming after all these years. And now she can't even believe when the Lord is present, when he's confirming it. It's just where she's at. Abraham sees it. She don't. And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I have assurityity bear of a child which I'm old, is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son, not Hagar, not anyone else. Sarah, it will be you. &gt;&gt; Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not &gt;&gt; to the Lord. Most of us would write her off, &gt;&gt; but brother Bram says God couldn't. &gt;&gt; She was a part of the promise. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad when God can see beyond how we're acting sometimes? &gt;&gt; Cuz she's slow to believe this, but she's a part of the promise nonetheless. &gt;&gt; Sarah denied said, "I laugh not." So here she is lying to the Lord for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh and so you know the rest of the story there but just wanted to go over and confirm um if that's the end of the story it doesn't look good for Sarah but she actually made it over here into the hall of fame or the hall of faith Sarah made it into the hall of faith her name is mentioned in Hebrews 11 and verse 11 through faith Also Sarah herself received strength &gt;&gt; to conceive seed. She made it to the hall of faith &gt;&gt; through faith. Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised. &gt;&gt; Guess what? She didn't have it back there, &gt;&gt; but she got it. She got it &gt;&gt; and she received strength to make the promise happen. How many would say that's what we need? We need his strength cuz she didn't have it but she received strength to bring forth the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, bless your word today as we humbly submit to it, Lord, and submit our gift to you. May you bless every life that's here. You you you have every one of them. no matter what age they are, no matter where they're at, you have every one of them in mind today. And you you are watching over their lives so you know just what to speak to them, Father. And we pray that they'll see it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I want to speak this morning a little bit on grace for Sarah until she sees. Grace for Sarah until she sees. Or maybe grace for all the Sarah. Because there's more Sarah than just the Sarah of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Grace for Sarah until she sees. Um there's a scripture I'll add in in 2 Corinthians 4:18, if they want to pull it up there. 2 Corinthians 4:18 says, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things 2 Corinthians 4:18, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal." Telling believers that we are not to look towards the things that are seen, but the things that are not seen. We're actually to look at things unseen. Now, that's very strange to the world. If you don't understand faith, you're not you're not going to understand this. But the Lord actually as Christians, we are not to look at what we see with these eyes. &gt;&gt; Faith looks at what we can't see. &gt;&gt; And that's faith. And if if anyone knows here, if you didn't know, I'll tell you. The Christian life of serving the Lord is a life of faith. And it's a life of looking to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily blind faith. It's not necessarily that, but you actually see something in faith, but it's not with these eyes. &gt;&gt; You actually see something in faith, but it's not with these eyes. It's faith is the evidence of things not seen. So, it's it's things that you can't see with these eyes, but yet it's an evidence of things not seen. It's something it's a substance. You actually see it, but you don't see it with these eyes. And we are called to live a life that's deeper than the world that tends to only view things with these eyes. They live by their emotions. They live by what their eyes see. Uh if you I what's the saying that uh if you can we we say if you believe it that you can see it. But you see now they I have to see it before I believe it. That's opposite of Christianity. I'm not going to believe it until I see it with these eyes. But you see, God asks us to have faith because then we see it by faith. And these eyes don't declare it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to declare that this is the truth. But yet in the inside, we're saying, "But I see it. I see it by revelation. God has showed me." And this is what Abraham's seen. He's seen that the promise was as good as in the bag. And the Lord's coming to confirm it. Because he see it, seen it. He invited the Lord in his tent, in his home, and begin to serve him because why? He's seen it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our father Abraham. He's the first one who initiated this walk of faith. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's why we call him the father of faith. Abraham began this walk of faith. And we are children of Abraham when we believe by faith. I'm laying some foundational things here. So that means that we look to the unseen. We don't base our life on what the five senses declare. &gt;&gt; We don't base our life on what the 10 senses declare. There's actually 10. There's five outward of see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Then there's inward of memory, imagination, conscious, affections, and reasoning. So we have 10 senses there of our emotions and our outward uh uh senses. And we don't base our life scripturally. And as a Christian, we don't base our life on what our senses declare. &gt;&gt; Often what our senses declare, it would be opposite of what God has already declared. SO UNLESS WE GET PAST what we see with these eyes, we'll never never understand the Lord, understand his kingdom, understand healing, understand why he wants us to serve him, understand why he asks us to wear certain things. We'll never understand it until we see something beyond this world, beyond these eyes, beyond what OUR CONSCIENCE. IT'S BEYOND ALL OF THAT. IT'S SOMETHING that we see spiritual and God has to show us. And God has to show the person sitting next to you, too. And guess what? We've got to have grace until the person sitting next to you can see it. &gt;&gt; But when they see it, it's over. &gt;&gt; Everything opens up. Can you say amen? So, we love them and we have grace for the Sarah's because the scripture should have read that Abraham caught it and Sarah caught it, but Sarah didn't catch it right away. Abraham caught it early on. Sarah didn't catch it early on. &gt;&gt; And Jesus, I REMEMBER HIM SAYING, "OH, FOOLS." To the men on the road to Emmas, oh fools and slow of heart to believe. &gt;&gt; I know none of you are in that category this morning. I wouldn't put you there, but there are people that are very slow to get it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, what the senses show can be a whole different world than what God sees and what and and what God has already seen and what God has already spoken, what he's seen ahead of time. He speaks that through prophets. And so, but then what our senses show can be a completely different world than what God has already seen. and what God has already spoken. I think a good example is Jonah. And he was the one Jonah was the one who called all the things he seen on the outside. He actually is the one who called them lying vanities. Did you know Jonah is the one that and boy, he had some outward things to look at that he would never be delivered. He was in the in the belly of a fish and uh tied up in seaweed and at the bottom of the ocean, the Bible says, and he was all I mean, he was a mess. And he was in a terrible spot. And he was the one, if you if you guys want to pull it up, Jonah 2, he's the one who said, "Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said, I cried by reason of my affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me out of the belly of hell. Cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas, and the floods compass me about, all my billows, and thy waves passed over me." Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight. Yet will I look again toward thy holy temple. The waters compass me about even to the soul. The depth closed me round about. The weeds were wrapped around my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with the bars was about me forever. Yet hast thou brought my life from corruption. Oh Lord my God, when my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord and my prayer came unto thee into thy holy temple. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. He's the guy that called all of these outward things that he seen with these eyes, all the seaweed, all the condition he was in. He said, "This is just lying vanities." NOW, HOW COULD HE CALL ALL OF THAT LYING VANITIES? BECAUSE HE'S looking at something else BY FAITH. MY GOD IS ABLE TO DELIVER ME out of this fish. &gt;&gt; And he called it all lying vanities. In other words, I can't I'm not trusting any of this for my deliverance. &gt;&gt; But I will sacrifice unto thee with a voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that I vow salvation as to the Lord. And the Lord spake unto the fish. Now it's getting weird because God's speaking to the fish. &gt;&gt; I just caught that. You know, this is when we have to live a life of faith. &gt;&gt; Because when God's speaking to a fish, &gt;&gt; the world goes, "What? Hello. You're going to accept that? You're going to believe that? Well, not by these eyes, but in the kingdom of God, God can speak to a fish. God can speak to a donkey. &gt;&gt; And if GOD CAN SPEAK TO A FISH AND GOD CAN SPEAK TO A DONKEY, HE CAN SPEAK TO YOU THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, when following THE LORD, THE FIVE SENSES can't be trusted and relied on. We have to pray to see the way God sees everything. Can I say that again? We have to pray, Lord, let me see the way you see things. &gt;&gt; We can't judge matters matters by the flesh and then act too quickly by the flesh. And we certainly can't view this message that God has sent us in the last days from a human standpoint. If we view it from a human standpoint, we won't see it right. We won't see the message right. if we view it from a human standpoint or through our senses. Most of the trouble within our groups, in our ranks, is not seeing the message right and not seeing God's people from God's viewpoint. I'm going to say that again. Most of our problems in our own ranks is because people are not seeing the message right. &gt;&gt; You're looking at it the wrong way. &gt;&gt; And you're looking at God's people the wrong way. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to see God's people from his standpoint, from his viewpoint. &gt;&gt; And I remember a couple Sundays ago when brother Jeremy Shriner was here and and you know, uh, he helped us understand something there. And this is what it was is that if the ark is a type of the word and just because that you have the ark, the word, and it's with us does not mean that it's being handled right. I love that. I I got so much out of that because they shouting. They were rejoicing. The word's coming back and everybody's dancing. They're having a big emotional time and they should because the word was coming back, right? But it because it wasn't how they did it was not handled right. And so just because we have the word does not mean there's enough reverence and respect uh for what we have. Just because there's shouting and loud worship over the ark, the word has come back to us and it's with us. It doesn't mean that it's acceptable to God yet. &gt;&gt; GLORY. WE'VE GOT THE WORD. GLORY, BROTHER. AND NOBODY ELSE HAS IT EITHER. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE IT. WHAT? &gt;&gt; But because they didn't do things God's way, Israel, an innocent law, life was lost. &gt;&gt; Had the word, had the ark, &gt;&gt; and because they did not handle it properly, an innocent life was lost. When I was fellowshipping with some brothers, I said, "How many innocent lives have walked away from this message &gt;&gt; because of how the message was handled? &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?" &gt;&gt; Israel did it. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE WORD. WE GOT THE ARK. PRAISE THE LORD. LET'S HAVE A BIG EMOTIONAL TIME. BUT AN INNOCENT LIFE of a man who touched that ark was not supposed to touch it. An innocent. And I believe INNOCENT LIVES GET LOST IN THE PROCESS. NOT BECAUSE OF GOD, NOT BECAUSE OF THE WORD, NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MESSAGE, the greatest thing that's ever HIT PLANET EARTH, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY OTHER ELEMENT EXCEPT FOR OUR ATTITUDE AND SPIRIT IS NOT HANDLING THE MESSAGE, and we don't see the message right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to uh uh uh say this. It's interesting to me that people view others outside because I just was mentioning to you that you know when when somebody says, "Yeah, we've got the ark. We've got the word. Nobody else has it. We're we're the in crowd. We are we've got it." And when that develops into a pride that we've got it, and we have an exclusive thing, it just turns into too too much pride. And it's interesting to me that people can view others outside of what what they believe very critical towards those people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, &gt;&gt; there's not a lot of amens this morning, but &gt;&gt; let me just take a drink and freshen up here and we'll see if everything turns around. It's interesting that pe people view others outside of what we believe. Very critical. &gt;&gt; And yet I don't see that in the prophet's attitude. &gt;&gt; In fact, there are many attitudes expressed of pride that I just don't see it in God's prophet. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because they're not looking at the message the way that he was looking at it. &gt;&gt; They're not after all THESE YEARS, THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS CORRECTLY. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS, RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN COME OUT WITH AN EXCLUSIVE ATTITUDE, WITH AN ATTITUDE TO SOMEBODY WHO DISBELIEVES, YOU QUICKLY MARK THEM OFF. OH, THEY MUST BE SERPENT SEED. AND IF SOMEBODY would have did that with Sarah, it would have been a TERRIBLE THING. WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO WRITE SOMEBODY OFF EVEN WHEN THEY COMPLETELY DISBELIEVE. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE AND DO THAT. AND I DON'T FIND THAT ATTITUDE IN THE PROPHET. I DON'T REALLY FIND I DON'T FIND IT IN CHRIST. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? IT'S NOT THE MATTER. SO WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S NOT THE MESSAGE. IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE PROPHET GOD SENT. BUT IT'S A PROBLEM WITH HOW WE SEE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; It's how we see it. That's why it's important we must see it right. And so uh we we we want to be able to look at we're not not seeing the message the way that he sees it. There's a song and I might quote the lyrics at the end here that came to my mind last night and the song says by the Macamis, "Things look different on the mountain from the shepherd's point of view." &gt;&gt; It's just moved me. It's just I'll I'll read it in a minute, but the shepherd will always look at his sheep different than the way that we look at them. &gt;&gt; The shepherd is looking from a different vantage point. Our God is looking was looking at Sarah from a different vantage point. &gt;&gt; And there was a measure of grace for Sarah. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Because she she she not only sassed she not ONLY SHOWED A SARCASM, SHE LAUGHED IN HER HEART, THEN SHE LIED THAT SHE LAUGHED. AND SO ANY OF US would have said that's PROBABLY EVIDENCE THAT SHE'S not going to believe. But aren't YOU GLAD THE GREAT SHEPHERD FROM HIS VIEWPOINT, HE'S LOOKING PAST THE WAY SARAH IS ACTING. HE'S LOOKING PAST THE REBELLION, HE'S LOOKING PAST YOUR UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Things look different from the mountain, from the shepherd's point of view. &gt;&gt; So, just to bring this a another way for a couple minutes, uh I I go to Ephesians 6:12. I think I mentioned this Wednesday night how we have to look to the unseen. Even when we're fighting spiritual devils in life, we have to realize Ephesians 6:12, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. So when we talk about looking to the unseen, we as Christians not only need to look at his promise and catch it by revelation, but we also must realize THAT OUR BATTLE IS NOT WITH FLESH AND BLOOD. &gt;&gt; OUR BATTLE IS NOT THE EMPLOYEE OR the employer. Our battle is not with our brother and sister. Our battle is not really with our wife or our husband. Even though it looks like it sometimes because we do have disagreements. We do have mo I I don't call them battles or but moments of intense fellowship with your husband and wife. There are times when it's just uh tense. But we HAVE TO AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU CAN'T MAKE THE BATTLE flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT'S FIGHTING YOU THAT'S NOT FLESH AND BLOOD. IT'S THE ENEMY IN ANOTHER dimension that's fighting against your oneness, that's fighting against your family, that hates HATES WHEN A SON OF GOD ESTABLISHES his home in the word of God and a daughter of God is doing that and loves THIS MESSAGE AND APPLIES THE TOKEN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BY THE GRACE OF GOD. SATAN HATES IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And all the principalities, spiritual wickedness in high places, which to me is religious spirits as well. It all gathers around. But we think the problem was with your pro person that hurt you. We think the problem was with that pastor who hurt you years ago. &gt;&gt; And you need to grow to realize your battle is not with flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Your battle is, was, and will always be with the demonic forces that's against you. &gt;&gt; So we could say maybe it wasn't your brother as much as you hated him. Maybe it wasn't that sister as much as you still hold bitterness towards them. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe you didn't see what happened to you AS ALL THE TOXIC PEOPLE in your life. Maybe you didn't see it right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was the enemy making those people act in a certain way to test you. Paul's teaching here that if you make the battle with a person, you're not seeing it right. The the the world's battle is with flesh and blood. That's why they'll sue one another. And that's why I'm going after that person and I'm going to do everything to get that person out of their job. And I'm because their battle is flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; That person's the problem. I'm going after them. I'm going to court with them. And there are certain cases that you have to use the law to do things. I understand that. But for the most part, remember it's not the person. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's the enemy. &gt;&gt; We cannot live once again this thought of looking to the unseen. We can't look at what's here today. EVEN AS A PASTOR, I can't look at just what's here. And physically, I have to be saying, "Lord, help me to get the word because I'm dealing not with just people here. I'm dealing with principalities and powers. I'm doing deal dealing with sometimes unbelieving spirits. I'm dealing with people that come from A LOT OF STUFF. I mean, a lot of stuff, abuse and abusive situations in churches and physical abuse. I'm dealing with a lot of things. And you know what that does? It makes a person's heart locked up that they don't trust and they hold back. They love the Lord. They want to come to church, but they can have their heart locked up for many years. And so, do I look down on that person? No. I look at what the devil has done TO HAVE A STRONGHOLD in their life. I need the power of this WORD TO BREAK THROUGH THAT thing so the person can be free. So when I preach, it has nothing to do with personality and who's here and how well dressed you are. I appreciate you dressing well and I try to wear a suit to look nice, but this has nothing to do with flesh and blood. We're fighting an enemy in this land. &gt;&gt; And we need something better than just our personalities and our clothes to fight demons. We need a faith in God's word. Young person, you're going to need MORE IN THIS LIFE than just a strong personality to make it through. There are demons against your life. And you need the FAITH IN GOD'S WORD TO stand against the ws of the enemy, to be a daughter of God, to be a son of God, and stand with your armor on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now people that look at it with just people who have hurt me. I don't trust people. They become bitter. they become hateful. But that's not the full picture. It's only the surface of what we see. We can make a battle with people and we can also conclude about people. We bring conclusions about people. You know what else we do based on our past hurts? We conclude about the new people in our life and we associate them and profile them with the last person that hurt me. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're way too similar to the last guy. So, you don't get a chance. They don't ever get a chance. And you don't get a chance. I know you're the new pastor in my life, but listen, uh, you're starting to sound like that other pastor. I would say, "Give me a break. You know, I'm the new kid on the block here. Give me a chance." But people because of their hurt and pain by association, they'll put you in that same thing. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You see, and you have to be careful. You don't profile, you don't put somebody in the and make conclusions about somebody that you don't really have a right to make. And it's not fair because you'll have a lack of grace of God for them. &gt;&gt; But when we grow, WE LOOK PAST WHAT is being said and done outwardly. How many want to grow past what you see outwardly, what's being said outwardly, what's being done outwardly. You want to have that calm spirit that if this person's spitting in your face like they did Jesus, you got that calm spirit to say, "Now I know, isn't this a person that's crying for help here? They're spitting and my flesh says I'm going to spit back or I'm going to do something even worse than spitting. But somewhere WE GOT TO LOOK PAST WHAT WE SEE THEY'RE DOING &gt;&gt; and see past what's causing it. &gt;&gt; And know there's a demonic realm that hates us using anything to discourage us. You know with people they can't stand people. They can't stand being around people. I just wanted to say as a pastor, sometimes we have people that come through the years. I've had people come and say, "I just want to come to church and I want I I like the message and I like uh your sometimes they say they like your preaching sometimes and I just want to come and I I I just but I don't like people. I don't want to be around people." And so depending on how I feel hurt, how hurt they are, I understand where they're coming from. But God's going to have to open their eyes because you you can't you can't disassociate completely, especially with the people of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And say, you know, I I I just want a portion of this because what you're doing is you're playing it safe. I've been hurt too much. And what you're doing is lumping the rest of us in with the past people in your life or your past church. I don't think it's fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say a little rebuke from the pastor here. Put your seatelt on. You can't take one Sunday in the year to stay over and have fellowship and get to know the people you go to church with. &gt;&gt; Not one Sunday a year. &gt;&gt; You can't have fellowship. You can't you live your life in your own island because you think it's safe. Well, it's not really safe because there's one place that our Lord is &gt;&gt; and he's not just in this building. The revelation said is he is in his body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So how can you say YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE to him and not be close to his body? &gt;&gt; All right, that's it. The rebuke's over. On to other things. You think about that and you pray about that because there's something wrong with your revelation. Say, "I don't need anybody. I just need the preaching, but I don't need anybody else." I would really examine that and pray about it. Praise the Lord. So you let me move along here because we got a lot of hay on our fork. So Satan brings tensions and he does all this stuff and contentious with your spouse or your family, your kids and brothers and sisters and pastors and employees, even close family members and there's tension sometimes. But we must remember our battle is not with flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; There's a bigger picture that we have to see to the unseen. And if we conclude it's them and we are only battling them, then we are not growing to look to the unseen. As I said Wednesday night, forces in the other dimension, they're not I don't believe they're out there just just yelling at us to say, "I'm going to GET YOU. YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER." NO, I DON'T THINK THEY'RE OUT THERE JUST YELLING. I THINK they're right here next to our ears whispering things in our ears constantly. THE DEMONIC REALM IS JUST IN THE OTHER DIMENSION AND IT'S RIGHT HERE FULL OF PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS and spiritual wickedness in high places. That's why even in a service like that, your soul may say, "He's telling me the truth." But you have so much past and so much of those demons speaking that it's going to it's going to make you lack have a lack of trust to give your full heart to God &gt;&gt; because you haven't learned that that those voices there, they got to be dealt with &gt;&gt; by faith. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have it right next to us in high places and powerful prayer and faith in God. How many believe we have power to cast out devils &gt;&gt; with love and in the name of the Lord? We have power to cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you take a person, they don't see it. That's why we have to have grace. They don't see it yet. &gt;&gt; They don't believe yet because they don't see it yet. You take a person who feeds on trash privately or openly on the internet, just trash and vile things. Maybe they still even come to church. What's wrong? They need to really meet God. Why? Because they don't see the spirits behind all that. Right? &gt;&gt; They see it as a naked woman or they see it as a a jokes, bad, dirty jokes, and they see it that makes you laugh, but they have no vision of the demonic spirit that's there. They tell me there's a place Brother Bram says, "If God could only show that man what that spirit looks like be behind that immodestly dressed woman. If God can only show you the spirit that's just right there behind her." And you'll see this in in uh you'll see this in commercials now where they have like a person under depression. And brother Bram described that when he's seated in the other dimension, it was like a cloud hanging over them of depression. Kept them down. And and let me just say something about this winter. Some of us older people, when winter sets in, depression can set in. &gt;&gt; So I want to encourage all of us today. God is still God. &gt;&gt; His presence is still available in the winter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He still loves you. You still have a place in his kingdom. We need to refresh ourselves. Can you say amen? Cuz winter can get depressing. &gt;&gt; What was I? Where was I going with? Oh, the cloud. And so you're seeing this person that's depressed in this commercial walking around trying to enjoy their children in the backyard and everywhere they go is this cloud that's following them of depression. They're selling depression medicine and and and and that's fine if it helps. But you see now, isn't it amazing that back in the 1950s when Brother Brand seen in the other mention, he said, "I see you got that oppression over you. It's like a cloud following you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, they're able to tap into of all the symbolism they put a cloud &gt;&gt; catching on to what's happening in the other dimension. But the prophet said, "If if man, if God could ever open your eyes and you see the demonic spirit behind that woman that's dressed and modest, you'd never look at her again." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe we're under the worst demonic pressure ever. And it's not out there somewhere. I believe it's close to us. Can you say amen? And we can be blinded by sometimes what a person has in their unbelief and what they're going through and where their heart is. We have to be careful how quickly we judge cuz you don't know really know where that person's heart is. &gt;&gt; Can you say we can quickly put someone under? So, uh, let me just settle down here, give an example. So, I have in the big at at the front of my driveway, I have a couple real big lions for decoration for landscape. Stevie, you stay right there. I got your number, buddy. So, a few weeks ago, mysteriously, and they're pointed straight, you know, that's where they're supposed to point. I come I woke up in the morning. I drove out my driveway and the lions were turned backwards coming back the other way. So I said, "Who did that? Who in the world would have the audacity to change my lions and make them all backwards?" It's such a desecration of the the holy place of trying to make it with a symbolism of the line of tribe of Judah. somebody with such an irreverent I you know &gt;&gt; but I I found out who it who it was because they confessed and I won't tell who it is but the initials are Stevie Lefontaine and and he's laughing about it still to today he's still laughing about it but you see now I want to use this example because what happened from that was you know I got on him about it. It was a good laugh, all that. And so I had my son-in-law move them back into the right place cuz I can't move them. They're too heavy. So he moved them back and I was all happy and everything and that was over. And so you know then just about a week later then they were turned again this way. So you know who my first phone call was and he uh denied it up and down. I don't know who that was. Uncle Paul, but that was not me. I said, "Yeah, right. Okay, sure." You know, and so now under my subject today, if if I was to really go with this, I would not only label Stevie a landscape vandalizer and put that title on him. I'm still thinking about keeping it on him for a while. A landscape vandalizer. But then, and that's it. You, you know, that's the category I put you in. You can try all you want to, but it's going to be a while. That's what I put you in that category because of what you did. So now he's made a mistake and he had thankfully he did confess that. But you see now when it happened again, my tendency as a human being to say, well there's nobody else in this world that would be that bad of a landscape vandalizer in my church or any nobody else is that irreverent. It has to be Stevie again. And he has denied. So I have a choice to make. I either believe what he's saying. And it's hard to believe because he's already made the mistake. &gt;&gt; Do you see how human flesh can get in? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to believe you, Stevie, because listen, you did it before. You're a landscape vandalizer. And once a LANDSCAPE VANDALIZER, ALWAYS A landscape vandalizer. And you just That's it. You're doomed for life. That's what you do for a living, Stevie. But then I begin to realize that he's being real and he's saying, "But Uncle Paul, I just I didn't I don't know who did." He still thinks it's funny, but he didn't do it and somebody else did it. He's he's begun a pro. He's begun a whole campaign here. You see, you see what we do? &gt;&gt; And I still don't know who it is, but I moved him back. Somebody moved him again. So, somebody is doing this. So, I'm going to have an altar call right now if anybody wants to come up and we must be careful how we judge someone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if they have made a mistake, &gt;&gt; we must be careful that we don't label them for life. &gt;&gt; That once they've done this, they're always going to be this. &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's patterns in people's lives, some pretty vile people. And thankfully we have the laws of the land that keep people in check because we've had a lot of government systems and judges that have let a lot of people off and they've went out and killed again and things like that. So I understand and a lot of that is because that God hasn't dealt with that person's heart. There has no place for a deliverance for them. &gt;&gt; But and I think the law should should should still make them accountable. Thankfully we have a president right now and different ones is trying to crack down a little bit so it's not as lawless. But remember the Bible says they will become lawless. That's the word &gt;&gt; and that's what they were used in the media is that it's become a lawless nature and it's become a lawless world and it's a lawless uh the spirit of lawlessness is in our land. And so we try to correct it and say, "Hey, come back to the law." But we realize that. But we realize when we're in the kingdom of God, WHEN WE'VE GOT GOD'S POWER available to people to follow, we must be careful because that person, we can't be judging them and doing them because they may be a Sarah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; They may be a Sarah. In fact, I'm convinced my my nephew Stevie, he's a Sarah or an Abraham. We must not judge somebody because they might be a Sarah and we and they can't see it yet. Maybe they're under a spirit for a while. There's still a lot of spirits that's driving people to do things. Maybe it's not them so much as the spirit driving them to do it. And so we must look beyond the person &gt;&gt; and beyond what they look like, &gt;&gt; beyond their mistakes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is anybody on board with this this morning? I'm actually trying to train us and and teach us a bit of how we handle this message correctly and how we open the door and have a settleness to welcome people who don't look like us, who don't act like us initially, &gt;&gt; and they come in, they're rebellious. They don't believe. We must have the spirit of Christ, not to compromise the truth, but the spirit of Christ to say, "Listen, I'm looking past all that because you may be a daughter of God. You may be a son of God." Can you say, "Amen." If we could have message churches THAT HOLD ON TO THAT GRACE, I believe they would grow because it's an ATMOSPHERE TO LET THAT PERSON SEE THE LORD. LET THAT PERSON GET IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE FISH, BUT WE DON'T DO THE CLEANING. WE FISH, &gt;&gt; BROTHER MICHAEL. WE CAN CATCH THE FISH. WE CATCH THE FISH, BUT GOD DOES the cleaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I like that part of it. I don't even like to clean fish with Michael or anybody else. I say, "Praise the Lord. We'll catch them and God will clean them." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want you to notice something here in the message that opens the seven seals. God in simplicity. That's the title of the message coming into the seven seals. And brother Brham says, "Today we have tried we have tried organization. We've tried denomination. We've tried education. We've tried scientific achievements and everything to try to bring man to a unity for fellowship. And it's failed. Every one of them. THERE'S ONE PLACE that man can meet AND FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD AND FELLOWSHIP WITH EACH OTHER. THAT'S under the cross. WHEN EACH MAN ACCEPTS the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hello. This is the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And guess what? I don't think that changed after the seals. &gt;&gt; There's one place. There's one place that's under the cross. When each man accepts the blood of Jesus Christ, listen. He says, "I don't care in all of his peculiarity. He can still reach over and put his hand in the next man's hand and call him brother &gt;&gt; when we meet at the cross where Jesus died. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's the effect of this? We're meeting in the same place. We're depending on the cross to transform our lives. &gt;&gt; Not some symbolism that you got from a former church. No, no. I mean the power of the cross of what he did in your life to change you. &gt;&gt; And if you need it to change you, you can reach your hand across it and call a man a brother. Even in his peculiarity, &gt;&gt; that means some people will be peculiar. &gt;&gt; He might be talking about you. &gt;&gt; But see, if somebody's peculiar from the way we look, we back off. &gt;&gt; We can't shake our hands. We can't have fellowship with that man. Here he says in all of his peculiarity, he can still reach over and put his hand in the next man and call him brother when we meet at the cross where Jesus died. We are becoming a scientific age. And more we the and more we progue into science or probe into science I guess he meant further we get away from God. The more we probe into science the further we get from God. Uh I'd like to go back to that statement. Now everything we are living in a scientific age everything must be proven scientifically. You see when you're in that mode you're looking for the five senses and science to prove something. &gt;&gt; You see and when you're in that mode religiously you're looking for a certain proof &gt;&gt; before you can shake hands and be brother &gt;&gt; because you're in a realm that uh man wants to prove something. and we probe into science the further we get away from God. You never you're never able to scientifically prove God. And the whole Christian armor is absolutely supernatural. There's nothing natural. If you can prove God, then there's no need of there's no more need of faith. But he that cometh to God must believe that he is. It's by faith. The whole Christian armor is in faith. Brother FF Bosworth, one of my first managers, wrote a book called Looking to the Unseen. And many of you has read it. No doubt. It is a very fine book of looking at the unseen. Here's a statement. The Christian looks at things he does not see. &gt;&gt; So this is the simplicity of where the fellowship is, where we find fellowship under the cross. And I don't believe that changed after the seven seal was was preached. It's still under the shed blood of Jesus Christ. The bleeding word. The word brings the benefits of that blood. BUT THAT'S THE PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP. What he is saying is we can complicate this too much. We try to judge things by what is seen and by what is proven, but we are to look at what we don't see and never complicate what God HAS GIVEN US. DON'T COMPLICATE THE seven seals in making it into something that's other than the FELLOWSHIP BY HIS BLOOD. The revelation of the seal should never change that, only enhance it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's interesting. Those that claim the word in the seals can write people off pretty quickly if they don't see it their way. &gt;&gt; Unless they see this, we have no basis for fellowship. &gt;&gt; This is the bride's exclusive revelation. Really? How did you get that out of this fellowship under the blood? How did you conclude that? Why? &gt;&gt; You're not looking at the message, right? &gt;&gt; There's an unseen part that you don't see. You're blinded by pride. If he's a peculiar one, I can reach over and shake his hand and call him brother. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Paul, you're going to open the door to all kinds of stuff. I'm not afraid at all. &gt;&gt; I have men that doesn't have the same understanding that I do and been blessed with. And if they purely are looking at the blood of Jesus Christ, if they're purely believing in what they know, I can shake hands with them &gt;&gt; and call them brother. &gt;&gt; Is anybody listening to what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But what about this and what about that? What? And they, you know, they need to receive this and that's not up to you. &gt;&gt; That's not up to you. &gt;&gt; They need the same thing you needed and that's the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Same thing that brought you in and changed you today the way you are, they need the same thing. Can I get an amen? They need the same simplicity. They need to find it. AND AND PEOPLE FIND IT ALL DIFFERENT WAYS. &gt;&gt; BUT AS LONG as they find it, &gt;&gt; there are ones who we ride off way too quickly. Like we were speaking Wednesday night of Saul, how he changed the Paul. I was mentioning that uh sermon of brother John Andy's and how saw he was breathing out threatenings and against the church and and and and you know he was voted least likely to be a message believer. He was completely get against it and taking people to jail and and and and then come to the brothers in Jerusalem and say who's next to take Judas's place who's going to do it. Well, what about Saul? Saul? Are you kidding me? But you see now what happened is that even when when Saul, it's interesting when he got struck down at the horse and he seen that light and that light spoke and said this is Jesus which there's more manifestations in the Bible of Jesus showing himself in light than there is in his flesh body. &gt;&gt; Jesus is light. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was represented in a pillar of fire in light throughout the Bible and he did it to Paul and he said, "Who are you? I'm Jesus who you're persecuting &gt;&gt; in the pillar of fire." &gt;&gt; And what happened? He was struck with blindness. And it wasn't until a brother, which is a no-name brother, was led of the Lord, "You need to go pray for this guy called Saul." And he questioned the Lord said, "But are you sure this is the one? &gt;&gt; Do you know? Have you read the free press? Have you read the press on this guy? &gt;&gt; He's He's got an agenda. He's lashing out against this message. He's on social media everywhere. He's got an agenda to call this thing a sect, a cult. He's He's a mess. Are you sure this is the one? &gt;&gt; Don't you ever underestimate who God can get a hold of. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they're breathing out threatenings and all kinds of venom and bitterness coming out. Don't write him off &gt;&gt; cuz Paul was pretty bad. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Go talk to him. Go pray for him. God will open his eyes." I want you to catch that. He was blinded. But when a a no-name believer was called and he obeyed the Lord, went in there, prayed for him, his eyes were opened &gt;&gt; because he just needed to see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He just needed to see. &gt;&gt; Breathing out threatenings, breathing out all this hatred and bitterness. And somehow God's asking Ananas to look past all of that. That's what I'm preaching this morning to you. Ananas was asked to look past what he seen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Past what he'd heard. &gt;&gt; He said, "You go pray for him because I have chosen him to take the message to the Gentiles." Are you sure you got the right guy? I've got the right guy. I chose him to do it. &gt;&gt; All he needs is his eyes opened &gt;&gt; and it's over. &gt;&gt; Did he do it? He did it. &gt;&gt; Did Sarah make it in the Hall of Fame? &gt;&gt; She made it. &gt;&gt; Don't write off anybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They might be a deacon in this church next year. &gt;&gt; I'll watch them for about a year, but let them get baptized with the Holy Ghost and filled. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; You're going to PUT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT HIM IN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE? YEAH. BUT THE BLOOD of the lamb has washed it all away. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Faith looks beyond grace is always there to take the person to the purpose of God for them. We must see grace like that and not put restrictions on his grace. Martin Luther said this. Martin Luther said this grace of God if you guys have that quote. This grace of God, I love this, is a very great, strong, mighty, and active thing. &gt;&gt; It does not lie asleep in the soul. &gt;&gt; Grace hears, leads, drives, draws, changes, works all in man, and lets itself be distinctly felt and experienced. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is hidden, &gt;&gt; but its works are evident. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's he saying? We don't limit the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It's a moving thing. His presence is a moving thing. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the quote that for a week or so since a brother gave it to me, I've been wanting to get to and I'm going to start wrapping up and closing after this. This blows me away how brother Bram says this. A wonderful quote to sum up what I'm saying that we must be able to see how God sees. Abraham seen the unseen. How many believe that Abraham seen the unseen? It was settled for him. But not Sarah. How do we treat the Sarah who are slow to live in this unseen realm? &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham says they're in a service. He says, "Now listen, church, I want to drop, if I don't end up shouting or running the aisles after this one, I'll be surprised. Listen, church, I want to drop this in here because I believe the Holy Spirit told me to do it. You may be sitting here. You may be sitting there, which some of you are. I know you disagreeing with me right now. &gt;&gt; NOW, I CAN CALL YOUR name if you want me to. &gt;&gt; Well, who who knows that. &gt;&gt; Not brother Brandham. God knows your name. &gt;&gt; I could call your name. You're sitting there disagreeing with me. I can call your name if you want me to. So, I know that. But I also can see farther than that. Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see that unbelief. I SEE I COULD CALL YOUR NAME. I SEE. BUT I ALSO CAN SEE FARTHER THAN YOUR UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD THIS MORNING THAT GOD CAN SEE FARTHER than our unbelief? &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD HE SINNED FARTHER THAN YOUR REBELLION when you were in the world SITTING AT A BAR? ALL KINDS OF SIN AND DEBAUCHERY. AREN'T YOU GLAD? HE'S SEEN FARTHER THAN ALL OF THAT. SOMEBODY PRAISE THE LORD. HE SEEN FARTHER THAN THAT. HE SEEN FARTHER THAN YOUR HESITANCE AND YOUR REBELLION and your disbelief. HE SAID, "I CAN SEE FARTHER THAN THAT THAT YOU'RE going to believe it one of these days." &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE LOOKING IN THE FUTURE, LOOKING AT A STUBBORN INDIVIDUAL AND SAYING, "BUT I CAN SEE IN A VISION THEY'RE GOING TO BELIEVE IT WITH ALL THEIR HEART. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALLIN. THEY'RE GOING TO SELL OUT LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL. &gt;&gt; You think you know your life? God knows your life better than you do. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU OWN YOURSELF. I'LL DO WHAT I WANT. I DO WHATEVER. NO. NO. God's got your number. &gt;&gt; And he's going to love you to himself &gt;&gt; if you're his daughter and his son. So, I'm just going to put this in so you understand. So, I can give you a little spot of grace here. He's talking to the rebellious, unbelieving people. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to put a little spot of grace here. I wonder if we need to put a little spot of grace in people's lives. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to put a little spot of grace here. When ain't going to be too long, too. You're going to change your mind. Some of you, some of you won't. But remember, when Sarah first heard that man, which she's a type of the church, when she heard that, seen that sign take place to Abraham, she actually laughed about it in her heart, &gt;&gt; and she disbelieved and doubted it ever being so. Is that right? At that time, God would have rubbed her name off. &gt;&gt; That right? But he couldn't. She's part of Abraham. &gt;&gt; They are one. &gt;&gt; And if you really not been excited, not worked up in emotion, not got some church creed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But really receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you're really part of Christ &gt;&gt; and still a little skeptic in your mind. Now, can you imagine what he's saying here, friends? really receive the Holy Ghost and you're really part of Christ and still a little skeptic in your mind, &gt;&gt; God will not shove you off from that because he can't. You're a part of Christ. &gt;&gt; He'll bring you to truth. &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD. How many this morning want to see farther than what you can see with these eyes? &gt;&gt; If there's a sarah there, you want to see farther. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, there's people in the Bible that caught the vision quickly. &gt;&gt; David, and he's ready to go after Goliath, but there's people in the Bible that got it real slow. I don't know if it was their complexes or their personality and they lean too much towards their shyness, but you got other people that they didn't jump right onto it. Gideon was real stubborn. &gt;&gt; Gideon had complexes. &gt;&gt; And the angel saying, you know, you're a mighty man of valor and he's saying, you got the wrong guy. I don't know why people, but people were slow. Thomas, look at doubting Thomas. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the label we've given him. &gt;&gt; Doubting Thomas. If I could, I've got to see and put my hands in it. &gt;&gt; Said Lord said, "All right, Thomas, come on over here. Stick your hand in here." &gt;&gt; If you need that, that's fine. But blessed is he who's not seen &gt;&gt; and yet'll believe. Give their heart to the Lord this morning. I'm ready to trust the Lord. I'm tired of my life. I want to trust him right now. &gt;&gt; He's finding me. I want to find him. I want to put that together. A lot of people in the Bible didn't catch it quickly, but I'll tell you when they caught it, no matter how far down the road it was, when they when their eyes were open and they seen it, &gt;&gt; then they become the heart a part of the Hall of Fame. &gt;&gt; I just have to read you the lyrics to this song. And we don't even know how to sing it here. And if somebody knows how to sing it, they can come and sing it. If I can get through this without breaking down. To look back at our lives, brothers and sisters, and to be able to see it from the shepherd's point of view. &gt;&gt; Our lives look all together different. &gt;&gt; And he they sister uh Sandy Ble from the BLE family wrote this. The Macami sang it. Sandy Blle, Holiness Lady, tremendous lyric, you are standing on the mountain, holding to the shepherd's hand. The valley you just came through was hard to understand. The shepherd draws you closer. There's something he wants you to see, and he points back to the valley and unfolds its mysteries. As the eagles soar around you and you look back where you've been, one by one, he answers questions that he did not answer then. He now shows you the danger of going your own way. All those roads you thought were better would have led your soul astray. That's right. He reminds you of that moment when you could not make it through and now you see one set of footprints where he reached down and carried you. That's right. &gt;&gt; As your tears fall on his shoulder and you thank him for his love, he said, "Child, &gt;&gt; I knew that one day you'd see this valley from above." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; The course says things look different on the mountain from the shepherd's point of view. &gt;&gt; Standing high above the trial that he brought you safely through. All the valley's disappointments &gt;&gt; will never look the same to you &gt;&gt; cuz things look different on the mountain from the shepherd's point of view. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you have a great shepherd? Amen. &gt;&gt; He's watching over your life when you can't even watch it over yourself. He's just guiding. And &gt;&gt; aren't you glad that someday the shepherd's going to give us all the answers? &gt;&gt; I tell this to people that are grieving, are not understanding, and I don't even have answers for them. And the only encouragement I get is someday the shepherd &gt;&gt; will stand there and look back at everything. &gt;&gt; And I always tell them, we're going to get all the answers. &gt;&gt; And guess what? They're going to be good answers &gt;&gt; because God only had something good in mind. &gt;&gt; We don't get all the answers here, &gt;&gt; but we'll get all the answers there. &gt;&gt; And it will be good that he stands there. I just I love the part where you lean over and you just weep on his shoulder. I read that this morning. I said, "God, hasten the day and give me some time because I just want to embrace you and weep on your shoulder. &gt;&gt; I want to embrace my shepherd." &gt;&gt; I want to embrace him &gt;&gt; and and think about this. He'll look back through and he'll show you and give you all the answers why that you didn't know why. &gt;&gt; I can trust a God like that. &gt;&gt; And if he has that kind of grace for us, friends, can we have that grace for others? &gt;&gt; Can we have that vision? Not as a prophet has a vision, but can we be like the prophet in the sense that that he said, "I see you're being stubborn. I see I could call your name, but he says, I'm looking beyond that, and you're going to believe someday. &gt;&gt; You're gonna get past all your bitterness someday. &gt;&gt; You're gonna get past your teenage rebellion someday. &gt;&gt; I've got you. I've got your name. I'm going to call your name someday. And like brother John Andy said, Norah, in that message that you guys are out there enjoyed so much, he says he's he's got a date circled on the calendar for that person's life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because we don't know that date, we get frustrated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if you're a son and daughter of God, no matter if you're a 13-year-old, 16y old, 60 year old, if God is in your mind, there's a date circled on the calendar &gt;&gt; that he's going to give you a life experience, a lifechanging experience, &gt;&gt; and you're going to see this all together different. &gt;&gt; I love the grace of God. God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse &gt;&gt; within. Let's stand. Grace, &gt;&gt; oh God's grace, grace that is greater than all our &gt;&gt; We had the first verse. Marvelous grace of our loveing Lord. Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt beyond on capt there where the blood of the lamb was spilled. Oh grace, grace, &gt;&gt; God's grace, grace that pardon and cleans within grace. God's grace. &gt;&gt; Grace that gater. &gt;&gt; I've been catching myself lately in my attitude as I see someone that looks so different than what I believe. maybe outwardly and they got pierced things all through their body and tattoos and I've been catching myself because the first reactions that oh God have mercy. &gt;&gt; But then if I don't pray for them, I might be their only hope. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I have something greater than all of that, then I ought to represent it and they might not talk to me, but I can pray for that person. Check your motive. Check your attitude. Check if you got too much pride to connect with that person because one word inspired of the grace of God &gt;&gt; could change their life. &gt;&gt; Check our attitudes. How many raise your hand said, "Check my attitude, Lord. Don't let me put somebody in a certain profile. Don't let me do that. Nobody likes that. I'm glad somebody didn't do that with me. &gt;&gt; They handed me a book. They handed me something, a track. They talked to me. They, you know, they Somebody did it for you. Lord, help us to not have a message pride. And this morning, if you haven't fully surrendered to our precious shepherd, our Lord, I just ask you if he's speaking to your heart, then that's a voice you need to respond to and say, I'm ready to talk to him. Heavenly Father, marvelous grace of God, things look different from the mountain from the shepherd's point of view. I long for that day when I'll lean over on your shoulder and cry on your shoulder and weep as you go through and show me all the trials and things that I went through and I didn't understand. And you show me the reasons why. You show me there was a there's a good reason for that. and you were you were watching over me the whole time. I look forward to that day, Lord, when we'll talk it over in the buy and buy. I'll ask the reason and you'll tell me why. Lord, I pray for those hearts this morning, Lord, that that might still have that locking up, that that hesitance. Lord, would you love them so much that they they just fall down before you and say, "He loves me so much. I can't get away from this loving savior. May they come to you, Lord, because they desired you. Change their desires so that they desire you with all their heart. Granted, Father, and us Christians who have been in the way for many years, may we be corrected and admonished this morning. May we lose our judgmental putting people in a certain category. May we lose that, Lord. We don't lose the truth. We don't lose the judgment of the word, but we lose our personal judgment on someone because Lord, if that's a Sarah, she may come later, but Lord, if she's your daughter, she's coming someday. May we trust in that, Father, and trust in your grace. May we give everyone that little spot of grace that brother Brandon was giving at that moment. We ask it in your precious name. Amen. Second verse. God bless you saints. Second verse. Do we have that one? Grace, sin, and despair like the sea waves. Think about this. Threaten the soul with infinite loss. Grace that is greater. Yes, grace untold points to the ref the might he crawl. Oh, grace. Praise God. Grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse with him. Grace, &gt;&gt; so much grace. God's grace, grace that is greater than all my sin. Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. What can aail to wash it over Jesus? Look, there is flowing a cream. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes. Wider than snow you may be today. Why? Oh, grace. Because of grace. Oh, God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse with it. All grace. Praise God. Praise. Praise that greater than all our sleep. Amen. Praise the Lord. Such a wonderful presence of the Lord here this morning. And we have a service the 21st that we'd like you to invite. Anyone you invite. We'll have a few extra songs and celebrate this time not as a some type of worldly thing, but to look to Christ, to look to the word, the light of his word. And so, it's a good service for you to invite some out. I believe on the 21st of this month, we encourage you to do that as we go. Can we sing bigger than all my problems, bigger than all my fears?
