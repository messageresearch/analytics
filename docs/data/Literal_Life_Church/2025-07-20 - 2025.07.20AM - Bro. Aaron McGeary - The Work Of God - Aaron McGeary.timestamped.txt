[33:25] a manifestation. And if we'll yield our
[33:27] hearts, the manifestation of his power
[33:30] will be in the service this morning. I
[33:32] believe he's here already. There isn't
[33:34] anything that's impossible for him.
[33:37] Hallelujah. God bless you. You may be
[33:39] seated. Sister Rachel's going to come
[33:40] and sing. And we appreciate the uh the
[33:44] Jeressa brothers singing this morning.
[33:46] That's all Michael's brothers if you
[33:48] couldn't tell by the way they sang, the
[33:50] way they looked, the whole deal. And uh
[33:52] I was saying they had the brothers came
[33:54] in and their families to surprise
[33:56] brother Michael for his birthday this
[33:57] week. And uh such a wonderful time. We
[34:00] always enjoy having you all. You're
[34:01] always welcome here. You and your wives
[34:03] and families. And uh you know for for
[34:06] many years I had a bad impression of
[34:08] Nigeria because I had a bad thing happen
[34:11] to me with that. But these brothers,
[34:13] their dad Tony, these guys and all the
[34:15] other friends I have in Nigeria has
[34:17] restored my faith in Nigeria.
[34:20] And the Holy Ghost is the thing that
[34:22] changes people's lives. And we
[34:24] appreciate you all being here this all
[34:25] the other visitors that with that's with
[34:27] us. God bless you all. And may you feel
[34:29] welcome. Not in my presence or that
[34:32] doesn't has nothing to do. It's our
[34:34] Lord's presence. And I trust you feel
[34:35] comfortable because he can do mighty
[34:37] things. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[34:38] Sister Rachel.
[34:54] It's not hard to believe.
[34:59] Standing on the mountain tops of glory.
[35:09] When you can hear the songs of angels
[35:13] and the breeze from heaven sends your
[35:16] spirit. Sorry.
[35:24] But in the valley once more
[35:28] will Jesus still be Lord? That's the
[35:33] question.
[35:36] Cuz
[35:41] when
[35:43] isn't easy,
[35:46] that is the testing.
[35:53] I need faith for the times when the sun
[35:59] doesn't shine
[36:01] and the mountain top is just a memory.
[36:08] When there's no sign to be seen
[36:12] and I don't feel a thing
[36:16] to the word of God alone
[36:20] I will cling.
[36:23] Oh, I need faith for the days
[36:27] when trouble comes my way.
[36:31] And I just don't understand
[36:35] what it means.
[36:38] That's when nothing else will do.
[36:42] Faith alone will see me through.
[36:46] And believing
[36:48] becomes my victory.
[36:57] It's not hard to believe
[37:01] when things are going well and skies are
[37:06] sunny.
[37:12] When you feel you're making progress,
[37:16] doing good, living in a time of plenty.
[37:26] But if all of that should change,
[37:31] will you still keep the faith? That's
[37:35] the question.
[37:42] comes believing when believing
[37:46] isn't easy.
[37:49] That is the testing.
[37:53] Oh,
[37:56] I need faith for the times when the sun
[38:02] does not shine
[38:04] and the mountaintop
[38:06] is just a memory.
[38:11] When there's no sign to be seen
[38:15] and I can't feel a thing
[38:19] to the word of God alone
[38:23] I will cling.
[38:26] Oh, I need strength for the day.
[38:30] When trouble comes my way
[38:34] and I just don't understand
[38:38] what it means,
[38:41] that's when nothing else will do.
[38:45] Faith alone will see me through
[38:49] and believing
[38:51] becomes my victory.
[38:57] Oh, I need faith for the days when the
[39:04] sun does not shine
[39:07] and the mountain top is just a memory.
[39:14] when there's no sign to be seen
[39:19] and I don't feel a thing. But to the
[39:23] word of God alone, I've got it clean.
[39:29] Oh, I need strength for the time
[39:34] when trouble comes my way
[39:37] and I just don't understand
[39:41] what it means.
[39:45] That's when nothing else will do.
[39:48] Faith alone will see me through.
[39:52] And believing
[39:54] becomes my victory.
[40:00] And believing
[40:02] becomes my victory.
[40:17] stand together. Hallelujah. What God can
[40:20] do even in the midst of our trials and
[40:22] when we're believing and standing, that
[40:24] can be the victory, too. Praise the
[40:27] Lord. God bless you. That song really
[40:28] ministered to us all the songs. And uh
[40:31] we're very pleased to have brother Aaron
[40:32] McGary with us for two services today.
[40:34] The service tonight is at 5:00. And uh
[40:37] brother Aaron is a pastor five years now
[40:39] in Phoenix, Arizona. If you're ever out
[40:41] there on vacation, I just encourage you
[40:43] to visit the church. Him and Sister
[40:44] Elizabeth. The four children are with us
[40:46] this morning. They're not children
[40:48] anymore, teenagers. And u it's just
[40:51] great to have them in the service and
[40:53] they've been good friends through the
[40:54] years. But yesterday I had asked brother
[40:57] Aaron to speak to us brothers uh on some
[41:00] particular channels for godly manhood.
[41:03] And uh my it was just tremendous. A lot
[41:05] to chew on, a lot to think about because
[41:08] I believe um these things are important
[41:10] because it's not just uh uh that God has
[41:13] sent us a message to res How many
[41:15] believe he sent us a message to restore.
[41:18] I will restore all the years. Everything
[41:21] that has been taken from Satan, I will
[41:24] restore it. But that's not just
[41:25] restoring doctrine that was wrong. It's
[41:27] not just restoring the serpent seed or
[41:29] the truth of the Godhead. God's in the
[41:32] business of restoring everything that's
[41:34] been lost. Not only physical healing,
[41:36] but everything. And what you lost in
[41:38] your childhood, what you lost maybe in
[41:41] your family, domestic situation,
[41:43] whatever is lost, he's here to fill it
[41:45] this morning. He's here to restore. Can
[41:47] you say amen? And when the nation and
[41:50] the world and Satan behind it has
[41:52] destroyed true godly manhood, I believe
[41:55] God has sent us a word to restore what
[41:57] true godly manhood is. And the the
[41:59] lessons yesterday was just tremendous.
[42:01] We appreciate our brother delivering his
[42:03] heart and pouring out his heart this
[42:05] weekend. And we want him to come this
[42:07] morning. We we want him to deliver his
[42:09] heart. And I believe the atmosphere is
[42:12] just right this morning that uh I
[42:14] believe something real powerful can
[42:17] happen here this morning for your life.
[42:19] You just hold those things before the
[42:21] Lord. I believe something can be spoken.
[42:24] Be listening real close. The Bible says,
[42:26] "He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[42:29] the spirit is saying to the churches."
[42:31] How many say, "I want to have an ear."
[42:33] Not just these ears, a spiritual ear.
[42:36] What is he saying to me? And don't dish
[42:37] it off on somebody else. You used to
[42:39] say, "Don't bring your pitchfork to
[42:42] church. Bring your rake."
[42:45] Pitchfork is in. Dish it off on somebody
[42:48] else. No, just rake it in for yourself
[42:50] and look for what God is saying in those
[42:52] little nuggets for your life. looking in
[42:54] the mirror of God's word and he'll
[42:56] transform us by the renewing of our
[42:58] minds and our hearts. He's here to do it
[43:01] this morning. So, you give attention to
[43:02] him. And there isn't anything I don't
[43:05] know how you feel about it, but for for
[43:07] my life, and I know many sitting here,
[43:09] there isn't any more crucial important
[43:14] hour that we spend. And I'm not giving
[43:17] Brother Aaron his time limits, but I
[43:19] don't know of any other more important
[43:21] hour than this hour.
[43:24] out of all the week, out of everything
[43:25] that you're doing, this would be it.
[43:27] This would be the ultimate uh time that
[43:30] we could that he'd have the opportunity
[43:32] to speak to us in this way. Amen. Let's
[43:34] give our lives holy to him. God bless
[43:36] you, brother Aaron. Come if you would.
[43:38] Amen. God bless you each one. As I said,
[43:40] all the visitors, the Lord speak to you
[43:42] this morning, wherever you're at in your
[43:44] life. Praise the Lord.
[43:47] I'm
[43:48] going to make it.
[43:54] He already said that I would.
[44:01] And now
[44:04] keep on trusting
[44:09] that he's working everything for my
[44:14] good.
[44:16] Sing it now.
[44:19] He walks beside
[44:23] me
[44:25] and heaven is in my
[44:30] you.
[44:32] Oh.
[44:39] Sing it one more time. Just hold that
[44:41] confession up to him this morning. I'm
[44:43] going to make it. His word said I would
[44:45] do it. Hallelujah. Sing it now. Will
[44:50] I
[44:52] go? I'm going to make it.
[44:55] Hallelujah.
[45:00] I will.
[45:05] I
[45:07] keep on.
[45:11] Oh, for he's working every thing for my
[45:17] good.
[45:20] Oh, and he
[45:23] walks
[45:25] beside me.
[45:28] And heaven is in
[45:32] my view.
[45:35] Oh,
[45:37] I'm
[45:39] going to
[45:41] make
[45:43] it
[45:45] through.
[45:47] He walks beside me and he
[45:51] walks beside
[45:54] me
[45:56] and heaven is in
[46:00] my view.
[46:03] Oh,
[46:05] I'm
[46:07] going to make
[46:11] it
[46:12] through.
[46:17] Amen. Amen. I believe that. I trust you
[46:20] believe that for yourself. And I believe
[46:22] that's the confidence your your pastor
[46:24] has in you. I believe that the approach
[46:27] that we should all have is that we're
[46:28] going to make it. And if we believe that
[46:31] there's uh three kinds of believers in
[46:33] every assembly, we just believe that the
[46:35] other two are gone today for some
[46:36] reason.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And we're all going to make it. We're
[46:39] all believers. The gospel is to the
[46:42] believer.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And if you preach to the believer, the
[46:46] believer will believe it. The
[46:47] makebeliever will make believe it, and
[46:48] the unbeliever will unbelieve it. But if
[46:51] you preach to the unbeliever, you'll
[46:52] make the makebeliever
[46:54] make believe it and the believer
[46:56] question it and wonder because you're
[46:58] not preaching to the right audience. So
[47:00] today we know we're going to make it.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could take your Bibles and
[47:04] turn to Psalms 103:7,
[47:14] my watch was uh not only in the wrong
[47:17] time zone, or if I could say the correct
[47:19] time zone, 3 hours earlier back in
[47:21] Arizona, but somehow it was uh uh 20 30
[47:25] minutes, 30 minutes slower than it
[47:27] should have been. And I thought the song
[47:29] service had gone an hour and 15 minutes.
[47:31] And I was like, I can't be outdone by a
[47:33] song service. And then I noticed it was
[47:36] only like 45 minutes. So don't have as
[47:39] much of time as I thought I would. And
[47:40] then brother Paul just subtly dropped in
[47:42] there the hour time limit. So we got I'm
[47:45] under a lot of pressure today. Let's
[47:47] just put it that way. But we do bring
[47:49] greetings to you from the church in
[47:51] Phoenix, Arizona, Arizona Believer's
[47:53] Church. Uh we've been there for 5 years
[47:54] now and we're just really uh blessed to
[47:57] be in the will of the Lord and we see
[47:58] the hand of God in it and there's
[48:00] certain metrics that you have as a
[48:02] believer certain measuring sticks and
[48:04] it's certainly not like the world does
[48:06] and what I see is God really doing
[48:08] something tremendous and just encouraged
[48:09] by the growth the right kind of growth
[48:11] it's not necessarily numbers but just
[48:13] how God deals with people's hearts and
[48:15] we had the privilege of having brother
[48:17] Paul and his family and all the
[48:18] grandbabies and grandbabies to be were
[48:20] all there and it was really a a special
[48:23] time earlier this year and a tremendous
[48:24] benefit to our church and I do believe
[48:27] that our church has the distinction of
[48:29] being the only one that has an
[48:31] autographed coahone that was broken by
[48:33] Solomon Lontaine and we have that
[48:36] permanently in our church museum and uh
[48:39] but we we're happy to be here. It's been
[48:41] quite some time since we've been here.
[48:43] Um I could say the church has changed
[48:45] quite a bit since the last time I
[48:46] ministered here at a new address and
[48:48] just seeing the way that God's blessed
[48:49] this assembly. Uh we're encouraged by
[48:51] that. But Paul's been a dear friend. His
[48:53] wife uh has been a dear friend to us.
[48:55] The families just feel like one when
[48:57] we're together. And so there's been a
[48:59] lot of fellowship through the years and
[49:01] a lot of sharing hearts and burdens. And
[49:02] just to see what God has done through
[49:04] their perseverance um and bringing you
[49:06] all together here for them to be able to
[49:08] serve you. It's just a real
[49:09] encouragement. Uh and so I trust you're
[49:11] encouraged. We're encouraged as a family
[49:13] and I appreciate the opportunity to be
[49:15] here today. Psalms 103:7
[49:19] and it says, "He made known his ways
[49:21] unto Moses, his acts unto the children
[49:25] of Israel." It's a very important
[49:27] distinction between these two things. He
[49:29] made known his ways unto Moses, his acts
[49:33] unto the children of Israel. If we could
[49:36] bow our heads together. Heavenly Father,
[49:38] we consider it a great privilege to be
[49:40] gathered together in your name. And the
[49:42] Bible says, "Where two or three are
[49:43] gathered together, there you'll be in
[49:45] our midst.
[49:46] and having gathered in your name and
[49:48] certainly beyond that two or three. We
[49:50] consider this just to be an exponential
[49:53] blessing to have believers who are here
[49:56] uh under not only desires to be obedient
[50:01] but Lord just this hunger in their
[50:02] hearts to feed on the word of God and it
[50:04] has created a tremendous atmosphere and
[50:06] I believe you've watched out over the
[50:07] songs and just even the makeup of the
[50:09] congregation today just that right mix
[50:12] of people present so that this word
[50:15] could go forth in effective ways. We
[50:17] yield ourselves to you. Pray that you
[50:19] take control of this part of the service
[50:20] for your glory and for the bride's
[50:22] benefit, for the individual's benefit.
[50:24] Lord, this gospel is for has ways that
[50:26] it can bless and impact everyone. So, I
[50:29] pray that you could do that today. And I
[50:31] ask this in the name of Lord Jesus
[50:32] Christ. Amen. You can be seated.
[50:36] The title that I've given my sermon this
[50:38] morning is the work of God. The work of
[50:42] God. And it kind of puts it in a
[50:45] singular uh way. And you'll kind of
[50:47] expound upon that here in a moment to
[50:49] understand just exactly what we mean by
[50:50] the work of God. And in uh preparing for
[50:54] this service over the last couple months
[50:56] and feeling very directed and uh very
[50:59] focused, I found myself just revisiting
[51:01] the subject matter of the last 24 hours
[51:03] and and asking myself, okay, where was I
[51:06] the last two months and what was the the
[51:08] path here? And so I going to maybe take
[51:10] a step back with you as well today to
[51:13] look at some things, but I will just put
[51:15] it this way so you stay with me. It's
[51:17] been a long time since I've ministered
[51:18] to this church. So you may have
[51:20] forgotten just how uh as brother Paul
[51:23] said, I have a push pause ministry, I
[51:25] think is how he said it, where you have
[51:27] to you have to push pause and really
[51:28] think about what I said. Maybe search it
[51:30] up on the database to make sure brother
[51:32] Bam said it and whether or not that
[51:33] scripture is there. We weren't quite
[51:35] sure what he meant by that except that
[51:36] when you push play, you can listen. Let
[51:38] the Holy Spirit lead, but when you
[51:40] listen to me, you have to push pause.
[51:41] Well, without the benefit of being able
[51:43] to push pause this morning, just stay
[51:45] with me. Follow me on a scriptural
[51:47] journey, God hopefully will just fill in
[51:49] some things uh to make this uh
[51:52] spiritually relevant and a blessing
[51:55] going forward. Here in our our text here
[51:57] in Psalms 103:7,
[52:00] it says, "He made known his ways unto
[52:02] Moses, his acts unto the children of
[52:05] Israel." The acts of God kind of speak
[52:09] of his deed or his doing in the sense of
[52:11] the effect of something. So he's acted u
[52:14] and he does something and even comes
[52:16] from meaning to act severely with or to
[52:18] dear deal severely with. So it even kind
[52:21] of carries this idea that God deal dealt
[52:23] with them in an overt way that was very
[52:25] s uh severe. And his works speaks about
[52:29] it could even be uh you know plagues on
[52:33] enemies this redemption for them. They
[52:35] saw these acts or these works of uh they
[52:38] were plagues fell upon Egypt. He
[52:40] delivered them out of bondage. He led
[52:42] them through the Red Sea. These are
[52:43] things that were visible where they saw
[52:45] these acts or these works of God. He fed
[52:47] them mana in the wilderness. He brought
[52:49] them into the land of Canaan. So the
[52:51] children of Israel could speak and see
[52:53] historically of overt things where they
[52:55] said the mana fell. We saw it. The the
[52:58] Red Sea parted. We saw it. We crossed
[53:00] across. We we're in Canaan land. God
[53:03] brought us here. But in learning or
[53:06] seeing his acts and as God dealt with
[53:08] them even severely or his deeds or his
[53:10] doings that were visible, they never
[53:12] learned or grasped God's ways. And that
[53:15] was one thing I could say this, they
[53:17] never learned. And maybe that offends
[53:19] the one who did there. And I was going
[53:20] to come over on the other side of the
[53:22] curtain of time and say, you know what,
[53:23] I did. Uh so I don't want to offend
[53:25] anybody but he they didn't as a nation
[53:27] they didn't grasp God's ways even though
[53:30] he's manifested himself amongst them
[53:33] because he says he made way made known
[53:35] his ways unto Moses
[53:38] not just his acts as he did to the
[53:40] children of Israel but his ways that's
[53:42] that road it's a path it's a direction
[53:44] it would be his journey and a a word
[53:47] that it points to that is very good to
[53:50] understand what is in my heart today is
[53:52] he made known his manner
[53:54] He made known his habit, his course of
[53:56] life. He was making known to Moses his
[53:58] character. If I could give a quick
[54:00] example, the children of Israel could
[54:02] see a tabernacle being erected and that
[54:05] would be something that was according to
[54:07] God's commandment, but Moses saw the
[54:10] pattern in heaven. Moses, something else
[54:12] was opened up to Moses to see it. And as
[54:15] God performed acts before them and he
[54:18] demonstrated these great works and these
[54:19] miracles, Israel was not taking
[54:21] advantage of the opportunity to know God
[54:24] in a deeper way that he's sending mana.
[54:27] Well, they just wanted to eat. He leads
[54:28] them through the Red Sea. They just
[54:30] wanted to get away from their
[54:30] oppressors. And so they were not
[54:33] learning his mannerisms, his works or
[54:36] his characteristics because his works
[54:38] and his mannerisms are his
[54:40] characteristics. But they weren't ever
[54:43] they those are indicative of his
[54:44] character and they were just kind of
[54:46] taking it at face value instead of
[54:48] wanting to know what these distinctive
[54:51] traits about God say about the heart of
[54:53] God
[54:54] &gt;&gt; because actions and words and uh images
[54:57] are expressions of identity and we could
[55:00] even say that the uh you know uh your
[55:04] acts and character is virtue in action
[55:06] that it's revealing something about the
[55:08] person. So these attributes or
[55:11] characteristics are being expressed
[55:12] through these things that he was doing
[55:14] doing. And now this this is kind of my
[55:17] thesis statement today. This is where uh
[55:20] if you can catch a hold of this, you
[55:21] might be able to just apply this
[55:23] principle as we go. Seeing someone's
[55:26] characteristics is one thing, but to
[55:28] know one's character is greater. You can
[55:31] see characteristics. Characteristics can
[55:33] be indicative of something. But uh if
[55:35] someone tells the truth and you can
[55:37] recognize that that characteristic in
[55:40] that moment of telling the truth. But
[55:42] unless you know their character, you
[55:44] don't know whether or not they are
[55:45] truthful. It's in that way that we make
[55:47] mistakes. Someone can tell a lie and you
[55:49] can make this judgment that they are a
[55:51] liar. But all men are liars. But in
[55:53] terms of whether or not someone is
[55:54] trustworthy, you'd want to know their
[55:56] character, something that's in their
[55:58] heart.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So I want to use it in this sense. And I
[56:01] feel very comfortable being able to do
[56:02] this in a congregation that has a lot of
[56:04] gifts and talents and especially music.
[56:06] His music itself being the art of
[56:09] combining notes and tones and uh
[56:12] composing different instruments and
[56:13] voices and textures and things into a
[56:16] sound, a pleasing sound. It is an art. I
[56:19] want to use this principle of the
[56:21] artwork versus the work of art.
[56:24] So the work of God is one thing. So if
[56:26] you have the artwork, that's the product
[56:28] of an artist. But then you have the work
[56:31] of art which is the process or skill
[56:33] that you use to create art. The artistic
[56:36] process we could see the product of
[56:39] that. But there's this artistic process
[56:41] involves this ability to express things.
[56:43] So a way of perceiving differences and
[56:45] knowing how to articulate that with
[56:47] certain forms. It's a discernment that
[56:49] gives character to an image if it's
[56:51] visual arts. But the artwork itself is
[56:54] the outcome of that skill or that
[56:56] creativity. It's the expression. It's
[56:58] that innovation that anyone can behold
[57:00] and enjoy. So in this way, God revealed
[57:03] to Moses his work, his mind, his
[57:06] process, his creative skill, his
[57:09] motivation in doing it, what was behind
[57:11] it. But Israel only saw God's work.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; There could have been many that day that
[57:16] walked through the Red Sea. They don't
[57:17] fully understand why they're walking
[57:19] through the Red Sea, why it was
[57:20] according to prophecy, why they needed
[57:22] to be in Canaan.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; They could have said, "Well, why
[57:24] couldn't God just kill all the Egyptians
[57:26] and we stay here? We've besides we've
[57:28] lived here forever and we've got houses
[57:30] and we know how to work the land and
[57:31] we've got all these opportunities. Why
[57:33] not do it? But that's because they
[57:34] don't. They know the power of God to do
[57:36] something, but they don't know his heart
[57:37] and his vision.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Now, as Christians, we have much
[57:43] attention is rightly given to the works
[57:46] of Christ in the gospel. The gospel
[57:48] relays to us many different miracles
[57:49] from different vantage points. And we
[57:51] know as believers there's a lot uh that
[57:54] draws our attention to the acts of the
[57:56] apostles in the book of acts. We know it
[57:58] to be the acts of the holy spirit. And
[58:01] we should never minimize those acts
[58:03] whether they be in the gospels or in the
[58:04] book of acts. We should never trivialize
[58:07] these deeds of the holy spirit. There
[58:09] should never be this attempt to
[58:10] undermine their supernatural origin. Uh
[58:14] there is this I think a temptation these
[58:16] days to be able to maybe even coming
[58:18] from a sincere place explain everything
[58:20] by science but yet still say it's God
[58:22] that did that or God that allowed it.
[58:25] And so we should be very careful not to
[58:27] ever undermine the sup a supernatural
[58:29] origin.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; But in everything God did through Christ
[58:32] and everything that he was doing through
[58:34] the Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost of the
[58:36] apostles there was something to learn
[58:38] about God's nature. there was something
[58:41] that was being expressed and conveyed
[58:42] about the character of God where you can
[58:45] understand the purpose and intent.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; I think there's times when we hear a
[58:50] song and we listen to it and we enjoy
[58:51] the song and it's beautifully written
[58:53] and it's very captivating but there's a
[58:55] part of us that says where did that come
[58:56] from?
[58:58] &gt;&gt; What what were they going through to
[58:59] write that? What sometimes we say it's a
[59:01] beautiful song. I love the words but
[59:02] what does it mean?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; What does it symbolize? What does it
[59:05] represent? And then when you learn the
[59:07] artist and you know more about their
[59:09] background and what they're going
[59:10] through and you understand better what
[59:11] they're painting, sometimes you're like,
[59:12] "Wow, okay. It was beautiful to start
[59:15] with, but now it means more to me."
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm connecting with what was in the
[59:20] the vision of the artist at the time he
[59:22] was creating it.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And so when we have a work of art versus
[59:26] the work of art, that product versus the
[59:29] process, anyone can sit and admire a
[59:32] painting. They can sit and enjoy music
[59:33] as it's being played. They could read a
[59:35] book. I'll put it this way. Anyone can
[59:37] eat.
[59:40] But contrary to Gustau, not everyone can
[59:43] cook.
[59:49] But the mind of the artist, the
[59:51] understanding his motive, perceiving
[59:54] intent, how the the the inspiration of
[59:56] it, that's different. Psalms 25:4 says,
[1:00:00] "Show me thy ways, O Lord. Teach me thy
[1:00:02] paths." It's not just do mighty works,
[1:00:05] not just manifest miracles and and show
[1:00:07] yourself present amongst us. But I want
[1:00:09] to know your ways, teach me your paths,
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; the way of God, his form, his symmetry,
[1:00:14] how God works, what motivates him, his
[1:00:16] heart and his mind, his motive, his
[1:00:18] objective. We ascribe those things to
[1:00:21] ourselves. What's your motive? What's
[1:00:22] your objective? What are you trying to
[1:00:23] accomplish? What's your vision? But God
[1:00:25] has all those. He's visionary. He was
[1:00:28] the first artist. In the beginning, God
[1:00:30] created. And what was he doing? He was
[1:00:32] expressing something in his heart. He
[1:00:34] was giving manifestation to a burden in
[1:00:36] his heart. And if we just look at
[1:00:38] creation as being, well, God just threw
[1:00:39] it all out there on a canvas and he let
[1:00:41] things kind of take shape and he just
[1:00:43] did it and all of a sudden man fell so
[1:00:44] he's got to respond to it. No, God was
[1:00:46] visionary and he planned it all out.
[1:00:48] Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Now with that in mind and that's kind of
[1:00:52] a very general proposition the work of
[1:00:54] God and which is his mind his thought
[1:00:58] and then that work product what we see
[1:01:00] outwardly is the expression we want to
[1:01:03] know what's in his heart and in his mind
[1:01:05] we want to know his ways
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; not just not just his acts if if I would
[1:01:11] say this if the Holy Spirit is going to
[1:01:13] write another book of acts in the bride
[1:01:17] then we can look at the expression and
[1:01:19] just paint a copy.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; We can see what it looks like and what
[1:01:24] it sounds like and just become a cover
[1:01:26] band.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; We can just be a cover band of God's
[1:01:30] original composition.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; You're not the one playing it. You're
[1:01:33] just doing your own arrangement.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; You're just doing a cover song
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and you're just painting a copy. So
[1:01:39] there has to be an understanding of how
[1:01:42] God moves and how he works so we can
[1:01:43] yield ourselves to the spirit of the
[1:01:46] artist of the composer and be in harmony
[1:01:50] with him so that he can produce in us.
[1:01:52] And this is the amazing thing about God.
[1:01:54] If there's an art a piece of art there
[1:01:56] can be a derivative work, there can be a
[1:01:58] print or there can be a copy. God is the
[1:02:01] only one that can keep producing the
[1:02:03] original.
[1:02:04] Yes.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And it's still der it's it's not a cheap
[1:02:07] knockoff. But unless you know his ways,
[1:02:10] you could be accidentally impersonating
[1:02:13] or overemphasizing something and you've
[1:02:16] become a derivative work, not the
[1:02:17] original.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; So I want to use just a specific
[1:02:22] characteristic of God to explore this
[1:02:24] principle. Why I'm using this one, it's
[1:02:28] just the way the Lord directed me.
[1:02:31] And I would argue there's probably many
[1:02:34] different ways. I I I would say that
[1:02:36] there's a numerous principles you can
[1:02:38] use, maybe some better, but this is just
[1:02:40] where God has led me today. In first
[1:02:42] Peter 1:es 14, 15, and 16, admonishing,
[1:02:48] we could say even the believer that
[1:02:49] reads this today as obedient children,
[1:02:51] not fashioning yourselves according to
[1:02:53] the former lust in your ignorance. I
[1:02:56] think that speaks volumes to us already.
[1:02:58] But as he which hath called you is holy.
[1:03:01] So this is something intrinsic about
[1:03:02] God. He called you to be holy, so be ye
[1:03:05] holy in all manner of conversation. So
[1:03:08] as he is holy intrinsically, you ought
[1:03:11] to be holy in your manner of life, in
[1:03:13] your habit, your your moral character
[1:03:15] because it is written. And now this is
[1:03:17] an important thing to catch. Be holy for
[1:03:19] I am holy. So in this manner of life and
[1:03:22] your conduct, we ought to be holy
[1:03:24] because it is written, be ye holy, for I
[1:03:26] am holy. Peter very quickly pulls from
[1:03:29] this principle of God's holiness that we
[1:03:32] ought to be holy. But then he uses the
[1:03:34] context of the law to make his point in
[1:03:38] Leviticus 11:44. He says, "For I am the
[1:03:40] Lord your God. Ye shall therefore
[1:03:43] sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be
[1:03:46] holy, for I am holy. Neither shall you
[1:03:48] defile yourselves with any manner of
[1:03:50] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:03:52] earth." So there's this avoiding things
[1:03:54] unclean, impure, or even abominable. And
[1:03:58] we might think, well, why would he why
[1:04:00] what's his problem with shrimp? Well,
[1:04:02] then you start to learn that, well, what
[1:04:03] shrimp feed on and where they come from?
[1:04:05] And you realize that God had a purpose.
[1:04:06] He had an intent. He had a design behind
[1:04:09] even those things he prescribed for the
[1:04:11] children of Israel. And it was a it was
[1:04:14] a even when it came to dietary concerns,
[1:04:17] it was something that was healthy. A lot
[1:04:19] of people say we need to go back to the
[1:04:20] Garden of Eden of diet, garden of Eden
[1:04:22] diet. Well, give me a body pre previous
[1:04:24] to the fall,
[1:04:26] right? And I think I'll be all right
[1:04:28] with the Garden of Eden diet. Now,
[1:04:29] having uh come on the other side of the
[1:04:31] fall, a kosher diet has a lot of really
[1:04:34] basic principles that are healthy,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; very healthy for the human body and how
[1:04:38] it processes things. And the law that
[1:04:40] God gave Israel was for their own
[1:04:41] protection. It's for their own health.
[1:04:44] even to the point where the dietary laws
[1:04:46] that the Jews observed uh kept them
[1:04:49] exempt from black the black death plague
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; to such numbers that they blamed the
[1:04:54] Jews for the plague.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; But the reason why they weren't dying is
[1:04:57] they didn't eat the same meats that
[1:04:59] everyone else ate. And so it showed that
[1:05:02] God could give a law that could preserve
[1:05:04] life. And if they observing a law that
[1:05:07] was thousands of years, you know,
[1:05:08] hundreds of years old at that point and
[1:05:10] God could preserve them, how much more
[1:05:11] could God give us a message today that
[1:05:14] is alive that when you we observe it,
[1:05:16] it's for our protection.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; So he's using this principle and this
[1:05:21] parallel of God's holiness that's
[1:05:23] outlined in the law to the holiness that
[1:05:26] we ought to have. So let's look at this
[1:05:28] principle that God is holy in Malachi
[1:05:30] 3:es 5 and 6. I will come near to you to
[1:05:34] to you to judgement. Brother Paul, if
[1:05:36] you need me to pause, you can just say,
[1:05:37] "Pause."
[1:05:38] And um and they can do a little AI thing
[1:05:41] here on the overhead and we can ask chat
[1:05:43] GPT where we're at in this and it'll all
[1:05:46] just work out good. says, "I will come
[1:05:48] near to you to judgment and I will be a
[1:05:50] swift witness against the sorcerers and
[1:05:52] against the adulterers and against false
[1:05:54] swears and against those that oppress
[1:05:56] the hireling and wages, ooh, the widow
[1:05:58] and the fatherless and that turn aside
[1:06:00] the stranger from his right." Really
[1:06:03] beautiful principles in here.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I venture to say, and I don't know why I
[1:06:07] keep pushing this button. I did it
[1:06:09] yesterday in the men's meeting, but I
[1:06:10] would imagine if you really really
[1:06:12] caught the heart of God, some of you
[1:06:14] would just say he was a progressive
[1:06:15] socialist.
[1:06:18] But he says, 'Fear not me, sayaith the
[1:06:19] Lord of hosts, for I am the Lord, I
[1:06:22] change not.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; So he says, his promise, they fear me
[1:06:26] not. But he says, I am the Lord, I
[1:06:28] change not. Therefore, you sons of Jacob
[1:06:30] are not consumed. When he says he
[1:06:32] changes not, he's not going to disguise
[1:06:34] himself. God remains the same. Just
[1:06:38] because I have not executed judgment on
[1:06:41] your wickedness does not mean that my
[1:06:42] ways have changed. You might seem that
[1:06:45] through my forbearance, I've altered
[1:06:46] myself. I've disguised myself. And I'm
[1:06:49] no longer going to do uh what I said I
[1:06:51] would do, but I have an unchangeable
[1:06:53] hatred of sin.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And my longsuffering has not changed
[1:06:58] sin. And it has not changed my hatred
[1:07:00] for it.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; We're taught that God never changes in
[1:07:03] his nature. And he's always doing his
[1:07:05] work the same.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same. Jesus Christ
[1:07:09] the same yesterday and today and
[1:07:11] forever. His divine nature, his
[1:07:14] personality did not change by becoming
[1:07:15] flesh in Jesus Christ. Having become
[1:07:18] flesh, it didn't exempt him from some
[1:07:20] intrinsic things. And it didn't mean
[1:07:21] that coming to show grace and to call
[1:07:24] the sinners to repentance and having
[1:07:25] mercy on thousands doesn't mean that
[1:07:27] when he took on the form of man, he
[1:07:29] began became a man in every way, but
[1:07:32] rather he remained the same as he ever
[1:07:34] was in his nature.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; God is immutable in his nature. He's
[1:07:38] just and he's just and immutable in his
[1:07:41] ways.
[1:07:43] God is holy. He's separate and
[1:07:45] unchangeable.
[1:07:47] Says he's glorious in holiness. The
[1:07:49] Bible says, "Make path straight paths
[1:07:52] for your feet. Let that which is lame be
[1:07:54] turned out of the way, but let it rather
[1:07:55] be healed. Follow peace with all men and
[1:07:57] holiness without which no man shall see
[1:08:00] God.
[1:08:02] God is a God of holiness.
[1:08:04] He's God and he changes not." And we're
[1:08:07] asked to be partners in his holiness.
[1:08:10] It's this idea of absolute holiness.
[1:08:12] This sanctification, this moral purity,
[1:08:14] follow holiness.
[1:08:16] We are to put on his holiness through
[1:08:18] that sanctification, through
[1:08:19] separateness. That's our primary
[1:08:21] objective is to be like God. Follow
[1:08:24] peace with all men is part of that
[1:08:26] objective of becoming holy. It's not
[1:08:28] permission to compromise. We say follow
[1:08:30] peace with all men, but it's actually a
[1:08:32] command to stay different.
[1:08:35] We say follow peace with all men and we
[1:08:36] mean we just compromise. We never ruffle
[1:08:38] any feathers and we never to follow
[1:08:40] peace with all men requires us to remain
[1:08:42] different.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 1:10 says, "For do I
[1:08:47] now persuade men or God or do I seek to
[1:08:49] please men? For yet if I pleased men, I
[1:08:51] should not be the servant of Christ."
[1:08:54] So if we're just looking to please men,
[1:08:56] that's not following peace. That's
[1:08:58] pleasing.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 14 19. And let us
[1:09:02] therefore follow after the things which
[1:09:03] make for peace and things wherewith one
[1:09:06] may edify another. Holiness then, as
[1:09:09] it's incumbent upon the believer, as it
[1:09:11] said, we're called to be holy as he is
[1:09:14] holy. It means that our paths are to be
[1:09:16] made straight so that the lame, the weak
[1:09:19] in faith are not stumbled.
[1:09:22] Make straight paths for your feet, lest
[1:09:25] the lame be turned out of the way, but
[1:09:28] rather let it be healed. Follow peace
[1:09:30] with all men in holiness without which
[1:09:31] no man shall see the Lord. In other
[1:09:33] words, it's incumbent upon us not to
[1:09:35] compromise but to remain firm in what we
[1:09:37] know scriptural directives are because
[1:09:39] someone else's healing from sickness is
[1:09:42] can depend upon the fact that you've
[1:09:44] made your path plain.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; You've shown a plain path. This is the
[1:09:48] right way. This is the way that we ought
[1:09:50] to walk and we're keeping in step.
[1:09:51] follow after the things which make for
[1:09:53] peace, so that those that are lame or
[1:09:55] even weak in the faith can be healed and
[1:09:58] not stumbled.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; If you're strong in the faith, but yet
[1:10:02] you're not living a pain, a plain life,
[1:10:05] which sometimes can be painful, but
[1:10:07] you're if you're not walking in a plain
[1:10:08] path, those that are lame will try to
[1:10:10] follow you,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and they're not going to be able to
[1:10:13] selfcorrect.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be able to come
[1:10:16] back on that plain path. As the Bible
[1:10:19] says in Proverbs 4:es 26 and 27, "Ponder
[1:10:22] the path of thy feet and let all thy
[1:10:25] ways be established.
[1:10:27] Turn not to the right hand nor to the
[1:10:29] left. Remove thy foot from evil." The
[1:10:33] path speaks of wheel tracks. Ponder the
[1:10:36] wheel tracks of your life and firmly
[1:10:39] walk in the right direction so that you
[1:10:40] establish a plain way.
[1:10:43] If if you can if you can lay down the
[1:10:45] right kind of tracks, then someone can
[1:10:47] follow in those tracks.
[1:10:49] So ponder the feet of thy paths. Let
[1:10:51] them be established. And don't veer,
[1:10:53] don't wonder, don't stray. Let them be
[1:10:56] firmly established.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; When the Bible says without holiness no
[1:11:05] man shall see the Lord,
[1:11:08] to see God is to enjoy him.
[1:11:12] And I want us to look at this principle
[1:11:13] that we're called to holiness ourselves.
[1:11:16] God is holy and without holiness no man
[1:11:18] shall see the Lord. That means we are
[1:11:20] called also to be holy unless the sacred
[1:11:23] there's this idea in art wherein there
[1:11:26] was a a movement in certain periods
[1:11:29] where art was always uh paintings and in
[1:11:31] visual arts they were painted in such a
[1:11:33] way to was very grandiose and you had
[1:11:35] these visions of heaven and these
[1:11:36] cherabs and all sorts of things that
[1:11:38] tried to capture this grandeur and this
[1:11:40] great beauty of Christ. Christ could not
[1:11:42] be painted unless it was very clearly
[1:11:45] some heavenly being. The Virgin Mary was
[1:11:47] always painted in a certain way and the
[1:11:49] angels had wings. It's very opulent and
[1:11:51] it was to express sacredness to express
[1:11:55] the greatness of God. But then there was
[1:11:57] a movement where the sacred then they
[1:12:00] started and there was this idea of
[1:12:01] things that were profane and it didn't
[1:12:02] mean profanity and cussing and things
[1:12:05] that were perverted, but there's things
[1:12:06] that are just merely human. So you
[1:12:08] always painted Christianity and Christ
[1:12:10] and God in ways that clearly were not
[1:12:13] human to convey this is this is holy.
[1:12:16] And then if someone just did a still
[1:12:18] life or they just painted a a a man or
[1:12:20] or some image of a random person or
[1:12:23] whoever they could get to sit, they
[1:12:24] considered that profane art. But then
[1:12:27] there was a time where artists began to
[1:12:31] express the sacred in the profane. And
[1:12:34] in doing so, they were accurately
[1:12:36] depicting what God is like in flesh. So
[1:12:40] you would have Christ who is calling uh
[1:12:42] Luke or you would see Christ with the
[1:12:44] prodical son and it would be more set in
[1:12:46] a way towards like this is the way that
[1:12:47] it would have looked like. And so unless
[1:12:50] the sacred is being lived in the
[1:12:52] profane, nobody can actually see God
[1:12:56] if we were all just little naked babies
[1:12:58] with wings, right? Flooding around
[1:13:00] everybody. Everybody, well, there's the
[1:13:01] cherubs. That's the bride. We know who
[1:13:02] they are, right? They're the naked
[1:13:04] babies flying everywhere. But that's not
[1:13:06] the way that God chooses to do it. But
[1:13:09] unless the divine is being lived in the
[1:13:12] regular life, in the profane, there's no
[1:13:14] way to actually see God. So, it's not
[1:13:17] without holiness, no man shall see the
[1:13:19] Lord. That I've got to have this cloak
[1:13:20] of holiness to stand before God. But let
[1:13:22] it take it that it's actually our
[1:13:24] responsibility to accurately express
[1:13:27] holiness because if we don't, nobody's
[1:13:28] ever going to see godliness. Right.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah 35:8, "And a
[1:13:33] highway shall there be shall be there,
[1:13:36] and a way, and it shall be called the
[1:13:39] way of holiness. The unclean shall not
[1:13:41] pass over it, but it shall be for those,
[1:13:44] the wayfairing men, though fools, shall
[1:13:46] not heir therein." Those, it really does
[1:13:48] speak to the elect, those that are
[1:13:49] ordained to it. The Holy One will be
[1:13:52] with them is what this scriptur is
[1:13:53] conveying. He will be with them that are
[1:13:55] walking in the way. There shall be a
[1:13:58] way, a road, a journey, the course of
[1:14:00] life, that moral character. He made
[1:14:02] known unto Moses his ways, but only his
[1:14:05] acts or his works to Israel. This is
[1:14:07] that manner, this habit, this direction.
[1:14:09] There shall be a way, a way of holiness.
[1:14:13] Acts 24:14. But this I confess unto
[1:14:15] thee, that after the way which they call
[1:14:17] heresy, so worship I, the God of my
[1:14:20] fathers, believing all things which are
[1:14:21] written in the law and the prophets.
[1:14:23] This way is foolishness to the world.
[1:14:27] That's why the the the great one of the
[1:14:29] great poets of our time said these wrote
[1:14:31] that these these one day these foolish
[1:14:34] roads will be wise.
[1:14:37] The world looks at the way that we go
[1:14:39] and they walk they see the way they're
[1:14:40] walking like oh this is nonsense. This
[1:14:42] is foolishness. But it's a it's the it's
[1:14:44] the right way.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; One day this way which is foolishness to
[1:14:48] the world is undeniably plain to the
[1:14:50] believer. So undeniably to the pl to the
[1:14:53] believer he should not falter. Though it
[1:14:56] be it is a way that shall be for those
[1:14:59] the way fearing men though fools shall
[1:15:01] not heir therein. It ought to be made so
[1:15:04] plain that it's only the fools really
[1:15:06] ultimately that reject it because it's a
[1:15:08] plain way.
[1:15:10] God has called us to not to uncleanness
[1:15:13] he says Paul says to the Thessalonians
[1:15:14] but unto holiness which is
[1:15:16] sanctification consecration purification
[1:15:19] of heart of thought of life of conduct.
[1:15:23] In 1 John 3:2, beloved, now are we the
[1:15:26] sons of God. And it does not yet appear
[1:15:27] what we shall be, but we know that when
[1:15:29] he shall appear, we shall be like him,
[1:15:32] for we shall see him as he is. God,
[1:15:35] Christ. Now, whatever he reveals himself
[1:15:38] as, we become. If he reveals himself to
[1:15:40] you as a healer, you become healed. If
[1:15:42] he reveals himself to you in light, you
[1:15:43] become more lightgiving. When we see him
[1:15:46] as he is, we become like him. And every
[1:15:48] man that hath this hope of being like
[1:15:51] Christ, who hath this hope in him,
[1:15:54] purify himself even as he is pure. To
[1:15:56] purify means to make clean,
[1:15:59] to make pure from carnality, to be
[1:16:01] chased, to be immodest. It even speaks
[1:16:02] of being immaculately clean. That's
[1:16:04] certainly a high standard.
[1:16:07] The Bible tells us in Ephesians 4:24
[1:16:09] that you should put on the new man which
[1:16:11] after God is created in righteousness
[1:16:13] and true holiness. This is what we ought
[1:16:17] to be doing. We're taking off the old
[1:16:18] man. We're putting on the new man which
[1:16:20] is created a new in righteousness. And
[1:16:22] there is a true holiness. The new man is
[1:16:26] like God. Therefore, we put on
[1:16:28] righteousness.
[1:16:30] Holiness comes by the Holy Spirit. This
[1:16:33] true righteousness comes by the Holy
[1:16:35] Spirit, but it's it's interrupted by the
[1:16:38] influences of humanity.
[1:16:41] It's in it's influenced by the world.
[1:16:43] It's interrupted by Satan. and Satan is
[1:16:45] standing nearby to either catch it out
[1:16:47] of the person's heart. The world would
[1:16:49] want to choke it out. We could become
[1:16:50] indifferent and harden our hearts.
[1:16:52] There's all sorts of ways that we could
[1:16:53] resist the working out of this
[1:16:55] righteousness and true holiness.
[1:16:58] Romans 1:4 says about Christ and
[1:17:00] declared to be the son of God with power
[1:17:02] according to the spirit of holiness.
[1:17:05] That's his divine nature. His nature is
[1:17:08] the author of holiness in the believer.
[1:17:11] In other words, we cannot achieve this
[1:17:13] by ourselves. If I could make this point
[1:17:15] again that we could see the model
[1:17:17] believer and we say this is what
[1:17:19] holiness looks like and then we can in
[1:17:21] turn try to produce that type of
[1:17:24] holiness and all we're doing is
[1:17:25] something derivative.
[1:17:27] All we're doing is impersonating or
[1:17:29] overemphasizing. And what happens if you
[1:17:31] want to impersonate something, what you
[1:17:32] try to do is you try you lean into a
[1:17:35] certain sound or a certain tone that
[1:17:37] people catch pick up on like, "Oh,
[1:17:39] that's who that is." Just like whenever
[1:17:42] I would do a Bill Clinton impersonation,
[1:17:44] I did it one time at the winter youth
[1:17:45] retreat. And if you're doing it in the
[1:17:47] moment, everybody's like, "Oh, he's
[1:17:48] going to do it. He's going to do it."
[1:17:51] No, he's not. Or am I? they they you
[1:17:54] just exaggerate one some type of
[1:17:56] inflection or some type of tone and
[1:17:59] people think, "Oh, that sounds just like
[1:18:00] them." But then when you go listen to
[1:18:02] it, you realize, "Oh, it's just that one
[1:18:04] little part that they lean into." That's
[1:18:05] what someone who can impersonate voices
[1:18:07] does. And so if we're not careful, we
[1:18:09] can see something and lean into
[1:18:11] something really hard and overemphasize
[1:18:13] one aspect of what we see in the word.
[1:18:16] And to those who are seeing the
[1:18:17] impersonation, like, "Wow, that is
[1:18:18] spoton. That is really, really good."
[1:18:22] But you've got to have the spirit of
[1:18:23] holiness that is the author of holiness
[1:18:25] in your life.
[1:18:28] Psalms 96:9, "Oh, worship the Lord and
[1:18:30] the beauty of holiness." It says, "Give
[1:18:33] unto the Lord the glory due unto his
[1:18:35] name and worship the Lord in the beauty
[1:18:36] of holiness, the adornment of glory."
[1:18:39] It's some sort of ornament of honor.
[1:18:42] It's beauty which is intrinsic, not
[1:18:44] shallow.
[1:18:46] And if we're not careful in this age,
[1:18:47] we're in the last the last church age is
[1:18:50] a Leodysian church age which is
[1:18:52] concerned primarily with optics. If
[1:18:54] we're not careful as a bride and we get
[1:18:56] our eye on that church that's descending
[1:18:59] down into darkness, still in the leine
[1:19:01] age, descending into death, we who are
[1:19:04] in the bride age, ascending up to a body
[1:19:06] change and a meeting in the air, if we
[1:19:08] get our eyes on that church, we will get
[1:19:11] out of step.
[1:19:13] We get in tuned too much to the what
[1:19:15] they look like because they're all about
[1:19:16] optics. They're all about sound.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; It's not about character. It's not
[1:19:20] what's on the inside that's being
[1:19:23] emphasized. This is a beauty which is
[1:19:24] intrinsic. There's an outward beauty
[1:19:27] that anyone can put on, but this is
[1:19:28] something where there's this sacredness,
[1:19:30] this separateness.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; It's a distinguishing characteristic
[1:19:35] that actually gives something value.
[1:19:44] Now, with these principles, I hope I'm
[1:19:46] putting together that God is holy. We've
[1:19:50] been called to be holy. Let's look at
[1:19:52] the principle that no sacrifice to God
[1:19:55] could have any blemish. There could be
[1:19:57] no sickness or disease. It could even it
[1:20:00] couldn't be ugly to sight and it
[1:20:02] couldn't smell bad. And the more you
[1:20:04] think about it, you think, "Wow, that's
[1:20:05] just really picky." And and it might
[1:20:08] seem discriminatory because even when it
[1:20:10] came to Levitical priesthood, you know,
[1:20:11] there were certain blemishes, certain
[1:20:12] birth defects, and those things they
[1:20:14] couldn't even serve. And if you don't
[1:20:16] know the nature and heart of God, then
[1:20:19] you begin to think, "Oh my goodness, he
[1:20:22] is so prejudiced.
[1:20:24] He is so uh privileged, right? This is
[1:20:28] divine privilege. This is ridiculous."
[1:20:31] Like he and he's he's he's shaming this
[1:20:34] and he's shaming that and he's got a
[1:20:36] problem with this. No, that's not it at
[1:20:37] all. As a matter of fact, you'll realize
[1:20:39] that it's not until you can fully
[1:20:41] appreciate wellness that you can have
[1:20:44] empathy for those who are not well.
[1:20:47] But if you try to destigmatize or if you
[1:20:50] try to tolerate everything and make
[1:20:53] everything okay and normalize
[1:20:54] everything, then actually the value that
[1:20:56] we ought to give to the uncumbly parts
[1:20:59] and the value that we ought to have for
[1:21:00] those who are feeble and the love and
[1:21:02] the care and the opportunities that we
[1:21:04] ought to get to those who otherwise
[1:21:06] aren't able, it loses its distinction.
[1:21:09] Why? Because you're there's no
[1:21:10] distinction anymore.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you should be able to do this. You
[1:21:13] have every right to do this. and and
[1:21:15] therefore the very things sometimes that
[1:21:17] God is relying upon either to provoke us
[1:21:19] to love and to good works or to show his
[1:21:21] glory, we just normalize to the point to
[1:21:24] where we just all get along. Everyone's
[1:21:26] just the same. Everyone has the same
[1:21:27] rights and privileges.
[1:21:30] So, there's something about knowing the
[1:21:32] heart of God even when he's requiring
[1:21:34] these things and where it's coming from.
[1:21:36] He says in Exodus 12:5 in the e in the
[1:21:39] initial uh feast of Passover he says
[1:21:41] your lamb shall be without blemish
[1:21:44] when he gives this law in Leviticus 22
[1:21:46] he says you shall offer a male without
[1:21:48] blemish anything that hath a blemish you
[1:21:50] cannot offer because it will not be
[1:21:53] acceptable for you he says it shall be
[1:21:55] perfect to be accepted there shall be no
[1:21:58] blemish therein
[1:22:00] these are the offerings that ought to be
[1:22:01] given to God so something God is
[1:22:04] expressing in
[1:22:06] In Malachi 1:es 7 and 8, he says, "You
[1:22:09] offer polluted bread upon my altar." You
[1:22:13] say, "Wherein have we polluted thee?" In
[1:22:15] that you say, "The table of the Lord is
[1:22:17] contemptable.
[1:22:19] And if you offer the blind for
[1:22:20] sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you
[1:22:23] offer the lame and sick, is it not
[1:22:25] evil?" And then he says this, catch
[1:22:28] this. If it's there, this is good for
[1:22:30] you to read this. Offer it now
[1:22:36] unto thy governor.
[1:22:38] Will he be pleased with thee? Or accept
[1:22:40] thy person, sayaith the Lord of hosts.
[1:22:43] Give it give it to somebody of renown.
[1:22:47] Make that offering or that sacrifice to
[1:22:49] anyone else. What are they going to say?
[1:22:52] Like, oh, they didn't give me the choice
[1:22:53] or they they did they were going to have
[1:22:55] to throw this out anyways. They didn't
[1:22:57] want to use this. They're there. It's
[1:22:59] not. It would be disrespectful.
[1:23:02] It would be contemptable. It's something
[1:23:03] that's disdained or despised. In other
[1:23:06] words, it's a worthless sacrifice.
[1:23:09] There's there's no sacrificing in giving
[1:23:11] it. There may be some of you who who
[1:23:13] have done that before where something uh
[1:23:15] is you've gotten two of the same thing
[1:23:17] and you can't use the second one or
[1:23:19] something's wrong with it or whatever
[1:23:20] and you just give it away and you can't
[1:23:22] really tell yourself, "Wow, I feel so
[1:23:24] good that I gave that vacuum cleaner to
[1:23:26] Goodwill." you know, Goodwill is going
[1:23:28] to really be able to profit off of that
[1:23:29] and maybe somebody who could use it buy
[1:23:30] it at a cheap price. You know, it don't
[1:23:32] work.
[1:23:33] Hey, you can't feel good about that.
[1:23:37] And so, these Old Testament sacrifices
[1:23:40] needed to be perfect.
[1:23:42] There's a lot more in it than what I'm
[1:23:44] going to zero in on, but they typed or
[1:23:46] foreshadowed the coming of that
[1:23:47] unblenmished, immaculate lamb of God. 1
[1:23:50] Peter 1:19 says, "But with the precious
[1:23:53] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[1:23:55] blemish and without spot."
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; The language that is used about the
[1:23:59] perfection of Christ hearkens the Jew to
[1:24:03] the laws of the sacrifice.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Everything that they use to describe
[1:24:07] Christ as a lamb would have reminded
[1:24:10] them that their sacrifices must be
[1:24:12] perfect in order to be accepted. You
[1:24:14] could not offer the blind. You could not
[1:24:16] offer the lame. You could not offer the
[1:24:17] sick. Therefore, Christ fulfills that
[1:24:20] foreshadowing or that type. In 2
[1:24:23] Corinthians 5:21, it says, "For he made
[1:24:25] him to be sin for us who knew no sin
[1:24:28] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:24:30] of God in him." He knew no sin. He was
[1:24:34] not lame. He was not sick. Hebrews 9 11
[1:24:36] and 12. And then verse 14, but Christ
[1:24:39] being come a high priest of good things
[1:24:41] to come, by a greater and more perfect
[1:24:44] tabernacle, not made with hands, that is
[1:24:46] to say, not of this building, neither by
[1:24:48] the blood of goats and calavs, but by
[1:24:50] his own blood, he entered in once into
[1:24:53] the holy place, having obtained eternal
[1:24:55] redemption for us. He fulfills every
[1:24:58] virtually every shadow and every type of
[1:25:01] that day of atonement. He is the lamb
[1:25:03] who shed his blood. He is the high
[1:25:05] priest that takes the blood in behind
[1:25:08] the veil. This is why Christ in his
[1:25:10] ascension said, "I have not yet
[1:25:12] ascended." Because he had to go and
[1:25:14] present behind the veil in heaven the
[1:25:17] blood of the sacrifice.
[1:25:19] And having presented himself before God
[1:25:22] as the high priest, it forever satisfied
[1:25:25] God's wrath for the elect.
[1:25:29] So he is he's in this image of these
[1:25:31] perfect sacrifices. He says in verse 14,
[1:25:33] "How much more shall the blood of
[1:25:35] Christ, who through the eternal spirit
[1:25:36] offered himself without spot to God,
[1:25:39] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:25:42] serve the living God?"
[1:25:45] These very specific details about God's
[1:25:47] holiness
[1:25:49] required a very specific sacrifice that
[1:25:51] was holy, which foreshadowed the coming
[1:25:55] of a perfect sacrifice, Jesus Christ,
[1:25:57] for us. And so as the Old Testament
[1:26:00] foreshadowed Christ, now the New
[1:26:02] Testament previews the coming of a
[1:26:04] perfect bride. In Ephesians chapter 1
[1:26:07] verses 45-6, let's just push pause for a
[1:26:11] moment.
[1:26:19] Ephesians 1:es 4, 5, and 6. according as
[1:26:22] he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:26:25] foundation of the world that we should
[1:26:27] be holy and without blame before him. I
[1:26:30] know I didn't spend a lot of time on it.
[1:26:32] I just tried to be very quick touch on
[1:26:33] it. This is the language of the Old
[1:26:35] Testament. To be holy and without blame
[1:26:38] speaks to the laws of the sacrifice that
[1:26:40] it ought not to be lame or sick, that it
[1:26:42] had to be perfect to be accepted.
[1:26:45] So we ought to be holy and without blame
[1:26:47] before him in love, having predestined
[1:26:49] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:26:51] Jesus Christ to himself, according to
[1:26:53] the good pleasure of his will, to the
[1:26:56] praise of the glory of his grace,
[1:26:57] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:27:00] beloved. So herein is that language of a
[1:27:03] perfect sacrifice being accepted, that
[1:27:07] now we are not just uh partakers of
[1:27:10] salvation, but we are to be partakers of
[1:27:12] his holiness.
[1:27:14] Ephesians 5:es 25- 27. Husbands, love
[1:27:17] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:27:19] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:27:21] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:27:23] washing of water by the word. This gives
[1:27:26] this brings up the imagery of Old
[1:27:28] Testament sacrifices. We see it
[1:27:30] portrayed in the lamb himself being
[1:27:32] baptized and being sacrificed on the
[1:27:34] cross that he might present it to
[1:27:36] himself a glorious church not having
[1:27:39] spot or wrinkle or any such thing that
[1:27:42] it should be holy and without blemish.
[1:27:44] All the characteristics of a proper
[1:27:46] sacrifice.
[1:27:48] Colossians 1:22 says in the body of his
[1:27:50] flesh through death to present you holy
[1:27:52] and unblamable and unprovable in his
[1:27:55] sight. So the perfect sacrifice Christ
[1:27:57] was given that we would through that
[1:27:59] perfect blood in the body of his flesh
[1:28:02] be able to be presented as holy and
[1:28:04] unbelievable and unprovable in his
[1:28:07] sight. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians
[1:28:09] chapter 6 11, "And such were some of
[1:28:12] you." If you want to go find out what
[1:28:13] you were, just read the verses prior.
[1:28:15] But you're washed, but you are
[1:28:17] sanctified. But you are justified in the
[1:28:19] name of Jesus Christ and by the spirit
[1:28:21] of our God. Now, having been made clean,
[1:28:23] we're made ready for holiness. We're
[1:28:26] going through the same pattern of the
[1:28:27] sacrifices. It's not that Christ
[1:28:29] fulfilled all of it and now we're just
[1:28:31] recipients of his grace. And isn't God
[1:28:33] wonderful? And you just come as you are,
[1:28:35] stay as you are, live as you want,
[1:28:36] identify however you want, and that we
[1:28:38] think it's a gospel or grace without
[1:28:40] consequence. What was foreshadowed in
[1:28:42] the Old Testament, yes, is is preserved
[1:28:44] permanently forever in this unblenmished
[1:28:47] sacrifice of Jesus Christ. But now the
[1:28:49] New Testament is teaching that we who
[1:28:51] are recipients of his life and have been
[1:28:53] washed in his blood as that sacrifice
[1:28:56] foreshadowed a perfect Christ. Now this
[1:28:59] sacrifice foreshadows the coming of a
[1:29:01] perfect bride
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; who is washed in his blood who's
[1:29:05] watching marching in righteousness and
[1:29:07] holiness who's living a plain path so
[1:29:09] that others who are an error can say
[1:29:11] this is the right way
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; though it be a way called foolishness
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; in Romans 12:es 1 and 2 I beseech you
[1:29:20] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[1:29:22] that you present your bodies a living
[1:29:24] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God,
[1:29:28] which is your reasonable service. And be
[1:29:30] not conformed to this world, but be
[1:29:32] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:29:34] mind, that you may prove what is that
[1:29:36] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:29:39] God. It's my understanding that there's
[1:29:41] a tri-state youth meeting this afternoon
[1:29:44] and my I'll just give a little preview
[1:29:46] so that all the young people who are
[1:29:47] here now won't stay home. Maybe this
[1:29:49] will kind of grease the skids a little
[1:29:50] bit, but I want to take from here and
[1:29:52] preach that's not normal.
[1:29:56] And take it from that scripture. The
[1:29:58] world's going to conform things. And
[1:29:59] when the world does it, it says it's
[1:30:01] normal.
[1:30:03] But be you transformed by the renewing
[1:30:05] of your mind. The Bible is teaching that
[1:30:08] our outward expression should be free
[1:30:10] from any defect that mars the image of
[1:30:13] God in us.
[1:30:16] I know this may seem difficult to
[1:30:18] process and it may seem counterintuitive
[1:30:20] to grace and it may seem like well I
[1:30:22] mean didn't he he died for my sins and
[1:30:24] there's people that have brokenness and
[1:30:25] there's people maybe that are missing
[1:30:27] limbs and there's people that are sick
[1:30:28] and we realize but yet in heaven there's
[1:30:30] going to be a perfect body
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; and we realize that divine healing is
[1:30:35] given here on earth for those things and
[1:30:37] there may be circumstances in our lives
[1:30:39] where there's permanent scars and
[1:30:40] there's certain disfigurations in our
[1:30:42] flesh but yet there's a way that those
[1:30:44] are yielded to God to bring glory to
[1:30:46] God. Therefore, there's things that we
[1:30:48] have control over and things that we
[1:30:50] submit to God that are within our
[1:30:52] choosing that can be used to express
[1:30:55] that perfect divine nature of God. What
[1:30:58] we express outwardly, we should submit
[1:31:01] ourselves and yield ourselves and desire
[1:31:03] that it be free from any defect, any
[1:31:06] variance that mars the image of God. The
[1:31:09] sacrifice was to be beautiful without
[1:31:11] abomination. That may be the most key
[1:31:12] word to to zero in on when it comes to
[1:31:15] the sickness and the mouring and the
[1:31:17] laming, the lame. It was something that
[1:31:19] was abomination to God, detestable,
[1:31:22] vile.
[1:31:23] Our lives should be free from that.
[1:31:26] Therefore, I believe that in your life,
[1:31:28] you should be striving for beauty.
[1:31:32] 1 Corinthians 15:49, as we have borne
[1:31:35] the image of the earthly, we shall also
[1:31:37] bear the image of the heavenly. In 1
[1:31:40] Peter 2, we're told that we are a holy
[1:31:42] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:31:44] sacrifices acceptable to God. So if we
[1:31:47] are then born first in the image of the
[1:31:49] earthly by the new birth, we ought to
[1:31:51] aspire to bear the image of the heavenly
[1:31:53] as a spiritual priesthood who now
[1:31:56] without blemish in our souls and without
[1:31:58] defect in our souls are offering up
[1:32:00] visible things in our lives
[1:32:03] as an acceptable sacrifice to God.
[1:32:06] Romans 6 chapters exc 12 13 and 14. Let
[1:32:12] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[1:32:14] body that you should obey it in the lust
[1:32:16] thereof. Neither yield ye your members
[1:32:20] as instruments of unrighteousness unto
[1:32:22] sin. But yield yourselves unto God as
[1:32:25] those that are alive from the dead, and
[1:32:27] your members as instruments of
[1:32:29] righteousness unto God. For sin shall
[1:32:32] not have dominion over you. For you are
[1:32:34] not under the law, but under grace.
[1:32:38] How is it that he could teach that under
[1:32:40] the headship of grace, you're compelled
[1:32:42] to live more holy when we often think
[1:32:45] that grace uh kind of plates us to
[1:32:48] accept ourselves as we are because we
[1:32:51] believe that God has accepted us as we
[1:32:53] are and is fine if we stay as we are.
[1:32:56] but rather in terms of whether we yield
[1:32:58] ourselves to sin to manifest blemish and
[1:33:01] abomination and unrighteousness. He
[1:33:03] says, "Now yield yourselves to God,
[1:33:05] which we ought to believe by the new
[1:33:06] birth is living in us, that our members,
[1:33:09] our body, our flesh, our hair, our eyes,
[1:33:12] everything could be yielded to God to be
[1:33:14] instruments of righteousness."
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Because we're not under the law, which
[1:33:20] produces death, and under the law, which
[1:33:22] is to try to bring sin under dominion,
[1:33:24] but rather we are under grace.
[1:33:26] Therefore, the headship of grace can
[1:33:28] produce in you a genuine holiness and
[1:33:31] sanctification.
[1:33:33] As it says in the Bible that grace has
[1:33:35] appeared teaching that in this present
[1:33:38] world, we ought to live holy. That's
[1:33:40] what grace does. It teaches us how to
[1:33:42] live holy in an ungodly age.
[1:33:46] The Bible says in Deuteronomy 17:1,
[1:33:51] and we're doing fantastic on time. I
[1:33:54] don't know if I'll be right on that
[1:33:55] hour, brother Paul, but I'll try.
[1:33:58] The This is now with those principles
[1:34:01] set. Let's just look at uh this one of
[1:34:05] the things that kind of combines it all
[1:34:06] together. God is holy. He requires a
[1:34:08] holy sacrifice.
[1:34:10] And then he requires holiness of us. So
[1:34:12] in the Old Testament, there's this image
[1:34:15] in the Old Testament which was
[1:34:17] legislated that we under grace now
[1:34:21] manifest.
[1:34:23] It's not impersonation. It's just
[1:34:24] manifestation. Deuteronomy 17:1, "Thou
[1:34:27] shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[1:34:29] God any bulock or sheep wherein is
[1:34:31] blemish or any evil favoredness, for
[1:34:34] that is an abomination unto the Lord thy
[1:34:37] God." Often times when you read in the
[1:34:40] law, you'll read instances where God
[1:34:41] says, "You can't wash this pot with that
[1:34:43] pen. You can't wear this fabric with
[1:34:45] that fabric. You got to uh you have to
[1:34:47] shave your beard a certain way." And
[1:34:48] there's a lot of things that we could
[1:34:49] read and we say, "Well, well, that's not
[1:34:50] that's a law. We don't have to do that."
[1:34:52] And then certain things get kind of
[1:34:53] carried over and the debate is always
[1:34:55] well how come you do this but you mix
[1:34:57] your cotton with your linens. It's
[1:34:59] because some things were an abomination
[1:35:00] to God and other things were just
[1:35:02] legislated by God.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Some things God said that wouldn't
[1:35:06] necessarily be imposed upon them as a
[1:35:09] way of pleasing him but rather it was
[1:35:11] good practices for them. And there's
[1:35:13] other things he says don't do this cuz I
[1:35:15] hate it. And here it says that blemish
[1:35:18] and evil favoredness to be offered are
[1:35:20] an abomination unto the Lord. It's
[1:35:22] something unpleasant. If there's an evil
[1:35:24] favoredness, it's something unpleasant
[1:35:27] or unattractive.
[1:35:28] An unattractive condition or an
[1:35:30] unpleasant appearance either marked by
[1:35:33] moral or even spiritual corruption is
[1:35:35] one way that this could be applied. But
[1:35:37] these outward expressions then of
[1:35:39] unbelief or wickedness, these are the
[1:35:41] things that mar the image of God in
[1:35:43] humanity. He says there should not be a
[1:35:46] sacrifice of bullock or sheep wherein
[1:35:48] there's blemish or evil favoredness.
[1:35:50] It's this outward unattractiveness, this
[1:35:52] outward unpleasantness even to the
[1:35:54] smell. They couldn't offer something
[1:35:56] that didn't smell right. So when the
[1:35:59] Bible is telling us that we ought to be
[1:36:00] holy and we're offering ourselves up as
[1:36:02] as sacrifices, there are certain outward
[1:36:05] expressions that mar the image of God in
[1:36:08] humanity.
[1:36:09] And these abominations generally in the
[1:36:12] Old Testament were something, I just
[1:36:13] want to generalize it, were things that
[1:36:15] God found disgusting.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Abominations were disgusting or foul.
[1:36:21] Even to the individual, it's something
[1:36:22] that make you recoil like, "Oh, that's
[1:36:24] disgusting. That smells bad." I think
[1:36:27] we've all been there before where
[1:36:28] somebody tastes something. Oh, that is
[1:36:31] that's the worst thing I've ever tasted.
[1:36:32] Taste it.
[1:36:36] They drink something. Oh, that's
[1:36:38] horrible. Taste this. Smell this. And
[1:36:39] you're like,
[1:36:41] seriously, why? Why would I do that? I
[1:36:44] want you to be the only one who's tasted
[1:36:46] that today.
[1:36:49] So, when it says it's an abomination of
[1:36:51] the Lord thy God, it's things that God
[1:36:54] finds disgusting,
[1:36:57] things that are detestable to God. We
[1:36:58] could debate all day long whether or not
[1:37:00] we think that's fair, but God's whatever
[1:37:02] God says is true. Whatever God does is
[1:37:04] just,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; just the way that it is.
[1:37:08] And he says, as we read already, I am
[1:37:11] God. I for I am the Lord and I change
[1:37:14] not. If he deplored something, then if
[1:37:17] he hated something, then he hates it
[1:37:19] now.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; If I've been long-suffering and I
[1:37:22] haven't judged things and I've allowed
[1:37:23] things to continue and things have
[1:37:25] flourished and things seem to be
[1:37:26] accepted, just because I haven't judged
[1:37:29] it and wiped it off the face of the
[1:37:31] earth, don't think that I've changed in
[1:37:33] my attitude towards it. Just because of
[1:37:35] all Christian dem may be doing something
[1:37:37] or things seem broadly accepted and I
[1:37:40] haven't judged it and wiped it off the
[1:37:41] face of the earth. Don't think that my
[1:37:42] nature's changed. If I said I hated it
[1:37:45] then I still hate it now.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And God hates hates a blemish sacrifice.
[1:37:51] The scripture speaks of a spot, a
[1:37:53] defect, some physical deformity, some
[1:37:55] even in a sense a moral stain.
[1:37:59] He hates it. It's all within this
[1:38:00] context in the perspective of holiness.
[1:38:04] evil favored. He says, "I hate things
[1:38:06] that are evil favored." It's a very
[1:38:09] interesting word, but it's something
[1:38:10] that lacks symmetry.
[1:38:13] Now, evil favored to me
[1:38:17] sounds like it'd be something that
[1:38:18] immediately when you look at it, you're
[1:38:20] just like, "Oh." But evil favored is you
[1:38:22] look at it and you don't know why, but
[1:38:24] something's off.
[1:38:27] You're not even quite sure, but
[1:38:29] something's off. In other words, it it
[1:38:31] lacks the beauty of symmetry.
[1:38:34] There's some ugliness to it. Something
[1:38:36] is out of place. There's some defor
[1:38:38] deformity in in art and in architecture
[1:38:40] and things. There's this idea of the
[1:38:42] divine proportion
[1:38:44] because there's something these laws
[1:38:46] that they different rules that they use
[1:38:48] and different ways that they try to
[1:38:49] present something that is just naturally
[1:38:51] pleasing to the eye. To a photographer,
[1:38:54] it may be the rule of thirds. And
[1:38:55] there's just a way that you can take a
[1:38:57] picture and you may look at it and be
[1:38:58] like, "Wow, that just draws me in.
[1:39:00] That's engaging. I wish I could take a
[1:39:02] picture of somebody's patio and it
[1:39:03] looked like that." So, you go outside
[1:39:05] and you get your iPhone, you take a
[1:39:06] picture of your patio and you compare it
[1:39:08] to theirs. You're like, "How come I've
[1:39:09] got the same equipment, but I can't make
[1:39:12] it work." But you what you realize is
[1:39:14] that person who took the photo that you
[1:39:16] just it's of a patio. That's all it is.
[1:39:17] But yet, there's something really
[1:39:19] engaging. They haven't used any effects.
[1:39:20] There's no Photoshop going on. There's
[1:39:23] no filters. They just use the right
[1:39:26] lighting for the right perspective. They
[1:39:28] line certain things up. A tree in the
[1:39:30] foreground, a post in the uh in the
[1:39:33] background, and they line everything up
[1:39:35] and they take the picture. And we see
[1:39:37] beauty in it. We see beauty in the
[1:39:39] symmetry. We see beauty in the
[1:39:41] proportions.
[1:39:43] Evil favoredness is something even if
[1:39:45] it's not necessarily detectable to the
[1:39:47] eye, it's something unpleasant or
[1:39:49] unattractive in the condition or
[1:39:52] appearance.
[1:39:55] They did a study one time
[1:39:58] and
[1:40:00] I might have mentioned this at a winter
[1:40:02] youth retreat. I know you all remember
[1:40:03] everything I've ever said at winter
[1:40:04] youth retreat. So for those adults here
[1:40:06] who are now, you know, have
[1:40:08] grandchildren and can remember those
[1:40:09] youth retreats, you'll be like, I
[1:40:10] remember that. I remember where I was
[1:40:11] sitting and when he said it and the
[1:40:12] slide he used and everything. So just
[1:40:14] humor humor me now while we just kind of
[1:40:16] update everybody else on where we're
[1:40:17] coming from. But they did a study where
[1:40:20] if you gave them the cho somebody the
[1:40:22] choice of choosing of three faces
[1:40:25] which one was the most attractive.
[1:40:27] They they took one guy's picture and
[1:40:30] they had that in there just the way that
[1:40:32] he was. And they took another picture of
[1:40:34] him just with his nose kind of a little
[1:40:36] bit slanted and they just put another
[1:40:38] picture in there. And the by the great
[1:40:42] majority of the time, almost every time,
[1:40:44] everyone always picked the guy, the
[1:40:46] original picture of the guy uh as the
[1:40:49] most attractive because the fact that
[1:40:51] the other one looked really a lot like
[1:40:54] him, but his nose was slightly
[1:40:55] disfigured. It had this dominance effect
[1:40:58] where they began to compare the two and
[1:40:59] they chose the one that was, you know,
[1:41:02] didn't have the crooked nose. And so the
[1:41:04] conclusion of the study was to always
[1:41:07] hang out with a friend who looked just
[1:41:09] like you but was just slightly uglier.
[1:41:13] There's science working for you.
[1:41:17] Problem is I just couldn't find anybody
[1:41:19] uglier than me.
[1:41:21] So got married. God's good.
[1:41:24] In Deuteronomy 22:5, this is maybe where
[1:41:27] it gets real. You might think, well,
[1:41:29] that escalated quickly. But it says,
[1:41:30] "The woman shall not wear that which
[1:41:32] pertainth unto a man, neither shall a
[1:41:34] man put on a woman's garment. For all
[1:41:37] that do so are abomination unto the Lord
[1:41:40] thy God." Very important to catch that
[1:41:43] when God prescribes a garment to a man
[1:41:45] and a garment to a woman and says that
[1:41:48] those that would do the inverse, he says
[1:41:50] those that do so are abomination unto
[1:41:54] the Lord thy God. This is not in the
[1:41:56] general prescriptions that would be just
[1:41:57] things that he's prescribing. But this
[1:41:59] is actually ascribed to something that
[1:42:02] God detests,
[1:42:04] something that God is not happy with,
[1:42:05] something that God despises. And what we
[1:42:07] could do is we could just impose certain
[1:42:09] things as far as optics and make these
[1:42:11] broad categories or even very narrow
[1:42:13] categories of what a garment is of a man
[1:42:15] and a garment is of a woman and just try
[1:42:16] to impose that. But we can very quickly
[1:42:18] even sincerely just adopt certain things
[1:42:21] as a norm or a course for our church
[1:42:23] services, for church order, for worship,
[1:42:25] all sorts of things. But if we never
[1:42:27] know the heart of God, we run the risk
[1:42:29] of a derivative work that was never
[1:42:31] associated with his work.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; He says that I despise those that do so.
[1:42:40] Why? Because by nature, the man and the
[1:42:43] woman are different.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:46] By nature and by design, they're
[1:42:49] different. Thus, it's proper to observe
[1:42:53] the differences in dress.
[1:42:57] And God is saying, for either to dress
[1:42:59] or act like the other destroys the
[1:43:02] distinctions that God had in their
[1:43:05] character. That's right.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; It destroys the divisions and the
[1:43:08] differences that God wanted to
[1:43:09] harmonize. The woman being a help me,
[1:43:11] she was equal but opposite. She was a
[1:43:15] mirror image and you notice in a mirror
[1:43:16] image that it's it's not it's the
[1:43:19] opposite and so it's complimentary
[1:43:22] that in the mirror image that it being
[1:43:24] reversed then there's a way that they
[1:43:26] harmonize together because it's
[1:43:28] inverted.
[1:43:30] It's a way you can shake hands with
[1:43:31] yourself in a mirror.
[1:43:36] But the mirror as it's implied in the
[1:43:38] scripture that mirror image
[1:43:47] Just want to be sure that we have a good
[1:43:49] landing spot here as we've come up
[1:43:50] against our time limit.
[1:43:52] That which is an abomination to God
[1:43:56] is something that God hates.
[1:44:00] So we could see we could begin to
[1:44:01] conceptualize an image of what God
[1:44:04] hates.
[1:44:05] But what he hates is more of a
[1:44:07] consequence of what he loves.
[1:44:09] It's not that God just has this
[1:44:11] instinctive hate for something, but it
[1:44:13] it's he has a love so great for one
[1:44:17] thing. Yes.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; That by by a necessity,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; he hates the other.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; That God loves things the way he made it
[1:44:26] so much that to pervert it becomes anti
[1:44:30] what he made.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; And his love for something holy requires
[1:44:34] him to hate something unholy.
[1:44:37] Because if God loves something so much
[1:44:39] and we remove the distinctions to where
[1:44:41] that which is unholy can therefore be
[1:44:43] accepted and on par with that which is
[1:44:45] holy, we've completely erased God's
[1:44:47] love. We've just made him apathetic.
[1:44:51] We've just made him tolerant. We've
[1:44:53] completely changed the nature of God to
[1:44:55] where now we've watered down the love of
[1:44:57] God. He just loves everybody the same.
[1:44:59] And therefore, it's no longer this
[1:45:01] passionate, intense love.
[1:45:03] I know there's a song uh and u that was
[1:45:08] spoke of the recklessness of God's love
[1:45:11] and and and I I heard it sung one time
[1:45:13] at church where they changed it uh to I
[1:45:16] can't even remember what it was.
[1:45:17] Somebody help me out here. Instead of
[1:45:19] reckless, it was
[1:45:22] precious love. Thank you. Are you the
[1:45:23] one that rewrote it? And and I thought I
[1:45:26] thought that's nice, right? I thought
[1:45:28] that's nice. But really from a human
[1:45:30] standpoint that love is reckless.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That's why even I guess now some of the
[1:45:36] buzzword in songwriting is his love is
[1:45:37] not safe and we think wait a minute I
[1:45:39] thought that's where I want to be. But
[1:45:40] there is something about God's passion.
[1:45:42] It's a torrent that cannot be stopped.
[1:45:45] Many waters cannot cover it up put it
[1:45:47] out. Nothing can bar. God's love is so
[1:45:49] passionate that it requires the opposite
[1:45:51] which is called hate.
[1:45:54] If we remove the distinctions of the
[1:45:55] things God loves and we begin to project
[1:45:57] his love towards things that are
[1:45:58] hateful, it devalues and diminishes his
[1:46:01] passion for those things that he loves.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; God is the author of true beauty.
[1:46:09] He loves the original symmetry. He loves
[1:46:12] that harmony of beauty. He made man and
[1:46:14] woman differently for that purpose.
[1:46:17] Proverbsap 3:32 says, "For the forward
[1:46:20] is abomination to the Lord, but his
[1:46:23] secret is with the righteous."
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; The forward, that means those that
[1:46:27] depart,
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; those that go crooked,
[1:46:31] those that are to that lose truth from
[1:46:34] view.
[1:46:36] That's what forwardness is. It hides
[1:46:38] truth. It perverts truth. to depart, to
[1:46:42] go wrong, to get crooked or to pervert,
[1:46:43] to allow the original to be lost from
[1:46:46] view. Who what is someone who's forward?
[1:46:48] It's when they allow truth to be lost
[1:46:50] from view in the way that they live
[1:46:53] their lives. The way that they treat
[1:46:54] others, a lie is to truth mistold. Why
[1:46:56] are they forward? Because they perverted
[1:46:58] a lie, a truth, made it a lie, and
[1:47:00] therefore truth is lost from view.
[1:47:03] In Proverbs 20:10, diverse weights and
[1:47:05] diverse measures, both of them are
[1:47:07] alike, abomination to the Lord. What
[1:47:10] does God hate then? Injustice.
[1:47:13] He hates different weights and different
[1:47:15] measures. When one would buy or sell
[1:47:17] fraudulently
[1:47:19] in a way that you perceive that
[1:47:20] something weighs so much or you suggest
[1:47:22] that it does, but when in fact it
[1:47:24] doesn't, ways that you could manipulate
[1:47:26] currency, ways that people defrauded one
[1:47:28] another. God does not like it when you
[1:47:30] present as something you are not.
[1:47:33] God does not like it when you live in a
[1:47:36] way that is contrary and that's
[1:47:37] hypocritical to what you are. The fro
[1:47:40] are ab abomination to the Lord. False
[1:47:43] measures and false weights are an
[1:47:44] abomination to the Lord. That's not just
[1:47:46] Old Testament rhetoric. That's true
[1:47:48] today of a God that never changes.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; For a woman to wear that which pertainth
[1:47:55] to a man, the woman that does so is
[1:47:58] abomination unto the Lord. A man that
[1:48:00] shall put on a woman's garment, the man
[1:48:02] is abomination to the Lord. Notice it's
[1:48:06] not so much emphasizing the garments as
[1:48:08] abomination, but those who misuse dress.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Those who misuse the way they dress
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; for the wrong reasons or to present
[1:48:18] something that's contrary to God's
[1:48:19] original symmetry and order.
[1:48:24] I believe we could pause there and just
[1:48:26] even in end there and there should be
[1:48:27] enough that uh for you to chew on and
[1:48:30] your response could be well brother
[1:48:31] Aaron you shared enough something's
[1:48:33] liable to stick you know something's
[1:48:35] liable to stick you threw so much out
[1:48:36] there well you have helicopter preachers
[1:48:39] and maybe I'm just the shotgun
[1:48:42] we'll get we'll spread enough out there
[1:48:43] where somebody's like oh I think he got
[1:48:44] me
[1:48:48] and maybe in this case flesh wounds
[1:48:51] count for Um,
[1:48:56] now this is this is where I feel that if
[1:48:58] you've been with me so far in the
[1:49:00] journey, it's it's not going to come out
[1:49:02] from left field because there's a lot I
[1:49:04] would like to bring in, but I want to I
[1:49:05] want to close here in a moment.
[1:49:08] In Genesis 3:7,
[1:49:11] this is the effect of the fall. And
[1:49:13] because there's a lot of arguments
[1:49:14] sometimes in terms of holiness that it
[1:49:17] could be argued this is internal
[1:49:18] holiness. this is an intrinsic holiness
[1:49:20] in a person's heart or in a person's
[1:49:21] soul and that the outward is contrived.
[1:49:24] There's even an argument that modesty
[1:49:26] and I think modesty is a good term that
[1:49:28] we could have been using this morning
[1:49:31] because when someone shows restraint
[1:49:34] when they're visualizing art and even in
[1:49:36] music, one of the secrets and I want to
[1:49:39] go ahead and teach you guys how to write
[1:49:41] music. Sister Sher, I hope you're taking
[1:49:43] notes because this is going to be really
[1:49:44] helpful. Brother Ike, when you're
[1:49:46] composing music, if you could just zero
[1:49:47] in on this. A lot of times, it's the
[1:49:49] restraint
[1:49:51] that makes a composition so beautiful.
[1:49:54] It's not just making everything loud and
[1:49:56] everything in and and pronouncing
[1:49:58] everything and making everything uh
[1:50:00] stand out is a way that you allow things
[1:50:02] through restraint and through
[1:50:03] self-control. There's actual modesty
[1:50:05] with beauty.
[1:50:07] That's why modern art just really is
[1:50:09] Satan's Eden perfected where we can duct
[1:50:11] tape a banana on the wall and pay
[1:50:12] millions of dollars for it. It's the
[1:50:15] mindset of Leodysia
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; because there's no rationale in it.
[1:50:19] There's no vision. There's no purpose.
[1:50:21] There's no utility. And so modesty can
[1:50:24] be is connected with the beauty of
[1:50:26] holiness. And there's a lot that argue
[1:50:28] that modesty is the construct of man
[1:50:32] that man has imposed these rules that
[1:50:34] man has come up with these. I want you
[1:50:36] to recognize then in this difference
[1:50:38] because I'm speaking to knowing God's
[1:50:41] heart or the work of God
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; versus the work of God. That which we
[1:50:48] see and we see the product. And we could
[1:50:51] say, well, we could say as believers,
[1:50:52] oh, the product is this, this, it's got
[1:50:53] to be holiness. It's got to be a long
[1:50:54] skirt. It's got to be the long hair. It
[1:50:56] can't be this. Can't be. Okay, that's
[1:50:57] right. We maybe we don't disagree with
[1:50:59] all of that, but we've got to produce
[1:51:02] it.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; By the heart of God. Amen.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; The author of holiness should be the
[1:51:08] author of holiness in your life.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; There's a way that we're teaching our
[1:51:11] children how to live holy, to live
[1:51:12] honestly, to live upright, have
[1:51:14] integrity, but what you desire one day
[1:51:16] is they get the spirit of holiness
[1:51:17] inside of them that becomes their
[1:51:19] metric. How to navigate themselves in an
[1:51:21] unholy world so that it's not just all
[1:51:24] pretense. Because where many people have
[1:51:27] failed when it came to this precious
[1:51:28] word of God we've received in this hour,
[1:51:30] it was all politics. It was all
[1:51:32] pretense. It was all optics. And once
[1:51:33] you pee behind the curtain and you saw
[1:51:35] the hypocrisy behind it, you had no
[1:51:37] taste.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; And what many people have rejected is
[1:51:41] not the original, it's the derivative.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And I say congratulation for sniffing
[1:51:46] out the fakes.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; So in Genesis 3:7, after the fall, it
[1:51:56] says, "And the eyes of them both were
[1:51:57] open, the man and woman now
[1:51:59] consciousness of their nakedness. They
[1:52:00] knew that they were naked and they have
[1:52:03] an instinct now. And they sewed fig
[1:52:06] leaves together and made themselves
[1:52:08] aprons.
[1:52:11] This Hebrew word, it means a loin cloth
[1:52:14] or girdle. It's in the Hebrew. So it
[1:52:18] said they made themselves aprons. We
[1:52:20] might be thinking, oh, you know, like
[1:52:21] one of those things you wear when you
[1:52:22] cook. No. Uh-uh. It was a loin cloth.
[1:52:24] That's what it was. So notice that man
[1:52:27] postfall where fear is now the primary
[1:52:30] motivator. The opening of their eyes
[1:52:32] awakened them to a shame of nakedness,
[1:52:36] a shame about those parts, a shame about
[1:52:39] that. And it caused them to put on
[1:52:42] clothing.
[1:52:43] So there is this instinct in man to
[1:52:46] cover and I want you to recognize this
[1:52:48] because this is important to actually
[1:52:50] cover the parts that made them
[1:52:52] different.
[1:52:54] There was this instinct to cover their
[1:52:56] parts by making an apron.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And the word there, this loin cloth, it
[1:53:02] actually I just I want to use this for
[1:53:03] the sake of understanding. Deuteronomy
[1:53:04] 25:1, it speaks of a woman taking a man
[1:53:07] by his secrets. And the word there,
[1:53:09] secrets is the same word, this boo this
[1:53:12] this uh the part that means that he was
[1:53:14] the part that excites shame.
[1:53:19] And so it they made these loin cloths
[1:53:21] that would only cover these parts of
[1:53:23] their body. And so as I mentioned
[1:53:25] before, there's this argument that
[1:53:26] modesty is the creation of man. Upon
[1:53:28] recognizing uh the sexual power of his
[1:53:30] body, he then does this to himself. He
[1:53:33] wants to cover himself.
[1:53:39] As one writer said, the sense of modesty
[1:53:41] is merely a habit, not an instinct. to
[1:53:44] make the argument that it's imposed and
[1:53:46] forced.
[1:53:48] Now, that may be true in practice that
[1:53:51] we impose modesty. We forced modesty so
[1:53:53] modesty becomes a habit rather than an
[1:53:55] instinct. And I'm arguing that we ought
[1:53:57] to have the instinct of God that we tend
[1:54:00] to holiness and modesty from an internal
[1:54:02] mechanism which is Christlike versus
[1:54:04] this discipline that we would have to
[1:54:07] impersonate modesty or impersonate
[1:54:09] worship.
[1:54:12] But after man has dressed himself in
[1:54:15] Genesis 3 21 says unto Adam also and his
[1:54:19] wife did God the Lord God make coats of
[1:54:22] skin and clothe them.
[1:54:26] It's God that institutes clothing.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Man in his instinctiveness might have
[1:54:30] invented underwear but it's God that
[1:54:33] invents clothing. Yes.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And what he does is he provides a
[1:54:36] covering not for just the the private
[1:54:39] parts, but it means a covering for the
[1:54:41] body. He made them coats of skins. And
[1:54:44] what did he make it from? An innocent
[1:54:46] lamb. Spotless lamb. A perfect lamb
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; who represents innocence, humility, and
[1:54:52] modesty. Yes.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:18. I want you to catch
[1:54:57] this because we might look at this and
[1:55:00] think, "Oh, well, God did the did the
[1:55:03] killing and God did the sewing and God
[1:55:05] put these things together." But there's
[1:55:06] something we need to recognize here. Man
[1:55:08] in his instinct will choose to dress a
[1:55:10] certain way, but God, when he wants to
[1:55:12] clothe, you clothe the body. Revelations
[1:55:16] 3:18, he says, 'I counsel thee to buy of
[1:55:17] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:55:19] mayest be rich in white raignment that
[1:55:21] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:55:23] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:55:26] anoint thine eyes with Isaav that thou
[1:55:28] mayest see. You are to acquire clothes
[1:55:33] that you may be clothed. In Isaiah 52:1,
[1:55:36] it says, "Awake, awake. Put on thy
[1:55:37] strength, O Zion. Put on thy beautiful
[1:55:40] garments,
[1:55:42] oh Jerusalem, the holy city." It says,
[1:55:44] "For henceforworth there shall no more
[1:55:45] come into thee the uncircumcised and
[1:55:47] unclean." What you're going to identify
[1:55:49] in the scripture, and I I say this maybe
[1:55:52] carefully because it's something that I
[1:55:54] think I can see in the scripture and
[1:55:55] support by scripture. Maybe it's not
[1:55:56] just explicitly said, but God did not
[1:55:59] literally come down and stitch the
[1:56:01] clothing together, but he provided it to
[1:56:03] Abra to Adam by his word.
[1:56:07] And Adam by revelation knew a lamb had
[1:56:10] to be slain. Why did Abel do it? The
[1:56:12] lamb had to be slain by revelation. And
[1:56:14] he provides through revelation the the
[1:56:17] means by which Adam is to dress himself.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; So God, the Lord God makes coats of
[1:56:23] skins and clothes him through his agent
[1:56:26] on earth.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Through God on earth, they made the
[1:56:30] skins that God now has ordained. And it
[1:56:32] didn't just clothe in those parts that
[1:56:34] excite shame, but it dressed the body.
[1:56:37] And in Revelations 19 7 and 8, it says,
[1:56:39] "Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:56:40] honor to him, for the marriage of the
[1:56:42] lamb has come, and his wife hath made
[1:56:45] herself ready, and to her was granted
[1:56:48] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:56:50] and clean white. For the fine linen is
[1:56:52] the righteousness of saints."
[1:56:55] When it says it was given or granted, it
[1:56:57] was required,
[1:56:59] but also supplied.
[1:57:02] He furnished these necessities. And when
[1:57:04] John sees this bride descend out of
[1:57:06] heaven, he saw her as a bride, the city
[1:57:08] of br as a bride adorned, made ready for
[1:57:12] her husband.
[1:57:16] Therefore, we should desire that God
[1:57:18] would give us the revelation
[1:57:20] of how that we ought to dress.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 5:es
[1:57:25] 22 to 24, abstain from all appearance of
[1:57:27] evil, and the very God of peace, think
[1:57:30] of this, abstain from the appearance of
[1:57:33] evil. Now let's modify that. And the
[1:57:35] very God of peace sanctify you holy. And
[1:57:38] I pray God your whole spirit, soul, and
[1:57:40] body be preserved blameless under the
[1:57:42] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:57:44] Faithful is he that calleth you, who
[1:57:46] also will do it.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; How is it that we abstain from all
[1:57:50] appearance of evil? We pray that God
[1:57:52] would preserve blameless spirit, soul,
[1:57:55] and body.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Faithful is he that called you. Holy is
[1:57:59] he that called you, but faithful is he
[1:58:00] that has called you. Who will do what?
[1:58:02] do a sanctification, a preservation
[1:58:05] process of spirit, soul, and body so
[1:58:08] that you abstain and withhold an image
[1:58:10] that mars the beautiful image of God.
[1:58:14] Abstain, it's restraint to hold yourself
[1:58:16] back from appearing wicked. I know we
[1:58:19] like to think it solely means abstain
[1:58:21] from the appearance of evil where we're
[1:58:22] always turning our heads, but it
[1:58:23] actually means you should restrain
[1:58:25] yourself from appearing evil. or it has
[1:58:27] that meaning
[1:58:29] as he says in chapter 3:13 to the end he
[1:58:31] may establish your hearts unblameable
[1:58:33] notice again the language of the perfect
[1:58:35] sacrifice unblameable and holiness
[1:58:37] before God
[1:58:39] chapter 4:7 for God hath not called us
[1:58:41] unto uncleanness but unto holiness as
[1:58:44] God's dwelling place
[1:58:47] we could say as a as his dwelling as
[1:58:50] kings or the temple as priest as a
[1:58:53] sacrifice as this image and all these
[1:58:54] ways that we could present ourselves we
[1:58:56] are to put away abominations.
[1:59:01] He says, "Be ye separate and touch not
[1:59:02] the unclean thing and I will receive
[1:59:04] you."
[1:59:07] My final
[1:59:09] my final new scripture. I got one more I
[1:59:11] think I'm going to use, but 2
[1:59:12] Corinthians 7:1. Musicians, feel free to
[1:59:14] come to your positions.
[1:59:17] Having therefore these pre promises,
[1:59:19] dearly beloved,
[1:59:21] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[1:59:22] filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
[1:59:24] perfecting holiness and the fear of God
[1:59:30] to bring holiness to its completion
[1:59:34] to accomplish the objective of holiness.
[1:59:38] There's certain moral purity and modesty
[1:59:41] and purpose and intent carried on the
[1:59:43] course of righteousness in holiness
[1:59:45] continually. That's why we ought to live
[1:59:48] soberly and righteously and godly in
[1:59:49] this present world. That there's this
[1:59:52] cleansing process from un impure things
[1:59:55] and unclean habits. There's this putting
[1:59:57] away again of abominations
[1:59:59] in order to perfect holiness.
[2:00:04] I want to emphasize this again.
[2:00:06] fulfilling the goal of holiness.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; The goal of holiness is not holiness in
[2:00:11] and of itself.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; That if we were to dress modestly, check
[2:00:15] check the box, it's been accomplished.
[2:00:17] But then we realize that modesty is the
[2:00:18] adorment of a meek and humble and quiet
[2:00:20] spirit before the Lord.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Which before God is of what? Great
[2:00:24] price.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, because he values that
[2:00:27] so much, he hates something that is the
[2:00:29] opposite or that mars that kind of
[2:00:32] character.
[2:00:33] So there is a purpose to holiness.
[2:00:37] Holiness we could say is that
[2:00:39] characteristic of being set apart for
[2:00:41] God in order to reflect his perfect
[2:00:44] character. Holiness is being set apart
[2:00:46] for God that your lives as young men or
[2:00:49] young ladies, wherever you might be, you
[2:00:51] can reflect the character of God.
[2:00:54] Therefore, as we pursue holiness, as we
[2:00:56] ought to desire to pursue beauty,
[2:01:00] God's work
[2:01:02] is unveiled.
[2:01:05] And he puts you on view.
[2:01:08] His work is unveiled. It's made known in
[2:01:11] in your life. Your life then becomes the
[2:01:13] work of God. There's this sacred
[2:01:15] symmetry and beauty to your life, but
[2:01:18] you know the work that gets you there.
[2:01:22] So the Bible says in Psalms 25:4, this
[2:01:25] should be our prayer today. Show me thy
[2:01:27] paths, O Lord.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Show me thy ways, O Lord.
[2:01:31] Teach me thy paths.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I do not want to just know the
[2:01:35] destination
[2:01:37] a so that I can ascribe certain
[2:01:40] attributes to where I am presently with
[2:01:42] those those amenities and those things.
[2:01:44] Lord, I I I know where we're going. I
[2:01:46] know what your goal and your objective
[2:01:48] is. I can see in your word of God that
[2:01:49] there be should true beauty, that men
[2:01:51] ought to have character, that there
[2:01:52] should be absinence from the world.
[2:01:54] There should be an applying of the
[2:01:55] token. So many different things that
[2:01:56] could come to view in the sanctification
[2:01:58] of the way we dress, the way we uh
[2:02:00] present our hair, the way we talk, the
[2:02:02] jokes we tell, the things we consume.
[2:02:04] All these different things we could
[2:02:06] begin to think of and we could see what
[2:02:07] that represents in a very detailed,
[2:02:10] multifaceted way. But we should not
[2:02:13] defeat ourselves by trying to replicate
[2:02:16] each one of those. Because we'll either
[2:02:19] make the mistake of either impersonating
[2:02:20] or exaggerating and overemphasizing one
[2:02:23] part.
[2:02:25] We can say, "Well, Jesus, one thing
[2:02:26] about Jesus is he wept continually. He
[2:02:28] was a man of sorrow." We can say, "All
[2:02:29] right, I can lean into that
[2:02:34] antichrist like
[2:02:36] because I just exaggerate one
[2:02:37] principle." But instead of feeling that
[2:02:40] I've got to achieve beauty for the sake
[2:02:43] of beauty itself, I want intrinsic
[2:02:45] beauty.
[2:02:47] I want to know the work of God. I want
[2:02:50] to know how he works.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; I want the back part of God's mind to be
[2:02:54] opened up to me
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; so that when I see when I see what's
[2:02:57] taking shape, I can rest in his work.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Not because I think the final product is
[2:03:02] beautiful, but because the heart of the
[2:03:04] author, the heart of the painter has
[2:03:07] captured my heart
[2:03:09] and I want to follow his ways. Amen.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; The day and age we live in now, there's
[2:03:14] many that can say they know the acts of
[2:03:16] God because he makes them known. But
[2:03:19] unto us, to his bride, he wants to make
[2:03:22] his ways known. Could we stand together
[2:03:24] this afternoon and pray together?
[2:03:28] Our gracious heavenly father, as we turn
[2:03:30] the service over to the pastor, as this
[2:03:33] congregation, I believe there's some
[2:03:34] baptisms that are forthcoming and as it
[2:03:36] lifts lifts up its voice and beautiful
[2:03:38] praise. As each one of these musicians
[2:03:41] are at their post playing skillfully as
[2:03:43] unto you, I pray that the
[2:03:47] breadth of the things that we have
[2:03:48] shared today could find depth.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. I realize Lord it's very simple and
[2:03:55] I I think for myself very focused yet
[2:03:57] with great breath but Lord
[2:04:00] I I if I have not gone deep enough if I
[2:04:03] have not been diligent enough I pray
[2:04:05] that the Holy Spirit could come now and
[2:04:07] give depth
[2:04:09] that it could dig deep and find that
[2:04:10] place
[2:04:13] may it be deratizing those seeds that
[2:04:14] have been sown and may we recognize that
[2:04:16] there is a work of God that you're
[2:04:18] achieving in our lives the author and
[2:04:20] finisher
[2:04:21] that he who has begun a good work in us
[2:04:23] is just and faithful to finish it. That
[2:04:26] holiness is not itself the end all, but
[2:04:28] there is a purpose and intent to
[2:04:30] holiness. That the perfecting of
[2:04:32] holiness is to allow
[2:04:35] this nature of holiness to fulfill its
[2:04:38] purpose.
[2:04:40] Oh Lord, make our paths plain so that
[2:04:42] they that are lame, those that are halt,
[2:04:44] those that are hurting could see that
[2:04:46] there's a plain path and can walk in it.
[2:04:49] If we make straight the paths of our
[2:04:51] feet, Paul said, "It's so that they that
[2:04:53] are wondering can be healed."
[2:04:56] Lord, let us not vary from this standard
[2:04:58] of holiness that we have been given. Let
[2:05:00] us not trivialize it. Let us not call it
[2:05:02] foolishness, but Lord, may we seek to
[2:05:04] understand it. May it not be imposed by
[2:05:07] legalism or prescripted by law, but
[2:05:10] rather Lord, may we find the spirit of
[2:05:12] holiness deep within our souls that
[2:05:14] compels us to constantly yield to you as
[2:05:18] a member of righteousness. Lord, as the
[2:05:20] poet in this hour said, "Let my life
[2:05:23] song sing to you." And Lord, I do not
[2:05:25] want there to be these inappropriate
[2:05:27] tunes and textures and tones, but Lord,
[2:05:30] may my heart have symmetry with your
[2:05:32] word of God. May the divine proportion
[2:05:34] be manifested in each one of us as to
[2:05:36] what we're called to. May we preserve
[2:05:38] the distinctions among genders that you
[2:05:41] have beautified, that you find pleasing,
[2:05:43] and that you love.
[2:05:46] And Lord, I pray that you bless your
[2:05:47] people today with this singular focus.
[2:05:49] Have I approached this word? If there be
[2:05:50] a need of healing today, I believe you
[2:05:52] are a healer. If they're in need of
[2:05:54] deliverance, I believe that you are a
[2:05:55] deliverer. If someone came today
[2:05:57] brokenhearted and they needed a word
[2:06:00] that would speak to that anxiety about
[2:06:02] the fear of this relationship, Lord, I
[2:06:04] pray now you'd make yourself known to
[2:06:06] them that they could recognize that
[2:06:08] there's an answer in even those things
[2:06:10] which are preached today that can be
[2:06:12] applied to whatever it is they're facing
[2:06:14] today. Whether we fear of the prospects
[2:06:17] financially, whether we fear the
[2:06:19] prospects emotionally or physically,
[2:06:21] whether we are struggling with poor
[2:06:22] health or the devil is whispering
[2:06:24] seekers to us that things that were in
[2:06:26] the past are now presenting themselves
[2:06:28] yet again. We believe God that you're
[2:06:30] present with us and we rebuke any spirit
[2:06:32] of the devil any form of that that is uh
[2:06:36] evil favored in anything that would mar
[2:06:39] the image
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; of your word. We rebuke in the name of
[2:06:42] the Lord Jesus Christ. And may the
[2:06:44] believer accept it now upon the basis
[2:06:46] that you said so. And may we trust you
[2:06:49] more, Lord. Trust you for all that you
[2:06:52] have for us. I ask this in the name of
[2:06:54] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God
[2:06:58] bless you all.
[2:07:08] And I'm going to pray.
[2:07:12] Oh Lord,
[2:07:14] you're beautiful.
[2:07:20] Your face
[2:07:23] is all
[2:07:25] I see.
[2:07:29] For when
[2:07:31] your eyes
[2:07:34] are on this child,
[2:07:38] your grace,
[2:07:41] hallelujah,
[2:07:42] in me. Sing it one more time. Oh Lord,
[2:07:47] oh Lord,
[2:07:49] how beautiful.
[2:07:54] Thank you Lord. Your face
[2:07:58] is all
[2:08:00] I see.
[2:08:04] For when
[2:08:07] your eyes
[2:08:09] are all this child,
[2:08:14] grace
[2:08:16] abounds
[2:08:18] in me.
[2:08:20] I say praise the Lord to the word of God
[2:08:22] this morning that's blessed our hearts
[2:08:25] and may it be our prayer
[2:08:28] that the scripture that he read show me
[2:08:31] thy ways oh Lord and teach me thy paths
[2:08:35] the Lord's interest entering us into
[2:08:37] some things here I've never in my life
[2:08:39] my whole Christian journey in this
[2:08:41] message seen how the Lord has been
[2:08:43] speaking even the last few months to us
[2:08:45] to enter us into something that's beyond
[2:08:48] just the optics behind Han just
[2:08:50] gravitating towards looking right on the
[2:08:53] outside. Today we have answers of the
[2:08:56] reasons why God spoke things even for
[2:08:58] dress. We got to know the reason why. We
[2:09:01] got to know the heart of God. Some of
[2:09:03] the young people will probably be um I
[2:09:07] wonder if they were saying, "Oh, that's
[2:09:08] what we talked about in the youth
[2:09:09] meeting. The last couple youth meetings,
[2:09:11] we talked about a few of these things."
[2:09:12] things. And when I was at brother
[2:09:13] Aaron's in February, um I visited a
[2:09:16] Wednesday night service where he was
[2:09:18] speaking and he talked a little bit
[2:09:20] about the clothing in this way and the
[2:09:22] approach this way. And I said to him
[2:09:24] after I said, "We'd love to hear that
[2:09:25] back." So he touched a little bit on it
[2:09:26] today, but looking at it through the
[2:09:28] eyes of God's character, God's ways, the
[2:09:31] reasons why. And in the uh Old Testament
[2:09:35] as we've been speaking in the youth
[2:09:36] beings and just sharing one another's
[2:09:38] hearts about all the laws and all the
[2:09:40] things God gave and I was just trying to
[2:09:43] show the young people that we have to
[2:09:45] catch the desire and the heart of God.
[2:09:48] And when we do something when we catch
[2:09:50] his desire and we do it because God
[2:09:53] desires it that's the right reason to do
[2:09:55] it.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; A commandment even that word gets a bad
[2:09:58] connotation. Do it. Just do it. God said
[2:10:01] do it. Just do it. and you do it out of
[2:10:03] duty. That's respectful. That's nice.
[2:10:05] And if you're in this message and you
[2:10:07] follow the message because of that, God
[2:10:09] bless you. Praise the Lord. But I'm
[2:10:10] telling you, we have to come to knowing
[2:10:12] the mind and heart and desire of our
[2:10:15] Lord.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; And that's why we do it. I gave a funny
[2:10:19] example uh to the youth. I'll give it
[2:10:21] before you. Hopefully, you won't. And by
[2:10:22] the way, let me correct. I never gave
[2:10:24] him an hour of restraint this morning.
[2:10:26] He made all that up, by the way. I never
[2:10:28] did. I don't like to restrain anybody.
[2:10:30] And how many enjoy this word today?
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; But I told one of the young men, I said,
[2:10:35] "Now, if you if I come to you, I don't
[2:10:37] know who's one of these guys at the
[2:10:38] youth meeting." Ben, it might have been
[2:10:39] Ben. And uh how many appreciate these
[2:10:42] young guys on the front row here? These
[2:10:44] are I appreciate them. Such a hunger for
[2:10:47] the word of God.
[2:10:49] It's the front row brothers, not the
[2:10:52] backstreet boys. The front row brothers,
[2:10:54] right? Amen. But you know, I said to uh
[2:10:58] I think it was Ben, I said, 'If if if I
[2:11:00] came to you and said, I I want you to do
[2:11:03] something and I want you to do it every
[2:11:04] time you come to church, and that's I
[2:11:06] want you to stand on your head and bark
[2:11:08] like a dog three times. Matter of fact,
[2:11:10] don't just do it at church. Do it three
[2:11:12] times a day. Stand on your head, bark
[2:11:14] like a dog. And Ben would go out and
[2:11:16] he's probably very confused about this
[2:11:19] commandment. He doesn't understand why
[2:11:21] I'm asking for this. Ben may go and do
[2:11:24] that because out of his respect for me
[2:11:26] as a pastor and as a man of God, I don't
[2:11:28] know, he may go do it and you may see
[2:11:30] him doing that. But what if he never had
[2:11:33] me say that to him and he uh heard
[2:11:36] through a friend of mine that I just in
[2:11:38] passing said, I said, "You know, I'd
[2:11:41] really like you know what I'd like I'd
[2:11:44] like to see the young people standing on
[2:11:47] their head and barking three times a
[2:11:48] day. really just I love to see that if
[2:11:50] we could just grow into a youth group
[2:11:53] that stands on their head and barks
[2:11:55] three times a day and I just expressed
[2:11:57] this to a friend. Well, Ben finds out
[2:12:00] through the grapevine talking to that
[2:12:01] friend. He found out it was my desire. I
[2:12:04] never told him to do it, but he found
[2:12:06] out that's the desire of his heart. And
[2:12:09] I show up at church and Ben comes down
[2:12:12] to the front, which Ben would never do
[2:12:13] this, but Ben comes down and he stands
[2:12:17] on his head in front of the
[2:12:18] congregation, barks three times. And I'm
[2:12:21] It's It's moving my heart because I
[2:12:23] never told him to do that. He heard the
[2:12:27] inspiration and desire in my heart. And
[2:12:29] it moves my heart because this young man
[2:12:32] is doing it because of my desire. I
[2:12:34] said, "You know what? There was warriors
[2:12:36] around David one day that was fighting
[2:12:38] for him. And when he desired a drink
[2:12:42] from the well of Bethlehem, there was no
[2:12:46] commandment.
[2:12:48] They took their swords. He said, "Oh,
[2:12:51] I'm so thirsty. I'd love to have a drink
[2:12:53] from that." And they fought through 25
[2:12:55] miles of the enemy to bring him back a
[2:12:58] drink. And brother Bram says the least
[2:13:01] of his desires was a commandment to
[2:13:04] them.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; We have got to grow deeper. Can you say
[2:13:08] amen
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; in this word? It's it's the we've
[2:13:14] preached it for years. This message has
[2:13:16] revealed the mind of Christ and the back
[2:13:18] part of God's mind. Well, let me see
[2:13:20] some of the character of the Lord Jesus.
[2:13:23] Let me see some of the maturity. Can you
[2:13:25] say amen? Let me see the beauty. Worship
[2:13:29] the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
[2:13:32] Notice it's not just holiness but the
[2:13:34] beauty of holiness. There's a beauty of
[2:13:37] Christ's desire that he wants to express
[2:13:40] where in his people. How many just raise
[2:13:43] your hand? That's the beauty that I want
[2:13:45] to manifest. The distinctions and
[2:13:47] genders and all that. You can have
[2:13:49] arguments, but you see once you catch
[2:13:50] the mind of God and what he's saying,
[2:13:52] what he's trying to do. And I love how
[2:13:54] he said it. You find out what you have
[2:13:56] the contrast and why God hates it. It's
[2:13:59] because you find out what he loves and
[2:14:00] you're doing naturally what he loves,
[2:14:03] what he desires because you recognize
[2:14:06] that's the reason he hates that because
[2:14:08] this is what he loves. How many want to
[2:14:10] know what God loves?
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I'd like to sing that
[2:14:14] song, A Heart Like Yours, before we go.
[2:14:16] And we do have a couple of young people
[2:14:18] that want to be bapti baptized this
[2:14:20] morning. We have uh my little nephew
[2:14:25] uh
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Israel wants to be baptized in Jesus
[2:14:29] name. And we have
[2:14:34] Sophie talked to her a couple weeks ago
[2:14:37] and and each of these children feeling
[2:14:40] led of the Lord to take baptism this
[2:14:42] morning. So we'll go right from here as
[2:14:45] we pray and dismiss, sing this song and
[2:14:47] we'll go and watch them be baptized in
[2:14:49] Jesus name. We appreciate this great
[2:14:51] word this morning and look forward to
[2:14:53] the service tonight at 5:00 uh the
[2:14:56] directed to the young people, but you're
[2:14:57] certainly all welcome to come. Praise
[2:14:59] the Lord. Let's think about this now.
[2:15:02] Give us that song if you have. A heart
[2:15:05] like yours
[2:15:08] is my desire.
[2:15:13] A heart like yours
[2:15:16] is what I'm searching for.
[2:15:22] Full of compassion.
[2:15:27] Nothing wrong with it.
[2:15:30] Oh, please hear me, Lord. Give me a
[2:15:35] heart like. Sing it one more time before
[2:15:38] we pray.
[2:15:40] A heart like yours. That's our desire.
[2:15:43] Lord
[2:15:44] is my desire.
[2:15:48] Let me understand your ways.
[2:15:51] Let me understand your heart.
[2:15:55] For
[2:15:57] oh full of compassion,
[2:16:02] nothing wrong with you.
[2:16:07] Please hear me Lord. Give me your heart.
[2:16:13] Let's pray if we can together. God bless
[2:16:16] you all. And I would just say this.
[2:16:18] Maybe it's time. I wonder if it's time
[2:16:22] for some of you to offer your heart back
[2:16:25] to God in a rededication to him. Maybe
[2:16:28] years ago you dedicated your life. I
[2:16:31] don't think you should wait. If God's
[2:16:32] already been slowly wooing your heart,
[2:16:35] you should rede rededicate your life to
[2:16:38] our Lord Jesus this morning. You see his
[2:16:41] heart, I believe you'd be pulled to do
[2:16:43] that. He loves you this morning.
[2:16:46] He made a perfect sac come and made a
[2:16:50] perfect sacrifice for all of our sin. So
[2:16:53] I ask you to consider coming forward
[2:16:56] praying together. I'll pray with you as
[2:16:58] you rededicate your life to Jesus
[2:17:00] Christ. you consider that heavenly
[2:17:02] father, we're
[2:17:05] thank you, Lord, from the depths of our
[2:17:07] heart. Never in my Christian journey,
[2:17:09] Lord, have I heard your heart like this,
[2:17:13] the reasons why, and all of it, Lord, is
[2:17:16] a conclusion of such love beyond
[2:17:20] comprehension. We can't comprehend how
[2:17:22] much you love us. Lord, to be able to go
[2:17:25] back even in the Old Testament and read
[2:17:27] it. And if we look carnally, we think
[2:17:30] it's just a God trying to make our life
[2:17:32] more inconvenient. Now, when I look at
[2:17:35] it, Lord, every word is so important to
[2:17:37] me. Every word is valued. Lord, let us
[2:17:40] be a people. Let us be a young people
[2:17:42] that if it's important to you, then it's
[2:17:45] important to us. That's how I want to
[2:17:48] live, Lord. And I see your love. Even
[2:17:51] all those scriptures, Lord, we think,
[2:17:52] "Oh my, there's so many things." But
[2:17:54] Lord, I see your love expressed to us
[2:17:57] and I want to know your heart. Bless
[2:17:59] each one that's come. Someone today
[2:18:01] rededicating their life to you. Lord,
[2:18:03] just receive them. I pray. May they go
[2:18:05] on to know you in deeper ways. We pray
[2:18:08] and we commit the service and these
[2:18:09] baptisms coming up. We commit it to you
[2:18:11] now. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:13] Christ, we ask it. Amen. God bless you.
[2:18:16] Shake hands with one another. Greet one
[2:18:18] another as you're dismissed this
[2:18:20] morning. If you need prayer, please come
[2:18:22] forward. We wouldn't rush that. And just
[2:18:24] in a few minutes, maybe uh 10 minutes or
[2:18:27] so, we'll have the baptism in the back.
[2:18:29] Praise the Lord. Give me that first
[2:18:30] verse. God bless you all in Christian
[2:18:33] love this morning.
[2:18:35] Amen. Singing it. Oh,
[2:18:38] I try to reach out for you, but I fall.
[2:18:47] Sometimes you feel so close and yet so
[2:18:52] far.
[2:18:55] Oh, I need another chance.
[2:19:01] I need to know your mercy.
[2:19:05] Lord, please give me strength to change
[2:19:09] within.
[2:19:12] Oh, a heart like yours. Yes, Lord.
[2:19:17] It's my desire.
[2:19:21] A heart like yours
[2:19:25] is what I'm thirsting for.
[2:19:31] Full of compassion.
[2:19:35] Nothing wrong with it.
[2:19:38] Oh, please hear me, Lord. Give me a
[2:19:43] heart like yours.
[2:19:48] I know that I'm not all that I can be.
[2:19:54] Think about it now.
[2:19:58] My weakness seems to get the best
[2:20:04] of me.
[2:20:06] But as long as you are here,
[2:20:11] I know that I can make it every step
[2:20:16] along the way. Please hear my prayer.
[2:20:22] Oh, a heart like yours
[2:20:28] is my desire.
[2:20:30] Yes, Lord. Oh, a heart like yours
[2:20:35] is what I've been thirsting for.
[2:20:41] Full of compassion.
[2:20:46] Nothing wrong with it. That's our
[2:20:48] desire, Lord. Oh, please hear me, Lord.
[2:20:52] Give me a heart like a Lord. Listen to
[2:20:57] this now. So much love, so much grace,
[2:21:03] so much kindness,
[2:21:07] so much faith.
[2:21:11] Oh, ever true.
[2:21:16] As strong as the wind,
[2:21:20] as soft as the shadows.
[2:21:25] live just once.
[2:21:28] I could be like you.
[2:21:32] Oh, a heart like yours. Grant it, Lord.
[2:21:37] Please, Lord. Please, Father. Grant it,
[2:21:40] Lord.
[2:21:42] A heart like yours. I need you, Lord.
[2:21:49] I need you, Lord.
[2:21:51] Oh love, come take me to that quiet
[2:21:54] place with you. That secret place that
[2:21:56] you love.
[2:21:59] Oh, please hear me, Lord. Give me a
[2:22:03] heart like so much love. Oh, so much
[2:22:09] grace,
[2:22:13] so much kind.
[2:22:18] So much pain
[2:22:21] ever
[2:22:23] true.
[2:22:26] Strong as the wind,
[2:22:29] as soft as the shadows.
[2:22:35] If just one,
[2:22:38] I could be like you.
[2:22:42] Oh, a heart like yours.
[2:22:47] is my desire.
[2:22:52] A heart like yours
[2:22:55] is what I'm thirsting for.
[2:23:01] Full of compassion,
[2:23:04] Lord,
[2:23:09] true holiness.
[2:23:12] Give me your heart.
[2:23:17] Thank you, Lord.
[2:23:24] Take me deeper,
[2:23:28] deeper in love
[2:23:31] with you.
[2:23:34] Jesus, hold me close to your embrace.
[2:23:42] Take me deeper,
[2:23:46] deeper than I've ever been before.
[2:23:52] Love you more and more.
[2:23:55] How I long
[2:23:58] to be deeper
[2:24:00] in love.
