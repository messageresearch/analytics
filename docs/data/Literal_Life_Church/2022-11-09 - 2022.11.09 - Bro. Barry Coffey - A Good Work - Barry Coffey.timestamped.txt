[0:02] I was just thinking I was listening all
[0:03] these events and all these things going
[0:05] on I was saying to myself I'm going to
[0:07] move here
[0:08] and then I found out we had to pay 500
[0:10] for you for a banquet I thought
[0:13] I'll stay where I am

[1:06] little text tonight and I will tell you
[1:08] I don't want to Preamble very much at
[1:09] all thank you musicians I appreciate
[1:11] that and the atmosphere that's set so I
[1:14] just want to jump right in if that's
[1:16] okay brother Paul asked me to say a
[1:18] couple of words about Ukraine and I we
[1:19] may have a a little clip here to show
[1:22] you but uh let's begin in Philippians
[1:25] chapter 1 just while you're standing
[1:27] here verse 3 we'll start there I thank
[1:30] my God upon every remembrance of you
[1:32] always in every prayer of mine for you
[1:35] all making requests with joy
[1:37] for your fellowship in the gospel from
[1:39] the first day until now
[1:42] being confident of this very thing
[1:45] that he which has begun a good work in
[1:47] you will perform it until the day of
[1:50] Jesus Christ
[1:51] He's Able isn't he
[1:53] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[1:55] opportunity we have to be able to come
[1:57] in your presence tonight and to be able
[1:59] to study your word Lord in peace and in
[2:02] the sanctuary sanctity of this assembly
[2:05] Lord this evening and to be able to uh
[2:08] just Lord step out of the way and let
[2:10] you speak to our hearts and father I
[2:13] know how you have dealt with me and Lord
[2:15] I just pray tonight that you would just
[2:17] take me as a vessel and a microphone
[2:20] Lord and just speak to the hearts of
[2:21] your people as you have spoken to me
[2:23] already and I ask now Lord that you
[2:26] would just take complete control forgive
[2:28] us of anything Lord that would hinder
[2:30] the moving of the Holy Spirit and Lord
[2:32] me when we leave here we are able to say
[2:35] it's been good for us to be in your
[2:37] house with your people father have your
[2:39] way Among Us now we pray in Jesus lovely
[2:42] name
[2:42] amen and amen you may be seated this
[2:45] evening
[2:48] there are lots of different things that
[2:50] are being said about Ukraine and Russia
[2:52] and so forth over the over the airwaves
[2:54] some of it is true we had one of the
[2:57] folks in our assembly who was just over
[2:58] there in Ukraine serving uh they're in
[3:01] the medical capacity and uh I will tell
[3:04] you that uh you know we hear about uh
[3:07] statements about the Russian forces
[3:09] retreating back from different places in
[3:11] Ukraine the shock is is that when the
[3:14] ukrainians go back into those areas
[3:16] where the Russians had control they
[3:18] generally find nothing there there's
[3:22] hardly anything that they recognize in
[3:24] relation to their Villages and their
[3:25] towns or homes sometimes they'll find
[3:28] foundations there but there's much of it
[3:30] that is absolutely totally
[3:31] unrecognizable many of them who left
[3:34] left with only their possessions closed
[3:37] on their back maybe a bag of clothes a
[3:39] couple of important documents and and
[3:41] left in a hurry because there was bombs
[3:43] in the air and uh when they come back
[3:46] there's absolutely nothing there so it's
[3:48] a really sad scenario
[3:50] and there are many many stories but I
[3:53] thought you know sometimes a picture's
[3:55] worth a thousand words and the video
[3:56] clips are worth about ten thousand so I
[3:59] thought I'd just show you if you can
[4:00] click to the next one now I don't have
[4:01] my here it is
[4:03] now I I'm not sure we can play this well
[4:06] let's just try
[4:07] this can we get sound device
[4:25] [Music]
[4:32] was
[4:34] if you want if we can play it again if
[4:36] you got sound
[4:40] oh
[4:41] let's go back
[5:10] anyway and not letting the circumstances
[5:13] affect them and uh they're just a very
[5:17] hardy people and I will tell you that
[5:19] they really do appreciate every cent
[5:21] that's sent over we still continue to do
[5:24] that we have to trickle funds over uh
[5:27] just a little at a time so we do not
[5:28] raise any Flags over there and the money
[5:31] reaches those those families there and
[5:34] they they every now and then and then
[5:36] when they can they send back little
[5:37] video clips that acknowledge the fact
[5:39] that they've received the funds we have
[5:41] the names and addresses and phone
[5:43] numbers of everybody who's received
[5:45] anything and from people over here and
[5:48] we have a wonderful team of brothers
[5:50] that uh supernaturally when all the
[5:55] banking systems are down and all the
[5:57] other governmental workers come to a
[5:59] halt there practically no medical
[6:01] facilities of any kind and yet these
[6:04] team of Three Brothers in different
[6:06] parts of the world they're able to get
[6:07] money into the
[6:09] country there through cryptocurrency and
[6:12] through wiring and through different
[6:13] telephone apps that they use uh it's
[6:16] just incredible how they do it and uh
[6:18] we're able to supply those brothers and
[6:20] those Brothers Supply those families
[6:21] over there so there's about uh we
[6:24] believe around 400 450 individuals over
[6:27] there about 130 families that are still
[6:30] in that area and uh let me tell you they
[6:33] uh they really have to work hard to be
[6:36] able to get basic necessities medicines
[6:39] and food and so forth there was a
[6:42] brother over there and I don't have a
[6:43] picture of it but he was undergoing
[6:46] chemotherapy for cancer that was all on
[6:49] the side of his face it was a large
[6:51] tumor that had grown out and he was
[6:53] taking therapy before the war started
[6:55] once the war started the government took
[6:57] over all the hospitals for the war
[7:00] effort and so he couldn't take any more
[7:03] uh any more chemotherapy treatments at
[7:05] all and had no money to do with that and
[7:07] as a result of that you know he was left
[7:10] uh you know to his own resources and uh
[7:14] the brothers over there the sisters and
[7:15] when it was safe they came out on the
[7:17] cover of night got together laid hands
[7:19] on that brother and he's still with us
[7:22] and we're very thankful for that so uh
[7:25] it's uh it's just a wonderful uh you
[7:29] know group of people to help and to work
[7:31] with and we're very thankful for all the
[7:34] support and funds that have been given
[7:38] all right now I want to tell you this
[7:39] that
[7:40] um
[7:41] I had it on my heart to come and brother
[7:44] Paul and I were in contact and uh the
[7:46] Lord laid it on my heart to come and uh
[7:49] just figured I would probably be here on
[7:51] a Wednesday night and had something that
[7:54] I was going to speak about and then two
[7:56] nights ago uh around four o'clock in the
[7:58] morning it was the night of the eclipse
[8:00] whenever that was
[8:01] um the Lord I believe stirred me and I
[8:04] was I woke up and I was just go all of a
[8:07] sudden going through these scriptures
[8:08] and things that I'd never ministered on
[8:10] before I never I never saw I never
[8:12] thought about and uh I thought to myself
[8:14] well I'll wait until the eclipse starts
[8:17] and then I'll get up and I'll look for
[8:18] those scriptures in the Bible and uh lo
[8:21] and behold just as the eclipse started I
[8:23] fell back to sleep so I never got to see
[8:24] the eclipse but I did remember the
[8:26] scriptures and uh so I'm going to jump
[8:29] right in and this is Wednesday night so
[8:30] it's all right if it's all right take
[8:32] your Bible we're going to look in some
[8:33] scriptures here and I realize you know
[8:36] that there are many ways to talk about
[8:38] the scripture and many ways to go at it
[8:40] my way some ways sometimes is a little
[8:42] bit different I think really what's
[8:45] important is that we may not all be
[8:47] preaching the same way but what is
[8:49] important is that we're all preaching
[8:50] the same thing and we have the same
[8:52] motive in preaching and that is to
[8:53] prepare a people for the change of our
[8:56] bodies so that you know we can make it
[8:57] into the kingdom and that's what's
[8:59] important the way we preach is really
[9:01] incidental as long as God will take the
[9:04] vessel and use the message that's what's
[9:06] important
[9:07] now uh the flip the book of Philippians
[9:10] here is a book that I've started to
[9:12] study and I begin to minister on but I
[9:14] haven't been able to get past the first
[9:15] 11 verses here it's one of the positive
[9:17] books that Paul writes it's written
[9:19] after a second journey and he really
[9:22] encourages the people uh in their own
[9:25] personal experience and their own
[9:26] personal walk with God there's no
[9:28] mention here much of ministry there's no
[9:30] mention a church order no mention here
[9:31] of gifts and prophecy hardly he's really
[9:34] encouraging the people to become aware
[9:36] not so much of the circumstances around
[9:39] you but what God is doing within you he
[9:42] wants them to understand that he wants
[9:44] them to realize that the most important
[9:45] thing is not what's happening around but
[9:47] what's happening within and so he's uh
[9:51] he's dealing with the uh you know with
[9:53] the Believers in this personal way and
[9:55] he's encouraging them uh in in the way
[9:57] that only Paul can now as we as we look
[10:01] at this and I wanted to read just a
[10:03] couple of scriptures for you there's a
[10:04] really powerful word that's embedded in
[10:06] here and that is the word perform where
[10:09] Paul says that uh being confident that
[10:11] this very thing that he has he that
[10:13] began the good work will perform it and
[10:16] that word perform it's found in various
[10:18] places in the Bible very specific and it
[10:21] means to bring something to it end it's
[10:24] not going to be stopped along the way
[10:26] but it's going to be completed it speaks
[10:29] of accomplishing something that is tied
[10:32] to the original purpose so what's going
[10:34] to be done is going to be exactly what
[10:36] God had in mind that's the idea and not
[10:40] only is it uh is it pre-planned but he's
[10:43] on hand to execute that he's he's on
[10:46] hand to make sure that that happens and
[10:49] he's got it just like we often say he's
[10:51] got a will for you he's got a plan and a
[10:53] purpose for you you wouldn't be here
[10:55] don't tell me that God doesn't have a
[10:56] sense of humor hey he left us here for
[10:58] the very end right all the great people
[11:00] and Believers and saints that went
[11:02] before us but God chose you and I to be
[11:04] here in the last of the last to bring it
[11:06] across the Finish Line don't tell me God
[11:08] doesn't have a sense of humor and yet he
[11:12] promises us and this is what Paul is
[11:13] telling the Believers there that you
[11:15] need to be confident of this thing you
[11:17] need to believe in this and hang on to
[11:19] this because God's going to shake your
[11:21] world and you need to hang on to this
[11:23] very fact that if God began it in you
[11:25] he's going to execute it he's going to
[11:27] see it all the way through he's going to
[11:29] bring it to pass he's going to he's
[11:30] going to complete it it's going to be
[11:32] done exactly the way that God intended
[11:34] and nothing's going to be left out
[11:36] nothing's going to be missing do you
[11:37] believe that
[11:38] and and that's that's how he's
[11:40] encouraging the people now how God does
[11:43] that is a really interesting story
[11:45] because how God deals with all of you is
[11:49] unique and interesting it's specific to
[11:51] you it's very personal and what God is
[11:53] doing in your life and how God is
[11:55] dealing with you uh those things are are
[11:57] really really uh really really important
[12:00] uh in the accomplishment of God's
[12:02] purpose in your life and so this word
[12:05] perform if I could expand on it just a
[12:07] little bit more and say that uh just
[12:10] like uh in the Old Testament in Jeremiah
[12:13] chapter 29 you remember that story where
[12:15] Jeremiah tells the people he says you're
[12:17] going to be down there for 70 years and
[12:20] in in the appointed time he says I will
[12:24] perform my my word uh concerning you I
[12:27] will perform my thought concerning you
[12:29] and we find the same Hebrew word uh
[12:31] basically and and it literally means
[12:33] this that the word can lay dormant for a
[12:36] long time I've spoken it but it doesn't
[12:38] necessarily come to pass exactly when I
[12:40] speak it but when the time comes I'm
[12:42] going to breathe into it and when I
[12:44] breathe into it man it's going to happen
[12:46] there's going to be something go on
[12:48] during that time and and you need you
[12:50] need to be ready during that time at 70
[12:52] years and I'm giving you the warning in
[12:53] advance because when God sets this word
[12:56] on fire and God breathes into it you
[12:58] better be ready to go because it's going
[13:00] to happen
[13:01] and I'm gonna I'm gonna bring it to life
[13:03] in the same way that Martin Luther or
[13:05] sorry in the same way that Malachi 4
[13:07] laid there for hundreds and thousands of
[13:10] years and uh nothing nothing can make
[13:13] that happen until God's time but when
[13:15] God's time comes man we're all we're all
[13:18] very sure of what Malachi 4 means aren't
[13:21] we
[13:21] there are other people in other ages who
[13:23] believe that that might have applied to
[13:25] them like Martin Luther Martin Luther I
[13:27] read in a book where he said I believe
[13:29] that may be a description of my Ministry
[13:31] to turn the hearts of the children back
[13:33] to the faith of the fathers well that
[13:35] made sense to a Catholic especially if
[13:37] you were living in the season of the
[13:39] Reformation but it was not for Martin
[13:41] Luther he could know it but he could not
[13:43] make it live but when God made it live
[13:46] in the 1900s let me tell you it leaves
[13:49] no doubt as to what that verse actually
[13:50] means god brings it to pass God executed
[13:53] it God completed it how many believe
[13:55] that God completed what he wanted to
[13:57] complete in brother Brown's Ministry
[13:58] it's not listen we're not waiting around
[14:00] for somebody to come along and finish
[14:02] that we're not waiting around for
[14:03] somebody to come along and put finishing
[14:05] touches on brother braham's Ministry we
[14:07] don't need to go in and edit those
[14:09] sermons let me tell you rapturing Faith
[14:11] lays in that everything God wanted
[14:12] wanted him to say I believe he said and
[14:15] everything that God wanted us to have I
[14:17] believe we have
[14:18] and we're still printing it and sending
[14:19] it out all over the world and uh it
[14:21] still works I believe the message is
[14:22] true God knew exactly what he was doing
[14:24] he didn't make any mistakes
[14:27] and all the controversy Hunters you know
[14:29] they're still out there hunting but you
[14:31] know what God's bride still moves right
[14:32] on God's bride still presses on because
[14:35] you know what we believe hey we believe
[14:38] this is God's word now let me tell you
[14:40] something it was a brother who uh uh oh
[14:43] well I'll just say this I heard a
[14:44] minister he was in Jeffersonville uh
[14:47] there and and he made a really profound
[14:49] statement uh one time a little while ago
[14:51] and I I'll just I'll just leave this
[14:53] with you as we go on but he he said that
[14:56] uh you know a lot of people he said they
[14:58] uh they stop at that Prophet they stop
[15:01] at brother Branham and and he said they
[15:04] really limit themselves when they do
[15:05] that and he said but I'll tell you what
[15:07] brother Branham did for me he said
[15:09] brother random led me to Christ and once
[15:11] I got to Christ he said you know what
[15:13] everything was okay he said I could look
[15:15] back when in Christ looking through
[15:17] those glasses he said I could look back
[15:19] and see all of humankind and realize
[15:22] that you know what we're all capable of
[15:23] mistakes we're all capable of doing and
[15:26] saying and feeling things wrong and
[15:28] interpreting things wrong he said you
[15:29] know what and we're all human and God
[15:31] made us that way but he said but what
[15:33] brother Branham did and the most
[15:35] significant thing that brother Brandon
[15:36] did was to bring me to Christ and once I
[15:39] was in Christ he said there was a
[15:40] security there and a permanence there
[15:42] and a peace there that you never get by
[15:45] following some man and he said I'm
[15:46] thankful for the ministry of brother
[15:48] Branham for doing that and I thought
[15:49] that was just a nice way of saying that
[15:51] now it's really interesting I don't know
[15:54] how we got here uh in my church but uh
[15:57] there is a sister in our church who had
[16:00] some connection with the Chinese culture
[16:02] and she was explaining to me and gave me
[16:05] a document about how the ancient Chinese
[16:08] people made their words and their words
[16:11] are obviously made of pictures and
[16:14] symbols that mean very little to us
[16:16] until you go to a Chinese restaurant and
[16:18] they they are very meaningful to Chinese
[16:20] people and so she gave me an example of
[16:24] this and I I use this at home that the
[16:26] word for lamb is the first symbol on the
[16:30] on your left the the word for me is this
[16:34] symbol over on the right when you put
[16:37] two of these symbols together you come
[16:39] up with another word that seemingly
[16:41] would be unrelated
[16:43] righteousness
[16:45] now look at the construction of
[16:46] righteousness the lamb is on the top I'm
[16:49] on the bottom
[16:51] so in other words when God looks down at
[16:53] me he sees the lamb first
[16:56] they're in that position I am righteous
[16:59] before him does that make sense
[17:02] Hey listen that's only the example
[17:05] let me give you another one and this is
[17:07] what I want to get to that in our lives
[17:10] we have opportunities to do things and
[17:13] we have uh you know there there are lots
[17:15] of experiences that come our way I found
[17:18] this interesting that the word crisis is
[17:21] made up again of two symbols right here
[17:23] and the first one is danger that's the
[17:27] symbol on the top and the bottom one is
[17:30] opportunity
[17:32] so when you take danger and opportunity
[17:35] it it is it is a crisis but a crisis
[17:40] really affords us very often an
[17:43] opportunity to change
[17:45] isn't that right pain is a great teacher
[17:49] and and it is one of the best teachers
[17:52] actually and so when Crisis occur in our
[17:55] lives and we should not begrudge uh you
[17:59] know the the path of life that brings us
[18:01] to a place of Crisis because very often
[18:03] those are the things that drive us to
[18:05] the Cross they drive us back to God
[18:08] and they're a crises that really are
[18:11] wake-up calls and they are nothing but
[18:12] good for us in our lives
[18:14] it's really interesting we have a couple
[18:16] of Neighbors in our uh live right next
[18:19] door to us and our young couple uh real
[18:22] nice people but they're not churchgoers
[18:24] at all have no connection with the
[18:25] church every Sunday they're home uh you
[18:28] know they're just they're just good
[18:30] normal type people who uh happen to live
[18:33] next door to us and a couple of months
[18:35] ago uh the the lady of the house she was
[18:38] expecting she's about 38 years old
[18:40] somewhere around there 40 years old
[18:41] somewhere I would guess and they already
[18:44] had one child and she was expecting her
[18:46] second child 28 weeks along and all of a
[18:49] sudden uh one day she knew something
[18:52] happened and that child died in her womb
[18:55] and she was devastated I mean there was
[18:58] no the doctors never gave her reason as
[19:00] to why that happened but uh you know it
[19:02] uh it was it was Final and uh you know
[19:06] she had to go through all of the
[19:08] processes when something like that
[19:09] happens and uh they they uh they asked
[19:13] me they because we were helping them and
[19:16] we were you know kind of putting our
[19:17] arms around them and doing what we could
[19:19] and and uh trying to be comforting and
[19:21] supportive of them uh because of what
[19:23] their what you know what a crush that
[19:25] was and um they asked me if I would
[19:28] speak at the funeral they said we want
[19:30] to give it a regular funeral and
[19:32] coffin's this big and uh you know David
[19:35] I took a a quote a section out of Psalms
[19:38] where David said my life is as a hand
[19:40] breath and hand breath is this distance
[19:42] from from the end of your thumb to the
[19:44] end of your pinky and I said that's
[19:46] probably the size of this little uh
[19:49] child Clover who had passed away and I
[19:51] said you know David said that that's our
[19:53] life that's he said in terms of the
[19:56] comparison with eternity he said that's
[19:58] kind of how how long it really is and I
[20:02] had the chance to be able to go to the
[20:04] Grave sign there was just the three of
[20:05] us there and uh they sat in the chairs
[20:08] and I pulled up a chair and sat down and
[20:10] talked to them about uh you know life
[20:12] and how God is the author of life and
[20:14] there's things that we don't always
[20:16] understand and all the things that were
[20:18] said and they were they were really uh
[20:20] comforted by that they told me and and
[20:22] uh you know they were they were happy
[20:24] with that and you know sometimes you
[20:25] don't realize the impression that you're
[20:27] making on people and then today us
[20:29] preparing for service and I had a a text
[20:31] from him the husband and and he said are
[20:34] you home and I said no I'm not home I'm
[20:36] in I'm at Brother Paul's oh you know and
[20:38] everybody knows where Brother Paul's is
[20:39] and he said
[20:42] he said well I don't want to interrupt
[20:43] your vacation I said back when you come
[20:46] to brother Paul you're never really on
[20:47] vacation you're always working
[20:49] and I said uh I said what what's
[20:52] happening and he said well he said I
[20:54] just had a situation happen at work and
[20:55] he said I'll probably lose my job and he
[20:58] said we're really concerned about it and
[21:00] you know it's kind of been a year of bad
[21:02] news for them and he's he said now these
[21:04] are people that don't believe in God at
[21:06] all and he said I just wanted to ask you
[21:08] if it'd be all right he said if he would
[21:09] pray for me
[21:11] and all I'm saying to you is this is
[21:13] that you know a crisis happens and
[21:16] sometimes we think oh it's just a bad
[21:18] day or I'm having bad luck or something
[21:20] else that really can be an opportunity
[21:22] for something really good to happen
[21:25] so you're better off not shaking your
[21:27] fist at God but rather just to to
[21:29] realize that there's probably something
[21:31] I can learn through the crises that
[21:33] happen in my life
[21:34] and we should not turn our back from
[21:37] turn our back on them now
[21:40] Peter says and I just want to give you
[21:44] some principles here tonight and we'll
[21:46] we'll move into an area that I've never
[21:47] spoken about before and in second Peter
[21:50] chapter three Peter says this is all
[21:52] familiar to you the Lord is not slack
[21:54] concerning his promise as some men count
[21:56] slowness and that's what that Greek word
[21:58] means there uh that people would say
[22:00] well God is slow doing things you know I
[22:02] mean uh brother Branham talked about
[22:04] 1977 and then every 2000 years something
[22:07] happened well you know God's kind of
[22:08] slow well you should not count God slow
[22:12] because that's not the way that God
[22:14] operates but he's long-suffering to us
[22:16] word not willing that any should perish
[22:18] but that all should come to repentance
[22:21] and this idea that uh you know without
[22:24] understanding if you're looking at
[22:26] sometimes you're looking at the timeline
[22:27] of God it's not always clear exactly
[22:29] what God's doing and it can appear like
[22:31] God is doing nothing During certain
[22:34] seasons and I want to tell you here
[22:36] tonight I don't believe that that's true
[22:37] I don't believe there's ever a time when
[22:39] God's doing nothing God is always doing
[22:41] something in our lives God's always
[22:43] doing something in the world
[22:44] now in the church age book hold on to
[22:46] that thought brother Brandon says now we
[22:48] come to the last stage in the laodicean
[22:50] age he said this is our age and we know
[22:52] it is the last stage of the uh because
[22:55] the Jews are back in Palestine and this
[22:56] is Harvest Time and he said but before
[22:59] there can be a harvest
[23:01] there has to be a ripening
[23:04] a maturing
[23:06] of everything
[23:08] both the vines
[23:10] right
[23:11] it's got to come and this is what that
[23:13] word means there it's got to come to
[23:15] full development if you look up the word
[23:17] uh ripening it means that it's got to
[23:19] come to full development now I was using
[23:22] this illustration I'm not going to use
[23:23] it tonight the way I did in my own
[23:25] church but uh for instance uh how many
[23:28] of you young people are here tonight
[23:30] that are not 25 years old yet but have
[23:33] your driver's license
[23:35] huh
[23:37] let me I got a little bit of news for
[23:38] you you may not appreciate this but I
[23:40] got I got to tell you this that nobody
[23:43] really wants you to drive
[23:45] there ain't nobody who wants you to
[23:47] drive I'll guarantee you that your
[23:48] mothers don't want you to drive because
[23:50] they worry every time you pull out of
[23:52] the driveway even if they don't say
[23:54] anything they're worried anyway because
[23:55] that's what mothers do
[23:57] I will tell you something else that your
[23:59] pastor doesn't want you to drive and be
[24:00] rolling around that parking lot out
[24:02] there the state troopers don't want you
[24:04] to drive
[24:06] uh the judges in this community don't
[24:08] want you to drive uh they know they know
[24:11] something about you before you turn 25
[24:13] and that is that your brain is not fully
[24:16] developed
[24:17] insurance companies will change the rate
[24:19] of your insurance when you turn 25 if
[24:21] you're single now they'll change it
[24:23] earlier if you get married because the
[24:24] insurance companies will turn it over to
[24:26] your wife to get your brain to grow up
[24:29] but if if you're single your insurance
[24:33] rate stays High until you're 25. not
[24:36] because you're stupid but because you
[24:39] haven't come to full development yet
[24:41] so you figure that hey it's all right if
[24:44] I go backwards on the interstate or it's
[24:46] okay if I drive at 80 miles an hour and
[24:48] use the phone oh somebody's texting me
[24:50] at the same time there's a there's a
[24:53] lack of full development it's not it's
[24:55] not that there's no development it's
[24:56] just that it's not full development yet
[24:58] so we got to wait until that happens all
[25:01] right we got to wait until this this
[25:03] whole process is complete and that's the
[25:06] idea that we're trying to convey tonight
[25:07] before there can be a harvest there has
[25:09] to be a completion of the process there
[25:12] has to be a full execution of the whole
[25:14] uh maturing process here of both of
[25:17] these Vines that's what brother Bam's
[25:19] telling us all right now we find that in
[25:22] show us the father brother bam said now
[25:23] Jesus said the word was a seed and the
[25:26] seed that the sower sowed now he says
[25:28] now you people out here in Oregon you
[25:29] don't have to go out every morning and
[25:31] dig up the plan he says you plant a crop
[25:34] of corn every morning to go out and dig
[25:35] it up and look at it and say what's in
[25:37] that I don't see a thing going on it'll
[25:39] never grow if you do that you have to
[25:42] commit It To The Ground you have to
[25:43] commit it and let it grow he says don't
[25:45] dig it up you've got to commit It To The
[25:47] Ground that's the place for it and every
[25:49] time you dig it up you delay it
[25:52] when you get involved in that process
[25:55] you can delay the whole thing so
[25:57] therefore the nature itself tells you
[26:00] that there are seasons where something
[26:02] is physically happening or you're
[26:04] involved in doing something but then
[26:05] there are seasons where the work in a
[26:07] sense is not always visible but is still
[26:09] going on it's getting you to where you
[26:12] need to be right and you may not even be
[26:14] fully aware of that you might you might
[26:16] react to that kind of differently but in
[26:19] God's plan God is always in the process
[26:21] of getting you somewhere he's always
[26:23] bringing you to something and that
[26:25] something is something better something
[26:27] higher something more uh more profound
[26:29] and more perfect God is doing that and
[26:31] he's moving the bride towards the
[26:33] kingdom how many would agree he's moving
[26:35] things back to the way that they should
[26:38] be and so this is the principle that
[26:40] brother Brandon was telling us about
[26:41] here that uh you you can actually get
[26:44] involved in this process and delay it if
[26:46] you're not careful now let me give you
[26:48] an example here you remember when
[26:49] brother Branham uh prophesied and said
[26:52] I'm going to have a son son and he said
[26:54] that son's name is going to be Joseph
[26:55] remember that that story and then uh
[26:58] here's brother Branham in 1955 and he's
[27:01] in his own church and he's saying this
[27:03] to the people some some things said uh
[27:06] you're going to have a boy and you'll
[27:07] call his name Joseph and about a month
[27:08] after that we found out uh we were
[27:10] pregnant and this was Sarah Branham who
[27:13] came and uh brother bam said it was a
[27:15] Josephine well immediately immediately
[27:18] as he says here uh some people said so
[27:21] many thought that I said that that was
[27:23] Joseph and I said no no I didn't say
[27:24] that was Joseph some said didn't you see
[27:27] a vision of this he said you know how
[27:29] people get things mixed up and I said I
[27:31] got tapes on it listen now he's telling
[27:33] this to his own church sounds like he's
[27:35] under defensive here and he said I never
[27:37] said it was Joseph the Lord put it on my
[27:39] heart that I'm going to have a son by
[27:40] the name of Joseph I don't know how I
[27:42] don't know when
[27:43] but there's obviously a space of time
[27:45] here now God gave us a daughter and
[27:48] we're thankful for the daughter but uh
[27:50] let me tell you what was going on behind
[27:52] the scenes here that you may not know
[27:53] there was a fellow who was in the church
[27:55] at that time in Branham Tabernacle who
[27:57] made it a point to get on the phone and
[27:59] call everybody in the church and say
[28:02] brother Branham said there was going to
[28:03] be a boy brother Brandon told us that
[28:05] was going to be a boy and cause that
[28:07] unrest among the people there and that's
[28:10] why he had to get up several times and
[28:12] say things like this because he said you
[28:14] want to listen to him go back on the
[28:16] tapes find out what I said he said I'm
[28:18] going to have a son and this was because
[28:20] that there was a person in there and
[28:23] here's what I want you to understand I
[28:24] want you to get a hold of this that in
[28:27] the season where there's a delay the
[28:29] enemy goes right to work
[28:30] whenever there's a delay and it looks
[28:33] like something is not happening here or
[28:36] you know it's not visible at least the
[28:38] enemy jumps right in and causes upset
[28:41] right in the middle of that delay
[28:43] he always does
[28:46] and we can take a lot of time and look
[28:47] in different scriptures here here's one
[28:49] Luke chapter eight this is a story where
[28:51] Jesus is on one side over in Israel and
[28:54] it says that they get into the ship with
[28:56] his disciples and he went over and they
[28:58] launched the boat and as they sailed he
[29:00] fell asleep
[29:01] and what brother random told us here is
[29:04] that he's actually resting between
[29:06] revivals because he gets over on the
[29:08] other side to gadera and there's a great
[29:10] miracle that takes place over there
[29:12] right a great great thing that happens
[29:14] over there and if you look at the
[29:16] previous parts of Luke chapter eight all
[29:18] the Miracles take place over on this
[29:20] side and then he leaves that Revival
[29:22] gets in the boat goes over on the other
[29:23] side but he takes a risk during that
[29:25] time here's brother bam said he was
[29:27] resting between revivals well you know
[29:30] what happens during the delay the enemy
[29:32] comes right in and causes a storm right
[29:34] then he arose and rebuked the wind and
[29:37] the Raging in the water and they ceased
[29:39] and there was a calm I will tell you
[29:41] that whenever you get into a space like
[29:42] that the enemy comes in and tries to
[29:45] cause some sort of an upset that
[29:47] nobody's expecting but all of a sudden
[29:48] he's right there
[29:50] are we okay
[29:54] Awakening Jesus I'm going somewhere with
[29:56] this and he said and these disciples
[29:58] were doing the same thing they were
[29:59] rejoicing and living on what they had
[30:02] done probably the day before the week
[30:04] before the year before and they were
[30:05] testifying about and giving a testimony
[30:07] of it and he says and how do we know
[30:10] that as Jesus in the in their day was
[30:13] resting between revivals how do we know
[30:15] maybe he's resting now between the
[30:17] revivals
[30:19] Now understand it doesn't mean that
[30:21] there's nothing happening
[30:23] but I will tell you it's a season or an
[30:25] opportunity for the enemy to come in and
[30:28] cause upset
[30:31] because we're here and it seems like you
[30:34] know you may be sitting there thinking
[30:35] well God's God's certainly pretty slow
[30:37] at getting the bride all together and uh
[30:39] you know it's Wednesday night again here
[30:41] we are 2022. who knew we'd be here in
[30:43] 2022 right we're still having to deal
[30:45] with elections and still having to I
[30:47] mean you know goodness you wonder how
[30:49] long we're going to be here you know
[30:51] people are everyone's praying that we
[30:53] get out of here except for the young
[30:54] people who are not married yet they kind
[30:55] of want to hang on just a little bit
[30:57] longer just a shade longer right
[31:01] but for the rest of us we're all ready
[31:03] to go and
[31:05] when you get into that season of delay
[31:09] let me tell you something the enemy
[31:11] moves right in very quickly and moves in
[31:14] very subtly
[31:17] you remember Esther
[31:19] right you remember Esther and you know
[31:22] she's she's in there and uh you know
[31:25] preparing meals for the king and all the
[31:28] rest of it well while all of that's
[31:30] going on there and this law has been
[31:33] passed nothing's happening at the moment
[31:35] here but Haman comes in and he's trying
[31:38] to cause a stir but let's just go a
[31:40] little bit further here because I want
[31:41] to deal with this little part here you
[31:43] know the story of Esther and you've
[31:45] you've been taught that uh regularly but
[31:49] this is the the scripture the the
[31:51] beginning of the story here in chapter
[31:53] two and it says that the maiden Esther
[31:57] pleased him and she obtained kindness of
[31:59] him and he speedily gave her things for
[32:02] purification so this is the the head
[32:04] honcho who was preparing these women for
[32:07] uh possible marriage to the King right
[32:09] you know the story and she finds favor
[32:12] with him and he's giving her everything
[32:15] that she needs and uh she's given seven
[32:18] maidens and they were meat to be given
[32:20] to her out of the King's house and he
[32:22] preferred her and her Maids unto the
[32:25] best place of the House of the women
[32:28] now what's interesting is that it says
[32:31] that uh Esther had not showed her people
[32:33] nor her Kindred she never revealed her
[32:37] genealogy that she was a Jew
[32:40] for Mordecai had charged her that she
[32:42] should not do it and every day every day
[32:45] Mordecai walked every day before the
[32:48] court of the women's house to know how
[32:49] Esther did
[32:51] and what should become of her
[32:54] now I want to tell you that this is not
[32:56] an overnight process every day he walks
[32:57] past the palace and he's trying to look
[32:59] in he's got his phone ready and Casey
[33:01] sees her and he's going to snap a
[33:03] picture of her and send it back to the
[33:04] folks and every day he's just kind of
[33:06] looking to see and you know how long he
[33:08] does that
[33:09] he does that for over a year
[33:13] because that's how long it took for them
[33:15] to go through the process of
[33:16] purification
[33:19] I want you to think about this now
[33:20] nothing happens here Esther's she's
[33:22] bathing she's preparing she's going
[33:25] through the rituals that they have here
[33:27] and she's got seven maidens to help her
[33:29] out but this is a long process before
[33:32] she actually gets to go in and see the
[33:34] king nothing's going on here let's
[33:36] finish the verses here and now when
[33:38] every maid's turn must come to go into
[33:39] king of hazarus after she had been 12
[33:42] months
[33:44] according to the manner of women look at
[33:47] that after she had been 12 months
[33:49] according to the manner of women for so
[33:52] were the days of purification
[33:54] accomplished to it six months with oil
[33:55] and murder six months sweet odors and so
[33:57] forth this is the way that the women
[33:59] were purified
[34:01] I wondered about why it took so long
[34:03] because I mean she's going through this
[34:05] process here and to us it just looks
[34:07] like a bunch of perfume I mean that's a
[34:09] lot of stuff right that's a lot of myrrh
[34:10] a lot of sweet odors and everything else
[34:12] and when I went back and saw that that
[34:16] verse 12 again she had been there 12
[34:18] months according to the manner of women
[34:20] I will tell you something that if a
[34:23] woman Waits 12 months before going into
[34:25] the king
[34:27] we can be certain as to whether she's
[34:29] received the seed of another man
[34:34] after the manner of women
[34:37] so we know that if she becomes expecting
[34:41] it's got to be the king now
[34:45] because she's sat there for 12 months
[34:48] into delay and nothing's happened
[34:52] if she had received seed from another
[34:56] man guess what it's going to show up
[34:58] within 12 months
[35:00] no fooling this process
[35:03] so God uses the delay to manifest things
[35:10] God uses the delay for his own purpose
[35:13] to bring out things that activity does
[35:17] not bring out does that make sense
[35:20] wow I was so happy when I saw that
[35:23] because I will tell you something you
[35:26] may sit there again you may sit there
[35:28] and think well until tonight that you
[35:30] know not much has happened you know not
[35:31] much is going on and so forth I will
[35:33] tell you this that God God has a purpose
[35:36] in all of it and God will let things go
[35:39] on to manifest what's in the heart of
[35:41] every believer in this world today
[35:44] to find out whether you're going to stay
[35:45] true to the word or what are you going
[35:47] to run after this or run after that or
[35:49] whether you've actually received the
[35:51] seed of another teaching or another
[35:53] movement hello
[35:56] because you know what give it a couple
[35:58] of years we're going to find out where
[35:59] everybody stands but you know what with
[36:01] the bride at the end of the delay
[36:03] doesn't matter how long at the end of
[36:05] the delay the bride is still standing
[36:06] there saying I'm so glad I can say I'm
[36:09] one of them and they believe the word
[36:11] they're just waiting for the uh for that
[36:13] uh you know taking away of the Bride
[36:15] they talk about the Rapture they talk
[36:16] about the change of the body and you
[36:18] know what things come things go things
[36:19] come things go and they've got one thing
[36:22] on their mind I gotta stay with the word
[36:23] I gotta stay with the word I gotta stay
[36:25] with the word I gotta stay pure I gotta
[36:27] stay purified I got to go through this
[36:29] process doesn't matter how long delay
[36:31] doesn't bother me because if I'm a Child
[36:33] of God it's only going to manifest more
[36:35] of the character of Christ than me
[36:37] they're not afraid of delay they're not
[36:38] worried about delay matter of fact you
[36:40] know bring it on that's their attitude
[36:42] Bring It On
[36:45] delay is a good thing
[36:47] if you're pure delay is a good thing
[36:50] because if you've received a seed of
[36:52] somebody else it's going to manifest
[36:54] itself and sometimes it doesn't take 12
[36:55] months let me give you an example here
[36:57] Exodus chapter 32 remember where Moses
[37:00] is he's on top of the mountain and God
[37:03] is writing out Commandments on the
[37:04] stones and when Moses comes down God
[37:07] says you better get down because I'll
[37:08] blow the whole thing wide open Moses
[37:10] goes down and he said what did this
[37:12] people do to you and that was brought so
[37:14] great a sin upon them you know the story
[37:16] they had made a golden calf right
[37:20] because you know what you can take the
[37:22] boy out of Egypt but you can't always
[37:24] take Egypt out of the boy
[37:27] I said you can take the boy out of Egypt
[37:29] but you can't always take Egypt out of
[37:30] the boy and they still have the seeds of
[37:33] their former way of worship in them and
[37:35] it went right back to it in the delay
[37:37] because they said you know what Moses is
[37:40] not coming back my goodness he's been up
[37:41] there that long and they said uh you
[37:44] know I mean he's probably never coming
[37:45] back so you know they're in the delay
[37:47] and they're kind of thinking well my
[37:49] goodness what's happening nothing
[37:50] happening and Aaron we ought to make
[37:52] something happen here and they put their
[37:54] put all their metal together and they
[37:57] made themselves a golden calf and Aaron
[37:59] says hey it wasn't me it was the people
[38:01] people forced me to do it
[38:03] and Moses stood in the gate of the camp
[38:06] and he said who's on the Lord's Side
[38:07] come unto me
[38:09] the delay manifests everything
[38:14] can I go a little further
[38:18] now
[38:21] what's really interesting
[38:24] what's really interesting here is that
[38:27] there are all kinds of things about the
[38:30] message that
[38:32] we really still haven't seen
[38:34] there's we know that God is the author
[38:37] of Revelation isn't he and he's the one
[38:39] that knows how to reveal things in
[38:41] season and we Hey listen it's just like
[38:44] the Bible we've we've had the Bible
[38:46] since Martin Luther's time
[38:49] and
[38:50] the Bible's everywhere there's there's
[38:52] all kinds of versions of the Bible
[38:54] bibles are everywhere
[38:56] I mean you can't check into a hotel room
[38:58] but there's one in your room there right
[39:00] I mean bibles are everywhere
[39:02] but I will say this and I'll be willing
[39:05] to say this for most of you that you
[39:06] never really understood what was in the
[39:08] Bible until God opened your eyes to what
[39:10] was in there he always had it but you
[39:12] never really saw it like you see it now
[39:15] and it's no different with the message
[39:17] God is the author of Revelation and
[39:20] Jesus even thank God he said I thank God
[39:22] that these things are hidden from the
[39:24] wise and prudent but revealing the babes
[39:25] such as would learn and you know what
[39:27] we're still learning things about the
[39:29] message we're still learning things
[39:30] about the Bible isn't that right we
[39:32] probably didn't know that about Esther
[39:33] Queen Esther there and you know I mean
[39:35] it's just that and don't give me don't
[39:37] give me credit for that hey that's him
[39:39] and uh it's kind of like you know the
[39:44] well let me let me say it this way
[39:47] it's important for ministers to
[39:49] surrender and submit to God so that he
[39:50] can give us things for you but really at
[39:53] the end of the day it's his grace that
[39:55] he wants to bring things to you to help
[39:57] you right
[40:00] and I I realize my position I'm a
[40:03] carrier not a source
[40:10] but you know what when that woman in the
[40:12] days of Jesus when she knelt before
[40:15] Jesus in Simon's house remember and
[40:17] poured the oil over his feet and washed
[40:20] and and rubbed his feet and took her
[40:23] hair and rubbed his feet
[40:25] you know what she was a she was a
[40:27] carrier she was doing something and
[40:28] Jesus even said we want you to remember
[40:30] this wherever the gospels preach we want
[40:32] you to remember what this woman did but
[40:34] when she left the house she smelled just
[40:36] like Jesus did
[40:39] because what she gave out some of it got
[40:41] on her as well it's in her hair it's on
[40:43] her hands and you know she he she's
[40:45] carrying a little bit of that because
[40:47] she was obedient to what God told her to
[40:49] do and even if you're a carrier there's
[40:51] some of that stuff that gets on you and
[40:53] I'll tell you what I'm thankful for that
[40:55] I'm I'm thankful for the blessing of
[40:58] being able to minister to God's people
[41:02] but I'll say this that you know when
[41:04] Revelation comes it comes because God's
[41:07] open your eyes and God there's a season
[41:08] where God's reveal things to you and I
[41:10] was talking about this and somebody said
[41:12] to me well it's just like the arrow on
[41:13] the FedEx logo
[41:16] really
[41:18] there's an arrow in the FedEx logo
[41:23] do you know there's an arrow in the
[41:24] FedEx or are you just saying that you're
[41:26] just saying that because
[41:28] okay all right he knows
[41:31] and then one day I got a I got a shot of
[41:34] the
[41:36] I got a shot of this logo
[41:39] and I realized there's an arrow in there
[41:42] and they made that logo with that arrow
[41:44] pointing right because that's the right
[41:45] way to ship something
[41:47] that's why they put that Arrow there
[41:50] everybody see the arrow
[41:52] let's be honest how many of you don't
[41:53] need to show your hands but how many of
[41:54] you never knew there was an arrow in
[41:56] there before
[41:57] but you know what
[41:58] how how many times have you seen the
[42:00] FedEx truck roll up to your house and
[42:02] rolling down the street we've looked at
[42:04] it all the time but it takes somebody
[42:05] who's who who knows it's there to point
[42:08] that out to you even though you've had
[42:10] it with you all all the years that
[42:11] you've lived in North America
[42:14] hey that's really not any different than
[42:16] how God deals with us because there are
[42:19] things that are laying in the word of
[42:20] God that are Mysteries that God any
[42:22] season he reveals those things to us and
[42:24] it's not because we are worthy but
[42:26] because God loves you and God places a
[42:28] Ministry to be able to bring those
[42:29] things out and we all have a role and a
[42:31] purpose in doing that and there are
[42:33] there are things that we see and I'll
[42:34] guarantee you that whenever you go down
[42:36] the road now and you look and see the
[42:37] FedEx truck that's all you're going to
[42:39] see is the arrow
[42:40] every time you see one you're going to
[42:42] be looking at that and realizing wow
[42:44] that's that's there it really is there
[42:48] all right now let's be specific for a
[42:51] few minutes here that's all right
[42:54] I think I mentioned this to you before
[42:55] when I was here last
[42:57] and by the way
[42:59] now
[43:00] we're two to nothing
[43:03] just saying
[43:08] job
[43:10] is a book that's unusual to me it's
[43:13] unusual I don't mean that
[43:14] disrespectfully but there are things
[43:16] about the book of job that I don't fully
[43:18] understand and it's the oldest book and
[43:22] there's lots of great truths that are in
[43:24] there this is one that puzzled me for a
[43:26] long time and forgive me if I've said
[43:28] this to you before but just to refresh
[43:30] your memory and I just want you to take
[43:31] note of how God deals with us because
[43:34] remember now as I said to you already
[43:36] that it is it is God who's going to
[43:39] perform the work it's God who's going to
[43:42] bring it to completion isn't that right
[43:43] even when you feel like quitting and
[43:45] even when you feel like giving up and I
[43:47] want to say this to you that just
[43:49] because you're a Believer it doesn't
[43:50] mean that you always automatically have
[43:52] to feel right right and be right
[43:55] it's okay to not feel okay I said it's
[43:58] okay not to feel okay because there are
[44:01] lots of things going on around us that
[44:03] can be discouraging and can cause you to
[44:06] be anxious and cause you to wonder about
[44:08] things and you know what you're human
[44:10] and you're gonna have to blame God for
[44:12] that he made you that way
[44:14] but I will tell you that you know there
[44:16] are things happen there are things that
[44:17] you counted on that didn't turn out the
[44:19] way you thought dreams you had that
[44:21] didn't come to pass ministers that
[44:23] didn't really didn't really they didn't
[44:26] really get it
[44:28] and church situations and health
[44:31] situations married situations children
[44:34] situations all of us are subject to
[44:36] those things
[44:37] and there are things that happen to us
[44:39] that you know in in reality there's
[44:42] there's times when If we're honest and
[44:44] we showed our show of hands many of us
[44:46] would probably feel like turning back
[44:48] and just saying hey I'm just going to
[44:50] sit by the sidelines until I can make
[44:52] sense out of this and just back away for
[44:54] a little while and I'm not saying that
[44:56] that's a good thing for all of us to
[44:58] feel but in reality we probably all do
[45:00] at different times well I want you to
[45:02] know this that your Eternal Destiny was
[45:04] never put in your hands the way for you
[45:07] to get from here to there was never
[45:09] given to you he said I'll be with you
[45:11] and I'll be in you and I'll I'll I'll
[45:12] bring you to my house I've got a place
[45:15] prepared for you and I I'm going to come
[45:16] and receive you unto myself that where I
[45:18] am there you may be also
[45:20] and any and he said that I know how to
[45:22] get you there I know the way to my own
[45:24] house and I'll get you there so let me
[45:26] tell you he he never he never gave us in
[45:28] my and I've looked at my job description
[45:30] a lot of times as a Christian a minister
[45:31] and I've never found on there where God
[45:33] said you need to find that place
[45:37] you need to get there he doesn't say
[45:39] that
[45:40] he says you need to submit you need to
[45:42] obey you need to open your heart and
[45:44] mind and let me guide you and let me be
[45:46] that continual presence in your life and
[45:49] let me let you get to get there I
[45:50] remember one time brother Charlie Cox he
[45:53] had a conversation with brother Brandon
[45:54] and uh you know he as a young Christian
[45:57] he always wanted to have the experience
[45:59] of the baptism of the holy spirit that
[46:01] was a big thing for him he really wanted
[46:03] to have that and he said he would get
[46:05] out by himself in the field and he'd
[46:07] pray and he'd go in the woods and he
[46:09] said I'd have these times where he said
[46:11] it was like all the Angels were around
[46:13] me and they surrounded me and he said I
[46:15] felt that presence and there was other
[46:16] times I didn't feel anything and he said
[46:18] there was times when I was in church and
[46:20] it was like God was right there sitting
[46:21] next to me and he said I just wanted to
[46:24] have baptism of the Holy Spirit he yearn
[46:26] for that finally brother Branham one day
[46:28] comes up to him and he says Hey Brother
[46:29] Charlie he says I understand you've been
[46:31] seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[46:32] and he never told brother Brandon that
[46:34] but he said I understand you've been
[46:35] seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[46:36] and he said yes I have and he said well
[46:39] let me tell you something he said said
[46:40] next time you feel that presence like
[46:43] you have in the past
[46:44] he says just give in to it
[46:46] Just Surrender to it that's all you need
[46:48] to do
[46:50] I thought wow what a great answer
[46:53] because a lot of times we have a
[46:54] preconceived idea about what something's
[46:56] got to be we have a preconceived idea
[46:58] about what God's got to do
[47:00] God does not have to do anything that we
[47:02] think he's got to do God is Sovereign
[47:04] and he does what he wants right
[47:06] we can make a lot of assumptions about
[47:08] things and we can be flat wrong
[47:10] but we can be sincere but we can be flat
[47:13] wrong but you know what you're still
[47:14] wrong
[47:15] it's kind of like the fellow who every
[47:17] day he was a plant foreman and in this
[47:20] little town in England and every day he
[47:22] went past uh the watchmaker shop in the
[47:25] morning first thing in the morning he'd
[47:26] walk past the watchmaker shop pull out
[47:28] his stopwatch and he'd look at the
[47:30] clocks in the window and he would set
[47:32] his clock make sure it was exactly
[47:34] matched with this because he thought my
[47:36] goodness everyone if anyone in town is
[47:38] going to have the right time is going to
[47:39] be the watchmaker right duh so he sets
[47:43] his clock every day when he goes past
[47:45] the watchmaker sets that and he was the
[47:48] guy who blew the horn every day at the
[47:50] factory at noon so right at noon he
[47:51] would blow that that horn and you know
[47:54] what happened at noon every day the
[47:56] watchmaker got in the window and fixed
[47:59] all of his clocks to noon because he
[48:01] figured that that Horn's not going to be
[48:03] wrong
[48:07] if you didn't get that I'll see you
[48:08] after church all right
[48:12] we can make assumptions about things
[48:14] that
[48:18] that nobody sees
[48:21] now remember now God's dedicated to you
[48:23] right because he said and this is what
[48:25] Paul told the Philippians that he that
[48:27] has begun a good work in you
[48:29] he'll complete that work right so God's
[48:32] not quitting somewhere in the middle
[48:35] God is not leaving you because you mess
[48:37] up so often
[48:40] thank God for that
[48:43] but I want you to notice just just as an
[48:45] example here in the days of job his sons
[48:48] went and feasted in their houses every
[48:50] one his day and sinned and called for
[48:53] their three sisters to eat and drink
[48:55] with them I mean we never having a great
[48:57] time
[48:58] and it was so when the days of their
[49:00] feasting were gone about a job sent and
[49:04] Sanctified them
[49:05] and Rose up early in the morning and
[49:08] offered burnt offerings according to the
[49:10] number of them all
[49:11] so there was a bunch of sons there was
[49:13] at least three daughters
[49:15] so he counted out the offerings every
[49:17] day probably so many turtle doves or
[49:19] whatever else and he made those
[49:21] offerings probably seven or eight he
[49:23] made those every day made sure everybody
[49:26] had an offering made for them
[49:29] he offered burnt offerings according to
[49:31] the number of them of them all for job
[49:33] said
[49:34] this is what he's thinking it may be
[49:37] that my sons of sinned
[49:39] and curse God in their hearts
[49:42] this thus did job continually
[49:47] now we have no evidence at all that his
[49:49] son sinned
[49:51] but job is offering an offering early
[49:54] every day for every one of them
[49:57] it says continually for how long we
[49:59] don't know
[50:00] and I began to wonder about that verse
[50:02] and I was looking at it and looking at
[50:04] the Hebrew because I have some help help
[50:05] set help me understand what the actual
[50:08] language of the Biblical Hebrew is and
[50:10] what I found out was something that
[50:12] you'd be able to relate to when I tell
[50:13] you and that is this thing called a
[50:15] spirit of entitlement
[50:18] we don't know that these guys sinned but
[50:21] job was afraid that his children would
[50:25] have a spirit of entitlement
[50:27] that would make them say something like
[50:29] this hey you know what our Dad's job
[50:33] and you know what our house has been
[50:35] blessed for a long time God's done a lot
[50:37] of great things for us and we are
[50:38] essentially I mean we live with the most
[50:41] righteous man on the Earth
[50:42] we've done pretty good in terms of the
[50:44] message of the hour we're kind of on the
[50:46] upper half matter of fact we're pretty
[50:48] close to the top because we're job sons
[50:50] and you know what
[50:52] God's got to bless me because I'm job's
[50:54] son
[50:56] God's gotta God's got to do things for
[50:58] me and you know what I can I can make
[51:00] the edges of the law a little soft here
[51:03] and a little soft there you know why
[51:06] because my dad is job
[51:08] my dad's a prophet my dad's got
[51:10] communion with God and we know that God
[51:12] visits my dad he's got Revelations and
[51:15] he's got he's got a communion with a
[51:17] walk with God so you know what it says
[51:20] they're having a great time
[51:24] they're living they're living the
[51:26] message dream they're going everywhere
[51:28] to camps and they're looking at all the
[51:31] girls and the girls are looking at the
[51:32] boys and you know what we don't need to
[51:34] get too serious with God because you
[51:35] know after all my dad's a prophet so you
[51:38] know if it ever knee we ever need to get
[51:40] serious we can always go to Dad
[51:43] God's got to bless us because we're you
[51:45] know for me and my house we'll serve the
[51:47] Lord
[51:49] and my dad's brother Paul so you know
[51:52] sure should I not have said that
[51:53] oh
[51:57] my dad's brother Barry so you know what
[52:00] I've kind of got a seniority slash
[52:03] immunity slash protection slash a little
[52:06] bit of a LAX code for my sons because
[52:10] they're brother Barry's Sons
[52:12] and you know what that is that's a
[52:14] spirit of entitlement
[52:16] and job is afraid they may have that and
[52:19] that's why he's offering offerings just
[52:21] in case
[52:23] it doesn't say they have sinned but just
[52:25] in case they develop an attitude you
[52:27] know why because your attitude speaks
[52:29] just as loud as your words and your
[52:31] attitude and your your inner thoughts
[52:33] they speak often loud or louder than
[52:36] anything you may say or do
[52:38] are you with me
[52:42] job's not offering offerings for their
[52:44] sins
[52:45] he's offering offerings in case
[52:49] because he knows how God operates he
[52:51] knows how God's laws work
[52:53] he knows that God is a respecter of
[52:55] nobody
[52:59] in the delay
[53:01] everything is manifested
[53:04] I'm just saying
[53:06] can I take this one step further
[53:10] now if you have your Bible I'd like you
[53:12] to go to a place over here in the book
[53:15] of second Samuel
[53:18] second Samuel if you have a Bible
[53:22] if you have a phone you can dial it
[53:31] I think I have the first couple of
[53:32] verses here on the screen but if you
[53:34] don't mind on the screen went away
[53:40] now in second Samuel chapter 11 it
[53:43] starts out and says
[53:49] that this was the season of the battle
[53:52] of the Kings
[53:54] in other words
[53:55] kings were supposed to be out on the
[53:57] battlefield
[53:58] during this season
[54:00] and this is the story of the chapter
[54:02] that deals with David taking Bathsheba
[54:06] just a few minutes longer okay if you'll
[54:08] just give me a couple more minutes here
[54:11] David is supposed to be on that
[54:13] Battleground because he's trained to
[54:15] battle that way that's what David's done
[54:17] all his life he's been trained that way
[54:20] but he exempts himself God does not tell
[54:23] him to avoid the battle he exempts
[54:25] himself
[54:26] and guess what now he's faced with a
[54:28] battle he's not prepared for
[54:31] now he's got a battle of the mind he's
[54:34] got a Temptation here and he's not
[54:36] trained to deal with this
[54:38] he's supposed to be somewhere else
[54:40] because he's trained for that and I
[54:41] would just say this to you that
[54:43] sometimes when God tells you to do
[54:45] something and you say well no I'm not
[54:47] going to do that I'm going to do this
[54:48] over here you can wind up in a
[54:50] battlefield that you're not prepared for
[54:51] at all
[54:52] and you'll run into enemies and you'll
[54:54] run into problems over here that you
[54:56] never counted on because you're not
[54:58] trained for that but if you're in the
[55:00] place where God wants you to be and
[55:01] whether it's a housewife whether it's a
[55:03] wife whether it's a student or whether
[55:05] it's a minister or whatever it is God's
[55:08] trained you and brother man I'm talk to
[55:10] those Full Gospel businessmen you
[55:11] remember that and they were they were
[55:13] successful in business so they figured
[55:15] ah you know what I can go over here and
[55:16] be a minister
[55:19] and they were moving into an area of
[55:21] battle that they were not trained for at
[55:23] all
[55:24] and they preached prosperity and they
[55:25] preach all these other things that had
[55:27] no relation to the gospel at all
[55:32] so then we know the story how David
[55:34] Falls in that Temptation and then he's
[55:37] got all of his bases covered
[55:41] except one
[55:42] that's the vertical one
[55:45] you understand what I'm saying
[55:47] you rise dead buried
[55:49] everybody's kind of gone their own way
[55:51] because the battle's over they're all
[55:53] going back home
[55:54] and David is sitting on the throne
[55:58] Bathsheba is over here just having
[56:00] delivered a child
[56:02] and David thinks you know what God
[56:05] hasn't said a thing to me so this is
[56:06] okay
[56:08] and all of a sudden Nathan shows up
[56:13] and when Nathan comes to David he tells
[56:16] him this story
[56:18] and the story down to verse six years
[56:20] kind of heartbreaking really you know it
[56:23] gives you the
[56:27] doesn't it
[56:28] there were two men in the city one was
[56:30] rich the other poor the rich man had
[56:31] exceeding many flocks and herds but the
[56:33] poor man had nothing
[56:34] save one little lamb which he had bought
[56:37] and nourished up
[56:38] and it grew up together with him and his
[56:41] children and did eat of his meat and
[56:43] drink of his own cup
[56:45] lay in his bosom and was unto him as a
[56:48] daughter
[56:50] and there came a man rich man
[56:53] he speared the take of his own flock and
[56:56] of his own hurt
[56:57] you know what he did
[56:59] he took that little lamb from that man
[57:02] and he dressed it for the wayfaring man
[57:04] it was coming to his house and he took
[57:07] the poor man's lamb and dressed it for
[57:08] that man that was come to it
[57:11] well you know
[57:13] I want to say this that David is capable
[57:15] of seeing the hurt that someone else did
[57:19] but didn't see the hurt that he had
[57:21] caused himself
[57:25] he's capable of judging this correctly
[57:27] because he sees what someone else has
[57:30] done he doesn't know that this is not
[57:32] true he's giving a true judgment here
[57:35] based on the law of what this should
[57:38] happen in a case like this
[57:41] he's capable of feeling compassion for
[57:45] this man and the loss of that little
[57:48] lamb who was like a daughter to him
[57:54] but he can't see what he just did and
[57:56] feel the same way
[58:00] he can't feel
[58:02] what he's just done to Uriah
[58:06] in uriah's family
[58:10] and what he's just committed and all of
[58:13] the associated hurt that goes with that
[58:16] and he's not repenting he's not
[58:19] lamenting that he's not going to God
[58:21] he's not spending time after church in
[58:24] the sanctuary by himself he's not
[58:26] seeking God here he's pretending it
[58:28] didn't happen
[58:31] what is it that's going on in David that
[58:36] he's willing listen that he's willing to
[58:38] risk it all
[58:39] for an affair
[58:43] when he has lived through everything God
[58:47] has done for him to get him to to that
[58:51] throne he's lived through it he knew
[58:54] what it was like to act like a crazy man
[58:56] in front of the Philistines he knew what
[58:57] it was like to be chased by King Saul he
[59:00] knew what it was like to feel the
[59:02] conviction of God he knew what it was
[59:03] like you know to be out there in front
[59:05] of Goliath and trusting God with just a
[59:07] stone in his hand he knew what it was
[59:09] like to depend on God in the fields to
[59:11] kill the bear in the line he knew what
[59:13] it was like
[59:14] they had to deal with the wrath of King
[59:16] Saul who threw a javelin at him he knew
[59:18] what it was like how many times God had
[59:21] spirited his life he knew his origin he
[59:23] knew where he came from what is it in
[59:24] David that's willing to risk it all for
[59:27] this affair with Bathsheba
[59:30] now that's a good question
[59:35] because
[59:36] this is not just
[59:39] this is not just a sin
[59:42] this is a betrayal of a covenant
[59:46] he's a married man
[59:49] and he has
[59:51] he has committed this relationship
[59:54] betrayal now look folks historically if
[59:58] somebody betrayed their relationship
[1:00:00] they generally had a child out of
[1:00:01] wedlock everybody knew that they had
[1:00:04] betrayed their marriage vows right
[1:00:07] but isn't it true today that the lines
[1:00:09] have gotten a lot softer
[1:00:11] because now
[1:00:13] what is a betrayal now is pornography a
[1:00:16] betrayal
[1:00:18] is dating apps on your phone if you're a
[1:00:21] married man or woman is that a betrayal
[1:00:26] is flirting with somebody of betrayal
[1:00:31] should I not have said this
[1:00:35] is looking up your old flames on
[1:00:37] Facebook is that a kind of betrayal
[1:00:42] the boundaries are blurred
[1:00:45] but I will tell you what in every case
[1:00:48] an affair is organized around a secret
[1:00:53] it's always organized around a secret
[1:00:57] because you can't bring it out in the
[1:00:58] open
[1:01:02] and this energy that a person has like
[1:01:04] David this energy for the thing that is
[1:01:07] forbidden
[1:01:09] I will tell you something
[1:01:10] is as powerful as the real thing and it
[1:01:15] drives people to commit things that are
[1:01:17] outside of their boundaries because all
[1:01:20] of a sudden they're feeling something
[1:01:22] that they haven't felt in a while
[1:01:26] now let me tell you something
[1:01:29] and I want you to remember this
[1:01:32] that when an attraction happens like
[1:01:35] this it's not necessarily because you
[1:01:38] want to leave your spouse
[1:01:40] but because you want to leave the person
[1:01:42] you are becoming
[1:01:48] you're really wanting more to leave the
[1:01:51] person you're becoming
[1:01:53] than to leave your spouse
[1:01:59] and when David listen now
[1:02:07] when Nathan goes to David
[1:02:10] he's telling David something very
[1:02:13] personal
[1:02:14] he's he's giving him this example right
[1:02:17] here and he says David look where you've
[1:02:20] come to you've come to the place where
[1:02:22] you can't feel compassion over what
[1:02:25] you're doing but you can feel compassion
[1:02:28] for someone else
[1:02:36] think about this
[1:02:39] and God says to him right in the next
[1:02:42] verse verse 5. if you have it open here
[1:02:44] in the next verse David or sorry David's
[1:02:48] anger sorry I'm I'm in the wrong chapter
[1:02:50] here
[1:02:53] verse 6.
[1:02:55] I'm sorry verse seven the parable is
[1:02:57] over and Nathan says to David Thou Art
[1:02:59] the man thus saith the Lord God of
[1:03:01] Israel I Anointed The King over Israel
[1:03:03] and I delivered thee out of the hand of
[1:03:05] Saul
[1:03:06] and I gave thee to the in thy Master's
[1:03:09] house wives and so forth he says
[1:03:12] wherefore verse 9 thou Hast despised the
[1:03:14] Commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[1:03:16] his sight
[1:03:18] and not only that but he said you
[1:03:19] brought reproach
[1:03:21] against the kingdom of God so that his
[1:03:24] enemies would be able to blaspheme the
[1:03:26] kingdom God's not even able to hold his
[1:03:28] Kings
[1:03:29] with all the blessings that he's
[1:03:31] bestowed upon them
[1:03:33] now therefore he says in verse 10 the
[1:03:35] sword shall never leave the house and
[1:03:37] thus saith the Lord I will raise up evil
[1:03:39] against thee and thy known house and
[1:03:40] David in verse 12 he says to Nathan I
[1:03:43] have sinned against the Lord this was
[1:03:44] different now than King Saul but David
[1:03:46] now when he's confronted with the
[1:03:48] reality of what he's done and how far
[1:03:50] he's gone not overnight but he's gone to
[1:03:54] this place where he's willing to risk
[1:03:56] everything that God has done for him and
[1:03:58] everything that God's given to him
[1:04:00] everything that God's bestowed upon him
[1:04:02] he's willing to risk that
[1:04:05] because he wants to leave the person he
[1:04:08] has become
[1:04:09] and he's become that in a season where
[1:04:12] he doesn't have the fight and the
[1:04:14] pressure in a sense it's kind of like a
[1:04:16] delay season
[1:04:19] and the delay manifests
[1:04:22] everything
[1:04:26] wow
[1:04:29] if a man after God's Own Heart can come
[1:04:31] to the place where he can lose the
[1:04:32] feeling
[1:04:34] for somebody and not acknowledge it and
[1:04:37] not recognize it
[1:04:38] and the hurt he's caused and the
[1:04:41] reproach he's brought to the kingdom and
[1:04:43] he's sitting on the throne like he
[1:04:44] nothing's happened and nothing's gone
[1:04:46] wrong
[1:04:47] and Nathan has to come and bring that to
[1:04:49] him
[1:04:50] and here is David let me tell you
[1:04:52] sometimes a person who's in this place
[1:04:54] like David they're looking at themselves
[1:04:57] and they're looking at their spouse and
[1:04:59] they're saying you know what there's got
[1:05:00] to be something wrong with this
[1:05:01] relationship and there's probably
[1:05:02] something wrong with you and they're
[1:05:04] willing to put the blame on everybody
[1:05:05] else and they're moving away from the
[1:05:08] boundaries that they never thought that
[1:05:10] would cross because they really want
[1:05:12] wanting
[1:05:14] they're really wanting to escape
[1:05:17] who they are becoming
[1:05:23] all I'm saying
[1:05:25] is that I'm glad for Philippians 1 and
[1:05:27] 6.
[1:05:28] where God says through Paul
[1:05:31] you need to be confident of this one
[1:05:33] thing
[1:05:34] that he who hath begun a good work in
[1:05:36] you
[1:05:37] will complete it
[1:05:39] because in your darkest days in your
[1:05:42] times of Temptation in your times when
[1:05:44] things get rough and tight and and it
[1:05:46] seems like nobody cares and you're not
[1:05:48] feeling what you should be feeling and
[1:05:50] you've got other thoughts and you've got
[1:05:51] your head you're up to your eyeballs in
[1:05:53] Temptation let me tell you God is not
[1:05:55] going to let you go halfway through the
[1:05:57] process he's going to execute this he's
[1:05:59] going to bring it right to the end and
[1:06:01] God knows exactly how to pull the rug
[1:06:03] out it's going to turn your world upside
[1:06:04] down he's going to do whatever it takes
[1:06:06] he's going to do what he needs to do
[1:06:08] he's going to make you aware of things
[1:06:10] because you know what he's not way off
[1:06:12] there in a fog he's now in us and will
[1:06:14] be in us and with us until the very end
[1:06:17] that's why Paul is encouraging the
[1:06:18] Philippians and saying he has begun a
[1:06:20] good work he's going to see it through
[1:06:21] all the way to the end aren't you glad
[1:06:23] you got that kind of a holy spirit he's
[1:06:25] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:06:27] if that was true in the early church
[1:06:28] it's still true today and it doesn't
[1:06:30] matter saying to God it doesn't matter
[1:06:31] how long this thing goes I'm glad with
[1:06:34] Christ in me we'll be able to rise over
[1:06:37] every wave in every situation and every
[1:06:39] circumstance because we're not trusting
[1:06:42] in brother Barry and we're not trusting
[1:06:43] in brother Paul and we're certainly not
[1:06:45] trusting in you or you or you let me
[1:06:47] tell you we're trusting in Him to see it
[1:06:49] through to the very end of the way
[1:06:52] let's stand to our feet
[1:06:56] God is good to us
[1:07:02] I'm thankful if our musicians will come
[1:07:04] I'm thankful that we have a God who
[1:07:06] shows mercy and even even in the middle
[1:07:09] of David David's trouble uh you know
[1:07:11] Nathan tells him he says listen he says
[1:07:14] you've done this and God saw it all
[1:07:16] because you're able to cover up
[1:07:17] everything except the vertical but God
[1:07:19] has spared you
[1:07:21] there's going to be troubles in your
[1:07:22] house there's going to be a sword in
[1:07:23] your house for the rest of your days but
[1:07:24] you know what God has spared you he's
[1:07:26] going to save your life he's going to
[1:07:28] take that baby but he's going to save
[1:07:29] your life
[1:07:31] because God knew he could deal with
[1:07:33] David God knew David had the kind of a
[1:07:35] heart that he could deal with and he
[1:07:36] could confront David he could bring
[1:07:38] truth to David and David would respond
[1:07:40] to that I pray God would give all of us
[1:07:42] that kind of a heart that whenever we're
[1:07:43] confronted with truth and sometimes you
[1:07:45] know a minister will get right in your
[1:07:47] face and preach the thing that you need
[1:07:48] to hear may God always give us a heart
[1:07:51] that's not hardened by circumstances or
[1:07:53] our own neglect but rather we'll we'll
[1:07:55] respond to that and say Lord have mercy
[1:07:58] upon me
[1:08:00] Lord do whatever it takes
[1:08:02] move me where I need to be moved bring
[1:08:05] people into my life that need to be
[1:08:07] brought into my life
[1:08:09] change the circumstances but Lord may I
[1:08:12] never bring a reproach against this
[1:08:13] message may I never bring a reproach
[1:08:15] against you
[1:08:17] may I Stand For Truth all the days of my
[1:08:20] life
