[2:36] psalms 27 this morning from the word of
[2:39] God together if you have your Bibles the
[2:41] Lord is my light and my salvation Whom
[2:43] Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of
[2:46] my life is he the strength of your life
[2:50] if he's the strength of Your Life whom
[2:52] shall I be afraid when the wicked even
[2:54] mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to
[2:57] eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell
[2:59] though a whole should encamp against me
[3:01] my heart shall not fear the war should
[3:04] rise against me in this will I be
[3:07] confident one thing I have desired of
[3:09] the Lord that I will seek after that I
[3:12] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[3:14] the days of my life I'll tell you this
[3:17] experience with the Lord and where David
[3:19] wanted to live it's not a one year at
[3:21] Camp's experience it's not once a week
[3:23] at church he said this is the one thing
[3:26] I desire in my life and that is I'd seek
[3:28] after this and that's to dwell in the
[3:31] presence of the Lord every day of my
[3:33] life can you say Amen and so and to
[3:36] behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire
[3:38] in his Temple for in the time of trouble
[3:41] he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[3:45] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[3:47] me he shall set me up upon a rock and
[3:50] now shall mine head be lifted up above
[3:54] mine enemies round about me therefore
[3:57] will I offer in his Tabernacle
[4:00] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will
[4:03] sing praises unto the Lord
[4:07] amen heavenly father I believe that's
[4:09] what we've just done is sing praises to
[4:11] you Lord and we know there's an enemy
[4:13] encamped around us we know there's an
[4:15] extreme trouble in this hour we live in
[4:17] but Lord to be able to come in your
[4:19] house and express ourselves to you Lord
[4:21] is just a joy to us today and so we'll
[4:24] offer those sacrifices of Joy before you
[4:27] and Lord you've done something deep in
[4:28] our hearts and we have something to
[4:30] thank you for something to worship you
[4:32] for and I just pray you'll bless every
[4:34] heart and soul that's here today from
[4:36] the youngest child to the oldest those
[4:38] who are listening online those who would
[4:40] listen on the broadcast I pray father
[4:42] that you would if there's a seed there
[4:45] may it respond to the word of God I pray
[4:47] and God we pray you take the anointing
[4:49] and bring it in the service today use my
[4:51] lips of clay father God help me to get
[4:54] out of the way so that your presence and
[4:56] your spirit your character can be the
[4:58] image in front of the people today we
[5:00] trust in you we believe Lord you have
[5:02] something for us and we commit it to you
[5:04] in Jesus name amen God bless you maybe
[5:07] see this morning
[5:10] I want to speak a little bit out of
[5:12] Psalms 27 and I want to title this hide
[5:14] me in this time of trouble
[5:16] hide me in this time of trouble David is
[5:19] the only one that used this term four or
[5:22] five times in his writings besides job
[5:24] and he just says those words hide me and
[5:28] he asked God God hide me hide me and I'm
[5:32] only one of the reasons I'm preaching
[5:34] this is because that's why that's the
[5:36] way I have felt lately and that is Lord
[5:38] just hide me
[5:40] just hide me there's a certain
[5:41] protection can you say amen and so he
[5:44] asked the Lord but I I was looking at it
[5:46] uh the last couple days
[5:48] and it seems a bit mysterious if you
[5:51] don't understand why David is saying
[5:53] hide me it seems a bit mysterious
[5:55] because we know that David is a warrior
[5:58] David was a fighter David from his very
[6:01] young years as a teen was had faith in
[6:05] God and he wasn't afraid of anything he
[6:08] proved himself to be unafraid of the
[6:11] enemy since he was a little boy so if we
[6:13] were to use the context of him saying
[6:15] Lord hide me my enemies are encamped
[6:18] about me hide me it doesn't seem like
[6:20] it's the right thing for David to say
[6:22] because he doesn't look like somebody
[6:23] that would hide from the enemy he
[6:26] actually ran towards Goliath
[6:29] he didn't have a problem of being afraid
[6:31] of the enemy and it just seems
[6:33] mysterious that he would say Lord hide
[6:36] me from the enemy they're encamped about
[6:38] me and and there's and there's this I I
[6:41] feel it moving in and approaching them
[6:43] to me kind of like we feel in the time
[6:45] we live in and so he but you see we we
[6:48] don't have the impression from David's
[6:50] life that he was one that would be one
[6:53] that would run from the enemy or to hide
[6:55] and and yet he's asking the Lord hide me
[6:59] Lord hide me yet it is not running away
[7:02] or it's not being scared in other words
[7:04] he's not saying hide me because he's
[7:06] afraid because he said at the beginning
[7:08] To Whom Shall I Fear I don't fear
[7:10] anything he says the Lord is my strength
[7:12] of whom shall I be afraid he's not
[7:15] saying hide me because he's afraid
[7:19] he's not saying it because he's wanting
[7:22] to run from the enemy that's not David
[7:24] and yet it is not a running away or a
[7:26] scared he's he says he is not afraid uh
[7:30] To Whom Shall I Fear I'm not afraid he
[7:33] said in this will I be confident there's
[7:36] full confidence here there's no fear
[7:38] here but yet we must realize that fear
[7:41] is around him
[7:43] fear is surrounding him can you say Amen
[7:46] uh uh there's there's the enemy
[7:48] surrounding him my foes that were coming
[7:50] to eat my flesh he's being completely
[7:53] surrounded by the enemy and so he's
[7:56] saying hide me not because he's afraid
[7:58] but because if he don't live in that
[8:01] secret place then he's vulnerable to
[8:04] become influenced by this fear
[8:08] praise the Lord
[8:10] so he says I'm confident but he says
[8:14] does hide me that he says let me live in
[8:17] a place that's protected and a place
[8:19] that's higher another place that opens
[8:22] up to me that would be higher than the
[8:25] enemy now but in Psalm 64 2 the way he
[8:28] says it in hide me he says it this way
[8:30] he says hide me from the secret counsel
[8:33] of the wicked
[8:35] from the Insurrection of the workers of
[8:38] iniquity
[8:40] so now we get a little bit more window
[8:42] into what he's saying hiding me from and
[8:44] that is the the secret counsel of the
[8:47] wicked from the Insurrection of workers
[8:49] of iniquity the secret counsel of the
[8:51] wicked in other words hide me don't let
[8:54] me be affected by what's being said
[8:57] about me in private
[9:01] things are being said about from my
[9:04] enemy and that's the secret counsel and
[9:06] things but so now this is something he
[9:08] said hide me from that and I'm just just
[9:10] pondering this morning with you why
[9:12] would he say hide me from that I'm going
[9:14] to bring this out if I can why is David
[9:16] saying hide me from the secret counsel
[9:19] of the wicked I wonder if this hide me
[9:21] is not so much is is not so much
[9:24] protection from a regular war or arrows
[9:27] that are coming at him uh he wouldn't be
[9:29] afraid of that but maybe what he will
[9:31] hear that is being said about him and
[9:34] what he would hear being said about him
[9:36] might affect him a little bit and that
[9:38] would influence him and may influence
[9:40] him out of this place of protection uh
[9:44] just bear with me as I just lay these
[9:45] foundations maybe he hide me means that
[9:49] I don't want to be affected affected by
[9:52] what's being said about me
[9:58] I'm just preaching this because this is
[10:00] the way I'm feeling lately before the
[10:01] Lord God just hide me I just feel like
[10:05] um lately I just feel like I'm trying to
[10:06] stay out of the line of fire
[10:09] has anybody ever felt that that way you
[10:12] know just don't say too much because if
[10:15] you say something if you say too much it
[10:19] can and will be used against you in the
[10:21] court of law
[10:22] and that's how the enemy is can you say
[10:24] man you can have the best intentions and
[10:26] say something it gets twisted by the
[10:28] enemy can I get an amen and so it kind
[10:31] of makes you on edge is that I'm just
[10:32] trying to stay out of the line of fire
[10:34] things being shot at me things being
[10:36] said that's how David felt this is all
[10:38] through the book of Psalms where he
[10:39] talks about the enemy and things coming
[10:41] at him and his enemy what they're saying
[10:43] about him and so David had to live in
[10:46] another place David had to live in a
[10:49] higher place because why words can
[10:52] affect us
[10:53] the enemy's attacks can affect us
[10:56] especially if we have a lot of complexes
[10:59] the enemy abuses those things so he
[11:01] wanted to live in a higher place that he
[11:03] wasn't affected or brought down by that
[11:06] and he was saying hi me it hide me from
[11:09] those things God just hired me and
[11:11] sometimes it's safer not to say anything
[11:13] or the devil can twist it and I just
[11:16] want to be I don't know about you but in
[11:18] this last stage where there's such a and
[11:20] I'll talk about this in a minute just
[11:22] such a a pressure such a pressure and
[11:25] such enemy power against Christians I
[11:29] just want to be a simple Christian with
[11:32] no guile and no pretense
[11:35] I just want to be nice
[11:39] and I do that and I still can't do
[11:41] things right
[11:43] job is the only other man who said hide
[11:45] me and he says it this way which is to
[11:47] me a mystery behind it Job 14 13 says oh
[11:51] that thou wouldest hide me in the grave
[11:58] oh that thou wouldest hide me in the
[12:01] grave that thou wouldest keep me secret
[12:04] until thy wrath be passed that thou
[12:08] wouldest appoint me a set time and
[12:11] remember me now I want to elaborate on
[12:13] this because all that job went through
[12:16] this is what he says in all that he's
[12:18] gone through on Earth he said hide me in
[12:21] the grave in other words there's a lot
[12:23] of pressure he went through a lot of
[12:25] losses he had in this life but he had a
[12:28] revelation of Resurrection how many know
[12:30] that job had a revelation of
[12:32] Resurrection
[12:34] how many know that job was not afraid of
[12:36] the grave he's not afraid of the Grave
[12:39] he's not afraid of dying because he
[12:41] knows the grave is not the end for him
[12:43] he's got a revelation that if I go there
[12:46] it's not the end it's actually just the
[12:48] beginning and I will end this life
[12:50] someday I will end the pressure here
[12:52] someday and if I'm putting that grave to
[12:55] hide there that's a good place for a
[12:56] Christian to hide because God's going to
[12:58] come and pull me out of that grave
[13:00] someday
[13:02] hide me in the grave till thy wrath be
[13:06] passed and so you know he understood the
[13:09] judgments of God
[13:10] how many understand that we're living in
[13:13] the pre-judgments of God right now
[13:15] we're living in pre-tribulation it can't
[13:18] fully set in until the bride is gone but
[13:21] don't tell me that we're not
[13:22] experiencing prejudgments
[13:25] pre-tribulation pre-plagues that are
[13:27] hitting the Earth we're just on the
[13:29] verge of the wrath of God being
[13:31] Unleashed on this Earth on the
[13:33] perversion on the Rebellion to God we're
[13:36] uh we're living in the very on the verge
[13:38] of it happening because we live in Pre
[13:41] some diseases have already started can
[13:43] you say man we're in pre-tribulation
[13:46] right now it's upon us now and the Death
[13:49] Angel is already in the land that's what
[13:51] he said in the token the death angel is
[13:53] in the land today it's not a physical
[13:55] death it's a spiritual death it's after
[13:58] your children it's after your families
[14:00] it's after anything spiritual like it
[14:03] was that night in Egypt can you say man
[14:05] the death angel was passing through all
[14:07] of Israel and only if there was the
[14:09] token the blood on the door did the
[14:11] death angel passed it and the prophet
[14:13] said the death angel is already in the
[14:15] land today okay that's why people are
[14:17] spiritually dying
[14:19] people you thought were stable
[14:21] spiritually dying well the death angel
[14:23] is in the land and unless you have the
[14:25] token the Holy Ghost it's not going to
[14:27] pass you it's not going to just pass
[14:29] your family because you go to a message
[14:30] Church
[14:34] the death angel is not going to pass
[14:35] your family up
[14:37] just because you go to a message church
[14:39] it's out to get our families it's out to
[14:41] divide our families it's out to divide
[14:43] us it's out to divide churches people
[14:46] can you say Amen to bring spiritual
[14:49] death that pale horse rider getting
[14:52] ready to run a combination of all three
[14:54] of them Pale Horse death the death rider
[14:57] beginning to run
[14:58] and we're right on the verge of that and
[15:00] so the Wrath coming down getting ready
[15:03] to come and job says hide me in the
[15:05] grave that says a lot there's a mystery
[15:08] behind this that only job knew and that
[15:11] is nobody would ask God to hide me in
[15:14] the grave that's not a place most people
[15:16] on the face of the Earth are saying just
[15:18] hide me in the grave you'd have to have
[15:20] a revelation
[15:21] to ask God hide me in the grave
[15:27] remember revelation of resurrection and
[15:29] rapture
[15:30] to say hide me in the grave and so job
[15:34] has that Revelation and unless they knew
[15:37] people knew that it was some sort of a
[15:39] Hideout and I believe job did not look
[15:41] at it as death he looked at it as kind
[15:43] of a hideout until the resurrection this
[15:45] is what psalms 27 is because the
[15:48] revelation of the Rapture is tied to
[15:51] psalms 27 how many Believers know that
[15:53] psalms 27 is the text that was used for
[15:56] Rapture the revelation of the Rapture is
[15:58] tied to this very mysterious scripture
[16:01] where he says in Psalms 27 what we read
[16:03] read today though and hosted and Camp
[16:06] abound me those fears around me I will
[16:08] not fear I will be confident but Lord I
[16:10] need one thing one thing I desire to
[16:13] dwell wherever you're dwelling I need to
[16:15] be in the secret of your Tabernacle I
[16:18] need to live in that protection can you
[16:20] say Amen
[16:22] and so that's why the prophet used
[16:25] Psalms 27 never refers to it again
[16:27] throughout the sermon but he had to use
[16:30] this scripture because this is the
[16:32] conditions before Rapture there had to
[16:34] be a a hideout there had to be a secret
[16:37] place
[16:38] and if we didn't have it we won't
[16:41] survive laodicea we won't survive the
[16:43] judgments of God we won't survive the
[16:45] conditions
[16:47] we better be real and say without the
[16:50] Holy Spirit and living in his presence
[16:52] none of us have the human capability to
[16:56] survive the times that we're living in
[16:59] right now
[17:00] the quicker some of us raise our hands
[17:01] and be honest about it
[17:03] there's nothing within you that can make
[17:06] it
[17:07] in these times
[17:09] without the Holy Ghost secret place
[17:15] and the quicker we realize that that
[17:17] this is the answer to Rapture time
[17:19] matter of fact you can't get rapturing
[17:22] Faith unless you're in that place that's
[17:24] the room that's the place he gives you
[17:26] Faith because why outside of that is
[17:29] doubt is fear can you say that you're
[17:31] not going to get rapturing Faith by
[17:33] feeding on the things of the world
[17:34] you're not going to get rapturing Faith
[17:36] by feeding on a denominational Creed
[17:39] you're not going to get rapturing Faith
[17:41] by just some nominal Christian thing God
[17:44] has provided the food to bring rapturing
[17:46] Faith to his people in the last days and
[17:49] if you stay outside of the secret place
[17:51] then you realize you don't have the
[17:53] strength teenager I'm going to tell you
[17:55] as your friend and your servant of the
[17:57] Lord you cannot make it in this lustful
[18:00] age without the Holy Ghost
[18:04] your mental capability your willpower
[18:07] it's not good enough for Satan's Eden
[18:11] come on friends can I get a greater amen
[18:13] if you're not good enough there's
[18:16] nothing going to make it except you get
[18:18] in Christ in that place with Christ
[18:21] families are not going to make it
[18:22] without being in this word and being in
[18:24] with Christ
[18:26] marriages are not going to make it
[18:28] without being rooted very heavy in that
[18:31] secret place with Christ where the word
[18:33] is the most important thing in your life
[18:36] I can play around this I can you know
[18:39] what no no it's too much maybe even
[18:42] Luther's day you might have survived it
[18:44] a little bit but in this Satan's Eden it
[18:47] takes this answer to the Rapture to
[18:49] develop rapists it's a developing room
[18:53] can you say Amen
[18:54] you know job thought it was a it was a
[18:58] it's it's a hideout it's a play job
[19:01] never seen it as the end but a hideout a
[19:03] waiting room a green room let me know
[19:06] what everyone knows what a green room is
[19:07] it's the Green Room green room before
[19:10] the big stage event
[19:12] The Green Room is where all the artists
[19:14] go and they waited out before
[19:18] they are invited to the big stage event
[19:20] and to perform
[19:22] praise the Lord
[19:23] so until you're called out on stage
[19:25] you're you know and that's
[19:28] job is in the Green Room
[19:30] waiting to be called
[19:32] for the big Resurrection event praise
[19:35] the Lord everybody
[19:36] he wanted to be hiding until Jesus cried
[19:39] out and there he was all the Old
[19:41] Testament Saints who died in the Lord
[19:43] there they are hiding out in the grave
[19:46] they're hiding in the grave and
[19:47] everybody thought they're dead and
[19:48] they're gone no they're just in the
[19:50] green room waiting to be called on stage
[19:54] and sure enough when Jesus cried out
[19:57] with a loud voice there was a power
[19:59] behind his voice of resurrection and the
[20:01] Bible says they come out of the green
[20:03] room and they showed themselves in the
[20:06] city streets of Jerusalem
[20:09] their life wasn't over the great what
[20:12] the grave wasn't the end
[20:14] they were just hiding out there
[20:17] hide me
[20:19] appearing now the Bride of Jesus Christ
[20:22] on stage
[20:24] and if she goes to the Grave she's
[20:26] waiting in the green room because it's
[20:28] gonna how many knows it's going to
[20:29] happen again how many knows there's a
[20:30] voice of Resurrection
[20:32] how many knows there's a shout for the
[20:34] rapture
[20:35] Jesus said the shout Paul said to shout
[20:37] the voice and the Trump the three phases
[20:39] of the Rapture that means that we're
[20:41] already in the cycle of it shout the
[20:44] voice of the Resurrection the same voice
[20:46] that called the Saints out of the Grave
[20:47] is the same voice that's here now
[20:51] the message ended up being the shout
[20:53] ended up being something different we
[20:55] ever thought from a Pentecostal View and
[20:58] here he presents it the shout is a
[20:59] message and a prophet to gather the
[21:01] people together
[21:02] so we're already in the cycle of it now
[21:04] we're looking for that voice of the
[21:05] Resurrection which will be in The Bride
[21:07] of Jesus Christ
[21:08] she's the Earthly body on Earth
[21:10] something's going to happen in her to
[21:12] trigger the resurrection
[21:15] oh I can't wait friends and then the
[21:17] last Trump the last Trump
[21:20] a lot of people thought when this
[21:22] president got in president Trump that
[21:23] was it that was the last trump it was a
[21:25] type it was a type
[21:31] as I said the prophet never commented
[21:33] back to his texts in the Rapture back to
[21:36] psalms 27 never he never mentioned it
[21:38] again it seems like it don't fit but it
[21:40] fits perfectly for several reasons one
[21:42] is that David said hide me in the secret
[21:45] of his dwelling place and that types
[21:48] with the Rapture or that links with the
[21:50] Rapture because we know this he says put
[21:53] me in not your Tabernacle not your
[21:55] Pavilion the secret
[21:57] of your Tabernacle
[21:59] the Rapture also is a secret
[22:03] can you say Amen
[22:05] so that ties together perfectly with the
[22:08] Rapture because we're talking about a
[22:10] secret place secret place uh when you
[22:14] have a secret place it means that not
[22:16] everybody knows where it is
[22:19] not everybody knows where it is or not
[22:23] everybody is called to that secret place
[22:25] uh it's a place that God develops us for
[22:29] rapturing Faith it's a place secretly it
[22:33] has to be a place why because all around
[22:35] is doubts and fears and questions all
[22:39] around us is doubts and fears and
[22:41] questions and Satan messing with
[22:43] absolutes all the time
[22:45] Satan closing in on us with his doubts
[22:48] you can't get more rapturing faith when
[22:50] you're being destabilized by Demons of
[22:53] Doubt let me say it again you can't get
[22:56] rapturing Faith to get out of here when
[22:58] you're exposing yourself online on
[23:01] social media to all kinds of doubt
[23:03] you'll never get rapturing Faith from
[23:05] those sources
[23:06] and if you expose yourself too much to
[23:09] it you'll find yourself doubting because
[23:11] that's all that produces it'll never
[23:13] bring rap string faith
[23:16] preaching some Creed will never bring
[23:18] Rapture in faith going back to Pentecost
[23:20] will never bring rapturing Faith
[23:23] but God has provided the place that he
[23:25] will preach rapturing Faith to his
[23:27] people
[23:28] he will Rapture his people how many want
[23:30] to be raptured amen but you need
[23:32] rapturing Faith Rapture is a revelation
[23:35] I need that Revelation above any
[23:36] revelation
[23:38] amen so God will provide it so the next
[23:41] scripture though even though the prophet
[23:44] does not mention psalms 27 the next
[23:46] scripture and now I'm going to get into
[23:48] this just a little bit deeper the next
[23:50] scripture he mentions in the service is
[23:52] the one in in the New Testament that
[23:55] says in the last days concerning the
[23:58] coming of the Lord scoffers will come
[24:02] scoffers and he takes that and
[24:04] elaborates on it scoffers just before
[24:07] the coming of the Lord and during the
[24:09] midst of the coming scoffers will rise
[24:12] up and you know what they're scoffing at
[24:13] not just that you're a Christian we
[24:15] always get that but they're scoffing the
[24:18] promise of the rapture
[24:20] they're scoffing the coming of the Lord
[24:23] they're scoffing and making fun of
[24:25] this promise that you believe you're
[24:28] saying Amen to this morning you're
[24:30] saying I believe I'm a part of it
[24:31] they're scoffing they're making fun of
[24:33] that they say where is the promise of
[24:35] his coming for since the fathers came
[24:38] all things continue just as they are
[24:41] that's what the world says that's a lot
[24:42] of times what in the Christian church
[24:44] says that's doesn't mean anything that
[24:46] that that doesn't mean nothing and so
[24:48] now we have a doubting we have scoffers
[24:50] that are scoffing the promise the very
[24:52] promise that we believe can you say Amen
[24:55] so if we have a day of scoffers then the
[24:58] whole thing is mocking and questioning
[25:00] that whole question where is the promise
[25:03] of his coming
[25:05] the questions where is the Vindication
[25:08] for all of this
[25:12] where is the Vindication that he's going
[25:14] to send a prophet oh I can't get my mind
[25:18] wrapped around it to think that the very
[25:22] answer for this age is a prophet
[25:32] and that's the thing that gets mocked
[25:37] denominational Creeds and Dogma sense
[25:39] missed one of the most crucial
[25:41] principles of the Bible and it's the
[25:43] Amos 3 7 principle it's the one man
[25:46] principle
[25:47] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[25:50] except he revealeth his secrets to his
[25:54] servants the prophets
[25:57] and that principle is All Through the
[25:59] Bible God's mouthpiece
[26:01] and all of a sudden some Theory says yes
[26:04] we believe it all through the Bible but
[26:07] today God doesn't do it that way he
[26:11] comes through our denomination he comes
[26:13] through a group of people no he begins
[26:15] his process of visiting his people by
[26:18] using the mouth of a prophet
[26:21] the Forerunner to the first coming of
[26:23] Christ was one man John the Baptist with
[26:26] the spirit of Elijah it wasn't many men
[26:28] it was one man and that principles
[26:30] throughout the Bible say well where's it
[26:32] at in the New Testament well it was Paul
[26:34] because Paul you see he wasn't just an
[26:37] apostle he was a prophet
[26:40] okay see well he was just one of the
[26:42] Apostles and one time I was talking to
[26:43] somebody I don't like to get into this
[26:45] too much but I just want to mention to
[26:46] you that somebody was saying no no this
[26:49] prophet of this day no it's not that
[26:50] it's not that it's just Jesus and these
[26:52] things and so I I said to him this is
[26:54] many many years ago so I'm not talking
[26:55] about anybody here I was I was saying to
[26:57] him then what about Paul and I realized
[26:59] he had to say that Paul wasn't a prophet
[27:02] going with that Regular Baptist type of
[27:04] theory is that he wasn't probably he was
[27:06] just one of the Apostles he had to go
[27:07] that direction because if you say a Paul
[27:09] is a prophet then you got to believe
[27:10] that there's New Testament prophets
[27:14] and he couldn't go there so he said no
[27:15] no he wasn't a problem he was just an
[27:17] apostle I said wait a minute now wait
[27:18] that's not scripture at all we know that
[27:20] Paul was a prophet wrote 14 books in the
[27:23] New Testament and so you asked the
[27:24] question how do you give him that much
[27:26] Authority as the Canon of scriptures to
[27:28] where even Paul said he said you're
[27:30] taking the things the Believers are
[27:31] taking things that I'm saying as the
[27:34] Commandments of the Lord as the very
[27:36] word of God how do you do that with Paul
[27:38] because it's the Canon of scriptures but
[27:41] you you give yourself authority to
[27:43] eliminate it as a possibility today
[27:47] can't do that it it's Satan messing with
[27:50] absolutes is Satan messing with the
[27:52] Bible leave it alone
[27:55] just believe it can you say man believe
[27:57] it the way God says it can you say Amen
[27:59] so this mocking of things is also
[28:02] mocking what happens in end times events
[28:04] and also especially the promise of the
[28:06] Rapture the coming of the Lord mocking
[28:09] the coming of the Lord and just before
[28:10] Rapture our promised we realize that
[28:14] there's an increased intensity of
[28:16] pressure and trouble and that's why I'm
[28:18] pulling out that word out psalms 27 the
[28:20] time in the time of trouble in the time
[28:22] of trouble how many believe we're in the
[28:24] time of trouble in the time of trouble I
[28:27] need you to hide me
[28:29] in the time of trouble there is a great
[28:32] intensity of the enemy be being encamped
[28:36] around the people of God in the time of
[28:39] trouble there will be a lot of trouble
[28:40] we we ask the Lord to hide us because we
[28:44] don't want to be caught in the trouble
[28:46] it's it's Pride to say
[28:49] that I won't be caught in all this
[28:52] trouble you have the vulnerability to be
[28:55] caught in the trouble around you
[28:58] you have the the humanness The Human
[29:01] Side the fleshly side of you if you feed
[29:04] on things enough you will be caught in
[29:07] the web just like everybody else is
[29:09] caught in the web of pornography of
[29:12] adultery of Family Division you'll be
[29:15] caught in that world because you're
[29:16] vulnerable to it you'll be caught in it
[29:18] yourself but God gives us an escape God
[29:22] gives us a place out
[29:26] and so in the time of trouble is when
[29:28] he's saying would you please Lord hide
[29:30] me there's no need for us to hide
[29:34] unless
[29:36] there's danger
[29:38] all around
[29:39] can you say Amen
[29:42] amen why is David saying hide me Lord
[29:44] hide me because there's danger all
[29:47] around him
[29:49] if you don't realize there's danger all
[29:51] around you and that it could affect you
[29:52] then you're not asking Lord hide me hide
[29:55] me
[29:56] hide me in that rock put me on that rock
[29:59] he's saying lift me above my enemies in
[30:02] the time of trouble please hide me he
[30:04] wouldn't be asking that unless there's
[30:05] danger all around the time of trouble if
[30:07] you don't see there's danger around then
[30:09] you don't see the value of that secret
[30:11] place we need to be hidden away with
[30:14] Christ the Bible says also that we live
[30:16] in perilous times testing times can you
[30:19] say Amen
[30:20] besides all the spirits and Hell being
[30:23] unloosed around Unleashed around us
[30:25] besides the lustful Spirits the
[30:28] perverted Spirits all these things
[30:30] surrounding us it's a time of trouble
[30:33] but then the Bible says in the last days
[30:35] there will be perilous times that means
[30:37] testing time we're vulnerable outside of
[30:39] his daily protection there is a hedge
[30:42] from the spirit of this world there's a
[30:44] protection from the spirit of this world
[30:46] is safety in Jesus Christ the word can
[30:50] you say Amen
[30:52] do I need to be more specific demon
[30:54] power do I need to be more specific
[30:57] if you don't think that you walk out of
[30:59] here and you're living in a dangerous
[31:01] time then let me be more specific
[31:04] demon demonic power from hell can be in
[31:09] music
[31:13] demonic power can be in movies it can be
[31:17] in tick tock
[31:19] it can be in books
[31:22] it can be in social media
[31:24] it can be on YouTube
[31:27] if you're growing up as a Christian
[31:28] right that you realize that that we're
[31:31] living in a spiritual Battle of things
[31:33] that we can't see and so something that
[31:36] you feed on too much you could take a
[31:38] spirit so quickly and not even see that
[31:41] you took it
[31:42] that's the danger that we live in and
[31:45] and I can't I can't come with you every
[31:48] day and watch over you and some of you
[31:50] kids growing up your parents can't watch
[31:51] over you every waking minute they can't
[31:54] see all the time what's on your phone
[31:55] and so danger danger danger when you get
[31:59] older danger danger not because your
[32:01] parents is warning your or your
[32:03] preachers getting right in the face
[32:04] warning you it's danger not because I
[32:06] said it it's danger because the Demonic
[32:08] power that's against your life it's a
[32:10] dangerous time so you're not going to
[32:12] take a loose attitude towards a
[32:14] dangerous time I wish I'd never given my
[32:17] kids a phone at whatever it was 14 15
[32:19] years old I wish I'd have set the age at
[32:22] like 30.
[32:25] yeah good luck with that
[32:28] because I didn't realize till later on
[32:32] that just like brother Brandon said
[32:34] about TV said it could have been a great
[32:37] instrument for the kingdom of God and in
[32:39] some ways today it is being used that
[32:41] way
[32:42] could have been a great the devil got a
[32:44] hold of it becomes the worst place for
[32:46] trash and demonic power to come across
[32:51] you ever heard about a movie years ago
[32:53] in in the 80s called Poltergeist it's
[32:56] about demons
[32:58] it's all the way back in the 80s and the
[33:01] inspiration comes to some director and
[33:02] he pegs demons come into somebody's
[33:04] house so this is the story of the movie
[33:07] demons come into the household and then
[33:09] because because the little girl sitting
[33:10] and the TV after midnight goes into this
[33:14] fuzzy what do you call that
[33:17] huh
[33:18] static whatever and she's watching this
[33:21] during the night late when the kids have
[33:23] gone to bed and that all of a sudden
[33:26] through that brings demons into that
[33:28] home
[33:29] and they suffer in that home with
[33:31] demonic power for months and months and
[33:33] months and they don't know what's going
[33:35] on but they started it came through the
[33:37] TV
[33:39] there's a movie saying this
[33:41] out there completely blatant about it
[33:43] and saying exactly what the prophet said
[33:45] in the 50s and 60s
[33:48] so here it is and so now they go through
[33:50] months if I they can't get them out they
[33:52] can't do that they're haunting them
[33:54] every night this is and I not encourage
[33:56] you at all to watch it for sure because
[33:58] they'll bring demonic power in your home
[34:01] but you see now it's it's real it's real
[34:03] but it started with that and so now it
[34:05] gets to the end of it and you know they
[34:07] had to almost destroy that entire house
[34:09] they had to move they could not get them
[34:11] out had no power of God to do it so they
[34:13] couldn't they had to move I think they
[34:14] even just if I remember right they
[34:16] destroyed the entire house and
[34:18] everything went to a motel with their
[34:20] family and the last I didn't expect to
[34:23] say this today but this is this is good
[34:25] the last scene of the movie is dad takes
[34:29] the TV in the motel
[34:32] and rolls it out to the sidewalk and
[34:35] shuts the door of the motel and that's
[34:37] the last scene
[34:39] because daddy realized that's how it all
[34:42] got started
[34:46] now it's hard to preach these things
[34:48] today because it's not popular because I
[34:49] know there's a lot of integrated stuff
[34:51] my family and I every once in a while we
[34:53] if we have a a nice evening which is
[34:56] very rare we have time to do it but
[34:58] we'll watch a decent thing this new
[35:00] chosen series all these we like is
[35:02] something decent I let the kids watch
[35:03] VeggieTales when they're young it's not
[35:05] that we didn't have a video in a monitor
[35:07] and a a TV in our home because of that
[35:09] but it was very restricted what came
[35:11] through that screen and a lot of it was
[35:12] because I read things like that years
[35:13] ago this is real the prophet isn't
[35:16] knocking the women's dress just to be
[35:18] happy he's not knocking TVs he's just
[35:21] he's deserting as a prophet where this
[35:24] television and phone and Technology
[35:27] who's in charge
[35:29] somebody needs to say Amen don't be
[35:32] vulnerable this is a dangerous time to
[35:36] live in
[35:38] and that's why David said this is
[35:41] dangerous the enemy is not out there
[35:43] he's encamped right up to my door and so
[35:47] what am I saying hide me
[35:49] hide Me Lord
[35:52] let me become so hidden in Christ that
[35:55] the devil doesn't know where to find me
[35:58] is this okay with everybody today
[36:01] hide me Lord hide me because of the
[36:04] danger that's around me
[36:05] so he's honest and saying if you don't
[36:07] hide me I'll be affected by what's
[36:09] around me
[36:11] I'll be affected by what people say
[36:13] about me
[36:15] amen praise the Lord demonic power can
[36:18] be in those things last days minships
[36:21] here we go in the last days testing time
[36:23] because men shall be lovers of their own
[36:25] selves Covetous vultures proud
[36:28] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[36:31] without natural affection
[36:33] truce Breakers false accusers this is
[36:36] all the last day's stuff
[36:37] true spankers promise Breakers false
[36:40] accusers despisers of those that are
[36:42] good
[36:43] incontinent Unholy and oh with all that
[36:47] hello having a form of godliness
[36:51] Christians
[36:54] Christians that don't have the Holy
[36:56] Ghost and all these manifestations of
[36:59] the last days are all there
[37:02] that's a dangerous time
[37:04] that's the last days as well in the last
[37:06] days they'll mock the promise of God
[37:08] they'll mock it on the internet they'll
[37:10] mock it they'll mock this message it's
[37:12] it's a mocking time it's things being
[37:14] set against it to to to try to produce
[37:17] fate a lack of faith in your life so
[37:20] having said all that uh you know plus is
[37:23] the form of godness and I don't want to
[37:25] forget always what he says at the end of
[37:27] all that from such turn away
[37:30] that sentence has more power in it than
[37:32] all the rest from such all that turn
[37:35] away
[37:36] nah I think I'm hung around that guy at
[37:38] work because I want to witness to him
[37:40] and I want to hang around them a bit try
[37:42] to save them
[37:45] I'll go with them to the bar because I
[37:47] just need to hang around them and do
[37:49] some missionary work
[37:53] the Bible said from such turn away
[37:56] and if they're hungry
[37:58] for if you're living the life of Christ
[38:00] filled with the spirit if they're hungry
[38:03] they're going to thirst for that they're
[38:05] going to start asking you questions
[38:09] I'm gonna I'm gonna witness to them and
[38:13] time after time I'm gonna go help this
[38:15] person because they're they're having
[38:17] that they're going through this time and
[38:18] they go help them and that Spirit turns
[38:20] them around
[38:23] because they're not strong they don't
[38:25] have the solid Christ in their life yet
[38:26] so they think they can handle it but
[38:28] they're vulnerable they're in a
[38:30] dangerous spot
[38:32] Dangerous Ground run into a safe place
[38:36] that's what David said I want to run the
[38:38] name of the Lord is a strong tower
[38:42] we're in the righteous run into it
[38:45] and are safe
[38:50] a host is encamped around us that's why
[38:52] David is writing for our day this is the
[38:55] rapture scripture for our day because
[38:57] the environment is everything now I'll
[38:59] just take this a bit further just for a
[39:01] short few minutes here
[39:05] there's an incident that you're familiar
[39:07] with many of you if you're not that's
[39:09] why I say these things because some
[39:10] people are not familiar with it but I
[39:13] want I want you to notice that the the
[39:16] everything around us
[39:18] is not just neutral in the sense that
[39:22] they're just living their own lives
[39:24] but it has a an agenda with it it has a
[39:29] spirit added to it to influence you
[39:34] to pull you and drag you down it's not
[39:37] neutral can you say Amen
[39:38] and and so in a great example of that of
[39:41] course is something that we had a few
[39:44] years ago
[39:45] we had um homosexual Spirit come upon a
[39:48] boy in the church he'd actually had it
[39:49] for years we didn't realize it then we'd
[39:52] be gonna pick up on it a brother was
[39:53] picking up on it there's a couple dreams
[39:55] Holy Ghost working in the church and so
[39:57] now then it manifests itself and me
[40:00] going through that trying to help this
[40:01] boy just a little bit what helped he let
[40:03] me give him I realized with that spirit
[40:06] and then as you read the news articles
[40:08] that that spirit is never
[40:11] uh good enough to go off and leave
[40:15] the congregation and leave everybody and
[40:18] go find some Mountain to live with all
[40:20] the rest of the homosexuals not going to
[40:23] happen
[40:24] it has something with it that it wants
[40:27] to stay around
[40:30] and so I found that in scripture when I
[40:32] realized the sodomites were knocking on
[40:33] lot's door
[40:35] so it's like go go over there on your
[40:37] side of town and just do your thing okay
[40:39] I'll respect you okay I'll respect you I
[40:42] don't agree with you
[40:43] I'll pray for your deliverance but go
[40:45] over there no no knocking on Lord's door
[40:49] so I realized this is the thing and so
[40:50] dealing with this then we realized that
[40:52] he wanted to continue as normal and
[40:55] these are other incidents that continue
[40:57] to hang around the young people and hang
[40:59] around and at Christmas time wanted to
[41:01] just you know and it's like no I know
[41:03] and I'm asked to give counselors no you
[41:06] can't do that and then you know what
[41:07] happens to that Spirit then you you
[41:09] block it off and you say no you can't we
[41:11] have to separate from this because your
[41:13] choices then your Christianity comes
[41:16] into examination
[41:20] Your Love Of Christ comes into question
[41:23] you know I've been serving the lord
[41:24] since I was 16 film of the Holy Ghost
[41:27] was 16 years old and if I have the Holy
[41:28] Ghost I have the love of Christ and now
[41:30] after 30 years my love of Christ is
[41:32] being brought in question
[41:35] like how do you have the authority to do
[41:37] that where did you get the authority
[41:38] because it's an arrogant Spirit it knows
[41:40] everything
[41:41] I couldn't understand the news broadcast
[41:43] the other day when uh fox or somebody
[41:46] they had this guy on who was a
[41:48] homosexual and he was very critical of
[41:51] the trans and he was saying we shouldn't
[41:53] make our kids do this and change all
[41:54] this that's wrong it's it's it's it's
[41:56] cruel to children and I'm going why is
[41:59] this homosexual an authority on the
[42:01] subject now
[42:03] like get him out of there he's of The
[42:06] Same Spirit
[42:08] as I tell you friends don't mess with my
[42:10] mind I tell the word quit messing this
[42:12] is a messed up world
[42:14] this is a messed up world I must speak
[42:16] in a few weeks on a few weeks on
[42:18] insanity and insanity is not somebody in
[42:21] an asylum today it's just the form of
[42:24] thinking that we have today that's
[42:27] insane
[42:28] thank God I've got a place to go over a
[42:30] sound mind in a secret place thanks be
[42:33] to God that's all I want I just want to
[42:35] live there I don't want to take the
[42:37] theories that I'm hearing can you say
[42:39] amen and even sometimes bring them up
[42:41] because they're feeding on the wisdom of
[42:42] the world and they're bringing it up you
[42:43] don't live by business by family life
[42:45] you don't live by the wisdom of this
[42:47] world there's a wisdom of God the wisdom
[42:50] of this world is contrary to the wisdom
[42:52] of God
[42:53] don't live by it don't try I'm gonna go
[42:56] to all these seminars and not go to
[42:57] God's word for your business
[43:00] the wisdom of this world is in a
[43:02] conflict to the wisdom of God
[43:05] so that Spirit began to work I didn't
[43:07] expect to say this but it was something
[43:09] that was attached that it was why I I
[43:12] want you to accept me
[43:14] and I want the congregation to accept me
[43:16] and then I just have to say well there's
[43:18] some new congregations out that will
[43:19] accept you so you can go there but I
[43:22] want them to I want people to tolerate
[43:24] it and if you don't accept me at least
[43:25] tolerate me being here and then get
[43:27] around the youth and uh can't happen
[43:29] people get mad sometimes because I just
[43:31] say hey you know we're not going to have
[43:33] that are you going to keep doing that
[43:34] we're not going to have that around the
[43:35] youth group
[43:38] I'm supposed to do that
[43:40] scripture I'm supposed to be that way
[43:42] then I get parents mad at me
[43:44] you say where's the parents at
[43:46] that's my job can you say Matt to
[43:49] protect the people of God protect these
[43:51] young lives these young girls have held
[43:53] their virginity and they've held them
[43:54] and they ought to be able to come to a
[43:57] safe place at a youth meeting they ought
[43:59] to be a safe environment here can you
[44:01] say that so you preach against demon
[44:03] power and if you have to say it
[44:04] personally you're not welcome here until
[44:06] you get delivered to that spirit
[44:13] so the prophet in in relation to this he
[44:16] went to Portland Oregon and he says and
[44:18] many of you has read the story of the
[44:20] maniac I don't have this on the sides I
[44:21] was just going to tell this story in
[44:23] case you don't know it uh the maniac
[44:26] comes to the platform and just as this
[44:28] great big almost 300 pound giant I wait
[44:31] at that time 128 pounds myself and he
[44:33] was close to seven foot great big arms
[44:35] and he comes stomping through the
[44:36] building while I was preaching on faith
[44:38] before about six thousand people raised
[44:40] up to the platform preachers scattered
[44:41] like flies and I wonder what was the
[44:43] matter I thought it might have been
[44:44] someone coming to bring a message to
[44:46] some ministers I turned to look in this
[44:48] great big giant standing there with his
[44:49] chest swelled out and groaning and his
[44:52] teeth sat in his eyes he said you
[44:54] hypocrite up there acting like a man of
[44:56] God I'll break every bone in your body
[44:58] tonight I'm going to knock you Plum out
[45:00] of the middle of this audience to show
[45:01] you whether you're a man of God little
[45:03] did I know that he was out of the insane
[45:05] institution and I Knew by his size he
[45:08] was very able to carry out his threat
[45:10] so I looked at him ordinarily I would
[45:12] have took off with the rest of those
[45:14] preachers but you know what something
[45:16] happened to me
[45:18] now you know the story and he tells it
[45:20] many times it must have been a reason
[45:22] he's leaving this with us is that to
[45:24] realize that he challenged the Demonic
[45:27] power that way in a service very hard
[45:30] very embarrassing very hard but this is
[45:32] demonic power and he actually had he had
[45:34] beat up a preacher come out of the and
[45:36] saying snuck out and beat up a preacher
[45:38] just a few days before he was in the
[45:39] news so the police realized who it was
[45:41] they were come when the police come to
[45:43] try to get him they said no
[45:45] said no this is a spiritual battle going
[45:47] on this is not flesh and blood so he
[45:49] told the police to stay and here's this
[45:51] guy's coming for him and he said
[45:53] ordinary I run off with the rest of
[45:55] preachers but you know something
[45:56] happened if I can only always stay that
[45:58] way something instead of hating the man
[46:00] I felt sorry for him I thought that man
[46:03] wouldn't want to hurt me while he's a
[46:05] man like I am and that's got to be the
[46:07] devil making that man do that so the
[46:09] poor martyr and he rushed up towards me
[46:11] and he hawked down in his throat and he
[46:14] spit right in my face a matter of fact
[46:16] did it two or three times hooked up spit
[46:18] right on his face brother and said it
[46:20] was dripping down my my nose
[46:23] you read all the places to me he said he
[46:26] says now if you had any temper in you
[46:27] whatsoever
[46:30] you're not going to get over this
[46:31] something else has to kick in
[46:34] okay
[46:36] and and you know the story that you know
[46:39] he he tells it many not different ways
[46:41] but he he elaborates it in different
[46:43] places and he's up there he said he
[46:44] could have done what he was carried out
[46:46] to do and uh he he says they spit at him
[46:49] and he's threatening and he told the
[46:51] police to hold back and he says
[46:53] something come over he's oh I wish that
[46:55] would come over me all the time I wish I
[46:56] could be that way but I loved him I
[46:59] loved him and I and I I said he no doubt
[47:01] has a family and it changed the whole
[47:03] atmosphere and he rushed up toward me
[47:05] hawked in his throat and spit in my face
[47:07] this is the one I tried so hard to find
[47:09] and pull it out that's what I want to
[47:11] emphasize and see the devil was trying
[47:15] to get me to shake away from that
[47:18] atmosphere that God was getting me in
[47:26] so this is what I'm preaching to you
[47:28] today the devil it's not good enough for
[47:30] him just to accuse and just to come
[47:32] against you and just no he actually
[47:35] wants to pull you
[47:38] from your atmosphere in your secret
[47:40] place
[47:41] into the same atmosphere as him
[47:45] now you think about that when there's a
[47:47] Family Feud that comes in your family
[47:48] and I know nobody here ever ever has
[47:52] family feuds
[47:54] so just act like you have one sometimes
[47:58] we have them it's you know sometimes we
[48:01] have family feuds and it's just the
[48:03] devil gets working among us and we could
[48:05] be on that show Family Feud I believe we
[48:07] could it's just we we have it and I know
[48:10] none of you ever have it but you think
[48:12] about when a Family Feud comes up and
[48:14] all of a sudden there's a scripture in
[48:15] the New Testament says The Strife of
[48:18] words The Strife of Words which brings
[48:21] envy and strife and all kinds of things
[48:23] and he says it starts with words
[48:26] the strife and there's tension it's just
[48:28] everybody's drawing the lines
[48:31] The Strife of words
[48:34] you know the devil doesn't have to come
[48:36] out with a pitchfork he just gets you
[48:38] talking against one another
[48:40] and strife is there and there's walls up
[48:42] and there's clouds between you and you
[48:44] you can't
[48:45] since the devil working can you say man
[48:48] it's just the enemy working but he's
[48:49] trying to get you he would the devil was
[48:52] trying see that's something we wouldn't
[48:54] know unless he said it is that here's
[48:57] the wisdom and just a son move into an
[48:59] adoption that he can look at a demonic
[49:01] power first of all say I don't need the
[49:02] police Uh something's coming over but
[49:04] while something was coming over him he
[49:07] said he could even detect that the devil
[49:09] was trying to shake me away from the
[49:12] atmosphere that God was getting me in
[49:15] but it didn't bother me
[49:23] forgive me Lord for losing sleep for
[49:25] hours over one little sentence the devil
[49:28] said that's a lie and not the truth
[49:30] somebody say Amen
[49:33] but it didn't bother me because it was a
[49:36] lie it's not the truth
[49:40] we don't give him time we don't give him
[49:43] credit we don't give him the floor
[49:46] we don't let him cause us to lose sleep
[49:49] we don't let some family member that
[49:51] says something that's not true about us
[49:53] just get us in some kind of a mess of
[49:56] nervousness no it shouldn't bother us if
[49:58] it's Elijah and mothers now if it's the
[50:00] truth fess up to it I did wrong but if
[50:03] it's a lie don't give the devil any
[50:05] ground
[50:08] let him dabble in his own lies
[50:11] I've got other things to do with the
[50:13] kingdom that's what my sister Sharon
[50:14] said you know just a few years ago when
[50:16] we have all this pressure to doubt the
[50:18] message all this would all this come up
[50:19] 10 years ago whenever it was my sister
[50:21] Sharon she's had a wonderful thing she
[50:22] said we have too much to be doing for
[50:25] the kingdom of God to be going backwards
[50:27] and worried about that stuff there's too
[50:29] much good to be done can you say Amen
[50:31] get your life focused on the Lord and
[50:33] what you can do for his kingdom not on
[50:36] all the chatter and the gossip
[50:40] praise be to God that's good preaching
[50:42] can you say Amen you need your life
[50:44] focused on the kingdom not on Aunt this
[50:47] and Uncle this and what they said and
[50:49] what the other churches is doing in Lima
[50:51] and Lorraine I don't care God is leading
[50:54] them by the Holy Ghost you find what you
[50:56] need to do for the kingdom of God
[50:59] I'm not in any competition and all that
[51:01] I am not a part of any I don't want to
[51:03] be on the floor for any of that I've got
[51:05] something to do I've got a vision in my
[51:07] heart it's the message of the hour give
[51:09] it to me as many people as you can
[51:13] and if some of you don't want it there's
[51:15] somebody out there that wants this
[51:17] message somebody's hungry for it God's
[51:20] Gonna Fill these front pews with
[51:21] prostitutes and alcoholics this is what
[51:25] a word came from the Lord many years ago
[51:26] he's going to feel these front wheels
[51:28] did you notice nobody's in the front row
[51:31] I don't know what it is this is a good
[51:33] seat up here guys you're missing out I
[51:37] promise I won't spit on you that much
[51:38] but these are good seats and I never see
[51:41] anybody in them I'd love to see my young
[51:44] men and you know my young women right up
[51:46] here shouting me Han
[51:49] the cheerleaders can you say Matt let's
[51:52] do something for the kingdom let's see
[51:54] the devil destroy can you say man let's
[51:55] see his Works destroyed Among Us let's
[51:58] get excited about the kingdom of God not
[52:00] about so and so what they said about our
[52:02] church
[52:04] there's too much to do
[52:06] for the true Kingdom there's too many
[52:08] hungry Souls
[52:09] you're focused on their own thing
[52:12] but he's trying to get me out of the
[52:13] atmosphere so one thing to have things
[52:15] encamped around you it's another thing
[52:17] that they want to drag you down and pull
[52:19] you into it with them how many is
[52:21] everybody had somebody wanting to pull
[52:23] you into a fight with them
[52:27] you're in a good atmosphere you're doing
[52:29] good
[52:30] you're kind of Happy
[52:31] somebody comes in with their stuff
[52:33] and you're there to be a strength to
[52:35] pull them out of that but they're trying
[52:36] to pull you into their their ring and
[52:39] have a boxing match with them
[52:42] draw me into their fear
[52:44] draw me into their scare
[52:47] draw me down to their nervousness
[52:49] draw me into their gossip
[52:52] draw me into their opinions of things
[52:55] draw me into their lies
[52:57] to draw me into their concrete
[52:58] conclusions of the matter already
[53:00] to draw me to
[53:02] brother Daniel when he was here
[53:04] daniofori Darko he said yeah
[53:08] he said the devil has to have company
[53:13] it's not good enough for him to say
[53:15] something he's got to get some recruits
[53:16] and to agree with them
[53:18] tell me I don't know how Spirits work in
[53:20] a local assembly it's looking for allies
[53:23] gossip is looking for allies for support
[53:27] you don't need to do it that way
[53:28] come and be men of God come and talk
[53:30] about it let's look at the word let's
[53:32] look at what's wrong if I'm off this
[53:34] Bible and off this message you have a
[53:36] duty as a brother and sister in Christ
[53:37] to come and tell me
[53:39] but you don't have a duty to tell
[53:41] somebody else
[53:43] it's the wrong way
[53:45] draw me into their competition draw me
[53:47] into their pressure to choose sides with
[53:49] them
[53:50] draw me into and the tone of this world
[53:52] the tone is to turn against one another
[53:54] Jesus said many will betray one another
[53:57] many will turn against one another and
[53:59] they're the extreme divide in our
[54:01] country right now it's amazing but don't
[54:03] just remember there's an extreme spirit
[54:06] in our country
[54:07] to go to extremes against the other
[54:09] person and hate them
[54:11] there's no more respect for them Mark
[54:14] Levin is a conservative talk show host I
[54:16] don't listen to him but the other day he
[54:18] popped on the radio on in the car
[54:20] and he's the one that's always just so
[54:23] vicious you know against the Democratic
[54:25] party and he gets so mad he was so mad
[54:28] when Obama was in and he'd call him this
[54:30] and call him that in and I can only use
[54:32] one term in here I said hey he's got a
[54:35] whiny voice
[54:37] Obama he's an idiot he's he's just an
[54:41] idiot you know and I thought there was a
[54:43] certain respect level for the
[54:44] president's office
[54:46] that we're supposed to have he's an
[54:48] idiot and the other day he's on the
[54:50] Democratic party hates our country all
[54:53] of them hate our country and they want
[54:54] to burn our country to the ground
[54:58] and I sin
[55:00] the whole Democratic Party
[55:03] how does he have the authority to label
[55:05] the whole Democratic party and say they
[55:09] all hate America I know that's not true
[55:13] and message people just join in with it
[55:15] that's right
[55:17] amen mark
[55:20] oh Lord help us
[55:25] brother Brian says both parties are
[55:27] corrupt
[55:29] that's my word
[55:31] from the prophet
[55:32] so he's an idiot and they want to burn
[55:36] our country to the ground I said they do
[55:38] all of them and so I thought of it when
[55:41] it was on there Friday I said this is
[55:43] the tone of the spirit that's here but
[55:47] unfortunately we see it try to come in
[55:48] the church and it shouldn't
[55:51] you could draw the lines
[55:53] dig their heels down I can't dig these
[55:57] too far but they dig their heels down
[55:59] real deep
[56:01] down here you hate me
[56:04] and I hate you and I'm standing for
[56:07] what's right
[56:10] and they realize you've got the spirit
[56:12] of the world they've caught the spirit
[56:13] of the world it's the tone of the world
[56:15] they don't need anybody they don't need
[56:16] the other party they don't need the
[56:18] other believers they don't need
[56:19] oh God help us it's a dangerous time
[56:23] this is spirits of the last days
[56:26] to kill to try to kill the Divine love
[56:29] working amongst the people and it starts
[56:32] with the preachers down including myself
[56:35] we need more Divine love
[56:37] we need a better attitude
[56:39] we need to quit saying
[56:42] I hate this one or I detest this one
[56:45] we need to stop using that
[56:48] we need to hate the devil
[56:53] praise the Lord
[56:57] First Timothy
[56:59] oh I already quoted that
[57:02] so let me try to find a place here on
[57:04] psalms 27 to end now
[57:06] is everybody on the same page
[57:10] I feel like I'm delivering my heart
[57:12] today and I have the freedom to do that
[57:14] thank you for your openness
[57:18] I'm not a polished preacher by any means
[57:21] I don't mean that probably just I'm just
[57:24] not I I stutter sometimes Wednesday
[57:26] night I stuttered a lot
[57:29] and so but I pray the Holy Spirit can
[57:32] get something across to you of my heart
[57:34] I really like I said I just want to be a
[57:37] sincere Christian without guile
[57:39] I just want to be a simple Christian you
[57:40] know I want to preach a message on
[57:42] complicate the devil complicates this
[57:44] message so much he complicates
[57:46] everything
[57:48] this message is not meant to be
[57:50] complicated and don't forget he said in
[57:52] the scripture he says God is not the
[57:55] author of confusion
[57:57] so it's easy to say if there's confusion
[58:00] and doubt and fear and complicated Satan
[58:04] is trying to anoint you with the spirit
[58:05] no it's the Simplicity God in simplicity
[58:10] and if someone's trying to shake you out
[58:12] of that simple life
[58:14] then you just just stand and say Lord
[58:16] hide me
[58:18] hide me
[58:20] let them say what they want to say hide
[58:22] me in your Pavilion I mean you want to
[58:24] be hidden today hide me Lord so I'm not
[58:26] affected by this
[58:28] and if you get in the boat and Jonah
[58:31] gets in your boat if you've got to join
[58:32] in your boat you know what they did with
[58:33] them
[58:35] get off of my boat
[58:37] I mean I know it's a simple little
[58:39] lesson but and you probably learned it
[58:40] in Sunday school but like if you have a
[58:42] Jonah that's running from the presence
[58:44] of the Lord and rebellious and running
[58:46] from the things that's being preached
[58:48] and doing the opposite then get off of
[58:51] my boat
[58:53] God's going to deal with you but don't
[58:55] stay in my boat because if you stay on
[58:57] my boat my boat might start sinking
[59:00] and I don't want my boat to sink
[59:04] get off on my boat Jonah
[59:07] so in Psalms 27
[59:11] I would say this that it's not so much
[59:13] hiding even though he uses that word but
[59:15] when the other words are there when it
[59:17] says he shall lift my head above he
[59:20] shall set me up upon a rock and he shall
[59:22] lift my head above my enemies it's not
[59:25] so much about hiding in this but it's
[59:27] but it's lifting us above it all that we
[59:30] can live above it all
[59:32] set me on a rock above my enemies
[59:35] praising the Lord because it says here
[59:37] he sets me up my head above the enemies
[59:40] how many would say I want to live above
[59:41] my enemies
[59:43] it's another atmosphere it's something
[59:45] else I want to live above it and
[59:47] therefore will I offer in this
[59:49] Tabernacle sacrifices of joy and I will
[59:52] sing yea I will sing praises unto the
[59:55] Lord so David is so confident here he
[59:57] says when you lift me up above my
[1:00:00] enemies you put me in a place set me on
[1:00:02] a rock and you lift me up above my
[1:00:04] enemies that I can at least be above
[1:00:07] them and and then what I'm doing up
[1:00:09] there is I'm praising I will offer the
[1:00:12] sacrifices of joy
[1:00:14] I will just praise the Lord like the
[1:00:17] Brother's song said today I'm not going
[1:00:19] to be shy to praise the Lord
[1:00:22] you know is it wouldn't it be annoying
[1:00:24] is you know David said on the Rock and
[1:00:25] he's just praising the Lord and all his
[1:00:28] enemies are down there and he's not even
[1:00:30] looking at them
[1:00:32] glow repeated God
[1:00:34] praise be to God
[1:00:36] and you start singing like I will not
[1:00:40] come down to the Devils level he set me
[1:00:45] up on a rock can you say Amen I'll pray
[1:00:47] for you my brother but guess what I'm
[1:00:49] not coming down to where you're at
[1:00:52] I don't want your fear I don't want your
[1:00:54] doubts I don't want your nervousness I
[1:00:56] want to live in this secret place above
[1:00:58] my enemies
[1:01:00] and you can imagine if this spirit is
[1:01:03] true that it's always trying to drag you
[1:01:04] down they're not happy that you're up
[1:01:06] there but they're saying hey get down
[1:01:08] here I got something to talk about with
[1:01:10] you get down what do you get down here
[1:01:12] why can't they come up with you
[1:01:15] they might not be called to it but if
[1:01:17] they are they don't want to come up
[1:01:18] there you need to hear my case you need
[1:01:20] to hear my disgrunleness you need to
[1:01:22] hear this get down here
[1:01:25] step off of that chair and get out of
[1:01:29] that place and we're saying no I want to
[1:01:31] live there one thing have I desired
[1:01:36] can you imagine a Believer saying out of
[1:01:40] all the things that we could ask for
[1:01:41] there's really today only one thing I
[1:01:45] want above money possessions retirements
[1:01:50] I know I can say this in my heart above
[1:01:53] a better job above more money above
[1:01:55] retirements above all the things one
[1:01:58] thing is what I really want and I'm
[1:01:59] going to seek after it I want to dwell
[1:02:01] in the house of the Lord every day of my
[1:02:03] life
[1:02:03] I want to stay there I'm going to stay
