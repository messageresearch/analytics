[28:03] we'd appreciate it so much and I'll just
[28:06] take this moment while they're preparing
[28:07] and just say What U just the cream of
[28:10] the crop that's gathered here this year
[28:12] just quality young people uh such a
[28:14] desire for the word and hunger for the
[28:16] word and uh we've heard quite a bit the
[28:18] last couple nights and the servic is
[28:20] just about uh how God looks at his
[28:22] purpose in our life and he looks at us
[28:24] more of his purpose he has for us than
[28:26] our mistakes but I believe some young
[28:28] people that's heard some things to rise
[28:30] above your mistakes put them under the
[28:32] blood and go on with the Lord and I
[28:34] believe that's some of the things he
[28:35] spoke to us is that and you know brother
[28:38] uh Sam was on Jonah a little bit and
[28:40] Jonah is such a strange strange person
[28:42] in the Bible because he doesn't fit the
[28:45] category of maybe a David or something
[28:47] he made a lot of mistakes and ran from
[28:49] the presence of the Lord but he's still
[28:51] in the in the Bible he's still a Son of
[28:53] God and he's an example of some of us
[28:55] where you can't run far enough away from
[28:57] the love of God and so I was great to
[29:00] hear those things and to know that God
[29:02] loves us this much but you're a cream of
[29:04] the crop just wonderful I'm going to
[29:05] brag about you for many months now to
[29:08] that we I was able to be with some of

[34:55] bless you Sister April God bless um I
[34:58] just want to say the inspiration of the
[35:00] song um so Jeremiah in Jeremiah 20 Pasha
[35:04] the priest had thrown him into you know
[35:06] wherever he throw him into um and
[35:09] Jeremiah was feeling really low and
[35:10] really down um but he said how can I be
[35:13] quiet when this fire the word shut up in
[35:16] my bones and he said I won't be quiet
[35:19] I'm going to speak um and my God will
[35:22] deliver me so the song is called it's
[35:24] just like fire okay
[35:34] Jerusalem was a
[35:36] shaken Pentecost had arrived in an upper
[35:41] room party well they were drunk on the
[35:44] new wine but Peter stood among them and
[35:48] he said there is no doubt that this Holy
[35:52] Ghost Fire it will make you dance and
[35:55] Shout it's just like
[35:58] fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy
[36:03] Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones

[36:27] his voice and cry well be quiet folks

[39:58] yes Glory somebody say praise the
[40:02] Lord
[40:05] hallelujah that's the way it is the fire
[40:08] shut up in our bones praise the Lord and
[40:11] your sister April you wrote that song
[40:13] you wrote that song you didn't write it
[40:16] but thanks for sharing it with us praise
[40:18] the Lord she's she's singing at the
[40:20] beginning of the service like we do at
[40:22] the
[40:23] end we're ready to Worship the Lord amen
[40:26] praise God we're going to have the choir
[40:28] come God bless you may be seated the
[40:29] choir prepare and they going to take a
[40:31] minute and I just like to say about
[40:32] songs and worship I you know I don't
[40:35] want to be controversial but you know I
[40:36] think when we worship and y'all listen
[40:38] to me don't look at the
[40:39] choir I I think we should have the
[40:42] freedom to worship I don't think we have
[40:44] to borrow from anybody and I want to
[40:47] thank the Lord for songs that are
[40:49] inspired by the Holy Ghost and sometimes
[40:52] the vessel that actually ends up singing
[40:54] it that we hear it from isn't a great
[40:57] vessel but what I like is if it's been
[40:59] inspired by the Holy Ghost whether it
[41:00] was 50 years ago 100 years ago or
[41:04] whether it is uh just you know two years
[41:07] ago if it's a song inspired in the word
[41:09] of God and inspired of the Holy Ghost
[41:12] but you take a vessel that has got a new
[41:14] birth and they're singing that song it
[41:16] makes all the difference in the world
[41:18] and boy you put that together and I
[41:20] think that's an inspiring thing and so I
[41:22] think that we should be able to be free
[41:24] not have restrictions to our worship I
[41:27] think we ought to be able to just
[41:28] worship and everybody worships different
[41:30] can you say Amen there shouldn't be any
[41:32] a certain category we put us in I think
[41:34] we should just give our hearts and
[41:35] worship to him whether that be weeping
[41:38] or whatever it is some people shout but
[41:40] we should never isolate it just a
[41:42] certain thing and God can be glorified
[41:45] in some of the quietest moments as well
[41:47] how many would raise your hand God can
[41:50] receive worship from your heart in some
[41:51] of the quietest moments and then
[41:54] sometimes it's just time to just really
[41:56] be exuberant and lift our voices to him
[41:58] and our hearts to him and uh when you
[42:00] have a song like sister April just
[42:01] saying it expresses what's in our hearts
[42:03] and we just going to express that to God
[42:05] it it's wonderful praise the Lord thank
[42:07] you sister April again praise the lord
[42:10] well Kenny takes a long time to
[42:12] prepare and uh so but you know he is the
[42:15] music man so uh we'll give him time to
[42:18] do that praise the
[42:22] Lord who need this mic anybody
[42:55] for
[43:00] [Music]
[43:08] [Music]

[1:12:43] altar thus saith the Lord be Behold a
[1:12:47] child shall be born unto the House of
[1:12:50] David Josiah by name
[1:12:53] and upon the shall he offer the priests
[1:12:56] of the high places that burn incense

[1:13:22] but I pray wouldn't be the end I pray it
[1:13:25] would be the beginning for many God that
[1:13:28] would leave here on tomorrow going back
[1:13:30] to their churches getting ready to enter
[1:13:33] into a new year uh may we just spend a
[1:13:36] little time reflecting on all your
[1:13:38] goodness that you gave us throughout
[1:13:40] this year and uh Lord may we uh enter
[1:13:43] into the new year with expectations that
[1:13:45] you would be doing something so much
[1:13:47] greater uh in our hearts than in our
[1:13:49] lives we pray every ear that is here
[1:13:53] with hear the word that you would speak
[1:13:55] to each individual right where they need
[1:13:57] to be spoken to and may you get all the
[1:13:59] glory and all the honor out of the
[1:14:01] service hide me behind the cross I don't
[1:14:03] want to be seen but may Christ be on
[1:14:05] display tonight it's in Jesus Christ's
[1:14:08] name we pray amen amen God bless you you
[1:14:11] can be seated amen um we want to just
[1:14:15] take for a topic tonight born to
[1:14:20] destroy amen born to D
[1:14:24] destroying and
[1:14:26] um for me I um I I enjoy trying to help
[1:14:34] this
[1:14:35] generation see where you fit in the
[1:14:38] economy of
[1:14:40] God um if if if if I could just make it
[1:14:44] very plain every one of you have a
[1:14:46] purpose with God Amen whether it's
[1:14:50] behind the pull pit or not behind the
[1:14:52] pull pit whether is behind an instrument
[1:14:54] not behind an instrument wherever your
[1:14:57] your your part is in the body of Christ
[1:14:59] you play a very vital role amen uh in
[1:15:04] the economy of God I want you to
[1:15:05] understand that you do have purpose each
[1:15:08] one of you have purpose and I I love
[1:15:11] just trying to help this generation see
[1:15:14] uh themselves according to scripture I
[1:15:17] think it's important that sometimes you
[1:15:18] look into the mirror of the word or you
[1:15:21] even look into the mirror of the message
[1:15:23] and you can see that hey this was being
[1:15:25] spoken about
[1:15:27] me amen it's it's one thing for brother
[1:15:31] brandom to see himself in the scripture
[1:15:33] it's another thing for your pastor to be
[1:15:35] able to see himself in the scripture in
[1:15:36] the five-fold ministry but it's a whole
[1:15:39] different thing when you begin to
[1:15:41] recognize who you are in Christ and when
[1:15:45] you get that Revelation when you get
[1:15:46] that understanding it brings you to a
[1:15:49] place of being settled it brings you to
[1:15:51] a place where the enemy can cannot just
[1:15:53] upset you with anything because you know
[1:15:56] who you are in Christ you know God has a
[1:15:59] purpose for you hallelujah amen amen and
[1:16:03] here you know uh I I wanted to remind
[1:16:07] you all of something as we kind of get
[1:16:08] started uh there is a mighty Revival
[1:16:13] that has been promised to your
[1:16:16] generation glory to God I'm going to
[1:16:18] read it for you in a second but there's
[1:16:19] a mighty Revival that has been promised
[1:16:22] to to your generation I want to say this
[1:16:25] it is not a
[1:16:27] manufactured
[1:16:29] Revival we don't have to make anything
[1:16:32] happen amen we don't have to try to do
[1:16:35] anything to to to make God's word come
[1:16:37] to pass if God has spoken it amen then
[1:16:41] it's going to C it's come to come going
[1:16:44] to come to pass whether we believe it or
[1:16:48] not Hallelujah and there's something God
[1:16:51] has spoken over your generation that
[1:16:53] makes you a very special group of
[1:16:56] people hallelujah amen I want to um uh
[1:17:01] just mention the wheels of Prophecy they
[1:17:03] turn slow but yet they're always turning
[1:17:07] all right and uh one
[1:17:10] meeting one service amen one youth
[1:17:15] retreat Hallelujah uh maybe one service
[1:17:18] at your local church at some point in
[1:17:21] time you are going to step right into
[1:17:24] this
[1:17:25] prophecy blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:28] amen your failures can't stop you from
[1:17:31] fulfilling this prophecy all right watch
[1:17:34] it now and and I want to I want to just
[1:17:36] kind of uh maybe uh say something that
[1:17:39] will hopefully strike our faithful
[1:17:40] tonight I know as as I read this in
[1:17:43] Ephesians Church age in a little bit as
[1:17:45] we read this this is a prophecy I
[1:17:47] believe about this generation and um and
[1:17:49] and I want to just say this amen if this
[1:17:52] is not the generation then tell me when
[1:17:55] is that generation going to come amen if
[1:17:58] it's not you that's going to fulfill
[1:18:01] this then tell me who is going to
[1:18:03] fulfill it amen and if it's not here
[1:18:06] then tell me where will it be fulfill
[1:18:09] because I simply want to be a part of
[1:18:11] all that God is doing in this generation
[1:18:15] here in the Ephesians Church age brother
[1:18:17] Brandon makes a statement to us and I
[1:18:19] want you to just catch this very
[1:18:21] carefully is uh explaining the the first
[1:18:26] couple chapters in The Book of
[1:18:27] Revelation here in the church AG book uh
[1:18:30] and he's explaining Revelation 2:4 he
[1:18:33] makes some comments this is his
[1:18:35] commentary amen for this and uh so here
[1:18:39] you know Revelation 2:4 says
[1:18:41] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:18:43] thee because thou Hast left thy first
[1:18:46] love it says to understand this you must
[1:18:49] realize that the spirit is not speaking
[1:18:52] to the the original Saints of Ephesus
[1:18:55] alone Hallelujah this message is to the
[1:18:59] entire age which lasted about 120 years
[1:19:03] its message then is to all generations
[1:19:06] in that span all right it says Now
[1:19:09] history here's the issue history keeps
[1:19:13] repeating itself Amen in the generations
[1:19:16] of Israel we see Revival in one
[1:19:19] generation only to see the fires fading
[1:19:23] in the next in the third Generations in
[1:19:27] in the third generation ambers may be
[1:19:29] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[1:19:31] may be no vestage whatsoever of that
[1:19:35] original flame and I want to just hold
[1:19:38] that thought right there just for a
[1:19:39] second keep that on the screen let's see
[1:19:41] what brother brandom's trying to tell us
[1:19:43] in the first generation there is a
[1:19:45] mighty Revival Hallelujah and and what
[1:19:48] we have to look at let's count it from a
[1:19:50] prophet when God sent a prophet into to
[1:19:53] amen the Earth and and just all the
[1:19:55] meetings and all the services that we
[1:19:57] hear we hear the power of God moving God
[1:20:00] vindicating his Prophet we see and hear
[1:20:02] about the supernatural in his ministry
[1:20:04] What a Mighty move of God took place
[1:20:07] when the prophet was here on Earth amen
[1:20:09] the first generation amen he tells us
[1:20:12] that the fires amen are um I mean
[1:20:14] Revival fires are burning Amen in that
[1:20:16] generation however the Next Generation
[1:20:19] his sons would come along and in that
[1:20:22] generation the fires would start to fade
[1:20:25] hallelujah amen and and and then I have
[1:20:27] to put in my generation I would be
[1:20:29] considered a part of this third
[1:20:31] generation and uh in that third
[1:20:33] generation it's Embers glowing slightly
[1:20:36] now here's what happens in the fourth
[1:20:38] generation in your generation amen there
[1:20:41] says there's no
[1:20:42] vestage whatsoever of that original
[1:20:46] flame it was in your generation
[1:20:49] Hallelujah that we had a group of people
[1:20:51] rise up and begin to to declare
[1:20:53] differently about the message amen there
[1:20:56] were there were some that begin to just
[1:20:57] criticize brother Brandon for all these
[1:20:59] things this it's your generation that
[1:21:01] all kind of stuff hit the internet and
[1:21:03] it wasn't true at all a lot of people
[1:21:05] get tricked by what they see on the
[1:21:06] internet anybody can put anything on the
[1:21:11] internet and let me let me just drop
[1:21:13] this off for you if you're going to try
[1:21:15] to find out whether this message is
[1:21:16] right or not don't search the
[1:21:20] internet because that's not what the
[1:21:22] Bible tells you to do the Bible says
[1:21:24] search the
[1:21:25] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:21:28] have eternal life and they are them that
[1:21:31] testify of me so if you want to find out
[1:21:34] whether the message is right or not
[1:21:35] search the
[1:21:38] scriptures in your generation there was
[1:21:40] no vestage whatsoever of the original
[1:21:42] flame now let me tell you when you look
[1:21:44] at this quote from that angle that is a
[1:21:47] very very Bleak condition but the good
[1:21:49] thing about this quote it does not stop
[1:21:52] there
[1:21:54] the next slide says this Hallelujah then
[1:21:59] God this is in the fourth generation
[1:22:02] then God lights the fire again so when I
[1:22:07] say you are the generation that should
[1:22:09] be expecting a mighty move of God not
[1:22:12] something that you have to manufacture
[1:22:14] it's something that God has promised in
[1:22:16] our generation we've seen the worst but
[1:22:19] now we're preparing to see the best of
[1:22:21] God
[1:22:23] then God lights the fire again and the
[1:22:26] same process is repeated it's simply
[1:22:29] praise God I love this I love just
[1:22:32] reading this over the young people I
[1:22:34] know amen uhh just where to set your
[1:22:37] expectations God has promised to do
[1:22:39] something special in your generation if
[1:22:43] not you who if not here where if not now
[1:22:51] when look at what what the prophet says
[1:22:53] he says then God lies the fire again and
[1:22:55] the same process is repeated it is
[1:22:57] simply the manifestation of the truth
[1:22:59] that God has no grandchildren salvation
[1:23:02] is not passed on by natural birth
[1:23:04] anymore than is there any truth to
[1:23:07] Apostolic secession it isn't in the word
[1:23:10] you start out with truly Born Again
[1:23:12] Believers and when the next Generation
[1:23:13] comes along they're no longer just plain
[1:23:16] Christians but they have taken a
[1:23:18] denominational name and are now Baptist
[1:23:20] methodists Etc that is exactly what they
[1:23:23] are to they are not Christians you have
[1:23:25] to be born of the will of God not the
[1:23:28] will of man to be saved but these folks
[1:23:31] are coming together now by the will of
[1:23:32] man I don't say that some of them aren't
[1:23:35] right with God not for a minute do I say
[1:23:37] that but the original
[1:23:40] fire has died
[1:23:42] down they're not the same anymore the
[1:23:44] original fire has died down but I'm here
[1:23:47] to let you know it's in your generation
[1:23:49] where the original fly fire is lit
[1:23:53] again and let me tell you it's not a
[1:23:55] preacher lighting
[1:23:57] it it's it's not it's not your favorite
[1:24:00] preacher lighting the fire again it's
[1:24:02] not it's not uh some special meeting
[1:24:04] that you got to go to to have the fire
[1:24:06] lit again amen the fire is lit because
[1:24:09] God likes it
[1:24:11] again God does it so you you ought to be
[1:24:14] under expectation wherever you are God
[1:24:16] is about to light the fire
[1:24:19] again I believe the process has already
[1:24:22] be done amen the Bible says in John 10ap
[1:24:26] 10 says the thief cometh not but for to
[1:24:30] steal and to kill and to destroy I am
[1:24:35] come Jesus says I am come that they
[1:24:38] might have life and they might have it
[1:24:40] more
[1:24:41] abundantly now you know when we look at
[1:24:44] you know this uh the subject of Born to
[1:24:47] destroy we look back in the Old
[1:24:49] Testament and that was a wonderful game
[1:24:51] that they were playing there
[1:24:53] uh where you had to kind of choose which
[1:24:54] size I think I would have been out
[1:24:55] really fast cuz which right left which
[1:24:58] way I go I mean you all did a really
[1:25:00] good job with that but uh but in the Old
[1:25:02] Testament when we look back at some of
[1:25:04] the uh Believers in that time period
[1:25:06] they fought physical battles they fought
[1:25:09] physical battles there were physical
[1:25:11] Wars that they had that they endured but
[1:25:13] here in the New Testament in our day it
[1:25:16] becomes a spiritual battle hallelujah
[1:25:20] amen and I would have to say the
[1:25:21] spiritual battles is a probably harder
[1:25:24] amen than the physical battles amen we
[1:25:26] have to go through so much in this
[1:25:28] generation brother Paul brought this out
[1:25:30] on the um on the very first day some of
[1:25:32] the challenges that the young people
[1:25:34] have these are almost like spiritual
[1:25:36] conditions that you're fight fighting
[1:25:39] loneliness
[1:25:40] rejection um uh the standing for the
[1:25:43] standards that we believe in this is
[1:25:45] spiritual right he also mentioned mental
[1:25:47] health spiritual things that you are
[1:25:49] coming against but God has giv you power
[1:25:51] to even overcome the spiritual battles
[1:25:55] hallelujah amen amen I I want to just
[1:25:58] make it very plain you're not you
[1:25:59] weren't born to be destroyed by
[1:26:02] loneliness you were not born to be
[1:26:04] destroyed by
[1:26:05] rejection you were not born to be
[1:26:07] destroyed amen by mental health but
[1:26:11] you're you were born to overcome these
[1:26:14] things all right look at this look at
[1:26:16] what amen um I want to just I was I was
[1:26:20] as I was just putting my notes together
[1:26:21] I said down and say the Lord just kind
[1:26:23] of gave me a little scripture to kind of
[1:26:25] add to this when we talk about spiritual
[1:26:26] battles and last night brother Samuel
[1:26:28] came right up and read the scripture
[1:26:30] that I inserted in my notes I wanted to
[1:26:31] read it again 2 Corinthians chapter 10
[1:26:34] this is the spiritual battle that we're
[1:26:36] in amen 2 Corinthians chap 10:3 it says
[1:26:40] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:26:44] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[1:26:48] of our Warfare are not carnal but Mighty
[1:26:52] through God to the pulling down of
[1:26:56] strongholds Hallelujah if you're going
[1:26:59] to defeat the Devil in the S you're
[1:27:00] going to have to use the word of God and
[1:27:03] let me tell you something the word of
[1:27:04] God is the best weapon you could ever
[1:27:07] have when Jesus was on the earth and
[1:27:10] Satan attacked him with those three wild
[1:27:11] attacks he did not use any Supernatural
[1:27:15] power to defeat the enemy but what Jesus
[1:27:18] used was it is written he kept telling
[1:27:21] the devil it is written you go back in
[1:27:23] Deuteronomy you'll find exactly where it
[1:27:26] was written if you are going to defeat
[1:27:28] your enemy in the upcoming year you got
[1:27:30] to have to know what is written praise
[1:27:34] God you got to use the word to defeat
[1:27:35] your enemy it's the most powerful weapon
[1:27:38] that God has put at your disposal use
[1:27:41] the word of God for the weapons of our
[1:27:44] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[1:27:46] through God to the pulling down of
[1:27:47] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:27:53] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:27:56] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:27:59] bringeth into
[1:28:02] captivity with mental health you
[1:28:04] actually have to bring into captivity
[1:28:07] your
[1:28:08] thoughts and that's not anything your
[1:28:11] pastor has to do for you that's what you
[1:28:13] do for yourself by amen reading the word
[1:28:16] of God listening to the word of God
[1:28:18] hearing the word of God you bring into
[1:28:20] captivity those thoughts that that enemy
[1:28:22] is trying to give you it says bringing
[1:28:25] into captivity every thought to The
[1:28:27] Obedience of Christ and having a
[1:28:30] Readiness and and I like this I love
[1:28:33] this part having a Readiness to Revenge
[1:28:35] all Disobedience I want to just pause
[1:28:38] there just for a second you know we
[1:28:39] talked about that this morning how you
[1:28:42] know we we have a a generation of of of
[1:28:44] of children that are disobedient to
[1:28:46] parents unthankful Unholy
[1:28:48] incontinent however you know if you find
[1:28:51] yourself in that condition this morning
[1:28:53] I I want you to take courage that God
[1:28:54] has given you something you're leaving
[1:28:57] this meeting with something where you
[1:28:59] can have revenge on your
[1:29:04] Disobedience you can actually have
[1:29:06] revenge on your
[1:29:08] Disobedience let your parents see that
[1:29:10] there was a change there the money that
[1:29:12] they invested for you to come if they
[1:29:14] paid for you it did not go in vain have
[1:29:17] revenge on Disobedience look at this and
[1:29:19] having in Readiness to Revenge all
[1:29:22] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:29:26] fulfilled spiritual battles that we
[1:29:29] fight Jesus spoke something in Luke chap
[1:29:34] 4 verse
[1:29:37] 18 Jesus spoke these words it says the
[1:29:40] spirit of the Lord is upon me because
[1:29:43] Heath anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:29:45] to the poor he have sent me to heal the
[1:29:49] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:29:52] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:29:54] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:29:56] are
[1:29:58] bruised verse 19 to preach the
[1:30:00] acceptable year of the Lord and and and
[1:30:02] and I like this you know what Jesus
[1:30:04] saying these are all spiritual
[1:30:06] conditions that people are facing see
[1:30:08] it's not a this is not a physical war
[1:30:11] that we're in but it's a spiritual war
[1:30:13] that we are under glory to God and here
[1:30:16] when he says amen preach the gospel to
[1:30:18] the poor this is not people without any
[1:30:19] money in their pocket these are people
[1:30:21] that pour in their
[1:30:24] Spirit some some situation some
[1:30:26] circumstance has happened and it caused
[1:30:28] them to get down in their Spirit but
[1:30:30] it's the gospel that lifs you up into a
[1:30:34] Victorious
[1:30:35] position he also says this amen he sent
[1:30:38] me to heal the
[1:30:40] brokenhearted and and and and what this
[1:30:42] is is is it's it's the Brokenhearted
[1:30:45] means people that have been overwhelmed
[1:30:46] by grief or
[1:30:49] disappointment Hallelujah he sent me to
[1:30:52] heal the brokenhearted and and we got a
[1:30:54] couple people uh in Scripture that we
[1:30:56] can look at but one in particular was
[1:30:58] the brothers that were on the road to
[1:30:59] emus they were
[1:31:01] brokenhearted they thought for sure that
[1:31:03] Jesus would come and do certain things
[1:31:05] and it didn't go the way that they
[1:31:07] thought it was supposed to go so they
[1:31:08] were brokenhearted on their way back to
[1:31:10] their old churches and Jesus had to stop
[1:31:13] amen the Bible says he was a stranger
[1:31:15] that just appeared as they were walking
[1:31:17] on the road to emus and what he did
[1:31:20] Hallelujah he didn't use any
[1:31:22] Supernatural power first what he did was
[1:31:24] take them through the
[1:31:26] scriptures he began to reveal to them
[1:31:28] did not this Jesus fulfill this and did
[1:31:31] not this Jesus fulfill that did not this
[1:31:33] Jesus they had no idea they were talking
[1:31:35] to Jesus but when he got behind closed
[1:31:39] doors Hallelujah after they had got
[1:31:41] encouraged by the word of God they
[1:31:43] invited him to to come in and come
[1:31:45] behind the closed doors please stay with
[1:31:47] us Jesus don't go anywhere please come
[1:31:49] and stay when he got behind closed doors
[1:31:51] this is when he worked his Supernatural
[1:31:53] power he began to break bread in only a
[1:31:56] way that Jesus could break bread and
[1:31:59] when they saw him break bread he
[1:32:01] disappeared they realized he was
[1:32:04] risen but what encouraged him it wasn't
[1:32:06] the supernatural first that comes after
[1:32:09] the revelation of the
[1:32:12] word we got to be settled on the
[1:32:16] word see he he brought healing to the
[1:32:19] broken heart he sent me to heal the
[1:32:20] brokenhearted he brought it through the
[1:32:22] word you know if you go back to the very
[1:32:24] first day brother brother Paul was
[1:32:26] taking us back to Psalms 1 and and
[1:32:28] reading that and showing how you know
[1:32:30] how you become stable how you become
[1:32:32] stable it's it's it's all applying the
[1:32:34] word of God watch this he also said that
[1:32:39] uh Jesus said he was coming to preach
[1:32:41] Deliverance to the captives and a
[1:32:43] captive is a person who has been taken
[1:32:46] prisoner amen and and and maybe it's not
[1:32:49] by their own will they've been taken
[1:32:51] prisoner some of Y all uh I'm sure amen
[1:32:54] the enemy has treding to take you
[1:32:55] prisoner for the entire year this year
[1:32:58] but somehow you made it to these
[1:32:59] meetings by the grace of God you're here
[1:33:03] amen and and we just kept hearing this
[1:33:05] theme as as uh as the Lord was using
[1:33:07] Brother Browning it's not our failures
[1:33:10] that God is looking at you may even get
[1:33:13] up from these meetings and you may go
[1:33:16] right into the next year you may fall
[1:33:18] again but don't look at your failure
[1:33:19] look at God's promise that he's given to
[1:33:22] you there is coming a time that you will
[1:33:24] not fall
[1:33:29] anymore you're going to get you're going
[1:33:31] to get victory over that that thing is
[1:33:33] not here to destroy you you will destroy
[1:33:40] it and and and I'm here to tell you you
[1:33:42] were born to destroy
[1:33:46] it here I want you to stay with me here
[1:33:48] it says uh you know a pre prisoner amen
[1:33:52] preach Deliverance to the captive
[1:33:53] captive is a person who's been taken
[1:33:55] prisoner and it's against their own will
[1:33:57] Legion was a man like that that was
[1:33:59] taken into prison it was against his own
[1:34:01] will now I need you to understand how
[1:34:02] Legion got into the condition he was in
[1:34:05] how did this man get 2,000 demons in
[1:34:08] him what happened to this man how I mean
[1:34:11] it's not you know young people you don't
[1:34:12] just go out there and do something in
[1:34:13] 2,000 demons entering you just like that
[1:34:16] it doesn't happen like that but brother
[1:34:18] brandom tells us what happened this man
[1:34:21] was asked the question and and he
[1:34:23] decided to lie with the answer and when
[1:34:27] he lied with the answer he said a demon
[1:34:30] stepped into him and then he tells
[1:34:32] another lie and another demon steps into
[1:34:35] him and then he tells another lie and
[1:34:37] another demon then he takes a drink and
[1:34:39] another demon then he takes a smoke and
[1:34:41] another demon before before you know the
[1:34:43] man is filled with 2,000 demons but it
[1:34:47] all came from telling One
[1:34:50] Lie
[1:34:52] but I want you to understand even though
[1:34:53] that man was in that condition as bad as
[1:34:55] it was away from his family kicked out
[1:34:57] of his house away from his family Jesus
[1:34:59] saw it necessary to go to the other side
[1:35:02] to bring Deliverance to that one man it
[1:35:05] shows you the value of one soul to the
[1:35:07] Lord Jesus and if the Lord Jesus would
[1:35:09] go across a stormy sea to rescue one man
[1:35:13] what would he do for you
[1:35:17] tonight there another beautiful thing I
[1:35:19] love about the story when Legion got set
[1:35:24] free those demons when they when they
[1:35:27] when they saw Jesus coming the demons
[1:35:29] asks says hey we don't want to go into
[1:35:32] the abyss but let us go into the swine
[1:35:36] and Jesus said sure you can go to the
[1:35:38] swine and here's the beautiful point
[1:35:40] that I like if
[1:35:44] demons can get their prayer
[1:35:50] answered
[1:35:54] I don't know if you heard it if
[1:35:57] demons can get their prayer
[1:36:00] answered what about Sons and Daughters
[1:36:02] of
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:09] God you should not leave here with that
[1:36:12] that type of thought in your mind that
[1:36:14] my prayer was not a demon got his prayer
[1:36:17] 2,000 demons got their prayer answered
[1:36:26] he won't he won't forget about you I can
[1:36:27] tell you that much right
[1:36:30] now preach Deliverance to the the
[1:36:32] captives he also said recovering of
[1:36:34] sight to the Blind and and I love this
[1:36:37] because if you're recovering sight that
[1:36:39] means somebody used to be able to see
[1:36:42] but they lost their
[1:36:44] eyesight somebody used to be able to see
[1:36:46] the truth but they lost their eyesight
[1:36:49] but Jesus comes to rec cover sight to
[1:36:52] the
[1:36:56] blind don't give up on
[1:36:59] anybody these are promises that we have
[1:37:01] in the scripture amen the other one that
[1:37:03] says he come to set at Liberty them that
[1:37:05] are
[1:37:06] bruised and and you know uh brother
[1:37:09] brother brother Browning as he went
[1:37:10] through Georgie Carter you're talking
[1:37:13] about a person being bruised a person
[1:37:16] that amen probably uh you know with what
[1:37:19] she was a piano player but going to
[1:37:21] piano practice her her uncle takes
[1:37:23] advantage of her rapes her terrible
[1:37:27] situation for her to be in and she
[1:37:28] develops this condition but yet God was
[1:37:30] send his Prophet right down to mil toown
[1:37:33] in order to pray for this young lady and
[1:37:35] when she got delivered Hallelujah she
[1:37:38] went out with her hands lifted praising
[1:37:40] God but went right back to the piano the
[1:37:42] very thing she might have amen she might
[1:37:44] despise I don't want to play the piano
[1:37:47] no more but she said no I go right back
[1:37:49] to the piano and I offer my praise to of
[1:37:52] God you're talking about somebody that
[1:37:55] was
[1:37:57] bruised but they were set at Liberty and
[1:38:00] I don't believe God allowed brother
[1:38:02] brother uh brother Browning to share
[1:38:04] that with us because he knows that
[1:38:06] there's might be somebody here that's
[1:38:07] been
[1:38:08] bruised bruises happen on the inside
[1:38:11] before they show on the
[1:38:14] outside before you see the mark on the
[1:38:16] outside there's something going on in
[1:38:17] the inside and and and what happens with
[1:38:19] people in their bruise something happens
[1:38:21] spiritually something happens mentally
[1:38:23] they get discouraged before it starts
[1:38:24] showing up on the outside but he comes
[1:38:26] to set at Liberty the Lord Jesus does
[1:38:30] this he comes to set at Liberty those
[1:38:32] that have been
[1:38:36] bruised the last thing he does is to
[1:38:38] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:38:40] and that is nothing more than the Year
[1:38:42] of Jubilee and I love that because we
[1:38:45] understand that whenever the gospel s
[1:38:47] the gospel sounds you can enter into
[1:38:49] Jubilee right then you don't have to
[1:38:51] wait 49 years you don't have to wait 50
[1:38:54] years you can enter your Jubilee as soon
[1:38:56] as you hear the gospel sound soon as God
[1:38:59] speaks to your condition you can accept
[1:39:02] your
[1:39:05] Jubilee brother Jack you don't know what
[1:39:07] I just did last night it doesn't matter
[1:39:09] have you heard the Jubilee trumpet
[1:39:11] sound if you hear the Jubilee trumpet
[1:39:13] sound for you you you no longer go back
[1:39:15] to that lifestyle drop whatever you were
[1:39:18] doing praise God you might have to
[1:39:21] delete some telephone numbers from your
[1:39:23] phone you might not be able to finish
[1:39:26] that text that you were about to
[1:39:28] send Hallelujah you might not be able to
[1:39:30] send that DM that you were going to send
[1:39:32] you can delete all that drop all those
[1:39:34] things behind you and enter into the
[1:39:36] Jubilee that God has for
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:44] you brother Brandon makes a statement in
[1:39:47] the message the infallible proof of the
[1:39:50] Resurrection
[1:39:52] says now when God promised a royal seed
[1:39:56] that would come forth as a
[1:39:59] savior he says it's been the work of
[1:40:03] God's enemy the devil to try to destroy
[1:40:07] that seed all the way
[1:40:09] down says the first thing when the
[1:40:12] righteous son was born Abel and the
[1:40:15] unrighteous was born Cain first he slew
[1:40:17] Abel thinking he was getting that
[1:40:19] righteous seed
[1:40:21] for he was standing there when God
[1:40:23] promised the Everlasting Earthly
[1:40:25] judgments upon the people and upon the
[1:40:27] serpent and upon the ground he promised
[1:40:29] through the woman would come a seed and
[1:40:32] this seed would bruise the Serpent's
[1:40:35] head and the serpent fought at that seed
[1:40:38] all down through the age and he's still
[1:40:41] fighting
[1:40:44] it that's why you're in the battle that
[1:40:46] you're in it's Amen Satan
[1:40:49] realizes Satan realizes who you
[1:40:53] are you may not realize who you are but
[1:40:56] Satan realizes who you are you are a
[1:40:59] daughter and a son of
[1:41:03] God Satan realizes that so he
[1:41:06] fights it says he's still fighting it he
[1:41:09] goes on he says then when he slew Abel
[1:41:12] he thought he got it because he
[1:41:13] destroyed the only righteous part of the
[1:41:17] seed then God raised up Seth to take his
[1:41:21] place a beautiful type of the death of
[1:41:24] Christ and the resurrection of Christ
[1:41:26] and then uh and and then he thought that
[1:41:28] he had him when he got the
[1:41:30] prophets he thought he had him when he
[1:41:32] got John but when he finally slew the
[1:41:35] righteous seed and he was buried on the
[1:41:37] third day God raised him from the dead
[1:41:39] the Lord Jesus he thought he had him but
[1:41:42] when he rose again he realized he had
[1:41:44] more trouble on his
[1:41:47] hands Satan has always been after the
[1:41:50] Royal
[1:41:51] seat now here in the Bible amen 1 John
[1:41:55] 3:8 we want to re read a scripture here
[1:41:57] in 1 John 38 it says
[1:41:59] this he that committeth sin is of the
[1:42:04] devil for the devil sinth from the
[1:42:08] beginning for the for this purpose
[1:42:11] Hallelujah since the devil's been
[1:42:13] sinning from the beginning for this
[1:42:15] purpose the Son of God was
[1:42:18] manifested what was the purpose of Jesus
[1:42:20] coming
[1:42:22] it wasn't just Amen to uh uh to go to a
[1:42:26] Manger amen and we all hear the
[1:42:28] Christmas story and and we just fall in
[1:42:30] love with the baby Jesus that was not
[1:42:32] the simple reason that he came
[1:42:35] Hallelujah it wasn't just to work
[1:42:36] miracles while he was on the earth amen
[1:42:39] uh he went to a the cross and wasn't
[1:42:42] just to go to a cross and die hallelujah
[1:42:45] hallelujah but when he rose again he
[1:42:48] changed everything for mankind am amen
[1:42:51] and here the purpose that Jesus came the
[1:42:53] scripture says the Son of God was
[1:42:55] manifested I like this that he might
[1:42:59] destroy the works of the devil the
[1:43:03] reason Jesus came amen is so he could
[1:43:06] destroy the works of the devil the
[1:43:08] reason Jesus has come into you is so
[1:43:12] that you also can rise up and destroy
[1:43:16] the works of the
[1:43:17] devil not be defeated by the work works
[1:43:20] of the devil destroy the works of the
[1:43:23] devil you were born to
[1:43:30] destroy this word destroy in this
[1:43:33] scripture I looked at it in the Hebrew
[1:43:35] or the Greek Lexicon and it means to
[1:43:38] ruin or
[1:43:40] demolish I wonder if there's a group of
[1:43:42] young people amen that can be honest
[1:43:45] with yourself I'm tired of going through
[1:43:47] the cycle that the enemy has had me on
[1:43:49] for this for this this this entire year
[1:43:52] amen I'm tired of the up and down in my
[1:43:54] life I'm I'm tired that I don't want to
[1:43:57] go into the next year with that same
[1:43:59] Devil with that same problem if there's
[1:44:02] any young people that feels that way I'm
[1:44:04] here to tell you tonight that God has
[1:44:06] allowed you to come into this Earth so
[1:44:08] you can demolish you can destroy you can
[1:44:12] ruin the plans of the
[1:44:16] enemy Hallelujah that's the very purpose
[1:44:19] for you to have the Holy Ghost so you
[1:44:21] can
[1:44:24] destroy it it's one thing when we call
[1:44:26] on the Lord Jesus and he comes to
[1:44:28] destroy but it's a whole another thing
[1:44:29] when you begin to chop Philistines and
[1:44:31] you begin to defeat them your your own
[1:44:33] self it's a whole different
[1:44:35] story Hallelujah when we get around the
[1:44:38] table in heaven all of us that have a
[1:44:40] testimony we can tell brother random say
[1:44:42] it's not God God can't uh pull you
[1:44:45] through and push you through amen and
[1:44:48] then stand on the other end and say
[1:44:51] blessed is he that overcame what did you
[1:44:54] overcome you he pulled you through he
[1:44:57] pushed you through how did you overcome
[1:44:59] what did you actually do to
[1:45:02] overcome so you have to develop your own
[1:45:05] testimony so you got to have to get back
[1:45:07] to the word yourself and get strength
[1:45:09] from the word yourself and you can say I
[1:45:11] I stood on the word of God I stood on
[1:45:14] this promise and when Satan came I said
[1:45:16] it is written and when I did that
[1:45:19] Hallelujah I got victory over the devil
[1:45:23] it's not just a feeling it's not just an
[1:45:25] emotion yes that could come but first
[1:45:28] it's a revelation of the
[1:45:30] word and your position in the
[1:45:34] word destroyed means to ruin or
[1:45:39] demolish I just feel like the Holy Ghost
[1:45:41] is going to ruin Satan's plans for your
[1:45:44] life in the upcoming
[1:45:46] year demolish those plans for your life
[1:45:49] in the upcoming coming year no I'm not
[1:45:52] I'm not going back to what I used to
[1:45:54] be amen I didn't come to the retreat
[1:45:57] just to say I came to the retreat I come
[1:45:59] to get something from God and whether I
[1:46:01] feel it or not I still got
[1:46:05] it that's
[1:46:10] right this destroy also means to loose
[1:46:14] any person or thing tied down or
[1:46:19] fastened
[1:46:21] this word destroy is to loose any person
[1:46:23] that's or thing that's tied down or fast
[1:46:26] if you've been tied down by the enemy
[1:46:28] the word of God comes to loose
[1:46:32] you brother randam says he's been trying
[1:46:34] to destroy that Royal
[1:46:37] seat ever since uh Cain and Abel he been
[1:46:41] trying Satan's been trying to destroy
[1:46:42] the Royal seat we he told us that he
[1:46:44] tried to destroy them Jesus and we know
[1:46:46] at the birth of our Lord Joseph and Mary
[1:46:49] had to travel uh back to their their
[1:46:52] their native land and their native City

[1:46:56] some edict that was passed down by the
[1:46:57] ruler of that day and and here Mary is
[1:47:00] in her third trimester probably one of
[1:47:03] the most sensitive times for a woman to

[1:47:08] trimester but asked to go back to this

[1:47:15] back of a donkey my God think about how
[1:47:18] hard this was but you know what because
[1:47:20] of Jesus purpose to come to the Earth
[1:47:22] and destroy the works of the devil God
[1:47:25] had to watch over Mary as she was
[1:47:27] traveling on the back of a donkey I want
[1:47:30] to tell you something because you have
[1:47:32] also been ordained by God to destroy the
[1:47:35] works of the devil God has been watching

[1:47:40] took you out this year an accident that
[1:47:43] you might have had death should have
[1:47:44] took you but God watched over
[1:47:48] you you have a
[1:47:50] purpose your purpose is simply to
[1:47:53] destroy the works of the
[1:47:58] devil Jesus amen uh uh the the the Satan
[1:48:02] tried to destroy Jesus at his birth also
[1:48:06] we know that uh when uh Herod heard amen
[1:48:08] about the Christ child being born he
[1:48:10] also sent out of edict that he was going
[1:48:12] to try to kill all the children two
[1:48:14] years old and under Satan was trying to
[1:48:16] destroy that Royal seat when Jesus went
[1:48:19] on the stormy sea to go across the other
[1:48:21] side Satan swore that he would drown him
[1:48:23] in the boat but his spoke peace be still
[1:48:26] Satan trying to destroy the Royal seat
[1:48:29] even at the cross Satan thought that he
[1:48:32] got the victory but according to First
[1:48:35] Corinthians 15 and 26 hallelujah amen
[1:48:40] The Last
[1:48:42] Enemy that shall be
[1:48:45] destroyed is death and when Jesus rose
[1:48:50] again he destroyed the works of the
[1:48:56] enemy that same power that Rose Christ
[1:49:00] from the grave that same power is
[1:49:03] dwelling inside of
[1:49:05] you you're not here to be defeated by
[1:49:08] anything the enemy has to offer but
[1:49:11] you've been born for a purpose you've
[1:49:13] been born for a reason you had to come
[1:49:15] in this
[1:49:17] generation and your purpose is to
[1:49:19] destroy destroy the works of the
[1:49:23] enemy Satan has tried to destroy God's
[1:49:27] seed we see it amen we saw in Abel Seth
[1:49:31] took his place brother brandom said that
[1:49:33] was a type of the
[1:49:34] Resurrection also he tried to do it in
[1:49:37] Moses when Moses was born Moses was hid
[1:49:41] for three months by his parents and then
[1:49:43] he had to be let go by his parents and
[1:49:45] pushed out into the river amen the N
[1:49:47] River and as Moses went out there into
[1:49:49] that River what a beautiful story
[1:49:51] Hallelujah as as his parents released
[1:49:54] him to the Nile River God orchestrated
[1:49:56] that not one snake not one alligator
[1:49:59] nothing would come against Moses while
[1:50:00] he was out there in the river if God
[1:50:03] protected Moses on the river God has
[1:50:05] been protecting you also in your River
[1:50:08] of
[1:50:14] Life Moses got down into the house there
[1:50:18] of pharaoh is Pharaoh's daughter takes
[1:50:19] some
[1:50:21] amen and and I just love the way God
[1:50:23] works when Pharaoh daughter takes men
[1:50:25] Moses his sister was the Spy watching
[1:50:28] what was happening to the the little
[1:50:29] little basket and when she saw that
[1:50:32] Pharaoh's daughter uh had uh had Moses
[1:50:34] she says do you need a a nurse do you
[1:50:36] need a a mother to come take care of
[1:50:38] this baby for you do you need somebody
[1:50:40] that can help help you and assist you
[1:50:41] with the baby she said yes I need
[1:50:43] somebody she went running back to her
[1:50:45] house she says Mama they need a
[1:50:48] babysitter for the baby
[1:50:51] and do you realize the way God does
[1:50:54] it he blessed Moses mama with a job
[1:50:59] inside of Pharaoh's Court to take care
[1:51:02] of her own baby and to be paid for
[1:51:09] it nobody can do things like our God
[1:51:14] can here Satan is trying to destroy it
[1:51:17] but God is using it as a blessing
[1:51:22] he tried to destroy the Hebrew boys when
[1:51:24] he threw them in the
[1:51:27] fire he tried to destroy Daniel in the
[1:51:29] Lion's Den but God brought him
[1:51:33] out he tried to destroy the entire
[1:51:35] nation of Israel when David amen was
[1:51:38] just a Shepherd watching over sheep but
[1:51:40] one day he shows up to bring his
[1:51:42] brothers some food and as he's bringing
[1:51:44] food there to his brothers he hears this
[1:51:45] boast from this Giant Goliath says you
[1:51:48] know what we every everybody don't have
[1:51:50] to die just send one man out here and if
[1:51:52] I defeat him then you all serve us for
[1:51:55] the rest of your days and but if if if
[1:51:57] he defeats me then we'll serve y'all let
[1:51:58] me tell you something never try to make
[1:52:01] an agreement with the devil because
[1:52:03] he'll never keep his side of the
[1:52:07] bargain David heard it David says who is
[1:52:10] this uncircumcised Philistine that's
[1:52:12] coming against the armies of the Living
[1:52:14] God who is this
[1:52:16] man David was willing to go into battle
[1:52:19] and and I and I like this because as
[1:52:21] David prepared to go to battle amen and
[1:52:24] we all know the story that he defeated
[1:52:25] Goliath but you know as he was preparing
[1:52:27] to go to battle Saul says David why
[1:52:29] don't you take my armor why don't you
[1:52:30] take this and why don't you do that and
[1:52:32] why don't you do this and and and and I
[1:52:33] thought now if Saul was so confident in
[1:52:36] his
[1:52:38] armor why did not Saul take that same
[1:52:42] armor and go fight
[1:52:47] Goliath see Saul wanted to Glory for the
[1:52:51] battle but he didn't want to go out and
[1:52:53] do the battle I think we have some young
[1:52:55] people that's willing to go out and do
[1:52:58] battle we don't just want glory for we
[1:53:00] want to get out and actually have a
[1:53:02] battle we want to show the devil that we
[1:53:06] are victorious that we are more than
[1:53:08] conquerors through Christ
[1:53:11] Jesus no we have a group of young people
[1:53:14] that's not going to run from the devil
[1:53:16] but they'll run to the trial they'll
[1:53:18] they'll face the next year with courage
[1:53:21] knowing that God will give them the
[1:53:22] victory in it David went out there and
[1:53:25] took his five stones in his sling and he
[1:53:27] took the giant down and then not only
[1:53:29] took the giant down but took the Giant's
[1:53:31] sword and cut off his head with his
[1:53:34] sword what a mighty God we
[1:53:37] serve David was raised up for a purpose
[1:53:42] David was raised up to
[1:53:44] destroy my God Amen uh I I I I want to
[1:53:48] just go back to our scripture that that
[1:53:49] we we read here in First Kings amen
[1:53:53] chapter
[1:53:54] 13 when you look at amen this passage it
[1:54:00] was uh a prophecy of a of a
[1:54:03] young baby that would be
[1:54:05] born by the name of
[1:54:08] Josiah and uh what we see is a we see a
[1:54:11] problem right at the very first verse
[1:54:13] where it says behold there came a man of
[1:54:14] God out of Judah by the word of the Lord
[1:54:17] unto bethl and jerob stood by the altar
[1:54:20] to burn incense jerbo happened to be the
[1:54:23] leader amen at this time the the Kingdom
[1:54:26] of Israel was splitting he was leading
[1:54:29] and um and here he had a couple tribes
[1:54:32] that were following him and uh and in
[1:54:34] this he built a altar or he built amen a
[1:54:38] sanctuary for the people to come into
[1:54:39] him to worship say don't go back to
[1:54:41] Jerusalem and worship because if you go
[1:54:43] there your hearts might actually turn
[1:54:45] and you might want to start uh uh uh you
[1:54:47] might want to join up with the other
[1:54:48] group but but and and rather than you
[1:54:50] join up with that other group rather
[1:54:51] you're going back to the place that God
[1:54:53] established for you to go worship let's
[1:54:55] just build these altars
[1:54:57] here he build these false places of
[1:55:00] worship hallelujah amen and and and jbam
[1:55:04] amen as he's going there and he's taking
[1:55:06] the sacrifices to this this false place
[1:55:08] of worship a prophet shows up on the
[1:55:11] scene and this is a young Prophet that
[1:55:13] shows up and in verse two what happens
[1:55:16] he cried
[1:55:17] out against the altar in the word of the
[1:55:20] Lord and said oh altar
[1:55:23] altar thus saith the Lord Behold a child
[1:55:28] shall be born into the house of David
[1:55:31] Josiah by name and upon thee upon thee
[1:55:34] shall he offer the priest of the high
[1:55:36] places that burn incense upon thee and
[1:55:38] men's bones shall be burnt upon thee now
[1:55:41] when this Prophet Cried Out amen and and
[1:55:44] gave his prophecy about Josiah coming uh
[1:55:47] it said Josiah is going to destroy this
[1:55:49] that you all built up there's a young
[1:55:51] baby coming one day his name will be
[1:55:53] Josiah and he will destroy what you all
[1:55:55] just did and here you know when uh uh
[1:55:59] when when when when jobal hears this
[1:56:00] prophecy he reaches out to try to grab
[1:56:03] amen this Prophet that spoke to him and
[1:56:04] his arm withered up right there on the
[1:56:07] spot now here's the sad part that I find
[1:56:10] is that when when he reached and grabbed
[1:56:12] this prophet and his arm with it up what
[1:56:14] he did it say please pray for me that my
[1:56:16] arm would be restored and the prophet
[1:56:19] prayed and his arm was restored but you
[1:56:21] know after he received that great
[1:56:23] miracle his heart did not
[1:56:27] change and here's here's here's here
[1:56:30] here here here's the problem often times
[1:56:32] people can come into Services they can
[1:56:35] experience the power of God they can
[1:56:37] experience the presence of God but in
[1:56:38] the inside their hearts do not
[1:56:43] change what good is it to experience the
[1:56:45] presence of God if your
[1:56:47] heart is not going to change
[1:56:54] Josiah uh uh this young Prophet that
[1:56:57] prophesies of Josiah he took off running
[1:57:00] and as I was sharing with my uh my uh my
[1:57:03] my my my my my uh group this morning
[1:57:07] amen that you know in the in the Book of
[1:57:09] Ezekiel it talks about when they would
[1:57:11] come to church they' come in through one
[1:57:12] gate and have to leave through another
[1:57:14] and if someone come through the south
[1:57:15] gate make sure they left through the
[1:57:16] north gate if you come through the north
[1:57:18] gate make sure you leave through the
[1:57:19] South
[1:57:20] and I said the reason that they had to
[1:57:21] do this is because when you come into
[1:57:23] the house of God you were supposed to
[1:57:24] leave different than the way you
[1:57:28] came and this the same thing that
[1:57:30] happened here in First Kings 13 this
[1:57:32] young man could not go back the same way
[1:57:34] he came and and I'm telling you young
[1:57:36] people don't leave this youth retreat
[1:57:39] the same way you
[1:57:41] came be determined to be
[1:57:45] different this young man left the the
[1:57:48] the sad part about about the story of
[1:57:50] this young Prophet is that he got
[1:57:53] tricked by an older
[1:57:55] Prophet a older Prophet heard about the
[1:57:58] prophecy and he sent his sons down there
[1:58:00] and he says hey go get that man and tell
[1:58:02] him to come to my house and God had told
[1:58:03] that young Prophet don't eat with
[1:58:05] anybody don't fellowship with anybody
[1:58:07] just go give the prophecy and leave go
[1:58:08] home but he got tricked the the the the
[1:58:11] older Prophet went and visit said look
[1:58:12] God told me to tell you to come to my
[1:58:16] house now young people I'm saying this
[1:58:18] and this is very important for you in
[1:58:19] this
[1:58:21] generation Hallelujah I just sit here
[1:58:24] this morning and told you how you have
[1:58:25] to respect your elders but remember the
[1:58:27] first the first part of that verse honor
[1:58:29] your parents obey your parents in the
[1:58:34] Lord because you're living in a
[1:58:36] generation where even
[1:58:38] pastors are walking away from the word
[1:58:42] of God and you can't follow a man as he
[1:58:45] leaves the word brother brandom says
[1:58:47] when a man leaves the word you leave the
[1:58:48] man
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:58:51] the word has to be first and foremost in
[1:58:53] your life that's right and if you can't
[1:58:56] take a take an example of this young man
[1:58:58] in the scripture he he he followed this
[1:59:00] older Prophet back to his house sat down
[1:59:03] in his house they prepared a meal he sat
[1:59:05] down and ate enjoyed the meal and while
[1:59:07] he was eating the old Prophet rose up
[1:59:09] and said thus saith the
[1:59:12] Lord because you did not follow God a
[1:59:16] lion will be waiting for you as you're
[1:59:18] going home
[1:59:19] and the young Prophet after he
[1:59:21] prophesied this great thing about Josiah
[1:59:23] this young Prophet lost his life because
[1:59:25] he did not fully obey
[1:59:32] God years later Josiah comes on the
[1:59:35] scene I'll just tell you where you can
[1:59:37] find it but in second cor 2 Kings 23
[1:59:40] you'll see where he destroyed so many
[1:59:42] altars his prophecy was being fulfilled
[1:59:45] this this young young prophet's prophecy
[1:59:47] was being fulfilled Jeremiah Was
[1:59:49] destroying so many altars and one of the
[1:59:52] things that Jeremiah uh I'm sorry Josiah
[1:59:55] uh uh destroyed was even this the
[1:59:57] temples that Solomon built for his his
[2:00:00] his ungodly wives Josiah had a a serious
[2:00:04] Revival in the midst of Israel he
[2:00:08] destroyed everything I want to tell you
[2:00:10] something
[2:00:11] Josiah his purpose he was an
[2:00:15] eight-year-old King but his purpose for
[2:00:17] coming to the Earth was to destroy
[2:00:19] destroy all the false
[2:00:21] altars that were built

[2:02:45] devil is that right it says you all
[2:02:48] believe that
[2:02:49] that's that's uh what was he God's word
[2:02:52] which destroys the works of the hybrid
[2:02:54] Christ was the word which destroys the
[2:02:58] works of the hybrid the devil is that
[2:03:00] right he he has uh he was done uh he he
[2:03:04] was done or born to do that he was born
[2:03:06] to be that to destroy the works of the
[2:03:10] devil but the prophet didn't leave it on
[2:03:13] Jesus the next statement says now his
[2:03:17] body that's who is the body of Christ
[2:03:21] you are the body of Christ now his body
[2:03:24] is to do the
[2:03:27] same no you are not supposed to be
[2:03:30] defeated by mental health no you're not
[2:03:33] supposed to be defeated by loneliness
[2:03:36] you're not supposed to be defeated by
[2:03:39] any of these things that the enemy is
[2:03:40] throwing in your direction amen you were
[2:03:44] born you were created to destroy these
[2:03:47] things
[2:03:51] [Applause]
[2:03:53] somebody else say their testimony is I'm
[2:03:55] I I've been overcome by this no my
[2:03:57] testimony is I overcame
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:02] it I love the statement that brother
[2:04:05] Zion was making there it says you know
[2:04:08] you're you're you're not who your
[2:04:09] mistakes say that you
[2:04:11] are you're not your Mist whatever your
[2:04:13] mistake says that's not who you are you
[2:04:16] are who God says you are that's amen and
[2:04:19] if there's anybody that made a great
[2:04:20] mistake you look at look in the Bible
[2:04:21] you look at what Adam and what Eve did
[2:04:25] Adam willfully went out and committed
[2:04:26] sin willfully willfully did these things
[2:04:29] but you know what in in the midst of all
[2:04:31] that him losing his status or his
[2:04:33] position in the Garden of Eden he he had
[2:04:35] got kicked out him and Eve got kicked
[2:04:36] out but it did not change his position
[2:04:39] as a Son of
[2:04:41] God when you look through the
[2:04:42] genealogies in the Book of Luke you'll
[2:04:44] see amen it say uh uh Adam who was a Son
[2:04:49] of
[2:04:50] God it did not change his status his
[2:04:52] failures did not change his status your
[2:04:55] failures would not change your
[2:04:59] status the body the body now Jesus came
[2:05:04] to Earth to destroy the works of the
[2:05:06] devil but now the body has to do the
[2:05:10] same brother Ram says now it's bodies to
[2:05:13] do the same because the body is head and
[2:05:16] body is together that's right if Christ
[2:05:18] is the head was the word his body has to
[2:05:21] be the same thing as his head was that's
[2:05:22] right a church of the word born of the
[2:05:25] word virgin born from the word not a
[2:05:27] denomination now virgin born from the
[2:05:31] word the way the body operates is by the
[2:05:34] head that's
[2:05:36] right now here we have a
[2:05:40] commission we have to destroy the works
[2:05:42] of the
[2:05:43] devil and I'm and I'm just here to tell
[2:05:46] you somebody is going to manifest what
[2:05:50] the prophet just said there's going to
[2:05:52] be a group of young people in this
[2:05:54] generation that would say I am one of
[2:05:56] them that is destroying the works of the
[2:06:00] devil I'm not here to be destroyed by
[2:06:02] The Works of the devil I'm here to
[2:06:05] ruin
[2:06:07] demolish
[2:06:09] destroy that's my job that's my
[2:06:13] purpose brother random makes a statement
[2:06:17] Amen Let me just uh uh I want to uh yeah
[2:06:21] this is in the
[2:06:22] message
[2:06:25] exhortation exhortation of Divine
[2:06:27] Healing it says this now it says we know
[2:06:30] many Brethren has different ways the
[2:06:32] main principle way of Divine Healing is
[2:06:33] preaching the word so people could hear
[2:06:35] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[2:06:37] the word and they preach Divine Healing
[2:06:38] and prove it by the scriptures that
[2:06:39] Jesus Christ died for our sickness and
[2:06:42] when he died for when he died for our
[2:06:43] sins and that is true I believe that's
[2:06:46] undisputable with the Bible scholars
[2:06:48] that that Jesus when he come to destroy
[2:06:50] the works of the devil that sickness is
[2:06:53] directly the work of the
[2:06:55] devil so if Jesus came to destroy the
[2:06:58] works of the devil he came to destroy
[2:07:01] sickness what about his body when you
[2:07:04] see one of your brothers or sisters amen
[2:07:07] going through in their body do you
[2:07:09] realize you as a son a daughter of God
[2:07:11] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[2:07:13] can lay hands on the sick and they will
[2:07:16] recover you don't have to go get the
[2:07:18] pastor or the Deacon you can do that
[2:07:20] yourself you were
[2:07:24] born when you see it destroy it take it
[2:07:29] out don't let the devil have any space
[2:07:31] at
[2:07:32] all oh you know there's a a statement
[2:07:35] here and and brother Bram talked about
[2:07:37] even Joshua how Joshua had to go into
[2:07:39] certain cities when they were going to
[2:07:41] the promised land they had to wipe out
[2:07:43] everything he said g i mean God said
[2:07:45] don't even let the babies
[2:07:47] live
[2:07:49] when it was time for Destruction
[2:07:50] everything had to go don't even let the
[2:07:52] babies live he says because if you let
[2:07:54] the babies live they'll grow up to be
[2:07:56] adults one day and they'll create
[2:07:58] problems Hallelujah don't e don't let
[2:08:01] baby devils
[2:08:02] live I don't care how I mean it's just a
[2:08:05] little sickness just a don't let baby
[2:08:07] devils live destroy baby
[2:08:13] Devils
[2:08:15] here a statement that was made
[2:08:19] destroy your
[2:08:20] enemy before your enemy destroys
[2:08:25] you brother Brandon makes this statement
[2:08:28] here I um I want to just uh uh catch it
[2:08:33] in in Saul Saul Saul was raised he was
[2:08:36] supposed to be a king that was going to
[2:08:38] destroy the am
[2:08:39] malachit but what Saul failed to do and
[2:08:42] and and God told him to go wipe out he I
[2:08:44] got a problem with these amalekites go
[2:08:45] wipe them all out Saul I need you to
[2:08:47] follow my instructions my my direction
[2:08:49] wipe them all out Saul went he says you
[2:08:51] know what we're going to let some of the
[2:08:52] the best animals live and we're going to
[2:08:54] let the King live and we're going to let
[2:08:55] this and and and and Samu had to come
[2:08:57] say wait a minute what is all this that
[2:08:58] I hear didn't I tell you to destroy
[2:09:01] wasn't that your commission don't don't
[2:09:04] compromise with any Devils when God has
[2:09:07] giv you commission to
[2:09:11] destroy don't compromise with it I don't
[2:09:14] know what you're going through tonight
[2:09:17] but I know God has a word for you and
[2:09:19] whatever it is you have to raise up and
[2:09:21] you have to destroy it you have the
[2:09:23] authority you have the power it's been
[2:09:25] given to you by the Holy Ghost you can
[2:09:27] put the devil under your
[2:09:33] feet Samuel says Saul what are you doing
[2:09:36] why why did you make all these
[2:09:37] compromises why why why these animals
[2:09:39] why do I hear the blading of these
[2:09:40] animals what's going on here he says
[2:09:43] well I was just saving him for the
[2:09:44] sacrifice and I was doing this and I was
[2:09:46] doing that and then God had to speak a
[2:09:47] word a
[2:09:49] rebuke in 1st Samuel
[2:09:53] 15:23
[2:09:55] Rebellion is the sin of
[2:09:58] Witchcraft and
[2:10:00] stubbornness is as iniquity and
[2:10:04] idolatry because thou has rejected the
[2:10:07] word of the Lord he hath also rejected
[2:10:10] thee from being King he lost his POS his
[2:10:14] position because he did not
[2:10:17] destroy
[2:10:19] later on we find out because he didn't
[2:10:21] kill all the
[2:10:23] amalekites when Samuel when Saul died he
[2:10:27] fell on a sword but he didn't die on his
[2:10:30] sword what happens that a little amalaki
[2:10:33] came along and says he says look I I
[2:10:35] don't want the the enemy to find me like
[2:10:37] this would you please take my life so
[2:10:38] that the enemy does not do great things
[2:10:40] against me and Malachi says yeah I'll
[2:10:42] take your life took Saul out took the
[2:10:44] crown took everything and took it to
[2:10:46] David and told David the story this is
[2:10:48] what happened I'm the one that killed
[2:10:50] Saul and here's the problem if Saul
[2:10:52] would have killed the
[2:10:54] amalekites he would have never been
[2:10:56] killed by an
[2:10:58] amalaki destroy your
[2:11:02] enemy because Satan's job is to steal
[2:11:06] kill destroy destroy your
[2:11:10] enemy before your enemy destroys
[2:11:17] you
[2:11:21] let me uh give you just one more here
[2:11:25] and I'll find my way out
[2:11:28] tonight oh
[2:11:31] my there's one character in Scripture
[2:11:33] that we're all very familiar
[2:11:47] with
[2:11:50] this
[2:11:51] man was born on Earth for one specific
[2:11:55] purpose but the only problem is that he
[2:11:57] kept getting his purpose all mixed up by
[2:12:01] getting involved with things that he
[2:12:02] should not have been involved
[2:12:07] with
[2:12:10] kept oh let me just let me just work
[2:12:14] with it just for a little bit this this
[2:12:16] this man he kept there were beautiful
[2:12:19] sisters in the
[2:12:21] church wonderful ladies they got dressed
[2:12:25] up for
[2:12:28] banquets they look really
[2:12:31] nice but this brother had a problem he
[2:12:34] never wanted to look at the sisters that
[2:12:37] was in his own Nation what he decided is
[2:12:40] to go after the sisters that were
[2:12:41] outside of the
[2:12:43] nation actually he went for the Sisters
[2:12:47] in the nation that he was
[2:12:53] born he was born to
[2:12:57] destroy and he constantly found himself
[2:12:59] down there asking his parents uh please

[2:13:17] that lady
[2:13:21] so I just want to and let me tell you I
[2:13:24] can tell you why he wanted he had a a
[2:13:25] lust
[2:13:27] problem let's just get down right to the

[2:14:49] and let me tell you Delilah we know
[2:14:51] she's represented as a woman in
[2:14:52] scripture but every person in here
[2:14:54] whether you're male or female you have a
[2:14:56] Delila that you deal
[2:14:59] with and I want to commend you young
[2:15:01] people even in
[2:15:03] loneliness that you refuse to go out and
[2:15:07] bring somebody else in that is not a
[2:15:10] Believer I want to commend you for that
[2:15:14] see you you have to be one to show that
[2:15:16] it can be done the right way
[2:15:19] and as you're showing that it's done the
[2:15:21] right way you know what you're doing
[2:15:22] you're destroying the work of the
[2:15:28] devil Samson found himself going back
[2:15:31] and forth back and forth into these
[2:15:35] conditions I remember the scripture
[2:15:36] tells us one time he went down there
[2:15:37] after he lost his first wife he went
[2:15:39] down there into a harlot's house what is
[2:15:42] Samson doing in a harlot's
[2:15:46] house
[2:15:48] because we have sons of God samsons
[2:15:50] today that find themselves in a harlot's
[2:16:00] house even in the midst of
[2:16:02] this when the Philistines surrounded him
[2:16:06] he comes out the harlot's house and he
[2:16:08] is he still has power to break free from
[2:16:10] the situation that he's in Samson should
[2:16:13] have not only broke free but he should
[2:16:15] have stayed free this year amen as

[2:17:25] secret what's where's your strength at

[2:20:29] you embarrass me like this in front of
[2:20:33] everybody it's socalled
[2:20:40] love you know they have a say they have
[2:20:43] a saying that people sometimes are
[2:20:45] blinded by love
[2:20:48] actually I don't think you blinded by
[2:20:49] love I think you blinded by
[2:20:56] lust
[2:20:58] finally he agrees to telling he just
[2:21:01] opens up his heart and in judges
[2:21:03] 16117 he finally tells it the truth he
[2:21:06] says that he told her all his heart he
[2:21:08] said unto her there have not come a
[2:21:12] razor upon my head if I have been a
[2:21:14] Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb
[2:21:17] if if I be shaven then my strength will
[2:21:19] go from me and I shall become weak and
[2:21:21] be like any other man he finally told
[2:21:23] her his whole heart you know what she
[2:21:26] does with his whole
[2:21:28] heart she shaves his
[2:21:31] head causes him to lay down in her
[2:21:35] lap wakes him up when it's time for him
[2:21:39] to
[2:21:40] be
[2:21:46] destroyed this time she says
[2:21:49] Samson Philistines are upon you he woke
[2:21:51] up this time and went to swinging and
[2:21:53] doing everything
[2:21:57] and this time God wasn't with
[2:22:01] him and ended up in
[2:22:04] bondage so bad that they made sport of
[2:22:09] SEL Samson they took his eyes out he
[2:22:11] lost the ability to be able to
[2:22:14] see a man that was was was born was was
[2:22:18] was was put on Earth just to defeat
[2:22:22] Philistines now he's
[2:22:25] defeated by those
[2:22:27] Philistines I don't know sometimes you
[2:22:29] know I know when we when we read the
[2:22:31] story of Samson we hear the story of
[2:22:32] Samson often times we can identify with
[2:22:36] this character because we've gone
[2:22:37] through very similar situations whether
[2:22:39] with female or
[2:22:42] male here's the good news about this
[2:22:46] story
[2:22:48] wow Samson was
[2:22:51] bound wow he was in
[2:22:55] bondage this is when God be to move on
[2:22:58] him again somehow the Seven Locks begin
[2:23:01] to grow back wow he was bound but you
[2:23:03] know what samton come to a spot where he
[2:23:05] could also
[2:23:10] repent and when he finally got his heart
[2:23:12] right with God Samson could ask the
[2:23:14] little lad lead me to the pillar
[2:23:17] like what why you want to go to the
[2:23:19] pillars just don't ask any questions
[2:23:21] lead me to the
[2:23:24] pillars all the people making sport of
[2:23:27] Samson looking at him standing there in
[2:23:29] the pillars but they couldn't hear what
[2:23:30] he was saying out of his
[2:23:34] mouth CU God I know I failed
[2:23:36] you God I know that I was put on this
[2:23:40] Earth to destroy Philistines but now
[2:23:42] these Philistines are trying to destroy
[2:23:44] me but God I I got one more prayer in me
[2:23:48] anybody got one more prayer in them
[2:23:50] before they go into the next year just
[2:23:51] one more prayer one more
[2:23:59] time father I knew what my purpose was I
[2:24:02] was supposed to be here to destroy
[2:24:04] Philistines I'm sorry I failed you I'm
[2:24:08] sorry I I allowed amen these young
[2:24:11] ladies to keep coming in and out of my
[2:24:13] life I'm sorry that I did these
[2:24:15] things but but once more
[2:24:22] Lord if young people could have that
[2:24:24] same cry tonight
[2:24:27] once once more Lord I know what you've
[2:24:32] done for me at the beginning of the year
[2:24:33] but here I come to the end of the year
[2:24:35] and I know the struggles that I've had
[2:24:36] once
[2:24:38] more
[2:24:45] Lord Sam
[2:24:47] son was ready to do something that I
[2:24:49] hope that we're all ready to
[2:24:52] do Samson was ready to
[2:24:55] die with his
[2:24:59] enemy in our day we don't have to
[2:25:01] physically die but maybe some some of
[2:25:04] the the the the challenges God wants us
[2:25:05] to die to some of those challenges don't
[2:25:08] carry those things over into the next
[2:25:10] year but tonight is a good time to pray
[2:25:13] the same prayer that Samson prayed once
[2:25:17] more more Lord let me die with the
[2:25:20] Philistines and when he pushed the two
[2:25:24] pillars Samson killed more
[2:25:28] Philistines in his death than he did
[2:25:33] while he was
[2:25:35] alive God still got Glory out of
[2:25:39] Samson's life even in his
[2:25:43] death he was
[2:25:45] born
[2:25:47] to
[2:25:49] destroy and I'm here to tell you tonight
[2:25:52] Samson's not the only one Joshua's not
[2:25:54] the only one Jesus is not the only one
[2:25:56] Moses not the only one you are also
[2:26:01] born to
[2:26:04] destroy you're not born to be defeated
[2:26:07] by that I don't care what it is that the
[2:26:09] devil's had you bound with you are not
[2:26:11] born to be defeated by
[2:26:13] that you were born to destroy it amen
[2:26:17] you're born to destroy
[2:26:19] pornography born to destroy lust you're
[2:26:22] born to destroy sickness in your body
[2:26:25] you're born to destroy anything the
[2:26:27] devil can
[2:26:30] present born to
[2:26:36] destroy destroy your
[2:26:38] enemy before he destroys
[2:26:42] you let's
[2:26:45] pray
[2:26:58] father we thank you for your
[2:27:03] word it's the word that gives us
[2:27:07] Liberty it's the word that gives us
[2:27:10] freedom it's the word that gives us
[2:27:15] Deliverance
[2:27:19] father you know why this sermon had to
[2:27:21] go forth
[2:27:23] tonight only you know what your people
[2:27:27] are going through only you know what
[2:27:29] this year has been like for many of them
[2:27:33] but they've
[2:27:34] come they've heard your
[2:27:37] word and father we pray the spirit of
[2:27:39] God would come to bring amen Deliverance
[2:27:42] to the
[2:27:43] people Freedom this is what you told us
[2:27:47] that you you come to bind the
[2:27:49] Brokenhearted you come to set the
[2:27:51] captive
[2:27:52] free and father it's through your word
[2:27:55] that you do these things so father we're
[2:27:57] asking that you would just take control
[2:27:58] Lord even of this portion of the service
[2:28:01] we we don't have to manufact or
[2:28:04] anything that's not what we're trying to
[2:28:06] do but Lord we want to get to the heart
[2:28:09] of the
[2:28:11] matter we want to see you Lord we not
[2:28:13] just have a feeling or an emotion father
[2:28:15] and go back and and have the same old
[2:28:17] lifestyle but let a change really take
[2:28:19] place on the inside and let us be
[2:28:22] willing as Samson was willing to
[2:28:25] die with our
[2:28:28] enemy I pray Lord somebody would
[2:28:30] come Lord to us a a a place tonight
[2:28:34] where they will realize that you have
[2:28:36] given them the authority and the power
[2:28:39] to destroy that enemy that's been trying
[2:28:41] to destroy them tonight they can put
[2:28:44] their Stak down in the ground they can
[2:28:47] go free this is the time that the
[2:28:50] Jubilee trumpet is sounding for
[2:28:53] them I pray they would hear
[2:28:56] it they respond to
[2:28:59] it and go free because he who the son
[2:29:03] sets
[2:29:05] free is free

[2:29:42] pray that you come to a spot in God

[3:02:08] Hallelujah I just want to say something
[3:02:10] we can go back and singing some songs I
[3:02:12] just wanted to say
[3:02:14] just moved in my spirit so much
[3:02:18] tonight because what in my what I desire
[3:02:22] is the depth of
[3:02:24] sincerity in young people and I know if
[3:02:27] they'll offer that to God there's
[3:02:29] nothing he would hold back from you it's
[3:02:32] all yours
[3:02:33] tonight I just wanted to testify while I
[3:02:36] was sitting there tonight and
[3:02:38] brother Jack reached a certain point he
[3:02:41] said he was going to close and there's
[3:02:43] something in my spirit I don't know what
[3:02:45] it was it just I said there's just still
[3:02:48] something more there's something missing
[3:02:50] or something unresolved and he was going
[3:02:52] to close and I just felt in my spirit I
[3:02:55] just said there's there's in talking
[3:02:58] about the enemy that we need to
[3:03:02] destroy before it destroys us I said I
[3:03:06] think there's still some youth here in
[3:03:09] the particular area sometimes of of
[3:03:12] lust
[3:03:14] and sexual sin and sexual mistakes or or
[3:03:17] even just a lustful spirit and I said it
[3:03:19] just seems like if if they don't really
[3:03:22] get a hold of God that enemy will
[3:03:24] destroy
[3:03:25] them so they need to destroy it I was
[3:03:28] just thinking though I said just seemed
[3:03:29] like there's a missing part
[3:03:31] it and he didn't close took his
[3:03:35] Direction into Samson and
[3:03:38] Delilah and that wasn't put in the Bible
[3:03:41] by accident that's a real real thing
[3:03:44] that takes place in the Temptation Of
[3:03:48] Satan that the enemy that Samson was
[3:03:51] called and purposed by God to
[3:03:54] destroy was now going to try to destroy
[3:03:57] him and I said Lord this is a move of
[3:04:00] God at the end that you're definitely
[3:04:02] needed to if you had some unfinished
[3:04:04] business to speak to our hearts this is
[3:04:07] this is what needed to be said and I'll
[3:04:10] just say thanks be to God because you
[3:04:12] know what I feel like like
[3:04:14] tonight when God goes that in that area
[3:04:17] and many areas he's went in he really
[3:04:19] loves you because he's saying there's
[3:04:22] something greater than your Rebellion
[3:04:24] there's something greater than your lust
[3:04:27] there's something greater than your
[3:04:28] mistakes and then the choir sings a song
[3:04:31] my God is how many believe he's
[3:04:34] greater he's there's something greater
[3:04:37] than our problems there's something
[3:04:38] greater than the mountain can you say
[3:04:40] amen amen and I I I stand just rejoicing
[3:04:44] tonight at the sincerity of repentance
[3:04:48] that's come in our hearts I want to see
[3:04:51] real
[3:04:52] change and you're sitting here tonight
[3:04:55] and you look at you say well somebody
[3:04:56] over there got something and I didn't
[3:04:59] don't think that way somebody over there
[3:05:02] shouted or they and praised God all of
[3:05:05] that is it's it's however but don't you
[3:05:08] dare let the enemy tell you that you
[3:05:11] didn't get something tonight
[3:05:14] cuz this wasn't for that person just
[3:05:16] that that rejoices and is more loud this

[3:29:19] the morning early and we're still
[3:29:21] finishing the camp we're still here
[3:29:23] still got some things to do we cut the
[3:29:25] camp from four day four nights to three
[3:29:28] uh to save money because it gets so
[3:29:30] expensive to have a camp these days uh
[3:29:32] they keep raising the prices and
[3:29:34] different things so uh we cut it to a
[3:29:37] three to get the price down for you so
[3:29:39] we tried to squeeze in a lot more
[3:29:41] sessions and things within the three
[3:29:42] days that's why we did that so we're not
[3:29:45] finished tomorrow we have another
[3:29:46] session with brother Barry teaching
[3:29:47] that's why we did that but I've enjoyed
[3:29:49] it I know we like to stay the four days
[3:29:51] but I've enjoyed it just as much I
[3:29:53] thought we've had we've got a lot in a
[3:29:55] lot of good teaching a lot of good
[3:29:57] preaching and also just the Lord giving
[3:29:59] him an opportunity just to move in our
[3:30:00] Liv and speak to us so it's been really
[3:30:03] really good and as I said I'll
[3:30:04] compliment you again this one of the
[3:30:06] best groups that we've ever had such a a
[3:30:09] great a great group of young people um I
