[6:28] [Music]
[6:41] Genesis chapter 3 and verse 14 and the
[6:44] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[6:46] thou has done this Thou Art cursed above
[6:49] all cattle and above every beast of the
[6:51] field upon thy belly shalt out go and
[6:55] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[6:57] life and I will put enmity between thee
[7:00] and the woman and between thy seed and
[7:04] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[7:08] thou shalt bruise his heel I want to
[7:10] read that part again because it's a very
[7:13] interesting one scripture in between all
[7:15] the curses of God in between the
[7:18] Judgment of God because whenever there's
[7:19] sin there has to be judgment so as he's
[7:22] handing out the Judgment in the middle
[7:24] of all this is a prophecy of redemption
[7:26] and it says I will put enmity between
[7:29] the thee in the woman between thy scene
[7:32] and Herzing it shall bruise there's a
[7:34] prophecy it shall bruise thy head and
[7:36] speak into the servant and thou shalt
[7:38] bruise his heel unto the woman he said
[7:40] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[7:43] and in thy conception and sorrow thou
[7:44] shall bring forth children and thy
[7:46] desire shall be to thy husband and he
[7:49] shall rule over thee and unto Adam he
[7:51] said because Thou Art hearken unto the
[7:53] voice of thy wife and has eaten of the
[7:55] tree of which I have commanded these
[7:56] things Thou shalt not eat of it and
[7:58] cursed as the ground for thy sake in
[8:01] sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days
[8:04] of thy life Thorns also and thistles
[8:07] shall it bring forth to thee and thou
[8:10] shalt eat the herb of the field in the
[8:12] sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
[8:15] till thou return unto the ground
[8:18] for out of it was thou taken for Dost
[8:20] thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
[8:23] in the last few Services we showed the
[8:27] fall in the garden and the Oneness that
[8:30] was broke with God and then the Oneness
[8:33] that was broke with one another
[8:35] and we know that all the relationships
[8:38] were destroyed
[8:40] from their relationship with God and all
[8:43] the way down to the home
[8:45] and uh so we have elaborated on that but
[8:48] in this service we want to take a bit of
[8:50] a turn we want to take a transition and
[8:53] we want to move from talking about the
[8:56] the results of the fall and what took
[8:58] place and begin to look at what God
[9:01] would do and how he would do it to
[9:04] reverse all of this to change all of
[9:06] this and to to redeem his sons out of
[9:10] this mess that we got ourselves in or
[9:14] Adam and Eve got us in so how would God
[9:16] reverse it it's very important that we
[9:18] know that it's very important that we
[9:20] know how God's Redemption takes place
[9:22] it's important that we know it's the
[9:24] power of it how powerful it is because
[9:26] it had to be pretty powerful to Deliver
[9:28] Us from the state that we're in uh but
[9:31] it's very important we know how God
[9:33] chose and the reason is is because man
[9:36] can always come up with ideas to try to
[9:39] redeem himself out of this state that
[9:41] he's in and because of that we want to
[9:43] make crystal clear God's way of
[9:46] redemption God's chosen way of
[9:48] redemption because that's the only way
[9:50] that we can get back to God God's way of
[9:54] redemption is the only way back men can
[9:57] try different ways they can give they
[9:59] can give themselves to Public Service
[10:02] they can live their whole life in public
[10:04] service but if they have the guilt and
[10:06] sin of sin on their soul then God has a
[10:08] way to take care of that and release it
[10:10] and forgive them they can't take care of
[10:13] that on their own there are certain
[10:14] problems that we have that we cannot
[10:17] take care of on our own we are helpless
[10:20] and only God can do it
[10:23] and when the fall took place then God
[10:25] began to begin to lay out his Plan of
[10:30] Redemption and as you know God allowed
[10:33] in the greater mystery of it all God
[10:35] allowed this to happen God didn't create
[10:38] this but God allowed this fall to take
[10:41] place in order for his bigger Plan of
[10:44] Redemption to unfold and that his
[10:47] attributes would be displayed because
[10:49] some of God cannot be expressed in
[10:53] perfection
[10:54] when we think of God we think of
[10:57] perfection but some of the attributes of
[10:59] God cannot be expressed and come out
[11:02] unless there's an imperfection unless
[11:04] there's a fall unless there's a mistake
[11:06] unless there's someone who's fallen and
[11:09] can't get up can you say Amen there are
[11:11] some attributes of of God and
[11:13] particularly the the entire work of
[11:15] redemption could not be expressed until
[11:18] man had fallen so there's a certain part
[11:21] of this that he allowed to take place so
[11:23] that more of his attributes could be
[11:25] expressed can you say Amen so so now
[11:28] some of God could not be expressed so
[11:30] now we see then that man was in a place
[11:33] who uh that he could never pull himself
[11:36] out of he could not help himself it's
[11:39] it's like the song says win nothing else
[11:41] could help Love Lifted Me I love that
[11:45] lyric when nothing else could help you
[11:47] get in States there's nothing else that
[11:49] can help you except God accept his love
[11:53] and it's very important we know that in
[11:55] this proud generation because we have so
[11:57] many things to fix things we have so
[11:59] many we have access to so much that can
[12:01] fix things and we try to fix everything
[12:03] but we need to be humble and realize
[12:05] there's certain things that you cannot
[12:07] fix
[12:08] there's certain things in life and
[12:10] actually the more things you turn over
[12:12] to God he'll fix it the right way
[12:16] but we have to humbly admit there's
[12:18] certain things I can't do it Lord I
[12:20] don't want to offer any help to it I
[12:21] don't want to after any assistance I
[12:23] can't do it if it's going to get done I
[12:25] yield to do you because there are
[12:27] certain problems that only God can take
[12:30] care of
[12:31] that's humility can you say Amen
[12:34] I was Sinking Deep in sin so far from
[12:37] the shore all these lyrics I was sinking
[12:39] and it was this this this depth of Sin
[12:42] from the garden it was so lodged in the
[12:46] spirit of man in other words this fall
[12:49] was just not a mistake this was not just
[12:52] a mistake this was huge
[12:55] to where this sin lodged in man's Spirit
[12:59] can you say Amen so that he didn't just
[13:02] have problems because we read the
[13:05] problems of relationship that come from
[13:06] the fall he had problems and man had
[13:09] problems ever since the fall there's
[13:11] always been problems he's saying to Adam
[13:12] there under Adam's curse he'd curse the
[13:15] ground he couldn't curse Adam because he
[13:16] was the son of God so he cursed the
[13:18] ground so you're going to work by the
[13:19] sweater of your brow you're you're going
[13:21] to have thorns and thistles grow up in
[13:23] your garden
[13:24] yeah he that's under the curse and there
[13:27] it is and we're still dealing with that
[13:28] crabgrass we're still dealing with the
[13:30] Thorns can you say Matt so he's dishing
[13:32] out all these things and he's he's
[13:34] giving it what what Adam but so Adam had
[13:37] problems because of the Fall Adam had to
[13:39] work by the sweat of his brow because of
[13:42] the Fall we're still dealing with Allah
[13:44] but I want to just say I'm not talking
[13:46] about today so much the problems as I'm
[13:48] talking about the problem
[13:51] singular
[13:52] because there was one problem with Adam
[13:55] and everyone after him that was so deep
[13:58] and so ingrained in his nature there
[14:01] wasn't anything that he could do to fix
[14:03] it
[14:05] it was so deep it was so ingrained it
[14:09] went right to into his Spirit right into
[14:12] his nature and Only God and let me say
[14:15] this only God knew the depth of the fall
[14:17] in the garden Only God know how knew how
[14:20] deep it was
[14:21] I don't believe Adam knew how deep it
[14:23] was I don't believe Eve knew Cain
[14:25] certainly didn't know and everywhere
[14:27] from there they didn't realize the depth
[14:29] of what took place it wasn't just a
[14:32] mistake that Satan himself came and
[14:35] injected himself into the human race
[14:37] lodged his own nature in the spirit and
[14:40] the soul of man
[14:42] that's pretty deep
[14:44] only God knew the depth of the Fall I
[14:47] don't even think I'm sometimes I wonder
[14:49] when people don't cry out for the Holy
[14:51] Ghost in their lives and really get a
[14:54] deep experience with God maybe they
[14:57] don't understand how deep the serpent
[15:00] nature is rooted within us
[15:03] because if they really understood you
[15:05] know we're always looking for the good
[15:06] things we do we always looking to Pat
[15:08] ourselves in the back we are but but man
[15:10] in his nature when he's born there's a
[15:12] problem can you say amen and you can be
[15:14] good and you can give and you can help
[15:16] people and you can be a a a decent
[15:18] person in society and my kids are good
[15:21] people praise the Lord I'd rather have
[15:23] good people on the Earth than bad people
[15:24] I love that but that doesn't deal with
[15:26] the problem the problem goes deeper in
[15:29] our nature and only God can deal with
[15:31] that problem you need to know there's
[15:33] one problem that that trumps all
[15:36] problems
[15:37] and that's the nature that we're born
[15:39] with
[15:41] and if we go our whole lives and deal
[15:44] with our problems even with the Lord but
[15:48] ignore the problem
[15:51] then we're missing something what's what
[15:53] does it profit a man to gain the whole
[15:56] world and lose his soul
[15:58] if we can ignore the one problem so I
[16:01] got I struggle in this and I do this and
[16:02] I I put this on and I wear this on my
[16:05] ears and I do this and I struggle with
[16:07] this and okay okay but you see now see
[16:10] that's all that's all just uh that's
[16:12] symptoms
[16:15] let's not talk about the symptoms I mean
[16:18] I could lay it down the line and show
[16:19] you the the dress code that comes right
[16:21] from the Bible for you sisters and
[16:23] brothers sometimes I do it but I could
[16:25] lay it out just as crystal clear some of
[16:27] you still wouldn't follow it but I could
[16:29] lay it out and you could line up with it
[16:32] and I would appreciate that praise the
[16:34] Lord but listen that doesn't deal with a
[16:37] deeper problem
[16:38] it's pretty exciting now to read our
[16:40] text because
[16:42] right in the middle of the curses
[16:45] right in the middle of the curses and
[16:48] the judgments being handed out
[16:50] there's a strong bold
[16:53] Proclamation from our god of redemption
[16:58] already it's the first little section of
[17:01] scripture that prophesies of redemption
[17:03] and he does it right in the middle of
[17:05] the curses being handed out
[17:07] I love that
[17:09] there's a strong bold statement guess
[17:12] who he's speaking it to he's speaking it
[17:13] to the serpent
[17:15] he's saying something to the serpent I
[17:18] see what you've done I've observed what
[17:20] you've done I know this goes deeper than
[17:23] man can ever help himself and now I have
[17:25] to lay out curses on you on Adam and on
[17:29] Eve I have to because God's a God of
[17:31] Justice there has to be a payment can
[17:33] you say man there has to be something
[17:35] take place to to when we make when even
[17:39] we make a mistake there has if you're in
[17:41] God's world there has to be some type of
[17:44] punishment for it there has to be a
[17:46] response about it you don't just get off
[17:48] scot-free when you make a mistake
[17:51] come on people listen these are simple
[17:53] things I'm
[17:54] if you do something sin has to have a
[17:57] response sin has to be taken care of
[18:00] you're going to own up to it you don't
[18:02] get off scot-free if you do something
[18:04] privately with yourself and you think
[18:06] nobody sees you there'll be a there'll
[18:08] be something that will come as the fruit
[18:10] that comes from that because that's the
[18:12] way life Works can you say that's the
[18:14] way God's kingdom work is works as well
[18:16] but in the middle of the curses in the
[18:18] middle of the judgments being handed out
[18:20] there's a strong Proclamation from God
[18:23] uh that goes directly to the serpent in
[18:26] the middle of justice is Mercy being
[18:29] predicted in the middle of the judgments
[18:32] of God being handed out God puts in
[18:35] Mercy for his sons and daughters
[18:37] it's not all cursed it's not a job and
[18:39] they're going to come underneath it and
[18:40] it's going to happen it's going to
[18:42] happen for thousands of years but God
[18:43] just laced in their puts in there but
[18:45] say sir but uh Satan I say Satan because
[18:48] he cursed the serpent to the ground
[18:49] became a snake but he's still speaking
[18:51] to this to Satan and he said I want to
[18:53] let you know
[18:55] I see the problem they don't even see it
[18:57] I see the fall I see what's done it goes
[19:00] deep but I want to let you know I'm
[19:01] going to deal with some with it someday
[19:03] and Satan I'm going to deal with you
[19:07] and I'm gonna do it my own way and when
[19:09] I do it it's going to be permanent and
[19:12] God says God says you may strike at the
[19:15] heel even of my people you'll strike at
[19:18] the heel of this seat at Calvary but I
[19:21] will crush your head through Christ
[19:23] [Applause]
[19:27] is God saying he's going to deal with it
[19:29] yeah he's going to deal with it
[19:31] and by the way we're post Calvary now so
[19:33] he's already dealt with it at Calvary
[19:35] he's already crushed the head of the
[19:37] serpent all he can do is is Bluff with
[19:40] you all he can do is threaten you all he
[19:43] can do is bully you he has no power over
[19:46] what God said that you are he has no
[19:49] power this morning he's a bluff can you
[19:51] say amen he he he is a he is my dad used
[19:54] to say he got his teeth taken out of
[19:57] calvary
[19:58] and all he can do is gum you to death
[20:02] I want you to notice now when he comes
[20:04] into his power of redemption and you're
[20:06] already responding saying my my my my my
[20:08] this is powerful
[20:11] this isn't just a Band-Aid on the
[20:13] problem he's going to deal with the
[20:15] problem of sin
[20:17] and he is going to make it so permanent
[20:20] his sons and daughters look at them
[20:22] they're hiding they're scared they're
[20:24] walking with their tail between the legs
[20:26] Adam and Eve hiding in the bushes
[20:28] bullied by the enemy speaking in shame
[20:32] speaking in guilt come on read your
[20:34] Bible there they are hiding guilt shame
[20:37] and they're scared and they're and
[20:39] they're they're blaming one another and
[20:40] they're trying to Dish it off and
[20:42] they're doing they're all a lot of sorts
[20:43] their minds are just gone here and
[20:46] they're walking with their tail between
[20:47] like scared and bullied by the enemy but
[20:49] I want to say that's not with God he's
[20:51] not scared he's not bullied by the enemy
[20:53] can you say man he says I know my son
[20:56] and daughter have failed but I'm making
[20:58] something crystal clear to you serpent I
[21:01] will deal with this and then I will deal
[21:03] with you
[21:05] so right there he proclaimed that my
[21:07] people will come to the powerful work of
[21:08] my Redemption there's nothing Satan can
[21:11] ever do it begins the Prophecies of
[21:15] redemption dealing with his people all
[21:18] the way till we come to the the birth of
[21:20] Christ and that seed and we'll get to
[21:22] that in just a minute the powerful work
[21:25] of redemption he wasn't just going to
[21:27] put a Band-Aid on your problem
[21:29] this goes deeper than just putting a
[21:31] Band-Aid on
[21:33] your serpent nature that you're born
[21:34] with goes deeper than just you know I
[21:36] can fix this I can fix this you ever
[21:38] seen people I can fix this leave it
[21:40] alone don't worry about it I can fix
[21:41] this we can fix everything you can't fix
[21:43] that nature that you're born with
[21:46] but God says I'm not only going to fix
[21:48] it I'm going to crush his head
[21:52] so today I want to get specific about
[21:54] the powerful work of redemption and how
[21:55] deep it goes you know it's often that
[21:58] Bible terms get used through the years
[22:01] and they lose their meaning I think
[22:02] Redemption has lost its meaning a little
[22:04] bit
[22:07] we have to know how powerful God has
[22:10] provided a way of redemption for you
[22:12] Redemption has lost its it's been
[22:14] watered down and somebody now is
[22:17] redeemed because they come and shake the
[22:18] preacher's hand or they come to a church
[22:20] and they enjoy the youth group and now
[22:22] I've been redeemed no no no no no no no
[22:23] no Redemption is a process and
[22:26] Redemption God handles it and it's a
[22:28] deep deep work that takes place in you
[22:30] it's it's a long lasting work and you
[22:33] say amen and by the way it had a
[22:35] sacrifice with it because you don't have
[22:37] the Redemption of this deep problem
[22:38] without a huge sacrifice and guess what
[22:41] you didn't have to make that yourself
[22:42] Christ made it for you that Eve we know
[22:45] the cause of the Fall Eve disbelieved
[22:47] the word eve reason with the serpent and
[22:50] she left the word she was off on just
[22:51] one percent of it 99 of what was true as
[22:54] one percent lie and she believed the Lie
[22:56] Part she she reasoned with the serpent
[22:58] and that's how we know that's how the
[23:00] fall took place when you get away from
[23:01] the word then then it becomes chaos
[23:04] that's what happened in the garden and
[23:06] then we have all this trouble today even
[23:09] six thousand years later because Eve
[23:12] left the word every hospital every
[23:15] prison do you realize it was one word
[23:18] that Eve doubted listen to this now it
[23:20] was one word that Eve doubted and that
[23:22] caused all the trouble one spoken of
[23:25] word of God Eve doubted to be the truth
[23:27] and the greatest thing that I've been
[23:29] thinking about as the greatest problem
[23:31] that came from the Paul Paul is that
[23:33] every man was born with the nature of
[23:37] we would love to have perfect children
[23:39] and I know some people when they have
[23:41] babies think their children are perfect
[23:44] but none of them are perfect they're
[23:46] flawed
[23:48] and you can have Grace for them because
[23:49] you were born flawed
[23:51] you weren't born perfect
[23:53] so can you imagine how deep this problem
[23:56] goes is that
[23:58] um we could safely say that we are a
[24:01] born loser because
[24:04] you know I'm going to turn this around
[24:06] to positive in a minute and it can't get
[24:08] but positive when you talk about Calvary
[24:11] but all of us no matter how rich a
[24:13] family we were born in no matter if our
[24:16] dad was a preacher no matter if our dad
[24:18] was a deacon no matter how good where
[24:20] we're at now all of that we have to
[24:22] admit we're all born with the same
[24:25] nature and God had to deal with it
[24:28] and some may go way into sin and some
[24:31] may do little private sins but guess
[24:33] what we're all guilty
[24:35] we're all born with something we can't
[24:37] help
[24:40] all your best men that you look out in
[24:42] the face of the Earth and that's why
[24:45] all the best men all the most perfect
[24:48] people you can think of still we can't
[24:50] help one another out of this pit because
[24:52] we're all born with the same nature
[24:55] they looked in Revelations 5 who's
[24:56] worthy to take the book who's worthy to
[24:58] deal with this problem if somebody
[24:59] doesn't take this book of Redemption all
[25:01] creation is lost they look through the
[25:03] whole earth and couldn't find anybody
[25:04] worthy of the best people even even all
[25:07] the good people in the Old Testament and
[25:08] the Patriarchs we look up to none of
[25:10] them was worthy why because they were
[25:12] born just like us somebody that's born
[25:14] like you can't help you
[25:19] we cling to people we cling to family
[25:21] relationship and it's fine we clean and
[25:23] we become codependent on other people
[25:25] they can help me they've helped and we
[25:27] lean on it too much what we need to do
[25:29] is lean on the Lord we stand alone with
[25:31] the Lord and say Lord you deal with me
[25:33] internally let me not depend on someone
[25:35] else because no one can pull us out of
[25:38] the pit of this myri clay except the
[25:40] hand of Jesus Christ grabbing our hand
[25:42] and pulling us out
[25:43] the first part of redemption though
[25:46] the first part of it is paying the price
[25:49] the Kinsmen Redeemer a Boaz Redemption
[25:52] is all through the Book of Ruth if you
[25:54] want to read it Boaz you had to have
[25:55] three things he had to be able to pay
[25:58] the price to redeem Ruth he had to be
[26:01] willing to pay the price can you say
[26:03] amen and he had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer
[26:06] three things
[26:08] Christ
[26:09] became our Kinsmen Redeemer he became us
[26:12] he had to be willing
[26:14] to pay the price and he said in the
[26:16] garden not my will but thine be done
[26:20] but then he had to be able to bring the
[26:23] right price
[26:25] to redeem you
[26:28] and I'm here to tell you this morning
[26:32] there had to be a debt that's the first
[26:34] part of redemption there had to be a
[26:36] sacrifice to meet the dead and he went
[26:39] to Calvary
[26:40] nobody knew what he was doing nobody
[26:42] knew he was going to deal with the
[26:44] problem and when Jesus come up 12 years
[26:46] old or that he knew his commission and
[26:48] he knew in three and a half years he was
[26:49] headed right for that sacrifice that's
[26:52] why he was there nobody knew that matter
[26:53] of fact his disciples were so dumb to it
[26:55] at the end they're trying to keep it
[26:57] from happening can you imagine he's
[26:59] going to deal with their problem of sin
[27:01] he's they're trying to keep him from
[27:03] going
[27:04] that's how man can't understand when God
[27:08] deals with the problem let him deal with
[27:10] it
[27:11] don't question him don't say oh no Lord
[27:14] don't go from us and don't know do you
[27:16] realize Peter and you what you're doing
[27:19] he's headed and he's headed right there
[27:22] his commission is I'm going to pay the
[27:25] price
[27:27] this is the moment that I'm gonna he's
[27:30] gonna bruise my heel but I'm gonna crush
[27:32] his head from my people I'm going to
[27:34] save my sons and daughters I'm going to
[27:37] release their debt from them you you
[27:39] owed every bit of the sin that you owed
[27:42] every bit of that you've done you should
[27:44] pay for everything that you've done can
[27:46] I get people to raise your hands this
[27:48] morning it should come back on you
[27:50] but somebody
[27:54] walk the way the Via Dolorosa called the
[27:57] way of Calvary and he kept going and he
[28:00] kept going and he kept going because he
[28:02] knew what he was doing I'm
[28:04] I'm going to take care of the debt I'm
