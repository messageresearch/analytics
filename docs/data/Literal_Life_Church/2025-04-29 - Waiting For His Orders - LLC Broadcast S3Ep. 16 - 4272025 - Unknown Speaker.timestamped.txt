[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at
[0:20] literalife.urch. May God bless you, my
[0:22] friend. May the music and message
[0:24] encourage you today.
[0:30] Do you ever find
[0:32] yourself asking God where he's
[0:38] been? Ever get up out of bed saying, "I
[0:42] can't do this again?"
[0:45] [Music]
[0:47] Have you ever been afraid of what
[0:50] tomorrow's going to
[0:54] bring? And you're facing it alone. At
[0:57] least that's what you
[1:02] think. I can tell you after going
[1:05] through that
[1:06] valley, even though I didn't see it at
[1:10] the
[1:10] time, it was in my weakest moments that
[1:14] he held me. and they know you'll find.
[1:18] He will carry you when you can't go on.
[1:22] He will be your strength when your
[1:25] strength is gone. He will lift you up.
[1:28] He will be
[1:31] enough to get you through.
[1:34] When the road is long and you want to
[1:37] quit cuz you think you've got nothing
[1:41] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[1:45] into his
[1:48] arms. He will carry you.
[1:52] [Music]
[1:56] And when you get the kind of news that
[1:59] you hoped you'd never
[2:03] hear. And when you're chasing down a
[2:06] dream just to watch it
[2:11] disappear. And when somebody that you
[2:14] love turns and walks away.
[2:20] and they leave you standing
[2:22] there with
[2:24] shattered
[2:27] faith. You don't have to pick up all the
[2:30] broken
[2:31] pieces. You don't have to try to cover
[2:34] up the
[2:35] scars. You are loved and you can always
[2:38] run to
[2:39] Jesus just as you are. He will car you
[2:45] when you can't go on. He will be your
[2:48] strength. When your strength is gone, he
[2:51] will lift you up. He will be
[2:55] enough to get you
[2:58] through. When the road is long and you
[3:02] want to quit, cuz you think you've got
[3:05] nothing left to give, you can fall
[3:08] apart. Fall into his
[3:13] arms. He will carry you.
[3:20] His Lord is never
[3:23] weary. No, he's never tired. Through the
[3:28] toughest fight, through the longest
[3:30] night, through the fight and through the
[3:36] fight, he will carry you when you can't
[3:40] go on. He'll be your strength when your
[3:44] strength is gone. He will lift you up.
[3:47] He will be
[3:50] enough to get you
[3:52] through. When the road is long and you
[3:56] want to quit, cuz you think you've got
[3:59] nothing left to give, you can fall
[4:02] apart. Fall into his
[4:07] arms. He will carry you.
[4:15] Oh, he will carry
[4:23] you. John 5 and verse 16. And therefore
[4:28] did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought
[4:30] to slay him because he had done these
[4:34] things on the Sabbath day. He had just
[4:36] healed a man at the pool of Bethesda and
[4:38] he did it on the Sabbath day. So they
[4:40] were uh criticizing that. But Jesus
[4:43] answered them, "My father workketh here
[4:45] hitherto, and I work." Therefore, the
[4:48] Jews sought the more to kill him.
[4:51] Because he's not only he not only had uh
[4:54] broken the Sabbath, but said also that
[4:57] God was his father, making himself equal
[5:00] with God. So this is a a relevant
[5:03] scripture to realize when the devil he
[5:06] gets mad at miracles uh and he's
[5:08] technical about here about the Sabbath
[5:11] day. But the Bible says he really got
[5:14] upset when Jesus said his father was his
[5:16] father. That's when they really got more
[5:18] angry. So this is the thing that makes
[5:19] the devil more angry is when we start to
[5:22] call ourselves sons and daughters of God
[5:24] and he's our father. He doesn't like cuz
[5:27] that what that meant to them. If he says
[5:29] I'm his son, then I'm coe I'm equal with
[5:32] him. So, in some ways, they had a
[5:35] greater revelation back then of what
[5:37] that meant than even scholars today
[5:39] because if he says he's the son of God,
[5:41] then he was equal with God. And Satan
[5:44] hated that. They were very angry at
[5:45] that. They wanted to kill him. Then
[5:47] answered Jesus, and said unto them,
[5:48] verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[5:51] can do nothing of himself, but what he
[5:53] seeth the Father do. For what things
[5:56] soever he doeth, these also doeth the
[5:59] Son likewise. For the Father loveth the
[6:03] Son, and showeth him all things that
[6:07] himself doeth, and he will show him
[6:09] greater works than these, that ye may
[6:12] marvel. So, uh, that's my subject
[6:14] tonight is to recognize Jesus said the
[6:17] son can do nothing of himself. Now,
[6:20] remember Jesus had all the authority
[6:22] there and yet he was submissive under
[6:25] the father. This is where a son uh gets
[6:29] his authority to be able to properly use
[6:32] is when he's properly under the
[6:34] submission of the father and under the
[6:37] father's authority and actually would
[6:39] say I don't do anything. I don't act. I
[6:41] don't step out. I don't see any. I don't
[6:44] say anything unless my father tells me
[6:47] to say it. That's a submission of a son.
[6:49] Can you say amen? And then finish it by
[6:51] saying it's almost as he was saying 20.
[6:53] For the father loveth the son and
[6:55] showeth him all things that himself
[6:57] doeth. And he will show him greater
[7:00] works than these. And when I talk about
[7:02] the third pole a little bit tonight,
[7:04] when you see the term greater works,
[7:06] that's where we're at because it's
[7:07] something greater than what we've had
[7:09] before. greater works. So, a son here uh
[7:13] that you may marvel that a son will come
[7:15] into the greater works by his
[7:17] submission. Now, John chapter 8, it's
[7:20] real close there. It won't take you long
[7:22] to get there. 8 verse 28. John 8:28.
[7:26] Then said Jesus unto them, when ye have
[7:29] lifted up the Son of Man, then then
[7:31] shall ye know that I am he, and that I
[7:34] do nothing of myself. But as my Father
[7:38] hath taught me, I speak these things.
[7:41] And he that sent me is with me. The
[7:44] Father hath not left me alone. For I do
[7:47] always those things that please him.
[7:52] Under submission, I don't act. I don't
[7:54] step out until I know my father's given
[7:57] the cue to do so. There's a there's a
[8:00] there's an example of a son. The last
[8:02] time that we uh talked about things, we
[8:06] talked about waiting. Uh we talked about
[8:08] waiting a little bit. Remember I took
[8:09] the scripture back with Moses where uh
[8:12] it said stand still and see the glory of
[8:14] God just before they come to the Red Sea
[8:17] and it said stand still. And then just a
[8:19] few scriptures later God tells Moses
[8:22] speak and go forward. Why are you
[8:23] crying? And I tried to balance those out
[8:26] to say it's important when God knows we
[8:28] can wait for him to move then we can
[8:30] move into the thing of him saying speak
[8:32] and go forward. So one of the things
[8:34] that I want to bring out tonight and
[8:36] that's very we we find the subject of
[8:38] waiting becomes very important in the
[8:41] new ministry in the third poll I was
[8:43] saying something Sunday that one of
[8:45] God's greatest assets to find to show
[8:48] you his will is time. And sometimes the
[8:52] more time you give something, you can
[8:54] really try uh find his will. But if you
[8:57] don't give it much time and you rush
[8:58] through it, uh you you might find
[9:01] yourself out of the will of God. But
[9:03] over time, God can show you signs and
[9:05] show you things that vindicate this is
[9:08] right. I can move on this now. So the
[9:10] other reason that we learn to wait is
[9:12] that this work must be a sovereign work
[9:17] of God.
[9:19] Can you say amen? If there's any other
[9:21] thing to talk about that needs to be and
[9:24] we need to know it has to be his
[9:27] sovereign work which means um I didn't
[9:30] write it down but sovereign is his
[9:32] authority. He has complete authority. It
[9:34] has to be him. He's Lord God. And so
[9:37] when we're under that then when he does
[9:39] this and the first of all we learned
[9:41] about the third pole. There's no
[9:42] imitation to this. God doesn't give any
[9:45] hints to it to the devil because he'll
[9:47] impersonate it. This will not be
[9:49] impersonated. He gives no symbols,
[9:51] nothing to know. It's just something
[9:53] powerful he's going to he's doing and he
[9:55] will do in the bride. Satan can't get
[9:58] his hands on it. Can you say amen? And
[10:00] and and so we understand that it it it
[10:02] can't be something that said but also it
[10:05] cannot have any human element in it.
[10:08] It's got to be a sovereign work of God.
[10:13] Amen. So this is another reason that we
[10:15] learn as sons how to wait on this until
[10:18] God does it his way because it has to at
[10:21] the end of it we have to say this is the
[10:23] sovereign work of God. God did this. No
[10:26] preacher did this. Can you say now now
[10:28] mind you he's going to do it through us.
[10:31] But at the end of it we'll say this was
[10:34] his work in me. No human nobody takes
[10:38] the glory none of this thing going on.
[10:41] You know that I did this I did this.
[10:43] We'll all know this was God that came
[10:45] and did this and it had and even
[10:48] unbelievers can testify sometimes that
[10:50] had to be God. That wasn't human. Can
[10:53] you say amen? So, so that's another
[10:55] reason why it's important to wait under
[10:58] this third pole. It will be done in us,
[11:01] but it is only done sovereign by him.
[11:04] And we only act when he says to speak.
[11:07] We only step out and act when he says to
[11:10] speak. In other words, this work is not
[11:13] something that uh can be based in our
[11:16] own enthusiasm.
[11:20] This new ministry cannot be based in us
[11:23] acting out of fear because that's
[11:26] another it's not a good motivator. But
[11:29] fear, even in parenting, people use fear
[11:32] as a motivator. That's not a good
[11:33] motivator. And so, uh, in the third
[11:36] poll, we can't act and just step out and
[11:38] try to produce something out of fear or
[11:41] out of something's not going on. We
[11:42] can't step out on our own in our own
[11:44] enthusiasm. And while we wait for him,
[11:47] we don't push ahead to try to make
[11:49] things happen. We can't do that with
[11:51] this. We can't push ahead and say
[11:54] nothing's going on. And then also, we
[11:56] don't presume something God is saying
[11:59] and then act. We can't presume under
[12:01] this third Paul. We can't just use our
[12:03] enthusiasm. We can't step out by just
[12:07] our own fear. We're going to make
[12:08] something happen. We got enough here to
[12:10] go on and so we're going to push
[12:12] forward. We don't presume something God
[12:14] is saying and then we act on it. We
[12:16] don't put words in God's mouth.
[12:20] Is this the spoken word of God? Yes, it
[12:22] is. Will it be on our lips? Yes, it is.
[12:24] But we don't put words in God's mouth
[12:26] and say, "God said this and he didn't
[12:29] say it."
[12:31] Amen. We don't put words in God's mouth.
[12:33] We don't manipulate an outcome that we
[12:36] want. That's another thing you can apply
[12:38] to the will of God. You don't manipulate
[12:40] the outcome that you want and then turn
[12:42] around and call it the will of God.
[12:45] There's a neutrality in praying about
[12:47] the will of God. And he said, brother
[12:49] said, "Pray until you become neutral."
[12:51] He didn't even say, "Pray for your need
[12:53] yet or what the will of God is." He
[12:54] said, "No, he just said, you better pray
[12:56] first that you become neutral because a
[12:58] lot of people, they're not really
[13:00] neutral." And so we watch, you know,
[13:02] someone and I've had people say, "God
[13:03] told me to do this." And I don't want to
[13:05] mock that because we want to respect it,
[13:07] but I have had examples and probably all
[13:10] of us had examples that we acted in our
[13:12] own enthusiasm and we called it God.
[13:16] You know, God gets blamed for a lot of
[13:18] things.
[13:20] And it wasn't really him. It was more us
[13:22] our own enthusiasm. Why? So So why am I
[13:25] saying we must learn how to wait? Yes.
[13:29] And so the new ministry is not this
[13:32] random sayings and just saying things
[13:34] for the purpose of just saying it that
[13:37] God said. I feel some people want to
[13:39] speak something sometimes that's of God
[13:43] to appear more spiritual than somebody
[13:46] else.
[13:48] Oh, come on now. Say amen to that, too.
[13:50] I feel sometimes people want to speak
[13:52] something to appear more spiritual to
[13:53] somebody else. And I'm not against uh
[13:56] craving to see more of God. We should
[13:58] have a craving and hunger to see more of
[14:01] God. Matter of fact, God uh works upon
[14:04] the faith of the people. In other words,
[14:06] he sees the faith. He sees the
[14:08] expecting. Um we under need to always be
[14:12] under
[14:13] expectation. Expectation is a wonderful
[14:16] thing. When we come to church, when we
[14:18] get up in the morning, we should be
[14:19] under expectations. So that's a healthy
[14:22] thing. We should have a craving for God
[14:24] do to mighty things. But we should have
[14:26] expectation. But we should not try to
[14:29] make it happen under our expectation.
[14:32] You say, "God, what are you going to do
[14:34] today? I am ready. I'm available to
[14:36] you." If he does something great, great,
[14:38] fine. If he does something little, fine.
[14:40] But I'm under expectation. God's going
[14:42] to do something. But we should never
[14:43] tell God what to do. We should never put
[14:46] our our words in his mouth. Can you say
[14:48] amen? So I am not speaking against a
[14:50] craving to see more of God if it's pure.
[14:54] Sometimes uh it's not a craving just to
[14:57] see God. It's a craving to be seen. It's
[15:00] a craving to be spiritual. It's a
[15:02] craving to be acknowledged and to
[15:04] impress people with saying God said. A
[15:07] craving to be praised and admired.
[15:10] Listen, we got to grow out of our uh uh
[15:13] uh young craving to just be accepted.
[15:16] and we're willing to do anything to be
[15:18] impressive and accepted by everybody. We
[15:20] should start first and say, "I want to
[15:22] be accepted by God." Matter of fact,
[15:24] when you know the revelation, he already
[15:26] accepted you at Calvary. He already paid
[15:29] the price for your sin. So, you're not
[15:31] even your working your way towards
[15:32] acceptance or God. Let me tell you, my
[15:34] brother and sister tonight, you've
[15:36] already been accepted by God.
[15:39] Praise the Lord. But people out of a
[15:41] craving to be praised and accepted,
[15:44] they'll go out of their way to impress
[15:46] everybody. And they do this in a
[15:48] spiritual way by saying, "God told me to
[15:51] do this and God told me to do that and
[15:53] this happened and this." I like to hear
[15:55] testimonies that are pure. But if it's
[15:57] tainted with a craving to be seen and to
[16:02] be more spiritual, it's tainted. If it's
[16:05] tainted, it's tainted. Well, that was
[16:06] profound, wasn't it?
[16:10] So, you know, um we we find then uh you
[16:14] know, I I've never been a follower of
[16:16] super spiritual people. Um I'm a I I
[16:20] like to see supernatural people and the
[16:23] supernatural is God. Not super
[16:24] spiritual, supernatural. Can you say
[16:26] amen? Because that's what he wants to
[16:28] do. It's something supernatural,
[16:30] something beyond you that God. But super
[16:32] spiritual people sometimes they can
[16:34] really they they look too much into
[16:36] things and they're looking to find God
[16:38] and every little thing and they go to
[16:40] interpret it and you know I I come to
[16:42] church tonight with two different pairs
[16:45] of socks on, two different colors and
[16:47] I'm just trying to figure out what God's
[16:49] trying to tell me and what is the
[16:51] symbolism and something's really
[16:53] significant about that and no, you just
[16:57] put on the wrong socks. You just got the
[17:00] wrong socks. Can you say amen? Don't try
[17:02] to read into it. And I've you I've maybe
[17:06] I'm a little bit cynical because I've
[17:07] seen so much of this especially in our
[17:10] own rank sometimes that people trying to
[17:12] make something out of something. You
[17:14] don't have to do that. Let God be God.
[17:16] Let him be sovereign. Be available for
[17:19] him. And then when he does it, testify
[17:21] of the Lord. So sons of God come into
[17:24] sunship. the same sunship that Jesus did
[17:27] with humility and submission that says I
[17:31] don't act unless the father shows me and
[17:34] has truly told me to act. I don't I do
[17:38] nothing except the father shows me. If I
[17:42] if I live my life I want to see it in
[17:44] the word and I know this is his word.
[17:45] This is the father's word. I want to see
[17:47] his word and if I know and feel solid
[17:49] it's in his word then I can step out and
[17:51] act on it and I want to live that life.
[17:53] I don't want to say, "Okay, there's just
[17:55] a few uh important verses in here and
[17:57] I'll try to catch the themes and and go
[17:59] with that and I'm just going to go with
[18:01] it in other things." We ought to mature
[18:02] to say if I can find the answers in his
[18:05] word and be feel solid about it, then I
[18:07] can step out on faith on that because
[18:09] our faith has to be based on something.
[18:12] Can't be based on our emotions. Can't be
[18:15] based on uncertainty. It's got to be
[18:17] based on the word, a father's word. I do
[18:20] nothing except my father shows me. So
[18:22] the sons of God, all sons and daughters
[18:24] of God, come into the same sunship as
[18:27] Jesus with a humility first and then a
[18:30] submission that says, "I don't act
[18:32] unless the father has truly told me to
[18:35] act." And this leads into a teaching
[18:38] about sons uh that uh that they need to
[18:41] grow into maturity, into discipline,
[18:44] into submission. The same Jesus, the
[18:47] same submission that Jesus had,
[18:48] submission of sons. Jesus had authority,
[18:52] but his authority was under the father's
[18:56] leadership. The bride has
[18:58] authority, but it has to be under his
[19:01] leadership.
[19:03] We have to act. Now, tonight we will
[19:05] find that there are some things we
[19:07] already have authority to do. They shall
[19:10] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[19:11] recover. That's God's promise. So, I
[19:13] don't need necessarily a word from the
[19:15] Lord. I already have one for that. So,
[19:17] we're separating two things here that
[19:19] there's certain things. Okay, I'm going
[19:20] to pray for somebody because the the
[19:22] word tells me I have the authority as a
[19:23] believer to do that and to believe that
[19:25] they'll be healed. And that happens all
[19:26] the time. God works in that. When we
[19:29] come into more the third pole and
[19:30] speaking something, we need to make sure
[19:32] that the Lord has spoken it to us to say
[19:34] and to proceed. Can you say amen?
[19:37] Because we realize if he speaks
[19:39] something like he did in the examples of
[19:41] the prophet then you have to know that
[19:43] he has said it before you step out on
[19:45] that. That's not something that lays
[19:47] there. That's something maybe he would
[19:49] uh uh uh tell you to do. You want to
[19:52] make sure of that. So now it was Jesus
[19:54] was under the father's leadership and
[19:56] that's when the authority is perfectly
[19:58] correct. Otherwise authority can be used
[20:01] the wrong way. Oh, how that is another
[20:03] subject tonight that we could talk about
[20:06] or some other time is that uh authority
[20:10] when it's under the right authority is
[20:12] perfectly correct. Otherwise, authority
[20:15] even what it says to you in the word can
[20:18] be used the wrong way. Parental
[20:20] authority, you may have it according to
[20:23] the Bible, but you may use it the wrong
[20:25] way. See, God doesn't want his authority
[20:28] used the wrong way. God doesn't want you
[20:30] overstepping bounds with your
[20:32] authority. Uh overstepping boundaries,
[20:35] you you can't do that. You have it. The
[20:38] scripture says a husband can do that cuz
[20:40] he has he's the the head over the wife.
[20:42] But oh, how he can misuse of his
[20:44] authority if he's not under authority.
[20:46] So that's how it works. And so Jesus had
[20:49] it, but he wants God wants mature sons
[20:51] to be able to handle it. And so the the
[20:54] sons of God who muh who are growing in
[20:56] maturity and becoming ready for this
[20:58] third pearl are this is the distinction.
[21:02] They're they are uh they they are
[21:04] wanting to live in a sovereign work of
[21:07] God or his sovereign voice to be in it
[21:11] before they
[21:13] act. And they would rather wait for no
[21:16] matter how long it takes to wait to wait
[21:19] for the sovereign move of God.
[21:22] That's mature
[21:24] sons. We look for the God moments.
[21:28] We wait for the God moments that we can
[21:30] it's undeniable this is our God. Our
[21:33] supernatural God has spoken in this and
[21:36] he has stepped in and we all stand back
[21:38] and everybody nobody can deny this was
[21:41] God. This was a sovereign move. Even a
[21:43] revival I like to be able to say there's
[21:46] a revival start. It's a sovereign
[21:48] revival of God. It it wasn't necessarily
[21:50] that we mechanically made it happen or
[21:53] worked it up by the music or worked it
[21:56] up by emotion or the preachers worked it
[21:58] up. I like it to know that we were just
[22:01] ready and available and we were open to
[22:03] what God did. And God sovereignly sends
[22:05] a revival in our hearts. It has to be
[22:08] sovereign. It can't be humanmade or
[22:10] pressed or emotionally built up. And
[22:13] this is what sons of God are learning.
[22:15] The sons of God who are maturing and
[22:16] becoming ready for this third pole are
[22:19] looking for a sovereign work of God or
[22:21] his sovereign voice to be heard in it.
[22:23] And they would rather wait for that. No
[22:25] matter how long it takes to wait, we
[22:27] look for those God moments when it's and
[22:29] uh and when it's done. No one can deny
[22:33] at all that the sovereign God did it and
[22:35] no one can claim glory for it. That's
[22:39] right. Hallelujah. In the biblical I did
[22:41] write down what sovereign means here. It
[22:43] means it describes God's supreme
[22:46] authority and power over creation
[22:48] encompassing his right to govern the
[22:51] universe according to what? His will. So
[22:55] if we're looking for the sovereign God
[22:57] to move in and the sovereign God to
[22:58] speak to us what to do before we move,
[23:01] we're looking for we're under his
[23:02] authority and now he's going to he's
[23:05] been given the right to govern
[23:07] situations and to govern things
[23:09] according to his will, not your will.
[23:11] And so we're looking for a sovereign
[23:13] God. We should be looking for that in
[23:15] our lives too every day. You know, it's
[23:18] it's him stepping in. It's him leading.
[23:21] Can you say amen? And sons of God are
[23:23] led by the spirit of God. So we wait for
[23:26] that. Uh we prefer it to be that way.
[23:30] Not say, "Well, uh nothing is happening
[23:33] here. Oh, nothing's happening. So let's
[23:35] make something happen." No.
[23:38] This is part of maturing and waiting on
[23:40] God as well. How long do I have to wait,
[23:43] brother
[23:44] Paul? However long it takes until a
[23:47] sovereign God moves in. This is part of
[23:49] the maturity as sons of God. How long do
[23:51] we have to wait? Sometimes your attitude
[23:54] gets revealed in the
[23:56] waiting. So that's a good thing. And I
[23:58] think some of the other brothers have
[23:59] been preaching on that, brother Brandon
[24:01] and different ones. It's it's uh
[24:04] sometimes your attitude gets revealed in
[24:06] the waiting and you have a bad attitude
[24:08] and it's an immature attitude. So maybe
[24:11] that's one of the reasons why there was
[24:12] waiting is to reveal that bad attitude
[24:15] and to reveal that explosion that takes
[24:17] place and I don't know why God's not
[24:18] answering and all these other things.
[24:20] Well, God's got to deal with that first.
[24:22] Um kind of like on the boat with Jesus,
[24:25] he had to deal with the disciples uh
[24:27] lack of faith. He was more interested in
[24:29] their fear and their lack of faith than
[24:31] he was speaking to the storm. And I've
[24:33] said it, he'd rather speak to your fear
[24:35] before he speaks to your storm. He'd
[24:38] rather deal with your lack of faith and
[24:40] deal with your fear because the same
[24:41] Jesus that can speak to the storm can
[24:43] speak to your fear. Can you say amen?
[24:47] And so, you know, this is how God deals
[24:49] with sons now. Not not immature just
[24:52] people, flighty people that's not all in
[24:53] the kingdom. We're talking about sons
[24:55] that want to mature. or if Andrew or
[24:57] Peter up in the upper room even in the
[24:59] upper room if Andrew would have said
[25:01] stepped there and say brothers you know
[25:02] it's been 5 days and we know what's
[25:05] supposed to come according to the
[25:06] scripture it's here in the Bible why
[25:08] don't we just get going and go to
[25:10] preaching and brother Brandham gives
[25:11] that example is that they if they
[25:13] weren't willing to wait and just say
[25:14] let's just believe and go on but the
[25:16] promise of the Holy Ghost was supposed
[25:18] to come and you had to wait for that
[25:19] real thing to be fulfilled and if they
[25:22] said let's you know brothers it's been
[25:24] five days already we understandless.
[25:26] Let's go forward. No. Brother Bram says
[25:29] they had to wait for a response back for
[25:32] God to do his work according to the
[25:35] word. So if if the day of Pentecost is
[25:38] that way, then how much more now under
[25:40] this third poll that we don't stand up
[25:43] and say, "Let's try to make it happen.
[25:45] Let's take off. Let's interpret it.
[25:47] Let's do it. Let's do it." No, let's not
[25:49] do it until God sovereignly does it. Is
[25:51] that okay with everybody? So I think
[25:54] that's a good example. And there's many
[25:55] other examples in the scripture to show
[25:57] the importance of waiting, but
[25:59] especially in this hour. They said, "Why
[26:01] don't we just go and preach?" No, stay
[26:02] there until you know a sovereign God has
[26:05] answered back in his promise and you can
[26:07] say, "This is the word being fulfilled.
[26:10] This is truly a sovereign work of God."
[26:12] This principle is for sure applied to
[26:15] the third pole
[26:17] of waiting until God says says the time
[26:21] to go.
[26:23] But do you know there's enough examples
[26:25] this also applies to even the nine
[26:28] spiritual gifts in the
[26:30] church that we should not act in our own
[26:35] enthusiasm and humanism. This is the
[26:37] part you get into with the nine
[26:38] spiritual gifts. Um we're not talking
[26:40] about a gift of a prophet. We're not
[26:42] talking about what God does in the
[26:44] spoken word and the bride at the end.
[26:46] We're talking about the nine spiritual
[26:47] gifts which we believe in that are
[26:48] scriptural. You're just ready. You're
[26:50] available. You wait on God. He can use
[26:53] you with a word of wisdom, a prayer over
[26:55] the sick. Read the other nine spiritual
[26:57] gifts in First Corinthians. That's why
[26:58] from the youngest teenager, get the Holy
[27:01] Ghost. Yield to the Lord. God can use
[27:03] you in one of the nine spiritual gifts.
[27:05] They're in the church ready to God wants
[27:07] to use it. But you have to you have to
[27:09] give your life over and have the Holy
[27:11] Ghost and then say, "Lord, you use me
[27:13] for whatever way." But but guess what?
[27:15] You don't give yourself a gift. You
[27:17] don't push your way into it. You don't
[27:19] come to church and say, "Well, what gift
[27:20] can I can manifest today?" You don't say
[27:22] any of that. You're just filled, sitting
[27:24] there, ready. If God uses you this week
[27:27] and he and he or he doesn't or if he
[27:29] uses you 10 years from now, it doesn't
[27:31] matter when. You're waiting for God to
[27:33] use you. But you don't legislate and you
[27:36] don't push
[27:38] anything. Now, if that's true with the
[27:40] nine spiritual gifts, how about this
[27:42] third Paul? We don't make things happen.
[27:45] We don't push the gifts.
[27:48] I preach
[27:49] expectation and preachers can preach
[27:52] certain expectations and they can get
[27:54] result of what they're wanting. So I
[27:56] have to be very careful what
[27:58] expectations I preach the people under
[28:01] because whatever you preach that's
[28:03] probably what you'll get but they better
[28:05] be the right expectations or you're
[28:07] misleading God's people. Thank you for
