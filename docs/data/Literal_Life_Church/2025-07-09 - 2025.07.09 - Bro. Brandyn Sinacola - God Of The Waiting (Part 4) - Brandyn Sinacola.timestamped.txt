[12:14] this king who wore their crown and they
[12:18] gladly watch their champion go down."
[12:24] Hallelujah. But
[12:27] I will never count him out. For I am a
[12:32] witness of the day he rose to retain the
[12:38] title chair
[12:41] [Music]
[12:43] of
[12:46] his
[12:48] higher than the highest.
[12:52] He's gater than the grave. No one could
[12:58] ever take his
[13:02] [Music]
[13:05] mighty

[13:09] he
[13:11] from above.
[13:13] Hallelujah.
[13:15] Hallelujah.
[13:16] Yes.
[13:18] He's the alltime
[13:22] uneasy
[13:24] [Music]
[13:26] champion
[13:28] of love.
[13:31] I say praise the Lord. We're ser
[13:33] champions tonight. He's a champion.
[13:36] Amen. That means he's won the battle.
[13:38] He's already won the battle for your
[13:41] life as well. Give him praise tonight.
[13:44] Hallelujah. Blessed be his holy name.
[13:47] Praise the Lord. He's already overcome
[13:49] and that means we can overcome as well.
[13:52] There isn't anything that we can't put
[13:54] under our feet because he's already put
[13:56] it under his feet. Praise the Lord. And
[13:58] the re very reason he says in
[14:00] Revelations 3 that to him that
[14:02] overcomemeth there will be some
[14:04] overcomers even to this age in the last
[14:06] days because he overcome will even
[14:09] overcome in Leodysia. I don't care what
[14:12] problem or what thing that you are
[14:13] looking at. It'll never be bigger than
[14:16] our God. It'll need never be bigger than
[14:18] what God has sent us through this
[14:20] message. Can you say amen? It can never
[14:22] be bigger than that. He's greater than
[14:23] all of it. Praise the Lord. Uh Gideon
[14:25] was talking about our promises. Let's
[14:27] sing He's promised to hold my hand.
[14:29] Let's sing that tonight and worship the
[14:31] Lord as brother Brandon comes. Praise
[14:33] the Lord. Do you love him tonight?

[14:39] my hand. He's promised to help me stand
[14:44] when the valley's too low and the river
[14:47] is too wide. His promise to lead me to
[14:51] the other side. Oh, his promise is a
[14:54] light my way. Never let my feet to stay.
[15:01] And living in his word, I will overcome.
[15:05] Standing on his promises. Sing it again.
[15:08] Oh, he's promised to hold my hand. He
[15:14] promised to help. We stand with the
[15:18] valleys too low and the rivers too wide.
[15:22] He promised he would lead me to the
[15:24] others. I believe his promise to light
[15:28] my way. Never let my feet to stray.

[16:18] [Music]
[16:20] Amen. God bless you this evening.
[16:23] Uh usually I attempt to sing something,
[16:25] but I might just forego it for right now
[16:27] until I've got back up here with me. If
[16:32] you want to open your scripture to
[16:33] Hebrews chapter 12.
[16:37] Hebrews chapter 12. And appreciate the
[16:40] opportunity to and the trust to speak to
[16:43] you tonight. And I do pray that you'd be
[16:45] blessed by the word of God. And
[16:50] because that's that's what we're here
[16:51] for, right? That's the main event.
[16:57] Hebrews 12 and verse one.
[17:05] Yes. Wherefore, seeing we also are
[17:08] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[17:10] witnesses. So this is after Hebrews 11,
[17:13] the the the hero chapter, the heroes of
[17:16] faith. Wherefore, seeing we also are
[17:18] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[17:20] witnesses, let us lay aside every weight
[17:23] and the sin which does so easily beset
[17:25] us, and let us run with patience the
[17:28] race that is set before us, looking unto
[17:31] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[17:34] faith, who for the joy that was set
[17:36] before him endured the cross, despising
[17:38] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[17:41] hand of the throne of God. Let's pray
[17:44] and then we'll read a couple more
[17:45] scriptures. Lord Jesus, we come before
[17:47] you as we look into your face to behold
[17:50] you. We just ask that you'd reveal
[17:52] yourself to us. Lord, help us each to
[17:54] get out of the way now. And I just pray
[17:56] that you would you would really reveal
[17:59] yourself. That's that's my heart
[18:00] tonight. We ask these things in Jesus'
[18:02] name. Amen.
[18:04] Amen. You can be seated and um you can
[18:07] turn there if you want or I'll just
[18:08] breeze through them here quickly. Romans
[18:10] 5:5.
[18:12] Romans 5:5.
[18:16] Now they're quick on the draw.
[18:17] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[18:20] have peace with God through our Lord
[18:22] Jesus Christ, by whom also we have
[18:24] access by faith into his grace, wherein
[18:27] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[18:30] glory of God. And not only so, did I I
[18:34] think I told you wrong, right? Verse
[18:35] three.
[18:37] Okay. And not only so, but we glory in
[18:40] tribulations also, knowing that
[18:42] tribulation workketh patience, and
[18:44] patience experience, and experience
[18:46] hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,
[18:49] because the love of God is shed abroad
[18:51] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which
[18:54] is given unto us. And then one more just
[18:56] laying the foundation scriptures here.
[18:58] James 1 verse two. My brethren, count it
[19:02] all joy when you fall into diverse
[19:04] temptations, knowing this, that the
[19:06] trying of your faith workketh patience.
[19:09] But let patience have her perfect work,
[19:11] that ye may be perfect and entire,
[19:14] meaning your faith fully developed,
[19:16] wanting or lacking nothing.
[19:20] So, I'm just I'm going to I'm going to
[19:23] continue um in my my thought here and
[19:25] try to wrap it up tonight. um just on
[19:27] God, God of the waiting, God who owns
[19:30] the waiting, if I could say it that way.
[19:32] He's the God in the waiting with you in
[19:34] those waiting times. And then um I came
[19:36] up with a better title, but it was a
[19:38] little too late cuz I had already had
[19:40] three of them. But sometimes God lingers
[19:42] and that that just we'll read that
[19:44] tonight, but sometimes God lingers. And
[19:47] uh in particular, we've just kind of the
[19:50] channel that I've been in found that in
[19:52] the redemptive names of God that you
[19:54] could find that they the redemptive
[19:56] names were were if I could say birthed
[19:59] or revealed out of out of a a trial out
[20:02] of a a trial of faith. And so um so far
[20:05] it's holding true and even in Jehovah
[20:08] Rafa which is um I'm going to speak a
[20:10] little bit on tonight but I just I don't
[20:12] want to focus so much on healing though
[20:14] I'll be talking about it a lot but uh
[20:16] just just the fact that you know the
[20:18] scripture like the scripture said
[20:19] there's there's Jehovah Rafa and
[20:21] sometimes healing it doesn't come in a
[20:24] miracle it comes in a divine healing
[20:26] which takes some time and in that time
[20:28] is is when God reveals himself I am the
[20:31] Lord that heals all of your diseases.
[20:33] So when it's a miracle, then okay,
[20:35] great. We can we can get it and go. But
[20:37] when it takes some time, he's still
[20:39] Jehovah Rafa.
[20:40] Doesn't matter how much time it takes.
[20:42] So I just pray, you know, we'll catch
[20:44] the balance because, you know, we we've
[20:46] heard some wonderful testimonies and
[20:48] some some wonderful word and and I think
[20:50] if we grab a hold of it, we can have
[20:52] what we have need of right now. You can
[20:54] leave here healed tonight. I believe
[20:56] that with all of my heart, but it
[20:58] doesn't always happen that way. It
[21:00] doesn't always happen that way. And so
[21:01] in those times when it doesn't happen,
[21:03] you know, I'll speak a little bit more
[21:04] on faith, but you know, then the devil
[21:07] can get in there and he can start
[21:08] talking to you. Well, is is God a
[21:10] healer? Does God care about you? Where's
[21:12] your faith at? Do you really have faith?
[21:14] Do you have the Holy Ghost? And all of
[21:16] those questions for a Christian, I mean,
[21:18] let's be real. Those things, those
[21:19] affect us because, you know, we we we
[21:22] want to know God. We want to be right
[21:23] with God. And and so just continuing
[21:26] down that path a little bit and wind it
[21:28] up. I've got a couple lengthy quotes
[21:30] tonight that have just been driving this
[21:32] in my heart and and I just can't get
[21:33] away from them. So, we're going to read
[21:35] them tonight and and hopefully wrap this
[21:37] up. But, so, um,
[21:40] uh, goodness, we're clipping along here.
[21:44] So, I've realized that the redemptive
[21:46] names of God were revealed in their hour
[21:49] and continue through the Bible to us
[21:51] today. So there was an hour, there was a
[21:53] timing that God revealed himself as
[21:55] Jehovah Gyra. And then there was a time
[21:57] he revealed himself as Jehovah Rafa. And
[21:59] it doesn't end just when he reveals it.
[22:01] That's it. And now we move on. But that
[22:03] that extends all the way through all the
[22:06] way to time all the way till today.
[22:08] Regardless of the circumstances we're
[22:10] in, it doesn't matter what the
[22:11] circumstance that you're in. You say,
[22:13] "Well, I God didn't ask me to offer up
[22:15] my firstborn son." Well, he doesn't have
[22:17] to. That the Jehovah Gyra still applies
[22:20] today. So if we have a need, we can call
[22:23] on God and he will answer. You have that
[22:26] promise. God will answer if you call
[22:28] because if God ever was something, he
[22:31] has to be the same all the time.
[22:33] So if he ever was Jehovah Gyra, he
[22:35] always was and always is Jehovah Gyra.
[22:38] And if he ever was Jehovah Rafa, he
[22:41] always is and always was Jehovah Rafa.
[22:44] And so because he's the same yesterday,
[22:46] today, and forever. Because Jehovah of
[22:49] the old is Jesus of the new. Correct?
[22:52] So he So we know these things and we
[22:54] know we've heard some just some
[22:56] beautiful things lately that he he is.
[22:59] God is and his name is I am.
[23:02] So he's omnisient means he knows
[23:04] everything. He's omnipotent. He's all
[23:07] powerful. And he's omnipresent. He's
[23:09] present all the time everywhere.
[23:11] So you can get your prayer answered here
[23:13] in Michigan as they can get it over in
[23:15] Nigeria. Amen.
[23:16] Amen.
[23:18] It's the same Holy Spirit. And so if we
[23:20] look to Jesus, then we can see light in
[23:22] our darkest hours.
[23:24] If we look beyond the burden of the
[23:26] cross we bear of of of the the situation
[23:29] we're in and look to the author and
[23:31] finisher of our faith, like our
[23:33] scripture, then there's joy that's set
[23:35] before us. But you have to you have to
[23:38] it's what you're looking at. If you're
[23:39] looking at your circumstances, then we
[23:41] get down and we get discouraged. If if
[23:43] we look at what we're going through, if
[23:45] we look at what's weighing on us, but if
[23:46] we look to the author and finisher of
[23:49] everything, not just of your faith, but
[23:51] of their faith, of of that situation
[23:53] over there, of your situation and how
[23:55] it's affecting others, if you look to
[23:57] that author and finisher, then we have
[23:59] light in our darkest hour.
[24:02] It's a joy that's set before us. The the
[24:05] challenge of the hour is keeping our
[24:07] eyes fixed on him. There's a lot of
[24:09] distraction. There's a lot of things in
[24:11] this age that takes us away from the
[24:13] word of God and you know we we have to
[24:15] work and things but but beside outside
[24:18] of work there's social media and things
[24:20] there's so many things that are I and
[24:22] and I'll just be honest with you there's
[24:24] so many things that are more appealing G
[24:26] just give me a little leeway here.
[24:28] There's things that are more appealing
[24:29] than sitting down and reading the word
[24:31] of God to your flesh.
[24:33] Your flesh is going to gravitate towards
[24:35] something other than the word of God.
[24:36] But when you but really when you're done
[24:38] you you you have an empty feeling. But
[24:40] if you go to the word even though you
[24:42] might be dog tired when you're done you
[24:44] fulfill you feel full. You feel
[24:46] fulfilled.
[24:49] So but but how he reveals himself to us
[24:52] in these things is up to him. He's all
[24:55] these things but what that looks like in
[24:57] our situation we don't know. We don't
[24:59] know how he'll come. We just know he's
[25:01] going to come.
[25:02] We don't know how your healing will come
[25:04] but your healing will come.
[25:06] We just know that he that that he will
[25:09] perform his word. And so if you can pull
[25:11] up I think this is my first my first
[25:13] quote.
[25:16] I I I came to a realization. I had a
[25:19] little revelation. I I can't hardly see
[25:21] that screen too clearly. So I brought my
[25:24] pair of glasses just in case I struggle
[25:26] with this. But the problem is is I have
[25:28] two pairs of glasses. One for distance
[25:30] and one So I didn't know which one to
[25:31] bring. What I realized though is that
[25:33] when I turned 30, my check engine light
[25:36] came on and I kept driving it hard and
[25:40] then here we are.
[25:42] Suffering brings patience, works
[25:44] tribulations to bring patience, of
[25:46] course. Now patience makes love and
[25:49] trust. So it takes suffering and
[25:51] tribulation to bring patience. And the
[25:54] result of patience is love and trust.
[25:59] Now faithfulness and patience go
[26:02] together. In fact, patience is the
[26:04] outcome of faithfulness. For it says in
[26:06] James 1:3, "The trying of your faith
[26:08] workketh patience." There is absolutely
[26:11] no other way. I really can't see that
[26:14] there is absolutely no other way in
[26:16] which to gain patience. It has to come
[26:19] by the trial of your faith.
[26:22] Romans 5:3, "Tribulation workketh
[26:24] patience." How highly God regards this
[26:27] outworking of our patience is seen in
[26:30] James 1:4. But let patience have our
[26:32] perfect work, that ye may be imperfect
[26:34] and entire, lacking nothing. God's will
[26:36] for us is perfection. And that
[26:38] perfection is patience. Now listen, he's
[26:42] going to define patience. Patience
[26:44] waiting on God and waiting for God. This
[26:48] is the process of character development.
[26:53] We know the only thing we take to heaven
[26:55] with us is our character.
[26:57] How is character molded?
[26:59] Through patience.
[27:01] What is patience? Waiting on God and
[27:03] waiting for God.
[27:06] You can you can just um you can leave
[27:08] that up for a minute. Hebrews 10:36,
[27:11] "For ye have need of patience, that
[27:14] after ye have done the will of God, ye
[27:17] might receive the promise."
[27:19] The word patience that Paul used in the
[27:21] book of Hebrews means endurance.
[27:22] Endurance means enduring hard things
[27:25] over a long period of time. So this will
[27:28] either really minister to you or you'll
[27:30] really dislike me by the end of the
[27:31] service.
[27:33] But this but this this next quote really
[27:35] summarizes my heart. And so I just want
[27:38] to recap just a couple quick things
[27:40] brother Rap said on Sunday um that I
[27:42] realized for me that this this next
[27:44] quote is is it's been to me like the
[27:47] beginning of the book of Job. You get a
[27:49] you get a glimpse into the other
[27:50] dimension. What's going on in the other
[27:52] dimension? And though it might not be
[27:54] the whole explanation as why it it to me
[27:58] it ministered to me that this is part of
[28:01] the reason why we go through trials and
[28:03] they take some time.
[28:05] So um but so we get that glimpse in what
[28:08] I'm about to read to you but in in in in
[28:11] essence the reason why Job experiences
[28:13] trial although a lot was accomplished in
[28:15] his life through his sufferings. So
[28:17] brother Rap wonderfully put it Sunday uh
[28:20] there was a trial taking place that Job
[28:22] was about to be called to the witness
[28:24] stand and that trial wasn't Job which is
[28:27] what I always thought also but God was
[28:29] being put on trial
[28:31] and Job was being called to the witness
[28:33] stand. So something else brother Rap
[28:36] said was we don't need a reason why as
[28:38] much as we need a person
[28:41] and we don't need an explanation but we
[28:43] need a promise.
[28:45] Amen.
[28:45] So the why really isn't the question we
[28:47] need to be asking. What we should be
[28:49] asking is Lord what can I get out of
[28:51] this?
[28:51] That's right.
[28:52] Can I know can I know you more through
[28:55] this?
[28:56] And and so this just lines up perfect
[28:58] with the looking to the author and
[29:00] finisher of our faith.
[29:03] So just just bear with me. It's a little
[29:05] long here, but Revelations 3:10, because
[29:07] thou hast kept the word of my patience,
[29:09] I also will keep thee from the hour of
[29:11] temptation, which shall come upon all
[29:13] the world to try them that dwell upon
[29:15] the earth. What does he mean by the word
[29:17] of my patience? Hebrews 6:13-15.
[29:20] For when God made promise to Abraham,
[29:22] because he could swear by no greater, he
[29:25] swear by himself, saying, Surely
[29:27] blessing I will bless thee, and
[29:28] multiplying I will multiply thee. And so
[29:31] after he had patiently endured, he
[29:33] obtained the promise. You see, the
[29:35] spirit is speaking about the word of God
[29:37] which is given to us. To wait for the
[29:40] fulfillment of that word required
[29:42] patience even as it did in the case of
[29:44] Abraham.
[29:46] He endured as seeing him who is
[29:48] invisible. He was patient and then the
[29:50] word finally was fulfilled. This is the
[29:52] way God teaches his people patience.
[29:55] Why? If he fulfilled his word in
[29:58] physical manifestation the very instant
[30:00] you prayed, you would never learn
[30:03] patience, but would become even more
[30:05] impatient with life.
[30:08] Let me show you this truth even more
[30:10] fully set forth. Hebrews 11:17. By faith
[30:13] Abraham, when he was tried, offered up
[30:15] Isaac, and he that had received the
[30:17] promise, the word of God, offered up his
[30:19] only begotten son. There it is. Catch
[30:22] this now. Abraham was tried after he
[30:25] received the word of promise. Most think
[30:28] that as soon as we pray in Jesus' name
[30:30] over the good promises of God that there
[30:32] could be not be a trial. But here it
[30:35] says that Abraham was tried after he
[30:37] received the promise. That is exactly
[30:39] correct according to the psalmist
[30:41] referring to Joseph uh Psalms 105:19.
[30:44] Until the time that his word came, the
[30:46] word of the Lord tried him. God gives us
[30:49] exceeding great and precious promises.
[30:51] Can you say amen? He was promised to
[30:53] fulfill them and he will. But from the
[30:56] time we pray until the time we get the
[30:59] answer, we must learn to receive
[31:01] patience into our souls. For only in
[31:04] patience do we possess life.
[31:07] May God help us to learn this lesson.
[31:09] Even as we know the people of the sixth
[31:11] age learn patience, we read the history
[31:13] of the lives of these great Christians.
[31:15] What a contrast we see between their
[31:17] lives and ours. For there they were so
[31:20] patient and quiet. and today we are all
[31:22] but overcome and over impatience and
[31:24] haste. He goes on to say to them,
[31:26] because you because you have taken my
[31:28] word and lived it and thereby become
[31:30] patient, I will keep you from the hour
[31:32] of temptation. So So why do we go
[31:35] through these things? To receive
[31:36] patience. Why do we receive patience? To
[31:38] keep us from the hour of temptation
[31:41] uh that's coming upon the world to try
[31:43] them that dwell upon the earth. Now here
[31:45] again we see the overlapping of the two
[31:46] ages. For the promise has to do with the
[31:49] end of the gentile period, which
[31:51] culminates in the great tribulation. I
[31:53] also will keep thee from the hour of
[31:55] temptation, which shall come upon all
[31:56] the world to try them that dwell upon
[31:58] the earth. This verse is not a
[32:00] declaration that the true church will go
[32:03] into and through the tribulation. If it
[32:05] meant that, it would have said it. But
[32:06] it said, "I will keep thee from the hour
[32:08] of temptation." This temptation is
[32:10] exactly like the temptation in Eden. It
[32:13] will be a very inviting proposition held
[32:15] up in direct opposition to God's
[32:17] commanded word. And yet from the
[32:19] standpoint of human reasoning, it will
[32:21] be so very right, so enlightening and
[32:24] lifegiving as to fool the world. Only
[32:26] the very elect will not be fooled. So if
[32:29] you want, if I can give you a little bit
[32:30] of homework, go finish that quote
[32:32] because then he says what that
[32:34] temptation is going to look like. So
[32:37] it's a it's it's it's very inviting. But
[32:39] so why does God linger? Why do we go
[32:42] through such times of waiting on the
[32:44] Lord? There's a great purpose in God's
[32:46] mind. We will need patience to fulfill
[32:48] that scripture. It would deceive the
[32:50] very elect if it were possible.
[32:53] How do you how do you not be deceived?
[32:56] By receiving patience. Why isn't it
[32:59] possible to deceive the very elect?
[33:00] Because she's learned patience and thus
[33:02] God grants her to be kept from the hour
[33:04] of temptation. And it and it's such a
[33:07] deceiving hour. It's such a deceiving
[33:09] thing. When you when you read the rest
[33:10] of this quote, you'll he says it'll be
[33:13] such an enticing temptation because
[33:15] it'll seem like it's better to serve God
[33:18] publicly than not to serve him publicly.
[33:20] And every Christian wants to be wants to
[33:23] you want your Christianity on display.
[33:25] We know that we should have it on
[33:26] display, but there will come an hour
[33:28] when it becomes so so down and so that
[33:31] those vines just wrap up so tightly
[33:33] together that that it'll seem like,
[33:35] well, it's better to join in with this
[33:37] than to not be called a Christian
[33:39] publicly. And so that'll be the
[33:41] temptation, but we need patience
[33:43] received into our souls. So, you can
[33:46] take that down for just a few minutes.
[33:47] So, I just want to step back a little
[33:49] bit and just recap. I think I might have
[33:51] said a couple of these things, but just
[33:52] to expound a little bit more on faith.
[33:54] Brother Lonnie Jenkins said, "It hinders
[33:56] our faith looking for something that God
[33:58] didn't promise rather than resting in
[34:01] the word." He said, "We scar our own
[34:03] faith looking for something that God
[34:05] didn't promise."
[34:07] Now, we said before how we can we can
[34:09] come presuming and be enthused rather
[34:11] than have faith. Enthusiasm is the has
[34:14] the opposite effect and it hinders our
[34:17] faith when we when we don't get what
[34:19] we're looking for. We can come up and
[34:21] and you know and and and us ministers
[34:23] can be guilty of it of building that up
[34:25] and then the people come and they expect
[34:27] to walk away healed. But when you don't,
[34:29] your faith actually is hindered.
[34:32] It's it's it's it's a it's a scar in
[34:34] your faith. And even if we know that
[34:36] something's not quite right with it, we
[34:38] can give ourselves to it. And then
[34:40] there's there's just a little hindrance
[34:42] that we walk away with.
[34:44] So, and I just want to point this out
[34:47] again. The angel of the Lord rebuked the
[34:49] prophet,
[34:51] telling him he's putting too much
[34:53] emphasis on miracles.
[34:55] That if he doesn't stop, the people
[34:56] won't believe him unless they see a
[34:58] miracle. Now, I'm just going to
[35:00] reiterate. I'm not saying the days of
[35:02] miracles is passed. I don't believe that
[35:04] for a minute, but I'm bringing a balance
[35:06] because I think through many many years,
[35:09] maybe many things that have come up, you
[35:11] know, people's faith can be hindered,
[35:13] but it's because we're we're not looking
[35:15] for the right thing. We're not looking
[35:16] for what God's word said. We're looking
[35:19] for what we thought the word said.
[35:22] Brother Brandham said he saw one time
[35:24] when the entire congregation was healed
[35:26] all simultaneously, all at once. And he
[35:29] said, "I'm longing to see that again."
[35:32] He was looking for that again. His
[35:33] motive and his objective were pure. They
[35:36] were right. But it must have been his
[35:38] enthusiasm that God's a healer that he
[35:41] made this bold proclamation. You
[35:43] remember early on in the prayer lines,
[35:44] bring me bring us your worst cases.
[35:47] Miracle lines they were advertising it.
[35:50] He saw miracle after miracle that God
[35:52] did. And so he threw out his challenge
[35:55] to God's people to believe. But I was
[35:57] thinking about this today and hopefully
[35:59] I can just bring it in in the in the
[36:00] right manner, the right balance. But the
[36:02] angel told brother Brandham, he said,
[36:04] "If you can get the people to believe
[36:06] you, but how is he supposed to get the
[36:08] people to believe?" Now, he was given
[36:11] two signs, we know, but the discernment
[36:13] of heart is done by the word. Just
[36:16] because brother Brandham's gone doesn't
[36:17] mean discernment of hearts is gone and
[36:20] done away with. Discernment of heart
[36:22] came by the Holy Spirit whose Jesus
[36:25] Christ the word and the word is quick
[36:28] and powerful and sharper and a discerner
[36:30] of the thoughts and intents of the
[36:31] heart. So, Brother Brandham was rebuked
[36:33] by the angel pushing come see a miracle.
[36:36] God performs miracles all the time, but
[36:38] in some ways a push for a miracle is
[36:40] almost like and and and I'm not I'm I'm
[36:42] treading careful trying to, but it's it
[36:44] I'm not saying Brother Brandon was doing
[36:46] this because he talked about it later
[36:47] on, but it it was almost like pushing
[36:50] for a miracle was almost like a like,
[36:52] hey, I got a party trip for you.
[36:55] I hope that's okay to say, but you know,
[36:57] I I was just I thought about it later
[36:59] and I thought, man, Brother Brandham,
[37:00] all he he said, well, God does God
[37:02] doesn't just clown around. this isn't
[37:05] just a gift to clown around with. And so
[37:07] I don't think brother Brandham did it
[37:09] intentionally, but I just thought maybe
[37:11] maybe that's why the angel didn't like
[37:13] it. But when he corrected course and
[37:15] brought it back to the word, that was
[37:16] the way it was supposed to happen. Jesus
[37:19] Christ, the word of God, is the one who
[37:21] does the miracles. So we can say there's
[37:24] miracles in the word.
[37:26] There's healing in the word. There's
[37:28] deliverance in the word. And there's
[37:30] patience in the word. Yeah.
[37:34] So, what we learn from these things is
[37:35] let God anoint your faith how he wants
[37:38] to perform his word.
[37:41] Hold on to the promise by faith and
[37:43] don't let it go. Don't let it go until
[37:46] he anoints your faith.
[37:48] You may you may not feel anything
[37:50] different, but you've planted a seed of
[37:52] his word. Plant a seed of God's word and
[37:55] then just walk in it.
[37:56] There was two cases that that came to
[37:58] mind as I've been studying this and and
[38:01] just refreshing myself with them. I
[38:03] believe the gentleman's name was John
[38:04] Ryan. You remember he was he was a
[38:06] colored fella and and he he was blind
[38:09] and uh he came up and he came through
[38:11] the prayer line. Brother Brandham prayed
[38:13] for him and he said, you know, go go
[38:14] your way. You're healed. And so he he
[38:16] goes off and he goes out into the
[38:18] audience and then nothing happened. And
[38:20] so he so his friend brought him back up
[38:22] and he said, hey, he said, you know, I I
[38:26] I thought you said I was healed. Brother
[38:27] Brandham's response was, I thought you
[38:29] said you believed.
[38:33] And so he said, "Well, what am I
[38:35] supposed to do?" And he said, "Well, you
[38:37] you've done what the word said." He
[38:39] said, "Go your way testifying." He said,
[38:40] "I saw." I believe he was the one. He
[38:42] said, "I saw he needed something." He I
[38:44] think he was Catholic. He said he needed
[38:46] something to put his faith to. So he
[38:48] said, "Go and testify." And so for I
[38:52] think it was two two weeks, two months,
[38:54] I can't remember off the top of my head,
[38:55] but it wasn't. Listen, this man had a
[38:58] prophet of God, the prophet of the hour,
[39:01] the seventh age messenger in the
[39:04] presence of of God lay hands on him.
[39:07] And he walked away from the platform
[39:09] still blind,
[39:12] not just for a couple hours, not just
[39:14] for a day,
[39:15] but for a couple weeks, a couple months,
[39:17] whatever it was. And so he's testifying
[39:20] and then his eyes opened up.
[39:22] He stayed and he testified, "God's my
[39:24] healer. Praise God. My eyes are open."
[39:27] So he took that word and he kept it
[39:29] before him. There was two women come
[39:30] through the prayer line. They got prayed
[39:33] for. Left the platform. Same thing.
[39:36] Presence of God, prophet of the hour,
[39:39] laying hands on, touching them, laying
[39:41] hands on them. Angel of the Lord right
[39:43] there. They leave two weeks later
[39:46] washing her dishes. thinking back on the
[39:49] things of the meeting and I think it was
[39:51] the the the gorder and or it was a
[39:54] stomach trouble and all of a sudden she
[39:56] got hungry and she just started tearing
[39:59] the food up. Just something came over
[40:01] her and then she she heard some a scream
[40:03] and she thought, "Oh, that one had
[40:05] cancer." And she thought, "Oh, she
[40:07] died." And she went over to see what it
[40:08] was. That woman got her healing at the
[40:10] same time weeks later from the meeting.
[40:14] So you see, you can't come up to the
[40:16] front and be prayed for thinking, you
[40:18] know, just just get it out of our minds
[40:20] when
[40:21] and just believe that God will,
[40:23] that he's a rewarder of them that
[40:25] diligently seek him.
[40:28] So the seed will produce itself. The
[40:30] word, the seed, it will grow. What it
[40:32] needs to grow is within itself. We don't
[40:34] have to work up to produce it. In fact,
[40:37] the more we relax and trust, the freer
[40:40] it is to manifest. The seed is Christ in
[40:44] you.
[40:44] Yes.
[40:44] So you say, "But but how how do I know
[40:47] if I pray for a person or if I get
[40:49] prayed for that it'll work?" It's not
[40:51] your job to bring God's word to pass.
[40:53] It's his promise.
[40:55] He's responsible for it.
[40:57] Pray and then leave it there.
[41:00] So I I didn't put this up so you don't
[41:02] have to put a quote up, but I just I
[41:03] just thought this was this was so good.
[41:06] No matter how hard it comes, what it
[41:08] looks like, what anybody says, I want I
[41:10] want to with patience, not fretting.
[41:13] Person can't have patience and fretting
[41:15] all at the same time.
[41:17] You just got to set your sails right
[41:19] straight there and walk right on.
[41:22] No matter what takes place, move right
[41:24] on. Look, faith is unconscious. Amen.
[41:26] You believe it? I've learned that in the
[41:28] years of traveling around the world and
[41:30] and meeting the peoples of all different
[41:31] walks. Faith is unconscious. You got
[41:34] faith and you don't even know it. That's
[41:36] right. Skipping down, he was speaking of
[41:39] Jesus. He was simply unconscious of fear
[41:42] or anything around him. That's right.
[41:43] Whether it was going to happen or
[41:45] whether it wasn't going to happen. He
[41:47] knowed it was going to happen because
[41:48] God said so. How do you know it's going
[41:51] to happen? Because God said so. He
[41:53] didn't say, "Oh, have I prayed through?"
[41:56] Now listen now. Just just let yourself
[41:59] relax.
[42:00] He didn't say, "Have I prayed through?
[42:02] Wonder if I fasted long enough. Wonder
[42:04] if I did this. He just walked right on
[42:06] unconscious. That's right. He believed
[42:09] what God said was truth. The words must
[42:12] be fulfilled. And he knowed what his
[42:14] life was to fulfill them. That's right.
[42:16] Walk unconscious of criticism. Walk
[42:18] unconscious under the world.
[42:20] Walk as you walk in Christ. Walk with
[42:22] him.
[42:24] Not paying any attention. The right hand
[42:26] or the left. Just keep moving on. If
[42:28] something comes up in the church,
[42:30] walk with God. Hallelujah. If sickness
[42:32] strikes you, walk with God. If the
[42:35] neighbors don't like you, walk with God.
[42:37] Just keep on walking with God.
[42:40] Walk with God. Doctor says you're going
[42:42] to die, walk with God. Yeah, doctor says
[42:45] you can't. Well, walk with God. Just
[42:47] walk with God. That's all. For God has
[42:49] promised you, I'll never leave you or
[42:52] forsake you. I'll be with you to the end
[42:54] of the world. And he took an oath by the
[42:56] covenant that he gave you that he would
[42:58] confirm it. Just walk with God then.
[43:01] So you know what what what is faith? We
[43:04] all strive for faith and and faith is
[43:06] faith is a gift. The scripture says it
[43:08] says every man was given a measure of
[43:11] faith. So you have faith within you
[43:13] regardless of what you feel about
[43:15] yourself. God has deposited a measure of
[43:18] faith within you. That faith is like a
[43:20] seed and that seed will grow. God
[43:23] anoints it and it grows. You don't do
[43:25] anything. A tree doesn't do anything.
[43:28] It just stands. It relaxes. It just God
[43:31] provides the wind and things to make the
[43:32] roots stronger to and and the nutrients
[43:35] that it'll grow. The tree doesn't do
[43:37] anything within itself. But but faith is
[43:40] is is just it's more common than you
[43:43] might think because because in the
[43:46] scripture the the weed hissup was was a
[43:50] common weed. You could walk out and find
[43:53] it anywhere. Walk out and out here and
[43:55] you know what what weed do I well just
[43:57] go pick a weed. That was what hissup
[43:59] was. And faith is a type of hissup. So
[44:01] when they needed to apply the blood,
[44:03] they used hissup,
[44:05] a common everyday weed. Nothing special
[44:08] about it. They could just walk out and
[44:10] grab it.
[44:11] And that's what we have available to us.
[44:13] You have faith within you. So we get
[44:16] worked up and we think, well, boy is my
[44:18] faith in God. I just did. And and just
[44:20] just God, just anoint my faith.
[44:23] You're the author and finisher of my
[44:24] faith. You gave me the faith. And if
[44:27] you're the author and finisher, then you
[44:29] have to do this. I can't do it within
[44:30] myself.
[44:32] But the blood was applied with that
[44:34] common faith. It's it's common. You
[44:37] don't have to look for it. It's
[44:38] unconscious. So
[44:41] you have faith already within you.
[44:44] Now you just speak the word. And when
[44:46] when I'm when in my mind what I'm
[44:48] thinking just speak the word. I'm not
[44:50] saying that you have to come up with
[44:52] thus sayaith the Lord. We we we've been
[44:55] taught that very well here. You have to
[44:56] be be very sure. If you thus sayeth the
[44:59] Lord comes out of your mouth, you better
[45:01] be sure about it.
[45:03] This isn't that this is this is I mean
[45:07] speak your faith.
[45:09] Speak the word.
[45:10] Speak what we know is true. Speak
[45:12] positive. It's your confession.
[45:16] I don't know what God will do or how
[45:18] he'll do it, but his word says
[45:20] whatever it is. And that's what I'm
[45:23] holding to.
[45:24] Sister Sharon, if you don't mind me
[45:26] using you again. You know, I don't know
[45:29] what God will do. I don't know how God's
[45:32] going to do this. I'm going to do
[45:33] everything that I know that's put in
[45:35] front of me. All everything in my power
[45:37] is Is that okay? And but I'm going to
[45:40] believe God.
[45:42] God's the one that has to do this.
[45:44] And so I just put myself into his hands.
[45:48] Faith is available to us. You have
[45:50] faith. You just need it to he that is in
[45:52] you.
[45:54] The word never gave a certain time frame
[45:57] for deliverance.
[45:58] The word, listen now, the word has been
[46:00] misinterpreted to believe something has
[46:02] to happen right away. Brother Brandham
[46:05] said somewhere, he said it's the wrong
[46:07] interpretation.
[46:08] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[46:10] they shall recover. When you're sick,
[46:12] call for the elders to anoint you with
[46:14] oil and the prayer of faith shall save
[46:17] the sick.
[46:18] It shall. It doesn't say when. It says
[46:21] it shall.
[46:22] Now, go ahead with that next quote.
[46:27] Now, this this is again, this is just
[46:29] stuff that's been burning. I just love
[46:30] this. Now, the next witness is Mr.
[46:32] Impatient. I just love how he's a
[46:34] rascal.
[46:37] He's a rascal. Now, you say, "But
[46:38] brother, I bet it's so impatient. Am I
[46:40] He's You got to go listen to the message
[46:42] because he's not talking about you. He's
[46:44] talking about Mr. Impatient. He's a
[46:46] rascal." Remember, no longer how no
[46:48] matter how much it lingers, this is
[46:51] where I get my term lingers from. No
[46:53] matter how much it lingers, yet it's got
[46:55] to happen. It's going to happen. These
[46:58] witnesses testify, has absolutely
[47:00] testified the truth that it is. So, God
[47:02] said they shall lay hands on the sick,
[47:04] they shall recover. But the outside
[47:06] world wants you to believe as soon as
[47:08] you lay hands on that you must that the
[47:10] crippled legs must be straight, that you
[47:13] must jump up and down. He never said
[47:15] that. He never promised that. He said
[47:18] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[47:20] and God will raise them up. He never
[47:22] said when they they they lay hands on
[47:25] the sick, they shall recover. He never
[47:26] said when. He said when you pray,
[47:29] believe that you receive it and it shall
[47:31] be given unto you.
[47:33] But he didn't say when.
[47:35] Now if if we are real genuine believers,
[47:38] when these scriptures are ministered to
[47:40] us, there is nothing can tell us any
[47:42] different. Right.
[47:44] There is nothing can say that it's
[47:46] wrong. How many could raise up how many
[47:49] infidels? How many unbelievers? How many
[47:51] could explain this that the other? God
[47:53] keeps his word in Mark 16 is just as
[47:56] inspired as John 3:16.
[47:58] The whole thing is the word of God.
[48:00] Every word of it is inspired.
[48:03] All of it is God. If you just read it
[48:05] the way it says,
[48:09] sometimes he lingers, as he did in the
[48:12] days of Noah, he did in the days of
[48:14] Moses, he did in all the days. But he
[48:16] never told the Pentecostal people, go up
[48:18] into the city of Jerusalem in 24 hours,
[48:20] I'll give you the Holy Ghost. He said,
[48:22] Terry there until you're endued with
[48:24] power from on high. He never said one
[48:26] day, 2 days, 10 days. He said, stay
[48:28] until you're endued with power. Lord,
[48:30] they stayed until the evidence spoke
[48:32] back through them that it was the Holy
[48:34] Ghost of God.
[48:36] Now, now may these people who has their
[48:38] hands upon one another who stands this
[48:40] this court this afternoon in the
[48:42] presence of God in the presence of his
[48:43] word as I read it and we testify to this
[48:46] that we believe that he keeps his word
[48:48] and may each one be healed in the name
[48:51] of Jesus Christ.
[48:52] Amen.
[48:57] Go to the throne.
[48:59] go to the throne of God and leave the
[49:01] timing to him. That's right.
[49:04] Your job is just to keep the word before
[49:06] you.
[49:06] That's right.
[49:07] Your job's just to keep looking to the
[49:09] author and finisher of your faith.
[49:10] That's all you have to do. You don't
[49:12] have to make it come to pass.
[49:15] You don't have to do that. You know,
[49:16] jump, you know, we we get we get in
[49:20] inspired as as ministers. We feel your
[49:23] need. And so, you know, we can I'm I'm
[49:26] not going to knock it. You know, I'm not
[49:27] trying to knock it, but we don't have
[49:29] to. When you come up, if if Brother Paul
[49:32] or whoever is ministering, we don't if
[49:34] we don't jump and shout and smack you on
[49:36] the back and and yell in your face and
[49:38] yell at the devil, it it that has
[49:40] nothing to do with it. That's right.
[49:43] Jesus just simply when when the the the
[49:45] the man um uh man of Gadira, the maniac
[49:49] came
[49:50] and and he Jesus didn't say, you know,
[49:53] yell go. He just simply said go. and and
[49:58] what was a thousand a thousand devils
[49:59] gone out of the man just a simple pe you
[50:02] know to the wind peace be still
[50:06] now if we get enthused and we jump and
[50:08] shout praise God
[50:10] but that's not required
[50:12] it's it's it has nothing to do with w
[50:14] with your faith
[50:16] so if you don't if you don't leave here
[50:18] jumping and shouting that's okay
[50:21] leave quietly in the word of God however
[50:23] it comes to you that's okay
[50:26] and If you jump and shout, we'll
[50:27] rejoice, too.
[50:34] Uh, let's see. What do I do here?
[50:40] No. Do I have one that says let's let's
[50:42] say praise the Lord in there? No. Okay,
[50:47] you can take that off for a minute. Let
[50:49] us say praise the Lord. Now, I'm going
[50:52] to bring something to you.
[50:55] Are you with me still?
[50:58] Let's say praise the Lord. Listen to
[51:00] these words. Strong words. There's the
[51:04] cursedness of passing through prayer
[51:06] line after prayer line. When you once
[51:09] accept your healing, don't you never go
[51:11] through another prayer line.
[51:12] Oh my.
[51:13] You let that settle it forever. See,
[51:15] every time you come back, it makes it
[51:18] that much harder. That much harder. That
[51:20] much harder. See? And it breaks it.
[51:23] Amen.
[51:24] The cursedness, that's a strong word,
[51:27] the cursedness of going through prayer
[51:29] line after prayer line. I'm going to
[51:32] take this a little bit further. I
[51:33] believe in prayer lines. I'm not saying
[51:35] we'll never have another prayer line. I
[51:37] I I preached this out one time and then
[51:39] I was I was standing in here in a prayer
[51:42] line praying came through myself.
[51:46] But so if we don't come out running out
[51:48] the other end, it doesn't mean you don't
[51:49] have faith or you didn't get it.
[51:51] We have prayer lines. We believe in
[51:53] them. But
[51:54] and and I'm going to say this I say this
[51:56] with all due reverence, friends. It's
[51:58] it's a bit of a tradition.
[52:00] Yes.
[52:01] And and and it comes from a Jewish
[52:03] tradition of laying on hands,
[52:05] right?
[52:06] But that's not the way it was supposed
[52:08] to be for Gentiles, and we're Gentiles.
[52:11] If you want to see miracles, first
[52:13] accept his word and act upon it.
[52:16] You might get well, but then if you get
[52:19] sick again, it doesn't mean you lost
[52:20] your healing. You're in a body that's
[52:23] under the curse of sin. And so we'll get
[52:25] sick again in these bodies. And
[52:27] sometimes it just lately it just feels
[52:29] like we're sickness after sickness after
[52:31] sickness.
[52:33] But we we we as ministers, we love to
[52:35] pray with you and we put our faith
[52:36] together and we agree upon touching
[52:39] anything.
[52:40] But to think we have to wait until the
[52:42] next service or to think that you have
[52:45] your favorite minister preaching over at
[52:47] a camp meeting.
[52:48] Come on now. that you got to wait until
[52:50] you get there.
[52:52] I'm going to take this further. You
[52:53] think you have to wait until the end of
[52:55] a service to come up and get laid hands
[52:57] on you. You can receive it in your seat
[53:00] and that's the way it's supposed to
[53:01] happen.
[53:03] You don't need a preacher to lay hands
[53:05] on you or someone to jump and shout over
[53:07] you. We're taught it's actually so but
[53:09] it's it's the Gentiles is just to take
[53:11] him at his word. So while the word is
[53:14] coming forth, if your faith, if you if
[53:16] God will anoint your faith, if you feel
[53:18] it, if you if you even if you don't feel
[53:20] it, but you just feel God, I I just
[53:22] believe this with all my heart, then you
[53:24] you stand on it right there.
[53:27] Yes, sir.
[53:28] It's greater faith to hold steady when
[53:31] you're healing or when your answer
[53:33] lingers. Take take it beyond healing. I
[53:35] know I'm I'm on healing a lot and I
[53:36] wanted to be broader than that, but just
[53:38] whatever you're praying about, your
[53:40] finances, your answers, what whatever it
[53:43] is that you're seeking God about, if it
[53:45] lingers, it's it's a greater faith
[53:48] to hold on to the word of God.
[53:51] We love it when we get our answers right
[53:53] away, but it's it's it's there's there's
[53:55] faith when you get it right away, and
[53:57] there's faith when it lingers, and you
[53:58] got to believe through it. God wants us
[54:00] to take him at his word when it's first
[54:02] spoken. Find the word over your
[54:04] situation and pray the promise over it.
[54:07] Keep it before you. It's what God says,
[54:10] not what man says. Even if we receive a
[54:13] word of prophecy, if you come up I and
[54:16] and you know, I got to be honest. I'm
[54:18] I'm guilty of a couple times I can think
[54:20] of, man, I just feel so I feel so
[54:22] inspired for you. Can I can I pray for
[54:25] you? I believe this is happening for
[54:27] you. And and you know, and then it
[54:30] didn't happen that way. And so, you
[54:32] know, I I've apologized, but if if I,
[54:34] you know, haven't, then I publicly do it
[54:36] now. But but, you know, even even just
[54:38] under that uncction, under that that
[54:40] that, you know, us ministers,
[54:44] I don't want to be a preacher. I want to
[54:46] be a minister.
[54:47] And and we feel when when you minister
[54:50] to the people, you feel the need. You
[54:52] you enter into that. And I can't
[54:54] describe it unless you've been there,
[54:55] but you just you feel the need for them.
[54:57] And so, you you feel the enthusiasm. you
[55:00] feel, God, I just I want this so bad
[55:02] that if we're not careful in those
[55:04] moments, we can speak something that's
[55:06] wrong.
[55:07] Is that okay?
[55:09] But even whatever's spoken to you, you
[55:12] have to take it back to the word
[55:14] because what if what if let's just play
[55:16] a scenario. What if that man falls?
[55:20] What what what happens to the word he
[55:22] gave you? You're going to be shook. But
[55:25] the word of God can never fail. So if
[55:27] you can find it in the word and you can
[55:29] hold on to that, latch on to that,
[55:31] then that endures. Heavens and earth
[55:32] will pass away, but my word will never
[55:34] pass away.
[55:37] So he says, now you're getting down to
[55:39] where you have faith. Be expecting it.
[55:42] What God said he would do, God will do.
[55:44] He can't lie.
[55:49] So we're to run with patience. We're to
[55:51] run with endurance.
[55:53] Patiently waiting for the fulfillment of
[55:55] prophecy. Brother Brandham says, "Faith
[55:57] waits with patience for the promised
[55:59] word to be fulfilled."
[56:01] And then, you know, we we we wonder, do
[56:03] we have faith? But, you know, patience
[56:05] is built after faith. It says after
[56:08] you've received the promise, after
[56:09] you've believed on the word of God, then
[56:11] you receive the promise. So, there's
[56:13] there's there's the building blocks. And
[56:15] I just want you to see because I think
[56:16] too many times we we just we get into
[56:19] that mindset of where's my faith? And
[56:21] and and God forbid we tell somebody,
[56:23] "Well, it's cuz you don't have faith. I
[56:25] just I just can't go there.
[56:31] They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[56:33] their strength. You say, "How can I any
[56:34] longer?" Just keep on waiting. When
[56:36] you've done all you can do to stand,
[56:38] then stand. See, just stand. How am I
[56:41] going to do it? Stand. He said it's the
[56:43] truth and it's the truth. He said it'll
[56:45] happen. How? I don't know, but it'll
[56:47] happen. He said so. He promised it. If
[56:49] he promised it, it's going to happen.
[56:51] That's all. It can't waste.
[56:54] Go ahead and pull up the the slides
[56:56] again. I'm I'm I'm coming in for a
[56:59] landing here.
[57:03] You have heard of the patience of Job,
[57:05] says the Apostle James. You may you you
[57:07] may not have to sit among the ashes as
[57:09] he did, or to endure such trials as fell
[57:12] upon him. But between here and heaven,
[57:14] you may expect to have losses and
[57:16] crosses and bereiements and harsh words
[57:19] from those who ought to be your
[57:20] comforters. Oh beloved, may you have at
[57:24] such times the patience of the
[57:26] scriptures and be able to say with Job,
[57:29] the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken
[57:30] away, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[57:33] Job is one of the earthly patterns of
[57:35] patience, though he was not perfect in
[57:37] it. May our patience at least come to
[57:39] his standard.
[57:42] If you want to kill impatience, who
[57:44] wants to kill impatience?
[57:47] Turn to the word of God. Look out an
[57:49] appropriate text. asked to have it
[57:51] applied to your heart by the Holy Spirit
[57:53] and see whether the grace of patience is
[57:55] not thus implanted within you. Have you
[57:57] become weary and welloing? Then stay
[57:59] yourself upon a precious promise and
[58:01] your weariness will speedily depart. Do
[58:04] you seem as if you could not bear the
[58:06] continued opposition of ungodly men?
[58:09] turn you to the promises of your
[58:10] gracious Lord and Master, and you shall
[58:12] learn to rejoice and be exceeding glad,
[58:15] even when they persecute you, and say
[58:16] all manner of evil against you, you
[58:18] falsely for his name's sake.
[58:23] Where where else do we have patience? We
[58:25] we need patience with one another.
[58:27] Brother Benham said, "Wait on one
[58:29] another. Be servants to one another.
[58:31] Don't be bigger than somebody else. Try
[58:33] to see how little you can be."
[58:35] Spurgeon again, we quickly make excuses
[58:37] for our own infirmities, and it
[58:39] therefore behooves us to endure the
[58:41] infirmities of others, to put a kind
[58:43] construction on what might have been
[58:45] harshly condemned, to bear with the
[58:47] misconceptions of our conduct made by
[58:49] others and their mistake or even
[58:51] misrepresentations made in their anger,
[58:54] to be gentle and tender as a nurse with
[58:56] a child. Never to be hard and harsh and
[58:59] severe. For this is contrary to the
[59:01] second table of the law, which can be
[59:03] summed up in the brief expression, love
[59:05] to men. Oh, I would to God that we had
[59:07] more of this spirit in all our churches.
[59:10] Our Savior said to his disciples, "A new
[59:12] commandment I give unto you, that ye
[59:14] love one another as I have loved you,
[59:16] that ye also love one another."
[59:21] But how often is that new commandment
[59:23] forgotten in the impatient way in which
[59:25] we show out petulence towards weak and
[59:27] perhaps provoking saints? God grant that
[59:30] in the future we may have more patience
[59:33] in this respect. Amen.
[59:45] musicians, if you want to come, I'll
[59:46] just read a couple things and finish
[59:48] this up.
[59:54] And I just want to say, I think we did
[59:56] this in about 45 minutes. So,
[1:00:02] Hebrews Hebrews 12:1,
[1:00:06] it's that that thought of laying aside
[1:00:07] every weight. And one of the things that
[1:00:10] that um Spurgeon said I just thought was
[1:00:13] real good is he said you know he said um
[1:00:20] he said our our our original sin our
[1:00:22] natural tendencies our constitutional
[1:00:24] infirmities these must be laid aside as
[1:00:27] garments unsuitable for men who are
[1:00:29] running for the heavenly race. We cannot
[1:00:31] win heaven and wear sin. And then he
[1:00:33] calls them darling sins must go first.
[1:00:36] Then a little bit further down, he says,
[1:00:37] 'd do I do I not do I not hear you say,
[1:00:39] ' May God help us. This must be a tough
[1:00:42] race which requires such stripping as
[1:00:44] this. If every weight of care must be
[1:00:47] laid aside and every rage of sin, who is
[1:00:50] sufficient for these things? Now, not
[1:00:53] just not just sin, but I just just that
[1:00:55] whole thing of of the weight of care.
[1:00:58] And I thought of what brother Paul's
[1:01:00] been speaking on on Wednesdays is he
[1:01:02] cares. Do you care?
[1:01:05] every rag of sin who is sufficient for
[1:01:07] these things. How can we poor limping
[1:01:09] mortals run in such a race as this? Even
[1:01:11] the starting as is beyond us. How much
[1:01:15] more must perseverance in it outreach
[1:01:18] our strength? See, my brethren, how we
[1:01:20] are driven to free grace, how we are
[1:01:23] driven to the power of the Holy Spirit,
[1:01:25] the race which is set before us most
[1:01:27] clearly reveals our helplessness and our
[1:01:30] hopelessness apart from divine grace.
[1:01:33] The race of our holiness and patience,
[1:01:35] while it demands our vigor, displays our
[1:01:37] weakness. We are compelled, even before
[1:01:40] we take step in the running, to bow the
[1:01:43] knee and cry unto the strong for
[1:01:45] strength. We dare not retreat from the
[1:01:48] contest, but how can we begin a struggle
[1:01:50] for which we are so unfitted? Who will
[1:01:53] help us? To whom shall we look? Does not
[1:01:56] all this very admirably introduce the
[1:01:58] verse which is specifically my text
[1:02:01] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:02:03] finisher of our faith. Looking unto
[1:02:05] Jesus because the way itself and the
[1:02:08] rules of the running are such as our
[1:02:09] nature will fight against. Therefore
[1:02:12] look the more earnestly to the great
[1:02:14] captain of your salvation.
[1:02:17] If you want to stand to your feet, how
[1:02:18] do we lay aside the weights? Casting all
[1:02:21] our care upon him because he cares for
[1:02:24] us. So when you feel you can't do it,
[1:02:26] when you feel like, "Where's my answer?"
[1:02:29] Cast your cares upon him for he cares
[1:02:32] for you.
[1:02:33] Lord,
[1:02:34] God won't put any more on you than you
[1:02:36] can handle. We often say there's trials
[1:02:39] too heavy, so there must be more in us
[1:02:41] that God knows is there than what we
[1:02:43] think there is.
[1:02:45] Psalms 103 says, "He knows our frame and
[1:02:49] remembers we're made of dust.
[1:02:51] He won't put more on you than you can
[1:02:53] handle."
[1:02:55] Amen.
[1:03:00] I have no song in mind. So, whichever
[1:03:03] one of you would like to come, if they
[1:03:05] just want to play something softly,
[1:03:06] we'll we'll just ask the Lord for prayer
[1:03:09] here. Bow our hearts. Heavenly Father,
[1:03:13] Lord, we lift our hands just now, Lord.
[1:03:16] Many of us going through heavy things,
[1:03:19] questions that we don't have answers to,
[1:03:23] maybe sickness that's been ongoing for
[1:03:26] for maybe months, maybe years. And Lord,
[1:03:30] we grow weary. We look for strength.
[1:03:33] Where do we look for strength? We lift
[1:03:35] up our head. We lift up our eyes to the
[1:03:38] hills from whence our help comes from.
[1:03:41] We look for you, Lord, the maker of the
[1:03:43] heavens and the earth.
[1:03:45] And Lord, we pray in our feebleness and
[1:03:47] our weakness.
[1:03:49] We pray for your strength to endure the
[1:03:51] trials that you so perfectly set before
[1:03:54] us.
[1:03:56] Predestinated trials were taught.
[1:04:00] I pray, Lord, I pray for strength for
[1:04:02] your people.
[1:04:04] I pray for endurance that you would fill
[1:04:06] them tonight with patience with
[1:04:09] endurance with to endure the cross that
[1:04:12] they're bearing.
[1:04:14] Lord, let something have been said to
[1:04:16] encourage them to encourage them to look
[1:04:19] into your word. Lord, when I heard the
[1:04:21] prophet say that he he's looking for the
[1:04:24] time when when the whole congregation is
[1:04:27] healed simultaneously, we know those
[1:04:29] things are possible. But but I believe
[1:04:32] that even greater looking deeper than
[1:04:34] just the miracle that it was is is the
[1:04:37] people's faith reaching out to the word
[1:04:40] of God. And so I pray tonight that above
[1:04:43] everything else that you would help us
[1:04:45] to look to your word, to look to the
[1:04:48] message that we've been given, the word
[1:04:50] of this hour.
[1:04:52] And and I just pray that it would just
[1:04:54] you just anoint our faith. Anoint what
[1:04:56] our faith needs. Help us to keep our
[1:04:59] eyes focused on you, your word.
[1:05:03] Lord, it's just the best way I can pray
[1:05:05] it. You know my heart and I pray these
[1:05:07] things in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:05:11] Amen.
[1:05:12] Amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:05:15] Is perfect.
[1:05:18] His strength is perfect. His strength is
[1:05:21] perfect.
[1:05:23] when our strength is gone.
[1:05:28] Yes, Lord. He'll carry us
[1:05:33] when we can't
[1:05:35] carry on.
[1:05:40] Raised in his power,
[1:05:44] the weak
[1:05:46] become
[1:05:47] strong.
[1:05:50] His strength is perfect.
[1:05:56] His strength is perfect.
[1:06:00] I can do all things. Oh, I can do all
[1:06:05] things. Yes, Lord. Through Christ who
[1:06:09] gives me strength.
[1:06:13] But sometimes I wonder what he can do
[1:06:18] through me.
[1:06:23] No great success to show,
[1:06:28] no glory of my own.
[1:06:33] Yet in my weakness, he is there to let
[1:06:38] me know.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah. That his strength is
[1:06:44] perfect.
[1:06:46] when our strength is. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:06:52] he'll carry us
[1:06:56] when we can't
[1:06:58] carry on.
[1:07:03] Raised in his power
[1:07:06] though we become
[1:07:10] strong.
[1:07:13] His strength is perfect.
[1:07:17] We take it up. But his strength is
[1:07:20] perfect.
[1:07:23] Oh, and we can only know
[1:07:29] the power that he holds
[1:07:34] when we truly see how deep our weakness
[1:07:39] goes.
[1:07:41] Yes, Lord.
[1:07:43] Oh, his strength in us begins.
[1:07:48] Hallelujah. When ours comes to an end
[1:07:53] and he hears our humble cry and proves
[1:07:59] again that his strength and his strength
[1:08:04] is perfect
[1:08:06] when our strength is gone. Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] Oh, he carry us
[1:08:15] when we can't
[1:08:18] carry on.
[1:08:22] Raised in his power
[1:08:26] though we become
[1:08:29] strong.
[1:08:32] His strength is perfect.
[1:08:37] His strength is perfect.
[1:08:40] last time. Oh, his strength is perfect
[1:08:46] when our strength is gone
[1:08:52] and he'll carry us
[1:08:55] when we can't carry on.
[1:09:01] Raise his power.
[1:09:05] The weak become strong
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:13] is perfect.
[1:09:16] His strength is perfect.
[1:09:21] Oh, I pray the strength and his faith
[1:09:24] that he's planted within me would be
[1:09:26] anointed that I could hold to the word
[1:09:28] of God and let him do it in his time.
[1:09:31] And I'm so grateful tonight. How many
[1:09:32] are grateful for this word tonight? just
[1:09:34] lodged in our hearts. It's it's uh such
[1:09:37] a wonderful message tonight. And I I had
[1:09:39] to get up and say something. Although
[1:09:40] you can't add to what was said, I I just
[1:09:43] been feeling this so much. And when I
[1:09:44] was in Washington, spoke at brother John
[1:09:46] Andy's church on our little subject
[1:09:49] there. Lord, teach us to pray. And I
[1:09:52] thought that it's, you know, when we
[1:09:54] have settings like this tonight, I just
[1:09:56] feel like it's his disciples sitting at
[1:10:00] Jesus feet when they sat and said,
[1:10:02] "Lord, teach us to pray."
[1:10:05] It and to come to adoption, sons must be
[1:10:09] teachable.
[1:10:11] You can't come to adoption without a
[1:10:13] teachable son.
[1:10:15] You can't come to adoption without
[1:10:16] correction. That's right.
[1:10:18] And I just every one of these we have a
[1:10:20] service like this, you know, and what
[1:10:23] what the bride is coming into is so much
[1:10:25] deeper and so much even greater. And he
[1:10:28] said about the third pole, you can't
[1:10:29] teach Pentecostal babies supernatural
[1:10:32] things. Our brother mentioned the word
[1:10:34] enthusiasm several times tonight and the
[1:10:36] difference in that. Enthusiasm
[1:10:39] kind of typing back with the wine which
[1:10:41] in the scripture is stimulation.
[1:10:44] Enthusiasm and the wine can be deceiving
[1:10:48] because people will jump quickly to the
[1:10:50] wine and the enthusiasm,
[1:10:53] but it's the oil and the wine
[1:10:55] and the oil comes through the word. Can
[1:10:57] you say amen? And so we must be careful.
[1:10:59] I was actually if I preached tonight, I
[1:11:01] was going to preach on choosing I I
[1:11:03] believe I was going to preach on it
[1:11:04] sometime, choosing enthusiasm over
[1:11:07] substance because that's what I've been
[1:11:08] thinking about this weekend is how many
[1:11:10] times people will choose enthusiasm over
[1:11:12] substance. And brother Bram says, "Even
[1:11:14] when I go to say thus sayith the Lord,"
[1:11:16] he says, "I have to be careful." He
[1:11:17] says, "I can't say thus sayaith my
[1:11:19] enthusiasm." And enthusiasm can really
[1:11:23] on the outside seem really good and feel
[1:11:26] good and you can say a lot of things,
[1:11:28] but we want something deeper than just
[1:11:30] enthusiasm. And then when that word
[1:11:32] strikes your heart and and and remember,
[1:11:34] sons are getting the patience and the
[1:11:37] character out of their trials. They're
[1:11:39] not jumping and saying, "I'm skipping
[1:11:41] that part." No, no. God's doing
[1:11:43] something that we get the patience we
[1:11:45] need out of our trials. We learn how to
[1:11:47] stand upon the word when we see no
[1:11:49] answer.
[1:11:50] And he's teaching sons that. It's so
[1:11:52] powerful because he's molding more than
[1:11:54] just a people with miracles and signs
[1:11:56] and wonders. He's molding a people with
[1:11:58] character. Can you say amen? And sons
[1:12:00] that are teachable and correctable. Uh I
[1:12:03] think that we need to not choose
[1:12:04] enthusiasm over substance. I think we
[1:12:06] ought to have the substance of the word,
[1:12:09] the oil and the wine. Yes.
[1:12:11] And I listen if we if you get some
[1:12:15] stimulation and revelation. But see, it
[1:12:17] comes from what God is anointing your
[1:12:19] faith to do.
[1:12:20] But if you get some a pastor's not going
[1:12:22] to be scared of any shouting and dancing
[1:12:24] and worshiping God. It comes when
[1:12:27] there's a true re revelation. You may
[1:12:28] not jump it. You may cry. You're moved
[1:12:30] by the spirit of God. But we should
[1:12:32] never jump to that and have conventions
[1:12:34] and even meetings where we're jumping
[1:12:36] because that enthusiasm feels so good
[1:12:39] and no substance.
[1:12:41] Faith is the substance
[1:12:45] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[1:12:47] things not seen. How many raise your
[1:12:48] hand? I'm a son of God. Wants the
[1:12:50] substance of what the word has. I want
[1:12:52] substance to my life. And then whatever
[1:12:55] God moves me to rejoice, I am going to
[1:12:58] rejoice. I'm going to shout. And I've
[1:13:00] been thinking that. Let's go tonight
[1:13:01] singing they that wait upon the Lord
[1:13:04] shall renew their strength.
[1:13:07] There's a there's a what's you titled
[1:13:08] this brother Brandon this series you did
[1:13:11] is the God in the waiting. God of the
[1:13:13] waiting. Finding God in the waiting.
[1:13:16] Don't skip that part.
[1:13:18] You find many attributes of God while
[1:13:21] you're waiting on the promise to be
[1:13:22] fulfilled. Powerful. How many enjoy the
[1:13:24] word tonight? We're blessed. Can you say
[1:13:26] amen? We're blessed tonight. take this
[1:13:28] home with you as we just ponder this
[1:13:30] song. And I was thinking I was listening
[1:13:33] uh yesterday mowing the grass to uh when
[1:13:35] I got home. I had a million acres to
[1:13:38] mow. When I got home yesterday and
[1:13:40] listened to brother Brandham was
[1:13:42] preaching the present stage of my
[1:13:43] ministry and was so wonderful as he
[1:13:46] finds his place in the scripture in 2
[1:13:48] Timothy chapter 4 and and comes to the
[1:13:50] end of his ministry where he was
[1:13:52] forsaken. Deeus has forsaken me. Paul
[1:13:54] was forsaken. Paul uh Deeus has forsaken
[1:13:56] me. forsook Paul and yet they he thought
[1:13:59] Paul was all washed up and his ministry
[1:14:01] is over. Brother Bram's feeling that
[1:14:02] himself cuz he's getting rejected by
[1:14:04] many of different friends and different
[1:14:06] ones. He's feeling he's living that
[1:14:08] scripture out found his place in the
[1:14:10] scripture and yet he says yeah he says
[1:14:14] that in the middle of that rejection and
[1:14:16] that forsaken time when it looks like
[1:14:18] all was rejecting him it it God was
[1:14:21] coming to the crowning of his ministry.
[1:14:23] the world wouldn't see that Jesus when
[1:14:25] he was at the cross was coming to the
[1:14:27] crowning of his ministry. The ultimate
[1:14:30] thing I wonder if the bride, you know,
[1:14:32] is is coming just to the crowning now.
[1:14:36] Hold steady, the greatest vindication of
[1:14:39] this message to me is still coming. And
[1:14:41] brother Bram says something in that
[1:14:43] message. He says the word has to unfold.
[1:14:45] And I I'm not reading it exact. I'm not
[1:14:47] saying it exactly right, but he got in
[1:14:49] there and he says it has to fold. And
[1:14:50] what he's talking about is that carnal
[1:14:53] eyes will say, "Paul, you're all washed
[1:14:54] up. Brother Brandon, your ministry is
[1:14:56] washed up. You don't have the the
[1:14:58] following you used to have." And and
[1:15:00] then he tells us in our lives that you
[1:15:02] must be all washed up. And in that time
[1:15:03] when we're waiting, when we're trusting
[1:15:05] God, when we're holding to the word,
[1:15:08] forsaken by many people, people saying
[1:15:10] things about us, we have to know as sons
[1:15:13] that this is a word that unfolds. And
[1:15:16] that means it doesn't instantly show
[1:15:18] itself. it unfolds.
[1:15:21] I think we should trust God while it's
[1:15:24] unfolding.
[1:15:26] This is a word that unfolds. And he said
[1:15:28] in there this song, he says, "They that
[1:15:30] wait upon the Lord, teach me not to
[1:15:33] rely, teach me as a son of God, teach me
[1:15:35] not to rely on what others do, but to
[1:15:39] wait in prayer for an answer from you."
[1:15:42] How many say, "Teach me, Lord. Teach me
[1:15:45] to wait. Teach me, Lord." Oh, just
[1:15:48] before we dismiss now, sing it. To wake
[1:15:52] down on
[1:15:55] my knees,
[1:15:58] till in your own
[1:16:01] good time,
[1:16:03] you answer. Hallelujah. My king,
[1:16:08] teach me not
[1:16:11] to rely
[1:16:13] on. Don't get your eyes on what others
[1:16:15] are doing, their criticism.
[1:16:17] But to wait in prayer, but to wait.
[1:16:21] Don't get your eyes on others for an
[1:16:25] answer. Hallelujah. From you, oh they
[1:16:30] that wait
[1:16:32] upon the Lord shall renew.
[1:16:38] Their strength.
[1:16:40] They shall bow up
[1:16:43] with wings as
[1:16:46] an eagle.
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:50] They shall run
[1:16:53] and not be weary. They shall walk.
[1:17:01] Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord.
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:09] Heavenly Father, we love your word
[1:17:11] tonight. We love how you've broke it,
[1:17:13] broke this bread to us in such a way we
[1:17:16] can understand it. Lord, we see our
[1:17:19] position. May we be sons that sit and
[1:17:21] say, "Lord, teach me. Teach me to wait.
[1:17:23] Teach me to find the God in the waiting.
[1:17:26] Teach me, Lord, to find the patience
[1:17:28] that I wouldn't get if I'm rushing and
[1:17:30] looking for something quickly. Teach us,
[1:17:32] Lord, as sons, how to hold steady and
[1:17:35] hold to the confession of the word and
[1:17:37] watch that word unfold to us, Lord.
[1:17:40] Teach us, Lord. God, we just give you
[1:17:42] the glory tonight for your word and help
[1:17:44] us, Lord, and along this journey, Lord,
[1:17:46] of holding on to this message with all
[1:17:49] of our hearts and watching it uh unfold
[1:17:52] to us, watching it what it's doing in
[1:17:54] our lives. Lord, let us be patient, I
[1:17:56] pray. And we commit our lives to you and
[1:17:58] our hearts to you tonight as we're
[1:18:00] dismissed and go our separate ways. We
[1:18:02] pray, Father, that your spirit would go
[1:18:04] with us and protects us and watch over
[1:18:06] us, Lord. And we're so thankful tonight
[1:18:09] to be in these atmospheres, Lord. I want
