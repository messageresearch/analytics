========================================

all right here enough amens to say that we're there this is Christ speaking and he's giving Comfort to the disciples as he's um beginning to let them know that he won't be around very much longer and you read the whole chapter and you find it it makes them a little bit nervous and John and John he retells the promises of Christ he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him and he dwelt with you basically saying hey I'm him I am the spirit of truth I am that comforter but he says further shall be in you and I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world sees no me no more but ye shall see me because I live he shall live also and that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you and my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let your heart not be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid and Genesis 4 16. seeing fourth chapter of Genesis is the telling of the two sons of Adam and Eve and the first murder and after Cain slays Abel well just go ahead and pick up what happens after Cain has a conversation with the Lord in verse 14. 4 14 behold thou has driven me out this day from the face the Earth and from thy face shall I behead and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the Lord said to him therefore whoever slayeth came Vengeance shall be taken Sevenfold and the Lord said A Marked upon Cain lestening finding him should kill him and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord may the Lord bless the reading of his word and may be seated thank you brother I sure appreciate that so we see here in the scripture we've got this great culmination that Christ is coming to and he now here at the end of end of the Old Testament he's beginning to wrap it up he's about to seal the New Testament with his blood and right before that ceiling when he's about to leave the Earth and and he's going to leave his disciples have been walking with him for the past three and a half years he begins to give them these words of comfort he says I'm not going to leave you comfortless I'm not going to abandon you matter of fact not only will I not only will I not abandon you but I'm going to be in you I'm going to be dwelling inside of you that that I'm I'm with you right now but I'm going to be in you and in that day you'll know that the father dwells in me and you and me and I and you so there's this he's trying to bring the disciples to this they can't quite understand it yet because the holy spirit is not yet given but he's trying to bring them to what he's trying to bring the whole church to he's like for the last two thousand four thousand years of History we've been trying to get to this singular point where you'll never leave me and I'll never leave you and will always be able to abide to each other with with one another he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you not sometimes not here and there not not on Sunday mornings but that he may abide with you forever what a what a comfort that ought to be to our hearts this morning that God would be abiding with us forever but to catch the full scope of it I just want to maybe take a little bit of a reprise this morning and and go back into church history and pull back where where the church came from before this singular moment in history where the Holy Ghost was given and you see here that Cain went out from the presence of the Lord of course that's just like his father and his mother they they started this whole thing about hiding themselves in the present the Lord by their sin back in the Garden of Eden they hid themselves behind some fig leaves and tried to hide themselves from the presence of the Lord and you can turn me down a little bit in the monitors here this morning but he tried to they tried to hide themselves from the presence of God and that was man's Fellowship being broken man's Fellowship being broken back in the Garden of Eden and then of course Cain comes and he breaks even further instead of instead of rejoicing with his brother Abel that Abel found a way to get back into God's Fellowship that he he found a way to get connection with God through his his sacrifice not of fruits but a sacrifice of blood a blood sacrifice and and it was too messy maybe for Cain and he thought his sacrifice was pretty enough and he said instead of saying my brother how wonderful it is let's let's do this together give me a lamb too that I may be able to have fellowship and a connection back with God that that our parents had lost instead of fellowshipping like that he took a big old stone or a blunt object of some sort we don't know but he killed his brother and he went out from the presence of the Lord and you read the the then the the continual history of Cain and it says that he married it seems like he went on had a fine life he builded his City he named his son enaki named the city Enoch after him and he just began to create his own legacy but it was Legacy completely outside the presence of God meanwhile Seth is born to Adam and Eve and he has a son named Enos and the Bible says that from that time then man began to call upon the name of the Lord and so you have this cane in his race and they're completely satisfied to create a dwelling outside the presence of God they completely turned their back on God and they're going to do all the worldly accomplishments and they're gonna they're gonna marry and given marriage and they're going to have family and they're going to create a legacy and they're going to do it completely outside of God's presence but I'm so happy today that I'm standing before some of the descendants of Seth I'm standing before some of the descendants of you know by Enos by faith that there was not a there was a people that was not happy to live outside the presence of God that there was a people that rose up and said then the the men of the world began to call upon the name of the Lord the story didn't end at Cain but there was a race that came after Seth a people a Heritage a family line that said I want to get back in the presence I don't know how to do it exactly I I know that we we made a big mistake here with with turning our back on God I know that I know that my family tree is broken right now I I know that my family tree is in charge right now but somehow despite the murder despite the infidelity and the adultery and everything else that's in my family tree I want to find a way to get back into God's presence oh I I believe that's why we're here this morning isn't it because there's a people that still wants to find God's presence if it still wants to find God's Fellowship this morning and you might not know all the time how to do it and how to get past your complexes and how to get past your own past let alone the past of your family but you're here this morning because you're saying somewhere in your heart I want to call upon the name of the Lord I want to get back in fellowship with God yes my family tree is rough you may be yes even my own history is rough but I want the fellowship of God oh Hallelujah that's the father and that's the mother that we have in faith as these these Heroes of Faith that have gone down the line and as we follow the story of our fathers and mothers of faith we we pick up that Abel he had that Revelation and then after Abel and after Seth we come along and Seth's great great great great grandson Enoch comes along and he says no no longer did they just call upon the name of the Lord this one found a walk with the Lord and I I wonder how much he must have looked forward to his walking with the Lord how much he must have looked forward to be able to have whatever level of Fellowship he was afforded by God at that time it may have not been the level of Fellowship that Adam and Eve had in the cool of the evening with Christ in the garden but it was some kind of Fellowship somewhat so that the Bible said he walked with the Lord and then he was not because God saw fit to take him oh hallelujah what a beautiful type of the day that we're living in when we come down we read through Genesis and it's a beautiful story of God's people as they try to find a way back into God's Fellowship but it's not just them finding God but God finding his people we look at Noah and Noah was out there and he God had to bring upon an antediluvian destruction but he said he found one righteous and he saved no one as household not that Noah was going out to God and saying save me but God came to him and said I'm going to save you we see the same kind of pattern later on as we pick up the story of Abraham he was just a man caught up in idolatry his his father was a maker of idols and a a Graver a sculpture of graven images and yet God came to him and said here I have a promise for you I have a land for you to walk in I I I have a plan for you and you can't imagine the plan and I'm not going to tell you everything about it right now but I just want you to come over into this land and every place that your footsteps I'm going to give it to you and you can't fathom it because you've never had children but don't don't ask all the questions about why or how or or the mechanics of it but I'm going to give you a Heritage I'm going to give you a people I'm going to give you a name so that you can't even number the the number of your people I wonder what that must have been like for Abraham I wonder if he gets kind of like got kind of like us and said well How's that gonna work right how you know kind of like we do how am I going to get past these complexes maybe you can read a book about it maybe I could go to the public library and check out a self-help book and how am I going to get past this cycle of sin that I'm in I I just I've never been and my father did the same thing before me and I I mean he probably figured I've always been an idol worshiper how could there how can I worship just one God I thought my wife and I we've always been bare and how could we possibly and we find out that that's exactly what he did he he tried to put himself in the picture and try to work the mechanics himself and sometimes I think that's where we get off track is like Abraham he tried to inject himself in there and rather his his wife tried to do it and she said here take this woman over here and then that'll fulfill God's promises and then she of course hated Hagar afterwards and the whole mess that came from that and entire people that that wasn't part of the promise and and they battled the children of Israel all those times and all the mess that we come up with trying to help god with his plans in our life all the mess that we here here God let me help overcome my complexes with you uh hell let me help let me help you know try to break this cycle of sin in my life and we should be proactive but in a way that's yielding Lord you show me the steps you show me what needs to be done here so we see that God had a dedication to people he he he wanted to bring man back into fellowship with him even though a man was really good at breaking off fellowship with God God was really good at bringing man back into Fellowship and you even look at Abraham's life and it didn't seem like Abraham had that many instances where he had a fellowship with the Lord matter of fact I think he'd be jealous of most of us here this morning because you pick up Abraham's story and it seems like for years he'd go without a clear direction from God he's like you know I I you gave me this promise of a son and I didn't know what to do with it and years went by and I didn't hear from you so we just kind of did this over here how wonderful would it have been for him to be able to come to church this morning and to be able to come in underneath the tutelage of God's word he you got to remember Abraham didn't even have the tank Commandments at the time it was just living by the conscience that God placed into his heart and by whatever instruction God gave to him but yet God was calling man into fellowship and so we see that God begins to release more of himself in the world he through Abraham he he creates a a chosen people and to those chosen people he begins to reveal himself through the Ten Commandments and and showing people a picture of of what God wants my wife was asking just yesterday how is it that the law is a tutor and we got into a conversation about how the law is a tutor for people and even today the law that God gave to the children of Israel is a tutor for people it's a school Master to bring them up to repentance up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost up to a relationship with Jesus Christ can you imagine what would have happened if God had never given a distribution of himself through his Chosen People Israel if he had never revealed the Ten Commandments if he had never revealed what he wanted from man it's like it's like if if I come into relationship with you for the first time the first questions I'm going to ask is what's your favorite color what kind of food you like to eat now we're not in full relationship with each other but I have to know a little bit about you before I can have fellowship with you I have to know what your preferences are I have to know what you want that's why this whole world is treating just any kind of Jesus they want it's a completely different kind of Jesus if you respect the personhood of God you're going to try to find out what God wants and you know I'll I'll tell you the first time I found out that my wife liked the color Navy you know what I didn't do I didn't tell her that's the stupidest color I ever saw in my life I didn't you know I that's one thing I didn't do I also didn't say why do you like the color Navy with big scrunch on my face could you tell me the mechanics let's let's go back in your birth history and and your psychosis and what about Navy originally appealed to you and could you just give me all the reasons why you like the colored Navy could you God could you just give me all the reasons why you want a man to wear pants and a woman to wear skirts because that that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me oh my could you just give me all the reasons why you don't want me to cuss and I mean it's just four letter words anyhow could you just give me all the reasons why I can't steal from the rich when they have plenty of money anyhow God could you just you know I think I think I think maybe you're a little bent out of shape here God that's that's not how I treated my wife when I first met her that's not even how I treat my friends let alone The Sovereign ruler of the universe and yet we'll throw questions at God all day long before we even really get to know him so when we read The Ten Commandments it's become so natural to us well of course we shouldn't steal of course we shouldn't lie I'm sure of course we shouldn't commit adultery but it wasn't natural to the people back then well under what conditions I think there's certain conditions under which I can steal these people over here they're they're a totally different family a whole totally different tribe I should steal from them anytime I want to or what about not committed adultery what was adultery back then they had so many wives anyhow not only that but their their Pagan practices it allowed that kind of activity around their worship and Incorporated that into it can you imagine how crazy that was to them but yet it was God's grace saying let me let me show you what my favorite colors are yeah let me show you what I like to eat when I sit down and dine with my people let me show you how to make me happy oh and while I'm at it because this isn't just about me but because I also created you let me show you how you work let me show you how to live let me let me come down and recalibrate your broken hearts instead of just trying to try to figure it all out and ask me why how about you just get to know your author a little bit how about you just accept the grace of my Revelation that I'm getting giving to you the Bible says that Israel became a light to all the world why because Israel was God's Avenue for God revealing himself they were the people through which God called all the Earth come and look at me there's a people that I'm revealing myself to if you want to see the one true God if you want to see your maker come to the people of Israel that's why unlike most other tribes the time God made a way for the Foreigner to come into the encampment of Israel it wasn't just Rahab was a special case there were special laws and Provisions for the Foreigner to be able to come into the camp because God wasn't just revealing himself to God to this special people but this was a special people that was made as an Avenue to reveal the whole world so much so that you can go into the darkest place of Toledo or Los Angeles or New York and and those little kids that may have never been Church before and may have been raised up underneath the drug addict they know in their heart of hearts that it's wrong to steal that it's wrong to commit adultery because why at least the very little at least they'll say that it's illegal but why do you have that it's because of Western laws why do you have Western laws it's because of the influence all the way back through the children of Israel by God's sovereignly revealing by his grace what his preferences were what he desired from his people and how his people perfectly operated that was God calling man back into Fellowship by showing them who he was now that's not the end of it because I didn't get married or even try popping out a ring as soon as I found out what her favorite color was might have liked to but I waited off a little bit longer brother Mike you know at least a few weeks so there's this whole process that God's bringing us through then we follow down God's family tree and the people of Israel we pick up David and it says here here David was a a man after God's Own Heart a man that was so confidence in God's presence that he said where shall I go that I would Escape your presence I could go into the depths of hell and still you would find me I could go I could take wings as the morning and go into in the heavens and still you would be there and yet in the same in just a couple of chapters over he'd he'd say oh God cast not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation see he he still didn't have what God wanted to bring him to he didn't have that abiding presence of God he actually still feared that he could lose the Holy Spirit because why the Holy Ghost was only given as an anointing upon the spirit at that time but it was not given as a personhood to the soul of man to change his nature and seal him unto the end God was still bringing man to that oh my they were still underneath the blood of bulls and goats at that time have you ever thought of how complicated that must have been to live underneath the blood of bulls and goats and how maybe jealous people that wanted to be in the presence of God might have been of that high priest that got to go one time in the holy of holies David said oh I would that I could live all the days of my life in the house the Lord I wonder a man who felt that way if he sometimes felt about the high priest I wish I could be that guy you know we see even examples of Kings uh I can't remember the the name of the king just now but he was he was he was struck with Leprosy because he wanted the office of the priesthood and now I'm standing before people who God has made Kings and Priests has cast out the leprosy of Sin from amongst us imagine how privileged we are friends the scripture says it this way that every priest standeth daily and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices but those sacrifices could never take away the sins but this man Christ Jesus after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of God Christ the Lamb of God came and spread his arms for you and me one time oh can you imagine the power of that sacrifice where thousands and millions of the blood of bulls and goats had stacked up over the years and and all Christ has to do one time is Lay the price down on the on the table and say it's paid it's paid from every man woman and child since the birth of Adam and Eve onward Until the End of the Age every baby that's ever born and never comes to the age of of accountability that baby is mine Ever every man and a woman that would come past the AIDS of accountability and become aware of their sins as long as they repent and claim the name of Jesus Christ they will be saved if they just call upon my name oh Hallelujah now he begins to set up the way of Perpetual fellowship with God not just coming in and offering sacrifice for sins but to have a perpetual and abiding presence of Christ their lives I wonder if if you were back in the time of the Israelites how many times would it be enough for you to come into God's presence imagine for the high priest is one time per year I my family and I just left for 30 days and it was so marvelous being able to come back into this church service this morning but would you be satisfied one time per week would that be enough for you to come into God's presence I want to let that question linger this morning how often do you want to be in God's presence you know sometimes we we feel like we have to work for our Redemption that every time we sin we seem to have to work back make enough propitiation for our sins make enough penance to be able to feel like we're accepted of God but Redemption was a one-time event at Calvary he paid for your PR your sins one time and all you have to do is accept it one time and that closes the case the Bible says that he who the son has freed is free indeed all you have to do is take that blood and apply it over your life one time by the simple hyssop of faith and say God has forgiven me it's a clean slate then of course we we do have sins and we make mistakes and things that distance ourselves from the fellowship of God but John says it this way so beautifully he says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness I the last time we were together I'm still just setting up a foundation for what I want to get to you that were here last time we were fellowshipping about on the fellowship by Grace may have recognized me to repeating myself a lot but just wait for me to get to it if you would this morning but we commented on this scripture that it's amazing that God would bring into this that he's not only faithful to forgive us our sins because that would be faithful to a promise but he also ties his Justice to it if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins now we think of God's justices if he was just he would completely eradicate me from the face of the Earth like when when man becomes so aware of his sins that's what God he's aware that God's justice requires death but the moment that you accept the blood of Jesus Christ you pass over from God's justice requiring death and you pass over his prom the threshold of his promises that say whoever calls upon me shall be saved and once you have that threshold of Promise underneath your feet now he says it's my Justice to give you life because I promised it I paid the price for it already and because I paid the price for it and because I brought myself under obligations to you by my promise it is now my Justice to forgive you of your sin so this morning if you brought a load of sin you can lay it down this morning and you don't have to work for it you don't have to come and pound this altar this morning it doesn't matter what you've done it might be it might be so embarrassing and so black that you would never want to even breathe it in a Congregation of these Saints but if you breathe it before the presence of God and simply say Lord I Repent of that from a true and honest heart he says it's now his Justice to forgive you of it do you know what Justice Means it doesn't mean that God is just doing you a favor now it means even if someone came up and brought up all the dirt against you let's say I'm seeing this political season it seems like people are really good at bringing up dirt about their opponents and they they dig way back into coffers and the skeleton is in the family Clauses they bring up all this dirt and they try to get people to to judge them at the ballot well isn't that just like the devil he brings up all this dirt on you he says you did this and you did that and look at what you did just this last week and look at the habits in your life even if you repented of that you've done it so many times you're just going to do it again you can't repent them of a cycle of habits in your life you'll never break that he says but yet God says if you confess your sins I am faithful and just to forgive it and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness and it's popped over in the sea of forgetfulness where if you do it again God's still going to forgive you he's still going to forgive you he's going to forgive you 70 times 70. how could he be just and not forgive you 70 times 7. think about that because he told us to forgive seven times seven how much the more then should the infinite supreme ruler of the universe forgive 70 times 7. that's 490 have you gone through 490 cycles of sin maybe you have I think God's well able to go even beyond that and if Satan brought the case before God's judgment seat this morning it wouldn't even make the bar because God would just simply throw that out of court because his Justice he's already paid the price and he's not going to hear an invalid case so now we come down to really getting into fellowship with God for past four thousand years of church history and how God's injected himself by his grace into the human race through revelation and now it's beyond Revelation to the to the people of Israel but it's God injecting himself into his people through the blood and the life that's in that blood because the life of an animal can never come back upon man but when God gave his sacrifice there was a life in it otherwise what was the what was the big deal about the the blood of Jesus Christ if it was just blood but the difference of it was is that the life that was in that blood could come back upon man whereas the life of an animal cannot do anything for us the life that was in that blood the Holy Ghost the life of Jesus Christ could come back upon man and bring him into Fellowship into Oneness into Unity with God through a divine nature change so now we have open access to fellowship with God the Bible says you were called Under The Fellowship of Jesus Christ Our Lord you were called not you weren't searching after not you tried to find God but God called you do you know what that makes you this morning not only are you called but you've been invited by God I can't imagine a better invitation and if he invited me that means he he thought about me he thought about me from the foundation of the world I'm told in this Bible he knew my name the prophet says that he knew me in the inward parts of my mother before I was even birthed forth God knew my name that he predestinated me the Bible says it this way according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation the world you're chosen this morning that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to the praise the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved you're accepted this morning can I just take a moment to just push back a few lies the enemy in your hearts this morning you're maybe when you I don't know what your lives are like outside this very very few do I have that kind of chance to connect with you so intimately that I would know your complexes and what you deal with and and the trials that you have in this past week but whatever you're going out to whatever the world calls you oddball two-faced maybe they they have all sorts of names for you maybe they maybe they think you're awful weird you know the Bible also says that we're A peculiar people so I'll go ahead and take that label of being weird this morning I'll go ahead and take that label of being an oddball this morning I'm A peculiar people but you're chosen my God you're accepted of him this morning maybe there's sometimes new life where you don't even feel accepted by your friend group you don't feel accepted on social media nobody liked on your cool comments this week and you thought they were so funny on Facebook and nobody liked them you feel so unaccepted but you know what who's you know who's gonna like you every single time all you have to do is breathe the name of Jesus Christ this morning and you've got the supreme ruler of the universe the creator of your soul pressing your like button and saying yes you know what I didn't just like you this one time based on what you said but if you follow your your your history with me not your Facebook history but your history with me I liked you back in Genesis I like you back before Genesis I liked you before the foundation of the world I didn't just like you I put my heart right there that was my heart button and my heart button stayed with you throughout all the course of time no matter what you've done oh Hallelujah you're chosen my God you're accepted this morning you're accepted amongst the Beloved not only are you accepted amongst the Beloved but you are his beloved the Bible says even us whom Heath called not the Jews only but also the Gentiles as he said in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved you're God's beloved this morning your God's spouse his bride I don't think we always let that sink in for us as an individual it's easy to see to come to church and say oh yeah we're the we're the Bride of God but how about I'm the Bride of God I have the attention of God when I get on my knees God hears my prayer if God heard the prayer of David how much more would he hear the prayer of someone who's come underneath Fellowship by his blood if he could hear the prayer of the prophets that were underneath the fellowship of a blood of a lamb's blood Covenant how much more would he hear your prayer this morning Under The Fellowship of the Lamb oh Hallelujah not only are you beloved and chosen accepted but this morning you are complete in God it says in him dwelt the fullness that God had bodily and you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power you might not feel complete this morning you might feel like a work in progress how many times have we said well at least I can say this I'm not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be but I I remember what God sees God sees the end from the beginning he's outside of time when he looks at you underneath the blood Covenant of Jesus Christ he doesn't even see your current mistakes he sees you as he took that family picture before the foundation the world he sees you complete in him this morning have that confidence when you approach the Lord knowing that you're a new creation in God knowing that you're God's friend he said that you're my friends if you do whatsoever I have commanded you no I I used to be I've said it before but I used to be real jealous of Abraham because the Hebrews in the faith chapter said that Abraham was a friend of God I'm like man that'd be pretty neat to be a god I'd love to be God's friend and then come to find out Jesus said to us you are my friends I call you no longer servants no longer just the ones that do my bidding but I call you my friends if you do whatsoever I commanded you have you done his Commandments friends have you made yourself have you repented in the name of Jesus Christ have you been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ have you done all that was asked of you by this word then you're his friends this morning the fairy friend of God I have so many things that I got written down here but I think it would take all the time that we have this morning just to go over what God has called you though even the psalmist said that you know how wonderful are thy thoughts towards me O Lord and thy thoughts towards me are past numbering you want to know what God thinks about you just start reading in your Bible again I did say again because some of us going through little Cycles I'll just I'll just give the I'll just be honest here this morning where this busy life and all the things that distract us pull us away that we kind of get away from the Bible and get away from reading it like we should and refreshing our memories on what God told us you might say well I've read the Bible before you cover to cover sure but do you remember it do you remember what God's thoughts towards you are because I think a lot of these complexes that we deal with would get washed away if we just have a little bit more memory of what God's already said about us that you are his chosen people that you are accepted that you are complete in him that you are his beloved that you are his this morning that you are sealed in the day of your Redemption that you that no man not even the Devil Himself not even you yourself can pluck you from his hand these are the things that God says about you that you're his friend that it's not like Enoch how many times have we been jealous of Enoch that walked with God but he's called you into deeper fellowship and even Enoch had remember the types and shadows of the Old Testament are just types and shadows what is greater this morning my shadow here on the uh on on the platform or myself Enoch was only my shadow Enoch was only the shadow of the seventh Church age that would be called up into a Rapture with God the walk that we have is that much greater we're far past the Revelation The Ten Commandments we've got the revelation of the seven churches we've got the Revelation the of the Seven Seals we know the threefold purpose of God of Jesus Christ from the very beginning we're walking with God don't take it lightly and yet despite all this and this is where I'm trying to get to what I've wanted to achieve this sermon this is where we take the corner despite all this I find that as we go back to our scripture reading we had two scriptures one I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and the other was and Cain went out of the presence of the Lord and so many times despite all that God's achieved through through six thousand years of human history now we want to go back we want to go back from John and go all the way back to Genesis and identify ourselves with Cain and say and Cain went out of the presence of the Lord there's me and we'll come to church and we'll see everybody singing and worshiping around us and we'll hear them singing The Words the goodness the Lord is running after me and we'll mouth it along with them but there's a little part in the heart that says I wish God's goodness was running after me or we'll sing songs about the presence of God and we'll just say I wish I was in God's instead here I am for months now here with Cain I've gone out from the presence of the Lord you might feel and yes just like canine I've got my family I've got my children I'm building my kingdom like Cain built this city but it's all outside of God and I just want to attack a few lies the enemy this morning if I could because that's really nothing but a lie that God's presence isn't with you this morning the God's presence isn't with you tomorrow that God's presence will ever leave you because here in John he said I will send the comforter and he will be with you he will abide in you and he will not leave you he will be with you forever that you cannot Escape let me put it this way the holy ghost-filled Child of God the holy ghost-filled daughter or son of God cannot Escape God's presence not like David said where one in one chapter he was saying I I can't escape God's presence but in another chapter he said it casts not thy Holy Spirit from me we're Beyond an Old Testament experience with the Holy Ghost because this Holy Ghost is no longer on the spirit like it was with David this Holy Ghost has now been made a way there's been made an Avenue by the blood of Jesus Christ that the Holy Ghost could drop down into a man's Soul feel the doors shut behind him and say nobody's coming in this Soul until the end of time it don't matter how hard Sodom knocks at the door it doesn't matter how hard Facebook and the internet and pornography and entertainment and your own sins and your own mistakes and the old Temptations knock at your door no one's coming this Soul because I've found an Avenue I've found a way and I've paid the price of the propitiation of all sins for the beasts in the world and I am the Lamb of God God I spread my arms across a tree one day two thousand years ago and I paid the price the price and I paid it for my children and I'll not suffer anyone to knock at the door of their heart once they've invited me in once I've sealed that door shut behind me I'm not leaving this throne room oh Hallelujah now that might sound pretty good on paper but yet there's something that still answers Into the Heart of Believers that I find they still will relate back to Cain and say yes I know that in my head because it's written there in the scriptures and black and white white and even red but I still identify with Cain I still don't feel that I'm in God's presence there's something separating me and I just want to come against that lie a little bit this morning I want to tear down a few strongholds this morning oh Hallelujah you cannot get away from God's presence but here's Satan's trick is he'll believe he'll twist our understanding to make us believe that we can he'll twist your understanding even about what God's presence is and he'll maybe water down words you know we we see this trick throughout time that Satan will change words so their meaning is lost to us he'll even change the the meaning of the word male and female so that over time as the generations go down it may not happen in our generation but if time continues as generation goes down it'll be so overlapped until without without correct understanding will have just as much confusion about it as we do about what a woman's garment is and what a man's haircut looks like because he changes the meaning of things he'll take things like even the word omnipresence and he'll water down God's omnipresence did you know that brother Branham said that God is Not omnipresent not in the way that we would think it would be I'm trading trading on some dangerous ground this morning so I'm going to read the quote directly he said God is a being not just like a myth not like the wind over the Earth but God's not just like the air if he would you would have never had to seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you because he'd be filling everything makes good sense don't it I love it when things make good sense gives me a good answer to the devil don't it says God's omnipresent sure by being omniscient and knowing all things but God has a Dwelling Place because why because he's a being if you want to know where God's dwelling place is if you want to know where his presence is you've got to find out where his dwelling place is now you're on the Journey of job where he said oh if I could just go up and knock on God's door but I believe that many have already completed the journey you're just not maybe recognizing it this morning God has a dwelling place and God dwells with Fellowship under the shed blood of the son and that's that alone David said oh if I could just dwell in the presence of the Lord if I could just dwell in the Tabernacle and the house the Lord all the days of my life yet he didn't realize that that wasn't God's objective God's objective was not for you to come here this morning and to stay here and isolate yourself in the world so you could stay here all the days of your life this was never to be God's Tabernacle how amazing would David have felt if he had known that God's objective was oh if I could just dwell in David all days of his life that God wasn't looking for man to come to his dwelling place but God said sacrifices and offerings I would as not but a body thou Hast prepared for me I'm looking to dwell in a body that's where God's dwelling place is so if you want to get around God you're going to be stuck with me I'll tell you what if you don't have the Holy Ghost yet this morning and you want to get around God just find the Holy Ghost filled believer that's where he dwells I'll tell you what if you want to be sure that God's with you all the days of your life just get the Holy Ghost you don't have to keep on finding God and losing God and being caught out there on the outside and the outer courts like David was saying oh cast not by Holy Spirit from me one day I feel your anointing and one day I don't it was all on the spirit level but there's a whole nother level where God wants to step into your soul and fulfill his promise to you that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you forever holidays ever been out in the woods or maybe in a strange place and maybe you were with your partner or your family and you got lost found yourself all alone how'd that feel maybe as a child you could remember it or some of us even as adults we still get scared of being alone what about a promise that you would never be alone and what would it be if that promise has already been fulfilled to you that you are never alone not by because God's omniscient and so he's kind of with you everywhere just like he's with the other guy down the street everywhere because he feels all time in space see that's the watered down way God's not with you like he's with the sinner across the street he wants to be in you he wants to come to you and abide with you so that you'll never be alone that every trouble of life God is just a breath's prayer away now that's a door to Fellowship that's a real door to Fellowship right there here's another thing that Satan will do for us for us or to us I guess it would be how about when you come into church and you sing some different songs like for example there's nothing like the presence there's nothing like the presence of the Lord how many have you ever how many has ever felt that or sang that and felt there really is nothing like the presence of the Lord because the anointing is just so thick at that moment and then you don't realize it but it's the devil that comes to you and you think if I could just take this presence with me now we're getting the difference between God's anointing and his presence confused and letting Satan pull the wool over your eyes that you're not taking the presence of the Lord with you so we have to be very careful about our language and even very careful about the way we sing and understand our songs so that we can have the right understanding of things it's like the song we bring the sacrifice of praise in the house the lord well usually when we sing that we're understanding also that we are also the house the Lord there's this duplicity of language that's happening and that's why I like the song um this is your house I remember the first time we ever sang that song here well no the first time we ever sang that song I sang we just sang the first chorus this is your house this is your house finally come and dwell and you know I in my mind's eye I thought about it as the congregation of Saints and the fact that we were all here together and this is your house and we're preparing forth service and Lord come and speak to us in in the broader sense right but how many remember the first time you sang that second course and it it went from this is your house to we are your house I am your house and now we we really understood what the song was talking about it's I'm the Tabernacle of God Lord come and come and dwell here if you're not already abiding in me and your Holy Spirit Come and come and make me your Tabernacle I'm your house I was built for the presence of God I was built for the inhabitation of the Holy One I was built to be holy as he is Holy and now all of a sudden the right understanding of the song brings forth all this Revelation and understanding in this beautiful worship before the Lord I wonder if we can maybe if a sound and audio video team could bring up that song um the song that uh in the presence of the Lord um forgive me it was there's nothing like the presence of the Lord as they bring up the lyrics you'll see there's nothing like the presence of the Lord there's nothing like the in in your presence there is peace and your presence there is forgiveness and your presence there's healing and and if we're singing it wrongly we'll think while I'm here in this moment there's peace while I'm here in this moment there's healing and there's forgiveness and and we're not recognizing the presence of the Lord that the the daily presence the Lord is going unrecognized go ahead and go to the next song brother there's Deliverance there's joy there's freedom there's healing there's Revival in the presence of God and we think oh here in this moment in the here now all these things are available to me and Satan will be like yeah if you don't get it right now you're just gonna have to wait until the next service the anointing comes see he wants to change our understanding well even sing like that we're coming into the presence of the Lord but what is what are we really singing about or singing about the fellowship of God so there's a difference between God's Fellowship God's presence because while it's true that the holy ghost-filled Christian cannot get away from God's presence you still have a choice because God's a gentleman whether or not you're going to be in a fellowship with him he doesn't get up in your face and and make you have fellowship with him the Bible says it this way Christ says abide in me and die in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself accept it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me shall bear much fruit but without me you can do nothing so now we're moving from God just abiding in US to are we abiding in God now we're moving down at the real question that Satan doesn't want us to ask and it becomes a little bit more difficult because now it's no longer well presence of God with me or not and if the presence of God isn't with me then there's Talent like this I don't know the shared responsibility maybe he's not here so you know I'm not fully culpable right now but if he's here then now the only thing that's left is are you entertaining his presence if he's abiding in you the only thing is left is are you abiding in him you made a choice 10 or 15 or 20 years ago or maybe just a month ago to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and he's abiding in you but are you making the choice daily to abide in him now we're delving down to uh your responsibility we're moving from just being in God's presence to being in fellowshipping and communion with him and so many times I I wonder if we're making a little excuse for ourselves well I'll just wait till church and then I'll get in the presence of God but what if you were so aware that God's presence was with you in the car would you choose that radio station or would you choose to speak to him what if you were aware that God's presence was with you in your living room and your home what would be your choices see Satan wants you to think that God's way out here oh he's watching it's from a distance like his omnipresence it's there but it's kind of from a distance his eyes are from a distance but what if what if you know he said I I'm knocking on your heart store whoever will open I'll come in and sup with him and you've already opened the door and he's he's sitting over here at your table and he's just waiting to sup with you now you've already opened your heart's door with him he's not leaving he's not going anywhere he's going to fulfill his promise to you he said I'm here I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but now what are we going to do are we going to entertain his presence are we going to fellowship with him or are we going to be distracted you know David pled Lord turn not thy face from me but now I feel like maybe we're all just turning our faces from the Lord over to our cell phones it's like he's over there I mean anybody ever caught yourself doing this with your spouse or even God forbid a guest because at least your spouse you know they're just your spouse after all but a guest it's embarrassing when it happens to a guest and you just out of habit pulled out your cell phone and you're you're looking at it just your face is just engrossed and they're over there and kind of tooling their thumbs that's God's presence today brother Brandon piece of sermon the presence of God unrecognized and how many times we're still not recognizing the presence of God in our daily lives here's another one Captain he's present but we're hurried we're in a rush were we've got the next thing coming got to get ready for work and after once we get done once we once we get in the car we've we've got to catch up with the news and once we get to work we've got to catch up with this and and and and this whole world is just so set up to hurry us technology has bought us so much time but it's substituted with chains of bondage back to it we we got the washing machine along with the washing machine we got the television we got the laptop to make this more effective at work and now I have to work so many hours but with a laptop we also got social media and cell phones in our pockets everything else so it comes down to your choice where are you going to put your time at are we going to be fellowshipping with God and I'd like to say this that abiding is incompatible With A hurried lifestyle some of us just need to slow down God has bought all of this for you he's bought for you access to his presence that you can come boldly before him anytime and come into fellowship with them that you don't have to work like an Israelites did and say well if I want to come into a fellowship with God I'm going to have to pick out the best unblemished cattle and unblemish sheep and I'm gonna have to come and bring it before an altar and I'm going to have to do all this and spill some blood and it's it's a whole day prayer just to be able to dress ourselves up for the presence of God but God's removed all those barriers but have you removed yours God's removed all the barriers to get into his presence and the only thing that's remaining is the barriers that you've allowed this world Direct for that Fellowship to happen the only barriers between you and God are the barriers that you've allowed to be erected no longer the barriers that Adam and Eve have erected those have been torn down the middle wall has been torn down that wall of separation but now we've got the walls of our cell phones and our hurried lifestyles some of us just need a little bit more quiet places in our life you know even to his disciples who didn't have cell phones at the time Christ came along and said hey come away to a quiet place we're too busy right now and they had to have that Fellowship that communion in quiet places how about present but you're just not interested that you find it easier to enjoy the fellowship with Allah the world than the fellowship with God maybe because it's easier to press a button it's more instantly gratifying get your dopamines up by jumping on Facebook um it's just too hard to slow down and change your lifestyle you've you've sold out too much to it and you're enjoying it too much and you're not recognizing the beauty that God wants to offer you that would be kind of like the Gentiles and the people of Israel before the Ten Commandments came and God comes along and offers the Ten Commandments and in there it says don't commit adultery and they're too busy having fornicating affairs with everyone and they're like this is too much fun I'm not going to give up that lifestyle and not saying wait this is God's grace to me he's he's got a better way for me and we know now because we've been following him this way long enough that we know that a one-woman man and a one-man woman is the best way that it could possibly be right that's God's grace to us that it's a beautiful wonderful thing and how we would never want to go back to anything else we even talk about it when when someone makes that mistake they we say they they fell because we're way up here and this is just so way down here what if what if we changed our priorities so much and I'm culpable this morning I'm here with you I'm I'm going through this myself I'm I I allowed myself to come underneath that same that same lie of the enemy that God's presence was was distant from me and that it was God that was distant and I didn't know how to get into his presence there was just too much work and all the this facade of lies that were constructed and just the other day I was in the car and the Lord just began to speak to my heart and was like God just missed me and I found out that as he began to peel back the lies in my own heart I said you're right Lord you are present I don't have to work at this thing I don't have to work at climbing a mountain to get back into God's presence I don't have to go climb Mount Sinai all I have to do is just breathe his name and when I breathed that precious name of Jesus I said Lord would you like to have fellowship with me right now peace in the presence of the Lord just came into the car and my next stop I just had to wipe away the tears I said Lord was it that easy the whole time because in my mind I built it up a lot more than that I built it up like your presence was so far from me and I had to do this this and this to get back into presence with you and now I'm coming out from the other side of that lie and I'm saying Lord your presence is right here now I want to enjoy your fellowship and whatever I have to do to change my lifestyle that's the way I want to do it and I believe that if the Lord takes me on this road I'll be able to look back one day and and just as I'll be able to say wow that cell phone is so far beneath me now just like adultery would be so far beneath me after I was after I've enjoyed what God has for me in a one-woman marriage it's so far beneath me I hear about what these people and and and Hollywood do and these billionaires do and they're like wow they've got all those billions richest man in the world maybe in that's what he's doing with his life wow my life is way better than his and I believe that if we could have that lesson from the old Ten Commandments given 5 000 years ago or so how much more if we could learn a few Lessons In This Modern Age that we need to rearrange our priorities and not fall prey to the lifestyle of this world and lift up fellowship with God and fellowship with his people above everything else what is that what saith in scripture gather yourselves together so much the more as that day cometh gather yourselves together like this or maybe gather yourselves together all watching a movie together no that's not what I'm talking about gather yourselves together in Fellowship that's what we need to be focusing on right now is to rearrange all of our priorities so that it becomes the most interesting thing in our lives you know I find out that the thing that you feed on the most becomes the thing that's most interesting to you I've had Hobbies and that I no longer like anymore because I don't feed on them anymore some of them were perfectly fine Hobbies had to be kind of you know be kind of silly for me to share some of the Hobbies right now that I want that I had when I was a 12 year old or even some of the hobbies that I had in my 20s but I put those things away like Paul said I put away the childish things when I became a man and I think there's still some Childish things in my life and maybe in yours too that I'm working to put away because I want to enjoy the manly fellowship with the most manliest man that ever walked the face the Earth the Lord Jesus Christ and the more that we feed on that the more interesting it will become maybe it just becomes a bunch of black letters to you right now but you keep feeding on it and you keep feeding on it you find yourself in the word and you find out wow God has a lot to say about men in here you find out God called me his friend and he called me accept and beloved and complete and redeemed and sealed into the end and then he he starts talking about my brothers and sisters in here how we're all caught up together and having places and we're gonna live in a city where the lamb is the light have you ever thought about the city where the lamb is the light and wondered I hope I make it out there I hope I make it to where the lamb is the light I hope I don't have to be one of those ones that live outside the city well there's another lie of the devil this morning because how could it be that you will have the promise that God would be with you forever and then you get up right to the Gates of Glory it says oh yeah that ex that promise has expired here's the city where the lamb is like you're going to live just over there outside the city that's just a lie at the enemy trying to confuse you with all these wonderings just have confidence in God this morning or what about I hope I don't make I don't I hope I don't end up in hell what is hell but the absence of God's presence and if God has sealed his presence presence into you for all of time how could you ever go to hell your very makeup who you are could would ruin hell itself because the moment that you stepped into hell hell would no longer be hell because there would be the presence of God hell hell is reserved for the devil and his angels and it's it's a place of separation from God's presence and if God has promised that he who receives the Holy Ghost could never be separated from my presence then you could never be placed in hell how do you receive it this morning repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins paid for by the Lamb of God and he says I will bring you into Fellowship underneath my blood Covenant you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's your promise this morning might be saying though but brother Josiah will feel so distant from God and there are times in our lives where we do feel distant from God a lot of it I think is because we allow these lies to come in and make us believe that we're distant from God's presence even when we're not but there is a place where although God's presence doesn't leave us brother Branham said it's almost like that Dove on the lamb flies up and rests on a little Branch somewhere when you take on the nature of a wolf how many remembers that that quote now remember once your nature is changed fundamentally on the soul level that nature will always be divine so what brother bran I'm speaking about is on the spirit level you change from that land that's easily led by the dove and you watch you go out and watch some some horror flick try doing that no don't but you let's say you you watch some movie that's incompatible with the spirit of the dove and you pollute your own spirit now that Dove can't rest on you that Dove can't lead you you've LED yourself into a place that now your spirit is incompatible with his and yes there's a there's a temporary breaking in Fellowship he's just kind of out a limb somewhere waiting for you to change that spirit that nature back to that land so if you're there this morning friends you do have some work to do to enjoy God's presence enjoy that Fellowship again but the work isn't so difficult the work isn't nearly as hard it was for the Israelites God's made a path of repentance so much solely said if we confess our sins I am faithful and I am just to forgive you of your sins and to clean up your spirit realm of all that filth and all that pollution and cleanse you from all unrighteousness that's God's promise to us this morning as the musicians would perhaps come I hope this has been a help for you this morning to take away from you the lies the enemy that God's presence isn't with you but to come back to the word you know that's the that's the Surefire way to get the devil off your back is to just come back to the word come back away from reasoning away even from song lyrics because you see how the devil will twist your understanding of even beautiful songs and mess with your understanding there but if you get back the word and just believe God's promises and filter everything else through that I wonder if musicians would start playing that song Maybe there's nothing like the presence of the Lord we'll filter I want us to I want us to sing that to the Lord this morning brother Michael you can come and maybe back maybe sing that this morning with the right understanding there's nothing like the presence of the Lord there's nothing like God's abiding presence that will never leave you it will never forsake you there's nothing like the presence of the Lord that has been bought and paid for by his own blood there's nothing like The Fellowship of the Lord there's nothing like The Fellowship of the Lord that leads to healing and Redemption to to Deliverance let's sing that together now brother [Music] nothing like the presence nothing like the presence nothing like the presence of the Lord oh there's still even saying depressed they're still even seeing the Press [Music] singing presence oh this lady said the presence [Music] Joy foreign [Music] [Music] the presence [Music] Joy Joy presence of the Lord [Music] oh yes there is [Music] presence of the Lord [Music] so much freedom in the presence [Music] of the Lord oh there is healing there is healing oh yes there is [Music] a very easy [Music] oh yes there is [Music] no friends [Music] living just something in the spread freedom is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh Hallelujah is that your desire this morning oh friends I hope that you'll just tear down every wall of bondage Every Lie the devil's taught you about the presence of God and recognize the presence of Jesus Christ not just this morning but recognize the promised presence of Jesus Christ abiding in your heart when you leave here this morning that freedom is still accessible when you leave here this morning that Deliverance is still no further from you than the presence of Jesus Christ the Perpetual abiding presence of Jesus Christ not abiding with the pastor not abiding with the Deacon but abiding in Your Heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there in your heart in baptism in the Holy Ghost there's Deliverance there's the statue of a perfect man there's the fruit of the spirit there's peace there's joy unspeakable there's Deliverance there's everything you could desire you might say brother just stop you don't understand I've been through a cycle of bondage you don't understand ever since I was 13 years old I had this problem over here I can't tell you all the technical ways to get out of a cycle of bondage you might go through years of counsel with somebody and sit down with a brother or sister who's who's had victory in their life but with a family issue that your family is dealing with or the personal personal thing that you're dealing with over here you might have years of cycle of bondage on the internet years of cycle of bondage over some kind of Addiction on a video game or whatever you're dealing with I don't know friends but I can tell you one thing that delivers Jesus Christ you can do all the technical things you can strip your your computer of the internet you can throw away your cell phones you can enlist yourself in a in a monastery if that's what you think you need to get more serious with God that will yield any fruit unless you abide in Jesus Christ if you abide in me then you'll bear much fruit he says that fruit will push away all the bad food but he says if you don't abide in there you can do nothing [Music] God wants to show you this morning this presence is here on this platform I want to get that lie so far away from our hearts this morning not hear your seat this morning but God's presence he said it's a Bobby that you prepared him I want to dwell in your Tabernacle I want to dwell in your heart you were created for my presence you are created for my Holiness you are created to be a holy being unto me [Music] when you leave here this morning you have not left the presence [Music] of God if you have the Holy Ghost and you I keep saying that because it's so important Paul himself said make your calling and your election sure be certain of your own salvation but if you're certain this morning of God's Gift the Holy Ghost this morning in your life and be certain be certain of his presence of you if you're dealing with some some repetitious and friends that you feel like I I just I'll repent of it and I don't feel good because I know it's just gonna happen again why don't you just try letting that burden grow this morning they're saying I I'm just going to start driving with I'm going to start by going the presence of the chain breaker I'm going to start by going into the presence I've been talking to all these people that have so much advice about how to get free I'm gonna go to the one who freed them I've been having counselor with a pastor about how to how to be a better Christian I'm going to go to the one who made my pastor a better Christian I've been listening to so many sermons about brother Branham I'm gonna go to the source where brother Branham got his sermons you know if you do anything else if you try if you just focus on hearing what other men have to say the spirit told me this oh my let me write that one down the spirit told me this that's really good but if you can never say the spirit told me this then you're just feeding off somebody else's spirituality and there will be no fruit in that he did not say if you abide in Paula Fontaine you'll bring more more food he did not say if you abide in Josiah Cornett he'd even say if you abide in the William Brandon you'll bring forth much through he wants to make this personal with you if you abide in me so that's that song one more time but let's let's sing it with a feeling knowing that you hear this he's talking to you [Music] [Music]
