get it wrong worship is more than a [Music] song for worship is more than a [Music] [Applause] song Clear the Stage and set the sound in lights a blaze if that's the measure you must take to crush the idol we're going to read from Luke 21 which is the some of the prophecy that Jesus gave himself for the last days this is uh scripture that no doubt you've read read many times and preachers and Minister many times because when Jesus is speaking about the last days and all the all the things that go with it you're familiar with that not only by what Jesus said but also watching it take place and throughout these last few scriptures of Luke you'll find uh things talking about the the uh um the the Vengeance and the the different uh things that are taking place of wars and rumors of wars uh uh the pressure that comes out earthquakes and diverse places these are terms from the end time these things increase and Jesus said these will be signs that you're getting close to the end when these things increase earthquakes and divers places and all the other things that he mentioned when he gets towards the end of Luke 21 um he goes into something I think we should give attention to and uh it really starts here in verse 26 when he says uh we just read 25 and there shall be signs of the Sun and the Moon in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and looking after those things which are coming on the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken so there is a fear and men's Hearts failing for fear just by them watching what's coming and sensing what's coming and seeing the accumulation and the increase of things going on in the news and and the violence and the things increasing that it is this will uh create a fear uh in men's hearts and I'm just going to skip now all the way down to verse 34 and this is how he ends this prophecy which I think is significant he points his attention towards our hearts Jesus points his attention to our hearts of all the signs of all the things that's going on now he says in verse 34 take heed to yourself lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of Life worries of life and so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always how many want to uh pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all of these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man I want to point it out again that his emphasis after all of the signs of the end time turns to our hearts being over burdened and over pressured by the worries of life and the scares of life he directs his attention towards our hearts we've also been uh referring to I want to refer back to psalms 27 and not the whole chapter as we read a few weeks ago we've been talking about the time of trouble and that term comes from psalms 27 which is a a a a scripture that is uh related to the end time and the rapture and I'll just pull out one little couple verses from there again as we read it a couple weeks ago right there here at verse verse five for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock I want to point out again in Luke 21 that in the Prophecies of the end time all of the prophet phes at the end of the prophecy for Jesus he turns the attention towards our hearts and uh in Psalms 27 he says he will hide Us in other words in that particular time of trouble at the end time his answer will be not necessarily that we go out and we fight against it or we try to change it if there's any emphasis I'd like to make this morning for your lives is that we're in a position in this world in the last second of time that we cannot change the atmospheres of the world we cannot change the evil that's happening we cannot change the violence that's Rising as a matter of fact you can't change other people like you'd like to change them how many would raise hand and say if I could just change some other people in my life life would be better we have no guarantee we can't change our boss we can't change the atmospheres that are around us we can't change that Satan is trying through Sodom and gorah to knock on the doors of our homes and bring that Sodom Spirit into our home we can't change that knocking at our door but what we look at in this hour is the things that God can change what we look at in the things that we can have control over because there's a lot of things that we don't have control over and in the time of trouble he didn't say I'm going to have you go out and fight against these things and raise up a a a a a government that would fight against the problems he said in that hour in the time of trouble I'll provide a place for you and I'll hide you and when he mentions Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle it's a spiritual connotation to a place that means protection because we'll need to be protected our children will need to be protected and now I want to go specific to what I'm going to speak about this morning for a short time is that there's a couple things that we can control and that we could can put guards in place and they're very important places and I talked to the young people about it this week there's there's a there's a crucial thing that we need to look towards and that's the protection and the the place God provided to protect our minds and our hearts yes there might not be a lot of things that we can control and protect but God gives us promises in the word that he will put protections for our minds and our hearts which means our thoughts and our emotions they have to be guarded yes in this hour yes they have to be protected can you say Amen the the battlefield is the Mind Satan Wars against your soul but but the battlefield is the mind and the spirit that's right and if he can live there and get in there and dominate that he he can dominate your life so the Bible refers to it as couple places but the corrupting of the minds Paul said I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve that you should be corrupted in your minds and your thoughts from the Simplicity of Christ right so it's a Corruption of the mind and then all of the scriptures that speak of the heart the Bible speaks of a a broken heart the Bible speaks of a hardened heart the Bible speaks of an evil heart the Bible speaks of a proud heart a fearful heart a hurting heart that's been hurt a damaged heart a fainting heart and a lustful heart and there's many many more talking about the conditions of a heart which by the way only the Lord can heal only the Lord because he says I came to heal the brokenhearted I sent my word to heal not only your bodies can you say Amen not only your soul but to heal the brokenhearted to deliver a lustful heart can you say Amen to Humble a proud heart to soften a hardened heart he sent all this in order for us to be healed so I I I I had just been saying in in my thoughts that if God cared so much to talk in scripture and the message about not only our souls but where our heart is and where our mind is and where our thoughts is then if we're not giving it as much attention that's a problem if we're going to be immature and say I'm coming to church so my soul can be fed and that's what's fed and that's the key area because God can work out of that but if we're ignoring what's going in our minds if we're ignoring what we're feeding on every day if we're ignoring feeding on too much of social media and feeding on too much of negative what you're letting in your thoughts and letting in your emotions is very important to God and if it's important to God it should be important to us so I'm saying that a Believer can come to a message church and hear the all the good soul food that you can hear the very best with the light of the message but if you go home ignoring your heart and your thoughts you're going to be defeated that's right Satan's going to have the victory in your life that's right and so I'm I'm I'm going to speak to you real clearly about it because if it's important to God it should be important to us especially this coming year in the same message though is God in our message God as Satan is being very intentional to uh to go for the minds and the battle of the Mind the battle of the heart the message is God being very intentional to speak things that care for our souls care for our hearts and our minds and to put a protection in place for the last days the message is very intentional by God to our hearts and if we're feeding on it you'll find it very intentional amen that's right to put in place protections he will hide me he will he will have a place of protection a guard and a shield of our hearts and Minds if we will hide in that word and believe that word it will guard and protect us during this time it'll hide us from what the damage and the abuse he will be doing to hearts and Minds in this time of trouble it will be this age and its damage of the hearts that God will respond to to provide a place for his people he will need to provide a place of healing and deliverance can you say Amen but also he will put in that word some safeguards that will protect these special areas of your mind and your heart if we don't value those areas of our Temple that we can have control over then no matter how many protections God puts in place if you don't value it because you see what you don't value you don't take care of if you don't see the high value of your mind and your thoughts every day and your emotions to put guards and boundaries up to say Satan you're only going to go so far that's not going to get in if you don't do it God can have all the scriptures he wants to help you but you have to see the value of your temple young person you have to see the your parents can teach you but you go off with your phone and if you don't see the value of what goes in your mind then you'll never put up guards to say no I sto right there my mind is not a garbage can Hallelujah it belongs to the Lord my emotions are not just up and down to take any guy or girl anybody who says a hurtful comment and then I'm hurt by it no I put a guard up to those things because my temple Belongs to the Lord but often God values these things we should often we throw we we're throwing our thoughts and our Spirits out there so vulnerable to all kinds of negative maybe filth maybe fears unfounded fears and we do it to ourselves because maybe we have not learned how precious these areas are and how they need to be hidden in his protection to get them listen now to get those places so hidden in Christ that it's very hard for the devil to get to those areas look at this that you had actually so put protection place to your mind and spirit that the devil's having a real hard time getting to those areas it's just difficult man can live so close to God and become so hidden in Christ that the devil doesn't know where to find him hallu if you were looking for some highly doctrinal explosive Pizzaz this morning Revelation in the word maybe come back another Sunday because this isn't it I'm talking about your heart and your mind your emotions and what gets in and what doesn't belong there putting a value on it we will protect something better when we see the value of it when we lose the value of it it's not as important to protect and guard over so when it comes to our hearts and Minds this is what one writer said about it guarded hearts and Minds means to actively protect one's emotions and thoughts from harmful influences guarded hearts and Minds means to actively protect one's emotions and thoughts from harmful influences essentially being mindful of what enters your heart and mind often with the idea of maintaining a positive and Healthy Outlook by filtering out negativity or harmful stimuli filtering that out this phrase is frequently used in a spiritual context drawing from the Bible verse in Proverbs 4:23 which says above all else guard your heart for everything you do flows from your heart guard your heart Above All Else guard your heart for the issues of life come from your heart so it says to guard your heart Deuteronomy 6:7 says you teach them diligently to your children the word of God impressing God's precepts on their minds and penetrating their hearts with his truths this is a mandate for parents if you got children it's you teach this word to them and it's not just for their souls to get a hold of someday but you're impressing God's precept on their minds and penetrating their hearts with his truths and shall speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up this is what you're saturated with and don't make it a don't make it a drudgery if they sense in you that this is a drudgery to you this word they're going to pick up on that that's right but but it's life to you it's a passion to you it's what you talk about because it means it's more than just words to you it's the person of Christ to you being welcome his presence being welcome in your home send that message to your kids praise the Lord and when when David is talking to about the people dedicating the temple vers 1st Chronicles 2917 1st Chronicles 29:7 I know also my God that you test the heart and Delight in the uprightness and integrity in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things so now with joy I have seen your people who are present here make their offerings willingly and freely to you oh Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel our fathers keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the minds of the people and direct their hearts towards you it's all through the Bible your hearts and your minds are important to God 1 John 5:21 says little children Believers dear ones guard yourselves from Idols from false teachings moral compro compromises and anything that would take the place take God's place in your heart and he says guard yourself from Idols of the Heart Guard yourself when with inletting something that takes over more importance than worshiping God it's all through the Bible and the one I like to bring is 2 Corinthians 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ how many of you do that how many of us do that every thought has to be checked that's right amen I Illustrated this a few months ago might have been in last year even that when we hit 911 it was a shock to the nation that an enemy could actually get so sneak so much into our system became pilots and an enemy could drive three planes and kill a bunch of people it was a shock we couldn't believe the enemy where did he get in at well he got trained to to run the airplanes for months maybe years nobody picked up on them it's a reflection friends that the enemy can get in places where you don't expect so after 911 our whole security system went Skyhigh can you say Amen our airports changed scanners were put in it's it's a it's a complicated thing to go through airports isn't it brother Tony but all of us do it we tolerate it we do it because why protections had to be put in place Hallelujah that the enemy can't get in that's sometimes it takes a 911 in your life to jolt you that's TR that you start putting some Protections in place with your phone and your computer and the books you read and the music you listen to and I'm not talking to young people this morning only I'm talking about every adult that's here every person every believer don't let a 911 happen in your life to joou listen to the preacher now you need a scanner on your thoughts you need a scanner on your heart you need a filter of the word of God to check every thought before it comes in [Applause] Hallelujah it says to take captivity every thought see that's the thing with imaginations that's right it's a realm that nobody sees you may never go to a movie theater but you can create your own movies in your imagination sexual lustful Vengeance on somebody and you enjoy it because you're not really doing it you're just imagining doing it your imagination has the power to do that but it doesn't make it right you haven't turned your imagination over to God that he could use your imagination and so now take into captivity every thought and there has to be a scanner on your thought life and on your heart and your emotions that you test every thought that's trying to come in everything that you're reading everything that you're listening to test the music by the spirit of God and uh if something's getting in that's not right you take into captivity that's right amen if if something's coming in through somebody don't mean to belittle him he's a nice guy but if he's carrying the wrong thing on him then a a wrong thought uh a lustful thought a hurtful comment somebody made this is all things that try to get into our system fear condemnation from the devil I I'm only mentioning a few of thousands of things that try to get into our spirit try to get into our heart they shouldn't be allowed in that's and the Bible says is that you stop it at the scanner no you're I'm not letting that in my thought life I'm not letting you in as a matter of fact I'm putting on the handcuffs buddy you know and I only illustrate this to all of you guys to be serious spiritually in your life that you can see the Bible says to take every thought captive on you don't just try to reason with it you say well maybe this will be okay if I found something on this guy which it doesn't look all right what are you doing with this pen what in the world flashlight flashlight what do you use this for I don't trust it I'm keeping it well no I don't want it in my life I'm not keeping it I'm I'm getting rid of it I could do a thorough skin but listen I'm sorry I don't trust you you're not getting in I'm putting you captive might be the simplest illustration but this is what you do this year do it today do it tomorrow do it this year sat tell Satan I'd love to have this group today rise and say Satan my mind is not a garbage can for your trash my emot don't belong to you they belong to God I use my emotions to worship God to be happy in the Lord and that's it nothing else gets in thank you for watching our
