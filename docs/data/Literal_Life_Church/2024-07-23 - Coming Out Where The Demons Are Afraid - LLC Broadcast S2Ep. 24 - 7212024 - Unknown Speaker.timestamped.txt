[4:35] good thank you
[4:38] Lord got a reason to
[4:42] pra give him a
[4:44] praise
[4:52] re Mark chapter 5 and they come over
[4:56] unto other side of the sea into the
[4:58] country of the
[5:00] gines and when he was come out of the
[5:03] ship immediately there met him out of
[5:06] the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit
[5:10] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[5:14] no man could bind him no not with change
[5:18] I just want to just uh identify in the
[5:21] scripture things that stories like this
[5:23] that are told but there's always a
[5:26] meaning and something behind the story
[5:28] that we can learn and for a man that had
[5:30] an unclean spirit and he came out of the
[5:33] tombs we realize to meet Jesus he's
[5:36] dwelling among the tombs uh that's not a
[5:39] good place to be dwelling if you're
[5:41] wanting to be set
[5:43] free because that he had been often
[5:46] bound with feathers and chains and the
[5:48] chains had been plucked under by him and
[5:50] the feathers broken in pieces neither
[5:52] could any man tame him and always night
[5:55] and day he was in the mountains and in
[5:57] the tombs crying
[6:00] and cutting himself with stones
[6:02] interesting cutting himself with stones
[6:05] but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran
[6:09] and worshiped him and cried with a loud
[6:12] voice and said what have I to do with
[6:14] thee Jesus thou son of the most high God
[6:16] I adure Thee by God that thou torment me
[6:19] not did you wondering what's happening
[6:21] now that the demons are talking through
[6:23] this man now and they're saying for
[6:25] Jesus to leave them alone because now
[6:28] that this man has come in the presence
[6:30] of Christ the demons are tormented
[6:34] that's
[6:35] right before the demons were tormenting
[6:39] the
[6:39] man but once he comes in the presence of
[6:42] the Lord the demons become tormented
[6:45] that's right for he said unto him come
[6:48] out of the man thou unclean spirit and
[6:50] he asked him what is thy name and he
[6:52] answered saying my name is Legion for we
[6:55] are many and he besought him much that
[6:57] he would not send them away out of the
[6:59] country now there was there nigh unto
[7:02] the mountains a great herd of swine
[7:04] feeding and all the Devils besought him
[7:06] saying send us into the swine that we
[7:09] may enter into them and forth withth
[7:11] Jesus gave them leave and the unclean
[7:13] spirits went out and entered into the
[7:15] swine and the herd ran violently down a
[7:18] steep Place into the sea and they were
[7:20] about 2,000 and were choked in the sea
[7:23] and they that fed the swine fled and
[7:25] told it in the city excuse me they that
[7:26] fed the swine fled and told it in the
[7:29] the city and in the country and they
[7:31] went out to see what it was that was
[7:33] done and they came to Jesus and see him
[7:36] that was possessed with the devil and
[7:38] had the legion and they seen him sitting
[7:41] and clothed and in his right mind and
[7:45] they were afraid and they saw it they
[7:48] that saw it told them how it befell to
[7:50] him that was possessed with the devil
[7:52] and also concerning the swine and they
[7:54] begin to pray him to depart out of their
[7:56] coast and when he was come into the ship
[7:58] he that had been possessed with the
[8:00] devil prayed him that he might be with
[8:02] him how be it Jesus suffered him not but
[8:05] saith unto him go home to thy friends
[8:08] and tell them how great things the Lord
[8:10] has done for thee and hath compassion on
[8:14] thee and he departed and begin to
[8:16] publish in docis how great things Jesus
[8:19] had done for him and all men did Marvel
[8:23] I want to speak this morning on coming
[8:25] out where the demons are
[8:27] afraid and um I I want to just continue
[8:31] on the you know I've been talking about
[8:32] freedom in Christ and being really free
[8:35] that Jesus Christ has unlimited freedom
[8:37] for the human being and uh I'm kind of
[8:41] trying to find a place to end it and
[8:43] move on but this just keeps opening up
[8:46] so this will be real simple today uh I
[8:49] believe everyone that's here can get a
[8:50] hold of something here because it would
[8:52] just make it real simple the scripture
[8:55] is simple this story is simple and yet
[8:57] we have to believe that our Lord is the
[8:59] same this morning here in this building
[9:02] as he was back then and that is he is
[9:04] able to set a man free that is so you
[9:07] realize now when it gave the number of
[9:09] the swine that all the demons went into
[9:12] uh that was quite a few swine and all
[9:14] the demons that went into all of those
[9:16] swine those pigs all of them were living
[9:20] in one man so that's quite a few demons
[9:23] to deal with that's quite a bit of
[9:25] Torment demon another word for demon is
[9:27] a Tormentor and that's quite a bit of
[9:30] Torment for one man to have living
[9:32] within him and so I want to I want to
[9:35] speak and elaborate on and just break
[9:37] down this story a little bit this
[9:38] morning and the first thing that we must
[9:41] understand from this is demons are
[9:45] real the devil is real and and and and
[9:48] you you wouldn't think you'd have to
[9:49] start out that basic but today you do
[9:52] because people don't believe that
[9:53] anymore they don't believe that there's
[9:55] another dimension with uh angels in that
[9:58] other dimension and there's another
[10:00] dimension with demons in those
[10:02] dimensions and so we don't see those
[10:04] with our naked eye today but
[10:06] nevertheless Christians know that it's
[10:07] true Christians know that it's true
[10:09] because the Bible said it that is our
[10:11] absolute but they know it's true because
[10:13] they know that we wrestle not against
[10:15] flesh and blood you can go have a fight
[10:18] a physical fight with somebody uh but
[10:20] you would never resolve their real
[10:21] problems or your real problems because
[10:23] there's another dimension we wrestle not
[10:26] against flesh and blood but against
[10:28] principalities and Powers poers and
[10:30] spiritual wickedness in high places
[10:32] Christians know that this is real not
[10:34] just because the Bible says it but but
[10:37] they know it's real because they're when
[10:38] they're trying to serve the Lord there's
[10:41] something fighting against them and so
[10:43] they know that it is true that there is
[10:45] real demons there is a real devil and he
[10:48] is real he's a person and uh the devil's
[10:51] trust is to try to keep a human being
[10:54] from the presence of the Lord why would
[10:56] he keep a human being from the presence
[10:58] of the Lord because then he can keep
[11:01] them tormented he can keep them bound
[11:04] and as long as they stay away from the
[11:06] presence of the Lord then he can keep
[11:09] them tormented because that is his
[11:10] agenda he wants a keep a person uh bound
[11:15] he wants to keep a person tormented
[11:18] agitated irritated never fully happy
[11:21] never never fully enjoying life always
[11:24] under either the guilt of of sin or
[11:27] under the guilt or maybe under
[11:29] condemnation but maybe it's not that
[11:31] maybe just Bound by something that they
[11:33] just can't get rid of a habit and
[11:35] they're just Bound by it Satan loves for
[11:37] people to stay bound I don't know why I
[11:40] I know that he knows what it means to be
[11:42] bound himself but he just that's the
[11:44] agitation he gives he doesn't like the
[11:48] human being to be set free he doesn't
[11:50] like a human being to be fully truly
[11:53] happy in Christ he doesn't want this
[11:56] full happiness and yet Satan sells his
[11:59] stuff by giving human beings what they
[12:02] they think is real happiness but I've
[12:04] been elaborating on this series to show
[12:06] you that when he presents his stuff it
[12:09] is temporal it seems to go back into
[12:12] things I've read you scientific things
[12:14] to show you that they have proved that
[12:16] even some of the helps that they have is
[12:18] only temporary it never deals to bring a
[12:22] person to complete happiness it never
[12:25] does that's because they haven't solved
[12:27] the thing that that when you come into
[12:29] the presence of the Lord that it's not
[12:31] just his word it's not just his laws
[12:33] that he gives but he actually has
[12:35] something greater for you and that he
[12:37] wants to set the human being free of any
[12:42] bondage he's so done his job to present
[12:45] things that the bondage is scripture and
[12:47] bondage is the law and bondage of the
[12:49] message and I I say I hate to credit
[12:51] Satan but he's done a a quite a job
[12:54] quite a decent job of convincing Minds
[12:57] that everything that God has has for us
[13:00] is to bring us in bondage that is
[13:02] terrible for him to present that because
[13:04] it's actually the biggest lie that you
[13:06] can tell a human being no there is no
[13:09] other full complete freedom and
[13:11] happiness for a human being than in
[13:14] Jesus Christ you see to me this morning
[13:17] I'll just drop in my personal testimony
[13:19] when I look at this Bible now and I
[13:21] thank God that I can look at it right
[13:23] because I've been through a lot of
[13:24] things that I could be influenced by
[13:26] something that taints this Bible and
[13:28] taints this presence and taints this
[13:30] message but somehow by his grace when I
[13:33] look at this when I look at the message
[13:36] when I look at being in the presence of
[13:37] the Lord when I look at all of this I
[13:40] don't see one ounce of
[13:43] bondage so maybe it's just how you're
[13:46] looking at it I can't get my mind
[13:47] wrapped around somebody concluding that
[13:50] way how could God send something God God
[13:55] our God our creator how could he be
[13:58] sending us something that would bring us
[14:01] under
[14:02] bondage maybe it's how you're
[14:04] interpreting it maybe it's how Satan
[14:06] interpreted all I know is there's enough
[14:09] scriptures and enough things that come
[14:10] from God that he wants us to be happy
[14:13] and free he wants us to be satisfied he
[14:17] wants us to be content can you say Amen
[14:19] but when you're dealing with demons uh
[14:22] it's a whole another realm because
[14:24] they're so subtle and they they don't
[14:26] look that and you know when you talk
[14:28] about de today uh Christ is the one that
[14:31] he's really the only one that can expose
[14:33] them or call them out they are so hidden
[14:36] and they're given different names today
[14:38] they're polished up they're watered down
[14:40] even the term demon is watered down I
[14:42] can't hardly use it we can't hardly use
[14:44] it because it's justo too scary for
[14:46] people it's it but but you see that term
[14:48] demons is not scary to a Believer why
[14:51] why is it not scary to a Believer
[14:54] because we have something
[14:57] greater otherwise wise it's scary
[15:00] otherwise it's overwhelming when I talk
[15:02] about it this morning it would be
[15:04] overwhelming to see that this power of
[15:06] the enemy has this much power over man
[15:08] that he's cutting himself that he's
[15:10] breaking through chains they can't hold
[15:12] him he's dwelling amongst the tombs he
[15:15] can't even be with his family anymore
[15:16] he's come to and I use this extreme
[15:19] scripture to show how far the devil can
[15:21] take you do you know that the only
[15:24] reason some people don't go that far in
[15:26] their torment is because they have
[15:28] chains maybe of psychology of certain
[15:31] things that hold them back from going
[15:33] all the way they had to put this man on
[15:35] the in these tombs and he dwell there
[15:37] because he was killing people and he was
[15:39] hurting people he was hurting his family
[15:41] and so sometimes you can restrain
[15:43] somebody but even his restraints even
[15:45] his restraints he'd break them off but
[15:48] he had to go somewhere this is an
[15:49] extreme case but he had to go somewhere
[15:51] to show us that how far the enemy wants
[15:54] to take somebody by being
[15:57] bound oh yeah but the worst case when
[16:01] they come in the presence of the Lord
[16:04] everything changes but God calls demons
[16:07] for what they are people get offended
[16:09] when you label something demon
[16:10] possession oh my uh it's not a
[16:12] possession it's just a problem well some
[16:15] problems have demons behind it some
[16:17] don't but you have to really pray to
[16:19] find out you don't want to be stepping
[16:20] out saying you got a demon be careful
[16:22] you tell your teenager you got a demon
[16:24] be careful uh you better make sure of
[16:26] that
[16:29] I didn't expect to say some of this this
[16:30] morning but listen you better be careful
[16:33] what you're saying and and seek the Lord
[16:35] can you say amen amen but sometimes we
[16:39] know the reality of somebody being
[16:41] becoming demon possessed and uh that is
[16:44] a term also that doesn't like so it's
[16:46] just a problem well find out if it's
[16:48] just a problem or find out if it's a
[16:50] demon you have to find out but I just
[16:52] want to you notice about this now until
[16:54] the son of man came there was really no
[16:57] power for this man there was no power
[17:00] big enough or great enough for these
[17:02] demons until the son of man came and he
[17:05] came I want you to notice something in
[17:07] the scripture he did not go into the
[17:09] graveyard he did not go into the tombs
[17:12] he did did does not dwell there as such
[17:15] but he put himself in a place that was
[17:17] close enough took a boat across had to
[17:20] stop by here this certain Mountain he
[17:22] gets across and I don't know he got gets
[17:25] out on the beach or whatever but he puts
[17:27] himself himself Within High distance of
[17:30] this man that was possessed he doesn't
[17:32] dwell amongst the tomb Jesus does not
[17:34] dwell amongst the
[17:37] dead and so if you notice the story he
[17:40] puts himself so this man can see Jesus a
[17:44] far off but he does Place himself where
[17:47] they he can see Jesus and when he sees
[17:50] Jesus he has to come away and quit
[17:53] hanging around the dead and get where
[17:56] Jesus is you have to make a move to quit
[17:59] hanging around places where demons can
[18:02] just keep
[18:04] tormenting I want help I want help I got
[18:06] this i got this i got this do you really
[18:09] want to be free do you really want help
[18:12] and this man had to run out of the
[18:15] graveyard out of the atmosphere he was
[18:17] in because he was hanging around the
[18:20] wrong atmosphere for him to be free if
[18:23] you really really want to be free then
[18:25] you've got to stop hanging around the
[18:28] wrong atmospheres the wrong people you
[18:31] got to stop hang stop hanging around the
[18:33] wrong atmosphere you got to stop feeding
[18:35] on the wrong
[18:36] things for two reasons it's not good for
[18:39] you but if you have demons and things
[18:41] that are tormenting you and you say I
[18:43] want to be free there's no way that
[18:45] Jesus can do that when you stay in the
[18:47] atmospheres you're in there has to be a
[18:50] movement for you to move towards Christ
[18:53] and get in his presence now that man did
[18:55] not deliver himself he had no power to
[18:57] deliver himself but once he got into the
[19:00] presence of Christ then something could
[19:04] be
[19:05] done and there's only one power great
[19:08] enough it is the son of man that that
[19:10] that until he came there was really no
[19:13] power over the demons how many would
[19:15] agree with me that whatever he did here
[19:18] to this man he's in the building this
[19:20] morning and he's able to do it
[19:23] again or he's not God he can either do
[19:26] this again or he's not God and the
[19:28] message came came to prove to us he can
[19:30] do it
[19:31] again he can do it again he's living the
[19:34] son of man is living he's present among
[19:36] us today and so but you see now one
[19:38] thing is it is never it it never lets
[19:42] demons feel comfortable it exposes
[19:46] them when you come into the presence of
[19:49] the Lord there's a characteristic of his
[19:52] presence and that he'll never let the
[19:54] demons be
[19:56] comfortable it exposes them Satan hates
[20:00] this Revelation in that people become
[20:02] free in this Revelation and it has power
[20:06] this word has power to kick the devil
[20:10] out I just want to mention something
[20:11] about the devil's history and I and I'm
[20:13] going to conclude by saying this that
[20:16] every we need to know that we have power
[20:19] through Christ into his name to kick the
[20:21] devil
[20:23] out he gave power over the
[20:26] church to cast out devils
[20:29] not because of us but he gave us power
[20:32] so so I I would just say kick him out
[20:35] because when you go into the devil's
[20:38] history he was kicked out of heaven
[20:41] before we even come along he was kicked
[20:43] out of
[20:44] heaven with a third of the
[20:46] angels He was kicked out of the Garden
[20:49] of
[20:50] Eden he was kicked out of the camp when
[20:54] ishmail came along cast out the Bond
[20:57] woman and her son he he was kicked out
[20:59] of the camp in Exodus and Deuteronomy it
[21:02] says I will cast out the nations from
[21:05] before thee and then he says I will cast
[21:07] out the enemy for thee David said I will
[21:11] cast out the Heathen be from before thee
[21:14] and so you have this whole history of
[21:16] the Enemy being kicked out from the very
[21:20] beginning he was kicked out Proverbs 22
[21:22] says cast out the scorner I want
[21:25] everybody to listen to this uh Home
[21:27] Folks and and
[21:29] local people you know like that are part
[21:32] of a local body this says cast out the
[21:34] scorner and contention shall go away
[21:37] because it's the scorner and it's the
[21:40] one just keeps finding things to be
[21:42] critical of that brings contention in
[21:44] the body cast out the scorner and
[21:47] contention shall go out ye strife and
[21:50] reproach shall cease Ma I was just
[21:52] adding that one in Proverbs 22:10
[21:54] Matthew 18:16 when we get to the New
[21:56] Testament when the even was come they
[21:59] brought unto him many that were
[22:00] possessed with devils and he cast out
[22:02] the spirits with his word and healed all
[22:05] that were sick Matthew 20 excuse me
[22:07] Matthew 12:28 but if I cast out Devils
[22:10] interesting thing that what Jesus says
[22:13] if I cast out Devils by the spirit of
[22:15] God then the kingdom of God is come nigh
[22:19] unto you how do we know the kingdom of
[22:21] God has come nigh because it's casting
[22:24] out devils in Luke 11:20 he words it
[22:27] this way he he says I if I cast out
[22:30] Devils by the Finger of God then you
[22:34] know that the kingdom of God is at
[22:38] hand you ever notice he says I'm casting
[22:42] out Devils just with the Finger of God
[22:46] if his finger has that much power how
[22:49] much does the rest of the body of Christ
[22:53] have then he gave his church commission
[22:55] to cast out devils and they were kicking
[22:57] him out throughout history the devil has
[22:59] been kicked out kicked out kicked out of
[23:02] heaven at the beginning kicked out the
[23:04] church kicked him out they had power to
[23:06] kick him out and look what his final end
[23:08] is Revelations 12:7 there was war in
[23:10] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[23:12] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[23:14] against his angels and prevailed not
[23:16] neither was their place found anymore in
[23:18] heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out
[23:20] that old serpent called the devil and
[23:23] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[23:25] was cast out into the Earth and his
[23:27] angels were cast out with him and I
[23:29] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[23:32] has come salvation and strength and the
[23:34] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[23:37] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[23:40] is cast down he's finally been
[23:43] ultimately cast
[23:45] out and he accused them before God day
[23:47] and night and they overcame him by the
[23:50] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[23:52] their testimony and now here's the
[23:53] prophecy that one day he'll be
[23:55] completely kicked out he was kicked out
[23:57] at the beginning he's been kicked out
[23:59] all through the Bible and he's going to
[24:01] be kicked out at the end I say if that's
[24:03] his history and that's his future why
[24:06] can't you give him the boot every now
[24:08] and
[24:09] then kick him out he's used to
[24:14] it kick him out of your home kick him
[24:17] out of your spirit kick him out of your
[24:19] attitude kick him out of your
[24:24] life he's used to it he don't like it
[24:28] but that's his history and that's his
[24:31] future giving the boo now dwelling among
[24:35] the tombs this is where this man was
[24:38] this is where people hang out with
[24:40] demons you can't hang out with the wrong
[24:43] C crowd in dead spiritual people and
[24:46] think right if you're around dead
[24:47] spiritual people you can't think right
[24:50] if you want to be free the first step is
[24:52] to get away from stuff and people that
[24:55] do and say stupid things this world is
[24:58] making things more insane it's an insane
[25:01] world and and we find that even amongst
[25:05] Christian churches Things become a bit
[25:09] insane I only say that because it's not
[25:11] sound gospel anymore it's not sound
[25:14] thinking
[25:16] anymore it's not sound Doctrine anymore
[25:20] so you can't hang around the wrong stuff
[25:22] and the wrong people that are saying
[25:24] stupid things you are not stupid but if
[25:26] you hang around them you will think
[25:28] stupid things it's it's true this all
[25:31] started with thinking process how did
[25:34] the man get you don't start being having
[25:37] a legion of demons within you you don't
[25:39] start that way it's when he W he become
[25:43] out of his right mind in other words he
[25:45] wasn't thinking right and Satan attacked
[25:48] his thoughts and he started to buy into
[25:51] that that's only goes One Direction and
[25:54] when he was delivered he sat there calm
[25:57] clothed
[25:59] and in his right mind what you hang
[26:01] around what you feed on if you want to
[26:05] be free of those things your proof that
[26:07] you want to be free is when Jesus is
[26:10] Calling you make a move towards
[26:13] him you have to come his way that's
[26:17] right and once you start coming you
[26:19] don't have to deliver yourself you don't
[26:20] have to deal with your problems yourself
[26:22] but you can't stay where Jesus is not
[26:26] and he's not amongst the Dead
[26:29] he's not amongst things that are dead
[26:31] he's not amongst thoughts that are dead
[26:33] or thoughts that are not clear sound
[26:35] thinking he's not there you have to come
[26:37] away from that this applies to every
[26:39] Christian this morning every unbeliever
[26:41] no matter I think this message is simple
[26:44] to apply to everyone the question is do
[26:46] you want to be free and if you want to
[26:47] be free you have to you have to come
[26:50] away I can preach about the freedom in
[26:53] Jesus Christ for weeks but if people
[26:56] aren't willing to change their life and
[26:58] come
[27:00] away from dead things you can't get
[27:03] anywhere for him to speak the word and
[27:06] all he has to do is speak it and that
[27:08] Demon's
[27:09] gone that torment that thing that's
[27:13] that's irritating me all it takes is
[27:15] just one more Jesus it's leave in Jesus
[27:19] name amen that's the atmosphere I want
[27:21] to be in and that's the kind of person I
[27:24] want to be as when the tormentors are
[27:29] afraid of what I have inside me they're
[27:32] afraid of me I think everybody here can
[27:35] find something this morning that was
[27:37] said that was truth I want I'm not going
[27:39] to be so arrogant to say that it's that
[27:41] it's all truth I I I I believe but it's
[27:44] not that I say it if it's the word it is
[27:47] the truth and the truth shall make you
[27:49] free and even if you can acknowledge
[27:51] that some of it Lord that would would be
[27:54] something that the Lord said and
[27:55] something for you for you even if you
[27:58] acknowledge that I'd go ahead and do it
[28:00] I'd go ahead and do it I would I would
[28:02] if you see Jesus a far off today I would
[28:05] run towards him I wouldn't run away from
[28:07] him thank you for watching our message
