[41:46] Amen. So, I I hope you're coming to hear
[41:48] from him tonight. Amen. Normally, uh
[41:53] when I preach, I try to preach in
[41:56] reality.
[41:57] I try to preach in real time like right
[42:00] now because I believe God is a God of

[42:37] thankful for his goodness. Amen.
[42:41] Appreciate my family that's come up with
[42:43] me. Amen. Let's just pray. Lord Jesus,
[42:46] Father, you are truly our all in all.
[42:49] And Lord, it's in times like these where
[42:51] we need a savior. Lord, we can see all
[42:54] the things that are taking place
[42:56] according to prophecy, according to
[42:58] Lord, what was spoken
[43:01] under the inspiration of the divine
[43:04] prophet, Lord. Lord God, and we're here.
[43:06] We're looking at, Lord, but we are a
[43:09] part of the fulfillment of that
[43:10] prophecy, young and old, Lord. There's a
[43:13] part for each and every one of us to
[43:15] play. So Lord, help us to play our part,
[43:18] Lord, that's already been seen, already
[43:20] been known in heaven, in your mind, and
[43:23] we're playing our role out on this
[43:25] earth. So Lord, we pray that the
[43:27] blessings of the kingdom be upon your
[43:29] people,
[43:30] Lord. Use the gift for your glory, Lord,
[43:33] and in hearing that people may
[43:35] understand, Lord, and see what the
[43:37] spirit of God is saying, Lord. And we
[43:39] thank you in the wonderful name of Jesus
[43:42] Christ, we pray. Let church say, "Amen."
[43:44] Amen.
[43:45] Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's go
[43:47] to Judges chapter 6.
[43:50] Judges chapter 6, and then we're going
[43:52] to go to uh Esther chapter 4.
[43:57] I want Judges chapter 6 and then Esther
[44:00] chapter 4. We're going to read a uh
[44:03] familiar verse of scripture out of
[44:06] Judges chapter 6
[44:12] verse 11.
[44:19] You have to say amen.
[44:21] The Bible says, "And there came an angel
[44:23] of the Lord and set under an oak which
[44:26] was called Ofra
[44:28] that pertained unto Joash the Aszite,
[44:33] and his son Gideon thresh wheat by the
[44:37] wine press to hide it from the Midians."
[44:42] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[44:44] him, and said unto him, "The Lord is
[44:47] with thee, thou mighty man of valor."
[44:51] Amen. Let's go to Esther chapter 4.
[44:57] Esther chapter 4. Let's start at verse
[45:00] 13. We're probably going to come back to
[45:03] Esther,
[45:05] but let's just start at verse 13.
[45:18] Praise the Lord.
[45:22] Esther 4:13, the Bible says, "Then Mori
[45:26] commanded
[45:27] to answer Esther, think not with thyself
[45:30] that thou shalt escape in the king's
[45:32] house more than all the Jews. For if
[45:35] thou altogether holdest thy peace at
[45:39] this time, then shall their enlargement
[45:42] and deliverance arise to the Jews from
[45:44] another place. But thou and thy father's
[45:47] house shall be destroyed, and whom and
[45:50] who knoweth whether thou come to the
[45:53] kingdom for such a time as this.
[45:57] Amen. May the Lord add a bless to the
[45:59] reading of his word. You can have your
[46:01] seats
[46:04] today by the grace of God. And and we
[46:06] always say this, but you control it. You
[46:09] preach. I mean, I preach. We all preach.
[46:14] Amen. I preach, you pull. Amen. And and
[46:17] and that's how it works. Amen. So, if
[46:19] you want something from God, you got to
[46:21] pull on the gift tonight. Hallelujah.
[46:24] You know, one one thing about God, he's
[46:26] not restricted to an age limit.
[46:29] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. He's not
[46:32] restricted to an age limit. So that mean
[46:34] that everybody in here tonight can get
[46:36] something from God. Hallelujah. And I
[46:39] and I challenge the adults. Don't think
[46:42] as a youth service, but think of it as a
[46:45] service from God. Amen. And if you got
[46:47] needs, why don't you challenge the Lord
[46:49] and say, "Lord, speak to me." Amen. But
[46:52] tonight, by the grace of God, my my
[46:54] subject is conquerors of fear. Amen.
[46:58] And you know, I I believe fear is
[47:00] something that I'm going to be preaching
[47:02] on until I get out of here. Because when
[47:04] we when I speak to my my young people,
[47:07] my brothers and sisters in the Lord, one
[47:09] thing I realize that a lot of times the
[47:12] young people are not where they are
[47:14] because of fear, because of certain
[47:17] things in their lives, things that
[47:19] they're afraid of, things that they're
[47:21] ashamed of, things that they think they
[47:23] might fail. Hallelujah. And and normally
[47:26] all these things are tied into fear. But
[47:29] I want to show you in the scriptures
[47:31] that God hallelujah can use your fear to
[47:34] show you how great he is. And that a lot
[47:37] of times in moments where we are most
[47:39] fearful, that's when God shows up. So I
[47:43] want you to understand tonight, if
[47:44] there's anything you're afraid of, God
[47:47] already knows. But will you allow God to
[47:50] use you? Hallelujah. uh uh instead of
[47:54] your fears. Amen. And you know, I I'm
[47:56] I'm I'm kind of in shotgun mode, so just
[47:59] let me go. Hallelujah. You know, right
[48:01] here when we're reading in the in the in
[48:03] the book of Judges with Gideon, you
[48:05] know, Gideon wasn't looking for an angel
[48:07] to come and talk to him. He was afraid.
[48:11] He was afraid of what was taking place
[48:14] in his land, in his home. He was afraid.
[48:18] The Bible says he was hiding behind the
[48:20] the wine press. He was afraid. And in
[48:23] the moment, hallelujah, of his greatest
[48:25] fears, God came down. Hallelujah. In the
[48:30] time you may be the most afraid of
[48:32] failure, that's when God can use you.
[48:36] Hallelujah. And in this moment where he
[48:38] was so afraid and the angel came down
[48:41] and said to him, "Hallelujah. You're
[48:44] looking at yourself wrong."
[48:47] Hallelujah. You're looking at this
[48:49] situation wrong. He said, "Amen." He
[48:51] said, "Hell Gideon, thou mighty man of
[48:55] valor,
[48:57] even though you're afraid." Hallelujah.
[48:59] I'm going to tell you, you're a
[49:01] conqueror.
[49:04] Hallelujah.
[49:05] You're not a scaredy-cat. That's not a
[49:07] southern word, is it?
[49:10] Hallelujah. You're not a scaredy-cat,
[49:12] but you in the eyes of God, you are a
[49:15] mighty man of valor. Amen.
[49:20] Tonight, my
[49:23] my inspiration or my subtitle is kings
[49:27] and queens. Hallelujah. I want you young
[49:31] brothers to realize that you are a king
[49:34] in God's kingdom. I want you young
[49:36] sisters to realize you are a queen in
[49:39] God's kingdom. So there's no reason for
[49:42] you to be afraid because a king in his
[49:44] kingdom, he's not afraid of anybody. and
[49:48] a queen in her kingdom. She's not afraid
[49:50] of anybody. Why? Because they have
[49:53] dominion over everything.
[49:55] And I want you to understand, God chose
[49:58] you to be a conqueror.
[50:01] Amen. And not be afraid.
[50:04] Hallelujah. But a lot of time as young
[50:07] people, we look or or or people in
[50:10] general, we look at our insufficiencies.
[50:13] And I got to get my pronunciations and
[50:15] my words right cuz my family will remind
[50:18] me of what I said.
[50:22] So in this moment, hallelujah, Gideon,
[50:26] the angel comes and tells him, "You're a
[50:29] mighty man of valor." And he's behind
[50:31] the wine press like this. Oh, the enem
[50:33] is here again. And I got to Oh, we not
[50:36] going to have any more food. They're
[50:37] going to take out our wheat. And the
[50:39] angel comes and say, "Look up. Stand up.
[50:43] You're a mighty man of valor. And I'm
[50:45] going to use you to Oh, parents, don't
[50:49] get mad at me. I'm going to use you to
[50:52] destroy what your father couldn't do.
[50:58] [Music]
[51:00] He said, "I'm going to use you, Gideon,
[51:02] to go and tear down the groves that your
[51:05] your your father's generation allowed to
[51:08] stay in church and linger around. I'm
[51:10] going to use you." Hallelujah. with a
[51:12] more pure heart, with a more vengeance
[51:14] of faith to destroy the enemy. You're
[51:17] going to be a conqueror of fears.
[51:21] And I want you young people to say to
[51:23] understand that in this day, in this
[51:25] time, God wants to use you. Hallelujah.
[51:29] He wants to use you. Amen. To do things
[51:32] that maybe the other generations
[51:34] couldn't do. Hallelujah. But first, you
[51:38] got to get rid of your fears. Ask
[51:40] yourself, what am I afraid of? My my my
[51:44] what am I afraid of? Look, look, church,
[51:47] uh one one person I love to use when it
[51:49] comes to talking about fears is David.
[51:54] Because when you think of David, David
[51:57] was anointed at a time. Hallelujah.
[52:00] There was going to come a time when a
[52:03] battle was going to rise and no matter
[52:06] how spiritual everybody was, nobody was
[52:09] going to meet the challenge.
[52:12] People been around for wars and rumors
[52:15] of wars. They've been around for
[52:17] prophecies and all these things. But
[52:19] this battle to come is going to take a
[52:21] special anointing. Hallelujah. this
[52:24] battle to come is going to take somebody
[52:26] who knows their God. It's going to take
[52:29] somebody who's not afraid, hallelujah,
[52:32] of the things that they can't control.
[52:35] Hallelujah. In this time of battle,
[52:38] Amen. And what I love about the story of
[52:40] David. Hallelujah. Samuel the prophet
[52:43] went down to Jesse's house to anoint a a
[52:46] a king.
[52:49] And everybody that came to be anointed
[52:51] was not chosen. But they were called.
[52:57] Hallelujah. They were called, but they
[53:00] weren't chosen. Amen. They were there.
[53:02] They were They were there to to be
[53:04] partakers of it, but they weren't
[53:06] chosen. They were there to see who was
[53:09] bringing the anointing. They were there
[53:11] to see what was about to take place, but
[53:13] they weren't chosen for it to happen to
[53:15] them. Hallelujah. And I want you all you
[53:18] young people and all of us in here
[53:20] tonight. Hallelujah. Many are called,
[53:22] but few are chosen. Hallelujah. A lot of
[53:26] people been called to intermingle with
[53:28] this this message of the hour, young and
[53:31] old. But have they been chosen? If you
[53:34] are chosen, God will equip you for the
[53:37] battle to come. And you don't have to
[53:39] fear.
[53:43] Hallelujah. You don't have to fear
[53:46] because what God will do, he'll give you
[53:48] experience. experiences to conquer. Good
[53:52] to see you, Francis. He'll give you
[53:54] experiences to conquer your fears.
[53:56] Hallelujah. So, what does he do? Before
[54:00] David was even anointed, God was dealing
[54:02] with his fears.
[54:07] So, could it be tonight God is trying to
[54:10] deal with your fears because he got a
[54:13] work for you to do? Maybe he got
[54:15] somebody for you to witness to. Maybe
[54:18] it's somebody in your family.
[54:19] Hallelujah. Maybe God want to give you
[54:21] the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. So that
[54:23] somebody can see that it's real.
[54:27] Hallelujah. Cuz a lot of times what
[54:29] people do, they will refer to the lack
[54:32] or the doubt versus the truth.
[54:36] Well, if the message was so true, why
[54:38] all them people didn't left? You know
[54:40] what you ought to say? But I'm still
[54:42] here.
[54:45] That's what you ought to say.
[54:46] Hallelujah. Yeah, they left, but I'm
[54:48] still here. and say, "Well, the prophet
[54:50] missed this and he missed that." It
[54:51] don't matter, but I met Jesus.
[54:54] Hallelujah. He's become real to me.
[54:56] Hallelujah. This message has helped
[54:57] change my life. God is real. And I don't
[55:00] have to be afraid to stand on the truth.
[55:04] Hallelujah. But I look, church, and and
[55:06] I and I think about David and David,
[55:08] hallelujah, he wasn't even looking for
[55:13] God
[55:16] as a young man. He was just being
[55:17] obedient to his parents. Hallelujah. And
[55:20] as he was being obedient, God say, "You
[55:22] know what? I'm going to choose a man out
[55:24] of my very own heart." Because Saul,
[55:27] even though he was king, he was
[55:29] operating under fear.
[55:33] And he couldn't conquer his fears.
[55:37] But David, hallelujah, anointed by the
[55:41] same messenger,
[55:44] David comes. Hallelujah. He's out there
[55:48] tending to the sheep and one day a bear
[55:50] comes and David deals with the bear,
[55:52] destroys it. One day a lion comes and
[55:55] David deals with the lion, destroys it.
[55:57] Just that simple. You know what he does?
[55:59] He doesn't go back to church and say, "I
[56:00] got a testimony service." He just let it
[56:03] be what it is. Hallelujah. You don't
[56:06] have to be something in our eyes.
[56:08] Hallelujah. Just just just make sure
[56:11] that whatever God is doing in your
[56:13] closet, whatever God is doing in your
[56:15] secret time, just make sure it's
[56:17] something real. Hallelujah. Because you
[56:21] on your own personal stage is going to
[56:24] have to see whether it's truth or not.
[56:27] Hallelujah. Because a greater test will
[56:29] come. And here comes David. David,
[56:32] hallelujah, dealt with the bear, dealt
[56:34] with the lion. Hallelujah. And then all
[56:36] of a sudden the prophet comes down to
[56:38] hallelujah look for a king. David's
[56:41] minding his business. Y'all know I like
[56:44] saying this cuz I love the story of
[56:45] David. David wasn't even invited.
[56:53] He wasn't even invited.
[56:57] How much more should we take advantage
[57:00] of what's taking place around us because
[57:02] we've been invited?
[57:04] Hallelujah. We call it a tri-state
[57:06] meeting. We've been invited. We've been
[57:09] invited to hear from God. Hallelujah.
[57:11] And now that you here, what are you
[57:13] going to do about it? Let me tell you
[57:15] something. Salvation is not you living
[57:18] in your own world, minding your own
[57:19] business, and saying, "God loves me."
[57:23] No. Salvation is being a witness.
[57:26] Hallelujah. I'm not saying having a
[57:28] Bible in your hand, walking around
[57:30] saying, "God did this for me. God did
[57:32] that for me. I'm the voice of the one
[57:33] crying out in the wilderness. But does
[57:35] your heart yield and yearn to talk about
[57:38] Jesus?
[57:41] When you young people are with your
[57:43] friends, hallelujah, is is is social
[57:46] media. Hallelujah. More prevalent or
[57:48] revalent than God.
[57:53] You know, you get together and say,
[57:54] "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, did y'all see
[57:56] uh did y'all see Kai on streaming
[57:58] University?
[58:00] Did you did you did you see all these
[58:02] different streamers and did you see Mr.
[58:04] Beast and I show speed and all these
[58:06] guys? Did you see it?
[58:08] You know, easy to see you adults don't
[58:10] know what I'm talking about, but the
[58:11] kids do
[58:14] hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know, my son
[58:17] my son used to ask me sometimes and this
[58:19] just me. Don't you try this. This this
[58:21] just me what I used to do when my kids
[58:23] were younger. Hallelujah. The things I
[58:25] felt like that would get next to them,
[58:27] I'd go back and study it.
[58:30] So I I I listen to the popular songs
[58:32] that were out that time and I still do
[58:35] sometimes because I had to deal with
[58:36] young people. I know all about Glorilla.
[58:41] Hallelujah. I know all about some of
[58:44] these things that are taking place
[58:46] because I look into it to see what kind
[58:48] of spirit is behind it. Hallelujah. And
[58:51] you know a while back it used to be
[58:53] Taylor Swift and different ones and you
[58:55] know and one thing about Taylor but one
[58:57] thing about Taylor that people don't
[58:59] understand in her music what she was
[59:01] doing was selling sex.
[59:05] Cuz she write a song about her
[59:07] relationships and tell about how she's
[59:10] moved on with another guy.
[59:14] That's no more hallelujah than a Barbie
[59:17] doll.
[59:21] Don't buy your daughter's Barbie dolls.
[59:22] Barbie got the spirit of whoredom on it.
[59:29] Pay attention to what's going on in the
[59:31] spirit realm. Swimsuit Barbie, disco
[59:34] Barbie, Corvette Barbie,
[59:37] and your little girl watching this image
[59:39] and she want to be swimsuit Emma,
[59:41] swimsuit this and swimsuit that.
[59:44] I'm sorry. Sorry, I don't mean to call
[59:45] no names, but you you you you got to be
[59:49] paying attention because exactly there's
[59:52] a realm of conquering that we need to
[59:54] operate in. Hallelujah. We need to pay
[59:57] attention that there are spiritual
[59:58] things taking place right now in this
[1:00:00] room. Why am I preaching on fear?
[1:00:02] Because some of you are afraid to move
[1:00:05] on with God.
[1:00:07] Hallelujah. You've been in church in
[1:00:09] this church. You've been in church at
[1:00:11] your house. You've been in church, but
[1:00:13] now that you're in church, what you
[1:00:15] going to do about it? Hallelujah. What
[1:00:18] if God was to come meet you in the
[1:00:21] moment of your fears? What would you do?
[1:00:25] Look what Gideon did. Oh my, I feel the
[1:00:27] Holy Spirit moving. Look what Gideon
[1:00:30] did. He said, "If this is God, if this
[1:00:32] is the Lord, where be all the miracles?"
[1:00:36] So, you know what God did? God took him
[1:00:38] on a journey. Hallelujah. God took him
[1:00:41] on a journey that began to show him,
[1:00:43] "It's not by your might or by your
[1:00:45] strength, but it's by my spirit."
[1:00:48] Hallelujah. He made him the head of an
[1:00:50] army. And Gideon thought, I got to have
[1:00:53] so many people to fight with. And God
[1:00:55] said, "No, we going to narrow it down.
[1:00:57] We going to make it look impossible. I'm
[1:00:59] going to deal with your fear."
[1:01:03] Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] Hallelujah.
[1:01:06] I feel like right now, Brother Paul,
[1:01:09] we're in a horror picture. And some of
[1:01:12] you have fears and you're trying to hold
[1:01:14] on to them cuz you're afraid of what's
[1:01:17] going to happen if you let go. I'll tell
[1:01:18] you, if you hold on to your fear, you
[1:01:20] will die.
[1:01:23] Hallelujah. You ever seen a person who's
[1:01:26] brave and and and and not afraid to
[1:01:30] fight back, be the first one to get
[1:01:31] killed? Normally it's the people who's
[1:01:33] running
[1:01:35] fall down next thing you know chop.
[1:01:39] We're not here to run. God is on our
[1:01:42] side. Hallelujah. Don't run. Hallelujah.
[1:01:46] From your this word that is is is
[1:01:48] traveling around and it's it seems like
[1:01:50] it's non-stop. Hallelujah. Why was
[1:01:52] Gideon hiding is what we call today his
[1:01:56] anxiety?
[1:02:02] We've made fear, we've normalized it.
[1:02:05] Hallelujah. Oh my. We go we we we we we
[1:02:10] let our kids, our family members,
[1:02:12] different ones, go to the doctor and get
[1:02:14] Hallelujah. diagnosis and prescriptions
[1:02:18] for anxiety.
[1:02:21] I'll tell you the prescription for
[1:02:23] anxiety.
[1:02:25] Faith in Jesus. Amen.
[1:02:28] Hallelujah.
[1:02:30] Faith in Jesus will destroy your fears.
[1:02:33] Hallelujah. And I know you may have come
[1:02:35] to church tonight not expecting to for
[1:02:38] someone to be just direct. Hallelujah.
[1:02:41] Talk to you where you are. What's going
[1:02:43] on in your mind? What's happening in
[1:02:45] your spirit? Are you afraid to really
[1:02:47] give God that released? Gideon was.
[1:02:52] But God said, "Hey, you a mighty man of
[1:02:53] valor, and I'm going to make you the
[1:02:55] head of this army. First thing I want
[1:02:57] you to do is go down, go back to your
[1:02:59] daddy's house and tear down all them
[1:03:00] images.
[1:03:05] Let me say this, and I'm not being
[1:03:07] disrespectful." Hallelujah.
[1:03:11] To all of us, young or old,
[1:03:15] follow God than rather follow your loved
[1:03:18] ones.
[1:03:20] Hallelujah. Because I've seen loyalty to
[1:03:23] a default. I've seen young people,
[1:03:26] hallelujah, who are loyal to their
[1:03:28] parents and they follow their parents
[1:03:30] right into idolatry.
[1:03:33] Hallelujah. I've seen family members
[1:03:36] loyal to one another and they follow
[1:03:38] each other right out of truth.
[1:03:40] Hallelujah. We don't want that kind of
[1:03:43] loyalty. We want loyalty to God
[1:03:47] so I can love you. Hallelujah. But I
[1:03:49] can't serve you.
[1:03:54] Hallelujah.
[1:03:57] So if your brother get off, keep going
[1:03:59] with God. If your mama get off, keep
[1:04:01] going with God. If your daddy get off,
[1:04:03] keep going with God. If your cousin, if
[1:04:06] your best friend get off, keep going
[1:04:09] with God. Don't be afraid to stand out
[1:04:11] there on your own. You may be a king or
[1:04:14] a queen.
[1:04:18] Talk to me, church.
[1:04:20] Hallelujah. Loyal to a default.
[1:04:27] I know a brother one time, he was
[1:04:28] leaving a church. Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] And I just couldn't take it. I had to go
[1:04:34] talk to him. Not because of
[1:04:37] uh
[1:04:39] anything personal. Well, it was kind of
[1:04:41] personal, but personal because I felt
[1:04:44] like he was making a bad decision for
[1:04:47] his family.
[1:04:50] Hallelujah. And what a selfish way to be
[1:04:52] fathers.
[1:04:55] You got to ought with the ministry. You
[1:04:58] got to al with somebody in the church
[1:05:00] and you going to drag your whole family
[1:05:02] away because of your fears.
[1:05:07] Oh my. And you know what the kids do?
[1:05:10] because they are faithful and they're
[1:05:11] loyal. They follow right along.
[1:05:15] But what you ought to do, you ought to
[1:05:16] step back, look at your family now that
[1:05:18] you've made the decision and see how
[1:05:20] much they've grown in Christ because
[1:05:23] that'll be the truth of whether you made
[1:05:24] the right decision or not. Hallelujah.
[1:05:27] And I've seen it church, hallelujah, a
[1:05:29] brother, a friend of mine, amen, still
[1:05:30] love them like him to this day.
[1:05:32] Hallelujah. I've seen his kids grow in
[1:05:34] God. They were in an atmosphere in a
[1:05:35] good church where they gift start to
[1:05:37] come out and all these things. And then
[1:05:39] he benefit, you know what? I think I'm
[1:05:41] going to leave. I think I'm going to go
[1:05:42] here. I want to And you know, we get
[1:05:43] super spiritual. I want to do more for
[1:05:45] the Lord.
[1:05:47] And you ain't even doing nothing in the
[1:05:49] church you in.
[1:05:54] You ain't doing nothing at the church
[1:05:56] you at. Then sat there five, six years.
[1:05:58] And now you talking about I'm leaving
[1:05:59] cuz I want to do more.
[1:06:06] I know y'all think this supposed to be a
[1:06:08] tri state meeting. It is.
[1:06:11] But I'm still brother D. Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] Hallelujah. But look, I seen him step
[1:06:16] away and his kids follow. And I asked
[1:06:18] him, I said, "Well, God leading you to
[1:06:19] do this. What about your boys? What
[1:06:22] about your children?" He said, "Well, I
[1:06:23] told them they can do whatever they want
[1:06:25] to do." I'm like, "Man, please."
[1:06:27] You know, because they're loyal, they're
[1:06:29] going to follow you. You're their dad.
[1:06:31] You're that you are the image of God to
[1:06:33] him.
[1:06:37] Oh my. Well, we ought to be in this time
[1:06:40] because it's so crucial. We are in such
[1:06:42] the last days. Everything is taking
[1:06:44] place. You got to make sure. We got to
[1:06:46] make sure. All of us got to make sure
[1:06:48] that we get to Christ.
[1:06:52] Hallelujah. That's the goal. Get to
[1:06:55] Christ.
[1:06:56] Hallelujah. It's not about us following
[1:06:59] brother Brennham. It's about following
[1:07:02] Christ.
[1:07:04] Hallelujah. Because that's who he
[1:07:06] followed. Christ. And once I get to
[1:07:09] Christ, everything about Brother Brenam
[1:07:11] will fall in place.
[1:07:16] Hallelujah. Young people, I want to tell
[1:07:18] you, you have a place in the church
[1:07:20] ages. You have a place in the seal book.
[1:07:26] Hallelujah. You have a personal angel
[1:07:29] yourself,
[1:07:33] but you got to conquer your fears.
[1:07:36] Hallelujah.
[1:07:38] Oh my. But look,
[1:07:42] Gideon goes back and tear down
[1:07:43] everything. Hallelujah. And everybody
[1:07:46] get upset, you know. But the Lord says,
[1:07:50] "You keep going. I chose you for this.
[1:07:54] Deal with your fears. Now, I ain't
[1:07:55] telling you go be a re a rebel. Go home
[1:07:58] and tell your mama. You brother D told
[1:08:00] me to tell you shut up.
[1:08:04] No, I ain't say that. Don't put words in
[1:08:07] my mouth.
[1:08:08] What I'm saying is get to God in such a
[1:08:13] way that you will know when he's leading
[1:08:17] you.
[1:08:19] And you can make that walk. You can make
[1:08:22] that step with no fear.
[1:08:24] Hallelujah. Oh, you you you don't care.
[1:08:28] Brother Homo was Brother Homo was
[1:08:30] dropping some bombs this morning. He was
[1:08:31] saying, "You don't agree with that? I
[1:08:32] don't care."
[1:08:35] Hallelujah. Why? Because he's
[1:08:37] comfortable in his own skin.
[1:08:40] Hallelujah. And one thing I can say, and
[1:08:43] I'm sure you can agree with, I am
[1:08:45] comfortable in my own skin because I
[1:08:49] know where I come from. I know what
[1:08:50] God's done for me. And each and every
[1:08:52] one of us have to get to that point
[1:08:54] where we know God personally.
[1:08:57] Hallelujah. You know, hallelujah. When
[1:08:59] we when we go take trips, me and my
[1:09:02] family. Hallelujah. There's a thing
[1:09:04] called TSA.
[1:09:06] Hallelujah. Now, I got this thing on
[1:09:08] mine where I got pre-check,
[1:09:11] but most of them ain't got it cuz they
[1:09:13] don't travel as much as me. But even
[1:09:15] though they my family, I tell them, I'm
[1:09:18] gonna meet y'all around the gate because
[1:09:20] I didn't pay for this pre-check and I'm
[1:09:22] gonna use it.
[1:09:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So pre-check is
[1:09:29] where I don't have to do certain things
[1:09:31] that a normal person got to do.
[1:09:33] Hallelujah. Certain things I can skip. I
[1:09:35] ain't got to take my shoes off. I ain't
[1:09:37] no terrorist.
[1:09:40] Hallelujah. I ain't got to pull all this
[1:09:42] stuff out my bag. All I do is put up
[1:09:44] this a special line for people like me.
[1:09:47] Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] And as much as I love my family, they
[1:09:52] got their own identity.
[1:09:57] I love them, but I say I see y'all. I
[1:10:00] see y'all on the other side.
[1:10:02] What you mean? You can't leave us. I
[1:10:04] just everything good. I see you on the
[1:10:06] other side.
[1:10:08] Hallelujah. Shoot. And you know they
[1:10:10] trying to make you feel guilty. Shoot.
[1:10:11] Just because you don't want to take off
[1:10:13] those shoes.
[1:10:17] Nope. I got the privilege, so I ain't
[1:10:18] going to do it.
[1:10:21] Think about that.
[1:10:23] No matter how much you love somebody,
[1:10:26] don't let them steal your privileges of
[1:10:28] God.
[1:10:31] Hallelujah. Don't let them, hallelujah,
[1:10:33] steal your experience with God. Don't
[1:10:36] let them tell you at the age of 12 or 13
[1:10:39] or 17 or 18 or whatever you can't know
[1:10:42] God in a special way. Yes, you can.
[1:10:48] You can meet God just like Diddy did in
[1:10:50] the Bible. Amen.
[1:11:00] I want you young people to know when it
[1:11:03] comes to God, he doesn't have a
[1:11:04] respected person. But if you ever get on
[1:11:07] your knees and cry out, God will meet
[1:11:09] you. He has to because that's who he is.
[1:11:14] Hallelujah.
[1:11:17] Gideon, he comes. I ain't going to be
[1:11:18] too much long. Y'all know I'm about to
[1:11:19] close.
[1:11:25] conquerors of fear. And we're preaching
[1:11:29] about fear tonight because no doubt fear
[1:11:33] is in the building. Hallelujah. I've
[1:11:36] seen Hallelujah. People sitting right in
[1:11:39] church, husband and wives, and the wife
[1:11:42] is afraid of her husband.
[1:11:48] See, if you would say amen a little bit
[1:11:51] louder,
[1:11:52] give a little bit of hallelujah,
[1:11:55] we wouldn't be zeroing in on these
[1:11:56] spirits like this.
[1:11:59] Hallelujah. But we here now. Hallelujah.
[1:12:02] But look, I've seen it. I've seen it
[1:12:03] where people are sitting in church and
[1:12:05] their security blanket is I'm in church.
[1:12:08] But when they get home, they're afraid
[1:12:11] of who this man is supposed to be, a man
[1:12:13] of God until he gets angry. When they
[1:12:16] get angry, he turns into something else.
[1:12:18] Hallelujah. Let me tell you, you have a
[1:12:21] right to be delivered from that.
[1:12:23] Hallelujah. Amen. Your real true love
[1:12:26] and you falling in your position can
[1:12:29] defeat that anger spirit.
[1:12:32] Hallelujah. How many in the Bible, how
[1:12:34] many of us have ever seen an angry demon
[1:12:36] hit Jesus?
[1:12:41] They couldn't do it. No,
[1:12:44] Hallelujah. Even the angry demon came up
[1:12:47] to the prophet and he told him, "What
[1:12:50] I'mma do to you?" Hallelujah. I'm going
[1:12:52] to break every bone in your body. He
[1:12:55] said, he just stood there. Why? Because
[1:12:57] the same Jesus that was in the Bible was
[1:12:59] the same Jesus standing behind that
[1:13:01] flesh. Hallelujah. And he didn't have to
[1:13:03] be afraid. He was a conqueror of fear.
[1:13:07] Everybody else behind him jumped up and
[1:13:09] ran, but he stayed there. Why did
[1:13:12] everybody else run? Because of the
[1:13:14] reputation of the man.
[1:13:16] They heard what he done. So they ran.
[1:13:20] Hallelujah. But the prophet stood there.
[1:13:22] He was not afraid. Why? Because of his
[1:13:25] experiences with God.
[1:13:28] That's right.
[1:13:31] I'm no different than you. There have
[1:13:33] been area there have been times in my
[1:13:34] life where I've been afraid.
[1:13:37] But then God comes in and takes away
[1:13:38] that fear. And once he takes away that
[1:13:41] fear, Hallelujah. If you ever come back
[1:13:43] around to that again, you don't have to
[1:13:45] be afraid.
[1:13:47] Hallelujah. I was in New Zealand and
[1:13:49] they got this big old tower that you go
[1:13:52] all the way up to the whatever floor it
[1:13:54] is. It's way up there. It seem like you
[1:13:55] in the clouds. You go way up there and
[1:13:58] then they got a floor where it's a glass
[1:14:01] floor and you walking around on it and
[1:14:04] you can see the bottom
[1:14:06] and say, "Come on. Come on, brother D.
[1:14:07] Come on." I say,
[1:14:11] "Now other people have done it plenty of
[1:14:13] times, but now I got to conquer my
[1:14:16] fear."
[1:14:18] Didn't matter what kind of shoe I had
[1:14:19] on, a pair of Jordans, but them Jordans
[1:14:21] couldn't help me right then. Hallelujah.
[1:14:23] This wasn't basketball.
[1:14:25] This was a a step a faith glass and I
[1:14:28] didn't seen somebody else do all of they
[1:14:30] walking around.
[1:14:33] But I'm from Carolina. I'm not from New
[1:14:35] Zealand and all this is new to me. So
[1:14:37] I'm like they said, "Come on, brother.
[1:14:39] It ain't going to bother you." And I'm
[1:14:41] thinking in my I got all these kind of
[1:14:44] thoughts in my mind. Where do these
[1:14:46] thoughts come from when it's time for
[1:14:48] you to do something that you've never
[1:14:49] done before?
[1:14:52] Yes, sir. A lot of times it's the enemy
[1:14:54] not want you to recognize who you are.
[1:14:59] A lot of times it's the enemy not want
[1:15:01] you young people to realize your
[1:15:03] potential.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah. Let me say this. If you got
[1:15:09] friends that don't make you a better
[1:15:11] person, that's not your friend.
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:15] If you if you go to church together and
[1:15:18] you leave church and there's no
[1:15:19] conversation about church, that's not
[1:15:22] somebody you need to be around.
[1:15:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:29] Cuz we'll dress up for church. We'll
[1:15:31] look nice for church. We'll do all these
[1:15:33] things for church, but we won't be the
[1:15:35] church.
[1:15:38] Hallelujah. We'll put on our show. We'll
[1:15:40] we'll we'll come and present oursel like
[1:15:42] glamour girls. We have everything right.
[1:15:45] Cuz the one might be there this weekend.
[1:15:48] And I want a Christian man, but I'm not
[1:15:51] a Christian.
[1:15:56] I want a Christian woman, but I'm not a
[1:15:58] man of God.
[1:16:02] That's why you got to know God. But boy,
[1:16:04] I tell you why. That's the reason why
[1:16:06] some of these young people are not
[1:16:08] married because they're afraid.
[1:16:10] That's right. Cuz the young men are not
[1:16:12] honest and the young women are not
[1:16:14] honest. Everybody's playing the religion
[1:16:17] game.
[1:16:20] They look good in church. They sing on
[1:16:21] the choir, but when they get home, their
[1:16:23] rooms nasty. They don't do the dishes.
[1:16:26] They don't do nothing they supposed to
[1:16:27] do.
[1:16:29] Young boys don't cut the grass.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah. Don't know don't even know
[1:16:32] how to uh pick up clothes behind
[1:16:35] themselves.
[1:16:36] But I'm ready to be a husband.
[1:16:40] No, you ready to make somebody angry
[1:16:46] cuz the first thing she going to do is
[1:16:48] look at why you dropping your clothes
[1:16:50] way over there. The hamper over here.
[1:16:55] But because he's never had to clean up
[1:16:57] behind himself and now he's Oh, I need
[1:17:00] to leave this alone.
[1:17:02] Let me leave this alone. Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] Because hey, hey, brother Paul, I hope
[1:17:06] you don't mind. Hallelujah. But what
[1:17:08] we've done, we push these kids into
[1:17:11] marriage and they not ready.
[1:17:15] We pull out quotes and all these things
[1:17:17] and brother Brandham said, "Marry
[1:17:18] young." Yeah. If you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:22] but if you ain't got the Holy Ghost, all
[1:17:24] you're going to do is mess up somebody's
[1:17:26] life, brother.
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:29] Cuz
[1:17:32] in reality, you getting married is not
[1:17:34] about a spiritual yearning for headship.
[1:17:37] It's more about a natural sexual
[1:17:39] yearning.
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:49] You ain't want to get married cuz you
[1:17:51] you want to follow a a good leader. No.
[1:17:55] You like, boy, he's hot.
[1:17:58] He's so hard. See, he's making me hard.
[1:18:03] And all both of you gonna be hard in
[1:18:06] hell.
[1:18:11] Because you're choosing the wrong things
[1:18:13] besides God. Hallelujah.
[1:18:16] Think about it. What should we be
[1:18:18] looking for? We should be looking for
[1:18:20] character.
[1:18:22] Hallelujah. Character is not a gift, but
[1:18:24] it's the victory. Right.
[1:18:28] Hallelujah.
[1:18:31] But I'm ready to be a wife. Oh, you are
[1:18:37] this generation. Hallelujah. Of young
[1:18:40] girls,
[1:18:42] they don't even know how to sew.
[1:18:48] Y'all can say amen.
[1:18:53] And it ain't y'all fault. Society has
[1:18:56] put you in a stage, a realm where
[1:18:59] everything, hallelujah, it's easy. You
[1:19:03] You don't have to use a needle and
[1:19:04] thread. You just pay somebody to do it.
[1:19:06] Hallelujah. Young men don't know how to
[1:19:09] be men anymore. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:11] They don't they can't even change a
[1:19:13] tire. Can't even do simple things.
[1:19:17] Why? Because society has made them that
[1:19:19] way. But it's up to us to bring back the
[1:19:23] real man. Sisters, it's up to you to
[1:19:26] bring back the real woman. Hallelujah.
[1:19:30] And say, nowadays, women want a godly
[1:19:32] man, but they don't want to be a godly
[1:19:34] woman. And vice versa. Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] Oh my boy. We went from cocking fear to
[1:19:41] relationships.
[1:19:43] You know why? Because too many of you
[1:19:46] are thinking about that when you should
[1:19:47] be thinking about God.
[1:19:49] Hallelujah. Where are you with God? Are
[1:19:53] you in love with him more than the
[1:19:56] fantasy of being married?
[1:19:58] Are you in love, hallelujah, with God's
[1:20:01] peace? Hallelujah. With God's
[1:20:03] deliverance and salvation. Are you in
[1:20:06] love with Calvary?
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:13] Oh my. Oh my. Brother, why you feeling?
[1:20:16] Cuz I feel like the devil is getting
[1:20:18] knocked out tonight.
[1:20:22] Victory
[1:20:23] is ours.
[1:20:25] I want you young people to understand
[1:20:28] that coming to church is more than you
[1:20:30] just dressing right.
[1:20:32] That's right. It's more than you just
[1:20:35] waiting out the service cuz you say this
[1:20:36] is brother Paul if I think he definitely
[1:20:38] going to have some snacks after church.
[1:20:42] It's more than that. Yes, sir.
[1:20:44] Hallelujah. It's it's more than a good
[1:20:46] time. But it's you, hallelujah, having
[1:20:49] an encounter with God where your life is
[1:20:53] changed forever.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah. When I met God at the age of
[1:20:58] 15 with cancer in my brain, my life
[1:21:01] changed forever.
[1:21:03] And what he did for me, he became my
[1:21:05] savior, my healer, deliverer. And no
[1:21:08] matter what I did, you can never take
[1:21:10] that away from me because it's something
[1:21:13] real.
[1:21:15] It's something real.
[1:21:17] It's something. Hallelujah. I was in a
[1:21:19] predicament that my mama couldn't get me
[1:21:21] out of, that my daddy couldn't get me
[1:21:23] out of. What was it? It was Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] me meeting God for myself.
[1:21:31] And that's what we need. We need a
[1:21:33] personal encounter with God. You're
[1:21:35] getting old, rich or poor.
[1:21:40] [Music]
[1:21:43] What good is coming to church and you
[1:21:46] don't hear from God?
[1:21:49] And it's not to say that God is not
[1:21:51] speaking. It's where are you?
[1:21:58] Listen, I need to move along.
[1:22:02] I thought somebody going to say, "Thank
[1:22:03] you, Jesus."
[1:22:06] Let's move along. What we've done is we
[1:22:09] put our natural needs before our
[1:22:12] spiritual needs.
[1:22:14] And anytime you put your natural needs
[1:22:16] before your spiritual needs, the element
[1:22:19] fear is still there to dominate.
[1:22:24] Oh my.
[1:22:28] Listen,
[1:22:30] let's move on.
[1:22:32] God took away Gideon's fear. How? by
[1:22:36] simply showing him, I'm with you. Just
[1:22:38] keep moving forward.
[1:22:40] As he moved forward, God moved with him
[1:22:44] to show him how relevant he was. God
[1:22:48] moved with him to show that whatever
[1:22:50] step you take, if you keep your eyes on
[1:22:52] me, I'm here with you. Hallelujah. So,
[1:22:55] what he did was he took him out there,
[1:22:57] this big old army and all this stuff.
[1:22:58] And God say, "You need to thin it down.
[1:23:00] Let's thin it down." And I think he went
[1:23:02] from 20,000 all the way down to 400 or
[1:23:04] 600, something like that. You can go
[1:23:06] back and look it up. He said, "And with
[1:23:09] this amount of men, you going to defeat
[1:23:11] the enemy." I'm going to deal with your
[1:23:13] fears in a supernatural way
[1:23:16] in a way, hallelujah, that the enemy
[1:23:19] can't make you doubt it anymore. You
[1:23:21] know it had to be me.
[1:23:23] And that's what I love about God. God
[1:23:25] will do things in your life, hallelujah,
[1:23:27] till nobody else can get the credit but
[1:23:30] him. That's right. Can I get a witness?
[1:23:34] Have things happened to you that nobody
[1:23:36] else can get the credit? But God.
[1:23:40] But God. You remember this morning, sir?
[1:23:42] Yes, sir.
[1:23:44] Only God.
[1:23:51] The problem is
[1:23:53] too many of us have have had a still
[1:23:57] birth.
[1:24:01] You know what a still birth is? The
[1:24:03] baby's born, but then there's no life to
[1:24:05] show that it's alive.
[1:24:08] Hallelujah. And I ain't saying you got
[1:24:11] to jump, scream, and holler. But what
[1:24:12] I'm saying is if there's a life of
[1:24:14] Christ inside of you, that life will
[1:24:17] ooze out. That life will testify on its
[1:24:20] own. Hallelujah. That life, hallelujah,
[1:24:24] will look to grow in Christ.
[1:24:27] Hallelujah. And what you young people
[1:24:29] should be looking for is to grow in
[1:24:31] Christ. Hallelujah. See, hallelujah. A a
[1:24:34] a queen, hallelujah, have may have been
[1:24:37] a princess first, but then there was a
[1:24:40] time in her life where she grew up and
[1:24:42] adoption came in. And now she can run
[1:24:43] the whole kingdom. Hallelujah. And a
[1:24:46] king, he was a prince first, but then
[1:24:48] there was a time in his life where he
[1:24:49] grew up and he was able to take over the
[1:24:51] whole kingdom. What stage are you in?
[1:24:59] Listen,
[1:25:02] conquerors of fear.
[1:25:04] The prophet of God, he says,
[1:25:07] oh my, here's some powerful quotes. I
[1:25:11] want you to catch it cuz I ain't going
[1:25:12] to be too much longer.
[1:25:16] He said, there's only two elements that
[1:25:18] you can live by. There's only two
[1:25:21] elements you can be controlled by.
[1:25:24] Did you hear that? There's only two
[1:25:27] things tonight that you can be
[1:25:30] controlled by.
[1:25:33] Y'all know I'm a walker.
[1:25:36] What's your name, bro? Steve. Steve.
[1:25:38] There's only two elements you can be
[1:25:40] controlled by. What's your name?
[1:25:43] Rebecca. There's only two elements you
[1:25:46] can be controlled by. What's your name?
[1:25:48] Brent. Brent. There's only two elements
[1:25:51] you can be controlled by. Now, I just
[1:25:53] took three people and told them the same
[1:25:56] thing.
[1:25:58] But that goes for everybody in this
[1:26:00] room. Exactly. What am I doing? I'm
[1:26:02] destroying the myth, but I'm different.
[1:26:05] Brother Diggs.
[1:26:10] I'm different. No. Two elements
[1:26:14] that you can be controlled by.
[1:26:16] Hallelujah. No matter what you going
[1:26:18] through, no matter what your past is, no
[1:26:21] matter what house, hallelujah, you were
[1:26:23] born in, hallelujah, Canadian or
[1:26:26] American,
[1:26:30] there's only two elements.
[1:26:34] But what the devil comes and he does, he
[1:26:36] says, "But your situation is different."
[1:26:38] No, two elements.
[1:26:42] Say it with me. Two elements.
[1:26:47] that you can be controlled by.
[1:26:52] Well, Steve might say, "But I'm older
[1:26:54] than them."
[1:26:57] Two elements.
[1:26:59] Rebecca might say, "But I'm a girl."
[1:27:04] Two elements. Exactly. Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] Don't somebody say, "Well, I'm married."
[1:27:11] Two elements.
[1:27:13] Exactly. Do somebody say, "I wasn't born
[1:27:16] in a message, though." Two elements.
[1:27:19] Do somebody say, "Well, I've never been
[1:27:21] to Jeffersonville."
[1:27:22] Two elements.
[1:27:24] Whatever your excuse is, hallelujah.
[1:27:27] You're either being controlled by God or
[1:27:30] the devil.
[1:27:33] Amen. Amen. Victoria, two elements.
[1:27:38] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:27:44] And sometimes when you preach like this,
[1:27:46] people resent you because it's too
[1:27:48] plain.
[1:27:51] And we strip away your excuses.
[1:27:55] But I'm only I'm only How old are you?
[1:27:58] Yeah. You 14. What's your name? Armen.
[1:28:02] Armen. Almond's 14. But you know what?
[1:28:06] Two elements.
[1:28:09] Can't get away from it. What's your
[1:28:11] name, bro? Chris. Chris, how old are
[1:28:13] you, Chris? 31. 31. My I'm jump from 14
[1:28:18] to 31. Chris, two elements. Amen. Caleb,
[1:28:24] two elements. I've been married for 18
[1:28:27] years. Me and my husband been married
[1:28:29] for 18 years. One, two elements.
[1:28:34] She gets through my two elements.
[1:28:39] Hallelujah. Jasmine Joe.
[1:28:43] My dad is a preacher.
[1:28:46] Two elements.
[1:28:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:54] Oh my. I got one jumping out at me, but
[1:28:57] I can't find nobody.
[1:29:00] Oh my. Let me walk on this side. Bear
[1:29:02] with me. I got something brooding right
[1:29:05] now.
[1:29:08] I'm looking for somebody. I can't quite
[1:29:11] find them.
[1:29:13] So, I got to come all the way back here.
[1:29:18] Yeah.
[1:29:20] I'm on a Fontine.
[1:29:24] Two elephants.
[1:29:27] Hallelujah.
[1:29:29] It don't matter your background. It
[1:29:32] don't matter where you come from. It
[1:29:34] don't matter what you've been through.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah. You're either going to be
[1:29:37] controlled by God or the devil. Amen.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] Hallelujah.
[1:29:48] I've been serving the Lord since 1990. I
[1:29:51] ain't I ain't going to give y'all I
[1:29:52] ain't going to give it all to you. You
[1:29:54] like, man, he ain't a young person. Why
[1:29:56] is he preaching to the young people?
[1:29:59] But it doesn't matter. Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] Brother people, how long you've been
[1:30:03] serving the Lord? 44 years. 44 years.
[1:30:06] Good God almighty.
[1:30:10] I'm looking at Jesus.
[1:30:15] This my guy. I love him. I just love his
[1:30:17] personality, his character. Hallelujah.
[1:30:19] You know, some people you can just look
[1:30:21] at and when you see them, they just
[1:30:22] bring a a good feeling about themselves.
[1:30:25] I appreciate him. Met him years and
[1:30:27] years ago down in Lama's always been the
[1:30:29] same every time you see me. Hallelujah.
[1:30:31] But think about it. He's been serving
[1:30:32] the Lord longer than I have. 44 years.
[1:30:36] But when it comes to this
[1:30:39] two elements,
[1:30:44] everybody say it with me. Two elements,
[1:30:48] right? We all are controlled by two
[1:30:52] elements. I know on this row, y'all
[1:30:53] waiting for me to come over here.
[1:30:55] Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] Everybody say it with me on this row.
[1:31:00] All right. There we go. Praise God.
[1:31:02] Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. See, it's all right to
[1:31:07] intermingle with the spirit. Church is
[1:31:10] not supposed to be some bored place
[1:31:12] where we go to waste time, but it's
[1:31:14] supposed to be a place where we meet
[1:31:16] God. God talks to us and he gives us
[1:31:19] substance when we go back home. Leave
[1:31:22] out of church like brother Homer said
[1:31:24] with a smile on your face. It ain't
[1:31:27] that's
[1:31:29] I remember I remember one time I was
[1:31:32] preaching someplace and and you know
[1:31:34] people this is here this is neither here
[1:31:36] nor there but I'm just making a point. I
[1:31:38] was preaching some place and after
[1:31:39] service went over to the fellowship hall
[1:31:40] and you know people be so doctrinal the
[1:31:42] man like we can't we can't we can't
[1:31:45] worship in we can't eat in here it's
[1:31:47] connected to the church. The fellowship
[1:31:49] halls is supposed to be a different
[1:31:51] building. I'm like huh?
[1:31:54] He's like, "Yeah, God's not here."
[1:31:57] I said, "Brother, you see all these
[1:31:59] people walking around smiling, happy,
[1:32:02] talking about the Lord. God's not here."
[1:32:05] I said, "We just came out of service,
[1:32:07] powerful healings and all kind of stuff.
[1:32:09] This lady who was crippled, had a back
[1:32:11] broke. God healed her right there in the
[1:32:13] service and he's he's so busy caught up
[1:32:16] on a a misinterpreting a a quote, he
[1:32:20] can't even see what God has done."
[1:32:22] Right? And that's what's happened a lot
[1:32:23] of times in church. We so busy don't
[1:32:25] want to quote the bam over somebody
[1:32:27] head. We can't even see when God is
[1:32:29] dealing with our children.
[1:32:34] We won't even give God a chance to move.
[1:32:37] He's going to God's not here. God's not
[1:32:39] here. I said, "Father, look at all the
[1:32:40] people. Look at this man look at me and
[1:32:42] say it's the food. They happy because of
[1:32:46] the food."
[1:32:50] Oh Lord.
[1:32:52] And I couldn't take it no more. I
[1:32:55] couldn't take it no more. I said,
[1:32:56] "Brother, you mean to tell me some
[1:32:58] CocaCola and potato chips
[1:33:02] will heal people and put joy on their
[1:33:04] face like this?" Hey, I'm I'm just
[1:33:08] trying to tell you what the prophet
[1:33:10] said.
[1:33:16] Oh my. We've been reduced,
[1:33:20] hallelujah, to fussing and fighting
[1:33:22] about nonsense
[1:33:24] when God is here.
[1:33:27] God is here to produce a change. God is
[1:33:30] here to take away our fears. God is here
[1:33:33] to make us better people. And we fussing
[1:33:35] and fighting about quotes.
[1:33:41] Amen.
[1:33:45] The reason why we have so much division
[1:33:47] is because of people's fears.
[1:33:50] That's exactly reason why people talk
[1:33:52] about worship and all these other things
[1:33:53] because they lazy. They don't want to
[1:33:56] clap their hands. They don't want to
[1:33:57] stand to their feet. You know, brother
[1:33:59] Brandon says a still small voice.
[1:34:02] Well, I ask you how many still small
[1:34:04] voices it was when they crossed through
[1:34:06] the Red Sea.
[1:34:08] I guarantee you what none of them quiet
[1:34:10] did. Hallelujah. The Bible said Miriam
[1:34:12] grabbed a tambourine and all the
[1:34:14] daughters of Zion followed.
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:20] Let me move on. Everybody all right.
[1:34:23] Listen, where was I?
[1:34:28] I say all that and y'all still don't
[1:34:30] remember.
[1:34:34] two elements
[1:34:36] that you can be controlled by
[1:34:40] that is either faith or doubt.
[1:34:44] And listen to this. If you are doubting
[1:34:46] which doubt is fear.
[1:34:49] Amen. Amen. I want everybody in here
[1:34:52] tonight stop doubting yourself.
[1:34:56] Stop doubting. Hallelujah. that you can
[1:34:58] have a true genuine connection with God
[1:35:02] that goes beyond just being in church,
[1:35:05] but something personal when you can
[1:35:07] recognize his voice, when you can
[1:35:09] recognize his leadership.
[1:35:15] And that's where Satan wins when he has
[1:35:18] us walking by doubt.
[1:35:21] Because listen, he says there is either
[1:35:24] faith or doubt. Doubt will accompany
[1:35:28] fear.
[1:35:33] So if you doubt yourself,
[1:35:36] the spirit of fear is right there with
[1:35:38] you.
[1:35:47] Fear will accompany doubt. So if Jesus
[1:35:50] said fear not, don't be afraid. God
[1:35:53] keeps his word. No matter what condition
[1:35:57] you are tonight, God keeps his word. Let
[1:36:00] me say this now. That's showing what the
[1:36:02] devil does. Fear and doubt work
[1:36:05] together. But what happens when you got
[1:36:08] love and faith?
[1:36:10] I love God. Oh my.
[1:36:14] Listen, just loving just just loving
[1:36:17] him. Oh, we say we have faith. We have
[1:36:21] love. But if we had love, we'd have
[1:36:25] faith.
[1:36:26] For that is perfect love castethes out
[1:36:29] what? All fear.
[1:36:33] Now listen to this next part. And when
[1:36:36] fear is gone, faith is perfect.
[1:36:43] Oh my.
[1:36:47] That right there, what we just had was
[1:36:50] like one of them nuclear bombs.
[1:36:53] Hallelujah. It's like one of them bombs
[1:36:55] the US just dropped on Iran this
[1:36:57] morning. Hallelujah. When fear is gone,
[1:37:00] your faith is perfect.
[1:37:04] Shouldn't we all desire to walk in that?
[1:37:08] I'm no longer a slave to fear, but I'm
[1:37:11] going to step out on faith and God will
[1:37:14] accompany you.
[1:37:22] I read Esther to say
[1:37:26] in Esther
[1:37:29] chapter 4,
[1:37:34] Morci was telling her
[1:37:37] to go before the king because something
[1:37:40] is about to happen to the Jews. And
[1:37:42] Esther, let's let's back up and read it.
[1:37:44] Esther chapter 4.
[1:37:48] Let's go to uh
[1:37:51] let's start at verse 11.
[1:37:55] I want you to catch catch the context.
[1:37:58] Now the background is
[1:38:01] hallelujah.
[1:38:03] The king put away his first wife
[1:38:08] because she wouldn't be obedient. Right.
[1:38:12] So he sit down say I got to get myself a
[1:38:14] new queen. Hallelujah. And Esther got
[1:38:18] the job. Hallelujah. Because she came to
[1:38:21] the king just being herself. Yes, sir.
[1:38:25] She didn't have no BBLs or CDLs or
[1:38:30] whatever else kind of L's. There you go.
[1:38:33] Hallelujah. She didn't have no lip
[1:38:36] injections, no cheek injections, no
[1:38:38] botox, no flowtox.
[1:38:48] She just came to the king as she was.
[1:38:52] She didn't have no
[1:38:57] Fendy makeup.
[1:39:00] Kardashian makeup.
[1:39:03] Hallelujah. She came as she was.
[1:39:09] And you know what? That was enough for
[1:39:11] the king. Amen. Everybody else was
[1:39:14] purifying theelves. They was putting all
[1:39:15] their perfume on white diamond,
[1:39:19] you know, spraying on their obsession.
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:28] You know, I always say these names.
[1:39:29] These these names got spirits behind
[1:39:31] them, right? That's so true. Obsession.
[1:39:35] Yes. He won't leave me alone
[1:39:39] cuz he's obsessed.
[1:39:41] You just sprayed the stuff on.
[1:39:47] But look, she come. There's a lot of
[1:39:50] other There's a lot of other names I can
[1:39:51] hit, but I'mma leave it alone.
[1:39:53] Hallelujah.
[1:39:55] I I like alone, too, but I always stuff
[1:39:57] like cool water.
[1:40:01] Hallelujah. One of my favorites is the
[1:40:03] king of
[1:40:06] Hallelujah. When I put Let me stop. Let
[1:40:08] me stop. Let me stop. Let me stop.
[1:40:11] Sometimes I got something to make me
[1:40:13] think I'm greater than what I am. I like
[1:40:16] to put on some diesel.
[1:40:23] Hallelujah.
[1:40:25] Hallelujah. But anyway,
[1:40:28] you look Esther now, she's she she she's
[1:40:31] she's, you know, there's a purification
[1:40:33] process and all these things and she
[1:40:34] said, "You know what? I'm just coming
[1:40:36] like I am. I got to quit.
[1:40:46] You wonder how long I've been
[1:40:47] preaching?" One hour.
[1:40:50] All right. I try to be courteous.
[1:40:53] Amen. But look, Esther, she has to go
[1:40:56] through the she has to no and I didn't I
[1:40:58] didn't hit the hit the snooze. I cut it
[1:41:00] off.
[1:41:02] But anyway, Esther, she has to go
[1:41:04] through the purification and they have
[1:41:05] to do all this stuff and all this and
[1:41:07] Esther's chosen. Now she's the queen.
[1:41:10] Now something is arising. Trouble is
[1:41:12] arising. Hallelujah. Morei is telling
[1:41:14] her, Esther, you need to go speak up for
[1:41:15] your people. And Esther, this is
[1:41:17] Esther's response. Where I'm at, chapter
[1:41:20] uh 4, let's start at verse 11. Let's
[1:41:23] start at verse 10. And again Esther
[1:41:25] spake uh uh unto Hack and gave him
[1:41:29] commandment unto Mori. All the king's
[1:41:32] servants and the people of the king
[1:41:35] province did do know that whosoever
[1:41:39] whether man or woman shall come unto the
[1:41:42] king into the inner court, who is not
[1:41:46] called, there is one law of his to put
[1:41:49] him to death. Yeah.
[1:41:53] So Esther Esther got all that she going
[1:41:55] through. She's afraid to approach the
[1:41:57] king cuz she don't want to die. She know
[1:42:00] that there's a lot going on. Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] The Jews are about to be persecuted, but
[1:42:04] she's thinking about her own life.
[1:42:08] That's true. And she's the queen. I
[1:42:11] wonder how many of us are thinking about
[1:42:12] our own life.
[1:42:15] Wow. True. I'll say this
[1:42:18] as a son. I'm a father, but I was a son
[1:42:20] also. I was doing something crazy one
[1:42:23] time and I thought about it. I say,
[1:42:24] "What if you get caught?
[1:42:27] How's your mama going to feel?" See,
[1:42:29] that's what we don't think about.
[1:42:32] We don't think about how how the things
[1:42:34] we do affect those that love us.
[1:42:37] Hallelujah. How that parent will feel to
[1:42:40] come pick you up in jail.
[1:42:44] Or come find you in a crack house.
[1:42:47] Hallelujah. Yeah, you done been taken
[1:42:49] advantage of or whatever and they know
[1:42:51] they didn't raise you like that.
[1:42:54] Or you forsake the truth and go out in
[1:42:56] the world and live this this worldly
[1:42:58] life and destroy your testimony. You
[1:43:01] don't think about the hurt you've
[1:43:02] caused.
[1:43:08] But I did that one day and I and I, you
[1:43:10] know, it was just so plain. I It's just
[1:43:12] a voice in my head. I just it just came
[1:43:14] back to me and just said, "You stupid."
[1:43:21] Now I was just, you know, talking to
[1:43:23] myself, my own conscious. You stupid.
[1:43:25] Why are you doing that?
[1:43:28] Think about how she would feel.
[1:43:30] Oh, she didn't put into you. Hallelujah.
[1:43:33] She didn't took a leave off of her job
[1:43:35] to be by your side while you had cancer
[1:43:37] in your brain. Hallelujah. She was there
[1:43:40] to cook and clean for you, to make sure
[1:43:42] you was good. And you're returning to
[1:43:45] her. This
[1:43:52] all you young people who don't have a
[1:43:54] license, have been driven here tonight,
[1:43:58] you ought to show some appreciation
[1:44:00] right to your parents or however you got
[1:44:03] here cuz they love you enough they want
[1:44:06] to put you in the presence of God.
[1:44:12] They're not doing this for themselves.
[1:44:14] They're doing it for you. And that's the
[1:44:16] thing we don't see as as as children.
[1:44:18] When you become an adult, you'll see it.
[1:44:22] Man, mama did all this for me. Daddy did
[1:44:24] all this for me.
[1:44:27] And what are you returning to them?
[1:44:30] Now, most of my kids are grown. Well,
[1:44:33] all of them pretty much. But you know,
[1:44:35] some of the most satisfying things about
[1:44:38] it, we'll go somewhere, we planning a
[1:44:41] trip, and we say, "Well, the trip is
[1:44:44] XYZ, and you know, we got to pay for
[1:44:46] this and pay for that." And and then
[1:44:48] some of them say, "Well, Dad, we got our
[1:44:51] own money. We'll take care of this." I'm
[1:44:52] like,
[1:44:54] "Thank you." Oh, thank you. Thank you.
[1:45:00] Oh, boy.
[1:45:02] Woo. What a feeling.
[1:45:04] Can I get an amen, parents? Hallelujah.
[1:45:08] Think about that. When your son come
[1:45:10] come to you and say, "Daddy, let me take
[1:45:11] you out to dinner." Oh, thank you,
[1:45:13] Jesus. Boy, I feel like speaking in
[1:45:16] tong.
[1:45:23] Oh, that daughter, you come home and
[1:45:24] that daughter say, "Mom, don't worry
[1:45:26] about it. I got dinner tonight." Mhm.
[1:45:28] Man, that wife feel like shouting the
[1:45:30] house. Mama feel like shouting the house
[1:45:32] down. Right.
[1:45:34] You going to cook and it going to taste
[1:45:36] good.
[1:45:40] Oh my. Now, if you still learning,
[1:45:42] that's a different story. Mom might be
[1:45:44] like, "No, I got it, baby. Go ahead." We
[1:45:47] don't want to upset the whole house. I
[1:45:48] got it.
[1:45:52] But you ought to want to, The God told
[1:45:55] Tommy Osborne, "Go sit up under that oak
[1:45:57] tree and learn." Honey, he was not only
[1:46:00] talking about spiritually, but natural
[1:46:02] things, too. sit up under that tree and
[1:46:04] learn. That's what you're doing as a
[1:46:06] young lady. You're sitting up under your
[1:46:08] mother's tree and you're learning the
[1:46:09] things of God. Same thing as a young
[1:46:12] man, you're sitting up under the oak
[1:46:13] tree of your father. Hallelujah. And
[1:46:16] you're learning the things of God. And
[1:46:17] if you don't have a father, that's what
[1:46:19] a pastor is.
[1:46:26] I got to quit.
[1:46:29] But Esther,
[1:46:31] Esther don't want to get in no trouble.
[1:46:33] Even though she the queen, she's saying,
[1:46:35] you know, we can't approach cuz you
[1:46:37] could be killed, you'll die. Hallelujah.
[1:46:39] She saying, and there's one law that is
[1:46:41] to put him to death except such to whom
[1:46:45] the king shall hold out the golden
[1:46:47] scepter. Hallelujah. That he may live.
[1:46:50] But but I not have been called to come
[1:46:55] in unto the king. Hallelujah. these 30
[1:46:58] days. Now, she got all reason
[1:47:02] according to the law to stand still.
[1:47:07] Yes, sir. But we're not under the law.
[1:47:11] Hallelujah. We've been given grace.
[1:47:14] Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Come boldly
[1:47:17] before the throne of God." Hallelujah.
[1:47:20] That's not coming like you somebody
[1:47:22] special.
[1:47:24] That's coming in reverence
[1:47:26] knowing that God has the answer to your
[1:47:28] need. So come boldly before the throne
[1:47:31] of God. And Esther makes this excuse. He
[1:47:34] says, and they told Mori these words.
[1:47:36] Now listen to Mori. Mori responds in in
[1:47:39] in in verse 13. He says, then Mori
[1:47:42] commanded to answer Esther, seek not
[1:47:45] with thyself that thou shalt escape in
[1:47:48] the king's house. He said, "I know
[1:47:50] you're the queen, but whatever happens,
[1:47:54] you're going to feel it.
[1:47:56] Whatever happens, you're going to be
[1:47:58] held accountable for it." Think about
[1:48:00] that, young people. Hallelujah. What if
[1:48:03] God put you in position to make a change
[1:48:05] and you stand still? You're going to be
[1:48:07] held accountable for that.
[1:48:12] God gave you a friend or maybe a best
[1:48:14] friend and you won't even witness to
[1:48:16] him.
[1:48:19] You're going to be held accountable for
[1:48:20] that soul.
[1:48:28] But y'all on social media, y'all y'all
[1:48:31] talking about all this other stuff and
[1:48:34] won't talk about God, the very substance
[1:48:37] of who you are.
[1:48:40] He said, "Thou shall not escape in the
[1:48:43] king's house more than all the Jews. For
[1:48:46] if thou for if thou altogether holdest
[1:48:49] thy peace at this time, then shall catch
[1:48:52] it not then shall their enlargement and
[1:48:54] deliverance arise in in the Jews from
[1:48:58] another place. But thou in thy father's
[1:49:00] house shall be destroyed
[1:49:04] because you had a chance to make a
[1:49:06] change and you didn't.
[1:49:10] Don't be that person. Amen. Don't be
[1:49:13] that person that can be a witness to
[1:49:15] somebody and change their lives, but
[1:49:18] you're so busy worried about your
[1:49:20] reputation,
[1:49:22] worried about losing friends, or worried
[1:49:24] about somebody looking at you different
[1:49:29] when your life, your words can help
[1:49:32] somebody get closer to God. He says,
[1:49:35] "And knowing whether thou art come to
[1:49:38] the kingdom for such a time as this,
[1:49:41] Could
[1:49:43] it be today that God allowed all of us
[1:49:48] to come to this tri-state meeting
[1:49:50] because there's something God has for
[1:49:52] you
[1:49:54] and he wants to take away your fear.
[1:49:59] Let's not be afraid.
[1:50:03] Look,
[1:50:04] every stage of my journey, there was
[1:50:07] some kind of fear,
[1:50:10] but God dealt with it.
[1:50:12] It ain't one brother that I know,
[1:50:16] I'm I'm speaking from experience. It
[1:50:19] ain't one brother that I know that
[1:50:20] honestly
[1:50:22] when they stepped into the call of
[1:50:23] preaching, they was like, "Boy, I'm
[1:50:24] ready. I'm ready. I'm ready to loose it.
[1:50:26] I got so much revelation." Yeah.
[1:50:29] Oh, they were afraid.
[1:50:32] If it's a real man of God, he's afraid
[1:50:34] because he knows whatever he says, he's
[1:50:36] going to be held accountable. Now, that
[1:50:39] guy that thinks he's God's gift to the
[1:50:41] world, you better watch him.
[1:50:45] Hallelujah. But that man, we know the
[1:50:47] prophet of God say a real man of God, he
[1:50:49] runs from the gift.
[1:50:52] But nowadays, everybody wants to be a
[1:50:54] preacher.
[1:50:56] Why?
[1:50:59] But look, Esther was trying to run from
[1:51:01] it. And Morci say, "Hey, you think you
[1:51:04] safe in the king's house? Whatever
[1:51:07] happens, you going to be the cause of
[1:51:09] it."
[1:51:11] And I ain't going to read it cuz I'm
[1:51:12] running out of time. But Esther, when
[1:51:14] she heard that, she reconsidered,
[1:51:16] hallelujah, who she was. She was like,
[1:51:18] "I'm the queen." Hallelujah. I'm the
[1:51:22] queen. If anybody got access to the
[1:51:23] king, I do. Hallelujah. So Esther
[1:51:26] against her fears, she conquered her
[1:51:28] fear and she went back there to the
[1:51:31] king. Hallelujah. And what did the king
[1:51:33] do? The king reached out the golden
[1:51:35] chapter.
[1:51:36] And he told her, Esther, hallelujah.
[1:51:38] Whatever you want, I got is yours all
[1:51:41] the way up to half of my kingdom.
[1:51:45] Once she conquered her fears, she had
[1:51:48] all that the king had.
[1:51:50] And if we could just conquer our fears
[1:51:52] tonight, everything that belongs to God
[1:51:55] belongs to you.
[1:52:00] Think about that tonight, church.
[1:52:02] Everything that belongs to God belongs
[1:52:03] to me.
[1:52:06] He's reached out the golden chapter to
[1:52:08] us.
[1:52:10] Forget about what your other friends are
[1:52:12] doing. Go back there and reach out to
[1:52:14] the king.
[1:52:20] Oh my. Listen, I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:52:22] close with this. Come listen. I'm
[1:52:24] closing.
[1:52:25] Listen. The prophet of God says, "God
[1:52:27] can use anything that's afraid."
[1:52:32] Oh my. God can use anything that's
[1:52:36] afraid. You know, Gideon had to send
[1:52:39] them all back. Hallelujah. Was scared.
[1:52:42] And if you're afraid to testify of your
[1:52:45] healing before he comes, God can't use
[1:52:48] you. If you're afraid to tell people
[1:52:51] you're you receive the Holy Ghost, don't
[1:52:54] worry. Hallelujah. He says, "I doubt
[1:52:56] whether you'll even get it or not.
[1:53:00] See, God wants heroes."
[1:53:08] God needs a hero tonight. God needs a
[1:53:12] sheer tonight. A king or a queen. That's
[1:53:16] who you are.
[1:53:20] Let's stop walking in fear and walk in
[1:53:21] faith.
[1:53:24] Because doubt is accompanied by fear.
[1:53:27] Hallelujah. But faith is accompanied by
[1:53:29] the love of God.
[1:53:31] Hallelujah.
[1:53:33] God wants a hero. He wants something
[1:53:37] that's brave. God wants something
[1:53:40] that'll stand up and talk. That's not
[1:53:43] scared to tell your boss or anyone else,
[1:53:46] "Jesus Christ, the son of God, has saved
[1:53:49] me from the life of sin."
[1:53:54] [Applause]
[1:53:59] Hallelujah.
[1:54:01] God want somebody to testify,
[1:54:04] I'm no longer a slave to to fear. Yes,
[1:54:08] but I'm a child of God.
[1:54:11] Hallelujah.
[1:54:13] And saying all we've said tonight, if
[1:54:16] you don't remember anything, Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] If you are afraid, God can use you.
[1:54:22] Hallelujah.
[1:54:25] But if you realize in your weakness,
[1:54:27] you're made strong.
[1:54:29] Hallelujah. See, weaknesses, you say,
[1:54:33] "I'm this. I'm that. I can't do this. I
[1:54:34] can't do that." All you're doing is
[1:54:35] making excuses.
[1:54:38] But if you say, "I can't do it, but God
[1:54:41] can."
[1:54:43] I don't know how to do it, but God can.
[1:54:47] I ain't ready to do it, but God is.
[1:54:52] How many of you would even take the time
[1:54:53] to acknowledge God where he is
[1:54:57] with a message like this and say, "Lord,
[1:54:59] were you talking to me?
[1:55:03] Were you trying to make yourself more
[1:55:05] aware to me?
[1:55:07] Is it just Brother Diggs or Lord are you
[1:55:09] talking to me? That's what services like
[1:55:12] these are all about. It's not about good
[1:55:14] preaching. It's about you coming into a
[1:55:18] deeper awareness with God.
[1:55:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] A deeper awareness with God. That's what
[1:55:30] we want. Amen. We don't want to just
[1:55:32] come to church and say, "I went to
[1:55:33] church." But we want to leave out of
[1:55:35] here saying, "Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:55:38] the Lord.
[1:55:40] I came and I had things on my heart and
[1:55:42] God spoke to my heart." As a young
[1:55:45] person, can you imagine when God
[1:55:49] conquered David's fears?
[1:55:51] This is the last story and I'mma quit.
[1:55:53] Hallelujah. Where did God deal with
[1:55:56] David's fears?
[1:55:57] Back there with the bear and the lion.
[1:56:01] So when he saw Goliath, it was just
[1:56:04] another
[1:56:05] another branch.
[1:56:07] It was just another battle. It was just
[1:56:10] another bear and another lion. Even
[1:56:13] though he was 9 ft or whatever he was
[1:56:15] tall, David didn't look at it like that.
[1:56:18] David looked at it like, "God is with
[1:56:20] me."
[1:56:22] If he was with me back then, he's with
[1:56:24] me right now. That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] So David goes and he he asks everybody,
[1:56:30] "What's the reward for his head?"
[1:56:33] He wasn't afraid. But all the people
[1:56:35] that were in position, they were afraid.
[1:56:38] Saul,
[1:56:40] all of David's brothers, all of the men
[1:56:43] that were chosen,
[1:56:46] all the men, I mean, that were called,
[1:56:48] hallelujah, they were afraid.
[1:56:51] But here comes David, a man out of God's
[1:56:53] very own heart. He plainly tells Goliath
[1:56:57] what he going to do to him.
[1:57:02] That's a man who knows God.
[1:57:04] He looks at this 9 ft terror. He looks
[1:57:08] at this 9 ft giant who has a reputation
[1:57:11] of destroying kingdoms and David looks
[1:57:14] at him. I'm going to cut your head off
[1:57:16] and doesn't even have a sword.
[1:57:20] Hallelujah.
[1:57:23] What was his faith? His faith was in
[1:57:26] Jesus. His faith was in the mighty God.
[1:57:33] Did he do it?
[1:57:36] He was a conqueror of fears. And look,
[1:57:39] church, when you go back and read, I
[1:57:40] ain't got time to read it, but when
[1:57:42] David killed Goliath, David ran and
[1:57:45] stood on top of him.
[1:57:48] Somebody need to stand on their demon
[1:57:50] tonight.
[1:57:52] Some of you young people need to stand
[1:57:53] on your fears tonight.
[1:57:56] You need to get on your tippy toes.
[1:57:58] Stand on that anxiety. Hallelujah. Stand
[1:58:01] on that sickness. Hallelujah. Stand
[1:58:03] Hallelujah. Stand on the things that you
[1:58:06] are afraid of. You need to stand on it
[1:58:07] tonight. David ran over, stood on it,
[1:58:11] took the enemy's sword out of his own
[1:58:14] sheath.
[1:58:16] Amen. Cut his head off.
[1:58:20] And you know what that did?
[1:58:22] David,
[1:58:24] because he was a conqueror of fear, he
[1:58:27] released the fears of everybody that was
[1:58:29] behind him.
[1:58:34] When David killed Goliath, everybody
[1:58:36] else in the audible.
[1:58:43] That's right. When David killed Goliath,
[1:58:47] everybody that was once afraid when
[1:58:49] Goliath went down, the Bible said that
[1:58:51] they chased the Philistines.
[1:58:55] Hallelujah. So you in your position, you
[1:58:59] conquering your fears. Hallelujah. It
[1:59:01] could release somebody else.
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:05] Hallelujah.
[1:59:07] Hallelujah. David released his brothers.
[1:59:10] David released the king. Hallelujah. He
[1:59:13] released everybody because he wasn't
[1:59:15] afraid. Will somebody not be afraid
[1:59:17] tonight?
[1:59:18] [Applause]
[1:59:21] God needs a hero.
[1:59:25] God wants a sheer.
[1:59:28] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:30] Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] You are the real conquerors tonight.
[1:59:36] Hallelujah.
[1:59:37] Let's break in right here.
[1:59:40] Let's break in with the Oh.
[1:59:46] Oh.

[2:03:49] down.
[2:03:52] Keep playing, King. Let's bring it all
[2:03:53] the way down.
[2:03:57] Don't look around. Don't compare your
[2:04:00] battle to somebody else's battle.
[2:04:03] The reason why I'm singing that song is
[2:04:05] because I want you to understand in
[2:04:08] Jesus you have the victory and you don't
[2:04:11] have to be afraid.
[2:04:13] That song says, "Who can stand before
[2:04:16] our King? Who can stand before our
[2:04:18] Lord?" Nobody can.
[2:04:21] And your God is here tonight to tell
[2:04:23] you, "Victory belongs to you."
[2:04:29] Whatever your fears are tonight, let
[2:04:30] them go.
[2:04:32] Let him go right now.
[2:04:36] Talk back to Satan and tell him, "I
[2:04:37] don't belong to you. My mind, my heart
[2:04:40] doesn't belong to you. It belongs to
[2:04:43] Jesus." Belonging.
[2:04:47] Oh. Oh.
[2:04:53] [Music]
[2:04:57] Jesus.
[2:04:59] Make a confession to the Lord.
[2:05:02] Whatever standing in the way, whatever
[2:05:03] you're afraid of
[2:05:05] right now in this moment, give it to the
[2:05:07] Lord,
[2:05:09] give God all your fears, all your
[2:05:11] anxieties, all your troubles, whatever
[2:05:13] spirit it may be. Give it to the Lord
[2:05:16] right now. We're not trying to work you
[2:05:18] up, but we're trying to let you see that
[2:05:21] God is here
[2:05:23] and he wants to do it for you more than
[2:05:25] you want it.
[2:05:27] Would
[2:05:29] you just not be afraid to walk with him,
[2:05:35] Lord Jesus, in this moment,
[2:05:38] Lord? Make yourself real to your people,
[2:05:41] Lord. Take us beyond the church service
[2:05:45] and past the outer court,
[2:05:49] Lord, into that veil,
[2:05:52] Lord, into that holy place where only
[2:05:55] you are, Lord.
[2:05:57] Lord, where our troubles can't follow
[2:05:59] us, our pains and our hurts can't follow
[2:06:03] us, our own ambitions can't follow us,
[2:06:07] but in your presence, we stand there
[2:06:09] alone with you.
[2:06:12] And we say tonight, God, have your way
[2:06:14] with us.
[2:06:16] As we pray, say unto God, Lord, have
[2:06:19] your way with me.
[2:06:21] Lord, this word was shared tonight for
[2:06:24] me that my fears can be dealt with, that
[2:06:28] I can be a conqueror of fears like
[2:06:31] Esther, like Gideon, like David.
[2:06:35] Lord, have your way with me
[2:06:38] right now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:42] Satan, I bind you. I bind your thoughts
[2:06:47] in the minds of your people, challenging
[2:06:49] them to remain the same. I bind you in
[2:06:53] the name of Jesus.
[2:06:55] Loose God's people
[2:06:57] right now
[2:06:59] in the name of Jesus. And I say unto
[2:07:02] you, go free.
[2:07:05] Go free right now.

[2:07:10] Go free. If you believe you are free, go

[2:07:14] Don't be afraid to be free. If you are
[2:07:16] free, go free right now. Hallelujah.
[2:07:20] Don't carry that hurt anymore. Don't
[2:07:22] carry that pain anymore. Hallelujah.
[2:07:24] Don't carry that doubt anymore. But this
[2:07:27] is your opportunity to be free in Jesus.
[2:07:30] Go free.
[2:07:34] Go free. Victory
[2:07:36] belongs to Jesus.
[2:07:40] Thank you, Lord. And if you are on the
[2:07:41] side of the Lord, victory belongs to
[2:07:43] you.
[2:07:45] Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:50] I feel the grips of Satan loosening
[2:07:53] right now.
[2:07:56] I feel the grips of the enemy loosening
[2:08:00] right now.
[2:08:02] loosening

[2:08:59] Jesus.
