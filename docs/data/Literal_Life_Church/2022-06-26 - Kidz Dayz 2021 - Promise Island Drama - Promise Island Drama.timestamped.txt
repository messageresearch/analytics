[7:45] see it later everyone put your hands
[7:47] down
[7:48] we're going back to our store close your
[7:49] eyes back to our story of our two little
[7:53] girls
[7:54] and these two little girls liked kids
[7:56] days so much
[7:58] that they went home and they started
[8:00] doing chores
[8:02] and started saving their pennies and
[8:04] their quarters
[8:05] and their dimes and they started
[8:07] bringing it to church and giving it to
[8:09] sister sheeran that's me
[8:11] and they started saying i want to give
[8:14] this money to kids day so we can have
[8:16] another kid's days
[8:17] and so the story goes
[8:21] that just like when jesus
[8:25] in the bible multiplied
[8:28] the loaves and the fishes from that one
[8:30] little boy
[8:32] that the two little girls gave a little
[8:35] bit of money
[8:37] and then god multiplied it and made it
[8:40] possible for us to do kids this
[8:42] kid's days this year isn't that exciting
[8:45] yes
[8:48] very good very good
[8:51] so and those two little girls are here
[8:54] but i won't embarrass them
[8:56] but i would like to show you something
[8:59] that they made for this year
[9:01] for other people to be able to give
[9:04] this is their box that they made for
[9:07] everybody else to be able to give
[9:10] to kids days for next time okay
[9:14] so we're gonna leave this at the church
[9:16] they painted this this is one side of
[9:18] the box it has
[9:19] ships on it ocean and this is my
[9:23] favorite part they did this with
[9:26] paint water paints from their house
[9:29] and then on this side you can see
[9:32] the little girl and this is an island
[9:35] girl with a little hut
[9:36] they made this from stuff they had at
[9:38] their house
[9:40] so they built this box so we're gonna
[9:41] leave this here outside and if anybody
[9:44] wants to give to kids days next year
[9:47] they can give the kids days now kids
[9:49] days takes a lot of work
[9:51] and not only work but it takes a lot of
[9:54] money
[9:56] takes about seven thousand dollars to do
[9:58] kids days every year
[10:00] and it takes about
[10:03] 50 or more people to work hard
[10:06] that's a lot of people to work right so
[10:10] that's the wonderful thing is that god
[10:12] through the whole year this year
[10:15] has provided the people and the funds
[10:19] and we would love to honor one person
[10:22] tonight
[10:23] who has given almost
[10:27] pretty much 90 percent of the funds for
[10:30] kids days this year
[10:32] have come from this one person and so

[14:00] is
[14:06] beyond the setting of many signs
[14:09] before the stars were formed the great
[14:12] god
[14:13] of all creation envisioned a plan
[14:16] for his people a plan to be prosperous
[14:20] and to enjoy good health a plan
[14:23] to live in a place of harmony and peace
[14:27] a place of promise and so
[14:30] he formed this island and as our island
[14:34] rose
[14:35] from the sea the children of the great
[14:37] god
[14:38] came to settle here and god graciously
[14:41] gifted his people
[14:43] with promises these promises were
[14:46] engraved on stones
[14:48] by our great great great grandfathers
[14:52] to preserve the truth to bring life to
[14:55] the island
[14:56] and to light the way for future
[14:58] generations
[15:01] [Music]
[15:04] we the people of promise

[15:15] to hold them dear to our hearts
[15:19] [Music]
[15:23] and when the time comes their darkness
[15:27] will cover our bright island
[15:31] but we must remain vigilant
[15:35] for our for when the
[15:41] for when the enemy comes in like a flood
[15:44] the spirit of the great god will rise up
[15:47] a standard against him
[15:49] [Music]
[15:51] and he will provide for us a savior
[15:56] and he also promised
[15:58] [Music]
[16:03] that in our darkest times
[16:07] we can trust in him to be our light
[16:13] we will keep and protect these promises
[16:17] we thank the great god for these
[16:19] promised stones

[19:36] so
[19:38] throughout the years the promised stones
[19:41] were a reminder
[19:43] of god's great love for his people
[19:46] his light shined down on the island
[19:49] and filled the air with laughter and
[19:52] warmth
[19:54] but everything seemed perfect
[19:57] but one dark and stormy night
[20:02] a ship landed on the shores of our
[20:05] island
[20:07] and who was the captain of this ship
[20:11] the dread pirate of the seas
[20:14] jacoby and his band of pirates
[20:20] [Music]
[20:25] they landed on our shores with an evil
[20:29] plan
[20:30] a plan to deceive the people of promise
[20:33] island
[20:34] a plan to steal the promised stones
[20:38] and a plan to take over
[20:49] it's just my island now
[20:54] jacoby and his band of pirates hid the
[20:56] promised stones deep in a cave
[20:59] so that no one could find him he hoped
[21:03] that eventually the people of promise
[21:05] island
[21:06] would forget about the stones and turn
[21:08] to him
[21:09] instead of the great god
[21:24] [Music]
[21:28] hmm
[21:38] [Music]
[21:52] [Music]
[21:56] hmm
[21:59] [Music]
[22:07] as time passed the islanders fearful of
[22:11] jacoby
[22:12] and his dark ways they wanted to
[22:15] challenge him
[22:16] but they decided just to leave jacoby in
[22:18] his band of pirates alone
[22:21] and not make any waves some even gave up
[22:25] looking for the promises and a few even
[22:28] started to believe
[22:29] jock these lies but there were a few
[22:33] who were strong and kept the promises
[22:36] alive
[22:37] in their hearts now children
[22:40] is there any questions about today's
[22:43] lesson
[22:44] yes eliana
[22:47] yes oh child
[22:51] that is my favorite story
[22:54] throughout many dark years grandma
[22:56] kailani taught the children
[22:58] every day about the wonderful promises
[23:02] that god had given to the islanders many
[23:04] years before
[23:09] you see little ones even though the
[23:12] promises have been taken from our hands
[23:14] we can learn to hold them in our hearts
[23:17] that way
[23:18] nothing can stand in our way not even
[23:20] the pirates
[23:22] not even pirates you see one of the
[23:25] promises of the great god
[23:27] is that light will be restored to our
[23:29] island
[23:30] and we will be saved from the darkness
[23:33] i'll save the island oh yes
[23:36] i am ready for you to do that why would
[23:39] the pirates want to steal our promises
[23:41] anyways
[23:42] oh why would the promises want to be
[23:45] stolen why would they steal them
[23:47] i'll tell you why because that mean old
[23:49] jacoby
[23:50] he thinks that he can get us to forget
[23:52] the promises and believe his
[23:54] lies he knows that the promises bring
[23:59] hope
[24:00] and light in times of darkness
[24:03] but the beautiful part about this is
[24:06] there are so many promises
[24:08] we can hardly count them all let's try
[24:11] to do that right now okay
[24:13] bring those instruments out and let's
[24:15] play a little music okay here we go
[24:20] one two three they're all in me
[24:24] hitting in my heart to stay promises

[24:29] i believe just what he'd say
[24:34] one two three they're all in me
[24:38] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[24:41] that's why he is always there in time of
[24:45] need
[24:46] [Music]
[24:47] we have just begun take them one by one
[24:52] hold them in your hearts and just
[24:54] believe
[24:56] me one two three
[25:01] [Music]
[25:12] they're on me
[25:15] the enemy can steal the peace of god
[25:18] [Music]
[25:19] his mercy is new with every dawn
[25:24] as many as the sand
[25:41] from
[25:44] [Music]

[27:08] i don't think they'd want any of this
[27:10] food anyway
[27:20] [Music]
[27:32] you need to stop thinking like that
[27:33] talia remember what grandma keilani
[27:36] always said
[27:37] fear not the great god is always with us
[27:41] he will make the sun shine again you

[27:44] [Music]
[27:46] you remember that hymn that she used to
[27:48] teach us to ah

[30:05] [Music]
[30:06] frustrations
[30:09] [Music]
[30:15] [Music]
[30:20] so
[30:24] as time went on the islanders gradually
[30:26] began to forget
[30:28] about the promises hope of a bright
[30:31] future
[30:32] began to fade with each passing day
[30:35] the island grew more and more dim
[30:39] the dread pirate jacoby spread his lies
[30:43] and fear and the children of the island
[30:46] started to follow the ways of the
[30:48] pirates
[30:49] instead of being kind the way the great
[30:52] god
[30:52] made them they began to dress
[30:56] act and even fight like the pirates
[30:59] they began bullying each other and
[31:02] making fun of the ones who believed the
[31:04] promises
[31:05] they started listening to the music and
[31:08] the songs
[31:09] of jacoby and his band of pirates and
[31:12] slowly
[31:13] forgot the truth of the promises of the
[31:16] great god
[31:18] the sun was slowly fading on prompt
[31:21] island
[31:26] i'm gonna teach you a little song you
[31:28] ready pirates
[31:35] have you ever heard a song that didn't
[31:38] sound amazing

[42:50] back the promised stones peacefully
[42:52] please
[42:53] foolish boy those promises are lost

[43:01] they will answer to me now
[43:12] you see jacoby we don't have to answer
[43:15] to you or your lies any longer
[43:18] even if i perish god will raise up
[43:20] another one to fight
[43:21] and another and another until you are
[43:24] defeated forever

[44:34] time

[44:43] power in them
[44:44] to restore our land not only that
[44:47] but god has given us the power

[45:03] god he

[46:36] yes
[46:38] leave get out

[46:57] thanks man what made you want to defend
[47:00] the promises
[47:02] well it was when i think it was when you
[47:05] reminded me of
[47:06] what this island what it used to look
[47:08] like
[47:10] it was something deep inside of me
[47:13] calling me to to fight for what's right
[47:18] i i know that sounds kind of dumb but
[47:21] no when god speaks to you it is never
[47:23] dumb you should always listen
[47:27] would you mind praying with me and
[47:30] asking the great god to come to your
[47:31] life
[47:32] and guide you yes
[47:36] i would love that
[47:40] [Music]
[47:47] wow a pirate's life this is all it's
[47:50] cracked up to be is it folks
[47:52] the byron jacoby promised all kinds of a
[47:55] wonderful
[47:56] great fun time on this island forget the
[47:59] promises
[48:00] forget the rules forget the principles
[48:02] of god's word you don't need that he
[48:03] said
[48:04] it'll be a great fun time to the pirate
[48:08] jacoby
[48:10] and that's actually the very same thing
[48:13] that the devil tries to tell each one of
[48:15] us
[48:16] today the promised islands that we just
[48:19] saw
[48:20] portrayed it's not that very far away
[48:22] from us
[48:23] actually it's the very world that we
[48:26] lived in god
[48:26] created this world a place of peace
[48:30] a place of prosperity where he could
[48:32] grow and develop and serve him
[48:35] but it's not become that today i just
[48:37] grabbed a newspaper this morning
[48:39] tell you what it looks a lot like the
[48:42] promised eye on the
[48:43] jacobi made it this isn't the promised
[48:46] island that god wants us as god has
[48:48] designed us for
[48:49] titus come up here bud
[48:53] each one of you kids you might have
[48:55] grown up in a church might have grown up
[48:56] somewhere else you may have grown up
[48:58] not knowing god you might have grown up
[48:59] knowing god it doesn't matter
[49:02] but what the devil wants to do he wants
[49:04] to convince you
[49:05] you're a pirate you're a sinner you're
[49:08] mine you're one of jacobi's guys you're
[49:11] one of the devil's guys
[49:12] that's what the pirate jackaby that's
[49:15] what the devil is still doing
[49:17] and with each one of you today he wants
[49:19] you to listen to his music he wants you
[49:20] to read his books
[49:22] he wants you to watch his videos on
[49:24] youtube so that you are convinced
[49:26] i'm a pirate
[49:30] that's what he wants you to convince
[49:34] are you a pirate though but you're not a
[49:37] pirate you're dressed like a pirate
[49:40] the devil's got you thinking sometimes
[49:42] you're a pirate but
[49:43] god has something so much better planned
[49:45] for each one of us
[49:48] god wants us to be his child
[49:52] he wants to take off these signs of a
[49:54] pirate
[49:55] why do we have to wear a patch over a
[49:58] pirate we can't see
[49:59] very well with this patch exactly the
[50:02] devil's deceiving us so you can't see
[50:04] well
[50:05] he wants to convince you you're his but
[50:07] take that patch off
[50:08] you don't need it you're not a pirate
[50:10] the promises are yours
[50:12] take this patch off take this off you're
[50:14] not a pirate
[50:15] you're a son of god but and you know
[50:18] what
[50:19] that is what repentance is all about
[50:22] repentance is all about saying no i
[50:25] don't i don't believe what the devil's
[50:27] telling me about who i am
[50:28] i'm not that i'm not a son of the devil
[50:31] i'm a son of god
[50:33] and if the devil's ever whispered that
[50:35] into your ear that it's gone
[50:36] you've gone too far that's hopeless
[50:39] you've served the devil too long
[50:41] he's wrong because the promises are
[50:44] still here
[50:44] god is still a deliverer he is still a
[50:47] savior he is still a healer
[50:48] it doesn't matter what it is there is no
[50:50] other name under heaven where by me we
[50:53] must be saved it's
[50:54] jesus christ and that name is still here
[50:57] today
[50:58] jesus christ
[51:04] and if you've never put your faith if
[51:06] you've never put your faith
[51:08] in jesus christ you'll be believing that
[51:10] you're a pirate in your heart
[51:12] but turn that off close your eyes with
[51:15] me
[51:16] pray that we might believe yes lord i
[51:20] pray that you would forgive me for
[51:21] believing the devil's lies
[51:23] i pray that you would forgive me lord
[51:26] for listening to the wrong
[51:27] things following the wrong influences
[51:30] forgive me lord and i pray o god that
[51:32] your spirit would come
[51:34] and cut that off i might believe that i
[51:36] am your son
[51:37] that you would forgive me of yours of my
[51:40] sins lord
[51:41] give me peace where there's been anger
[51:43] with me calm where there's been
[51:44] bitterness
[51:45] oh lord i pray that you would take all
[51:47] those things of jacobi away
