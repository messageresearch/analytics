[0:00] hallelujah i'm so glad to be here with
[0:03] you this morning
[0:04] i'm gonna uh let lay a little bit of
[0:07] foundation the word as we start out
[0:09] um i i think you all know that i'm not a
[0:12] lengthy preacher so i'd like to just
[0:14] take a little bit of more time here than
[0:16] usual to set a word foundation
[0:19] we'll be reading here in psalms 91
[0:24] and psalms 32 and 2nd peter
[0:27] chapter 1. and just as you're turning
[0:31] your bibles there
[0:32] i'd like to say a heartfelt appreciation
[0:35] for
[0:36] your tuning in this morning i know it's
[0:39] one thing to
[0:39] to come here in the congregation and to
[0:43] sit in the church but i think it's even
[0:46] more
[0:46] personal for you to invite me into your
[0:49] homes
[0:50] and i i pray that that's not out of
[0:54] an obligation to a church or out of
[0:56] favor to any man
[0:58] but i i believe that it's your desire to
[1:01] invite jesus christ into your homes this
[1:03] morning
[1:04] and so on behalf of our lord jesus i
[1:07] want to thank you
[1:08] for joining with us and playing the word
[1:11] and giving reverential respect and
[1:13] setting the dishes aside and trying to
[1:15] quiet your children as best as you can i
[1:18] know it's a struggle
[1:19] especially when there's distractions in
[1:21] the home for you with little ones god
[1:22] bless you
[1:24] and we just are going to all do our best
[1:26] this morning
[1:27] brother isaac and brother michael and i
[1:29] will do our very best to preach to you
[1:31] as if you were here with us and we
[1:33] believe that you'll
[1:34] do your best to just receive the word as
[1:37] if you were
[1:38] here with us without the distractions
[1:39] that might surround the home environment
[1:42] but thank you for inviting the lord
[1:43] jesus into your home this morning
[1:46] psalms 91 and verse 5.
[1:54] pardon me
[1:58] we'll just start with verse 5 he says
[2:01] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[2:04] by night
[2:05] nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor
[2:08] for the pestleth
[2:09] pestilence that walketh in darkness nor
[2:12] for the destruction that wasteth
[2:14] at noonday a thousand shall fall by thy
[2:17] sign
[2:18] and ten thousand at thy right hand but
[2:21] it shall not
[2:22] come nigh thee i think we've heard this
[2:24] verse many times this year
[2:26] as we've turned to psalm 91 for comfort
[2:29] but i don't want to just focus on that
[2:31] verse but if we can go back to verse 1
[2:34] and look at the scripture here it says
[2:38] it's it's addressing this chapter
[2:41] to a certain kind of man a certain kind
[2:45] of believer
[2:46] it's not just anyone that has these
[2:48] promises but the address
[2:50] the opening address of this scripture is
[2:52] he that dwelleth
[2:54] in the secret place of the most high
[2:58] shall abide under the shadow of the
[3:00] almighty
[3:01] i want you to hold that in your hearts
[3:02] this morning as we go along
[3:04] we'll turn over to psalms 32.
[3:11] and brother isaac i'm sorry if we can
[3:13] just get a little bit less in the
[3:15] the high feedback there i'm hearing my
[3:19] s's just a little bit too much and it's
[3:20] distracting me i think with
[3:22] all the bodies we have those sound
[3:23] absorptions but it's a little bit
[3:25] of a difficult technical challenge this
[3:28] morning first time we've
[3:30] dealt with quite this environment in the
[3:31] new sanctuary so you'll just
[3:33] be patient with us as we work through
[3:35] some of the
[3:37] sound issues here
[3:40] psalms 32 and 5. it says i acknowledge
[3:44] my sin and thee and my nicu have i not
[3:47] hid
[3:48] i said i will confess my transgressions
[3:50] unto the lord
[3:52] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[3:54] sin
[3:56] see again this is the prerequisite to
[3:57] the next verse
[3:59] a man that confesses and acknowledges
[4:01] his sin to the lord
[4:03] gets his whole heart clear before the
[4:05] lord knows that his heart has been
[4:07] forgiven
[4:08] and he says for this shall everyone that
[4:10] is godly pray unto thee
[4:12] and a time when thou mayest
[4:16] be found surely in the floods
[4:20] of great waters those great waters shall
[4:24] not come nigh unto this man
[4:29] in second peter chapter one
[4:32] just to find give a final context to the
[4:34] subject that we'd like to take this
[4:36] morning
[4:37] second peter 1 and verse 19.
[4:43] peter saying here reminding us
[4:47] we have also a more sure
[4:50] word of prophecy where do you do well to
[4:54] take heed
[4:55] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[4:57] day
[4:58] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[5:01] the daystar
[5:02] arise in your hearts
[5:05] dear lord we just pray that you'd bless
[5:08] the reading of your word lord
[5:10] as we sit at your feet this morning may
[5:12] you take it and break it to our hearts
[5:14] in jesus christ's name amen
[5:18] for a subject this morning i'd like to
[5:19] take the thought
[5:21] living in a time of certainty
[5:25] living in a time of certainty
[5:30] and you might recall last time we were
[5:32] shut down i i had the
[5:34] the honor and privilege to be able to
[5:36] break the word with you
[5:37] and we we broke it along the lines of
[5:40] finding certainty in uncertain times
[5:44] so if you if you remember that you might
[5:45] be thinking i'm i'm kind of
[5:47] contradicting myself from the last time
[5:49] that we
[5:49] had fellowship together in this way to
[5:52] take a topic of
[5:54] living in a time of certainty but i i
[5:57] believe that
[5:59] there's a different side of it that i
[6:00] just like to take because
[6:02] on one hand these are very uncertain
[6:05] times
[6:06] but if we take the other side of it
[6:08] we're actually living in the most
[6:10] certain time that the gentile church has
[6:13] ever lived
[6:14] and i'd like to look at the positive
[6:16] side of it this morning how many would
[6:18] like to look at the positive side of the
[6:20] word of jesus christ this morning
[6:22] did you know that for the believer
[6:23] there's no
[6:25] there's no side of the gospel that's not
[6:27] positive for the believer
[6:29] it's like our precious brother paul says
[6:31] the future is so bright i have to put
[6:33] sunglasses on just to look at it and
[6:36] we're looking at a gospel we're looking
[6:37] at a word of jesus christ that when
[6:39] when moses looked at the hindu parts of
[6:41] a man it made his
[6:43] face naturally to shine so bright that
[6:45] the children of israel couldn't even
[6:47] look upon them
[6:48] but we're not looking at the hindu parts
[6:50] of a man this morning
[6:51] we're looking at the revealed word of
[6:53] god
[6:55] so on one hand yes we can say these are
[6:57] times of uncertainty
[6:59] like never before man's hearts are
[7:02] failing them
[7:03] for fear it's a time of anxiety
[7:06] more people are on on anxiety pills and
[7:09] medications than ever before
[7:13] it's a it's a billion dollar industry
[7:15] i'm sure
[7:17] it's a time of depression and suicide
[7:19] rates and man
[7:20] trying to find some escape somewhere and
[7:23] even as they try to find
[7:25] some escape the the government braces to
[7:27] allow it
[7:28] they open up the doors for marijuana and
[7:31] open up the doors for drugs because
[7:33] people are looking for an escape
[7:34] somewhere
[7:35] as a society the waves are turning they
[7:38] say
[7:38] whatever it takes i'll let anything into
[7:40] my life i'll let anything into my home
[7:43] just so i can find some sense of relief
[7:46] that's the world that we live in but
[7:49] that's not the world that we're a part
[7:51] of
[7:51] and i want to remind you this morning
[7:53] that the world that we're a part of does
[7:55] not require
[7:56] the solutions of man because god from
[7:58] the foundation of the world
[8:00] has provided a solution for his little
[8:02] bride if shall just take hold of it with
[8:04] all of her heart
[8:06] we're living in a time when man does not
[8:09] know what to believe
[8:11] we listed what we to believe will
[8:13] fluctuate depending on what
[8:15] internet site we go to depending upon
[8:18] what
[8:18] multi-media we partake in
[8:21] depending upon what instagram account we
[8:23] load or depending upon what channel
[8:26] and news source we get our information
[8:29] from
[8:31] and then that result is man's mind is
[8:34] divided
[8:35] the bible says that a double-minded man
[8:38] is unstable in all of his ways
[8:41] and we find that this entire nation is
[8:43] divided
[8:44] and double minded and nobody hardly
[8:47] could be honest and say they certainly
[8:49] know what's going on
[8:50] they might take an opinion here they
[8:52] might take a stand here but there's
[8:54] always some little shadow of a second
[8:56] guessing
[8:57] there's no place for a man to
[9:01] find shorty there's no place for a man
[9:03] to
[9:04] escape the uncertainty there's no place
[9:07] for a man
[9:08] to escape the unstability of double
[9:10] mindedness
[9:11] except for the word of god this morning
[9:14] and that's why i i'm so happy i'm so
[9:16] pleased i'm so excited this morning to
[9:19] be able to preach the only thing that a
[9:21] man
[9:21] can put his feet upon and say i know
[9:24] that i know that i know that i stand
[9:26] upon the rock of ages
[9:27] and from here i shall not be moved i'll
[9:30] be
[9:31] moved from fox news i'll be moved from
[9:33] cnn i'll be moved from politics
[9:35] but there's one thing i cannot be moved
[9:37] from and if i just place my life upon
[9:40] the word of god
[9:41] forget the conspiracy theories forget
[9:43] what man is trying to conceive
[9:45] we know what god conceived from the
[9:48] phone base of the world
[9:50] oh hallelujah i see some brothers and
[9:53] sisters posting on facebook and i know
[9:55] that
[9:55] the times are are wearing on you brother
[9:58] the times are
[9:59] wearing on you sister because i see
[10:01] there's a strain
[10:03] to try to figure out what it is that
[10:04] man's trying to do
[10:07] get your eyes off of that let's get our
[10:10] eyes back
[10:11] on jesus christ looking unto jesus
[10:15] the author and the finisher of our faith
[10:20] you'll wear yourself out trying to
[10:21] figure out what man is trying to do
[10:24] but we live in a certain time where god
[10:27] has made it plain before us
[10:29] he's written the vision playing upon the
[10:31] tables
[10:32] if you'll just look at it and you'll
[10:34] find certainty
[10:36] in the voice of god i believe he'll do
[10:39] that for you this morning
[10:42] all things natural are now uncertain
[10:45] those that had stable jobs we don't know
[10:48] what this
[10:49] next year holds we don't know where our
[10:51] bread might come from
[10:54] we can look back to the previous
[10:56] financial crisis he is
[10:58] 2009 in the economic collapse
[11:01] we know that a bubble happened before
[11:02] that too much
[11:05] optimism too much falseness that was
[11:07] built in the economic system
[11:10] now we look and we see our
[11:13] economy hindered and haltered
[11:16] shut down and yet the stock market
[11:18] continues to rise
[11:20] it's all a farce you can't put
[11:22] confidence in it
[11:25] i can tell you i i can't put confidence
[11:27] in it
[11:28] you you want to be able to make natural
[11:31] decisions but there's no confidence in
[11:33] it
[11:35] we can look back to the 2009 economic
[11:37] collapse and i can say
[11:39] my employer weathered it okay i should
[11:42] be fine for this one
[11:43] but there's never been a time like this
[11:45] one naturally speaking
[11:47] there's no precedent for what we're
[11:48] going through we don't know what will be
[11:50] on the other side of this
[11:52] though biden and politicians and man
[11:55] says
[11:56] peace and safety yet we know
[11:59] that peace and safety is becoming less
[12:00] and less and this world is becoming
[12:03] less stable so as we preached last time
[12:08] all things natural are now uncertain our
[12:10] jobs our finances
[12:14] our own health our family's health
[12:17] you can't be sure about any of that
[12:21] and as we preached last time just some
[12:23] some natural things for you to
[12:26] help with that just the way that we look
[12:29] at
[12:30] the lord and the way that we where we
[12:32] put our confidence we
[12:33] we preached about those things and try
[12:35] to
[12:36] sympathize with the natural state that
[12:38] we're in because we still
[12:40] within this frame we're still a human
[12:42] frame
[12:43] but this morning i like to preach the
[12:46] other side of it
[12:47] i'd like to preach where we're really at
[12:50] spiritually
[12:52] oh i'm gonna need some water for this
[12:58] you're praying for me this morning
[13:00] aren't you praise the lord
[13:02] got my amen bench here brother brother
[13:05] isaac and brother michael i hear those
[13:09] so on the one hand everything is
[13:12] uncertain but on the other hand
[13:17] everything is still certain spiritually
[13:19] speaking
[13:21] as we read in the scripture we've
[13:22] received a more sure word of prophecy
[13:26] we've received something that will hold
[13:28] us through this time
[13:31] i just think about the sure word of
[13:33] prophecy that
[13:34] and down through the church ages how how
[13:36] god in his
[13:37] in his time and in his sovereignty
[13:40] injected himself
[13:41] into the church age through his
[13:44] messenger
[13:46] just exactly what they needed for that
[13:47] age to hold them
[13:49] you look at even down through mark
[13:53] martin luther and then justification
[13:56] then
[13:56] wesley with sanctification and and and
[13:59] pentecostal age starting out here with
[14:02] laodicea and the baptism of the holy
[14:04] ghost and the restoration of the gifts
[14:06] all those things gave them certainty in
[14:09] their time
[14:11] and i i'd like to take a moment and just
[14:13] say there's still
[14:14] certainty for those people i just think
[14:17] about
[14:17] martin luther here he was nailing 95
[14:21] pieces to a door of a church over 500
[14:23] years ago
[14:25] talking about the justice the just shall
[14:27] live by faith
[14:28] in a time of uncertainty think about
[14:31] that
[14:32] how uncertain the dark ages were even
[14:35] spiritually speaking the
[14:37] church was selling indulgences that you
[14:39] could buy
[14:40] off your sins and and buy off your
[14:42] mistakes and
[14:43] and buy off that your your perverted
[14:46] nature
[14:46] and you could still find a way to heaven
[14:48] if you could just buy your way
[14:50] into it the church was all offering
[14:52] indulgences and
[14:53] if you couldn't afford the indulgences
[14:55] well i suppose you could do enough
[14:56] penance that
[14:57] that you would somehow earn your way
[14:59] into heaven
[15:01] but during that time of uncertainty
[15:05] god provided a messenger for that day
[15:08] that came and preached that the just
[15:10] shall live by faith that is not
[15:12] by works but salvation is a free gift of
[15:15] god
[15:17] oh hallelujah and there were men and
[15:19] women that grabbed a hold of it in that
[15:21] age
[15:21] and that message of the day saved them
[15:25] hallelujah and i'd like to say this
[15:28] morning
[15:28] that there are still millions of
[15:30] believers around the world
[15:32] millions of those that are holding on to
[15:35] one thing that was preached 500 years
[15:37] ago
[15:38] the just shall live by faith they may
[15:41] not take a rapture with you with just
[15:43] that revelation
[15:44] but there's a promise to them that if
[15:46] they'll hold on to that revelation
[15:48] then they'll see them all the way
[15:50] through a tribulation
[15:52] oh hallelujah you want to see that in
[15:54] the word this morning
[15:56] let's let's take a moment to establish
[15:58] that one
[15:59] turn over to revelations chapter 7 with
[16:02] me
[16:04] i was enjoying this so much last night
[16:06] re-reading it i i gotta share it with
[16:08] you again
[16:11] revelations chapter seven and verse nine
[16:16] here john is seeing the vision
[16:21] and he says after this i beheld and lo
[16:24] a great multitude which no man can
[16:27] number
[16:28] of all nations and kindred
[16:32] and tongues stood before the throne
[16:35] and before the lamb clothed with white
[16:38] robes
[16:39] and palms in their hand verse 10 and
[16:42] cried with a loud voice saying
[16:45] salvation to our god which sitteth upon
[16:47] the throne
[16:48] and unto the lamb go down to verse 13
[16:52] and it says and one of the elders
[16:54] answered saying unto me
[16:56] what are these things what are these
[16:57] which are rave
[16:59] and white robes and john said
[17:02] well you know he said
[17:06] once came they the man asked him and
[17:09] john said
[17:10] sir thou knowest and the ansel said unto
[17:13] him
[17:14] these are they which came out of the
[17:17] great tribulation
[17:21] and have washed the robes and made them
[17:24] white
[17:25] with the blood of the lamb
[17:29] friends your your friends that might be
[17:32] in a baptist church somewhere
[17:34] and you've been trying to witness this
[17:36] message to them they might be in a
[17:38] methodist church somewhere and you've
[17:39] been trying to witness this message to
[17:41] them
[17:42] and maybe you you're like me where i was
[17:44] out one day and i wanted to know
[17:47] what will be their end if they don't get
[17:50] more revelation from this last day
[17:52] if they don't come along underneath this
[17:54] message
[17:55] of malachi 4 5 and 6 what will be their
[17:58] end
[18:00] here it is you can find your friends in
[18:03] scripture
[18:03] you can find your family members in
[18:05] scripture
[18:07] here's their end revelations 7
[18:10] 15 therefore are they before the throne
[18:14] of god
[18:15] and serve him day and night in his
[18:18] temple
[18:20] he that sitteth on the throne shall
[18:22] dwell among them
[18:24] they're not pushed out for his prayer
[18:26] from his presence they're not some
[18:28] lower tier that don't even get to come
[18:30] into the presence of god
[18:31] they're not some way midway between
[18:33] being cast out of the presence
[18:35] of god in hell or but not quite being in
[18:37] his presence
[18:38] for here at the very throne of god
[18:42] and he's dwelling amongst them oh
[18:45] hallelujah
[18:46] that doesn't make you happy this morning
[18:48] friends
[18:50] i i want to say that this message is not
[18:53] something
[18:54] that sets up a religious structure and
[18:56] says you've got to believe what we
[18:58] believe
[18:59] or else you're out this message
[19:02] is jesus christ it is the revelation of
[19:06] god the mighty god unveiled before us
[19:09] the same god that sent his son jesus to
[19:12] this earth
[19:13] that we could not perish but where we
[19:16] could believe on him
[19:17] because he wanted to save the whole
[19:19] world i don't know that we'll know how
[19:22] far
[19:23] this message this jesus christ this
[19:25] great god draws his circle until we get
[19:27] to the other side
[19:28] but he's not a god that draws people out
[19:31] he's a
[19:32] god that draws people into himself
[19:36] i've got friends there in the catholic
[19:37] church this morning
[19:39] and they would probably tell you that
[19:41] unless i come to their way of seeing
[19:43] things
[19:44] but they were honest with their beliefs
[19:46] and told me straight they don't believe
[19:48] there will be salvation for me
[19:50] but i can tell you this morning that i
[19:52] know that for them
[19:54] so long as their faith is in jesus
[19:56] christ
[19:57] for by faith are you saved through
[19:59] christ
[20:01] and their faith is not in the system
[20:03] alone
[20:04] then i believe seeing this scripture
[20:06] that i'll see them there
[20:08] in the presence of the almighty god and
[20:11] that their end is
[20:12] continued and said in verse 16 they'll
[20:15] hunger no more neither thirst anymore
[20:19] neither shall the sun light on them nor
[20:22] any heat
[20:23] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[20:25] the throne shall feed them and shall
[20:26] lead them
[20:27] unto the living waters oh hallelujah
[20:30] you may not have been able to lead them
[20:32] fully unto the living waters
[20:34] but there is a day coming if they'll
[20:36] just hold on to a revelation
[20:39] that was instructed 500 plus years ago
[20:42] by a faithful messenger martin luther
[20:46] the just shall live by faith if they
[20:48] just hold on to that simple
[20:50] scarlet red thread it'll carry them all
[20:53] the way through
[20:54] and one day the lamb himself shall be
[20:57] able to do what you cannot do for your
[20:59] friends and your family
[21:01] he'll lead them unto the living waters
[21:04] oh think of it friends
[21:07] pause and think of that for a moment
[21:10] but here we have
[21:15] a message that was given 500 years ago
[21:19] and yet today as we face the greatest
[21:21] tribulation
[21:22] this world has ever faced before the
[21:25] great tribulation that's been promised
[21:27] since the very beginning of christendom
[21:30] a 500 year old revelation
[21:32] given underneath a past church age
[21:35] will be strong enough to see them
[21:37] through it
[21:39] oh hallelujah remember brother branham
[21:42] said i never condemn the people
[21:44] that are in the systems but i condemn
[21:46] the systems
[21:48] and it will be that very tribulation
[21:50] that condemns the systems and judges
[21:52] those systems
[21:53] and out of the ashes of that system
[21:57] out of the ashes of that system there
[21:58] will be a people rise just like
[22:00] rahab who was holding on to a scarlet
[22:03] red thread
[22:04] and now the ashes and the rubble of
[22:06] jericho she was preserved there will be
[22:08] a people
[22:09] hallelujah that will rise
[22:12] out of the ashes of tribulation out of
[22:14] the ashes of the baptist system
[22:16] out of the ashes of the methodist system
[22:19] out of the asses of the pentecostal
[22:21] system
[22:21] out of the asses of the catholic system
[22:24] of the ashes of all those things
[22:26] previously believers that were bound
[22:29] by creeds and dogmas will rise free
[22:33] and liberated and they'll be led unto
[22:35] the fountains of living waters by the
[22:37] lamb himself
[22:39] oh friends that makes me joyous this
[22:43] morning
[22:45] that makes me so happy you might say of
[22:47] your family members this morning
[22:50] they're unbelievers total unbelievers
[22:53] and
[22:54] their life is so far removed from what
[22:57] we live
[22:58] it seems like it would be such a long
[22:59] journey
[23:02] to get them from their drinking and
[23:04] their crowsing on and
[23:09] the way they dress and the way they act
[23:11] to what we hold dear here
[23:15] friends remember the first thing
[23:18] is getting them to jesus christ
[23:22] get them to calvary get them to the
[23:25] cross
[23:26] that's never lost its significance
[23:29] brother branham himself said the whole
[23:31] old testament looks
[23:32] towards the cross and the whole new
[23:34] testament
[23:35] looks back towards it we're never beyond
[23:38] the cross friends
[23:41] i'll tell you what if you can't get them
[23:43] to darken the door of a message church
[23:44] don't give up on them
[23:46] don't give up on that unbelieving friend
[23:48] of yours don't give up on that
[23:49] unbeliever
[23:50] that's a family member or what have you
[23:54] just preaching to them like peter did
[23:56] when he
[23:58] met the uh the eunuch
[24:01] there he said he preached unto him jesus
[24:05] just start preaching there friend just
[24:08] start sharing what hope you have in
[24:10] christ start
[24:12] sharing a picture of calvary the here
[24:16] we just came through christmas great
[24:18] time
[24:19] to reflect upon the gospel story that
[24:21] the mighty god came down
[24:23] and revealed himself in a little babe
[24:26] spent his time amongst us
[24:30] took off the layers as it were and
[24:31] showed us who god was
[24:33] and then went to calvary that our sins
[24:36] would be forgiven
[24:37] he would be the perfect sacrifice and
[24:40] arise again in triumph over
[24:42] everything that we find guilt in
[24:45] every sin every abomination every fallen
[24:48] nature
[24:51] you may not be able to get them any
[24:52] further than that friends
[24:54] but get them to that at least it'll
[24:57] it's powerful enough it may seem
[24:59] old-fashioned to some of us
[25:01] but it's powerful enough that though
[25:04] it's 2000 years old
[25:06] and it came and was revitalized in the
[25:08] dark ages still 500 years ago it's
[25:10] powerful enough to get them
[25:13] through a tribulation that we're
[25:15] certainly facing now
[25:18] think of that if you can't get them to
[25:20] darken the doors of a
[25:22] message church get them to darken some
[25:24] old good baptist church somewhere that
[25:26] preaches the word still
[25:28] get them to preach get them to darken
[25:30] the doors of a methodist church that
[25:31] still thumps the bible as it were
[25:35] make sure in getting them there though
[25:37] that you bind their hearts and souls
[25:40] not to that system because it will
[25:42] perish in the tribulation
[25:44] but bind their hearts and souls to
[25:47] calvary
[25:48] if they'll hold fast there no matter
[25:51] what happens
[25:53] the whole thing can fall apart around
[25:55] them just like jericho fell apart around
[25:57] rahab
[25:58] and yet they'll be standing at the last
[25:59] day because the scripture says they'll
[26:01] be dressed there
[26:03] in robes of white oh hallelujah
[26:08] praise the lord
[26:13] remember those people that are in those
[26:14] systems there
[26:16] they're not potential believers
[26:20] they may be blinded by their systems
[26:23] they may be bound by creation dogmas
[26:27] but they're still our brother and our
[26:29] sister
[26:30] and many of them the bible here says
[26:32] millions
[26:33] an untold multitude is what it says
[26:36] could not be numbered
[26:37] we'll be there and we'll get to be able
[26:39] to
[26:40] fellowship with them without creeds and
[26:43] dogmas without
[26:45] the binds and the fetters oh i'm looking
[26:48] forward to the day friends
[26:49] not the day that we can say i was right
[26:51] and you were wrong but we have the day
[26:53] that we can both all
[26:54] sit together in unity as a body of jesus
[26:56] christ
[26:58] oh i hope that picture of the other side
[27:01] brightens your souls this morning
[27:04] amen
[27:07] but we want to preach the other side of
[27:08] it still
[27:11] the certainty of god's word
[27:15] here we have justification that just
[27:17] shall live by faith
[27:18] think of it that message alone that if
[27:21] someone can just tie their souls
[27:23] onto it and hold fast no matter what
[27:26] happens
[27:27] it'll carry them all the way through a
[27:29] tribulation
[27:30] how much more powerful then is a message
[27:33] that was promised
[27:36] from time immemorial even to the time of
[27:39] the prophets
[27:40] that it would be able to dress the bride
[27:42] for a rapture
[27:44] how much more effective how much more
[27:46] powerful is this malachi
[27:48] 4-5 ministry that you are under that
[27:51] your children are under that your
[27:52] grandchildren are under
[27:56] we're living now within a laodicean age
[27:59] surrounded by a lukewarm church
[28:03] with only tribulation laying before her
[28:06] for the lukewarm church the church
[28:08] cardinal that is the only certainty that
[28:10] she has
[28:11] and i might say this the promise is
[28:15] if she can hold fast through that
[28:17] tribulation
[28:19] then she'll be able to be dressed in
[28:20] white but without the seal of god upon
[28:23] her
[28:24] there's still no certainty think of that
[28:27] that they could let go of that
[28:28] revelation that somehow they could be
[28:30] shaken from it
[28:31] that they could be shaken from the
[28:32] revelation of justification
[28:34] when everything starts letting loose
[28:36] they can be shaken from it
[28:38] that's why we don't want to leave people
[28:40] that justification
[28:41] there's no certainty there the only
[28:43] thing that's certain
[28:44] is that they or they will be a
[28:46] tribulation there will be a shaking
[28:48] and if they can hold on if they can be
[28:51] victorious in that time
[28:52] then there's a reward waiting for them
[28:54] at the end but
[28:56] now is the day of your salvation now is
[28:59] the day that god can be found
[29:01] now is the day that god has revealed
[29:03] himself and said
[29:04] there's more of me still there's there's
[29:06] more of me than just
[29:07] justification sanctification there's a
[29:10] seal of god that's waiting to be set
[29:12] upon your forehead
[29:13] if only you'll be obedient to me and
[29:16] follow after my word that's been
[29:17] revealed in this age
[29:19] oh hallelujah that is the certainty
[29:22] that's waiting for the believer
[29:24] that's the certainty that i want friends
[29:26] not the certainty of tribulation
[29:28] not the uncertainty of my job but i want
[29:30] to focus this morning
[29:32] on making sure that my life is standing
[29:34] certain before god
[29:38] hallelujah
[29:40] for in this bright age i'd like to say
[29:43] with confidence this morning
[29:45] that there is no more certain age
[29:49] in all of the church history
[29:52] an age within an age as it were though
[29:55] we're surrounded by the laodicean church
[29:57] age
[29:58] by this message of malachi 4 the bride
[30:02] has been
[30:02] caught up into a special place where
[30:05] she's been presented
[30:06] the certainty of a rapture the certainty
[30:10] of fellowship with her husband the
[30:12] certainty
[30:13] of a wedding shepherd the certainty of a
[30:15] millennial reign
[30:17] and in that certainty if you can just
[30:19] become lost in that certainty
[30:21] all the uncertainty down here at earth
[30:23] will just fade away underneath of your
[30:25] footsteps
[30:26] as you look towards jesus christ and his
[30:28] promises this morning
[30:32] for the laodicean church the lukewarm
[30:34] believer there is no certainty
[30:37] but for the bride those who have
[30:40] yielded themselves to the call that have
[30:43] made sure that their
[30:44] oil is not gone out in their lambs there
[30:47] is a certainty that's waiting for
[30:51] you you might ask me this morning
[30:53] brother josiah how can you say that
[30:55] how can you say that there's no other
[30:57] time in history
[30:58] where things have been more certain it's
[31:01] because
[31:03] today we can look back through this
[31:05] malachi 4-5 ministry
[31:07] and know exactly where we're at
[31:12] the churches in martin luther's time
[31:14] didn't know what church stage they were
[31:16] in
[31:17] the churches in the time of paul were
[31:20] looking
[31:20] towards the coming of the lord
[31:24] they were hoping that it would be soon
[31:27] but now we can look
[31:28] past all the confusion and look
[31:31] back and see the whole plan of god laid
[31:34] out before us
[31:36] through the seven church ages and know
[31:39] positionally
[31:40] exactly where we are at today we know
[31:43] that we are at the threshold
[31:45] of god's great promise of a rapture to
[31:48] wrap up
[31:49] these this gentile church and turn
[31:52] towards israel
[31:54] so i can say there is no more
[31:57] certain time in the church history
[32:00] we know exactly where we're at this
[32:02] morning oh hallelujah
[32:05] amen brother think of that
[32:09] so don't get lost in all the uncertainty
[32:12] that's surrounding you
[32:13] but up here caught up with jesus christ
[32:16] you have a precious certainty
[32:19] not only do we know positionally where
[32:21] the church is at
[32:22] but like never before we know who all
[32:25] the other players are
[32:27] the seven seals have been revealed we
[32:29] know who the
[32:31] white horse rider is we know what his
[32:34] horse is down to the ages the white
[32:36] horse and the black horse
[32:37] and the red horse and the pale horse we
[32:39] know who all the players are we know who
[32:41] the souls underneath the altar are
[32:43] we know who those that are that
[32:46] who go through the tribulation and we
[32:48] know who those are
[32:50] that are caught up with jesus christ we
[32:52] may not be able to point them out on the
[32:53] street but we know
[32:55] who the actors are it's more clear than
[32:58] ever before
[33:00] and more clear than ever before we know
[33:03] the mind of jesus christ
[33:06] hallelujah
[33:09] more than ever before god has revealed
[33:12] himself
[33:13] the very mystery of god has been
[33:15] revealed
[33:17] god has it's no longer as i said it's no
[33:19] longer looking
[33:20] at the hinder parts of a man but through
[33:23] this malachi
[33:24] 4 5 ministry god has revealed himself
[33:27] more plainly than ever before and you
[33:30] can go
[33:31] and you can look upon him like man has
[33:34] never been able to look
[33:35] upon him before we know that
[33:38] who jesus christ is that it's god
[33:40] himself made flesh and
[33:42] the the vehicle or the the vessel that
[33:44] god used to reveal himself to our just
[33:47] not the third person of eternity when we
[33:49] when we pray we're not praying
[33:52] one day to god and one day to god the
[33:54] father and one day to god the son
[33:56] one day to god the holy spirit we know
[33:58] who it is that we're praying to
[34:00] we know who it is that we're serving and
[34:02] we know who it is that's beckoning us to
[34:04] a marriage supper
[34:05] because right now in this present time
[34:08] the bride is making a marriage
[34:10] union with that lord jesus christ
[34:14] she knows who he is
[34:17] she knows that it's god himself she
[34:19] knows that he's the tree of life
[34:22] and she can recognize the tree of the
[34:24] knowledge of good and evil and run from
[34:26] it
[34:28] she knows that he is the one that's
[34:30] sitting upon the throne in revelations
[34:32] she can find him in scripture though he
[34:35] was hidden in scripture all this time
[34:37] she can read from genesis to revelation
[34:39] and find her lover
[34:40] her lord but it's not only that she
[34:43] knows who he is
[34:44] but she knows who she is this bride like
[34:48] never before
[34:49] knows positively who she is as the bride
[34:52] of jesus christ
[34:54] oh hallelujah she knows that she's
[34:57] baptized into his body
[34:59] that she's made one with him for by one
[35:02] spirit are we all baptized into one body
[35:05] the body of the lord jesus christ oh
[35:08] hallelujah
[35:11] she knows that she's a partaker of his
[35:13] spirit that she's in union with him
[35:16] she knows that she's in union with him
[35:19] the word there's no question in her mind
[35:23] who he is or who she's coming into union
[35:25] with because
[35:26] that word has been made plain through
[35:29] this last day message
[35:34] and she's found her identity in this
[35:37] lord jesus christ oh i hope
[35:41] you can say that you are seed this
[35:42] morning friends
[35:44] i hope that you can have that certainty
[35:47] that you found your identity in christ
[35:50] this bride has the opportunity to put
[35:53] off the old man
[35:55] and put on the new jesus christ to take
[35:58] on a new identity that's not defined by
[36:00] her genetics and how she looks naturally
[36:03] and
[36:04] what the kids at school said about her
[36:06] when she was growing up and
[36:07] what evil things she did when she was a
[36:11] young person
[36:11] sowing her wild oats she's not defined
[36:15] by her past
[36:16] she's not defined by what other people
[36:19] did to her that was wrong or mean
[36:21] or harmful she's not defined any longer
[36:24] by her old nature because that old
[36:27] nature that carnal man
[36:29] has been destroyed
[36:33] she's not defined any longer by being
[36:36] four eyes or
[36:37] being fat or too skinny or or
[36:40] not being a good singer or not being
[36:42] good at this or that
[36:44] but she has come into the presence
[36:47] of one who's never done her any harm
[36:52] she has come into the presence of one
[36:55] who tells her
[36:56] there is no spot in you
[37:00] thou art all together beautiful
[37:03] my love oh
[37:06] heavenly lover covers now i pray
[37:10] and he has covered her he's covered her
[37:13] inside a little place like a tent where
[37:17] it's
[37:17] pushed out all the other lovers of her
[37:20] past life
[37:22] it's pushed out all the naysayers it's
[37:25] pushed out
[37:25] all the denominational sisters that
[37:28] maybe
[37:28] spit in her eye it's pushed out all the
[37:31] kids at school that said the mean things
[37:33] to her
[37:34] it's pushed out the voice the boss at
[37:36] work it's pushed out
[37:38] every single distraction she's come
[37:42] into the presence of one
[37:45] one person who matters more to her than
[37:48] any other
[37:49] and she has laid aside everything for
[37:52] this one
[37:53] lord jesus christ and he came
[37:56] and revealed herself himself to her got
[37:59] down on one knee as it were
[38:03] and propose to her would you take my
[38:05] token
[38:07] the god of all mankind
[38:11] making himself vulnerable to a gentile
[38:14] bride
[38:15] and asking her would you come and be
[38:19] my bride and take this token
[38:23] and this woman
[38:28] she's accepted it oh hallelujah
[38:32] i hope i'm talking about you this
[38:34] morning she's accepted
[38:36] a token of the holy ghost
[38:40] a seal hallelujah
[38:45] she's accepted a seal she's not holding
[38:49] on to just
[38:51] a revelation of justification
[38:56] where if she can just hold on long
[38:58] enough it'll bring her all the way
[39:00] through the tribulation
[39:02] but seas received the seal of god
[39:05] wherein god will say no no you can't
[39:08] touch this oil
[39:09] you can't touch this wine you can't
[39:11] touch this precious bride
[39:13] i'm taking her out of here coronavirus
[39:16] might surround her
[39:17] it might even rack her physical flesh
[39:20] but she will not be a partaker
[39:22] of this tribulation she will not have to
[39:25] go through it
[39:26] and she will not have to feel her fear
[39:28] for her soul
[39:29] because she has come into my presence
[39:31] and she has received me
[39:33] as i am and i have received her
[39:36] as she was from the foundation of the
[39:39] world
[39:40] and your identity friend as a bride is
[39:43] no longer dictated by what happened on
[39:46] this earth
[39:46] but how god saw you from the foundation
[39:49] the world
[39:50] and if you can't identify with with that
[39:52] this morning
[39:53] i want to invite you i want to invite
[39:56] you to come up from this cosmos this
[39:58] morning
[39:59] and choose not just faith over unbelief
[40:03] not just faith over fear but i want you
[40:05] to choose this morning
[40:07] to have certainty instead of uncertainty
[40:10] before you this morning for before some
[40:12] of you
[40:13] there lays before you still yet the
[40:15] choice
[40:17] of whom you will serve
[40:20] the devil and his pleasures offer
[40:23] certain
[40:24] pleasure like a flash in the pan but
[40:27] after that is certain death
[40:29] but god is here offering his blood
[40:33] and his holy spirit life
[40:37] eternal what will you choose
[40:43] in an age of uncertainty
[40:46] choose now to live in a time of
[40:49] certainty with jesus christ
[40:53] with a certain salvation and a certain
[40:57] relationship do you know that there's
[41:00] never been a time like this time
[41:02] the bride knew exactly who she was in
[41:05] relation to god
[41:08] sure down through time we understood
[41:10] that there was a bride
[41:12] down through time i believe that there
[41:13] were those that recognized that they
[41:15] were members of this bride
[41:18] but there was never a time
[41:21] when the bride stood so certain of her
[41:23] relationship with jesus christ
[41:25] because you cannot stand certain of a
[41:27] man
[41:28] until you know fully who he is
[41:31] and there's never been a time like this
[41:33] time
[41:34] that god has so mightily revealed
[41:37] himself through jesus christ
[41:38] that the bride stands certain of her
[41:41] lover
[41:42] and like never before that certainty of
[41:45] the man that has invited her
[41:46] to take the wedding token of the holy
[41:48] ghost
[41:51] by having that certainty she stands even
[41:54] more certain
[41:55] of herself because he is her headship
[41:59] and her covering and when a woman is
[42:01] certain of her husband
[42:05] and that man is in his place she is sure
[42:09] more certain of herself
[42:12] there's never been a time of certainty
[42:14] like today
[42:16] hallelujah oh just let's praise the lord
[42:19] for a minute
[42:21] that we could stand in times of
[42:23] uncertainty when the newspapers are
[42:24] filled with headlines like grim
[42:27] and all sorts of of words that paint a
[42:30] dark picture
[42:32] we can stand forth in a little room off
[42:35] to the side with our lover
[42:36] and say i don't know anything about it
[42:40] i just know one thing and that's my lord
[42:42] jesus christ
[42:44] i'm staring into his face and he's
[42:46] staring into mine
[42:48] and one day all this is just going to
[42:49] disappear but i'm not paying it any mind
[42:52] in the meantime
[42:55] he's provided a hiding place
[42:58] like our scripture at the beginning in
[43:00] psalms 91 said
[43:02] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[43:04] the most high
[43:05] shall abide under the shadow of the
[43:08] almighty
[43:10] it is a secret place but he's invited
[43:14] you to it this morning
[43:16] he invited you to it when he began to
[43:18] break forth the seals
[43:20] and began to preach forth a message
[43:22] through a last-day messenger
[43:24] he said come come away my little bride
[43:28] oh hallelujah come away with me
[43:31] the words of solomon come back to me
[43:34] take us the foxes
[43:35] the little foxes that spoil the vine
[43:38] let's deal with those now
[43:40] friends we don't want this precious
[43:42] relationship with jesus christ to be
[43:44] spoiled
[43:45] but let's enjoy it while the world is
[43:47] falling apart
[43:49] let's enjoy the certainty of the
[43:51] relationship of this hiding place that
[43:53] he's invited us
[43:54] to he's invited us
[43:58] underneath his cloak and he's made
[44:00] himself
[44:01] fully plain to us
[44:05] he's put himself in plain sight
[44:08] now the devil has been busy and where i
[44:11] look at jesus christ i can say off over
[44:13] here
[44:15] is the plainest picture of jesus christ
[44:17] that has ever been painted
[44:19] through the church ages or through all
[44:21] of time
[44:23] but between me and him and him satan has
[44:26] put up a lot of decoys
[44:27] and distractions to obfuscate your
[44:30] vision
[44:31] if you're having a hard time seeing
[44:33] jesus christ
[44:35] can i just encourage you start drawing
[44:38] towards him there's the picture of jesus
[44:41] christ there's a decoy here and a
[44:43] distraction over here
[44:44] just push it all aside get through there
[44:48] the bible says that if you'll draw an
[44:50] eye unto me
[44:51] i'll draw an eye unto you it's not just
[44:54] a picture of jesus christ on a wall that
[44:55] you've got to get to
[44:56] but it's a person of jesus christ if you
[44:59] draw an eye to him and push
[45:01] past all those distractions push past
[45:03] all that confusion
[45:04] push past all those decoys you'll find
[45:07] he's doing the same on his side
[45:09] he wants to be in relationship with you
[45:11] this morning friends
[45:13] maybe you feel like you've become
[45:15] distant from him for whatever reason i i
[45:17] don't know
[45:19] maybe because you've been distant from
[45:20] the church itself
[45:22] distant from the body distant from your
[45:24] bible
[45:25] i want to tell you this morning start
[45:27] pushing past it all
[45:29] because just beyond that false mirage of
[45:32] distance
[45:33] stands a very near jesus christ
[45:36] he says i am near to you a very
[45:39] present help in the time of need oh
[45:42] hallelujah
[45:43] there's a god standing near you it's
[45:46] like a false mirage like a
[45:48] little painting that satan's put out
[45:50] here makes him look way far away
[45:52] but if you just push past it you'll find
[45:54] that god standing right there
[45:58] you might have to push past a little bit
[45:59] of sin push past a little bit of
[46:01] iniquity
[46:03] like the psalmist and psalm 32 said i
[46:05] had to admit my
[46:06] mistakes i had to admit my iniquity but
[46:08] on the other side of that
[46:10] i found a very present god that promised
[46:13] me that these waters will not come nigh
[46:15] unto me
[46:16] oh friend don't let satan's mirage for
[46:20] you
[46:21] you might have said oh i i'm months out
[46:24] of the presence of god it'll
[46:26] feels like months to get back into his
[46:29] presence
[46:32] that's nothing but a lie of the enemy
[46:34] this morning he is just
[46:37] a call away a phone call away if i can
[46:40] say
[46:41] the bible says that if my people who are
[46:44] called by my name will humble themselves
[46:46] and pray
[46:47] i will hear from heaven and i'll come
[46:50] and heal their land
[46:52] i'm a very present help in time of need
[46:58] don't live in a time of uncertainty
[47:03] when there is a time of certainty
[47:05] available to you
[47:08] amen
[47:17] let's go before the lord
[47:22] dear lord i just come before you father
[47:28] thanking you so much lord
[47:31] for a time of certainty thanking you so
[47:35] much
[47:36] lord for making yourself so
[47:39] plain in this last day lord
[47:43] that we couldn't miss it lord so plain
[47:45] that we couldn't miss it
[47:47] but yet satan's been busy he's put up a
[47:49] lot of decoys
[47:51] i pray lord if there's anyone that feels
[47:52] like they're missing the revelation of
[47:54] jesus christ
[47:55] that they're missing out on a
[47:56] relationship with you that they're
[47:58] missing out on having certainty of their
[47:59] salvation
[48:00] certainty of their position with you
[48:02] certainly of knowing who they are and
[48:04] where they're going and where they came
[48:05] from
[48:06] and who you are oh lord i pray that you
[48:08] would
[48:09] fill them with certainty this morning
[48:10] lord not just a feeling lord
[48:13] but by a revelation as they draw an eye
[48:15] to you and you draw nigh to them this
[48:17] morning
[48:18] granite lord we pray in jesus christ's
[48:22] name
[48:22] lord in jesus name we thank you lord
[48:27] amen praise the lord
[48:30] praise the lord
[48:34] brother michael plays something softly
[48:38] i encourage you to think about what's
[48:39] been preached this morning
[48:43] [Music]
[48:45] i encourage you to remember that this
[48:48] message is not something that draws
[48:49] people
[48:50] out but it draws people in
[48:53] and it's god's grace to you this morning
[48:56] that's trying to draw you closer
[49:00] god has not cast you off this morning
[49:03] but god has given you a hiding place in
[49:05] him
[49:07] enjoy it if you're not enjoying it then
[49:10] go find it it's not hidden
[49:12] it's hidden from the world but it's not
[49:13] hidden from you little bride
[49:16] god has given you a way of escape from
[49:19] this world of
[49:20] uncertainty a pathway into his presence
[49:26] and their certainty and security await
[49:30] his little bride
[49:32] god bless you now friends pray you would
[49:34] enjoy your sunday
