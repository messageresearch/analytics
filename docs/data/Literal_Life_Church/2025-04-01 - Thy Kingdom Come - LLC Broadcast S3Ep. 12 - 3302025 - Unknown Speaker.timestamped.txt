[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at
[0:20] literalife.urch. May God bless you, my
[0:22] friend. May the music and message
[0:24] encourage you today.
[0:27] You are not a
[0:31] god
[0:33] created by human hands. And you are not
[0:37] a god
[0:40] depending on any mortal man. And you are
[0:44] not a god in need
[0:48] of anything we can give. You are
[0:54] God. That's just the way it is.
[1:01] [Music]
[1:04] You are not a
[1:05] God
[1:08] created by human
[1:11] hands. You are not a God
[1:15] dependent on any mortal man.
[1:20] You are not a God in need
[1:24] of anything we can give. You are your
[1:29] plan. That's just the way it is.
[1:34] [Music]
[1:37] You are God
[1:39] alone. From before time
[1:44] began, you were on your new throne.
[1:49] And you are God
[1:53] alone. And right
[1:56] now in the good times and
[2:00] bad you are on your
[2:04] throne and you are God alone.
[2:13] You are not a
[2:14] god
[2:16] depending none can
[2:19] contend. You're the only God whose name
[2:25] and praise will never end. You're the
[2:29] only God who's
[2:32] worthy of everything we can give. You
[2:37] are
[2:38] God and that's just the way it
[2:45] is. And you are God
[2:49] alone. And before time
[2:53] begin, you are on your
[2:57] throne and you are God alone.
[3:03] And right
[3:05] now in the good times and
[3:09] bad you are on your
[3:13] throne and you are God
[3:18] alone. You are God
[3:21] alone from before time began.
[3:27] You
[3:28] [Music]
[3:29] are. Oh, you are
[3:35] God. And right
[3:37] now in the good times and
[3:42] bad. You
[3:44] [Music]
[3:46] are. You are
[3:51] God. You're unchangeable.
[3:56] You're
[3:57] [Music]
[3:59] unshakeable. You're
[4:03] unstoppable.
[4:06] That's unchangeable.
[4:11] Unchangeable. You're
[4:13] [Music]
[4:15] unshakeable. You're
[4:17] [Music]
[4:19] unstoppable. That's who you are.
[4:26] You are your God
[4:29] alone before
[4:33] time. You are on your
[4:37] throne. You are
[4:42] God. And right
[4:45] now in the good
[4:49] times you are on your throne.
[4:54] You are God
[4:58] alone and right
[5:01] now in the good times and
[5:06] bad. You are on your
[5:10] throne and you are God alone.
[5:16] Esther chapter 4 and uh verse 10 again.
[5:21] Esther spake unto Hayetch and gave him
[5:24] commandment unto
[5:26] Morortei. All the king's servants and
[5:28] the people of the king's provinces do
[5:30] know that whosoever, whether man or
[5:33] woman, shall come unto the king into the
[5:35] inner court, who was not called, there
[5:39] is one law of his to put him to death,
[5:42] except such to whom the king shall hold
[5:45] out his golden scepter that he may live.
[5:49] but I have not been called to come in
[5:50] unto the king these 30 days. And they
[5:53] told to Mori Esther's words. So she sent
[5:56] back word to Mori after we know that a
[6:00] letter was written by Hmon to destroy
[6:03] Esther's people and the destruction of
[6:06] them. Then Mori goes into fasting and
[6:09] praying and he asked Esther to do
[6:11] something and she said, "Well, there's a
[6:14] lot of hurdles to that and unless I'm
[6:17] summoned by the king, that's the law
[6:19] that I would be killed." Anyone would be
[6:21] killed if they're not summoned to the
[6:22] king. Verse 13, then Moria commanded to
[6:26] answer Esther, "Think not with thyself
[6:28] that thou shalt escape in the king's
[6:31] house more than all the Jews. For if
[6:33] thou altogether holdest thy peace at
[6:36] this time, and I want you to hold on to
[6:39] that little comment. If she must have
[6:42] been she must have had a pretty
[6:45] important position in all this. And she
[6:49] really didn't even know how important
[6:51] her position
[6:52] was. Everybody else would be squelched
[6:55] and everybody else could hold their
[6:56] peace. But if
[6:58] Esther held her peace, then it's a
[7:01] problem because she's really the one
[7:03] that had the
[7:04] authority to pray and say something to
[7:08] the king about it. I want you to notice
[7:10] now Esther's a type of the bride and
[7:12] we're living in a time there's a lot of
[7:14] people pray, but there are people
[7:16] positioned that what they say and what
[7:18] they pray calls upon greater
[7:22] things, big things. Can you say amen? So
[7:25] I want to show that this morning. If
[7:26] thou if you hold your peace at this
[7:28] time, then shall their enlargement and
[7:31] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[7:33] another place. But thou and thy father's
[7:36] house shall be destroyed. And who
[7:37] knoweth whether thou art come to the
[7:40] kingdom for such a time as this? You
[7:43] know what he's hinting? You actually
[7:46] have been positioned. Just think about
[7:48] it, Esther. God's called you to this
[7:50] time and this place for a special
[7:53] purpose. You don't need to hold your
[7:55] peace. It's important that you say
[7:57] something. It's important that you fast
[8:00] and pray. We can all fast and pray with
[8:02] you, but you've got the position to do
[8:05] it.
[8:07] So, don't hold your peace. And maybe
[8:09] God's, this is the slogan I have in my
[8:11] office. You'll see it on the wall in my
[8:13] office. Perhaps uh he said, "Who knoweth
[8:16] whether thou come to the king and
[8:17] kingdom for such a time as this?" I I
[8:21] have that in my office to encourage me.
[8:23] He didn't call me in Luther's day or
[8:24] Wesley's day. He called me right in the
[8:26] middle of Satan's Eden to be a preacher,
[8:28] to actually get up here and preach to a
[8:31] lot of people's issues, my own issues, a
[8:32] lot of problems, a lot of pressures, a
[8:34] lot of demonic power. But if God's
[8:37] called you to that hour, he's going to
[8:39] give you what to say
[8:42] cuz he's called us for such a time as
[8:44] this. And he's called you for that as
[8:45] well. Then if you pick up um then Esther
[8:48] bathe them returned to Mori this answer.
[8:51] Go gather together all the Jews that are
[8:53] present in Shishan, and fast ye for me,
[8:56] and neither eat nor drink three days,
[8:58] night or day. I also and my maidens will
[9:00] fast likewise, and so will I go in unto
[9:04] the king, which is not according to the
[9:06] law. And if I perish, I perish. I want
[9:09] you to look at the courage and strength
[9:12] that come in heart only by revelation.
[9:14] Can you say amen? Every emotional fear
[9:17] and scare would tell her stay away from
[9:19] that. But something rose in her heart to
[9:22] speak up. And then chapter uh if we just
[9:25] read along the verse chapter five. Now
[9:27] it came to pass on the third day that
[9:29] Esther put on her royal apparel and
[9:32] stood in the inner court of the king's
[9:33] house over against the king's house. And
[9:36] the king sat upon his royal throne in
[9:38] the royal house over against the gate of
[9:39] the house. And it was so when the king
[9:42] saw Esther the queen standing in the
[9:44] court that she obtained favor in his
[9:47] sight. And the king held out to Esther
[9:51] the golden scepter that was in his hand.
[9:54] So Esther drew near and touched the top
[9:57] of the scepter. If you study that, when
[9:59] a king holds the scepter, it means if
[10:02] she touches that or whoever touches it,
[10:04] they are uh they are they are joined
[10:07] together with the power and the
[10:09] authority of the kingdom. For him to
[10:12] hand that to her, no one else in the
[10:13] kingdom but to hand it to Esther and for
[10:16] her to touch it. God has uh God has
[10:19] chosen her for a special purpose. Amen.
[10:21] Praise the Lord. And then you know what
[10:23] he says verse three just before we pray.
[10:26] Then said the king unto her, "What wilt
[10:27] thou, Queen Esther? And what is thy
[10:29] request? It shall be even given thee to
[10:33] the half of the kingdom." I want to
[10:35] repeat again Markap 6 and verse 9 as
[10:39] we're picking up where we left off uh
[10:41] when we were speaking of the disciples
[10:43] asking the Lord, "Lord, teach us to
[10:45] pray." And when they ask it, then Jesus
[10:47] goes into this short prayer in Mark 6:9.
[10:51] After this manner, therefore pray ye.
[10:53] Our Father, which art in heaven,
[10:56] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[11:00] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[11:02] heaven. Give us this day our daily
[11:05] bread, and forgive us our debts as we
[11:08] forgive our debtors. I think at one
[11:11] place it says, "Forgive us our
[11:12] trespasses as we forgive those who
[11:15] trespass against us, and lead us not
[11:17] into temptation, but deliver us from
[11:20] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[11:23] power and the glory forever. Amen." When
[11:27] the disciples asked, "Teach us to pray,"
[11:29] this is the short prayer that he used to
[11:31] teach us to pray. Often it's called the
[11:34] Lord's prayer, but it's not really the
[11:35] Lord's prayer. It's what he said for us
[11:37] to pray. And I want to take a look at
[11:40] this and uh just uh we've looked at it
[11:43] so many times. We quote it and we we we
[11:46] quote it from many services and I'm sure
[11:48] all of you know it by heart, but we must
[11:50] always look at the deeper meaning of the
[11:52] things that said because there's such
[11:54] deep meaning to what he says in this
[11:56] prayer. And I I've been not only is it
[12:00] each each phrase has a deep meaning to
[12:03] it, but I I I want you to notice how big
[12:06] a request this is. This isn't just a
[12:08] little prayer, but he's actually
[12:10] teaching us to ask for something big.
[12:12] When you're saying, "Thy kingdom come,
[12:14] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[12:17] heaven." That's not a small request.
[12:18] That's a pretty big request that
[12:21] actually we could pray for his kingdom
[12:24] to come down to earth and that we would
[12:27] begin to live a life that his will, his
[12:29] principles, his kingdom principles would
[12:32] be lived out in my life and lived out in
[12:34] this earth. In other words, this is so
[12:36] big that with the world as bad as it is,
[12:39] believers have an authority in God to
[12:42] ask for his kingdom to come down to
[12:44] earth. That's a pretty big prayer
[12:47] request, but it shows how much power is
[12:51] in the heart and lips of the believer.
[12:53] And so, there's nothing surface about
[12:56] there this prayer. There's nothing
[12:57] shallow about this prayer. It's just a
[13:00] few lines. It's just a short prayer. By
[13:02] the way, this shows us it's not the
[13:04] quantity of words we say in prayer. It's
[13:07] the quality of words. It's not long
[13:10] prayers. Can you say, "Man, this is very
[13:12] short, but it says a lot. It has a lot
[13:14] of substance to it." I think when we go
[13:16] pray, I think it should come from the
[13:18] depths of our heart. I don't think we
[13:20] should just throw in words there. I
[13:22] think it should be a prayer of
[13:24] substance. I think it should be a prayer
[13:26] that comes from our heart. Can you say
[13:28] amen? And I I I I think it it should
[13:31] have the substance of sincerity and
[13:34] revelation behind it. When our prayer
[13:35] has revelation behind it, because this
[13:37] prayer has revelation behind it, it's
[13:39] actually saying that I have something in
[13:41] my heart to ask for his kingdom to come
[13:43] to earth. That's the big picture of the
[13:45] entire redemption plan of God that his
[13:48] kingdom would come back to earth. That's
[13:51] a big prayer request. That is a a a big
[13:54] thing to ask for a believer. So I think
[13:57] our prayer should have substance and
[13:59] sincerity and revelation behind it. And
[14:01] in these few words, he says we can call
[14:04] for his kingdom to come and for those
[14:06] kingdom principles to be already in
[14:08] action on earth. That his will could be
[14:11] done in earth right now as far as this
[14:13] world. His will is not done in this
[14:15] earth. His will is not in politics. His
[14:18] will is not be carried out by anybody.
[14:21] But it's the believers that say, "Lord,
[14:23] I want your will in heaven and your
[14:25] principles to be shown here in my life
[14:27] on earth." Amen. Praise the Lord. So,
[14:30] uh, you know, and then he asked for all
[14:33] these kingdom principles to be in action
[14:35] here on earth already, even for before
[14:37] the millennium, and for all channels of
[14:40] unforgiveness to be cleaned out. That's
[14:43] what he asked for. And this is part of
[14:45] our prayer as well, because we can't go
[14:47] to prayer properly if we have
[14:48] unforgiveness in our heart. So part of
[14:51] our prayer is that Lord, I can't hold on
[14:53] to an unforgiving spirit and be right to
[14:56] ask this. I must forgive those who have
[14:59] done trespasses against me. And if I've
[15:02] done trespasses, I want to clear that
[15:04] up. His prayer is clearing all that up.
[15:06] We can't hold unforgiveness in our
[15:08] heart.
[15:09] And then he goes on uh as the last thing
[15:12] and maybe we'll get to more of this in
[15:14] another service but he says and lead us
[15:16] not into temptation but deliver us from
[15:20] uh evil. So many things that he's
[15:23] bringing. He said give us this day our
[15:24] daily bread. That's asking for
[15:26] revelation. Brother said we should ask
[15:28] for revelation more than any other thing
[15:30] that we ask for. We need revelation.
[15:33] Yeah. So give us this day, not our uh
[15:36] every year at camp bread, but give us
[15:38] our daily bread. Give us our spiritual
[15:41] bread. Give us revelation. We need more
[15:43] revelation.
[15:45] Give it to us, Lord. And give it to us
[15:47] daily, not just Sunday at church. Can
[15:49] you say amen? So we would think that
[15:51] when he teaches us to pray, he he would
[15:54] say something like, "Yes, you can pray
[15:56] for things that you need in life." And
[15:58] but the Lord says, "I'll handle the big
[16:01] stuff. I'll handle the kingdom coming.
[16:03] I'll pray for those things, but you just
[16:05] you're welcome to bring things. No, he
[16:07] teaches us to pray that we're asking for
[16:08] his kingdom to come. We're asking to to
[16:12] we're we're asking for his will to be
[16:14] done as it is in heaven. Let it be done
[16:16] in earth. Sons are asking for that. Can
[16:19] you say amen? So my point in this lesson
[16:21] is we look at how we pray and he teaches
[16:23] us to pray that it causes the person to
[16:26] align himself or herself with the entire
[16:30] purpose and mystery of God from the
[16:32] beginning. We have things that we pray
[16:34] about and like brother Rap said last
[16:35] Sunday the smallest thing, the smallest
[16:37] need, he's concerned about the smallest,
[16:40] he's concerned about the biggest. So it
[16:42] doesn't matter to God. Can you say amen?
[16:44] But you see now there's a prayer that
[16:46] aligns itself with the purpose and the
[16:49] plan of God. And when he says, "Thy
[16:51] kingdom come," which is my title this
[16:53] morning. When he says, "You pray, thy
[16:55] kingdom come," that's a pretty big
[16:57] prayer. And it's actually aligning a
[17:00] believer with the entire purpose and
[17:02] mystery of God from the very beginning.
[17:04] It actually joins in participation with
[17:08] God's ultimate achievement and agenda
[17:10] and that is redemption. redemption is
[17:12] God's uh from the very beginning when he
[17:15] fell when man and and and the woman
[17:18] failed then we realize God right there
[17:20] gave a prophecy of redemption and now
[17:23] for 6,000 years he's been in the process
[17:25] of working to redeem his people back to
[17:28] redeem his bride back to bring it back
[17:31] to Adam and Eve again and to restore
[17:34] Eden again and to make this earth a
[17:37] millennium only God can do that but I
[17:40] just want to show you Who's asking for
[17:41] it here? It's a believer aligned himself
[17:45] with the prophecy and the whole
[17:46] redemption plan of God and they're
[17:49] asking for it to come. As a matter of
[17:50] fact, nobody else in this world is
[17:52] asking for it. Nobody else is asking for
[17:55] that. They have their own agenda, but
[17:57] there's a people aligned with God's
[17:59] agenda.
[18:00] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. And
[18:03] so you align yourself with the very
[18:04] mystery of God. It joins in
[18:06] participation with God's ultimate
[18:08] achievement or agenda. Is it is a prayer
[18:11] that calls for God to fulfill what he
[18:14] said he would do. He's already said it,
[18:17] but this prayer aligns itself with God's
[18:19] already said this. And when God says it,
[18:21] it's going to happen, but somebody needs
[18:23] to pray for it. Somebody needs to hasten
[18:25] it. It's kind of like John saying in in
[18:28] Revelations, even so, come quickly, Lord
[18:31] Jesus. I don't know if any of you have
[18:32] had that prayer recently. But I'll tell
[18:34] you, if you listen live in this world,
[18:36] I've had that upon my lips. Even so,
[18:39] come quickly, Lord Jesus. Hasten your
[18:41] coming. I'm not afraid of it. Bring it
[18:44] to pass. How many's tired of this world?
[18:47] How many is tired of the pressures? Can
[18:48] you say amen? And so the rest of the
[18:51] world, they teach you to function that
[18:53] we'll be here forever, but we won't be
[18:55] here forever. There's believers actually
[18:57] tired. This world is not my home. I'm
[19:00] just passing through and I'm growing
[19:02] more weary of it all the time. I'm tired
[19:04] of the pressures. So, there's a group of
[19:06] people that's saying there's a promise
[19:08] of a rapture laying right in front of me
[19:10] and I'm going to pray that prayer.
[19:12] Hasten it. Bring it to pass. Lord,
[19:14] whatever you got to do to get me under
[19:16] rapturing faith so this can take place.
[19:19] I don't know if that's your prayer.
[19:20] That's my prayer. I believe it's the
[19:22] bride's prayer. When your prayer taps
[19:24] into the very plan of redemption of God
[19:27] and says, "God, I know my son's away
[19:29] from you. I know my daughter's away from
[19:31] you. I know I've tried everything. It
[19:34] seems impossible, but listen, redemption
[19:37] is available, and I'm going to pray for
[19:39] it for my children.
[19:41] I'm aligning my prayer with what you
[19:43] said. You will save them." God loves
[19:46] that. He said, "They've asked for
[19:48] something here big, but I can't really
[19:50] get around it because I've promised if
[19:53] the same requirements are met, I can
[19:55] save that boy. I can save that girl. I
[20:00] can do something because God's bound to
[20:04] his word. Can I get an amen?" God is
[20:07] bound to his word. But he said, "Ask.
[20:11] Ask that your joys may be full." That's
[20:13] right. Ask. No, but why doesn't God just
[20:15] come and shower with us? Why do we have
[20:17] to ask? Because it's the participation
[20:20] with it. As brother Rap was saying, the
[20:22] participation. Sometimes it's like we're
[20:25] waiting. Even himself, we wait around
[20:27] for God to do something. We ray around.
[20:28] But you see what we speak in the in in
[20:31] the inspiration of God. He wants us to
[20:33] ask for those things. He wants us to
[20:36] speak those things being led of God, of
[20:38] course. But he wants us because we have
[20:40] a participation in creation.
[20:44] We also have a participation in the
[20:46] redemptive plan of God even to redeem
[20:48] this earth. We have a participation in
[20:50] that. God is wanting his people to
[20:53] participate in the process of bringing
[20:56] his word to pass and our prayers and our
[20:59] heart and and and and our our words are
[21:02] participating. Can you say amen? There
[21:05] is a reason that we he said we start our
[21:07] prayer with our father. You know why we
[21:10] start our prayer? Jesus said, "Start
[21:12] with our father." Only sons and
[21:14] daughters of God can begin their prayer
[21:16] that way.
[21:18] So who who's he teaching here? He's
[21:20] teaching predestinated sons of God. That
[21:23] angels can't begin their prayer with our
[21:25] father. That's right. And they know how
[21:28] to worship. Matter of fact, we can learn
[21:30] something from angels about worship. We
[21:33] enjoyed our worship this morning. But
[21:35] believers should be worshiped even more
[21:37] exuberantly because angels, they worship
[21:40] God 24/7 or if that time zone is there,
[21:43] I don't know. They worship him
[21:44] constantly and they've never fallen in
[21:46] sin. They've never been away and yet
[21:48] they worship him constantly. I'm I'm
[21:50] preaching to sons of God that fell that
[21:53] were away from the Lord. Can you say
[21:55] amen? They know something about the
[21:57] grace of God. You pro many of you
[21:59] shouldn't be here this morning, but by
[22:01] God's grace, you're here. So your
[22:04] worship should be more exuberant than
[22:06] the angels worship. They don't know what
[22:08] it is to re be redeemed. They don't know
[22:10] what it is to be lost and be found. They
[22:13] don't know what it is to have the word
[22:15] taken from them and restored back to
[22:18] them.
[22:19] They worship all the time. They worship
[22:22] with all everything they are. But oh,
[22:25] when a son of God comes back to God,
[22:30] Bible says all heavens rejoice. Amen.
[22:34] Over one sinner that repents. That's
[22:36] right. There's great rejoicing that goes
[22:38] on. Amen. Why? Because redemption is
[22:41] more powerful. I just said that to one
[22:42] of my kids last night. I said I prayed
[22:45] with him and I said,
[22:48] "Redemption, everybody has a story of
[22:50] redemption." And redemption is more
[22:53] powerful of a story in God than someone
[22:56] who just had all perfect life. But it's
[22:59] more powerful when someone drops to the
[23:01] very bottom of the miry clay and it
[23:03] seems like they'll never come out of
[23:04] that and God picks them up and raises
[23:07] them up and changes them. That story is
[23:11] greater than some Pharisee who's never
[23:14] done anything wrong. Right. Amen.
[23:17] Somebody ought to praise us the Lord
[23:19] this morning. We serve a God of
[23:21] redemption.
[23:23] And our lives have all come under the
[23:25] power of redemption.
[23:27] And when you come under the power of
[23:28] redemption, there's only one way you're
[23:30] headed, and that's up, not down. But
[23:33] that power keeps pulling you higher,
[23:35] keeps pulling you out of the dimensions.
[23:37] Can you say amen? Keeps raising you out
[23:39] of your depression, out of your past uh
[23:42] flaws, out of your childhood trauma that
[23:45] you went through. There's only one power
[23:47] to come underneath that'll raise you
[23:49] above all of that. It'll bring you out
[23:51] of the fish like it did Jonah. He prayed
[23:53] and it brought him out of the fish.
[23:54] Amen.
[23:56] Why? Because our prayer is tapped into
[24:00] the plan of redemption and God's power
[24:01] of redemption. And there isn't any
[24:04] situation that's too impossible for him.
[24:08] We begin our prayer with our father
[24:11] because we are sons and daughters of
[24:12] God, predestinated sons and daughters of
[24:14] God. You know my
[24:17] daddy, my
[24:19] father, he'll he owns the cattle of a
[24:22] thousand hills. Yeah, there's a song,
[24:26] Sherry. I don't know if you remember
[24:27] that song by the Neons that said, "If
[24:30] you've got a problem, I'd sure like to
[24:32] share. There's one special way I can
[24:35] show you I care. I can offer opinions
[24:40] that might prove untrue, but there's one
[24:43] sure answer. Here's what I'll do." And
[24:46] here's what the course says. I will talk
[24:48] to my father for you. Hallelujah. And if
[24:52] I know my father, here's what he'll do.
[24:55] He'll lay at the feet of the things you
[24:57] pursue. It's no bother. For my father
[25:01] will do it for you. I've got a big big
[25:06] daddy. My daddy has gone to build a home
[25:09] for me. Can you say amen? I go to
[25:13] prepare a place for my daddy is very
[25:15] successful. My daddy's very rich. And I
[25:18] will talk to him for you. He has my
[25:21] daddy. He has my my number in his phone.
[25:24] My father has his number. And not just
[25:27] my number, he has my picture in his
[25:29] phone. And when I call him, my picture
[25:32] comes up. Predestinated son of God.
[25:36] I'm not just some alien. My picture
[25:38] comes up in God's phone. And my father
[25:41] may be in a meeting, a very important
[25:45] meeting, but I know I've learned when I
[25:48] call in prayer, he says, I excuse me
[25:52] just a minute. And he steps out and he
[25:54] takes my call every time.
[25:57] Can somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[25:59] Predestinated sons had access to the
[26:01] father. And when we go to prayer for
[26:03] someone else, I'll talk to my father for
[26:05] you. Can you say amen? Recognize your
[26:07] position. Bring all your sins underneath
[26:10] the blood of Jesus Christ. Stop. Stop
[26:13] being defeated by Satan's condemnation
[26:15] of your past.
[26:18] When are you going to stop living in the
[26:20] past and what you've done? Bring it
[26:21] under the blood because God wants to
[26:23] make you sons and daughters, kings and
[26:25] priests,
[26:27] standing with confidence. Hallelujah.
[26:29] Confidence in your testimony, confidence
[26:31] in your prayer, confidence in your faith
[26:33] in God. How many years will you let
[26:36] Satan beat you over the head and make
[26:39] you your nobody in the body? You're
[26:40] nobody in in this kingdom. You come to
[26:42] church, but you're a nobody. Stop
[26:44] listening to the devil. You're under a
[26:47] word that's causing you to see your past
[26:50] under the blood and only look into the
[26:53] future. He's making you a king and
[26:55] priest. He's making you a mature adopted
[26:58] son of God. Say, "I don't I didn't feel
[27:00] like that this past week, brother Paul."
[27:02] I don't care what you feel like. This
[27:04] word is making you a king and priest.
[27:07] Praise God. Oh, that God would hasten
[27:09] the day. That people would get over
[27:11] their past and stand sure-footed as sons
[27:14] and daughters of God. Not with
[27:15] arrogance, but with confidence, with
[27:18] perfect faith. I know who I am. I know
[27:21] God has called me. And I'm not just some
[27:23] other statistic in this world. I'm not
[27:26] judged by my past mistakes. I am looked
[27:29] at through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[27:31] And this word is making me a king and a
[27:34] priest. Tony Evans said, "The kingdom
[27:36] agenda can be defined, I've been reading
[27:38] a little bit of this, the kingdom agenda
[27:40] can be defined as the visible
[27:43] manifestation of the comprehensive rule
[27:46] of God over every area of our life."
[27:50] Stop right there. His kingdom's coming,
[27:53] but his kingdom is already here. And
[27:55] when it's established in husband's
[27:58] hearts and father's hearts and mother's
[27:59] hearts and wives hearts and then in
[28:01] teenagers hearts when his kingdom is
[28:03] established in
[28:05] there he you give him rule over every
[28:08] area of your life for watching our
