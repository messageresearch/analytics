[0:00] praise the lord so
[0:02] tonight we want to
[0:04] jump right in here where we
[0:06] left off
[0:07] and maybe we'll just title this a
[0:09] different title tonight
[0:11] the reason god reveals our thoughts the
[0:14] reason god reveals our thoughts and
[0:17] don't forget in this series it's
[0:19] actually coming from uh a series that
[0:22] i'm bringing out of psalms 1. the reason
[0:24] we're into this thing about the thought
[0:26] life is there's one scripture in psalms
[0:28] 1 1-3
[0:30] that talks about the man that is blessed
[0:33] and it talks about where he positions
[0:35] himself
[0:36] and it talks about him
[0:38] thinking upon the things of god and
[0:40] meditating upon them day and night and
[0:42] so because it's emphasizing a blessed
[0:45] man's thought life being under control i
[0:48] thought it necessary to take some time
[0:49] in our thought life and so but we're in
[0:51] this series if you want to be reminded
[0:53] what we're going back to it's this
[0:54] blessed man of god who walketh not in
[0:57] the accounts of the ungodly nor sitteth
[1:00] in the way of the seat of the scornful
[1:02] and so it's all about position
[1:04] it's a blessed man it's a believer but
[1:07] you have to position yourself correctly
[1:10] and he chooses to position himself away
[1:13] from the seat of the scornful away from
[1:16] the gossipers can you say amen out of
[1:18] the counsel of the ungodly out of the
[1:20] way of sinners he's distanced himself as
[1:23] much as he can and positioning himself
[1:26] away from those influences i think we
[1:28] need to do that the second verse says
[1:31] and on his law
[1:32] his delight is in the law of god his
[1:34] delight is in the word but on his law
[1:37] it's not just he delights in it it's not
[1:38] just that i love the word i like to go
[1:40] to church and i love to hear the
[1:41] preaching of the word but he actually
[1:43] when he goes home it's not just that he
[1:46] goes to church and listens to the
[1:47] preaching of the word he actually says i
[1:49] want to meditate on this day and night
[1:53] praise the lord this is this is a
[1:56] serious fellow here
[1:57] this is serious it's not just saying
[1:59] yeah i love the preaching and enjoying
[2:00] your preaching brother paul and i love
[2:02] to come and hear it and all these other
[2:03] no he's taking he's saying i want my
[2:06] thought life to be invaded
[2:09] i want my thought life i want the word
[2:11] not just to be a hero of the word but a
[2:13] doer and i want the word to consume my
[2:17] thoughts more and more
[2:19] so that's where i got this series on our
[2:22] thought life and it's becoming such a
[2:24] wonderful subject personally for me
[2:26] i will say though that what but you
[2:29] you're corrected all the time the word
[2:31] corrects where we're living and i'll
[2:33] tell you uh this has been a challenge
[2:35] for me
[2:36] to
[2:37] uh put the scanner on my thoughts i'm
[2:40] just gonna go ahead and say this
[2:41] i really believe and i here's the this
[2:44] this thought came to me
[2:46] on the way to church as i was thinking
[2:48] other thoughts than i should have for
[2:50] church and for the lord i was there
[2:53] weren't bad thoughts but they were
[2:55] negative thoughts and i caught myself
[2:56] and i only have a five-minute drive to
[2:58] work to to work to
[3:01] to church
[3:02] it's pretty bad when you've got a
[3:03] five-minute drive and you're already
[3:04] thinking negative thoughts
[3:07] but i said lord i just caught myself
[3:09] beep beep beep beep nope no no dump it
[3:12] out doubled up five minutes on the way
[3:14] to church and so i caught myself i said
[3:16] this is really real isn't it here's the
[3:18] pastor supposed to have his mind ready
[3:20] for the service and he's thinking things
[3:21] he shouldn't think and i said stop it
[3:23] right there so i this is really real you
[3:25] know what i thought this is why i
[3:26] thought maybe this came from the lord
[3:28] beside we human beings it's it's amazing
[3:31] and i'm gonna venture to say tonight
[3:33] that this is probably the place of most
[3:36] in our life that we exercise our rights
[3:40] more than any other rights that we have
[3:46] you know when we say something and we
[3:49] get caught for saying something wrong
[3:51] if we have god in our heart we're going
[3:53] to apologize and sometimes people
[3:55] without god in their heart they
[3:56] apologize sometimes but you know we're
[3:58] going to make it right okay because
[4:00] we've been exposed and sometimes if you
[4:02] have the holy spirit in your life you
[4:03] feel convicted of something you said and
[4:05] you you didn't you weren't exposed you
[4:07] just went and and corrected it you went
[4:09] and said you know i i said the wrong
[4:11] thing i am sorry i should not have said
[4:13] that that spilled out i should have
[4:14] never said that so we asked uh we would
[4:17] say i'm sorry for that but how many
[4:19] people apologize
[4:21] for their
[4:22] thoughts
[4:25] we're going to get into it
[4:26] tonight because there's several places
[4:29] quite a few places where the prophet is
[4:33] apologizing to god
[4:35] god
[4:36] i'm sorry
[4:38] i thought that
[4:41] how much is that going on because the
[4:43] thought life is this this this
[4:46] undetected unchecked private place
[4:50] and because it is we exercise our rights
[4:53] we can think i may not be able to do
[4:56] what i want but i can think whatever i
[4:59] want and when you start reading the
[5:00] scripture and you start realizing that
[5:03] the thought life can actually quench the
[5:05] spirit of god then you start saying it's
[5:07] time to grow to even let my thought life
[5:10] be corrected
[5:12] come on now
[5:13] casting down imagination and everything
[5:16] that exalted itself above the knowledge
[5:19] of god bringing every thought into
[5:21] captivity of christ that's living a deep
[5:25] life
[5:25] how many of us apologize for thinking
[5:27] the wrong thought towards somebody or
[5:29] thinking the thought towards god
[5:31] i say very rare but the prophet once
[5:34] again is growing as a son of god as an
[5:36] adopted son of god and he's growing to
[5:38] places that we haven't maybe been there
[5:40] yet but every son of god if jesus went
[5:43] there we're going there too if the first
[5:45] fruits of the harvest went there that's
[5:48] he waved it before the people can you
[5:50] say the wave in the old testament when
[5:53] they took that wave chief the first one
[5:55] to come to maturity and wave that mature
[5:58] thing to the rest of the flock and it
[6:00] was a sign the rest of the crop is gonna
[6:03] come to maturity and look at the
[6:05] maturity he's coming to he's actually
[6:08] saying god i'm sorry that i thought that
[6:11] thought
[6:14] praise the lord god helped me to live
[6:16] there
[6:17] god
[6:18] and he and thankfully brother ray he's
[6:20] helping me
[6:21] because i can't do this without him
[6:25] but what a deep life wow
[6:27] we all been taught as
[6:29] as christians to apologize when you say
[6:32] something wrong but apologizing when you
[6:34] think something wrong
[6:36] because you realize he he knows what
[6:37] we're thinking
[6:40] how many things are underneath
[6:42] underneath the blood
[6:46] praise the lord well
[6:48] uh
[6:49] i need to get into my notes that that
[6:51] wasn't my notes i need to get and start
[6:54] on my notes here praise the lord he's
[6:55] still here tonight
[6:56] all right so the reason god reveals so
[6:59] so he we was talking about sunday why
[7:01] does god come into this world of our
[7:04] thoughts and we've seen him do it in
[7:06] service time but he knows the realm of
[7:08] our thoughts all the time
[7:10] and it might go back to this reality
[7:12] and this statement that the prophet made
[7:14] our thoughts speak louder in heaven than
[7:17] our words i want you guys to pull up the
[7:18] first quote there and and he says where
[7:21] that came from we don't have a scripture
[7:23] for that but here's here's where that
[7:26] statement come from
[7:27] god's omnipresence knows what you're
[7:29] doing and even your thoughts
[7:32] one time
[7:33] is this the right one no
[7:37] it's the one in in the influence the
[7:39] first one in influence there 63.
[7:41] god's omnipresence knows what you're
[7:44] doing and even your thoughts
[7:47] one time while i was in a vision i was
[7:49] speaking to i was speaking to a being
[7:52] standing by me and he said back he said
[7:55] your thoughts are louder in heaven than
[7:58] your voice is on earth that's where it
[8:00] came from and he quoted this quite often
[8:02] but it was the angel of the lord who
[8:03] told him that your thoughts and he's
[8:05] teaching the son of god now
[8:07] that your thoughts speak louder in
[8:09] heaven than your voice on earth he knows
[8:12] what you're thinking you might say you
[8:14] do this and you do that and this but you
[8:17] see down in your heart if you think
[8:19] different then you're doing something
[8:21] wrong you should be just what you are
[8:23] you see and the heart the mouth would
[8:26] speak what's in the heart the mouth
[8:29] excuse me the mouth should speak what's
[8:31] in the heart see and so we find that the
[8:34] people doesn't realize
[8:36] the presence of god the mouth should
[8:39] speak
[8:40] what's in the heart he's he's saying
[8:43] that we need to get our thought life and
[8:45] we need to get what's laying in the
[8:47] secret parts we need to get it in line
[8:50] with what we're saying and what we're
[8:52] believing out here our thoughts have to
[8:55] be in line with what we believe
[8:57] and if our thoughts are not in line with
[8:58] what we're saying we need to correct our
[9:01] thoughts and get our heart together with
[9:03] what we're saying that what we say we
[9:06] really believe from our heart and we're
[9:08] not because god knows we don't know
[9:10] about your thought life but god can see
[9:13] he talked about the pharisees and he
[9:15] says uh he says they their mouths speak
[9:17] things but their heart is far from them
[9:19] and so now their heart was distant from
[9:22] the truth of god's word and yet they're
[9:24] speaking the truth of god's word so now
[9:26] as we grow in the lord we're bringing
[9:28] our thought life subject to what we
[9:31] believe what we say what we say we
[9:33] believe our thought and our heart is in
[9:35] line with that
[9:37] amen and then i like this last statement
[9:39] he says see so and so we find that the
[9:42] people doesn't realize the presence of
[9:45] god this is one of the things is that
[9:47] people don't realize that in the
[9:49] presence of god he can see our thoughts
[9:54] in the presence of god and matter of
[9:56] fact this is part of the evidence that
[9:59] you're in his presence you know a lot of
[10:01] people talk about his presence and they
[10:03] sung songs about his presence and it
[10:05] could be different meanings it could be
[10:07] they felt something and sometimes we
[10:09] feel something some sometimes we don't
[10:11] so there's a lot of evidence that people
[10:12] give that we're in the presence of the
[10:14] lord but as i said sunday this part of
[10:17] him discerning the thoughts is
[10:18] eliminated from most of christianity
[10:21] that he knows the secrets of the heart
[10:23] and the intents of the heart god they've
[10:25] removed it but part of the evidence that
[10:28] you know that you have been in his
[10:30] presence is when the secrets of your
[10:32] heart are revealed there's nothing
[10:34] hidden can you say amen
[10:36] and said and we find that people don't
[10:39] realize the presence of god this is a
[10:41] part of the evidence that you've been in
[10:43] his presence not a feeling not a
[10:45] sensation he's dealing with us at a
[10:48] heart level the secrets of the heart the
[10:52] secrets of our thoughts we know that
[10:54] we've been in the presence when god
[10:57] reveals the secrets of his heart by the
[11:00] word of god
[11:04] can i say it again
[11:06] people don't realize he says the the
[11:08] presence of god we know in that
[11:10] statement he made the angel made to him
[11:12] he says our thoughts speak louder in the
[11:14] other dimension
[11:15] then our words are what we're saying out
[11:17] here
[11:19] it's it's they're screaming out and so
[11:22] you can't hide anything so god
[11:25] he can look back and say one of the two
[11:27] things
[11:28] here is a people
[11:30] that i'm looking at what they're
[11:32] thinking
[11:32] and he probably seen this on the day of
[11:35] pentecost when the bible says they were
[11:37] in one mind and one accord
[11:40] that didn't mean that all their opinions
[11:42] were the same but they had one objective
[11:45] and that's to empty out of themselves
[11:47] and pray for god's promise to be
[11:49] fulfilled
[11:50] and they had that one objective together
[11:52] this is what we're coming to church for
[11:53] this is what we're in the upper room for
[11:55] we shut every other thought out right
[11:57] now we're praying for these 10 days
[11:59] brother baby says they were emptying out
[12:01] of themselves emptying out of things and
[12:02] they had one focus one mind and one
[12:05] accord
[12:07] and god looked at that and seen their
[12:10] thought life and their
[12:12] desire to be in one minor one accord is
[12:14] in line with what they're saying
[12:17] and then the holy ghost fire fell on
[12:19] that place
[12:21] one mind one accord but when you have a
[12:24] service where there's millions of
[12:26] different thoughts
[12:27] from unbelief to what i'm going to wear
[12:30] next week how am i going to pay my bill
[12:32] on monday to
[12:33] millions of thoughts going on and it's
[12:35] not about let's forget all that and
[12:38] praise someone through to the holy ghost
[12:41] what if there's a soul here that needs
[12:43] more of god
[12:45] you may not need it you may not you may
[12:47] be saved and filled with the holy spirit
[12:49] praise the lord but why is it that
[12:50] you're so selfish to leave it alone
[12:52] somebody else needs more of god so we
[12:54] focus say god what could you do in this
[12:57] little wednesday night service tonight
[12:59] i'm gonna focus it i don't care about my
[13:01] bills that i owe you know this is one
[13:02] place you can forget about your bills
[13:05] i give you permission
[13:07] because you're not going to solve
[13:08] anything tonight can you say man
[13:11] you'll pick it up tomorrow say god help
[13:13] me you're the provider i just sang it at
[13:15] church jehovah jireh but you're not
[13:17] going to deal with it tonight so focus
[13:19] what can god do for the kingdom of god
[13:22] what young heart can come to the lord
[13:24] what is who's struggling with depression
[13:26] that the spirit of god can sweep through
[13:28] that place and drive that cloud away
[13:31] what can you do if we could all get in
[13:33] one mind and one accord and stop
[13:36] thinking other things
[13:42] then
[13:44] then
[13:45] that's part of the presence of the lord
[13:47] it's an evidence that we've been in the
[13:48] presence of the lord
[13:51] god is watching this
[13:53] and he sees
[13:56] he's trying to see if the heart
[13:58] opens up in simplicity and faith
[14:01] and will drive out its own thoughts
[14:04] of doubt
[14:08] of overcoming
[14:10] trying to figure it all out
[14:12] in your own thinking
[14:14] you see and said lord i
[14:16] i'm tired of trying to figure everything
[14:18] out
[14:21] we're trying to figure out how god's
[14:23] going to do this
[14:25] and he didn't really ask you to figure
[14:27] out how he's going to do it i mean he
[14:30] could show somebody a vision he could
[14:32] give this is a distinct like a prophet i
[14:35] mean i wouldn't knock that if somebody
[14:36] said it praise the lord he tells you
[14:38] exactly what how god's gonna do it but
[14:40] god wants us to have simple faith that
[14:42] he's gonna do it but i don't have to
[14:45] think through how god's gonna do it
[14:48] i don't have to think through when's
[14:50] gonna god's gonna do it
[14:53] are you listening tonight
[14:56] anybody know that there's such a thing
[14:58] as overthinking something
[15:01] i know
[15:03] none of you none of you here tonight
[15:05] ever do that none of you do that i'm
[15:07] sure of it i'm sure
[15:09] but there is
[15:11] certain people
[15:12] that overthink life and overthink things
[15:16] and
[15:17] and
[15:18] besides fearing what's happened they're
[15:20] fearing what hasn't happened yet
[15:23] and they're scared of what hasn't
[15:24] happened or what might happen or what my
[15:27] children might do or the direction they
[15:29] may go and and so it hasn't happened yet
[15:32] but there's so much fear that it might
[15:34] happen that they're bound in those
[15:35] thoughts
[15:37] god does not ask us when we pray
[15:39] something to figure out and think
[15:41] through how he's going to do it
[15:43] but he asked for simple faith to stand
[15:46] there like a rock and say i believe god
[15:49] is going to do it i believe he's going
[15:52] to do it because he's able to do it i'm
[15:54] not budging on believing with all of my
[15:56] heart and when god looks at my thoughts
[15:58] and when god looks at my heart i'm not
[16:01] budging and god can see my faith isn't
[16:03] gonna budge whatsoever but i don't have
[16:05] to think about how god's going to do it
[16:07] i don't have to think it through when
[16:09] god's going to do it but he wants us to
[16:11] see our thought life saying he's going
[16:13] to do it i believe he's going to do it
[16:16] amen
[16:18] because he is able
[16:20] he's more than able
[16:22] that's what he wants to hear
[16:24] overthinking things man a whole sermon
[16:27] can be dedicated to overthinking
[16:31] overthinking and all the while the bible
[16:34] says let this mind be in you which is
[16:36] also in christ jesus all the while the
[16:38] bible says think on good things all the
[16:41] while about the bible's given us
[16:43] instruction how to guide our thoughts
[16:46] so when you overthink things
[16:49] you've probably taken a lot of your
[16:50] thought life
[16:52] just filled
[16:54] with
[16:56] wasted
[16:57] time
[16:59] can i get an amen
[17:02] so then we say something like i'd like
[17:04] to have
[17:05] a penny
[17:06] for every
[17:08] thought
[17:09] that was wasted thought
[17:12] i'd be a millionaire
[17:15] wasted
[17:17] thoughts
[17:18] had no value to him whatsoever never got
[17:22] you anywhere
[17:23] never
[17:26] never brought fruit
[17:29] amen
[17:32] so
[17:34] god is watching and he sees of our heart
[17:37] is open to simplicity and faith
[17:40] and open to driving out our thoughts of
[17:41] doubt our thoughts of trying to
[17:43] overthink something or how god will do
[17:46] something
[17:47] and so i was saying sunday that people
[17:49] will come in back in brother branham's
[17:51] day
[17:51] and in any of these revivals when they'd
[17:54] hear of a gift working like this
[17:57] i think people probably i would say
[17:59] because we're built this way they were
[18:01] coming to see
[18:02] they heard what god could do
[18:04] supernaturally the blind light thine
[18:07] eyes being open the dead being raised
[18:10] people
[18:10] delivered from their crutches people
[18:12] coming up from their wheelchairs cancers
[18:14] being healed innumerable amounts of
[18:16] miracles and they're hearing around the
[18:18] world this wasn't done in jeffersonville
[18:21] indiana read your history books it was
[18:23] done around the world and it spearheaded
[18:25] a healing revival so you got great
[18:27] crowds coming but a lot of people come
[18:29] for different reasons some come as just
[18:30] critics christian people coming to
[18:32] critics i'm out to prove it wrong i'm
[18:34] proud to find fault but other people
[18:36] come for a hunger for the supernatural
[18:38] god this is doing things like jesus did
[18:40] and i want to see he can do it again
[18:42] i've never seen this in my church and so
[18:43] i'm going to travel hundreds of
[18:45] thousands of miles with lots of money to
[18:47] get there because i want to see the
[18:49] supernatural
[18:52] i doubt too many people came
[18:55] because to see in order to see the
[18:58] secrets of the heart being revealed
[19:00] i don't know i'm just speculating that
[19:02] most of it is to see god perform a
[19:05] miracle but once they got into that
[19:07] presence then you realize people come
[19:09] for many different reasons some people
[19:12] come for good so i said sunday some come
[19:14] for come for bad reasons
[19:16] some come because
[19:19] you know of this that and just like when
[19:20] they come to church now some people come
[19:22] from a lot come for a lot of different
[19:24] reasons you want to believe people come
[19:25] just because they're hungry from the
[19:26] word and that's it but some people come
[19:28] to criticize some people come to find
[19:30] something wrong some people come because
[19:32] it's part of their schedule sunday going
[19:34] to church is part of their schedule they
[19:36] got a certain slot for that
[19:38] and then as i said when i preach over
[19:41] time what i should have then they're
[19:42] done they got to get right out because i
[19:44] went beyond their schedule
[19:47] and i think that i'll say it again
[19:49] because i think that we shouldn't
[19:52] schedule in god
[19:55] we should be
[19:56] we should be the ones flexible that if
[19:58] he wants to interrupt the entire
[20:00] schedule for the entire week
[20:06] instead we're
[20:07] scheduling in
[20:09] from 11 to 1 on sundays
[20:12] what if god wants to save your children
[20:15] what if god wants you to pray the rest
[20:17] of night here
[20:22] why don't you quit putting god in a
[20:23] schedule and be submissive to his
[20:25] schedule
[20:26] his plan and his will
[20:29] amen
[20:30] some come as skeptics always finding
[20:32] fault some have no trust in
[20:35] in in preachers and sometimes that's
[20:36] understandable because of what they've
[20:38] been through but they bring those
[20:40] thoughts with them and so everything's
[20:42] filtered through that fault of a
[20:44] preacher hurting them some are thinking
[20:46] in the service that this is all good but
[20:49] i'm unworthy of this i've done too many
[20:51] things i'm i'm not in this category i'm
[20:54] not and that's all the devil's thoughts
[20:55] i want to let you know that's all the
[20:56] devil's thoughts that none of that comes
[20:59] from god whatever thought that says
[21:00] you're unworthy of the blessings of
[21:02] calvary because of either what you did
[21:04] or because of you some your complexes
[21:07] that's that's not a thought from god
[21:10] you are not worthy except calvary has
[21:12] made you worthy of every blessing of
[21:15] calvary so that thought is not even of
[21:17] god i'm worth unworthy of all this and
[21:21] the healing is not for me because i've
[21:23] done too many things
[21:24] you see this whole thought life and and
[21:27] thinking i've seen this all before this
[21:30] is just an emotional workup i don't need
[21:32] it some people think this isn't for me
[21:34] some young people think this is not for
[21:36] me i don't want to be religious fanatic
[21:39] this is not for me so i'm thinking as
[21:41] soon as i can get out on my own i'm out
[21:43] of here
[21:44] these young young people think that it's
[21:47] all thoughts your thoughts satan's
[21:49] thoughts but it's not god's thoughts for
[21:51] you
[21:55] some thinking i'm too good for this i
[21:56] don't need to believe this i'm fine i
[21:59] got everything i need
[22:01] i don't need to accept christ completely
[22:03] and sell out lock stock and barrel i
[22:05] don't need to do that
[22:07] that's thoughts
[22:08] so you look at this
[22:09] these millions of thoughts going on in
[22:12] the other world
[22:14] no wonder god gets restricted
[22:18] no wonder god gets restricted
[22:21] in what he can do
[22:24] and i'm not trying to preach guilt on us
[22:26] tonight i'm trying to preach
[22:29] that our thoughts can quench and hinder
[22:32] how far god can go
[22:35] our thoughts can
[22:36] can stop
[22:39] how god wants to go deeper in our lives
[22:42] our thoughts can stop healing that what
[22:45] god wants to give you
[22:47] your thought can stop you from the
[22:50] healing
[22:51] i notice people that that they ask for
[22:54] you to pray for them but they're going
[22:56] to continue the pattern of of believing
[22:59] what the doctor said as if it's a final
[23:01] say i've got this he says i have this
[23:03] they give it a name he says i'll have
[23:05] this for life and they themselves buy
[23:08] into the idea that i have it for life
[23:10] we we don't know that the doctor doesn't
[23:12] really have the authority to say that
[23:14] especially when god is involved but
[23:16] their thought process i want to be
[23:17] healed but they have a mentality that
[23:19] they keep hashing it over and keep
[23:21] reminding this is my problem this is my
[23:23] problem this is my you know this is with
[23:25] me and and i got to do this and i got to
[23:27] do this to compensate for this and and
[23:29] so so now i'm trying to be respectful of
[23:31] the fact that god uses different things
[23:34] to help you and to aid you and to i'm
[23:37] not preaching against that i'm preaching
[23:39] against the thought life that has given
[23:42] up
[23:44] in the healing of god
[23:46] you can't ever give up on the power of
[23:49] god's healing of any disease
[23:55] including coven
[24:00] you guys got that
[24:02] um
[24:03] slide up there about omnicrom or
[24:05] whatever it's called
[24:20] i didn't
[24:21] i didn't
[24:22] i'm just putting somebody sent that to
[24:24] me and i'm putting it up
[24:26] probably get in trouble for doing it but
[24:29] i'll tell you who sent it to
[24:30] me brother
[24:32] the brother the preacher a couple weeks
[24:34] ago
[24:36] brother kathy
[24:38] and because the week after
[24:40] or that weekend they went home and they
[24:42] got covered
[24:45] and right in the middle of having
[24:46] covered him and his wife and family
[24:48] you're starting to learn the kind of man
[24:50] he is
[24:52] he sends us this because he's going to
[24:54] give the devil back because you have to
[24:55] remind the devil and you have to remind
[24:57] yourself
[24:59] it's real it's it's happening
[25:01] we protect ourselves we do what we can
[25:04] but never buy into the idea that this
[25:06] isn't touchable by the blood of the lamb
[25:12] all right take it down before i get into
[25:13] more trouble
[25:15] i believe it
[25:17] amen i believe it
[25:19] we have to remind the devil when he
[25:21] makes it
[25:23] uh
[25:24] so
[25:25] permanent
[25:28] amen
[25:29] amen can you say amen help me out here
[25:33] so these millions of thoughts and as i
[25:35] said we exercise our rights more in the
[25:37] thought life than any other place in our
[25:40] lives
[25:42] sorry for thinking that i'm going to
[25:44] read a quote in a minute i'm sorry for
[25:45] thinking that the prophet who says
[25:47] sorry for that
[25:49] and i just think that we exercise our
[25:51] right to think what we want to think
[25:54] too much
[25:57] we have a right as an american we have a
[25:58] right and we
[26:00] technically we do have a right to think
[26:01] what we ought to think but it's such a
[26:02] private world but we give ourselves
[26:05] permission to think
[26:07] sometimes we give ourselves permission
[26:08] to say whatever we want to say i tell
[26:10] you you better say lord help me to say
[26:13] a word in season and the right thing
[26:16] help me to say the right things and when
[26:18] i say the wrong thing to make it right
[26:20] can you say amen but don't give yourself
[26:22] permission to say whatever you want i
[26:24] say what i want when i want to say it
[26:26] there's a right thing to say
[26:28] and sometimes there's the right thing to
[26:30] say
[26:31] in the right setting
[26:33] because you might be saying the truth
[26:36] or you might be saying your opinion but
[26:38] you're not watching who you're saying in
[26:40] front of
[26:42] you might be saying something in front
[26:44] of your kids that probably shouldn't be
[26:46] said sometimes
[26:48] so if that's true in our words brothers
[26:51] and sisters
[26:52] then what about our thoughts
[26:56] it's the private world it's the it's the
[26:58] closed world have i talked about in this
[27:00] series that the the different parts of
[27:03] our thinking like the memory and
[27:04] imagination maybe we'll go into some
[27:07] series down the road here of taking each
[27:09] one of those and breaking them down how
[27:10] the devil uses them i did it years ago
[27:12] memory imagination conscience affection
[27:14] reason have i mentioned to you that your
[27:16] imagination part of yourself
[27:19] can think its thoughts think lustful
[27:22] thoughts think dirty thoughts
[27:24] you don't even have to look at something
[27:25] which when you look at things it's wrong
[27:28] because it just encourages it
[27:30] but the human being
[27:31] can
[27:33] in his imagination part
[27:35] can develop his own
[27:37] pornography
[27:38] and her own dirty thoughts
[27:41] the imagination has the power to create
[27:44] your own movie in your imagination
[27:47] create your own movie direct it
[27:49] write it direct it create it and sit in
[27:52] the theater of your imagination and
[27:55] watch it
[27:58] that's how powerful it is and nobody's
[28:00] seen it nobody caught you clicking on
[28:03] something on your computer or your phone
[28:07] you see so this is this is about the
[28:08] heart this is about a rule stay away
[28:11] from things on your phone watch over
[28:13] this and you get you get the holy ghost
[28:15] in your life and you lean on that power
[28:17] you're not going to be turned into those
[28:19] things
[28:23] you need something deeper
[28:25] and you need a deeper experience
[28:28] if you keep justifying that and keep
[28:30] going over and over and over again with
[28:32] it no you need a deeper experience but
[28:34] you know what it's a heart thing because
[28:35] if you've never seen another piece of
[28:37] something wrong and you lived in a world
[28:39] you never seen a woman scantily dressed
[28:41] in this world you would still have the
[28:43] power within your flesh
[28:46] to create the wrong things
[28:48] in your thinking
[28:51] it's true
[28:52] and so so i've never watched any of that
[28:54] that's i wonder sometimes i've never
[28:56] blessed god i've never seen any of that
[28:59] bless god well what have you watched in
[29:02] your imagination
[29:04] because you're just as guilty
[29:07] this is a heart matter
[29:08] this is what's in your spirit and the
[29:10] private secret places
[29:13] god sees when no one else sees
[29:18] i'm just asking you to think about and
[29:19] pray about it because this is real i
[29:21] mean we have yeah it's it's and so and
[29:24] so let's let me continue with the
[29:26] thoughts about what god's seeing that we
[29:29] think about it
[29:31] you know there's there's a reason that
[29:33] god looks into this area of our thought
[29:35] life and another reason why god looks
[29:37] into this is that he wants to correct
[29:40] those thoughts he wants to deliver you
[29:42] from those thoughts maybe as i spoke
[29:44] tonight you've been corrected and you're
[29:46] in my i need to bring this under
[29:47] subjection to the holy spirit god wants
[29:49] to correct those things in all of us and
[29:52] stop
[29:53] talking yourself out of just simple
[29:55] faith in god's word stop overthinking
[29:58] things can you say amen
[30:00] god's god stop overthinking god's
[30:03] already thought all of this through
[30:09] before the foundation of the world
[30:11] you're trying to think things through
[30:13] and you're trying to overthink it and
[30:15] i'm here to tell you tonight i'm here to
[30:16] tell the world god has already got
[30:19] everything thought through
[30:24] that all you make you say well praise
[30:26] the lord i don't have to overthink it i
[30:28] just submit my life to the thought of
[30:29] god a walk in his will god direct me
[30:31] tell me how to make decisions because
[30:34] guess what you've already thought it all
[30:36] through
[30:37] why would you want to think it through
[30:39] when god's already thought it through
[30:43] just saying i'm just saying why would
[30:45] you want to spend all that wasted time
[30:48] trying to how am i going to do this
[30:54] i'm using my
[30:56] fist but see what's happening in your
[30:58] thinking
[30:59] [Music]
[31:06] and from what i know of the message of
[31:08] what the prophet taught us about
[31:11] a prophet
[31:12] he reaches back into the very thoughts
[31:14] of god and he's not thinking it today
[31:16] he's not god's not going
[31:18] okay so how can i direct brother ray
[31:20] today
[31:22] um let me think this through you know he
[31:24] already thought it through
[31:27] before the foundation before you were
[31:28] around
[31:31] and how many remember the scripture in
[31:32] jeremiah i should have read it tonight
[31:33] but you know it so well
[31:35] when god says to jeremiah hey
[31:38] my thoughts
[31:39] are higher than your thoughts
[31:43] my ways
[31:45] i higher
[31:46] than your ways
[31:48] and i'd rather trust in a god who's got
[31:50] it all thought through already
[31:54] than to try to work it out myself
[31:57] yeah tell your friends if we believe in
[31:58] god and that he's omnipresent and he's
[32:01] all these omni things and if we believe
[32:03] it then he's got it all thought through
[32:07] sons of god
[32:09] have a predestinated plan that god had
[32:11] before the foundation of the world and
[32:13] even predestinated trials for you
[32:22] amen praise the lord
[32:28] i wonder if some of you are thinking
[32:32] i wish he just wrapped this up sunday
[32:34] and not continued on
[32:36] this is getting pretty in this is down
[32:39] pretty deep here
[32:41] trust me i when i'm pointing my finger
[32:44] at you i've got three pointing back at
[32:46] me
[32:48] it's true
[32:50] this ministers to all of us can you say
[32:52] amen
[32:54] did it ever occur to you that nothing's
[32:55] ever occurred to god
[33:01] did it ever occur to you
[33:04] that nothing has ever occurred to god
[33:08] he's got this
[33:11] and if you let him
[33:13] he will take matters
[33:15] in his own hands
[33:19] i wrote a song sharon here
[33:21] all right then i'll have to sing it he's
[33:22] taken matters
[33:24] in his own hand
[33:28] when i'm overwhelmed he understands
[33:31] well my boat may reel and rock until
[33:34] jesus takes command and he takes those
[33:37] matters
[33:38] in his own hands
[33:42] you can't sing in the service you're a
[33:44] preacher you can't do that well you
[33:46] can't tell me what to do
[33:49] you're not my grandchild you can't tell
[33:50] me what to do
[33:53] only her
[33:55] he's taking matters
[33:57] in his own hands
[34:01] when i'm overwhelmed he understands
[34:06] my boat may reel and rock until jesus
[34:09] takes command and he takes those matters
[34:12] in his own hand
[34:14] did it ever occur to you that nothing's
[34:16] ever occurred to god
[34:19] did you ever latch onto that thought
[34:21] tonight that says
[34:23] why do we have to overthink stuff
[34:24] because god has already
[34:27] thought this all through
[34:30] and sons of god are coming more and more
[34:33] in line
[34:34] with his thoughts that he had of them
[34:36] before the foundation of the world
[34:38] what's all this preaching what says all
[34:40] this opening up the seals in 1963 to
[34:42] god's people what's this opening of the
[34:44] book of redemption what is this
[34:46] preaching for the last 40 or 50 years
[34:48] from an open book of the open seals
[34:50] what's all the preaching what's the
[34:51] total of all what's the it's it's
[34:54] the sons of god realizing god's thought
[34:57] all this through
[34:59] and they're coming in line with god's
[35:01] thoughts
[35:02] there are sisters here living out in
[35:04] their heart and also in their dress
[35:07] god's thoughts of them before the
[35:08] foundation of the world they're doing it
[35:10] every day
[35:11] there are young men that are living out
[35:13] what a godly young man does and he's why
[35:16] he's catching the thought of god that
[35:18] i'm not supposed to be some scallywag in
[35:21] the world feeding on the things of the
[35:22] world he's called me and seen me before
[35:25] the foundation of the world to walk as a
[35:27] young man holy and clean not bound by
[35:30] lustful spirits
[35:32] he's caught the thought of god that's
[35:34] not me out there this is me right here
[35:35] in the word of god can i get an amen
[35:37] tonight god has already thought your
[35:40] life through
[35:42] even your predestinated trials
[35:46] we get in trouble when we start thinking
[35:48] we can just go off of that a little bit
[35:50] and start doing a little sideshow over
[35:52] here and it's going to try this out you
[35:54] better be careful and say lord bring me
[35:56] back into what your thought was for me
[35:58] for the foundation of the world
[36:01] man i just the lord the holy spirit just
[36:02] keeps helping to linger on that i don't
[36:05] know why
[36:06] so now
[36:07] it was a different gift
[36:09] to perceive the thoughts through the
[36:10] prophet even though he could do it again
[36:14] today
[36:16] they they had the people had to believe
[36:18] so let me just skip down here into some
[36:20] more of the quotes so uh yeah let me
[36:23] skip down here next quote and this this
[36:25] one would be in um testimony and get to
[36:27] these tonight because i didn't get to on
[36:29] sunday so notice now how in this thing
[36:32] that that they're in a service
[36:34] and notice how thoughts can can stop god
[36:38] okay
[36:39] let me see your hands just a moment i
[36:41] want to talk to you a moment brother
[36:43] this is the first case course tonight
[36:46] but i believe you have a tumor isn't
[36:48] that right
[36:49] a tumor it hit like a tumor and every
[36:52] time i start to make say something else
[36:55] it was because
[36:56] i was i couldn't believe it in my heart
[36:59] that it was a spirit that would be i
[37:01] couldn't hardly think in my heart my own
[37:03] heart that that young fellow would have
[37:06] a tumor so now brother branham is saying
[37:09] i i took him by the hand and you
[37:11] remember the sign that he had was that
[37:13] what what color his hand would turn
[37:16] and for those of you
[37:18] uh listening who would not understand
[37:19] that i respect that but um if god sent
[37:23] moses with two signs
[37:24] and he said and jesus said he sent he
[37:28] sent another prophet in the end time he
[37:30] came with two signs like moses and so
[37:32] one of them was if you study it is that
[37:35] when they grab their hand whatever kind
[37:37] of color that would turn he could tell
[37:39] the disease what disease they had
[37:42] so he's thinking when he did that it
[37:44] showed us a tumor and when he did that
[37:47] he in his own thoughts is saying this
[37:49] man is too young to have a tumor
[37:52] a lot of times we think that somebody
[37:53] asked me to pray the other day for a
[37:55] woman who's 31 years old and got cancer
[37:58] it just seems my goodness wow
[38:01] they're just too young for that but it's
[38:03] happening he said he thought he didn't
[38:05] say he thought
[38:07] this is this man is too young i couldn't
[38:10] think it in my own heart a young fellow
[38:12] would have a tumor i thought it might be
[38:14] something else some other something but
[38:16] it wasn't it was a tumor and the spirit
[38:18] every time i'd start say something it'd
[38:21] feel it break up tumor tumor tumor and i
[38:24] just couldn't hardly i'm ashamed of
[38:25] myself and apologize
[38:28] before
[38:30] god and there it is right there
[38:34] praise god
[38:35] that we have a man of god
[38:38] that is actually saying when i'm
[38:39] thinking wait a minute it can't be a
[38:41] tumor it can't be a tumor and the holy
[38:43] spirit's saying it's a tumor it can't be
[38:45] a tumor that's his own thoughts
[38:48] and until you get the acknowledgement of
[38:50] what the thing actually is
[38:52] you're not going to go anywhere
[38:55] so he's apologizing before god because
[38:57] right there in the prayer line he's got
[38:58] his own thinking interrupting
[39:02] he's got his own thinking interrupting
[39:04] he's got his own thinking
[39:09] can you say amen
[39:11] he's got his own thinking
[39:15] interrupting
[39:17] and this is when our thoughts
[39:19] gets in god's way
[39:23] your thoughts can get in god's way
[39:30] so
[39:31] i apologize before god i'm ashamed of
[39:33] myself james
[39:35] did he sin did he say something wrong he
[39:38] thought it
[39:40] and the thought was contrary to the
[39:43] revealing of what was really happening
[39:45] sorry lord
[39:47] my thoughts are getting in the way here
[39:48] but but that's what it is it's what is
[39:50] it it's a tumor now young man now he
[39:53] turns to the young man only god can heal
[39:55] you you know don't you you're just a
[39:56] laddy boy you want to serve him don't
[39:59] you brother will you do it if he lets
[40:01] you get well and you'll serve him all
[40:03] your life

[40:12] him now and may the spirit of the lord
[40:14] be upon him to make him well may this
[40:18] evil power that's on him may it leave
[40:20] and go away may he be healed in the name
[40:23] of jesus christ now just a moment
[40:26] audience it holds him i just want you to
[40:29] if you've listened a lot of the prayer
[40:31] lines you can see sometimes this will
[40:32] happen sometimes he sends them off the
[40:34] stage and goes to the next person but he
[40:36] says now wait a minute wait a minute it
[40:38] holds him
[40:40] in other words he's not healed yet
[40:44] he's not healed yet
[40:47] now you may raise your hand just in a
[40:49] moment if you want i want to see
[40:51] something here young man to increase
[40:53] your faith
[40:55] you're nervous
[40:57] and try to think
[41:00] your own
[41:01] thoughts
[41:03] so i wanted to read this because it
[41:05] shows us that
[41:07] you have the prophet's thoughts saying
[41:09] this can't be a tumor i don't think
[41:10] that's that and he has to correct that
[41:13] and now he's praying for the man and ask
[41:15] him in the name of the lord jesus christ
[41:17] to be healed of this tumor and then he
[41:19] stopped said now wait a minute
[41:20] something's wrong he's still nervous
[41:22] he's still nervous and he says you're
[41:24] trying to think your own thoughts
[41:27] trying to think your own thought so not
[41:29] only brother branham interrupted it with
[41:31] an assault not only brother branham now
[41:33] this boy and brother brown many times i
[41:36] want to see this person healed
[41:38] and so now he gives them instruction
[41:40] you're trying to think your own thoughts
[41:42] and you're nervous so god has to
[41:44] minister to somebody so they say lord
[41:46] calm their nerves settle them down from
[41:49] thinking their own thoughts i don't know
[41:51] what he was standing there thinking but
[41:53] it was keeping him from his healing
[41:55] has anybody ever done that before has
[41:57] everybody ever thinking thoughts even
[42:00] sometimes when you're being prayed for
[42:01] and i think we need to bring our
[42:02] thoughts and lie and say listen nothing
[42:04] else matters right now god
[42:06] if a body of christ a member of the body
[42:08] of christ
[42:10] and a minister like sunday touches them
[42:12] that's why i said before the service do
[42:14] you believe that your pastor could lay
[42:16] hands on you or a minister of the gospel
[42:18] or even another member of the body of
[42:20] christ the worst disease do you believe
[42:22] in simple faith that if they touched you
[42:24] you can be completely healed
[42:27] but but but no no no no buts do you
[42:29] simply believe it
[42:31] it doesn't even say to pray it just says
[42:34] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[42:36] recover
[42:41] doesn't even say to pray we pray
[42:45] but it's just laying on that's what he
[42:46] referred to one time he says for a
[42:48] believer he said science shows that
[42:51] light passes from one member of the body
[42:53] of christ light passes to their body
[42:55] when they lay hands on them now i don't
[42:57] believe you have to lay hands on i think
[42:59] as the
[43:00] uh the one man in the days of jesus said
[43:03] just speak the word can you say amen
[43:06] but then we got the way of laying on
[43:08] hands but it's not it's the faith of it
[43:10] it's not what you say in your prayer
[43:13] it's the power behind it
[43:16] it's the life
[43:17] behind the name
[43:20] if we've got the goods we don't have to
[43:22] be afraid of cancer if we've got the
[43:25] goods we we have to be afraid as parents
[43:28] to lay our hands on our kids
[43:30] if we've got the goods we don't have to
[43:31] be afraid when we pray god deliver save
[43:34] my kids from this direction they're
[43:36] going whatever it is we have to have
[43:37] simple faith that when i say it and pray
[43:39] it it goes to the throne of god
[43:43] everything is under the blood i'm asking
[43:45] forgiveness for everything it's there
[43:46] and now i stand with boldness before my
[43:49] kinsmen redeemer before my high priest
[43:52] can you say a man and i don't there's no
[43:54] unworthiness to this he makes me worthy
[43:57] to pray a prayer of faith
[44:00] sometimes they say and when i go over
[44:02] there and lay hands on that person i'm
[44:04] not even going to pray i've already
[44:06] prayed i'm going to lay hands on them
[44:07] and that's it i believe they're going to
[44:09] be healed
[44:12] but here brother branham has a thought
[44:13] that interrupts it and this young man is
[44:16] not getting
[44:18] in a moment that tumor can die and he
[44:20] can be healed and what's holding him up
[44:22] is his nervousness
[44:25] and thinking too many thoughts about it
[44:28] i asked you tonight if you don't get
[44:29] anything else out of the service i ask
[44:31] you to ponder and pray about what he's
[44:33] saying here
[44:35] because i do believe sometimes we are
[44:38] quenching what god could do
[44:40] because we're overthinking it
[44:42] we're too nervous about it
[44:44] too nervous about where this can go
[44:48] it can go a lot of places but for you to
[44:50] be nervous about we can't get ourselves
[44:52] into just resting
[44:55] that no matter how bad a disease no
[44:57] matter how bad the sickness no matter
[44:58] how bad the condition a person's in no
[45:00] matter how low they've gotten no matter
[45:02] how far that child has went out in the
[45:04] world no matter how messed up and
[45:06] mentally they are no matter how bad a a
[45:09] child is thinking immature thoughts and
[45:11] not thinking like an adult like they
[45:13] should it doesn't matter how bad it is
[45:15] we have to rest in our prayer that god
[45:18] is bigger than all of this can i get an
[45:21] amen from somebody tonight
[45:23] overthinking he wants just simply us to
[45:26] simply believe the word of god i'm
[45:28] closing here after this quote
[45:30] god knows all things
[45:32] and we have to rest in that please don't
[45:34] forget that quote
[45:35] the young man was overthinking it
[45:37] the young man was thinking his own
[45:39] thoughts about it and right there the
[45:41] thought of god the thought of god from
[45:43] the foundation of the world said i knew
[45:46] that this would be here i knew the young
[45:48] man would have a tumor and i know
[45:49] tonight that tumor is going to die
[45:51] that's god's thought
[45:54] but he's thinking his own thoughts this
[45:55] young man brother brahms say it couldn't
[45:57] be a tumor the thoughts of stopping us
[45:59] up
[46:01] once they just let that go
[46:03] and later in the quote the man is healed
[46:06] i didn't put it in he's healed of the
[46:08] tumor
[46:09] praise the lord
[46:12] last quote
[46:13] in testimony all right bring the lady
[46:17] howdy i've i've learned a lot in the
[46:19] last
[46:20] 30 years friends of listening to the
[46:21] prayer lines
[46:23] i've learned a lot
[46:25] it's not only built my faith but i
[46:27] learned how god deals with his people
[46:29] through the prayer lines
[46:31] because god's the same he's the same
[46:32] yesterday today and forever and the
[46:34] manner he deals with people in manner he
[46:36] deals with their nervousness the way he
[46:37] talks to them and the holy spirit's
[46:39] always a gentleman he's something
[46:41] private is going on there they probably
[46:43] just whispered to and say what about
[46:44] this because you couldn't hold a sin
[46:46] there and get your healing you never
[46:47] blasted it over the pulpit the holy
[46:49] spirit's a gentleman he doesn't want to
[46:51] embarrass you children remember that the
[46:53] holy spirit doesn't want to embarrass
[46:54] you but when there's a call that you
[46:56] need god and need the holy ghost and you
[46:58] need a deeper walk it's not to embarrass
[47:00] you it's calling for for christ for you
[47:02] to come closer to christ
[47:04] if there's an altar or call come and get
[47:06] more of christ
[47:09] don't hold back
[47:11] bring the lady how do you do lady
[47:13] do you believe with all your heart
[47:15] you're a real you have real strange
[47:17] feelings don't you especially in the
[47:19] late part of the afternoon
[47:21] i see you getting kind of a leery weary
[47:25] like feelings
[47:29] i remember when i had coveted there's
[47:31] the distinctions in it i don't know if
[47:32] you had the same thing but you know
[47:34] after two or three weeks i was i was
[47:36] weak i didn't have a lot of extreme
[47:37] symptoms but i knew i was weak and it
[47:40] was so funny because i would get up in
[47:42] the morning and feel energy
[47:44] uh brother frame i'd get up and feel
[47:46] like okay i'm over it and i'd start
[47:48] going
[47:50] okay i can get back to what i'm supposed
[47:51] to be doing and then about an hour i
[47:53] just
[47:54] uh
[47:56] and i i completely then i go back to bed
[47:58] the rest of the day
[48:01] another thing covert brought me is it
[48:03] changed my taste forever
[48:05] i don't know what it is but it just this
[48:07] just changed my taste and my smell
[48:10] and you really didn't want to know that
[48:11] but anyway
[48:14] i thought it was really interesting i
[48:15] don't know if you ever had this but when
[48:17] you have nervousness and you have
[48:18] something going on you have strange
[48:20] feelings don't you especially in the
[48:22] late part of the afternoon something
[48:23] about it the morning you can feel fresh
[48:25] and then for this lady in the late part
[48:27] of the afternoon she starts to kind of
[48:29] get a leery weary like feelings you're
[48:31] nervous what's the matter with you it's
[48:33] due to the time
[48:34] of menopause it's the changing time of
[48:36] life you get real weary thoughts
[48:39] i'm reading this i wanted to include
[48:41] this because
[48:43] this is another example of
[48:45] someone who's having a real life change
[48:48] of life menopause and it's bringing
[48:50] those things
[48:51] but it's not a demon
[48:56] some things are demons
[48:58] and some things are not
[49:01] but sometimes a lot of evangelists are
[49:03] just demons demon demon and you better
[49:06] know if it's demon or not and we'll pray
[49:07] for a demon but sometimes
[49:09] physical things of life can bring you
[49:12] down and then the devil starts beating
[49:14] you down more then a demon of depression
[49:17] can come
[49:19] but the core of the problem is she's
[49:21] going through menopause it's a changing
[49:23] time in your life and you get real weary
[49:26] thoughts real weary thoughts ever heard
[49:28] of them
[49:30] their thoughts but they're weary
[49:32] thoughts i don't even know what that is
[49:34] but anyway next one
[49:36] a few days ago when you heard of this
[49:38] meeting you told god if you'd let let if
[49:42] if he let you get up you'd be prayed for
[49:45] and you'd be healed isn't that right so
[49:47] here here's now the secrets of the heart
[49:49] he's telling her what her thought was
[49:51] and what she said to god many days
[49:52] before god if you let me get there and
[49:54] let me get up to that prayer line
[49:56] i believe i'd be healed isn't that right
[49:58] and you're taking some kind of a shots
[50:00] for that aren't you sister yes i see
[50:02] you're taking them you've seen it by
[50:04] vision she's taking shots from the
[50:06] doctor to help her with her weariness or
[50:07] whatever it is and all the things she's
[50:09] going through she's taking shots from
[50:11] the doctor yes i see you're taking it i
[50:14] see them give it to you in the isn't
[50:15] that right come here do you believe me
[50:18] as god's prophet have i told you the
[50:20] truth and you believe that comes from
[50:23] god of course she says yes it's all the
[50:25] truth he's exposed it he's talked about
[50:27] what the doctor says well if i told you
[50:30] what truth what was truth then by the
[50:32] spirit of god i'll tell you what's truth
[50:35] now oh i love that i love that because
[50:37] the same god who knows the past
[50:40] is the same god who knows the future
[50:43] and if he can tell you your past your
[50:45] past
[50:46] so accurately that you couldn't deny it
[50:49] then the same god can tell you
[50:51] accurately what your future is i love it
[50:53] friends and if i told you what truth
[50:55] then by the spirit of god i tell you
[50:56] what truth now you go out of here
[50:58] be real happy you're going to be well
[51:01] for christ has blessed you and you're
[51:04] going out to be well god bless you
[51:06] sister yes man praise the lord
[51:12] i'll tell you what's truth
[51:14] she had to believe what was truth
[51:15] there's no demon that he talks about
[51:17] there
[51:18] his weary thoughts
[51:20] physical condition
[51:21] that's real to life can you say amen
[51:26] weary thoughts and how does he do it
[51:27] well
[51:29] i know for the one sister that he
[51:31] told that she was going through
[51:33] menopause
[51:35] and she's curled up in the chair in the
[51:38] office and she's just
[51:40] nervous and just moving around and
[51:42] looking at things and
[51:44] and she says well i come to find out
[51:46] because i have three preachers one
[51:47] preacher told me i had
[51:49] five demons and one preacher told me i
[51:50] had ten and the other picture had more
[51:52] than that and these are all evangelists
[51:55] that told her you got demons
[51:58] she said i come to you she says i really
[52:00] want to know from how many demons do i
[52:01] actually have she's not even at the
[52:03] point asked for healing anymore
[52:06] just figure out how many demons
[52:08] and he said he said he just prayed he
[52:10] talked to the woman
[52:11] and you know it just it just kind of
[52:13] catching what's going on and then the
[52:15] lord revealed it sister you don't have
[52:17] any demons you don't have one demon
[52:20] you're going through the time of life
[52:21] here
[52:22] and you're real nervous about it it's
[52:24] messing all your hormones up and all
[52:25] this other stuff you're going through
[52:27] you don't have any but but she goes well
[52:29] but
[52:30] but what about the thing
[52:32] i think that's
[52:33] the thing
[52:35] what about about how many sister sister
[52:37] you don't have any
[52:40] demons
[52:43] [Music]
[52:45] and and so then he asked her did you
[52:47] want something to eat and before she
[52:48] said no i don't want to eat she doesn't
[52:50] eat the nervousness can make people not
[52:52] eat properly and all this other things
[52:54] and now
[52:55] i've always used the scripture here
[52:58] you shall know the truth
[53:00] and the truth shall set you free
[53:02] you know brother ray that's not just
[53:04] truth is not just the serpency doctrine
[53:06] and the godhead
[53:08] it's the truth about your life
[53:10] you can take a lie of the enemy from the
[53:12] doctor or from your own thoughts but you
[53:14] want to know what god's thought isn't
[53:16] about it
[53:18] can you say man
[53:20] and this woman she began to settle down
[53:21] he said in the office
[53:23] and then he asks are you hungry she says
[53:25] yeah
[53:26] i'm kind of hungry
[53:28] she said well what do i do about the
[53:30] demon she he said i'm telling you again
[53:32] there's no demons what do i need to do
[53:34] right now go home
[53:36] cook your husband a big apple pie
[53:39] clean your house
[53:42] like you said to this woman go on happy
[53:44] rejoicing
[53:46] rest in god
[53:47] you know sometimes people don't want to
[53:49] hear that advice i can't do that they're
[53:51] too nervous but if you settle down and
[53:52] rest in the lord you go back to normal
[53:54] functions of life and say lord i'm i
[53:57] know this is just a normal thing i will
[53:59] come through it god will get me through
[54:01] it and i'm going to focus on what i need
[54:03] to focus on here and just love the lord
[54:05] and it's not any more complicated than
[54:08] that
[54:11] he said kind of hungry took her in the
[54:13] kitchen he said she had three eggs and
[54:15] toast and
[54:16] she had he said she ate a lot
[54:20] she's hungry she hadn't he wasn't eating
[54:22] she was a mess and it wasn't a demon it
[54:24] was her nerves it got the the best of
[54:27] her because of the hormonal thing she
[54:29] was going through i love it when he says
[54:31] sis go on your way happy rejoicing he's
[54:35] trying to teach him change your thoughts
[54:37] don't overthink this just think god's
[54:40] thoughts rest and it may not happen
[54:42] overnight but that's his instruction
[54:44] people are looking you need to fast for
[54:46] 40 days to get rid of this sometimes
[54:49] that's needed but sometimes it's just go
[54:51] on your way and change your attitude be
[54:53] happy
[54:54] enjoy the things that god has given you
[54:57] enjoy the children god has given you
[54:59] enjoy your wife enjoy your husband enjoy
[55:01] the services enjoy the word and stop
[55:04] thinking about everything so much
[55:06] and god will bring you through this time
[55:08] of menopause god will bring you through
[55:10] this time of midlife crisis when you're
[55:13] all messed up you know guys go through
[55:15] midlife crisis as well
[55:18] boy i didn't get any amens on that
[55:21] just as real as a woman she goes through
[55:23] it too and we're all over here saying
[55:26] why don't you just straighten up and we
[55:28] go through it too we internalize all of
[55:30] it
[55:31] and then
[55:32] we probably blow up and blow off
[55:35] but she doesn't internalize that thing
[55:37] but we go through it too and it's a real
[55:39] thing of life
[55:42] all the young people are saying what in
[55:43] the world is he talking about
[55:46] some things that happen to us are real
[55:48] we start
[55:50] allowing it to get us too nervous and
[55:52] overthinking things anybody heard that
[55:54] tonight
[55:56] overthinking thing doesn't do it because
[55:58] he's already got everything
[56:00] thought through he's taken matters

[58:43] i'd rather bring my thoughts under
[58:45] subjection

[59:11] man that was nervous and the lord is
[59:14] such examples to us of how you love us
[59:16] and how you deal with us and how you
[59:18] want us to lay aside our own thinking
[59:20] and our own thoughts
[59:22] and embrace what the word says that
[59:24] you're going to do in us lord to believe
[59:27] by simple faith that you are more than
[59:30] able to accomplish anything that you
[59:32] want to in our lives
