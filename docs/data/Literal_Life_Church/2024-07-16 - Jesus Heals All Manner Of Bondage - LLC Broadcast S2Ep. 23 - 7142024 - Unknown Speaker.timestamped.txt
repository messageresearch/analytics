[2:54] together hand in
[3:03] everywhere I
[3:06] go every time I
[3:10] call when I need you most you here and
[3:15] answer
[3:18] all and I am well aware you are always
[3:24] there everywhere
[3:39] way Matthew chapter 4 verse 23 Jesus
[3:44] went about all Galilee teaching in their
[3:47] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[3:49] the kingdom and healing all manner of
[3:53] sickness and all manner of disease among
[3:55] the people so it's not just the teaching
[3:58] that Jesus gives us us but he heals all
[4:02] manner of disease and sickness and
[4:04] notice it's all manner he covers all of
[4:07] it can you say amen and his Fame went
[4:09] throughout all Syria and they brought
[4:12] unto him all sick people that were taken
[4:14] with many diseases diverse diseases and
[4:17] torments and those which were possessed
[4:20] with Devils how many believe that we
[4:22] still have people today that are
[4:24] tormented we still have people today
[4:27] that are depressed and under oppression
[4:30] probably even more so than it what it
[4:31] was in the days of Jesus and so if we
[4:34] still have that going on then we still
[4:37] need the same Christ to come in our
[4:39] midst to not only preach to us but to
[4:42] minister freedom to those that are bound
[4:45] and so those who were possessed with
[4:47] Devils those that were lunatic and those
[4:50] that had py and he healed them and there
[4:53] followed him great multitudes of people
[4:55] from Galilee and from the other cities
[4:58] here Jerusalem de
[5:00] Judea and Beyond Jordan but I want you
[5:03] to remember that statement again
[5:04] entitled this this morning Jesus heals
[5:06] all manner of bondage the word says that
[5:09] Jesus is able to heal all manner of
[5:11] sickness all manner of torment and all
[5:15] manner of bondage you remember we've
[5:16] been speaking of freedom and this
[5:19] glorious Freedom that the children of
[5:21] God have in the truth because Jesus said
[5:24] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[5:26] shall make you free this glorious
[5:29] freedom in truth can bring deliverance
[5:31] from all forms of bondage and I read a
[5:34] quote if they want to put it up in
[5:36] communion last week I read this quote
[5:38] and I thought thought it was so powerful
[5:40] in brother bram's prayer when I see the
[5:43] these blood grapes uh the blood of
[5:45] grapes in this communion service I know
[5:48] it represents the blood that came forth
[5:51] from the Lord Jesus body it's not his
[5:54] blood but it represents his blood May
[5:56] every who receives this have eternal
[5:59] life
[6:00] May sickness depart out of their bodies
[6:03] May weariness and feebleness oppression
[6:07] May the devil in every form leave
[6:11] them may the devil in every form leave
[6:15] these people how many believe that the
[6:18] blood of Jesus Christ is powerful enough
[6:21] to cause the devil to run in every form
[6:24] that he comes in the blood is more
[6:26] powerful than any disease the blood is
[6:28] more powerful than any form of Satan and
[6:31] we know that and he finishes it by
[6:33] saying that they might have great
[6:35] strength and health and so he's praying
[6:38] that the people that are oppressed the
[6:40] people that feel feeble the people that
[6:42] feel weary and they've got sickness in
[6:44] their body and even oppression he's
[6:47] praying that they would have great
[6:48] strength and health and eternal life to
[6:51] let their light shine before this wicked
[6:54] and adulterous generation we live in and
[6:56] to glorify God what a prayer and it's my
[6:59] prayer this morning that this people and
[7:02] any people we can minister to would go
[7:04] from oppression and weariness to
[7:07] strength to health to eternal life so
[7:11] that you can be your very best to let
[7:13] your light shine before
[7:15] men what a prayer can you say amen and
[7:18] that's just how how much I believe a
[7:20] human being can be set free that you can
[7:23] God never intended you to live in
[7:25] darkness and in the mully grubs your
[7:26] whole life and living under depression
[7:28] God never intended for you to live that
[7:30] way but to let your light shine before
[7:32] man and to be living free in the Lord
[7:35] Jesus Christ and in his word and so he
[7:37] sets free from every devil in every form
[7:40] a human being can when they when they
[7:42] believe can not only have power to
[7:45] become the sons of God how many know the
[7:46] Bible says that when you receive him
[7:49] they receive power to become Sons and
[7:51] Daughters of God it didn't say that we
[7:54] necessarily had to go through 10 years
[7:56] of Seminary to get to become a son when
[7:58] you receive receive the word you receive
[8:01] a power to become Sons and Daughters of
[8:04] God hallelujah but not only have a power
[8:07] to become sons of God but to move into a
[8:10] life of overcoming the devil's bondage
[8:14] in your life in any form and sometimes
[8:16] even Christians there's years before
[8:18] they're set free of the bondage that
[8:20] they have some nights it's just one
[8:22] moment he takes a habit away and they
[8:24] never go back to that cigarette again
[8:26] they never go back to that alcohol again
[8:29] sometimes God can deliver that way but
[8:31] then as I speak of other forms of
[8:33] bondage you stay with the Lord he'll
[8:36] deliver you even more he'll make you
[8:38] more free of other things that you
[8:40] didn't realize you had there so one of
[8:42] the things that we were saying Saints is
[8:44] physical bondage is most recognizable uh
[8:47] that's the most recognizable type of
[8:49] bondage when someone's under the bondage
[8:51] of a certain sickness or a posy we can
[8:54] see it in their body so it's more
[8:56] recognizable it's a bondage that we can
[8:58] see when someone is in prison we know
[9:01] they're in bondage that's a physical
[9:03] form that we can say that's bondage but
[9:05] it's the other forms of bondage that are
[9:08] not talked about too much and Satan
[9:11] hides them and Satan hides them in
[9:13] people's lives and some people don't
[9:15] even know they're Bound by
[9:18] something until God reveals it Jesus
[9:21] said to the Pharisees religious
[9:25] men you're
[9:27] bound and they got defens of said we're
[9:30] Abraham's children we're not bound by
[9:32] anything and yet the eyes of the Lord
[9:33] said you're bound by your Traditions
[9:36] you're bound by your religion so those
[9:38] Pharisees were Bound by something and
[9:40] didn't really know they weren't free yet
[9:43] but he said he who the sun sets free is
[9:45] free indeed you come in contact with
[9:48] this light of this hour it's going to
[9:50] set you free just going back to some
[9:53] foundational things that we talked about
[9:55] but but you see then people say
[9:58] sometimes and I'm just going to go into
[9:59] a few more of these and I won't be
[10:01] lengthy today the Lord willing I I'll be
[10:03] short but please be listening because I
[10:05] want to go into a few more of these
[10:07] things that are bondage that don't
[10:09] necessarily look like
[10:11] bondage and you may have some of them
[10:14] even
[10:15] you so you need to be listening because
[10:18] we don't want to be in under any form of
[10:20] bondage we want to be free and people
[10:23] say sometimes they have freedom from
[10:25] something while really they're in
[10:27] bondage to something else I got free
[10:29] freedom from this but they're in bondage
[10:31] to something else they're blind to it
[10:33] and then you have people say I'm free to
[10:36] do whatever I
[10:37] want how many's ever heard that before
[10:40] how many heard it from their teenager
[10:42] this
[10:44] week how many of you said it when you
[10:46] were a teenager can't wait for the day
[10:48] that I'm free to do whatever I
[10:51] want and later you learn no that's not
[10:55] really Freedom
[10:56] am my freedoms in this country I have
[10:59] freedoms as an American can you say Amen
[11:01] but they have misinterpreted freedoms
[11:04] that they can sin they can murder they
[11:06] can kill they can change change
[11:08] absolutes can you say amen and they have
[11:10] the freedom to do whatever they want no
[11:12] that's not Freedom that's not true
[11:14] Freedom I'm free to do what I want but
[11:17] that may be in itself bondage too the
[11:19] world's freedom is highly sellable in
[11:22] other words you can sell the world's
[11:24] freedom very easy Moy that looks like
[11:26] Freedom that looks like I'll be free but
[11:29] all the time it Woos us into some
[11:31] so-called freedom and it can only bring
[11:33] bondage to our life and there's no
[11:36] freedom in this world there's no freedom
[11:38] in a marriage of this world there's no
[11:41] freedom in in in uh there's no freedom
[11:44] in in in what the world has to offer
[11:46] there's no freedom in the all the
[11:48] entertainments of the world it only
[11:50] ultimately brings bondage so if we have
[11:54] witnesses of that this morning then we
[11:55] need to realize stop falling young
[11:58] person stop falling for the lure or for
[12:00] the the world wooing you and selling it
[12:03] that it's Freedom stop following don't
[12:05] be gullible some of your closest
[12:08] brothers and sisters even your parents
[12:10] can identify I've been there done that
[12:12] got the t-shirt and I can tell you
[12:14] there's only freedom in the Lord Jesus
[12:17] Christ Hallelujah so one writer said
[12:20] when we use our Liberty as an
[12:23] opportunity for our flesh we stick our
[12:26] head through the Yoke of bondage all
[12:28] over
[12:31] again can you read it again yes thank
[12:34] you for asking when we use our Liberty
[12:38] as an opportunity for our flesh and to
[12:40] live in the flesh we stick our head
[12:42] through the Yoke of bondage all over
[12:45] again because freedom is not just
[12:47] letting the flesh do whatever it wants
[12:49] to
[12:50] do freedom is not letting our minds
[12:53] think whatever it wants to think at any
[12:55] time we got to bring these Minds subject
[12:57] to God you see you say I'm free to I'm a
[13:00] freeth thinker ever heard of that before
[13:03] I'm a free thinker I let my kids be a
[13:05] free thinker I don't force them into
[13:07] anything no no no you got it all wrong I
[13:09] let them no if it's a free thinker
[13:11] there's a lot of freeth thinkers in
[13:13] prison
[13:15] today because they had no Holy Ghost to
[13:18] bring that mind under the right
[13:21] thing and so they free thinking is what
[13:23] got them into trouble and so we find
[13:26] then that's one thing is to use our
[13:28] Liberty for the flesh and go into
[13:30] bondage again another one and and I'm
[13:33] reading some of these that I have
[13:34] researched and looked at another one is
[13:36] freedom from discipline is a form of
[13:38] bondage freedom from discipline is a is
[13:41] a complete freedom from discipline
[13:43] becomes bondage and I can give examples
[13:45] of that number three there is such a
[13:48] thing in in this world with people as an
[13:51] intellectual
[13:53] bondage intellectual or mental bondage
[13:56] results from ignorance of spiritual
[13:58] things they choose to be ignorant of
[14:01] spiritual things the Bible the word of
[14:03] God they choose to be ignorant and thus
[14:06] that makes them intellectually bound to
[14:09] receive truth Jesus said the truth will
[14:12] set you free so they're Bound by a
[14:14] certain mindset that will not receive
[14:17] truth and spiritual truth just in their
[14:19] ignorance they have intellectual bondage
[14:22] when people do not understand the
[14:24] purpose of life or their ultimate
[14:26] potential they are in bondage to
[14:29] ignorance and cannot be saved
[14:32] amen it's just stinking
[14:35] thinking stinking thinking gets in the
[14:37] way of the freedom of Christ they're
[14:39] stuck in a concrete mindset this is the
[14:43] way I've thought about it this is the
[14:44] way I've always thought about it and
[14:46] their intellectual bondage keeps them
[14:48] from freedom in Christ I only think
[14:50] about it this way sometimes they've been
[14:52] burnt in life and when they're burnt in
[14:54] life they say I will never do that I
[14:56] will never do this I'm going to think
[14:58] this way I'm I'm never letting go of
[15:00] this in my mind don't say
[15:03] that I Will Never Never Say
[15:07] Never Never Say Never because God will
[15:11] take you down certain paths to challenge
[15:13] you in that I'll never do this I'll
[15:16] never do Never Say Never God will take
[15:18] you and test
[15:19] you don't be stuck and stinking thinking
[15:22] don't be stuck it'll keep you away from
[15:24] more truth and receiving more truth
[15:27] another one people get in is Financial
[15:29] bondage finances the bondage how many
[15:32] know that being under debt is slavery
[15:34] it's
[15:35] bondage the scripture speaks of that
[15:38] Financial bondage often occurs when
[15:40] there's selfishness when there's greed
[15:42] when there's materialism that takes over
[15:44] their life and so they went after greed
[15:47] or materialism or selfishness or they
[15:49] had to have this they had to have that
[15:51] they went in debt for it instead of
[15:52] paying cash for it and when they went in
[15:54] debt sometimes for years they're under
[15:57] the bondage of debt and it's not just
[15:59] that they have this uh debt that they
[16:01] owe but they live under a cloud it can
[16:03] BR it can make you bound up in your
[16:06] spirit sometimes I'm trying to preach to
[16:08] people and they're having such trouble
[16:09] with their finances and they're nervous
[16:11] and they're scared and I understand they
[16:13] don't know what's going to happen next
[16:15] in this world the economy May crash and
[16:18] so they come and so they can't enjoy a
[16:21] service like this because they're bound
[16:23] up worrying about their
[16:26] money now is that right does money bring
[16:29] happiness no money brings
[16:33] fun but it doesn't bring
[16:36] happiness and so people get under the
[16:39] bondage of debt and the bondage of
[16:41] things and you know what uh when I get
[16:44] to the end of this today I hope I have
[16:46] time to talk about certain types of
[16:49] bondage that we have carry with
[16:52] us I wasn't going to let this out but
[16:54] I'm going to let it out right now
[16:55] because it really stirred me up last
[16:57] night there are certain forms a bondage
[16:59] that we don't have a choice in this
[17:02] world it's a pressure to
[17:04] us but I'm still going to keep pre
[17:07] preaching that we can have freedom in
[17:09] Jesus Christ even though we have
[17:12] Financial pressure
[17:14] sometimes because there's been a lot of
[17:16] other believers that's lived through a
[17:18] lot of different economies and a lot of
[17:20] different pressures back in Babylon
[17:21] Shadrach Meshach and abingo and Daniel
[17:23] they lived under pressure as young
[17:25] people that nobody's ever experienced
[17:27] until this day it was ter terrible
[17:29] pressure they were indoctrinated with
[17:31] all the doctrines of Babylon they had to
[17:33] learn it all even though they knew
[17:34] Jehovah God and they studied the books
[17:36] of Jeremiah and the prophet they had to
[17:38] be it was in it was it was forced into
[17:40] them they had to do it and so now when
[17:44] you have that it's the system that
[17:46] causes us to have to take this stuff but
[17:48] there's a still a freedom in Jesus
[17:51] Christ that I don't have to take that
[17:53] mindset into my heart or my soul can you
[17:56] say amen and I don't have to even if I'm
[17:58] in some debt and trying my best to get
[18:01] out I don't have to let that Rob me from
[18:05] enjoying the presence of the Lord and
[18:07] the freedom he's given
[18:09] me I'm not going to let the devil beat
[18:11] me up over it I'm just going to stand up
[18:14] like a Son of God and say God I got
[18:18] myself into this mess and I've I've
[18:20] prayed this prayer I don't want to tell
[18:22] the details it's gory details 10 rental
[18:25] properties they all went under the
[18:26] economy all the housing market went down
[18:29] I had 10 rental properties I'm telling
[18:31] the details ain't
[18:33] I maybe it'll help relieve me or
[18:35] something made some terrible mistakes
[18:38] and it wasn't just me and all my renters
[18:40] a lot of them worked at Jeep and the
[18:41] Jeep plant went down for a while so they
[18:43] couldn't pay rent and you know it's it's
[18:45] I tell you it's it's a a pressure and I
[18:48] had to bring that prayer to God and say
[18:50] Lord you didn't do any of this I did
[18:53] this it's kind of like
[18:56] Abraham having ishmail and he brought a
[18:59] prayer and he brought the baby and he
[19:02] said oh that ishmail could be the one
[19:05] and live before you and God said no I
[19:09] didn't do that you did that with your
[19:12] wife you create the ishmail in your
[19:17] life how many has got some ishmail in
[19:19] your life just five of us all right well
[19:23] we can dismiss the rest of you and have
[19:26] an altar call just for us I guess
[19:29] I said how many has ishmail in your life
[19:33] decisions you made you didn't pray
[19:34] enough about it you got yourself in a
[19:36] mess and It produced an ishmail Sarah
[19:40] said Abraham why don't you to take maybe
[19:42] God meant to take Hagar and it was not
[19:45] God's will it wasn't the promised son
[19:47] God gave him blessings anyway God got
[19:49] him out of that and that's what I pray
[19:51] Lord I said I this is Lord this is my
[19:53] ishmail and I don't expect you to do
[19:56] anything but I just said humbly I said I
[19:57] did it you didn't do it somehow show me
[20:00] wisdom how to give out of get out of
[20:02] this took me about five years and God
[20:05] showed me bang bang bang he showed me
[20:06] how to get out I didn't deserve that cuz
[20:08] it was my ishmail but by the grace of
[20:10] God I'm out of all of it today you're in
[20:13] debt you're in things that seems
[20:14] impossible you go to your God even if
[20:17] you don't feel worthy say God I did this
[20:19] but Lord show me the way out and he'll
[20:21] get you out why because he's for your
[20:23] freedom somebody say praise the Lord
[20:26] he's for you being free he doesn't want
[20:29] you under that bondage so there's things
[20:32] that we get into so there's Financial
[20:33] bondage and then there's emotional
[20:35] bondage which I had wish I had more time
[20:37] for because that's when somebody is just
[20:39] all locked up in their emotions with
[20:43] either bitterness or fear or past abuse
[20:47] or some trauma that they've been through
[20:49] they're emotionally all locked up and
[20:52] can't be free to worship and to just
[20:55] serve God uh in in in Joy they can't
[20:58] find the Joy maybe they come from a past
[21:00] legalistic teaching or atmosphere and
[21:03] they're emotionally bound up they can't
[21:06] fully be the full potential of who they
[21:08] should be as a daughter of God cuz they
[21:11] stand and they or they sit and they're
[21:13] restrained because they got all that
[21:15] baggage of emotional from the past
[21:17] hanging right there I want to tell you
[21:18] my brother and sister God doesn't want
[21:20] you to stay that way as a human being
[21:23] there's a place to bring that and
[21:24] release it and give it back to him can
[21:26] you say Amen that you can be more free
[21:29] than what you're sitting here this
[21:30] morning there's a place to bring it it's
[21:33] emotional bondage locked up with
[21:36] bitterness or fear past abuse I can help
[21:39] you as a pastor if you come and talk
[21:40] we'll we'll pray together I can help you
[21:42] through that you're not the first person
[21:45] that's had
[21:46] that is everybody with me this
[21:49] morning I can help your family I can
[21:52] help you that's why God's put me here
[21:54] it'll mostly be preaching these type of
[21:56] things and preaching the word to you
[21:57] that'll bring Deliverance to you but if
[21:59] you've got confidence in me I can show
[22:01] you some things and help you out of it
[22:03] by the grace of God all I'm saying is
[22:05] that whether it's me or whatever it is
[22:07] don't live that way your whole life
[22:09] don't live under that bondage don't be
[22:11] locked up with your spirit bound and
[22:14] your pretending and acting and smiling
[22:16] but it's not a real smile somebody give
[22:18] me an amen this morning how many pretend
[22:20] Smiles do we have in the Church of God
[22:22] sometimes your smile and your joy does
[22:25] not have to be put on and fake to
[22:27] everybody else it can be from the depths
[22:29] of your heart I'm happy this morning to
[22:31] be a believer in Jesus Christ and my
[22:34] spirit has been freed up nobody controls
[22:36] me nobody's going to try to control me
[22:38] no I've given it to God I've been abused
[22:42] but I've given it back to God I've had a
[22:45] hard life I had a daddy that didn't love
[22:47] me I had a mom that didn't love me right
[22:48] I had dysfunction in the
[22:51] family I come from since a dysfunctional
[22:54] family and they live years and all this
[22:56] happened I was abused by an uncle and
[22:57] all that that's fine I have a care for
[22:59] that but don't stay
[23:02] there there there's a future and if you
[23:04] live in the past you can't get to your
[23:06] future you got to forget those things
[23:08] it's under the blood forgive them so you
[23:10] can go forward and be free in your
[23:15] spirit dysfunctional family guess what
[23:19] all of you come from a dysfunctional
[23:20] family Adam and
[23:23] Eve oh you don't know what it is brother
[23:26] you had a perfect family come talk to
[23:29] me we don't have a perfect family my
[23:33] children aren't perfect and I'm not
[23:35] perfect we we have the same battle as
[23:37] everyone every week but the truth is
[23:39] every one of us the very best of us
[23:41] those who have Halos over their head
[23:43] this morning you come from a
[23:45] dysfunctional family you come from a
[23:48] dysfunctional birth that's right and
[23:50] some have more baggage than other but
[23:52] you were born wrong before you took
[23:54] drugs before you committed adultery
[23:56] before you did wrong before you stole
[23:58] sold Twinkies from the twinkie truck
[24:01] some boys in in the neighborhood those
[24:04] boys were
[24:07] bad and I got influenced by him and one
[24:10] day we were out in the woods and we were
[24:12] just going and said that truck comes by
[24:14] there every day and goes behind that
[24:16] shopping center we lived in an apartment
[24:17] building in Lima and they come around
[24:19] that shopping center and every day they
[24:21] said did you notice it comes the same
[24:23] time it's big old Twinkie truck and so
[24:25] they said we he's going inside we can go
[24:27] over there and get a whole big stash and
[24:29] put it out here in the woods in our
[24:32] Fort now if I didn't have a weakness
[24:35] like I
[24:37] have for
[24:39] Hostess it wouldn't have been a
[24:41] Temptation be but Ryan because Twinkies
[24:44] were involved it was a huge
[24:48] Temptation we went and did it the next
[24:50] day we went and did it and I you know I
[24:52] was scared half to death but the
[24:54] Twinkies kept me
[24:56] going we brought a whole box and boxes
[24:59] of Twinkies back in those woods and we
[25:01] spent a few days and then it got
[25:03] reported in the neighborhood Mom I don't
[25:06] know if you remember but then I felt so
[25:08] condemned I confessed to my mom and dad
[25:10] I confessed to everybody but you know we
[25:13] all have baggage you
[25:15] know and no it's not my worst
[25:20] sin back then it was pretty bad but you
[25:23] know what we all come from a
[25:25] dysfunctional family we all are born
[25:29] wrong we're all born
[25:34] losers and the quicker all of you
[25:36] remember that the quicker you can come
[25:38] to a Saving Grace of Jesus Christ it's
[25:41] not about you it's about his grace and
[25:43] he can
[25:45] take
[25:47] ashes and make Beauty out of them and so
[25:50] we're all have the same we have a lot of
[25:52] emotional baggage and then addictions we
[25:54] have today more than any other age one
[25:57] writer says there's much that promises
[25:59] Freedom that in actuality brings bondage
[26:01] he's talking about addictions there's
[26:03] much that that promises Freedom that
[26:06] actually brings bondage it merely
[26:07] transfers it into a different form
[26:10] rather than conquers the dependency at
[26:12] its core in all of its forms addiction
[26:15] is ultimately bondage to yourself your
[26:18] flesh your Cravings addiction is a form
[26:21] of slavery in which millions are bound
[26:24] and you're bound by a lack of faith in
[26:26] yourself and who you are in Christ and
[26:28] so you're bound by rejection when you're
[26:31] rejected maybe you were rejected earlier
[26:33] in your life and so you have rejection
[26:35] things going on and so when maybe a
[26:38] brother or sister doesn't look at you
[26:39] right that rejection comes up again you
[26:41] feel rejected and you're bound by the
[26:44] lack of faith in yourself and who you
[26:46] are and you you you crumble you you
[26:49] crash and you're bound by the lack of
[26:52] faith in yourself your complexes are
[26:54] greater than the grace of God you've
[26:56] never been accepted right you want to be
[26:58] accepted by everybody when you know and
[27:01] you've got such complexes you think
[27:03] people are talking about you more than
[27:06] what they really are like the guy who
[27:08] says I spent the first 30 years of my
[27:10] life uh worried about what people were
[27:13] speaking about me and saying about me
[27:15] and then the next 30 years of my life I
[27:18] spent not really caring what people were
[27:20] saying about me and then when that was
[27:22] over I realized nobody was really
[27:24] talking about me or thinking about me so
[27:26] it was a waste of time God God wants us
[27:30] to overcome our
[27:34] complexes our fears our
[27:37] rejections daddy rejected you mommy
[27:39] rejected you Daddy never accepted you
[27:42] mommy never accepted you the family
[27:44] never had accept you you were the black
[27:46] sheep of the family and God's washed You
[27:49] by his blood and the black sheep becomes
[27:51] the white sheep so stop buying into that
[27:54] rejection that someone called you the
[27:55] black sheep you are no longer the black
[27:57] sheep you're the a sheep of God can you
[28:00] say Amen the future is different now and
[28:02] you have to look at what God has made
[28:04] you and what he is making you instead of
[28:07] the past thank you for watching our
