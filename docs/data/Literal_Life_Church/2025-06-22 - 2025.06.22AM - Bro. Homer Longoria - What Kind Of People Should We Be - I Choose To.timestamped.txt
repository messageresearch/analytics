[20:35] here. Set up the piano, a few things.
[20:38] But let's sing this song tonight or this
[20:41] wow this morning.
[20:43] I'm still just uh overwhelmed by last
[20:46] night, brother Dicks. I guess I'm still
[20:47] there.
[20:49] But uh we'll sing this song. Uh why
[20:52] should I worry?
[20:54] Why should I worry?
[20:58] Why should I fear
[21:01] when the very same Jesus
[21:05] stays always near?
[21:09] He lives in my heart
[21:12] and he hears when I cry.
[21:16] I'll call on his name till the storm
[21:21] passes by. Why should and why should I
[21:26] worry?
[21:28] Why should I fear
[21:31] when the very same Jesus
[21:35] stays always near? He lives in my heart
[21:42] and he hears when I cry.
[21:46] I call on his name till the storm passes
[21:52] by. First verse.
[21:54] Out on the water,
[21:58] the storms raging high.
[22:02] The waters around them were troubled
[22:07] that night.
[22:10] Fear filled their hearts
[22:13] and they thought they would die.
[22:17] They failed to remember
[22:21] that the master was alive.
[22:25] And he spoke the word
[22:29] and the winds all stood still.
[22:33] And even the waters
[22:37] they oy his will
[22:44] just like he will mind
[22:48] if I'll just remember
[22:52] that he lives deep inside.
[22:56] So why should I worry?
[23:00] Why should I fear?
[23:04] with the very
[23:09] [Music]
[23:13] my heart and he hears when I cry.
[23:20] I'll call on his name to the store.
[23:24] Let's sing the second verse. Oh yes.
[23:26] Hallelujah.
[23:28] We read in the Bible
[23:31] how he walked within
[23:35] brought light to the darkness
[23:39] when the way grew so dim.
[23:43] How great it would be to have his steps
[23:48] fleeting mine
[23:51] and to walk with the master
[23:55] all of the time.
[23:58] So when trials come
[24:03] and death is so nice,
[24:07] I just search for the master.
[24:11] He said, "We'll be on time."
[24:15] And when I'm in trouble
[24:18] and my body's in pain, hallelujah, all I
[24:24] have to do is just call on his name. So
[24:29] why why should I worry?
[24:34] Oh, why should I fear
[24:38] when the very same Jesus
[24:43] stays always
[24:47] in my heart
[24:50] and he hears when I cry.
[24:54] Oh, I call on his name
[24:57] to the store last time. Oh, why should
[25:01] I? Why should I worry?
[25:06] Oh, why should I fear
[25:10] when the very same Jesus
[25:14] he stays al so
[25:18] he lives in my heart
[25:22] and he hears when I cry
[25:26] I'll call his name till the storm passes
[25:34] [Music]
[25:36] Hallelujah.
[25:38] Thank you.
[25:39] [Music]
[25:41] [Applause]
[26:14] [Music]
[26:26] When my heart is broken,
[26:29] when my life is empty, I can't see your
[26:33] face. I can't hear your voice.
[26:38] When I'm feeling helpless,
[26:41] wandering in the darkness, surrounded by
[26:44] fear and defeat,
[26:49] I have a choice to make.
[26:54] No matter what comes my way,
[26:59] I choose to worship.
[27:02] I choose to praise.
[27:05] I choose to lift up the name above all
[27:09] names. I choose to surrender. I choose
[27:14] to believe
[27:16] for all that you've done and for all you
[27:20] will be.
[27:22] I choose to worship you.
[27:28] [Music]
[27:35] Even in the fire,
[27:38] even in the valley, I can have joy and I
[27:44] can have peace.
[27:47] You are always with me.
[27:50] Never will forsake me. Your presence is
[27:54] all that I need.
[27:58] And I have a choice to make.
[28:03] With all that I am, I proclaim.
[28:08] I choose to worship. I choose to praise.
[28:14] I choose to lift up the name above all
[28:18] names. I choose to surrender. I choose
[28:22] to believe
[28:25] for all that you've done and for all you
[28:28] will be.
[28:30] I choose to worship.
[28:35] Oh, we are
[28:38] on every side.
[28:40] Raising our weapon. We will win this
[28:44] fight.
[28:46] We made our choice.
[28:49] We lift our voice. Let the church rise
[28:53] up this day.
[28:56] We will say
[28:58] we choose to worship. We choose to
[29:03] raise. We choose to lift up the name
[29:07] above all. We choose to surrender.
[29:13] Choose to believe
[29:15] for all that you've done and for all you
[29:19] will be.
[29:21] We choose to worship.
[29:24] [Music]
[29:27] We choose to worship.
[29:30] We choose to praise.
[29:32] We choose to lift up the name above all
[29:37] names. We choose to surrender. We choose
[29:41] to be
[29:43] for all that you've done and for all you
[29:47] will be.
[29:54] [Music]
[30:06] [Music]
[30:09] [Applause]
[30:09] [Music]
[30:12] We choose to worship. We choose to
[30:16] praise.
[30:18] We choose to lift up the name above all
[30:22] things. We choose to surrender.
[30:27] to believe
[30:29] that you
[30:31] [Music]
[30:33] will.
[30:35] We choose to worship.
[30:40] We choose to worship. We choose to
[30:44] praise.
[30:46] We choose to lift up the name above all
[30:50] name. We choose to surrender. Heat.
[30:58] Heat.
[31:00] [Music]
[31:08] Heat. Heat.
[31:15] [Music]
[31:21] [Music]
[31:26] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Let's give
[31:29] our Lord praise one more time. We choose
[31:31] to worship. Praise the Lord.
[31:35] Hallelujah.
[31:38] Thank you choir for blessing. Yes. Bring
[31:40] us into the presence of the Lord this
[31:42] morning. And we appreciate all the
[31:44] visitors that are here to join with us.
[31:46] I think the world has a phrase,
[31:48] happiness is a choice. Well, it's a
[31:50] truth. But all the things in God are
[31:52] already ours. We just have to choose.
[31:55] And in the midst of our trials, we need
[31:57] to tell the enemy, we choose to worship.
[31:59] We're not going to gripe and complain.
[32:02] Can you say amen? I know none of you
[32:04] ever do that. But we're not going to
[32:05] gripe and complain. We're not going to
[32:07] choose any other thing. We're going to
[32:09] choose to worship. And God loves to hear
[32:12] the voices of his children in their
[32:14] worst times reach up and say, "I'm going
[32:16] to worship anyway. I'm going to choose
[32:18] to worship because he's worthy." Praise
[32:21] be to God. God bless you all today. Feel
[32:23] such a kindred spirit with you. I know
[32:25] that you're going to enjoy the word
[32:27] today. It's just a privilege to be able
[32:29] to be in this fellowship around these
[32:32] last closing seconds of time. And I do
[32:35] believe that we're in the last roundup,
[32:37] the last part. And uh any believer
[32:40] senses that in his soul, we know that
[32:42] we're uh just very very close. And so
[32:45] want to wish those this morning who have
[32:47] a birthday. I know yesterday, Brother
[32:49] Mike, happy birthday to you. And I think
[32:51] they put that up. God bless you each one
[32:54] have birthdays, anniversaries this week.
[32:56] God bless you. And then also just wanted
[32:58] you to remember coming up next month, we
[33:01] have a men's fellowship brunch that
[33:03] we're inviting all the men to and uh
[33:05] we'll get you a good breakfast and some
[33:07] good teaching. Brother Aaron McGaryi is
[33:08] going to be here and that'd be I think
[33:10] the third uh Saturday of July and uh so
[33:14] he's going to do a couple sessions of
[33:16] teaching godly manhood and then he'll be
[33:19] speaking for us Sunday morning and then
[33:20] Sunday night for the tri-state youth
[33:22] meeting. We're looking forward to this
[33:23] is kind of a new group that we formed on
[33:25] a telegram with our our church men here,
[33:28] the men of truth we called it. So we've
[33:30] been having some good fellowship and
[33:31] good sharing prayer requests and
[33:33] different things. the the sisters had
[33:35] one for years here and we kind of felt
[33:37] left out so we formed our own men only
[33:42] girls are not allowed uh men's
[33:44] fellowship on the telegram and we really
[33:46] enjoy that so we want to have a day we
[33:48] get together and have a good breakfast
[33:50] Bob Evans or whatever it is here at the
[33:52] church and we'll we'll enjoy that day of
[33:54] fellowship in the weekend of services so
[33:56] we want to announce that to you as well
[33:58] any other birthdays or anniversaries God
[34:00] bless you brother Mark it's good to have
[34:02] you and your wife in from upper Michigan
[34:04] there. God bless you. It's a privilege
[34:05] to have you here today. God bless you
[34:07] and all the visitors that are in town
[34:09] for the meetings. God bless you. Last
[34:11] night was a wonderful and I thought it
[34:13] ironic and we're going to bring our
[34:15] brother Homer up real soon to minister
[34:17] the word and uh I thought it ironic last
[34:21] night that we we took some our country
[34:23] took some direct hits to the enemy's
[34:27] worst weapons.
[34:29] And I can tell you if you were in the
[34:31] service last night, if you're in the
[34:33] service this morning, that's what
[34:35] happened last night while that was going
[34:36] on naturally. I like when the Lord takes
[34:39] a direct hit
[34:41] to the worst part of the enemy
[34:43] destroying you in your life. How many
[34:45] would raise your hand and say, "Let the
[34:46] Lord take a direct hit to the enemy's
[34:49] camp this morning." And the word can do
[34:51] that. He knows where just to hit to go
[34:53] to the source. Not just surface things,
[34:55] but to go with a direct hit and go right
[34:58] to the weapons that are formed against
[35:00] us. And the Bible says, "No weapon
[35:02] formed against us shall prosper."
[35:06] No weapon shall prosper because God's
[35:09] going to be preemptive. God's going to,
[35:11] if you'll yield your life to him, he's
[35:12] going to have a preemptive strike and he
[35:14] can come against the enemy before he's
[35:16] ready to strike back. So, we're looking
[35:18] forward to that. Today, you we have a
[35:20] friend, brother Homer Loria. He was here
[35:23] six years ago after my father passed
[35:25] away. He helped us with the memorial and
[35:28] also just uh ministered Sunday morning.
[35:30] I don't know if you remember him. Some
[35:32] of you were here, some of you weren't.
[35:34] And uh so he was his ministry that
[35:36] Sunday morning was a great uh ministered
[35:39] to our family in our church a lot after
[35:41] losing dad. And uh it was a wonderful
[35:43] service. He had just lost his wife about
[35:46] three years before that. So he was in
[35:48] still in the grieving a bit with that.
[35:50] but he was a great encouragement to us
[35:52] having that huge loss for our church and
[35:54] our family. So, I appreciate him so
[35:56] much. It's been way overdue for him to
[35:58] come back. And he's a country boy.
[36:00] You're going to notice that right from
[36:02] the start. The He's as country as
[36:04] cornbread. He's country boy from
[36:07] Alabama. But don't underestimate what
[36:10] this man has in wisdom. 53 years
[36:13] preaching this message. I say thank God
[36:16] for that. Faithful preaching this
[36:18] message.
[36:19] [Music]
[36:21] And I know I know the Lord will has a
[36:25] blessing for you today. Don't
[36:26] underestimate all the wisdom that our
[36:28] brother has and just what the Lord would
[36:30] have him. We want him to take his time.
[36:32] We've given most the time to him. We
[36:34] want him to come and minister the word.
[36:35] If you'd stand, let's sing that. No
[36:37] weapon formed against me shall prosper.
[36:40] What the scripture says. Let's sing
[36:41] that. How many believe it this morning?
[36:44] May the Holy Spirit take a direct hit to
[36:46] the enemy. If there's anything there
[36:48] that the enemy is hiding, may he just
[36:51] bring bring us victory through the word
[36:52] this morning. And uh we believe that
[36:55] we're in the right place at the right
[36:56] time. No weapon,
[37:00] formed
[37:01] against me,
[37:04] shall prosper.
[37:07] No, it won't work. No weapon.
[37:13] Oh
[37:16] shall prosper.
[37:19] Oh, it won't work.
[37:23] God will do. He said he will do. He will
[37:29] stand by his word.
[37:32] He will come through. I know God will do
[37:37] what he said he will do. He will stand
[37:42] by his word.
[37:45] He will come through. No weapon. Amen.
[37:49] Formed against me
[37:53] shall prosper.
[37:55] No, we won't work. No weapon
[38:01] formed against me
[38:04] shall prosper.
[38:08] It won't work.
[38:12] I won't be afraid.
[38:14] Sing it. Oh, sing it, Kitty. Won't be
[38:18] afraid.
[38:21] I should learn these songs sometime.
[38:23] Praise the Lord. One more course. No
[38:26] weapon
[38:28] formed against me.
[38:33] [Music]
[38:40] Weapons
[38:42] against you shall prosper.
[38:48] It won't work.
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] Praise the Lord.
[38:59] [Music]
[39:02] Can you just say, "Praise the Lord."
[39:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Good to be here.
[39:08] Amen. When you 83 years old, good to be
[39:10] anywhere.
[39:14] Praise the Lord. I told Brother Diggs,
[39:16] he's jumping around up here. Hey, I'm
[39:18] not going to sing. That's one thing I am
[39:20] not going to sing. You know, I told
[39:23] Brother Diggs and them, I said, "If I
[39:25] jump around like you and run and
[39:27] something's after me."
[39:32] Amen. Amen. Well, it's good to be in the
[39:34] house of the Lord. Amen. Good to be with
[39:37] brother Paul. Amen. And good to see you,
[39:42] Sister Lefon. Amen. Uh just so good that
[39:46] God is so good.
[39:48] Can you say amen? Amen. Well, Brother
[39:51] Diggs done it last night. And so I told
[39:54] Jonathan last night on the way home, I
[39:56] said, "You know, he about preached on
[39:58] what I was going to preach on, so I'm
[39:59] going to preach on it because y'all
[40:00] don't know what he said.
[40:04] It takes about two times to hear it."
[40:05] You know,
[40:09] amen. Amen. So, so good. Amen.
[40:14] Hear the man of God. And I thought when
[40:16] he was talking about, you know, you
[40:18] know, about uh the pool of Bethesda and
[40:21] I said, you know, one thing about it is
[40:24] he couldn't get to the pool, but the
[40:25] pool came to him.
[40:28] Amen. The pool came to him. Amen. And
[40:31] that makes a lot of difference. Amen.
[40:33] When the pool comes to you. That's what
[40:36] I said about the woman at the well. She
[40:38] didn't come to Jesus. Jesus come to her.
[40:41] Amen. Jesus came to her. Amen. And so,
[40:45] uh, Amen. And I'm glad that Jesus come
[40:47] to me. Amen. Cuz, hey, I wasn't looking
[40:50] for him. Amen. But he came to me. Amen.
[40:53] If you Lord have mercy, I left my
[40:56] glasses. Where at? I don't know.
[41:00] Is that Walmart's?
[41:02] Okay. If it's Walmarts, I can handle it.
[41:05] It's Walmart.
[41:10] Why pay $300 for you get it $15 at
[41:14] Walmart.
[41:16] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother. My
[41:19] my Amen. And so, why don't you look with
[41:22] me if you would in Mark chapter 11.
[41:25] Amen. This morning, I want to talk to
[41:27] you. I like to take a thought this
[41:30] morning. What kind of people should we
[41:32] be?
[41:34] What kind of people should we be? Amen.
[41:37] And and so, Amen. I Man, I think about
[41:41] that so much, you know, and I think
[41:42] about, well, we talk about the message,
[41:44] we talk about the Bible, we talk about
[41:46] scripture. Amen. But, Amen. When God
[41:49] reveals it,
[41:51] what kind of people should we be? Thank
[41:53] you, buddy. And give this man back. He
[41:55] can't see now.
[41:58] See, we got it together, everybody.
[42:00] Thank God I got more hair.
[42:04] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So anyhow,
[42:09] let's just look at that while you're
[42:10] standing. I won't keep you standing.
[42:12] Amen. Too long. Amen. And Luke uh excuse
[42:15] me, Mark chapter Mark chapter 11. Let's
[42:18] read a few verses there if we could.
[42:20] Amen. Try not to I always say it like
[42:23] this. Amen. You pull, I preach. You
[42:26] don't pull, I'm going to preach, and we
[42:27] going to go home tired.
[42:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Verse 22. The Bible
[42:33] said, "And Jesus said unto them, have
[42:37] faith in God." Now your margin reader
[42:39] says, "Have the faith of God." Okay? For
[42:44] for verily I say unto you, that
[42:47] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[42:50] be thy removed, right? and be thou
[42:53] casted into the sea, and shall not doubt
[42:57] in his heart, but shall believe that in
[43:01] those things which he said shall shall
[43:05] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[43:08] he saith. Right now, he he's putting it
[43:12] all right there. Amen. Is you as a
[43:15] believer. That's right. Amen. Now, I'm
[43:17] going to take a step before and I'm
[43:18] going to choke you right off. Now, I
[43:21] want to say it like this. We going to
[43:23] leave God out of the picture this
[43:24] morning.
[43:26] Go ahead. Go ahead and grasp
[43:31] because brother Brandham said he's done
[43:33] done everything he can do.
[43:36] He's done done everything. So, he steps
[43:39] back. Now, he puts it in your hands.
[43:42] Brother Bandham says it like this. He
[43:44] said if he was here with this suit on,
[43:47] he could do no more than what he's
[43:50] already done because he's already
[43:52] finished the work.
[43:54] So it all lays in our hands now.
[43:58] Is that all right? Amen. Amen. So the
[44:01] scripture says, Amen. So what? Amen.
[44:04] Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever,
[44:09] excuse me, whatsoever you desire when
[44:12] you pray, believe that you receive them
[44:15] and you shall have them.
[44:18] Now, he said, "Whatsoever things you
[44:20] desire," and the emphatic dialogue says
[44:23] it like this, "Whatsoever things you
[44:24] wish,
[44:27] whatsoever things you wish."
[44:30] Amen. And you remember mo most all you
[44:32] young people back in my day we had a
[44:34] seared robot catalog and it we called it
[44:37] a wish book. That's right. We couldn't
[44:40] buy nothing but we just wish. That's
[44:43] right. Right. Amen. And all of a sudden
[44:45] we hit it and we got it because we wish
[44:48] for it. Can you say amen? So he says
[44:51] whatsoever things you wish or whatsoever
[44:53] things Amen. And I said it like this. He
[44:57] said whatsoever things that don't mean
[45:00] all spiritual. You may need a washing
[45:02] machine.
[45:07] Praise the Lord. You may need, hey, a
[45:10] car. So whatsoever things
[45:15] you have need of
[45:17] when you pray, don't ask him, Lord, you
[45:19] know what I need, tell him. Yeah.
[45:22] Just cuz he said whatsoever things
[45:26] you have need of when you pray.
[45:28] Amen. You'll have them.
[45:31] We learned that in a charismatic move.
[45:36] Oh, praise the Lord. I told you told you
[45:39] no, you ought not do this, but you did.
[45:43] Amen. So, he says,
[45:45] "Therefore, I say unto you, what's Amen.
[45:49] When you pray,
[45:51] believe us. Right? So whatever you
[45:54] desire, Amen. When you pray, look for
[45:58] it.
[46:00] Believe it.
[46:02] Or don't pray.
[46:07] Father, bless your word as they seated
[46:08] in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated.
[46:12] Are you happy? Amen. Amen. Hold that
[46:15] smile till we get through.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:21] I love God. He loves me.
[46:25] Amen. Because he Amen. was the one that
[46:28] done this before the world was.
[46:31] Amen. So I like to I like to take that
[46:33] maybe just for a little while. Amen. And
[46:36] Amen. I'd like to look at that.
[46:38] Whatsoever Amen. What kind of people
[46:40] should we be with everything that we
[46:43] have in this hour? Yes, sir. Amen. that
[46:45] God has already done.
[46:48] Just say amen. Well, Amen. Let's just
[46:51] look at it then. Brother man says it
[46:53] like this. Amen. I Oh, I I I'm Let me
[46:56] tell you this. I believe that God sent a
[46:58] prophet,
[46:59] but I believe Amen. that God sent a word
[47:03] with a prophet. Somebody told me said,
[47:05] "You know, you know, well, we check this
[47:08] message." Amen. Amen. We check the
[47:11] scripture by this message. I said, "No,
[47:12] you can't. You got to check." Amen. You
[47:14] check the Bible by this message. Take
[47:17] the Bible. You said, "I don't believe
[47:18] that. I don't I don't care whether you
[47:19] do or not." Amen. I said, "Because if
[47:23] you just had the Bible," Amen. When I
[47:25] was in the Baptist church, we had the
[47:26] Bible. Right. Then I was in United
[47:30] Pentecost. We had the Bible.
[47:33] I was with the Ostein move. We had the
[47:35] Bible.
[47:37] You ever heard that song? I've been
[47:39] everywhere, boy. Yeah.
[47:42] And then I got saved.
[47:45] You say, "Amen." Amen. But we I said,
[47:47] "Look," I said, "Every one of those men
[47:49] when Brother Bannon was preaching, they
[47:52] had the Bible.
[47:54] They differed with him." Amen. On the
[47:57] Bible, amen, on the scripture of his
[47:59] revelation.
[48:01] But therefore, amen, they in order to be
[48:03] who they were, they took this message,
[48:06] amen, back to the Bible. And that Bible
[48:09] proved this message. And the message
[48:11] proved the Bible.
[48:16] Can you say amen?
[48:18] Amen. That's the reason, Amen. That's
[48:19] the reason we listen to the message all
[48:21] the time because we do not understand.
[48:25] Amen. What it's talking about unless the
[48:28] revelation, amen, that God has done in
[48:31] this hour presented to us through the
[48:33] word. That's the reason John could come
[48:36] out boldly and said, "I'm the voice of
[48:39] one crying in the wilderness." Amen.
[48:42] That's the reason brother Brandham said,
[48:43] "Amen. I am God's voice to the people."
[48:47] So, you cannot bypass William Brandom to
[48:50] get to the scripture because he said,
[48:52] "I'm the voice of God to the people."
[48:55] And brother Brandham says it like this.
[48:57] He said, "I feel like somebody resented
[48:59] that." He said, "So now I'm going to say
[49:01] it under inspiration. I am God's voice.
[49:08] You realize Jesus was just a voice of
[49:10] God.
[49:12] You say amen. Amen. Amen. Jesus was a
[49:15] voice of God. Did you ever realize Amen.
[49:19] Amen. When God Amen. adopted his son,
[49:22] remember the prophet of God says, Amen.
[49:24] when it come up on Mount
[49:26] Transfiguration, Amen. He said, now this
[49:28] is my son. Hear you him whom I please to
[49:31] dwell. Amen. And brother Brandham says
[49:33] it like this. Through the church ages,
[49:35] he was God. But then God steps back and
[49:38] he said, "Now hear you him."
[49:42] That's good.
[49:44] Amen.
[49:46] Amen. And so for the last 50 something
[49:49] years, I've been preaching this. Amen.
[49:52] And so I believe this. Can you say amen?
[49:55] Amen. So the prophet of God says, "What
[49:58] kind of people should we be if the very
[50:01] Holy Spirit has so embodied or empowered
[50:06] us?" Amen. That we don't use our own
[50:09] thoughts.
[50:12] Hello.
[50:15] We don't use our own thoughts.
[50:18] Amen. We're talking about a spiritual
[50:20] application. Yes. Amen. Now your
[50:24] thought, your thought is what bothers
[50:26] the spiritual thought.
[50:29] I don't have to have you to get in
[50:30] trouble. My own mind does that. That's
[50:33] right. Amen. My own mind does that. See,
[50:37] that's the reason Paul said, Amen. In
[50:40] the scripture, he said, "Let this mind
[50:42] that was also in Jesus or in Christ be
[50:46] in you." Right? Amen. So when the Bible
[50:50] was telling me back in Isaiah, he said
[50:54] his thoughts is above our thoughts. His
[50:56] ways is above our ways until Jesus came
[50:59] and sent back the Holy Ghost. Then our
[51:02] thoughts become his thoughts. That's
[51:05] good. Amen. That's right. Our thoughts
[51:08] become his thoughts. Our ways become his
[51:11] ways.
[51:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. So the thing about
[51:15] this Amen. It's like I was reading this
[51:17] morning and I was thinking I said when
[51:19] Elisha kept following Elijah. Amen. And
[51:23] when he he he expounded the the robe
[51:26] back. Amen. He didn't go back up there
[51:29] shouting but he had received the robe.
[51:32] Amen. And when he went back the robe a
[51:34] type of the word. Amen. He spoke. Amen.
[51:38] With the word or with the mana and the
[51:41] Amen. And the waters parted. Amen. Amen.
[51:44] And that's the reason when Jesus said,
[51:46] "I go away, but I send back a mantel. I
[51:50] send back the Holy Ghost." Amen. And
[51:52] whatsoever you say when you believe,
[51:55] Amen. you'll have it.
[52:00] Is that all right? Amen. So he says,
[52:04] "Amen. We're not here occupying
[52:07] a a a time to get you to come to church.
[52:11] You come because the word put you there.
[52:17] Amen. If I Hey, if I could talk to you,
[52:19] Amen. 24/7, you'll come until it wears
[52:23] off of you. But if it's a revelation of
[52:26] God, Amen. then it puts you in church.
[52:33] Amen. I said it like this. I don't like
[52:36] to go to church.
[52:42] A lot of y'all don't either probably,
[52:45] but God likes to go to church.
[52:48] Brother Benham said, "If God's in you,
[52:50] in your heart, he goes to church."
[52:54] So if he goes, he'll take my body.
[53:02] So actually, you're not going to church.
[53:05] He's assembling himself together.
[53:12] Is that all right? See, amen. We think,
[53:15] "Oh, we doing something. We We showed up
[53:17] this morning." You didn't surprise God.
[53:22] You You either come by the spirit of God
[53:24] or you come by the devil.
[53:30] If you're not a real believer, the devil
[53:32] let you come.
[53:35] Well, I
[53:38] you don't have to give me no offering.
[53:43] You don't even have to pay me.
[53:46] I'll call home and they'll get me home.
[53:51] Praise the Lord.
[53:53] You love him.
[53:55] Brother says it like this. He said, "If
[53:59] the very Holy Spirit is so in enshrouded
[54:04] us, Amen. It so got us." Amen.
[54:07] Enshrouded you by his power, you're not
[54:11] doing this.
[54:14] You're the vessel that he sent to the
[54:16] earth.
[54:18] Right. See, when he Amen. When he made
[54:21] it up, Amen. before the world was Amen.
[54:24] I don't I don't have a problem about
[54:25] coming. I don't have a problem about
[54:28] going in the rapture
[54:30] because Amen. we've already raptured.
[54:34] We're just waiting for the catching
[54:35] away.
[54:39] Right. And I said, so the thing about
[54:42] this, I said, when I was in the world,
[54:45] it never did upset God none.
[54:50] He didn't like it, but it never upset
[54:53] him none.
[54:54] because he, you know what he done? He
[54:57] was over here watching
[54:59] that on April the 20th, 1942.
[55:02] He said, "I already got somebody
[55:04] coming."
[55:06] Y'all going to call him Homer, but I
[55:08] call him son.
[55:12] Praise the Lord.
[55:14] See, the thing about this, we never
[55:16] surprise God. That's right. Amen. God's
[55:19] got it figured.
[55:21] Oh, we holler. Amen. God put his name on
[55:23] the book. our book before the foundation
[55:25] of the world. He did that. Amen. And
[55:28] then he allowed you to accept him.
[55:33] And I told the church, I said, "You know
[55:35] what? Amen. What we've had in this hour,
[55:40] Amen. We've had mercy." Amen. Turned
[55:43] into judgment.
[55:47] Mercy. The young ruler come to God.
[55:52] Mercy. Judgment is when he turned it
[55:55] down.
[55:58] No, I don't never believe he'd have been
[55:59] bride, but I believe he could have got
[56:01] saved.
[56:07] Praise the Lord.
[56:09] Amen. Amen. Amen. Everybody look up your
[56:12] way and smile. I Hey, I can't see. You
[56:15] know how I'm so blinded I can't see.
[56:21] I don't know how Paul does this.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:26] Watch what he says.
[56:29] Amen. He said, "Look,"
[56:31] he said, "you don't use your own mind.
[56:35] You don't use your own opinions."
[56:40] Everybody's got them. Come on now.
[56:43] Everybody's got an opinion.
[56:46] Most of you has already figured it on
[56:47] me.
[56:50] I've never hurt nobody.
[56:53] But you got an opinion.
[56:56] Brother Bandham says you don't use your
[56:59] own opinion.
[57:01] How can you not?
[57:04] The Holy Ghost has to Amen. direct your
[57:07] opinions.
[57:08] That's the reason, Amen. people said,
[57:10] "Well, that was Brother Ram's opinion."
[57:12] Amen. It was good because he was using
[57:16] now God's opinion.
[57:19] Yes. Amen.
[57:21] So he said, "You don't use your own."
[57:24] You said, "Well, I don't see it that
[57:27] way." I don't care.
[57:30] That don't bother me at least because
[57:32] that's what he said.
[57:35] And if you got a problem me, get on him.
[57:40] Because I I'm here because I love God. I
[57:43] love Paul. I love the church. I love
[57:46] God. But I tell you what, church. Amen.
[57:49] Amen. God sent me a letter.
[57:52] But he had to anoint me to receive that
[57:55] letter.
[57:57] He had to call me. Amen. To understand
[58:00] the letter.
[58:02] See, amen. When the Holy Ghost come, as
[58:05] Jesus came and opened their
[58:06] understanding on the road to Damascus,
[58:09] the Holy Ghost came and opened our
[58:11] understanding.
[58:13] Right? It opened our understanding. And
[58:16] that's the reason, Amen. the most
[58:18] children, young people, Amen, can find,
[58:22] Amen, the doctors of divinity.
[58:24] Why? For what they God will let them
[58:27] see.
[58:29] Amen. Can I go on a little further?
[58:32] Amen.
[58:33] I can't take too much time cuz I give
[58:35] out. Watch what he says.
[58:39] Amen. You're you're you're so built by
[58:42] the Holy Spirit until your thoughts is
[58:46] being God's thoughts.
[58:50] You're so built by the Holy Spirit.
[58:55] I I'm I'm I'm just going to preach to a
[58:57] a Holy Ghost church this morning.
[59:00] You say, "Well, I'm not really there."
[59:01] Well, you can be.
[59:04] Yes, sir. Amen. And you say, "Well, I
[59:07] you know, I'd like to see what you see."
[59:09] Don't see what I see. See what he sees.
[59:14] Amen. Look what he says. He said, "So,
[59:18] Amen." He said, "You don't use
[59:21] your so built until your thoughts are
[59:25] being your thoughts." Amen. He uses your
[59:30] thoughts. You being a being is God's
[59:33] spirit expressing itself through you.
[59:37] Amen. Brother B said, "What kind of
[59:40] church would we be? Should we be?
[59:45] What kind of church?" Amen. You know,
[59:47] you say, "Well, we gathered together."
[59:49] Amen. And we've had a prayer meeting. I
[59:51] believe in prayer. Amen. I believe in
[59:53] all of these things that, Amen. the
[59:55] spirit of God talks about. But let me
[59:57] tell you what, if you come together as
[59:59] believers, then you're not using your
[1:00:02] thought. The Holy Spirit is speaking
[1:00:04] through you.
[1:00:08] Paul cannot get up here and pastor
[1:00:10] church on his own thoughts.
[1:00:13] He has to move that aside
[1:00:16] and yield himself to the spirit of God.
[1:00:20] Can you say amen?
[1:00:22] See the thing about is Jesus said, "I
[1:00:26] can't do nothing
[1:00:28] except I see the father."
[1:00:33] Hallelujah.
[1:00:36] Brother man said, "What kind of people
[1:00:37] should we be this morning?"
[1:00:40] Amen. If the Brandham tabernacle this
[1:00:43] morning was so filled with the presence
[1:00:46] of God, Amen. Why? When you don't even
[1:00:51] use your own mind.
[1:01:02] If she was so filled with the spirit of
[1:01:05] God,
[1:01:07] Brandon Tabernacle, you wouldn't use
[1:01:10] your own mind.
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:16] Why?
[1:01:18] He said, "You don't even use your own
[1:01:21] thoughts."
[1:01:24] That's the reason I tell I I say it like
[1:01:26] this. Brother Brown said, "We need our
[1:01:29] brain baptized.
[1:01:33] We need our brain baptized,
[1:01:36] right?
[1:01:38] We need that something that we can stay
[1:01:41] in tune with.
[1:01:44] Let me tell you what church, you
[1:01:46] practice for good singing. You practice
[1:01:48] for all of this. But if that mind is
[1:01:50] there, it's not a practice. That's
[1:01:52] right. It's a procession.
[1:01:58] You know when when John 10 says, "My
[1:02:01] sheep know my voice.
[1:02:03] A stranger they won't follow."
[1:02:06] Right. Amen. What is it? They so learn
[1:02:09] that voice
[1:02:11] until Amen. No matter what they lack
[1:02:15] will not attract them against the
[1:02:18] follower of the shepherd. Yes, sir.
[1:02:22] Amen. Even what they lack, all the
[1:02:24] vegetables on the side of the road does
[1:02:27] not attract them from getting their eyes
[1:02:31] off of the shepherd.
[1:02:36] Amen.
[1:02:37] Amen. Now, you know I am an hour behind
[1:02:39] y'all.
[1:02:46] You say, "Well, I'd like to know what
[1:02:47] kind of thought I have." Well, you know
[1:02:50] what, brother Re says? Amen. We need a
[1:02:52] fresh baptism every day.
[1:02:58] We need a fresh baptism.
[1:03:00] Amen. Amen. And so what what are we
[1:03:03] trying to do is to bring this man under
[1:03:06] subjection,
[1:03:09] right?
[1:03:11] Amen.
[1:03:13] He says,
[1:03:16] "Amen." Didn't even use You don't even
[1:03:19] use your own thoughts.
[1:03:22] Amen. Didn't have to. Amen. You didn't
[1:03:25] have to alternate.
[1:03:27] Amen. Of of all of this other You're
[1:03:30] just led by the spirit. Brother said
[1:03:33] last night, I preached a message at
[1:03:35] home, motivated by spirits.
[1:03:39] Amen. Every one of us has got a spirit.
[1:03:42] We're motivated by a good or bad spirit.
[1:03:45] That's right.
[1:03:47] You're motivated that. Amen. You're
[1:03:50] motivation
[1:03:54] at all. Yes, he does. He's just that the
[1:03:56] lazy spirit.
[1:04:03] That's the truth.
[1:04:05] Watch him. Amen. I got a grandson, great
[1:04:08] grandson. He lives with me, goes with
[1:04:12] me. I take him to school every day and
[1:04:14] pick him up. And so somebody when Margie
[1:04:17] died, she somebody get you a dog. I got
[1:04:19] me a boy.
[1:04:24] He tells me, "Papa,
[1:04:27] you'll be here when I graduate." He's
[1:04:29] 10.
[1:04:33] But you know what? He's so motivated by
[1:04:36] that phone.
[1:04:39] And he tells me, "Papo,
[1:04:41] you don't understand this.
[1:04:45] I mean, he's speaking my tongue. I don't
[1:04:47] understand that.
[1:04:50] I don't understand the maps or the woman
[1:04:53] telling us where to go.
[1:04:57] I don't understand that."
[1:05:01] I remember one time I was in Houston,
[1:05:03] Texas. She kept saying, "Regroup."
[1:05:06] And after a while, me and Margie, she
[1:05:08] regrouped so much. I said, "Shut up.
[1:05:12] Just shut up." And I got on the phone. I
[1:05:15] called the brother and I said, "Come get
[1:05:16] me."
[1:05:22] You don't regroup real easy in Houston,
[1:05:24] Texas. They got free freeways like this.
[1:05:29] So, I couldn't regroup.
[1:05:32] I needed another way out. Praise the
[1:05:35] Lord.
[1:05:37] Is that all right? I said, but he's
[1:05:39] motivated by that thing. Yeah. Amen.
[1:05:43] Amen. He's standing in a truck. He's in
[1:05:45] with me in my car or my truck. Amen. In
[1:05:48] school morning, he'll start saying,
[1:05:49] "Paul, you remember some of his foreign
[1:05:53] stuff? Eli Mos must." I didn't even know
[1:05:56] he existed.
[1:06:00] I didn't know Eli Musk existed.
[1:06:03] Papa, you just don't know, do you? Well,
[1:06:06] me and him was on the same basis now.
[1:06:08] You just don't know.
[1:06:11] That's why the church world just don't
[1:06:12] know. They don't know the visitation of
[1:06:15] God. They don't know that this word has
[1:06:18] come. When somebody said, "We don't
[1:06:20] understand that." They don't understand
[1:06:22] because they're not reading the same
[1:06:24] mail.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:28] Can you say amen? Yes. Amen.
[1:06:31] So he says, so now he says, as the
[1:06:37] scripture says, as many as the sons of
[1:06:39] God, Amen. are led.
[1:06:42] They're led by the spirit. Amen. Why are
[1:06:45] you going that way? I don't know.
[1:06:47] Remember, Amen. Amen. Those people,
[1:06:49] Amen, in the early years, Amen. They
[1:06:51] were they was moved. Brother Benhams in
[1:06:53] in the cafeteria. Amen. And this lady
[1:06:56] moved by the spirit to go. Amen. And
[1:07:00] brother Benham come out of the door.
[1:07:02] Right. She's moved by spirit.
[1:07:06] Amen. Why? She's so Amen. in in in in t
[1:07:10] in in in fellowship with the spirit of
[1:07:12] God. He says, "Look, go stand at that
[1:07:15] door. He'll come out."
[1:07:18] Amen.
[1:07:20] She was motivated.
[1:07:22] Brother Benham didn't have a clue. He
[1:07:24] just come out the door.
[1:07:27] Amen.
[1:07:29] So watch what he says.
[1:07:31] What kind of people should we be? Amen.
[1:07:34] Amen. Amen. You ask that sheep, why are
[1:07:38] you going that way?
[1:07:40] Why are you following him? He has no
[1:07:43] idea. There's a nature about him.
[1:07:46] There's a nature about him that's
[1:07:48] following him.
[1:07:51] Amen. Why do you believe the message? I
[1:07:52] don't know. But there's a spirit about
[1:07:54] me that's following this word.
[1:07:59] You say amen.
[1:08:01] Can you say amen? See, the thing about
[1:08:04] it is Amen. No matter. Amen. Hey. Amen.
[1:08:09] If if there like brother Bam said, the
[1:08:11] Bible says a stranger that won't follow.
[1:08:14] I don't care if he's a message preacher.
[1:08:16] If it's strange word, you won't follow.
[1:08:22] Amen. Amen. Brother man says it like
[1:08:25] this. He said if the same spirit
[1:08:29] that said let there be light
[1:08:33] and there was light that said let there
[1:08:36] be trees there was trees. And if that
[1:08:40] same mind that was in Christ being you
[1:08:43] how much more you could say or it could
[1:08:46] say let there be no cancer.
[1:08:52] Thank you Lord. Let there be no cancer.
[1:08:56] See church as you are led by the spirit
[1:08:59] of God.
[1:09:02] Don't you realize that the children of
[1:09:04] Israel when they were amen on their
[1:09:06] journey they run out of water?
[1:09:10] But did you know that God already had
[1:09:12] the tree?
[1:09:16] God didn't plant the tree. He already
[1:09:18] had the tree and he know that there
[1:09:20] would be a time they needed the tree.
[1:09:24] Hallelujah.
[1:09:27] Hallelujah.
[1:09:29] See, Amen. God is always, that's the
[1:09:31] reason I told somebody the other day, I
[1:09:33] told my church, I said, "The Bible says
[1:09:35] he go prepare a place."
[1:09:39] And I said, "He went to prepare that
[1:09:40] place to my likening." Amen.
[1:09:46] Paul, if Amen. what you do, Amen. you
[1:09:50] prepare for Rebecca's liking.
[1:09:57] You say, "I tell you one thing, I don't
[1:09:59] do that." Well,
[1:10:02] God will probably knock you out.
[1:10:07] See, God knew exactly
[1:10:09] what I liked.
[1:10:14] That's the reason he said he had big
[1:10:15] mountains, little mountains, big people.
[1:10:20] Me
[1:10:22] little people.
[1:10:24] Amen. I got a place prepared for you.
[1:10:28] Amen. And when you preparing a place,
[1:10:30] Amen. And you got a bride, you you can
[1:10:32] shelter.
[1:10:38] It's all right.
[1:10:40] So God's got it already in Amen. in your
[1:10:44] likening.
[1:10:46] He knows your desire.
[1:10:48] Well, hey. Amen. God Hey, I want that
[1:10:51] picture window here.
[1:10:54] Hey, they they they didn't put it there.
[1:10:56] Tear it down.
[1:10:58] Remember what brother Re said when that
[1:11:01] guy built it contrary to the blueprint.
[1:11:04] The guy come over and he said, "You,
[1:11:06] hey, this ain't according to plans."
[1:11:09] Amen. He said, "Well, I just thought a
[1:11:10] window should go here." He said, "Tear
[1:11:12] it down."
[1:11:14] Cuz it ain't your thinking.
[1:11:18] Well, praise God.
[1:11:21] Amen.
[1:11:23] Amen. Tear it down because I I'm
[1:11:25] building that according to her likeness.
[1:11:29] Is that right? Amen. And you said, "Oh,
[1:11:32] but you know, I don't know. I don't know
[1:11:34] what I like." Yeah, you do. You know.
[1:11:38] Amen. Every one of us know of what our
[1:11:42] desire is.
[1:11:44] Can you say amen?
[1:11:46] We sing, "I want to know more about my
[1:11:50] my savior. I want to know more about my
[1:11:52] Lord." Well, why would you do that if
[1:11:54] there's not no more for you?
[1:11:59] I want to know more. about my Lord.
[1:12:03] Amen.
[1:12:05] Can I go on a few more minutes?
[1:12:08] They're sons of God. Now, you're the
[1:12:10] sons of God. Amen. Romans 8:14. Amen.
[1:12:14] And the sons of God are led by the
[1:12:16] spirit of God. And when the human
[1:12:19] element goes out,
[1:12:22] when the human element goes out,
[1:12:25] okay,
[1:12:27] when Amen. Brother man said, "And the
[1:12:29] spirit of God fills that vacancy."
[1:12:35] Feels that vacancy. Yes, it does.
[1:12:40] So, what was you thinking over here?
[1:12:43] Now, that's gone out and that vacancy
[1:12:47] has been filled because you're a son of
[1:12:50] God with the spirit of God.
[1:12:55] That all right.
[1:12:57] So he says
[1:12:59] when the human element goes out the
[1:13:01] spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:13:05] where you emptied yourself. Amen. You
[1:13:10] emptied yourself.
[1:13:12] Then will be when God in his power of
[1:13:17] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will
[1:13:21] walk in his steps.
[1:13:25] We walk so carnal so long, we feel like
[1:13:29] that's a way of life.
[1:13:34] Well, well, if I, you know, if I get to
[1:13:36] believe in that, Amen. I, you know,
[1:13:38] somebody think I'm spiritual, they need
[1:13:39] to. They seen the other side of you long
[1:13:42] enough.
[1:13:45] Amen.
[1:13:48] I don't see how people says, "Well, they
[1:13:50] quit the message." No, they didn't. He
[1:13:53] cannot quit being a Le Fontaine.
[1:13:57] He can't quit.
[1:14:01] There's no way that you can quit.
[1:14:06] You can't quit. No. Somebody said,
[1:14:08] "Well, brother man, I miss it here."
[1:14:11] Really? So, how smart you become,
[1:14:17] right?
[1:14:18] So if he can't quit being a Leontaine,
[1:14:22] then you cannot quit being a son of God.
[1:14:26] Lord,
[1:14:29] I didn't say you can't get tangled up. I
[1:14:32] can't I didn't say that you can't have
[1:14:34] bad days,
[1:14:36] but you cannot quit.
[1:14:41] Nine years ago, coming September, my
[1:14:45] wife died was d Well, she was dying. and
[1:14:47] she was leaving the scene. She told me,
[1:14:49] she said, "Three things, Homer, whatever
[1:14:51] you do, don't quit.
[1:14:54] Don't mess your life up. And I love you
[1:14:57] so much." And she went to be with the
[1:14:59] Lord.
[1:15:04] And probably reason she said, "Don't
[1:15:06] mess up cuz she always kept me straight
[1:15:08] to start with."
[1:15:11] And she know I'm releasing I'm releasing
[1:15:14] you out there. Bunch of wolves.
[1:15:20] Brother Ben says
[1:15:23] he's released that power.
[1:15:26] Come on. We're not just gathering here
[1:15:28] this morning.
[1:15:29] He's released the power of his
[1:15:32] resurrection in you this morning.
[1:15:37] You heard brother Digs talk about it
[1:15:38] last night.
[1:15:40] Amen. It's been released to you.
[1:15:45] Amen. And when it's released to you,
[1:15:48] then God expects somebody to do that.
[1:15:54] Right.
[1:15:56] Somebody said, "Well, you know, I I
[1:15:58] don't know if I'm doing right." Every
[1:15:59] one of you got spiritual discernment
[1:16:02] that's filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] because you're a son of God and you have
[1:16:07] to be led by the spirit of God.
[1:16:12] See, you know why? As brother B said,
[1:16:15] those sheep followed him because that
[1:16:19] was that was a tutor that they were
[1:16:21] under.
[1:16:25] The reason where where we at is a tutor
[1:16:29] that we under,
[1:16:31] right?
[1:16:33] It's a tutor that we've been under.
[1:16:34] That's right.
[1:16:37] No, brother Diggs. I got close, but I
[1:16:39] ain't going to jump.
[1:16:42] I made a mistake when I was in Trinidad.
[1:16:45] They got this high platform.
[1:16:48] I jumped off of that baby.
[1:16:51] I went airborne.
[1:16:54] I drove my legs back up in my body.
[1:17:00] I said, I went over six feet. Come back
[1:17:01] 5'5.
[1:17:07] I said, "The next night I preached, I
[1:17:09] got over to the edge."
[1:17:12] No, you're not, boy.
[1:17:17] It didn't look that far.
[1:17:19] I'm glad I just didn't step over or step
[1:17:23] out cuz I'd have been only one on the
[1:17:26] plane with concrete in my nose.
[1:17:31] So you see sometimes, amen, we move at
[1:17:35] our own deal.
[1:17:40] But brother man said the reason they
[1:17:42] follow because they've been tutored by
[1:17:44] that shepherd.
[1:17:46] Yes, sir. See, you've been tutored.
[1:17:51] Hey, beyond your own reason, you've been
[1:17:53] tutored under the spirit, under the
[1:17:56] leadership of this man.
[1:18:00] Hey, and and whether you like it or not,
[1:18:03] when you go out and something comes up
[1:18:05] concerning this church, you relate
[1:18:09] about what your tutor.
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:18] No man going to lead me. No, your wife
[1:18:20] aren't.
[1:18:22] Wife probably leading her,
[1:18:25] right? Somebody's led by something.
[1:18:30] So, Brother Bam said they followed him
[1:18:33] because they was tutored by him.
[1:18:36] Amen. You remember how brother Bam
[1:18:37] talked about the eagle? They had already
[1:18:39] given. She had already instructed them
[1:18:42] before they left the nest.
[1:18:44] God's already Amen. That's the reason
[1:18:46] you say, "Oh, my my granddaughter."
[1:18:49] Amen. They asked asked my daughter and
[1:18:51] they had that that buming over your arm.
[1:18:53] Is that the coming of the Lord? She
[1:18:56] ain't ready for the coming of the Lord.
[1:18:57] She didn't serve the Lord.
[1:19:00] But she's been under my tutor chip.
[1:19:06] She don't know.
[1:19:09] Papa,
[1:19:12] my other granddaughter, she don't serve
[1:19:14] the Lord. She said, "Papa, when you go,
[1:19:16] I'm going to go, too." I said, "You
[1:19:17] better change.
[1:19:23] I said one one of the two ain't going
[1:19:25] the same place.
[1:19:29] Amen.
[1:19:31] But brother B says
[1:19:35] he can say
[1:19:38] be no be no cancer.
[1:19:41] But you know what? Most people don't
[1:19:43] believe that.
[1:19:45] They don't believe it.
[1:19:47] But that's the power of the spirit's
[1:19:49] been given to you. That's right.
[1:19:54] You didn't give it to yourself. He did
[1:19:57] when you met the criteria of God's word.
[1:20:01] He gave it to you.
[1:20:06] Why did the scripture say, "I can do all
[1:20:08] things
[1:20:10] through Christ who strengthens me."
[1:20:12] If all things means all things.
[1:20:19] Hey, you know, you know, back in the
[1:20:22] back back in the early 70s, I got burnt.
[1:20:25] Second, third degree burn 35% of my
[1:20:27] body.
[1:20:29] Well, it was hot.
[1:20:32] My body never been that hot in ever.
[1:20:36] But you know what?
[1:20:38] I said, you know, God already made a
[1:20:40] way.
[1:20:41] I said, "My doctor tells me I got a skin
[1:20:44] graft your hips.
[1:20:46] I lost 12 pounds dehydrating. I don't
[1:20:48] need to get burnt, but I could use lose
[1:20:50] to 12 pounds now."
[1:20:54] But he said, "I got a skin graft your
[1:20:55] hips. Fluid's just going right out of
[1:20:57] your body."
[1:21:00] I said, "Somebody cut me, shoot me.
[1:21:02] Don't burn me." So, I'm trying to escape
[1:21:05] that place.
[1:21:07] But you know what? He said, "You know,
[1:21:10] we got to do this." I said, "You do what
[1:21:11] you got to do, but there's a higher
[1:21:13] power.
[1:21:16] There's a higher power." And I said, you
[1:21:18] know, sitting right there in that
[1:21:20] building, in that place, I said, you
[1:21:22] know, maybe some of you been in medical
[1:21:23] field, they put me in 400 gallons of of
[1:21:27] water and they started taking the hide
[1:21:28] off of me.
[1:21:31] They took a little sand black, we call I
[1:21:33] called it sandpaper, a little white
[1:21:35] cough.
[1:21:36] And he told me, he said, "You go get to
[1:21:38] where this thing is going to feel like
[1:21:40] solid sandpaper."
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:44] And I said, "Hey, we're there right now.
[1:21:46] Stop."
[1:21:48] And so they took me up to my room. They
[1:21:50] doped me up with some kind of little
[1:21:52] white sav. And I thought I was burnt all
[1:21:55] over again.
[1:21:59] But I say this,
[1:22:01] Amen. He said, "We got to do this." And
[1:22:04] I said, "You know what? God come on the
[1:22:06] scene. That was the first thing healed
[1:22:08] up on me.
[1:22:10] God closed all the pores in my skin.
[1:22:16] My feet had third degree
[1:22:19] burns on them
[1:22:22] cuz I had I got burnt with hot water and
[1:22:25] I said my boots filled up. I had rubber
[1:22:27] boots on it filled up with water.
[1:22:31] You ever seen a founder, you know what a
[1:22:33] foundered cow, their feet kicks back
[1:22:36] like so?
[1:22:38] You ever seen a found anybody ever seen
[1:22:39] a founder cow or something? Anybody ever
[1:22:41] seen a cow?
[1:22:48] Well, you know, they'll get to the place
[1:22:49] like kind of like arthritic and they'll
[1:22:51] just pull back. That's exactly how my
[1:22:54] feet was. and just pull back because the
[1:22:58] top of my feet was burnt.
[1:23:04] I know you said, "Oh, whoa." I did too.
[1:23:08] I did too.
[1:23:11] You know, and I said,
[1:23:13] Marie said, I told the doctors, I said,
[1:23:16] "I need to go home."
[1:23:18] And they said, "Well, I we ain't going
[1:23:20] to let you go home." I said, "We're
[1:23:21] going I'm going home. I'm going home.
[1:23:24] I'm going home.
[1:23:27] So I crawled out of the bed.
[1:23:30] They couldn't even have a plant in my
[1:23:32] room cuz a burn gets infected real easy.
[1:23:36] So they couldn't even have enough not
[1:23:38] even a plant which I didn't need a
[1:23:39] plant.
[1:23:41] So I crawled out of that bed and I stood
[1:23:43] up on them feet
[1:23:46] and when it did it busted all over.
[1:23:48] Busted.
[1:23:51] You ain't seen my little wife come in
[1:23:53] there. And she
[1:23:59] she said, "H Homer,
[1:24:01] you know they're not going to let you go
[1:24:02] home. I'm going home.
[1:24:06] I'm going home."
[1:24:08] Amen.
[1:24:10] My hips is healing up. I'm going home.
[1:24:13] Amen.
[1:24:15] And you know, they started burning. My
[1:24:17] feet started burning and burning,
[1:24:19] bleeding and bleeding. I kept standing
[1:24:22] on them. I kept standing on him.
[1:24:27] In his name.
[1:24:30] In his name.
[1:24:32] You know, he he was so much in his name.
[1:24:35] Amen. I was 31 years old when I got
[1:24:38] burnt. I'm 83 years old today. I own no
[1:24:42] scar on my body.
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:52] He does it well.
[1:24:56] Why? He said he would do it.
[1:25:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:05] Is that all right? Amen. Then he says,
[1:25:10] "What is it?" It's you speaking by the
[1:25:13] Holy Spirit.
[1:25:16] Let there be no cancer. The cancer's
[1:25:18] there, but let there be none.
[1:25:22] Brother said, "Let there be no cancer."
[1:25:25] And he said, "It would be gone."
[1:25:32] Anybody in here ever had cancer? I know
[1:25:34] Brother Diggs had uh some kind of brain
[1:25:37] tumor or something like that.
[1:25:43] I know what it's like.
[1:25:45] 2014 they told me I had prostate cancer.
[1:25:51] Well, I wouldn't take nothing from my
[1:25:53] journey. Now 2014
[1:25:56] they said I had prostate cancer.
[1:26:01] When they say that Cword
[1:26:04] immediately you stop breathing.
[1:26:09] Anybody ever been there?
[1:26:12] You you folks that's been there? Sister
[1:26:15] Sharon, she'd been there.
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] I got a I got a boy at the church and I
[1:26:25] went by his place of business and and
[1:26:28] everybody knew I was going to the doctor
[1:26:30] that day and he said, "Uh, what the
[1:26:32] doctor said?" And they said, I said,
[1:26:33] "They said, I got it." Well, he broke
[1:26:36] down crying and I'm the one that got it.
[1:26:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:45] You know what?
[1:26:47] Brother Rem said, "God heals by
[1:26:48] doctors."
[1:26:53] Well, don't y'all believe that?
[1:26:56] When the doctors can't do no more.
[1:26:59] Amen.
[1:27:01] Amen.
[1:27:03] So what'd you do, brother Homer?
[1:27:05] Nothing. They did. They put 86 seeds in
[1:27:09] me. 2014.
[1:27:12] What's this year? 2025.
[1:27:15] My PSA was perfect.
[1:27:20] What is that's him?
[1:27:23] That's him.
[1:27:28] You said, "Brother Homer, if I let my
[1:27:30] mind wonder if I get a hangail, there it
[1:27:33] comes back."
[1:27:36] Everybody does it.
[1:27:38] Oh my. You reckon it's coming back?
[1:27:43] Now the song says, "I'm taking it back.
[1:27:46] All that the God has done for me."
[1:27:50] Amen.
[1:27:52] Amen. When the scripture says, look, he
[1:27:55] said, let there be no cancer,
[1:27:58] he said it'll be gone.
[1:28:01] Hallelujah. He said it'll be gone.
[1:28:03] That's right. But we depend. We depend
[1:28:05] on somebody to do it for us.
[1:28:08] But now he says because of the spirit of
[1:28:10] God, the Holy Ghost is in you. Amen. You
[1:28:12] say it, let it be gone.
[1:28:16] Amen. Don't worry about how many prayer
[1:28:18] lines you can go through. Don't worry
[1:28:20] about how many preachers going to come
[1:28:21] by.
[1:28:22] You speak it gone.
[1:28:26] That's good preaching. You speak it
[1:28:27] gone. You're a believer.
[1:28:32] God entrusted you
[1:28:34] with the power of God or the authority
[1:28:37] of God.
[1:28:39] You say amen.
[1:28:41] Amen. See the excuse me. See, the thing
[1:28:44] about it is when Elisha
[1:28:48] picked up the robe, he wanted the same
[1:28:51] effect
[1:28:52] that Elijah had
[1:28:55] and I pick up this robe, I want the same
[1:28:57] effect that he had.
[1:29:02] Now, if I'm following something and he
[1:29:05] said, "This is what's supposed to be the
[1:29:06] church." Amen. Then I want the same
[1:29:10] effects. Amen. Amen. He Amen. He had his
[1:29:14] critics. Elisha had him. Amen. Don't you
[1:29:17] know your master is going to be taken
[1:29:18] up? Yes. That's the reason I'm following
[1:29:20] him. I know that he's going to be taken
[1:29:24] up. But if I'm here, I'll get what he's
[1:29:28] got.
[1:29:29] And Jesus said, "When I go away, I'll
[1:29:32] send you another comforter."
[1:29:35] Somebody said, "Well, that's reason I
[1:29:37] don't understand why people so depressed
[1:29:38] all the time."
[1:29:42] Uh
[1:29:44] David said, "When nobody's around to
[1:29:46] encourage me, I just encourage myself."
[1:29:51] I like funny things. I like to see
[1:29:52] things funny and I like to laugh by
[1:29:55] myself.
[1:30:00] Huh? I like to, you know, I just like to
[1:30:03] You know why? Because it encourages my
[1:30:06] inner man.
[1:30:08] It encourages me.
[1:30:12] One time I come in the living room and
[1:30:14] Margie was laughing. I said, "What in
[1:30:17] the world are you so tickled about?" And
[1:30:20] she showed me a little cartoon thing.
[1:30:24] I said, "That ain't even funny."
[1:30:29] She never stopped laughing.
[1:30:33] She never stopped laughing because it
[1:30:36] was doing something for her.
[1:30:41] We sing all these songs. We sing all
[1:30:43] happy songs.
[1:30:46] Amen.
[1:30:48] Amen. And you, you know, you watch
[1:30:49] people sing a happy song.
[1:30:53] Their face is not there.
[1:30:58] Amen.
[1:30:59] Oh, don't tell me I pastor a church.
[1:31:01] I've been there 44 years.
[1:31:04] 44 years.
[1:31:08] I was 38 years old when I went.
[1:31:13] I told somebody the other day, I don't
[1:31:14] believe you get nobody else.
[1:31:16] They said, 'You know, you got a mant.
[1:31:20] But you know what, Becky? I remember
[1:31:23] when you all you guys used to come down
[1:31:26] all of that Wade bunch
[1:31:29] had a sister one time. She said, "You
[1:31:31] know who you know what my name is,
[1:31:32] brother?" And I said, "No." I said,
[1:31:34] "What is she said?" Martha. I said
[1:31:36] self-rising flower.
[1:31:42] Amen.
[1:31:44] Laugh.
[1:31:46] Give your face a rest.
[1:31:49] Some people don't feel like we're not
[1:31:51] spiritual if we're laughing.
[1:31:54] A merry heart does good like a medicine.
[1:31:57] Some of y'all must been on some means
[1:31:59] some bad stuff.
[1:32:04] Huh?
[1:32:05] Come on and give yourself a smile.
[1:32:09] You know what? He he you know, have you
[1:32:11] ever been to a doctor and they give you
[1:32:13] a good report?
[1:32:15] What do you do? Oh man. Oh man. God
[1:32:18] gives you one every day.
[1:32:26] God gives you one every day.
[1:32:29] Amen.
[1:32:31] I thought I saw this cartoon. This guy
[1:32:34] fell over the cliff. He had he was
[1:32:35] holding to a a twig and he screamed,
[1:32:38] "Anybody help me? Is anybody out there
[1:32:40] to help me?" God said, "Turn loose." He
[1:32:43] said, "Anybody else out there?"
[1:32:51] That's the way we are.
[1:32:54] Amen.
[1:32:56] You think Brother went to hospital?
[1:32:58] Yeah. And he witnessed to everybody was
[1:33:00] in there. Yes, he did.
[1:33:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:05] Ain't it ain't it? Ain't it? God. Amen.
[1:33:08] God put a song in your Y'all sing all
[1:33:10] the time. Paul, I've know y'all singing
[1:33:12] for ever since I know you.
[1:33:15] Y'all must sing in your sleep.
[1:33:18] That right, Sher. You just sang and
[1:33:20] sang. Sang and sang. If I could sing, I
[1:33:22] probably would, too.
[1:33:26] Amen. But you know what is it? It makes
[1:33:29] melody. Something's happening. That's
[1:33:31] right.
[1:33:33] That's the reason, you know, I hear
[1:33:35] brother Brandham saying things that
[1:33:36] applies to me, I shout. I tell him,
[1:33:39] "Brother Paul," I said, "When I got
[1:33:43] saved,
[1:33:44] something happened." And I said, "All of
[1:33:46] a sudden, somebody comes out with a song
[1:33:50] that identifies
[1:33:52] exactly what happened to me on my
[1:33:54] baptism." Amen.
[1:33:56] If you ever heard the song, I left it
[1:33:58] all when I when I was baptized.
[1:34:03] I said, I I said I smoked three and four
[1:34:08] packs a day. I drank like it wasn't
[1:34:10] going to make no more the next day. I
[1:34:12] cursed like I I didn't even have good
[1:34:14] sense. But on February the 16th, 1969, I
[1:34:18] stepped into that water and I said,
[1:34:20] "God, take me or clean me one. Yeah.
[1:34:25] February the 16th. I never smoked, never
[1:34:27] drank, never caroused around. Have to
[1:34:31] never use bad language no more. I left
[1:34:34] it all.
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:40] I left it all when I got baptized.
[1:34:43] Why? Because I went down, you know. No,
[1:34:47] I wasn't like Jesse Taylor this time. He
[1:34:50] went down for the Lord. I went down for
[1:34:53] deliverance of the Lord.
[1:34:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:59] Amen.
[1:35:01] Y'all love him this morning.
[1:35:04] Bubba, what time is it? A God have
[1:35:07] mercy. You know it's late. Amen. It's
[1:35:10] almost 1:00. Jesus have mercy. Boy, my
[1:35:13] church, if they looking, they going to
[1:35:14] be mad and hornet.
[1:35:18] Can I read this here to you? Yes.
[1:35:21] You can express it by mental conception.
[1:35:24] Listen to me. But if it becomes real,
[1:35:28] revelation of God that you see it before
[1:35:32] it happens.
[1:35:35] Brother said that's what faith does.
[1:35:37] Brother says faith sees things before it
[1:35:41] happens. Brother says it like this.
[1:35:44] Faith brings things when there's nothing
[1:35:46] to brain. That's right.
[1:35:50] Amen. Faith will bring things. I told
[1:35:53] the church last Sunday, I said, "Faith
[1:35:56] is a long range vision.
[1:36:00] It's a long range." Amen. Amen. It's way
[1:36:03] out, but faith gives you Amen. It's
[1:36:06] going to happen.
[1:36:09] It's going to happen.
[1:36:11] Is that right? That's what he said.
[1:36:13] Brother said a long range.
[1:36:16] Amen. That's the reason brother Brandon
[1:36:18] said he said when you use binoculars to
[1:36:20] see way out Junter. You don't use them
[1:36:23] to see right here. That's right. But you
[1:36:26] look for it way out. Amen. And when you
[1:36:29] look at way out Juner, you seeing
[1:36:31] exactly what's fixing to happen up here.
[1:36:34] Amen. Because faith puts it there. Amen.
[1:36:37] Watch what he says. Amen. Musician, get
[1:36:40] ready. Amen.
[1:36:44] See, you see it. Brother Ben said, "When
[1:36:46] the revelation of God comes, that's the
[1:36:48] reason you don't get afraid of missing
[1:36:49] the rapture. You already saw it."
[1:36:53] Amen. You just hadn't been caught away
[1:36:55] yet.
[1:36:57] Amen. You just ain't been caught away,
[1:36:59] but you already see yourself
[1:37:02] there. Yes. Praise the Lord. Amen. He
[1:37:06] says, "Amen." He said you see it before
[1:37:09] it happens and express it in the word in
[1:37:14] the word form that that word takes a
[1:37:16] hold and becomes material a thought
[1:37:20] expressed expressed. Oh how God Amen. If
[1:37:25] your heart and your mind is so
[1:37:28] infiltered with God's spirit until you
[1:37:32] if your heart and your mind is so filled
[1:37:35] with God's spirit until the thoughts
[1:37:38] become his thoughts.
[1:37:42] So feel
[1:37:44] you say, "Well, brother Homer, I'm
[1:37:46] having a problem." Get filled.
[1:37:49] Keep coming to the well of grace.
[1:37:52] Come on back. Amen. Find your place.
[1:37:55] Amen. You don't just have to come up
[1:37:57] here. Find your place. That when you can
[1:38:00] get feel and he can express himself when
[1:38:03] you come here. That's right.
[1:38:06] Then you can express yourself.
[1:38:09] Can you say amen?
[1:38:11] Amen. You can express. Amen. Brother Bam
[1:38:14] said your thoughts become his thoughts.
[1:38:17] Amen. See there you are when your mind
[1:38:21] and you're leading. Amen. and and your
[1:38:24] guiding becomes a direct place, a direct
[1:38:28] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:38:31] moving your mortal being. Let's stand.
[1:38:36] Let's stand this morning. You love him?
[1:38:39] Anybody believe this beside me?
[1:38:44] I believe this. I live on this. Cuz
[1:38:47] there's a lot of things I can't do.
[1:38:50] You know, like I told you, if I'm
[1:38:52] running some something's after me
[1:38:56] cuz I ain't running on my own.
[1:38:59] I was kidding somebody day. I said, I
[1:39:01] get my exercise every morning. I get out
[1:39:03] of bed and go get my recliner,
[1:39:08] but I'm going to tell you what,
[1:39:11] you may not be around for me to call on.
[1:39:14] You may not be around for me to say,
[1:39:16] "Hey, look, I need you."
[1:39:18] But God said, "You're so empowered and
[1:39:20] enshrouded
[1:39:22] that when you say,
[1:39:25] you know, that's all right for somebody
[1:39:27] else to say it, but when you have to say
[1:39:29] it,
[1:39:31] you have to say it to the spirit of
[1:39:32] God."
[1:39:34] How many times we've had to say it,
[1:39:37] amen, be it unto us.
[1:39:40] Amen. And brother said, you know, hey,
[1:39:43] he said, if you say,
[1:39:46] Amen. If it's I need that moved, but
[1:39:50] just say God just move it. Go on about
[1:39:52] your business. Don't worry about how
[1:39:54] he's going to do it. That's it.
[1:39:58] Amen. If it needs to be moved, you're
[1:40:00] causing somebody else, maybe a carnal
[1:40:02] man, come and move the situation.
[1:40:05] But you're moving it according to your
[1:40:07] faith.
[1:40:09] Is that all right? Come on, Paul. Get me
[1:40:11] out of this.
[1:40:13] Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] You love him this morning.
[1:40:17] Amen. Y'all know how to appreciate my
[1:40:19] church. I like what I read a little
[1:40:22] article the other day. I said, you know,
[1:40:25] I read this article said, you know, I
[1:40:28] want to be so full of the power of God,
[1:40:29] the blood that if a mosquito bites me,
[1:40:32] he'll fly off and said there's power in
[1:40:34] the blood.
[1:40:40] Yeah. Amen.
[1:40:43] You love him. Amen. and smile a while.
[1:40:47] Amen. Amen. You know what? I was
[1:40:50] listening as though I were looking at
[1:40:52] Amen.
[1:40:53] Oh, Buddy Robertson's he made a
[1:40:56] statement one time. He said, "Amen."
[1:41:00] He said, "If you got worry, if you got
[1:41:03] still got worry, you tell God he's a
[1:41:05] liar.
[1:41:07] If you got worry, you telling God he's a
[1:41:09] liar."
[1:41:12] Paul, get me out of this. Father,
[1:41:16] bless your people this morning. Thank
[1:41:18] you for allowing us to speak. Father,
[1:41:21] Lord, I thank you. I thank you for
[1:41:22] Brother Paul, Sister Loretta, the all
[1:41:26] the all the ones, Father, the family. I
[1:41:29] appreciate them. Father, been friends to
[1:41:31] me a long time ago. And Lord, we're
[1:41:34] still here. Lord, I remember being here
[1:41:36] when Brother John passed. Lord, I feel
[1:41:40] like brother John was always a friend to
[1:41:43] me.
[1:41:44] I remember used to go by and when he was
[1:41:47] in Arkansas and he here I was coming
[1:41:50] through and and he asked me said,
[1:41:52] "Brother Roman, will you come on
[1:41:53] Wednesday night?" And I said, "I can't."
[1:41:55] He said, "What night can you come by?" I
[1:41:57] said, "I'd be coming by on Monday
[1:41:59] night." He said, "We just have church."
[1:42:02] So, we just had church on Monday night.
[1:42:06] Amen. Why?
[1:42:08] Cuz you know, God's people go to church.
[1:42:12] Amen.
[1:42:13] God bless you. Thank you.
[1:42:17] Pray for us. Pray for us on the way home
[1:42:19] today. It's just 11 hours. No problem.
[1:42:24] Hallelujah. I love you. I love Brother
[1:42:27] Paul. God bless you, brother. Amen.
[1:42:30] Enjoy that this morning.
[1:42:36] Well, it wouldn't take nothing for my
[1:42:38] journey now. I got to make it to heaven
[1:42:41] somehow. Oh, the devil ts me and tries
[1:42:44] to turn me around.
[1:42:47] He's offered everything that's got a
[1:42:49] name, all the wealth I want. Worldly
[1:42:52] fame if I could still I wouldn't take
[1:42:54] nothing for my journey now.
[1:42:58] Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my
[1:43:00] journey now. Amen.
[1:43:03] Somehow though, the devil takes me and
[1:43:06] tries to turn me around.
[1:43:09] He's offered everything that's got a
[1:43:12] name. All the wealth I want worldly fame
[1:43:16] still I wouldn't
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:21] I started out traveling for the Lord
[1:43:23] many years ago.
[1:43:26] I had a lot of heartaches and had a lot
[1:43:28] of grief and wo
[1:43:31] oh but when I was stumbled then I would
[1:43:34] humble down
[1:43:37] say thank the Lord I wouldn't take
[1:43:39] nothing for my journey now
[1:43:43] I wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[1:43:45] now I'm making some
[1:43:49] me trying to turn it around
[1:43:53] he's everything that's I name all the
[1:43:57] wealth I want world
[1:44:00] I would take nothing from my journey now
[1:44:04] there's nothing in the world that'll
[1:44:06] ever take the place of God's love
[1:44:10] silver and gold can never rise my touch
[1:44:13] from above
[1:44:15] when my soul is here he begin to feel
[1:44:18] his power
[1:44:21] I can say the Lord I wouldn't take back
[1:44:24] my
[1:44:26] I won't take nothing from my journey
[1:44:29] now. I got to somehow
[1:44:33] teach me to turn me around.
[1:44:37] He's offered everything that's got me
[1:44:40] all the
[1:44:42] world. If I could still
[1:44:45] sing it one more time.
[1:44:48] I wouldn't take nothing from the
[1:44:50] journey. I got to make it somehow
[1:44:55] teach me.
[1:44:59] He's offered everything that's got a
[1:45:01] name all the way
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:08] down.
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:16] Praise the Lord. Amen. And I want that
[1:45:20] journey to get better and better because
[1:45:24] I appreciate what the Lord's done. But I
[1:45:26] tell you, I want to walk in the spirit
[1:45:28] led by his mind and not my own. And
[1:45:32] brother Ram said something in the
[1:45:33] message. He says, he said, he said, we
[1:45:36] live so much in our minds and our our
[1:45:39] functioning from our mind. We never give
[1:45:42] the inward man a chance to operate.
[1:45:45] That's the way he says it. We never give
[1:45:48] the inward man. So those of us who have
[1:45:50] the Holy Ghost, you've got the inward
[1:45:52] man. And it's not you. It's not your
[1:45:54] mind. It's the mind of Christ in the
[1:45:56] Holy Ghost. We just got to learn to
[1:45:58] yield and function by the mind of
[1:46:00] Christ. How much of our life, you ask
[1:46:03] yourself, how much of my life, your life
[1:46:06] is we're functioning by our own opinions
[1:46:08] injected in. But how many would raise
[1:46:10] your hand say Lord let me function from
[1:46:12] the inward man? Let him guide my
[1:46:15] decisions. You're going to be influenced
[1:46:17] by something. I tell young people,
[1:46:19] nobody makes their own decisions. You
[1:46:21] make your own decisions, but they're
[1:46:23] influenced by somebody, either the right
[1:46:25] or the wrong. So, you're going to make
[1:46:27] choices, but who are those choices in? I
[1:46:29] want my choices to be formed. As brother
[1:46:32] Bram says, that bride is built into
[1:46:36] living by the mind of Christ. And that's
[1:46:38] the way. How many want to function from
[1:46:39] that inward man? Watchman Nia a uh
[1:46:43] missionary to China said this in 1900s
[1:46:46] he said he looked over at the American
[1:46:49] church and he said my they're doing
[1:46:50] mighty things and building churches and
[1:46:52] doing all these other things. He says
[1:46:54] it's amazing he's very critical said
[1:46:57] it's amazing what the American church
[1:46:59] can accomplish without the leadership of
[1:47:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:47:05] doing all these things and and and
[1:47:07] amazing what man can do. But he was
[1:47:10] being critical saying, "But are we being
[1:47:11] led by the Holy Ghost of what we do?" Uh
[1:47:15] friends, we come along in the journey.
[1:47:17] It's time for the bride to say humbly,
[1:47:19] "Lord, every day, let me be led by the
[1:47:22] inward man and not my own thoughts." My
[1:47:25] dad used to call it stinking thinking.
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:29] Our thinking is stinking thinking. Let's
[1:47:32] get beyond that. Let's let the mind of
[1:47:34] Christ lead us. Can you say amen? I want
[1:47:35] to thank God today for
[1:47:38] friends and men like brother Homer. For
[1:47:42] some reason, the Lord blessed me with
[1:47:45] mentors like this, Brother Hill
[1:47:46] Hilderbrandt, my dad, Brother Perry
[1:47:48] Green. And I was come at a certain time
[1:47:51] that I my life has been so uh formed and
[1:47:54] mentored by men like this. And there's a
[1:47:57] couple of them strange characters like
[1:47:59] brother Homer.
[1:48:02] Just very extremely different.
[1:48:05] But they taught me how to laugh.
[1:48:08] You got my dad and him together. I'm
[1:48:10] telling you, you just that was it. There
[1:48:12] there was it just become
[1:48:15] borderline carnal. No doubt about it.
[1:48:19] But laughter doeth it good like a
[1:48:21] medicine. No, nobody can laugh like a
[1:48:23] true Christian that's at serving the
[1:48:24] Lord and enjoy life. And that's why I
[1:48:27] appreciate there's so much mentoring
[1:48:29] that these brothers have done. Brother
[1:48:30] Homer, I love you. I don't get to say it
[1:48:32] very much. I love you. I love your
[1:48:34] family. I appreciate brother Homer's
[1:48:37] grand one of his many grandsons, I
[1:48:39] think, is here. Jonathan, where you at?
[1:48:42] Where's Brother Jonathan? It's good to
[1:48:43] have his grandson with us today. How's
[1:48:46] it What's it like to live with this
[1:48:47] character every day? telling you. You
[1:48:50] want to come up and testify in that a
[1:48:51] little bit?
[1:48:53] It might turn out bad after a while.
[1:48:56] Praise the Lord. How many How many
[1:48:58] lives? He lives in your yard. Not in the
[1:49:02] house. In the yard. I can understand
[1:49:03] that. How many great grandchildren? How
[1:49:06] many How many great grandchildren you
[1:49:08] got?
[1:49:09] 15. Two on the way.
[1:49:15] I'm I'm going to repeat that.
[1:49:18] 15 great grandchildren. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:21] God's blessed him. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:23] Amen. Well, we appreciate this. And uh
[1:49:26] my you know, let's sing let's sing that.
[1:49:29] The joy of the Lord is my strength in
[1:49:34] him. The joy of the Lord is Do you
[1:49:39] believe that this morning? The joy of
[1:49:42] the Lord is my strength. The joy of the
[1:49:47] Lord is my strength.
[1:49:51] He fills my heart with laughter.
[1:49:55] Ha ha. Oh. He fills my heart with
[1:49:58] laughter.
[1:50:00] Ha. It's okay. You can laugh.
[1:50:04] It's okay.
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:12] The word of God is mighty even in thy
[1:50:16] mouth. The word of God is mighty even in
[1:50:21] thy mouth. The word of God is mighty
[1:50:25] even in thy mouth. The word of God is
[1:50:30] mighty in the mouth.
[1:50:33] The joy of the Lord
[1:50:37] is my strength.
[1:50:40] of the Lord
[1:50:42] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
[1:50:48] my strength. The joy of the Lord is my
[1:50:52] strength.
[1:50:55] Amen. How many believe that? That's what
[1:50:58] the Bible says. The joy of the Lord is
[1:51:00] your strength. Father, we thank you for
[1:51:02] this time, Lord, around the word of God
[1:51:04] and the way that it's presented to us,
[1:51:06] Lord, that you have, as it was said last
[1:51:09] night and today again, you're saying to
[1:51:11] us, everything has already been done.
[1:51:14] Lord, it's not like we're even asking
[1:51:15] for something. It's already been
[1:51:17] provided, but you want us to speak it.
[1:51:20] It stays a thought until we speak it.
[1:51:23] Lord, I pray that we want to just be led
[1:51:25] by our own mind, but I pray we'd be led
[1:51:27] by your mind. And that Lord that word
[1:51:29] would come forth and we confess the
[1:51:31] positive. Confess the truth. Confess
[1:51:34] what we can see that long range faith,
[1:51:37] that long range vision. Confess it
[1:51:39] before we even see it that we confess
[1:51:41] it. Lord, I pray, Father, that would
[1:51:44] take place and lead us and guide us,
[1:51:46] Lord, into a greater way in this journey
[1:51:48] that we could truly be led by the spirit
[1:51:50] of God. Lord, when we're led by our
[1:51:52] flesh, Lord, we wouldn't come to church.
[1:51:54] We wouldn't do anything. Lord, we're not
[1:51:56] led by our flesh. When we're led by our
[1:51:58] emotions, then they can be up one day
[1:52:00] and down the other. Lord, we don't want
[1:52:01] to be led by our emotions. We don't want
[1:52:04] to be led by our sicknesses, Lord. God,
[1:52:06] we want to be led by the Holy Ghost. And
[1:52:09] we know the Holy Ghost comes to church.
[1:52:11] The Holy Ghost follows the word. The
[1:52:13] Holy Ghost is hungry for the word of
[1:52:15] God. Lord, when we're being led by that,
[1:52:18] we don't have to press ourselves into
[1:52:20] it. Father, we know it comes natural
[1:52:22] because the hunger is already there.
[1:52:24] Lord, I pray if someone's lacking the
[1:52:26] joy of the Lord today that you'll fill
[1:52:28] them. Fill them, Lord, with your
[1:52:31] strength from your joy. We love you,
[1:52:33] Father. Thank you for Brother Homer.
[1:52:35] Bless him. Put your angels around him as
[1:52:37] he goes home, Lord, back to Alabama. We
[1:52:39] pray that you'll be with him and his
[1:52:40] grandson. Bless the service tonight as
[1:52:43] we gather together again. We pray you
[1:52:45] just anoint us now in Jesus' name we ask
[1:52:48] it. Amen. Tonight's service is at 5:00.
[1:52:51] Brother Diggs will be speaking for us
[1:52:52] again. and we're looking forward to a
[1:52:54] time together around the word. God bless
[1:52:56] you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. You
[1:52:58] want to sing it like grandpa did?
[1:53:03] The joy of the Lord is my strength. The
[1:53:08] joy of the Lord is my strength. The joy
[1:53:14] of the Lord is my strength. The joy of
[1:53:20] the Lord is my strength. He fills He

[1:54:31] strength. The joy of the Lord, he is my
[1:54:36] strength. The joy of the Lord is my
[1:54:41] strength. The joy of the Lord is the
[1:54:45] word of God. Well, the word of God is
[1:54:49] mighty even in thy mouth. The word of
[1:54:54] God is mighty even in thy mouth. The
[1:54:59] word of God is mighty even in thy mouth.
[1:55:04] The word of God is mighty in thy mouth.
[1:55:10] Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:14] For it reaches

[1:55:21] mountain. Yes, Lord. Oh,

[1:55:28] to the lowest
[1:55:32] valley.
[1:55:34] Oh,
[1:55:37] the blood
[1:55:39] that gives me strength.
[1:55:42] From day
[1:55:44] to day, it will never
[1:55:49] never ever lose
[1:55:52] its power.
