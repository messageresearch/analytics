========================================

and now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy in other words there there's there they're in trouble they're in uh it's a scare it's in other words it's a it's uh it's going to be something that's bad and turn out bad and they came to him and awoke him saying a master master we perish and then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm and he said unto them where is your faith where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and the water and they obey him anybody notice that jesus tried to address their faith and ask them where their faith was and they were so afraid that they actually turned around and they also acknowledged this is a great man to be around he can speak to the winds and the waves what a great man what manner of man and this can completely miss the question from jesus where is your faith and when we're moving on like we said sunday and going forward the holy spirit his voice will always take us forward never back and especially in our own faith in the word of god and that's why he asked where's your faith i spoke to the winds but where's your faith in my word amen heavenly father blessed tonight bless what we say lord under your anointing and give us as the oracles of god we pray and we pray you just as we commit ourselves to it that lord we know that you're committed to the word and it won't return void may it bless and help and heal and encourage and lord jesus we're very happy to be christians tonight in these last times we wouldn't want to gamble lord with our souls and play any games we just want to know as the prophet proclaimed father we want to know when that day comes that we have our ticket in our hand that we have the token that we're ready to go when the rapture takes place father we just commit the service to you in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated tonight i wanted to speak a little bit uh mainly and get to the quote that i didn't get too sunny and preach on it a little bit we didn't get to that but we certainly had a good time in the house of the lord this past sunday and really enjoyed his presence and we wanted to continue that subject but i will title this tonight beyond crying to speaking beyond going beyond crying to speaking and going forward so beyond crying to speaking and at this moment that we were speaking of sunday i just want to preach a little bit about the red sea although i did sunday i want to go back to it just a moment and we were showing that they were in a tough spot in between pharaoh's army and the red sea and at that moment then everyone began to forget what god had said everyone including moses began to forget god's promise everyone lost sight of god coming down god calling a prophet god given signs to the prophet god's saying i have come to what did he say i come down to do anybody remember i have come down to do what i have come down to deliver you i have come down for one purpose i'm going to deliver you now friends we got to know when god says something then he intends on finishing the job how many believe that when god speaks it then it's as good as in the bag it's as good as done may take 20 years but if god spoke it it's going to be done and their promise was i am come down and i will deliver you but for some strange reason at this moment in the heat of the moment with fairies pharaoh's army behind coming to crush them and the red sea had they completely forgot god's word and began to cry and begin to be afraid and and so god had promised hundreds of years to come he spoke i'll do this he gave him signs and he commissioned moses he commissioned the children of israel to be called out and they actually were called out they actually were there out of egypt that should have been good enough too they were free from egypt they were free from his bondage and god come and put into motion a full exodus away from pharaoh and he sent judgments on egypt and all of this happened and all of a sudden everybody including moses forgets that and that forget the voice that's went out because we said sunday when the voice of god goes out it sets into motion the deliverance of the people when he begins to speak then god's deliverance has already come to the people it's just a matter of us believing it and watching god finish it it's when he speaks is when his voice speaks it has sets power in it it's not the signs can you say a man it's not that we follow the signs but the signs follow us these signs shall follow them that believe but it's not the signs that we follow the voice is enough to get us through if he says it i believe it that settles it and that's the way we should live and that's the way our faith should speak our faith should speak about that god said it i believe it that settled god's already it's already done no matter what kind of pharaoh's army is coming and plaguing our minds and giving a battle to us we should say these words listen god has already said it i believe it that settles it and that's why i say and brother branham said it and here god says it to moses why cry speak you know why god says that why are you crying when i've already spoken then you don't need to cry anymore now you know i'm not against the cries of the heart and god meets the cries of the heart and a lot of times we have great cries in our heart and and we're pleading god for god and i think that gets god attention but when it comes to a word that's already spoken you see friends we don't need a word from the lord for everything in our lives because he's already spoken some things we may pray and say god i need an answer for you whether to buy this or go into this investment and i think we should bring god into every part of our lives i don't think we should say there's this private area that i'll just deal with on my own can i say amen to that i don't think there should be any area of our life that we think is not really god's concern the simplest little detail brother bram says god's concerned with you got a little kid there with us with a scraped knee then you're teaching them lord we're going to take this great knee to you but you got a big knee like an investment or something like that don't ever do that on your own don't ever do something too quickly go to god about it god we need an answer so the things we need an answer for but there are things in the bible and i've pointed this out to people sometimes when they say i need to pray about this and i'll say to him i take him to a scripture and i'll say you don't need to pray about that it's already in the word you don't need to ask god whether it's true or not it's already there there are some things that god says and has already said and we just need to speak and go forward and not cry about it and there's a lot of things he says about us about predestination about our position in jesus christ the position of the bride that's already been spoken by the prophet you need don't need to find out from god you don't need to google and find out certain things we have been spoken to by god in this generation there's so many things that have been settled can you say amen and we ought to live settle because god has settled it by his word we're not worried about what we're not wondering what happened in the garden can you say man we're not wondering whether god's three personalities are one god we're not there's a lot there's a host of things we're not unsettled about in my why because god settled it and god settled it he spoke it and that settles it for me i don't need to be tossed and so now then this this this uh how do you call it just caught in between pharaoh and then here they get in this and they begin to cry out to god and this is what israel didn't know yet is the power of the word of god and the voice of god when he says when he says that you're going to be delivered you're going to be delivery and they had israel hadn't learned that yet even moses is teeter-totter in here because he really didn't need to cry unto god he just needed to speak and go forward i know moses didn't know how god was going to do it but he needed to speak it said god you said you'd deliver us and so i'm speaking and and i'm speaking and i'm taking the people forward because why he already said i'll deliver you so there's no sense in sitting there and entertaining thoughts that you know israel's just going through the scenarios of just being slaughtered out here in the middle of just by the red sea and all of our babies and children and our livestock and they're envisioning everything being slaughtered and pharaoh's army getting the victory and this was just a big this message wasn't true at all and here we are embarrassed out here slaughtered two million of them they're already getting pictures like that in their mind what out of their fear but they should not have had that why because god had spoken they should have been saying i don't know how god's going to do this one but he has to do it because he said he would deliver us oh somebody shout praise the lord [Applause] that's the attitude god wants to see in us and moses had just prophesied and said this day you'll no longer see these guys anymore they will they will be dead this day they'll watch your enemy die he just said it and then he goes to cry he starts to ask the lord what do i do next and that was god's biggest problem with moses is always asking what do i do next israel was crying out of fear but moses was in this habit i got to go to god about this i got to go to about but the commission he was already commissioned to take the people out he was already commissioned for deliverance and when you have been commissioned by god when god has already commissioned you how many tonight that you know that god called you out of a life of sin it wasn't you that just oh i wanted i wanted uh i wanted more of god no no no no god called you when you were even hardly even looking for him and then how many know has he saved you tonight how many knows he positioned you and commissioned you to be a lie to be a light of the gospel of jesus christ we have that commission you should go on into all the world and preach the gospel and and so so here tonight we're called we're saved we're filled with the holy spirit we've been commissioned we've been given our job we've been given our commission and if god has spoken that over your life moses has been given all of that commission and cyril he's saying what do i do next what do i do next if you know your commission then you know what to do next deliver the people you're commissioned to deliver the people for you moms out there you're commissioned to raise your children right now you've been commissioned by almighty god to raise your children someday you'll be finished with that commission and sisters are going oh hallelujah i can't be wait to be done with that because it's tough it's probably might be close to a pastor's job it's a tough job raising kids parents it's a tough job it's no picnic especially raising them in this world that we live in today but listen you've been commissioned you have a mandate from the scripture to raise those children in the admonition of the lord and when they're old they won't depart from it it won't depart from them you're commissioned by god and when you have a commission by god you don't scare away from satan you don't bow out of it can you say amen you don't you don't give up you don't quit can you say amen when you've been commissioned by god you stand there flat-footed god's commissioned me to do this and god will stand by me as i raise my children god will if he's commissioned he'll stand by you and so he started to ask the lord and god got a little upset because why did god get upset because when the voice has already said it you speak it and you walk into it i'm going to read that quote in a minute if you guys want to pull it up when you when god says it then you re-speak it and you walk into it god needed a people to get over there crying and go forward to stop crying and start speaking god needs a people to stop crying and start speaking now we're talking the third pole god needs a people to stop crying and complaining about everything and start re-speaking what he's already said reminding him lord you said this reminding him lord you said in isaiah by your stripes i am healed i'm not speaking it i'm just re-speaking it because god has already spoken it you speak it and you go forward that's what god wants to see of people do he wants to see a people speak it and walk into it god needs the people to stop crying and start speaking and when you're trapped though when you're trapped like these people were trapped his voice will only point you in one direction and we heard this on sunday how many remember brother bill sanchez go forward we go forward when you're trapped by the devil there's only one direction his voice will lead you and that's forward amen amen pray for brother bill he's i forgot to mention something he's actually have covered he had covered last year he got the vaccine a couple two or three months ago has coveted again and uh was in the hospital for it so i didn't know that so i called him the other night but if you would remember him in your prayers uh when when you're trapped his voice will only point in one direction so let's look at this quote a minute if you would god trains his men and this is a wonderful message why christ speak everything i'm saying here is said much better in this service and i'd like to read through all of it but i pulled out just one part of it so we can get the point but what a wonderful message and i will just say this i'll say it a little later but this is an adoption message um paradox is an adoption message after the seals why christ speak as an adoption message remember that we're in the age of adoption we're coming to adoption and why christ speak as an adoption message god trains his men then anoints them gives them experience takes them through the rigid training down through the stands of burning punishment trying testing not only does he do that to his prophets but he does it to his children every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried tested by his word see when the pinch come the strong time when it faces death are you able to stand there on the word of god and say god said so that settles it that's the test is when you are being tested are you able to stand on the word you may not have a feeling you may not have a sensation there might not be something come down from god where you just feel his presence that's not what he's saying when the test is there when you're up against the red sea what will you say in other words will you stand on the word of god and say god said so that settles it right now god said it that settles it for me and god had called such a man and that man was moses but moses a great deal like us every time it come to a place to something that had to be done moses called out oh lord what must i do in this place now isn't that just like we do god had blessed him and anointed him above his brother give him a message and a ministry that had not been on earth since that day until that day and yet every time something takes place and moses ran off to god with it lord what must i do what must i do in this case stop right there did joshua come to a better place did joshua come to that adoption thing where he wasn't waiting to go find out from god uh what do i need to do in this situation we're fighting all day what do i need to do did joshua go look into his bible did no no he didn't do that he had already been commissioned so joshua's speaking of adopted sons because he earned the commission god's going to destroy the enemy so one day he speaks and says son stand still there wasn't any time necessarily to go ask god what do i do in this situation too lord son stand still and it stood still because he was on this road he was in the in the way to serve the lord and he was commissioned lord what must i do what must i do in this case god kind of got tired of it i believe and said why are you crying to me speak to the people and go forward my if any time ever looked like they ought to retreat was then but god has no retreat that's why i preach sunday there's only one way his voice is leading you and that's forward god has no retreat there's no running away there's no going back to god this is too much i'm going back to my comfort zone no no stay around the holy spirit he gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you step into the fire the three hebrew children just stepped into the fire they didn't run can you say man he said woo-hoo no i didn't get in there and they took off running no they said all right listen we're not we're not worshiping your idol unto the prophet we're not going to worship the prophet daniel he's our brother we're not going to worship him and so listen god is able to deliver us we're going to step into the fire god's able to deliver us but if he doesn't we're still not going to bow to your daniel that's the faith god wants to see there's only one direction those men were headed us right into that fire somebody say praise the lord somebody say praise the lord you haven't said it in quite a while i still can't get some of you to say it all right there's no place to retreat in god go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's tb go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward see that's what people they get in a habit they get bound by that addiction might be physical emotional a mind addiction and i believe i believe this is the faith to get you away from that the devil is speaking to people like that and telling you you can't ever give this up you've been doing this 20 years and you'll never give this up and that's where the faith comes in the devil if the devil says you can't give this up you go forward if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic you go forward amen the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward thus saith the lord and move on cry to the people can you say amen but the people then rebelled and said it had been better that we excuse me died down in egypt it had been better that we had our graves marked then from the hyenas and the vultures to pick up our bones in this wilderness why did you bring us out here after they had seen that god approve approved moses to be a servant and moses fretted with the people and the people fretted to moses and he said what must we do and go forward was the answer praise the lord you're looking for an answer from god it might end up being just go forward but lord i need more details than that you might get an answer from god go forward that was the answer because the holy spirit's always saying that go forward we go forward now they said we are out in this wilderness and the armies of pharaoh is approaching us they're encamped just behind us but moses knew to obey god and if god sends a representative and he anoints this representative and sends it into the world the people must obey that representative it's always been that way all down through the bible moses was called for the job god had said it in the word he would do it he promised that he would send such a thing in that day to deliver them and god did his part sent moses and the children of israel just because little stumbles and things come along to try them they failed to march with moses now isn't that just like today we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the holy spirit until the power of god thrills every person in there and the glory of god falls around and the signs and wonders take place less than a week satan is permitted to come into that congregation why does he do it god permits it and then the church begins to murmur and fall back you see what's happening now it's god testing his children when the glory of god is falling we have a service like we had sunday it's easy to serve the lord and worship in here can you say man but god doesn't allow it to stay that way because you have to be tested as a son will you stand upon the word when the testing time comes so he he allows satan he allowed pharaoh to be released with all of his chariots and start heading towards them because he's going to test their faith and god says he permits he sends satan he allows satan to come in the church after such glory satan is permitted to come into that congregation why does he do it god permits it and then the church begins to murmur fall back maybe it wasn't so that is where we fail that's the failing of the church regardless of what takes place it's god move forward amen he says it's so much better than i do it's god move forward it's either god or it's not god this message is either of god or it's not of god there's no in between i'm not talking about the outskirts and the cultists things like that this message by itself in its purity in its innocence it's either of god or as it isn't and you've got to settle that in your heart but if it's of god if it was sent from god then we take it and we move forward there's only one direction so i was thinking of something and praying about something here to to to go back and notice this uh certain pressure that comes in people that follow the message isn't it amazing here we have a message go forward go forward when we hit a tight spot when there's doubts arise we should go forward when there's doubts arise be looking for the voice of god to take you forward not back to what you had before isn't amazing that the message came to take us out of organized systems to christ the word and some people went back to denominations i i can't i can't process that in that mind i can understand somebody leaving and i know that's going back to the world but a very calling of god to come out of her my people come out of every organized system everything that's denominational to come out of it that's including if there's outskirts within our ranks that are denominational how many can say amen to that you got to come out of that you got to come out of that church and the quicker you do it the better if you look into all kinds of denominational ways and everything you got to come out of that and so when when we have god calling us out of systems and people go back to it it's amazing thing they're clearly that clearly can't be the voice of god to send you back to something that he called you out of it's satan's influence to take you backwards how many know satan has always taken us backwards satan's always taken us back to our past even today you might have had satan working on you to bring back a thought of something you did in the past satan's a a creature of defeat he he dwells in defeating people and depressing people and keeping one of the ways he doesn't is he reminds you of your past he gets you back thinking about it oh did god really forgive you of that did you really get that all taken care of and so he he the reason he keeps you in your past is because there's defeat in it there's no victory in that no victory in your past whatsoever there's no victory and so he is a creature that that keeps you dwelling on the past all the time to keep you defeated but when the holy spirit comes he says no i won't you're not going to stay in this state i'm leading you forward in your walk with me and to do that first to get over your past we're not going to talk about it we're not going to hash it over we're not going to have a seminar about your past you're going to accept the power of my blood that forgives you and cleanses you of every spot and stain that is in your life somebody ought to say praise the lord i'm going to send you a bleach from the blood of calvary and when you would completely accept it that bleach will take out every stain and send it back to its original woman what do i got to do you got to accept it you got to say lord you did that for me then i accept your blood tonight amen there's no complicating that's why he used that scenario in the message god in simplicity when he got to the end brother branham used that whole thing of the the the the ink he took the ink and he took the bleach and you got this whole tub of ink he said you pour that never mind it being in a piece of fabric a little spot an ink and a a a little a dot from an ink pen why can't i say these words a pen that has ink in it in a little piece no he's talking about a tub of ink he's talking about and he says now now he says you bring that bleach and he says you pour that in there it just obliterate obliterates help me out somebody tonight it's gone it's gone it's gone and he uses it in the message god in simplicity because he never wanted you to complicate and let satan reason with you about the blood no no it's simple when you accept if that's what he done for my past sin let the blood wash every bit of it away and let me be clean hallelujah let it wash everything from my past you see now you can't go forward in the lord until you accept that revelation and take that and once you're standing here and you do that then there's only one direction to go in your spiritual walk and that's forward hallelujah now you're free you're not going back to anything you're moving forward you're saying what's next lord i've been freed of all my habits and my my my sin and my dirtiness and my mind i believe i'm free of it by the blood of jesus christ what's next he said all right i'll show you what's next you're going to become a pillar in the house of god you're going to be a powerhouse with the holy spirit you're going to become i could never be a powerhouse who told you that he said i come to make you a pillar in the house of god [Applause] what's next lord go forward i don't know sunday if i was i made forward that way or this way sunday it might have been this way tonight it's this way this is forward what's next lord i'm going forward all right what's next take me lord take me deeper deeper than the deeper in love with you jesus hold me close in your embrace take me deeper here we go deeper than i've ever been before i just want to love you more and more long to be deeper in love sing it take me deeper deeper in love with you jesus hold me close in your embrace you want him to hold you close tonight take me deeper deeper than i've ever been before i just want to love you more and more how i long to be deeper in love oh let it be lord let it be take me in your arms lord you wash away these stains from my past then take me to know you deeper i love you so much lord i love you so much take me deeper lord take me to the next step what's next lord i'll go there with you because i trust you now oh his holy spirit's here tonight won't you just lift your hands and say lord take me deeper i love you so much lord take me deeper on to know you thank you lord hallelujah can you imagine he can take and wash all that habits and addictions drowned in the red sea tonight how many believe you can drown it in the red sea drowned in the bleach the blood of jesus christ and you watch your enemy destroyed my my mind hallelujah hallelujah let me let me finish here tonight thank you jesus hallelujah take me deeper deeper than i've ever been before jesus hold me close in your embrace lord take me deeper deeper than i've ever been before i just want to love you more and more how i long to be deeper in love i believe he heard our prayer tonight you know in our text as i just bring this to a close this evening and i got the prayer requests we're going to take those and others that you have i read the text in luke chapter 8 because it's such a similar situation with the disciples on the boat with jesus and i don't have to go very long at this many preachers have preached about it probably millions since jesus said this this incident happened but our text here is an example of where our faith is sometimes the disciples really were dependent on the first and second poll the people in our generation got really dependent on what god was doing in brother branham for him to say the prayer for him to see a vision about it and when you have that when you have someone that's used of the lord like that then we tend to become dependent on it all of us would do it if jesus were here tonight in his physical body and we know what he can do we would we would bring our burdens to him but we would want him to pray and maybe even see a vision if he could see a vision about what we need to do and all that's fine but remember now the first and second poll that's an attraction to bring us to something deeper and so they were so used to jesus doing things that now when they get in the boat and they go across and the storm comes up they're scared they do what they've been kind of conditioned to do and that's they've got to wake up the master they've got to talk to the master he's got to settle this for him and that's the issue sometimes under the third pole people are really uh tr under the second first example they're trying to really lean on that the problem is the problem is when he's gone then he can't lay hands on you when he's gone he can't see a vision for you so where are you gonna be if he's not there where are you at in the first and second poll if nobody's around well that's the time to go to the third poll is that he's already spoke in his word it is the opening of the word can you say amen and his spoken word and where the question is where is your faith in that word under the third poll we're really trying to see people go higher into adoption paradox why christ speak even earlier even earlier in brother brahma's ministry we see that he referred the people he says if i don't get to lay hands on you he said you have your pastor pray you have your pastor lay your hands on you over and over again he said it because why he was trying to get the people in the mold it doesn't have to be me it doesn't have to be me to see a vision god is still here even when i'm gone can you say amen my wife looked it up one time years and years ago you wouldn't believe the hundreds of places he says have your pastor pray for you have your pastor lay hands on you and that's brother branham himself saying that because he knew he had to get the people to lift their faith even if there's no one there to lay hands on you where is your faith can you say amen where is your faith amen and so now of course they ran to him on the boat and woke him up and said master what are we going to do in this situation and he said to his disciples where is i'm going to word it this way where is your faith amen i know i have faith in the speak to the storm but where's your faith when we hit a test he's asking us where's your faith then they didn't even get it and they said jesus said where is your faith and they said hey brothers what kind of man are we around here this is amazing what manner of man of this that can speak he reaches out to the edge of the boat said peace be still and the storm just goes away jesus said where's your faith and they said brothers did you just see that this is an amazing man i feel privileged to be around this man hello did you get the question he just asked you completely went over it because they were so used to being around the man and him doing it but he's trying to get them where's your faith i won't be here forever you need the holy ghost and you need faith in the word yourself because you're going to hit some storms and greater is he that is in you that he's in the world though i will be with you even in you till the end of that i will be with you if i go away i'll come again through the holy ghost and live in you praise me to god so where is your faith and they said what manner of this man is this that we're around that can speak to the storm completely missed what jesus was trying to teach and so i want to end on this the key to all of this the key to everything in this text is that once the word has been spoken once the third poll the opening of the word has happened and i said it sunday when the breaking forth of the the voices of the thunders and the utterances when when god descended and began to break this voice of god out to the people there's no stopping it there's no going back there's nothing satan can do to stop it it's been launched out into the earth we're living under that friends we're living under these voices and the cry of this christ who said he cried with a loud voice we're living underneath that and satan can't do anything about it this bride is headed to a rapture no matter what satan does because his voice has already spoken it so the key to this is the third pope the opening of the word once that has happened then we re-speak what he said and we go forward why because it's all ready done it's already done so when they i'm ending pretty good ten after eight i'm gonna end we'll take our prayer requests so when they're by the shore and they're all sitting there talking and jesus says let's get in the boat and let's go over to the other side listen okay let's do what he says get in the boat okay you don't realize the third pole had been spoken from their lord you get it once they got in that boat according to what he said they were going all the way over to the other side and i don't care if 10 katrina's hit 50 itas tornados i don't care what hit that ocean or sea of galilee it didn't matter because that tends to get a lot of storms i don't care what hit they were going to survive because isn't it nice that jesus said let us go over he didn't say a few of us are going to make it over i love it he included everybody in the boat can you say man all that i'll make you smile tonight he included everybody and he says let us go over to the other side so when the storm come i'm just asking you how do you think the disciples should have reacted when the storm come crying fear wake up the master no they should have been said but wait brothers wait wait wait settle down here settle down didn't jesus say when we're on the shore let us go over to the other side and that should have been it let the storms rage because we be going over to the other side amen amen hallelujah [Applause] they just needed to re-speak it and they reached that's what they should have done just re-speak it and go forward can you say amen this going beyond crying beyond crying to speaking you know babies eleanor's at that stage she did it today she did a few hours ago at the house ellie wanted something and she what does she do it's not crying it's just like a fussy and she's learning how to talk but it's just got to be to get something it's like [Music] and it's her mom or nana corrected her today again say you know just what what do you want that's not the way and that's the way she tries to get some and we have tolerance for that because that's babies but if they were doing that at 10 years old there's an issue they're hungry and they come into the kitchen at 10 and go i might do that to my wife i don't know we've got to get out of babyhood where you cry for everything and you grow up and speak god's language as an adult oh god it's the end of the world grow up why cry stand true footed i'm gonna speak his word we're going to see an end to this someday
