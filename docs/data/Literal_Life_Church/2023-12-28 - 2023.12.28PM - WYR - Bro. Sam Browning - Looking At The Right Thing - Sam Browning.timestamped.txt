[44:00] get carried
[44:02] away all right she'll be around after
[44:06] service we're thankful to be here good
[44:09] to be here at Retreat 2023 and uh been
[44:13] an honor uh to have served over the last
[44:16] 31 years doing
[44:18] Retreat and uh brother Paul and I have
[44:21] been doing this a long time a really
[44:23] long time as a matter of fact now when
[44:26] we look at facilities to hold a camp we
[44:28] look at you know how nice it a
[44:30] wheelchair ramps I mean we want to we
[44:32] kind of want to know those
[44:34] things we have had um you know
[44:37] generations of kids actually come uh to
[44:40] retreat over the years and now we even
[44:42] have grandchildren of early Retreat
[44:45] members that's how old brother Paul is
[44:49] and it's it's just a a thrill to see
[44:51] that over the years and I think one of
[44:53] the uh one of the positive things that
[44:55] have uh that has uh brought the blessing
[44:58] of God upon this meeting is uh you know
[45:01] it's it's different it's diverse uh look
[45:04] around and we have a diverse group come
[45:07] from all kinds of different churches and
[45:09] all kinds of different backgrounds but
[45:10] that don't matter very much and uh we
[45:13] try to do things uh you know a little
[45:15] bit differently and have uh sessions
[45:18] where we teach and and talk about
[45:20] practical things and things right where
[45:22] you are at your stage in life and uh
[45:25] then have one ful ministers who uh
[45:27] minister in uh evening services and it
[45:30] it's just been a blessing over the years
[45:33] uh but I want to say just at the outset
[45:35] here I thank you for praying for uh I
[45:37] think it was mentioned this morning the
[45:39] reason I was not here last night this
[45:40] morning is that my grandson Henry I was
[45:43] 10 years old he was in the hospital and
[45:45] had surgery uh this morning I was able
[45:47] to go down early and be with him before
[45:49] he went into surgery uh first time and
[45:52] he asked me before he went in because he
[45:54] was kind of nervous and he said BBY he
[45:56] said have you ever had anesthetic and I
[45:58] said oh yeah every chance I get and he
[46:01] said he said what's it like I said oh
[46:03] man that's the best part of having
[46:05] surgery I said you just try real hard to
[46:08] count to 10 when they when they give you
[46:09] that anesthetic I said if you can count
[46:12] to 10 I'll give you 10 cents I said you
[46:16] won't be able to do it and I said they
[46:17] you'll be asleep during the whole thing
[46:19] and so he came through fine and we're
[46:21] thankful for that he's home and
[46:23] recovering and we're very thankful for
[46:25] that so we appreciate that sister Becky
[46:27] is with him tonight so she's not here
[46:30] and uh she wanted to spend as much time
[46:32] as she could with Henry and Lord willing
[46:34] if possible she may come tomorrow uh and
[46:36] be here for the afternoon the banquet so
[46:39] uh we'll we'll just see whether she gets
[46:42] to make it or not I wanted to say this
[46:44] about Retreat I I'm I assume you've
[46:46] probably heard the rules
[46:48] right yeah Riot Act and uh and the one
[46:53] thing I like to reiterate is you know
[46:54] you don't want to wander off a night cuz
[46:56] it's dark and there's not many things
[46:58] will hurt you but bears bears will kill
[47:00] you so don't wor don't mess with the
[47:01] bears but I think it's really important
[47:04] for all of us to to use the retreat as a
[47:08] retreat and use it as a time where you
[47:11] know you kind of step back from uh the
[47:14] Mad pace of things and hey our world is
[47:16] going nuts our world is changing it's
[47:19] different than it was last year and uh
[47:22] you know there's several major trips
[47:24] this year one to Israel that we're
[47:25] supposed to do in November and one in
[47:27] Africa and December and you know things
[47:30] getting cancelled and and there's less
[47:33] less movement it's less safe to travel
[47:36] and it's because our world's falling
[47:37] apart and so things are different and
[47:39] it's really nice to take time in
[47:42] meetings like this to retreat and just
[47:44] step away a little bit from the
[47:46] maddening pace and all the demands that
[47:48] you have in life and just spend that
[47:50] time not only with your friends and
[47:52] Associates but spend that time alone
[47:54] with God and this is one of those
[47:56] meetings where you can do that and we
[47:58] like to build in time for you to do that
[48:00] come early before service or linger a
[48:02] little bit afterwards uh we have great U
[48:05] ministers here you can talk with if
[48:07] there's a need and use it as a retreat
[48:10] don't don't just uh don't just get drawn
[48:13] into the pace of things use it as a time
[48:15] where you can just step back from uh
[48:18] from ordinary things and and just have
[48:20] that communion with God and that's a
[48:23] that's a uh a rare opportunity these
[48:25] days because uh there's not many times
[48:27] through the year when we're able to do
[48:29] that so it's it's really nice to take
[48:31] advantage of that this is always a
[48:33] special time of year for me because uh
[48:35] December 23rd I celebrated my 44th year
[48:38] of being a Christian and December 23rd
[48:41] 1979 I gave my heart to the Lord I was
[48:43] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:44] Christ in December outside and it was
[48:47] cold and uh I my my only regret after
[48:51] all of these 44 years my only regret and
[48:53] I have one is that I didn't do it early
[48:55] earlier I would have loved to have done
[48:57] it earlier and gotten a few more years
[48:58] in uh because now that I'm
[49:01] 45 you know it's that's a bit of a
[49:05] regret but I will tell you this it's
[49:08] I've enjoyed every moment of it I'd do
[49:10] it all again if I could and wouldn't
[49:12] hesitate and uh it's been it's been a
[49:15] wonderful Journey wonderful experience
[49:17] and so we welcome all of you here and uh
[49:21] it's just U an honor to have you with us
[49:23] and to be able to enjoy what we're going
[49:25] to go through over this uh weekend here
[49:29] but without any further Ado we're going
[49:31] to invite brother Sam to come and 10
[49:34] years ago we invited Brother Sam to come
[49:35] for the first time and he ministered
[49:37] here for us and it was just a real
[49:38] blessing just a fit just a real fit and
[49:41] he ministered so well to the young
[49:42] people we thought wow what a great
[49:44] resource to have and um we we want to

[50:10] street and have him speak to my heart

[50:14] asking for that specifically and that's
[50:17] what you should do Hey Brother brandom

[57:39] amen amen well if you'll turn with me
[57:42] let's go back to the Book of
[57:44] Jonah and U I want to say it is an honor
[57:48] to stand here and the confidence I I
[57:51] don't take that lightly that brother
[57:53] Paul and brother Barry would would would
[57:54] ask us to stand here and brother Paul
[57:56] and brother Barry I i' certainly they
[57:59] certainly are are pillars in my life and
[58:03] have certainly been instrumentally used
[58:05] of the Lord and just so appreciate the
[58:08] the friendship and and the
[58:13] confidence Jonah chapter 2 and um if you
[58:16] bear with me here I just want to read um
[58:19] just a few verses of scripture
[58:21] here and we'll just start right there
[58:23] with verse one
[58:27] the Bible said then Jonah prayed unto
[58:30] the Lord his God out of the fish's
[58:34] belly and said I cried by reason of mine
[58:38] Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me
[58:43] out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[58:47] thou heardest my voice for thou had us
[58:50] cast me into the deep in the midst of
[58:53] the Seas
[58:55] and the floods compassed me about all
[58:58] thy Billows and thy waves passed over me
[59:03] then I said I am cast out of thy
[59:08] sight yet I will look again toward thy
[59:13] Holy Temple the waters compassed me
[59:16] about even to the soul the depth closed
[59:20] me round about the weeds were wrapped
[59:24] around
[59:25] or about my head I went down to the
[59:28] bottoms of the mountains the Earth with
[59:31] her bars was about me forever yet hast
[59:35] thou brought up my life from corruption
[59:38] oh Lord my God when my soul fainteth
[59:41] within me I remembered the Lord and my
[59:46] prayer came in unto thee into thine Holy
[59:49] Temple they that observe lying vanities
[59:54] for forsake their own
[59:57] Mercy going to read that one again they
[1:00:00] that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:00:04] their own Mercy if anyone had the poetic
[1:00:09] license to say this statement he
[1:00:13] did right they that observe look at
[1:00:18] focus on lying vanities forsake their
[1:00:22] own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee
[1:00:26] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[1:00:29] pay that that I have vowed salvation is
[1:00:33] of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the
[1:00:37] fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the
[1:00:41] dry land just like to take just a simple
[1:00:44] thought here tonight looking at the
[1:00:47] right thing looking at the right thing
[1:00:50] may God bless you bless the reading the
[1:00:53] word as you're being seated
[1:00:57] as we were looking at it last night that
[1:01:00] Jonah he was headed in
[1:01:04] the direction away from the presence of
[1:01:07] the Lord he didn't feel like
[1:01:10] that they would hear him him being a Jew
[1:01:13] the prophet said that in his
[1:01:16] thinking he looked at it and said I'm a
[1:01:18] Jew they're a gentile they'll never
[1:01:21] receive what I'm about to say but you
[1:01:24] you know anytime that God calls you and
[1:01:26] I to do something or even as God draws
[1:01:29] upon your heart as we looked at last
[1:01:31] night God is not looking at our human
[1:01:34] ability that's one of the greatest
[1:01:36] things that gets in our way time and
[1:01:39] time again it's something that we
[1:01:42] constantly have to deal with I I don't
[1:01:43] know about you but when when I was
[1:01:46] growing up my mom it was just in our
[1:01:48] country house it was kind of a habit to
[1:01:49] have rugs when you came in the door and
[1:01:51] rugs around the kitchen but they weren't
[1:01:53] the kind of rugs that you could really
[1:01:55] wipe your feet on they were meant to
[1:01:57] collect dirt but you know you ever had
[1:01:59] one of those rugs you go to wipe your
[1:02:00] feet on it and it seems like it wants to
[1:02:02] follow you all the way through the place
[1:02:06] sometimes there's things that when we
[1:02:08] look at it there that in our life that
[1:02:10] what God has has called us to do and it
[1:02:13] seems like that well I I just don't
[1:02:15] think that this will happen I I don't
[1:02:17] think that this will come in this way
[1:02:19] but it's always that human ability and
[1:02:20] human ability is much like that rug I
[1:02:23] described we've constantly have to
[1:02:25] master the thought of human ability in
[1:02:28] our lives and it's things that even in
[1:02:31] your coming to serve the Lord It's
[1:02:33] mastering that thought of ability it's
[1:02:35] not about what you can do you and
[1:02:37] yourself can never perfect yourself you
[1:02:40] can never live in your own self a
[1:02:43] perfect life this is why we needed a
[1:02:45] perfect sacrifice that his life could be
[1:02:48] offered up that that perfect life could
[1:02:50] be released to you and I and then
[1:02:53] Perfection would be begin on the inside
[1:02:56] and work its way to the outside
[1:02:58] ultimately with the change of our body
[1:03:01] God has made a way for that so even when
[1:03:04] God has come to do a full work in your
[1:03:07] life uh where he's changed your very
[1:03:10] desires changed your nature yet you
[1:03:13] realize of the imperfection that lays
[1:03:16] around you but there's a perfection in
[1:03:18] your life of God's desire that's working
[1:03:20] and and that's where you're drawing your
[1:03:22] strength from when you're facing the ch
[1:03:24] challenges and what you're called to do
[1:03:26] the responsibilities things that you're
[1:03:28] to face up to and it's always something
[1:03:31] that uh is always so much uh right
[1:03:35] around us and uh when we look at this of
[1:03:38] the thought of looking at looking at the
[1:03:40] right things I think it's very important
[1:03:43] that we are looking at the right things
[1:03:46] uh because we can look at a lot of
[1:03:48] things that might seem factual they
[1:03:51] might seem very uh truthful but remember
[1:03:54] what what Paul wrote to you and I the
[1:03:56] things that we're to think on are not
[1:03:58] just things are just true it's not just
[1:04:01] it's not it's not that's not the only
[1:04:03] attribute with it but it has to have
[1:04:05] virtue in it it has to have praise in it
[1:04:09] it has to be of a good report all of
[1:04:11] these things are are Avenues or things
[1:04:14] for you and I to look and to judge
[1:04:16] everything by I tell you I I just
[1:04:19] thought when brother rap was ministering
[1:04:21] there this morning I thought well we
[1:04:22] might as well just go ahead and say all
[1:04:24] right for the night's service but uh you
[1:04:27] know when you look at at these things
[1:04:30] how God come and turn Jonah's Direction
[1:04:32] around and I believe right here even
[1:04:35] tonight or even last night how God has
[1:04:37] come by our way there's direction that
[1:04:39] God has turned in your heart from where
[1:04:41] you looking at something as maybe an
[1:04:44] impossibility or this cannot be and God
[1:04:47] just breathing upon your life to where
[1:04:50] there there Comes A A refreshing there
[1:04:52] comes a strengthening there is coming
[1:04:54] before you a fresh Vision to where you
[1:04:57] are not looking upon yourself as a
[1:05:00] defeated subject but you begin to see
[1:05:03] there indeed is victory for me that I
[1:05:06] can be a partaker of and so when I I
[1:05:09] look at this of how that God even of
[1:05:12] things that you know we've we've had
[1:05:14] things in our life that didn't turn out
[1:05:16] the way we thought it was going to turn
[1:05:17] out and sometimes when things are don't
[1:05:20] turn out the way we've got it figured
[1:05:22] out well you know sometimes we get
[1:05:24] disappointed and you know it's we we
[1:05:26] need to be uh strengthened and and
[1:05:28] encouraged and I think about the
[1:05:30] disciples they were walking on the road
[1:05:32] to emus and my they you know their whole
[1:05:35] thing was we thought that he should have
[1:05:37] been the one and indeed he was but it
[1:05:40] just it it wasn't they didn't have it
[1:05:42] figured out the way that God had already
[1:05:45] had it laid out in the scripture and
[1:05:48] sometimes the way that we figure things
[1:05:50] out can lead to that moment or a time of
[1:05:53] discouragement it's just like you know
[1:05:55] here you come to a camp and maybe this
[1:05:57] is your second third Camp of the year or
[1:06:00] whatever more and there's things that
[1:06:02] you have expected and no doubt God has
[1:06:04] dealt with your heart drawn upon your
[1:06:06] heart and you said maybe you came to the
[1:06:08] altar maybe you were right there in your
[1:06:10] seat maybe you prayed with a counselor
[1:06:12] and you looked and you thought I I I
[1:06:14] just I I believe it's settled right now
[1:06:16] or I believe there's things you know
[1:06:17] that I'll never have any problems
[1:06:19] anymore I'll never have any issues and
[1:06:21] then you find out there's still
[1:06:23] struggles there's still battle and then
[1:06:25] if you're not careful you'll walk away
[1:06:28] in a moment of discouragement but just
[1:06:30] because it didn't happen the way you
[1:06:33] thought it ought to happen does not mean
[1:06:36] that you're to throw away any experience
[1:06:40] that you ever receive from God every
[1:06:43] experience from God is just that it's
[1:06:46] god making known his love and his care
[1:06:49] God does not waste his time giving you
[1:06:52] an
[1:06:53] experience
[1:06:54] you might say well brother Samuel I know
[1:06:56] that I haven't had the depth of
[1:06:58] experience in my life well don't throw
[1:07:00] away all those other experiences because
[1:07:02] remember the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:05] is more of the same Spirit coming into
[1:07:10] your life the prophet would say it in
[1:07:12] another way it's more of the same Grace
[1:07:15] it's God going deeper in our
[1:07:22] lives and he will do that as we will
[1:07:26] allow him and invite
[1:07:30] him you know the Bible says it like this
[1:07:33] God resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[1:07:36] to the humble goes on to say humble
[1:07:39] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[1:07:41] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[1:07:46] time casting all your care upon him for
[1:07:49] he carth for you like how the prophet
[1:07:52] when brother Brandon would take this in
[1:07:54] the in the message you know preaching he
[1:07:57] cares do you he's brother Brown when he
[1:07:59] preaches this message you see let me
[1:08:01] just let me just take my time here just
[1:08:03] a moment when I'm looking here at the
[1:08:05] message and I I look at the scope of
[1:08:07] things when the prophet after the
[1:08:08] opening of the seals he's seeing a
[1:08:11] condition among the people where he says
[1:08:13] it seems like he says if if the message
[1:08:16] would have come like this in method in
[1:08:18] in in Luther's day or Wesley's day he
[1:08:20] said they just took what they had and
[1:08:22] went with and he says it it kind it
[1:08:24] seems like we just sit around and we
[1:08:26] have a thought and say wonder if it
[1:08:27] could be me wonder if it could be
[1:08:29] talking about me and brother bramy takes
[1:08:31] that in the message prisoner and he says
[1:08:33] now the Lord has given me something to
[1:08:36] address that and he preaches the
[1:08:38] following Sunday he cares do you care
[1:08:43] and brother Brion would take that now
[1:08:45] he's already preached he carth for you
[1:08:47] along the same thought line back in 1960
[1:08:49] but here he is ministering this and let
[1:08:52] me just say this to you this message is
[1:08:54] not the ideas of William
[1:08:57] brandham it's not William branham's
[1:09:00] thoughts it's clearly expressed brother
[1:09:02] B says it this is the expressed thoughts
[1:09:05] of Jehovah and I want to remind you what
[1:09:08] God thought of you before there was atom
[1:09:11] Stardust or molecule he hasn't changed
[1:09:14] his mind there's nothing you've done
[1:09:16] that's changed his mind God always has
[1:09:19] his thought and his thought it might be
[1:09:21] beneath Darkness it might be beneath
[1:09:24] failure but his thought is still his
[1:09:27] thought it's Eternal and God always
[1:09:30] harvests his
[1:09:33] word you can spray paint it you can
[1:09:36] graffiti it you can put everything else
[1:09:38] over it but you cannot destroy the word
[1:09:41] of God heavens and earth will pass away
[1:09:44] but my word shall never pass
[1:09:47] away
[1:09:51] Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about
[1:09:54] where Satan would try to take even in my
[1:09:57] life raised raised right in a church my
[1:09:59] daddy a pastor and even of things that
[1:10:01] was taking place in my life in
[1:10:04] circumstances and places that I would
[1:10:07] not even want to address here or call
[1:10:09] out but I could finish
[1:10:12] quotes when I was half out of my mind
[1:10:15] how did I do that because I've heard
[1:10:17] them but what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:10:19] is that it had to be something deeper
[1:10:22] than just kn the message it had to be
[1:10:25] something deeper than just hearing about
[1:10:27] it let me tell you we're not here under
[1:10:29] an affiliation we're not here just to
[1:10:32] associate around the message we're here
[1:10:35] to get into the message we're here to
[1:10:38] get into the word of God and let the
[1:10:40] word of God so saturate our lives and
[1:10:43] change us and bring out of us what God
[1:10:46] intended for you and I to be that's the
[1:10:49] purpose of God calling us together
[1:10:51] that's the burden when God give a
[1:10:53] burdens brother Barry said 31 years ago
[1:10:56] that burden did not come just from
[1:10:58] origination of of Brethren sitting down
[1:11:01] and hammering things out that burden
[1:11:03] came from almighty God to put it in
[1:11:06] their hearts that you and I might be
[1:11:08] benefited from this
[1:11:11] word oh how God cares and the prophet
[1:11:14] would bring it down in this message and
[1:11:16] speak to you and I showing us God's care
[1:11:19] you know it's one thing for somebody to
[1:11:20] tell you I care about you or I love you
[1:11:24] but this is why when God said don't just
[1:11:26] let it be in word or deed God manifested
[1:11:29] his love toward us he expressed his love
[1:11:32] and not just has or in the past but he
[1:11:36] has made known to you and I not by going
[1:11:38] to Calvary again but by opening up that
[1:11:42] way that had been veiled off from man
[1:11:45] and making himself known to you that the
[1:11:48] same almighty God that came down and
[1:11:50] walked the shores of Galilee has been
[1:11:53] revealed again in this end time and he's
[1:11:55] made himself known to you and I and
[1:11:58] dealing with your heart as though you're
[1:12:00] the only one setting in this room and
[1:12:03] your thoughts are on that screen only
[1:12:05] God can do
[1:12:07] that and he does it not to shame us he
[1:12:10] does it to let us know he cares about us
[1:12:13] I know
[1:12:15] you and if he cares so much for that I
[1:12:19] think we should
[1:12:20] care if he cared enough to vindicate
[1:12:23] this
[1:12:24] word I think we should
[1:12:27] care brother Bram said it like this he
[1:12:30] made a way that we might care I that
[1:12:33] that statement to me just sends me
[1:12:34] around the worlds he made a way that we
[1:12:38] might
[1:12:39] care if he hadn't made a way there's no
[1:12:42] way you could care but he made a way
[1:12:45] that we can sit here tonight and care
[1:12:48] about these things care about our life
[1:12:51] to take the word of God and let it be
[1:12:53] and reflect upon it in our life but
[1:12:55] here's how we care about it is we're got
[1:12:58] to be sincere about
[1:13:00] it to be sincere about the things be
[1:13:03] sincere about the word because he
[1:13:05] already cared enough to conquer every
[1:13:07] enemy for us let me just say it like
[1:13:10] this me just let me just kind of moving
[1:13:13] here into this thought of of Jonah and
[1:13:16] here the prophet would say it like this
[1:13:18] cuz I'm sure that in this room right
[1:13:21] here setting and gathered there's not
[1:13:23] one person in here that is free from
[1:13:26] failure and free from
[1:13:31] mistakes and that's one of the areas
[1:13:33] that Satan would like to trap you on
[1:13:36] before you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:13:38] and after you receive the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost because just because you've
[1:13:43] received the Holy Spirit this guy did
[1:13:45] not get born again out here I'm not
[1:13:47] making an excuse I know where I'm
[1:13:49] standing but God gives you strength that
[1:13:52] then what happens there's a growing on
[1:13:54] the inside the prophet said it's Christ
[1:13:57] in you pressing his way
[1:14:02] out now think about this brother BR said
[1:14:04] I got a lot of respects for a man when
[1:14:07] he does make a mistake he's got courage
[1:14:10] enough to rise and try again we're all
[1:14:13] going to make mistakes the best makes
[1:14:16] mistakes but a soldier is not one who
[1:14:19] will lay down when he's knocked down but
[1:14:22] will rise up
[1:14:23] again he said oh God In Prayer we're all
[1:14:26] guilty of doing things wrong we are
[1:14:28] gathered here tonight along with the
[1:14:30] rest of the great visible Body of Christ
[1:14:32] here on Earth may we rise and try again
[1:14:36] he goes on to say in another message and
[1:14:38] you you've heard this here here A Man
[1:14:40] shows up to get a job interview I think
[1:14:43] well how how arrogant he shows up with a
[1:14:45] pencil without an
[1:14:47] eraser I don't know about you but when I
[1:14:49] was in school I carried one of them
[1:14:51] separate erasers too you know them nice
[1:14:54] pink ones and then then we got some
[1:14:56] doodads that you know you could push out
[1:14:57] and they would come out like that and
[1:14:59] you could hold them I because the Eraser
[1:15:01] on the pencil wasn't
[1:15:03] enough I'm glad that God's given us more
[1:15:07] than
[1:15:09] enough this man showed up and Mr Ballard
[1:15:12] said you don't have no eraser Well I
[1:15:14] don't he said no he said I don't make
[1:15:16] any mistakes Mr Ballard said then I
[1:15:19] can't use you cuz you ain't going to do
[1:15:21] nothing if we don't make mistakes were
[1:15:23] not doing anything but what I like about
[1:15:26] a person listen to a Vindicated Prophet
[1:15:29] what I like about a person is that when
[1:15:31] you make a mistake a real Soldier is
[1:15:34] ready to rise and try
[1:15:38] again and another place any good soldier
[1:15:41] is apt to get wounded or
[1:15:45] hurt so sometimes it's a mistake failure
[1:15:48] sometimes it's a wound sometimes it's a
[1:15:51] hurt but what are we going to do do
[1:15:53] about
[1:15:54] it Lord let me rise and try again listen
[1:15:58] the greatest thing that we can do in the
[1:16:00] presence of God is just simply be honest
[1:16:03] Lord I need you let me rise and try
[1:16:05] again Lord I I want a fresh chance
[1:16:08] brother Samuel is he the god of Second
[1:16:09] Chances he's the god of third chances
[1:16:12] seventh chances 10th chances he's the
[1:16:15] god that gives you chance after chance
[1:16:17] after chance because he's not going to
[1:16:20] give up on his
[1:16:22] word
[1:16:24] you might say I've been in service after
[1:16:25] service and it seems like it keeps
[1:16:27] coming down my pathway that's God and
[1:16:30] God's letting you know he's not giving
[1:16:32] up on
[1:16:33] you he's not a man that he should lie
[1:16:36] neither the son of man that she should
[1:16:38] repent he did not make a mistake when he
[1:16:42] brought you here upon this
[1:16:45] Earth you're not an experiment to God
[1:16:48] you're here by
[1:16:51] Design God has work Illustrated it that
[1:16:54] you're here by
[1:16:56] Design now these things that we've just
[1:17:00] spoke about I say let's be
[1:17:04] Godlike let's be Godlike because when
[1:17:07] the fall took place in Eden God didn't
[1:17:10] just W it up and
[1:17:12] say that was a nice
[1:17:15] try but he came down and you know what
[1:17:18] he didn't even send an
[1:17:20] angel he came himself
[1:17:23] let me tell you he comes right to your
[1:17:26] life comes right to where you're at he
[1:17:28] don't send somebody else he comes to
[1:17:30] where you're
[1:17:31] at Jonah was here in the belly of a well
[1:17:35] but like we read last night whether
[1:17:37] shall I flee from thy presence oh God
[1:17:40] God was right there everywhere that he
[1:17:44] turned God was right there in the boat
[1:17:46] in the ship and that's why the prophet
[1:17:48] could say until you face responsibility
[1:17:51] you will be missed
[1:17:53] miserable brother Samuel why am I trying
[1:17:56] and failing let me just give you just a
[1:17:58] simple simple statement it's called
[1:18:01] surrender I don't say that demeaning
[1:18:04] only but I would say it in this way God
[1:18:07] help me to come to a full
[1:18:11] surrender help me Lord to lay down my
[1:18:13] will lay down my life Lord help me to
[1:18:17] come to that place Lord of surrender and
[1:18:19] to continue to
[1:18:21] surrender
[1:18:25] what brother rap was ministering on in
[1:18:27] the second service it may not have
[1:18:30] seemed very spiritual but you know many
[1:18:33] times it's the carnal things that we
[1:18:35] allow to get in the
[1:18:39] way jobs of the trustees at church not a
[1:18:42] real spiritual job but if they don't
[1:18:44] take care of the property watch out and
[1:18:46] make sure the light bills paid make sure
[1:18:48] everything is set where you going to
[1:18:50] have church at so sometimes the things
[1:18:53] that we discount or say oh it's minor if
[1:18:57] God intended when you got the holy ghost
[1:19:00] that you no longer needed any teaching
[1:19:03] he wouldn't have put it in the word cuz
[1:19:05] he didn't put it in the word for
[1:19:07] unbelievers or make Believers he put it
[1:19:09] in the word for you and me who are
[1:19:13] believers order my steps in thy word oh
[1:19:19] lord well that was
[1:19:21] free
[1:19:23] Godlike
[1:19:25] courage I say we God need some get up in
[1:19:31] us watch this brother Bram said in the
[1:19:34] great sculptor when he saw the fall of
[1:19:36] his family the Masterpiece he wasn't
[1:19:38] willing to just leave it lay there face
[1:19:41] down in ruin he went to work immediately
[1:19:44] to build it up again he wasn't willing
[1:19:47] that it should perish lay there like
[1:19:49] that all the time because he is God and
[1:19:52] he will not be defeated he went to work
[1:19:56] immediately and be to build again until
[1:19:59] his own image a
[1:20:02] man so that word the word of God it's
[1:20:07] Unstoppable you can't hinder you can't
[1:20:09] stop the word of God the word of God
[1:20:12] will come to pass and is coming to pass
[1:20:16] do you realize we're sitting right here
[1:20:18] even when the wars themselves God will
[1:20:21] only allow encroachment of Wars to go so
[1:20:24] far to a certain place until why until
[1:20:28] every one of his children are sealed
[1:20:31] into the
[1:20:33] kingdom even in armer day they still
[1:20:36] don't understand how did that war get
[1:20:38] stopped 11th month 11th day 11th Hour
[1:20:42] still don't know I tell you it was
[1:20:44] because you and
[1:20:45] me you and I we were not on the scene
[1:20:49] yet but God in his grace and mercy saw
[1:20:52] us our names were in the Lamb's Book of
[1:20:54] Life God was mindful that you and I
[1:20:56] would be in a service like this tonight
[1:20:58] he knew you would be here Desiring his
[1:21:00] Mercy Desiring the Holy Ghost Desiring
[1:21:03] deliverance and he made a way that you
[1:21:06] could receive what The Thirst is longing
[1:21:09] for in your
[1:21:13] life I don't care how much when you've
[1:21:16] one walked away or whatever that you've
[1:21:18] said you can't get away from the plan
[1:21:21] and program of God God hunts you
[1:21:26] down all the failures all the mistakes
[1:21:29] of His prophets never stop the word of
[1:21:32] God when Moses failed and ran into the
[1:21:36] Wilderness God didn't throw in the town
[1:21:38] and think here this goes
[1:21:41] again I mean he already had Noah God
[1:21:44] didn't look at Abraham when he told the
[1:21:46] second line think come on
[1:21:49] man and you know as we said last night
[1:21:52] God
[1:21:54] didn't try to polish up people's lives
[1:21:57] he could have done it he could have
[1:21:58] edited and made it just so pristine but
[1:22:01] you and I would have looked at those
[1:22:03] lives and that's why the prophet could
[1:22:04] say he said I never could understand how
[1:22:07] Abraham being a prophet could do thing
[1:22:09] like that he said but then I got to
[1:22:11] understanding he that was done and God
[1:22:13] had it recorded that you and I might
[1:22:15] know the grace of almighty God all along
[1:22:19] our journey we need God's grace
[1:22:23] oh my now you see look how brother BR
[1:22:26] describes this with the Eagles I love
[1:22:28] this statement out of the message and
[1:22:30] Eagles teth her nest brother R says them
[1:22:32] little Eagles when they begin to fly
[1:22:34] look how Mama Eagle take them out there
[1:22:36] she will holler that that southern for
[1:22:40] speaking loudly she'll holler flop your
[1:22:43] wings children just keep flopping your
[1:22:46] little faith up and down you're high
[1:22:50] enough now that you won't hit the Earth
[1:22:52] you know what then what she does she
[1:22:54] darts out to one side to watch them she
[1:22:57] sails right around and here they are
[1:22:59] just exactly like a Pentecostal Revival
[1:23:01] Topsy turby one over another just
[1:23:03] flopping to all they can act they don't
[1:23:06] care they got supreme confidence in
[1:23:09] their mamy that's out there watching
[1:23:11] them did you hear what he said their
[1:23:13] their confidence is not in their wings
[1:23:16] their confidence is in their mother she
[1:23:19] wouldn't have taken them out there if
[1:23:21] she didn't have confidence in them God
[1:23:24] knows what's inside of you and when God
[1:23:27] has brought you here in this generation
[1:23:30] God has given a message to you God
[1:23:33] himself has confidence in his seed in
[1:23:36] his word that's in
[1:23:39] you brother Samuel but I failed that's
[1:23:42] not what God was looking
[1:23:44] at I love how brother brandom I don't
[1:23:46] know who brother Mike is one day we get
[1:23:48] to the other side Lord willing I'll meet
[1:23:49] him but question answer is 1959 brother
[1:23:52] br look over he said Thank of it brother
[1:23:53] Mike he said God chose us before the
[1:23:57] foundation of the world knowing every
[1:23:59] mistake we would ever
[1:24:05] make you should have some Elbow Room
[1:24:07] right
[1:24:09] now brother B said now how ought the
[1:24:12] church do if one of them little Eagles
[1:24:14] got out of balance she sweeps right down
[1:24:17] with them big wings picks him up bears
[1:24:20] him up into Grace uh
[1:24:23] again
[1:24:25] wow not giving up so it brings him right
[1:24:28] back up shakes him off again and let him
[1:24:31] start a new them Eagles has got
[1:24:34] confidence in their mother Supreme
[1:24:36] confidence that that mother will help
[1:24:38] them and bear them up again you'll bear
[1:24:41] them up on wings of an eagle and take
[1:24:43] them there shake them off and let them
[1:24:45] start
[1:24:46] again God's Got
[1:24:48] Confidence God is not one let's just put
[1:24:51] this straight
[1:24:53] God is not the one who rubs anyone's
[1:24:58] nose in the dirt for
[1:25:01] failing he's never been guilty of
[1:25:05] that God does not come to point out all
[1:25:09] your failures when his presence comes
[1:25:12] our failures are made known many times
[1:25:15] we already know our failures but when
[1:25:18] his presence come his presence is to
[1:25:20] draw us out into a place above our
[1:25:25] failures that we can see his grace
[1:25:27] coming to you and I and not looking at
[1:25:30] our failures as long as you look at your
[1:25:34] failures and your mistakes you're
[1:25:36] looking at the wrong
[1:25:41] thing let me just say this God's not a
[1:25:47] quitter oh he knew what he was getting
[1:25:49] himself into when he got a hold of my
[1:25:51] life God wouldn't like me when I get
[1:25:54] into a project and all of a sudden at
[1:25:56] home and I realize I really did need a
[1:25:59] plumber yeah I I needed one I was going
[1:26:03] to save a few dollars here brother W's
[1:26:06] budget
[1:26:08] sheet and you realize I've got myself
[1:26:11] into a bigger situation than what I can
[1:26:15] handle but God has never got himself
[1:26:19] into a situation that he's not bigger
[1:26:23] and greater that's why I like that song
[1:26:25] My God Is
[1:26:29] Bigger oh my think of this you know
[1:26:32] Jonah he was in the situation he was in
[1:26:36] you know maybe tonight the reason we're
[1:26:38] here maybe the situation you're in maybe
[1:26:40] you didn't do what God told you to do
[1:26:43] you know brother B will make a statement
[1:26:45] about choices and you know you think
[1:26:46] about a choice right here tonight but
[1:26:48] you know brother BR would take a
[1:26:50] statement and say the choice that you
[1:26:52] make tonight will affect where you'll be
[1:26:55] five years from
[1:26:56] now I mean you you see the difference is
[1:26:59] like we look at the the painting that of
[1:27:01] the Last Supper the man that was chosen
[1:27:04] to represent and and he painted of the
[1:27:06] Lord Jesus he used him just five years
[1:27:09] just a period of time I think I don't
[1:27:11] know if it was five years or just months
[1:27:13] down the road but then he needed
[1:27:15] somebody to paint as Judas it end up
[1:27:18] being the same person because of choices
[1:27:21] that individual made and the effect it
[1:27:24] had upon his
[1:27:26] life you see Satan himself he everything
[1:27:30] that he does every trap that he sets
[1:27:32] this is why he does it is to try to get
[1:27:35] you in a place of isolation you no
[1:27:38] longer want to be around your family you
[1:27:40] want to go hide in your bedroom you want
[1:27:43] to go isolate why it's condemnation and
[1:27:46] it's Satan that's trying to pin you in a
[1:27:49] corner and God's letting you know hey
[1:27:51] there is great for you there is Grace
[1:27:54] that is sufficient if we confess our
[1:27:56] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[1:27:59] us brother Samuel you don't know how
[1:28:00] many times I'm repentant get back up and
[1:28:04] repent
[1:28:06] again don't lay there get back
[1:28:11] up you're not a
[1:28:14] quitter I know I'm speaking to young men
[1:28:17] and young women tonight that maybe you
[1:28:19] are deliberating about coming to this
[1:28:21] Camp you already paid your fees but
[1:28:23] maybe you've deliberated about it but
[1:28:25] there's something in you moving you
[1:28:27] that's greater than your own
[1:28:31] determination brother Samuel it sounds
[1:28:33] like you've got a lot of confidence in
[1:28:35] the word I do I've got a lot of
[1:28:37] confidence in almighty God it's God
[1:28:40] who's watching over his word it's God
[1:28:42] that's aligning
[1:28:45] things God when he comes he comes to
[1:28:49] minister
[1:28:50] love courage courage and
[1:28:55] ability he don't come to tear you down
[1:28:58] Brother Sam why are you saying this
[1:28:59] because I'm trying to help you to see
[1:29:02] God does not come in with thoughts in
[1:29:05] your mind to tear you down you'll never
[1:29:08] hear God where God has ever spoke to
[1:29:10] somebody in the scripture and called him
[1:29:12] a
[1:29:14] failure
[1:29:16] never even when the 10 spies God never
[1:29:19] even called them failures they believe
[1:29:22] that
[1:29:25] lie oh my think about it even
[1:29:29] within in Joshua and Moses God told God
[1:29:33] told Joshua he wanted him to know this
[1:29:35] there's no man going to be able to stand
[1:29:37] before thee all the days of thy life and
[1:29:39] as I was with Moses so will I be with
[1:29:41] thee I will not fail thee nor forsake
[1:29:45] thee B says it like this he says if I'm
[1:29:48] trying and I fail God won't leave me I
[1:29:51] don't have much confidence in anybody
[1:29:53] that's too afraid to do anything I'd
[1:29:57] rather be found a failure than too lazy
[1:30:00] to
[1:30:03] try let me just say this to you I put it
[1:30:06] in my own words and then I'll quote
[1:30:09] Churchill success is not permanent
[1:30:15] failure is
[1:30:18] temporary are you hearing me Brother Sam
[1:30:21] how does that how does that how does
[1:30:23] that relate well look when Israel went
[1:30:25] into the land they had to fight there
[1:30:28] was battles the Holy Ghost when the Holy
[1:30:31] Ghost has come I it's not come that we
[1:30:35] sit down in a nice recliner drink sweet
[1:30:38] tea and everything's finished you've
[1:30:40] been equipped for battle there's molding
[1:30:44] and shaping in your character there is
[1:30:47] possessions to be taken every moment of
[1:30:50] your life it's a it's a fight it's a
[1:30:52] battle but it's worth
[1:30:56] it they won it
[1:30:59] Jericho but right after Jericho they
[1:31:01] went to
[1:31:02] AI artificial intelligence I
[1:31:06] don't they went to AI but they carried a
[1:31:09] little something with them that was
[1:31:12] hidden a little wedge of gold a little
[1:31:16] patterning of the world of Babylonian G
[1:31:18] just a little patterning like the world
[1:31:21] brought
[1:31:22] feet and Joshua himself didn't throw up
[1:31:25] his hands and say my goodness I must
[1:31:27] have just been all blown up here I must
[1:31:30] just been out of my mind I I don't know
[1:31:32] what happened I mean we had one good one
[1:31:34] good campaign but he knew his confidence
[1:31:37] was in the word of God and listen your
[1:31:40] confidence my confidence has got to be
[1:31:43] in the word of God your confidence is
[1:31:45] not in your success it's not in your
[1:31:47] failure your confidence is in the word
[1:31:50] of God La those Little
[1:31:53] Eagles but God gave them a way back and
[1:31:56] so the success they had at Jericho like
[1:31:59] when you leave out of these meetings the
[1:32:01] success that you experience even in your
[1:32:04] daily life I know there's young people
[1:32:06] sitting right here that has that has
[1:32:09] completely surrendered your life and you
[1:32:11] know what I'm talking about as well
[1:32:13] everybody does where you can come out of
[1:32:15] having there such a successful moment a
[1:32:18] successful time and you know if you're
[1:32:19] not careful you'll let down your guard
[1:32:23] and the moment you let down your guard
[1:32:25] that's just what Satan was wanting and
[1:32:28] then you want to step back and look on
[1:32:30] and say well was was there something
[1:32:32] that that really took place did I really
[1:32:34] have success yes Jericho was a success
[1:32:38] but that is only something that it's not
[1:32:42] permanent you've got to keep walking
[1:32:44] with
[1:32:47] God Church Hill said it like this
[1:32:49] Success is Not final failure is not
[1:32:54] fatal I like that it's the courage to
[1:32:57] continue that
[1:32:59] counts I'm not lifting Churchill up but
[1:33:02] these are things that men have said even
[1:33:04] when Churchill would stand in a great
[1:33:07] time of
[1:33:11] War got to looking at this success and
[1:33:15] failure and
[1:33:17] mistakes talking about being knocked
[1:33:19] down I mean no one no one like to be
[1:33:22] knocked
[1:33:23] down remember as brother Bram I just
[1:33:25] read you some of these quotes it's it's
[1:33:27] it's not about if you just get knocked
[1:33:30] down do you get back
[1:33:32] up and there was a man one time when you
[1:33:35] just to look it up of who was knocked
[1:33:37] down the most like boxing who was
[1:33:39] knocked down the most back in 1909 there
[1:33:42] was a fighter by the name of Joe Janette
[1:33:45] who was knocked down 27 times in a
[1:33:49] match fought 40 9 rounds lasted three
[1:33:53] and 1 half
[1:33:55] hours longest match that's ever been he
[1:33:58] actually in one round was hit and it
[1:34:01] looked like he was going to be out for
[1:34:03] the count but he got back up eventually
[1:34:06] his opponent in the 49th round would not
[1:34:09] come out of his corner and said he'd had
[1:34:12] enough Joe Janette was knocked down 27
[1:34:15] times What mattered was is he got back
[1:34:20] up
[1:34:23] it ain't about how many times you've
[1:34:25] been knocked down get back
[1:34:29] up let's look at the right thing God
[1:34:32] given you and I strength to get back
[1:34:40] up let's just look at a few people
[1:34:43] Abraham
[1:34:44] Lincoln only one to go to a war as a
[1:34:47] captain and in the middle of that war
[1:34:50] going out to battle it comes back in
[1:34:52] from the Army demoted to a
[1:34:56] private woo that's real elevating for
[1:35:03] self-esteem Abraham Lincoln how many
[1:35:05] times did he fail running for political
[1:35:08] office multiple
[1:35:11] times and finally here he is standing as
[1:35:15] the President of the United
[1:35:17] States this is what he said my great
[1:35:20] concern is not whether you have failed
[1:35:23] but whether you are content with your
[1:35:27] failure Babe Ruth I know this is quoted
[1:35:30] a lot for the young sisters Babe Ruth
[1:35:33] was a chunky baseball
[1:35:39] player he's known for the home runs that
[1:35:41] he hit he hit 714 home
[1:35:46] runs but he struck out 1,330
[1:35:50] times the strikeouts is not what's
[1:35:53] highlighted it's the home
[1:35:57] runs brother Samuel I need some
[1:35:59] scripture when God got over into the New
[1:36:02] Testament he never recorded Abraham's
[1:36:07] failures you know why cuz it can't make
[1:36:10] it through the
[1:36:12] blood and when you confess your failures
[1:36:16] you've confessed your sin when you've
[1:36:18] confessed your mistakes even in the
[1:36:20] natural of life like even what brother
[1:36:23] rap was presenting him that second time
[1:36:26] when you confess it then God's grace
[1:36:29] moves down into your
[1:36:33] life and you know what it's not on
[1:36:38] record it's not on
[1:36:40] record Michael
[1:36:46] Jordan individual that basketball
[1:36:50] player
[1:36:53] won
[1:36:54] multiple
[1:36:56] Awards NBA championships I I'm just
[1:36:59] referring to a couple of these things
[1:37:01] but you know he didn't even make the
[1:37:04] varsity team when he tried out for in
[1:37:05] his sophomore
[1:37:10] year a man that has all these accolades
[1:37:13] but he didn't make it you know this is
[1:37:16] something that as I I go on to read
[1:37:18] about that this is what he said about it
[1:37:21] it was embarrassing not making the team
[1:37:24] he said he went home and he locked
[1:37:26] himself in his room and he
[1:37:28] cried then he picked himself up and
[1:37:30] turned the cut into a
[1:37:33] motivation whenever I was working out he
[1:37:35] said and I got tired and I figured I
[1:37:37] ought to stop I'd close my eyes and see
[1:37:39] that list in the locker room without my
[1:37:41] name on it that usually got me going
[1:37:46] again you see he wasn't looking at that
[1:37:49] list in a terms of defeat
[1:37:52] he had a confidence when he felt like
[1:37:55] giving up that's when he went the extra
[1:37:57] mile let me just tell you something
[1:37:59] right now there's times that you don't
[1:38:01] feel like praying but that's the times
[1:38:02] you got to press through there's times
[1:38:04] you don't feel like reading times you
[1:38:06] don't feel like going to church times
[1:38:08] you may not feel like sitting down and
[1:38:11] reading in the scriptures but let me
[1:38:12] tell you something don't let your
[1:38:14] feelings dictate your
[1:38:17] life we're living in an age where
[1:38:20] everything's about feelings well I felt
[1:38:23] this way or I felt this way your
[1:38:25] feelings will lie to
[1:38:28] you and it takes for us to press beyond
[1:38:32] that I say God give us Grace to press
[1:38:35] beyond our feelings all of
[1:38:39] us Walt Disney you brother Brown will
[1:38:42] quote this
[1:38:43] one I didn't say woke Disney I said Walt
[1:38:47] Disney this is old school this is not
[1:38:50] woke Disney Walt
[1:38:54] Disney he was fired from his job at a
[1:38:58] newspaper because they said he lacked
[1:39:00] imagination and had no good
[1:39:05] ideas imagine if he had believed
[1:39:10] that you know there was a man by the
[1:39:12] name of Einstein his daddy told him he
[1:39:15] wasn't
[1:39:17] smart there's no doubt there's been some
[1:39:19] things that you've heard or things
[1:39:21] that's been whispered your
[1:39:29] way but God comes to encourage
[1:39:33] you and let you know you don't have to
[1:39:35] dwell
[1:39:37] there that's not who you
[1:39:43] are he opens up an animation
[1:39:47] studio after a period of time it
[1:39:50] eventually goes banket
[1:39:52] R brother BR said how he kept on going
[1:39:55] he said but eventually he said now he
[1:39:57] said when he came to see that little
[1:39:59] mouse in the garage and he drew that
[1:40:01] little comic he said now he's a
[1:40:03] multi-millionaire this is what I want
[1:40:04] you to catch why why was that because he
[1:40:08] had something in his hand and he knew he
[1:40:12] held it he know he could do it and
[1:40:14] that's the way every great achievement
[1:40:17] is made when men and women have
[1:40:19] something in their hand that they know
[1:40:22] they can do
[1:40:24] it and you have something in your
[1:40:28] hand God encouraging you I I think if
[1:40:32] there's one thing that we should come to
[1:40:35] that resolve and ask God for his Mercy
[1:40:38] that the only quit that should be in US
[1:40:40] is I am going to quit letting Satan have
[1:40:43] any rule over any area of my
[1:40:48] life he listen the mind is no man's
[1:40:53] land it'll only be filled with what you
[1:40:56] or I allow it to be filled with
[1:40:58] sometimes you wonder why you feel in
[1:41:00] defeat you wonder why you don't have the
[1:41:02] strength you've got to look at what
[1:41:04] you've been feeding
[1:41:06] on if you don't look at the right things
[1:41:09] feed on the right things you realize if
[1:41:11] you don't feed your experience in you it
[1:41:14] will
[1:41:16] dwindle you've got to feed your
[1:41:18] experience on the word of God I'm sure
[1:41:21] every one of us in here there's times
[1:41:23] where there are things fixed that may
[1:41:25] not be your favorite
[1:41:27] meal I don't know that's how it was when
[1:41:30] I was growing up there's still certain
[1:41:32] things I mean my wife you know I meals
[1:41:35] are an important thing to me when I
[1:41:37] finish one I want to know what's coming
[1:41:39] for
[1:41:40] next why want to be under
[1:41:45] expectation motivation for the next
[1:41:48] meal but you know sometimes there
[1:41:50] there's things where I can look at and
[1:41:52] she'll say we're having soup now listen
[1:41:54] this is just me this ain't Doctrine it
[1:41:57] ain't nothing spiritual about this but
[1:41:58] just a
[1:41:59] point soup to me belongs with salad
[1:42:03] before the
[1:42:08] meal but I've learned to eat
[1:42:11] soup and so sometimes when it get I I
[1:42:14] listen I love winter time I like snow
[1:42:16] and things like that but there's one
[1:42:17] thing about wintertime that I'm not too
[1:42:19] fond of is soup
[1:42:25] now there's some soups that my wife has
[1:42:27] made that she she's really hit it there
[1:42:30] I I I like it a lot the zupa Tuscana all
[1:42:33] those my Lord I mean some of those
[1:42:35] things my I got to stay focused here
[1:42:37] there's some of those things right there
[1:42:39] that it's kind of helped me but you know
[1:42:40] what I'm trying to say is there's things
[1:42:42] about it that sometimes that maybe
[1:42:44] you're not rejoicing or I'm not
[1:42:46] rejoicing about man I'm really ready and
[1:42:48] going to sit down for dinner there's
[1:42:50] times in in your flesh and in your life
[1:42:53] that it might seem like when you're
[1:42:54] setting even in service what does this
[1:42:56] have to do for me where is this at in my
[1:42:59] life rather sit there and say God I'm
[1:43:02] going to press Beyond where my thoughts
[1:43:04] are at right now I'm not going to let my
[1:43:07] thoughts take me hostage and away from
[1:43:09] the house of God that I miss what you
[1:43:12] have for
[1:43:16] me hope we're not having souit
[1:43:19] tonight just easy every area of my life
[1:43:23] I'm going to quit looking at my failures
[1:43:25] and at my
[1:43:27] mistakes coming back to our text where
[1:43:30] Jonah said I'm cast out of thy sight but
[1:43:33] yet I will look again toward thy Holy
[1:43:36] Temple no matter the circumstances Jonah
[1:43:40] had a confidence in a
[1:43:42] word that Solomon had prayed under
[1:43:47] inspiration and he knew that was the
[1:43:49] word of God no matter the circumstance
[1:43:52] that he was in and he makes this
[1:43:54] statement which we read and we read from
[1:43:57] it twice in verse eight of Jonah 2 they
[1:44:01] that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:44:05] their own
[1:44:07] Mercy that word observe is to keep to
[1:44:10] guard to give heed
[1:44:13] to to watch over to treasure up in
[1:44:18] memory this is why the
[1:44:21] scripture when we can look at things as
[1:44:25] he's saying forsake those that observe
[1:44:29] lying van in other words give them time
[1:44:32] give them place like what brother rap
[1:44:34] was presenting here in the morning
[1:44:37] service there's things at times that are
[1:44:40] presented
[1:44:44] facts it might be a fact right here
[1:44:46] tonight that you're battling
[1:44:49] pornography it might be a fact in your
[1:44:52] life that there's things that you've
[1:44:54] battled from a
[1:44:56] childhood those are facts but it's not
[1:44:59] the
[1:45:01] truth they're lying
[1:45:05] vanities it's Satan's objective to
[1:45:08] however that trap was laid however those
[1:45:11] things got started even the stumblings
[1:45:13] that can be in your life and Satan wants
[1:45:16] you to observe that he would love to
[1:45:18] keep you just like brother rap gave that
[1:45:20] example tonight at the end of a service
[1:45:22] where there was something there that it
[1:45:24] seems like he didn't understand what was
[1:45:26] being said but he begin to look to the
[1:45:29] Holy Temple he begin to reflect on what
[1:45:32] God had done for his life I am saved I
[1:45:36] am filled with the Holy Ghost you see
[1:45:38] you've got to stand on your experience
[1:45:41] that God has given you in your
[1:45:45] life even your failures if you've Fallen
[1:45:48] if you trapped well I really thought I
[1:45:49] was delivered of this just because you
[1:45:52] have fallen and made a mistake doesn't
[1:45:55] mean that you weren't delivered I'm
[1:45:57] going to preach
[1:45:59] now it's still there's battles that's
[1:46:01] all around you you're still going to be
[1:46:03] tempted you're still going to be tested
[1:46:06] but just because you're tempted and
[1:46:08] because feelings want to sweep over you
[1:46:11] does not mean that you're not delivered
[1:46:13] but you've got to stand there submit
[1:46:16] yourself to God and resist the devil and
[1:46:19] he'll flee from from
[1:46:21] you that's your god-given
[1:46:27] word well brother Samuel I've heard it
[1:46:30] preach where you can't make no mistake
[1:46:32] I'm preaching the word of
[1:46:37] God and this right here while you live
[1:46:40] in this flesh you will have to
[1:46:42] continually bring it subject to the word
[1:46:45] of
[1:46:45] God this is why when it says in the word
[1:46:49] casting down
[1:46:53] imaginations remember what what are you
[1:46:55] doing look let me just read the
[1:46:56] scripture casting down imaginations and
[1:46:59] every High thing that exalteth itself
[1:47:02] against the knowledge of God and
[1:47:05] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:47:08] The Obedience of Christ and having in a
[1:47:11] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[1:47:15] when your obedience is
[1:47:16] fulfilled you see it comes back to what
[1:47:20] what's your
[1:47:21] desire what's your desire in your
[1:47:24] heart listen if your desire is still
[1:47:27] within for the things of the world then
[1:47:30] you need to invite God to go
[1:47:34] deeper you see you still you need to say
[1:47:37] God I want to go
[1:47:42] deeper say well brother Samuel sometimes
[1:47:44] you know well I have pools out here but
[1:47:46] I know what my desire is in here listen
[1:47:49] you have to bring everything things
[1:47:50] subject to the word of God if the desire
[1:47:53] in your heart is Lord I just want to
[1:47:55] please you Lord I love you you're
[1:47:58] standing upon that word you're bringing
[1:48:01] then it's to bring every thought that is
[1:48:03] coming into subjection to that on the
[1:48:08] inside brother Bram says he says here's
[1:48:10] here comes a man and he says he's
[1:48:13] walking down the street and somebody
[1:48:15] says he said you're singing a song and
[1:48:17] they say look at that Holy Roller
[1:48:19] brother Bram say says the first thing is
[1:48:21] the thought comes to your flesh get even
[1:48:24] with him then he says from the flesh it
[1:48:27] goes to the spirit your flesh and your
[1:48:29] spirit are not your
[1:48:31] buddies they're not your buddies then he
[1:48:34] said the spirit suggested to the soul
[1:48:37] let's get even with him but the soul
[1:48:39] will reain out and say vengeance is mine
[1:48:42] sayeth the
[1:48:43] Lord see that's why you want to make
[1:48:45] sure you're feeding that white dog you
[1:48:48] want to make sure that you're feeding
[1:48:49] your
[1:48:51] experience come on friends sometimes our
[1:48:53] failures and our mistakes is not any
[1:48:56] lack on God's part it's our part where
[1:49:00] we have failed to feed on the word of
[1:49:05] God brother B goes on with that same
[1:49:08] example talks about a woman going by all
[1:49:10] he moves with that example now I want
[1:49:13] you to think about this in the message
[1:49:14] voice of a sign brother BR says now
[1:49:17] here's what I want you to do he says I
[1:49:19] want you to take every unbelief you've
[1:49:22] got and every unreasonable thought and
[1:49:25] lay it down on the floor and put your
[1:49:28] foot on it and say Lord Jesus I'm going
[1:49:31] to believe
[1:49:32] you take every thought of unbelief every
[1:49:37] unreasonable thought and put it on the
[1:49:40] ground and put your foot on it and say
[1:49:43] Lord I'm going to
[1:49:49] believe that clip that brother rat
[1:49:51] showed there of that sister brother Paul
[1:49:55] came back around and was speaking what
[1:49:58] gave that validity or seemingly made it
[1:50:02] somewhat valid or something that that
[1:50:05] sister would even
[1:50:08] entertain see Satan wants to do it so
[1:50:11] that in a way you'll entertain it you'll
[1:50:13] entertain the
[1:50:15] thought that sister was not a witch but
[1:50:18] in her thinking she had entertained that
[1:50:21] thought that seemingly came from a
[1:50:24] credible
[1:50:27] source and that had affected her in her
[1:50:30] health in her body it had affected it it
[1:50:33] had there had been an effect through the
[1:50:35] whole church listen that's the same way
[1:50:37] that the enemy can come to you with your
[1:50:39] failures and your mistakes and want to
[1:50:42] present it as though this is who you
[1:50:45] are but that's not who you
[1:50:49] are failures and mistakes yeah there's a
[1:50:51] lot of facts if you could say like that
[1:50:54] the other other example brother rap was
[1:50:56] referring to when brother Bram stood by
[1:50:57] that bedside and how Satan came up next
[1:51:00] to him and he said you seen it on the
[1:51:02] screen this morning everything that he
[1:51:04] said was the
[1:51:07] truth reasoning everything that Satan
[1:51:10] had come right up there and said was the
[1:51:11] truth there's a lot of things that he
[1:51:14] said concerning you as far as you can
[1:51:16] say well he's right about that he's
[1:51:18] right about that I I've got a problem
[1:51:20] here or I've got an issue here but
[1:51:22] what's greater than that is the truth of
[1:51:25] God's word concerning your
[1:51:28] life facts mean nothing in the face of
[1:51:32] the truth of almighty God do you realize
[1:51:36] brother brandom said that the devil is
[1:51:38] nothing but a password to a man that'll
[1:51:41] stand and accept God's word you know a
[1:51:44] password is it's to keep you out of
[1:51:45] something I could give you my iPad and
[1:51:48] you could try and try and they probably
[1:51:50] lock it up we couldn't get into it why
[1:51:52] even though there is all sorts of
[1:51:54] contents in here messages and everything
[1:51:57] that I have but if you don't have the
[1:51:59] password you can't get into this right
[1:52:02] here and the prophet puts it in such
[1:52:04] simple terms that the Devil Himself is a
[1:52:10] password what opens that up is to
[1:52:14] accept what God has done for
[1:52:18] you to
[1:52:20] accepted the 10 spies you you know the
[1:52:23] story they looked at the Giants all they
[1:52:27] could see was Giants that's all they saw
[1:52:30] all they could talk about was Giants
[1:52:32] that's all that's it became their whole
[1:52:35] conversation all they could all they
[1:52:37] could see was this of the
[1:52:38] impossibilities but here came two men
[1:52:41] back that though they saw the Giants and
[1:52:44] let me just tell you something God
[1:52:45] didn't God didn't rebuke the 10 spies
[1:52:47] for them talking about Giants God's not
[1:52:49] asking us to pretend that we don't have
[1:52:51] problems he's not asking you to make
[1:52:53] believe well well I really don't have
[1:52:54] anything no that's not how it works but
[1:52:57] God's asking you when you see this
[1:52:59] recognize greater is he that is in you
[1:53:03] than he that's in the
[1:53:05] world is that right David and Goliath my
[1:53:09] goodness all Israel was was was afraid
[1:53:12] of Goliath they were looking and he was
[1:53:14] a champion he was a
[1:53:17] warrior but David chose to look at the
[1:53:21] right
[1:53:22] thing David said I'm circumcised he's
[1:53:26] uncircumcised I've got a covenant he
[1:53:29] don't have a
[1:53:30] covenant David looked at the right thing
[1:53:34] while the rest of them all they could
[1:53:35] see was his size me tell you the
[1:53:38] circumstances in your life right now the
[1:53:40] size may seem so overwhelming but just
[1:53:44] say God just release Lord a pulsation in
[1:53:47] My Heart Lord help me to see see it Lord
[1:53:50] as you see
[1:53:56] it let me just try to come here to the
[1:53:59] place of
[1:54:01] closing our
[1:54:04] symptoms REM says oh if we can get away
[1:54:07] from our symptoms they're lying
[1:54:11] vanities he said say to them I won't
[1:54:14] believe you anymore Jesus Christ has
[1:54:16] healed me when he died at Calvary you
[1:54:19] tell me I have to keep smoking
[1:54:21] cigarettes you can put whatever you want
[1:54:23] to put in there you tell me I have to
[1:54:25] keep smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey
[1:54:27] you're a liar I refuse to see it I look
[1:54:31] to your Holy Temple Lord where Jesus the
[1:54:33] son of God stands at the right end of
[1:54:35] the father making intercessions for me
[1:54:39] they're lying vanities don't receive
[1:54:44] them you realize when the Bible tells us
[1:54:48] of how important and Power powerful our
[1:54:50] confession
[1:54:52] is it says
[1:54:54] consider Jesus Christ the
[1:54:58] Apostle of our
[1:55:01] profession which is our confession
[1:55:04] consider the high priest and Apostle of
[1:55:06] our profession you realize how important
[1:55:08] it is to confess what God has done for
[1:55:11] you listen this is not mine it's not
[1:55:14] mind over matter brother B says if you
[1:55:16] can take a promise and you begin to take
[1:55:19] that promise he said and he says it even
[1:55:22] like this he says if all the further you
[1:55:24] can receive it is just mentally he said
[1:55:27] take it in your mind and begin to repeat
[1:55:30] it over and over say it out
[1:55:35] loud sometimes we we you see sometimes
[1:55:38] it's way we we want things in a certain
[1:55:40] way listen friends I believe with all my
[1:55:43] heart that God is here to do for you and
[1:55:46] I what we have need of I believe that I
[1:55:48] believe God is working all the way
[1:55:50] through in every one of these services
[1:55:53] and I believe with all my heart that
[1:55:55] when we look at this that we could have
[1:55:57] such an assurance that if maybe I don't
[1:56:00] see what I want to see right now but
[1:56:03] I've seen God's word and I'm going to
[1:56:05] stand on that word I'm going to confess
[1:56:08] it until it's made manifest in my life
[1:56:13] it works the same way with healing
[1:56:15] brother brand said it works the same way
[1:56:17] with salvation
[1:56:20] you confess it and he said you watch it
[1:56:22] work
[1:56:24] righteousness when God does something
[1:56:26] for you whether it's any devotion any
[1:56:29] session confess what God has done for
[1:56:32] you begin to thank him for what he's
[1:56:34] done for you when he's dropped a word
[1:56:37] your way and it's something that you
[1:56:38] know that man don't know nothing about
[1:56:41] me God knows me God knows about my
[1:56:43] circumstance take that word and begin to
[1:56:47] thank God for your healing thank God God
[1:56:49] for your
[1:56:51] deliverance brother Samuel I'm wanting
[1:56:53] the Holy Ghost thank God for the Holy
[1:56:55] Ghost it's a sure
[1:56:58] promise when they went back to Jerusalem
[1:57:01] they didn't go back sad the Bible said
[1:57:02] they went full of joy because they knew
[1:57:05] what God made a promise he would pour
[1:57:06] out the holy spirit that God indeed will
[1:57:08] fulfill his
[1:57:11] word every time this is why the prophet
[1:57:14] would say it over and over he says
[1:57:16] don't have a negative testimony
[1:57:20] it's a miracle in this age everything is
[1:57:24] negative everything I mean Medias all
[1:57:27] around us is all
[1:57:29] negative things flying thoughts will
[1:57:32] come in and you you and I cannot stop
[1:57:34] the thoughts from coming
[1:57:36] in but we can stop them from remaining
[1:57:41] there brother BR says when you begin to
[1:57:43] say I'm not a very good Christian I've
[1:57:47] got weak Faith he said you're talking
[1:57:49] talk in the devil's
[1:57:51] language when you begin to speak and to
[1:57:54] confess it that way then you're talking
[1:57:57] his language always have a positive
[1:58:01] confession I am saved I belong to the
[1:58:05] Lord the Holy Ghost is mine I'm a Child
[1:58:09] of
[1:58:16] God let me just let me just turn it here
[1:58:21] one point I want to come to
[1:58:24] here sometimes there's things
[1:58:28] that can be emotional
[1:58:32] bondage that looks very real and it is
[1:58:35] our
[1:58:37] feelings feelings are real then nobody
[1:58:40] nobody makes light of
[1:58:43] that from events and circumstances just
[1:58:45] like when we talked about sister Georgie
[1:58:49] Carter last night re gives an example of
[1:58:52] a
[1:58:54] sister how that she had been healed of
[1:58:57] heart trouble as a young
[1:59:00] lady and then brother Bram tells us she
[1:59:03] had a different kind of a heart trouble
[1:59:06] later on in her
[1:59:07] life and the Heart trouble that she had
[1:59:11] is it okay if I just read this
[1:59:14] part said last night she had a different
[1:59:16] type of a heart trouble it was a
[1:59:18] spiritual heart trouble her lover had
[1:59:21] run off and married some other woman and
[1:59:24] yet she was still in
[1:59:26] love this is how powerful that words
[1:59:32] are emotions and words that can be
[1:59:37] exchanged she was still in love and this
[1:59:39] boy was telling that he telling her that
[1:59:42] he was still in love with her and his
[1:59:44] father is what caused it to where that
[1:59:47] he got married to this other girl
[1:59:50] brother brandham
[1:59:52] said oh
[1:59:55] nonsense oh nonsense he didn't have to
[1:59:58] marry that other girl he did it because
[2:00:00] he failed to have the right kind of love
[2:00:02] for
[2:00:03] you but notice he says being all wound
[2:00:06] up into that the girl sat there in such
[2:00:09] a stoop oh Johnny loves me I know he
[2:00:13] does that's all she could
[2:00:18] see she lived in that one little world
[2:00:23] by
[2:00:24] herself she had formed
[2:00:27] herself in
[2:00:31] there the B said I took a hold of her
[2:00:33] hand and said listen to me the Lord
[2:00:35] showed a
[2:00:36] vision that she know I didn't know
[2:00:38] nothing about something had taken place
[2:00:42] some
[2:00:43] transaction between them and when that
[2:00:47] was said that snapped her right quick
[2:00:50] and I said while you're out from there
[2:00:54] look to
[2:00:57] Calvary says you're going out here and
[2:00:59] you're starting to drink what was she
[2:01:01] trying to do drowned
[2:01:04] it why it hurt emotional trying to drown
[2:01:10] it sometimes your drowning may not be
[2:01:12] drinking you might be trying to drown
[2:01:14] your failures in just now absorbing more
[2:01:18] and more and more and more
[2:01:23] content but you'll never find the peace
[2:01:27] and relief in
[2:01:29] that but there is a God I I don't know
[2:01:31] how I don't know what your situation is
[2:01:34] but there's a God just as he snapped out
[2:01:38] this young lady broke that spiritual
[2:01:40] Veil that she couldn't see out of that
[2:01:42] world that she was formed that had been
[2:01:44] formed around of her life but God in a
[2:01:47] moment revealed something that had taken
[2:01:50] place that she knew only the other
[2:01:54] person and it would have to be God that
[2:01:56] would know this it snapped her right out
[2:01:59] of it and at that moment the direction
[2:02:01] was look to
[2:02:06] Calvary I'd say right here
[2:02:09] tonight in these moments that we have
[2:02:12] where God's come
[2:02:15] by we're going to pray here in a moment
[2:02:17] but what God has come come by and would
[2:02:21] deliver his word and speak to our hearts
[2:02:24] to break that Veil maybe it's a veil of
[2:02:27] doubt maybe it's that Veil let me just
[2:02:30] tell you what it is it's a
[2:02:32] spirit but greater is he that's in you
[2:02:37] greater is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:02:40] that's Among Us than that Spirit or that
[2:02:44] Veil that would want to hold you
[2:02:46] back he's greater
[2:02:49] and he loves you and he cares about you
[2:02:53] and in that moment if you can just just
[2:02:55] look to him even to invite him to say
[2:02:58] Lord break this over my life Lord and
[2:03:02] invite him to come and let's look at the
[2:03:05] right
[2:03:06] thing let's let's invite him he's here
[2:03:11] he's here he's here to move for us he's
[2:03:13] here to do for us I friends listen there
[2:03:17] was just even a testimony was given to
[2:03:19] me here after the one of the other
[2:03:20] services of a sister that was here last
[2:03:23] night thought she was going to have to
[2:03:24] leave the service and go back to her
[2:03:26] room because of stomach condition and
[2:03:28] she said something was mentioned I don't
[2:03:30] I don't remember mentioning anything
[2:03:31] about stomach condition but something
[2:03:34] was said that it just something that God
[2:03:37] spoke that it resonated and it was
[2:03:40] gone I I can't help it but I walked away
[2:03:43] from here I said God there's if you
[2:03:45] cared about stomach conditions which he
[2:03:47] does God cares about whatever your need
[2:03:51] is I I believe there's been things
[2:03:54] dismissed right while the word's being
[2:03:56] preached I know
[2:03:59] that but as I stand here tonight I also
[2:04:01] know that if there's needs that's even
[2:04:04] where you feel in your heart that
[2:04:06] there's not a settledness I'd say this
[2:04:08] is an opportunity while you are away at
[2:04:10] a moment of retreat while God is giving
[2:04:13] you Grace to step away from the
[2:04:15] circumstance and the situation why God
[2:04:17] himself has breathed in courage for you
[2:04:19] to stand and say yes I will rise and try
[2:04:22] again I'm going to look even though I'm
[2:04:25] in this situation I will look again once
[2:04:28] again to thy Holy Temple oh
[2:04:31] god let's bow our
[2:04:35] heads Lord
[2:04:41] Jesus Lord just pieces Lord
[2:04:47] I
[2:04:51] Lord as we speak Lord
[2:04:54] and God it takes you to bring it
[2:04:57] together Lord in
[2:05:01] this thought here tonight a little
[2:05:05] thought Lord Jesus you're mindful of
[2:05:10] every need and every
[2:05:14] circumstance sometimes lord it's things
[2:05:16] that you come by our way to
[2:05:19] Lord to help us that we can
[2:05:23] see Lord our failures where we can see
[2:05:27] in a way that Lord where we need to be
[2:05:30] strengthened areas that maybe we've let
[2:05:33] down and we might wonder Lord why has
[2:05:36] this come about why has this
[2:05:40] happened Lord just how that you would
[2:05:42] bring it so simple sometimes it's the
[2:05:45] simple things that we neglect and we
[2:05:48] leave undone
[2:05:49] Lord sometimes Lord we can get to a
[2:05:53] place and just feel Lord the to a place
[2:05:57] of being
[2:05:59] overconfident then Lord we find
[2:06:01] ourselves Lord
[2:06:03] failing we find ourselves relying on our
[2:06:06] own human abilities and our own strength
[2:06:11] Lord that'll never do
[2:06:14] Lord you come to help us and to show us
[2:06:18] Lord to speak to us because you
[2:06:21] care Lord your desire Lord you have
[2:06:24] called us and ordained us to walk and
[2:06:26] live as Overcomers in this hour made us
[2:06:30] to be more than conquerors Lord
[2:06:34] strengthen us Lord that we can do all
[2:06:36] things through
[2:06:38] Christ Lord
[2:06:41] Jesus you know lord of the many needs
[2:06:44] that Lord have gathered here in this
[2:06:47] meeting sometimes Lord the the needs are
[2:06:52] well lord they're just like this little
[2:06:55] sister here Lord they
[2:06:57] were beneath the surface Lord in that
[2:07:00] emotional
[2:07:02] realm Lord so something so deep that
[2:07:05] Lord she couldn't get out of that world
[2:07:07] that she was in on her own but you sent
[2:07:10] a word to break that Veil
[2:07:13] Lord Lord I pray God here tonight Lord I
[2:07:17] believe Lord that you have moved Among
[2:07:19] Us Lord you've spoke to our
[2:07:22] hearts Lord I pray tonight God may you

[2:07:39] again no matter how many times they
[2:07:42] failed Lord wherever they're at in their
[2:07:45] Journey May Lord I pray they put their
[2:07:49] eyes on you Lord looking unto Jesus the

[2:29:13] right thing because there's all kinds of
[2:29:15] Temptations be looking at the wrong
[2:29:18] thing but you got to be looking at the
[2:29:20] right thing yes Lord nowhere in the
[2:29:22] Bible even does it say for you to look
[2:29:24] at yourself and judge things by yourself
[2:29:27] or looking at
[2:29:29] friends looking at other people and what
[2:29:31] they're doing you got to be looking at
[2:29:33] the right thing to me the only right
[2:29:35] thing that there is in this crazy world
[2:29:37] is God's word that's the only right
[2:29:40] thing there is and we got to be looking
[2:29:42] at that cuz that's the way God looks at
[2:29:45] you he looks at you through through the
[2:29:46] blood of Christ and he sees what he
[2:29:49] predestinated from before the foundation
[2:29:51] of the world he doesn't polish up our
[2:29:54] lives like Brother Sam said he doesn't
[2:29:56] Polish people up and then uh present
[2:29:59] them in scripture doesn't do that takes
[2:30:01] them just as they are takes them just in
[2:30:03] their rawness and in their natural way
[2:30:06] takes them and begins to use them and
[2:30:08] mold them and shape them for the glory
[2:30:10] of God that's what he does he made a
[2:30:14] way so that we would care
[2:30:17] yes Lord what a great statement he made
[2:30:18] a way that we would care yes as you
[2:30:21] wouldn't care less if God hadn't made a
[2:30:24] way for
[2:30:25] you we wouldn't be caring about how we
[2:30:28] measure up we wouldn't be caring about
[2:30:30] the things of God we wouldn't be caring
[2:30:32] about making 2024 a better year and
[2:30:36] drawing closer to God we wouldn't care
[2:30:38] about that at all we'd be caring about
[2:30:40] making money we'd be caring about our
[2:30:41] careers and we'd be caring about all
[2:30:43] kinds of other things but you know when
[2:30:45] you begin to look at the right thing
[2:30:46] long enough that right thing begins to
[2:30:49] affect your thinking about things and
[2:30:52] you realize that a whole lot of stuff in
[2:30:53] this life doesn't matter but what God
[2:30:56] said about you that's what matters and
[2:30:59] I'm thankful for how God sees me I'm
[2:31:02] thankful for how he sees me I'm
[2:31:04] sometimes confused at how I see myself
[2:31:06] but I'm thankful for how he sees me yes
[2:31:10] Lord and He forgives
[2:31:13] us and he and he forgives us over and
[2:31:16] over again and I'm so thankful for that
