[0:00] appreciate that just one scripture this
[0:01] morning colossians chapter 1 and verse
[0:04] 18
[0:05] and he is the head of the body
[0:08] christ is the head of the body
[0:10] the church who is the beginning the
[0:13] firstborn from the dead
[0:15] that in all things
[0:18] he might have
[0:19] the preeminence
[0:21] so we have the head which is christ
[0:24] christ is the word
[0:26] and the end goal of all time
[0:29] of god's achievement god's goal god's
[0:33] desire the end goal is that that he
[0:36] might the head
[0:38] he might have preeminence in all things
[0:43] and that can mean all of us all nations
[0:46] tongues people all that are in christ
[0:49] we're already in christ in his mind
[0:50] before the foundation of the world but
[0:52] see when we come to earth and we come in
[0:54] these bodies and his achievement is to
[0:56] bring all things under his preeminence
[0:59] but also we can apply this personally
[1:01] which is what i'll do this morning and
[1:03] given a little bit of my testimony and
[1:05] that is that when he brings this word
[1:08] and when he brings his headship to us
[1:10] the way that he has in the last days
[1:13] then he brings details of what we need
[1:16] to bring our lives underneath and that's
[1:18] time for us to fulfill the scripture in
[1:22] our personal lives
[1:24] that he
[1:25] the head
[1:26] would have preeminence in all things in
[1:29] our lives
[1:31] that's the goal
[1:32] and that's my desire this morning that's
[1:34] why i come to church
[1:35] i want to hear where i'm lacking i want
[1:37] to hear where i'm missing can you say
[1:39] man i want to hear those places that i
[1:41] don't have under his headship i wanted
[1:43] him to be lord not just savior but lord
[1:47] of every area of my life
[1:49] there's no closets there's no kingdoms
[1:51] in this heart that is not under his
[1:53] rulership i want him to have preeminence
[1:56] and and have his domain in each of my
[2:00] parts of my heart father we pray that
[2:02] you will bless
[2:03] these special people that have gathered
[2:05] this morning
[2:06] every one of them has a soul
[2:09] whether they be a visitor maybe they've
[2:10] never been here before but we all have
[2:12] one thing in common we have a soul
[2:15] and lord you know
[2:16] you have taught us from your word that
[2:19] that soul may reach out for other things
[2:22] of the world that would try to satisfy
[2:24] but we know that soul was created and
[2:27] made for god to dwell in
[2:30] and we have that in common this morning
[2:32] so it doesn't matter what stage
[2:33] anybody's at we have a soul all of us so
[2:36] we pray that that person who doesn't
[2:38] know you very well we pray that they
[2:41] would get to know you much better today
[2:44] maybe someone's been serving the lord
[2:45] for 30 years but yet lord that soul is
[2:49] still an important thing to give up to
[2:51] you this morning and to say father where
[2:54] can i yield myself more to you where can
[2:56] i surrender more to you we pray that you
[2:59] will anoint and bless and strengthen the
[3:02] body of christ that's here and around
[3:04] the world in jesus name amen god bless
[3:07] you why don't you shake your hands with
[3:09] somebody say god has given us the
[3:10] victory this morning
[3:12] god has given us the victory
[3:18] amen
[3:24] good to see the bachmann's in this
[3:26] morning as well from south carolina god
[3:27] bless you brother
[3:29] your wife
[3:31] amen
[3:33] you know from the beginning of time
[3:34] saints of god
[3:36] we realized that
[3:38] the the goal and the desire
[3:41] was that god established his kingdom
[3:44] on this earth we've been preaching a
[3:46] little bit about what this earth was
[3:48] even created for and he created it for
[3:51] his son and his daughter to rule and
[3:53] reign in
[3:54] and that his kingdom and god's kingdom
[3:57] is not just a physical place but it's
[3:59] actually
[4:00] kingdom principles it's his presence
[4:02] it's where it's a place where he's king
[4:04] and his subjects are subject to him and
[4:07] his principles and his commandments and
[4:09] his
[4:10] his his ways of life all those things
[4:14] are
[4:15] prevalent in his kingdom so god has
[4:18] sought to establish his kingdom
[4:21] in this earth from the very beginning
[4:24] that he would would hold a place of
[4:26] authority and headship in that kingdom
[4:29] and in that earth and that he would
[4:31] occupy the place as king
[4:34] for six thousand years he has not
[4:37] occupied the place on this earth as king
[4:39] there's been other men to rule there's
[4:41] been other influences that have ruled
[4:44] this earth but the the long-term goal
[4:46] the achievement of god is that finally
[4:49] that his kingdom would be established
[4:51] not in heaven but here on earth
[4:54] and uh that where he is occupied as king
[4:57] and by that that his word might have
[5:00] preeminence that his word as the king
[5:03] might have preeminence in that kingdom
[5:05] and on earth
[5:07] and then by that everything is running
[5:09] in that kingdom everything is running
[5:12] and functioning by kingdom principles
[5:15] and since the beginning he's been trying
[5:18] to establish his kingdom this way and
[5:21] he's been and he actually has used men
[5:23] to do it he put his son and daughter on
[5:25] earth and he was going to have them
[5:26] ruling on earth but it wasn't to rule in
[5:29] their own way it wasn't to rule for
[5:31] their own agenda it was established his
[5:33] kingdom on earth and he was going to use
[5:35] adam and eve to do that it was going to
[5:38] put his kingdom principles on this earth
[5:41] this earth was created for adam and eve
[5:44] and sons and daughters to rule and reign
[5:45] over it wasn't created for russia or for
[5:48] china or for the united states to rule
[5:50] and reign it was given to sons and
[5:52] daughters of god initially but the
[5:54] purpose was that his kingdom should rule
[5:57] and reign on earth that his ways his
[5:59] word and everything would be running by
[6:02] his kingdom principles
[6:05] so we know when he tried man then man
[6:08] men fell and actually throughout history
[6:11] we see god kept putting his trust in man
[6:14] he kept putting his he kept wanting to
[6:16] give his kingdom to men
[6:18] and they could never fully establish his
[6:21] kingdom on earth the way that he wanted
[6:23] it it always was interrupted he sent his
[6:27] word and then the people would receive
[6:29] it for a time and then they would go off
[6:31] into idolatry he sent his word through
[6:33] the prophets and he was in the reason he
[6:35] was saying is to bring his kingdom to
[6:37] the earth and man messed it up can you
[6:39] say amen from the fall in the garden all
[6:41] the way through but it's it's all been
[6:43] god trying to send his kingdom through
[6:46] the word of his prophet and for man to
[6:48] take it and establish it on the earth
[6:50] can you say amen
[6:52] to bring it into their lives to bring it
[6:54] into their families to bring it into
[6:56] them and just see this functioning on
[6:58] his his kingdom and to establish it the
[7:01] key
[7:02] is that
[7:03] we see the key and that was when he
[7:05] couldn't get men to establish it
[7:08] correctly then god came down himself
[7:13] god said i will go and become man like
[7:16] them
[7:18] and i will
[7:19] descend and i will come as a man like
[7:22] they are and i will show them how to
[7:25] establish the kingdom on earth because
[7:28] we know god in heaven but nobody could
[7:31] ever see yet nobody could ever catch
[7:33] what it was to bring his kingdom to
[7:36] earth and see it established in the
[7:38] earth
[7:39] so god says i'll go down aren't you glad
[7:42] he came down for you god says they can't
[7:45] get it right so i'm going to go down and
[7:47] i'm going to display to them i'm going
[7:49] to show them what it looks like
[7:52] [Music]
[7:53] i'm going to give them an example can
[7:55] you say man and i'm not just going to
[7:57] give them an example but i'm actually
[7:59] going to go to calvary i'm going to pay
[8:01] for every one of their sins i'm going to
[8:03] wash them by my blood so that they can
[8:05] come back into the place what they lost
[8:07] in the garden and fill them with the
[8:09] holy ghost so they actually have the
[8:12] kingdom of god within them
[8:16] because you can't establish this kingdom
[8:18] unless you have it in your heart first
[8:22] god said i'll i'll take care of that
[8:24] i'll do that because i know now
[8:26] he he knew all along but i know i need
[8:28] to come down and change the soul and
[8:30] change the nature of man and change
[8:33] everything about him and his desires so
[8:35] that he has within him the kingdom of
[8:37] god by the holy spirit and when he
[8:40] begins to yield to that
[8:42] finally there will be a people that
[8:45] establish his kingdom on earth
[8:47] not in heaven
[8:48] but in earth
[8:50] so he came to be like us
[8:53] our king
[8:55] came to us
[8:59] our king descended and came to us
[9:03] the king as all the many stories you've
[9:05] heard goes when the king wanted to come
[9:08] down and
[9:10] and mingle with his subjects and to find
[9:12] out how they lived and say find out how
[9:14] their hearts were and
[9:16] what he could do to help them their
[9:18] stories of kings coming and going
[9:20] incognito or going uh dressing in a a
[9:24] servant's clothing and just being among
[9:27] them and nobody knew it was the king and
[9:29] he come down and he he dressed like them
[9:31] he acted like them nobody knew it was
[9:33] the king of kings but he came down and
[9:35] mingled so that he could understand so
[9:37] that he can know to be tempted at every
[9:39] point so he could just know what it's
[9:41] like when you go to prayer and say god
[9:43] do you understand i'm going through this
[9:46] i'm being tempted by this and when you
[9:47] go to pray it's not a god that's saying
[9:50] i don't understand a thing that boy is
[9:51] saying but listen you've got a christ
[9:54] this morning that when you go with any
[9:55] knee he can say i understand i came as a
[9:59] king and i lived there on earth and i
[10:01] was tempted in all points like you are
[10:05] i'll tell you i can serve a king like
[10:06] that
[10:09] and so he came and
[10:11] there's one thing that i want to just
[10:12] lay as a foundation this morning like i
[10:14] said i want to get to my testimony it
[10:17] might be more my testimony this morning
[10:19] but he came
[10:21] and what was the key that helped what
[10:24] was the key that established the kingdom
[10:26] what was what was happening with this
[10:28] son christ that was establishing the
[10:31] kingdom and we learned from the bible
[10:33] what it was
[10:34] the bible says that jesus learned
[10:37] obedience by the things that he suffered
[10:43] so that's such a powerful statement to
[10:44] let us know that this son came and he
[10:47] went through a process of learning
[10:49] obedience so that's a key word is that
[10:52] if we want to see his kingdom
[10:54] established then it won't come without
[10:57] obedience on our part
[10:59] it won't come without repentance on our
[11:02] part it won't come without a heart that
[11:04] says i want to be obedient to the
[11:07] principles of god and this is what we
[11:08] found in jesus christ he came and he
[11:11] says i do nothing except my father shows
[11:13] me and he was trying to influence by
[11:15] different influences do things this way
[11:17] but he was committed to do things and
[11:20] live a life in front of us that was only
[11:22] what the father had given only by the
[11:23] word of god every day he walked in the
[11:25] vision of the word of god every day for
[11:28] three and a half years of ministry he
[11:29] walked according to what the father had
[11:32] put in the word what the prophets had
[11:34] said in the word he lived by the first
[11:36] time he came to be baptized by john john
[11:39] goes why do you you're the lamb of god
[11:41] why do you need to be baptized and jesus
[11:44] said thus it becometh us to fulfill the
[11:47] word of god to fulfill all righteousness
[11:50] so even the son is completely this sin
[11:53] this this skinless son of god is
[11:55] completely obedient this is the way the
[11:58] word says to come
[12:00] i must be baptized
[12:04] people say i don't need that i don't
[12:05] know no if you come to god his pathway
[12:08] you have to repent you have to say i
[12:10] want to be baptized and i'll just stop
[12:12] and say this we've got some new ones if
[12:14] god's leading you to take that step you
[12:16] can't be baptized in titles you have to
[12:18] be baptized in his name
[12:20] you have to fully repent to come into
[12:22] this you can't come into a church and
[12:24] just start raising your hand and say i'm
[12:26] a part of it because i'm here you have
[12:27] to repent of your sins you have to be
[12:30] baptized and if you're baptized in
[12:32] titles you want to be re-baptized into
[12:34] his name and we'll be glad to do that no
[12:36] matter who's being led that way i'd be
[12:39] glad to baptize you today if it took
[12:41] today next sunday whatever it is but you
[12:43] need to take that step if jesus took
[12:46] that step
[12:47] you should take that step
[12:49] set yourself as a candidate for the holy
[12:51] ghost peter said repent be baptized in
[12:54] the name of the lord jesus christ and ye
[12:56] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[13:01] so you can't bypass repentance you can't
[13:04] bypass baptism you've got to say lord
[13:06] i'm willing to take the steps jesus said
[13:09] jesus walked jesus did not function
[13:12] outside of what the word said thus it
[13:15] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[13:20] so whatever god our king sent as a
[13:22] commandment i'm living by that and not
[13:24] by what the pharisees say not by what
[13:26] the denominations are saying not by what
[13:29] other influencers says saying i'm going
[13:30] to do it by the word of god
[13:32] can i get a greater amen this morning
[13:35] i'm going to do it by the word of god so
[13:36] we see this example and then so skip
[13:39] ahead to the end he walked every day
[13:41] only by what the word said he never got
[13:44] outside of that word and at the end he
[13:46] even walks on the via dolorosa the way
[13:50] of suffering then he walks up to calvary
[13:53] he has nails put in his hands his nails
[13:55] put in his feet he's pierced in his side
[13:58] he goes there why because the word said
[14:02] he would
[14:05] and as a man he had a choice to say i'll
[14:07] do everything else
[14:09] but i'm not doing that
[14:12] that sounds very familiar
[14:17] oh i could preach now
[14:20] where you start to pick and choose what
[14:22] parts of the word you're going to follow
[14:25] in your example jesus christ didn't do
[14:27] that
[14:27] all the way to the end when when he said
[14:30] the prophecies the prophecies said he'll
[14:33] suffer the prophecy said he was led as a
[14:36] lamb to the slaughter
[14:38] he's going to be obedient and he's going
[14:40] to walk right into that word
[14:42] meaning his own death
[14:45] but then there's prophecies of a
[14:48] resurrection
[14:50] so
[14:51] how did jesus establish the kingdom how
[14:53] was the establishment came i hope you're
[14:55] learning something if you're interested
[14:57] in establishing his kingdom not your own
[15:00] not your bosses
[15:02] not bidens
[15:04] not trumps
[15:06] [Applause]
[15:08] it's not about their kingdom can you say
[15:10] man
[15:11] yeah you know how crazy every day in the
[15:13] news
[15:14] they're gonna fix
[15:16] racism
[15:18] all the football players have end racism
[15:20] on the back of their
[15:22] helmets
[15:24] can you imagine how haughty it is and
[15:27] how bold it is to say we're going to get
[15:29] the answer someday to end racism
[15:33] without the blood of jesus christ on the
[15:35] heart
[15:36] you will never ever in racism and i
[15:40] don't believe is this it's just bad in
[15:42] this country is what what it used to be
[15:44] but nevertheless that's not the argument
[15:46] the army is you'll never purge it
[15:48] completely because you haven't purged
[15:50] the heart yet
[15:52] you'll never end racism can you say man
[15:55] how can man how can presidents how
[15:57] people say that our democratic or
[15:59] republican agenda is going to solve the
[16:01] problem it's going to solve the global
[16:03] warming it's going to stop and that's
[16:04] what they're saying now the
[16:06] democrats are saying the biggest problem
[16:09] on earth the biggest issue we have is
[16:12] global warming and i'm
[16:14] i'm saying
[16:16] lord what kind of president do we have
[16:18] open up his eyes the biggest problem we
[16:21] have is global warming
[16:23] look around
[16:25] [Applause]
[16:26] no that's not the biggest problem
[16:30] the biggest problem is our lives are
[16:32] without the holy ghost in their lives
[16:37] that's the biggest problem
[16:40] but when you talk about his kingdom
[16:42] that's the things you start talking
[16:43] about
[16:44] and that's why when the holy ghost comes
[16:46] that's what ends racism that's what ends
[16:49] prejudiced
[16:50] that's when a brother embraces brother
[16:52] and there is no distinction
[16:54] in their race
[16:56] we're all from the same race
[16:59] and there is no distinctions on what you
[17:00] wear
[17:02] whether you got fancy clothes on today
[17:04] or whether you got overalls on you got
[17:06] the same outfit you've been wearing for
[17:08] four sundays it doesn't matter you can
[17:10] come here and worship the god and
[17:12] anytime we start to get a click in here
[17:14] that it's about what we wear or about
[17:16] how much money we have or how
[17:19] fancy our trucks are may god help us to
[17:21] hit and alter repentance because the
[17:23] holy ghost never emphasizes those things
[17:26] the holy ghost makes us brothers
[17:27] together
[17:32] [Applause]
[17:34] the key
[17:35] was obedience
[17:37] through the things he suffered when all
[17:39] kingdom principles are tested
[17:41] and he is tempted by satan to do things
[17:44] another way which how may know the lord
[17:45] was tempted by satan
[17:47] do it this way he's even using the word
[17:49] do it this way fall down on my feet
[17:51] command these stones to be made to bread
[17:53] and he would not budge i will not do
[17:56] things your interpretation of the word
[17:58] satan i will do it according to the
[18:00] king's commandment
[18:04] the word will always have first place
[18:08] and
[18:09] so now then even though the church
[18:11] got the spirit in the book of acts of
[18:14] his kingdom in their hearts many got
[18:15] away from that and still could not fully
[18:17] establish his kingdom on earth
[18:19] and so we have 2 000 years of church
[18:21] history
[18:22] where denominations came in where men's
[18:25] ideas came in
[18:26] people started to not preach about the
[18:28] holy ghost anymore but he said as long
[18:30] as you have a knowledge of the bible
[18:31] it's enough they begin to build schools
[18:34] they begin to build seminars they begin
[18:36] the unit of the dark ages where the
[18:38] church itself became the salvation for
[18:40] people instead of the blood of jesus
[18:42] christ so i'm summarizing 2 000 years of
[18:44] history for you you should say thank you
[18:46] to me i'm summarizing that men
[18:49] the the purpose god had for filling the
[18:52] holy ghost to establish his kingdom on
[18:54] earth they got away from it again
[18:57] so jumping ahead it's in this end time
[19:01] that god says
[19:02] i'll send my word again
[19:05] and it's prophesied this time this time
[19:08] there's gonna be a people
[19:10] that give him
[19:12] full preeminence
[19:16] i'm gonna hand over to the people and
[19:19] when i hand
[19:20] my word to the people in the end time
[19:23] through my prophet
[19:25] the king
[19:27] will be handed back the full preeminence
[19:31] the complete preeminence in all things
[19:35] the people will respond and say he's
[19:37] here
[19:38] he sent it again
[19:40] but this time
[19:41] did he ever send a mighty word
[19:45] that there be no questions
[19:47] about what the king feels about things
[19:50] i'm going to read some quotes to you
[19:52] today that
[19:54] detail the detail
[19:56] of how specific god would breathe on his
[19:58] people for the end time
[20:00] and to give us what we need
[20:03] to be able to live and establish his
[20:05] kingdom in our marriages in our homes in
[20:08] our churches and get us ready to break
[20:11] into a millennium where it will be all
[20:13] about his kingdom on this earth i don't
[20:15] know about you but i want to be a part
[20:18] of that millennium i want to be a part
[20:19] of that
[20:20] i don't know about you but i want to be
[20:21] a part of a people and a part of a
[20:23] church and a part of
[20:25] god's move in the last days to finally
[20:27] see his kingdom established
[20:30] notice how it happens again even in our
[20:32] own ranks that we have the precious word
[20:35] from the king and we have ministers to
[20:37] take the same word and establish their
[20:40] own kingdom their own church doing it
[20:43] again and god says no you're using it
[20:46] for the wrong reasons
[20:49] i have tried for 6 000 years and i'm
[20:51] going to send my word but somebody at
[20:53] the end time is going to get a hold of
[20:55] this word and somebody is going to give
[20:58] him the word preeminence in everything
[21:01] in their lives
[21:05] somebody's going to do it is it you this
[21:06] morning
[21:08] somebody's going to do it
[21:10] because he wouldn't send it unless there
[21:11] was somebody to receive it
[21:13] you can go with your own agenda you can
[21:15] leave here this morning with your own
[21:17] goals and ambitions and achievements
[21:19] that's that's wonderful but if you ever
[21:21] consider what god's achievement is for
[21:23] this hour have you ever considered what
[21:25] god's achievement is for your life have
[21:28] you ever prayed and said not my will but
[21:31] thine be done
[21:33] in the end time the king will bring his
[21:35] word
[21:36] and the king will be handed over the
[21:38] complete preeminence in all things
[21:40] because it will be in this hour
[21:42] god gave his word
[21:44] in our time that is more deep detailed
[21:47] than ever before if he has to become the
[21:50] head of all things then he will speak
[21:52] his word in specifics of all things
[21:55] never before have we received a word
[21:57] that has opened our precious bibles to
[22:00] us so much that a christian would know
[22:02] how to live and how to yield to god and
[22:05] what do i do about this and what i do
[22:07] about that and that's my testimony this
[22:08] morning when god filled me with the holy
[22:10] ghost at 16 years old i developed an
[22:12] incredible hunger for the word of god i
[22:15] devoured my bible i want to know what
[22:17] the king said about stuff i want to know
[22:19] about every subject that he addressed
[22:22] and incidentally my testimony is is god
[22:25] is more specific than what we ever
[22:27] realize about stuff in your life
[22:32] he created you he created this whole
[22:34] thing so he wouldn't give us a world to
[22:36] live in without his commandment and his
[22:39] kingship and his word and principle this
[22:41] is how you this is how christians do it
[22:44] this is how believers do it
[22:46] you've heard your whole life how the
[22:48] world does it you've listened to the
[22:49] hollywood stars how they live their
[22:51] lifestyles but when you become
[22:53] interested in the king's commandment
[22:55] then you say lord i'm shutting all of
[22:57] that out a young girl 15 years old and
[22:59] say lord i'm something has happened to
[23:02] me and i'm shutting out all the voices
[23:04] of immodesty and i'm going to look to
[23:06] what the king said that a girl should
[23:08] wear
[23:11] praise the lord
[23:14] so there's an interesting scripture here
[23:15] in ecclesiastes 8 if you guys could
[23:17] bring that up ecclesiastes 8
[23:20] i don't know what verse it is um might
[23:22] be verse one i don't know who is as the
[23:25] wise man
[23:26] who is as the wise man and who knoweth
[23:29] the interpretation of a thing
[23:32] a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine
[23:36] and the boldness of his face shall be
[23:37] changed who is as the wise man baptist
[23:39] men who is it and who knoweth the
[23:40] interpretation really in our own
[23:43] our wisest men of the earth don't know
[23:46] it all
[23:48] saying the question who who really knows
[23:51] who has the final word on things who has
[23:54] enough wisdom to figure it all out go to
[23:56] the wisest man on earth and that's still
[23:59] going to be limited and that's why we
[24:01] seek the wisdom of god because he is
[24:03] unlimited he has all knowledge he knows
[24:06] all things
[24:07] so that's why we see god who is a wise
[24:09] man who knows the interpretation of
[24:10] thing a man's wisdom maketh his face to
[24:12] shine and boldness of his face shall be
[24:14] changed that's what the wisdom of god
[24:15] does to you i counsel thee to keep the
[24:18] king's commandment and that regard of
[24:21] the oath of god hold right there i
[24:23] counsel thee to keep the king's
[24:26] commandment
[24:28] and that in regard of the oath of god in
[24:30] other words if you make an oath to the
[24:32] king then the next step is to keep the
[24:35] king's commandment because the king is
[24:37] not just the king and you have a
[24:38] ceremony and they do this to come into
[24:40] our country to become a citizen
[24:43] they have to come in and they have to
[24:44] you know learn certain things of our our
[24:46] uh constitution all these things and
[24:48] they have to know certain things and
[24:49] they go through a test and then they
[24:51] have to go have a ceremony and take an
[24:53] oath to become a citizen i don't know
[24:55] why any of the rest of the americans
[24:56] that sometimes we need other americans
[24:58] to take that as well you know we get it
[25:01] by birth we get our citizenship but
[25:02] there's a lot of americans don't follow
[25:04] the principles of our country but you
[25:06] see now when you take an oath to the
[25:08] king i swear my allegiance to the king i
[25:11] come down to the altar and i give i'm
[25:13] giving my heart to the lord that's only
[25:15] the first step
[25:18] this king is not just wanting you to
[25:20] have a ceremony or a service where you
[25:22] say i pledge my oath to the king but he
[25:25] says i counsel them to keep the king's
[25:28] commandment he's going to give you
[25:30] principles to live by
[25:33] he's going to establish his kingdom in
[25:35] your life and when you give your heart
[25:37] to the lord you say then now what is the
[25:40] king's commandments what is the king's
[25:42] wishes how does the king want me to live
[25:45] is anybody hearing me here this morning
[25:48] it goes on to say in verse 3 be not
[25:50] hasty to go out of his sight
[25:53] his presence
[25:55] don't ever be hasty to go out of the
[25:57] king's presence
[26:00] if you swore north to him you better
[26:02] stay in his presence
[26:04] you better camp yourself close to his
[26:06] throne
[26:08] can i get an amen be not hasty to go out
[26:11] why is he saying that why is he saying
[26:12] that because we in our flesh will be
[26:15] hasty to get outside of his domain to
[26:18] work outside of his dominion to work
[26:21] outside of his presence don't be hasty
[26:24] to do that you work within his presence
[26:26] you stay within earshot of his throne
[26:30] because he's going to issue guidance for
[26:31] you you s park yourself build your house
[26:36] build your life
[26:40] within close close proximity
[26:43] to the king
[26:45] stand not in an evil thing
[26:48] for he doeth whatsoever please of him
[26:51] the next scripture says
[26:52] where the word of a king is
[26:55] there's power
[26:58] and who may say unto him what doest thou
[27:01] like paul said about the pot
[27:04] the pottery saying to the potter
[27:07] why have you made me this you can
[27:08] imagine a piece of pottery looking up
[27:10] and saying why are you bolding me this
[27:12] way
[27:13] what are you doing
[27:16] pottery can't say that
[27:18] that's where we become pliable in the
[27:20] hands of god you don't ask god how he's
[27:22] going to make you just let him mold you
[27:25] i don't know if i want to be that way
[27:27] well you haven't got all of the
[27:29] rebellion out of you yet
[27:32] but when you come to the potter's house
[27:34] you say i'm jumping up on the potter's
[27:36] wheel and i'm letting the potter mold me
[27:38] the way he wants and who can say to the
[27:40] potter why have you made me this and who
[27:42] says to the king what doest thou no
[27:44] because he has all wisdom he we don't
[27:47] question that can you say amen where the
[27:49] word of the king is i love that there's
[27:51] power there's authority who may say unto
[27:53] him what what doest thou in the next
[27:56] scripture
[27:58] whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel
[28:01] no evil thing a wise man's heart
[28:03] discerneth both time and judgment i want
[28:05] to read verse 5 again in the amplified
[28:07] and then i'll get on to my testimony
[28:09] amplified version verse 5 whosoever
[28:12] whoever keeps
[28:14] and observes a royal command
[28:18] will experience neither trouble nor
[28:21] misery
[28:24] really
[28:26] there's power
[28:28] in the commandment of the king
[28:31] that under that authority you'll be
[28:33] protected
[28:37] whoever observes a royal i love that a
[28:40] wrong this isn't just a commandment
[28:42] that's why the problem with people it's
[28:43] his commandments it's this do's and
[28:45] don'ts it's just and god needs to change
[28:47] your heart because think about it if you
[28:49] look at it like a royal commandment
[28:54] that your king has issued something very
[28:58] personal to you
[29:00] very specific
[29:02] and if you look at it oh man i've had
[29:04] teenagers say every time i turn around
[29:06] here it's just another rule
[29:10] anybody ever had teenagers tell you
[29:12] every time i can't get out i can't wait
[29:14] someday wednesday and i just walk about
[29:16] 18 years old somehow they say 18 you're
[29:18] out from underneath the headship of your
[29:19] parents when i get 18 i'm getting out of
[29:21] all this i'm getting away from all this
[29:23] and then there's parents saying yeah
[29:25] that's right you have to do what i say
[29:26] until you're 18. and then you'll do what
[29:28] you want
[29:29] what
[29:31] hello
[29:33] you're setting yourself up for a
[29:34] disaster
[29:35] both the child and you
[29:40] if authority is in our lives it's always
[29:43] in our lives
[29:45] because of protection
[29:50] and his love
[29:51] and his royal
[29:53] commandment
[29:56] if we look at it that way that it's the
[29:58] it's the king's royal if you looked at
[30:02] the message that way which by grace of
[30:05] god i look at it that way
[30:08] i don't see just a man
[30:11] okay
[30:12] i'm not deifying anybody
[30:15] the prophet of this hour and any prophet
[30:17] was a human being and they're not deity
[30:22] including our profit of this hour
[30:23] they're not deity you'll find pockets
[30:25] within our our belief group that believe
[30:27] that i don't believe it this church
[30:29] doesn't believe it it's idolatry it's
[30:31] heresy i don't believe that but i do
[30:33] believe in god's prophets and i do
[30:35] believe they can be god to the people in
[30:37] this sense they're bringing the king's
[30:39] commandment through their lips
[30:40] so it's not about the man it's about the
[30:43] authority in a man and if god puts his
[30:46] authority in that man to speak the word
[30:48] then you better not look at it as the
[30:50] man you better be saying i'm hearing the
[30:53] king's commandment
[30:55] i'm hearing a royal command come from my
[30:59] king and i swore my oath to him at the
[31:02] altar one day and now i'm waiting to
[31:04] hear what comes next from the royal
[31:06] commandments of my king
[31:10] praise the lord i'm having a good time
[31:12] with this whosoever keeping the command
[31:14] shall feel no evil thing and a wise man
[31:15] and i love how the amplified says it he
[31:18] shall this is incredible promise for you
[31:20] to latch onto this morning whosoever
[31:22] keepeth keeps and observe a royal
[31:24] command will experience neither trouble
[31:25] nor misery now i know some of us has
[31:28] experienced some trouble and misery but
[31:30] what kind of trouble and misery are we
[31:31] talking about
[31:34] you might go through trouble in misery
[31:36] but if you're under the king's command
[31:38] there's a certain protection over your
[31:40] life that satan can only go so far
[31:43] he's not going to take you all the way
[31:44] satan can't take you all the way
[31:46] you're going to you're not going to go
[31:47] off the deep end if you're in the word
[31:50] and under the king's command you'll
[31:51] never go too far you'll never blaspheme
[31:54] the holy ghost if you have the holy
[31:55] ghost you'll never blaspheme the holy
[31:57] ghost
[31:58] if you are under his protection in his
[32:00] word your mind might be falling apart
[32:03] sometime but satan can never fully have
[32:07] you
[32:08] so don't ever think that satan's got me
[32:11] he's taken me i'm finished i got a
[32:14] promise here that says if you're living
[32:15] under a royal commandment of the king
[32:17] your king's going to watch over you
[32:19] [Applause]
[32:25] so now
[32:26] preeminence is a superior is superiority
[32:30] in rank
[32:31] it's precedence it's before it's above
[32:34] and that's what i'm speaking on this
[32:36] morning if you have my
[32:37] subject
[32:38] preeminence in all things
[32:41] preeminence and all things
[32:43] to understand preeminence that scripture
[32:46] and that word
[32:47] priority of place he has the first place
[32:49] the king's commandment has first place
[32:51] superiority of power
[32:53] or influence and that's where i'd like
[32:55] to begin a little bit of my testimony
[32:59] the superiority of power influence
[33:01] something happened in my life when i
[33:03] received his spirit
[33:06] and when you bring up
[33:08] things like the superiority
[33:11] of
[33:12] power and influence who has
[33:14] the greatest influence in your life it
[33:16] brings other questions
[33:19] who has the final say
[33:22] of things in your life
[33:28] your wife
[33:32] your husband
[33:35] oh that's a sticky one
[33:38] you know there's a certain the headship
[33:40] trickles down there and we understand
[33:42] that but who has who has the final say
[33:46] of everything in your life
[33:51] why do you have to say that brother paul
[33:52] i'm at church let me get off of my back
[33:54] i'm here
[33:56] because it's not about being its church
[33:58] it's that who has who
[34:00] has the final say
[34:02] with everything in your life
[34:05] is it what you heard on the internet
[34:08] is it your upbringing that wasn't fully
[34:10] balanced
[34:11] is it a preacher you were under that
[34:12] wasn't fully balanced is it
[34:14] denominational ideas somebody influences
[34:17] your life
[34:20] some people have baggage from their past
[34:23] terrible terrible baggage and guess what
[34:25] that baggage is an everyday influence on
[34:29] their everyday decisions
[34:31] they're making decisions based upon a
[34:33] filter and that filter is their past and
[34:36] this happened to me way back here so i
[34:39] will never do this this way again
[34:42] because of this hurt or this what
[34:43] happened back here so uh
[34:45] and this your decisions on a daily daily
[34:48] basis are imbalanced because they're not
[34:51] influenced by the word they're
[34:53] influenced by your past
[34:56] we're a creature that can be influenced
[34:58] by so many things
[35:02] make decisions in life because they've
[35:04] fed on disney movies their whole life
[35:09] and those decisions are influenced by
[35:11] their disney influence
[35:14] you you go ahead and chuckle in your
[35:15] heart and say that can't be true listen
[35:18] i've seen it firsthand
[35:20] i've seen it firsthand
[35:23] what influences in your life who has the
[35:25] final say now who decides things
[35:27] what influence will be given to those
[35:29] decisions for all the things in your
[35:31] life
[35:32] this is the hour we're in this is the
[35:34] word the hour in this is the work of the
[35:35] lord going on now it's not that we know
[35:37] that jesus was god we know that or that
[35:40] he paid for our redemption we know that
[35:43] or that god sent a prophet we know that
[35:45] it's the power of redemption working in
[35:48] our lives how many want the power of
[35:49] redemption work in our life we know
[35:51] christ is the redeemer we know he went
[35:53] to calvary we already know that
[35:56] we know god sends prophets we understand
[35:58] that but what we're really considering
[36:00] is that is the power of redemption
[36:03] working in our lives our obedience to
[36:06] the word makes the authority of god
[36:08] begin to flow through our body and the
[36:10] bride is the one that gives the king
[36:13] finally and hands over this is what i
[36:15] would talk about this morning something
[36:17] when i was young made me hand over
[36:21] the the influence of my decision making
[36:24] process i handed it over
[36:27] most of it
[36:29] but over time
[36:30] i handed over all of it
[36:37] he must have the pre-intimate
[36:38] preeminence
[36:41] so
[36:43] by the holy ghost at 16 years old i made
[36:45] a decision
[36:47] i said lord
[36:49] and this is 16 years old now so you got
[36:52] this is a pretty young man and so i
[36:54] still have
[36:55] you know immaturities to work through
[37:00] but something happened to me
[37:03] and one night while the word was being
[37:05] preached
[37:06] i didn't go to the altar till the end
[37:08] but i knew something changed in me
[37:12] while the word was being preached
[37:14] i didn't speak in tongues which some
[37:16] churches would say well you didn't get
[37:17] it then
[37:18] i'm telling you in the book of acts
[37:20] church when they come out of the upper
[37:22] room it wasn't unknown tongues it says
[37:24] other tongues
[37:25] and everybody heard them in their own
[37:27] language so it was not unknown tongues
[37:29] and that is not the evidence of the holy
[37:31] ghost it's one of the gifts in the
[37:33] church one of the nine spiritual gifts
[37:35] pentecost took it and made it the
[37:36] initial evidence of the holy ghost but
[37:38] that is not the evidence of the holy
[37:39] ghost
[37:40] if that's true i don't have the holy
[37:42] ghost but i know i have the holy ghost
[37:43] today
[37:44] but i know it by the identification of
[37:47] what happened to me in the fruits that
[37:48] followed the biggest evidence i could
[37:51] see is something was changed in me and i
[37:55] no longer had a desire in nature for the
[37:57] things of the world but i had this
[37:59] craving and hunger for the word of god
[38:03] and when the word of god was preached
[38:06] in here in here
[38:08] there was no more resistance
[38:11] matter of fact when it was the true word
[38:14] something down here said
[38:16] amen every time amen because the holy
[38:20] ghost agrees with every word of god
[38:22] that's the evidence you have it it
[38:23] agrees and it receives every word of god
[38:26] especially for this age
[38:27] that's the evidence forget about all the
[38:29] other evidences you've been taught it's
[38:31] always linked with the word and if you
[38:32] say the holy ghost you have the holy
[38:34] ghost and you reject any part of the
[38:36] word something's wrong with your
[38:38] experience
[38:39] you've got a rebellion says i ain't
[38:40] doing that you've got a problem in your
[38:42] experience because the holy ghost always
[38:44] says amen now i will admit to you when i
[38:47] was sitting in services sometimes my
[38:49] mind was resisting my flesh was
[38:51] resisting
[38:52] that's a real hard experience to be in
[38:54] because my flesh didn't want to hear
[38:56] preaching that was hard sometimes
[38:58] because i wanted to do my first one to
[39:00] do what it wanted to do
[39:02] so when i got preached on when i got all
[39:04] 10 toes stepped on
[39:10] god took the height off of me sometimes
[39:14] what was funny happening is my trust was
[39:17] going i wanted to get up and walk out
[39:19] just sneak out i wanted to go
[39:21] my mind was struggling but down here
[39:24] there wasn't anything struggling
[39:27] every time
[39:28] it issued a real strong
[39:30] amen
[39:32] can't stand that guy that's telling me
[39:35] right now i'm mad at him but my soul's
[39:37] saying buddy
[39:39] you know he's telling you the truth
[39:44] how many raise your hand you experienced
[39:45] that before
[39:47] because because you're because your body
[39:50] and your mind
[39:51] and your spirit is not born again
[39:53] only your soul
[39:55] this is our journey
[39:57] this is our struggle bring in the body
[39:59] and the mind under subjection to what
[40:00] the amenner says
[40:02] this is the this is preeminence that
[40:05] this body and all things and all
[40:06] decisions is come under the headship of
[40:08] the king and whatever issues from this
[40:10] throne because he's not somewhere up on
[40:12] the throne there now now he's he set up
[40:14] his his throne right here
[40:17] whatever is preached and utters from
[40:19] here that flesh
[40:21] just picks up and says you're going like
[40:23] the times that you're
[40:25] sitting at home and it's an hour before
[40:28] church
[40:30] and you've been
[40:32] running yourself ragged
[40:34] and you've been going going going you've
[40:36] been to walmart you've been to meyers
[40:39] you've been on the the school the
[40:42] homeschool
[40:43] uh
[40:44] field trip
[40:46] and you have worked in the yard to get
[40:49] the
[40:50] billions of leaves away
[40:53] and you have got the law and you put the
[40:55] whole and you you're sitting there on
[40:57] wednesday night or sunday and you're
[40:59] completely just completely
[41:03] bushed
[41:09] and you know
[41:10] you've been everywhere
[41:13] you've done everything
[41:14] and your wife says
[41:16] you better get ready
[41:19] it's time to go to church
[41:23] and right there's a battle jaden
[41:25] did you know that
[41:29] right there's a battle that goes on
[41:32] you know you know the story about the
[41:34] wife that kept telling her husband to
[41:35] get out of bed and
[41:37] go to church and he kept resisting he
[41:39] says i don't want to go
[41:40] he said i'll give you two reasons
[41:42] i don't feel like it
[41:44] and
[41:45] those people don't like me there
[41:48] and she said well i'll give you
[41:50] two reasons to go
[41:52] she said it will do you good
[41:53] and you're the pastor
[42:02] so then the battle just
[42:04] oh my goodness wow
[42:08] yeah
[42:10] and i've had this happen so much in my
[42:12] life
[42:13] where my
[42:14] mind is going through how tired i am
[42:18] and then something resonates something
[42:20] begins to churn the churn in the soul
[42:25] something begins to rise up and
[42:27] something begins at night wait a minute
[42:30] i know how much i love the word i know
[42:33] how much i know it's love his presence
[42:35] so there's a battle but
[42:37] eventually
[42:38] that soul if i yield to it it wins the
[42:41] battle
[42:43] wins the battle
[42:44] and it overcomes all tiredness because
[42:47] if i can go to walmart and i got the
[42:49] energy to go to walmart and i can go on
[42:51] the field trip and i can run all over
[42:53] the place how did i lose all the energy
[42:55] to go hear the word of god
[42:59] don't forget today this is my testimony
[43:00] i'm preaching on myself okay not you
[43:02] guys
[43:05] something rises up and though the body
[43:08] is saying i think i'll stay right here
[43:13] something grabs
[43:14] me
[43:16] pulls me up
[43:18] and says you're going to church
[43:24] amen
[43:30] so
[43:32] the soul
[43:34] is it's a battle and so
[43:36] the holy ghost i got into the word like
[43:39] never before
[43:40] and then
[43:41] i said if god was gracious enough and
[43:44] you visitors have patience with me today
[43:47] if you don't understand the scriptures
[43:48] i'll be glad to take the time after the
[43:50] service or any time with you god has
[43:52] sent us a real restorative ministry he's
[43:55] the man has passed and gone on but in
[43:57] malachi 4 and luke 17 30 in about
[43:59] probably eight to ten key scriptures
[44:02] even jesus talks of one he said elias
[44:04] will come and restore all things it
[44:06] speaks of a one-man ministry with the
[44:08] spirit of elijah to bring us back to the
[44:10] word okay
[44:11] so let me share with you if you want to
[44:13] i'll be glad you i'll be quoting from
[44:14] him a little bit today i'll be quoting
[44:16] from the scripture but it's because this
[44:18] became such an influence on my life when
[44:20] i knew this was the authority of god the
[44:22] man's gone the man's out of the picture
[44:24] but the word that he was bringing was
[44:25] bringing me back to this bible i
[44:27] devoured this and i devoured the message
[44:29] of the last days i wanted to know if god
[44:32] this is what i said if god was gracious
[44:34] enough to send a prophet to my
[44:37] generation in my own language then i
[44:40] ought to be humble enough to take the
[44:43] time to hear what he said
[44:46] i'm telling you that's exactly what i
[44:48] thought that's exactly what i said if
[44:49] i'm 16 years old i've got some time here
[44:52] i'm not married i don't have 50 kids yet
[44:54] i don't have bills myself i'm going to
[44:56] take the time and listen and find out
[44:58] what he said i'm going to take my bible
[44:59] and as brother branham himself said
[45:01] don't just take my word for it he said
[45:03] check it out with the word because it
[45:05] has to ring true with this bible brother
[45:07] branham says this is our absolute this
[45:10] is our absolute
[45:12] not the word of a man but where the
[45:14] prophets will bring us back to our
[45:15] absolute
[45:17] and so that's what i did but i devoured
[45:19] that message and what i found was is
[45:21] that i couldn't believe how detailed it
[45:24] was for my generation about certain
[45:26] things and how to live i developed this
[45:29] hunger for the word of god the
[45:31] the evidence of the holy ghost was in me
[45:33] i was receiving the word for my day and
[45:35] i wanted to have more of it i'm so glad
[45:38] that god got a hold of me early in life
[45:40] i'm so happy for that god touched my
[45:43] life young people don't wait till
[45:45] someday and say i'll go to the lord when
[45:47] i get married i'll go to the lord when i
[45:49] do this that and the other don't wait
[45:51] this morning turn your life over to
[45:53] jesus christ right now
[45:57] i'm so glad god got me before i fed on a
[45:59] lot of trash
[46:02] i played some video games you know
[46:05] and uh
[46:06] i dabbled in some of that you know they
[46:08] were mild
[46:10] like the four i really liked the
[46:11] four-wheeler
[46:12] uh video games the atv
[46:15] that was a lot of fun
[46:16] i actually was winning on some of those
[46:18] pac-man
[46:20] uh
[46:22] and you know people are laughing because
[46:24] there's only certain generation knows
[46:26] what i'm talking about
[46:28] but i'll mention the other ones here in
[46:29] a minute but but you know i i did this
[46:31] and i did the young people participating
[46:33] this so i didn't but i found i quickly
[46:36] lost interest i didn't become obsessed
[46:38] with it
[46:39] if i if i played it it's fine to play
[46:40] the four wheel game man i might still
[46:42] get on with somebody and play it it's
[46:43] not a crime to do that but
[46:45] my interest had changed
[46:47] and i didn't i wasn't feeding on that
[46:49] stuff
[46:50] like like it was an obsession
[46:53] because
[46:54] something had set up kingship in my life
[46:57] remember now preeminence is the security
[46:59] of superiority of the influence in your
[47:01] life and i come under such a strong
[47:03] influence feeding on the message alone
[47:05] myself it placed
[47:07] most of my deciding of right and wrong
[47:12] was handed over to what i read
[47:15] in my bible and in the message
[47:18] there was a i and
[47:21] i just yielded i don't it's just the
[47:23] holy ghost i yield most of my decisions
[47:26] about right and wrong
[47:28] were yielded and handed over
[47:31] to what i'd find in the bible or the
[47:32] message
[47:34] and i let that decide for me
[47:36] is that okay with everybody
[47:38] and it wasn't long before the things i
[47:40] read
[47:43] affected me it influenced me the games
[47:46] the movies the music
[47:49] all came under the headship
[47:51] of jesus christ the word
[47:53] everything was filtered
[47:55] everything became censored
[47:58] the filter of the word of god is what i
[48:00] brought all those things through
[48:02] and if it didn't come through that
[48:03] filter well i'd never even touched it
[48:05] again i don't even want to go there
[48:09] something happened to me that i allowed
[48:11] this to become such a strong filter that
[48:14] i would not
[48:15] allow myself to dabble in something
[48:18] unless i'd taken it through the filter
[48:20] of the word
[48:24] i noticed how that prepared to me to be
[48:26] a father it prepared me for so many
[48:28] things these quotes
[48:30] and it was pretty slim pickings when you
[48:32] go to chart start to choose movies today
[48:34] which there are some decent movies to
[48:35] watch our family watches some of them
[48:37] every now and then i don't have any time
[48:39] to hardly do that now
[48:41] but uh i can tell you even when i was 16
[48:43] years old it was very slim pickings
[48:46] what movies i could watch
[48:49] because why the filter of the holy ghost
[48:51] you need that in your life
[48:54] it couldn't make it through the filter
[48:57] and so when that test came it's like nat
[49:00] can't do that not doing that not do that
[49:02] then every once in a while slim pickings
[49:03] you find something well isn't
[49:05] isn't that nice no cussing no swearing
[49:09] no sexual individuals and no women
[49:11] dressed wrong i had a pretty strong
[49:13] filter from the word of god get to see a
[49:15] movie it's got some wholesomeness to it
[49:17] that's what we let our children watch my
[49:19] children grew up on little house on the
[49:20] prairie basically that's it right guys
[49:22] that's it little house in the prairie
[49:25] veggie tales
[49:29] very very
[49:30] slim
[49:32] slim pickings of what we allowed the
[49:34] kids and so why did i raise my family
[49:36] that way because i had already been
[49:37] through a process that somehow i turned
[49:40] over all these decisions to the word to
[49:44] the message and if i got a hint from the
[49:46] king through that word it was enough for
[49:48] me
[49:50] now if you go away here thinking
[49:52] thinking that
[49:54] i've been perfect since then i never
[49:55] made a mistake that's not true that i've
[49:57] never looked at something wrong that's
[49:58] not true
[50:01] we're human beings we make mistakes
[50:04] we get carnal we get fleshly
[50:07] what i find about a holy ghost christian
[50:09] is that he could hardly get through
[50:11] something that's
[50:13] cussing or bad or worldly or something
[50:16] on the inside registers and he can't
[50:17] hardly get through it without feeling a
[50:20] whole
[50:21] lot of conviction
[50:24] god please forgive me i have just
[50:28] offended your spirit
[50:31] help me lord to stop doing that
[50:34] there's some preachers to tell you when
[50:36] you've got the holy ghost at the altar
[50:37] you'll never do something like that i
[50:39] don't agree with that that's that's a
[50:41] sinless perfection in the flesh
[50:43] but there is a power of the holy ghost
[50:45] that's not watered down and if you'll
[50:47] yield to it it'll give you the filter to
[50:49] overcome the things of the world and
[50:50] your satisfaction will be in the holy
[50:53] ghost and in his word and fellowship
[50:55] with the saints and joy that makes you
[50:57] want to dance like i felt this morning
[50:59] when the choir was singing that's the
[51:01] joy that you want
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:03] my satisfaction doesn't come from some
[51:06] drink in some bar or some movie or
[51:09] something in the world i have found what
[51:13] really gets me going
[51:17] some of you need that this morning and
[51:19] it's not just some theological thing all
[51:21] you've got to do is say i'm ready lord
[51:23] to surrender everything to you this
[51:25] morning
[51:33] i just the last few months i've been
[51:35] pondering these things so much while i'm
[51:38] talking about authority but then i
[51:39] looked at my own life i said lord what
[51:41] is it
[51:41] what was it that gave that message so
[51:44] much authority in my life for decision
[51:46] making
[51:48] what in the world i've been pondering
[51:49] that that a young man would would hand
[51:53] over
[51:54] my cues and what i would do on a daily
[51:57] basis i was looking for something
[52:00] in that word something where he pointed
[52:02] to the bible something that he went
[52:05] through personally himself and he
[52:07] learned and i'm just on to i said that
[52:09] that applies
[52:12] and i'd hand over the decision
[52:15] and that that would make the decision
[52:16] for me
[52:18] what kind of authority
[52:20] how did i what did i do
[52:22] such strong influence the priority of
[52:24] the greatest influence in my life became
[52:26] that
[52:28] i'm asking why did i do that and the
[52:30] devil always has this explanation to me
[52:32] in my ear
[52:33] well
[52:37] you know you were raised in this
[52:42] and then next he says you know
[52:45] you're probably too scared to do
[52:47] anything else but this
[52:51] so i'm working through all this with the
[52:53] devil's voice
[52:55] and if you have the thai post of the
[52:57] holy ghost you have to say no no no no
[52:59] no
[53:01] i'm glad i was raised in this but
[53:03] something happened to me at 16 years old
[53:06] and now that i'm older i don't have to
[53:08] follow this at all that's what i said
[53:10] wednesday night
[53:11] it's true i can do whatever i want this
[53:14] morning
[53:16] if i wanted to leave this church and go
[53:18] to sidelines bar and sit at the bar and
[53:20] have a drink after church i am afr i can
[53:24] go do that
[53:27] but guess what
[53:28] i don't want to
[53:31] and if you have something in there yeah
[53:33] i can't wait to finish preaching so i
[53:34] can go get a drink you need the holy
[53:36] ghost
[53:37] you need the holy ghost
[53:40] because if you have the holy ghost
[53:41] you're not worried about
[53:43] running off to anywhere else you're
[53:45] actually not looking at the clock
[53:48] i hope this preacher preaches another
[53:49] hour
[53:51] i don't have anywhere else to go right
[53:52] now
[53:54] that's kind of thoughts of the holy
[53:56] ghost is that i hope he keeps preaching
[53:58] i'm loving this i'm enjoying this or
[54:01] something saying amen down on the inside
[54:05] [Applause]
[54:06] and sherry has a song it's true i can do
[54:10] whatever i want but my wants been
[54:13] rearranged is that how it goes
[54:16] it's true i can do you see people think
[54:18] that's oh no you can't no you can't
[54:21] you're a christian you can't do what you
[54:22] want yes i can
[54:26] this morning i can do whatever i want
[54:30] but my wants have been changed
[54:33] that's it
[54:35] my wants have been changed
[54:38] amen so the devil says you're too scared
[54:40] to do it you grew up in this no no devil
[54:42] no something's changed
[54:44] and i know i'm doing it now because i
[54:46] don't have to do this i don't have to do
[54:48] any of this but i'm still doing it
[54:50] and doing it because i heard the king's
[54:53] royal
[54:54] commandments come to me
[54:56] and i come under his authority
[55:00] when the devil says you're doing this
[55:02] because you grew up in it
[55:04] or you're too scared to do anything else
[55:06] and work outside
[55:07] i better do it or mom and dad's going to
[55:09] be looking at me
[55:12] when satan says that it sounds
[55:14] reasonable
[55:15] and you may be conforming there's a lot
[55:17] of message kids that grew up in a
[55:19] message pew that don't have the holy
[55:21] ghost yet
[55:23] they know things are right
[55:25] but you don't have the power to live it
[55:27] yet because you're making your own
[55:29] decisions and you're not searching that
[55:31] message to order your life
[55:33] i love you i'm going to tell you the
[55:34] truth
[55:37] it sounds reasonable that it's satan
[55:39] says it's you were raised in it does
[55:41] tell you ones that are in that condition
[55:43] to conform to something
[55:45] instead of be transformed
[55:47] it only lasts so long
[55:51] if you're just still conforming to it
[55:53] because you're scared afraid i'm scared
[55:55] afraid
[55:58] it doesn't last very long and you become
[56:00] miserable so miserable
[56:05] kind of like a marriage staying together
[56:07] just because the message and the word
[56:09] says stay together
[56:12] how miserable is that
[56:14] i have to stay together with her because
[56:16] the word says to do it
[56:19] and i would be embarrassed
[56:21] if somebody seen that we were separated
[56:24] and then god has this holy spirit that
[56:27] comes in your life
[56:30] and you really fall in love according to
[56:32] god's divine love with one another
[56:34] and you don't want out anymore you
[56:36] actually look at that person in their
[56:38] soul and you love them and they love you
[56:41] because of their soul first
[56:43] and you fall deeper in love
[56:48] you don't mind me saying something
[56:50] brother
[56:51] this couple right here something
[56:52] happened a few weeks ago in the service
[56:55] i won't give the details to embarrass
[56:57] him but he doesn't mind me testifying
[56:59] god supernaturally
[57:01] brought this marriage back together
[57:03] and they are deeper in love today than
[57:05] they've ever been before after 17 years
[57:10] see
[57:11] you see this is not
[57:13] this is not just sermons friends this is
[57:16] not just do's and don'ts there's a power
[57:19] with the word of a king
[57:22] 17 years these guys been together and
[57:24] almost almost ended and god had a
[57:26] minister here and spoke just the right
[57:28] thing
[57:29] bang bang bang and they're more in love
[57:31] than they'd ever been i thank god for
[57:33] that
[57:35] follow god's counsel follow god's word
[57:38] you'll never be disappointed
[57:41] something deeper must happen in my life
[57:43] to hand over the authority of my life to
[57:44] what the prophet said to trust it to
[57:46] give the final say of what i would do or
[57:48] what i don't don't do in the word of god
[57:50] i'm not talking about your testimony
[57:52] today i'm just sharing my testing this
[57:54] is what happened to me i'm not going to
[57:55] hide the fact that at 16 years old there
[57:57] was such a a release of the authority of
[58:00] my life given to that word
[58:03] that i was looking for the littlest
[58:04] little hints from it and trusted it i'm
[58:07] going with it amen
[58:09] and i found god has a true answer to
[58:11] everything in my life
[58:13] there's a lot of other influences out
[58:14] there
[58:16] but he has a word
[58:18] for everything
[58:19] in my
[58:20] life
[58:22] in this generation god has a word i
[58:24] believe for everything in our lives but
[58:26] sometimes it takes a while to dig for it
[58:28] people don't want to dig
[58:31] you got to dig
[58:33] when you start a building you start with
[58:34] one shovel and you gotta start digging
[58:36] you gotta start you dig for things you
[58:38] gotta start researching the word and
[58:40] finding out what did god say about this
[58:42] it was amazing to me i'd find things
[58:44] that i wouldn't normally find everywhere
[58:47] i wouldn't normally think that it was in
[58:49] the word of god and i'd say i'm right
[58:50] i'm all over it i didn't know that he
[58:52] said that you know i was in the uh
[58:54] i was in the health food store the other
[58:56] day with mom and she had to get some
[58:58] stuff
[58:59] and uh so i was in the health food store
[59:01] she got out one of the um
[59:05] i don't know you know the person to give
[59:06] her advice you know some of the things
[59:08] that she was feeling going through she
[59:09] was going to get some herbs for it
[59:10] whatever what uh the homopathetic or
[59:13] doctor
[59:17] homeopathic homopathy okay
[59:24] just a tad of sarcasm
[59:30] that lady started to talk to her and so
[59:32] she addressed some things and i said
[59:34] some things and and what i was amazed to
[59:36] find is that in this store packed full
[59:38] of stuff there was like an herb or
[59:40] something that you could take for just
[59:41] about every that would affect every area
[59:44] of your body
[59:46] and it wasn't
[59:48] a synthetic the the
[59:50] medicines which you know they're very
[59:52] critical of and i thank god for all
[59:53] things he gives us but these things are
[59:55] better for you than taking the medicines
[59:57] and so sometimes we have to take the
[59:58] medicines and that's fine but but you
[1:00:00] know she was so she was calling this
[1:00:03] homopathic doctor
[1:00:05] was calling that stuff poison i mean
[1:00:07] this is where she is
[1:00:08] when you're going to stop taking that
[1:00:10] poison for your blood pressure and start
[1:00:11] taking something natural because god
[1:00:14] through the earth has
[1:00:16] created things and it's amazing to be
[1:00:19] everybody well i'm having trouble with
[1:00:21] my knees and she walks over there and
[1:00:25] she's she's going to a certain section
[1:00:27] for your knees
[1:00:28] and then mom and you know she's had a
[1:00:30] little trouble with her liver so she yes
[1:00:32] right over here and i'm going i'm
[1:00:33] sitting there thinking do they have a
[1:00:35] pill for every part of your body
[1:00:39] and then i'm thinking i i didn't ask her
[1:00:41] i was gonna think
[1:00:42] how first i was gonna ask her how many
[1:00:44] pills are you taking every morning
[1:00:49] i didn't ask but i thought
[1:00:51] how many pills can you take every day
[1:00:53] because i mean i want it all i mean i
[1:00:55] want every part of my body every part to
[1:00:58] be affected i want it to be healthy you
[1:01:00] know
[1:01:01] i'm already taking you know
[1:01:03] 10 of them every morning how am i going
[1:01:05] to get all this in but anyway i'm being
[1:01:07] sarcastic but here's what it is if the
[1:01:09] natural traits are spiritual
[1:01:12] all you healthy people don't think i'm
[1:01:14] preaching against that this morning i'm
[1:01:15] for it because what i learned is that if
[1:01:17] they've got something that's not poison
[1:01:19] and not that and that can affect that
[1:01:21] that helps somebody which mom's already
[1:01:23] being helped by what she's taken praise
[1:01:25] the lord
[1:01:26] but but see this is a type because the
[1:01:29] world has hits what it provides for you
[1:01:33] entertainment so whatever else
[1:01:36] sports
[1:01:37] you can't replace sports for your
[1:01:40] craving for god
[1:01:44] don't do it don't teach your children to
[1:01:45] do it
[1:01:47] no that there's only one thing that
[1:01:48] meets that craving
[1:01:52] but if they have something like that
[1:01:54] then that told me i was saying i'm
[1:01:56] getting ready to preach this series and
[1:01:57] i said that's it i said
[1:01:59] then god has to have
[1:02:01] everything in his word
[1:02:05] every question that i have everything
[1:02:08] that i go through
[1:02:09] every little detail of life my finances
[1:02:12] and everything he's got to have
[1:02:14] something there that will give me
[1:02:16] direction
[1:02:18] and before all the financial advisors
[1:02:21] come up with stuff before all the
[1:02:23] worldly wisdom was out there god was
[1:02:26] before the wisdom of this world
[1:02:28] boy i better move on here now my
[1:02:30] goodness
[1:02:32] can you pull up that first quote
[1:02:34] so here's here's some examples okay it's
[1:02:37] gonna get real
[1:02:39] ah sticky here
[1:02:41] real what should i call it i've got a
[1:02:42] real rubber meets the road that's the
[1:02:44] type of preacher i am so everybody put
[1:02:46] your seat belts on all right
[1:02:50] so when i started to feed on the word
[1:02:51] now i could read you a million of these
[1:02:53] quotes
[1:02:54] but that's the stuff i'd find you
[1:02:56] fathers you mothers are you ready to
[1:02:58] establish an altar in your house
[1:03:00] and take that television out
[1:03:02] are you ready to take that deck of cards
[1:03:04] off the table
[1:03:07] them comic books that your children's
[1:03:09] reading
[1:03:10] preparing their little minds for a blast
[1:03:13] that the devil's going to give them are
[1:03:16] you ready to establish the old family
[1:03:18] altar again
[1:03:19] or do you just want to continue
[1:03:21] on the way that you are it's just a
[1:03:23] paragraph
[1:03:25] it's saying a lot
[1:03:26] like i told you i got direction in this
[1:03:28] first of all i was 16 years old i got
[1:03:32] direction how to be a father how to lead
[1:03:33] a home
[1:03:35] you got to read those children the word
[1:03:36] of god you got to establish the old
[1:03:38] family altar in the home again
[1:03:40] and if i'm going to be a father mother
[1:03:42] are you ready to establish that altar in
[1:03:45] your house you can't just have an
[1:03:46] alternate church you've got to have an
[1:03:47] altar in your house
[1:03:49] you've got to prayer with your family
[1:03:51] and your marriage if you don't have any
[1:03:52] kids you and your marriage your wife
[1:03:54] your family so this is teaching me it's
[1:03:56] given me the king's cues
[1:03:58] for how to live
[1:04:00] and establish his kingdom in my home
[1:04:08] take that television out
[1:04:10] and a lot of the reason that he
[1:04:12] is speaking these things because was
[1:04:14] initially when television came out
[1:04:17] there was no filter on it there was
[1:04:18] nothing on there that was good it
[1:04:20] couldn't be used for something good
[1:04:22] there's one comedy he made he said if
[1:04:24] the god would have got a hold of it it
[1:04:26] would have been the greatest instrument
[1:04:27] for the gospel the television
[1:04:29] so now it becomes about what's on it
[1:04:33] not so much the instrument of it but
[1:04:35] when he speaks of it it looks like he's
[1:04:37] talking about the instrument but if if
[1:04:39] that were true it was the instrument
[1:04:41] uh and the actual screen
[1:04:44] then none of you should be watching
[1:04:45] these quotes on these big tvs right here
[1:04:47] this morning
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:51] but it's not about the instrument
[1:04:53] it's about what you put on it
[1:04:57] we talked about getting it out you
[1:04:59] better get out of your home
[1:05:01] the wrong things that are on things like
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:05] is that okay with everybody
[1:05:07] are you ready to take the deck of cards
[1:05:09] off the table wow
[1:05:10] them comic books that your children are
[1:05:12] ringing now comic books and i went back
[1:05:14] and looked at this is 1963 and i said
[1:05:18] comic books how bad were they in 1963
[1:05:21] and i went back and you know it was
[1:05:22] amazing to find the comic books that
[1:05:24] brother branham is saying you let your
[1:05:26] children feed on those comic books in
[1:05:29] 1963 it's preparing their little minds
[1:05:32] for a blast the devil's going to get
[1:05:35] them
[1:05:37] most time i read that to people you
[1:05:39] might even be laughing yourself if
[1:05:40] you're hearing on the internet or
[1:05:41] whatever you might be laughing at this
[1:05:43] comment from this prophet in 1963 from
[1:05:45] brother branham you might laugh at this
[1:05:47] comment but sometimes it takes time to
[1:05:50] see the effects to see that's exactly
[1:05:52] the truth
[1:05:54] and you're a parent to watch over the
[1:05:56] minds of your children and he's hitting
[1:05:58] at these comic books
[1:05:59] that was amazing to me in 1963 it's
[1:06:03] spider-man
[1:06:04] it's incredible hulk it's the marvel
[1:06:07] avengers
[1:06:10] in comic form and does anybody know that
[1:06:13] now they've taken those
[1:06:15] heroes
[1:06:16] and making movies out of them now
[1:06:19] i don't know i haven't seen one of them
[1:06:20] but all these names i see pop up the
[1:06:23] avengers and marvel series and the the
[1:06:26] new one and the girls were telling me
[1:06:28] yesterday that the new one is specific
[1:06:30] about seven days before a tribulation
[1:06:33] sets in so now all these things
[1:06:35] preparing their minds preparing their
[1:06:37] minds for what for tribulation
[1:06:43] i'm prepared for it to get quiet this
[1:06:45] morning because i know that nobody's
[1:06:48] talking about these things not hardly
[1:06:49] any preachers are talking about them but
[1:06:51] i'm telling you all i needed was a
[1:06:53] prophet and a man of god who lived a
[1:06:56] holy life to say to me and it's not
[1:06:58] about the man i feel like he's given me
[1:07:00] something to establish the kingdom of
[1:07:03] god in my home if i'm going to keep the
[1:07:06] avengers and let my kids minds fill up
[1:07:08] with that then i'm jeopardizing the
[1:07:11] kingdom being in my home and it'll be a
[1:07:13] kingdom of the avengers
[1:07:16] it'll be the heroes of the incredible
[1:07:18] hawk
[1:07:21] instead of the heroes of the bible
[1:07:25] so i at 16 17 years old i'm saying lord
[1:07:28] thank you when i have children i'm going
[1:07:30] to watch over those things it's not
[1:07:32] going to be any comic book or any cards
[1:07:35] or any kind of thing played or anything
[1:07:37] god help me because i am not interested
[1:07:39] in preparing their little minds
[1:07:42] for what the devil's going to give them
[1:07:45] i don't need to hassle with that i don't
[1:07:47] need to argue with that i don't need to
[1:07:49] laugh at that i don't need to have i
[1:07:51] need i don't need to go research it any
[1:07:53] further
[1:07:55] i don't need to verify it
[1:07:57] there's a man of god saying it
[1:08:00] and then when you're growing the lord
[1:08:01] you go back
[1:08:02] and find scriptures
[1:08:04] set no evil thing before you
[1:08:08] avoid the very appearance of evil and
[1:08:11] you think those scriptures don't apply
[1:08:12] to all these comic books and things of
[1:08:14] the world yes they do
[1:08:17] but a prophet is saying it in our own
[1:08:18] language so we understand how to
[1:08:20] establish the kingdom and the only way
[1:08:22] to establish the kingdom is for us to be
[1:08:24] obedient to the word of god
[1:08:32] it doesn't come on brother paul that
[1:08:34] doesn't have effect
[1:08:36] on the mind
[1:08:41] those comic books from knight c can have
[1:08:43] an effect
[1:08:44] the devil can use that
[1:08:47] but i'm sure he couldn't use the video
[1:08:49] games that are out today
[1:08:54] i believe that you should stay away from
[1:08:55] those comic books but the stuff that i'm
[1:08:57] feeding on
[1:08:58] it doesn't affect me
[1:09:00] the comics of 1963
[1:09:03] can have an effect on the mind
[1:09:05] but not assassin's creed
[1:09:08] not the legend of zelda
[1:09:11] not the curse of the dead gods
[1:09:14] not grand theft auto
[1:09:17] not world of demons
[1:09:22] i'm fine i'm neutral with it it's fun
[1:09:25] you're fun with the world of demons it's
[1:09:28] called the world of demons
[1:09:30] it blatantly tells you what world you're
[1:09:32] in
[1:09:34] and you're fine with it
[1:09:37] you may need the holy ghost
[1:09:45] 63 comics are bad but there's nothing
[1:09:47] wrong with
[1:09:49] a video game called stronghold warlords
[1:09:54] one called no more heroes
[1:09:57] what a lie
[1:10:00] good
[1:10:05] that doesn't affect the mind at all
[1:10:07] i'm sure it doesn't
[1:10:09] even though
[1:10:11] all of science now is speaking that it
[1:10:13] does affect the mind
[1:10:15] it caused suicide it's caused breakup
[1:10:19] from marriage had one in my own family
[1:10:21] not here but another family member just
[1:10:23] about destroyed the marriage of him
[1:10:25] sitting and feeding on his video games
[1:10:27] didn't want to go to work didn't want to
[1:10:29] eat didn't want to give relation to his
[1:10:31] wife didn't want to do anything but play
[1:10:33] the video game that's called an
[1:10:35] addiction and i've got a blood of jesus
[1:10:37] christ that can deliver you from all
[1:10:39] addictions
[1:10:42] i'm here to tell you it does affect your
[1:10:45] mind it does affect your spirit
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:49] and the reason you keep dabbling in it
[1:10:51] is because you don't have something to
[1:10:54] turn over the authority in your life to
[1:10:56] the king jesus and when you do things
[1:10:59] are going to get a lot better can you
[1:11:00] say amen
[1:11:01] i was a young pastor and i was asked if
[1:11:03] it's okay i'm going to ask you this
[1:11:06] special congregation today would
[1:11:08] somebody please give me about 20 more
[1:11:10] minutes
[1:11:12] if you have to go you got something
[1:11:13] going or whatever just you you're
[1:11:15] dismissed you can go
[1:11:17] um but i'm asking for that because
[1:11:20] i've preached this series for three
[1:11:22] sundays
[1:11:23] trying to get to this
[1:11:26] and i'm staying here until i get it done
[1:11:31] that's terrible isn't it
[1:11:35] you ever heard a minister say that i'll
[1:11:36] tell you it's terrible
[1:11:39] man this keem this oil keeps falling off
[1:11:41] my pulpit when i
[1:11:42] hit it real hard so now
[1:11:45] i was asked
[1:11:46] if it was okay young pastor
[1:11:49] been pastoring
[1:11:51] 30 plenty years i think and i was asked
[1:11:53] if it was okay for a man and woman to
[1:11:55] drink a little
[1:11:56] drink together a little alcohol together
[1:11:58] with one another maybe a little social
[1:12:00] drink
[1:12:01] and as a young pastor i was asked a lot
[1:12:03] of other things too
[1:12:05] and guess what i didn't have a clue what
[1:12:07] to tell them
[1:12:09] when i first started passing i wasn't
[1:12:11] married
[1:12:12] so i got to ask a lot of questions that
[1:12:13] i had to defer
[1:12:15] to someone else
[1:12:17] i got to ask a lot of things some things
[1:12:18] i was very surprised some things i said
[1:12:21] i'm going to leave that alone
[1:12:23] but i was asked that question is it
[1:12:24] right for christian to just you know not
[1:12:26] to be out here in the bars and all that
[1:12:27] but just you know for a man and woman to
[1:12:29] take a little drink together
[1:12:33] and i never thought of that before i'd
[1:12:35] never thought of
[1:12:36] god got me early so i didn't get
[1:12:38] involved in
[1:12:40] drinking and all these other things
[1:12:42] i never thought of a social drink where
[1:12:44] it's more social
[1:12:46] and
[1:12:47] i just thought we all knew as christians
[1:12:50] that
[1:12:51] that is
[1:12:53] when you do that it's actually bearing
[1:12:56] the image of the world that's what they
[1:12:57] do
[1:12:58] so i just common sense says whatever
[1:13:00] they do we probably want to do the
[1:13:02] opposite
[1:13:04] they have a little social drink with
[1:13:05] their wife but i said i figured what we
[1:13:07] do is different because we're christians
[1:13:09] and we're different and that was the
[1:13:10] simple thing but sometimes that's not a
[1:13:11] good enough answer you know but that's
[1:13:13] the way i thought about and you know the
[1:13:15] thing is is that set aside the alcohol
[1:13:17] it's the image of what the world does
[1:13:19] set aside the alcohol in it
[1:13:22] it's not really about the alcohol
[1:13:25] because some of you have more alcohol in
[1:13:26] your nyquil
[1:13:40] so it can't be about just the alcohol
[1:13:44] because you could order a non-alcoholic
[1:13:47] you could do but you see now it's not
[1:13:49] about that just like it's not about the
[1:13:51] tv technically
[1:13:53] it's about the image of the world and we
[1:13:56] christians don't want to bear the image
[1:13:58] of the world
[1:14:02] it's just that it's just that we're
[1:14:04] we're we're through with saying god i'm
[1:14:06] from your kingdom now and a lot of
[1:14:08] things you find in the message is about
[1:14:10] that people struggle with it why did
[1:14:12] brother ram say that right this that and
[1:14:13] the other but you see now it's about
[1:14:15] it's i'm going to show you a quote in a
[1:14:16] minute it's not about god god's prophet
[1:14:18] calling you something you think he
[1:14:20] called me this because i'm doing this
[1:14:22] it's not that it's what it can lead to
[1:14:24] it's the image of it it's the testimony
[1:14:26] i teach our young people you got a good
[1:14:28] testimony now hold on to your testimony
[1:14:30] as a christian your testimony is
[1:14:32] everything it's not about how much money
[1:14:34] you make what do you want to be known
[1:14:36] for in this world what do you want your
[1:14:39] testimony to be
[1:14:40] and for me as a young man i want to give
[1:14:43] the best representation of what a
[1:14:45] christian looks like as i can
[1:14:49] and that would not be with a martini in
[1:14:52] my hand
[1:14:54] socially
[1:15:01] this is the quote amongst many of them
[1:15:03] and that private life oh that's a great
[1:15:05] thing now you know we want our own
[1:15:07] private life if we want a
[1:15:09] social drink with a neighbor that's our
[1:15:11] business
[1:15:12] if we want
[1:15:14] if we women want to cut our hair that's
[1:15:16] what that's our own american privilege
[1:15:18] if we want to wear shorts and all that's
[1:15:20] true that is your american privilege i'm
[1:15:22] not talking about your american
[1:15:24] privilege i'm talking about a kingdom
[1:15:26] where a people is coming under the
[1:15:28] preeminence of what the king says
[1:15:31] i'm talking about daughters of god and
[1:15:32] say i have the right to cut my hair but
[1:15:35] what's the king say
[1:15:37] what's the word say
[1:15:40] go ahead and do it if you feel
[1:15:42] there was a girl i tell you tell her
[1:15:43] about sometimes so the girl young girl
[1:15:45] on our church said i just can't stand i
[1:15:47] want to go i don't i want to feel what
[1:15:49] it's like to go get a bikini on and go
[1:15:51] to the beach i want to do it i just and
[1:15:53] my wife just said well go do it
[1:15:55] go get a bikini and get on the beach
[1:16:00] what terrible advice
[1:16:03] but you wanted it so bad well go do it
[1:16:05] you can do what you want
[1:16:08] and she went and did it come back a few
[1:16:09] months later
[1:16:11] that's not what i want
[1:16:13] that was terrible please forgive me god
[1:16:15] forgive me
[1:16:16] see if you've got something else
[1:16:18] resonating on the inside you try to be
[1:16:20] like the world and their image
[1:16:22] and you come to the conclusion
[1:16:24] i wasn't called to that
[1:16:26] i was called to this kingdom
[1:16:29] some of you need to decide that
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:33] it's my american privilege to do that am
[1:16:34] i american i'm not my private life
[1:16:36] listen
[1:16:37] but out of it you're probably saying to
[1:16:38] that to me some of you this morning said
[1:16:40] you know what i'm ready to get up and
[1:16:41] get out of here this guy's probing into
[1:16:42] my private life here i'm sorry to do
[1:16:44] that but god will do it even more than i
[1:16:47] will because if you come in his kingdom
[1:16:49] your private light is not yours anymore
[1:16:51] i'm not talking about your american
[1:16:53] privilege i'm talking about a people who
[1:16:55] releases and hands over the authority of
[1:16:57] right and wrong
[1:16:59] to the word of god
[1:17:01] case closed that's it he has the final
[1:17:03] say of what i do and i went to that
[1:17:05] couple and i read them several of these
[1:17:07] quotes and i said probably from the word
[1:17:10] of god he discourages a social drink you
[1:17:13] do what you want but if you're coming
[1:17:14] under god's word this is my answer for
[1:17:16] you later on
[1:17:18] praise the lord
[1:17:19] you still with me
[1:17:21] later on in the church god sent a family
[1:17:23] to us
[1:17:25] a dad and mom were broken up
[1:17:27] about ready to lose their marriage
[1:17:30] they were on the verge of divorce
[1:17:32] this happened many years ago
[1:17:35] and the man gave his heart back to god
[1:17:37] fully gave his heart back to god and in
[1:17:39] his giving his heart back to god because
[1:17:41] his problem was alcohol he said to god
[1:17:44] lord if you'll restore my marriage i'll
[1:17:46] never put another drop to my lips ever
[1:17:50] again
[1:17:52] and he made that commitment
[1:17:54] and god did it in his life
[1:17:56] god gave him his marriage back together
[1:17:59] god gave him his family and he's our
[1:18:01] sunday school superintendent him and his
[1:18:03] wife are sitting in the back brother
[1:18:05] mike and sister dawn right there
[1:18:17] that wasn't about just salvation
[1:18:20] that was about a man saying
[1:18:22] what's the king say
[1:18:24] and i'm making a commitment to what the
[1:18:25] word says
[1:18:27] got his family back
[1:18:29] because there's power in the word of the
[1:18:31] king
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:38] i think we ought to decide on some of
[1:18:40] this stuff who we are as christians and
[1:18:42] quit looking for loopholes all the time
[1:18:45] why do we keep looking for loopholes or
[1:18:47] what to wear and what to dress right
[1:18:49] someone that's looking for the loopholes
[1:18:50] and what's this under and can i wear
[1:18:52] this and i you know
[1:18:54] can i bring it up a little bit and i
[1:18:56] mean
[1:18:57] i i i'd like to take a service on
[1:18:59] modesty from a different perspective
[1:19:01] maybe
[1:19:02] from the word of god from a different
[1:19:03] perspective because i just asked a
[1:19:05] question
[1:19:06] why are we as christians always looking
[1:19:08] for loopholes all the time
[1:19:12] hashtag borderline believers
[1:19:15] [Laughter]
[1:19:22] i was asked a few years ago to do a
[1:19:24] wedding and they wanted to have dancing
[1:19:26] at the reception
[1:19:29] i said
[1:19:30] i said what
[1:19:31] it's difficult for me to understand
[1:19:33] after being under the influence of this
[1:19:34] word that's all my life
[1:19:36] today friends it's my testimony it's
[1:19:38] your testimony may be different i can
[1:19:40] show you in the bible where someone
[1:19:41] rebelled most of their life and many
[1:19:44] against the true word of god but guess
[1:19:46] what finally god got a hold of him and
[1:19:48] they came back under his headship
[1:19:52] so your testimony may be different
[1:19:54] you may be coming back even this morning
[1:19:56] to the lord and i thank god for that
[1:20:00] that you give me this time hour and a
[1:20:02] half to listen to me thank you so much
[1:20:04] god bless you for it i'm just asking to
[1:20:06] go home and ponder these things
[1:20:08] but i i was asked years ago will you do
[1:20:10] this and we're going to have we're
[1:20:12] dancing at the
[1:20:13] the daughter wants to dance with the dad
[1:20:17] i said you know it's just difficult and
[1:20:18] i thought i've been feeding on the
[1:20:20] message here now about for 10 years and
[1:20:21] the word of god and i just it was hard
[1:20:23] to bring that past the filter you know i
[1:20:26] didn't have dancing at my wedding it was
[1:20:27] out of the question
[1:20:28] it's another one of those things it's
[1:20:30] just the image of the world i want to do
[1:20:31] it
[1:20:32] the girl probably seen it on pinterest
[1:20:34] and
[1:20:37] no that's that's the gospel now it's
[1:20:39] pinterest
[1:20:40] it's the way to do it that's the way to
[1:20:42] decorate your home
[1:20:45] dance with dad and i wasn't against that
[1:20:46] part of it i think that was an
[1:20:48] affectionate thing but i had to stick
[1:20:49] with the word so here's the quote that i
[1:20:50] found that's what too many so christians
[1:20:53] do
[1:20:54] so-called christians do sharing your
[1:20:55] love with the world
[1:20:56] playing
[1:20:59] dancing
[1:21:00] gambling
[1:21:02] staying home from prayer meetings to
[1:21:03] watch television
[1:21:06] all kinds of worldly things that took
[1:21:07] the place of the love of god in the
[1:21:09] church's heart
[1:21:10] she's gone on a tantrum she's gone wild
[1:21:12] she's gone out there after other men
[1:21:15] she is sharing
[1:21:17] her love
[1:21:20] i got my answers
[1:21:23] and whether the person chooses or not
[1:21:26] i have a responsibility to share the
[1:21:28] word of god i went to some scriptures i
[1:21:30] went to the message they were coming to
[1:21:31] my church okay
[1:21:33] i said we we stand for the message of
[1:21:36] the last days here
[1:21:38] we believe what god has brought
[1:21:41] don't follow a man but we follow a word
[1:21:45] that brings us back to the original word
[1:21:50] don't let that lie coming we don't
[1:21:52] follow a man here only man we follow is
[1:21:54] the lord jesus christ the word the king
[1:21:56] what about shorts
[1:21:58] on men what about shorts on men
[1:22:04] thank you
[1:22:09] she was saying till we meet and just
[1:22:10] close the service now keep going
[1:22:13] might as well finish it out now
[1:22:15] all right josh
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:19] so i read those things and so i made a
[1:22:21] decision i said okay you know i got some
[1:22:23] things he said here and he refers to
[1:22:25] sissies so i said you know what i don't
[1:22:27] think he's calling me a but i i'm
[1:22:29] not going to wear shorts in public and
[1:22:31] i'm not even
[1:22:32] we're going to wear very much in private
[1:22:35] in my home galley venting around i'm
[1:22:36] just going to stick close to that now
[1:22:38] this isn't just a heaven or hell issue i
[1:22:40] mean this isn't a thing
[1:22:42] to get into a big argument of the
[1:22:44] technical stuff and you find me a black
[1:22:47] and white scripture about that or you
[1:22:49] find i i don't want to get into all that
[1:22:51] it's just i i got the cue
[1:22:54] from the king
[1:22:57] and so you know i can make a choice i
[1:22:59] can make my own choice yeah you have an
[1:23:00] american right to make your own choice
[1:23:02] so when i when i go swimming somewhere
[1:23:04] and there's a swimming hole yeah i'm
[1:23:06] going to put on a pair of shorts i'm
[1:23:07] going to go swimming i don't want to
[1:23:08] wear my jeans you can do that if you
[1:23:10] want but i don't like to wear and my
[1:23:11] jeans get all heavy and stuff and so i
[1:23:14] might put on a pair of shorts to go
[1:23:16] swimming in a swimming hole somewhere or
[1:23:17] whatever
[1:23:19] but i don't make it a practice of just
[1:23:21] gallivanting around and i'll tell you
[1:23:23] why i have a right to do it
[1:23:25] um but i'm gonna read you what the
[1:23:27] prophet said about it
[1:23:30] next quote why is it that we make this
[1:23:32] is uh probably a woman asking this
[1:23:34] question brother branham why is it that
[1:23:35] we make so much of a big issue of
[1:23:37] women's dress and cutting of hair and
[1:23:40] nothing said about the hair of a man or
[1:23:42] the way he dresses
[1:23:44] it's a good question isn't it
[1:23:47] good question
[1:23:48] because he says a lot about things and
[1:23:50] he explains a little bit why there's
[1:23:52] more about the women than the men
[1:23:53] there's more in the bible about the
[1:23:55] woman's
[1:23:56] position the women's
[1:23:58] dress than there is for men
[1:24:02] well sister i'm going to agree with you
[1:24:04] one thing first place the bible said
[1:24:05] that a man should not have long hair and
[1:24:07] if he had long hair i'll tell him just
[1:24:09] the same as i tell you he's wrong
[1:24:11] but most men a lot of them like me don't
[1:24:13] have any at all
[1:24:17] but most men cut their hair look like
[1:24:19] men and now if they didn't do it they'd
[1:24:21] be told not to do so to leave their hair
[1:24:23] grow out like a woman's hair you'll get
[1:24:25] all of this in the marriage and divorce
[1:24:26] files and things that we preach on it
[1:24:27] now a man the first place a man's body
[1:24:30] is not a temptation like a woman so he's
[1:24:33] explaining why there's not as much in
[1:24:35] there for the man's dress as the woman's
[1:24:38] dress and salman and i were having a
[1:24:40] good conversation about today how that
[1:24:42] whole culture has changed today and
[1:24:44] there's a huge emphasis on how grooming
[1:24:47] the man and you know just doing going
[1:24:49] and spending 70 80 dollars and he's
[1:24:51] doing all this manicure and all this and
[1:24:53] i'm going
[1:24:54] there's something fishy going on there
[1:24:57] but culture has changed it now the man
[1:24:59] is emphasizing his body and his haircut
[1:25:01] what the way he's doing it and the tight
[1:25:04] pants and
[1:25:05] you know to the women now it increases
[1:25:08] sexual lust where you wouldn't normally
[1:25:10] lust after a man but now lust is lost
[1:25:12] and so now the man becomes a way that
[1:25:14] the woman actually lust after him
[1:25:16] culture's changed
[1:25:20] but you see now
[1:25:22] uh he says the first place a man's body
[1:25:25] is not a temptation like a woman now
[1:25:27] he's big
[1:25:28] old hairy legs
[1:25:30] knock kneed pot tummied
[1:25:35] he's a horrible looking mess
[1:25:38] and there's nothing about him for
[1:25:40] temptation
[1:25:41] guys
[1:25:42] just keep it that way okay
[1:25:44] prophet said that's what we look like
[1:25:46] and and i i'm described there perfectly
[1:25:48] with including the pot tummy
[1:25:52] and a lot of you are too so don't try to
[1:25:55] improve on what the prophet said you
[1:25:57] look like just
[1:25:58] leave it alone be rough be a man
[1:26:01] try to use some deodorant sometimes
[1:26:05] try to get your beard cleaned you know
[1:26:07] try to groom yourself a little bit and
[1:26:09] smell nice but don't be going like this
[1:26:11] world and dress yourself up like some
[1:26:13] woman and all that just be
[1:26:15] what the prophet said you are the
[1:26:18] horriblest looking mess he's ever
[1:26:20] seen i think he looks the gamiest
[1:26:23] looking sight for these see these men
[1:26:25] come down the road young and old with a
[1:26:27] pair of these bikinis on over what it
[1:26:28] was talking about short shorts and you
[1:26:30] know walking down the road i think
[1:26:32] that's the dirtiest looking sight i ever
[1:26:34] looked at now when you're reading this
[1:26:35] and there's a lot of quotes like this
[1:26:37] when you're reading this it's like
[1:26:39] if you look at it cardinal you're going
[1:26:40] to start applying that he just look what
[1:26:42] he just told me about me in my shorts
[1:26:44] i'm the dirtiest looking you're going to
[1:26:45] take it personal but listen i'm going to
[1:26:47] keep reading i think that's the dirtiest
[1:26:49] looking side ever say that's right i
[1:26:50] think he don't know what side of the
[1:26:52] race he belongs to
[1:26:53] that's right
[1:26:55] a man that do a thing like that and you
[1:26:57] know what i just heard a few months ago
[1:26:59] the american army is going to dress that
[1:27:01] way yep the army's gum coming out next
[1:27:03] year and next year after all in shorts
[1:27:06] how big of a bunch of see how big a
[1:27:09] bunch of sissies can we get
[1:27:13] in the 1960s they integrated
[1:27:16] shorts in the military short shorts in
[1:27:18] the military and or longer shorts or
[1:27:21] short shorts and they integrate it
[1:27:22] because uh england had already had them
[1:27:24] many years since 1910 1920. they already
[1:27:27] had it so they took that cue we're going
[1:27:29] to put that on our men and you know i
[1:27:31] don't know maybe it's easier to work in
[1:27:33] i don't know what reasons they did but
[1:27:35] all i'm interested is in the the
[1:27:38] the the view of a prophet he's looking
[1:27:41] at that and i want to say to you
[1:27:43] probably not a lot of those men he's
[1:27:45] seen in the pictures are sissies yet
[1:27:48] but it's not about what they are it's
[1:27:50] about what direction we're heading
[1:27:54] i said this a couple weeks ago and
[1:27:56] somebody reminded me and and i think
[1:27:58] it's something to look at when we look
[1:27:59] at the message it's not when he slams
[1:28:01] and hits something so hard you're gonna
[1:28:03] why is he hitting that so hard it's not
[1:28:05] that you already have the spirit but if
[1:28:07] you continue in certain things you'll
[1:28:09] take a spirit from that you continue to
[1:28:11] feed on certain television shows you'll
[1:28:13] take a spirit from that show
[1:28:16] she said he called me a i didn't
[1:28:18] read that and him and call me a i
[1:28:20] didn't i didn't read that and take that
[1:28:21] from it but i certainly could take that
[1:28:24] the king was speaking that the lord was
[1:28:26] giving me cues here from his commandment
[1:28:28] is that i don't really want to go there
[1:28:30] so i have no problem come under the
[1:28:32] headship of the word of god and so now
[1:28:35] uh let's just make a point here let me
[1:28:37] just finish this uh our army's coming
[1:28:40] out with it next year how big how big a
[1:28:42] bunch of sissies can we get god made a
[1:28:44] man to look like a man and act like a
[1:28:46] man and dress like a man he made a woman
[1:28:48] to do the same to dress like a woman act
[1:28:51] like a woman and be like a woman
[1:28:54] that's the way the king made it can you
[1:28:56] say a man and he is driving he says now
[1:28:58] we got the men wearing her underneath
[1:29:01] clothes which is his shorts and she's
[1:29:03] wearing his britches
[1:29:05] that's the world we live in
[1:29:07] it's mixing it up and god says a man
[1:29:10] ought to dress like a man and a woman
[1:29:12] ought to dress like a woman there ought
[1:29:14] to be a distinction and that does not
[1:29:16] include britches on a woman
[1:29:19] bridges are for the man
[1:29:21] and underneath garments like shorts are
[1:29:23] for
[1:29:24] the woman
[1:29:28] i wonder if brother brown was catching
[1:29:30] something that was coming
[1:29:32] maybe it wasn't sissy's back then but
[1:29:33] look today now just 20 years ago when
[1:29:36] they had to deal with the homosexual
[1:29:38] issue in the military and they said
[1:29:40] we'll make a rule don't ask don't tell
[1:29:42] you can be that but just keep it to
[1:29:44] yourself under obama we got rid of that
[1:29:48] so that they could come out
[1:29:49] i wonder if the prophet in calling it
[1:29:51] sissies
[1:29:53] maybe had a little vision now our
[1:29:55] military becomes full
[1:30:00] of them
[1:30:02] just 50 years later interesting
[1:30:05] maybe none of those men were sissies but
[1:30:07] now we have sissies in the military
[1:30:11] and whether they wear the shorts or not
[1:30:12] they've taken a homosexual
[1:30:15] feminine spirit
[1:30:17] and we got guys like that fighting in
[1:30:19] our army
[1:30:20] god have mercy
[1:30:23] we don't have real men like we should
[1:30:25] have real men fighting in our military
[1:30:29] i wonder if we've seen further he's
[1:30:30] warning us don't go there
[1:30:33] pull that picture up anybody know who
[1:30:35] this is
[1:30:36] this is two weeks ago
[1:30:39] i have to get up here to see your name
[1:30:42] i wonder if the prophet could see where
[1:30:43] things were going rachel levine
[1:30:46] the nation's most senior transgender
[1:30:48] official
[1:30:49] made history again tuesday by becoming
[1:30:52] the first openly transgender four
[1:30:55] star
[1:30:56] officer
[1:30:57] across any of the country's eight
[1:30:59] informed services levine the assistant
[1:31:01] secretary of health was sworn in tuesday
[1:31:03] this is two weeks ago as an admirable
[1:31:06] the highest ranking official
[1:31:09] of the u.s
[1:31:11] military public health service
[1:31:13] commission corps
[1:31:18] she's sworn in tuesday
[1:31:21] and i'm not going to even read what she
[1:31:22] said there
[1:31:24] you guys can take that picture down
[1:31:26] i'm not glorifying the world i'm trying
[1:31:28] to show you could it be
[1:31:31] that god
[1:31:32] sent a word
[1:31:33] from the king
[1:31:35] through the prophet
[1:31:37] this is where that's going and now you
[1:31:40] in 2021 can see
[1:31:42] it's not just homosexuals and sissies
[1:31:44] it's somebody who don't even know
[1:31:46] which one they are
[1:31:50] so they'll be both a commander
[1:31:52] elected the highest rank
[1:31:56] not just an not just one who joins
[1:31:59] military
[1:32:00] sergeant high commander
[1:32:03] i think that this something to consider
[1:32:08] i think it's a way to look at the
[1:32:10] message the right way and the word the
[1:32:12] right way
[1:32:14] about pornography
[1:32:16] i'll do one more and then we'll close
[1:32:24] i'm going to take a service someday when
[1:32:25] the lord
[1:32:27] gives me the green light i'm going to
[1:32:28] take a whole service on pornography
[1:32:33] and the reason it is the devil has so
[1:32:34] many people bound right
[1:32:38] and i'm not going to let it go
[1:32:43] it's out to destroy
[1:32:45] families lives men's minds
[1:32:49] young girls young guys
[1:32:53] seven eight nine years old are you
[1:32:55] reading the curriculums that's already
[1:32:57] being taught in the public schools
[1:33:00] does anybody know that the battle is
[1:33:02] increased now with
[1:33:03] all of a sudden parents during cohort
[1:33:05] looking at what they're teaching their
[1:33:06] kids and fighting against it and saying
[1:33:08] what is going on what are you teaching
[1:33:10] my kids
[1:33:12] thank god somebody looked at it
[1:33:16] you read some of the stuff that's
[1:33:17] already in there that some of the
[1:33:18] questions and perverted questions
[1:33:20] they're asking five-year-old kids
[1:33:23] i'll tell you friends what satan's
[1:33:25] eating we live in what a perversion to
[1:33:28] raise our children in
[1:33:31] but i want to talk about it but i would
[1:33:33] just say i had questions come up we had
[1:33:36] things come up this is a relevant issue
[1:33:38] so oh this is a quote that i found years
[1:33:40] ago
[1:33:41] and the word pornography is not
[1:33:43] mentioned in the message but maybe it
[1:33:44] was maybe it was mentioned in the
[1:33:46] message maybe just the term pornography
[1:33:48] isn't in it but maybe we have another
[1:33:50] word for it
[1:33:52] and brother branham has asked a question
[1:33:53] in this quote but if they marry
[1:33:56] let them marry for it's better to marry
[1:33:57] than to burn do you guys have that one
[1:34:00] it's better to marry than to burn
[1:34:01] so that's a scripture
[1:34:03] paul's talking about first corinthians 7
[1:34:05] fornication we talked about that friday
[1:34:07] night in the youth meeting this week had
[1:34:09] a great conversation with the youth
[1:34:11] about it open conversation
[1:34:12] but paul says
[1:34:14] if they cannot contain let them go ahead
[1:34:16] and get married for it's better than to
[1:34:18] just burn in their lust for one another
[1:34:20] that's right just for just dirty living
[1:34:22] instead of a man or a boy or girl
[1:34:24] something or another when they're going
[1:34:25] together and they know that they should
[1:34:27] be married go ahead and get married i
[1:34:29] think you'd understand what i mean don't
[1:34:30] you know what he's talking about he's
[1:34:32] saying that they're going to go on and
[1:34:34] play around with each other and live
[1:34:36] dirty with one other before they're
[1:34:37] married they need to go ahead and get
[1:34:39] married the best case scenario is they
[1:34:41] both get filled with the holy spirit of
[1:34:42] god they get some convictions about them
[1:34:45] and they wait
[1:34:46] to do anything until their wedding day
[1:34:50] i'm here to tell you if you will honor
[1:34:52] god young people god will honor you and
[1:34:54] your marriage
[1:34:55] if you've made mistakes come to the
[1:34:57] blood of jesus come to the altar today
[1:34:59] and say god forgive me for what i've
[1:35:02] done and god will turn things around but
[1:35:04] listen i have the opportunity to speak
[1:35:05] to you young people this is what this
[1:35:07] word says it says for even uh
[1:35:09] instructional ministers say if you're
[1:35:11] gonna keep doing these things and keep
[1:35:12] burning in just a lust lust is not a
[1:35:15] good foundation for your marriage but if
[1:35:17] you're going to keep doing it you better
[1:35:18] go ahead and get married because it's
[1:35:19] better for you to be married than you
[1:35:21] just just to be living a dirty life you
[1:35:24] should just legally get married and that
[1:35:25] that's the basis of your marriage is sex
[1:35:28] go right ahead and see how that goes
[1:35:33] and they know that they should be
[1:35:34] married go ahead and get married i think
[1:35:36] you'd understand what i mean next one
[1:35:38] don't just live a dirty little life
[1:35:39] because it's not right you see that's
[1:35:41] your sister in one sense if you're a
[1:35:43] christian now it's if it's the world
[1:35:45] it's the world dog eat dog but this girl
[1:35:47] that you're going with that's your
[1:35:48] sister too that will be the mother of
[1:35:50] your children that will come
[1:35:52] don't live a dirty little life around
[1:35:53] her show you that show her that you're a
[1:35:55] real christian gentleman live like a
[1:35:57] christian gentleman all to see and treat
[1:35:59] her like your sister and when you get
[1:36:01] married still treat her that way can i
[1:36:04] hear an amen from the brothers and
[1:36:05] sisters that are married when you get
[1:36:07] married you don't want to be an absalom
[1:36:09] that just takes the girl hows her and
[1:36:10] the next day he hates her and runs away
[1:36:12] from her sometimes brothers do that when
[1:36:14] they get married they got her they he
[1:36:16] got the prize he fought for the prize
[1:36:19] and then he's not she's not her
[1:36:20] sweetheart anymore you don't have a
[1:36:22] marriage there can you say man you don't
[1:36:24] have something solid to build on after
[1:36:27] you're married treat her that way still
[1:36:29] like a sister in christ first
[1:36:32] i might answer this right now i don't
[1:36:34] believe oh could we talk about
[1:36:36] pornography here i don't believe in
[1:36:38] filthy living among pentecostal people
[1:36:40] holiness people brother brown preached
[1:36:42] amongst all the pentecostals watch what
[1:36:43] happens
[1:36:45] even if they're married i don't believe
[1:36:47] in that now sir some of this little
[1:36:48] dirty stuff that's so horrible i get in
[1:36:51] here sometimes in this not this morning
[1:36:53] now no i ain't saying it but i mean on
[1:36:54] these times i'm out here in california
[1:36:56] and different places like that i meet
[1:36:58] ministers out there where in the
[1:37:00] discernment on the discernment
[1:37:02] on the discernment i feel like i could
[1:37:04] turn them over my knee
[1:37:06] and give a little gospel protoplasmic
[1:37:08] stimulation
[1:37:11] stop right there
[1:37:13] there's a prophet he sees things by
[1:37:14] vision gets amongst the pentecostal
[1:37:16] ministers and sometimes god shows him
[1:37:19] the dirty things that are going on
[1:37:22] behind the scenes and what they're
[1:37:24] making their wives do
[1:37:26] nobody else would see it you're not
[1:37:27] going to see it in church when they're
[1:37:28] shouting and dancing and speaking in
[1:37:30] tongues
[1:37:32] but the prophetic eye sees what's going
[1:37:33] on at home
[1:37:35] and he's he's not going to call names
[1:37:36] here but he said i'd like to just bend
[1:37:38] you over and give you just a good
[1:37:39] spiritual spanking
[1:37:41] you shouldn't be doing that
[1:37:43] that's terrible
[1:37:44] you're living a hypocritical life
[1:37:47] brother if you're on pornography this
[1:37:48] morning you're living a hypocritical
[1:37:50] life
[1:37:52] if you're tapping on that on your
[1:37:53] computer on your phone
[1:37:55] i'm encouraging you as a minister to get
[1:37:56] a hold of the horns of the altar because
[1:37:58] that's gonna that thing will destroy as
[1:38:00] the bible says who can touch fire and
[1:38:03] not get burnt you're playing with fire
[1:38:05] and the thing about a fire is the fire
[1:38:07] when it's controlled is a wonderful
[1:38:10] thing we can have a bonfire we can have
[1:38:13] the fireplace in our home but an
[1:38:15] uncontrolled fire will destroy your
[1:38:18] entire house
[1:38:20] sex is like a fire can you say amen if
[1:38:23] it's controlled and put in marriage in
[1:38:25] the right thing and pure praise the lord
[1:38:27] for it god endorses it once it comes
[1:38:29] outside of that it becomes a fire
[1:38:31] that'll destroy your marriage destroy
[1:38:34] your life listen to me as a minister
[1:38:36] come to the horns of the altar and say
[1:38:38] god sanctify me from this pornography
[1:38:47] i'd like to turn them over and give a
[1:38:48] gospel protoplasm stimulation yes my to
[1:38:50] see a man that would try to take his
[1:38:52] little wife and dirty and filthy that's
[1:38:55] you understand what i mean i think you
[1:38:56] ought to be ashamed of yourself as a man
[1:38:58] of god you just be a husband
[1:39:01] you be a sweetheart
[1:39:02] respect her like you always respect her

[1:39:12] and things that you read about
[1:39:14] did the prophet talk about pornography
[1:39:18] yes
[1:39:21] and everything like that
[1:39:23] get that filthy stuff out of your mind
[1:39:27] the bible said not let one dirty
[1:39:29] conversation come among you when you
[1:39:30] profess holiness it goes on to say treat
[1:39:32] that little lady like she's a little
[1:39:34] sweetheart if she's 60 years old you'd
[1:39:37] be just the same you'd be that gallant
