[9:20] second Samuel chapter 13 and verse 1 and
[9:22] it came to pass after this that Absalom
[9:24] the son of David had a fair sister
[9:27] whose name was Tamar and amnon the son
[9:30] of David loved her
[9:31] and amnon was so vexed that as we said a
[9:34] couple Sundays ago this couldn't be true
[9:36] love because he was Vex there's no
[9:37] vexation in true love
[9:39] and the amnam was so vexed that he fell
[9:42] sick for his sister Tamar for she was a
[9:45] virgin an amnon thought now we're into
[9:47] amnon's thinking what's in his mind
[9:49] amnon thought it hard for him to do
[9:53] anything to her amnon thought it was
[9:57] hard for him to get to her it was hard
[10:00] for him to get to her why was it hard to
[10:02] get to her why was it he wanted to do
[10:04] this thing with her but he found it hard
[10:06] why did he find it hard because God had
[10:10] put Protections in place
[10:12] and if he were going to do something he
[10:14] was going to override all of God's
[10:16] boundaries and protections to do what he
[10:18] wanted to do and I want to talk about
[10:20] Ammon in this text about amnon it's kind
[10:23] of a strange section of the scripture to
[10:26] read and take a little series on it but
[10:28] you'll see the reasons why after a while
[10:30] it's a strange text to pull subjects
[10:32] from amnon raped Tamar he he was in the
[10:37] kingdom of God he was they were both
[10:38] from David they were they were part of
[10:41] the Jewish belief system and the Jewish
[10:43] belief system had a lot of laws and
[10:46] boundaries in place there and amnon
[10:49] would have had to override all of these
[10:51] boundaries and all these Jewish laws he
[10:52] wasn't a heathen now he was in the
[10:54] church he heard all these laws he knew
[10:56] what to do and he gets in his mind he's
[10:58] going to override all these things and
[11:00] he ends up raping Tamar you will hear a
[11:02] thread of the subject in these things
[11:05] related to sexual perversion you're
[11:06] going to hear that pop up and I will try
[11:08] to talk about it as tactfully as I can
[11:10] but it's something Satan does not not
[11:13] want us to talk about pornography is
[11:15] something Satan does not want us to talk
[11:16] about to brothers and sisters sexual
[11:19] temptation is something that Satan does
[11:21] not want to talk about but it was it's
[11:23] one of the undercurrents that Satan uses
[11:25] to defeat men and women and families and
[11:28] it's one of the undercurrents and where
[11:31] sometimes it happens where a family is
[11:33] exposed and it all comes out that
[11:35] sometimes it happens but there's there's
[11:36] probably a bunch of other cases where it
[11:39] never comes out and just Satan keeps
[11:41] everybody defeated because it hasn't
[11:42] come out yet I'm here to stand to stand
[11:45] against the enemy to talk about it
[11:46] according to the word of God so that
[11:49] some people will get victory over these
[11:50] things there's been such an onslaught of
[11:52] social media and the wisdom of this
[11:54] world and people are changing their
[11:56] minds on the scripture and changing
[11:58] their minds on the way they used to
[12:00] believe and changing so so so it's
[12:02] changing our thinking so much that that
[12:05] it actually changed normal biology and
[12:08] now biology normal biology of the of a
[12:11] man and woman normal biology of a man or
[12:14] woman has to bow to psychology that's
[12:16] the way he said it biology has to bow to
[12:19] psychology in other words something
[12:21] that's normal and natural now he so
[12:24] fills the minds that the mind overrides
[12:27] even normal biology and the mind says
[12:29] you're not a woman you're a man you're
[12:30] not a man you're you're a woman because
[12:32] of the spirit that goes with that
[12:34] so now you have to look at not only that
[12:38] where he begins to mess with the mind
[12:40] and then that psychology is the study of
[12:42] the mind and thinking and how it affects
[12:44] behavior and so he's messing with the
[12:47] minds to make it number one question and
[12:49] mock the word of God Satan is messing
[12:52] with the world's minds and guess what
[12:54] he's trying to mess with our minds to
[12:56] change our perception of the word of God
[12:59] and question the word and mock the word
[13:01] and say the word is out of date I want
[13:04] to say after I've said all these things
[13:05] this morning the word is never out of
[13:08] date but what is the main healing we
[13:10] need today I can tell you we need a
[13:13] healing of the Mind
[13:15] everybody ever suggests a healing line
[13:17] for for mental illness
[13:21] we've got a lot of mental illness on
[13:23] different levels I'm not talking about a
[13:25] person who's who's got a mental problem
[13:27] in the sense of a special needs I'm
[13:30] talking if we feed on things all these
[13:32] years we're not thinking sound anymore
[13:34] we're not thinking straight anymore
[13:36] there's a lot of mental illness going in
[13:38] that's why we have medicines for that
[13:40] now but I want to remind the devil this
[13:42] morning that our atonement was not only
[13:45] for physical healing not only to heal
[13:47] cancer but in the atomity went to
[13:50] Calvary for is for mental illness as
[13:52] well
[13:53] because he said I've given you I'm not
[13:56] giving you the spirit of fear but of
[13:58] power and of love and of a sound mind
[14:00] people are not thinking straight anymore
[14:03] because they fed on too many things
[14:06] I encourage you put some of that stuff
[14:09] away and get into the word of God and
[14:11] let your mind be influenced by the word
[14:16] because if the balance of it is that
[14:17] you're feeding on social media in
[14:19] entertainments and a bunch of jokes and
[14:22] Tick Tock all these times and you're
[14:23] reading a little scripture with brother
[14:24] Paul Sunday mornings I can tell you your
[14:27] mind's going to be messed with
[14:29] your mind is going to be messed with
[14:31] even if it's decent stuff if that's all
[14:33] you feed on that's the mindset you keep
[14:36] and that's the way you start living
[14:38] time to lay some of that stuff down it's
[14:41] time to sanctify your life and say I'm
[14:44] going to give more to the word of God
[14:45] this mind is not a garbage can this nine
[14:48] is not for mush can you say Amen our
[14:51] bodies have become mush because of the
[14:53] foods we eat we're physically down
[14:56] because of the foods we eat how many
[14:57] know that but our minds have become mush
[15:00] too
[15:01] because we're what we're feeding on for
[15:04] amnon I want you to think deeply about
[15:05] admin here for amnon to carry out what
[15:08] he did in a rape
[15:10] it was a long time of his mind going
[15:13] unchecked
[15:15] and unaccountable
[15:17] there was a private feeding on things
[15:20] even if it was only his own Thoughts
[15:22] unchecked by the word of God it happened
[15:24] in his mind first
[15:27] now I don't think amnon in that day had
[15:30] they didn't have TVs they didn't have
[15:32] social media they didn't have
[15:34] pornography but something is something's
[15:37] going on there's no way that a boy could
[15:39] come to this point where his mind is
[15:42] going to is trying to think about ways
[15:44] to rape his half-sister without the mind
[15:48] being affected by something
[15:50] now the writers tell me because just two
[15:52] or three chapters earlier is when David
[15:55] himself fell in sin and if you think I'm
[15:58] going to talk about Adam to not go back
[15:59] to David because to me when you have a
[16:01] family some of this might have been a
[16:03] family situation that had taken over
[16:05] sexually and David's got dealt with by
[16:08] Nathan the prophet right but if that
[16:11] trickled down then it starts to go
[16:13] through the family
[16:15] and now you got a boy that's so messed
[16:17] up in his mind he's getting ready to
[16:19] find ways that he could be with his
[16:21] half-sister even if he has to rape her
[16:22] something happened and changed that
[16:24] boy's mind even living in a Jewish
[16:27] Community even being a son of David the
[16:30] king
[16:31] so listen now let's not be proud and say
[16:34] this stuff does not affect me I can I
[16:38] can click on this site I can do this I
[16:40] can listen to this mindset I can do this
[16:42] don't let's not be proud because they
[16:43] were in the Kingdom of David all of us
[16:45] would love to be in the Kingdom of David
[16:48] let's not get pride in the message and
[16:51] think this doesn't affect us I can
[16:53] dabble and it don't affect me it does
[16:55] affect us because our minds are just
[16:56] like everybody else's
[16:58] [Applause]
[17:00] I'm preaching to you I'm not preaching
[17:02] to somebody else I'm preaching to you
[17:04] your mind is just like their minds and
[17:07] if it's not submitted to God you're
[17:09] going to start living out what's been
[17:11] put in your mind in your thoughts
[17:14] amnon amnon here had to be unchecked and
[17:17] on accountable until it carried out what
[17:19] was there but here's the biggest deal
[17:22] that I want to preach today most never
[17:24] carry it out to that point of a rape
[17:29] I've seen a statistic last week that
[17:32] said less than one percent of sexually
[17:36] addicted people
[17:38] actually carried out to do an act
[17:42] it's all done in the realm of secrecy
[17:45] with their computer or their phone
[17:47] they're addicted they're Bound by it
[17:50] but it never goes as far as admin where
[17:52] he carries out a rape less than one
[17:54] percent carries it out
[17:56] you know when I read that you know what
[17:57] it told me that's the way the devil
[17:59] likes it
[18:01] because if it comes out then it's
[18:04] exposed you deal with it like David said
[18:06] Nathan dealt with it he lost a child
[18:09] over it of there's a big message but a
[18:11] lot of things don't come out and Satan
[18:13] likes that because it stays under
[18:16] under everything which means you stay
[18:19] Bound for years
[18:24] Satan does not like exposure
[18:27] sometimes it helps say oh my family
[18:30] we're going to be embarrassed this is
[18:31] going to come out sometimes it's better
[18:33] it comes out because sometimes there's a
[18:35] Deliverance
[18:37] but a lot of times there's not
[18:39] Deliverance when it's kept and nobody
[18:40] knows about it
[18:42] so he carried it out but less than one
[18:45] percent today carry out everything
[18:47] that's going on in their mind so they
[18:49] say completely Bound in their minds by
[18:52] what they fed on and they continue to do
[18:54] it not an act not adultery and that's
[18:56] why Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[18:59] woman to lust after has already
[19:01] committed adultery in his heart already
[19:04] he's bringing it to a heart level
[19:06] amnon was vexed with a lustful eye and a
[19:10] heart towards Tamar
[19:12] but the pitiful thing
[19:14] is here's how I get to he seen it was
[19:17] hard
[19:18] to get to her
[19:21] and begin looking for ways to get around
[19:24] this huge
[19:27] protective
[19:29] boundary or boundaries
[19:32] Godly things in place
[19:37] normal things that would protect this
[19:41] virgin this generation has been changed
[19:44] in its mindset against the word and
[19:46] against the the boundaries and
[19:48] protections and The Godly order that's
[19:51] been set in place for a woman for a man
[19:53] for a family for marriage everything
[19:56] there's been some boundaries set in
[19:58] order and we should never let Satan mess
[20:00] with our minds to change those
[20:02] boundaries we actually should be
[20:04] embracing them more than we ever have we
[20:06] all should we we need to be getting hold
[20:08] of the word and saying if this hour at
[20:11] this closing seconds of time judgments
[20:14] hanging two things days of Noah days of
[20:16] lot we see it now we see the full
[20:18] manifestation of the days of Life the
[20:20] spirit trying to take our children you
[20:22] know we should be doing I'm clinging
[20:23] into this word and this message closer
[20:25] than I've ever been before I want to
[20:28] know it I want the preacher to preach it
[20:30] I want it I want to open up this message
[20:33] to my children and I'm not afraid of any
[20:36] quotes I'm going to read the quotes to
[20:38] my kids some of your parents are afraid
[20:40] to do that because somebody's planted in
[20:42] your mind to be leery of this that's the
[20:44] devil that's told you that this is the
[20:46] thing God said to us to be delivered
[20:49] how in the world could this boy that was
[20:51] grown up in a Jewish home and in the
[20:54] Kingdom of David could ever think of
[20:56] it's so hard to get through the way that
[20:59] I want her how can I tear this down this
[21:01] is hard what's hard is a life of sin
[21:03] what's hard is living in the world with
[21:04] no correct of love what's hard is to
[21:06] live a life with no corrective love
[21:08] that's a hard life is anybody listening
[21:11] this morning
[21:12] what's hard is dealing with consequences
[21:13] of lustful sin and addiction and other
[21:16] addictions that's what's hard that's
[21:18] what's really hard but this is hard to
[21:20] get what I want because of the
[21:21] protections over this girl that's what
[21:23] amnon thought so I did a little research
[21:25] and I'm going to say it real quickly now
[21:27] because I only gave myself 20 minutes
[21:28] but I'm going to say it quickly I did a
[21:30] little research so just to break this
[21:32] down there was a word a law in from
[21:36] Moses law because here they're in time
[21:37] the Ammon and David or the time of Ammon
[21:39] and David there was a law in the law of
[21:41] Moses of course that was against
[21:44] fornication and adultery so of course
[21:46] he's he's overriding the laws right he
[21:48] said uh do not you know she you can't
[21:51] have her until you marry her so I'm in
[21:53] his mind even though he grew up hearing
[21:54] the Ten Commandments he's overriding all
[21:56] of it that law doesn't matter anymore
[21:58] Anna knew that word and there were
[22:00] several other places his mind come to a
[22:03] place that he's ready to ditch all of
[22:05] those quotes of the Prophet to get what
[22:07] he wants mom
[22:09] but the law of Moses
[22:13] that said no fornication before marriage
[22:15] but there really doesn't wasn't anything
[22:17] specific about being alone with a person
[22:21] in other words here's the point I want
[22:22] to make the law said don't commit
[22:24] foreign don't commit adultery but there
[22:27] really is wasn't too many specifics in
[22:29] the law of Moses
[22:31] to protect you
[22:34] from setting yourself up for a
[22:37] fornication
[22:39] there wasn't anything in there or
[22:41] setting yourself up for adultery
[22:44] so as time of it and I don't know when
[22:46] they did it but they say the high court
[22:47] of David As Time moved on on the same
[22:49] conditions happen they realized we got
[22:51] to have some more laws here we got to
[22:53] have something else it's not an adding
[22:55] to the Commandments but it's advancing
[22:57] and and
[22:59] amplifying what the Ten Commandments say
[23:03] because we have situations that could
[23:05] happen and the first one they dealt with
[23:06] is that they made a law uh the high
[23:09] quarter of David and all the maid of law
[23:11] that was an expansion or a a
[23:15] amplification they made a law
[23:18] that was called that addressed yakud in
[23:22] the Hebrews yakud and yakud means uh
[23:25] seclusion it's to be alone
[23:27] so this was a law against yakud for
[23:30] married women and for married men in
[23:32] other words they said we know we're not
[23:34] supposed to commit adultery but if a
[23:36] married man or married woman they're not
[23:37] married to one another if they're put in
[23:39] a room and they're locked in there you
[23:41] have the potential of something
[23:42] happening so we're going to make a law
[23:43] no married woman or no man should ever
[23:46] be alone in a room together with the
[23:49] door locked
[23:51] it was in the Hebrew law
[23:55] it's going to represent
[23:57] the boundaries that I've been talking
[23:59] about that have been sent by God
[24:01] the protections the
[24:04] the laws the principles in the Old
[24:08] Testament there's statues there's
[24:10] principles there's laws there are four
[24:12] or five things mentioned there so this
[24:14] represents this this morning and so if
[24:17] we look at this as God's principles it's
[24:20] got a pointy head on it and if you leave
[24:22] it in this condition you only see it
[24:24] this way and somebody's bringing this up
[24:26] to you
[24:27] okay this is the way you're going to
[24:29] look at it he keeps probing and pointing
[24:32] at me like by that thing God's brother
[24:34] keeps nabbing at me this is God's
[24:36] principles it's God's law
[24:38] so that's why a lot of people start to
[24:40] look at it you're just being poked all
[24:42] the time and he's always saying
[24:43] something about it and he's always his
[24:45] ministry has always been that way
[24:48] poked and then but if you if you just
[24:50] say Lord let me change my attitude
[24:53] towards these principles
[24:55] let me change my attitude
[24:57] I want you to read Psalms 119 besides
[25:00] listening to flashing red light it was
[25:02] coming I want you to read the whole
[25:03] chapter Psalms 119 I don't have time to
[25:05] read it it's so wonderful because it's a
[25:07] man it's not amnon it's a it's David
[25:09] who's allowed his mind to be so changed
[25:12] that his attitude towards the statues
[25:15] towards the laws is completely positive
[25:18] Lord how shall a young man cleanse his
[25:21] way by adhering to obeying your
[25:24] principles and your boundaries read the
[25:26] whole chapter he Embraces all of them
[25:28] say Lord I've made mistakes I've fallen
[25:30] but I'm back
[25:32] I'm paraphrasing and I am determined to
[25:36] obey and follow your principles
[25:39] why because
[25:40] he didn't send him to be mean to us or
[25:43] to poke us
[25:45] and if we change our attitude the same
[25:47] principles
[25:49] change
[25:51] the same principles that were poking us
[25:54] maybe all your years in the message as a
[25:56] young child
[25:57] as soon as you change your attitude
[25:59] about it you'll see them all together
[26:00] different
[26:04] [Applause]
[26:06] yep
[26:08] the same quotes
[26:10] the same quotes
[26:12] that you Buck up against be careful
[26:16] could it be God given an awesome
[26:19] protection from the rains from the winds
[26:22] supposed to rain today maybe that's why
[26:23] I got this listen you say I don't need
[26:26] that I'll run here I'll say well you
[26:28] know if you do go without it you're
[26:30] going to be in some storms
[26:31] you're going to get wet
[26:33] you might even get pneumonia
[26:36] because something has been given to you
[26:38] for the protection of God
[26:40] we're all trying to serve the Lord here
[26:43] and you're all at different stages
[26:46] okay the only thing I ask for is be
[26:48] careful what thoughts you put in your
[26:51] mind and where it comes from that's all
[26:53] I'm asking today
[26:54] if you're feeding too much of that
[26:56] you're going to change in your mind
[26:58] feed on the word of God and then you'll
[27:00] know for yourself
[27:02] where this comes from
[27:08] Josh McDowell is the one that referred
[27:10] to this umbrella and he said it's always
[27:12] an act of Love on God's part
[27:15] it's always an act of Love on God's part
[27:18] to protect us and provide for us
[27:21] but when through an act of Disobedience
[27:23] by a decision of Our Own
[27:25] we ignore God's precepts we remove
[27:28] ourselves from the very protection and
[27:30] provision of those precepts there's
[27:34] power that comes from God's word there's
[27:36] power of protection that comes from his
[27:38] precepts it's not just laws but when we
[27:41] obey him power comes with it to watch
[27:44] over our lives let me just say this
[27:46] let's quit messing with the boundaries
[27:49] quit messing with the Bible let's quit
[27:51] questioning them you want to spend your
[27:52] whole life just questioning them you
[27:54] want to know more why where they come
[27:55] from praise the Lord research it but
[27:57] let's stop messing with them and letting
[28:00] Satan mess with our minds
[28:02] God give us a sound mind a clear mind
[28:04] God give us more of a love for his
[28:07] precepts thank you for watching our
