TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today there's not a mountain to talk so small that Jesus can resolve is [Music] to wait on the Lord away at all the way [Music] and you may know yourself [Music] somehow pass away [Music] just wait on the Lord [Music] I need two or three people to stick it out [Music] oh said [Applause] and he'll read you Lord [Music] please [Music] oh is I believe that the righteous will never be safe no matter how long it takes you've gone away myself [Music] away [Music] for my love what's wrong [Music] with you Jesus I'm gonna wait on you Jesus I'm good away [Music] Jesus [Music] I'm gonna follow you [Music] thank you another way to do Lord Time After Time [Music] says [Music] and you may know your strengths [Music] [Music] Nathan said to David Thou Art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel I anointed thee King over Israel I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul and I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Master's wives into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would moreover have given unto these such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon and um we realized then that the Uriah was killed because you know he took his wife and then he had Uriah killed on the out in the war so you know that story you're familiar with that there's a God speaking back to him so now watch now the judgments come from God verse 10. now therefore the sword shall never depart from mine house David the sword will never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil again so now the judgments continue I will raise up evil against the out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou did it secretly so part of the pronouncement here is that God was not pleased that something was done secretly you never do anything secretly God knows all things but as a king now he did something secret he didn't do it openly but whatever is done secretly if you're a son and daughter of God it will be revealed openly someday for thou this secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun and David sent unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die now here's where Grace comes in aren't you glad when Grace comes in because David repenteth he says I the Lord hath put away thy sin David and thou shalt not die he should have died he deserved to die but Thou shalt not die how be it because by thy deed thou Hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die so Bathsheba Was Pregnant and So then then the next few verses then David starts to appeal to God even though he's been forgiven he starts to appeal to God in fasting and prayer that the child should live that child should live and then you know the story that God says no it would die he pronounced it so we want to get into this this morning and I pray that the Lord will give us an anointing and a spirit there's so many blessings and instruction from this the story a few chapters later I had been referring to the story of amnon a little bit in second Samuel chapter 13 and we know that the story of amnon is a very tragic a very terrible story of rape in the Bible and um I would say that it's even more terrible that story is even more terrible to see something like this happen in the royal family of Israel it it wouldn't be expected that we would see a story like this in the Bible but we we know we would see it maybe in the Heathen and in the unbelieving Nations but when we have a story like amnon come up amongst the royal family of Israel the king of Israel that God elected that's kind of unexpected um that this would come out of the very people that are to be upholding the moral laws of God and the Commandments of God and the law of Moses it's just unexpected and yet yet it happened just the same the Bible didn't hide it and thus God did not hide the story God didn't hide the story God left it in his word they recorded it and yet it's here and so if God didn't hide it we don't hide it if God doesn't hide it we don't ignore it and everything God places in this Bible is for our instruction for our Revelation and for our good David in the Bible coming to his throne finally after so many years under Saul and all the transition happening within the message finally David who was the one that was supposed to be God's choice for a king finally David comes to his throne through the help of Gentile Warriors and that's all a mystery for our day David was placed on the throne through the help of Gentile Warriors which is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ Gentile Warriors that said we believe in you David you're going to be on the throne someday and we're going to fight until we put you on the throne glory be to God but look at the story now look at this in this it had a change of events that we didn't expect David came to his throne through the help of Gentile Warriors everybody's happy he's on the throne and then uh all of his enemies were subdued around him he had victory over all of his enemies they were subdued and so you would think that was it it's done it's come to its Glory the message has come to its Glory but then something started in second Samuel chapter 11 and the story takes another turn for the next several chapters the story The Glory of him being on the throne the glory of all this coming into the place and God's sending a prophet and then put a king on the throne and all this seems like it's all ready to go and then the whole story takes a turn when David sins and it's just it's a it's a it's a turn of events that was not expected can you say Amen he's got victory in mind all the time for your life for the bride he's got the victory in mind at the end can I get an amen this morning so brother Gideon preached on removing the hindrances and so when in a hindrance comes like Aiken Aiken taking uh two things Aiken messed up the Aiken stopped the Battle of AI he ruined a battle that they should have won because you know what he did he stole he it was about money and it was about clothes Babylonian clothing come on people say amen well how did all of Israel start to lose their Victory money and clothes from Babylon is the thing that brought them down and they couldn't have full Victory which is what our brother Gideon preached to us God has to remove the hindrances you have to remove the hindrances you got to search it out and find that gold and find those things in your tent and bring them out and they stoned all of Aiken and his family because why Victory is important to God and you can't have full Victory when you keep the hindrances in your life I'm not repreaching Gideon's message he preached it good enough but I was so excited to know that God's standing there saying I know Israel did this and he didn't say Aiken sin he said all of Israel has sinned and he says I know this has happened this is little this is a glitch this is it I don't like it I'm angry about this and they can't Victory but listen God's saying how can I get this dealt with so I can get the people back to ahai in other words he says oh you blew it so now just try some other cities you won't get a no he took them right back to AI again when God dealt with the hindrance and the hindrance was gone and the sin was out of the camp he directed them right back you're gonna get the victory over AI that's the same God that I served this morning I don't care what happens in our life I don't care what hindrance is I don't care what pain sorrow mistakes sin can you say man if you're a son and daughter of God God has your victory in mind even when you don't have your victory in mind God's got your victory in mind and they were going to go back to ai ai artificial intelligence because why that one has got to be conquered anybody waking up this morning this world is full of artificial intelligence we're affected by it but no devil is going to take the social media and artificial intelligence and we're not going to back down that's something that's got to be conquered in a believer's life oh I can't get enough amens this morning you know it's the truth those cities speak of our victories today sometimes when we make a mistake and God comes in our life and begins to bring because we reap what we saw and he brings the judgments sometimes the judgments we want we want God to affect all of the situation by grace and I can tell you in David's situation he didn't he didn't I should say this in his eyes he didn't give every situation Grace but he gave David Grace he spared David's life but there were other things that he dealt with the rest of his life and we would say selfishly well that's not my God and I he should be able to get rid of all of this that's our perfect world that we want in a perfect world God should have done this and God should have done that and God and so we bring our own judgments to how God should a judge how much grace he should have gave me let me tell you something I'm preaching my final conclusion here is that we we don't deserve anything from God and any Grace that he gives us we don't Embrace and say thank God for your grace thank God that I'm still living this morning thank God that I'm still breathing this morning thank God that my family is healthy this morning thank God that I have a desire to serve God thank God that I love this message you think you gave yourself the love for this message in this word you didn't even give that to yourself God created that love within you people say well he didn't give Grace in this area he didn't give me this and he didn't give me that and he didn't spare my child when do we start navigating navigating God's grace we should be grateful for the grace he gives us and when he offers judgment in the rest of the situation we should be thankful for that too internal trouble in the House of David now because of his sin family trouble sexual sins and many other troubles came to the house of David not just with David's sexual sin but sexual sin became a part of the House of David and I'm not blaming David for that but it has to the commentators and the different ones who write about it they're careful sometimes to attach amnon's sin to David but and you can't do that but there's something to be learned about sexual sin that sexual sin no matter how private and undisclosed or it doesn't get out sexual sin has a way of affecting the household down the road and this scripture proves that so now years now years of trouble is going to come sexual sins in David's house and he started it now all these things you heard of the Heathen Nations some of the same incidences happened in their own camp in our own camp for years we heard it in the heathens but now we hear it in our own camp we hear David it's in it's in the Royal Family many years of trouble and David's house came from it so I don't want the story to end there I'm just going to quickly say and go back to David here but I'm going to quickly say to you in the story it ends in a victory because many years after a lot of trouble in David's house if it's a type of the Bride today and I believe it is then praise the Lord Jesus that wasn't the end because the next Generation raised up under Solomon restoration came a temple was built and guess what God came down and responded back and filled the temple so much with his glory that the minister couldn't even speak I'm telling you people being defeated people under a cloud people underneath uh uh habits and things God is going to deliver this bride from every one of them and God's got your victory in mind can you say amen and this bride God's Gonna Fill his temples with his glory at the end of this thing and take him in a Rapture amen after all that happened and they didn't deserve the glory of God come to they didn't deserve all after all the sexual sin they didn't deserve the glory of God coming down in Solomon's day they didn't deserve it none of us deserve any of it but God has victory in mind for his people and he will come and we know that the people will reap some bad Harvest because of decisions they make but how God says they're reaping because I have a law of sowing and reaping God says in my people today they're reaping there's a law of harvest they're reaping a harvest from bad decisions that they made but God doesn't stay there he says I know they're reaping a harvest but how can I get them to a final Victory so you can be in denial and you can cover up but we learn all this from the Bible we learn from all the Bible we learn from the whole story of David's trouble and I will call this David's sin the kind of the back story of amnon and the back story is events that led up to amnam events that let up and so we know as I've been speaking about amnon there are several reasons that he got where he was at that he can become so possessed of the enemy so possessed of devils and lustful demons that he actually uh raped a girl I'm talking in the Bible now it's amazing and so there's several reasons he got there I spoke about the mind a mind his mind must have been turned over to other thoughts so much he couldn't have got there Eminem couldn't have got there with his mind being completely uh controlled by another spirit and then there's another message I want to get into Lord willing he the next scripture in Ammon says he had a friend amnon had a friend it was a bad friend it was a bad friend so he had the wrong friend if you have the wrong friend it's going to influence your life I don't know why we even call some people friends when they keep weakening us spiritually that's not your friends your friends are the ones that draw you closer to God so he had the wrong friend if you have the wrong friend it's going to influence your life I don't know why we even call some people friends when they keep weakening us spiritually that's not your friends your friends are the ones that draw you closer to God I got this online friend and oh we have a nice relationship and they're a complete unbeliever that's really not your friend it might be your enemy but admin had a friend and that's how he got there too so all the events leading up to it but there's several reasons that amnon got there but you see now but the one I want to talk about today is the King's sin because we might not say it's it's not say it's not related but the dad the king what David did what David did and you can disagree with him that's fine but I believe what David did set a tone in the family and in the Kingdom because nobody knew about this before and now God says I'm going to blast it all away with that our King that our King took a woman that wasn't his and had sexual relations with her and then killed the husband all of this word got out and so if you don't think that has an effect on people's minds our King Our God called King our man that's in leadership our leader you see we think it's the sin is bad and the sin is terrible it was terrible but what Satan does with the sin is sometimes worth because it's a lack of trust in the people again and not only that if it's not dealt with then we realize it sets a precedence kind of like with Esther and the king and the the king said go tell vashti to I want her to come and do something in the banquet invest I said no I refuse to come and so now the king says if we let that go and all the rulers said if we let that go then all the women of the land are going to say say no to their husbands when they ask them to do something it it has a trickle-down effect fathers husbands young men listen to me today sometimes your little decisions can have a trickle-down effect to children for many generations now listen I believe God has the power to break curses in families and I can preach another sermon on that and you'd probably be more excited about it than what I'm preaching today but God can break curses in families but I can still preach if that curse isn't broke then little decisions that David made and different ones make you think you can do it privately but it's going to have an effect it's gonna trickle down it will spill over and then you look at your sons and daughters sometimes say why are they that way well you don't just say well it's because they don't have the Holy Ghost it's all on them it's not always on all of them it's poor decisions that we make but trust me friends you don't have to say Amen with all this as long as you chew on it that's fine it's nice to get amens but I know these subjects are tedious to talk about I'm not wanting to bring you Brothers down or your sisters down but I want to speak openly and honestly that we Life Is Life and when you make decisions privately sometimes sexual Temptation decisions and you fall and you do things like that you think you're hiding it but it has a trickle-down effect in sexual things in the family to see it's no service if there's no repentance I'd like to see young people go home and take the trash off their phones I'd like to see fathers that are privately sinning repent to their wives and say hon I've got to confess something to you I'd like to see more confession I'll tell you if we have confession in bringing it on the table no matter what the outcome bring it on the table I'd love to see that it doesn't have to be in this service but I pray it would be because if we have that kind of confession we've got the devil on the run and victory is on the way but there's certain things I learned from the scripture is that there's trouble sometimes and you reap what you sow but that doesn't mean God didn't give me his grace and so we shouldn't say but I thought his grace would just fix all of these things and sometimes he does but sometimes he doesn't but it's not our interpretation of God's grace give me this Lord and give me that and seal it up over here and give me that give me correct this and it's all your problems you're wanting him to correct do this do this and sometimes God says here's here's my judgment I'm giving you Grace and I'm leaving things in your life that should have been taken from you but I'm giving you those things by my grace but there's some other things that are going to always be with you how many knows when you get a wound you get a scar and the scar is there for life if that works physically it works emotionally too but God gives us Grace to heal our wounds even though the scars are always there but I want to close this by saying that we shouldn't interpret to God what his grace should be we should be satisfied with the what Grace he gives us
