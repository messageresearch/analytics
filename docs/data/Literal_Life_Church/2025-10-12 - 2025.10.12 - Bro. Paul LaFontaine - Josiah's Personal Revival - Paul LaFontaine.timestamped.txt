[33:45] But in the 18th year of King Josiah,
[33:47] wherein this Passover was holden to the
[33:49] Lord in Jerusalem. Moreover, the workers
[33:53] with familiar spirits and the wizards
[33:56] and the images and the idols and all the
[34:00] abominations that were spied in the land
[34:02] of Judah and in Jerusalem did Josiah put
[34:05] away that he might perform the words of
[34:09] the law which were written in the book
[34:11] that Heekiah the priest found in the
[34:14] house of the Lord. There's a just a
[34:17] simple mystery behind the one scripture
[34:19] here and that is Josiah acted upon
[34:22] getting rid of all of the idols and
[34:24] spirits and everything within the temple
[34:27] of God. He he stood as a young man to
[34:30] get rid of all the things out of the
[34:32] temple. But he did it as a result of
[34:34] what he read in the word. So when you
[34:37] bring the word into your life and the
[34:39] book of God and it gets open to you, the
[34:42] open book should influence you to clean
[34:45] the house of the Lord.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; And like unto him was there no king
[34:50] before him that turned to the Lord with
[34:53] all his heart and with all his soul and
[34:57] with all his might. That sounds familiar
[34:59] to what Jesus said. That's the only way
[35:01] to love him. With all your heart, soul,
[35:03] mind, and strength. And Josiah did that
[35:06] with all of his might. According to all
[35:08] the law of Moses, neither after him
[35:10] arose there any like him. Of all the
[35:13] kings in the Bible, he's praised here.
[35:15] There was nothing like this king next to
[35:17] David. He says a similar place as with
[35:20] David the king. If you don't mind adding
[35:22] one more scripture in Psalm 69. If you
[35:24] just keep your finger in 2 Kings, we
[35:27] might refer back to it. Psalm 69. I
[35:30] would like to add this in concerning the
[35:33] zeal of the house of the Lord. Psalms 69
[35:40] and uh verse 7 if you would. Psalm 69
[35:44] and verse 7. Because for thy sake I have
[35:47] borne reproach. Shame hath covered my
[35:50] face. I am become a stranger unto my
[35:53] brethren and an alien unto my mother's
[35:56] children. When we stand for the Lord, we
[35:59] becomes a stranger. We become an
[36:00] oddball. Brother Brandon preached the
[36:02] oddball. We become an oddball to many
[36:04] others, and we bear reproach.
[36:08] When I wept, excuse me, for verse 9, for
[36:10] the zeal of thine house hath eaten me
[36:13] up, and the reproaches of them that
[36:16] reproach thee are fallen upon me. The
[36:18] reason for some of the reproach and some
[36:20] of the criticism and some of the
[36:23] strangers
[36:25] uh that's turning against him, it's
[36:26] because his passion and his zeal
[36:31] for the house of the Lord. His passion
[36:34] and his zeal for the house of the Lord.
[36:36] Father, bless your word. Sanctify us now
[36:38] by your word. And may you minister and
[36:41] give us strength to minister this
[36:42] morning. We place it in your hands, my
[36:44] father, in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[36:47] you. You may be seated. I was greatly
[36:49] blessed on Wednesday night to hear some
[36:52] of the things Brother Brandon was
[36:53] bringing out and uh uh uh I I actually
[36:58] would piggyback a little bit off of that
[36:59] this morning and take it maybe a little
[37:02] further, but it was great to hear some
[37:05] of the his research on the what the
[37:07] historians and the sociologists
[37:10] uh call the phenomena of the third
[37:13] generation. And if you haven't heard
[37:14] that service Wednesday night, you should
[37:16] hear it because he goes into detail
[37:18] reading some of these things and it's
[37:19] called the phenomena of the third
[37:21] generation and actually talks a little
[37:23] bit. Brother Brandon talked about the
[37:24] fourth generation and the third
[37:27] generation as they call it the phenomena
[37:29] of the third generation. It's marked by
[37:31] decline and I'll read that part to you
[37:33] again because it has the mark of decline
[37:36] and it's a process. What's interesting
[37:38] about what he read is that this decline
[37:40] from the first generation to the third
[37:42] is actually a process of declining and
[37:45] what was originally the passion and the
[37:48] the love and the vision and everything
[37:50] that went with the first generation when
[37:52] God uh I shouldn't say when God when
[37:54] even in any generation cuz brother
[37:56] Brandon read something here that was of
[37:58] a secular nature it it didn't uh it
[38:01] wasn't related to God and yet when he
[38:03] read the quotes later this is exactly
[38:06] what brother Brandon was saying about
[38:07] the cycle of revival and death that
[38:10] happened through the church ages and
[38:11] even back in Israel a revival then death
[38:14] a revival then death and that's that
[38:16] what happens is they have a revival and
[38:19] the revival begins to decline with the
[38:21] second generation the third generation
[38:23] and it's actually atrocious what's h
[38:25] what happens in the fourth generation
[38:27] they get so far away from the original
[38:30] revival they don't even know who they
[38:32] are anymore they lose their identity and
[38:35] so that was a secular ular thing that he
[38:37] was reading from historians and
[38:39] sociologists, but it was so perfect with
[38:43] the way the prophet read about the
[38:45] Christian church and how that decline
[38:48] happened from generation to generation.
[38:50] I won't read you all of it, but I'll
[38:52] read just the end that he was reading
[38:53] because it bears repeating when he talks
[38:56] about the second and then he gets to the
[38:57] third. Uh um this there's a little bit
[39:00] about the second generation. He said the
[39:03] the second generation time passes. Uh
[39:06] well, let me just read the second one.
[39:08] The second generation is content with
[39:09] listening to the stories of the old
[39:12] days, wishing for them, but is too
[39:14] involved with the preservation of the
[39:17] success of the present to continue the
[39:19] growth of the first generation. They
[39:21] work hard to preserve the status quo,
[39:24] fearing that any movement will risk
[39:26] losing what they have received. The
[39:28] second gen generation is marked by
[39:29] entrenchment. Time passes and the mantle
[39:32] falls on the third generation. They have
[39:34] only heard about the dynamics and
[39:37] vitality of the first generation
[39:39] secondhand. They have not seen that kind
[39:41] of vitality. They have only seen the
[39:43] process of preservation and
[39:45] entrenchment. They have heard the
[39:47] stories of the past, but they are far
[39:49] away and unreal. They find no compelling
[39:51] reason to be driven by the vision that
[39:54] drove the grandparents. They are freed
[39:56] from the need to fight for recognition
[39:58] and security and are even freed from the
[40:00] worries of preserving what was
[40:02] originally hard one. They are idle with
[40:04] no vision that drives them, no passion
[40:07] that inflames them and no purpose that
[40:09] gives them meaning. As a result, the
[40:11] members of the third generation usually
[40:13] begin to question their identity, their
[40:15] belonging. Why even do I why even be
[40:18] part of a group of this community or
[40:20] this family? If if I if I serve no
[40:22] purpose and see no future. You see that
[40:24] generation? There's no vision. And
[40:27] because there's no vision, the Bible
[40:28] says the people perish.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; There's no original vision. So if I have
[40:32] no purpose and see no future. Here's the
[40:34] tragedy of the third generation. The
[40:36] third generation is often a people
[40:39] lacking a strong sense of identity and
[40:42] belonging and so are uncommitted to the
[40:44] group. A people without a a driving
[40:48] passion because they are fired by no
[40:51] vision. A people not sure of who they
[40:54] are, what they believe or what they
[40:56] should do. The third generation is
[40:58] marked by decline. Now this is a secular
[41:01] thing saying this is what happens in the
[41:03] third and fourth generation is that
[41:05] there is no vision. There is a and
[41:07] because of that they lose their lose
[41:09] their identity. They lose their
[41:11] commitment. I could spend another hour
[41:12] talking about this generation and how it
[41:15] loses its commitment to anything. People
[41:18] can barely attend church because they
[41:20] they lose what it means to be an onfire
[41:23] Christian. They lose the meaning of
[41:26] connecting with God. When you're
[41:27] connected with God, you want to be in
[41:29] church. When you're connected with him,
[41:31] you want to be in fellowship with him
[41:33] every day, not just in church.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; And so, this is what happens in the
[41:38] natural. And it was amazing to see this
[41:40] line up exactly with the decline in the
[41:43] church age book that brother Brandon the
[41:45] decline spiritual that happened right
[41:47] after the first cha church age. And you
[41:50] heard the quote Wednesday night. I'm
[41:52] going to read a little bit of it again
[41:53] because I my purpose in reading this is
[41:56] here's my purpose in reading it is what
[41:58] they declined from so that we know what
[42:02] we're seeking to get back to.
[42:07] Because if you go third and fourth
[42:09] generation, you start to lose what even
[42:11] you fell from.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; What a revival is.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; That's bad. Can you say amen? So my
[42:18] purpose is to read kind of what we fell
[42:20] from, what we come from, and that way we
[42:22] know uh how what we're to be seeking.
[42:25] Lord, we need to know what we're
[42:26] seeking. God honors people who are
[42:28] seeking him, but we got to know what
[42:30] we're seeking. Amen.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; So because you know and and there are so
[42:34] many promises as last Sunday we read
[42:36] those that were in captivity and they
[42:38] were in Babylon and now they hear the
[42:40] promise that they're going back after 70
[42:43] years and uh you know there was
[42:45] redemption. They thought there was no
[42:47] hope. But even with the judgments of God
[42:49] and allowing them to go to Babylon,
[42:52] there's always a thread of redemption to
[42:54] the people who begin to seek him to be
[42:58] revived. People have to seek God to be
[43:01] revived.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; God doesn't just come and revive them.
[43:05] God has God has the redemptive power to
[43:10] bring you back to where you need to be.
[43:12] But God needs a person seeking to be
[43:15] revived.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; You have to seek it. You have to want
[43:19] it. It has to be a passion. Can you say
[43:22] amen? And the promises are so great
[43:24] throughout the Bible, Old Testament and
[43:26] New, that when they begin to seek me, I
[43:29] will find them. When they begin to turn
[43:31] towards me, wherever they are, you
[43:33] remember even Jonah held on to the
[43:36] promise of Solomon. Solomon said, "God,
[43:38] I'm going to ask for wisdom for your
[43:40] kingdom. And I'm going to ask that
[43:42] wherever your people are, no matter
[43:44] where they're at, no matter how low they
[43:46] are, I'm going to ask if they turn
[43:48] towards Jerusalem and pray and seek you,
[43:51] will you answer them? And God said,
[43:53] "Wherever they're at, no matter how low
[43:55] they are, where if they'll turn towards
[43:58] me, they will be found of me."
[44:01] &gt;&gt; What a promise. What a what a redemptive
[44:04] blessing. Can you say amen?
[44:07] And so wherever they were, and I like to
[44:09] use Jonah because he's in the belly of a
[44:12] whale
[44:13] at the bottom of the ocean. You can't
[44:15] get much lower than that. Maybe you
[44:17] thought, "Well, I was pretty low." But
[44:19] you look at your life, you say, "I'm not
[44:21] so sure if I I think I'll take my story
[44:25] rather than being in the bottom of the
[44:26] ocean, pretty hopeless in the belly of a
[44:29] whale or a big fish, it's called, but
[44:31] you know, I I'll take my story. As bad
[44:33] as it is, that's pretty low." And yet
[44:35] somehow Jonah was able to turn himself
[44:37] towards Jerusalem, which I don't know if
[44:40] he had a a supernatural GPS. It must
[44:43] have been. He was able to turn the right
[44:45] direction in the bottom of the ocean.
[44:47] And when he did, God brought him out of
[44:49] the fishmen.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Don't ever underestimate
[44:55] &gt;&gt; the power of redemption
[44:57] &gt;&gt; because God in his judgments
[45:00] always puts that thread and that promise
[45:02] of redemption there.
[45:05] to where the people begin to believe
[45:07] that if they begin to believe they're
[45:08] pastored him. So, let me just read this
[45:10] when they get so far away from the
[45:12] original. And so, let me remind you of
[45:13] what he read Wednesday night and this is
[45:15] a a thing, but I read it so that you can
[45:17] go back to what we they fell from in the
[45:20] early church when he said, "You've left
[45:21] your first love." And brother Bradley
[45:23] explains, he said, "The fervent desire
[45:25] to please God, the passion to know his
[45:28] word, the cry for reaching out in the
[45:30] spirit, all begins to fade. And instead
[45:32] of that church being on fire with the
[45:34] fire of God, it has cooled off and
[45:36] become a bit formal. That is what's
[45:38] happening back there in Ephesians. They
[45:40] were getting a bit formal.
[45:44] The abandonment to God was dying out and
[45:46] the people weren't too careful about
[45:49] what God thought of them as they began
[45:52] to be careful about what the world
[45:54] thought of them.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Now, that needs to be said today. that
[45:59] is relevant today because we are in a
[46:02] time of great comparisons.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm going to say it. Social
[46:10] media,
[46:12] &gt;&gt; the secular people that study this
[46:14] stuff, it's a whole world of comparing
[46:17] yourself with the other person.
[46:20] And when you come to the kingdom of God,
[46:22] that's the worst thing you can do is
[46:24] look over your shoulder to somebody
[46:26] sitting in the back of you this morning
[46:27] in church and take your story and take
[46:29] your life and start comparing even
[46:31] spiritually and to compare your life
[46:33] with someone else. God does not want you
[46:36] to do that. God wants you to have a
[46:38] personal revival yourself.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And if nobody else wants that revival,
[46:44] God needs you to say, "God, I want that
[46:47] revival. I want it for myself. But the
[46:50] way that we get away is that we become
[46:53] less careful about what God thinks of us
[46:57] and start to be too careful about what
[46:59] the rest of the world thinks of us. That
[47:01] goes right down to dress and everything
[47:02] else. How weird am I going to look to
[47:04] the world? How am I going to look to
[47:06] everybody else? How am I going to look
[47:07] if I do this? What what you see, when
[47:09] you start thinking that way, then you
[47:11] start comparing yourself. Brother
[47:13] Brandham says people will get a pool and
[47:16] you'll see people get pools all down the
[47:18] neighborhood. He said, "We're in a day
[47:19] of comparison. We're in a day of lining
[47:22] up with somebody else and copying
[47:23] somebody else and being somebody else."
[47:26] That's a trap because God does not want
[47:29] you to be that young girl that's on your
[47:31] social media. You say, "Well, she's in
[47:33] the message." It doesn't matter. Don't
[47:35] compare yourself with somebody else.
[47:37] Look to God to have your own personal
[47:40] revival.
[47:42] [Applause]
[47:43] &gt;&gt; So now the second, he said, "Now the
[47:46] abandonment." So we we covered that the
[47:48] second generation coming on. He said the
[47:50] second gen generation. So he's into this
[47:52] the same as Brandon talked about brother
[47:54] Brandham that now the second generation
[47:56] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[47:58] world world instead of conforming to
[47:59] God. It isn't long until you see them
[48:02] stop doing things they used to do and
[48:04] start doing things they wouldn't do
[48:05] initially. They change their manner of
[48:07] dress, their attitudes and their
[48:09] behavior. They get lax. That's what
[48:12] Ephesians Ephesus means. Relax.
[48:14] Drifting. One little deviation from the
[48:18] word was a step away from Christ.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; What did they leave? The word.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; The word. One little deviation from that
[48:28] word was a step. Let me just say this.
[48:31] If the word is what they fell from and
[48:34] lost a revival, then you will not have a
[48:37] revival without getting back to the
[48:39] word.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; The revival is not an emotion. The
[48:43] revival is you yourself personal getting
[48:46] back to the word
[48:48] &gt;&gt; because every bit of revival fire comes
[48:51] out of people being back in the word
[48:55] which is Christ. Can you say amen? It's
[48:57] not just in your Bible. It's in the
[48:59] person of Christ. But what it would help
[49:01] to get back into the Bible to get back
[49:03] into the message because what happens is
[49:05] what comes out of that is Holy Ghost
[49:07] fires. What comes out of that is the
[49:09] emotion. But we don't attach oursel to
[49:11] an emotion and say we're having a
[49:13] revival. It comes from the word.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Always when we get back to the word and
[49:20] the word I want to be specific now. You
[49:22] say, "Well, I met I go to a message
[49:23] church. I come here and hear brother
[49:25] Paul preach." That's not what I'm
[49:26] talking about. I'm talking about when
[49:28] you are becoming one with the word
[49:29] yourself.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One little deviation
[49:34] from that word was a step away from
[49:36] Christ. People say they love God. They
[49:38] go to church. They even shout and
[49:40] rejoice and sing and have a great
[49:42] emotional time. Now, he had just used
[49:44] the word before this. He'd used u um let
[49:48] me just go back and read it the way he
[49:50] said it. They get a bit formal.
[49:53] And one minister told me he said, "We
[49:55] think of formal is this Orthodox.
[49:58] Nobody's raising their hands, nobody's
[50:00] shouting, and you sing the songs, barely
[50:03] sing the songs, and it's like a a a
[50:06] Catholic mass." And that's how churches
[50:08] become there's no there's no life to it.
[50:12] We think of formal as that way. But
[50:15] formal can be a form of emotion.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; It's not just that somebody would be
[50:23] starchy. It's somebody would be overly
[50:25] emotional putting it on. And that's
[50:28] being formal, too.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Because why? It's a form of doing
[50:32] something. You can shout all you want
[50:34] to. In fact, I wouldn't mind if some of
[50:36] you shouted more here when I preached.
[50:38] But listen to me. It better be because
[50:40] of the word changing your life. Shout,
[50:43] dance, scream, "Amen." Can you say amen?
[50:45] But it cannot be legislated. It cannot
[50:48] be forced. It can't be worked up. It
[50:51] comes out of the fires of God's word.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; That's when a revival is still
[50:58] happening. Amen. So he says here as he
[51:02] goes and says now he said people that
[51:04] say they love God to church even shout
[51:06] and rejoice and sing have a great
[51:08] emotional time but when it's all over
[51:10] listen when it's all over watch and see
[51:13] if they are in that word walking in it
[51:17] living in it if they go through all the
[51:20] other and then don't walk in that word
[51:22] they can say they love God but their
[51:23] lives tell another story later on in the
[51:25] quote he says that revival fire built
[51:28] upon the sacred word is so Wonderful.
[51:30] And the manifestation of the spirit is
[51:32] so blessed that a little fear creeps in
[51:34] and a whisper in the heart says, "How
[51:36] can we protect this truth we have? What
[51:38] can we do to see this revival goes on?"
[51:40] You see, you see that's that's where we
[51:43] get in trouble is when we're trying to
[51:45] preserve. He said that second generation
[51:47] is not in the mode of trying to get the
[51:50] original fire, but it's trying to
[51:53] preserve what we had.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Terrible trap. Let's keep this going.
[51:59] Let's keep this and being willing to
[52:01] being willing to work it up just to just
[52:04] to keep it going so it looks like a
[52:07] revival.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; We don't want that.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; That revival fire built upon the sacred
[52:16] word so wonderful and manifestation of
[52:17] the spirit so blessed that a little fear
[52:20] creeps in. How many how many loves the
[52:21] manifestation of the spirit of God?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I love it. I crave for it.
[52:26] and being built that revive revival fire
[52:29] is built upon the sacred word and the
[52:33] manifestation of the spirit so blessed
[52:34] that a little fear creeps in the whisper
[52:36] how can we protect this truth we have
[52:38] what can we do to see this revival goes
[52:40] on that is when the antichrist comes in
[52:42] and whispers look you have a truth now
[52:44] see that it doesn't get lost organize
[52:46] set up your creed of what you believe
[52:48] put it all in a church manual and they
[52:50] do it they organize they add to the word
[52:52] and they die just like Eve did or taking
[52:55] one word from It's God's word that
[52:57] brings life. And it's not what we say
[53:00] about the word that counts, but it's
[53:02] what God says.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Pretty powerful things.
[53:08] Keeping us in line and looking back to
[53:10] what that original was so we can see
[53:12] what it looks like. Now, you remember
[53:14] last year or sometime, I don't know when
[53:16] I talked about it, but I want to remind
[53:18] you of something I talked about of all
[53:20] the kings of Israel. And I had a slide.
[53:24] They're going to bring it up in a
[53:25] minute. And I listed all the kings of
[53:27] Israel. Now, I want to say this. We
[53:30] should pay attention to the kings and
[53:32] priests that's in the Bible. Why should
[53:35] we pay attention to that? You read
[53:36] through your Bibles. So, you think, "Oh
[53:37] my goodness, this is a lot of reading, a
[53:38] lot of details about all the priests of
[53:41] the B." But there's a reason why there's
[53:43] a a shadow or a type of so many kings
[53:46] and so many priests in the Bible. It
[53:49] should it should be given our attention
[53:52] to look at these kings and priests more
[53:54] than anybody else because the kings and
[53:57] priests speaks of the spiritual position
[54:02] the Lord is taking you to.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; So now I hope you don't look at the Old
[54:08] Testament. I hope you look at it
[54:09] different now because you see this is
[54:11] speaking of something for our lives. And
[54:14] it's it's not speaking of when we're
[54:16] birthed into the kingdom. It's speaking
[54:18] about where the word is taking us
[54:21] to be kings and priests. Couple weeks
[54:24] ago, I talked about David, not just be
[54:26] another king like Saul. No, but this now
[54:28] I'll give you a king after my own heart.
[54:30] God says, I'll give you a king after my
[54:31] own heart. So, when he began this
[54:33] process of kings, what God was, what was
[54:35] in his mind is that when I get to the
[54:37] end time and bring my word to the
[54:39] people, I this word is going to mold
[54:41] them into true kings and priests.
[54:45] And it came in Revelations 5. It's not
[54:49] the day we're born, but it's what our
[54:51] destiny is through the word bringing
[54:54] unto kings and priests. You can mark
[54:56] down in your minds Revelations 5. When
[54:58] he came down the lamb with the open
[55:00] book, he they said, "Thou hast made us,
[55:04] say it with me, kings and priests." The
[55:06] result of the open book makes the people
[55:10] into kings and priests.
[55:13] It's not what it's it's not your birth.
[55:16] It's what the word is molding you into.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; You're already a Christian, but you're
[55:24] being molded into a spiritual king and a
[55:28] spiritual priest.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, brother Paul, I don't know
[55:32] what that means." That's why I'm telling
[55:33] you, go read what it means because this
[55:36] is what this word is forming into your
[55:40] life. Now, I'm only 14 years old. and
[55:41] I'm only 12. This word is forming you
[55:44] into a spiritual king and a spiritual
[55:47] priest.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; There's no other goal in life should
[55:51] ever be more important than what the
[55:53] word is trying to form us into.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; So when we look at these kings, if they
[55:59] I don't know if they still have that
[56:00] chart, but in this chart, we had 42
[56:04] kings in the Old Testament. One queen,
[56:06] but all of them men besides the one
[56:08] queen. And there's 42 of them. So, I'm
[56:10] just reminding of this and as you read
[56:13] your Bible, and you know, we got
[56:14] different ones here. I'm going to come
[56:16] into this uh of King of Judah because
[56:20] remember, they had a church split. You
[56:22] know, they were the king of it was just
[56:23] Israel. Then they had a church split and
[56:25] they were the kings of Judah, kings of
[56:27] Israel. And then I'm going to pick it up
[56:29] here in Hezekiah, which is a tremendous
[56:32] revival. And I'll show you why in just a
[56:34] minute. And then we have Manasseh and
[56:36] Ammon. And then who I'm talking about
[56:38] today, Josiah, who had a personal
[56:39] revival. But all of these they had
[56:41] different years that they served. Josiah
[56:44] was eight years old when he began to
[56:45] serve. And uh that was a wonderful
[56:48] thing. Uh you know, and this is how many
[56:50] years they serve. You know, you got some
[56:52] there 29 years. I think it was 34 41.
[56:54] Asa was 41. So he served quite a few
[56:57] years. Uh Hesiah over here was only two
[57:01] years. Uh he served one was just a few
[57:04] months. And I think uh yeah, shalom, he
[57:07] didn't have a very successful time. He
[57:09] served for one month. So the job was
[57:12] that was it. He was done after a month.
[57:15] But but what I was bringing back in I
[57:18] can't remember the message I was
[57:19] preaching about it. But what I was
[57:20] bringing is that is that as you read
[57:22] through these in the Old Testament,
[57:24] you'll see different reactions. And this
[57:27] is how it's worded. And King so and so
[57:30] begin to reign. And he did that which
[57:33] was evil in the sight of the Lord.
[57:37] It goes on. And so how many you can
[57:38] raise your hand? That's what I read. He
[57:40] did that which was evil inside of the
[57:41] Lord. So most of them as a matter of
[57:44] fact um I think it was about 19% or or
[57:49] just eight of them out of all of them
[57:51] eight of them is where it was read
[57:53] different where he said and this king
[57:55] begin to reign at 8 years old or at 20
[57:58] years old and he did that which is right
[58:01] in the sight of the Lord according to
[58:03] what his fathers did. And when he made
[58:06] that decision to to do that which was
[58:08] right in the sight of the Lord, then God
[58:11] could begin to work off of that
[58:15] and begin to bring in the same glory
[58:18] that he originally had in Solomon's
[58:20] temple. They tapped into the glory of
[58:23] God when they just had a heart, soul,
[58:26] mind, and strength to say, "Wait a
[58:28] minute. Wait a minute. We're way off
[58:30] track here."
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And they rose to say, "Hold up,
[58:34] everybody. Hold up." And they began to
[58:36] do that which was right in the sight of
[58:38] the Lord. And it doesn't say that God
[58:41] came and told them to do that. Something
[58:44] rose within them inside. And remember,
[58:46] it was only eight out of all 42 kings.
[58:48] So the percentages aren't great here.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; It's very rare to have Christians rise
[58:54] up and and say something more than I
[58:56] want to be a Christian. But they want to
[58:58] rise up to this occasion and say, I'm
[59:00] not going to let the things of the world
[59:02] come into my life. I'm not going to let
[59:04] things destroy. I Hold on a minute.
[59:07] Things are happening. I'm getting off
[59:08] track. I'm declining. Stop all of this.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; It's only eight out of 42. And then
[59:16] there was a few of them, less than that,
[59:19] that began to develop a concern right
[59:22] away for the house of the Lord. And I
[59:26] remember saying in that sermon, and I
[59:28] don't remember very much these days, but
[59:30] I do remember saying, "If you want to
[59:32] find what moves the heart of God in your
[59:35] Bible, you'll find when somebody began
[59:39] to to express their desire for God's
[59:43] house
[59:45] and to clean God's house and to set
[59:48] God's house in order. This just this
[59:51] just moved the heart of God."
[59:54] And Hezekiah did that and he cleaned the
[59:57] house out and he he did everything. They
[59:59] established the or they established the
[1:00:01] singers. They put all of it back in and
[1:00:03] God gave them a re a revival under
[1:00:05] Hezekiah. And then what's interesting
[1:00:07] enough, and we won't talk anymore about
[1:00:08] the kings here, but I want to say
[1:00:10] there's only 19% of of those eight that
[1:00:14] were concerned about the state of the
[1:00:16] temple. What is the state of the temple?
[1:00:18] Everyone everybody wanted to still be
[1:00:20] called a Jew, a believer, but they
[1:00:23] didn't. They and they didn't want to be
[1:00:24] a heathen, but they begin to and this is
[1:00:27] how they begin to fall. They just like
[1:00:28] to adapt the heathen ways a little bit.
[1:00:30] And they didn't want to be a heathen,
[1:00:32] but they wanted to retain themselves as
[1:00:34] a Jew, but adapt to the heathen ways.
[1:00:37] And so now in those in those uh small
[1:00:40] 19%, they begin to say, "Hey, we want to
[1:00:44] build rebuild the temple. We want to
[1:00:47] redo things." And so without me having
[1:00:49] to read the two chapters about Josiah,
[1:00:51] I'm giving you that as your homework. It
[1:00:54] it would be um if you would mark it in
[1:00:57] your minds to read it. Uh how many would
[1:00:59] just read it uh this week? First Kings
[1:01:02] 22 and 23. There's only two chapters
[1:01:04] dedicated to his life. And we see that
[1:01:08] Josiah
[1:01:10] came into a time that he was the the
[1:01:13] fourth, third, and fourth generation. In
[1:01:15] other words, if you put that up again,
[1:01:16] Hezekiah had a revival and then the two
[1:01:20] kings after Hezekiah, which was Manasseh
[1:01:23] and Ammon, were terrible, terrible,
[1:01:27] terrible kings. And they integrated.
[1:01:30] They they began to allow the house of
[1:01:32] God to not be addressed. Things were
[1:01:34] falling apart. Besides the temple
[1:01:36] falling apart, the worship had stopped.
[1:01:39] They brought idols of Baal into the
[1:01:42] temple of God. This is over time now
[1:01:44] because remember you got you got 55
[1:01:46] years of Manasseh, two years of Ammon.
[1:01:49] So you have quite a few years there. And
[1:01:50] so what begin to happen? They begin
[1:01:52] begin to bring in all the idol worship
[1:01:54] still in the temple of the Lord. So they
[1:01:56] wanted to retain their identity with
[1:01:58] Jehovah God, but they wanted to
[1:02:00] integrate other worship.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; They wanted to borrow the ways of the
[1:02:04] heathen, but they didn't want to be
[1:02:06] called a heathen. So the temple of God
[1:02:09] just got so perverted. And and then and
[1:02:11] then you have boy I was reading it last
[1:02:13] night all the stuff all the groves a
[1:02:16] grove is an idol uh that they put
[1:02:19] outside of the temple and it begin to
[1:02:21] grow throughout the land. It's like a
[1:02:22] little statue whatever and this is where
[1:02:24] they became a sacred place where they
[1:02:27] begin to worship that. The Jews begin to
[1:02:28] worship that. And so then they brought
[1:02:30] in and then what happened was around
[1:02:32] around the temple they allowed all the
[1:02:35] houses in many places to begin to be
[1:02:37] filled with different uh heathen ways.
[1:02:41] And one of them was called uh houses of
[1:02:44] sodomites.
[1:02:48] Houses of sodomites.
[1:02:50] Now Sodom is supposed to be in Sodom.
[1:02:55] But now they had so backslid that they
[1:02:57] got sodomites living very close to them.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Sodom websites,
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; very close to their lives, too close.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; They had all kinds of priests from the
[1:03:14] idolatry coming over. They replaced them
[1:03:16] with the priest of the Lord. I could go
[1:03:18] on and on. I looked it up last night and
[1:03:20] some of the statues they had and I'm
[1:03:22] going to say it plainly although I can't
[1:03:25] even show you some of the statues that
[1:03:28] they've that they've dug up from back
[1:03:30] then of the the Babylonian the worship
[1:03:33] of Baal. It was many times related to a
[1:03:37] woman's naked body. I can't even show
[1:03:39] you some of them in this public audience
[1:03:42] because it's soft porn. Yeah.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't it interesting that the great
[1:03:47] thing today is a wholesale of a woman's
[1:03:51] body put before this entire world?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that we're not under the
[1:03:56] same idolatry. And the emphasis is
[1:03:58] showing a woman's body to a man and a
[1:04:02] woman buying to that, buying into that
[1:04:04] idolatry, showing more of her body in
[1:04:07] immodesty,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; taking off more clothes. And if she
[1:04:10] doesn't take them off, she wears a
[1:04:12] skintight dress to show the form of her
[1:04:14] body. When I seen those statues, I said,
[1:04:16] "Oh my goodness, we're there." But it's
[1:04:18] not statues. It's actually human beings
[1:04:22] displayed wholesale in front of this.
[1:04:25] What was it? It's the same idolatry that
[1:04:28] was back then to cause sons of God to
[1:04:31] fall.
[1:04:34] making the woman's body an idol that he
[1:04:36] can see all the time through on his
[1:04:38] phone and different things and making
[1:04:40] the woman come under that spirit that
[1:04:42] she shows her body to the rest of the
[1:04:44] world. That's why here we believe in
[1:04:46] modesty. We believe a woman should cover
[1:04:48] her body. We believe a woman should not
[1:04:50] send the message of trying to show more
[1:04:52] of her body to draw lust from men. We
[1:04:55] believe modesty because the word has
[1:04:57] brought us back to that because we are
[1:04:59] not idol worshippers here.
[1:05:01] We don't make the woman an idol or her
[1:05:04] body an idol.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; So, I'm way away from my notes here, but
[1:05:11] Josiah sees all of this and he just he
[1:05:16] doesn't know all he doesn't act yet on
[1:05:19] cleaning the house of the Lord. He acts
[1:05:22] on that later, but he he wants to
[1:05:25] something comes in his heart to begin to
[1:05:28] repair the house of the Lord.
[1:05:30] So in these kings what happened is it
[1:05:32] started in their heart their hearts the
[1:05:35] hearts of kings got away from God but
[1:05:37] then when these come you see when the
[1:05:40] ones I want to focus on the ones who
[1:05:42] wanted to restore the temple clean the
[1:05:47] temple
[1:05:49] because why and why did God love that
[1:05:51] because the temple is where worship took
[1:05:53] place and when you tamper with the
[1:05:56] temple of God you tamper with worship.
[1:05:59] worship
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; and God hates that
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; because he wants our worship, our lives
[1:06:07] and our worship to be free.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And if it becomes tainted with sodomites
[1:06:15] and with sodomite spirits and with
[1:06:17] idolatry and all kinds of things, it's
[1:06:21] not free worship. No matter how much you
[1:06:23] try to worship freely, the temple of
[1:06:24] God's not free. So, you can't worship
[1:06:26] freely.
[1:06:28] Can you say amen?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; So now,
[1:06:32] and many of you are starting to see
[1:06:33] probably no doubt what I'm talking about
[1:06:36] this this morning. And that's they when
[1:06:39] they turned their attention to the house
[1:06:40] of God and cleaned it and put it in
[1:06:43] order, it pleased the Lord so much. And
[1:06:45] so I've come along now in my notes so I
[1:06:47] can skip down here and come to Hezekiah.
[1:06:50] And then the next two kings messed up.
[1:06:53] They perverted the temple in such a
[1:06:54] terrible way. I don't have time to
[1:06:56] express it, but you can read it right
[1:06:58] there. The two kings before Josiah, it
[1:07:01] was the worst of the worst. Manasseh and
[1:07:03] Ammon just it declined in that third and
[1:07:06] fourth. Notice now the third and fourth
[1:07:08] generation from Hezekiah. It declined
[1:07:12] worse than it ever got. Except for a
[1:07:14] young man who rose and he breaks the
[1:07:17] cycle, the normal cycle of decline.
[1:07:23] Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Josiah
[1:07:26] said, "I'm going to break this cycle of
[1:07:29] revival and death."
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I will not allow this decline to
[1:07:34] continue.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; And the first thing he addressed was the
[1:07:39] house of the Lord. Cleaning and
[1:07:41] repairing the house of the Lord. Let me
[1:07:44] say something to you. Where do you start
[1:07:45] in getting back to revival?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; This house.
[1:07:50] because some of you have already caught
[1:07:51] it. It's the house of the Lord is not
[1:07:54] that temple in Jerusalem. The house
[1:07:56] which will be restored someday, but
[1:07:58] that's not that temple. It's not this
[1:08:00] church. It's not a building anywhere.
[1:08:03] The people of the Lord are the house of
[1:08:06] the Lord. And that's why he loves when
[1:08:09] somebody sanctifies
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; their house
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; for worship.
[1:08:17] A lot of those decisions are made and
[1:08:20] nobody can see it because back then when
[1:08:22] Josiah said, "I want you to get what
[1:08:24] funds do we have left?" I'm paraphrasing
[1:08:26] because I don't have time to read it. I
[1:08:27] wish I could. What funds do we have left
[1:08:29] in the in the kitty here? And they go
[1:08:31] get all the funds. They said, "Okay, I
[1:08:32] want you to take all the funds and I
[1:08:34] want you to employ carpenters. I want
[1:08:36] you to employ electricians." Well, wait
[1:08:38] a minute. I'm going too far there. I
[1:08:39] want you to employ all these contractors
[1:08:41] and we're going to begin repairing. Now,
[1:08:43] he's not cleaning yet cuz there's all
[1:08:45] his idolatry because he don't have that
[1:08:47] revelation yet. He's just got a
[1:08:48] revelation to repair the house of the
[1:08:50] Lord. This is pitiful that we're
[1:08:52] treating the house of the Lord this way.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And so, he pays out of the fund all
[1:08:57] these contractors to come and start
[1:09:00] repairing the house of the Lord, just
[1:09:02] looking at it and the what what happened
[1:09:05] to this what happened to this altar?
[1:09:06] Nobody's taking care of the house of
[1:09:08] God. And so, he began to do that and God
[1:09:11] was already pleased. But guess what
[1:09:13] happened? Guess what happened? While the
[1:09:17] men are there repairing,
[1:09:21] they they look
[1:09:23] somewhere and they found the book, the
[1:09:27] scroll.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; This is how far they had been away from
[1:09:32] God. That even the scroll, the core of
[1:09:36] what brought them any revival was lost,
[1:09:41] hidden. couldn't find it. Now, it's
[1:09:44] pretty bad. You know, it reminds me of
[1:09:46] some people with Bibles with dust on
[1:09:47] them on the shelf at their house.
[1:09:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:59] Josiah said something rose in him and
[1:10:02] said
[1:10:04] he became literally grieved and smitten
[1:10:06] by the condition of the Lord's house.
[1:10:11] If there is not problems with that,
[1:10:14] then you won't seek God for more. In
[1:10:17] other words, if if we have problems in
[1:10:20] the Lord's house and it's affecting the
[1:10:22] worship,
[1:10:26] we won't seek for God more.
[1:10:30] You understand what I'm saying?
[1:10:32] Something has to rise up and be
[1:10:34] literally grieved and smitten by the
[1:10:35] condition of the Lord's house. That's
[1:10:38] where revival starts.
[1:10:41] And if if if there's not problems with
[1:10:44] that, then if there's problems with
[1:10:45] that, then you won't seek God for more.
[1:10:48] Uh Francis Chan
[1:10:50] uh minister said, "The world needs
[1:10:52] Christians
[1:10:54] who don't tolerate the complacency of
[1:10:58] their own lives."
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; The world needs Christians. I don't know
[1:11:05] if you have that quote there or not.
[1:11:07] Needs Christians who don't tolerate the
[1:11:10] complacency of their own lives. So now
[1:11:14] I'm asking you to read 2 Kings 22 and
[1:11:17] 23, but I've just brought it into points
[1:11:18] of what happens in chapter 22 4-7. He
[1:11:22] completely repairs the house of God.
[1:11:25] Josiah sent once to get the funds,
[1:11:27] directed all the funds to the full
[1:11:28] repair of the temple. His intention was
[1:11:30] to clean and repair the temple of God.
[1:11:32] He was not praying yet for God to send
[1:11:35] the glory down. He wanted to repair the
[1:11:37] temple first. Is anybody listening this
[1:11:39] morning? He wasn't praying yet for God
[1:11:41] to send the glory down because you can't
[1:11:43] ask for the glory to come down when the
[1:11:46] temple needs to be repaired.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; First things first, sanctification
[1:11:52] first.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying, "God, send a revival.
[1:11:57] Send your send your glory like you did
[1:11:59] the days of Solomon." You can't do that
[1:12:01] when you're looking at a temple that's
[1:12:03] full of idolatry and full of repairs
[1:12:05] that need to be made and full of things
[1:12:07] to be addressed. And so you say in this
[1:12:09] day, you would say, "God, come and
[1:12:11] sanctify this temple. Come and sanctify
[1:12:14] my mind. God, clean me. Send your Holy
[1:12:17] Spirit first to cleanse my temple."
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Second chapter 22:8 through10 he
[1:12:25] surprisingly finds the a book the book
[1:12:28] in the house of God.
[1:12:30] You know they can they say you can find
[1:12:32] some pretty amazing things when you
[1:12:34] clean your house thoroughly.
[1:12:39] Some maids have said that they found
[1:12:43] some very interesting things that the
[1:12:45] owners of the home thought was amazing.
[1:12:49] Some one maid said she found a 1980s
[1:12:51] Polaroid camera still loaded with the
[1:12:54] film.
[1:12:57] Some found a stack of handwritten love
[1:12:59] letters. Boy, that's wonderful.
[1:13:02] Some found a guitar pick in the couch
[1:13:04] and the owner said, "I've been looking
[1:13:05] for that guitar pick for years."
[1:13:10] It's amazing. Uh the conversation this
[1:13:13] morning bringing uh Ellie to Sunday
[1:13:15] school and her dad had said, "Brother
[1:13:18] Paul, we got issues with mice again
[1:13:20] coming in the garage." I get all
[1:13:22] frustrated with that because I didn't
[1:13:25] invite them.
[1:13:27] I know it's getting cold and that's why
[1:13:29] they're coming. I did not invite them.
[1:13:31] And why? because this is my house
[1:13:34] and I take care of enough grandkids and
[1:13:36] and people and I feed enough people and
[1:13:39] I keep them warm. I pay the electric
[1:13:40] bill. I pay the gas bill. I've got
[1:13:42] enough on my hands. I'm not going to
[1:13:44] take care of an entire woods of mice
[1:13:47] that need to keep warm in the winter.
[1:13:49] I'm sorry. Go somewhere else. Go to
[1:13:51] another house. And I And so Ellie and I
[1:13:53] had this long conversation about it. I
[1:13:55] said, "I'm going to have to get some
[1:13:56] killer. We're going to have to get them
[1:13:57] out because I only want Ellie. This
[1:14:00] house is to keep you warm. This house is
[1:14:02] to keep us warm, not the mice. So she
[1:14:04] said, "Well, maybe we can get some coats
[1:14:06] for the mice so they can stay warm."
[1:14:10] And unfortunately, I had to say, "You
[1:14:12] know what? I God will take care of the
[1:14:14] mice and their warmth. I'm not going to
[1:14:17] take care of them. They've got to go for
[1:14:19] several other reasons also that we won't
[1:14:21] talk about.
[1:14:25] They leave things, you know, places.
[1:14:28] You know, Jesus said in Luke 15:8,
[1:14:32] "Either what woman having 10 pieces of
[1:14:35] silver, if she lose one piece, do not
[1:14:38] light a candle and sweep the house and
[1:14:42] seek diligently until she find it."
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; What's that talking about? It's talking
[1:14:49] about sanctification. It's talking about
[1:14:51] you lost something, but there's such a
[1:14:54] heart to diligently seek and sweep the
[1:14:57] house until you find it.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He needs that diligence concern. And
[1:15:05] notice, did you notice that what she
[1:15:07] lost was within her own house? She
[1:15:10] didn't have to go to the church to get
[1:15:12] it.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Under the mystery of God, I might as
[1:15:15] well say it. Everything that you need is
[1:15:18] within you. Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Paul said it's Christ in you, the hope
[1:15:23] of glory.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; But if something gets lost, and she only
[1:15:26] lost one of the the coins, one of the
[1:15:29] coins. I teach this to young people and
[1:15:30] she lost one of the coins and those went
[1:15:33] back to the the went back to her what
[1:15:35] she was as a single person the the coins
[1:15:38] of her purity and things like that. And
[1:15:40] she got desperate because if she
[1:15:42] couldn't prove with those coins to her
[1:15:44] husband, it shows there was some
[1:15:46] impurities. So to keep that in place,
[1:15:48] she had to have that there. And so she
[1:15:50] said, "If I lost it, I've got to find
[1:15:51] it. Let's see the diligence to sweep the
[1:15:54] house. I'm not going to do anything else
[1:15:55] until this is till I find what's lost."
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, it was within our own house.
[1:16:01] Josiah found the book, not over in some
[1:16:04] other heathen land. He found the book
[1:16:07] within God's house,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; but it was covered over. It was it was
[1:16:13] lost. It wasn't appreciated. It wasn't
[1:16:16] brought to the forefront. It was
[1:16:18] completely gone. And this was the key to
[1:16:20] revival is to get that book. They
[1:16:22] brought that book out. The second point
[1:16:24] here is that he surprisingly found a
[1:16:26] book in the house of God. Excuse me.
[1:16:29] Number three. Oh, let me finish. Wait,
[1:16:31] wait, let me finish Luke 15. It's It's
[1:16:33] wonderful. Verse 9. And when she had
[1:16:36] found it, Luke 15:9, when she found it,
[1:16:40] she called her friends and her neighbors
[1:16:42] together, saying, "Rejoice with me, for
[1:16:44] I have found the peace which I have
[1:16:47] lost." Likewise, I say unto you, there
[1:16:50] is joy in the presence of the angels of
[1:16:52] God over one sinner that repenteth.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; It even brings joy to heaven when a lost
[1:16:59] one comes back home. Why? We should be
[1:17:02] the same way. Can you say, "Amen." Why
[1:17:04] should be we be rejoicing? Something
[1:17:06] that's lost gets found again. According
[1:17:09] to Jesus, there's great joy that comes
[1:17:11] when someone is diligent to clean the
[1:17:13] house and they're going to find the lost
[1:17:15] ones. Whatever was lost in your life,
[1:17:18] whatever has been lost in your life and
[1:17:20] covered up. Are you listening to me this
[1:17:23] morning? Whatever. Maybe you had
[1:17:25] something, but whatever's lost,
[1:17:27] whatever's covered up, maybe you got
[1:17:29] away from the Lord for years, God is
[1:17:32] calling to sweep your house, your house.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Don't say if I need to go get it at a
[1:17:37] convention or a camp meeting. No, no, he
[1:17:39] it's within you somewhere. It's just
[1:17:41] covered up.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:17:46] great joy comes when somebody begins to
[1:17:50] find that there ought to be more joy.
[1:17:52] Can you say amen? There ought to be joy
[1:17:55] like the angels of someone who was gone
[1:17:57] for years, but they're finding God
[1:18:01] again.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; We ought to shout over that. Can you say
[1:18:05] amen? They find the book, they dust it
[1:18:07] off, they bring it to the king, the
[1:18:09] priest brings it to the king. You know,
[1:18:13] that's when God is working with the
[1:18:14] priest and the preachers and the scribes
[1:18:16] and everyone to get the book to the
[1:18:18] people. Why? You can't have a revival
[1:18:21] without the word.
[1:18:24] It takes a young person sold out and
[1:18:27] ready to clean God's house. And then it
[1:18:30] takes the word, a young man, Josiah. It
[1:18:32] takes a young person. Takes anybody. But
[1:18:35] let me emphasize the youth. All it takes
[1:18:37] is a young person to get the fervor in
[1:18:39] your heart to clean God's house. I don't
[1:18:42] mean come and be the maintenance man
[1:18:43] here. I mean your house.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; What are you letting in your house?
[1:18:50] What are you looking at at your on your
[1:18:52] phone?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; When I talk to young people, I go to
[1:18:56] that scripture about sexual things in
[1:18:59] first Corinthians. And you know the Paul
[1:19:01] the way Paul brings it, he says he talks
[1:19:03] about your vessel and he says it's not
[1:19:05] right to take your vessel that it's a
[1:19:07] temple and sell it to prostitutes. It
[1:19:10] would be wrong to do that
[1:19:12] because why? Because it's you're the
[1:19:15] temple of the Holy Ghost. And if
[1:19:18] somebody does not get that revelation of
[1:19:21] what your temple is, you will think the
[1:19:23] temple is when you go to church or when
[1:19:25] you go to camp.
[1:19:27] But Paul's saying, "No, no, you need the
[1:19:29] revelation. This is the final resting
[1:19:32] place of the Holy Ghost. This is the
[1:19:35] temple." And you can't take a room of
[1:19:37] the temple. You can't take a section of
[1:19:40] the temple and rent it out. It all
[1:19:43] belongs to him. Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; It all must be cleaned out for him.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; So a young man becomes sold out to clean
[1:19:54] the house. The next thing he does,
[1:19:56] chapter 22, I'm moving through these
[1:19:57] points now. Chapter 22 10-11 says it
[1:20:01] speaks of the book is open to the young
[1:20:03] king. This is a great great thing. The
[1:20:05] book is open. So the book has to be
[1:20:07] open. This word can't be open to just
[1:20:09] preachers. It has to be open to all of
[1:20:11] you. The book has to be opened to you by
[1:20:14] revelation. I know it was opened in book
[1:20:16] Revelations chapter 5. I know it was
[1:20:19] open then by the lamb, but it has to be
[1:20:21] opened supernaturally to you.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; How will I know? We'll see the fruits
[1:20:27] from your life that the book has been
[1:20:29] opened. You'll come to a church and hear
[1:20:31] a preacher say, "The lamb has opened the
[1:20:33] book and broken the seals off the book.
[1:20:35] It's been brought back to the people and
[1:20:37] it's been open to the people." You'll
[1:20:38] hear me preach that. But my question is,
[1:20:41] has it been open to you?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's not good enough. It's just open to
[1:20:46] the dispensation. It's got to be open to
[1:20:49] you. And this is what Josiah sat there
[1:20:52] and that priest took it and he opened
[1:20:54] that scroll to him. And then he began to
[1:20:57] read it. The book has to be open to you.
[1:20:59] Chapter 22 11 says, here's his reaction
[1:21:02] to the opening of the book. That priest
[1:21:04] began to read that book to him and
[1:21:06] personally he was smitten. He he he rent
[1:21:09] his clothes. Uh what rent and what that
[1:21:12] means is repentance. Renting some of
[1:21:14] these clothes is not just physically
[1:21:16] tearing your garment. That's what he
[1:21:18] did. But it's a symbolic act of deep
[1:21:20] grief, mourning and anguish. Josiah come
[1:21:24] into a place of mourning and anguish
[1:21:26] because he's reading this book and he's
[1:21:28] seeing how far away the people of God
[1:21:31] are and the temple is away from the
[1:21:34] original thing
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; and it's affecting him. It's it's making
[1:21:38] him grieve. He rents his clothes. This
[1:21:40] custom of renting the clothes
[1:21:42] represented profound sorrow over loss,
[1:21:45] disaster, or wrongdoing and was often
[1:21:47] accompanied by other signs like wearing
[1:21:50] sackcloth. Job did that. While it was a
[1:21:52] significant expression of emotion,
[1:21:55] prophets later contrasted this outward
[1:21:57] ritual with the importance of an inner
[1:22:00] heartfelt transformation
[1:22:03] of repentance. It's not just that you
[1:22:05] repent, but there's a transformation
[1:22:08] that comes from your repentance.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's repentance. He rent his clothes.
[1:22:13] I'm He was deeply affected by the word.
[1:22:16] He was How many would just agree with
[1:22:18] me? Just raise your hands now.
[1:22:21] Don't let me, Lord, just hear your word.
[1:22:23] Let me be affected by this word. Don't
[1:22:26] let this Sunday be another Sunday. I can
[1:22:28] hear good preaching, but God, open this
[1:22:31] book to me and let me be affected by it.
[1:22:33] Let there come an urgency in my heart.
[1:22:37] And that's what he wept. Rent closed. He
[1:22:40] wept to see how far the temple and the
[1:22:42] people were away from God. How far he
[1:22:44] was away from God. And he said, "I'm the
[1:22:46] king here. I'm in a position to do
[1:22:48] something. Look how far we are away." So
[1:22:49] it starts with me. It start the revival
[1:22:51] starts with me. What made him see what
[1:22:55] made him see is that book being opened
[1:22:57] and made him see the true identity. And
[1:22:59] I've preached this. The opening of the
[1:23:01] lamb's book of life shows the true
[1:23:03] identity. And when it happened to
[1:23:05] Josiah, he's seen the true original
[1:23:07] identity of the Lord's house. He's seen
[1:23:09] the identity of himself. Oh, here I am.
[1:23:12] I'm positioned. I'm the king. I can do
[1:23:14] this. God will anoint me to do it. And
[1:23:16] he's seen the identity of the people.
[1:23:18] The book revealed his true identity, the
[1:23:21] church's true identity, and the identity
[1:23:23] of the temple.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; The book, it's not because he went to
[1:23:28] church. He found in the book his
[1:23:31] identity. Moving on, the next thing that
[1:23:33] happens chapter 22 13- 14 he seeks for
[1:23:37] the Lord the Lord for for the word for
[1:23:40] himself. The next point chapter 22:15
[1:23:43] to20
[1:23:45] I can send these to you these
[1:23:46] scriptures. He breaks the cycle of the
[1:23:48] curse and gets a personal revival in his
[1:23:51] time in his season. I want a revival
[1:23:54] now. I want to change now. Nobody's with
[1:23:57] me. I'm going to do it. Notice where it
[1:23:59] rings the revival. He seeks, he begins
[1:24:02] to seek God. It's the book that's open
[1:24:05] to him. Can you say amen? And the desire
[1:24:08] to change the temple. This is a revival.
[1:24:11] How many remember brother Brandham said,
[1:24:13] I I think 10 or 20 times he's at Lake
[1:24:16] Michigan and he's watching the waves and
[1:24:18] sometimes those waves get real big,
[1:24:20] don't they, Michael? You know that Lake
[1:24:22] Michigan, you were just over there
[1:24:24] catching all that big salmon and all
[1:24:26] that. Uh, you guys, you people got to
[1:24:28] see some pictures of fish this guy got.
[1:24:30] Anybody who doesn't want to, you ought
[1:24:32] to go with him to get some big fish.
[1:24:34] Brother Tom, we haven't got any big fish
[1:24:36] yet, we got to go with Michael. That's
[1:24:39] just a little side note.
[1:24:41] You see, in Lake Michigan with all the
[1:24:43] waves, he says, "Why has that happened?
[1:24:45] What's the purpose?" And it seems like a
[1:24:46] revival. And that's what they view
[1:24:48] revival. all the waves of the Holy
[1:24:50] Spirit coming. He said, "But you don't
[1:24:52] see what the waves are doing. It's
[1:24:54] blowing up all the trash out of the
[1:24:56] water up to the shore."
[1:24:59] He said, "That's what a revival is,
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; is to get all the trash out
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; because then you don't have to worry
[1:25:06] about the enthusiasm, the excitement,
[1:25:09] the spirit of freedom in your heart,
[1:25:10] feeling free to serve the Lord because
[1:25:13] the trash is out, the idolatry is out,
[1:25:16] the temple is ready for the glory to
[1:25:19] come down to."
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; The judgments on the nation, I want you
[1:25:24] to notice something. And I can't read
[1:25:26] all these, but the judgments on the
[1:25:28] nation are not going to change. But God
[1:25:31] will honor his tender heart because they
[1:25:34] he sends the book to and tells a
[1:25:37] prophetist what he wants to do. And the
[1:25:40] prophetist prophesies and she says this
[1:25:43] is in
[1:25:45] chapter 22:15-22.
[1:25:47] She says the judgments of God are not
[1:25:50] going to change on Judah because of
[1:25:52] their rebellion. But she says, "Because
[1:25:55] of your tender heart towards this book,"
[1:25:58] is what she says, "Towards this word and
[1:26:01] your desire during your days will be a
[1:26:05] revival."
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Notice the power of somebody just saying
[1:26:10] he's even holding off the How many know
[1:26:12] we're living in a day when the judgments
[1:26:13] of God are pending on this world?
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're not going to change that.
[1:26:18] It's coming. It's not if, it's when.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; So, you're not going to change that word
[1:26:22] of the Lord. But notice the power we
[1:26:24] have when we give our lives to God. When
[1:26:26] we seek him with all of our heart. When
[1:26:28] we're in the book and the book is open
[1:26:30] to us and we're saying, "Lord, clean my
[1:26:32] house to serve you." This season of
[1:26:34] Josiah became a personal revival.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Even though judgment was still looming.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The power of that is amazing. Friends,
[1:26:44] in chapter 23, moving along, he reads it
[1:26:48] to the others and they all make a
[1:26:49] covenant. You can read that. This is
[1:26:51] what happens to a person with a true
[1:26:52] revival.
[1:26:54] It comes out to others. I'm not ashamed
[1:26:56] of the gospel. I'm not ashamed of the
[1:26:57] word. I'll read it in front of
[1:26:58] everybody. Josiah didn't just say, "I'm
[1:27:00] going to read this just in my own my own
[1:27:02] house." No, I'm going to read it to
[1:27:04] everybody. See who's on board with me.
[1:27:06] I'm identified with this book because
[1:27:08] it's identified me. We're going to do
[1:27:10] this. Nothing is going to stop us. When
[1:27:12] John gets the book and eats it, it's not
[1:27:14] just for him. He said he would prophesy
[1:27:17] again to many kindreds, tongues, and
[1:27:19] nations. When God opens the book, it'll
[1:27:21] do something for you, but the revival
[1:27:24] will spread to other people.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Chapter 23 verse4 through 24, he takes
[1:27:30] the book and drives out every demon and
[1:27:32] influence of idolatry. I You can't
[1:27:34] believe all the stuff. He not only drove
[1:27:37] them out, he crushed every idol. You
[1:27:40] know what? He didn't just take a a
[1:27:42] sledgehammer and crack the idol. He took
[1:27:45] it and had all his servants with him
[1:27:47] take every idol and pound them to powder
[1:27:52] and ashes.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And some of the ashes he took and put on
[1:27:55] the bones of the priest that he had
[1:27:57] burnt.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; What's that saying? He's serious about
[1:28:01] cleaning house.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Just grind it to power powder. I don't
[1:28:07] want any of this near us. I don't even
[1:28:09] want to see one evidence of it being
[1:28:12] around here.
[1:28:14] Praise the Lord. I hope you catch it.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; God was pleased with that diligence.
[1:28:19] It's not just saying, "Oh, I need to I
[1:28:21] need to slow down from what I'm watching
[1:28:24] here." You need to you might need to
[1:28:26] stop watching it
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; for the rest of your life.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; You might need to grind it to powder.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; That's hard preaching, Brother Paul.
[1:28:44] Clean your house,
[1:28:46] which is God's house. This house is his
[1:28:48] house. This house is his house. This
[1:28:51] house is his house. And we need a zeal
[1:28:53] and a passion. I hope you remember the
[1:28:55] King of Kings. We talked about all the
[1:28:58] kings, some that clean the house of the
[1:28:59] Lord. But did you know the King of Kings
[1:29:02] came into the temple one day and seen
[1:29:05] the money changers
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; and they quoted the scripture? What's he
[1:29:10] doing? And he grabbed a whip, put a whip
[1:29:12] together, and he whipped them out of the
[1:29:14] house of God. And somebody quoted the
[1:29:17] scripture, "The zeal from Psalms." The
[1:29:20] zeal of thine house has eaten me up.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; He become angry,
[1:29:27] righteous anger at the perversions and
[1:29:31] the money changers. He said, "This is
[1:29:34] not supposed to be happening in God's
[1:29:37] house." Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; He whipped them out. King of kings. He
[1:29:43] cleaned up the temple.
[1:29:45] Josiah
[1:29:47] grind them to powder. What kind of zeal
[1:29:49] is this? Then the next point, the last
[1:29:52] one is
[1:29:53] chapter 23 and verse 7, tore down the
[1:29:56] houses of the sodomites that were close
[1:29:57] to God. Let me just say, it's amazing
[1:29:59] how close Sodom had moved in around the
[1:30:01] house of God.
[1:30:04] And when he went and burnt down the
[1:30:06] houses of the Sodommites, that's what he
[1:30:08] did. Destroyed the houses of the
[1:30:10] Sodommites living close to the house of
[1:30:12] God. It was a it became a personal
[1:30:16] revelation to them that Sodom should
[1:30:18] never be this close to God's temple.
[1:30:25] I don't have any more strength to preach
[1:30:26] this now.
[1:30:28] It became a revelation that Sodom and
[1:30:31] the spirit of Sodom should never ever be
[1:30:35] this close to the house of the Lord.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And he tore those houses down. The
[1:30:44] Sodommites,
[1:30:45] the websites
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; takes a revelation
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; because see a lot of people said if I
[1:30:53] can just they're okay as long as they
[1:30:56] don't come in the temple. No, they live
[1:30:58] too close
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; to the temple. You want to be a
[1:31:02] sodomite, you want you belong in Sodom.
[1:31:07] Can you say amen?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; That stuff is not meant for you. It's
[1:31:11] meant for sodomites.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Why are you looking at stuff that's not
[1:31:14] meant for you? It's meant for sodomites.
[1:31:16] And if you're not a sodomite, why are
[1:31:18] they living close to your house?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:27] Luther, Martin Luther said, "All the
[1:31:30] cunning of the devil is exercised in
[1:31:33] trying to tear us away from the word."
[1:31:35] Can you say, "Amen."
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; All the cunning of the devil's exercised
[1:31:39] and trying to tear us away the word
[1:31:40] because that's the revival. Josiah broke
[1:31:42] the cycle. He interrupted the normal
[1:31:44] cycle of death and revival. Give me just
[1:31:47] about 10 more minutes if you would.
[1:31:52] Josiah interrupted the normal cycle of
[1:31:54] death and revival. He interrupted and
[1:31:55] says, "No, we're going to stop. We're
[1:31:57] going to stop this. We're going to clean
[1:31:59] God's temple." He said, "I'm not a
[1:32:01] statistic. I'm not like the the kings
[1:32:04] before me. I'm not I'm not going to take
[1:32:06] let this decline take over. I'm not a
[1:32:09] normal person. I'm a son of God." The
[1:32:11] book caused him to catch fire and the
[1:32:13] zeal began to eat him up with desire
[1:32:16] with desire to connect with God and find
[1:32:19] out what this word was really for.
[1:32:22] Brother Bram says, "We're not building
[1:32:23] an organization. I'm not here this
[1:32:26] morning to build an organization. Christ
[1:32:28] never sent me to build an organization.
[1:32:30] Christ sent me to build individuals to
[1:32:33] the stature of Jesus Christ." That
[1:32:37] this is what the message is for.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Never to make a denomination. The second
[1:32:42] and third, fourth generation try to say,
[1:32:44] "Let's try to make this. This is our
[1:32:46] belief. This is a movement." No, no, no.
[1:32:48] Don't do that with the message. Don't
[1:32:51] say I'm in the message. Say I want the
[1:32:54] message in me. The message is Christ
[1:32:58] revealed.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Let's lose this term being in the
[1:33:01] message. Oh, that person, that young
[1:33:03] person, they left the message. Well,
[1:33:05] it's probably because the message Christ
[1:33:07] was never in them.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a comfort blank. Say, I'm
[1:33:13] in I'm in the group. I go to where? No,
[1:33:16] no, we got to stop all that
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham himself says,
[1:33:21] "I'm not here to build an organization.
[1:33:23] Christ sent me to build what?
[1:33:25] Individuals." What's the revival?
[1:33:27] Individual revivals.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; He sent me to build individuals to the
[1:33:32] stature of Jesus Christ that they might
[1:33:34] be the powerhouse and the dwelling place
[1:33:36] of the spirit. How many raise your hand
[1:33:38] and say, "God, make me a powerhouse for
[1:33:40] your spirit
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; by his word." See, build up the
[1:33:43] individual to that place. Not building
[1:33:45] an organization to the greater denomin
[1:33:47] to a greater denomination, but build the
[1:33:50] individual to sons and daughters of God.
[1:33:54] That's the idea.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Another place in thirst, he says, you
[1:33:57] call for revivals, you wait for the
[1:33:59] church to have a revival. Well, that
[1:34:01] ain't the revival for you. The revival
[1:34:03] ought to begin right in you. When you
[1:34:05] begin to thirst for God, there might not
[1:34:08] be another member of the church wanting
[1:34:10] that revival. If it breaks out in you,
[1:34:13] it will break out other places.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I want to make one more point.
[1:34:21] I didn't put it in the points of Josiah,
[1:34:23] but I read it in the text this morning.
[1:34:26] And it said,
[1:34:28] the king, verse 21 of chapter 23, the
[1:34:30] king commanded all the people, saying,
[1:34:32] keep the Passover unto the Lord your God
[1:34:34] as is written in the book. Surely there
[1:34:36] was not holden such a Passover from the
[1:34:38] days of the judges. You know what that's
[1:34:39] saying? The feast of the Passover
[1:34:44] was so ignored since all the way back to
[1:34:46] the judges. This special 7-day feast.
[1:34:50] And you know what it was about? It's to
[1:34:52] get together and remember and tell our
[1:34:55] kids and feel feel what it's like to be
[1:34:59] in bondage and feel what it's like to be
[1:35:03] out.
[1:35:05] And God said, "Every year you come back
[1:35:07] and celebrate the feast of tab, feast of
[1:35:09] excuse me, Passover." And Josiah said,
[1:35:12] "Hey, hey, we have lost this, but we
[1:35:15] need to bring this one back because we
[1:35:18] re we've been in bondage again."
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Friends, they were back in bondage
[1:35:26] living in Jerusalem, but they were in
[1:35:29] bondage by idols.
[1:35:32] And he said, "Just like we were in under
[1:35:34] Pharaoh, now we're in bondage again." Is
[1:35:37] anybody listening to this, but if we're
[1:35:39] not careful, you say, "I come out of
[1:35:41] denominations. I come out of the world
[1:35:42] years ago, but Satan can still have you
[1:35:45] in bondage."
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We're bringing this feast
[1:35:49] of Passover. We're going to do it just
[1:35:51] like, but we want our children to know
[1:35:53] something's happening. There's a revival
[1:35:55] happening, and that is we've been in
[1:35:56] bondage for two kings, but we're coming
[1:35:59] out of bondage.
[1:36:01] and we're feeling what it's like to be
[1:36:04] free.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to bring this one back
[1:36:09] and they said there wasn't anything
[1:36:10] since the day of the judges and I bet
[1:36:12] that was the greatest Passover seven
[1:36:15] days with the families as it had ever
[1:36:17] been because why? A revival struck.
[1:36:19] They're having the feeling they cleaned
[1:36:22] the house, cleaned everything out, got
[1:36:24] rid of the house of sodomites, got and
[1:36:26] they're having this feeling of revival.
[1:36:28] I like to feel the feeling of revival.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with it, but you
[1:36:33] can't get to it until the houses are
[1:36:36] cleaned out.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; They're feeling
[1:36:42] what it like. What's it like? We got
[1:36:44] that song. This is how it feels to be
[1:36:46] free. That's what they're they're
[1:36:49] saying, children, we're celebrating here
[1:36:52] because this is how it feels to be free.
[1:36:56] Come here, Stevie.
[1:36:59] I told Stevie to stay in these handcuffs
[1:37:01] the whole time I preached
[1:37:06] because I wanted Stevie to have the
[1:37:08] feeling of what it's like. He's a pretty
[1:37:10] exuberant person. He says amen to me. He
[1:37:13] raises his hand. He's into the service.
[1:37:16] But it was more difficult today because
[1:37:17] he's bound the whole entire service. How
[1:37:20] was it, Stevie?
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Pretty bad.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Held back.
[1:37:28] I wanted him to experience what it's
[1:37:30] like. And anybody who's ever felt like
[1:37:32] you're in bondage, you can't be free in
[1:37:34] your worship. Something's wrong. You
[1:37:35] know the feeling of that.
[1:37:40] But now
[1:37:42] I'm going to
[1:37:46] let Stevie know another feeling
[1:37:53] and we'll just let him
[1:37:56] express that after a whole service being
[1:38:00] like this.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[1:38:06] Feel
[1:38:09] pretty good.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, it feels amazing.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You want to do anything else? You want
[1:38:12] to do anything else? Feels pretty free.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I can.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Girls will still like you. Sure hope so.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Nobody can underestimate the feeling of
[1:38:26] what it's like to be free.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; This is how it feels to be free.
[1:38:33] This is what it feels
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:37] Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, Gideon. You got to come and
[1:38:47] sing.
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; We need to bring it up or not?
[1:38:59] This is how it feels to be free.
[1:39:02] This is what it means to know that I am
[1:39:07] forgiven.
[1:39:09] This is how it feels to be free. To see
[1:39:12] that light more than I imagine.
[1:39:17] This is how it feels.
[1:39:22] This is how it feels to be free.
[1:39:27] Amen. This is how it feels to be free.
[1:39:32] This is what it means to know that I am
[1:39:36] forgiven. This is how it feels to be
[1:39:39] free.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; To see that life can be more than I
[1:39:44] imagine.
[1:39:46] This is how it feels to be free.
[1:39:50] This is how it feels to be free.
[1:39:56] [Music]
[1:40:05] Oh, there's a wall that has been
[1:40:07] standing since the day that Adam fell.
[1:40:10] Sin is where it started. Sin is where it
[1:40:14] hell. Speaking as a prisoner who was
[1:40:18] there to live, to tell. I remember how
[1:40:21] it fell.
[1:40:23] Yes. I could hear the sound of freedom
[1:40:27] like a distant voice who called and
[1:40:30] beckoned me to follow where I had never
[1:40:33] gone. And though my heart is willing, I
[1:40:37] just stood there at the wall praying
[1:40:39] somehow it would fall.
[1:40:44] But at the cross I found the doorway and
[1:40:46] a handheld held the key. And when the
[1:40:49] chains fell at my feet, for the first
[1:40:52] time I could see.
[1:40:56] Oh, this is how it feels to be free.
[1:41:00] This is what it means to know that I am
[1:41:05] forgiven. This is how it feels to be
[1:41:08] free.
[1:41:10] To see life can be more than I imagine.
[1:41:14] This is how it feels to be free. Oh,
[1:41:19] this is how it feels to be free.
[1:41:26] Oh,
[1:41:28] oh,
[1:41:30] this is how it feels to be free.
[1:41:34] This is what it means to know that I am
[1:41:38] forgiven. This is how it feels to be
[1:41:42] free.
[1:41:43] To see that life can be more than I
[1:41:46] imagine.
[1:41:48] This is how it feels to be free.
[1:41:53] This is how it feels to be free.
[1:41:59] Oh,
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:04] hallelujah. Can we just have a time of
[1:42:06] prayer? God bless you as you bow your
[1:42:07] heads just a minute. I believe that I've
[1:42:11] I believe given a
[1:42:13] a starting place for anybody.
[1:42:17] And where we start is to look at
[1:42:19] ourselves and say, "Where is my vessel?
[1:42:20] Where is my temple?
[1:42:23] Where is it at right now?" Only you can
[1:42:24] do that and take a look at it. And
[1:42:26] something moves you this morning, I'd
[1:42:28] just take it to the Lord. I'd say,
[1:42:29] "Lord, would you help me to sanctify and
[1:42:33] clean what needs to be cleaned? Would
[1:42:36] you do that this morning?" If you want a
[1:42:39] starting place, sometimes we want to
[1:42:40] jump right to what we think revival is.
[1:42:43] But I'd say everybody raised your hand
[1:42:44] and said, "I want a personal revival."
[1:42:46] Like Josiah,
[1:42:48] I'm not waiting for the church to have
[1:42:49] revival. I want it to start in me. I
[1:42:52] want to see something more in my life. I
[1:42:54] believe the starting place is just say,
[1:42:55] "Lord, what is it that you can come and
[1:42:58] take and free me up so your glory can
[1:43:01] fill this place?" Father, may the people
[1:43:03] do that, Lord. May the people of God and
[1:43:06] maybe there's an unbeliever here this
[1:43:08] morning.
[1:43:10] May they know that you love them
[1:43:12] greatly. You went to Calvary for them,
[1:43:14] Lord. May they know, Lord, this isn't
[1:43:16] just a religion or something, Lord. This
[1:43:18] is the living Christ that wants to
[1:43:21] introduce yourself to them, Lord. And
[1:43:25] whether they're a teenager, they're an
[1:43:26] older person, doesn't matter. Oh God,
[1:43:28] you long for them to be free and that
[1:43:30] they be a temple of the Holy Ghost,
[1:43:34] dedicated holy to you. We dedicated a
[1:43:37] baby this morning to you, Lord. But God
[1:43:40] is a greater dedication. We dedicate all
[1:43:42] of ourselves, all the temples of God,
[1:43:45] all the vessels that are here. Oh God,
[1:43:48] would you take us this morning, Father?
[1:43:50] Bless and anoint each one, Lord, with
[1:43:52] thy word. take them into a a place,
[1:43:55] Lord, that such a fervor and passion for
[1:43:58] this word would begin to burn in them.
[1:44:00] That's why it says the zeal of my house
[1:44:02] has eaten me up. The zeal of thine
[1:44:04] house, it's eating us, Lord. May may you
