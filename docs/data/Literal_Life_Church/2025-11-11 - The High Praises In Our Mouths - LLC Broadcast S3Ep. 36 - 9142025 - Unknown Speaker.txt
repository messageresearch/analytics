[Music] [Applause] Joshua chapter 6 and verse 10. I'm just going to pull out. I won't read the whole chapter of course, but Joshua chapter 6 and verse 10. And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, "Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then shall ye shout." Uh, if you know your Bible, we're in the setting of the of Jericho. And, um, I'll just add in this chapter 6 and verse one. Now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel. None went out and none came in. So they had already surrounded the city. And the Lord said unto Joshua, "See, I have given into thine hand Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor." God had already said, "I have already given you Jericho." Now, shouldn't that charge the saints of God to know he's already given it to us? &gt;&gt; So if he's already given it to them, then let's go do it. Let's go do it. But now God tests the people because he's going to do the battle plan his own way, not our way, not their way, but he's going to do the battle plan. And we have to be submissive and obedient to the battle plan. And the battle plan was stranged because said he said in verse 10, he said, "You shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then shall you shout." And for six days they had to shut their mouths until God said to shout. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. And it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, shout for the Lord hath given you the city. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets. And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. I love to read about victories &gt;&gt; in the word of God. Believers are all about victories. &gt;&gt; I know the devil likes to make your life a life of defeat, but if you're a believer, it's a life of victories. Praise the Lord. Let's read in Psalms 149 if you would. Verse 6. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hand. Worship in this has seemed to reach its highest form. And when worship has reached is how many know that worship is not just singing in church but it's our life. And worship reaches its highest form. I believe in this Psalms 149 because it speaks of a people. In fact, I would say that it's prophetic because it speaks of a people with a sword in their hand and the high praises of God upon their lips. And this high praises is the only place it's mentioned in scripture, the high praises of God. And that grabbed my attention because it's if it's mentioned in one place, then we realize it must have some meaning to it. Praise is mentioned many places, but this was a people with the high praises of God upon their lips. And it is also a people that have the sword in their hand. And all of us believers should be familiar with that because we are the people that have received the sword back into our hand. It struck the prophet's hand and it also has struck the hand of the people that we have the word. The sword put blank put back in our hands. But it's not just that we have the word. It's not just that we have the restored word, but we have the high praises of God upon our lips and or or I should say we should have the high praises of God upon our lips. So when I looked up this high praises uh we realized that the first meaning of it it means to be very exuberant. It means be to be very joyful. It means to be very excited. It means to be constantly bragging on God. praising God, not only in church, but you're always praising God. You're always bragging on the Lord. You're always telling about the good things that he's done, and you're you're not afraid to talk about it to somebody in the store or your boss or anybody else. If you get the opportunity, it's an exuberant excitement to praise and put on these lips, glory to Almighty God. That's the high praises of God. And it isn't just on Sunday. It isn't just every year at the camp meeting, but it should be every day of our lives. What comes out of our mouth is thanksgiving and praise for what the Lord has done. It is not lukewarm praise or passive praise. It's not laidback, well, I'm too tired to do it, but it actually the high praises of God. It actually embodies itself in a body so much that you see the expressions of clapping your hands and shouting and rejoicing and saying amen. But I'm a shy person. But this high praise kind of overrides that shyness and says I'm feeling this. I'm there's tears coming down my life. God God has redeemed me. God has saved me. Can you say amen? God has done something for me. Can you say amen? Praise the Lord. Uh I I I was looking at the slides coming across and there's one slide there from one of the preachers that says, "Soon as a man is cleansed from sin, he is clothed with praise." Soon as a man is cleansed from sin and he's really been cleansed, he becomes clothed with high praises. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's not lazy. I believe it's not something that's lukewarm or it's when you feel like it. I believe it's something that becomes high praises and it is unashamed. It is an unashamed expression in your song, in your hands, in your body. It may even make you dance every once in a while. And I'll tell you, if it made David dance before Calvary, and it made David's cup overflowing, overwhelmed before Calvary, now after Calvary, it our cup should be running over. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our cup should be not not just full but running over. I thought about that the other day. I thought, you know what, in our lives, do we live a life I've got a cup, a coffee cup that says, "My cup runth over." I use it every morning, but I was looking at the other day, how many believers can say like David before Calvary, he was already saved, my cup is running over. I'll tell you friends, God has done mighty things. And this unashamed expression should be in your song. It should be in your hands. It should be in your body. Sometimes even affects our feet. It lets it all out for the Lord and has no fear to bring a vocal celebration upon its lips. &gt;&gt; And that all happens because something is causing it's not because I'm uh forcing it this morning or I'm working it up. That happens because the revelation of Christ has struck your heart. And when revelation strikes your heart, stimulation is on its way. But then I was drawn to the other meaning of high praise. And that's beyond just church. Uh uh while music is often part of high praise, and it is music is a part of it. Worship is a part of it. Our expression at church and at home in music. While music is often a part of high praise, it's not limited to it. In other words, it's not limited to being in church. High praises of God on your lips is not limited to being in church. If this is the only time you sing is in church, uh, shame on you. Our high praises belong to him wherever we're at, whenever we feel to give praises to God. If this is the only time you read your Bible, then shame on you this morning. Because this is not a Sunday morning religion. This is every day that we bring the high praises to God. If this is the only place you ever sing a song, you say, "Brother Paul, I don't have a gift to sing." God never made qualifications. You know what the qualification is to bring praise? That's if you're breathing. &gt;&gt; Let everything that hath breath. &gt;&gt; Check your neighbor breathe on them. Wait, wait a minute. Don't do that. Check check your pulse. If you're breathing, you have no excuse. That is the only qualification that makes you a worshipper. Let everything that have breath praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just a little different. You know, I'm just a little different. Yeah, you are different. Get the high praises of God on your lips. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the writer says here, high praise can be expressed through various forms of worship and even in daily life through actions of obedience and love. So it's the high praises of God is not just something upon our lips as far as songs and worship, but it's our life. It's our daily life. It's our actions of obedience and love. Do you know we worship when we're obedient to the word of God? Do you know we worship it and express our spel back to him by what we what we say every day and not just what we say at church? Do you know that our obedience and our love for God and for other people expresses worship? So it raises the level of our worship not just in church but every day. It raises the quality. Here we go now. And I told you to put your seat belt on. It raises the quality when you say high praises. It raises the quality of what's coming out of your mouth every &gt;&gt; day. Amen. Because if you're a a morbid complainer, you heard a morbid obesity, morbid complainer, then you haven't found the high praises of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you think this is just uh this high praises is just singing in church or shouting or speaking in tongues, no. high praises on our mouth means letting our mouth be used of God for the right things. &gt;&gt; And shutting them from saying the wrong things. &gt;&gt; I'm here to make it clear. The high praises of God is letting your mouth be used of the Lord to speak the right things, to speak edification, to speak things that build up instead of tear down, to speak. It raises the quality of what's coming out of your mouth every day and it shuts its mouth from all the rest of it. While I was ministering on the sword and the hand and the pie praise on the tongue, I mentioned some places where the worship was not striking it just right with God. I went from from Cain worship all the way through and mentioned some places where the people were worshiping. They were sincere. Sometimes they were very sincere. uh sometimes uh uh that they weren't sincere, but there were elements missing in the worship. And when the elements were missing in in Cain, he was missing blood. He was missing a revelation. He was missing sacrifice. And we think that we're oh, it's worship. It's sincere. It's to God. So we God just accepts it. Not always because God would like to strike just the right type of worshippers, especially at the end time who worship him in spirit and in truth. Jesus said to the woman at the well, "There'll come a day, there's an hour coming when the true worshippers will worship him in spirit and in truth." It won't be missing the spirit and it won't be missing the word. At the end time, they'll have it both together. And I want to be one of those true worshippers. Can you say amen? If you want to know who I am, I'm not Paula Fontaine that has a gift to sing. I'm not Paula Fontaine has a gift to preach. You know who I am? I'm one of those true worshippers at the end time. And whether I could sing or preach, I want to be one of those true worshippers. &gt;&gt; I want you to see it in my life. I don't want you to see it at church. I want my grandchildren to see what I'm excited about in life. And it's not about things. It's about bringing worship in my life to this God. That's what I want them to see. I'm not all these other things. I'm a true worshipper of God. How many want to be a true worshshiper of God? &gt;&gt; Half of you. Well, praise the Lord. Maybe we can keep preaching and you desire to be what Jesus said. I want to be one of those true worshippers that he prophesied about &gt;&gt; to worship him in spirit and truth. So sometimes the worship didn't strike right to just bring pleasure to God because there were elements missing. But then I mentioned a a couple times where it struck just right. I brought up the temple and somehow all the elements were there and it struck just right to bring pleasure to God. And you know what happened? All the instruments were in order. All the worshippers were in order. All the dedication, the consecration, everything was in perfectly in order. And there was such a heart in the people just to step back and just worship their God. And it struck just the right thing to the glory filled the temple and the preacher couldn't even preach. It struck just the right worship. But I didn't get to Jericho because in Jericho something struck just right. Because this this city that God had given him was walled with walls that were so thick that they could have chariot races around it. That's a pretty thick wall. And it was impossible to overcome something like this. And the power in this army on the seventh day when they shouted on the seventh day when they shouted the walls shook and the walls crumbled and they walked right in and took the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the mystery of the power was not just in the shout. The mystery of power is not just in noise. I know that's pushed a lot in some of our ranks, but you're if you're pushing just noise and you're working it up and you're working up the shout, missing the other elements, &gt;&gt; then you're missing the mystery &gt;&gt; of what the third pole will do. I mean that very respectfully. But listen, don't miss the scriptural patterns. Because for six days, there was six days of absolute silence. Something happened where God was pleased and the right thing came together. The right shout came together. Catch this now. The re the ratio is six days of silence to one moment of shouting. Silence makes people nervous that they got to we got to say something. You ever have somebody that in a conversation in the you have the what is it the 30 secondond law the law in the conversation and somebody's just got to say something and then they usually say something stupid because they can't handle the silence. Somebody's telling me about someone a few weeks ago. It's like they just got to say something, you know, well, we should do this, we should do that. just, you know, it's okay if nobody has something to say. It's okay if nobody has something to say. &gt;&gt; But you've been in that kind and they just blurt something out. And sometimes, you know, it doesn't even have time. They just think it and it quickly goes and spills right out their mouth. They didn't let their heart ponder it. They didn't use any discernment of the Holy Ghost. They thought it and it spilled right out and they said it. I can't believe you just said that. &gt;&gt; Six days. The ratio is six days of silence to one moment of shouting. It sure seems like some groups got a real imbalance in the ratios, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The ratio is way the other way. And actually eliminating the obedience in being silent silent for six days. That's not even in the scenario. And to believe that the victory came only because of the shout to believe that the victory came only because of the shout is not sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; The obedience of seven days of God's people to follow God's orders, that's what gave power for the shout. [Applause] The silence for the first six days was a test of faith and obedience. Maybe this is why God did it because he had already given him the city. Most of us would be saying, "Glory be to God. Let's have a shout. Let the horns blast. Let the rams horns blast. Let's get the ark going. Let's go get it." Maybe he was testing their obedience. No, we're not going to get it for seven days and for six days in your tents and everywhere. Everybody does not utter one word. &gt;&gt; You know, listen friends, I don't know how that was accomplished. I do not know how it happened. If they were human beings like you are and I am. I do not know except for this incredible respect for Joshua, who's the type of the Holy Ghost, and respect for God and respect for his strategy for victory. And enough people saying if that's what God said that's the strategy for battle and victory that's what we're doing. And for six days I don't know how they did it. They were human beings. &gt;&gt; Human beings can't shut their mouth. They give themselves permission to say whatever they want to say whenever they want to say it. Human beings are like little twoyear-olds who say whatever they want to say whenever they want to say it. But if we're going into adoption, we're saying, "Lord, get control of this tongue." &gt;&gt; That only edification would come out of it. &gt;&gt; And not just in church, but on an everyday basis. It was a test ensuring that the people did not voice any doubts about the effectiveness of God's strategy. That's what one Christian writer said. That's not my own words, but I like it. He was God was ensuring that the people did not voice any doubts about the effectiveness of God's strategy. No unbelief, no doubts, no question. Why? Why do we have to do it that way? Well, that's the craziest things. God always gives God's already given us the the city. Uh you know, uh what's the test? The test is whether we can hold our tongue from complaining and giving our own opinion to God's orders. Why can't we take the city now, Joshua? God said Jericho is is ours. Let's go. Why am I holding this trumpet and I can't use it? You better use your trumpet when God says to use it. &gt;&gt; And you better use it for God. &gt;&gt; And you better use it in harmony with the Holy Ghost anointing. You better use your gift in the will in the channel of the word of God or it'll get out of the word of God and you think it's worship and beneficial. But you better keep your gift in the channel of holiness, in the channel of God, and the way he wants to use your gift. Can't get enough amens this morning. I believe this is the truth. Come on, Joshua. Let's go take it. You know, Joshua, I think it's the devil on the preachers holding the people back from shouting. &gt;&gt; It's the devil speaking in your ear, saying not to get up and shout right now. Don't quench the spirit, Joshua. Now's the time to shout. No, it's not time right now. It's time to wait till God brings us in a certain place. And you never have to legislate the shout. God will say, "Now let out a shout and the walls of Jericho will come down." The shout of the people brought the walls of Jericho down. We're going to raise the roof off this place. We're going to shout the walls of Jericho down. Well, I wonder if there's really any power there or if any walls are really coming down &gt;&gt; in people's lives. And I wonder how many gossips are in that group. How many complainers are amongst the heavy shoutters? How many proud people? How many boasters are in the same crowd of shoutters? I'm not against it. I've been amongst them. I've danced. You've seen me dance, worship the Lord. But if you're only emphasizing the shout and say that's the power. I wonder sometimes if there's not really walls of Jericho coming down in people's lives and it's got gossip and complainers and proud and boasters. They can't control their tongue from the corruption and things they talk about all week for six days. But oh on Sunday they sure shouted, "But what came out of your mouth the rest of the week?" God's calling for the high praises to be in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Another level of praise, another level of communication. John Wesley is widely cited for his sermon the cure of evil speaking in which he defines the sin of evil speaking. It's a sin and offers a method for dealing with it. The most famous antidote, however, comes from a conversation where he responded to a woman boasting about her talent for speaking her mind. The famous antidote, a woman approached Wesley and stated she prided herself on speaking her mind, calling it her talent. And Wesley's famous reply was, "Well, ma'am, the Lord wouldn't mind if you buried that talent." Let's move to the next messenger, Martin Luther said this after John Wesley. Martin Luther said, "It is common pocious plague. It is a common penious plague that everyone would rather hear evil than good about their neighbors. Even though we ourselves are evil, we cannot tolerate it when anyone speaks evil of us. Instead, we want to hear the whole world say golden things of us. Yet we cannot bear it when someone says the best things about others. Those who are not content just to know but rush ahead and judge are called backbiters. Learning a bit of gossip about someone else, they spread it into every corner, relishing and delighting in the chance to stir up someone else's dirt like pigs that roll in the manure and root around in it with their snouts. &gt;&gt; Now, you think I'm a hard preacher. Maybe you should have lived in the days of Luther. &gt;&gt; And he'll tell you what your gossip is. He'll tell you the stuff that comes out of your mouth and tell you that it's evil speaking. Paul called it in the Bible corrupt communication. &gt;&gt; Negative communication. &gt;&gt; It's not edifiing. It's not building up. &gt;&gt; It's corrupt things coming out of your mouth. I'm going to issue a challenge as I close this service because I don't like the fact that we, you know, just come and hear a sermon. And I know the Holy Spirit has to do his work. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to challenge this congregation. A whole month of not one negative thing coming out of our mouth. I'm challenging because I think this is going to change more than what you realize. &gt;&gt; I think this is going to create atmospheres that you've never dreamed you'd see in domestic life, in family life, in whatever it is. It's going to change it. Your negative hasn't changed things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; You're still the same. In some ways, you're still the same way you were. So, your negative confession hasn't changed, but you watch the power on your tongue of life &gt;&gt; and you watch it change things. &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
