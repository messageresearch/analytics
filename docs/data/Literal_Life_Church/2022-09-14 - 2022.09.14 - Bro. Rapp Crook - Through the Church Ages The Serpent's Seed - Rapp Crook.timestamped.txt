[0:00] Lord willing tonight we're going to take
[0:02] a look at um the Bible's teaching on the
[0:06] serpent seed and to be honest is one of
[0:08] the tougher uh sessions for me to study
[0:12] for just because I can remember a couple
[0:14] of services growing up in the past
[0:15] couple years as I've heard from Brother
[0:17] Stephen strew and brother Jason demarius
[0:19] they just kind of hit the ball out of
[0:21] the ballpark
[0:22] um explaining and showing it from the
[0:24] scripture so I thought my I wish I could
[0:26] just kind of stream their service this
[0:28] evening but um
[0:31] we're not going to do that this evening
[0:32] we'll just see how the Lord will bring
[0:33] it this way but um my uh my goal tonight
[0:38] is just to kind of hopefully by God's
[0:40] grace to show that what we believe what
[0:42] brother Brandman has brought and
[0:43] restored to us it's a it's a Biblical
[0:45] teaching we've got a strong Foundation
[0:47] to stand upon and um and it's hard to
[0:51] see it in another way I just pray that
[0:53] God will open our eyes to to see that
[0:56] and and just bless uh bless my word as I
[0:58] try to explain it
[1:00] we'll take a look at Acts chapter 2 and
[1:02] verses 42 to 44.
[1:05] it says and they continued steadfastly
[1:07] in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship
[1:09] and in Breaking of bread and in prayers
[1:12] and fear Came Upon every soul and Many
[1:15] Wonders and signs were done by the
[1:17] apostles and all that believed were
[1:19] together and had all things in common I
[1:22] just love how that said now brother Paul
[1:24] brought it out that
[1:26] um all the noses are pointing in the
[1:27] same direction they had the same vision
[1:29] they weren't worried of anything else
[1:31] they didn't have misdemean today we are
[1:33] so attempted by materialistic values we
[1:36] want the biggest house the biggest car
[1:38] the biggest sister that they didn't care
[1:40] because they had a really Clear Vision
[1:42] this world's not my home I'm investing
[1:45] in the future that's out of this world
[1:47] and that they had that
[1:49] and the over and that acts uh
[1:51] um I think this must be at one of these
[1:53] scriptures wrong this would be Acts 2 I
[1:55] think
[1:56] um but in the multitude of them that
[1:58] believed were of one heart and of one
[2:01] Soul neither I said any of them that odd
[2:03] of the things which he possessed was his
[2:05] own nothing that I have is mine it's all
[2:08] given to me of God so if God wants to do
[2:09] something else with it it's God's
[2:11] priorities that's fine they had all
[2:13] things in common and notice God was with
[2:15] them he Vindicated them with great power
[2:18] he gave the apostles witness of the
[2:20] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great
[2:23] grave is upon them all this what
[2:24] wonderful signs that God is with them
[2:27] and you maybe see that we'll just ask
[2:29] the Lord the Lord's blessing here
[2:31] Heavenly Father we just pray that you
[2:33] would put a watch over my mouth I might
[2:34] say what's true and right and may we all
[2:36] be established in your truth tonight in
[2:38] Jesus name amen
[2:41] so the question I want to kind of start
[2:42] with we see so clearly that the church
[2:45] at Pentecost was established on a strong
[2:48] Foundation God was with them I mean they
[2:52] had all
[2:53] they had all things in common they were
[2:56] of one heart one Soul it says in Acts do
[2:59] they continue the apostles Doctrine they
[3:01] were in fellowshipping with one another
[3:02] it's also good
[3:05] but if we look in the Red Book of
[3:08] Revelation chapters 2 and 3 when John is
[3:11] prophetically describing the church that
[3:14] it's to come and the church ages you see
[3:17] something very very different
[3:19] and you got to wonder
[3:21] why because if the if the seed is
[3:23] planted perfectly in the book of Acts
[3:27] and it's showing such beautiful perfect
[3:29] fruit that's just like the seed that
[3:31] went in the ground just like Christ
[3:34] how did all these other attributes come
[3:37] to get involved that's not that wasn't
[3:40] part of the seed that was planted how
[3:41] did it get involved and we can kind of
[3:43] take a look at some of the
[3:44] characteristics in the Ephesian Church
[3:46] age
[3:47] um Jesus Christ recommend commends the
[3:50] church because they cannot bear them
[3:52] which are evil who say their Apostles
[3:54] and are not these are folks who
[3:57] Christ is calling evil but they're
[3:59] calling themselves part of the church
[4:01] and this just continues to grow and he
[4:03] says there's this group here that hates
[4:06] the Deeds of Nicolaitans here's a group
[4:08] that says they're part of the true
[4:10] church but that's showing a very
[4:12] different fruit than the seed that was
[4:15] planted yet they're identifying
[4:16] themselves as the true church how can
[4:18] this be and it just goes from bad to
[4:20] worse in Smyrna there's a group that
[4:22] says they're Jews which in the early
[4:24] church if you were a Jewish believer
[4:26] that you had special Insight perhaps
[4:27] into the Old Testament because you that
[4:30] that's what you grew up with he says
[4:32] they're not they're of the synagogue of
[4:34] Satan they don't they're they're they
[4:36] try to be with us but they're definitely
[4:37] not of us then finally in Smyrna I think
[4:40] it is they says there are those that
[4:42] among you that are not following in the
[4:44] apostles Doctrine as an Acts 2 or acts 4
[4:47] but they're actually holding the
[4:48] doctrine of Balaam and we know in the
[4:51] Old Testament in the audience then would
[4:53] have known in the Old Testament the
[4:54] doctrine of Balaam brought nothing good
[4:57] forth how does this church that was
[5:00] planted and show such good fruit right
[5:02] at the beginning how is something so
[5:05] different coming up and it just
[5:07] continues in in the I think pergamus
[5:09] there's this woman Jezebel who's that
[5:12] the church is all suffering or is
[5:13] allowing to teach and further seduce my
[5:18] servants to commit fornication how can
[5:20] this be and it just continues on in in
[5:23] Sardis it says you have a few names who
[5:26] have not defiled their garments which
[5:28] means that defiled garments is the rule
[5:31] and the exceptionists they haven't
[5:33] defiled their garments how can this be
[5:35] because in the in Acts this was a church
[5:38] that was that was that was that was
[5:41] almost perfect it is beautiful
[5:45] yet in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul writes
[5:47] there is going to be a bride
[5:49] who is his garments are washed pure and
[5:52] white by the water of the word that that
[5:54] will be there but you see how you have
[5:56] both characteristics all intertwined and
[6:00] mixed throughout the church ages that's
[6:02] what we're seeing here
[6:03] and again uh
[6:05] um even in the Philadelphia nature is
[6:08] going to be them who who are of the
[6:10] synagogue of Satan that are they say
[6:12] they're part of the church but Christ
[6:14] says I'm going to make sure that these
[6:15] folks who are of the synagogue State and
[6:17] they are going to know who the real
[6:19] church is they're going to know that I
[6:20] loved you there'll be a Vindication of
[6:23] that little bride that's what's being
[6:24] referred to there and then finally
[6:26] and now this year there's this group
[6:28] that's lukewarm that says they're the
[6:30] church that says they're the bride of
[6:32] Christ
[6:33] yet he says I'm going to spew them out
[6:36] of my mouth
[6:37] so the way I show all this is how did
[6:40] this happen how can a church that began
[6:42] so well end so poorly how did it all go
[6:46] wrong because we could look at the
[6:48] fruits of this of this church and it's
[6:50] very very mixed
[6:52] and to understand the problem with the
[6:54] fruit we want to take a look and see
[6:56] where the what is the problem with the
[6:58] seed because it's very clear there's a
[7:00] problem with the fruit in the church
[7:01] here somewhere where did this come from
[7:04] and unfortunately the devil has worked
[7:08] very hard to hinder a clear
[7:11] understanding of the Fall
[7:14] the Fallen Eden and the fall also in the
[7:17] early church he's worked very hard to
[7:18] hinder this
[7:20] and a few years ago I was teaching an
[7:23] elementary Bible class and we were going
[7:25] through the Book of Genesis that would
[7:26] be a good idea to start in the Old
[7:27] Testament just go through Genesis and
[7:29] take him up probably to the Book of
[7:31] Exodus and with the days of creation
[7:34] that was all nice and then before I knew
[7:36] I was going to teach the fall I thought
[7:37] man how am I going to teach the story of
[7:40] the Fall to these little to these little
[7:41] little first and secondly six seven and
[7:43] eight-year-olds and that class I gained
[7:46] a great appreciation for the symbolism
[7:48] used in the Bible because you know what
[7:49] those little Sunday school books they
[7:51] meet the kids on that level and the kids
[7:54] can get everything they need to know at
[7:55] that age from the story about Eve eating
[7:58] a forbidden fruit and there being
[8:00] punishment for it that's great at that
[8:02] age
[8:04] but you know what the devil wants
[8:06] everybody to stay with that
[8:07] understanding
[8:09] but as we grow older there's a there's a
[8:12] lot more in that story it's a it's an
[8:14] allegory we'll look at it tonight packed
[8:17] full with meaning
[8:18] and as you start pulling back layers of
[8:21] the meaning the story becomes much more
[8:23] meaningful to us as we get older
[8:26] and as we grow up we can let scripture
[8:29] we'll do that tonight let scripture
[8:31] interpret scripture
[8:32] and we'll see that there's a lot more
[8:33] going on in this and why is the devil
[8:36] hindered an understanding of the Fall so
[8:39] clearly
[8:40] as we come out of this this Bible story
[8:42] in Genesis that you tell the little six
[8:44] seven eight-year-olds it's very clear
[8:46] you get to Genesis 3 15. there's a
[8:49] punishment and there's there's a promise
[8:52] and you can tell the kids Jesus that
[8:54] that God is promising adds me that
[8:57] there's going to come
[8:58] an offspring later the seat of the woman
[9:01] is going to bruise the Serpent's head
[9:02] and he's going to bruise Satan there on
[9:05] the cross and Christ is going to be the
[9:06] Victor he's going to be our our champion
[9:08] he's the hero of the story and that's
[9:11] true so the in this little Sunday school
[9:13] version the hero is very clear
[9:15] but the villain kind of remains foggy
[9:19] and I would say it's the to the villains
[9:21] benefit that his identity and the way
[9:24] that he works kind of remains foggy he's
[9:27] happy everybody that's given the idea of
[9:29] the story general idea but not too many
[9:30] of the specifics because if you get the
[9:32] specifics you'll see how he works in our
[9:35] lives how he's worked every single
[9:37] Church age and how he's working today
[9:41] he just want us to see that he wants to
[9:42] keep our understanding basic so when we
[9:46] peel back the the meaning here and look
[9:48] at this scene more clearly the seed
[9:50] story more clearly we'll also see how
[9:53] terrible sin is
[9:57] it's not just an arbitrary eating of
[9:59] just some apple that you were told not
[10:02] to touch and then everything goes
[10:03] downhill from there
[10:05] let me talk about the the sin that we'll
[10:08] talk about tonight that affects every
[10:10] area of your life affects every
[10:12] relationship that's involved it poisons
[10:14] everything
[10:16] and Satan doesn't want you to look at
[10:18] sin that way Satan one looks you said
[10:20] why does God say you can't do that what
[10:23] a ridiculous rule come on
[10:25] but when you can see what's being talked
[10:27] about wow sin is serious
[10:30] but Satan I want you to see sin is
[10:32] serious sin looks like why is god making
[10:34] a rule about that
[10:37] um and you'll also see we see what the
[10:39] sin was how it affected everything
[10:42] what the graciousness of God the love of
[10:45] God nothing could keep him from coming
[10:48] down on the scene rolling up his arms
[10:50] and trying to deal with this problem and
[10:53] to and work in redeeming love for his
[10:55] children so when we see what the sin was
[10:59] what we see who the villain was what the
[11:01] deed was we gained such an appreciation
[11:04] for how terrible sin is how terrible our
[11:07] enemy is and how great our God is
[11:10] so we'll just start off with the uh the
[11:12] uh the question if you look in your
[11:13] Sunday school books and things Ebates
[11:15] and apple or some other fruit but that
[11:17] begs the question what's wrong with
[11:20] eating an apple what's wrong with that
[11:24] um and you could if you just take the
[11:26] story of the fall at face value
[11:28] it seems like God sets up an arbitrary
[11:30] rule that there's all these fruit trees
[11:33] in the garden you guys can eat all of
[11:36] them that you want except that apple
[11:38] tree back there don't touch that
[11:41] and I just kind of thinking about it
[11:43] it'd be like me setting out 10 cookies
[11:46] on the counter
[11:48] okay Sophie you can have all nine of
[11:51] these cookies but don't dare touch this
[11:53] 10th cookie it's like
[11:54] why am I doing that I mean there's
[11:57] what's the point of the Rolex of just
[12:00] this is just a test of this kid's
[12:01] obedience but would we do that as
[12:04] parents if we're going to make a rule
[12:06] there's going to be a purpose for it
[12:08] it's not just to have a gotcha moment I
[12:10] knew you were going to do that so whack
[12:12] and here you've got this arbitrary Rule
[12:14] and the most Draconian of punishments I
[12:18] mean it's not like you eat that cookie
[12:20] and you're going to be in the corner for
[12:21] 10 minutes no you eat the cookie I'm
[12:23] going to kick out of my house I mean
[12:25] it's just that doesn't make sense I mean
[12:28] what kind of parent would do that you
[12:30] wouldn't
[12:32] and God wouldn't either
[12:34] there's more going on here than just
[12:36] eating
[12:37] this this particular fruit
[12:40] so the Bible doesn't show God's
[12:42] character to be this way so I'd suggest
[12:45] there's more to the story than that and
[12:46] Jesus indicates that it's not eating
[12:50] that causes someone to be unclean the
[12:52] disciples were given this question by
[12:54] the Pharisees the Pharisees say your
[12:56] disciples eat with unwashing hands oh
[12:59] that's bad
[13:00] but Jesus says here understand it's not
[13:03] that which goes into the mouth that
[13:04] defiles a man but that which comes out
[13:07] that defiles a man and this this teach
[13:10] this this truth here in Matthew kind of
[13:12] pulls the rug under from the Sunday
[13:14] School interpretation it's not just this
[13:16] eating of something that that that's
[13:17] defiling but it's that which comes out
[13:20] of the mouth
[13:22] that comes from the heart
[13:24] that's able to defile
[13:26] a man and so we're going to take a look
[13:30] perhaps in the Genesis chapter two it's
[13:32] on page two in our notes
[13:34] um
[13:34] here
[13:36] um God is uh it's described out of this
[13:39] is Genesis 2 verse 9. out of the ground
[13:41] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[13:43] that's Pleasant to the site and good for
[13:45] food
[13:46] and I just want to point out there's a
[13:48] semicolon there every tree that's good
[13:51] for food that's Pleasant to the site
[13:53] they're all growing out of the ground
[13:55] here they are
[13:57] and then the tree of life was also in
[13:59] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[14:01] the knowledge of Good and Evil
[14:02] so it's this setup as being two
[14:05] different categories of two different
[14:07] categories of trees
[14:09] and then the Lord commanded the man in
[14:12] verse 16 of every tree of the garden you
[14:15] may freely eat but of the tree of the
[14:17] knowledge of Good and Evil you won't eat
[14:19] everything you shouldn't eat of that one
[14:20] for the day you eat thereof you will
[14:22] surely die again this is a different
[14:23] kind of fruit also because it's
[14:27] a little banana peaches are going to
[14:29] have that effect this is a different
[14:30] kind of fruit it's mentioned in a
[14:32] different category it's it's different
[14:34] than the one that is naturally Pleasant
[14:36] to the site and good for food now the
[14:38] fruit from this tree of knowledge of
[14:39] Good and Evil you can learn that it's
[14:41] Pleasant to the eye you can learn that's
[14:43] plus the site you can learn that it's
[14:45] good for food but that's not what you
[14:47] grow up seeing right away it's not
[14:49] naturally that way you you you learn
[14:51] that
[14:52] and there's we'll take a look at some of
[14:54] the symbolism that's used in the story
[14:56] we have trees there's Gardens the fruit
[15:00] even the very active eating all of these
[15:03] can be used metaphorically it means they
[15:05] have a double meaning
[15:07] well first off take a look at trees
[15:10] in the Bible trees can speak of persons
[15:13] it's not just going to be speaking of
[15:16] um
[15:16] a bark covered uh living organism with
[15:20] leaves that practice photosynthesis and
[15:23] bears fruits and things like that it can
[15:25] be more than that but first let's just
[15:27] take a look in Revelation 2 7 it's here
[15:29] on the screen if we were to say that the
[15:32] tree of life is a literal tree in the
[15:34] Garden of Eden the tree of knowledge
[15:36] would be a literal tree in the Garden of
[15:37] Eden the way it's referred to in
[15:39] Revelation 2 7 is interesting because it
[15:41] says
[15:42] he the hath and you let them hear what
[15:44] the spirit says to the churches to him
[15:45] who overcomes will I give to eat of the
[15:47] Tree of Life
[15:49] if it were a literal tree we would
[15:50] expect to be able to find it somewhere
[15:52] there in the middle of East there in the
[15:54] Middle East where it was planted in the
[15:57] Garden of Eden if it were a literal tree
[15:58] we would expect to find it there
[16:01] but it's not there it's in the midst of
[16:03] the paradise of God so this tree of life
[16:06] is something more than that and there
[16:11] are lots of symbolisms uh there are
[16:13] multiple references to um to Christ
[16:15] being the source of Life what is the
[16:17] what is the Tree of Life
[16:19] and it's interesting there's a people
[16:21] all want to people throughout history if
[16:23] one defined the uh
[16:25] um the uh the the the elixir of life or
[16:28] this this tree of life or this this this
[16:30] this well we have this this water that
[16:33] would make them forever uh forever
[16:35] healthy but it's not here on Earth it's
[16:37] not a literal thing it's something that
[16:38] the soul desire is for there's only one
[16:41] source of that and Jesus says if you
[16:43] don't come to me
[16:45] you won't have life you won't you should
[16:46] you should come to me to have life
[16:49] she says I'm the bread of life
[16:51] I'm the way the truth the life
[16:55] first John this is the record that God
[16:58] God has given us eternal life and this
[17:00] life is in his son so where can we find
[17:04] eternal life where can we find life it's
[17:06] in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is that
[17:10] tree of life
[17:13] and other other examples in the Bible
[17:16] where trees can symbolize persons and
[17:19] Psalm 1 blessed is the man who walketh
[17:21] not in the Council of the ungodly or
[17:23] stands in the way of Sinners nor sits in
[17:25] the seat of the scornful but um he'll be
[17:28] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[17:30] water now does that mean that because
[17:32] Brother Paul's walking with the Lord so
[17:34] well we only have for a few years longer
[17:36] and he'll be putting down some roots and
[17:37] stretching forth branches it doesn't
[17:39] mean that but there's a continuousness
[17:42] to a a fruitfulness this is this is a
[17:46] comparison
[17:47] and Daniel chapter 4 and Nebuchadnezzar
[17:49] has a dream and he's grown so mighty in
[17:52] this he's been he's this great tree and
[17:54] this tree and the dream symbolizes
[17:56] Nebuchadnezzar
[17:58] he's not literally a tree but this is a
[18:00] tree can stand for a person
[18:02] in Judges chapter nine Gideon's son
[18:05] abimelech is having a a big discussion
[18:10] um with the men of shechem and he starts
[18:12] giving him what for and he tells them
[18:14] this whole Parable where this Bramble
[18:16] Bush came and beat up these uh these
[18:18] these olive trees because the olive
[18:20] trees weren't doing what they were
[18:22] supposed to be doing and every all the
[18:23] trees are meant to are symbolizing
[18:26] actual characters they're in the story
[18:29] um in Matthew chapter 3 the religious
[18:31] leaders are very proud that we are sons
[18:34] of Abraham they said to John the Baptist
[18:35] why do we need to repent and um John the
[18:39] Baptist says I've come to lay the ACT to
[18:40] the root of all the trees so this is
[18:42] they're looking a family tree right this
[18:45] is they say we're you're justification
[18:48] your spiritual standing is not a matter
[18:50] of your family tree I'm coming to lay
[18:52] the root to all of them so you can have
[18:54] a born-again experience and be born from
[18:56] above that's what John the Baptist is
[18:57] teaching
[18:58] so the Tree of Life brother Branham says
[19:01] just like the Bible points out the tree
[19:02] of life is a person so he says the tree
[19:05] of knowledge of Good and Evil is a
[19:07] person also it can be otherwise it's
[19:08] consistent
[19:09] thus the righteous one and the wicked
[19:12] one he says stood side by side there in
[19:14] the midst of the Garden of Eden he
[19:16] quotes from Ezekiel 28 13 thou Satan has
[19:20] been in Eden the Garden of God
[19:22] so there in the they're in the Garden of
[19:24] Eden Christ is there
[19:26] and Satan is there also and they have a
[19:29] choice Adam and Eve have a choice what
[19:32] will they um what will they be doing
[19:34] and there's a uh there's a there's some
[19:37] copies of attract by Brother Jason
[19:39] demarris
[19:40] um on the on the mystery of the seat of
[19:41] the serpent revealed it's back on the
[19:43] back on the table by the tithe and
[19:45] offering envelopes but he also points
[19:47] out how and uh in each in each one one
[19:50] of us
[19:51] we can look at ourselves the a garden it
[19:55] can be some a bride is often symbolized
[19:57] as a garden in the scripture look at the
[19:59] Song of Solomon I've got scriptures here
[20:01] for that it says let my beloved come
[20:03] into his garden and eat his Pleasant
[20:05] fruit It's a Wonderful metaphor but he's
[20:08] not talking about eating an apple or
[20:09] eating a pear
[20:11] um
[20:12] so this this this metaphor of a of a
[20:14] garden that's speaking of the bride's
[20:17] body
[20:18] um her body can also be depicted as as
[20:20] Choice fruits and then these sexual
[20:22] relations that are beautifully described
[20:25] in the Song of Solomon that's carried
[20:27] with a metaphor of of eating and um say
[20:31] uh you've got my beloveds and he is my
[20:34] beloved is mine he feeds among the
[20:36] lilies he's not having a barbecue Down
[20:38] by the Riverside this is a much more
[20:40] romantic a much more romantic thing and
[20:44] um so in gardens fruit the act of eating
[20:47] they're all used as metaphors for sexual
[20:49] relations in proverbs 30 20 it says it
[20:52] really clearly this is the way of an
[20:54] adulterous woman she eats she wipes her
[20:58] mouth and says I've done no wickedness
[21:01] it's clear here they're using this
[21:03] eating metaphor it's clearly interpreted
[21:05] clearly accepted that we can use the
[21:07] Bible to interpret the Bible there's an
[21:10] active eating that takes place here in
[21:12] the Book of Genesis and this is a
[21:16] different sort of tree
[21:17] it's a different sort of fruit
[21:20] and what follows from it
[21:23] it's very lead us to believe that yeah
[21:26] something else happened my dad just
[21:28] telling me on the way up today he was at
[21:30] the soup kitchen and some lady comes in
[21:32] and said and this is a non-believer she
[21:34] just comes in and asks so what do you
[21:36] think happened there in the Garden of
[21:37] Eden why is it talking about the serpent
[21:39] having a seed and does this all come
[21:41] from an apple
[21:42] and dad says well how do children come
[21:44] about today
[21:46] and it doesn't it's common sense you
[21:48] almost would think but if if you if you
[21:50] have the the the layers of kind of
[21:52] religiosity that are in and tradition
[21:54] peeled off then you can see it and and
[21:57] it's there
[21:59] Psalm 128 verse 3 talks about your wife
[22:02] can be like a fruitful Vine they talk
[22:05] about a wife could be like it like like
[22:06] a tree the symbolism is there
[22:09] and
[22:10] what and this is a tree of knowledge of
[22:13] Good and Evil and you can think about
[22:15] sexual relations as they're described in
[22:16] the Song of Solomon it's beautiful
[22:19] he has lyric poetry says oh it's
[22:22] described as a beautiful thing and
[22:25] sexual relations and a good marriage are
[22:28] a beautiful thing
[22:29] but what can be so intensely joyous and
[22:33] just as much intensely tragic
[22:35] as sexual relations
[22:37] take a look at the take a look at the
[22:39] story of and I believe I'm preaching
[22:41] from
[22:42] and when they're they're when amnon goes
[22:45] and rapes Tamar it's a terrible thing a
[22:48] terrible thing
[22:50] and you don't have to look very far
[22:51] nowadays folks just take a look what's
[22:53] going on in children's services today
[22:55] and opioid epidemic with all kinds of
[22:57] dysfunctional families and children
[22:59] Satan is trying to sell this fruit the
[23:02] way he sold in the Garden of Eden
[23:04] promising It's a Wonderful it's a joyous
[23:06] thing
[23:07] um and people go and eat of that fruit
[23:10] and all that they get is the tragic of
[23:12] the fruit it's a tree of the knowledge
[23:14] of Good and Evil he promises the good
[23:17] but if you get it outside of God's
[23:19] program all you get is the tragic evil
[23:21] what else is so intensely good and
[23:24] intensely tried can be so intensely
[23:26] tragic at the same time
[23:28] this fruit it's there it's it's a sexual
[23:32] act that's performed outside of God's
[23:35] will
[23:37] so we can we can see that it's it's kind
[23:39] of like this let's go over to Genesis
[23:41] chapter 3.
[23:42] I'm getting enough comments but but it's
[23:45] nice to kind of see what the Bible says
[23:46] here
[23:49] Genesis 3 and verse 5. verse 1. now the
[23:54] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[23:56] of the field which the Lord God had made
[23:59] notice he's not being described as a
[24:02] Slytherin creeping thing
[24:03] he's being described as a beast of the
[24:06] field that's that's subtle so in his in
[24:09] his reasoning capabilities he's a he's a
[24:12] it's at a completely different level and
[24:15] we're impressed now when you can train
[24:17] uh you go to the zoo in Fort Wayne Zoo I
[24:19] think he can there are monkeys who are
[24:21] trained to go and crack so many knots
[24:24] into particular spots and reward kind of
[24:26] man those are smart monkeys it's amazing
[24:27] but the serpent of those guys beat by a
[24:29] long shot his his reasoning capability
[24:32] is just amazing
[24:35] because he's able to speak also now
[24:39] this isn't something that he just that
[24:40] the Devil comes into him and all of a
[24:42] sudden he begins to speak because that
[24:44] would kind of be creepy to the woman why
[24:46] he wasn't talking yesterday and all of
[24:48] us he says how are you this morning
[24:49] that'd be weird but this is something
[24:52] that
[24:53] this is completely normal to have a this
[24:56] this creature we've been working
[24:57] together for and he's always talk it's
[24:59] all that they knew it was her her alarm
[25:02] balance didn't go off at all
[25:04] he just starts talking to her one day
[25:06] and starts leading her in a conversation
[25:08] down the way that she'd really never
[25:10] been LED before and he says you know did
[25:13] God really say you shouldn't eat of
[25:15] every tree of the garden
[25:17] and the woman said to the serpent now we
[25:20] can eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[25:21] garden but
[25:22] of the fruit of the tree which is in the
[25:24] midst of the garden God said You shall
[25:26] eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
[25:28] ye die and the servant oh you won't he
[25:30] won't surely die will you he's just
[25:32] gradually planting seeds of doubt and
[25:35] she just gradually listening listening
[25:38] listening there on their own
[25:40] and then he goes on God knows that in
[25:42] the day you're going to eat thereof your
[25:44] eyes will be opened you'll be as Gods
[25:46] knowing good and evil why wouldn't God
[25:49] want you to know good and evil
[25:51] why wouldn't God want you to have
[25:53] pleasure he made you this way why
[25:55] wouldn't God why would he want to
[25:57] withhold that from you we love each
[26:00] other and this is something that's
[26:01] perfectly acceptable for people who love
[26:03] each other this is fine we we desire it
[26:06] so that's how he speaks to us today
[26:08] if if you have love for one another sex
[26:11] is great if you have love for one
[26:12] another but if you don't have love for
[26:14] one another and you're just doing it
[26:15] just to have a good time then that's a
[26:18] different class altogether that's how he
[26:19] justifies today it's a serpent talking
[26:22] why would God want to withhold something
[26:24] so good from you and she just keeps
[26:27] listening and listening and notice
[26:30] all the other trees of the garden she
[26:33] knew they grew out of the ground they
[26:35] were good for food they were pleasant to
[26:37] the eyes she knew that she'd not have
[26:39] anybody she didn't need anybody to tell
[26:41] her that they were that way
[26:43] but only by listening to the serpent for
[26:45] a long time does she come to see that
[26:49] there is another tree that is also
[26:51] Pleasant to the eyes that is also good
[26:54] for good for food she didn't see that
[26:56] she learned that
[26:58] that wasn't self-evident or she learned
[27:00] that and I don't know what what how we
[27:03] told it all together but we see finally
[27:05] it was pleasant to be desired
[27:09] and then she finally took it
[27:12] ate it and then they she gave to her
[27:15] husband with her and he did eat
[27:18] and then it says the eyes of them both
[27:20] then were opened they knew they were
[27:23] naked and brother Branham says if it was
[27:27] just a natural piece of fruit then we
[27:29] should pass those around because we
[27:30] never would let people know that they
[27:31] were a naked day that that'd be a really
[27:33] good thing to know but this that just
[27:36] it's not a natural piece of fruit that
[27:38] gives you that message
[27:40] there's something more that gives you
[27:42] realizes your sense of Shame their your
[27:46] sense of desire for modesty there's
[27:48] something else there that awakens that
[27:51] and they all right right right right
[27:53] away they want to sew fig leaves
[27:56] together and make them aprons why why
[28:00] to cover their shame or the bread and
[28:02] because this is an example of the first
[28:03] religious system trying to solve your
[28:06] own problem trying to give Redemption
[28:08] for your own need there on your own
[28:11] and then when they heard the voice of
[28:13] the Lord God Walked In the Garden in the
[28:15] cool of the Dead this is what this was
[28:16] something they would have been looking
[28:18] forward to every evening the communion
[28:20] with uh with Father God as he kind of
[28:22] takes him to bed and Tucks him in tells
[28:25] him a bedtime story talks men for good
[28:27] night and now they're running from it
[28:30] Everything Has Changed notice how this
[28:33] particular sin affects everything it's
[28:37] not just I tell Sophie don't eat that
[28:39] 10th cookie she eats it and then that
[28:41] that makes the whole house
[28:44] turn upside it's not that it's something
[28:46] so much more and if you can look when
[28:50] somebody commits adultery in the family
[28:51] that turns the house upside down that
[28:55] makes even the littlest thing
[28:56] combustible anything could be it could
[28:59] lead to an explosion
[29:01] that's the kind of thing all of a sudden
[29:03] God's oh no we got to get out of here
[29:05] everything becomes different here
[29:09] so um when we so there there was an act
[29:12] here let's just keep on going
[29:15] um I'm going to run too far ahead of
[29:16] myself
[29:18] so the Lord God comes down and he calls
[29:20] into Adam verse 9 he says where are you
[29:22] he said I I heard your voice in the
[29:24] garden I was afraid because I was naked
[29:27] and I hid myself
[29:29] and good question who told you that you
[29:32] were naked
[29:33] did you eat of that tree that I told you
[29:36] that you shouldn't eat from
[29:38] and Adam points right away he doesn't
[29:40] point to that tree way over there where
[29:43] the apples hang off his as he points
[29:45] right to the woman and he says the woman
[29:47] gave this to me he's kind of pointing to
[29:50] a tree just a different one he says the
[29:52] woman that you gave me she gave me to
[29:54] eat of this uh of this tree and I did
[29:57] this it just when When sin starts the
[30:00] blame game starts right away I mean even
[30:03] as guy as as Adam is answering God's
[30:06] question he says the woman but he's
[30:07] pointing his finger at the woman because
[30:10] the woman that you gave me it's God's
[30:13] fault here too that all of this happened
[30:15] no no no taking uh responsibility for
[30:18] himself
[30:19] and he asked the woman
[30:21] he didn't he doesn't ask what did you
[30:23] eat his what have you done
[30:25] it's a different kind of a question
[30:27] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[30:30] me and I did eat and beguiled that's a
[30:32] that that's a strong word all of these
[30:34] words have particular connotations that
[30:37] that that speak of a sec of of of a
[30:41] sexual seduction they're all there and
[30:44] it's beautiful because you can teach us
[30:45] as a Sunday School Story and you can
[30:47] teach it just fine but you don't stay
[30:49] there because if you stay there you're
[30:51] missing so much you don't see how the
[30:52] devil works you don't see how who your
[30:55] enemy really is and he loves that he
[30:58] doesn't want you to see how he works he
[30:59] wants to keep you in the fog
[31:01] but it's all there
[31:03] and then it's interesting as it just
[31:05] goes on he's going to punish uh there's
[31:08] there's consequences for this and he he
[31:10] curses the uh he curses the the serpent
[31:13] let's just see
[31:15] um how how which one is cursed
[31:18] let's see here
[31:20] um in verse 14 the Lord God said unto
[31:22] the serpent he hasn't asked the servant
[31:24] what he did
[31:25] the serpent knows full well what he did
[31:27] he says watch you because you have done
[31:29] this and notice he doesn't say it
[31:30] because you've eaten this he says
[31:31] because you've done this you're cursed
[31:34] above all cattle above every beast of
[31:36] the field upon your belly you shall go
[31:38] so he's not when when when he's speaking
[31:40] when the serpent is speaking to to Eve
[31:42] there he's not on his belly then because
[31:44] he's cursed to his belly he's on he's on
[31:47] his two feet standing upright and dust
[31:50] shall you eat all the days of thy life
[31:52] what was the the the the the initial
[31:55] part of the sin that the serpent began
[31:58] with the sin of Seduction with his mouth
[32:01] and he and part of the curse is that
[32:03] Serpent's Tongue is cloven in half he's
[32:06] not going to be able to talk again it
[32:08] matches where part of the sin was
[32:10] committed and then in verse 15 I'll put
[32:13] enmity between thee and the woman and
[32:15] between thy seed or between thy
[32:18] Offspring and her seed or her offspring
[32:22] and you just kind of if you're just
[32:23] reading this in the from the from the
[32:25] Sunday School Story
[32:27] why
[32:29] is God talking about the serpent having
[32:32] an offspring and the woman having an
[32:35] offspring it's like this comes out of
[32:36] left field if you're reading it from
[32:38] this Sunday school book where did this
[32:40] come from why is it talking don't eat
[32:43] from this fruit of this tree or that
[32:44] tree and you did this and I'm going to
[32:45] be cursing you here because you didn't
[32:46] and then your Offspring and his
[32:50] offspring
[32:51] there's going to be enmity between them
[32:53] where does that come from
[32:56] well
[32:57] if you look at the back story we can see
[32:59] it there was an act there wasn't a there
[33:02] was a beguiling there was only a sexual
[33:04] act an adulterous act and there was a
[33:07] pregnancy there was something going on
[33:09] and Eve's body already that she might
[33:12] not have understood but God already saw
[33:14] and Adam came to understand also
[33:17] and then the woman he says I will
[33:19] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[33:21] conception what why
[33:23] this would seem so Random if I'm just
[33:26] eating an apple then
[33:27] I'm going to give you sorrow in your
[33:29] monthly where does that come from
[33:31] but it makes sense if you're looking the
[33:35] there's a there's there's a sexual act
[33:37] that's that's done is God's talking of
[33:39] Offspring and then the next thing she's
[33:41] the next nine months for for her are
[33:43] going to be very difficult and he's
[33:45] telling her why because you've gone
[33:47] about you've eaten from the Tree of the
[33:48] knowledge of Good and Evil instead of
[33:50] doing it in the confines of how I wanted
[33:53] you to enjoy this fruit you could have
[33:55] eaten from the tree of life but you
[33:57] didn't you went from the Tree of
[33:58] knowledge of Good and Evil and there's a
[34:00] there's an unfortunate price to pay for
[34:02] that
[34:03] and Adam is cursed in verse 17 in the
[34:06] act of seed sowing
[34:09] the thought he'll have to labor to bring
[34:10] forth and and support his family and I
[34:13] think it's also ironic in verse 20.
[34:16] he said and Adam called his wife's name
[34:19] Eve because she was the mother of all
[34:22] living
[34:23] mother
[34:25] where are the kids
[34:27] there aren't any kids walking around
[34:28] here yet
[34:29] why would there already be speaking of a
[34:32] mother of all living
[34:35] Adam understands she's with child she's
[34:39] going to be the mother and she's the
[34:40] mother of both of them she's the mother
[34:42] of all living I'm the father of one of
[34:44] them I'm not the father of both of them
[34:46] but she's the mother of all living
[34:48] these are just kind of random why is God
[34:50] speaking of Offspring why is Adam
[34:52] speaking of Offspring when in Genesis 4
[34:54] in the Sunday school version this is the
[34:57] first time when we see Adam knowing
[34:58] having carnal knowledge of his wife but
[35:01] no this is kind of summarizing what had
[35:03] already happened because it already
[35:05] happened in chapter three but they're
[35:07] already speaking about it in chapter
[35:08] three of Offspring coming and Eve being
[35:11] the mother of all living
[35:14] it's there it's there
[35:18] and Paul speaks about it like this also
[35:20] in second Corinthians chapter 11 he is
[35:23] the he's he's he's he's he's leading
[35:25] this this early church and he wants to
[35:27] present this early church he wants to
[35:29] present as a as he realizes this is
[35:32] Christ's bride
[35:33] and he says I'm jealous over you with
[35:35] Godly jealousy
[35:37] for I have espoused you to one husband
[35:40] there is an engagement here you are
[35:42] reserved for one another I'm jealous
[35:44] because I want to present you as a
[35:46] chaste virgin a pure virgin who knows
[35:49] none other but her intended bridegroom
[35:52] that's how I want to work with you
[35:54] but I fear lest by any means as the
[35:58] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[36:00] subtlety that your minds will also be
[36:02] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[36:04] Christ
[36:05] Paul is using these same metaphors that
[36:10] are filled with connections to to sexual
[36:12] relations they're there he wants a a
[36:14] pure Bride for Christ he doesn't want
[36:16] the serpent to come back again because
[36:18] you know the serpent wants the devil
[36:20] wants to keep his identity his work his
[36:23] ways of working foggy but Paul's trying
[36:26] to pull back the mask this is how the
[36:28] devil works this is your enemy he might
[36:30] come to you like an angel of Light
[36:32] speaking of the most beautiful things
[36:34] it's how we came into even it's how he
[36:36] comes every time and I want to I'm
[36:39] laboring so that you won't accept his
[36:41] lies like Eve did because corruption
[36:43] begins here you accept his thoughts and
[36:46] it goes deeper and deeper I don't want
[36:48] that I don't want you to be beguiled as
[36:50] the serpent was as as the serpent did
[36:55] are we together
[36:57] so we can see these questions why in
[36:59] Genesis 3 15 was God speaking at both
[37:01] The Serpent and Eve having Offspring why
[37:04] is Adam calling even mother when she has
[37:06] no children because she was with child
[37:08] and that was clear and God was warning
[37:11] her the next nine months you're going to
[37:12] have sorrow with your and all of this
[37:14] that's that's just part of it now
[37:16] because it's the knowledge of Good and
[37:19] Evil and it's interesting
[37:21] um
[37:22] the the situation that's described where
[37:25] you have a woman pregnant
[37:27] um with with twins from two different
[37:29] fathers it's a rare case and we see it
[37:32] right there in the Book of Genesis but
[37:34] um here's just a situation that CBS News
[37:37] covered some years back
[37:40] The Strange Case of twins with two
[37:42] different fathers that could be the
[37:44] subtitle of Genesis chapter three but it
[37:47] is a that's that's what it was
[37:49] it says in the case that sounds more
[37:51] like the makings of a daytime TV talk
[37:53] show than the real life Court proceeding
[37:56] in New Jersey judge ruled that twin
[37:58] girls were fathered by two different men
[38:01] the story began to unfold when the woman
[38:03] sought child support payments from a man
[38:05] she claimed was responsible for her
[38:07] pregnancy and according to a report at
[38:09] the New Jersey Law Journal a DNA test
[38:12] was ordered by the Passaic County Board
[38:13] of Social Services which found that the
[38:16] mother's eggs had been fertilized by a
[38:18] sperm from two different men
[38:20] happens today it's possible and it
[38:23] happened happened then as well
[38:26] and what you what we can see here
[38:29] we have the the the Bible genealogies
[38:32] bear this out so if you're having a
[38:34] genealogical family tree I was doing
[38:35] this job has got inspired the other day
[38:37] and he was making a family tree
[38:39] genealogy who's asking who uh how how do
[38:42] you spell the the parents names of of
[38:44] Grandpa and Grandma and the great
[38:46] grandparents who we were doing all that
[38:48] and um
[38:51] so and so and then they've got the child
[38:53] and so on so here God was the uh was the
[38:56] father of of Adam he made Adam and Eve
[38:58] and then their first son was was able
[39:03] and the none of the genealogies will we
[39:05] ever see that
[39:07] Adam begat Kane
[39:10] whereas Cain was the firstborn son and
[39:13] he's there and even when there's a
[39:15] situation where a firstborn son is being
[39:17] judged for something for sure of some
[39:19] sin that he did for example Reuben
[39:21] um is he loses the right to the
[39:23] firstborn later but he's still named as
[39:27] the firstborn of Jacob even though the
[39:29] firstborn promise I think goes to Judah
[39:31] um but he's still named he's not kicked
[39:33] out of the family tree but Cain
[39:36] he's not kicked out of the family he
[39:37] just never was in the family tree and
[39:39] he's never mentioned there so um
[39:42] you've got um
[39:45] after uh after the the murder of of Cain
[39:49] and Abel of after Kane's murder of Abel
[39:51] and just think what what the
[39:52] dysfunctional family Gods was
[39:55] it didn't take that long and there was
[39:57] already adultery in the family already a
[39:59] murder in the family if anybody had
[40:01] skeletons in their closet God's first
[40:03] family did
[40:04] I mean every family has them but one of
[40:07] the things I I I've come to appreciate
[40:10] about understanding the serpent seed is
[40:12] that God's Not Afraid of dysfunction
[40:14] he's not going to say oh there's a
[40:16] dysfunction in this family I got to put
[40:18] this family this particular person in
[40:20] quarantine so they don't infect the rest
[40:22] of them he doesn't do that he doesn't
[40:24] look at this function like oh there's
[40:25] leprosy I better be careful not to get
[40:28] around that person too much because I'm
[40:30] a holy God and if I'm around them too
[40:32] much I will become less holy he doesn't
[40:34] do that God
[40:36] he Embraces dysfunction because he
[40:38] realizes only by my love can that
[40:41] dysfunction become become redeemed God
[40:44] doesn't run from it God doesn't run from
[40:46] all of us have skeletons in our closet
[40:49] Alders were all tainted by the fall and
[40:52] when and we can be encouraged when the
[40:54] first family was tainted by the Fall
[40:56] brother Graham says God came running and
[40:58] screaming from Heaven Adam Adam
[41:01] where are you he doesn't give Adam the
[41:04] cold shoulder
[41:06] we give each other the cold shoulder
[41:08] sometime we might give each other the
[41:10] silent treatment sometime but God
[41:12] doesn't God goes right down there and he
[41:15] gets in and pulls up his sleeves and
[41:17] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna help
[41:18] this he gives a picture of redemption he
[41:20] goes and kills the innocent lamb
[41:22] foreshadowing Christ or there on the
[41:24] cross he slays them they try to take
[41:27] care of their their own Redemption by
[41:29] getting fig leaves God throw those
[41:30] things away
[41:32] all of our attempts to to cover for
[41:34] ourselves they're so they're so shameful
[41:36] he takes these bloody skins wraps them
[41:39] around and as and as they head out of
[41:41] Eden they've got these bloody reminders
[41:43] that something has died for me my sin
[41:46] was so terrible but God's love was so
[41:49] much greater he died for me
[41:51] and redeemed me
[41:54] So Adam is murdered by uh sorry Abel is
[41:58] murdered by Cain but the Genesis 4 25
[42:00] says Adam knew his wife again
[42:03] and she bear his son and called his name
[42:05] Abel and called his name Seth for God
[42:07] Seth she hath appointed me another seed
[42:10] instead of Abel whom Cain flew so we can
[42:13] see then that Seth comes in this line
[42:16] and he is the replacement of Abel
[42:20] there's not more seed but it's not more
[42:22] seed that's not what the Bible says
[42:24] because Abel's gone Cain left I didn't
[42:27] have a child give me it's more no it's
[42:29] another seed Seth is replacing Abel's
[42:31] spot there
[42:33] and then the genealogies in Luke and
[42:36] Luke's genealogy worked backwards from
[42:38] Jesus Christ and it goes back with
[42:39] Christ's Earthly genealogy through
[42:41] Joseph I believe and it goes all the way
[42:44] back and says so so and so who was the
[42:46] son of Enos who was the son of Seth who
[42:49] was the son of Adam who was the son of
[42:51] God and what an awesome genealogy Adam
[42:54] has he can go straight to God
[42:56] but you know what that's what God wants
[42:58] to restore us to by being born again we
[43:00] can point hey I don't my Earthly
[43:02] genealogy I really don't not too
[43:04] concerned about that I can go straight
[43:05] to God God's my father
[43:08] and then Genesis 5 3 Adam lived 130
[43:11] years and notice how this is phrased he
[43:14] began a son in his own likeness after
[43:17] his image and called his name Seth
[43:20] nowhere does it say that Cain was in his
[43:23] own likeness or was in his own image no
[43:25] that's what Seth was because Seth was
[43:28] Adam's son Cain wasn't
[43:31] if we look at page four
[43:34] on our handout King's genealogy is
[43:37] nowhere found with Adams but we can find
[43:39] different hints in the Bible where he
[43:42] came from in First John 3 12.
[43:45] says Cain was of that Wicked one
[43:50] Who Dares how dare somebody call Adam
[43:53] the father of Cain Adam was the son of
[43:56] God
[43:58] not of that Wicked one
[44:00] and then in Revelation 12 9 it just as
[44:03] interesting The Book of Revelation in
[44:05] the Book of Genesis shed the most light
[44:07] here talk about the Great Dragon was
[44:09] cast out that old serpent the devil and
[44:13] Satan how much clearer do we need to be
[44:15] who the serpent was that old serpent the
[44:18] devil Satan who deceives the whole world
[44:20] he started out deceiving in Eden he's
[44:23] still doing it today so Cain's genealogy
[44:26] is tied up with the serpent the devil
[44:28] the dragon the wicked one
[44:31] and uh in his uh track brother Jason
[44:34] Demars refers to um
[44:37] um how the um
[44:39] some Jewish the Jewish tradition he says
[44:43] um
[44:44] um they refer to they assert that Adam
[44:47] was not the father of Cain rather Eve
[44:49] was subject to adultery having been
[44:51] seduced by the serpent in the Garden of
[44:53] Eden or the Devil Himself so there is
[44:56] um there is aspects of Jewish tradition
[44:57] that hold to that as well and even the
[45:00] in church history tertullian uh talks
[45:02] about uses uses the same kind of
[45:04] metaphors and suggesting that Eve was
[45:07] also impregnated by uh the serpent also
[45:10] or by the devil so the same it's a
[45:14] similar Point here
[45:16] so we take these literal genealogies
[45:19] throughout the Bible if we take them at
[45:21] face value
[45:22] and interpret them as the accountant
[45:25] Genesis would suggesting to be
[45:27] interpreted in Genesis chapter 6 we see
[45:29] the sons of God
[45:31] seeing the daughters of men that they're
[45:33] fair and they're taking wives and here
[45:34] you see Seth's line those are the sons
[45:36] of God because as soon as the sons of
[45:38] God as soon as Seth has children then
[45:40] then it's called the sons of God they
[45:42] begin to call the name of the Lord
[45:43] that's a clear characteristic of God's
[45:45] children their calling upon God's name
[45:47] but then at a certain point the sons of
[45:48] God start seeing how beautiful the
[45:50] daughters of men are that'd be Keynes
[45:53] line and then the lion starts to
[45:55] intermix
[45:56] and that was the devil's goal
[45:59] that was the devil's goal because he
[46:01] knows
[46:02] um he knows that God's goal was to have
[46:05] what what was to see man as his Temple
[46:08] and be enthroned upon this Temple and
[46:10] ever since Lucifer was in heaven Lucifer
[46:13] wanted to be seated there at the most
[46:14] high wanted to be on God's throne and he
[46:17] got kicked out of heaven for doing for
[46:18] for trying him that was his goal he's
[46:21] kicked down to uh to Earth there and he
[46:23] tries to do that he's doing the same
[46:25] thing there in the Garden of Eden he he
[46:27] knows God wants to Tabernacle these
[46:30] Earthly human beings he wants to be he
[46:32] wants them to be his Temple
[46:34] and he says no I'm going to beat him to
[46:35] it I want to be I want to be Lord of
[46:38] that Temple and a second Thessalonians
[46:41] talks about how the Antichrist he wants
[46:42] to sit in the temple of God showing
[46:44] himself that he is God that's what he's
[46:46] still trying to do in this Temple of our
[46:49] souls that that is his goal
[46:54] um
[46:57] let's take a look um
[46:58] in the message power of Transformations
[47:00] it's a October of 1963. brother
[47:05] branham's on the road and he says when I
[47:06] go home this time for after this trip
[47:08] I'm going to preach on the subject the
[47:09] trail of the serpent the beast at the
[47:11] beginning the beast at the end and Trail
[47:14] him right through the Bible and show how
[47:16] he heads up and just watch how cunning
[47:18] that fellow is that just like Judas and
[47:21] Jesus there both brothers in their tribe
[47:24] just like Esau and Jacob and everything
[47:26] is a twin and this great Warfare that
[47:28] we're in and it just he never preached
[47:31] that sermon he died first but you can
[47:33] still go through the message and it's
[47:36] all there
[47:37] you can see how the the trail of the
[47:40] serpents going throughout the scriptures
[47:42] going throughout church history going
[47:43] throughout he's still working the same
[47:45] way and in the in the in the church age
[47:48] book brother Brandon keeps keeps showing
[47:50] us that um that you have that false
[47:53] flying that True Vine both growing
[47:55] together he says we talked about that
[47:57] one or two sessions ago so this is a
[48:00] great truth slightly less glorious truth
[48:02] but still a great truth I hope you'll
[48:04] capitalize on what he says do capitalize
[48:06] on them because we can see the false
[48:08] fine it gets so discouraged and throw
[48:10] the baby out with the bath water it's
[48:11] all that way but no there's a mystery
[48:13] there there's two Vines growing there
[48:15] together and the devil tries to get them
[48:17] to be so intertwined
[48:19] like they were in the Garden of Eden so
[48:22] intertwined that if you're good to touch
[48:24] one you really can't be certain which
[48:26] one you're touching that's what he
[48:27] that's what he wants to do to try to
[48:28] deceive
[48:30] and in the Ephesian Church age it says
[48:32] the religion and the spiritual world are
[48:34] made of those two trees which had their
[48:36] roots and Eden it's still that way both
[48:38] the tree of life and the tree of the
[48:40] knowledge of Good and Evil
[48:42] they both stood in the midst of the
[48:44] garden and no doubt their very branches
[48:46] intertwined each other
[48:48] thus in the Ephesian church is that same
[48:51] Paradox so way back there in the early
[48:53] church a very short period after
[48:55] Pentecost the false Vine got to
[48:58] intertwine itself around the True Vine
[49:00] and we see those deeds of the
[49:01] Nicolaitans that's what we read in the
[49:03] book of Acts the book of Acts you see
[49:05] just the Tree of Life shooting forth and
[49:07] how beautiful that fruit is but very
[49:10] quickly after that in the Ephesian age
[49:12] smarten age pergaming age further you
[49:14] see all these other things cropping up
[49:16] how did that get there
[49:20] and that's I think one of the
[49:21] significances of uh the serpent Seed
[49:25] doctrine
[49:28] the new their new testament passages
[49:31] that also refer
[49:32] um to this idea of other being two seed
[49:35] lines
[49:36] and as we kind of try to wrap this up
[49:39] um we'll take a look at First John 3
[49:41] Verses 9 through 12. this I think it's
[49:43] probably bottom of page four
[49:45] um whosoever is born of God does not
[49:47] commit sin for his seed remains in him
[49:49] and he can't sin because he's born of
[49:51] God
[49:52] in this the children of God are manifest
[49:54] and the children of the devil
[50:01] the children of God and the children of
[50:03] the devil I just want to give a step
[50:04] back and give a copy I don't believe
[50:06] that you can go through and take a DNA
[50:08] test that well this particular person
[50:10] based on their DNA this is seed of God
[50:12] and this particular person oh their DNA
[50:15] their blood testures and their seat of
[50:17] serpent it's not a physical thing if it
[50:19] were a physical thing that all these
[50:21] sons of Abraham and the Pharisees say
[50:23] were of the seat of Abraham they had
[50:25] their genealogies they could show it and
[50:27] prove it so if it were a physical thing
[50:29] then they would be in
[50:32] if it were a physical thing and get two
[50:34] Believers and it's just they have a
[50:36] child they're in they have a child
[50:38] they're in but it's not it's very clear
[50:41] you have to be born again so it's not a
[50:43] physical seed we're all so
[50:46] our flesh is Just Junk because the devil
[50:49] polluted it we're all that way we're all
[50:51] in need of a savior we're all in need of
[50:52] being revived we all need that it's not
[50:56] a physical thing by any means at all
[50:58] some people try to twist the stocks and
[51:00] make it say something that it doesn't
[51:01] say
[51:03] in Matthew 13 it's interesting Jesus
[51:05] teaches the same thing
[51:07] and the misters of the Kingdom he says
[51:09] the field is the world The Good Seed is
[51:11] he's interpreting us to the disciples
[51:13] are the children of the Kingdom but the
[51:15] tares are the children of the wicked one
[51:17] or who was the first tear of the wicked
[51:20] one well Cain was of that Wicked one
[51:22] there are many others who have been sown
[51:24] by this wicked one
[51:26] the enemy who sowed them is the devil
[51:30] Jesus we're not reading too much into
[51:32] this to say that Jesus Christ is kind of
[51:34] teaching a form of what happened in the
[51:36] Garden of Eden here how did it get this
[51:38] way
[51:40] and I love John chapter 8.
[51:43] Jesus speaks to the Pharisees and they
[51:47] they've he's been speaking to them
[51:49] and they say unto him Abraham is our
[51:51] father we're good
[51:55] but Jesus says if you were Abraham's
[51:57] children you would do the works of
[51:59] Abraham but now you seek to kill me and
[52:01] Abraham didn't try to do that
[52:03] who did try to do that first
[52:05] you do the Deeds of your father
[52:08] and they know what he's talking about
[52:11] they don't say no we are he said we
[52:13] weren't born a fornication what a weird
[52:16] thing to throw in there
[52:18] I mean it's like somebody's been caught
[52:20] doing something wrong at school and says
[52:21] I wasn't born no it doesn't it doesn't
[52:24] fit but the Pharisees know what Jesus is
[52:28] talking about you do the Deeds of your
[52:30] father you seek to kill me who is the
[52:33] first murderer
[52:35] what is he telling him they knew what he
[52:37] was talking about
[52:38] we're not born of fornication we have
[52:40] one father even God
[52:42] if God were your father Jesus says you
[52:44] would love me for I proceeded forth and
[52:46] came from God neither can I have myself
[52:48] but he sent me why don't you understand
[52:50] my speech it's because you don't want to
[52:53] understand my speech you cannot hear my
[52:55] wordy because you are of your father the
[52:58] devil
[52:59] wow
[53:01] this is strong language but it's all
[53:04] pointing right back where was the devil
[53:07] doing fathering it goes back to Eden
[53:10] where was there an act of fornication an
[53:13] act of illness is sexual relations it
[53:15] was back in the Garden of Eden and that
[53:17] goes right through and Jesus is
[53:18] highlighting it you are of your father
[53:21] the devil he was a murderer from the
[53:23] beginning he's saying you're a Cain's
[53:25] kids that's what he's saying you're not
[53:27] of Abraham you're Cain's kids
[53:28] he Abode not in the truth because
[53:30] there's no truth in him when he speaks
[53:32] of a lie he speaks of his own he's a
[53:34] liar and the father of it and you're his
[53:36] kids
[53:37] wow
[53:39] did the religious leaders but he's
[53:40] telling him this because
[53:42] there's there's a truth and man think
[53:44] about John the Baptist
[53:46] he he all these religious leaders come
[53:48] to him as he's baptized and he says you
[53:50] Generation of Vipers
[53:53] what are vipers
[53:55] they're snakes talking about Generations
[53:57] it's Offspring he's Jesus says here in
[54:01] Matthew 23 33 you serpents you
[54:03] Generation of Vipers how can you escape
[54:05] the damnation of hell
[54:08] it's there if you let scripture
[54:11] interpret scripture you can see that
[54:14] it's there
[54:16] there are twins throughout the scripture
[54:18] and in the last days Church where the
[54:21] branches there's always twins the church
[54:22] in the last days there's going to be
[54:24] twins and on the top of page six I
[54:27] believe it is I made a a list it's
[54:30] probably not exhaustive but I tried to
[54:32] find I think this is from the
[54:35] um
[54:36] no I've done my notes now um
[54:39] uh two messages for brother Bramley
[54:41] starts listing him out I can't remember
[54:43] him now but Luther and Michael we're
[54:45] we're twins they're in there they're in
[54:48] heaven can't enable you have the
[54:49] daughter of men the sons of God lot and
[54:52] Abraham
[54:53] a lot of desire for asandom Abram was
[54:56] going the other way Ishmael and Isaac
[54:58] God's and there
[55:01] uh Abraham and Sarah they had the
[55:03] promise but there's twins being born
[55:05] right from where the promise was was
[55:07] given
[55:09] um Jacob and Esau being twins one has a
[55:11] desire for truth the other one doesn't
[55:13] brother Bram talks about Korah and Moses
[55:15] being twins both men who were anointed
[55:18] do certain things but leading different
[55:20] way
[55:22] um Moab and Israel Balaam is being a
[55:24] lead of a leader of one set of of the
[55:26] false twin Israel going the right way
[55:28] there was ahab's school of the prophets
[55:32] 400 of them then Makai the prophet
[55:35] um the Pharisees John the Baptist go all
[55:37] the way through and even at the last
[55:38] days the Antichrist and the Holy Spirit
[55:40] will be so like each other that they
[55:42] deceived the very elect if it were
[55:43] possible Twins and if you don't really
[55:46] know them really well
[55:48] you'll get the names mixed up and that's
[55:51] how he says in the last days it would be
[55:55] it's been twins all along even the Holy
[55:57] Spirit and the Antichrist will be twins
[55:59] so close it will deceive the very elect
[56:01] if it were possible
[56:03] so just in the in conclusion brother
[56:06] Michael if you want to you want to come
[56:08] um
[56:10] I like to ask the so what question of
[56:13] what what is the significance of the
[56:15] serpency doctrine why is it so important
[56:18] we don't want to just have something
[56:19] that was oh this is deep I've got inner
[56:21] better knowledge than somebody else does
[56:23] it just Puffs us up it's this isn't
[56:25] something to Puff ourselves up it's
[56:26] something actually quite humbling we see
[56:28] how rotten we are I say the serpent C
[56:32] Doctrine gives a clear understanding of
[56:34] the first promise of redemption it
[56:36] without the doctrine of the serpent seed
[56:38] we have a story with a clear Hero by the
[56:40] foggy villain
[56:42] um his identity remains foggy but the
[56:44] serpentry doctrine shows us who that
[56:46] villain really is and help us understand
[56:49] the reference like Romans 3 20 the God
[56:51] of Peace shall Bruce Satan under your
[56:53] feet shortly Jesus Christ was going to
[56:55] be the serpent Bruiser he was but he's
[56:57] still bruising the serpent under your
[56:59] feet as we have his Christ's Spirit
[57:02] within us and we go forward we follow
[57:04] his Warfare instructions we're bruising
[57:07] say under our feet as well because we
[57:09] are also sons of God and like I've
[57:12] mentioned the serpent C Doctrine just
[57:14] shows the awful effects of not just
[57:17] sexual sin in the film but really any
[57:19] sin James chapter 1 verses 14 and 15
[57:23] says this um lust when the hath
[57:26] conceived bringeth forth sin and that
[57:30] that's a that's a sexual analogy of what
[57:33] of any kind of sin it works that way sin
[57:35] when it is finished brings forth death
[57:37] it destroys all kinds of relationships
[57:39] but God is not put off he's uh he
[57:42] doesn't distance himself from it he runs
[57:45] toward it not to accept it God's not
[57:46] saying it's it's okay he's saying no I
[57:49] want to help you if you're willing to be
[57:51] helped but you know what to be to be
[57:52] helped requires humility because you
[57:54] have to say yes I need it
[57:57] I'm completely messed up would you help
[57:59] me but he showed the servant seat
[58:01] Doctrine helps us see just how awful sin
[58:04] is shows us the importance of the Virgin
[58:06] birth why did a virgin have to conceive
[58:10] that that the egg and the sperm were
[58:13] placed there by God
[58:15] and and he and and Mary was just a
[58:19] carrier of that
[58:20] and it just shows also this is the
[58:22] serpency doctors in continuity with the
[58:25] Battle of Rage some from the very
[58:26] beginning it's all it's all there and I
[58:30] just pray that um the Lord will help us
[58:32] to uh to to see it to see how the devil
[58:35] is still working today as we can uh so
[58:37] we can war against him effectively
[58:40] I hope that um that establishes us
[58:43] perhaps on a little stronger um biblical
[58:46] footing we don't have to be afraid to
[58:49] share what we believe because it's there
[58:51] in the Bible and uh it uh it's very
[58:54] clear I trust you it's been if you want
[58:56] more information brother Jason to Mars
[58:58] track is there in the back
[59:00] um
[59:00] perhaps we can just uh close in the word
[59:03] of Prayer amen
[59:05] Heavenly Father we just thank you for
[59:07] your goodness to us Lord I Thank you for
[59:09] the Revelation that you have given
