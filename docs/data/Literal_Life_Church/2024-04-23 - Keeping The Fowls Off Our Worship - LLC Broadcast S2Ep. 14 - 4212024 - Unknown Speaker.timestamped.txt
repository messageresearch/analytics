[2:39] D walking close to
[2:45] thee let it
[2:48] be dear Lord let it
[2:56] be
[2:58] just
[3:00] closer just a closer walk just a closer
[3:05] walk just a
[3:08] closer
[3:10] [Music]
[3:17] closer walking close to
[3:23] me let it
[3:26] be dear Lord let it it
[3:33] be let it
[3:35] be dear Lord let it
[3:41] be let it
[3:46] be minds and he said unto him I am the
[3:49] Lord that brought thee out of er of the
[3:51] chaes to give thee this land to inherit
[3:54] it and he said Lord God whereby shall I
[3:56] know that I shall inherit it and he said
[3:57] unto him take me a haer of 3 years old
[4:01] and a she goat of 3 years old and a ram
[4:04] of 3 years old and a turtle dove and
[4:07] young pigeon and he took unto them all
[4:09] these and divided them in the midst and
[4:11] laid each piece one against another but
[4:13] the birds divided he not and when the
[4:16] fowls came down upon the sacrifice or
[4:19] the carcasses Abram drove them away so
[4:23] it's God God is course coming to Abraham
[4:26] in this incident in Genesis 15 to
[4:28] reconfirm his promise that he gave him
[4:30] he's coming to confirm to him the the
[4:33] Covenant that he gave him the promise he
[4:35] gave him so it's reconfirming or
[4:37] confirming the Covenant that he has with
[4:39] Abraham and as you study it you realize
[4:42] this is not a covenant that is making a
[4:44] deal with Abraham that Abraham if you'll
[4:47] do this I'll do this this is an
[4:49] unconditional Covenant and you see God
[4:53] taking care of and doing it all and it's
[4:56] an unconditional it does it's not based
[4:58] upon the actions or perform performance
[5:00] of Abraham it's a different Covenant at
[5:02] the beginning God made a the adamant
[5:04] Covenant was he said you do this and and
[5:07] and this and this and so then man failed
[5:09] in that and we always fail when we're
[5:11] making deals with God man is always the
[5:14] one that fails you don't want to make a
[5:15] deal you don't want to want to be
[5:17] careful of promises that you make can
[5:19] you say amen I think promises are good
[5:21] but we want to make sure with God that
[5:24] in our human weakness sometimes we make
[5:26] a promise but the thing is I'm glad to
[5:28] be under an unconditional Covenant
[5:30] tonight with my God a covenant that says
[5:33] I have done it I have paved the way I
[5:35] have made the way for you and if you'll
[5:37] yield yourself to me I've I've got this
[5:40] journey from your beginning all the way
[5:42] till the end I will finish it for you
[5:44] and so God is coming to Abraham to
[5:47] confirm this Covenant but he does it in
[5:49] a very strange way uh but as he does it
[5:52] it reveals so much about where we are at
[5:56] in the people of God right now because
[5:58] we're at the very end of the RO Royal
[6:00] Seed of Abraham finishing up this
[6:02] journey Abraham began the journey and
[6:05] his Royal seed will finish the journey
[6:07] and if we're not the at the end I'm just
[6:09] crazy I don't understand we are at the
[6:11] end we are at the final generation uh
[6:14] and the final expression of the royal
[6:17] Seed of Abraham and I believe I'm
[6:18] preaching to some of those here tonight
[6:20] that's a pretty important time to be in
[6:22] and so when we go into the idea of Abram
[6:25] uh Shing these fowls away on Sunday we
[6:28] just begin to bring break into this idea
[6:30] of the sacrifice being there and Abram
[6:33] chewing off the fouls and keeping the
[6:35] foul birds away from the sacrifice God
[6:38] laid out a perfect sacrifice before him
[6:41] and uh and and he gave Abraham the
[6:45] specifics of a a perfect sacrifice that
[6:47] God would accept and and to and to lay
[6:51] Abraham to lay his life in worship
[6:52] before that it was a perfect sacrifice
[6:55] Abraham in his reconfirmation here God
[6:58] has him lay out these three animals and
[7:01] these the turtle dove and the pigeon and
[7:02] it all represents Christ it all
[7:04] represents something and I'm going to
[7:06] read it to you in a minute what it means
[7:08] it all means Christ but he lays out the
[7:10] perfect sacrifice he splits the three
[7:12] animals and he lays them a certain way
[7:14] and Abraham is standing in front of a
[7:16] perfect sacrifice now it's not a perfect
[7:18] atonement for his sins but before
[7:20] Calvary came it's the sacrifice that's
[7:22] God's going to accept now if you mess
[7:25] with that sacrifice you're tampering
[7:27] with God's perfect atonement and
[7:28] sacrifice but if you leave it alone that
[7:31] is going to be your answer you worship
[7:33] under that blood can you say amen and if
[7:35] you'll stay there and worship under that
[7:37] blood God's going to finish the the
[7:39] promise and we see then that as people
[7:41] of God come to the real uh reality of
[7:45] what the atonement has done for us and
[7:48] how perfect our sacrifice and how the
[7:51] the the worshipper doesn't have to be
[7:53] perfect but the sacrifice has to be
[7:55] perfect when we start learning that then
[7:57] we realize we release our s in a rest
[8:00] and a worship to God like we've never
[8:03] had before right during our time Satan's
[8:06] fowls are trying to mess with our
[8:09] atonement and when he does it contain
[8:13] our
[8:16] worship that our worship is not pure
[8:19] because he's tainted our sacrifice he's
[8:21] added to it he's taken away from it and
[8:24] that's a pretty uh when we add to
[8:26] something or we take away let's just let
[8:29] talk about our sacrifice let's talk
[8:30] about what God did for us when we add to
[8:33] it or we take away from it that's a
[8:36] serious thing it's perfect when in
[8:38] itself is it not it's perfect when in
[8:42] itself and so the last scripture in the
[8:45] Bible says whoever takes one word of
[8:49] this out or adds one to that's the last
[8:52] warning you know what he saying the last
[8:54] warning the last warning of the Bible
[8:56] must be pretty serious whoever takes out
[8:58] of this or puts in will have his name
[9:00] taken off the book of life that's pretty
[9:02] serious in other words he's saying don't
[9:05] touch this don't touch
[9:07] it leave it
[9:09] alone believe it but don't touch it
[9:12] don't add to it don't add your Works to
[9:14] it don't take away from it don't loosen
[9:15] it up don't loosen up the gospel don't
[9:18] add to the gospel leave it alone and let
[9:20] it do its powerful work in your life
[9:23] keep it simple keep it uncomplicated
[9:25] leave it alone let God take it and put
[9:28] it in our lives the way he wants to you
[9:31] know it's when we have the right thing
[9:33] before us and worshiping under the right
[9:36] thing is when we have the greatest
[9:38] forces trying to mix it trying to taint
[9:41] it trying to distract us away from it
[9:44] let me say it again it's when you have
[9:46] the right thing the right sacrifice the
[9:49] right word is when the devil's trying to
[9:51] fight so hard against
[9:53] it okay he's trying to taint it he when
[9:56] we have the right worship with the right
[9:58] sacrifice and it's and it's the the the
[10:01] sacrifice and the power of it the word
[10:03] is changing us and when it changes us
[10:05] then we get stimulation a revelation and
[10:07] we raise our hands in worship and we
[10:09] we're in freedom of worship I'm
[10:11] worshiping under the right thing the
[10:12] blood of Jesus Christ purely not
[10:14] anything added to it or taking it away
[10:16] no wonder Satan hates that and tries to
[10:18] taint worship and taint the sacrifice to
[10:22] mix it to taint it to take pieces of the
[10:25] word and splice it
[10:27] together or not read the rest of it or
[10:30] not get a balance of it or only use the
[10:33] parts that maybe endorse our background
[10:37] we should pray and keep it balanced and
[10:39] Cast Away influences to bind up our
[10:42] worship and to scare us and to pervert a
[10:46] pure atonement that he gave us to
[10:48] worship under that's right praise the
[10:52] Lord I like when people worship free and
[10:55] I don't mean that they can just be free
[10:58] as far as physically worshiping they're
[11:01] free down here they're free in their
[11:04] Spirit their emotions have been
[11:06] delivered from the bondage of Satan
[11:08] that's why they can shout they can cry
[11:10] they can raise their hand there's
[11:11] nothing binding them because
[11:13] everything's Unbound in here can
[11:15] somebody give me an amen tonight it's
[11:17] not just you physically do it but
[11:19] something has set you free in your
[11:21] spirit something has set you free in
[11:23] your soul I know what a soul freedom
[11:26] feels like I'm not bound by religion I'm
[11:29] not bound by dos and don'ts but there's
[11:32] a rest there's a Sabbath in my soul I
[11:36] know where I stand with God and when I
[11:38] come before him if I have a mistake I
[11:41] bring it quickly under the the blood of
[11:43] Jesus Christ and go right back to
[11:45] raising my hands and worshiping God I
[11:47] came across a sermon by Spurgeon and I
[11:50] referred to it uh Spurgeon the Charles
[11:53] Spurgeon the prince of preachers and he
[11:55] he uh he takes this scripture Genesis 15
[12:00] and verse 11 and he takes it uh uh quite
[12:04] uh in a more practical way and I just
[12:07] can't get by without bringing out some
[12:09] of his points from it to help us a
[12:11] little bit and the way he takes it is
[12:12] that he looks at the interruptions from
[12:15] our thought life that interrupt our
[12:19] worship how many knows that can take
[12:21] place it's kind of a good place to start
[12:24] let's start with our
[12:25] thoughts the part that nobody can see
[12:31] the part that you can hide from
[12:33] everybody you may have traveled tonight
[12:35] and taken several trips in the last 30
[12:39] minutes while I've been preaching your
[12:41] mind could have exited here and went to
[12:44] many other things even while you're
[12:46] physically sitting in front of me saying
[12:49] amen every now and
[12:50] then because that's the power of your
[12:54] thoughts and I think it's important
[12:56] maybe to talk about this first because
[12:58] you can talk about all other worship and
[12:59] all other things but he says when we
[13:02] come to worship and he's particularly
[13:04] going to hone in on Sundays because 150
[13:06] years ago that was the thing that's what
[13:08] you did on Sundays you come to worship
[13:10] so he really goes into the distractions
[13:13] in our mind to the fouls that come
[13:16] around to interrupt our worship even
[13:18] when we come in church and come to
[13:19] service he he really elaborates on the
[13:22] fouls that come in our minds and the
[13:23] thoughts and uh I'll tell you sometimes
[13:25] I hear Spurgeon say things 150 years ago
[13:28] and I'm saying wow the devil's still the
[13:30] same today we're still fighting the same
[13:31] devil he was dead on on some things and
[13:35] he's a real Pastor you can tell he's a
[13:37] real Pastor too because he's seen so
[13:39] much The Human Side of the people and
[13:41] yet pointing him to Christ all the time
[13:43] and and so now he takes interruptions in
[13:45] our thoughts into our worship especially
[13:48] when we're sitting in church and also
[13:50] not giving one day a week Sunday to
[13:53] undistracted worship that was a big deal
[13:56] so he speaking on not giving one day a
[13:59] week
[14:00] Sunday uh giving it un giv it to
[14:03] undistracted worship and so I want to
[14:06] touch on what he says we might use this
[14:09] text he said uh Genesis 15:11 everybody
[14:12] still with me he said we might use this
[14:14] text if we chose as a picture of the
[14:16] ease which with faith repels all attacks
[14:20] that are made upon Christ the fouls
[14:23] rushing them away from the sacrifice the
[14:25] great sacrifice of the New Covenant
[14:27] answorth tells us that the original word
[14:29] word which we translate drove he drove
[14:31] them away has in it the force of puffed
[14:34] them away as if a a very puff of breath
[14:37] these Kites and vultures and Eagles
[14:39] where he uses Eagles were at Once Driven
[14:41] away from the bodies of the victims
[14:43] Faith knows how when skeptical kites
[14:46] when Blasphemous vultures when
[14:49] speculative speculative birds come down
[14:51] to attack the sacrifice of Christ knows
[14:54] how to chase them away but with a puff
[14:56] of her breath we know whom we have
[14:58] believed the Bible says let the Earth
[15:01] let the Earth shake our confidence in
[15:03] him cannot move he is to us as real as a
[15:06] person as always nay we might doubt our
[15:09] own existence but Jesus his power his
[15:12] love his Precious Blood his prevalent
[15:15] atonement we dare not doubt
[15:18] that one puff of the breath of prayer
[15:21] and questions and cavals are gone one
[15:25] puff of the breath of Holy Faith In
[15:27] Praise And every skeptical attack is
[15:30] scattered to the winds as far as we are
[15:34] concerned when these fouls come down
[15:36] upon the body of Christ like Abram by
[15:38] faith we puffed them away he drove them
[15:41] away but I do not intend to use this
[15:43] text with such an object this morning
[15:45] this one of his morning sermons 150
[15:47] years ago I do not intend to use this
[15:50] text with such an object this morning
[15:52] though one might legitimately do so it
[15:54] seems to me to represent to us our duty
[15:57] when distracting thought thoughts invade
[16:00] the sanctity of our holy worship here's
[16:03] Abraham he has killed the victims
[16:05] according to the divine order he has
[16:07] laid them in their places according to
[16:08] the Heavenly rule he is waiting until
[16:11] God shall over these victims make and
[16:13] ratify the Covenant but meanwhile the
[16:16] buzzards the kites the vultures sent the
[16:20] B sense the body from afar and hasten to
[16:22] Devour the Flesh of the bolock and the
[16:25] ram Abram chases them away that is so
[16:28] his sacri sacrifice may not be spoiled
[16:32] and he may have real fellowship with
[16:37] God brothers and sisters we never
[16:39] attempt to worship god without finding
[16:42] some difficulties in the way we never
[16:46] attempt to worship God remember worship
[16:47] is not just the church lifting our hands
[16:50] worship is our life towards him every
[16:52] day and so so now we never attempt to
[16:54] worship god without finding some
[16:55] difficulties in the way and he quotes a
[16:58] PO that says what various hindrances we
[17:00] meet in coming to The Mercy
[17:04] Seat what various hindrances we meet in
[17:07] coming to The Mercy Seat now you can be
[17:09] coming to any other thing but when you
[17:12] begin to come to the real mercy seat
[17:14] with the power of atonement coming back
[17:16] on your life hindrances get in the way
[17:19] thoughts get in the way Satan gets in
[17:22] the way see young people just so close
[17:25] to coming to a Brokenness to to cross
[17:28] the sound Berry and come into Christ and
[17:31] they get bombarded with all kinds of
[17:34] things some boy or girl comes along or
[17:37] some thing of the world that they're
[17:39] feeding on comes along some new thing
[17:42] and they were just on the verge of
[17:44] crossing the sound barrier and Satan
[17:46] interrupts at all of it because why they
[17:48] were setting their eyes and their heart
[17:50] towards The Mercy
[17:52] Seat what various hindrances we meet in
[17:54] coming to The Mercy Seat we and our
[17:57] assemblies are like angels and
[18:00] theirs when the sons of God came
[18:02] together Satan came also with them how
[18:03] many knows that in the days of joob when
[18:05] the sons of God presented themselves
[18:07] Satan was there
[18:08] too so as sons of God when they come to
[18:11] present themselves Before the Throne of
[18:13] God Satan comes that's a scriptural uh
[18:15] scriptural truth we find that where what
[18:18] wherever we may be and in whatever frame
[18:20] of heart and with whatever earnestness
[18:23] we may attempt to worship God there is a
[18:27] servant with us who must be told to stop
[18:30] at the foot of the mountain while we go
[18:32] and worship God Yonder on the
[18:34] Mountaintop or else our offerings will
[18:36] not be profitable to ourselves nor
[18:39] acceptable to God now how important is
[18:42] our worship before the Lord and how
[18:45] important is our sacrifice that he's
[18:47] revealed to us in this hour how
[18:50] important are those two things it's
[18:54] everything our worship is our life
[18:56] before this sacrifice God gave us and
[18:59] this word that power that comes from the
[19:00] word the two most important things in
[19:03] your life young person parents the most
[19:06] important things you set before your
[19:08] children is what Christ has done for us
[19:11] can you say amen and our lives are
[19:13] worship unto him because of it our lives
[19:16] are our worship the priority it's above
[19:20] any other
[19:22] thing
[19:23] but you're going to have a
[19:26] battle because you start to set your
[19:28] heart towards the mercy seat and your
[19:30] children's Hearts you're going to have
[19:32] the devil bring in some
[19:34] fouls that you have to sh away but
[19:37] Spurgeon says it's our thoughts and
[19:40] here's the thing he getes from Charles
[19:42] Spurgeon I'm going to read some of what
[19:43] he said and I'm going to encourage you
[19:44] to go read it because I can't read all
[19:46] the paragraphs under it it's a full
[19:47] sermon it's tremendous stuff but here's
[19:50] what he says the types of thoughts that
[19:51] invade our worship Wicked thoughts
[19:54] worldly thoughts anxious thoughts
[19:57] annoying thoughts
[19:59] ecclesiastical
[20:03] thoughts I don't know uh you can't sit
[20:07] here and say oh he's from 150 years ago
[20:10] how many can raise your hand and say
[20:12] yeah he's got some truth here to what
[20:13] he's saying of what interrupts our
[20:16] worship Wicked thoughts worldly thoughts
[20:19] anxious thoughts annoying thoughts
[20:20] ecclesiastical thoughts and so the first
[20:23] are wicked thoughts the Sons of Satan
[20:25] the wicked thoughts are the Sons of
[20:26] Satan these respect no sac places the
[20:29] sanctity of our closet has been violated
[20:31] with thoughts of
[20:33] lust the Dignity of The Mercy Seat has
[20:35] net suffice to rep repress the vile
[20:39] insinuations of blasphemy wickedness
[20:42] though it dwelleth no more in the heart
[20:43] of the believer yet seeketh to find a
[20:45] lodging there did you notice how sound
[20:48] that Doctrine
[20:50] is wickedness though it dwelleth no more
[20:53] in the heart that's what I just preached
[20:55] you the desire for sin is burned out by
[20:57] the power of calvary and the Holy Ghost
[20:59] so there's no more desire for sin on the
[21:02] sole level wickedness though it dwelleth
[21:04] no more in the heart of the believer yet
[21:06] seeketh to find lodging there and well
[21:10] doth it affect its purpose at times for
[21:12] it terth like a wafering man for a night
[21:15] lingering there sufficiently long to Mar
[21:18] our devotion and to prevent our having
[21:22] joy in fellowship with God Wicked
[21:26] lustful thoughts Charles virgin is dead
[21:29] on Wicked lustful thoughts can invade
[21:31] your mind to stop your stop your pure
[21:34] Worship in the Lord can can you say Amen
[21:37] then he says worldly thoughts in company
[21:39] with these foul
[21:41] vultures these things called worldly
[21:44] thoughts which spring from the force of
[21:45] habit the wheels have been running the
[21:47] last six days in this direction and his
[21:49] gets into the seventh day the first day
[21:51] excuse me the last six days the wheels
[21:53] have been running the last six days in
[21:55] this direction it is not quite so easy
[21:57] to reverse the action and to make them
[21:59] go the other
[22:00] way we have been sinking sinking sinking
[22:03] in the myy clay of Daily Business it is
[22:07] not very easy for the soul that lies
[22:10] cleaving to the dust to rise at once
[22:13] towards heaven on
[22:15] Sunday it is no wonder when you have so
[22:18] many things to think of in this age of
[22:20] competition 150 years ago the age of
[22:26] competition it is no wonder when you
[22:28] have so many things to think of in this
[22:30] age of competition that The Ledger
[22:32] should lie there in front of the Pew
[22:34] instead of the Bible and that at times
[22:37] the daybook should come in when your
[22:39] hand holds the hym book or that you
[22:41] should be thinking of a bad debt or of a
[22:44] long account which is rather precarious
[22:46] instead of meditating upon the
[22:48] faithfulness of God of the pardons
[22:51] bought with the blood of Jesus Christ
[22:54] you're thinking about business
[22:57] life you're letting those thoughts
[22:59] invade the worship that is around the
[23:03] greatest thing in the world and that's
[23:04] the atonement for your life you gave
[23:06] yourself permission to by be diverted by
[23:09] what he calls worldly thoughts and I
[23:11] agree with them business thoughts life
[23:13] thoughts the cares besides Wicked and
[23:15] morly thoughts another set of ravens
[23:17] would be croaking over us I mean anxious
[23:21] thoughts which are the fruits of our
[23:23] unbelief oh saith One how can I help it
[23:25] how can I help it how can I help these
[23:28] anxious worrisome thoughts if you knew
[23:30] my condition in business you would not
[23:31] Marvel that I that care or worry would
[23:34] come in today loss after loss
[23:37] continually going backward though with
[23:39] energy and perseverance I seek to make
[23:43] progress you don't know how I feel I've
[23:45] got justification for these worrisome
[23:48] thoughts if you knew the condition of my
[23:51] business right
[23:53] now everybody don't forget that this
[23:55] isn't Paul Le fonting saying this this
[23:58] is Charles
[24:00] Spurgeon sometimes in our prayers and in
[24:02] our Sabbath worship we shall be
[24:03] disturbed by those carryon crows
[24:07] called annoying thoughts The Offspring
[24:10] of our vanity I will just mention some
[24:12] of them that you will that you will
[24:14] think perhaps rather odd but I have no
[24:17] doubt you know them we have known
[24:19] sometimes a sister come to worship and
[24:21] she
[24:23] notices why is Mrs Sono is why Mrs Sono
[24:27] is dressed differently
[24:28] from what she was in last Sunday or
[24:32] perhaps my breth and as you came in
[24:33] there was some little mistake at the
[24:35] door or when our friend got to the Pew
[24:38] he found it occupied by somebody else
[24:41] that's my
[24:44] seat or he is not occupying just the
[24:47] door seat where he likes to sit or
[24:48] perhaps he's standing in An Inconvenient
[24:51] place you know we're chuckling at this
[24:54] stuff and it's 150 years ago but I'm
[24:55] saying he's dead on because our thoughts
[24:59] can invade our freedom of worship I
[25:02] didn't want to pass this practical
[25:04] advice to us
[25:06] okay apply what Abraham did to the
[25:09] sacrifice and apply it to your thoughts
[25:12] nothing should be able to invade our
[25:15] freedom of worshiping
[25:17] God especially when we come here I do my
[25:20] part to keep this place Sanctified this
[25:22] building set aside no other events going
[25:25] on in here keep it quiet you can come
[25:26] here anytime and pray throughout
[25:28] throughout the day we if the door is not
[25:30] open we'll get it open for you this is a
[25:31] place set aside for him if we do that
[25:34] then when you come how about a prar a
[25:37] preparation in your heart to say I'm
[25:39] going to give my full mind and attention
[25:41] to what God's going to do in this
[25:45] place let me finish this he says he says
[25:49] uh I will mention the brood of fowls
[25:52] which will haunt Mount Zion I mean in
[25:54] the last one is ecclesiastical thoughts
[25:56] so what do I mean by these why that
[25:58] sometimes when our minds should be
[25:59] perfectly free from work for worshiping
[26:01] God Church business perhaps Church
[26:03] differences thrust them themselves upon
[26:06] us the Deacon thinks he may worry
[26:08] himself a little about something that
[26:09] has occurred with the poor the Elder
[26:12] thinks it would be a justifiable to be
[26:13] thinking over the case of such and such
[26:16] h a refractory individual whose case has
[26:18] troubled him the member thinks he may be
[26:20] fretting about the dullness of the
[26:25] ministry the minister thinks he may be
[26:27] groaning because some in the galleries
[26:29] have not joined the church and and and
[26:31] mark all these are good things in their
[26:34] places but they have no business at all
[26:36] with us when we come to God's house to
[26:38] worship him then these birds even though
[26:42] they they uh then these birds even
[26:45] though they like The Sparrows that build
[26:48] under the ease of the altar must be
[26:50] driven away for until we can get rid of
[26:53] all we shall not find the day of rest
[26:57] such as it should be nor will our
[27:00] worship be acceptable Before the Throne
[27:03] of God nor our own Souls derive The Joy
[27:07] they ought to have from the service and
[27:10] the presence of the
[27:12] Lord this may be simple
[27:14] tonight Charles spurgeon's points may be
[27:18] simple and practical but they are
[27:21] right how about we start with our own
[27:23] thoughts when we talked about brushing
[27:25] away the fouls off the sacrifice how
[27:27] about we start with our own thoughts
[27:28] getting in the way of our worship in the
[27:30] way of our Sundays in the way of our
[27:32] victory in the way of our freedom to
[27:35] worship casting down
[27:38] imagination in every High thing that
[27:42] exalteth itself above the knowledge of
[27:46] God where's that at brother Paul why
[27:48] don't you to go find it tonight it's
[27:50] your
[27:52] homework casting down imagination and
[27:56] every High thing that exalted itself
[27:59] above the knowledge of God bringing into
[28:04] captivity every thought to The Obedience
