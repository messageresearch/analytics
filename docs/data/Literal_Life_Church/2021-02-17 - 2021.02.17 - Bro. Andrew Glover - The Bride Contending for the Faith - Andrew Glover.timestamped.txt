[0:56] different kinds of seasons and i believe
[0:58] you all are just blessed with it up here
[1:00] and so you can keep it and we'll keep
[1:01] the south amen
[1:02] and god bless you this evening genesis
[1:04] the third chapter
[1:06] i want to look in the first verse here a
[1:09] very familiar scripture to everyone here
[1:10] i know
[1:11] the bible says now the serpent was more
[1:14] subtle than any beast of the field
[1:16] which the lord god hath made and he said
[1:19] unto the woman yea hath god said ye
[1:23] shall not eat of every tree
[1:24] of the garden and the woman said unto
[1:27] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[1:29] the trees of the garden
[1:30] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:32] the midst of the garden
[1:34] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:36] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[1:39] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[1:42] shall not surely die
[1:43] for god doth know that in the day you
[1:45] eat thereof your eyes shall be opened
[1:47] and ye shall be as
[1:48] gods knowing good and evil and when the
[1:51] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:53] food
[1:54] and it was pleasant to be to the eyes
[1:56] and a tree
[1:58] to be desired to make one wise she took
[2:00] of the fruit thereof
[2:02] and did eat and gave ulcer unto her
[2:03] husband with her and he didn't eat
[2:06] and the eyes of them were both opened
[2:09] and they knew that they were naked and
[2:10] they
[2:11] sewed fig leaves together and made
[2:14] themselves aprons
[2:15] now if we could look in the book of
[2:17] second corinthians 11 chapter
[2:21] from the old testament there over here
[2:23] to the new testament in second
[2:24] corinthians 11
[2:26] and verse number one
[2:29] i know very familiar scripture to you
[2:31] here as well
[2:33] just want to share a few things the lord
[2:34] has put on our heart out of this
[2:37] chapter 2 corinthians 11 verse 1 now
[2:40] paul here writing
[2:42] says what to god you could bear with me
[2:44] a little in my folly
[2:46] and indeed bear with me for i am jealous
[2:48] over you with godly jealousy
[2:50] for i have espoused you to one husband
[2:52] that i may present you as a chaste
[2:54] virgin to christ
[2:55] but i fear lest by any means as the
[2:57] serpent beguiled eve through his
[2:59] septility
[3:00] so your minds should be corrupted from
[3:03] the simplicity
[3:04] that is in christ for if he that cometh
[3:07] preacheth another jesus whom we have not
[3:09] preached
[3:10] or if you receive another spirit which
[3:12] you have not received or another gospel
[3:14] which you have not accepted he might
[3:17] well bear with him
[3:18] for i suppose i was not wit behind the
[3:21] very chiefest apostles
[3:23] but though i be rude in speech yet not
[3:25] in knowledge
[3:26] but we have been made thoroughly
[3:28] manifest among you in all things
[3:30] have i committed an offense and abasing
[3:32] myself that you
[3:33] might be exalted because i've preached
[3:35] you the gospel of god freely
[3:37] he says i robbed other churches taking
[3:40] wages of them
[3:41] to do you a service and when i was
[3:43] present with you
[3:44] and wanted i was chargeable to no man
[3:47] for that which was lacking to me the
[3:49] brethren which came from macedonia
[3:51] and in the thing and supplied and in all
[3:53] things
[3:54] i have kept myself from being burdened
[3:56] unto you
[3:58] so will i keep myself we ask the lord
[4:01] this evening to add the blessing to the
[4:02] reading of his word as we just bow our
[4:04] hearts together
[4:05] for a word of prayer here this evening
[4:07] how many just say lord speak to me
[4:08] tonight from your word
[4:10] god bless you heavenly father lord as
[4:13] your believers have gathered here this
[4:14] evening
[4:15] lord on this cold and snowy night on the
[4:19] outside
[4:20] but lord we are not here tonight just to
[4:22] be here we're not here for
[4:24] form or fashion the lord we're here to
[4:26] hear from your word lord we're here to
[4:28] feed upon you
[4:29] lord we know that your prophet has told
[4:31] us that we're the carcasses
[4:33] there the eagles will be gathered
[4:34] together and lordy has showed us how
[4:36] important it is
[4:37] that the eagles must gather around that
[4:39] word and feed up on that word and father
[4:42] i pray tonight lord for these eagles
[4:44] that stand before me tonight god
[4:46] lord i have nothing to offer them lord
[4:48] there's nothing i can say
[4:49] or do that will strengthen them but lord
[4:52] your word is your present
[4:53] and your word is still a discerner of
[4:55] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[4:57] father i'm asking you tonight just to
[4:59] send a blessing in this building
[5:01] may you anoint us afresh tonight god may
[5:03] you anoint your children
[5:05] lord those who would be at home watching
[5:06] by the way of internet lord
[5:08] i pray you would just visit the homes
[5:10] their fathers speak to the families oh
[5:12] god
[5:13] and lord whatever the conditions or
[5:15] circumstances would be
[5:16] may you move upon each and everyone's
[5:18] behalf lord we're hungry to hear from
[5:20] you tonight god
[5:21] and whatever is accomplished here we'll
[5:23] be sure to stand back and give you all
[5:25] the praise and all the honor and all the
[5:27] glory
[5:28] for to the wonderful name of our lord
[5:30] and savior jesus christ we pray
[5:32] and all the believers said amen
[5:36] and amen as you be seated this evening
[5:37] we say god bless you
[5:39] from those scriptures tonight for just a
[5:41] few moments if the lord would help me
[5:43] i'd like to speak to you on a thought
[5:44] here and if i would title it tonight i
[5:46] want to speak to you on
[5:47] the bride contending for thee faith
[5:50] the bride contending for the faith and i
[5:53] truly believe tonight with all of my
[5:55] heart
[5:56] that we are living in a perplexed time i
[5:58] believe we're living in a very confusing
[6:00] time
[6:00] i believe it's a time where the prophet
[6:02] of god said two hundred thousand
[6:03] thousand devils have been loosed out of
[6:05] the river of euphrates against the bride
[6:08] amen so we're living tonight in a
[6:10] perplexed time paul would say it like
[6:12] this in second corinthians 4
[6:14] and verse 8 he says we are troubled on
[6:16] every side
[6:17] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[6:20] we are not
[6:21] in despair i love paul's comparison
[6:23] there when he says we are perplexed
[6:25] but we are not in despair the word
[6:27] perplexed there means to be in doubt
[6:29] or to stand in doubt to be without
[6:31] resources to be in strength uh to be
[6:34] embarrassed not to know which way to
[6:36] turn so paul is saying
[6:38] amen we we are not here not knowing
[6:40] which way to turn
[6:41] he says but we are not in despair he's
[6:44] saying here we're not going to renounce
[6:46] all hope the word despair
[6:48] actually means to come under so much
[6:50] pressure that you actually denounce all
[6:52] hope
[6:52] and i think at night it's something how
[6:54] that many people
[6:56] get in trials and they get in situations
[6:58] and they get under pressures
[6:59] amen and they don't know where to turn
[7:01] kind of like the day we're living in
[7:02] today
[7:03] and they just kind of stand there and
[7:05] it's at those moments and those times
[7:06] that satan does
[7:08] everything possible amen to get them to
[7:10] turn
[7:11] from what they should be turning to but
[7:13] i think tonight they meant in these
[7:14] perplexed times that we are faced these
[7:16] situations
[7:17] amen we we may not know sometimes we're
[7:20] to turn at times we may not know where
[7:22] to go but there is one thing
[7:24] amen there is a bride upon the earth
[7:26] tonight who is not renouncing
[7:28] amen our hope and our hope is not
[7:30] politics our hope is not the government
[7:33] amen but our hope tonight is the lord
[7:35] jesus christ now
[7:36] amen you know as well as i know the word
[7:38] of god testifies
[7:40] that in the hour that we're living in
[7:42] there will be a falling
[7:44] away paul says we beseech you brethren
[7:46] by the coming of our lord jesus christ
[7:48] and by our gathering together unto him
[7:50] that you be not soon shaken in mind
[7:52] notice where paul says this that you be
[7:55] not soon shaken in mind or troubled
[7:58] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[8:00] letter asked from
[8:01] us as that the day of christ is at hand
[8:04] let no man deceive you
[8:06] by any means for that day shall not come
[8:09] except there come a falling away first
[8:11] and the man of sin be revealed the son
[8:14] of perdition now think of this
[8:16] amen the falling away is not coming the
[8:19] falling away is here we're not looking
[8:21] for the falling away
[8:22] the falling away is here among us it's
[8:24] in the land and the prophet takes time
[8:26] here and i'd like to just read this to
[8:28] you
[8:28] he said brothers the time has come we're
[8:30] in the last day
[8:32] we're in the atomic age the time has
[8:34] come that they got a weapon
[8:35] that can shake this world from its orbit
[8:37] in five minutes time into the sun
[8:40] and cause a total annihilation they
[8:41] couldn't have done that before but the
[8:43] time has come
[8:44] he said the time has come where there's
[8:46] a falling away the bible said except
[8:48] there cometh falling away the man of sin
[8:50] won't reveal himself
[8:51] and he says the pentecostal church is
[8:53] living in the final of all times the
[8:55] time has come
[8:56] he said but the time has come for the
[8:58] signs to follow the believers we're at
[9:00] the end time we're in the latter reign
[9:02] we're at the time when men will be heady
[9:05] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[9:07] lovers of god
[9:08] amen truth breakers false accusers
[9:10] incontinent despisers of those that are
[9:12] good
[9:13] he said heady and high-minded the time
[9:15] has come when they're teaching doctrines
[9:17] of devils perverting the bible's
[9:19] teaching
[9:19] into theories and theologies to draw
[9:21] groups of people away after them
[9:23] he said the time has come that god will
[9:25] gather his church together
[9:27] amen under one great big banner of the
[9:29] lord jesus christ and pour out his
[9:31] powers among them
[9:32] and great signs and wonders will take
[9:34] place the time has come
[9:36] the time has come for the pentecostal
[9:38] church to make a stand
[9:39] he said the time has come to circumcise
[9:41] the church and cull out all this
[9:43] foolishness the time has come
[9:45] to go back to the old landmark the time
[9:47] has come for the outpouring the time has
[9:49] come for the gathering of the people and
[9:51] i love how he caps this
[9:52] all he said the time has come for jesus
[9:55] to come amen
[9:56] the time has come for signs and wonders
[9:58] to follow the believers the sign
[10:00] of the time has come amen for the great
[10:02] falling away the time has come for
[10:04] everything
[10:05] amen but listen tonight church the time
[10:07] has come for jesus to come we're
[10:09] we're not living in another age looking
[10:11] for the coming of the lord to come three
[10:13] ages out
[10:14] amen but right here tonight the time has
[10:16] come amen and if we're ever going to do
[10:19] anything brethren
[10:20] he said it's time to do it now the time
[10:23] is at hand and i think tonight
[10:24] as paul said there cannot be an end time
[10:27] amen there cannot be a falling away
[10:30] amen there cannot be an end time until
[10:32] there comes a falling away he says from
[10:34] the pentecostal faith
[10:36] and the pentecostal faith will be done
[10:37] away with he said and the dignitaries
[10:40] will set in
[10:41] and we're here right now and see that
[10:43] falling away
[10:44] see the church getting further and
[10:46] further away he said going right back
[10:48] again
[10:48] we're at the end time how many will
[10:50] agree that we're at the end time we're
[10:52] not looking for the end time
[10:54] amen but we're in the end time he said
[10:56] see paul goes on to say to timothy there
[10:58] would come
[10:59] amongst the church a falling away but
[11:01] notice what they're falling away from
[11:03] they are falling away from the bible
[11:06] faith see is that right he said is that
[11:08] a promise look at them today
[11:09] what are they doing organizing
[11:11] themselves pulling away don't believe in
[11:12] the bible
[11:13] don't believe in the real true word what
[11:15] is it it's maturing
[11:17] it's the end time signed seed he said
[11:19] when you see these things happening lift
[11:21] up your head say
[11:23] amen when you see them falling away when
[11:25] you see the churches getting cold when
[11:26] you see
[11:27] amen then replacing the bible faith with
[11:29] dignitaries and philosophies when you
[11:31] see that
[11:32] amen that's not the time to bear your
[11:34] head amen but that's the time to lift up
[11:37] your head
[11:37] amen we see the falling away here amen
[11:40] but there is a bride
[11:42] on the earth tonight that is ordained
[11:44] and is predestinated and is chosen from
[11:47] before the foundation of the world
[11:49] have been to stand in the hour of the
[11:51] fallen away amen i think it's amazing
[11:54] how that god
[11:55] amen deals in the prophetic do you
[11:56] believe that tonight
[11:58] amen god has a prophetic tithe
[12:02] now i think it's amazing here that if
[12:03] you study bible prophecies
[12:05] you'll actually see that there are two
[12:07] bible prophecies
[12:08] in the end time that's being fulfilled
[12:11] at the same time amen
[12:12] amen two bible prophecies in the end
[12:14] time being fulfilled
[12:16] at the same time the first one here is
[12:18] in first timothy four verse one now the
[12:20] spirit speaketh expressly
[12:22] that in the latter times which are these
[12:25] times that
[12:26] some shall depart from the faith giving
[12:28] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[12:31] of devils
[12:32] amen speaking lies in hypocrisy and
[12:34] having their conscience seared with a
[12:36] hot iron
[12:37] now look at what this word depart means
[12:39] the word depart
[12:40] actually means to draw away or to
[12:42] refrain or to withdraw oneself from
[12:45] it means to excite to revolt it means to
[12:48] desert what one used to embrace now
[12:50] think of that
[12:51] amen there's a time coming that god
[12:53] prophesied through paul
[12:55] amen to timothy and said the time's
[12:57] coming where some
[12:58] are going to withdraw themselves from
[13:00] the faith amen son
[13:02] is going to pull away from the faith
[13:03] psalm amen is going to have such a
[13:05] spirit upon them that they're going to
[13:07] produce a revolt and
[13:08] they're going to become excited by that
[13:10] revolt to cause others to leave the
[13:12] faith
[13:13] amen now that's one prophecy but here's
[13:15] another one in jude 1 3
[13:16] amen beloved when i gave all diligence
[13:19] to write unto you of the common
[13:20] salvation
[13:21] it was needful for me to write unto you
[13:23] and exhort you
[13:24] that she should earnestly contend for
[13:26] the faith which was once delivered unto
[13:29] the saints so here
[13:30] even 33 years after pentecost jude is
[13:33] moved
[13:34] by the spirit think of this amen the
[13:36] sigh i feel like preaching
[13:37] amen the same spirit that fell upon paul
[13:40] he meant to ride into timothy and tell
[13:42] him
[13:43] he meant in the latter times some are
[13:45] going to depart from the faith
[13:46] is the same spirit of god amen that
[13:49] moved upon jew to ride
[13:51] and say there's some going to depart
[13:53] from the faith but there's some going to
[13:55] contend for the faith think of that
[13:57] tonight
[13:57] amen now contend does not mean to argue
[14:00] but otherwise it means to hold fast
[14:03] amen or to uphold or to stay put with as
[14:06] we call the street expression he says i
[14:08] want you to earnestly
[14:09] amen not just half-heartedly amen but
[14:12] with all your soul
[14:13] and might amen contend for the faith and
[14:16] i'll say tonight
[14:17] i don't believe that god has given you
[14:19] this bill and i don't believe that god
[14:21] amen has put a holy ghost-filled man
[14:23] behind this pulpit
[14:24] he meant to preach to a bunch of
[14:26] departers amen but i believe i'm looking
[14:28] at some tonight that ordained
[14:30] amen from the genes of almighty god amen
[14:33] not to depart from the faith
[14:35] amen but to contend for the faith think
[14:38] about that
[14:38] some are departing amen but some are
[14:41] contending some
[14:42] amen are withdrawing themselves but some
[14:45] amen has given everything that god and i
[14:47] say tonight
[14:48] let it be said of this church have been
[14:50] that every ounce of strength it is in
[14:52] our body
[14:53] every bit of breath it is in our lungs
[14:55] let it be given amen not as a departer
[14:58] amendment is somebody that says you can
[15:00] shoot me but i'll stand for this faith
[15:03] you can throw everything you've got at
[15:04] me devil but i'll stand for this faith i
[15:07] was not ordained
[15:08] amen to fall under prophecy amen ever
[15:11] fallen away but i was ordained
[15:13] amen to be a part of the gathering
[15:15] together unto christ
[15:18] to think tonight amen some are departing
[15:21] amen but some
[15:22] are contending amen now you say brother
[15:24] andrew what is the faith
[15:26] let me say it like this there are no two
[15:28] faiths there is only one faith paul will
[15:30] say
[15:31] there is one lord there is one faith and
[15:34] there is one baptism
[15:36] one lord one faith one baptism he said
[15:39] now to contend for the faith
[15:40] it's not a faith there is really only
[15:43] one faith now many people says
[15:47] well that's against my faith he said
[15:49] there's many faiths
[15:51] but there's only one the faith see amen
[15:53] there's a baptist faith
[15:55] there's a pentecostal faith there's a
[15:57] methodist faith but there's really only
[15:59] one faith and that is the faith now the
[16:01] prophet says if the scripture
[16:03] said he exhorted to earnestly contend
[16:05] for the faith
[16:06] not a faith the faith that was once
[16:08] delivered to the saints
[16:09] each one of us wants to say that our
[16:11] churches does that
[16:12] and he says the only way to be positive
[16:14] sure of this not
[16:15] church is to go back and see what kind
[16:18] of a faith they had to contend for
[16:21] he said watch now there's only one thing
[16:23] about it you can go and refer to your
[16:25] reasons
[16:26] and you can confine yourself to reason
[16:28] but god doesn't come by reason
[16:30] he said you know god by simple amen
[16:32] child like
[16:33] faith to accept his word you say it's
[16:36] the truth and believe it that's how you
[16:38] know god
[16:38] is by faith not by reason your reason
[16:41] power within yourself but
[16:43] faith comes from god amen can we say
[16:45] that together
[16:46] faith comes from god he meant now if
[16:48] we're going to find out what kind of
[16:49] faith we're contending for
[16:51] then we've got to go back to the source
[16:53] of that faith and a prophet here is
[16:55] identifying the faith that we are
[16:56] contending for
[16:58] is the faith which did not come from a
[17:00] man
[17:01] it did not come from a prophet it did
[17:03] not come from a school
[17:05] amen but the faith came from the god hey
[17:08] man
[17:08] to think tonight he said oh and it's the
[17:11] substance of things hoped for
[17:13] it's the evidence of things not reason
[17:15] he said there's where it comes from
[17:17] through here
[17:18] amen through the unadulterated power of
[17:20] the lord jesus christ that makes a
[17:21] creature a new person
[17:23] and baptizes him anew in the holy spirit
[17:26] and washes him and hangs him up
[17:28] and seals him in the kingdom of god then
[17:30] he stands
[17:31] knowing where he's at i love this and
[17:34] all the devils in hell
[17:36] amen couldn't shake him away from it
[17:38] amen see tonight the faith that is in
[17:40] your hearts
[17:41] is not a baptist faith it is not a
[17:44] methodist faith it is not a pentecostal
[17:46] faith
[17:46] amen there are people that's god about
[17:48] this faith and they went through the
[17:50] same things you've gone through and
[17:51] they're not standing tonight
[17:53] amen they've got a methodist faith been
[17:56] through the same things that some of you
[17:57] have been through
[17:58] and they're not standing tonight why
[18:00] because it's not a faith
[18:01] amen that can weather the storms but i'm
[18:04] talking about some recipients tonight
[18:06] amen that's got the same faith that
[18:08] moses had got the same faith that david
[18:10] had
[18:11] got the same faith that three hebrew
[18:13] boys had and that faith
[18:15] has not come from a man has not come
[18:17] from a church but that faith has come
[18:19] from almighty god
[18:20] and there ain't enough devils in hell
[18:23] there ain't enough devil's past
[18:24] there was present or enough devils in
[18:26] the future he meant to shake us away
[18:28] from that faith
[18:30] it's not a man's faith it's christ's
[18:32] faith now do you realize christ's faith
[18:34] is not earned amen christ's faith is
[18:37] given
[18:39] paul says it like this for by grace are
[18:41] you saved through faith
[18:42] and that not of yourselves it is the
[18:45] gift of god
[18:46] not of works us any man should boast
[18:48] galatians 2 16
[18:50] knowing that a man is not justified by
[18:52] the works of the law but by the faith of
[18:55] jesus christ
[18:56] even we have believed in jesus christ
[18:58] that we might be justified by the faith
[19:00] of christ
[19:01] and not by the works of the law but by
[19:04] the works of law shall no flesh be
[19:06] justified
[19:06] now watch this in philippians 3 9 and be
[19:09] found in him not having my own
[19:11] righteousness
[19:12] which is of the law but that which is
[19:14] through the faith of christ
[19:16] he said the righteousness which is of
[19:18] god by faith
[19:19] amen now that's just a few of multiple
[19:21] scriptures that we can identify
[19:24] where this faith has come from and how
[19:26] we got it amen
[19:27] it came from god and we received it by
[19:29] god
[19:30] now in the message the door to the heart
[19:32] amen i'm trying to lay a foundation but
[19:34] y'all's pulling so we'll just preach
[19:35] okay
[19:36] amen oh there's just a lot of those
[19:37] doors he said let's find the door of
[19:40] faith here on the side
[19:41] he said now i have faith but don't you
[19:43] go to fooling with my faith
[19:45] he said there's only one faith and
[19:47] that's the faith of god
[19:50] he said that's right the door is all
[19:52] closed up he said because you don't want
[19:54] to fool around that door
[19:55] or let jesus around there because as
[19:57] soon as he stands in that door
[20:00] he will scream out i am the same
[20:03] yesterday today and forever and your
[20:06] creeds will bar that
[20:07] he said but he is the same no doubt now
[20:10] watch you'll come to church
[20:11] and watch signs and wonders if god be
[20:13] performed and you won't pay attention
[20:15] that because the creed has locked the
[20:17] door of faith in you
[20:18] and made you think that that is a faith
[20:21] notice this
[20:22] amen the creed has locked the door and
[20:25] made you think that that is a faith
[20:27] he said and there's only one faith
[20:29] that's the faith of god
[20:30] and the only one can bring the faith of
[20:32] god is jesus christ
[20:34] his son that comes into your heart he's
[20:37] knocked at your door through signs and
[20:38] wonders and miracles
[20:40] but you keep that all pinned up i don't
[20:42] want nothing to do with that
[20:43] oh if he could only stand and you would
[20:46] open that door it wouldn't be
[20:47] two minutes he meant to you'd believe
[20:50] every word the bible wrote
[20:52] think about that and say amen to every
[20:54] bit of it if you would just open the
[20:56] door
[20:57] and let jesus come in and give you the
[20:59] faith that he has to give you you've
[21:02] took the faith some creeds give you
[21:04] and you've locked the door on christ's
[21:05] faith but when you take
[21:07] christ's faith and then then you can
[21:09] recognize him
[21:11] think about that if you take him in the
[21:13] sap out of the peach tree and transfuse
[21:15] it
[21:16] into an apple tree amen then the apple
[21:18] tree will bear fruits
[21:20] and if you take a man's faith and put it
[21:22] into somebody
[21:23] the man will produce man's faith but if
[21:25] you take
[21:26] jesus christ the son of god and place
[21:29] him in the heart of a believer by a new
[21:31] birth experience
[21:32] amendment the same god amen that spoke
[21:35] out of jesus the word made flesh
[21:37] and cursed the fig tree and the next day
[21:39] it tried to that same faith will come
[21:41] inside the church in these last days
[21:43] and there'll be some messiahs amen amen
[21:46] i'm not talking about church members
[21:48] i'm not talking about theologians i'm
[21:50] talking about holy ghost-filled messiahs
[21:52] amen with a backbone to stand and say
[21:55] satan take your hands off my family
[21:57] take your hands off my church i'm
[21:59] talking about somebody
[22:00] that has got the same faith that was in
[22:03] abraham and moses
[22:04] and jesus has returned in this day
[22:08] oh i got to be hate myself here i'm not
[22:10] talking about a faith i'm
[22:12] talking about the faith i'm talking
[22:14] about a faith that makes devils fear you
[22:16] i'm talking about a faith amen that the
[22:18] devil can throw everything he's got at
[22:20] you
[22:21] and you'll still stand up and say but it
[22:22] wasn't enough amen i'm talking about a
[22:25] faith that you can receive the worst
[22:27] report possible
[22:28] and you'll walk out there and say thank
[22:30] you for your services doctor
[22:31] amen but i'm going to go see the great
[22:33] physician because he said by my stripes
[22:36] amen you are healed are you hearing me
[22:38] amen a man's faith
[22:40] won't do that amen by the faith of the
[22:42] son of god
[22:43] amen will call things that are not amen
[22:45] as though they are the faith of the son
[22:47] of god
[22:48] amen will stand and say greater is he
[22:51] that is in me
[22:52] than he that is in the world the faith
[22:54] of the son of god will say if god be for
[22:56] this church
[22:57] then who can be against it i'm talking
[23:00] about somebody tonight that's received
[23:02] amen the same thing they got in the
[23:04] upper room
[23:06] oh are you hearing me the same faith
[23:09] that was in the upper room is in literal
[23:11] life church tonight
[23:12] it meant the same anointing amen that
[23:14] filled abraham to stand there
[23:16] and say i know sarah's milk veins are
[23:18] dried up and there's no life in that
[23:20] womb
[23:21] and there's no life in this body but
[23:23] there is a god
[23:24] who can bring a son out of resurrection
[23:27] it's the same god tonight
[23:28] that is here performing in the power of
[23:31] his resurrection
[23:34] he said when we get so transfused by his
[23:36] power that we die to our own thinking
[23:38] and our faith becomes a genuine faith
[23:42] he said then the life of christ is
[23:45] transfused
[23:46] into us when our thinking is gone
[23:49] brother
[23:50] when our thoughts are gone then the
[23:53] thoughts
[23:53] and the life of jesus christ is
[23:56] transfused into us
[23:58] now we know tonight that we are living
[24:00] creatures of god
[24:01] the prophet said a dwelling place where
[24:03] the holy spirit can send his radiant
[24:05] blessings down to there
[24:07] and we're in the stature of christ
[24:10] amen now you may not see this tonight
[24:12] but let me preach to you from my heart
[24:14] amen he's not looking at you based upon
[24:16] what you were
[24:17] he's not looking at you ain't been based
[24:19] upon what you have been
[24:21] he's looking at you tonight amen based
[24:24] upon the blood
[24:25] and he sees you amen as a tube
[24:28] as a channel amen that he can manifest
[24:31] the radiance
[24:32] of his blessings through now we know
[24:34] tonight that there was a first adam
[24:36] and there was a first eve we learned
[24:38] that in sunday school didn't we
[24:39] amen there's a first adam there's a
[24:41] first eve amen but through a prophet's
[24:44] teaching
[24:44] we now understand that there is a second
[24:47] adam
[24:48] and there is a second eve the prophet of
[24:50] god said seek the first adam
[24:52] and the first e fail he said but the
[24:55] second adam
[24:56] and eve will not and cannot fall i love
[24:59] that
[25:00] amen the first they fail but the second
[25:02] adam and eve
[25:04] will not somebody shout will not
[25:07] and cannot will not and
[25:10] cannot fall now when you hear that you
[25:12] think well
[25:13] if there was a first adam and eve then
[25:15] the first was in a garden
[25:16] if there's a second adam and eve then
[25:18] there's got to be a garden and the
[25:20] prophet god said see if you get the tape
[25:22] satan's eaten he said many of you's got
[25:24] it he has made
[25:25] another garden of eden and 6 000 years
[25:29] it's taken him to make it
[25:30] just like god did at the beginning god
[25:32] made his eden
[25:34] and satan corrupted it now watch we've
[25:36] got another garden of eden right here by
[25:38] prophet
[25:39] and then we hear this who is the second
[25:41] adam
[25:43] in the book of first corinthians 15 45
[25:46] and so it is written the first man adam
[25:48] was made a living soul but the last adam
[25:51] was made a quickening spirit
[25:54] first adam a living soul last adam which
[25:56] is the second adam
[25:58] was made a quickening spirit and the
[26:00] prophet said he would speak in the first
[26:02] adam
[26:03] was the one who had jurisdiction over
[26:06] everything in the earth over
[26:07] all the animals and he lost his power
[26:10] think of that
[26:11] and where he taught in the bible that
[26:13] what the first
[26:14] adam lost amen the second adam christ
[26:17] restored again to the human race what
[26:21] the first adam lost
[26:22] amen the second adam which is christ
[26:24] restored to the human race
[26:26] so therefore who is amend the second eve
[26:29] and ephesians or colossians 1
[26:31] verse 18 and he is the head of the body
[26:34] the church
[26:35] skip down to verse 22 in the body of his
[26:37] flesh to death
[26:39] amen to present you amen holy and
[26:42] unblameable
[26:42] and unreprovable in his sight amen so
[26:45] the first adam
[26:46] and the first they fail but the second
[26:49] adam is christ
[26:50] and the second eve is the church it's
[26:53] the it's the bride of jesus christ
[26:55] then through the life of his son his
[26:57] cross the blood it says here of his
[26:59] cross that he might reconcile himself a
[27:01] body of bride
[27:02] which is eve second eve he said the same
[27:05] thing he did in adam and eve giving a
[27:07] type
[27:07] that they were christ in the bride he is
[27:10] the second adam and the church
[27:12] is the second eve think of that there's
[27:14] no question
[27:15] you are the second eve it's settled
[27:17] tonight a prophetess spoke you
[27:19] are the second eve he said as long as
[27:22] the second eve compromises
[27:23] then she's doing the same thing the
[27:25] first step done he said but god purposed
[27:28] and hid it from the eyes of the prudent
[27:30] and wise and revealed it to the
[27:32] predestinated babes who were
[27:34] predestinated to receive it
[27:36] now think of this the second he he is
[27:39] not coming by marriage she's not coming
[27:41] by what she's done
[27:42] amen but she's coming by predestination
[27:45] and she's not coming to receive
[27:47] something amen but she was predestinated
[27:50] before the foundation of the world
[27:52] amen to receive it listen church you
[27:54] didn't receive your identification at an
[27:56] altar
[27:57] you didn't receive your identification
[27:58] in a church if you are the second eve
[28:01] amen you was identified from before the
[28:04] foundation of the world
[28:07] he said now somebody shout now i love
[28:10] this now you can see now
[28:12] the end time message why it's rejected
[28:14] can't you
[28:15] amen see no denomination but the
[28:17] revelation of his mystery
[28:19] he said god is not known by denomination
[28:22] he is known by revelation
[28:24] then god in his body christ and christ
[28:27] in his body the bride
[28:29] he said god made manifest in christ and
[28:32] christ made manifest in the bride
[28:34] see and is bringing a pride out that
[28:37] won't fall by denomination
[28:39] amen and creed this second adam is
[28:42] bringing out a second eve
[28:43] that will not fall he said she is amen
[28:46] the second eve
[28:47] but she is not breaking and spoiling her
[28:50] skirts of purity and holiness to her
[28:52] husband
[28:52] she'll stay with the word regardless of
[28:55] what anybody else says
[28:57] you can't have all the ecumenical moves
[28:59] you want and all the affiliations
[29:01] in the masterpiece he said the second
[29:03] adam and the second eve now ready
[29:05] for the garden for the millennium amen
[29:08] in the masterpiece again the great
[29:09] masterpiece of the family
[29:11] he said now the masterpiece family has
[29:13] come again
[29:14] amen christ and his bride ready to come
[29:18] the second adam second eve ready now to
[29:21] return back to their home
[29:23] and the whole picture has been
[29:25] redemption from where it was
[29:26] he meant bringing it back see just
[29:29] exactly bringing it back again
[29:31] then do you realize what happened in the
[29:32] fall in the garden he meant the fall in
[29:35] the garden actually caused
[29:37] man amen to become unconscious amen he
[29:40] was made to be superior
[29:41] the prophet god said it this way he said
[29:43] god made man superior
[29:46] to everything on the earth but the power
[29:48] was
[29:49] operated by a law and that law was the
[29:52] law
[29:52] of faith think of that adam was superior
[29:56] to nature
[29:57] he was superior to the winds are you
[29:59] hearing me he was superior to
[30:01] everything adam was superior amen man
[30:04] from the beginning which is genesis was
[30:06] made to believe god
[30:08] by faith he said but without faith it is
[30:11] impossible to please him for he that
[30:13] cometh to god
[30:14] must believe that he is and that he is a
[30:16] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[30:18] him
[30:18] there's no way for anybody to ever have
[30:21] anything from god
[30:22] except my faith and god has made that
[30:25] his way
[30:25] that was from the beginning for people
[30:30] to believe god by faith so we go all the
[30:33] way back to genesis
[30:34] where the first adam failed and we're
[30:36] the first he fell now can i
[30:37] can i dramatize something for you for a
[30:39] second can you imagine the prophet of
[30:41] god
[30:42] and then going back there and seeing
[30:43] adam amen walking through the garden of
[30:46] eden
[30:46] and he would see this big old this big
[30:48] old gray looking something
[30:50] and he would say i think i'll call that
[30:52] elephant and papa would say
[30:54] that's exactly what i was thinking then
[30:56] he would see a lion and he would say i
[30:58] think i'll call that a lion
[30:59] and papa would say that's exactly what i
[31:02] was thinking
[31:02] now think about this adam was there amen
[31:05] with jurisdiction over
[31:07] everything he could speak to the wind
[31:09] and the wind would come down
[31:11] he could speak to the stun and the sun
[31:13] would move over
[31:14] he could speak to a tree brother gideon
[31:16] and a tree would uproot
[31:18] and he would say get up from where
[31:19] you're at and go somewhere else amen and
[31:21] that tree would move
[31:22] amen and adam had jurisdiction but when
[31:25] the fall
[31:26] in the garden taken place the prophet
[31:28] said man went from being conscious of
[31:30] that authority
[31:32] to be an unconscious now can you imagine
[31:34] amen i'm not going to dramatize the
[31:36] whole thing
[31:37] amen but on that day that adam and eve
[31:39] was walking out of the garden
[31:40] amen and here they go everybody said i
[31:42] can hear those bloody
[31:43] those bloody lambskins as they're
[31:45] hitting the back of their legs
[31:46] and he says i can see papa stand up and
[31:49] scream but wait a minute
[31:50] and he said there adam and eve would
[31:52] stop and turn and he would say i
[31:55] will make a way back amen i will make
[31:57] our way back now
[31:58] you have to forgive me sometimes brother
[32:00] paul i get to thinking about things and
[32:02] i get a little dangerous okay
[32:03] but i just begin to think can you
[32:05] imagine as adam and eve walked out of
[32:07] that garden
[32:08] in that defeated condition i can only
[32:10] imagine what the trees were thinking
[32:14] cannot you say with andrew trees
[32:15] thinking well i just think they got a
[32:17] mind is that
[32:18] i can imagine the trees thinking is that
[32:20] the man
[32:21] that spoke to me and told me to move i
[32:23] can imagine the wind
[32:25] would see adam and eve walking out and
[32:27] say is that the man that spoke to me
[32:29] and told me to come down i can see the
[32:32] elephant look and say
[32:33] is that the man that named me is that
[32:35] the man is that the man the lion could
[32:37] say is that the man
[32:38] that told me to quiet down amen but i
[32:41] can also
[32:42] say this all of nature all of animal
[32:45] life
[32:45] heard father say i will make a way back
[32:49] and when man fell he lost the ability to
[32:53] speak
[32:53] amen and nature obey he lost the ability
[32:56] to speak
[32:57] he meant and trees move amen but i'll
[32:59] tell you this
[33:00] for thousands of years in the back part
[33:03] of creation's mind
[33:04] they remembered father's words i will
[33:07] make a way back
[33:08] in about 1960s in colorado
[33:12] he met a storm come up and a prophet
[33:14] stood there and said son come out
[33:16] amen and storm go back where you came
[33:18] from and something in me says i can't
[33:20] help but believe
[33:22] when the trees and the nature begin to
[33:24] hear that they said been a long time
[33:26] since we heard that voice
[33:27] amen but remember papa said he would
[33:30] restore it oh come on church
[33:32] don't you see tonight amen i'm trying
[33:34] not to put another door in this church
[33:35] right now
[33:36] amen but don't you see amen what adam
[33:38] lost
[33:39] amen what eve lost just back in the
[33:41] church tonight
[33:42] amen the authority and the jurisdiction
[33:45] of creation power
[33:46] is not just in wood it's not just in a
[33:49] pulpit
[33:50] it's back in the second eve tonight
[33:54] what was satan's attack in genesis it
[33:57] was on the faith of god
[33:58] how by presenting wisdom in genesis god
[34:02] told adam and eve
[34:03] what would happen when they disbelieved
[34:05] the word i want you to watch this
[34:07] the prophet said satan led her to
[34:10] disbelieve it
[34:11] think about that satan led her to
[34:14] disbelieve it
[34:15] for satan himself never believed in it
[34:19] think about that amen what satan was
[34:21] able
[34:22] to persuade eve to believe he himself
[34:25] doesn't believe now i got to be careful
[34:29] because i get carried away here
[34:31] amen the devil has led people a bit not
[34:34] to believe this message
[34:35] when he himself believes it amen the
[34:38] devil's led people to believe that
[34:39] william branham was not a prophet
[34:41] when the devil if you go to hell tonight
[34:43] and ask every devil down there
[34:45] you say devil do you believe william
[34:47] branham was a prophet
[34:48] amen from lucifer amen down to the
[34:50] footmen
[34:51] amen they'll all say william branham was
[34:53] a pro are you hear me
[34:55] what the devil needed was somebody to
[34:57] work through again
[34:58] and the prophet said reasoning come and
[35:01] took the place of
[35:02] faith so the fall in the garden was the
[35:04] beginning if i could say
[35:06] of the contest between wisdom and faith
[35:08] now what is a contest a contest
[35:11] is a test of strength remember the
[35:12] problem god said that the indians would
[35:14] build a fire
[35:15] and he said one group would get on this
[35:16] side and another group would get on that
[35:18] side
[35:19] and he said whoever could drag him in
[35:20] the fire one
[35:23] he said it was like a tug of war he said
[35:25] now watch satan study that
[35:27] out so perfectly so when he come to eve
[35:29] he had the best strategy
[35:31] he could use upon her and that was
[35:33] reason with the word
[35:34] he said and that's our strength is just
[35:37] accept the word
[35:38] eve began to stop and reason and when
[35:41] she quoted the word to him god said you
[35:44] should not eat thereof
[35:45] the day you eat that day we die and
[35:47] satan
[35:48] never disagreed with her
[35:52] he never disagreed with her now watch
[35:54] this he said
[35:55] certainly that's right he said oh surely
[35:58] see there you come
[35:59] surely you won't die but god said you
[36:01] would and that settles it
[36:03] and that broke the great tug of war then
[36:05] and pulled the whole human race into
[36:08] death
[36:08] because eve listened to reasoning
[36:11] against god's word
[36:12] he said god gave us our best defense
[36:15] just simply trust his word
[36:17] i want to say this god himself
[36:20] established the authority
[36:22] of simplicity of faith in the garden of
[36:24] eden
[36:25] just simply trust his word i know this
[36:27] is simple
[36:28] but i pray it help him just simply trust
[36:30] his word
[36:31] but the serpent come in and attack the
[36:34] simplicity of faith
[36:35] by offering wisdom and the prophet said
[36:37] what is satan's weapon against you is
[36:40] try to get you
[36:41] to disbelieve your weapon see and when
[36:43] you do that he disarms you
[36:45] amen hold that weapon don't you lay it
[36:48] down see
[36:49] amen you hold that weapon don't you lay
[36:51] it down the spirit of god
[36:53] actually comes into you a meant to agree
[36:55] with your weapon what is your weapon
[36:57] our weapon is the word right so the
[37:00] spirit of god he said god is known by
[37:02] simple faith
[37:03] and the very same thing god the creator
[37:06] who made
[37:06] all things and spoke the world into
[37:08] existence by his word
[37:10] that same spirit in you believes
[37:12] everything god says
[37:14] and there's nothing impossible if you
[37:16] believe it
[37:18] now you say brother andrew it can't work
[37:20] for me yes it can because
[37:22] god does not look at human prestige amen
[37:25] god does not look at who you are
[37:27] and where you come from and how much
[37:29] money is in your bank account and what
[37:30] kind of house you live in
[37:32] he don't look at that the problem of god
[37:33] said right here tonight he said there
[37:35] could be the
[37:36] governor there could be the mayor there
[37:38] could be the president
[37:39] there could be the all the most
[37:41] important businessmen in the city
[37:43] in this meeting he said they could
[37:44] everyone be sick and he said god would
[37:47] go right past them
[37:48] and honor the faith of a street walker
[37:50] he would honor the faith
[37:51] of somebody that didn't have enough
[37:53] money amen to maybe even buy something
[37:55] after church
[37:56] amen you know why because faith is not
[37:58] based upon respect of persons
[38:01] amen faith is based upon grace watch
[38:03] this
[38:04] amen now the serpent was more subtle
[38:06] than any beast to the field
[38:08] look at what this word subtle means it
[38:10] means shrewd
[38:11] it means crafty it means sly sensible
[38:14] and prudent
[38:14] then you skip down to the sixth verse
[38:16] and when the woman saw
[38:18] the tree was good for food and that it
[38:20] was pleasant to one's eyes
[38:21] and the tree to be desired to make one
[38:24] wise she took of the fruit thereof
[38:26] and did eat and gave also under her
[38:28] husband with her and he did eat
[38:29] now that word wise actually means to be
[38:32] prudent
[38:32] amen i'm going somewhere wisely
[38:35] understood
[38:35] to have insight or to have success now
[38:38] there's nobody in here tonight that if
[38:40] somebody come to you and say do you want
[38:41] to be successful
[38:42] you'd say no every because there was a
[38:45] it's in first 1965
[38:47] he said there's a thirst in everybody's
[38:49] heart for success
[38:50] he said but satan gets a hold of that
[38:52] thirst and he perverts that thirst and
[38:55] he changes it
[38:56] amen to where you're thirsting for
[38:57] success but you're thirsting by a
[38:59] perverted thirst
[39:00] so that's what satan did he prefer
[39:03] perverted the thirst
[39:04] amen in humanity for success in other
[39:07] words
[39:08] you really want to be right with god
[39:10] take my advice and listen to me
[39:12] he said did you hear that that's the
[39:14] hiss of the serpent
[39:15] amen that's the hiss of the serpent
[39:17] satan presenting knowledge
[39:20] now in genesis 3 i'll say it like this
[39:23] was the beginning if we said
[39:24] of the contest between wisdom and faith
[39:27] now do you realize there's only two
[39:28] sources we can draw our life from
[39:30] amen one of them is faith and the other
[39:33] one is wisdom
[39:34] he said see if we think of what wisdom
[39:35] produces and then what faith produces
[39:38] but those two sources we're going back
[39:40] this morning to show you bringing them
[39:41] up out of the bible
[39:43] show what they are what they're going to
[39:45] do and what they have done by the help
[39:47] of the lord
[39:47] he said now faith and wisdom now to
[39:49] begin with we'll notice
[39:51] in genesis the first chapter we find
[39:54] that faith was introduced
[39:55] we have now found amen the beginning of
[39:58] where faith was introduced was in
[40:00] genesis the first chapter
[40:01] he said and wisdom was introduced and
[40:04] today them two sources
[40:05] is still introduced to the human race we
[40:08] find out that god was the author of
[40:10] faith
[40:10] to believe for the people to believe in
[40:12] the trust his word
[40:14] and satan is the author of wisdom trying
[40:17] to get people away to accept his wisdom
[40:19] now say this with me and pull them
[40:23] are you awake and pull them and pull
[40:26] them away from the faith
[40:28] that is in god's word now that is amen
[40:31] that's a
[40:31] it may not sound like one but it's a
[40:33] shouting point amen you have now
[40:35] found where a lot of your troubles are
[40:36] coming from amen the devil is trying to
[40:39] pull you
[40:40] away from the faith that is in god's
[40:42] word because he knows what happened when
[40:44] he did it to the first eve
[40:46] he knows when he finally convinced her
[40:48] amen to leave the word
[40:50] he was able to pull her and the whole
[40:52] human race under his jurisdiction
[40:54] and the devil is after every believer in
[40:56] this building tonight
[40:58] amen but i want to say this we are in
[41:00] amen the final round of the great
[41:02] contest
[41:03] between wisdom and faith can you say man
[41:05] amen it's a battle
[41:06] it's a struggle but we're in the final
[41:08] round amen i know coven stuff's going on
[41:11] you can't really shake hands and stuff
[41:12] but look at somebody next to you and say
[41:14] we're in the final round
[41:15] hey we're in the final round brother

[41:21] throw up your hands and quit
[41:23] we're in the final round brother paul

[41:26] lot longer than i have

[41:29] elder can i salute you

[41:42] and say i don't know where to turn and
[41:43] where to go i'm telling you the time has
[41:46] come
[41:46] i know lukewarmness is striking churches
[41:49] i know pulpits are getting weaker
[41:51] i know people's losing their desire i
[41:53] know there's atomic rumors in the air
[41:55] i know there's wars and rumors of wars i
[41:58] know that paul i cannot preach it
[42:00] i know that men's hearts amen are
[42:02] failing for fear
[42:03] i'm telling you the time has come for
[42:04] that amen but gideon the time has also
[42:07] come
[42:08] amen for jesus to come who is jesus
[42:10] christ he is the second adam
[42:12] and my bible says he shall appear amen
[42:15] the second
[42:16] time amen without sin unto salvation
[42:19] what are you saying i'm saying if you
[42:21] keep on running you're going to cross
[42:22] the finish line
[42:24] i'm saying if you keep on swinging the
[42:25] sword the devil's going to come down
[42:27] if you keep on marching jericho and then
[42:30] the walls are going to fall
[42:32] we are not here ain't meant to lay down
[42:34] and quit we are here to cross the finish
[42:36] line
[42:37] there is an anointing resting upon you
[42:39] by the power of prophecy
[42:41] some are departing some are turning away
[42:44] but there's some contending
[42:47] glory to god i feel like putting my
[42:49] shouting shoes on
[42:51] there's some departing and i can't help
[42:53] it but there's some contending
[42:55] you know what i'm going to do i'm not
[42:57] going to waste my time on the ones
[42:59] departing
[43:00] i'm not going to worry about what
[43:01] they're saying and what they're doing
[43:02] there's some contenders
[43:04] that need to hear the word there's some
[43:06] contenders
[43:07] that need to know that god is still god
[43:10] and his word is still his word
[43:12] the mighty shout we're here we've
[43:15] arrived
[43:16] you say what are you so happy about the
[43:18] time has come
[43:19] for jesus to come the time has come
[43:23] for the judge of this contest amen to
[43:26] descend from glory
[43:27] and my prophet said he'll not put foot
[43:29] upon land
[43:30] he said we'll meet him in the air
[43:35] oh help me jesus it's a wednesday night
[43:37] and i feel like shouting
[43:38] amen i find it amazing amen that right
[43:40] here in genesis 3
[43:42] it i find the amazing parallel between
[43:44] genesis 3
[43:45] and 2nd corinthians 11. you say what are
[43:48] you talking about
[43:49] after the fall in the garden you know as
[43:51] well as i know the woman receives her
[43:53] own identity
[43:54] after the fall she goes from being
[43:56] adam's wife a meant to be an eve am i
[43:58] holding too long
[43:59] she goes for me an adam's wife amen to
[44:01] be an eve now watch this if you got a
[44:03] thompson chain
[44:04] you know that you can run the chain on
[44:06] the name eve now watch
[44:08] amen in genesis 3 20 and adam called his
[44:11] wife's name eve
[44:12] because she was the mother of all living
[44:15] first time eve is mentioned is genesis 3
[44:17] 20 with a name with an identity of her
[44:19] own then you come to genesis 4 1
[44:22] and adam knew eve his wife amen there's
[44:24] the second place
[44:25] and she conceived and bear cain and said
[44:27] i've gotten a man from the lord do you
[44:29] realize from genesis 4 1
[44:31] you don't find the name eve mentioned
[44:33] again
[44:35] until ii corinthians 11
[44:38] when the bible says that paul is moved
[44:41] amen to write a warning that what
[44:44] happened in the natural
[44:45] can happen in the spiritual what
[44:47] happened in the first garden of eden
[44:49] he's warning you
[44:51] can happen in the second amen but here's
[44:53] the thing about it
[44:55] amen there is a second eve whose mind
[44:58] has not been corrupted he meant her womb
[45:01] has not been corrupted
[45:02] what does the bible say but i fear lest
[45:04] by any means does the serpent be godly
[45:06] through his subtlety
[45:07] sow your minds are you i'm tying this
[45:10] together so your minds what did paul say
[45:12] that you be not soon shaken where in
[45:14] your mind
[45:15] amen see that your mind should be
[45:17] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[45:19] christ
[45:20] look at this word corrupted it means to
[45:22] lead away
[45:23] a christian church from the state of
[45:25] knowledge and holiness
[45:26] in which it ought to abide and the
[45:28] prophet said now there is a womb with a
[45:29] physical
[45:30] and there is a womb of the spirit and
[45:32] the mind is the womb to the spirit
[45:35] how is adultery committed spiritually
[45:37] when knowing better by the word of god
[45:39] he says the intercourse of the mind
[45:40] taking the lie of the devil against the
[45:42] word of god
[45:44] and when the bride of jesus christ lets
[45:46] man-made creeds
[45:47] and dogmas take the place of the word of
[45:49] god she
[45:50] is committing adultery he said why she
[45:53] let it come into his
[45:55] mind he said notice here what he failed
[45:58] to do
[45:59] mary did she took the word amen eve took
[46:02] satan's lie
[46:03] and mary took sex took god's word so
[46:05] satan was able by wisdom
[46:07] and reasoning to begin and lead the
[46:10] human race
[46:11] amen from living by the faith he meant
[46:14] to living by knowledge
[46:15] and living by wisdom and reasoning in
[46:17] science amen and wisdom comes from the
[46:20] devil
[46:20] amen wisdom of the devil comes from
[46:22] below but according to james 3
[46:24] amen wisdom from above is first pure
[46:27] then peaceable
[46:28] then gentle and easy to be entreated
[46:29] full of mercy good fruits without
[46:31] partiality
[46:32] and without hypocrisy notice this there
[46:35] is a wisdom of god
[46:36] and a wisdom of god is stay with his
[46:38] word now remember what the prophet said
[46:41] he said a lie is only the truth mistold
[46:43] think about this
[46:44] satan by a lie was able to pull the
[46:48] entire
[46:49] human race amen through eve from
[46:51] following the faith
[46:53] amen but see before you can believe a
[46:55] lie you've got to deny the truth
[46:57] now watch this so paul is writing to
[47:00] timothy in 1st timothy 4 1
[47:02] and he's showing you amen the same
[47:04] example brother kenny
[47:05] amen that's in genesis 3 he's using in
[47:08] second or first timothy four
[47:10] now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[47:12] in the latter times some shall depart
[47:14] from the faith
[47:14] giving heed the seducing spirits look at
[47:17] this word seducing
[47:18] it means to lead into error amen satan
[47:21] the seducer
[47:23] led eve into air and by claiming her
[47:25] womb
[47:26] he led the entire human race into error
[47:28] he meant by speaking lies in hypocrisy
[47:31] in the second seal seduces what seducing
[47:34] spirit in the church
[47:35] he said that's a clergy spirit
[47:38] workings of devils hypocrisy in the
[47:40] church heady high-minded
[47:42] he said see having a form of godliness
[47:44] but denying the revelation
[47:46] the power and the working of the spirit
[47:48] from such
[47:49] amen turn away notice this it's a strong
[47:52] warning
[47:53] amen from such you turn away in the
[47:56] ephesian church age
[47:57] he said here's where he received the
[47:58] true revelation the serpent seed here's
[48:00] what really happened
[48:01] the word says eve was beguiled by the
[48:03] serpent she was
[48:04] actually seduced by the serpent the
[48:07] serpent led eve
[48:08] into error watch this now right here
[48:11] someone's going to question me
[48:12] did god tell eve to watch out for the
[48:14] serpent or the serpent would seduce her
[48:16] god didn't have to say one thing about
[48:18] it he said just point out the story
[48:20] he simply gave the word he said not to
[48:23] partake of the knowledge
[48:24] partake of life and life was the word of
[48:26] god and
[48:27] death was anything that wasn't the word
[48:30] of god she allowed one word to be
[48:32] changed
[48:32] and right then satan had her god could
[48:35] have said
[48:36] don't pick more fruit off the tree then
[48:38] you can eat satan could say look that is
[48:39] quite right
[48:40] you see if you pick too much of the rod
[48:42] but here is a method of preserving the
[48:44] fruit
[48:44] and yet the same time you can pick all
[48:46] you want so you see
[48:47] you can have your way in god's way at
[48:49] the same time and the devil would have
[48:51] had her right there
[48:52] he that is guilty in one point of the
[48:54] law has broken the whole law
[48:56] don't you fool with that word are you
[48:58] hearing me tonight
[49:00] amen that same spirit come over in the
[49:01] book of revelation
[49:03] that same seducing spirit was what came
[49:05] upon jezebel
[49:06] amen to seduce the servants of god and
[49:08] to commit fornication
[49:10] and you know what god as far as it did
[49:12] hey because the bible said
[49:13] i have a few things because thou
[49:15] sufferest amen or tolerate that woman
[49:18] jezebel
[49:18] what are you saying preacher i'm saying
[49:20] this at the very siding
[49:22] amen of the seducing spirit is the time
[49:25] to stand up and draw a sword you say but
[49:27] then i don't know why brother paul's all
[49:28] the time hitting at this
[49:30] amen he's fine he's not fighting he's
[49:32] fighting spirits
[49:33] amen as a preacher you stand behind this
[49:35] pulpit and you're looking in a spiritual
[49:37] realm
[49:37] and you're seeing spirits swarming amen
[49:39] you're seeing demons coming
[49:41] i say tonight oh can i preach a minute
[49:43] here amen if any of you fathers go home
[49:45] tonight and you smell gas
[49:47] you know what you'll do you'll tear that
[49:49] house upside down
[49:50] you'll trace it down amen you'll crawl
[49:52] under the house
[49:53] you'll crawl through the attic until you
[49:55] find where that gas is leaking
[49:57] because you know if it keeps on leaking
[49:59] it's going to blow apart
[50:00] and it'll blow your family apart and i
[50:03] say tonight i think it's time

[54:44] say something
[54:45] he would only see what god put in his
[54:47] mouth and i say that same word
[54:49] has now come into the bride and the same
[54:51] voice and spoke to the bridegroom

[55:07] anointing that fell upon joel

[55:11] and the caterpillar locus and canker
[55:13] there was a spirit fell and said i will
[55:16] restore
[55:17] and i say there's some people here
[55:18] tonight the devil's done everything he
[55:20] could to eat off of this tree
[55:21] but there's an anointing behind us
[55:23] tonight and we're saying satan

[55:40] behind this message
[55:41] saying satan we're not going to tolerate
[55:43] you
[55:45] are you hearing me amen we're not going
[55:47] we're going to continue in these things
[55:49] and we're going to continue in this
[55:51] message i'm going to just say lord i'm
[55:52] going to continue in the things
[55:54] which i've learned i am assured of the
[55:57] things which i believe
[55:58] amen the bible goes on to say they'll
[56:00] become reprobates amen depart from the
[56:02] faith
[56:03] and become reprobates concerning the
[56:05] faith
[56:06] but i want to leave you fish in second
[56:08] corinthians 13 verse 5
[56:10] examine yourselves isn't that something
[56:13] in a day when everybody's right paul
[56:15] says examine yourselves whether you be
[56:17] in the faith
[56:18] prove your own selves know ye not your
[56:20] own selves how that jesus christ is in
[56:22] you
[56:23] except you be reprobates it's like a
[56:25] timothy 3 8 now it's janice and timbers
[56:27] withstood moses
[56:28] so do these who resist the truth men of
[56:30] corrupt minds
[56:31] they are reprobates brother well they
[56:35] reprobates about concerning the faith
[56:38] somebody say the faith remember says
[56:42] concerning the faith and connection to
[56:43] malachi 4. wow imagine that
[56:47] i know the devil chokes at that one but
[56:48] i'm going to preach it anyhow rapper
[56:50] bait concerning the faith uh
[56:52] he said you know what reprobate means
[56:53] says apostasy see right here in apostasy
[56:56] what is that
[56:57] notice this is to turn away rap
[56:59] probate's concerning the truth
[57:01] and the only one truth that i know is
[57:03] the bible
[57:07] i tell you that he will avenge him
[57:08] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[57:09] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[57:11] earth
[57:12] the bible says now that's the question
[57:13] remember i said now that's the question
[57:14] here's where i want to go revelation 10.
[57:16] here's a question
[57:17] if you follow in that line in this hour
[57:19] will it be finished
[57:21] notice this question will i find the
[57:24] faith
[57:26] will malachi 4 be fulfilled at this time
[57:29] restore the faith of the children back
[57:32] to the fathers
[57:33] the original the word paul tells timothy
[57:36] in first timothy 6 20 oh timothy
[57:38] keep that which is committed to the
[57:39] trust avoid profane and vain balance
[57:43] avoid them avoid them
[57:47] and oppositions of scientists falsely
[57:50] so-called
[57:50] which some professing have aired
[57:53] concerning the faith
[57:56] and this is what i love grace
[57:59] be with thee he
[58:03] brother getting he strongly tells him
[58:05] avoid it
[58:07] and then says grace be with thee
[58:14] superlander what are you getting that
[58:15] well here's what i'm getting at
[58:17] some were ordained to depart
[58:23] but some were ordained to contend
[58:29] you say so you're saying some are
[58:30] ordained to argue no
[58:33] because i've come to this conclusion you
[58:35] can argue with the departers until you
[58:37] get
[58:37] arthritis in your fingers by typing on
[58:40] text
[58:41] and facebook messages and emails i mean
[58:44] literally
[58:44] you can share you can get arthritis in
[58:48] your fingers arguing with and you know
[58:49] what at the end of the day
[58:50] this is the conclusion i've come to
[58:52] you're not going to change them
[58:55] but you want to hear the other side of
[58:56] that conclusion they ain't going to
[58:58] change us
[58:58] either so i'm not going to change them
[59:02] and they're not going to change me so
[59:03] they do what they want to do and i'll
[59:04] keep preaching the message is that okay
[59:07] i see i can't help it i was ordained to
[59:09] this i i did
[59:10] i didn't choose this god chose this we
[59:12] were i mean you didn't choose this
[59:14] message you was ordained to believe it
[59:15] that's why jude says
[59:16] when i give all diligence to write unto
[59:18] you and the common salvation it was
[59:19] needful for me to write a new that
[59:21] exhorts you
[59:22] that you should earnestly contend for
[59:23] the faith which was once delivered to
[59:25] the saints
[59:26] for there are certain men which program
[59:27] says are not saints have crept in
[59:29] unawares
[59:30] he said which means they've come in the
[59:32] fold by means
[59:33] they've not come in the fold by the
[59:34] means of the door and are therefore
[59:36] robbers
[59:38] who were before of old ordained to this
[59:41] condemnation
[59:42] ungodly men turning the grace of our
[59:45] lord god in tootles cheviousness
[59:47] and denying the only lord god in our
[59:49] lord jesus christ
[59:51] watch same words paul uses avoid it but
[59:53] then he says
[59:54] grace be upon you amen see there's a
[59:56] grace upon you brother
[59:58] there's a grace upon the contenders and
[1:00:00] i close with this quote
[1:00:01] he said now if he will represent himself
[1:00:04] how many in here will say
[1:00:06] if he will do it will say by god i'll
[1:00:09] raise my hands
[1:00:10] i'll never have another doubt in my life
[1:00:13] so help me
[1:00:14] lord jesus if you'll come and confirm
[1:00:16] what the preacher
[1:00:17] said tonight to be the truth and what
[1:00:20] your bible says it is i'll promise you
[1:00:22] i'll never doubt no more will you raise
[1:00:25] your hand
[1:00:25] that and say i'll never doubt no more in
[1:00:28] my life
[1:00:29] he said god bless you now watch this
[1:00:31] amen i just want to stop here and ask
[1:00:32] this church
[1:00:33] is there anybody can raise your hand and
[1:00:35] say i'll never doubt no more
[1:00:37] i'll never doubt i may have had it out
[1:00:39] but i'll never doubt no more
[1:00:40] everyone says and god bless you he said
[1:00:43] now notice this
[1:00:44] why was it now i'm not i'm using this
[1:00:46] quote okay i'm not bringing it here in a
[1:00:47] way i am but i want you to understand
[1:00:49] what i'm saying
[1:00:49] he said why was it some of you kept your
[1:00:52] hands down now in case you're wondering
[1:00:53] i didn't see any hands down in here okay
[1:00:55] so i'm going to use the quote why was it
[1:00:57] some of you kept your hands down
[1:00:59] he said the one would raise from the
[1:01:01] deadhead yet would you not believe
[1:01:03] that's what jesus said in luke 16 he
[1:01:05] said yes no matter what would take place
[1:01:08] there is people in the world that were
[1:01:10] born not to believe
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:12] there were people in the world born not
[1:01:14] to believe and the bible said they were
[1:01:16] ordained of old to this condemnation
[1:01:18] jude men of old ordained this
[1:01:20] condemnation not to believe
[1:01:21] no matter what what the what you do they
[1:01:23] wouldn't believe anyhow they were raised
[1:01:25] up for this same purpose

[1:01:39] can raise my hand
[1:01:40] amen the bible says in the last days
[1:01:42] amen that hearts will become hard
[1:01:44] amen that lovers of of pleasure more
[1:01:46] than lovers of god
[1:01:47] in the book of matthew it says amen that
[1:01:50] hearts would wax gross
[1:01:51] and ears would be dull of hearing and
[1:01:53] eyes would be closed
[1:01:55] amen but i say tonight and i'm done lord
[1:01:57] don't ever let my heart turn from
[1:01:59] calvary
[1:02:00] amen no matter how much i know no matter

[1:02:25] know what sometimes contenders can do
[1:02:26] they can become hard
[1:02:29] sometimes you get so you get so hard in
[1:02:31] your spirit because you're contending
[1:02:33] for something you're
[1:02:34] you're standing for something and
[1:02:35] there's a resistance gonna be there
[1:02:37] amen let me say this don't ever forget
[1:02:40] amen it's only because of grace that
[1:02:41] we're contending

[1:02:45] the blood
[1:02:46] of jesus christ that we're able to stand
[1:02:48] here tonight
[1:02:49] with a heart full of faith with eyes
[1:02:51] open to see
[1:02:52] and ears open to hear and a heart with
[1:02:55] eyes to believe

[1:03:41] last days malachi 4 giving the sign to
[1:03:44] the days of lot

[1:05:10] me somewhere
[1:05:11] ways from here but he told me he said
[1:05:12] but andrew he said i just about the
[1:05:13] other day lost my entire family
[1:05:15] i said what do you mean brother he said

[1:05:29] so they've been feeding on this guy's
[1:05:30] videos about how false the message is
[1:05:32] and how wrong it is and he said andrew i
[1:05:33] noticed there was something
[1:05:34] really weird in our house he said it was
[1:05:36] just a just a really weird feeling for
[1:05:38] about two weeks and i thought what in
[1:05:39] the world is it

[1:05:44] he said it about destroyed my entire
[1:05:46] family
[1:05:48] i said brother that's what paul said
[1:05:51] seducing spirits
[1:05:54] they ain't got backbone enough to come
[1:05:55] in through the front door

[1:06:12] rob the joy out of families
[1:06:16] the church these things must need to be
[1:06:20] but there's a prophecy hanging over you
[1:06:22] to contend
[1:06:24] for the faith won't you once you rest
[1:06:26] yourself to your feet this evening
[1:06:28] she's staying together
[1:06:32] if i could leave you with any scriptures
[1:06:34] tonight it'd be this in caution 123
[1:06:37] if you continue in the faith grounded
[1:06:39] and settled
[1:06:41] and be not moved away from the hope of
[1:06:42] the gospel which you have heard and
[1:06:44] which was preached to every
[1:06:46] creature which is under heaven wherefore
[1:06:48] i paul have made a ministry
[1:06:50] colossians 2 7 rooted and built up in
[1:06:53] him and established
[1:06:54] in that good established in the faith
[1:06:58] as ye have been taught abounding therian
[1:07:01] with thanksgiving
[1:07:02] but beware lest any man spoil you
[1:07:05] through philosophy and vain deceit
[1:07:07] after the traditions of men and after
[1:07:09] the rudiments of the world
[1:07:11] and not after christ
[1:07:16] this message tonight is christ
[1:07:22] you know what's amazing right now with
[1:07:23] this cold stuff going on everybody's
[1:07:27] this would be a really good time brother
[1:07:28] paul to be in the vitamin business
[1:07:31] because everybody's buying vitamins
[1:07:33] vitamins vitamins
[1:07:35] probably gone actually said the devil's
[1:07:36] got some vitamins
[1:07:38] he said he's got the vitamin p for
[1:07:40] pleasure and popularity
[1:07:42] vitamin c for common sense vitamin r
[1:07:45] for reasoning vitamin b for beauty
[1:07:48] vitamin m which is for modern
[1:07:53] he said but there's one vitamin that he
[1:07:54] failed to tell you in that
[1:07:57] he had the vitamin d in there that's the
[1:07:59] biggest one of them all he said the
[1:08:01] results is death
[1:08:04] eve took vitamin b for beauty and
[1:08:07] vitamin m for modern
[1:08:09] vitamin c for common sense vitamin
[1:08:13] p for popularity and pleasure
[1:08:16] and it all headed up in vitamin d
[1:08:20] for death but this second eve is on
[1:08:24] one vitamin and the prophet said it's
[1:08:25] vitamin hell which is life
[1:08:29] this word is life you love him tonight
[1:08:33] this word faith only knows one thing and
[1:08:36] that is life
[1:08:38] oh i don't know i don't know maybe what
[1:08:41] your desires or maybe what you've been
[1:08:42] praying about lately
[1:08:44] but this has just been my heart's cry
[1:08:46] god
[1:08:47] keep me true keep me
[1:08:50] keep me rooted and grounded
[1:08:54] settled established
[1:08:58] in the faith
[1:09:01] not a man's faith because if a man falls
[1:09:04] and your faith falls with the man
[1:09:06] but in the faith which is christ let's
[1:09:09] put our hearts together this evening
[1:09:12] approaching tonight i don't believe i've
[1:09:15] been preaching to departers tonight by
[1:09:17] no means
[1:09:20] i believe i've been preaching to
[1:09:21] contenders tonight
[1:09:24] as i said some time ago and studying and
[1:09:28] i was actually preaching the series
[1:09:29] there at home on the simplicity
[1:09:32] simplicity of faith simplicity of the
[1:09:33] gospel simplicity of the word and how
[1:09:36] god is hidden in simplicity reveals
[1:09:38] himself
[1:09:39] and i come across this scripture second
[1:09:42] corinthians 11
[1:09:44] where paul says i fear
[1:09:47] as the serpent beguiled eve he would
[1:09:50] begow
[1:09:51] the minds and i thought lord
[1:09:56] why would paul place that right here
[1:10:02] i believe he's showing us something
[1:10:03] church
[1:10:05] that that eve's name would not be
[1:10:07] mentioned again from genesis 4 1
[1:10:10] all the way to corinthians and paul
[1:10:12] would be writing a warning that what
[1:10:14] happened in genesis
[1:10:16] will happen again in the end time
[1:10:20] but this time there will be a second eve
[1:10:23] on the earth
[1:10:24] whose wound is sealed
[1:10:28] who was born to believe who was born to
[1:10:31] contend
[1:10:33] who is established and rooted and
[1:10:34] grounded in the faith
[1:10:37] all church i believe that's us tonight
[1:10:40] would there be anybody here could you
[1:10:41] say lord give me the strength to
[1:10:43] continue to contend
[1:10:46] not to argue just to contend
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:50] brother ever said i'm not for oregon
[1:10:53] he said content means to hold fast
[1:10:56] wholeheartedly
[1:10:58] brother andrew i'm a sister i'm not a
[1:10:59] preacher i'm not contending oh yes you
[1:11:01] are
[1:11:03] walking through walmart going to school
[1:11:05] and
[1:11:06] raising your kids and witnessing the
[1:11:08] people in front of this ungodly
[1:11:10] generation holy ghost-filled women in
[1:11:11] this message
[1:11:14] witnessing the power of god to this
[1:11:15] world you're contending against satan's
[1:11:18] lie
[1:11:19] you you fathers and husbands and men
[1:11:22] here young boys
[1:11:24] living this message every day
[1:11:27] you're contending for the faith
[1:11:32] heavenly father lord all across this
[1:11:35] field and tonight as believers lord
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:38] father i believe i'm standing before the
[1:11:41] purchase of your blood tonight
[1:11:44] sons and daughters that have been bought
[1:11:46] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:11:48] have been redeemed by a price lord i
[1:11:51] believe i'm standing before people
[1:11:53] tonight that are sealed
[1:11:55] lord they're not sealed until the next
[1:11:57] convention or they're not sealed until
[1:11:59] the next youth meeting they're not
[1:12:00] sealed until the next church service
[1:12:03] but lord i believe there are some
[1:12:04] contenders standing before me tonight
[1:12:07] that is sealed
[1:12:08] until the day of their redemption there
[1:12:11] is nothing the devil can do
[1:12:13] to break that seal upon that soul
[1:12:16] father i pray tonight lord as we as we
[1:12:19] see this prophetic time we're living in
[1:12:21] when you would send malachi 4 to to
[1:12:24] scream out to us the time has come for
[1:12:26] atomic age the time has come
[1:12:28] for the falling away the time has come
[1:12:30] for seducing spirits
[1:12:31] the time has come for men speaking
[1:12:33] hypocrisy
[1:12:34] and false doctrines and the time has
[1:12:36] come for these things
[1:12:38] but he would stand there and scream out
[1:12:39] but the time has come for jesus to come
[1:12:43] lord i believe there's some people here
[1:12:45] tonight that has not been gathered into
[1:12:46] a man
[1:12:48] they've not been gathered into a church
[1:12:49] or gathered into a personality
[1:12:52] but lord your prophet paul stood and
[1:12:53] told us we have been gathered together
[1:12:56] unto christ
[1:12:57] and lord i am not ashamed tonight to be
[1:12:59] identified in that number
[1:13:01] i raised my hand before you tonight lord
[1:13:03] and i want to say thank you father
[1:13:06] lord there was nothing i could do to
[1:13:07] earn this faith there was nothing i
[1:13:09] could do to earn this place for this
[1:13:11] grace that you've given my life
[1:13:13] lord but your favor and your mercy look
[1:13:15] beyond all of our faults and failures
[1:13:18] and you placed a seat of life inside of
[1:13:20] our hearts that in these last days
[1:13:22] when the others would be departing when
[1:13:24] they would when they would be seducing
[1:13:26] spirits leading churches and families
[1:13:28] and
[1:13:28] young people away and trying to rob and
[1:13:30] destroy you
[1:13:32] sent a word with a word of restoration
[1:13:34] that would say satan which is stolen

[1:13:37] and tonight father i stand here as one
[1:13:39] of your sons
