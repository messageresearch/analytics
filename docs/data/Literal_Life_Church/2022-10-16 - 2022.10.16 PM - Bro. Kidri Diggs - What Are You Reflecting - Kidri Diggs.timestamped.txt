[1:33] Christ we pray that Trace amen
[1:36] amen by God's grace Hallelujah if you
[1:39] have your Bibles let's go to Genesis
[1:40] chapter one
[1:42] and
[1:43] uh
[1:45] we're gonna move kind of quick tonight
[1:48] when I say quick I just want to get
[1:49] through these scriptures and let the
[1:51] Lord lead as he will
[1:53] amen Genesis chapter 1
[1:59] the Bible says Genesis chapter 1 verse
[2:01] 26. familiar verse of scriptures
[2:06] the Bible says and God said let us make
[2:09] man in our image
[2:11] after our likeness
[2:13] and let them have dominion over the fish
[2:16] of the sea and over the fowls of the air
[2:19] and over the cattle and over the Earth
[2:22] and over every creeping thing that
[2:25] creepeth upon the Earth
[2:27] so God created man in his own image
[2:31] in the image of God created he him male
[2:36] and female
[2:37] let's go to second Samuel chapter 12.
[2:50] second Samuel 12 and
[2:52] uh let's just read verse 13.
[2:55] we'll try to come back to this let's
[2:58] just read verse 13.
[3:01] the Bible says and David said unto
[3:04] Nathan I have sinned against the Lord
[3:06] and Nathan said unto David the Lord also
[3:10] hath put away thy sin thou shall not die
[3:15] amen for last verse let's go to Proverbs
[3:17] chapter 14.
[3:24] proverbs
[3:26] 14.
[3:32] and we want verse
[3:34] 12.
[3:37] proverbs 14. verse 12. and the Bible
[3:43] says there is a way which seemeth right
[3:45] unto a man but the end thereof are the
[3:50] ways of death
[3:52] amen may the Lord have blessed me of his
[3:54] word you can have your seats
[3:58] amen and if I can quote our scripture as
[4:00] you're sitting Corinthians uh chapter 1
[4:03] verse 13 I mean chapter 13 verse 12 it
[4:07] says for we know
[4:09] for for now we see through a glass
[4:12] Darkly
[4:13] but then face to face
[4:15] no now I know in part but then shall I
[4:20] know even as also I am Hallelujah
[4:25] amen and by the grace of God tonight I I
[4:28] we know it's a Tri-State youth meeting
[4:30] but I want to use for a subject what are
[4:33] you reflecting
[4:34] what are you reflecting but I I don't
[4:39] want to make this service
[4:41] a tear down of your faults
[4:45] I don't want to make this service a tear
[4:47] down of the things you're going through
[4:50] but I want you to be able to see tonight
[4:52] that you're supposed to reflect the
[4:55] image of God
[4:57] as a young person you know we have
[4:59] trials we have tribulations we have a
[5:01] lot of things we go through as we're
[5:03] growing in Christ but in all that I want
[5:05] you to understand
[5:07] God's thoughts and the way God sees you
[5:09] is in his own reflection Hallelujah
[5:13] that's your end goal that's your
[5:14] beginning goal that's the way it is
[5:16] hallelujah because he says in the
[5:19] beginning Hallelujah God created man in
[5:21] His image and in his likeness Hallelujah
[5:23] that's how God created us so our whole
[5:27] goal our whole job is to reflect that
[5:30] Hallelujah as young people we want to
[5:32] reflect the image of God the reflection
[5:35] of God but now you have to ask yourself
[5:37] why you're living here on this Earth
[5:39] what are you reflecting amen what do you
[5:43] see Hallelujah when it comes to your
[5:45] life what do you see when it comes to
[5:47] your desires what do you see when it
[5:50] comes to the things that you want to
[5:51] accomplish on this Earth what are you
[5:53] reflecting
[5:54] and I want you to understand that
[5:56] tonight by the grace of God I'm not
[5:59] talking about your outward appearance
[6:04] I'm not talking about this reflection
[6:06] right here
[6:07] because your flesh can say one thing and
[6:10] your inward person can say something
[6:12] different
[6:13] I know when I was a young person my
[6:15] outward appearance said it looked like
[6:18] I'd never be a son of God
[6:20] because I look like the world I dress
[6:22] like the world and all these things
[6:23] spoke of the world but my inward man
[6:26] said one day I'm going to be a son of
[6:29] God
[6:30] one day I'm going to reflect Hallelujah
[6:32] this true divine gospel that was my
[6:35] harsh desire all do I had on Nikes and
[6:38] gold chains
[6:41] but by inward man Hallelujah was
[6:43] reflecting something greater and let me
[6:46] tell you something young people the
[6:48] devil doesn't know what's in your heart
[6:51] Hallelujah he doesn't know your true
[6:54] desires Hallelujah so what he does is he
[6:57] studies you and he puts these before you
[6:59] to try to find out who you really are
[7:02] but whether you like it or not
[7:04] whatever's on the inside is going to
[7:06] come out Hallelujah no matter how good
[7:09] you look in church no matter how you
[7:12] dress yourself up and get you get your
[7:13] hair right and all these things and the
[7:15] reflection look good but if it doesn't
[7:17] match this word the outside doesn't mean
[7:20] anything
[7:22] and I think sometimes we spend so much
[7:25] time wasted on our natural image
[7:29] our natural reflection hallelujah what
[7:32] do people see when I post on Instagram
[7:34] what do people see when I post on
[7:37] Twitter what do people see when I put it
[7:39] on Snapchat
[7:43] it's all about image and self-image and
[7:45] what am I reflecting we want to reflect
[7:48] Christ
[7:51] and I want you to understand Hallelujah
[7:53] that's who you are
[7:55] so don't be satisfied with just a good
[7:58] outward appearance
[8:00] yeah as young people we got those things
[8:03] down pat
[8:04] El you sisters know not to come to
[8:07] church with pants on but what about if
[8:09] you got a desire for it
[8:13] that's the real reflection
[8:15] that's what's going on in the inside
[8:17] so although you don't put it on and you
[8:19] have a real hunger and desire for it you
[8:22] might as well say I'm stepping into it
[8:25] but there's a thing about Temptation
[8:27] Hallelujah the Bible says that God will
[8:30] not tip you above what you're able to be
[8:32] tempted
[8:34] Hallelujah and with every Temptation
[8:36] he's made a way of Escape Hallelujah so
[8:40] I'm saying to you tonight no matter what
[8:42] condition you're in the condition you're
[8:45] really supposed to be in is Genesis 1
[8:47] 26. Hallelujah in the likeness and image
[8:52] of God
[8:54] you see everybody I got this far I got
[8:56] that fault that does not change what God
[8:59] sees
[9:01] Hallelujah he's not dealing with
[9:03] hallelujah what you can project on the
[9:06] outside
[9:07] well he's worried about Hallelujah is
[9:09] that true life on the inside coming
[9:12] forward
[9:13] but what we have to do is stop worrying
[9:16] about how people perceive us
[9:26] yo you think you got it all wrapped up
[9:29] you'll get a little conceited sometimes
[9:32] and you think you look good but on the
[9:34] inside you're really nasty
[9:36] really dirty
[9:38] and you're no good to any of us in that
[9:40] condition
[9:41] because if there's a life inside we want
[9:44] fruit Hallelujah
[9:46] amen and I think the young people you
[9:48] people all of us we waste so much time
[9:51] earlier what about image
[9:54] worldly image
[9:56] when God has already set the standard
[9:58] the standard is catch this young people
[10:01] the standard is you're supposed to be a
[10:04] god
[10:08] that's kind of strong for the young
[10:10] people well let's say it like this when
[10:12] you get to heaven you're not going to
[10:13] stand there and get in when you get to
[10:15] heaven you're not going to stand there
[10:17] as the son of Paul LaFontaine you're
[10:19] going to stand there as a son of God
[10:22] [Applause]
[10:24] Hallelujah
[10:26] amen you Sisters You Brothers you're not
[10:28] going to stand there with whatever your
[10:30] last name is you're going to be judged
[10:32] as a son or a daughter
[10:35] Hallelujah you know when you get to
[10:37] heaven it's not about you carrying the
[10:40] family name you're either bride or not
[10:42] bride
[10:46] Hallelujah
[10:47] and we put so much pressure on one
[10:49] another
[10:50] trying to uphold that image
[10:52] all right now remember Gabby you're a
[10:55] LaFontaine
[10:56] don't do that
[11:05] image
[11:09] reflection
[11:11] what are you reflecting
[11:14] what is
[11:15] the real you saying to us tonight
[11:18] holy because you know if you take a
[11:21] church right now
[11:22] and you know some of you may not even
[11:24] shout dance or anything Hallelujah but
[11:27] what's being reflected
[11:29] a pull from the inside
[11:31] there's something from the inside
[11:33] connecting with the word and that's the
[11:35] real you
[11:37] the real you may not be that person that
[11:39] jumps up and run around and just kicks
[11:42] over and just let it all hang out that's
[11:44] all right you know I love that
[11:46] earlier
[11:48] but you give me something Hallelujah
[11:50] that can be tested through the times of
[11:53] tests Hallelujah
[11:54] amen well it can remain strong well it
[11:57] can remain peaceful well it can remain
[11:59] solid honey that's the real reflection
[12:01] of what it is
[12:03] Hallelujah and normally do trials and
[12:05] tribulations the real you will come out
[12:10] when you're at school when you're in
[12:12] your jobs Hallelujah the real you has to
[12:15] come out
[12:19] but if we can
[12:21] let's talk about reflection
[12:24] Hallelujah real reflection
[12:26] you know
[12:27] as a type
[12:29] God's character and God's person is
[12:33] spoke of as deity amen
[12:35] and deity is what a type of what gold
[12:39] and if you have the seed of God inside
[12:41] of you what's inside of you deity
[12:44] Hallelujah somebody talk to me now we've
[12:47] heard these things over and over again
[12:49] but I want you young people to realize
[12:51] that if you are a child of God you have
[12:54] deity inside of you
[12:56] so Satan doesn't have a right to make
[12:58] you live any less than that
[13:01] he doesn't have a right to make you feel
[13:03] any less than that he doesn't have a
[13:06] right to make you believe anything less
[13:08] than that you are deity
[13:12] Hallelujah you are the makeup the
[13:15] presence Hallelujah the inspiration of
[13:17] God
[13:19] you are as a child when you say Brothers
[13:22] I don't know about that well let me say
[13:24] it like this who was Jesus at the age of
[13:26] 12 in the synagogue
[13:30] as a child what was he in the city
[13:32] he's still
[13:36] still in our deity was inside of him
[13:40] and what did he reflect at the age of 12
[13:43] he reflected he must be about his
[13:46] father's business
[13:51] even though he was born in a stinking
[13:53] Manger
[13:54] that didn't stop who he was
[14:00] how he looked on the outsider what
[14:02] people thought about him and what they
[14:04] thought about Mary and Joseph he knew
[14:06] that there was something in him
[14:08] Hallelujah that the whole world had to
[14:10] know
[14:13] at the age of 12.
[14:16] and I love saying this quote
[14:19] the prophet of God said the only thing
[14:21] that stop him from receiving the Holy
[14:23] Ghost
[14:24] at the age of 12 was a devil
[14:29] hanging over him
[14:31] when God was calling
[14:33] at the age of 12.
[14:36] Hallelujah so how young is too young
[14:43] how young is too young to be led by God
[14:46] how young is too young to reflect God's
[14:50] will in your life
[14:51] how young is to you you say well that's
[14:53] 12. well let's go back a little bit
[14:55] further there was a king named Josiah
[14:57] who was eight years old
[15:00] and he found the message for
[15:04] up until that time he was doing all he
[15:07] knew how to do but then one day he came
[15:09] across the writings of a prophet
[15:13] Hallelujah and when he came across the
[15:16] book of Moses Hallelujah he began to
[15:18] read it and he saw that he was not
[15:20] reflecting his end time message
[15:26] Hallelujah
[15:28] and as he started to read
[15:30] he had to straighten some things out
[15:33] earlier he had to make some things right
[15:35] in his kingdom the Bible says he didn't
[15:37] he didn't lean to the left he didn't
[15:39] lean to the right but he took the things
[15:41] that he was reading and dealt head on
[15:43] with him
[15:45] can you imagine he had you can go back
[15:47] and read it he had put heathens in
[15:49] positions that wasn't supposed to be in
[15:51] position
[15:53] Hallelujah so when the word came up when
[15:56] the word opened up to him he had to take
[15:58] those in positions and take him out of
[16:00] position
[16:02] so that his kingdom could reflect the
[16:05] right thing
[16:06] what about you are you able to strip
[16:09] down things off of your inward walls
[16:12] so that you can reflect the right thing
[16:14] are you able to strip down things that
[16:17] are in your private messages that are in
[16:19] your DMs that you're holding on to are
[16:21] you able to strip it down so you can get
[16:24] right into the real reflection of God
[16:28] because remember your gold
[16:34] but let's think about God
[16:37] to get to go
[16:40] you got to go on some nasty areas
[16:45] Hallelujah
[16:46] you say why is he walking around with
[16:48] that mirror in his hand
[16:51] Hallelujah because I want you to think
[16:52] the whole time I'm preaching I'm talking
[16:54] about what you're reflecting
[16:57] Hallelujah and we're supposed to reflect
[17:00] deity
[17:01] young people say it with me
[17:05] that's what's inside of you
[17:07] not paying not hurt not sickness if the
[17:11] seed of God is in you you are deity
[17:16] oh Church to get gold
[17:20] you got to go into some dark places
[17:24] Hallelujah you got to dig among Thieves
[17:27] that's not really gold
[17:29] rocks and and dirt and all these other
[17:33] things that are there where the goal is
[17:36] it so sometimes they get the realness
[17:39] out of you you got to dig deep
[17:43] you got to go into some dark areas of
[17:45] Our Lives that no one knows about but
[17:48] let me say it like this even earlier
[17:50] that gold that's in a cave where there's
[17:52] no life and there's nothing but darkness
[17:54] in that condition it's still gold
[18:00] somebody say hallelujah
[18:02] in a cave where there's mildew there's
[18:05] no life there's not even any light
[18:08] there's no Oxygen but in that cave that
[18:11] goal is still gold
[18:14] Hallelujah
[18:17] and if I could say it like this let me
[18:18] put myself in it when I was in the club
[18:20] dancing to the worldly rap music I was
[18:23] still gold
[18:26] Hallelujah and when your parents were in
[18:28] the bars Hallelujah drinking them
[18:30] nicolos they were still gold well they
[18:33] were in the country club listening to
[18:35] that country music being all depressed
[18:37] they were still gold
[18:43] Hallelujah
[18:45] and so are you
[18:48] in your schools being persecuted still
[18:51] gold
[18:52] in your schools being bullied because
[18:54] you're a Christian still gold
[18:59] Hallelujah
[19:03] because of trial
[19:06] and environment
[19:08] can't change the seed
[19:11] foreign
[19:19] Cain grew up in a good environment
[19:22] he grew up in a Godly household
[19:25] he grew up with parents who knew and
[19:28] heard the voice of God
[19:31] and they ushered those things
[19:33] unto him they saw he saw a true
[19:36] reflection of what God-fearing parents
[19:39] were all about
[19:40] Hallelujah but when it came time for him
[19:43] to demonstrate what's really in his
[19:46] heart he couldn't be that he couldn't
[19:48] reflect that why because that was not in
[19:51] him
[19:52] hallelujah what was in him begin to come
[19:55] out and he saw himself reflecting
[19:57] another life where did it come from his
[20:00] father
[20:03] Hallelujah and it took a certain
[20:06] situation to bring that out
[20:09] Hallelujah
[20:10] and sometimes God put us in certain
[20:12] situations so you can realize where you
[20:15] are in the kingdom of God
[20:18] and you know as young people
[20:19] some of you are very good with playing
[20:22] the role of a chameleon
[20:28] in church you're a saint
[20:33] you're that sweet innocent little
[20:35] daughter that Mama and Papa loves
[20:40] but when you're in school
[20:53] you ticking it and talking it every way
[20:55] you can
[20:59] that's what you're really reflecting
[21:02] that's what's really oh you gather up
[21:03] all your friends come on y'all let's do
[21:04] a tick tock come on let's do a tick tock
[21:07] you know the next time they say let's do
[21:09] a tick tock hey man gather your friends
[21:11] up Holly for those of you who are church
[21:13] church goals and and really want to see
[21:16] God do some of your life the next time
[21:18] they gave you up to do a tick tock I
[21:20] want you to say God Is My Hope
[21:24] God is up to something put that on your
[21:27] tick tock
[21:30] Hallelujah
[21:32] you know I'm not gonna badge you about
[21:34] it because I know some of it is just
[21:35] natural entertainment
[21:37] but when these things consume you when
[21:39] it becomes a part of what you really
[21:41] want to reflect when you have to do the
[21:43] latest Challenge and the this and the
[21:45] that and next thing you know you
[21:54] know some of that stuff is just
[21:55] ridiculous
[21:58] ridiculous and I I and I'm not gonna be
[22:01] a hypocrite I go on to somebody that I
[22:03] laugh too
[22:04] it's all about a good laugh for me
[22:07] but for me to feel like I got to fit in
[22:09] holy when I feel when you feel like if
[22:12] you're not reflecting this you're not
[22:14] doing what's right then it's an evil
[22:17] spirit
[22:18] Hallelujah and it goes that way with any
[22:21] kind of social media or anything that
[22:23] you're on when it starts to get you to
[22:25] be something else that you're not in the
[22:28] kingdom of God
[22:30] then it's the evil spirit
[22:33] holy
[22:34] it's no different Hallelujah from the
[22:36] prophet wanting to go hunting
[22:39] they went hunting and and you get game
[22:41] and everything but God had to check him
[22:43] on that because he was reflecting a
[22:45] murderer
[22:48] he told him I only want you to get what
[22:51] you're allowed to get
[22:53] because he used to go here boom blast
[22:55] everything boo boo boo boo come back
[22:57] with game for everybody
[22:59] breaking the law
[23:03] amen it's on the tape
[23:07] God told him to stop because he was
[23:09] reflecting the wrong thing
[23:12] even though he's a man of God filled
[23:14] with the Holy Ghost
[23:15] but trying to be a people pleaser he was
[23:18] reflecting the wrong thing
[23:20] and God told him stop that I only want
[23:23] you to get what you're allowed to get
[23:27] Hallelujah
[23:29] so what we consider to be on the highest
[23:31] levels of the gospel God is still the
[23:34] same
[23:35] we want to reflect the right thing
[23:38] but when you think of gold earlier gold
[23:41] is sometimes is fouled among dirty nasty
[23:45] conditions
[23:46] but it's still gold
[23:49] oh that made me want to shout
[23:54] Holly because you know sometimes you
[23:55] look in the mirror and you don't feel
[23:57] like nothing
[23:58] you don't feel worthy you're going
[23:59] through a trial everything is messing up
[24:01] messing up in your life but that does
[24:03] not change that you are deity
[24:08] Hallelujah hey you may be on the
[24:11] internet watching us I want you to say
[24:13] to yourself tell the devil shut up
[24:17] stop listening to him Hallelujah stop
[24:20] receiving his thoughts in your mind you
[24:22] are a child of God you are delivered you
[24:26] will be exactly what he wants you to be
[24:28] shut up devil
[24:32] we spend too much time listening to him
[24:36] but when it comes to reflection Julia
[24:38] some of the most priceless things are
[24:40] found in filthy conditions where do you
[24:44] find diamonds
[24:47] they have to be pressed Hallelujah
[24:50] amen they have to be put up under
[24:52] pressure that they may come out and
[24:55] reflect something that's priceless
[24:58] and so do we Hallelujah you are God's
[25:01] diamonds Hallelujah and you have to be
[25:04] put up under pressure so the real you
[25:06] can be formed and come out
[25:09] don't get nervous I ain't gonna be long
[25:14] but when I started think about this
[25:17] this thought of reflection and what a
[25:19] reflection reflecting the Bible says
[25:22] earlier
[25:23] there is a way which seemeth right unto
[25:25] a man but the end thereof are the ways
[25:28] of death
[25:30] oh my and there's another one that says
[25:32] in Proverbs 21
[25:33] everywhere of a man is right in his own
[25:36] eyes
[25:39] how often do we fall in that category
[25:44] everything we do is right in our own
[25:46] eyes you know why because we want it
[25:51] but you think about it even even uh
[25:53] relationships if you get to the place
[25:55] where you're like you put it before God
[25:57] and you say Lord Lord I just want your
[25:59] will what if it's God's will for you not
[26:01] to be together
[26:03] can you accept that
[26:05] we want to reflect what he has for us
[26:09] we don't want to try to make something
[26:11] happen in our life that's not God's will
[26:14] Hallelujah
[26:16] because if you partake of that and it's
[26:18] not God's will you're going to reflect
[26:21] Hallelujah disobedience
[26:26] sure
[26:32] every way of a man is right in his own
[26:34] eyes but the Lord pondereth the hearts
[26:39] see God is more concerned right now not
[26:42] how you look
[26:43] on the outside but how you look on the
[26:46] inside
[26:47] and who you are on the inside will take
[26:49] care of the outside
[26:51] because I know I truly believe brother
[26:54] Paul don't waste his time trying to
[26:57] conform people
[26:59] that's not our job we're not here
[27:01] hallelujah as we formers
[27:03] what we're here to do is prayer of God
[27:06] and let the word set you free
[27:09] Hallelujah I could have spent this whole
[27:11] service preaching about the Realms of
[27:13] the sin of the young people
[27:17] but I want you to understand that the
[27:20] wrongs does not identify who you truly
[27:23] are
[27:26] you're false
[27:28] your mistakes your errors it does not
[27:31] truly tell Who You Are
[27:34] but in some cases it's that flower that
[27:38] makes you a masterpiece Hallelujah
[27:40] because even with that flaw you can
[27:43] still reflect what's in God's mind
[27:48] that's what he said about the Statue of
[27:50] Michelangelo it was it was reflecting
[27:53] what was in the image Moses statue was
[27:55] reflecting what was in the image of
[27:57] Michelangelo's mind and when he looked
[28:00] at it he saw those in his mind and it
[28:02] was so real to hit it on the knee and
[28:04] said speak
[28:08] in a reflection of what was in his mind
[28:10] is now looking at him it was so real
[28:13] real until you had to hit it underneath
[28:16] the knee wouldn't you want to be like
[28:17] that
[28:19] you want your life to be so real
[28:22] that God will give you the authority to
[28:24] speak
[28:31] but if we back up
[28:34] normally
[28:36] the first reflection
[28:39] and the only reflection in a lot of
[28:41] things
[28:42] is self-reflection
[28:46] looking at yourself
[28:48] not looking at somebody else
[28:51] because if we just take the outward
[28:52] appearance
[28:53] one thing about this mirror it doesn't
[28:56] know how to lie
[29:02] and it's not in the business of making
[29:04] you feel good when you're not supposed
[29:06] to
[29:09] leave your hair is all over your head
[29:11] and you're looking like Beetlejuice the
[29:12] mirror will reflect that
[29:17] sisters to come up with you and say girl
[29:19] you look nice I like your curls but the
[29:21] mirror is saying
[29:29] this he doesn't know how to lie
[29:34] why because it was created to reflect
[29:37] truth
[29:39] it was created to reflect what's put in
[29:42] front of it
[29:43] Hallelujah
[29:45] and that's all you can get with the word
[29:47] of God
[29:48] Hallelujah if you receive it Hallelujah
[29:51] if you take what's in front of you
[29:53] that's what you'll reflect
[29:57] whether it's the word or whether it's a
[29:59] worldly concept if you receive more of a
[30:02] worldly concept you're going to reflect
[30:04] the world
[30:06] if you receive more of the word of God
[30:08] you're going to reflect the word of God
[30:11] it's very simple like in the terms of
[30:14] you are what you eat
[30:17] Hallelujah
[30:19] you know I'm a person I like sweets I'm
[30:21] sorry I do
[30:23] I like a little bit of Apple Donuts this
[30:27] is my favorite time of year
[30:32] because I get to go to Bennett's
[30:34] and get those apple cookies that we
[30:36] don't have down south
[30:39] and when I'm getting when I get back
[30:40] home I'm really wanted
[30:43] cause I have cookies
[30:48] and those cookies reflect where I've
[30:49] been
[30:52] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[30:56] but I like this time of year amen
[30:59] because amen this season this Autumn
[31:02] season it shows are falling away
[31:05] but it shows a falling away of something
[31:07] natural to something that's beautiful
[31:11] even though it's falling away it still
[31:15] presents the beauty of God
[31:18] and that's how God feels when you fall
[31:21] away from worldly things you present the
[31:23] beauty of God
[31:25] to show that you're not connected to the
[31:28] world you fall away from it and you're
[31:30] changing as you go oh the beauty of God
[31:36] self reflection
[31:39] if I can before I close
[31:42] I want to talk about this story in the
[31:45] Bible
[31:46] well King David
[31:49] one day you know I love talking about
[31:52] David
[31:53] let me tell you young men
[31:55] you know everybody can't be appalled
[32:00] you know a lot of times me and we we
[32:02] read the read the scriptures we want to
[32:04] compare ourselves with power to be Paul
[32:06] Paul is a man of God
[32:12] Paul went through so much adversity you
[32:14] know but a lot of times people not
[32:16] thinking about diversity they're
[32:17] thinking about God saying Paul had an
[32:19] abundance of Revelation coming out of
[32:21] them
[32:22] that's why they want to be like Paul
[32:24] they want to be looked upon to be
[32:25] something mighty
[32:27] I got revelation
[32:29] I'm like Paul
[32:31] be identified with Paul getting bit by a
[32:33] serpent
[32:36] Ben did the Divine spinning a night and
[32:38] day in the sea
[32:40] be identified getting whipped over five
[32:43] times with 40 stripes
[32:45] be identified getting thrown over a wall
[32:48] and then Stone
[32:51] no I don't want to be bald
[32:57] that man went through something
[32:59] be identified being locked up for what
[33:01] you believe
[33:03] being locked up in the wintertime in a
[33:05] jail only eating bread and water with no
[33:08] coat
[33:11] that was the life Paul lived
[33:14] but what was he reflecting Hallelujah
[33:16] Paul had to go through those things why
[33:18] God had to give him to self-reflect in
[33:21] everything he went through because every
[33:23] holy stage of his life was a book in the
[33:26] New Testament
[33:29] Hallelujah he had to go through
[33:31] Hallelujah experiencing love and true
[33:34] love why so he could deal with the
[33:35] Corinthian Church
[33:37] he had to deal with placing and being
[33:40] placed why because he had to deal with
[33:42] the Ephesus Church
[33:45] Hallelujah he had to deal with people
[33:47] hallelujah getting persecuted in church
[33:50] and Paul earlier said don't worry about
[33:52] it put everything he owes on my charge
[33:55] Philemon
[33:59] so everything he went through was a
[34:01] reflection of what he was going to write
[34:04] what about your life
[34:07] as a young person you go through things
[34:09] sometimes it's for somebody else's
[34:11] benefit
[34:12] Hallelujah
[34:14] and the way you go through it could help
[34:16] somebody else
[34:17] although Paul was a mighty man to God I
[34:20] identify more with David
[34:26] but sometimes
[34:27] I shouldn't say something
[34:30] all the time I feel like a giant killer
[34:35] Hallelujah
[34:38] I feel like I was created
[34:40] to kill Giants
[34:43] honey I feel like when my brothers and
[34:46] sisters Hallelujah don't have the
[34:48] strength to fight I say send me
[34:51] I'll stand out there and fight that
[34:53] devil
[34:54] holy you say Brothers how can you say it
[34:56] cause just like David I'm not going out
[34:59] there with My Own Strength I'm going I
[35:01] just said to Rebecca with my testimony
[35:04] Hallelujah David had a testimony that
[35:08] were reflect in every battle
[35:11] Hallelujah before he fought Goliath what
[35:14] did he do he started to reflect he
[35:16] started to have self-reflection he said
[35:18] oh I fought a bear reflection I thought
[35:21] a liar a reflection a Goliath you're
[35:23] going to be just like that
[35:26] what do you do when you're going through
[35:27] you need to have self-reflection
[35:33] so not only do I identify with the
[35:35] strength of David
[35:36] identify with the Falls of David
[35:40] because one thing about David Hurley he
[35:44] was a man after God's very own heart
[35:48] and before I get that Gabby there's
[35:50] something else about David I identify
[35:52] with Hallelujah
[35:53] David loved to dance
[36:03] oh yeah
[36:04] David loved the worship
[36:07] and David didn't get what you message
[36:09] believersy
[36:12] David didn't care what quotes you could
[36:14] bring out what scriptures you can bring
[36:16] out David said you thought that was a
[36:17] dance let me Slim you come and find me
[36:19] tomorrow in service
[36:21] you come see me next week Hallelujah you
[36:24] thought I worshiped him you watched me
[36:25] with my song come on
[36:29] but what I want you to understand about
[36:31] David being a man under God's very own
[36:33] heart to the church members to his own
[36:36] wife he looked like he was out of order
[36:38] but he had a heart of God
[36:40] he looked Church in that moment when the
[36:43] Ark of the Covenant was coming back and
[36:45] David started to dance I'm about to say
[36:47] something now when David started to
[36:49] dance because he had a heart of God that
[36:53] day his death was doing would have been
[36:55] the same day as God would have did
[37:01] because he was a man of the God's very
[37:03] old heart
[37:07] what was he doing he was reflecting
[37:10] Christ he was reflecting Liberty he was
[37:13] reflecting what it means when the true
[37:16] word comes back into your church
[37:22] and we have the true word in our church
[37:24] and we sit here like a bunch of bumps on
[37:27] the law
[37:31] oh man
[37:36] no I'm not trying to excite anybody
[37:39] I'm trying to get you to see
[37:42] either you're a reflecting Christ
[37:45] or you're reflecting another image
[37:49] Hallelujah
[37:50] in Jersey
[37:52] I love about David
[37:54] fought battles
[37:56] David went through things that were
[37:58] unexplainable
[38:00] holy and one thing about David
[38:03] I'm gonna take this story and I'm about
[38:05] to wind down
[38:06] you just one day
[38:08] David had battled out the battle he had
[38:10] Victory out of the victory amen
[38:13] really did we ever hear about David
[38:15] losing
[38:17] and when he lost Hallelujah it was
[38:20] something God was trying to do
[38:22] Holly
[38:24] well go back and fight those same people
[38:25] after God made it clear and win
[38:28] Hallelujah so he had ups and downs amen
[38:31] but God was always with him
[38:34] but what I love about David was what he
[38:36] reflected in his good days well the same
[38:39] thing he reflected in his bad days
[38:43] that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[38:46] want Hallelujah the Lord is on my side
[38:49] what shall man do unto me
[38:53] that's what David reflected Hallelujah
[38:56] and I say church I'm not boasting but
[38:58] that's how I feel sometimes amen amen
[39:01] when there are no explanations and
[39:03] there's no answers God has to be on my
[39:05] side
[39:09] church and now David
[39:11] after all these battles he fought and
[39:13] all these victories you've helped the
[39:14] church win one day he decided to take a
[39:17] rest
[39:22] new cars and different things he said
[39:23] there's nothing wrong with a new car he
[39:25] says but sometimes our car is working
[39:27] fine
[39:30] smoking fine is getting where you're
[39:32] supposed to go is doing what it's
[39:33] supposed to do paint job may not be all
[39:35] that but it's served its purpose
[39:37] but then they come out with something
[39:39] new and it has a new Egypt in it it has
[39:42] a new Gidget in it and you're like oh
[39:45] I think I want that oh that new Gidget
[39:48] I think I want that New Egypt
[39:50] well you can have it for 40 000.
[39:57] and you go out here where you're free
[39:59] you're free from debt you're free from
[40:01] it all and you go get another 40 000 on
[40:04] top because of an idiot or a Gidget
[40:13] it's reflecting something else though
[40:15] it's reflecting that
[40:17] satisfied
[40:23] now I'm not preaching against having new
[40:27] cars
[40:29] because when God blessed me with my
[40:31] Maserati I don't want to hear your mouth
[40:36] I want to hear it
[40:39] I'll tell you right now the interior
[40:41] might be red so don't bother me
[40:45] don't bother me God bless me with it
[40:47] don't bother me
[40:59] praise God
[41:05] hallelujah it's just another car
[41:08] Hallelujah that's all it is no matter
[41:11] what you drive no matter where it takes
[41:12] you it's just another car
[41:14] but I know friends who got Teslas and
[41:17] they were like hey you want to drive it
[41:18] I say nope
[41:19] say well I don't want to drive it I say
[41:21] it's too technical
[41:23] anything that can stop on his own and
[41:25] drive on his own it don't need me to get
[41:27] behind it
[41:29] I'm good you just go ahead and drive it
[41:31] I'm all right
[41:33] don't want nothing to do with Tesla
[41:36] and anyway it's a part of Prophecy and
[41:38] not good prophecy
[41:41] so you can have your tonight I ain't
[41:44] saying you shouldn't buy no Tesla don't
[41:46] don't bring those uncertain Sound by
[41:48] what I'm saying
[41:50] Holy by whatever God allows you to buy
[41:52] it's on you
[41:54] but anyway let's get back to David David
[41:58] you guys are like he's talking about
[41:59] this and he's talking about that and
[42:00] he's talking about this he talked about
[42:01] that
[42:03] God you know what God does God is like a
[42:05] quarterback
[42:08] some of us are running and you ain't
[42:10] paying attention to God will hit you in
[42:12] the back of the head
[42:14] you thought I said you was going to
[42:15] catch it no it's in the back of the head
[42:17] so you should have been paying attention
[42:20] you know that's what happened to
[42:21] receivers well they're not penetration
[42:23] not running they route right they get
[42:24] hit with the ball
[42:26] and sometimes we're out there on the
[42:28] field and we're not paying attention
[42:29] you're gonna get hit with the ball
[42:31] there's a story I'll tell you real quick
[42:33] about Magic Johnson you know why they
[42:35] call him magic because he can throw
[42:37] passes and everything when nobody's
[42:38] expecting it
[42:40] and one of his teammates James Worthy he
[42:42] realized he had to have his eyes on him
[42:44] at all times how did he come to that
[42:47] reality he kept getting hit in the face
[42:54] so even when he wasn't expecting to get
[42:57] the ball he always had his eyes on the
[42:59] point guard
[43:02] why because he kept getting hit in the
[43:04] face
[43:06] Hallelujah
[43:07] in church there are times Hallelujah God
[43:10] may be dealing with somebody else but he
[43:13] wants your attention also because there
[43:15] might be something in there for you you
[43:17] might not know what is coming but you
[43:18] got to keep your eyes on God
[43:25] and he said it'd be people running all
[43:27] down the court and they you know
[43:30] are you unready
[43:34] I don't want to be like that with God
[43:36] when he acts for it I want to be able to
[43:38] give it to
[43:40] him one of one of the one of the
[43:41] scriptures that I look at is when he
[43:43] goes up to that fig tree
[43:46] and he asks for figs from that tree out
[43:49] of its natural season but I want you to
[43:52] realize this is God speaking to the tree
[43:55] this is the creator Hallelujah so if I
[43:58] was that tree I would have gave up figs
[44:03] and the tree gets cursed in that moment
[44:05] because it didn't give God what he asked
[44:07] for
[44:08] and when they came back the tree was
[44:10] withered Hallelujah I want to be a
[44:12] person no matter what your season looks
[44:15] like when God acts of me I'm able to
[44:17] come forth with it
[44:22] but David real quick David
[44:25] he already had 500 wives
[44:28] and now he takes Bathsheba and we know
[44:31] him and but she will have relations and
[44:33] all these things and Bathsheba gets
[44:35] pregnant and but Bathsheba has a husband
[44:39] and now David
[44:43] sees that Beersheba is with child
[44:47] and David don't want it to reflect what
[44:50] he did wrong
[44:52] so now what he's going to do he's going
[44:54] to do everything sneaky he can do to try
[44:57] to get out of it
[45:00] what does he reflecting he's not
[45:01] reflecting King David one who fears God
[45:07] no he's reflecting a man who has secrets
[45:14] you know he's trying to cover up his
[45:16] secrets but catch it this is a man under
[45:19] God's very own heart
[45:23] now let me encourage you a little bit
[45:25] even though David was doing all this did
[45:29] it stop him from being King
[45:33] he still was King
[45:35] still was a man after God's very own
[45:37] heart
[45:38] but in this moment Hallelujah he was
[45:41] reflecting the wrong thing
[45:43] and you can go back and read it but I'm
[45:45] gonna kind of paraphrase it to get out
[45:46] of here amen he goes through different
[45:49] things he brings your Rider back home
[45:50] and and tries to get you right or go
[45:53] home and sleep with his wife and write
[45:54] like no Uriah is going to reflect his
[45:58] faithfulness
[45:59] to the man that's doing him wrong
[46:04] young people
[46:05] what are you reflecting to your parents
[46:08] that are taking care of you
[46:10] what are you reflecting to the ones that
[46:12] feed you and put money in your pocket
[46:13] and make sure you got clothes on your
[46:15] back what are you reflecting
[46:19] sure
[46:21] in Uriah
[46:23] he says man I can't just go home and
[46:25] relax and when we out here fighting this
[46:27] battle
[46:28] they was like go ahead man go on fight
[46:30] go and fight right like no I can't do it
[46:33] so he gets you right here drunk thinking
[46:35] everything is going to work out Uriah
[46:38] still stays away from it
[46:41] Hallelujah
[46:43] even in all it's trickery
[46:46] it still didn't come out the way David
[46:48] wanted to come out
[46:51] so make a long story shot
[46:54] David
[46:55] in that moment
[46:57] he was reflecting a liar
[47:00] he was reflecting a murderer
[47:03] he was reflecting an adulterer
[47:06] all these things he was reflecting but
[47:09] he was still a man after God's very own
[47:11] heart
[47:14] really Diggs you're so confusing
[47:18] how can he be all that and still a man
[47:21] of God's very own heart
[47:25] it's simple
[47:27] if you take a I would say a hurricane
[47:29] but that's more in my area
[47:31] you take a blizzard
[47:38] y'all better cast that down now
[47:42] I don't receive that
[47:44] but you take a blizzard that comes
[47:46] through Michigan Ohio
[47:48] and that blizzard comes the weight of
[47:51] the snow and the ice it tears down trees
[47:53] and rips off Limbs and does all these
[47:55] things in the cold in the blizzard
[47:59] does the blizzard
[48:01] stop the apple tree from being an apple
[48:03] tree
[48:06] does it stop it from reflecting what's
[48:08] truly on the inside
[48:11] it was just something it had to go
[48:13] through Hallelujah in 19th out of 10
[48:16] that blizzard Hallelujah Boaz is here
[48:20] oh boy
[48:21] Z and his wife are very familiar with
[48:25] maple syrup
[48:28] and those of you who may not know to get
[48:31] that good good that good good good good
[48:33] good good good good maple syrup
[48:37] they have to experience temperatures of
[48:40] freezing
[48:41] really really cold cold temperatures why
[48:44] because that drives down a serp in the
[48:47] tree
[48:47] the cold it is the better the seasons
[48:51] for good maple syrup honey and we're
[48:54] like oh my this surface so good you
[48:56] don't know what the Canadians had to put
[48:58] up with to give us that good sir
[49:02] I thank God for because I just love it
[49:06] Hallelujah but they have to have cold
[49:09] cold really cold temperatures the colder
[49:12] the winter the more Cirque they get
[49:14] and the better the surface the colder
[49:16] the winter
[49:17] if they have mild real mild winters like
[49:21] we have in South Carolina you just take
[49:23] that surface say trash
[49:27] we don't want that that's trash
[49:29] see it's the conditions of the cold
[49:32] which gives it and makes it what it is
[49:35] Holly when you and I'll be like nah I
[49:38] want that
[49:40] so in one place it's wanted in another
[49:42] place is not wanted
[49:46] you take David
[49:47] and David's done all this wrong
[49:50] Uriah is dead and he feels like he's
[49:52] good everything is good now
[49:55] you know you're uh she's but she was
[49:58] having a baby God hardly wouldn't let
[50:01] the baby live Dave is in there fasting
[50:02] and praying that God will have mercy and
[50:05] all these things
[50:08] let's turn to
[50:11] second Samuel
[50:13] I'm about to come down II Samuel
[50:16] uh
[50:21] let's go to chapter 12.
[50:27] second Samuel chapter
[50:30] 12.
[50:32] everybody all right
[50:35] praise God
[50:36] Hallelujah
[50:39] second Samuel chapter 12.
[50:43] foreign listen let's start at verse 7.
[50:48] you know I'ma Walker so put that up
[50:50] there for me praise God
[50:52] I want you to read along with me
[50:55] what are we talking about
[50:58] what are you reflecting
[51:00] let's read
[51:01] he says and Nathan said to David let's
[51:04] back up a little bit let's back up to
[51:06] let me see what verse I want
[51:11] you know what let's let's just start at
[51:12] verse one 12-1
[51:15] let's go the Bible said the Lord said
[51:17] Nathan unto David and he came unto him
[51:19] and said unto him there were two men in
[51:23] one city the one rich and the other poor
[51:27] and the rich man had exceeding Mighty
[51:30] flocks and herds
[51:32] the poor man
[51:34] had nothing save one little Elam which
[51:37] he had bought and nourished up and it
[51:40] grew up together with him and with his
[51:43] children and it did eat of his own meat
[51:45] and drank of his own cup and lay in his
[51:48] lay in his bosom and was unto him as a
[51:51] daughter and there came a traveler unto
[51:54] the rich man and he's spared and he
[51:57] spared to take of his own flock and of
[51:59] his of his own herd and dress of the
[52:02] wayfaring man that was come unto him but
[52:05] took the poor man's lamb and dressed it
[52:08] for the man that would come to him
[52:13] sound like a very bad man don't it
[52:16] let's read
[52:17] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[52:20] against the man and he said to Nathan as
[52:23] the Lord liveth that man have done this
[52:26] thing shall surely die
[52:29] now the Giant Killer is coming out of
[52:31] David
[52:34] is on the inside he knows what this man
[52:38] did was wrong
[52:40] and David's so angry at this man
[52:45] next verse
[52:48] and he said and he shall restore the
[52:50] lamb fourfold because he did this thing
[52:53] and because he had no Penny now look at
[52:56] David David is not ready to have no
[52:58] mercy on this man David ready to kill
[52:59] somebody
[53:01] David ready to operate in the authority
[53:03] of a king imma make him give it back
[53:07] he said his anger was killed against him
[53:10] now look verse 7 and Nathan said to
[53:13] David thou art that man
[53:16] take it down we won't come back
[53:20] David said
[53:22] and they just said David now that man so
[53:25] let's go back
[53:27] David wanted to kill that man
[53:30] David wanted to have no pity on that man
[53:33] so let's examine what David was really
[53:35] saying I want to kill myself
[53:40] because that's who he saw
[53:43] that's who David was talking about him
[53:46] and David's looking at what this man did
[53:48] which this man was really him and David
[53:51] wanted to kill that man he wanted to
[53:52] kill himself
[53:54] they was angry with who he was angry
[53:56] with himself
[53:58] church but he couldn't see it
[54:01] all the stuff David was doing he
[54:04] couldn't self-reflect
[54:07] and that's what happens sometimes as
[54:09] young people you get so caught up in
[54:11] things that you don't even realize
[54:12] you're wrong it takes a true anointed
[54:15] word to come
[54:18] and show you your wrongs
[54:20] put it back up there verse 7.
[54:23] and they just said to David thou are the
[54:25] man and thus the Lord God of Israel I
[54:29] anointed the king of Israel and I
[54:31] deliver thee out of the hand of Saul
[54:33] next verse
[54:34] and I gave thee that Master's house and
[54:36] that Master's wives into the bosom and
[54:38] gave Thee the house of Israel of Judah
[54:40] and if thou had been too little I would
[54:45] moreover have given unto thee such and
[54:47] such are things
[54:50] you don't have to seek your pleasures
[54:52] and joy in the world all you got to do
[54:55] is ask God
[55:00] Hallelujah
[55:02] next verse
[55:05] wherefore as thou despised the
[55:07] Commandment of the Lord
[55:08] to evil to do evil in his sight and thou
[55:11] has killed Uriah the hittite with the
[55:13] sword and has taken his wife to be that
[55:16] wife has taken his wife to be that wife
[55:19] and has slain him
[55:21] with the sword of the children of Israel
[55:23] of amnon now look
[55:25] David's done all this but he wasn't able
[55:28] to self-reflect
[55:31] he was caught up in the midst of it
[55:34] next verse
[55:35] now therefore the sword shall never
[55:37] depart from thy house because thou has
[55:40] despised me and has taken thy wife of
[55:42] Uriah the hittite to be thy wife next
[55:45] verse thus said the Lord behold I will
[55:47] raise up evil against thee out of the
[55:49] thine own house and I will take thy was
[55:51] before the eyes and give them unto thy
[55:53] neighbor and thou shalt lie with our
[55:55] wives and in the sight of the son for
[55:58] thou did Us in secret but I will do this
[56:01] thing before all Israel
[56:03] and before the sun
[56:06] that's why the Bible says what you do in
[56:09] the dark will come to the light
[56:11] of the light one way or another you're
[56:13] going to reflect
[56:16] now the thing of it is do you want God
[56:18] to bring it out or would you rather
[56:19] let's be like David let's go
[56:22] and David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[56:26] against the Lord
[56:30] look at David
[56:32] didn't try to wiggle his way out
[56:35] David didn't try to say
[56:37] you know it wasn't me the difference
[56:40] between Saul and David David could
[56:43] self-reflect
[56:47] David could self-reflected his role
[56:49] David could say I have sinned when God
[56:52] came to Saul about disobeying the
[56:54] Commandment Saul said it was the people
[56:59] young people can you self-reflect when
[57:02] you're wrong you're wrong
[57:04] just make it right with God and move on
[57:07] Hallelujah David couldn't reflect except
[57:12] it came through the voice of a prophet
[57:16] Hallelujah when you're going through
[57:18] these don't stay out of church don't put
[57:20] the message down because it was the
[57:22] voice of the Prophet that made David's
[57:24] self-reflect
[57:26] and it's the voice of the Prophet that
[57:28] brought us all our denominations it was
[57:31] the voice of the Prophet Hallelujah that
[57:32] made us good husbands and good wives it
[57:35] allowed us the ability to self-reflect
[57:42] and David said underneath that I have
[57:44] sinned against the Lord and Nathan said
[57:46] unto David the Lord also have put away
[57:49] thy sin thou shall not die
[57:52] he was supposed to die
[57:55] but because he could self-reflect and
[57:58] make his wrongs right God blotted out
[58:00] his sins
[58:01] where the scripture says is not imputed
[58:04] unto him Hallelujah why because really
[58:06] in his heart he didn't mean to do it
[58:11] there we are young people
[58:14] a lot of times we get caught up and we
[58:16] do things that we really don't mean to
[58:18] do
[58:19] all God wants you to do is self-reflect
[58:22] come musicians
[58:24] all God wants you to do is just repent
[58:27] and make it right
[58:28] and when you can self-reflect God can
[58:31] give you Mercy
[58:33] Hallelujah if we go back to Saul earlier
[58:36] because Saul said was the people it was
[58:37] just it was that God put away Saul and
[58:40] made the anointing leave his life and
[58:43] from that point on he was led by an evil
[58:45] spirit
[58:46] because he couldn't Hallelujah
[58:48] self-reflect in the moment where God was
[58:51] showing him himself
[58:53] and I wonder if God is showing anybody
[58:56] tonight themselves
[58:59] where you are spiritually
[59:02] notice
[59:04] this message tonight is a message of
[59:07] encouragement
[59:10] because one thing I want you to
[59:11] understand
[59:13] when I first started preaching I told
[59:15] you you were what go
[59:19] you are deity there's gold inside of you
[59:22] but when you make mistakes like David
[59:24] don't hold on to it repent
[59:27] make it right therefore you can go on
[59:30] with God
[59:32] Hallelujah because that mistake that
[59:35] trial or whatever it may be it doesn't
[59:37] change the life of the seed inside
[59:41] without repentance it can make life more
[59:44] rough
[59:47] but if you belong to God he's gonna get
[59:49] you
[59:51] You Gonna Come
[59:55] before I like to say God
[59:57] it's like a bounty hunter
[1:00:01] brother Kenny's like a bounty hunter
[1:00:04] and he has a picture of each one of you
[1:00:06] that are wanted
[1:00:09] and some of you there's a large reward
[1:00:11] on your head
[1:00:13] Hallelujah
[1:00:15] and he'll see the Bounty Hunter out to
[1:00:17] get you he has your picture and somebody
[1:00:19] hunt us they just want the reward
[1:00:23] Hallelujah so they don't care Hallelujah
[1:00:26] they'll they'll they'll sail they'll put
[1:00:28] on the poster they'll say Wanted Dead or
[1:00:31] Alive
[1:00:33] because whether you're dead or alive
[1:00:34] that Bounty Hunter's still going to get
[1:00:37] paid
[1:00:40] you know what a good Bounty Hunter a
[1:00:42] real Bounty Hunter does
[1:00:43] when he finds out where you're at
[1:00:46] he'll proposition you
[1:00:48] he'll say hey
[1:00:49] pull that gun out on you
[1:00:52] let's just say I'm the Bounty Hunter
[1:00:54] tonight
[1:00:56] he'll pull that gun out on you say hey
[1:00:58] there's two ways we can do this
[1:01:03] you can receive what I'm saying that
[1:01:06] I've been sent from greater powers
[1:01:08] and I've come to get you and you can
[1:01:10] come and go quietly
[1:01:12] or I can take this gun and bust you
[1:01:14] across the head and drag you behind my
[1:01:16] horse
[1:01:18] but you're gonna come one way or another
[1:01:20] so either come quietly
[1:01:22] or you're gonna come Kicking and
[1:01:24] Screaming but one way or another you're
[1:01:25] gonna come
[1:01:27] now I don't know privileges some of us
[1:01:30] had to get knocked across the head but
[1:01:32] we're here
[1:01:33] Hallelujah
[1:01:35] trying to get whipped Hallelujah some of
[1:01:37] us had to get dragged but nevertheless
[1:01:39] I'm here
[1:01:41] young people I'm saying to you tonight
[1:01:43] you don't have to come all wild and
[1:01:46] struggling and Lord I don't want no just
[1:01:48] give up and say Lord be it unto me
[1:01:52] let me tell you something this world is
[1:01:54] not going to get any better
[1:02:00] Church we're almost back to the day
[1:02:02] where we're having concentration camps
[1:02:07] don't you realize Hallelujah young
[1:02:09] people don't you realize there's a war
[1:02:11] going on that's almost resembling what
[1:02:14] Hitler did to the Jews
[1:02:16] that that
[1:02:18] you have a man in control who doesn't
[1:02:21] care about anybody
[1:02:23] including people into a war who don't
[1:02:25] want to fight
[1:02:27] able to answer them from 18 to 35 if
[1:02:30] you're here you got to fight me and
[1:02:32] start leaving the country
[1:02:35] this world
[1:02:37] is not going to get any better
[1:02:41] so I say to you young people
[1:02:44] choose me this day
[1:02:46] who you want to reflect
[1:02:50] don't be like Saul make excuses for
[1:02:52] everybody else
[1:02:54] and that didn't start with Saul and
[1:02:56] start with Adam he was a woman
[1:03:00] did a woman say did a woman say he was a
[1:03:04] serpent
[1:03:05] everybody blaming somebody
[1:03:09] you know what when it comes to your soul
[1:03:11] you're not going to be able to blame
[1:03:13] anybody
[1:03:15] because one thing about God God will
[1:03:17] always keep himself blameless
[1:03:22] whatever word you may think hallelujah
[1:03:24] or whatever way you may think that you
[1:03:26] have out of it God has already presented
[1:03:29] a way out of it
[1:03:32] you say well I have experienced this and
[1:03:35] I've been hurt and I've been that I
[1:03:36] guarantee you God has brought a word for
[1:03:38] your deliverance
[1:03:39] and you didn't receive it
[1:03:42] the grace of God
[1:03:45] what are you reflecting
[1:03:47] it took the voice of a prophet
[1:03:50] to show David himself
[1:03:53] and once David could reflect
[1:03:56] then he could make it right
[1:03:58] and as he made it right God had mercy
[1:04:03] what are you
[1:04:07] all through the scriptures
[1:04:09] there were men who did things that
[1:04:10] wasn't of the character of God but it
[1:04:12] took them to get in a certain situations
[1:04:14] where they could see themselves you took
[1:04:16] Jacob he lied he cheated all these
[1:04:19] things from neighboring house to his
[1:04:20] house on and on and on and on until he
[1:04:22] had to go back and meet Esau
[1:04:25] did he had to self-reflect
[1:04:28] and once he began to self-reflect he met
[1:04:31] God
[1:04:33] in a way like never before
[1:04:36] God changed his name God changed his
[1:04:39] walk Hallelujah and he went back to meet
[1:04:41] Esau as a prince
[1:04:44] why because he was able to self-reflect
[1:04:49] young people you know where you are
[1:04:52] you know where you're standing you know
[1:04:53] your faults your failures you know your
[1:04:55] Temptations you know all the areas that
[1:04:58] are stunting your growth right now
[1:05:01] and let me say this most of you are
[1:05:03] without excuse
[1:05:07] because you're in a church
[1:05:09] preaching true words
[1:05:11] true anointing
[1:05:13] there's nothing added to it there's
[1:05:15] nothing taken away
[1:05:16] and you should be getting closer to God
[1:05:20] and if you're not getting closer to God
[1:05:23] the only reason why is yourself
[1:05:29] because you have every opportunity what
[1:05:32] are you feeding on what are you
[1:05:33] listening to what's what are you
[1:05:35] hungering after what's on the inside
[1:05:37] reflecting
[1:05:44] I think we spend too much time waiting
[1:05:46] on a better day
[1:05:49] well maybe the next Tri-State
[1:05:52] well maybe the next state God won't
[1:05:55] speak to you like this because he gave
[1:05:57] you a chance already
[1:05:59] he may deal with somebody else's heart
[1:06:02] that's why the scripture says the day
[1:06:04] you hear his heart huh the day you hear
[1:06:06] his voice heart not your heart
[1:06:09] Hallelujah
[1:06:12] so why don't we just give God a true
[1:06:14] surrender
[1:06:17] let's reflect on what's going on in the
[1:06:20] inside
[1:06:21] bring your issues to God and say Lord
[1:06:23] deliver me from this and it wasn't that
[1:06:26] easy Once David confessed God gave him
[1:06:28] Mercy
[1:06:29] just like that
[1:06:31] and he's still the same God he's not a
[1:06:33] respective person the prophet of God say
[1:06:35] let's be identified with Bible
[1:06:37] characters and I want you to be able to
[1:06:39] say if you've made mistakes like David
[1:06:41] what you can do you can go to God or you

[1:12:14] the mirror of the word of God is put
[1:12:16] before us Lord that's the only real true
[1:12:18] image God we can look at ourselves and
[1:12:21] see ourselves the way that you intended
[1:12:23] for us to be May every young person
[1:12:25] tonight be drawn to you feel drawn
[1:12:28] tonight to stop looking at the images of
[1:12:30] the world and start trying to reflect
[1:12:32] the images of the world but tonight for
[1:12:35] them to make a choice to turn to you and
[1:12:37] your word look in the mirror of your
[1:12:39] word and Lord as James said in the Bible
[1:12:41] we look and we keep gazing upon it and
[1:12:44] Lord we don't have to change ourselves
[1:12:46] we are changed from glory to glory to
[1:12:49] glory and you make us into the image
[1:12:52] that you intended for us to be whether
[1:12:54] they catch it tonight may all of us
[1:12:56] catch a deeper Walk with You Lord and
[1:12:58] have our faces looking into the right
[1:13:00] thing that can be the reflection Lord of
[1:13:03] what you intended in Genesis 1 26 the
[1:13:06] reflection of the son of God Imaging the
[1:13:09] father that's what we want that's what
[1:13:12] we desire Lord You're Beautiful tonight
[1:13:14] Oh Lord You're beautiful your face is
[1:13:17] all I see changes tonight I pray take
[1:13:20] these young people's hearts Lord that is
[1:13:22] praying and speaking you tonight and
[1:13:24] Lord sitting and listening so intently
[1:13:26] Lord and listening to our brother take
[1:13:28] their lives and mold them and make them
[1:13:30] Lord and if there's mistakes like David
[1:13:33] and several men in the Bible we know
[1:13:36] Lord that that with those mistakes Lord
[1:13:39] you could never change nothing could
[1:13:41] ever change their calling David was
[1:13:44] still the king and Lord we see he sinned
[1:13:47] and failed and yet Lord you used your
[1:13:49] Prophet to come back to him again you
[1:13:51] didn't ditch him you didn't say you're
[1:13:52] finished you didn't say you're not King
[1:13:54] anymore but Lord you came and came right
[1:13:57] to him and put the mirror right in front
[1:13:59] of him and when he's seen the true
[1:14:00] mirror he said I have sinned and Lord in
[1:14:03] a moment's time your Prophet said I
[1:14:06] forgive you I forgive you of all of it
[1:14:08] Lord Lord that's the mirror we want to
[1:14:10] look at tonight and I pray you touch
[1:14:12] these hearts Lord my burden is for the
[1:14:14] young people Lord in these times in
[1:14:17] these dark moments Lord when there's
[1:14:19] such a a pull to the things of the world
[1:14:21] and there's so many images Lord because
[1:14:25] we live in this time of our phones Lord
[1:14:28] it used to be we'd go to a movie or we
[1:14:31] would go to something or we see a
[1:14:32] billboard with images that weren't of
[1:14:34] the Right image and we'd try to reflect
[1:14:37] that now Lord the young people have
[1:14:39] their phones where constant images are
[1:14:42] placed in front of them all the time to
[1:14:44] distract them from the true image of God
[1:14:46] lord I intercede for their lives tonight
[1:14:49] Lord that they would pull away from
[1:14:51] looking at the wrong image and they
[1:14:53] would look into the word of God look
[1:14:54] into the message look into their Bibles
[1:14:57] Lord and look into the very face of
[1:14:59] Jesus Christ and Lord as you as they do
[1:15:01] that and and just discipline themselves
[1:15:03] to say well Lord I want to look at the
[1:15:05] right thing you transform them into the
[1:15:08] Right image the way that they're
[1:15:10] intended to be my burden is for them I
[1:15:12] pray you'll bless them tonight as we
[1:15:13] bring this service to a close I pray
[1:15:16] these things will just linger with them
[1:15:18] for many days now that they would Ponder
[1:15:20] where they're at and ponder their place
[1:15:22] in you Lord and look at the right things
[1:15:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:15:28] believe that you'll do it father in
[1:15:30] Jesus name we ask it how many can say in
[1:15:33] Jesus name
[1:15:35] in Jesus all things are possible in
[1:15:37] Jesus name tonight you might still feel
[1:15:40] I can't do it well that's good you can't
[1:15:41] do it but he can do it in your life amen
[1:15:44] don't let the devil tell you other a
[1:15:46] different identity you might be in an
[1:15:48] identity crisis tonight forget the
[1:15:50] world's identity forget what the devil's
[1:15:52] telling you and look on the inside and
[1:15:54] say I'm only interested in one identity
[1:15:56] and that's what God said that I am can
[1:15:59] you say praise the Lord
