this morning and any other visitors who's come in God bless you and all I can tell you is just get a hold of when God shows up just get a hold of it for yourself because his presence means everything everything else in the world's going to pass away but his word will never pass away and he brings his presence and speaks his word to you there's nothing more important in life we're going to have Gideon come back and uh have some specials here by Brother Jack and them and uh I just wanted to say that the future is looking bright and this year because of the grace of God I believe there's good things in store and we should be positive can you say amen God bless the offering this morning as well as they take it up may God just multiply it this morning we were my mom and I I picked my mom up this morning we went through Tim Horton's which is kind of a tradition with us uh and we picked up a coffee and the lady uh that was taking our order was so chipper and so positive and so she was just going on I said you have a super duper year and all these big words I said isn't it nice to hear somebody positive in this world and if anybody needs to be positive it's the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't need to be depressed we're too blessed to be depressed we're too anointed to be disappointed there's too many good things that God is doing and will do that we should be the most excited people on the face of the Earth don't let that Spirit of depression come around you I pray the Lord would just drive it away and how many you raise your hand and say let me not live in any depression this year let me live in the glories of God amen amen praise the Lord we believe that God will do it I did want to say once again about the retreat we uh just had 3 days up there in Grass Lake Michigan and it was such a joy to see such a gathering of young people and some of you are here this morning but it was such a good turnout I think we had about 160 165 and they came from 17 different states and four different countries this is the whole group here oh that was too quick go back about 17 different states and four different countries we had one from uh are you the boy from Spain but he's in Connecticut now brother from Spain uh a a girl from Ecuador she lives in Toronto now a couple two or three from London England and uh then all of our 17 States represented there and although we had rain all week um we just had rains of the Holy Spirit too and it was just such a super time in the Lord and the themes this week for the young people were just to summarize that the pre teaching was to encourage them that they have a purpose in their life God has a Divine Purpose for their life and not only that do they have a purpose and a design and a blueprint but they need to be confident in what God is leading them to do they need to be confident in their position and they need to be confident in what they do and they need to be confident that God has uniquely made them to do something and their personality and they need to be confident in how they worship don't worship like somebody else I think there was a real piece that set it over the young people that don't try to copy somebody else's worship and think I must not be okay cuz I'm not worshiping like that next person don't do that be confident in how God leads you to worship can I have an amen this morning and so I think that's a wonderful thing oh that's my friend and brother brother Barry coffee who helps us do it and uh so we just had a wonderful time I know there's just a few pictures and um but God really moved in each service and I just want to see a few images of that this morning let you see it that we give glory to almighty God young people 17 and up and looking and hungry for more of the word of God and to grow in Grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ and that is a real encouragement it puts fire under me to see in our generation the kind of young people that we have so Bound by the things of the world and to see young people set free to serve the Lord and uh there the new generation every generation has its Revival every generation God promised a Revival to the new generation and I believe that's happen I believe there's a mighty Army raising up there's a mighty Army to finish this work and I was so privileged to be a part of that this week and see that praise the Lord I want to uh let the local church here know that next Sunday we'll have the Lord's supper together at about 3:30 uh next Sunday afternoon so we're looking forward to that we wanted to welcome all the visitors

the glory all the honor all the praise Praise Jesus name amen amen can we give the Lord a hand of Praise [Music] hallelujah thank you musicians God bless each of you uh amen we really appreciate you I want to read a scripture if you don't mind standing with me uh we'll read a little bit from The Book of Luke amen The Book of Luke and um very familiar passage uh that we're we should all be very aware of and and and um talks about the birth of our Lord and our savior here in the Book of Luke 2:8 it says and there were in the same country sh shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock By Night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find a bab wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now uh even I mean go even unto to Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord ha made known unto us I I like just the the wording uh there uh these Shepherds that went to find the Christ child uh it was God that made it known to them and the way that he made it known to them is he sent them an angel praise the Lord amen there are certain things that we know and we would not know them if God had not sent us an angel a seventh angel Hallelujah and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning his child and and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all of the things all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated um forgot to mention I do bring you greetings from our home Church there in West Palm Beach Florida spirit and Truth Tabernacle I'm happy to have my wife sister Erica along with me and uh my daughter uh Sarah who sang amen they they come there but my my son-in-law and my daughter drove over from uh Indiana uh to be here in service brother Aaron and sister Rebecca amen we appreciate them amen this just a a portion of my family I got another daughter and son-in-law and two grandchildren back home in West Palm Beach so uh but we're happy to be here amen and and just uh finishing off the year amen here in Michigan God is good God is good I um I want to just talk on the subject of of worship amen uh on today we've been hearing a lot about that uh over the last couple days and uh just a really simple simple topic uh on on worship and uh but you know just a little uh little I guess underlying theme here in this topic is that we're worshiping based upon what we've seen and what we've heard amen based it's based upon what we have seen and what we have heard now the word worship means to reverence or render homage with body and mind amen and uh I'm I'm looking at this this uh definition from a um a little book that I have called key to the Bible and they they put Genesis 225 in there as a reference to this this definition reverence or render homage with body and mind and we'll we'll get to Genesis 225 in a little bit but uh one thing I I'll let me just go a little further here before I say that the anger Bible dictionary uh takes this worship word in Hebrew and the Hebrew word for it is shaha shaha it means to bow down or prostrate oneself before another in order to do him honor and reverence now and uh they refer to Psalms 95 and six we'll come to that in a second but let me just add this little thing here sometimes there is a joke amongst people today where they will come in contact with someone uh maybe a a famous status and then you have all these people that are just kind of y'all seen that I guess right am amen hopefully you're not doing that amen you've seen it but don't do that because our worship if we're going to bow down to anybody it's not going to be to another man it's not going to be to another woman the only person that gets our Glory that gets our worship that gets our praise is the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen but this this this you know uh this this this word uh Shaha in Hebrew that's worship is to bow down and prostrate oneself before another in order to do him honor and reverence and they made a statement here in the anger Bible dictionary says it is as natural to worship as it is to live it is as natural to worship as it is to live all right let's go on a little further uh the the the feeling and expression of high adoration reverence trust love loyalty and dependence upon on a higher power human or Divine is a necessity to man that is a part of the anger uh Bible dictionary definition brother brandom makes a I I like his definition on worship it says to worship is to express yourself to him oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen now uh I can't worship through you you can't worship through me amen but each one of us have to learn how express ourselves to him hey blessed be the name of the Lord now here you know um I I heard this statement worship is a verb and what that means worship does require action and I know we all worship differently nothing wrong with that don't don't get me wrong but it does require action right and and I'm going to read a couple scriptures that that help us understand what worship is I I want you to want you to realize it is an expression of yourself to the Lord Jesus if he's done anything worthy of your glory and worthy of your honor you ought to express that to him hallelujah amen you know uh many of you all during this season you probably got gifts and all that and you express your thanks hopefully am man you didn't just get a gift and then just look at the person no you you open your mouth with an expression of thank you Hallelujah and if the Lord Jesus has given you anything amen he's given you health he's given you strength he's given you a job he's given you a car amen he's put money in you in the bank he's giv you all these things you can at least come to church and say thank you Jesus everybody ought to be able to express something to the Lord let's let's let's let's let's let's read this uh worship is a verb that requires action and worship does require your participation all right here in Psalms 956 it says oh come let us worship and bow down amen let us kneel before the Lord our maker he deserves that amen another scripture here in in Psalms 100 and verse 1-5 it says and and and I and like this I I I like I like this song I mean this Psalm here because uh you know one of the uh one of the other things that uh actually let me go to Psalms 981 first before I say that Psalms 981 it says oh sing amen oh sing unto the Lord hallelujah for he ha done marvelous things his right hand and His holy arm have gotten him the Victory and and when we sing unto the Lord we don't sing like this that's not singing if you bought a CD if brother Paul said I got a new CD out and you uh and you went and you bought Brother Paul's CD but on the on on the CD all you heard was music but he says I got a new CD and I'm singing to the Lord but all you heard was music it's not singing if you don't hear the voice being projected hello somebody the Bible declares that we should sing unto the Lord amen so so so if a person just kind of gives you just uh if brother Paul says I got a new CD but he never sings That's not a a music CD that's an instrumental that's all that is that's an instrumental and it's okay for the the the musicians to to Worship the Lord on the instruments but when we sing we open our mouths and we say something to God and you can't even use the excuse that I don't know the words brother Jack so I can't sing they put the words on the screen and all you have to do is open your mouth and sing and then you might say well I don't really like the way I sound and somebody else is going to maybe pick at me when they hear me sing well this is the next scripture that sets you free from that Psalms 100 it says Make a Joyful Noise and look look it has to be joyful you can't you can't come with a sad count you got to make it joyful to God make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with everybody ought to be ready to open their mouths when they come into the house of the Lord You're not holier than the next brother when you just that doesn't make you holy amen singing is what God wants to hear and even if it's just a noise God wants to hear your noise your neighbor might not want to hear but let your neighbor know I'm not singing for you I'm not singing to you but this is my Joyful Noise unto God for all he has done for me I come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people in the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting his truth endureth to all generations from the reading of that scripture we see worship is done with an attitude of gratitude amen we come before the Lord's presence we singing we come with gladness we we we enter his gates with Thanksgiving Hallelujah and and and sometimes we come into the house of the Lord and it's hard to lift our hands sometimes it's hard to open our mouth because of some of the things that we're going through but we have to learn how to separate amen what we're going through and the god that we're serving I I I'm I'm a living witness that when you enter into worship and you begin to praise God uh sometimes your whole outlook begins a change on on what you're going through and and even there you might get a little inspiration that you might feel like hey I can make it through this thing I know the devil has me bombarded but I feel like I can overcome this I've seen people get healed in worship you know I shared the testimony a few times but we were a sister was streaming our service and um she was going through something and her her son was there dealing with cancer and uh and then all of a sudden this lady uh this sister she begin to develop a growth in her nose while her son is going through these chemo treatments and and uh and as she got this growth in the nose she went to the doctor and says I don't know what to do I don't know where this came from he says well we're going to have to do surgery in order to take care of that she's like I cannot go through surgery while my son is going through this I I I'm just going to have to endure what I'm going through and wait till he gets better before I would try to go to surgery because how am I going to take care of him if I'm trying to recover well well you know she she decided not to do the surgery at the time but she was at home and and uh and while she was at home streaming the service she started sweeping while she was streaming the service and when she when she start sweeping the dust begin to create a a little issue and caus her to sneeze so she sneezed uh really hard and and then it kind of Cs a second sneeze and when she sneezed the second time this thing whatever was in her nose came flying out the nose and she uh she says wow uh she says you know I'm breathing much better I think that that that thing is gone it's gone and and and she was in the in the house just just just just just worshiping your goodness is running after it's running after me that's that's what she was worshiping your goodness is running and I I mean in the midst of her worship God's goodness caught up with her and brought healing to her body nobody laid hands on her nobody prayed for her but she received her healing through her worship I want to tell you that's how powerful worship is this morning when you can come into God's presence with amen a Heart of Worship he can do great things for you she went to the doctor and the doctor said hey you know what happened she says uh you know I was sweeping and you know and this thing came flying out he says look is there any other anything in there you think you still need to do surgery look like we don't need to do surgery and uh the nurse said wow that must have been some sneeze and the sister said no no no no no that was some God this is what happens when you begin to worship when you worship with the right attitude amen here amen the other thing that the Bible tells us in Psalms 150 it says let everything that have breath praise the Lord so so so so so every Everybody when we come into the house of the Lord amen it's our expression to him you might not sing as loud as the other person my my wife is able to kind of discern who the song leaders are in the audience because what song leaders do while another song leaders up here singing they're doing all the ad lib in the audience that brother's a song leader that she can identify them just because that's what we do musicians do those things but we all Express express ourselves to God in different ways it doesn't matter how we do it it just as long as we we do it that's right here there was um a gentleman by the name of John Francis Wade and if you all have the the lyrics to this song Go come all you Faithful just pull those up for me I just want to tell the story about him John Francis Wade he um lived I believe in the 18th century there and he um he he wrote a song and the way he wrote this song he he made his living by copying manuscripts by hand and became famous for his artistic calligraphy he had an act for copying music as well and and they said Scholars debated whether Wade merely copied this Christmas hymn uh or whether he actually wrote it but recent Scholars indicate that he did in fact write the hymn now this man wrote this hymn and originally when it was written in Latin it was called adeste Fidelis and and Wade was a Roman Catholic and all services in the church were conducted in Latin Oh My My My amen uh in 1750 He Slipped this hymn into a manuscript he was copying for the English Roman Catholic college right in liis Buon Portugal over 30 years later so this man wrote the hym took the hym and slipped it into a manuscript 30 years later somebody found this and uh and they began to sing it in a in a Portuguese Chapel in in London and the Duke of Lees heard it sung there and included in the repertoire of his own singing group it soon became known all around the world and even today we still sing this song right and the the lyrics of the song says Oh Come are Ye Faithful joyful and triumphant Oh Come Ye Oh Come Ye to Bethlehem come and Behold Him born the king of angels and it says oh come let us adore him that means let's worship him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the lord yes that's what we come to do when we come to church we come to adore him and and then he wrote a second verse it says Sing choirs of angels and and now when we look at the scripture that we just read here in in in Luke Chapter 2 we realize it was the angels that began to sing at the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ brother brandom told us that when a king was born people would always sing Hallelujah but there was no earthly people there to sing when Christ was born but the Angels joined in after the message was given to the Shepherds the Angels joined in and they began to sing about our savior oh if if he he's that important that Angels would sing We ought to come to the house of God ready to sing sing choirs of Angels sing in exaltation oh sing All Ye citizens of Heaven above glory to God all glory in the highest oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him cry [Music] the Lord he goes with the third verse and I have to change just one word in this verse because I think he had just one thing off it says yes Lord we greet thee born this happy morning Jesus was not born on December 25th he was born Amen in the springtime right but we say born a happy morning all right Jesus to thee be all glory given but he did have something really remarkable in this verse look at this word of the father word of the father he he he sees Jesus as the word we see him the same way word of the father not only that now in flesh appearing and my question is who's flesh is he appearing in come on now he's appearing in your flesh he's appearing in my flesh amen now in flesh appearing oh come let us adore him come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ when you realize that he's appearing in your flesh when he's going beyond your faults and he's going beyond your mistakes he's going beyond all that and he's still appearing in your flesh you have something to worship him for brother Brandon makes a statement in the message the uncertain sound he says now notice in the human body or makeup our regular Anatomy that we live in here is not made to sin he says it's made to do righteous it's made to serve God it says God never made you just to work and come home and love your children all those are good things he said but God didn't just make you simply for that he says now that's all good enough God made you to work God made you to come home love your children love your wife the wife be loyal to and and love her husband the children love their father and mother that's all good he says but that is just background oh my amen loving your your family loving your wife loving your children amen going going to work paying the bills all of those things are just background amen amen uh for something that God made you to do all of that is background for something that God made you to do he says God made you to be a worshipper a worshipper of him you worship something regardless of what it is you worship your wife you worship your children you worship anything your autom you worship your pleasures you worship something because it's in mankind to worship now we want to know what we worship and we've seen this people worship their careers over God I mean it's always the job comes first before church we worship our careers sometimes we have family members that love to show up on the day that church right at the time church is going to start or I need to leave to get ready to go to church that's when they show up to visit and rather than you tell them I'm on my way to church would you like to go with me rather than say that you say well I I got caught up tonight I'm going have to stay home with the with the family you're worshiping your family you put your family before God Amen Church brother randam say you'll worship something we want to make sure that our worship is pointed in the right direction all of our worship goes to Christ let me go a little further with this he goes on he says Jesus told the woman at the well said you worship you know not what we Jews we worship we know what we know that we worship God because salvations of the Jew now and then the woman began to explain to him how once said in the mountain once at Jerusalem he said the hour is coming and now is when the father will seek worshippers who will worship Him in spirit and in truth for God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth mandatory that if we're going to worship we have to Worship in spirit and in truth now I um I like to to just say it like this when Jesus told this woman at the well that the father was looking for something to Worship in spirit and Truth worship was not related to a physical place it wasn't in the mountains of Samaria or in Jerusalem worship was found in spirit and truth and and and my question is where is Spirit and Truth now that's the name of my church and I'm not here saying you got to come to West Palm Beach to worship I'm not saying that that would be incorrect correct Worship in spirit and Truth is not a physical place but it is a spiritual place that you can only find in Christ but this is where God is accepting our worship it's it's found in spirit and Truth Now the children of Israel amen they worshiped a golden calf and that was not accepted God wasn't looking for that uh they they worship baale at one time and had to be restored back to the world worship of the one and true Living God God was not looking for them to worship B God wanted to worship himself right Cain's worship was not accepted you want to be sure that whatever you're giving God that it is being accepted Cain worship but it was not being accepted balam's altars were not accepted Dayan even built a church he says Moses you're not the only one that God is speaking to he's speaking to us too so uh Dayan built a tabernacle and and his Tabernacle got swallowed up in the earth God has a specific way that he wants us to worship that worship has to be in spirit and in truth look at this let's go a little further Adam and Eve would Worship in the cool of the evening Cain and Abel offered their sacrifices to worship God Abel's offerings were accepted but canes was rejected brother brandom says this and show us the father and it suffice says look in the beginning when C and Abel were returned from the garden their parents and they both seen that they were mortal beings and knowing they had to die Cain and Abel both of them wanted to worship God and Cain he built an altar to God now if an altar is all that God requires Cain was justified and Cain made a sacrifice upon the altar is that right well if a sacrifice and an altar is all God wants Cain was justified then Cain also he built an altar and he worshiped he put a sacrifice on it he he knelt down and worshiped God but God was displeased because he didn't come the right way and there's many churches today that are not coming the right way God wants Worship in spirit and in truth and let me just add this people that believe this message are people that are coming in spirit and in truth hallelujah and if there's ever a group of people people on the Earth that should offer God their worship it is people that believe this messag look at this he goes on to say this he says um but God was displeased because he didn't come the right way see he built the church an altar he put a sacrifice on the altar brought the fruits of the land was probably more beautiful you must watch this friends don't never forget this God did not accept what Cain was doing no matter how beautiful it was it was not accepted it was not in spirit and it was not in truth I was looking at this word worship so we find it in Genesis and we find it also in the Book of Revelations All Through the Bible but I wanted to find hey where was the first time this word was mentioned we know that Cain and Abel worshiped we know that Adam worshiped we know Eve worship they came and they did that but where was the word itself ever found in scripture Genesis 225 now before we read this scripture the background of this is that Abra abam has been waiting for 25 years to have a son that God promised him he finally gets his son I mean can you imagine Sarah uh you know 90 years old and carrying this baby and you know and and and and all that she went through to bring forth uh uh Isaac and um you know they finally got the promise it was manifested before their very eyes God had touched their bodies and did all these great things miraculous things they finally got the child and and Abraham one day wakes up and says uh Isaac and I uh are going to be leaving now I'm pretty sure the Bible does not State this but I'm married and I understand how this works and and and and and I'm pretty sure that Abraham did not tell Sarah what was getting ready to happen especially a woman 90 years old giving birth to this baby and now you're getting ready to take my son and do what no no no that will not happen I can I can just I can imagine him not telling Sarah what was giv ready to happen not only that when we read this verse we'll see that Abraham is actually telling amen some things to even his servants he kept this thing secret from everybody look at it in verse 22 I mean uh chapter 22: 5 it says and Abraham said unto his young men i b ye here with the ass and I and the L will go Yonder and worship ship and come again to you now this is a prophetic word that Abraham is speaking and look God never told Abraham to say this Abraham said it by faith Abraham did not know how God was going to do but he knew that uh that in in Isaac this uh the world would be blessed through the seed he knew something had to happen he didn't know what was going to happen but me and the young man were going to go and worship I want to tell you something about about this worship sometimes will demand a sacrifice sometimes you you got to force yourself to open your mouth and give God glory now even when you don't feel like praising him you still got to give him praise sometime you you have to adjust your attitude when you're coming into the house of God sometimes it requires a tremendous sacrifice I think that when God has pleased the most with our Aroma of Praise Abraham speaks these words and he goes on up the mountain and and and Isaac is packing the wood up the mountain and Ma he's bringing it up he's like you know wait he says okay we see I see the wood I see the fire but Dad where is the sacrifice and Dad you want me to worship now you mean to tell me I'm the sacrifice oh my my my my my my can I can I tell you something when you come into the house of God you do become the sacrifice and you know the Bible says present your bodies a Living Sacrifice sir holy and acceptable unto God that is the way to worship amen Isaac is wondering where is this sacrifice and he says look son God will provide for himself a sacrifice but somehow Isaac had to bring himself to yielding to what his dad needed at that moment as Sons I don't know how God's going to do this but I know there's a promise laying on you God's going to do it somehow but let's just go through the process when he lays him down there God says okay Abraham Abraham he called out of Heaven says I know you love me don't do any harm to your son Isaac there is a ram over here in the bush you can take that RAM and offer him in Isaac's dead when we we think about the ram the the Lamb of God the ram of God that was offered in our stead it ought to bring us to a place of worship I am sure Isaac had a thank you Lord glory to God hallelujah nobody would have to make Him worship God anymore after an experience like that worship must be pointed in the right direction in Genesis 225 we find the first time where this word worship is mentioned in revelation 22 verse 8-9 we find the word worship mentioned again there in scripture in the last book of the Bible the last chapter of the last book of the Bible we see something here worship must be pointed in the right direction look at this and I John saw these things and heard them and when I heard them when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me who sayith the angel says unto John and now John represents Us in the Scripture it says then said he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy brother and the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God here the angel is telling John no don't worship a prophet don't worship a fellow servant don't worship a holy man don't worship a holy woman don't worship your pastor don't worship the evangelists don't worship the teachers don't worship the apostles don't worship the prophet worship God we know exactly where our worship where we pay our homage to it goes to God and God Alone we may quot a prophets but we don't worship a prophet I may quote Spurgeon but I don't worship Spurgeon amen there's times that I quoted Billy Graham but I don't worship Billy Graham I've quoted Oral Roberts and I don't worship Oral Roberts I worship Jesus Christ Amen brother brandom told us no true Prophet would would be worshiped no messenger of any kind would stand to be worship if you see a pastor or a minister or anybody uh uh looking for that worship and we have it right here in the messages all over other places people just worship their Pastor it's unbelievable carry them on their shoulder to the pull pit and what is this this this is this is false amen and I seen people just get completely offended cuz somebody rebuke them for for the worship that they're getting the word of God rebukes you for that that's right and they get offended and want to put out videos they might hear me say this and they put out a video I me who brother Jack think he is I'm I'm just a brother stand with the word of God I am going to worship God I will worship no man no man Hallelujah we have to pour our worship in the right direction here um I want to just drill back we were reading there in Luke Chapter 2 where the Shepherds now you got to understand these Shepherds would have would have never known where Christ was had not an angel come to them and shared this information they would have just been in their fields just doing whatever they do as Shepherds but but it's because a supernatural event curtain Angel showed up brought them a a message told them exactly where they would find Christ what he would look like everything they gave him all the details a angel had to give them that and when they got the message from the angel I love verse uh verse verse2 as we we read it uh Luke 2:20 earlier it said the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them what triggered worship from the Shepherds was the things that they heard and the things that they seen the things they heard from the angel that caused them to go to amen the uh uh uh I mean the stable and find them in the manger the the the things they the things they heard caused them to go there but when they saw him this is what really triggered the worship they worshiped based on what they heard and what they seen they were elected they were chosen people to be able to see the Savior I mean what an opportunity of course when when you've been chosen out of all the people on the Earth to go and lay eyes on the Savior it should produce worship but they're not they're not the only ones that produce worship because of what they seen and what they heard let's pick up the story amen as it's found in Matthew Chapter 2 now one of of the things about the Christmas season is that they always bring these guys in at the at the stable but he was they never showed up at the stable that's right now just it's just it's just reading the Bible we can see I think I think um unfortunately you know people have just put the scene together and we just people just think it's the right thing but according to the Bible is not these three Magi did not come until Jesus was roughly 2 years old amen the the the the the Shepherds came on the night that he was born the Angels sing on the night that he was born but but that's all that was dare worshiping but the Magi came later on and now let's let's pick this up in in Matthew Chapter 2 let's just read this really quick we got time amen I I love the word of the Lord here it says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem say say where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east and are come to worship Him Now notice they are based on what they sing the star in the east is what's drawing them to Jerusalem to come and worship they're coming bring their worship based on what they sing now here's the other thing the star stop shining when it got to Jerusalem the star didn't appear again until they actually got to the exact spot where Christ was right but here the star LED them to what I call proximity oh my my my my but as we read the rest of the scripture we're going to realize that it was the revelation of the word oh my that actually brought them into the presence of Christ the star brought them into proximity but the Revelation brought them into presence Hallelujah you see the star we had a star in this day we have seen his star amen he had a star a seventh angel a star according to Revelation 1 and 2 and three amen a a star God had in the land we seen a star we recognize that but we've come to worship Christ the star brings us into amen proximity but the revelation brings us into the presence of God let's keep reading here verse two saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophets so now they're going back to the word right thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for uh for out of these shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel they found it in the word they found where Christ was to be born by the word the star LED them to proximity but once they got the revelation of the word it sent them into his presence watch this now then Herod when he had privy called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for this for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also from this statement we can see that not everybody comes into the house of God with the same intention as others right young sister that young man that wants to come to church because you go to that church he might not be here with the right intentions you're coming to worship and get closer to God he's coming to watch and get get closer to you young brother is the same thing amen the liila will come to church but she's coming not to get closer to God she's coming to get closer to you watch everybody's not coming with the same intention you want to make sure you find somebody has the same intention as you that loves God more than they love you look at that verse uh verse 8 again he sent to he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was see it led them to proximity they got the word revealed to them when they got to Jerusalem and now they could come into the very presence of the Lord and they're coming they have one purpose for coming we they took I don't know how long the journey was but their Journey their purpose in their Journey was so that we could go to worship young people when you came to the youth retreat I I hope your purpose was to come to worship now if God blesses me with something on top of my worship that's fine amen I hope you understand what I'm saying but my first and foremost objective I'm coming to worship I might come from South Africa but I'm coming to worship I might come from London I'm coming to worship from West Palm Beach I'm coming to worship from Tennessee from Indiana wherever Georgia I am coming to worship he these these these these these uh wise men that come with this intention that they're going to worship look at this the Bible says in when they saw the the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house see he wasn't in a Manger he was in the house at this time when they come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him they expressed themselves to him and worshiped him and when they had open their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and Frances and M I want to ask you what gift do you have in you that you can surrender to the Lord that's a form of worship God you've placed this in me this gift is in me I want to give that back to you and I want to do the best of my ability For Your Glory oh my singing is a form of worship clapping our hands is a form of worship lifting our hands is a form of worship I've been to this church and I've seen people take take off and run around the building that is a form of worship and even sometimes just sitting in the pews and saying Amen to the word of God is a form of worship everybody participate we have something to participate for we participate because of what we've seen and what we've heard look at this these these these um Magi based on what they saw they saw a star in the east and when they got to Jerusalem they heard the word reveal and based on what they seen and what they heard they begin to bring the gifts to the Lord here in verse uh verse 11 again when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened the treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense of my and being warned of God in the dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way there's another one I don't know if I got any group eight uh people that's here here but we talked about that in our devotion you you when you when you went into the house of let me just read that Ezekiel 469 put that up there really quick let me just read it I think it's e Ezekiel 46 and9 just want to uh share this with you uh when um the children of Israel would go to worship God gave them very specific instructions we have it okay Ezekiel 46 and9 I believe that's the right one my daughters can tell me whether I'm right or not I'm reading from the screen okay there we go when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the solemn feasts he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate he shall not return by the way of the gate where by he came in but shall go forth over against it so if you came in through the north gate you couldn't go back out the north gate you had to come in the north gate and go out the south gate if you came in through the south gate you couldn't just go back out the south gate no you had to go back out the north gate and what this is simply saying is that you can't come in and leave the same way you came that's right and even even you see it here with with with with these Magi they might have come in one way but they went out another way Hallelujah and that's exactly what God wants us to do brother brandham told us that when we come to church we leave one of two ways Better or Worse make it your determination every time I come into the house of God no matter who's preaching I'm leaving better they worship based on what what they seen what they heard brother brandham was very clear when he told us these gifts that they brought gold was representing his deity as king of kings Frankin say represents a service offering you always use this a man when you were doing a service offering use frankincense in that offering Leviticus 2:2 uh talks about it Leviticus 16: 6-15 talks about it and brother R says we find out that's the order of the priesthood to make an offering to Jehovah when he made the offering it had to be made and mixed with frankincense for a sin offering they took different things and mixed it for the meal offering for the wave offering frankincense was added because it was accepted acceptable to Jehovah if it was anointed with frankincense which means it's a service to Jehovah and the final thing that the Magi brought was myrr and that myrr was an anointing for death and here they're bringing it to this this this Christ child what this is Amen brother brandom tells it says it was deity in service to die now let me let me just ask this question do you think the the the the the Magi I mean I'm sorry the uh uh well Magi as well as the Shepherds didn't have the complete understanding of what was getting ready to happen with this child here here the the uh the shepherds are told there's a a savior that is Bor and maybe in their mind they're thinking somebody to Deliver Us from the Roman Empire no no no no this is someone to deliver you from sin they did not have any idea who this child really was and not only amen uh uh they worship just because of his birth they worship because this child was born because they saw a star in the east they worship because of those things but we worship for something far greater than what they worship for it's not just that he was born it's not just that he lived amen it's not just that he died but he rose again they did not get a chance to see those but we on the other side of it we get a chance to see this is what drives our worship we worship based on what we see and what we heard yes sir oh Hallelujah we got a greater perspective we got a greater Vision we got a broader picture yes which produ produces a greater worship we're not the only ones in this condition let me just read a couple things here for you this is out of the Church of the Living God brother random says when alone came the Virgin born Divine Son of God he was God's provided lamb provided sacrifice Jehovah Gyra the provided one and that he was born and people of that day of his day especially the religious people did not believe him because he never come in a classical way that they expected him but he came humble born in a manger wrapped in swallen cloths there was no singing at his birth as there is a king's birth Mortals when the king is born the people sing and have a jubilee but there was no King no people to sing at this king's birth but the Angels came down and sang to the shepherds in the city of David is born Christ the Savior and I and I'm going tell you when those angels start singing I don't think they had their mouths closed those Shepherds heard something they heard something that that changed their lives revolutionized their lives and let me tell you what we have heard in this hour through the revelation of the word it should produce a worship amen let's look at something here and and and and I want to read a scripture and and um I'll find a way to get out brother Brandon makes some comments about Revelation chapter 5 in the sermon Revelation 5 part 2 he says the seven and last one of the seals of these seals when they're open it's found in Revelations the 10th chapter there was a mighty Angel which was Christ came down and put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and raised up his hands and says the day is finished time has run out it's all over time shall be no more it says and he said at the sounding at this time the mystery of God should be finished who God is how he was made manifest how when that seal was open how we begin to understand now how that he was the son of God he was God himself made flesh I like to say this we we we know the scripture says so God for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but often times we misunderstand what he's really trying to say right it wasn't that God just sent his son come on it was God became the son in order to die for our sins he had to come in a robe of Flesh this is why we worship him because he became the son he was a spirit first but he became flesh so he could die for us it wasn't him sending his son he became the son amen amen look at this look at this Hallelujah who God is see we know who he is how he was made manifest God is not three different people amen he's one person Hallelujah this is why we're we're sure about baptism right even when Jesus himself says be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost so many churches say we're doing it exact exactly the way Jesus said do it but then Peter 10 days after Jesus speak this he says be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promises unto you amen your children those that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call how could Peter get it wrong after 10 days on I always like to ask that question did Peter get it wrong or did he really get it right on I I I I let you know today he got it right Peter understood who the son was first he was walking with the son he was talking with the son he knew who the Son of God was he could put the other two pieces of the puzzle together if if if this is the Son and Jesus said when you seen me youve seen my father he knew who the father was he knew who the Holy Spirit was they was the same person one God and his name is Lord Jesus Christ that's right that's worshiping in spirit amen and in truth that's right that's serving in spirit and interest amen who God is how he was made manifest how when that seal was open how we begin to understand now how that he was the son of God he was God himself made flesh and the revelation of who he is that should be finished before this angel can put his feet upon the land and sea and swear that there'll be no more uh when when this time comes we're right in that front yard of it right now now brother brandom is saying this in 1961 we're in the front yard of while he was on the earth we're in the front yard I'm telling you we're all over the are now look at this it says the last one of them is revelation 10 foot on the land and on the sea time had run out Redemption is over and now he comes in as a lion he was a lamb then now he comes in as a lion to of the tribe of Judah stay with me just for a little bit longer look at this he says now let me just read just the rest of this so I can get it to you right quick now and the eighth verse now I'm going to go back and read the whole chapter in a second but I wanted you to just catch his commentary on the eth verse I'm going to Revelation 5 in a second he says this when he had taken the book The Four beasts TW the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and go golden vows full of odors and prayers of the Saints now this is the commentary now this is the time when everything must be worshiped hold up now I want us to make sure we get this Jesus uses terms like ye must be born again that means there is no other option there is no other alternative ye must not ye must go to church Church you must build an altar you must no no you must be born again before you can worship he must be born again right brother brandom uses the same term that after the seals have been opened after all these Revelations that come forth according to the scripture he says now amen it says uh this is a time when everything must be worshiped let everything that have breath praise the Lord it must be be worship Oh My My My I I pray as we go into the the new year amen we won't have anybody coming to church like this no no no no no do have you heard what I was saying based on what we hear and what we see that's why we enter into worship look at what it says it says this is the time when everything must be worshiped now remember how appropriate don't let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of the church agents was finished when all the mysteries of the Plan of Redemption then Seven Seals was open right immediately after this now look it's time for everything in heaven and everything on Earth to worship god let's go and read it out of Revelation 5 based on what we have seen based on what we have heard it should produce a sincere worship yes every time the church doors open you ought to be ready to worship I'm not feeling well in my body he still deserves the praise and the reason he deserves it is because I still have breath in my body and the Bible said let everything that have breath praise the Lord sometimes you have to adjust your attitude that's right sometimes it requires a sacrifice that's right but I I I don't care what I'm going through I got enough in me to give God a thank you Jesus Hallelujah glory to your name I at least got that much in me in my tank I got enough to say praise you father every ought everybody ought to be that way brother brandom refers back to Revelation 5 and I want us to read this and I'll uh find a way to get out here soon let me just take a little sip of water oh blessed be the name of the Lord Revelation 5 it says this and I saw in the right hand of him now when when we're reading this we have to see that John is representing Us in this chapter and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within a book written Within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on this was a hopeless situation verse four says ' and I wept much John began to cry because of what he saw here I we wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither looked there on let me let me tell you John looked he saw Abraham wasn't worthy he saw Isaac wasn't worthy he saw Jeremiah Isaiah habach all all of these Micah Malachi all of these people nobody was worthy John saw you you weren't worthy John saw brother brandom he wasn't worthy John be to cry because no one was worthy to take this book verse four again and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on the Shepherds worship because of what they heard what they sing the Magi worship because of what they heard they saw I mean what they saw the star and then they heard the word when they got to Jerusalem they heard the word revealed they went to worship based on what they saw what they heard we're going to find John is in the the same position he's going to worship because of what he heard and what he saw he saw no man worthy but here now he hears something look at this verse verse verse five and one of the elders sath unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now he he says the lion of the tribe of Judah right so now so so here he heard that but now verse six and I be hell and lo in the midst of the throne uh of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb so what he heard was that a lion prevailed but when he saw he saw a lamb Hallelujah when you see the lamb and what the lamb has done for you it will produce a worship look at this a lamb as it had been slain amen having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four and uh the four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and brother Brandon say when when we got to that part he says everybody ought to be entering into worship this is a time that everybody should be worshiping based on what we have heard and what we've seen we ought to be able to worship am I like this and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take this take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made unto uh made us unto our Gods Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth I want to just say something here I'm going to read a little further in there I'm going to read the whole chapter in a second we only a few more verses but I want to just stop and say John worshiped because of what he heard and what he seen John represents us John John John saw this whole thing unfold he he saw I mean and I'm going to tell you another thing about John when John saw that there was no one worthy to take this book what what it just he knew that that that that all creation was finished if nobody would step forth and take this book so when he heard that the lion of the tribe of Judah ha prevailed and then he turned and looked and saw a lamb John began to worship and way that was unbelievable we'll read it in a little bit but it was unbelievable worship based on what he seen and based on what he heard amen John began to worship verse n said and they sung a new song I was at a church recently and and um brother Burley Williams made a comment I was at his church and he said you know that new song is songs that only message people can write because they're writing based on what they have heard and what they see and and and they begin to write songs that can't be sung in the average denominational church because they wouldn't understand the lyrics Hallelujah so so here at literal life I know there have been a number of new songs that have been written not only here Amen in literal life but uh I'm sure all over my daughters have written songs and amen my I have an aunt sister Brenda Lewis she wrote some songs my mom sister Ellen bur she's written some songs but I just wanted to go down just a little short list of some new songs we are the generation we're the culmination the final voice the world will hear everybody can't say that the coming of the the Lord is near leing out the Revelation overcoming sins Temptation the truth we go to Every tongue and Nation we who who who who who we who we we are the chosen generation sister Sharon wrote the same God sister Gabby wrote girls let's be girls brother Wesley wrote I'm GNA turn up my praise and drown out the doubt my aunt sister Bren she said he chose me in denominations they can't sing that the way we can sing that he chose me my sister uh my my daughter sister re says I just believe I'm not questioning this I'm not wondering about this I just simply believe my mom wrote a song that she sings everywhere she goes I'm still still still pressing my battle my mom wrote another song that sister Sher took and put it on one of her one of her albums and I think this song is so important mom mom wrote it years and years ago but it was a song titled save me from my airing way restore me to the faith I pray What Faith with all the people walking away from the message they need to hear a song like this Lord save me from my airing way restore me to the faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints restore me to that faith I pray brother Wesley wrote just another day hallelujah amen uh my aunt my my aunt sister Louis she wrote a song it's gonna take her Hallelujah to keep me from my promises it's going to take a Hallelujah to turn me around it's going to take a Hallelujah because my feet are on Solid Ground what Solid Ground are we standing on it's the word of God we worship because of what we seen and what we heard another one that's gone all over the world they might be singing this one in denominations now I don't know we don't sung it everywhere I'm sure denomination people have heard and they might have took it but it says I feel the pull I hear the call I don't even I don't know if they know what they're singing about and I know his spirit's moving me to give my all he speaks to me and I agree Lord please come take control I feel the pool that's a bride song that's a new song another one uh uh Rejoice Look What the Lord Has Done amen uh another one a little sister in my church wrote just just breathe just breathe amen don't get all worked up just breathe amen uh sister Abby Morales wrote that uh a sister my church also she wrote a song I can hardly wait till the church doors open to the singing and the shouting and the praying begins amen and then she says this I can hardly wait until the minister steps forward come on come on what's the rest of that H Spirit and the Holy Spirit starts to descend now now now now now most people go to church they can't wait for the the choir to step forward and it's okay we want the choir to worship I want to join the choir right but we want the choir to worship but it's it's not that we don't come to church just to hear the choir we come to hear the word amen now I don't lean too far on the other side we say well we don't need no choir anymore no no no no no everybody can't have a brother Kenny in their church amen but everywhere he go he he get a choir together and they just sound a awesome I be like I got to sing with them just just give me a part please if that's what heaven going to be like I'm going to be right there singing cuz the preacher going to stop in heaven if you can't sing here how you going to sing in heaven brother Isaiah Brooks wrote a song grant that every day that you will commune with me brother brother Wesley asks us what is that you have in your hand yeah sister amariah said here I stand sister Sher say Make It Count make it matter and I'm going tell you probably my favorite one for this season of my life and I know the the the church world can't sing this one but I'm going to try to get me a part on this one y'all some of y'all might not know this one but it's new I want to encourage you buy the CD it's a really good CD it says who is this MDC King the Ary brother Ike can I get a part can I get a part I'm auditioning that song Amen is only a song a new song that only the bride can sing We Know Who MDC is they still trying to find out who he is but we singing about him we worshiping him Oh my he always has and always will be and here he he lives in me see see see when you start thinking about what God has done and how he's living in you that's why that last verse on the song Oh Come All Ye Faith was so important cuz the man said yay I mean uh John Francis way said yay uh yeah yay Lord we greet thee born a happy morning Jesus to to thee be all glory given word of the father now in flesh appearing whose flesh we recognize where he is and and and and and and because of that brother bradam tells us a little statement that I want to read in closing because we know this we have to point our worship in the right direction I'm going to give you a quote so you can get it pointed in the right direction look at this out of the message the deity of Jesus Christ and that same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalist let the people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right he says men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil Devil's trying to hide you back and tell you you're some little Trot down something you're not your sons and daughters of God look at this statement the deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah I know you think think I'm crazy but I I I let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being Hallelujah he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frog life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created Created everything and nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought PL and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions amen he quenched the violence of the fire they escaped the edge of the sword they rais the Dead from the G who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity and brother sister that deity is in you a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you I I need you to repeat that after me just say after I'm I'mma count to three and I want you to say Christ in me one two three Christ in me now I need you to encourage somebody the person next to you on the count of three say Christ and you make sure you touch them let them know 1 2 3 Christ in you deity hallu brother Ram said Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the the hope of Life The Creator God himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we we shall see him as he is for we'll be made like him in the in the spirit in the human being yes you're talking about worshiping in spirit and Truth the only people that could do that is the people that know who they are in Christ they don't just they don't you know it's a life they live on a daily basis it becomes songs that they sing come on and so when those songs start going forth here in this church I tell you what everybody ought to be lifting their voices come before his presence with singing tonight they said it's going to be a a a a little time of worship just just some testimonies and some songs uh I look forward to it amen I mean going into the the next year actually praising my God they say the way you start off the year is the way you end the year I want to start by praising him and I want to end by praising him and all throughout the year I want my life to be just total worship to godall let's pray father based on what we have seen in scripture based on what we have heard through the revelation of scripture it has produced a life that wants to worship that realizes that we need to express ourselves to you God and we don't have to have the greatest voice but you told us to make a Joyful Noise because you just enjoy hearing us just as we enjoy hearing you we enjoy seeing you you enjoy hearing us so God we bring our worship to you we bring our adoration we bring our praise because you alone deserve it John saw a hopeless situation but God when he heard the the elders say don't don't weep John don't weep the lion of the tribe of Judah ha [Music] prevailed he's the one that's taken the book and he's loosing the seals of John realized a man uh uh how important that was and it caused them to turn to a place of worship God help us Lord this morning to be able to see God that John represented us and we ought to be able to turn to a place of worship even when it's from a place of sacrifice we give it to you Jesus because you alone deserve it I pray your blessings upon these Saints I play pray your blessings upon this church God that you would just continue to use them and to write these new songs that we could sing to your honor to your glory we give you Praise Jesus amen I didn't really finish reading Revelation 5 so let me just finish that really quick verse 9 says they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and Tong and people and nation and has made us into our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth It also says and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands sang with a loud voice now this is what John heard Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing but I told you John did something that nobody's ever done I've never heard anybody worship God like this verse 13 says every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I say blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne based on what John saw what John heard it cused him to enter into worship and unto the lamb forever and ever verse 14 and the four beasts said amen I'm going tell you when you get start worshiping other people will join you the four be said amen and the 4 and20 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and ever he's worthy of the praise Hallelujah I like that
