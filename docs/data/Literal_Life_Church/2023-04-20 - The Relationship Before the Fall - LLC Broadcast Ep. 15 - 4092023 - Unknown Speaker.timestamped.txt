[0:48] you may think I'm perfect but I'm not

[4:05] verse 21 and the Lord God calls this
[4:08] deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[4:10] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[4:13] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[4:16] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[4:18] from man made he a woman and brought her
[4:22] unto the man so God did all of this and
[4:25] then he separated into him into two
[4:26] vessels they started out as one Spirit
[4:29] created in the image of God which God's
[4:31] a spirit so man was a spirit man first
[4:34] and then chapter two then he he breathes
[4:38] the breath of life into a vessel uh Adam
[4:42] and both the feminine both Adam and Eve
[4:43] were in that one vessel then he made him
[4:45] a vessel so that was the next stage and
[4:47] now he takes something out of Adam a rib
[4:49] out of Adam and he makes a second vessel
[4:51] so now you have the same The Same Spirit
[4:54] masculine and feminine and also part of
[4:57] the nature of God and now you have two
[4:59] vessels though but still one and notice
[5:01] what God does this and then he brings
[5:03] this woman to the man after after this
[5:05] sleep and he performs surgery on him and
[5:08] and and brings this one now he brings
[5:10] the woman and now Adam's going to speak
[5:12] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[5:15] bones and flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[5:18] called woman because she was taken out
[5:21] of man
[5:22] therefore shall a man leave his father
[5:24] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[5:26] wife and they shall be one flesh now
[5:29] this is an interesting way to look at it
[5:31] because we know that they're standing
[5:34] there now as two vessels so we could say
[5:36] in our minds no they're not one flesh
[5:39] they're two two vessels
[5:42] but the Oneness is so strong and they're
[5:44] still of one spirit that the conclusion
[5:46] to God and the conclusion to Adam is
[5:49] there's still one flesh
[5:51] and I want you to catch something in
[5:53] this in speaking about relationships
[5:55] because if we catch this then the way
[5:58] that we look at one another
[6:01] will be changed and they were both naked
[6:03] the man and his wife and were not
[6:05] ashamed I'd like to bring in the New
[6:07] Testament in second Corinthians chapter
[6:09] 5 Second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[6:12] 14.
[6:14] For the Love of Christ constrainteth us
[6:18] because we thus judge that if one died
[6:21] for all then we're all dead
[6:25] spiritually speaking now uh we we see
[6:28] what Paul's saying that there's the love
[6:31] of Christ is motivating us and he's he's
[6:33] really going to be talking about how we
[6:35] look at one another how we look at
[6:37] others the love of Christ constraineth
[6:39] us because we thus judge if one if one
[6:42] died for all then we're all dead how
[6:44] many know we're all in the same state we
[6:46] all need the Lord and then when he went
[6:48] to death that we could die to ourself we
[6:51] all die to ourselves and the new man
[6:53] comes to life if that happens within the
[6:55] Holy Ghost filled Believers then we have
[6:57] if God looks at it that way we have to
[7:00] look at it that way that we've all died
[7:03] to our old man in Christ and the new man
[7:06] is living in this brother or sister I'm
[7:09] looking at if we look at the old man if
[7:11] we keep looking at the flesh we'll be
[7:13] stumbled
[7:15] God's not stumbled at looking at us he
[7:17] can Overlook our flesh he looked beyond
[7:19] our faults and seen our need
[7:22] I'm glad God's not looking at my flesh
[7:24] today so if God's looking at us that way
[7:26] then we have to begin to see and this is
[7:28] what he talks about whether he says uh
[7:32] and they excuse me if one died for all
[7:34] then we're all dead and that he died for
[7:36] all that they would which live should
[7:38] not henceforth live unto themselves but
[7:41] unto him which died for them rose again
[7:42] wherefore henceforth from now on from
[7:45] henceforth know we no man after the
[7:50] flesh
[7:52] he's picking up the original principle
[7:55] that he could look at two vessels Adam
[7:57] can look at her as a different vessel
[7:59] now but he still said she's she's one
[8:01] flesh with me it's still one flesh and
[8:03] he doesn't even look at the flesh he's
[8:05] looking at we're one in spirit
[8:07] okay so and and so wherefore henceforth
[8:11] know we no man after the flesh yea
[8:15] though we know have known Christ after
[8:17] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[8:19] no more so he's fulfilled his fleshly
[8:22] body days Paul knew Jesus in a deeper
[8:25] way by the mystery of Christ even
[8:26] greater than the disciples Paul never
[8:28] seen Jesus In the Flesh we would think
[8:30] all the disciples they got a higher
[8:32] position they were with him and fished
[8:34] with him in the flesh but he said Paul
[8:36] actually had a greater Revelation or a
[8:38] greater view of Christ and he never seen
[8:40] him in the flesh
[8:41] so we move to this mystery of what it's
[8:45] not that you see what's going on in the
[8:46] flesh but you see the mystery behind it
[8:50] let me finish this wherefore henceforth
[8:52] know we know man after the flesh yea
[8:54] though we know we have known Christ
[8:56] after us yet now henceforth know we him
[8:59] no more therefore If any man be in
[9:02] Christ he is a new creature old things
[9:06] are passed away and behold all things
[9:09] are become New Calvary has opened the
[9:12] way to bring us back into relationship
[9:15] again and these are foundational
[9:17] statements many of you know them but I'm
[9:18] assuming maybe many don't because I I
[9:21] need you to catch the foundation I want
[9:23] to tell you again that everything that
[9:25] the fall brought in the beginning
[9:26] Calvary has the power to restore us back
[9:30] to all of it again God is taking us back
[9:33] to Eden again and he's not stopping
[9:35] halfway with you he's taking us all the
[9:37] way back before the fall he's reversing
[9:40] all everything can you say Amen so if
[9:42] you've got broken relationships and
[9:43] you've got broken things and you've come
[9:45] from baggage in your family and all
[9:47] kinds of divorce and everything like
[9:49] that that's all as a result of the Fall
[9:51] can you say man but I'm here to tell you
[9:54] in our soul level and then God bringing
[9:56] us back to New bodies the power of
[9:58] Calvary is restoring us back to
[10:01] everything that has been lost
[10:04] amen so that is Calvary and so Christ
[10:07] died and he made a way to come back into
[10:09] Union by the Holy Ghost and that is the
[10:12] only way and the only basis for coming
[10:16] back into relationship with God can you
[10:18] say Amen the only basis into coming back
[10:21] into relationship with God is Not Just
[10:23] Calvary because Calvary took care of our
[10:26] sins so that we could receive the spirit
[10:28] of God it is only by receiving the holy
[10:31] ghost that we come into contact and
[10:33] relationship with God that we lost in
[10:36] the garden it's not by religion it's not
[10:38] by do's and don'ts it's not by what you
[10:41] wear it's not by some denomination it's
[10:44] not by shaking the preacher's hand it's
[10:46] not by doing good works there's only one
[10:48] thing that would bring us back into
[10:50] relationship that Adam and Eve lost and
[10:53] that's that we receive his spirit and
[10:55] his nature in our soul
[10:58] that is the only way back in the
[11:00] relationship now I know people can say
[11:02] well I talk to the Lord I love the lord
[11:03] it's interesting on the street if you
[11:05] ask somebody if they love Christ most
[11:07] people will say yes there's no evidence
[11:09] in their life they don't love the word
[11:11] they're not they're not ever around the
[11:12] word but if you just said I love the law
[11:14] I love oh sure I love the Lord do you
[11:16] pray of course I pray but you see now
[11:19] that's not the relationship Adam and Eve
[11:21] had there's there's a relationship
[11:23] that's a Oneness by Nature that you come
[11:26] back into that is not just a religion
[11:28] that you pray and you hope God answers
[11:31] back this is a God that answers back and
[11:34] you say amen and one of the ways he
[11:36] answers you back is to fill you with the
[11:38] holy spirit that you have the same
[11:40] desire that is in this Bible to live the
[11:43] word
[11:46] and there's no bucking up against it
[11:48] there's no rebellion in your soul
[11:49] there's no desire says I want part of
[11:52] this and I want that's what people do is
[11:53] micromanage parts of the message by the
[11:55] way I want this no all that's gone but
[11:57] the Holy Ghost and down here it says I'm
[11:59] ready to submit to the word of God I'm
[12:01] ready because I love him because I want
[12:03] him I I love him so much
[12:08] the only way the only grounds of
[12:10] Fellowship that God has ever laid down
[12:13] for himself in his church is the Oneness
[12:15] of himself in the people that's the only
[12:17] grounds of fellowship and the only way
[12:19] that you can have those grounds is by a
[12:22] union to be United with him forever and
[12:25] that Union takes place by the filling of
[12:30] the Holy Ghost
[12:31] everybody in agreement not by religion
[12:34] not because you go to a message Church
[12:38] you only come back in contact with an
[12:40] Eden relationship by the true Holy Ghost
[12:45] so now it's by spirit that we're joined
[12:48] together in this Union no other way to
[12:51] be in Oneness with God there is no other
[12:53] way you can try the ways you can try
[12:55] works you can try mental discipline you
[12:59] can try vows the Catholic Church makes
[13:02] vows of poverty the Catholic church has
[13:04] pennants they're the first one who begin
[13:06] to develop ways to try to get in
[13:08] relationship with God through works you
[13:10] do pennants uh you do you you you pray
[13:13] the rosary you take vows of poverty and
[13:17] that's why Luther was so distraught
[13:19] because he tried all of his life to do
[13:20] this he was if you watch the movie or
[13:22] study of his life you become distraught
[13:24] uh Mother Teresa was the same way if you
[13:27] watch or die read her diaries now this
[13:30] is available this is a woman that
[13:32] actually died without peace and without
[13:33] settled in God and she's a hero as far
[13:37] as what she did in India in places with
[13:40] how she served and all of her life she
[13:42] served as that was the way her entrance
[13:44] and relations with God but if you read
[13:46] her Diaries she's a she's a dying woman
[13:49] and she's a woman who never ever felt
[13:51] satisfied and made contact with God now
[13:54] I'm not putting her out of Heaven I
[13:55] wouldn't do that I don't have a right to
[13:56] do that but what I'm saying to you is
[13:57] that you can do all the works and be a
[14:00] hero in good works and still not come
[14:03] back to that relationship of Eden
[14:04] there's only one way that it comes the
[14:07] true Holy Spirit his nature comes in
[14:09] your nature your old nature dies and now
[14:12] he's living on the inside it's the only
[14:14] way back
[14:16] it's not psychology it's not through ten
[14:19] steps to getting better it's not through
[14:21] any of that now I believe that there are
[14:22] certain things that can help people I'm
[14:24] different than some preachers that I
[14:25] believe that you there's certain things
[14:27] that help people I'm not against
[14:28] anything that helps somebody whether
[14:30] it's a physical doctor or an emotional
[14:33] doctor I'm not against it because with
[14:34] the end of the day if they help a person
[14:36] if they help a young boy a young girl
[14:38] they help you in some way to help you
[14:40] through things if some medicines help
[14:42] you I'm not against that because at the
[14:44] end of the day I'm going to give the
[14:46] glory to God but I'm not going to accuse
[14:48] somebody and be against doctors and
[14:50] psychologists that would help somebody
[14:52] and if it's about a new birth it's about
[14:55] relationship can you say Amen
[14:57] and religion is a far cry from
[15:00] relationship
[15:02] religion is a far cry from relationship
[15:07] it's it's not that I love God I talk to
[15:10] God he's done miracles for me it's by
[15:13] the experience of the Holy Ghost coming
[15:15] into you by nature and changing your
[15:17] nature the only way to love and to live
[15:20] his word
[15:21] is through the Holy Ghost
[15:24] because the other way
[15:26] is miserable
[15:28] you try to take the principles of God
[15:30] and the principles of this message and
[15:32] you try to live them without the Holy
[15:34] Ghost
[15:35] that's a miserable life you think the
[15:37] guy out in the bar is living a miserable
[15:39] life no it's more miserable to try to
[15:42] live this word without the nature of the
[15:45] spirit
[15:46] that's why people exit they leave the
[15:48] message whatever because they've been
[15:49] trying so hard trying I'm trying to do
[15:51] this right I'm trying to do this right
[15:52] and yet if you haven't asked deeply
[15:54] enough the Lord I forget what all I have
[15:57] to do I'm going to have one prayer I'm
[15:58] going to stay here and keep seeking what
[16:00] I need by the Holy Ghost until you
[16:02] change me Lord you're going to be like
[16:04] Jacob with that angel can you say Amen
[16:06] I'm not letting you go until you change
[16:08] me
[16:10] that's the prayer that you need
[16:13] and I'm not speaking to everybody in
[16:14] that I know some of you have the Holy
[16:16] Spirit in your life and you'll see the
[16:18] evidence of that by obeying you know
[16:20] saying Amen to the word of God you'll
[16:22] see the fruit of it but I'm challenging
[16:24] you this morning not to make you afraid
[16:26] of it but I'm challenging you don't try
[16:29] to get back in a relationship with God
[16:31] by just nodding at the word or just
[16:34] going to Brother Paul's church I won't
[16:36] let you be deceived like that go before
[16:38] God and say God give me what I need to
[16:41] change my nature
[16:44] give my children what they need
[16:47] and quit playing all these games to
[16:49] justify him I'm not justifying my
[16:51] children I love them I will never not
[16:53] accept them but at the same time they
[16:56] need what I got at 16 years old they
[16:58] need a personal relationship with Jesus
[17:00] Christ by the Holy Ghost
[17:03] they need a new birth
[17:06] so I'm encourage you to seek It Whatever
[17:07] age you are here this morning because
[17:09] religion is not relationship it's a
[17:12] miserable life to try to live this
[17:14] without the nature of God within you as
[17:16] I said we have been restored to this
[17:19] type of Oneness again
[17:20] all believers with the true Holy Spirit
[17:23] in them
[17:24] here's here's one that you can remember
[17:26] this week how many is a Believer this
[17:28] morning
[17:30] all believers with this true holy ghost
[17:32] in them
[17:33] have in their soul have fully been
[17:36] restored Back to Eden in a soul level
[17:39] I'm now in a soul level you still got
[17:41] this flesh to bring under subjection
[17:43] but in their soul you're not working
[17:45] your way back to Eden if you've got the
[17:47] Holy Ghost you're already back to Eden
[17:50] already because you're already in
[17:52] fellowship with him sin has been removed
[17:55] from the your nature the nature of sin
[17:57] the conscience of sin has been removed
[18:00] at the control tower and now the nature
[18:02] of God is there and that's how you have
[18:04] True Fellowship and relationship with
[18:06] him can you say Amen you are already
[18:08] back to Eden
[18:11] you've already arrived back at that
[18:14] relationship already
[18:15] you're not working your way back you're
[18:18] back that's powerful I could preach on
[18:20] that little wow
[18:21] you can become a new creation inside the
[18:23] nature and consciousness of sin is dead
[18:25] but we are similar with the man and the
[18:27] woman just before the fall as I refer
[18:30] back to it again they were one with God
[18:32] and one with one another but they were
[18:34] in two different vessels right now we
[18:37] don't have our full Restoration in our
[18:40] body yet we live in a world that judges
[18:42] people
[18:43] by what they see in the flesh
[18:48] I read something this morning and some
[18:50] writer said he said he said what a world
[18:53] we live in he says now we're I'm going
[18:55] to get to the word honor here in a
[18:56] minute honor
[18:58] do we live in a world where they honor
[19:01] the poor
[19:04] we honor the rich
[19:06] the rich people get on or whether they
[19:08] deserve it or not just because they're
[19:10] rich they wear the right clothes
[19:13] do we honor the people that are
[19:15] unpopular in this world no we honor the
[19:17] movie stars
[19:19] we honor the sports stars we lift them
[19:22] up and praise them and a lot of them
[19:25] most of them are just frankly dirty
[19:28] living people so 6 000 years of this of
[19:31] judging according to the flesh judging
[19:33] according how much money we don't honor
[19:35] the poor but I can tell you that the
[19:36] Bible says as we come into the New
[19:38] Testament Paul speaks about the body of
[19:40] Christ and you know what he says he says
[19:42] the one that's in the body of Christ
[19:44] that's dishonor or least likely to
[19:46] succeed or the least Among Us that's the
[19:49] one that we should be honoring
[19:52] the world doesn't function that way
[19:56] that's the one we should honor the one
[19:58] that doesn't have the money doesn't have
[20:01] the prestige doesn't have the right
[20:03] clothes
[20:04] doesn't have very much money
[20:06] even when I make a mistake and ask
[20:08] forgiveness because I'm on the path
[20:11] headed towards him
[20:13] God's obligated to me friends God's
[20:16] obligated to you you're following that
[20:18] word and walking in the path of Duty not
[20:20] out here dabbling in the things of the
[20:21] world and going the opposite direction
[20:22] when you know what the word says to do
[20:24] God's not obligated to you're losing
[20:27] your protection that's why sometimes
[20:28] people they dabble and we're only things
[20:30] privately and think it's not going to
[20:31] affect them it's not going to affect
[20:32] their family so they're doing it
[20:34] privately thinking this is my own deal I
[20:36] can do my own thing no you watch things
[20:38] happen in your family unconsciously
[20:40] because you're not in the path of Duty
[20:42] you're not following him and you watch
[20:44] that start to unravel in your children
[20:46] and and it passes it on to other
[20:48] Generations you think you're just
[20:50] yourself no things pass on to your
[20:53] children
[20:54] you got rebellion in there and you
[20:56] haven't overcome it then then watch the
[20:59] path of the children
[21:00] not always in every situation but these
[21:03] things trickle down and so you can't
[21:04] privately hold something that you know
[21:06] is against this word you know it and
[21:09] you're you're going to privately go the
[21:11] opposite direction you're going to feel
[21:13] the fruits come from that
[21:15] you're going to start seeing fruits come
[21:17] from that
[21:18] it's better you own up to it yourself I
[21:21] don't know where my children are but I
[21:23] got to get myself straightened out here
[21:25] come on parents let me hear you say Amen
[21:28] amen you can blame your children you can
[21:30] blame the preacher you can bring the
[21:31] church you can blame everybody else but
[21:34] you need to be singing It's a me it's a
[21:36] me it's a Me O Lord standing in the need
[21:38] of prayer
[21:39] because if you start with that
[21:41] I believe God will start to you honor
[21:43] God honor his word honor his servants
[21:47] then you'll watch that sometimes it
[21:49] takes years you'll watch that honor
[21:51] begin to trickle down to your children
[21:54] it's you had it's not just you believing
[21:56] the word but you're heading in its
[21:57] direction not the opposite direction not
[21:59] Rebellion not I'm not going to do that
[22:02] I'm going to feed and taste on these
[22:04] things privately When The War the word
[22:07] warns you and you know what's wrong with
[22:08] the word while you're on the word
[22:10] Journey he is obligated to you to
[22:12] protect you to forgive you but if you're
[22:14] going in the other direction you lose
[22:16] relationship with God God is not
[22:18] obligated to you now here's some points
[22:20] from the text
[22:21] in Genesis 2.
[22:24] they were one in spirit
[22:27] and God called their name Adam okay
[22:31] second then God breathed into
[22:34] a vessel in Genesis 2
[22:37] verse 7 and the Lord formed man of the
[22:40] Dust of the ground and breathed into his
[22:42] nostrils the Breath of Life The Man
[22:43] became a living Soul so now he becomes a
[22:46] vessel he was Spirit man first with Adam
[22:49] and Eve inside him now he's a flesh man
[22:52] with one vessel but the spirit is all
[22:56] one with masculine and feminine inside
[22:59] of it still
[23:00] all right so then
[23:03] then God
[23:05] comes down and says in Genesis 2 he
[23:08] still called Adam
[23:10] then he says it's not good for a man to
[23:12] be alone I'll make him a help mate right
[23:16] and then he he then God
[23:20] causes of sleep to come on Adam
[23:22] and he takes the rib out he takes as
[23:25] many ministers have said I don't mean to
[23:27] repeat but it's a good thing to repeat
[23:28] you know he didn't take apart out of
[23:31] Adam's foot
[23:34] to make the woman
[23:36] or the brain can you say Amen but
[23:39] something right real close to his heart
[23:43] did you ever notice they took that Spear
[23:45] and pierced right up there under Jesus
[23:47] and water and blood came out because the
[23:50] spirit in that was going to come back on
[23:51] the day of Pentecost
[23:53] this would be the second Eve coming back
[23:55] that's one with the second Adam
[23:58] by what by spirit
[24:01] took that rib right something very close
[24:03] to his heart and he forms this beautiful
[24:07] beautiful feminine part in a different
[24:10] vessel look different even acted
[24:14] different and a few weeks ago I went
[24:16] into the differences and and I'm not
[24:18] going to get into that day today again
[24:19] but you just I the Lord keeps bringing
[24:23] me back to this this this situation or
[24:26] this Oneness just before the fall
[24:28] because it's close to us and that we
[24:31] deal with different vessels with
[24:33] different personalities and different
[24:36] backgrounds
[24:38] and we can judge people based upon
[24:41] fleshly things
[24:43] and miss that we are one I want you to
[24:47] notice the surprise
[24:49] the honor
[24:51] the respect the praise the love the word
[24:57] honor in Hebrew
[24:59] is surprising it is the word kavad
[25:03] which is the word for Glory
[25:06] it means to be weighty in one respect
[25:09] that is bearing a burden of a weighty
[25:11] issue Glory the word kavad also means to
[25:14] be important we are to always recognize
[25:17] the importance in this Rabbi refers to
[25:21] the word honor it's throughout the Bible
[25:22] but it has a it's a deeper meaning than
[25:24] what we think and he refers to the
[25:27] children should honor their father and
[25:30] mother it's one of the Commandments
[25:32] and even in that he says we are to
[25:34] always recognize listen to this now we
[25:36] are to always recognize the importance
[25:38] of our parents no matter how good or bad
[25:42] they are they have a connection to us
[25:45] and we recognize they're important to us
[25:50] so when God used honor for honoring
[25:52] parents under our fallen condition that
[25:55] means they won't do everything perfect
[25:59] but we never ever dishonor them
[26:03] even though they've acted imperfect
[26:10] dishonor is never should never be
[26:13] tolerated it should never be justified
[26:17] in the body of Christ
[26:19] among preachers
[26:22] in your marriage
[26:25] disrespect and dishonor
[26:28] should never be justified in a Christian
[26:32] home
[26:35] speaking words of Dishonor speaking
[26:38] words of belittling I've even heard some
[26:40] cussing out their kids
[26:42] and they go to church
[26:45] I'm sorry
[26:46] it doesn't work that way in the kingdom
[26:48] of God
[26:49] honor should be there always
[26:54] no matter how you feel about their flesh
[26:56] no matter how much they may irritating
[26:58] you no matter how he's saying this Rabbi
[27:00] is saying that that honor your father
[27:02] and mother you may not feel like you
[27:05] love them sometimes because the love is
[27:07] not being in many parents many
[27:09] situations many of you come from and
[27:11] sometimes our own parents you don't feel
[27:14] loved you were abandoned there's a lot
[27:16] of broken situations but you see now God
[27:18] says honor doesn't change
[27:21] you don't have to tolerate if they're
[27:22] abusing you have to tolerate that but
[27:24] you should always retain it so if that's
[27:26] true in the word honor then we have this
[27:28] coming from Adam to the first time you
[27:30] see and says why such surprise such
[27:34] honor and even honor weighty glory even
[27:37] in that it it it it has a deeper word
[27:40] like you're in awe and I believe Adam
[27:44] was in awe
[27:45] and it expressed there's something about
[27:48] when you have it all about something and
[27:50] you you look at something that you honor
[27:52] and respect and this is important and
[27:54] this is supreme they see it in your eyes
[27:57] I think Eve seen it in Adam's eyes the
[28:01] surprise the honor the respect you are
[28:03] bone of my bone you're flesh to my flesh
[28:05] you're part of me
