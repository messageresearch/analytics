========================================

deuteronomy chapter 6 together deuteronomy chapter 6 back in god's instructions to the children of israel after they had received the word then they received in deuteronomy 6 many instructions but this is a unique thing tonight that i want to talk a little bit about um and this will tie back a bit into our study on psalms 1 on the thought life and these different things but i wanted to get into this a few weeks ago and i just didn't have the opportunity deuteronomy chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 1 and we'll just break down some of these scriptures tonight in a teaching so that we can be encouraging the lord in our journey with the lord and may god bless all those who are here tonight those that are listening may it go forth may the word go forth amen these are the commandments the statues and the judgments what's the lord and by the way i just want to say before i get into the anointing here before i think brother kenny being our choir director it's your birthday tomorrow right friday happy birthday brother kenny sister tiffany is tomorrow and there's somebody else too hannah slack did she's gone as well so they missed out on the pastor's appreciation birthday if you're listening hannah god bless you and sister tiffany god bless you happy birthday amen now these are the commandments the statues the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whether you go to possess it so the statues and judgments of what he's referring to is what came down from the mountain from moses god's prophet at mount horeb or another reference is mount sinai it's both it's the same thing but this is a significant point in history for god coming to his people and speaking through his prophet and what came from god is the word of god in statutes and judgments and how to live and here it says when you go in to possess the land you're going to need these principles you're going to need these statues because when they went into the land when they'd crossed into the wilderness to give them that's when the battle really begun i've often said your battle doesn't begin until you get the holy ghost that's when the battle really begins and you enter the land and you begin battling for your possession well his statutes instructions were for to prepare them because he says you're going to need these things that my prophet is saying you're going to need them when you get into the land and more every day you're going to need them even more so he says keep those statues and then he as you watch out as he goes along in the scripture that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statues and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy son son that means your grandson all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily there's always a promise of god a blessing that goes from following the word it's always there as the lord god of our fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hero is where the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might another place jesus references that he said with all thy mind as well sort of pretty much covers the whole human being if you're going to love god then be all in and love them with everything don't just give them your heart give them your mind don't just give them your don't just give one part of yourself but give your heart give your soul and give your might get it give everything that's the only way to really truly love god is to give them your all a lot of people today is probably not a person in the world you wouldn't ask in the world say do you love god everybody would say yes but it has actions to it and when you do it you don't love him and pick which parts you want of god you're all in and part of loving god of course is that what he said before you're embracing his statues and his commandments and these things that's part of loving god but look how he says this now thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart so so these words that i'm saying and that i brought through my prophet and spoke them these principles these commandments this word that i've given you to live by was never meant to stay just in the head it must be in your heart these words which i command you this day shall be in thine heart god takes it further what do i do with this word that i've received from a prophet let it love the lord let your obedience be out of love okay first let it start i just love god with all my heart soul mind and strength a new person says i don't know very much yet but i want to learn i just know i love god with all my heart so much start there and then make sure it's not not just in your head and say i want to love him from my heart but you're not done there what do i do with this lord will you love him with all your heart you make sure the word is in their heart not just in your head what do i do with this word okay next one and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in nine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou riseth up what i gave through the prophet should be the topic of conversation not only at church but in your home these things that i've said through him talk about them say things in front of your children talk about the scripture talk about world events and talk about how talk about god and his principles and his precepts can you say man this is what we talk about i know we talk about other things at home we have to you know how to pay for this and how to you know go change johnny's diaper and all kinds of other conversations but if it's all about just life then we're missing the power of living and this he's saying this you know why he's saying this because this is hard for us humans to do okay this will be a battle just to bring the word integrated into our lives but the problem is if we don't bring the word integrated he's going to tell us later what's going to happen so it's very important that we do it with all of life to integrate the word into into our hearts brother paul are you going to let us stand the whole time you preach to verse 14 yes i am because i have to stand the whole service zack you know that right okay let's go further and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he swear and thy fathers to abraham to isaac to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us not and houses full of all good things which thou fill us not and wells dig which thou dig us not vineyards and olive trees which thou planets not when thou hast have eaten and you're full then be aware beware lest thou forget the lord prosperity and things handed to you has a downside to it you forget the lord and you forget to talk about the lord in front of your children you forget to integrate it into your house you forget to pray and that can happen it's not like you intentionally do it it just happens naturally beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shall swear by his name ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about you for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earth you shall not tempt the lord your god as he as ye tempted him in massa ye shall dead dylan and you remember that temptation in the wilderness god didn't like it at all because they were tempting and how are they tempting the lord they begin the question is the lord among us or not that's how they tempted the lord they began to question if the lord was even around oh god just gets so grieved over that how can you say that with all that's to happen in our lives how can you say that with all the supernatural things never say that never tempt the lord is he even around us or not he's around us he's present can you say amen and ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god which is testimonies and his statues which he hath commanded thee wait a minute no wait verse 13 thou shalt fear the lord thy god serve him you shall not go after other gods the gods of the people which are round about you verse 15 for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earth you shall not tempt the lord your god as you tempted him and massa ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god and his testimonies and his statues which he hath commanded thee thou shalt do that which right and good in the sight of the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go and possess the good land which the lord swear unto thy fathers to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord has spoken amen father bless your word tonight we're very happy to be here and any troubles that we have in our life we can shut it out and we know you are the god that gives us the hallelujah in the valley we commit ourselves to you tonight all the prayer requests and our dear brothers and sisters in ukraine and russia we commit them to you for protection over them tonight in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated so this ties back to psalms chapter 1 verse 2 where the man of god is his delight this will tie back to what i was talking to a couple weeks ago about these things his delight is in the word he does meditate day and night that the thought life saturated with the word and positive things brings victory and stability no matter what happens i want to title this tonight the word integrated into our lives the word because it's not that we just have the word it's not just god sent a prophet with the word in these scriptures it says the word must be integrated into your life and when i preached on the thought life that's what that man did he in his law he doth meditate day and night he directs his thoughts to come always back to the word of god there's a lot of things we can think about but he directs his thought and he disciplines his thought bringing him back to the word thinking of a scripture thinking of a precept thinking of something brother braham said thinking of something moses said back then it was moses think of it and they would always discipline their mind because that's what that man of god did that was blessed he meditated on day and night he was his delight but it wasn't just that i love the word and i like the lord i love the word but he meditated on he discipline his mind say i'm gonna i have a choice of my thoughts i have a choice what i'm gonna think about every day and so if i have the choice in it i don't have a choice in a lot of things but if i have a choice i'm going to choose what i'm going to think about how many knows the new testament scripture that says think on these things instructions whatsoever is good report whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is pure not dirty what sort of a good report not bad report not gossip and i'm given my mind and the rest gets trashed and i'm giving mind to good things i choose to think on these things and we know the power of that and so now that thought life being saturated with the word and positive things brings victory and stability no matter what happens in our life it counters everything a thought life that is given to god counters everything that's going on the fears of coming judgments your internal fears your personal fears your fears of the future your fears that you might get the same genetic disease that your whole family uh four generations back has gotten your fears of the coming judgments your fears are what's happening in the world it is the counter the thought life being being uh pleasant under the pleasant thoughts of god your thought life counters all things and it brings victory in your life it brings stability in your life it counters the fears it counters the spirit of laodicea which is a lukewarm spirit a thought life under control of god filled with the spirit counters the spirit of laodicea and makes you on fire for god instead of lukewarm for god that's why how powerful this thought life is um it brings the hallelujah in the body your thought life under control brings the hallelujah in the valley we must stay close to the lord that's what these scriptures say and our world must stay close to his world god's world our world must stay integrated with the things of god if not integrated saturated when the the bible talks about take this truth put it on the doorpost of your house teach it in the morning and night to your children put it in put it in the frontlets of your eyes that means saturate your life with the word of god now there's a reason why he's saying that and i'm going to give those reasons tonight tonight maybe next wednesday i'm going to give the reason because god always has a good reason why he's saying it but the main theme tonight is that it's not just that you have the word is it integrated into your life and into your thought life because when you get it then you get victory so our we must stay close and our world must stay integrated with the thinks of god if not saturated with the things of god and the principles of god if not the spirit of the age can dominate us even believers can get us in a state of lukewarmness even the church we know the laodicean church it's the church he's talking about in revelation street it's not unbelievers can you say amen it's the church that's in a state of lukewarmness so that means that believers if they're not countering saying god i want to stay on fire for you i want to stay close to you if you don't fight against that you'll automatically become a laodicean i don't mean to call the bride laoseans tonight but i have to be honest that if we don't yield to god we come under lukewarmness and god hates that he wants to spill it out of his mouth he would rather have you cold he'd rather make a decision so many people right now are in the valley of decision they're they're making decisions what to do right now whether to follow the council of god or follow their feelings and so many is in the valley of decision and so when you're in the in between spot it's a terrible place to be and when you become lukewarm in your walk with the lord god says i would really rather have you cold or hot but i i the lukewarmness is what makes me spill it out of my mouth i can't stand that lukewarm water coming from the church my dad used to say there's nothing worse when you're a kid and you're thirsting after playing an hour of basketball and you run up to a drinking fountain and it's lukewarm water nothing worse than good hot water for tea praise the lord nice ice water praise the lord but when you're hot and you need something lukewarm you just what do you do [Music] that's my demonstration tonight that's my visual it's what god says he does with our lives that become lukewarm i would rather have you cold i'd rather have you just admit i'm cold i'm i'm backslid i'm you know i'm making a decision i don't want this i want the world he would rather someone be honest than than to be in between god wants to see passion god wants to see the fires of the holy spirit god wants to see us trying we're not perfect but we're trying can you say amen your love of god comes natural my love of god comes natural if god puts his love within you you don't have to work at that but staying on fire for god you got to work at it you got to fight for it can you say amen you got to bring your heart and your passion underneath god to stay on fire you got to stay close to the fire [Music] amen if you want to get on fire you stay close to the fire and you're not distancing yourself from where the fires of god are which is in the word of god around the saints of god can you say man so you know it's it's several good quotes today that we're talking about uh people being critical of the the rude people at church and somebody posted these are the same people that talk about all the rude people at church that never stay after to find out who the people really are to know if they're rude or not amen and then there's the type of people that's the the the drag racers brother magoolus says i love it he says there's some christians that are drag racers they drag themselves to church and then they race away i love it i love it the problem is i see it i tell you we ought to come early and stay late can you say man we're going to come and get what we need to get praise the lord i want to don't want to be a drag racer for sure naturally and spiritually so in this lukewarm age this is a powerful weapon against it those who want to stay on fire they stay close to the fires of god and and so if how many want to live above laodicea how many want to how many wants to be on fire not a lukewarm christian amen so i think if you'll listen tonight there'll be some things i guarantee you that would be a help to you if you listen close you'll hear some good things other people just filter it out uh to what you want to hear like you normally do so now in this setting of deuteronomy just in case you don't know we're they're getting ready to enter the promised land and there's an emphasis from the lord that we can take today as well because we've received a word from the mountain through a prophet again we'll get into that in a minute that was a pivotal point when god brought the word to the mountain for the people and god did it in the old testament god does it in the new testament through a prophet and there's an emphasis after they receive the word from the lord that we can take today as well and the emphasis is don't forget the statues and the commandments and the judgments that i brought to you from the prophet and from the mountain mount sinai or horeb was pointed to so frequently in the old testament so so many times it was pointed back to pointed back to you the statues even when they got in the promised land joshua was to remind him and to preach to them the statues and the things that come from moses as they come into their promised land so they were to be to to keep their minds filled with those things mount sinai was a turning point it was where a prophet was used to deliver the word of god to the people it was a huge pivotal point in history the word of god of how to live was dispensed through a prophet that's what happened god coming on the mountain with his glory and his prophet would be given the word of and that word would be how the people should live for generations to come god said i'll teach you how to live without that they'd be lost they would become idolaters they would become they would be given but he gave them an absolute he gave him this is what this is from my heart this is how you should live as believers in jehovah and it was you talk about specifics read the read your old testament you talk about specifics in that wall i mean it was specifics right down to dietary laws and everything and and if you read those they're to give protection to the people for diseases and all these other things and god had it all in his mind to start with and if you were living in that day you'd almost have to say how does god know about all this if he's never really been here lived out life and he's bringing us such specifics how to live about adultery about young people about all these other things and he's just bringing specific if this happens deal with it this way if this happens if a girl gets gets engaged and her father didn't know about it this happens deal with it this way how does god well god created us and god knew then from the beginning so he says for my people i'm going to give my absolute i'm going to give my word to them so they won't be floundering around if they'll stay with my word they'll have power to be able to live and that should mean a lot to us friends because we've received an even more sure word of prophecy we've received received even more sure of a solid word in the last days as i was sharing with brother jason the other night the glorious word that god does it again he sends his word to the people in the last days to restore them back to the word through a prophet can you say amen so this pivotal point of god on the mountain it was a turning point it was where prophet was used to deliver the word of god to the people the word of how to live was dispensed through a prophet it had the glory of god in it and and and so it had so much glory in it that moses had to veil his face so i want you to see something and i'm taking this very slow i may not get to everything tonight but i just want everybody to understand i would love our children to be able to understand that when god brought the word on the tablets to moses it wasn't just this um uh lifeless uh mechanical spiritless thing that took place the glory of god was all over that mountain and that's something the glory of god was all over that place to where moses had so much the power and the glory of in his face that when he come down out of the mountain the people had they said put a veil over your face they couldn't even see it it was so powerful it's so glorious so the the word isn't just the word the word isn't just tablets the word isn't just letter it has god's glory in it even on mount sinai it had the glory of god in it it had the life of god god's presence was there shaking the mountain actually until the children of israel said because they said let god speak we want god speak and then later after the mountainship they said no no no more we don't want god to speak let moses speak for god you know that it's the people of god that come up with the idea for prophets to speak instead of god personally himself they begged for it at the mountain scene and they set a pattern for all of time that god says i'll speak through my prophets now god knew he was going to do that he didn't change because of the people but they begged for it let moses let the prophet speak now we live in a day we don't want to hear what the prophet has to say we'll hear from god ourselves and yet it was man that suggested it first i don't want to come into the glories of god that's too much for me i i feel too sinful to be in his glory so let the prophet speak and then we'll listen and they didn't they didn't listen anyway but the glory of god surrounded that place it's kind of like the service under here the glory of god was surrounding that place that mountain was filled with the life and the glory of god so it wasn't just this mechanical spiritless dry event the supernatural god was there in that mountain causing the mountain to shake in other words it was not just the word but his presence coming to the people bringing the word to them with his presence praise the lord wasn't just the word it wasn't just our bibles that's why i think there's a quote um and uh i'm i'm 90 sure i might quote it just a little wrong but he said all the glories of god all the blessings of god all the presence of god lies in his word so that's why we come through the channel of his word that's why we saturate it into our lives that's why we get it in our you know start with the brain i mean the the mind is the wound to the soul start there meditate on it get it into your children's minds let them memorize it because the potential of the glory of god is in his word when that triggers and it becomes a revelation to them uh it's over for the devil can you say amen if a young if a young person catches by the holy ghost or revelation of who they are and catches these revelations of the word the devil's day is numbered with that person amen he'll still fight him but that revelated believer the gates of hell brother josiah the gates of hell shall not prevail against the revelation the devil is finished when somebody gets a true revelation from god and you can't get a revelation unless you're around the word of god hearing it amen you can't get it unless you're hearing but because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen so this event in mount sinai was so huge it was a pivotal point in history at least in the history of god's interaction with people but in deuteronomy we we see here these warnings of further instruction that now take these precepts that came from the mountain and from the prophet take these precepts take whatever came from god here and begin integrating them into your daily lives and i i emphasize daily lives and homes because that's what he that's what he talked about he he was referring when he's talking about put sitting with your children in thine house so the very prophet's message would now not stay at the temple or not stay on tablets he's saying bring what was said into your home let your children hear it let your grandchildren hear it put it on the posters put it on the refrigerator put it in your room put it on your phone put it everywhere you look put it in the front of your car put it everywhere that most places you can look you can have the word of god in front of you you can't do that at your job always but you have control of what you have in your home you have control of what you have in your home you have control of what you put in your mind and he's saying let this be saturated let it be integrated into your life let it not stay on the mountain let it not stay on the tablets don't just say moses has the tablets don't just say i've got the books and tapes i've got it i've got it on my phone or i've got it in my shelves i've got all of them i've got the whole set i've got a vintage set well that doesn't impress god can you say man got the whole thing i've got them too brother perry green gave me a set of the red volumes that's the original ones and all the beautiful red hardbound volumes you know he yeah we felt so special to get him and i i do feel special but it's not a type of thing to leave and to glorify on your shelves this has power within it it must be integrated into our daily lives it must be read it must be talked about it must be spoken to the children and more so in this day as they hear the other voices of other standards and other absolutes thank god for the homes that i'm looking around here tonight that raised your children some of them may be astray but thank god that you held that word in front of them because that's what you were supposed to do it'll never go away from them don't we have a promise of that train up a child in a way it should go and they won't depart from it and and one minister brought it that it won't depart from them because that's how this work this word works you see it's going to go with them amen some people grow up in my church they'll say jared it might have been you said this one time all the time i got brother paul's voice in my head constantly saying things and hopefully it's deeper than just brother paul's voice but i remember you saying that maybe you're saying that i remember six years ago that one statement stuck with me amen if it's the word i'm glad it's stuck in your head you can't get rid of me you didn't bring me in and you can't kick me out [Laughter] amen so now he says take this wonderful word but never let it be on the shelf never let it just be in tablets and if god says plaster them everywhere plaster that word everywhere and speak about it the reason he said is he's concerned you will forget what will happen you will forget it and then he tells us what can happen if you forget it it's no longer good enough just to talk about the event of mount sinai or in this case mount sunset it's no longer good about to talk about the event there are a lot of places around in our ranks that would talk about the event and talk about the event and talk about the cloud and we rejoice in the sign god put in the heaven just so you know as a church i don't rest my eternal destination upon that sign that was in the heaven but god said there'll be signs he puts into heaven and that cloud was a sign of the word returning to his people can you say amen so we never belittle it but i don't anchor because the people that have anchored just to the signs and not the voice of the sign they weren't anchored enough and then they're going to nitpick what day did happen and everything else yeah of course because your anchor is in the sign my anchor's not in a sign my anchor's in the word of god and the voice of christ that i've heard through this word and then i thank god for the signs but it happened in a mountain it was mount sunset it was out there in sabino and all these things took place god giving his word to the prophet sending him back to jeffersonville speaking the word of god but it came in a mountain god meeting him a mountain the sword coming in his hand listen friends this isn't just stories our bible is repeated again and a pivotal point for god's people was god to speak to his prophet in the mountain and give him the word for people to live by and it's happened again in the last days we're not left without knowing how to live we know how to live in this hour god has given his word to his people again somebody say praise the lord young people god no matter how wicked this world gets no matter how wicked people get compromises borderline believers don't always remember god himself brought his word to the people to live by and if you live by it you'll be blessed and you'll overcome it's just that simple i believe with all my heart so we must take what was dispensed from god and bring it into our lives and make it the forefront of our conversations and our meditation we should surround ourselves with it i said we should surround ourselves and integrate and bathe ourselves in it constantly as much as we can we should surround ourselves with it why one reason he gives here in the scriptures is that when he says when you come into blessings the tendency to come into blessings is people forget god's principles you can use an example of something someone becoming successful and starting to make a lot of money money can ruin people riches can ruin people it becomes the answer to all things the love of money the love of money is the root of all evil but riches themselves when they increase for somebody it's a test of their character that's right okay so you may say well i hope i'm uh a millionaire someday i hope i get some money and hit the big thing someday that's what i'd like to be as a professional millionaire i'd like to have that as a career and so but you see if you had all that dumped on you it'll become a test it'll test everything that you are you know people sometimes to get a promotion and praise god for it but remember it'll be a test that you glorify god with it you go on with god but for a lot of people it was a test and you seen what really came out of them they began to ditch things and ditch this and lay this aside and lay the word aside because the security of i can got my money to bail me out now i got my money so i don't need to depend on god as much it's such a deception such a deception so i want to stay like paul and i trust that i can that he said and i've i've learned to be without and i've heard learned to have a lot and i've been in both places but i've learned whatever state i'm in to be content i'm not going to change my praise not going to change my worship not going to quit coming to church can you say amen money's not going to change me i already have an absolute in my life i'm already a rich man i'm a millionaire spiritually i hit the lottery spiritually when i got saved i become a billionaire spiritually so any added blessings to pay the bills praise the lord but if i never got it if i stayed a pulper my whole life i'm a millionaire already i'm rich in faith and open love i got more than my share i'll be moving to my mansion just over in glory where i'm a rightfully i'm rich in faith and hope and love i got more than my share and i'll be moving to my mansion just over in glory where i'm rightfully is there a verse up there my father owns the cattle on a thousand hills i believe i own at least one stop a minute stop it we clap on two and four here my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills i believe i own at least one i stand amazement to see his face knowing that i'm his son well i'm rich in faith and hope and the yeah i got more than my share i'll be moving to my mansion just over in glory where i'm a rightful air i have a guardian angel watching me he'll go everywhere but when i need my father in heaven up above i pray just a simple prayer yeah i'm rich in faith and hope and love i got more than my share i'll be moving to my mansion just over in glory where i'm a rightfully you thought you were poor tonight and i just told you you're a rich man you're a witch woman you're a billionaire spiritually if you've got this message with the seven seals open and the fullness of his word returned to his people you're a spiritual billionaire somebody say praise the lord amen praise the lord and some of you young people have thought that i'm closing now you're wrong i'm going on no no this is too good we can't quit right now don't quit while you're ahead right not not in christianity so one of the reasons that we have to keep the word integrated in our lives when we're rich or poor whatever we are riches can make us forget and when you forget you become drawn easily by the flesh and he has specific things that he mentions as distractions and a lot of them are once you get in the land now only god would know this to tell him but once you get in this land of blessing once you get in this land that is your land you'll have to fight for it but it is your land but once you get in there you're going to come to goodly cities you're going to take the enemy out it's going to become yours and so these things will be handed to you the goodly cities he talks about the um uh the uh wells that you didn't have to dig he talks about the good thing house is full of good things and a lot of this is i i think of americans because a lot of it is just given i think like a spoiled kid he didn't have to work for it he was just given to him and that's a trap when stuff's just given to us we don't appreciate it as much amen you become wealthy and things are just handed to you and natural riches and conveniences can make us spoiled natural riches and now i got money i don't have to worry about things i can buy one i want to buy just be careful that line you go down because you can become spoiled and the first thing you begin to forget is the lord natural things tend to lure us away from god's word in a life saturated with god's word there's been a million people go through that before million examples where rich has ruined them and they left the word and if they're a child of god they'll go through a lot of things god will test them take their money away whatever has to be done he's going to bring him back but we don't want to go down that path we want to be trusting him whether we have riches or we don't have riches whatever happens we don't want to forget the lord and the way we don't forget the lord is we keep him before us you don't forget something if it's always uh good music and good word in your car and it's all over your house and it's what you're keeping in your conversation mostly and it's what you keep your thoughts on you don't forget that so how we forget is that it gets placed and there's another distraction that something else comes in front of that's how our brains work you got something that's in front of you every day you don't forget it david said i set the lord before me every day i set the lord before me and if he's right in front of you you're not gonna forget him amen so let's see so people you know it lures us away from god's word we forget the lord and we take for granted the simple life of just loving him and serving him and we can take the wealth of what the word has given us we can take the wealth of what the word has given us for granted as well just like naturally riches can ruin somebody i think sometimes there's people even in the ranks of this message that are so become almost gloated and almost proudful with the word that they have they've forgotten the lost they forgot simplicity they've forgotten their relationship with the lord but oh they're just so full on the buffet of this word and the doctrinal part of it which is fine but they become big and big-headed proud they forget that simple walk with the lord to forget to pray and god send the holy ghost today so lives can be changed i say never remind you of that if you believe god said a prophet you got the holy ghost that's the type of stuff we hear you believe this and this and this and this church then you've that proves you've got the holy ghost no a person needs the experience of christ himself through the word through the word but they need to experience this christ themselves never forget that we tend to forget and then we get really wealthy and we can take things for granted for example the good ministry we have in in that god's provided the fightful ministry you can take them for granted you can take your sister brothers and sisters for granted sometimes you can take church for granted and miss too much and you just you take well they'll be there uh and so i'll be there when i when it's convenient for me to be there and you take things for granted take kinks for granted when you're receiving the correction of the word a brother or sister coming and correcting you you tend to take that for granted but that's a great blessing if it's the correction of the lord and to resist it is a bad thing the bible speaks of bastard born children because they won't receive the correction of the word so there's no new birth there and one of their problems in signs is they won't receive correction they won't receive it and so i'll just end on that point that we can also take for granted and become wealthy with all the things and remember the the promised land he's speaking of is a natural land but every bit of the promised land types a spiritual promised land for us and we can come into all these glories that we defeat the enemy and take this city and take this possession i've got this i've got this but even that he said don't forget the lord don't forget his word don't forget to teach your we don't take for granted that we still live in a world where we need to teach our children the basics of the bible we need to not forget to teach our children the basics of of salvation and teach our children and read them the basics can you say amen no skip to the end skip to the skip to the real high stuff no no no let's not forget any of it let's not forget any of it and don't forget to be simple and teach it simple to your kids that's what god's saying here no matter how much word we get and bless we get let's not forget the simple things let's not forget our relationship with the lord let's not forget our relationship with others got a sermon coming up on relationships the lord's really dealing with me somewhere down the road here i don't know but i don't hear to me preachers talking about how god taught us what relationship is and brought us into a relationship with him and through that a trickle-down effect is we should learn and know what it means to have good relationships with people but i find a world even within our rank sometimes i don't have a friend in the world i don't need friends i tell my wife today i thought this that's funny we're constantly texting all kinds of people around the world and yet the same people sometimes will say but i don't have any friends so we must be missing something from what we're doing in the subject of relationship people are afraid of it so we're missing some elements there so maybe the lord will help us here's another reason that god says stay in the word stay saturated with the word and we will get into this more next wednesday night lord willing now just say something about it god knows how we're built let me just say it the other reason that god warns he says when you get in there if you don't stay close to the world you'll be drawn to other idols because you're going to have the test of other idols so god knows how we are built as a human being and he's given these warnings because we are built in a way that has the potential for a diversified heart god knows man has the potential to have a diversified worship in other words he can worship many gods or he can worship one god that's not the true god but usually it's a diversified heart i'll give him a piece of my heart to this god a piece of my heart i worship this i worship that i worship that a diversified heart and here in the scripture i read you tonight god says but i am one lord and you're going to serve me you serve you only worship one god idolatry teach us to have a diversified heart that we give a part of ourselves and a part of our worship to other gods and if you think that was in just the old testament you're crazy we have images all over us to worship on the television on our phones images are placed in front of us every day to distract us to woo us away the human being with all of his emotions can be idolatrous and distracted to other gods than the one true god the only way to keep from that happening is to become consumed with one god to consume with god and the christ who's the revealing of god can you say amen god is looking at where our emotions our passions are directed to i may look at you and not know where your passions are directed to i may not know that but god knows where your passions are directed remember worship isn't just when you're here in church raising your hands worship is the whole laying before something it's giving your heart and passion to something that's worship of the human being and the only way to keep that from happening is to become consumed with god that's another reason why it says stay saturated integrated with the word of god god is looking at where our emotions and passions are directed to this scripture shows that it's not just our soul he wants us to give but everything that we are that's why he says when you love me love me with all your he doesn't just say just love me with your soul and the rest of you just wing it no this is integrated in all of our lives when you love me it's got to be with your mind soul body strength heart everything and why does god say that because he's a jealous god and all of our worship and passion and direction goes only to one it's kind of like a wife and a husband if that's a proper marriage can you say amen their devotion naturally on this earth their devotion is to one partner for life that's it all of their attention all their flirting all this stuff belongs to one person and whenever it steps out of that even in little steps it's an adulterous spirit so the church has done that for 2000 years an adultery she's called the mother of harlots it's an adulterous spirit on the church that left her true husband still wants to name his name but she has all these other shapes she opens herself up to all kind of other husbands that's why she's called that so you individually can be diverted in your heart like that and say i'm married to christ but your heart is given to someone else a woman can do that a man can do that with his wife a woman and if a woman and man can do it we see every day sometimes that happens in our world especially then that's the type naturally of what happens spiritually i tell our young people you want to pray and young men you want to pray that god makes you a one woman man for life somebody you're smiling because you've heard me say that young people pray that god makes you a one-woman man and girls pray that god makes you a one-man woman for life now while you're single pray not you know three or four or five guys that you dated and then you know that's oh that's a worthy point that god help me and i might meet a few and i might you know go with a few a few but it's just my prayers that lord lead me to that one person for my life and i will give all my devotion to them i won't share it with anybody else nothing worse when a man starts to share some of his affections with the women on the screen and not his own wife there's nothing worse that hurts the heart of a woman worse than that when she finds out she hardly can forgive it and why is that because god's placed something within her the same thing god has within himself i want all of your devotion directed to me you understand and you you you know a man sometimes will experience when he when he would make a mistake and there ends up being a separation in a marriage and it's because of his unfaithfulness same thing on the woman's side but it's such a hurt it's such a it's the deepest hurt can that can strike a woman especially but a man as well it just it's hard to recover from it's hard to forgive because it just cuts to the core of us when we realize somebody spoke a vow to me and they're not devoted to me they cheated on me it cuts to the very core of us how does that cut to the heart of god when he sees our heart diverted he wants all of us he wants our 100 devotion and i could say more but a one man a one woman man one man woman for life say well i don't know who she is yet who he is yet you still have the prayer i'm one for life when i meet them and when i after i get to know them and it's god's will and things come together when i make that commitment it's one woman the rest of my life it's one man the rest of my life and all my devotion all my passions all my sexual passions all my emotional passions all my love all my attention everything from then on gets directed to one person for the rest of your life if we had more absolute like that we had less adulteries and less cheating in marriages if young people as single people would resolve that i'm not going to get i'm not going to get married i'm not i'm not going to unequally yoke for an unbeliever that's a no-brainer with an unbeliever but i'm going to pray that god gives me the right want and i will be with lord when you give me that right one even if it takes a while everybody listening i am willing to wait because your your worst day as a single person your worst possible day maybe you can think of it right now your worst day as a single person not being married is better than being in a miserable marriage that's right so you wait and you trust god it's going to be of the lord and it'll be right or it won't be at all now i preached way to the extreme that way not to scare people but to put the fear of the lord in them because i want it to be right for you you you should know that i'm a pastor who prays for our single people that god will send their mates all the time i pray for you that god will send the right one hopefully to this church i don't pray it that way but there is a contract that if they visit here they have to sign there's no contract is there brandon i think there is there is okay in my church i guess there would be [Applause] some young people say typical him and brother barry they would have a contract like that yeah so it's real it's it's a one and so if that's if that makes for a solid oneness in a marriage that all devotion everything is directed to one person for life if that's a natural level how much more our relationship with god i'm about christ and that's it and if he asked me to give up something it's done it's over i'm i'm giving it up because i love him so much this habit it's finished because i love him more than i love the habit you see and he did the same thing for you at calvary i give up my life i give up my convenience and had a choice christ had a choice to stay in this world and even marry a wife the normal way and he gave up that choice for a bride that i'm preaching to here tonight he was a one-woman man can you say amen christ was a one-woman man he did everything he gave his life for us praise the lord but we'll talk more about idolatry next week you know it's it's the other reason that he when he says the lord our lord is one lord it's a foundational truth for every human being wanting to embrace the true god he must know that he is one he doesn't share his glory with anyone not even a trinity doctrine he doesn't share his glory with two others this will this these kind of doctrines will unravel a confused heart in other words it will confuse our heart even more and god is saying the lord our god is one lord because all that we are all that we worship should be directed to one not diverted to many he knows just around the corner is the test of other gods and other things to worship that all want a piece of their heart and he's giving these warnings before they go into the promised land keep yourself from idols little children keep yourself from idols make me your passion stay in the word that i've given you from a prophet when you love me love me with all you god i don't want lip service god says this isn't some mechanical intellectual dry ideal this is not a ritual of burning a candle this is not a theology this is directing who we are as a person towards the one true god he knows when it's from your heart just like your wife knows brothers when it's from your heart she can tell when the sum of all your passion is towards her you can see it in his eyes you can feel it in his touch you can hear it in his voice and it's the same with god he can tell if all your heart is towards him it's the same thing he says to the laodicean church i'd rather have you be cold or hot than to be lukewarm with me and your attentions so i'm closing to say it would no longer be good enough just to believe and acknowledge that his presence came on the mountain and gave us the word from a prophet under the pressures here and the pressures that are coming we must keep that's what god's saying as i close under the pressures here he says and the pressures that are coming in the promised land when those pressures are coming we must keep that word in front of us all the time we must talk about it i'd say under modern times the only way to live a victorious life over laodicea is just let the fire of god consume you daily not weekly daily we must stay in the channel we must get under the spout where the glory comes out you'll have to make some changes you'll have to cut some things out of your life that you spend so much in and replace it with the word of god it's an age to be distracted and to quickly wander away from that priority of the word of god in his presence i'm going to read to you next week we'll talk about it out of malachi 4. i'll just read it before we close malachi 4 talks about our prophet to this generation but did you know just before it in malachi 4 last six scriptures of the old testament verse 4 and chapter 4 verse 1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn this is what we are preaching about sunday the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud gay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them saith the lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall now all this is prophecy for our day because this is the day that judgment comes this is the day that the earth shall burn like an oven and the wicked shall be a stubble this is all going to happen and it says but you that fear my name name the son of righteousness arise with healing his wings you shall go forth as grow up as calves of the stall um commentators have different views of that but if you just take it as it is um you have two things there you shall be he's talking about the people of god you should be calves of the stall well you got they said calves that are full they're well fed so the people of god will be well-fed while there's a famine in the land but you know calves of the stall that you could say at calves that are let out of the stall you ever seen calves that are let out of the stall enraptured they jump around with joy speaking of the bride you know what friends we're going to be let out of the stall someday can you say amen and i'm not going to be acting all reserved like this tonight i'm going to be like a calve when they act and they get out of the stall glory be to god but unto you okay verse three and he shall ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soldier of your feet in the day after that third war after everything's over then the righteous walk upon the ashes of the wicked look what he says in verse 4 and all these scriptures about us at the end time and everything is going to happen in the end time remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded him in horeb in sinai for all israel with the statues and judgments why is this in here it's that theme remember what i sent through my prophet that's right if you're going to live in this day where war is looming upon us where you're just before the rapture stay in the word of god and remember the statues of the lord same reminder as in deuteronomy behold i will send you elijah the prophet well that's interesting because moses was the one that brought the word to the mount sinai and oreb and then he refers to our prophet for this day says elijah the prophet i'll send you before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse i see myself all over that can you say man that's where we live and we've received elijah so now let's saturate and integrate the word into our lives like we never have before see sometimes i read and it just seems so mechanical and just seeing sometimes i read it i don't feel the spirit of the lord keep reading it stay in it stay reading it to your children oh it just seems so mechanical when i'm doing devotion to those kids and you know they might fall asleep or whatever keep doing it stay in the word keep reading it to them because god has a way of his powers in the word of influence in that child when you don't think he's being influenced i believe he's being influenced she's being influenced amen i sure enjoyed the word with you tonight it's been good to be in the house of the lord let's stand together amen let's give the lord a hand [Applause] i was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the lord that's what david said i was glad when they said we know there's going to be something good every time we gather together and we meet even online i know that people receive things from the lord and that's our invisible god and christ coming in our mess and speaking through his word helping us along our journey and we need his strength and his help at this time amen continue remember jim's sister andez's husband jim and he'll be having some therapy here the next few days and weeks to get that back in shape it's not good to get uh hip broken at this age so we want to just lift him up in prayer that he would receive healing from the lord and all the other requests tonight that were mentioned we always take them home with us and we always want to remember them as well i want the word integrated in my life i want to work counter culture i want to work against laodicea i can't do that for you but i can teach you and train you this is what moses and them were saying back then and it's even more important now integrate let god be your if you want life to come together and a lot of other things and things you they're not coming together just stay focused on him just keep that word before you and all the other things fall into place because center key of f i think you are the center center of my life you're the reason why i can live more abundantly let there be nothing nothing placed before you [Music] i want to do everything through christ the center the center of my life first verse seems i have a million things to do
