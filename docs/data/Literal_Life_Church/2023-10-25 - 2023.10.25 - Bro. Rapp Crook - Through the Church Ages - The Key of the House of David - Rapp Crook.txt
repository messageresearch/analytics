start there I was tucking my daughter on the L into bed last night and and said uh Papa's going to go and I got to go prepare for service tomorrow and she said Papa what you going to pray about what what are you going to preach about and um I said well I'm going to I'm going to talk about the key of the house uh the key about I'm going to talk about the key tomorrow at church and um her response kind of startled me it just kind of shows andage encourages us as parents there's a lot more going on than meets the eyes sometimes they pick up a lot more than you think should is it about the key of receiving the Holy Ghost wow somebody's been listening to what we've been preaching about here at church so um even when it uh looks like not a lot might be happening uh Lord's getting in there so be not we well doing we'll just uh start here the Book of Revelation chapter 3 and uh you're there but I'm not yet Revelation 3 and: 7 as where we're going to take our take our text we're going to start with the Philadelphian age this evening and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things said he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth and I want to focus especially on that those phrases um he is true and talking about the Key of David and then the opening and and no man shutting let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord I Thank you for bringing us here together father we we take it easily for granted I think of the churches in Laos that we've seen pictures of just uh Believers Gathering uh on the dirt floors of of homes and having to take such uh trouble to get to smuggle materials in and out and and we've got U books uh all over our homes we don't have to to worry about them being safe Lord I Thank you for the freedoms that we have Lord I just pray that you would uh bless the service this evening you grant us a opener understanding oh God and that we might see more clearly your hand in our life and your plans for our life oh God in Jesus name amen you may be seated it's been a it's been a big month for the uh for the KK family I appreciated brother Paul giving us some flexibility just because we we moved to homes uh two weeks ago and um that's quite an undertaking uh moving from one place to another we just lived in the other place for for seven years but still in seven years time it's amazing how much stuff can aass so even if you're not moving you should play moving every few years it's just uh it make the experience easy somewhere down the road but uh want to do uh this CU we've been a month away uh almost a month and a half away from this going to take a few minutes kind of review what we had talked about uh in Sardis before we um head into the uh uh Philadelphian age um we we ended last time with the book of Sardis looking at the at the tree of life and uh uh sorry The Book of Life um but um Jesus speaks about the the the church ages in a very compact form in John 12 where he says except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it if it does die it brings forth much fruit and this is the process that uh that the church has undergone during the church ages um there was a seed that was sown there in Jesus's uh Jesus's Ministry there in the day of Pentecost the seed was swn but then they had to go into the ground and die through the Dark Ages brother Braham says those Dark Ages that the age of that perrian age that was the age of the open door for the Antichrist he was injecting his Much Death as he could into the church but that seed uh um died there in the ground so that it could bring forth new life and that's what began to happen in the sardian age under Martin Luther and it continues in the Philadelphian age we talked in the previous weeks about the book of life and it can be hard to understand God's election we kind of looked at the election is uh everybody standing up on the end line being team be having teams be picked and that just is something that's that's an idea that just is very repulsive to us especially if we'd ever been the last one picked before but election isn't a matter of God picking us or US choosing God that's not the right picture of election election doesn't have to do with with with with picking or choosing in that way election instead is kind of taught in Jesus's Parable in Matthew Chapter 13 where a SE Goes Forth to se and he knows what he wants to uh he's already been to the store he been to the barn he's gotten the seeds he wants to be planted that's what he's going to be have growing in this field and that's what he that's what he SWS however after him comes this enemy who SWS all the the dandelions and the weeds in the field so it's not that God goes and looks at the field and I'm going to choose that plant there I'm going to choose that plant I'm going to choose that plant it's not based on how good the plant's done it based on what kind of plant it is and so election is not a matter of picking and choosing it's a matter of identity and that just uh that just takes the whole picking and choosing out of it's God has uh before the foundation of the world he's that sewer who went forth to seow he SED his good seed and then the enemy goes after that but um brother brandom says that we have to be careful and see this it's not the person that comes eternally predestinated from God it's the word or the seed it's not that oh my this particular brother this particular sister they are just so good God says Ah because they're so good I'm going to predestinate them it's not in that way it's it's the word of the seed inside of them and then you know our body is just made of Flesh and as we're that that that seed's there and we're being made we're just the we're just the flesh that's around the most precious thing the seed of God there on the inside so it's that word or the seed and we going to want to bring this back to the book of life because he says the record of this wheat plant it goes into the ground it dies and then it goes on through out through all the church ages going through uh tassel form going through stalk form going all the way up to shock till it reproduces weed seed the wheat there at the end all that story of the wheat plant that record of the wheat plant that is The Book of Life and like we saw last time God is so so gracious even at the great white Throne judgment were people who had never come to faith in God but have they've done good things to that wheat plant if they've been gracious to God's children wow it's just like how we would respond if some as our as our kid goes to school for the first time anybody who's kind to our kid we're going to be we're going to be so happy and gracious to them as well as any anything that seems to be involved with the growth of this wheat plant in some way has some part of the story and God includes them in his book of book book of life there at the end so this corn of wheat it falls on the ground and dies brother Brandon preaches this in a couple different messages um he starts preaching it I think mainly in um that message the sea is not air with the shock and um that's um that that's a good one to to listen to but here's a kind of a nice compact form of it in the Rapture message the corn of wheat fell on the ground and died under the dark age persecution it went into the ground and it had to die because unless that seed dies in rots it abides alone you can keep that seed on your shelf it's a nice seed but it'll stay by itself until it actually gets planted in rots and laid there in the ground and rotted and the devil seems like he's he's won the day there in the Dark Ages but then come forth in two little blades of the Lutheran church now the Lutheran Church brought off more blades zwingle and so forth and then the light life was there in that seed but then that that the life leaves the seed and it's going up through the now the the the stalk is coming out with with with Luther wingly and so forth and from that on up it comes into the tassel as that life keeps on going up you have to continue hearing what the spirit is saying unto the churches walking in the light of the day because the life that was once there in The Roots has now gone further and it keeps on going further so that life goes on up into the tassel which was John Wesley the great missionary age then it dropped back out of there come that deceiving age that Pentecostal age it's gone further and that Pentecostal age that that that that shuck that's just right around the that that that germ of wheat that's going to be reproducing itself it's right around that and it looks really close but the point of the of that sermon is the Shu and the seed are not airs together the seed keeps going forth and it goes off to obtain its inheritance and it leaves the Shu behind because the shock isn't willing to go on before that so the shock is not air with that uh with that wheat seed the life that comes up through through Luther was that was what was what made Wesley the life that come out of Wesley is what made Pentecost the life that comes out of Pentecost makes the wheat but each one of them are just carriers that's why we can't focus just on Luther we can't focus on Wesley we can't focus just on brother Brandon because they're carriers of Life bringing us further want to keep on walking into what God is doing today the real life goes on through there and that's what God has done in each and every age and the shock has to be there to shelter it all these things that God has done in previous ages they've been necessary to to carry that life on through and we can look at that even in our own lives why did we have to take the path that we've taken in life it's it can be hard to understand sometimes but God has Us in some places for a time because it's kind of sheltered us I was talking to the uh um brother gusta from from Germany who was here this past week and we know some we have mutual friends in in Eastern Europe and he was talking about this one particular Church who who seem to kind of there's one brother leading the church kind of a caretaker wanted them to stay in the Thunders movement for a while and they stayed there and they really couldn't understand why we're doing this because really Church wasn't growing or anything but it was almost because they weren't getting in fellowship with other areas was almost God had them under quarantine because some of the other churches in the area that seem like really good ones they've since gone off but God kind of preserves them and now the other influen is they've not been under that so it can be hard to understand why is God dealt with us the way he has hey we don't have to worry about that's God's baby he's going to take care of us he'll shelter us throughout the way and he'll bring us through the life goes right out of that shuck right into the wheat that's the way each just done and that's how it worked with us personally as well God sheltered us he has his own path for us and we can just rest in that so as we look now this evening at uh the Philadelphian age this is uh this is I think starts in 1750 it's a long age goes all the way up to I think uh early 1900s I think 1906 I think in the zeusa street to happen that's it's it's a longer age and it's interesting age to look at because this is something that we cover in our history books quite a bit have the Industrial Revolution that's happening in this time period the American Revolution you've got all kinds of interesting things going on and spiritually there's a lot going on as well the when we talk about in Revelation 3:7 these things say he that is Holy he that's true he that ha the key of David when emphas brother Brandon emphasizes this word true as being it's a special word it doesn't mean God's true in the sense that he's not false that he's not being a liar it it means something more than that has he a sense of um being complete perfect as brother Bram uses these phrases talk about perfect realization or or partial realization he says this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true just in the sense it's opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of idea as contrasted with its partial realization and now we can understand he says as never before antitype what happened in the Old Testament contested with type and substance with Shadow and that's kind of what I wanted Lord willing will bring out this evening um looking at the idea of the substance is greater than the Shadow and I I kind of uh express it this way we all uh can have fun with shadows kids will play make little animals there on the wall different things like that well even cats will play with their Shadows it looks like a shadow this cat's been lonely this kitten's been lonely once a playmate and it'll play entain itself quite a while with its shadow but you know what when that cat needs some comfort or something that shadow is not going to come out and embrace it uh that Shadows not the cat and uh we can enjoy shadows in the Old Testament we can enjoy the shadows of things this life is just a shadow of a real life beyond so we can when we're enjoying this life we're kind of like the kitten playing with its shadow we want to press past the Shadow and get to the get to the substance brother Brandon talks about types and shadows the things that happened in the Old Testament the stories that play out they're more than just stories like we've talked about the book of the story of Joseph and we can tell the story of Joseph it's a beautiful story but then when you see the parallels that are packed into that with uh with Jesus Christ even prophetic here to the end times it's more than a story or like King David as he's as he's as he's the as he's been re re rejected by his people by his own son even he's he's leaving and then this shimy is is abusing him throwing things at him and um saying all kinds of terrible things at him David doesn't realize what's happening but he is actually demonstrating in tight form and illustration what's going to happen to Christ later and so he's bearing the reproach of Christ before Christ is even there because he's he's standing as loyal as he can to his poster Duty and he's he's showing us how how how Christ suffered as a rejected King but we say that the substance is greater than the shadow we can look at the shadows in these Old Testament Bible stories and they're just they're they're they're they're amazing they're powerful they're meaningful but when we look at the at the type is that is that powerful just how much greater must the must the must the substance be that's right so I want to look this evening at uh where this phrase the Key of David comes from where the phrase um he that openeth and no man shutteth and shut and no man openeth where those come from because they come from the Old Testament John um he's Jesus is speaking this to John and Jesus is speaking words that he had spoken to Isaiah the prophet hundreds of years earlier and that was the Shadow and now in the church ages it's being quoted again the substance is coming so we're going to take a look how the shadow played out and we'll lay it right on top and see how the substance will be playing out has played out and is still playing out that's kind of what we're looking at this evening um on page one of the notes just kind of want to delve a little more deeply into this idea of the partial realization versus the perfect realization again brother bam says about true is not just opposite the false it's perfect as opposed to to partial in the Bible perfect doesn't mean faultless perf mean complete mature um so he brother brand gives a couple of examples in the church age book Moses didn't give that bread from Heaven Jesus says but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven now the Mana was bread from heaven but as great as that was as satisfying as that was to the children of Israel there on their Wilderness Journeys Christ is so much more satisfying the the man was like play things like the shadow was to the kitty cat but when Christ comes down his life that is that is substance Jesus says I am the true vine when we look at talk about true and false Vines in the church ages that's also very meaningful um Hebrews chapter 9 Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true all the temple worship all the the the instruments that were used there the pieces of furniture that were used there those were just Shadows pointing to what was coming so if you walk into the temple you can see as you walk in you've got the the the the Laver the Brazen Altar and you walk in the Holy the holy place the position of all the furniture if you look at it from above it's in the shape of a cross yeah that's a shadow but my the substance of the Cross when Jesus dies on it oh that's even more meaningful so it's example of partial as opposed to perfect realization and in 1 John 2:8 um the word speaks because the darkness is passed the True Light can now shine so again it's true in the sense it is mature it is uh it is full so we can look in Hebrews chapter 9 we've got the all the sacrifices of the Old Testament that is the the way that God made for his people at that time and he's and he and he's teaching them about what Redemption is I like to think of it all the Old Testament is showing us that God is a Hands-On teacher the priests aren't just telling the people what to do but as they're as they're going through all the feast as they're offering the sacrifices everything that they're doing has has much greater meaning as a symbolic value and because they're participating at the idea is when you're Hands-On learning it'll stick better than if you just if just if if you just have to repeat the lesson and write it down on a piece of paper but that's what the point was of the Old Testament sacrifices there's um Christ was a high priest of good things that come with a greater and more perfect Tabernacle the Tabernacle was wonderful the temple was wonderful but there was a greater and more perfect Tabernacle that that was true and that was mature that was complete the blood of bulls and calves that was what God gave at that time but he comes later with his own blood to make not a temporary Redemption that just covers the sin for a while but an eternal Redemption that completely settles the question and it's important to have this this understanding of of Christ as the as he's he's faithful and holy and true with the mature truth and not just a partial realization because if we look at things with just a a partial life not a full understanding of it then someone might be very grateful to have Jesus in their lives because we all need Jesus's help and that can sound really good think we just need Jesus's help and but we need a lot more than just help Jesus isn't here to to help us he's here to to completely redeem us and Wesley uh um his uh well well he was in uh um at Oxford he and the group of young men that he was teaching with and praying with and studying with um they got this nickname of of methodists because they had a method for everything a method to become to become holy and Wesley understood the grace of God he he leaned upon the grace of God but a movement came up after him called called arminianism which emphasizes the importance of of of of human works in the in in the Salvation mix and if you don't grasp the reality of Jesus Christ is true he's the full realization not just a partial he's he's he's the full if we don't grasp that we will be leaning in some way upon our works and Christ is saying at this as he's as he's greeting the church in Philadelphia he says I am I am he that is Holy he that is true I am complete your works are incomplete what can we what can we hang our hat on what can we hang our life upon we can't hang our life upon our own works there only one thing we can do that's hang our life on Jesus Christ but a lot of modern theology talks about how Jesus helps us I remember some years back um as a uh some of the um really nice books you can get at the Christian bookstore they tell really nice stor to your kids but I was as as I was reading it it was talking about how Christ can help us we can take our problems to Jesus and he can he and he can help us fix our problems and things like that but there was no place in this really nicely illustrated book and everything there was no place it talked about Sin the necessity of repentance it was a really nice story but it was all about Jesus helping us and the song that the modernists would sing is Jesus p La apart and I apart you know we can work together Jesus and I we can make things better we see that sin leaves a little stain in our lives yet we washed it wide as snow this is not the gospel this is almost an Armenian kind of gospel where we have to work together with God but that's not that's not the true gospel brother Brandon talks about this in the church age book that it's not your works at all we don't have we we we don't play a part in this but the true gospel is not that Jesus helps us it's that he saves us he didn't come to make us better he came to resurrect us cuz we were dead in our sins you can't make a dead man better I mean the Undertaker tries to but he has a pretty bad job of it but Christ came to resurrect us we were dead in sins he has to Quicken us we're saved by him not of ourselves it's not of works we are his workmanship we don't have a dog in the fight we're just here Lord save me and and that's and that's the beauty of it and uh when we when we look at Christ being the reality brother Bram says here in the quote at the bottom of page one this age began the years of arminianism that do that does not believe in Christ as the reality it doesn't sing of Nothing but the Blood it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct as long as part of our Salvation depends upon our own conduct we're going to have very fitful walk now he I do believe in God Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we've gone over that but let me tell you salvation is not Jesus plus it's Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it is all all of God let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me his spirit that fills me his word in my heart and mouth his stripes that F fill me Heal me Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life life amen that's a that's a big part of this message here but um as as we kind of move further in looking at the substance is is greater than Shadow when when Christ speaks to John the Beloved about the Philadelphian church he speaks about this key of David that opens any door and brother brandom alludes to the same prophecy here I wasn't the one that discovered it but he's he's alluding to a prophecy from Isaiah CH 22 and this also lets us look at partial and perfect realizations up close because Isaiah 22 that's the type and the story that unfolds there and in later chapters we we'll look at that that's in miniature that illustrates something that will be even greater later on the substance that happens in the Philadelphian age and then also Beyond but the characters in Isaiah 22 will be they reappear later in the story and want to take a look how um they they're going to illustrate the truth brother bam talks about there are two spirits in the framework of the true church it's been the way all the way since Ephesus and these two Vines just keep wrapping themselves around the tree all the way up until the end that's why later on in Revelation three in the message to the Philadelphian church he says I'm going to make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie still here in Philadelphia they're going to be people who are identifying themselves with the true church saying that we're we're part but God says no you're not a you're not a part you are the synagogue of Satan they say we're we're Jews because that's they would have been the Jews would have been the first first Christians would have been been Jewish believers they were're we're we we're Jews we are right he says no you're not you're you're lying about that so the these two Vines are continuing and we can remember this this happens all the way through scripture Lucifer versus Michael these two twins battling and out in heaven that and that and that battle goes on continues down with Cain and Abel they're on the garden they're outside of the Garden of Eden lot versus Abraham ishmail versus Isaac these two as soon as God started to do something Satan's right there very quickly to try to badet Esau and Jacob Kora and Moses Moab under the ministry of balum versus Israel and then we'll look at this sheb and eliakim this evening Judah versus Jesus we'll look at this one tonight but it's all kind of pointing up unto this this this the these twins that are battling even still today at this very end time the Antichrist Spirit against the work of the Holy Spirit even now and and uh Revelation chapter 3 talks about in verse 10 you've kept the word of my patience I will keep you from the hour of Temptation when this Antichrist spirit is going be looking so much like the real but the promise here you've kept the word of my patience I will keep you as well from the hour of Temptation that's what we'll be looking at so we'll look at the the um shadow in the substance here we we we've quoted Revelation 3:7 a couple times now Heath at the Key of David and I want to compare it to the scripture in Isaiah 22 before we go and look at it further Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the house of D will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open that sounds pretty close to Revelation CH 3:7 so we're going to go back and dive into the story that unfolds there so that we can see better um what um what what Christ is meaning here to the philadelphians so these two Spirits are are battling they've been doing that the whole time now they're getting ready to Duke it out and um I Isaiah in the book of Isaiah and the passages in 2 Kings will be think chapters 18 and 19 the background here is that um Hezekiah he becomes king uh when he was just 25 years old and you could remember um hezek um sorry I got my stories mixed up Hezekiah King 25 years old his father was an evil King ahaz he did not have much uh to go on as far as his his natural Tree of Life his natural genealogy goes he had to separate from a lot he didn't have a good inheritance from his father ahaz um Hezekiah he leads a remarkable Reformation there in the in is in in in Judah repentance um he leads an amazing uh um U Passover I think it had been thousands of uh of cattle are actually offered as part of these sacrifices just the greatest Passover I think that been been been uh celebrated in hundreds of years it's just he he does some remarkable things here he even attempts to he's attempting to purge the nation of idolatry he's doing things in the spiritual front he's also preparing his National defenses the the Bible talks about how even um introduced new systems of wells and aqueducts to prepare the cities in case there seizures would would would come well two of the men who work with Isaiah with with Hezekiah then were men named shebna and eliakim maybe we could just turn over to Isaiah chapter 22 as we catch the background I've got some of this on the slide but not all of it so Isaiah um is prophesying now to Hezekiah I believe in verse 15 thus sayth the Lord God of hosts go get thee un this treasure even unto shebna which is over the house and say it's important she's position right now he is over the entire house he's the he's the treasur it's a position of of great responsibility verse 16 what have you here and who H and whom hast thou here that thou Hast hewed thee out of Seiler here is he that Heth him out of the Seiler on high and that graveth in habitation for himself in a rock it seems like a strange thing for Isaiah the prophet to be speaking to this treasur but what it's pointing to is shebna has not been doing his work very Faithfully as the treasur how is he able to afford this beautiful uh Seiler it's not really easy to to hide all of his money um he didn't have didn't have Bitcoin and things then so he's investing it and he's giving this this this this beautiful Seiler this this this real estate he's abusing his power and God's calling him out on it because Hezekiah is going to need Faithful Men around him shebna is not a faithful man and this is what Hezekiah is going to be Isaiah is going to be talking about remember there are two spirits in the framework of the true church and right now Hezekiah has somebody who's probably of the wrong Spirit at his right hand overseeing everything a little bit like Judas and Jesus Judas was the treasure he was overseeing things for Christ and ultimately betrayed him and shebna is is of a similar ilk so he says um behold the Lord will carry you away with a mighty captivity and he will surely cover you shebna you're planning on staying here and having a good life here in Jerusalem you're planning all the way out into the future you will have a great uh a great tomb you have great uh things engraved and stoned about you you think you're going to end your life here I've got different plans for you the Lord will carry you away with a mighty captivity he will surely cover thee he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country and there shalt thou die there the Chariots of thy Glory shall be the shame of thy Lord's house and I will drive thee from thy station and from thy State shall he pull thee down so everything that shb has been investing in here in Jerusalem God says it's for nothing because you are all going into captivity I'm going to make sure you go there too and you're going to die there anybody you you've been enriching yourself out of Hezekiah out of my own house perhaps even and I'm going to make sure you pay for it and then he goes on and it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my servant eliakim the son of hilk and I think it's interesting to even look at the names she's name um just means Vigor and a lot of people can do jobs with Vigor but um I kind of think about it as sheb had his Zeal but not according to knowledge he was he was vigorous for for his own work but eliakim means god raises God sets up eliakim had his strength through his in his through his position God positioned him there and God uh and God strength stred him and blessed him there and it is thought that shebna was a gentile serving in the court of Jerusalem because his name isn't a Hebrew name and there's no genealogy given usually when Hebrew names are given in the Bible you'll say so and so the son of so and so the son of so and so and it's just Sheva comes out of nowhere so it's thought he might be this Gentile serving there how we got there isn't known but um perhaps it was in the reign of ahaz hezekiah's father but he was obviously not a true servant because he was mainly concerned about enriching himself but eliakim he's going to be of a different kind entirely God raises him up and verse and and and this is remember this is when we talk about the eliakim and shebna this is just a partial realization of what's going to come this is just the shadow so if God is faithful in the shadow how much more is God faithful in the substance if we see God's faithfulness in these Bible stories how much more is God faithful when it comes to our lives when it comes to the the great time of Temptation is going to come we don't have to worry about God being faithful in the future he's faithful to us now he was faithful to us then substance is greater than Shadow so verse 21 my servant Eliah him I will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy gir and I will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open and I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious Throne to his father's house I really like verse 23 it it comes up a couple times in the Bible a nail in a sure Place how can we look at how can a nail be speaking of even of of of of Christ but um I can remember one time we had a nail in a sure place is a very important thing I remember one time when we lived in the Netherlands um we invited my in-laws over for dinner and we were all at the kitchen table together having a nice uh nice homecooked meal for my wife and in the middle of the meal there's this crash that happens behind us we all look behind us and this big mirror that had been hung on the wall crashed to the ground the nail had not been set in a sure place because probably my wife had been asking me for weeks honey could you please hang this up for me could you please hang this up for me could you pleas hang this up for me so I didn't grab the hammer one night I was away and she grabbed the hammer and she just packed it up there she likes to hang things up with thumb tacks make the hole as small as possible this wasn't with a thumbtack but you know she put that nail there and right in front of my father-in-law that comes crashing down that's not when you want those things to happen and you know what we don't want that kind of thing to happen in our lives when there's a time that we want things to turn out right that everything that we've hung our life upon has not been hung Upon A a strong nail in a sure place the right-hand man of Hezekiah was shebna and he wasn't a nail he wasn't a strong nail that that that Hezekiah could hang his King Deon and Hezekiah and God is merciful to Hezekiah he knows the Temptation that is going to be coming on Hezekiah where the devil's going to try to surround him and completely shut him in the Kingdom down just like as Christ looking through the church ages at the end of this Philadelphian age is L de is coming on how the Antichrist spirit trying to encircle the church and just strangle It Through The ecumenical Spirit he's looking on just like God was Isaiah was looking through hezekiah's time is snack RB's coming the king of Assyria is coming you're going to need a nail in a sure place you're going to need this the key of the city of David so that you can make it through these times because the devil's going to try to shut every single door but this key of the House of David it'll keep the doors open as long as it need to be open when it's under to shut that door that key will shut up and the devil can't ever get in that's what that's what Hezekiah needed and God's looking forward to the church AG he says that's what the church is going to need in the time of Philadelphia in the time of laa we want to have a we want to have Christ up into our hearts so much so that we can get the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that key is closed the devil can't get in that's what that key of the House of David has to talk about is it talks about the position where you're completely secure and God says Hezekiah you need to nail on the sure place you need that key of the House of David and God provides it through eliakim and he provides it in our time as well so we just want to kind of follow along uh this particular um Bible story here this in this Shadow so Isaiah foretold a couple things in the prophecy we just read that shebna is going to be demoted at the beginning shebna the treasure is over all the house but Isaiah says he's going to be demoted and eliakim is going to take his position and then in spite of the riches he's a master in Jerusalem shebna is going to be brought as a captive to a far country and he's going to die there and anybody who built their hopes around shabna's power is going to fall with him that's what we just read now we're going to follow along what happens here now in I let's turn over to Isaiah chapter 36 and we will see how this plays out Isaiah 36 and 37 I think they parallel uh 2 Kings 18 and 19 now it came to pass in the 14th year of King Hezekiah that sakb king of Assyria came up against all the defense cities of Judah and took them and the king of Assyria sent RAB Shaka from leish to Jerusalem to king ezekiah with a great Army leish was another walled City uh a Judean City an Israelite City and they had already surrounded that City and now uh sakra is sending Messengers from Lees over to Jerusalem and uh they go to King Hezekiah with their great Army and Hezekiah stood by the conduit of the upper pool and the highway of the Fuller's field pay attention to verse three then came forth unto him eliakim hilah's son which was over the house and shebna the Scribe what had just been prophesied in Isaiah 22 shebna was over the house and now demotion and promotion had been prophesied eliakim is now over the house and shebna is the Scribe God has already taken care of this it was prophesied if God's faithful in the type he's going to be faithful in the substance as well so sheb is just the Scribe the secretary then joah asf's son the recorder also goes long and um the prophecy is being uh is being fulfilled here and if you read what goes on in uh in Second Kings 18:19 and Isaiah chapter 36 rabsha comes and um they start uh it's it's uh it's just complete Assyrian propaganda they're making all these announcements in the Jewish language that everybody on the inside of the wall can hear what's being said the king and his Messengers say hey guys please can you please just talk to us in the Syrian we can do we can handle that said no we're not talking to you we're talking to the people behind you because the devil is dealing with fear he wants to make everybody fear and that's what he's trying to do here well what happens um at first in this story um Hezekiah um he doesn't respond as Faithfully as we would have liked keep your finger in in Isaiah 36 let's go over to 2 Kings 18 and we'll see how this plays out because you will see that ezekiah needs a nail in a sure place because he goes through some pretty shaking times so 2 Kings 18 and uh and verse 13 again it parallels Isaiah 36 in the 14th year of King ezekias and Acra king of Assyria came up against the cities of Judah and took them it says Hezekiah king of Syria king of Judah rather sent to the king of Assyria delaa saying hey I've offended return from me that which you put on me I will bear so this is a little bit different response this is not a really faith-filled response basically Hezekiah says I will pay what you ask me to pay just leave me alone and the king of Assyria appointed into Hezekiah king of Judah 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold a lot of money where does Hezekiah get the money Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord and in the Treasures of the King's house he's plundering God's house and this next verse just when they saw this it just amazed me at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the Temple of the Lord from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and he gave it to the king of Assyria so the beautiful gold that was overlay the the post the temple the doorways of the temple Hezekiah needs to get this gold so instead of going to the Altar and praying initially he's going along and with with their chisels getting all the I'm not sure how they did that but I'm imagine with with this chisel they're taking all this off boxing it up melting I don't know how how they did it but what are they doing that which is most important it's like they're they're they're ripping away God's glory to buy off this this this this this Pagan King and what does what impact does that have as they then next couple days go under the anybody who goes into the temple to pray you look around and you're not seeing images of God's strength and power anymore you're seeing we have debased our Temple these are reminders about how God wasn't there to help us but how we leaned upon the arm of Flesh not the not the arm of God ah wow this talk about condemnation they're right in it's just like if they go all their faults surrounding them in the very place that their faith should be being lifted up the devil is so subtle in how he works but that's what Hezekiah did he tried to buy off the devil it doesn't work we can try to buy off the devil get extra time good behavior whatever we do it's not going to work because what does uh what does sakb do he stays away for a while a little bit later he comes again with more forces he comes right there to Jerusalem and we can see what happens let's see I got to get my notes together this is where the RAB shika comes uh with this intimidating message and um we can catch this over in yep and and in in sorry 2 Kings 19 RAB Shake's speech is uh he's saying why how can you even lean upon god um God isn't he's not going to deliver you none of the none of the gods that sakb has come up against other countries have been able to overcome sakb he's not going to deliver you and uh um when Hezekiah hears this 2 Kings 19:1 he he he tears his clothes covers himself with sackcloth and he goes into the house of the Lord this is the same house of the Lord that he has just defaced that he robbed of its uh gold and and and silver so as he's going into the house of the Lord he's seeing reminders of his own weakness he's seeing reminders how he's failed God so many times and how much weaker he must then feel but he sent eliakim eliakim was this man that he know he knows Sak is coming he wants to close every door but I'm going to put a a man in a sure place a nail in a sure place with the key of the House of David here again liim he was over the household to take shb the Scribe he'd been demoted and they go to Isaiah the prophet son of amamos and uh they say to Isaiah this is a day of trouble rebuke and blasphemy and I just kind of think about this situation that Hezekiah finds himself in it's kind of similar to Revelation 3:10 I will keep you from the hour of Temptation where the Antichrist spirit is trying to hem Us in trying to trying to surround us choke us from all life that's what sakb was doing but God had a nail in a sure Place Hezekiah could hang his life upon there was a key of the House of David that would open every door and Isaiah um Isaiah tells him speaks to him and Isaiah verse 6 speaks to these Messengers thus shall you say to your master thus says the Lord be not afraid of The Words which you've heard with which the Servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear of a uh of a rumor returning to his own land and I will cause him to Fall by The Sword in his own land well when uh um Hezekiah gets back the messagers come back the devil also delivers a message Isaiah sends a message back with of of encouragement at the same time that sakra with rabika sends another message and um here's what rika's message says verse 10 let not thy God in whom you trust deceive you saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria isn't that just like the devil as soon as you've gotten the message of deliverance from God the devil's right there God did God just tell you this don't trust it it's not true parallel tracks God sending a message the devil's right there to tear it down so you won't believe it did God just say about this behold you've heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shall you be delivered the devil asks questions to get you to provide the answer to they're rhetorical questions so that you provide the answer when you're providing an answer to his questions you're almost in agreement with him so when the devil's asking questions let him talk to the hand don't give him the time of day otherwise you're participating in his plot to deceive you have the gods of the Nations delivered them which my father have destroyed as Goen heran Reef Etc where is the king of a where is the king of arpa Etc and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of The Messengers and he read it then Hezekiah takes this letter he walks down to the temple he walks past the same pillars that he had stripped the gold from he's walking past these reminders of how he himself had failed we have to walk past the reminders of our own failures because the devil get these pillars say yep you failed here you failed there don't go any further but he had this letter he had to he had to talk to God about this letter so he goes further he goes to the doorway that he had just stripped the gold from the silver from all the precious things the says hey what's so precious about your walk with God you stripped the very value of it yourself it's nothing valuable there but Hezekiah has to walk past that the devil's doing everything he can by hezekiah's own faults to keep him back from God and he goes fth and he goes into the very Temple itself and he goes in and lays this letter before the presence of God there on the ark and there are not very many prayers that are recorded word for word in the Old Testament but this is one of them and Hezekiah to take such steps past his own failures that the devil had Memorial memorialized so so poignantly he stepped past them got past himself as God I can't handle this letter anymore this letter that I got from sakb stole all the peace that Isaiah had given me Lord I need to hear from you I just heard from the prophet I don't I need more than prophet's words right now I need your words right now Isaiah had spoken about now he's not sending people to Isaiah anymore he's going to God himself and that's what we need to do we need to have a personal walk with God and God will Design things in our life so that we can't just pick up the phone and call somebody else we get on our knees and seek God ourselves in prayer and God will answer Hezekiah he he spreads this letter there in in verse verse 14 he he he spreads this letter before the Lord and he prays this oh Lord God of is Israel which dwelleth between the cherubims thou are the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou H has made Heaven and Earth Lord bow down thine ear and hear Open Lord thine eyes and see hear the words of sakra which has sent him to reproach the Living God of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations in their land they have cast their gods to the fire for they weren't real Gods with the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore have they destroy them now therefore oh Lord Our God I beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God even thou only amen and God heard the prayers of this king who had just backslidden some months before stripped the value of that out of his testimony stri the value of the temple he felt rotten but you know when we feel rotten have nowhere else to go we go as a rotten person to the throne of God and God accepts us and he hears us he hears Hezekiah and Hezekiah shortly thereafter got word back and you know what um he says that uh this King sakb he goes back into his own land he does hear a rumor just like Isaiah had heard he goes back into his own land and as this God as this an ACB in verse 37 it came to pass as he was worshiping in the house of nro his God God that the damac and sherzer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped in the land of Armenia and his son reigned in his dead this is exactly what God had said would happen through Isaiah the prophet and the Sak's God wasn't able to protect him from his own son this again is the shadow this faithful man eliakim when he's getting when when Hezekiah is getting all kinds of conflicting messages all kinds of conflicting messages if shebna the Scribe been over there this treasure might have been saying we can't afford it King we can't do this King we can't do this King but he had a faithful man a true man next to him who could speak truth go back and forth to the prophet with him shebna just went along as a Lackey but eliakim was faithful and true and that's what God knew this King needed because he had this key of the House of David as sakb tries to close every door this key opens it when sakb tries to try to bust everything open this key keeps it closed that's what that's what they needed and next time when we look in the age of Philadelphia as we maybe we can look over in Revelation chapter 3 we can see what's described toward the end of it when brother brandom talks about the Philadelphia age and the leodan age he sees says these these two ages they they fade into one another there's there's a like this this lapping over periods they go from one to the other very quickly because the last stage is is is is is is is short and this this work that starts in Philadelphia comes into a quick fruition in La DEA and you can see that the devil is fighting tooth and nail um that's why you see in verse in verse 10 about this hour of Temptation is kind of looms over the devil's trying to to to to uh to strangle the seed before it uh before it gets any more light but um the message message here is the devil's going to try to close every door he's going to try to strangle but you've got the key of the House of David he is faithful and true if you think this story about shebna and eliakim was powerful that's just the shadow because when when we go through tough times and brother bam says this hour of Temptation This has to do with the ecumenical movement drawing everything together to shut down the true church that's going to be powerful but you've got the key of the House of De David there and then then no then the devil can't shut any door that's a that's a um that God opens he can't open the door that God shuts the bottom of page uh four because um he goes on to say to them because you've taken my word and lived by it and thereby become patient I will keep you from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now here again we see the overlapping of the two ages Philadelphia and ludia for This Promise has to do with the end of the Gentile period which culminates in the Great Tribulation I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said it but it said I will keep you from the hour of Temptation this temptation is exactly like the temp ation in in Eden it'll be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it'll be so very right so enlightening and lifegiving as to fool the world only the elect will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows The ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one we saw a video of that last month it's is so deceptive it'll become so strong politically that she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles little groups will lose Charters privileges Etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people but the promise here is you've got the key of the House of David that keeps every door open needs to be open keep every door shut that needs to be shut and that [Music] key you can look at uh uh page three what does the key signify we don't usually have a key on our shoulder usually keys in a hand or some people might wear Keys around their neck but why is this being written as the key is on its shoulder what does the shoulder have to do with it and somewhere else the shoulders important the government shall be upon his shoulders as prophesied brother am says the bottom of page three the government shall be upon his shoulder it comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom as she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signify not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care that he and he alone no one else nor their man nor their power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David the Key of David has to do with our position that we are the Bride of Christ and in that position we're completely safe we're completely secure and that's a beautiful thing and it's not just the key of the House of David it's not just about a key and a door yes the the Philadelphian age was a was a missionary age every door seem to be open missionaries went around the world but uh it could it speaks of a special relationship being between Christ and the believer our hearts can be locked sometimes it yet God's key can open that locked heart the devil tries to P push so many complexes upon us so many things in our past so our heart can just stay locked to him but that key of the House of David can open those closed Hearts so they can be restored so this age of the open door is much more than just a missionary age as God's word has been restored relationships with his people can be restored as well and when this Keys open the doors of our hearts the devil can't shut those doors either and when the Kia's closed doors were completely sealed he can't open and burst himself in there either we have security there so I was just amazed as we were getting into the uh into this Philadelphian age I'd uh never expected there to be so much in this very beginning about I'm the key of the House of David the open door I thought that's was just the missionary age but verse 8 says I've set before thee an open door and what is it this Open Door well Christ is the door as he's he's setting himself up before us he's revealing more to him of himself to us so we can come into a closer relationship with us Jesus is the door he's the door of the sheep and now it speaks of a door opening I set before you an open door this is a revelation of himself and it's that Revelation that brings us strength which is what we need in hour of Temptation that gives us illumination that glorifies his name and it's in the midst of these last to ages at the revelation of who Christ is blossoms out before us so next time Lord willing we'll talk more about uh what actually goes on in the age we see now if the shadow is that powerful the substance is even more powerful amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us your grace to us Lord father I know uh circumstances in life can uh can uh can happen situations just happen Lord that can lock us all up that can uh Lord keep us from hearing your word just be caused of such confusion Lord Lord I just pray that you would bring that key into our hearts Lord they might be unlocked and Open Lord so that you can fill every fiber of our being so that when we're completely filled that heart can be just locked up again so we're completely safe with you oh God Lord that's what we talking about but they brought Paul's been talk about the baptism the Holy Spirit Lord father sometimes the spirit can become cloudy and Lord we just pray that your your light will come over that and will open up our spirit the word can strike that your light can strike this strike our soul oh God lord I pray that your light would strike that seed on the inside will start taking root and growing and growing and growing oh God pray you strengthen each one oh Lord father we just ask a special blessing also brother Paul and his family pray you grant them uh the rest that they need in this week oh Lord in Jesus name Amen brother Michael you want to come ahead thank you God bless you all [Music] his strength is perfect when all strength

know that this word is um is true and it's not about our we what we do but what God can do for us and it's not about efforts but what he is doing in US amen so the glory and all the honor goes back to
