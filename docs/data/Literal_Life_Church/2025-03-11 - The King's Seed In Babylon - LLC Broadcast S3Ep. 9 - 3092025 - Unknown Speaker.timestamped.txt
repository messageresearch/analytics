[7:51] more I want
[7:57] more Jesus
[8:03] let's just read this and see if we can
[8:04] learn something from it here this
[8:05] morning Daniel chapter 1 verse one in
[8:09] the third year of the reign of jerim
[8:12] king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King
[8:15] of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged
[8:18] it and the lord gave jerim king of Judah
[8:21] into his hand with part of the vessels
[8:23] of the house of God which he carried
[8:25] into the land of Shar to the house of
[8:27] his God and he brought the vess into the
[8:30] Treasure House of his God and the King
[8:33] spake unto aspenes the master of his
[8:35] unic that he should bring certain of the
[8:38] children of Israel now there are many
[8:40] that went in this Exile from Jerusalem
[8:43] because they rebelled against God there
[8:45] was about three stages stages of it and
[8:49] uh there was many thousands that were
[8:52] taken out of Jerusalem taken captive for
[8:53] 70 years taken right to Babylon but in
[8:56] this he asked for certain ones and he
[8:58] said bring certain of the children of
[9:00] Israel and of the king's seed everybody
[9:03] say King Seed King seed so
[9:05] Nebuchadnezzar's choosing the king's
[9:09] seed the royalty out of all of them and
[9:12] of the princes children so now he's
[9:15] picked the children in whom was no
[9:17] blemish but well favored and skillful in
[9:19] all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and
[9:22] understanding science and such as had
[9:24] ability in them to stand in the king
[9:26] Palace and whom they might teach the
[9:29] learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans
[9:32] which is the language of Babylon I'm
[9:33] going to take these young people that
[9:36] have grown up in this home that believed
[9:39] in Jehovah and I'm going to indoctrinate
[9:41] them change their language change
[9:43] everything in fact verse 5 says the king
[9:45] appointed them a daily provision of the
[9:47] king's meat and the wine which he drank
[9:49] so nourishing them three years that at
[9:51] the end thereof they might stand before
[9:53] the king now among these were the
[9:55] children of Judah Daniel hananiah Michel
[9:58] and Azariah unto whom the prince of the
[10:00] Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel
[10:03] the name of Bel chazar hananiah Shadrach
[10:07] uh Misha of meach and Azariah AB Indo
[10:10] which were all Babylonian names I want
[10:13] you to notice here the
[10:15] enemy we think when he would go to
[10:17] Babylon that he's trying to actually
[10:19] make them uh at the start worldly but no
[10:23] the the deeper agenda was to change
[10:26] their diet change their language and
[10:29] change change their names which means to
[10:31] change their identity right that's a
[10:34] pretty subtle subtle enemy amen okay so
[10:37] it's not come on we're having fun over
[10:39] here in Babylon that's party no this was
[10:40] a different type of subtle Act of the
[10:43] enemy for our children but Daniel
[10:45] purposed in his heart that he would not
[10:48] defile himself with the portion of the
[10:50] king's meat nor with the wine which he
[10:51] drank therefore he requested of the
[10:53] prince of the Unix that he might not
[10:55] defile himself God brought Daniel into
[10:59] favor and tender love with the prince of
[11:00] the Unix and the prince of the Unix said
[11:02] unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who
[11:05] hath appointed your meat and your drink
[11:07] for why should he see your faces worse
[11:09] liking than the children which is of
[11:11] your short of your sort then shall he
[11:13] make me in danger my head to the king
[11:16] then said Daniel to Meltzer and I'm just
[11:18] going to skip ahead cuz I think you
[11:19] should know the story from Sunday school
[11:22] and on that Daniel challenged him saying
[11:25] you feed them the king's meat you feed
[11:27] us pulp and just just eat we won't eat
[11:30] the king's meat test us for 10 days
[11:33] verse 14 so he consented to them in this
[11:35] matter and proved them 10 days and at
[11:37] the end of the 10 days their
[11:39] countenances appeared fairer and fatter
[11:41] In the Flesh than all the children which
[11:44] did eat the portion of the king's meat
[11:46] thus Meltzer took away the portion of
[11:47] their meat and the wine that they should
[11:49] drink and gave them pulse as for these
[11:51] four children God gave them knowledge
[11:54] and skill and all learning and wisdom
[11:55] and Daniel had understanding in all
[11:58] visions and dreams So Daniel was a
[12:00] prophet so you can expect that but for
[12:02] all of them what did God give them
[12:05] discernment understanding
[12:09] Revelation and you know what you need to
[12:11] live in Babylon more than anything
[12:14] Revelation understanding wisdom to know
[12:17] white and right and wrong and he
[12:19] anointed them with that kind of
[12:21] anointing so they could live in this
[12:23] subtle uh perversion now at the end of
[12:26] the days that the king said he should
[12:28] bring them in that the prince of the
[12:29] Unix brought them in before
[12:31] Nebuchadnezzar and the king communed
[12:33] with them and among them all was found
[12:36] none like Daniel hananiah Michel and
[12:38] Azariah therefore stood they before the
[12:41] king and in all matters of wisdom and
[12:44] understanding that the king inquired of
[12:46] them he found them these four 10 times
[12:52] better than all the magicians and
[12:55] astrologers that were in all his realm
[12:58] Daniel contining even un the first year
[13:01] of King Cyrus I want to speak this
[13:03] morning on the king's seed in babyon if
[13:07] you don't mind this morning I I really
[13:11] uh feel led to give Satan a real heavy
[13:16] punch this morning because how many
[13:17] knows that Satan is real how many knows
[13:20] he's here in the service this morning
[13:23] yeah he's he's very faithful to come to
[13:24] church more faithful than some of
[13:27] you he's always here uh but then you
[13:31] know there Comes A Time sometimes when
[13:33] you get a bit irritated at the enemy and
[13:36] I might say this that sometimes he's not
[13:38] reminded uh of the things that have
[13:41] happened for 6,000 years of history of
[13:44] God's people and Satan uh allowing these
[13:48] things to happen of trials and
[13:49] tribulations and all kinds of
[13:51] Temptations and sometimes they even fall
[13:53] by it Israel's in Babylon because she
[13:55] rebelled against God and so they were in
[13:58] captivity 7 years so they have their
[14:00] mistakes they have all these things but
[14:02] but I just want to give the enemy a
[14:04] punch this morning and really uh speak
[14:06] to him because you know uh we realize
[14:10] that Satan I guess I was thinking of it
[14:12] this morning I was asking my son-in-law
[14:14] the differences between Alzheimer's and
[14:17] and uh dementia and uh because I I find
[14:20] that Satan is probably has the worst
[14:23] case of
[14:24] dementia and Alzheimer's as anybody
[14:29] because you look in the Bible and you
[14:31] see every time he has tried to bring
[14:34] God's people into situations that I'll
[14:37] get them they're finished it's over it's
[14:39] done and every time in history God has
[14:43] stood by his people every time I want to
[14:46] remind the enemy of
[14:49] that as you know I've been breaking down
[14:51] this series of the time of trouble and
[14:54] I've spoken so many details by the help
[14:57] of the Lord of how hard it is right now
[14:59] now this is a season we live in that's
[15:01] very different than even a 100 years ago
[15:03] even 50 years ago and so with the
[15:05] discernment of the word and my studies
[15:07] we can really tell things like they are
[15:09] we can really say how bad it really is I
[15:12] can go all the into the perversion of
[15:14] Hollywood I can go into the perversion
[15:16] and and the the corruption in politics I
[15:19] can expose the demon power that's behind
[15:21] Hollywood and politics and everything
[15:23] else and I can give the reason why there
[15:26] is unprecedented uh TR
[15:29] with mental illness and depression in
[15:31] this hour it's not like it was a 100
[15:33] years ago but it's very different now I
[15:36] can go into the darkness and Isaiah said
[15:38] Gross Darkness will be upon the people
[15:41] here we are in
[15:42] 2025 and here you are living in that
[15:45] type of gross Darkness with all this
[15:47] mental illness and all this extreme of
[15:50] what Satan brings and yet you have to
[15:52] ask the question why did God put us here
[15:55] why did he allow me and I can just say
[15:58] God knew of this darkness and he has you
[16:02] here for a
[16:03] [Applause]
[16:05] reason he has you here in this age in
[16:08] this time and it's not to be somebody
[16:10] who just survives there's going to be
[16:13] some Overcomers can can I get a hand
[16:15] this morning there's going to be some
[16:18] Overcomers I got young people in this
[16:20] assembly they're say I don't want to be
[16:22] a statistic I don't want to be like the
[16:24] rest of the millions of young people who
[16:26] fall and give their lives to
[16:27] lasciviousness and all kinds of lust I
[16:30] want to stand for God for Holiness in
[16:32] this hour and Satan I want to remind you
[16:35] we have some young people that are like
[16:37] these men that are standing up in the
[16:39] midst of
[16:41] Babylon I could have them stand up today
[16:44] they're standing for Holiness they're
[16:46] standing for the word of God they
[16:48] believe this message with all their
[16:49] heart some of them are 1314 which is
[16:52] what Daniel's friends they're about
[16:54] history shows are about 14 years old
[16:56] when they had to leave their families
[16:58] leave their comforter of their homes be
[17:00] taken captive and put into this
[17:02] situation some of our groups uh this
[17:04] morning are that age I love seeing these
[17:07] young men down here that are Amen in me
[17:09] these young men this is like this is
[17:11] wonderful to have young men they don't
[17:13] need to be here this world would like
[17:16] them the last place this world and Satan
[17:18] would like to have them is in this
[17:20] church listening to this preacher and
[17:23] listening to God but guess what there's
[17:25] some men on the front row sitting here
[17:27] this morning
[17:33] so excuse me but I'm going to put some
[17:35] of this in Satan's face this
[17:37] morning sometimes you got to you can't
[17:40] let Satan's howling and his intimidation
[17:44] sometimes you take something that God
[17:46] has done and you put it right in Satan's
[17:49] face and sometimes we can talk so much
[17:52] about the conditions that we live in
[17:55] that it can become overwhelming just
[17:57] talking about it and we can can get a
[17:59] bit too
[18:00] negative and actually we might even
[18:02] gloat a little bit that we know so much
[18:04] about the hour we're living in message
[18:07] Believers we understand it we know it we
[18:09] can glow a little bit we understand all
[18:11] that's going on and all those bad people
[18:13] out there and we don't have perfect
[18:14] people here and you're a human being so
[18:16] you're susceptible to Temptation without
[18:19] the holy ghost in your life you'll fall
[18:21] just like them you make mistakes like
[18:25] them and so uh because of that negative
[18:28] and how it becomes kind of depressing to
[18:31] talk I want to uh I want to take some
[18:34] things this morning that would encourage
[18:36] us and also as I said I want to put some
[18:38] things in the face of the devil and Ry
[18:40] I'd like to remind everyone this morning
[18:42] that God has a purpose for putting us
[18:45] under these
[18:47] conditions God has something that he's
[18:50] doing that's a whole lot bigger than the
[18:53] conditions the demon Spirits the demon
[18:56] power your mind that gets overloaded
[18:59] none of this would be happening unless
[19:01] God allowed it to get this bad it would
[19:06] not happen unless God allowed
[19:08] it what happened in your life this past
[19:11] year it wouldn't happen unless God
[19:13] allowed
[19:15] it so it's time that we grow up and look
[19:18] at things through God's eyes and say my
[19:21] God knew everything that would happen my
[19:24] God allowed it for a purpose I don't
[19:26] want to say he created it but he allowed
[19:29] it because God has an agenda for your
[19:31] life he has an achievement he has
[19:33] something that he needs to get out of
[19:35] your life he has to crush the rose he
[19:38] has to crush because you can't get to
[19:41] what's inside of you until you're
[19:44] crushed a little
[19:46] bit and the sweet smell of God starts to
[19:50] come from your
[19:51] life I want whatever is in me of Christ
[19:55] I want it to be
[19:56] squeezed squeezed
[19:59] so it comes
[20:00] forth and he can God can breathe it
[20:07] in there that's what I want from his
[20:11] life not
[20:13] bitterness not
[20:15] hatred not I'm a
[20:19] victim but that surrender that
[20:21] sacrificial life that God just breathes
[20:24] in and say look at what I've allowed my
[20:26] children to go through and what I'm
[20:28] getting back as a sweet smelling Savor
[20:30] to God they're back in church again
[20:32] lifting their hands and saying God I
[20:35] have nothing left to do but to worship
[20:37] to dance to praise
[20:43] Hallelujah so this morning you can lift
[20:45] your hand you can worship you can dance
[20:47] if you want to and I guarantee you the
[20:49] devil don't like that when you're
[20:51] dancing and shouting and saying God is
[20:53] good to me he's been so good to
[20:56] me Satan I'm not just a survivor of
[21:00] leoda I'm an overcomer and I will
[21:03] overcome these
[21:04] [Music]
[21:04] [Applause]
[21:06] things I want to remind you that the
[21:09] troubles come because God allowed it
[21:11] second Corinthians and it's and his seed
[21:13] his seed will always Triumph 2
[21:16] Corinthians 2:14 now thanks be unto God
[21:19] which always causeth us to Triumph in
[21:23] Christ and maketh manifest the Savor of
[21:27] his knowledge Revelation making manifest
[21:30] the Savor of his Revelation by us in
[21:34] every place we serve a God that will
[21:37] always cause his seed to Triumph are you
[21:40] listening this morning I don't care what
[21:42] you've been through I don't care what
[21:43] you're going through now we serve a God
[21:46] that will cause his people his seed to
[21:49] Triumph in
[21:51] everything and this last part he said to
[21:53] make manifest what's he's manifesting
[21:56] something the Savor of his knowledge of
[21:58] his Revelation and Satan's going how did
[22:01] they do that I did everything to them
[22:04] how did they come in that they're still
[22:05] shouting they're still praising God
[22:07] Satan he's befuddled I don't understand
[22:09] these people I've been dealing with them
[22:11] for 6,000 years and every time they come
[22:14] out of it it's because Revelation and
[22:17] knowledge the Savor of his Revelation is
[22:20] bigger than the trial it's bigger than
[22:22] Satan's
[22:26] Temptation because he said
[22:30] Revelation he said when you have it the
[22:33] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[22:37] somebody shout
[22:39] hallelujah he's messing with something
[22:41] that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[22:43] against it they never will Satan are you
[22:46] listening you don't get the final
[22:50] [Applause]
[22:54] say if it's if it's the Royal seed if
[22:57] it's the king seed
[22:59] but I believe I'm preaching to the king
[23:00] seed this morning if it's the king seed
[23:03] Satan I want to let you know you never
[23:05] you never get the final say you never
[23:09] get the final
[23:11] word you have never got it and you won't
[23:14] get it with this bride as well you'll
[23:16] never have the final say you'll never
[23:19] get the final
[23:20] [Applause]
[23:22] word you know what the final say final
[23:25] words is when people are bickering and
[23:27] they keep going they keep going till
[23:30] somebody wants the final say the final
[23:31] word husband and wife sometimes going
[23:34] back and forth cuz they're fighting I
[23:36] want the final word the final word and
[23:38] Satan has done that throughout history
[23:39] and he does in our lives but he needs to
[23:41] know he the the devil's
[23:45] dimentia right the devil's Alzheimer's I
[23:50] don't have Alzheimer's I have
[23:53] halfers I remember half of stuff and
[23:56] other stuff I remember but Satan's
[23:58] really bad because he's not looking
[24:00] Satan you're not looking at the whole
[24:02] history here and the Bible proves over
[24:04] and over again every time you messed
[24:07] with God's seed Satan every time you do
[24:11] it I'm probably going to get attacked
[24:13] this week by the enemy cuz I know he
[24:15] don't like this but I'm going to tell
[24:17] him what the truth is whether he listens
[24:18] anyway every time you mess with God's
[24:22] seed God got the final say let's go back
[24:26] to the beginning he never got the final
[24:27] say with Eve he thought man I have done
[24:29] the worst damage to the human beings
[24:31] this is going to this is going to be
[24:32] Perpetual sin I've got Eve to fall from
[24:35] the word of God and now something has
[24:37] happened to to turn all this around
[24:39] Satan's gloating a little bit God comes
[24:41] out and says I'll curse you to the
[24:43] ground and he says your seed he said
[24:46] your seed will bruise his heel prophesy

[25:31] the final say with Joseph Satan didn't
[25:33] get the final say Joseph put in prison
[25:37] Joseph looks like everything was all the
[25:39] dreams everything that's spoken over his
[25:41] life was going to finish he's put in
[25:42] prison but then he's brought out then
[25:45] he's accused then all this stuff

[25:48] innocent the seed of God is innocent
[25:50] through the blood of Jesus Christ Satan
[25:53] comes and makes him do something and
[25:54] accuses him and all of a sudden now the
[25:56] it looks like the Innocence is gone but
[25:58] God stood for Joseph and raised him to
[26:00] the right hand of pharaoh and listen now

[26:05] throughout history Satan you can't mess
[26:07] with God's seed and come out with the
[26:09] final say with David's life God had the
[26:12] final say with the disciples God had the
[26:15] final say with the church that had
[26:17] raised up at Pentecost then that seed
[26:19] went in the ground and went into
[26:21] churchianity and denominationalism for
[26:23] many many years but listen listen it
[26:26] didn't end up the Dark Ages God had the
[26:28] final say he said it shall be light
[26:31] about the evening
