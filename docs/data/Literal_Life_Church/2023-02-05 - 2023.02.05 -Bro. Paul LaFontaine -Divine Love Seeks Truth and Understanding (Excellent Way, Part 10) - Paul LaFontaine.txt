TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 3 if you don't mind joining me in that and my wife and I will be away and my granddaughter and son-in-law will be away a few days vacation brother Boaz will Minister next Sunday for us and some other help here as well so we look forward to hearing in we always try to listen into the services even when we're away so we'll be away a few days in Florida and I was going down to see sister Andy and she's up here now so but we're excited about being able to get away a few days after today leaving in the morning amen we're going to read from Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 16. Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 16. that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit where in the Inner Man strengthened by his spirit in the Inner Man we know we have an outer man we know we have this flesh but where we need to be strengthened is in the Inner Man and we actually need to be living every day from the inner man we need to be operating from the inner man how many would like to live that way so his theme is the inner man then he says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love rooted how many wants to be rooted and grounded in love amen that's a good motive that's a good source where everything is is happening and your reactions to everything it's the Divine Capstone love of God that's what's rooted that's what that's at the roots of who you are in the inner man that you may be able to comprehend I want you to notice that word comprehend because that's that's understanding that's understanding of things that you may be able to understand with All Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height of what to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god notice verse 19 is what I've been preaching on a little bit and that the love of God Divine love that which is within us will pass knowledge in other words you can't let your thoughts interrupt what the love of God wants to do how many remember that from last Sunday I think I preached on when When Love is motivating you and it begins to move in your heart and it's divine love go with it what interrupts it our own thinking this proves that by scripture when he says to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge the love of God can go Way Beyond what your mind can do it's more powerful than your mind can you say Amen it passes all knowledge we're so uh bent in this generation to use our minds and all these other things and and God gave us a mind but you see when it interrupts the love of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit that's when we're in trouble so this love passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God how many you want to be filled with the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or here we are again think this love can go beyond what you could even think about doing okay that's why we need to liver that you'll be able to unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh where it's working in US amen father bless your word and we pray you anointed Lord that I could say the things in the spirit of Christ and the motive of Christ that Lord something could be done of Eternal benefit today that you would put a Revive on our heart if someone needs salvation today I pray you'll lead him to Salvation if someone needs the holy spirit in their life today I pray that you would lead them to that Holy Ghost experience God you we we know that Jesus you said you must to Nicodemus you must be born again May every person know they must be born again to see and understand the kingdom of God bring an atmosphere for New Birth today and I pray you also teach the saints of God who've been traveling and sojourning in this faith for many years teach us as well how to live a more Victor serious life and will commit it to you father in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated there are some key elements um that I want you to grab in your hearts now out of this text and also quickly a couple others and I'll just pull them out here as we read through them the theme out of the four or five verses that I read is that we live from the inner man the inner man be strengthened so you have the inner man you had your life rooted and grounded in love and may we may be able to comprehend which is understanding you have the theme of understanding and then we have the love of Christ that passes knowledge and can do above whatever we ask or think so there are some elements key elements in that scripture that I'm going to pull out in some other scriptures and I want to speak as a theme this morning this is my subject Divine love seeks out truth and understanding Divine love seeks truth and understanding I want to delve into that and speak about it because a lot of times our mind and we're thinking only with our minds without the love of Christ without the Holy Ghost our minds will come to a certain place there because they're limited that they will stop at certain points and it'll only goes so far but Divine love is always seeking for more truth and seeking for a greater understanding of every situation first of all it seeks a greater understanding of God if you're understanding in Revelation of God is limited then that's going to eventually bring trouble so we should always be saying Lord increase my Revelation and understanding of you I want to understand God how many rub shoulders with people that they're living the way they're living today because they don't understand God I mentioned Wednesday night somebody who I was just sharing a little bit with and mostly listening to in the Valvoline Instant Oil he was an atheist he grew up Baptist in the South he was an atheist and he just unloaded on me in the only 10 minutes I was there he unloaded his life bitter had a satanic sign on his thing is attacked on his hand as a tattoo he was just very just wanting to prove to his parents and the whole world very bitter about his conservative upbringing and some of it was in balance and I could hear that and he shared his heart shared his heart and it was going on and on but I wanted to listen to him because I wanted to make sure because I had a moment where I said now now Paul you've been preaching on this Divine love you've been been preaching on let it let it rule situations and I could have jumped in and given a bunch of scriptures because I know them and corrected this guy and jumped in and told him you need to do this and you need to do that I could have done it and I would have been right scripturally but yet I didn't have a full understanding of where he was coming yet from and so my Divine love I said okay this is that moment you better live What You Preach so I settled back and I just listened to this guy and I and I've said the words because when he got into that he was a sexually abused as a young boy and the church didn't deal with it number one they didn't deal with his uncles doing it they covered it up they wanted everybody to look holy to everybody and they wanted him to look holy and so that was the emphasis they didn't care about dealing with and so I said I just said the word you know what I understand where you're at that was pitiful I said it's too bad that the church the church sometimes taints your vision of God because God is something separate than what you've seen in the church and that's all I said it's basically all I said because the rest of the time he was unloading I don't know why he was unloading on me I didn't tell him this was a church vehicle so maybe you thought it's a church I'm going to give it to this pastor but you know what I listened to the young man I listened to him and I'm I said I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for you and I'm gonna and I'm gonna continue to pray for this man I have to go in there every month for my oil change or every three months I hope I can talk to him again and give a little bit more but here it is divine love seeks the truth and seeks to understand but our minds jump quickly to conclusions but the love of God says step back a bit here and hear this person's heart and where they're coming from so that's my theme but I want to quickly if you would I want to get over these scriptures because I won't get to them turn with me if you would to First Corinthians 10. and you'll see the same themes in here first Corinthians 10. just a little study at the beginning I want you to catch and then we'll get into preaching a little bit First Corinthians 10 verse 1 says I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you uh you know what I did I've got uh I think it's second Corinthians 10. all right am I there is is it first Corinthians 10 or second I don't know somebody tell me no it's not it's first it's first Corinthians 10 . don't you all those all you old people laugh when I have a senior moment First Corinthians 10 1 moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all of our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses the prophet in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual drink and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ now can anybody hear some of our history in the last days in the first four verses they have a cloud they have a prophet can you say Amen they all eat they all seem the same Miracles under the prophet they had a journey to come out of Egypt the message called them out of Egypt they got all the they got the cloud in the sky they got the pillar of fire at night they drank from the spiritual rock that was Rock was Christ they all enjoyed and this is this is our history now this is a a shadow of what took place today as God takes us through the last days Ministry out of Egypt can you say Amen so this is a shadow of our our history of the reality of what we have we have a prophet that Prophet went to the mountain he brought the word from the mountain how many believe that so this is us this is us look at the history here now verse 5 but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness these things were examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they lusted neither be idolaters as were some of them as it was written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed as servants neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroy this is I didn't want this to be a part of our history but I can tell you the same people that Wonder Prophet had these characteristics as well idolaters yes not the world not out the systems The People Under The Prophet to people under the cloud idolaters murmurs complaining tempting the Lord you know how they tempt the Lord they said is the Lord even among us or not that's tempting the Lord now all these things happen unto them for examples and they were unto us for examples and they were written for our admonition our rebuke upon whom the ends of the world are come so we see the history we see it it types us we see all those has happened but notice verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall so now we have the same theme taking place here is the problem was the problem was not the profit the problem wasn't the pillar of fire the prophet wasn't God doing Supernatural things the problem was in their thinking and so if you're going to take their example then it's going to go back to our thing let him a man thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall if you get lifted up in yourself and says you know I don't need this I don't need to respect this I'm better than this it was their thinking and trying to work out is God Among Us or not why does God give us all this to eat and then now we're thirsty I want to go back to Egypt it was childishness and what the childishness was is they were using their own thinking to process the message they still after 40 years were using too much of their own thinking to process God and you can't use your mind to try to process God you won't figure it out you're going to be confused you can't let your mind abort the knowledge and what God's trying to do the knowledge of God you can't let the Mind interrupt that and so after all these examples don't be idolatrous you don't think we have idolatry in our own ranks we have idolatry yeah okay that's another message in itself but we do you don't think we have murmuring and complaining you don't think we have people committing a fornication well I don't live in fornication I don't even fornication is a young person living with another with a girl with a mate without being married to you we don't believe in that the Bible forbids it's against fornication if they're living with a man or a woman out of wedlock they're living in sin they're living in fornication how many still believe that it's your Bible can you say man but these had a fornication and it isn't always just physical fornication but they committed it sometimes it's spiritual fornication sometimes it's idolatry sometimes it's a different type of idolatry we have all this but where is the problem if you're going to take an example the problem is let a man take heed in his thinking when he thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall and they all fell in the wilderness even though they were under a prophet because what they didn't have an understanding and this is the the scripture that was used in a sermon and I'm not going to encourage you to listen to it because there's a sermon that's preached God being misunderstood God being misunderstood and he takes a text from Hebrews that says because they didn't understand God in the wilderness that's why we have these attributes they thought they understood but they didn't they let their own think you get in the way quickly turn with me to Psalms 106 7. Psalms 106. and verse 7. our fathers David talking about our history the history of the Jews our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea you can read the rest of yourself but that's the scripture used as a text God being misunderstood because they misunderstood God and didn't understand the Wonders and didn't understand what God was doing this is how they got into all this trouble quick with me go with back with me to the New Testament to Colossians chapter 2 if you would and as I said I'm just laying these in as a foundation and then we can move on but I want you to catch the themes they didn't understand Colossians chapter 2 and verse 1 says for I would that that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea how many knows we live uh in the the age of laodicea so this reference we ought to have our ears perked because it's not just to them but it's to that that church of laodicea but it's to the age of laodicea he said the the great conflict I have for you and for them that laodicea for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all Riches of the full Assurance of what understanding the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and the father and our Christ and that is the is the uh is a more intimate understanding of the mystery of God all of us need a more intimate understanding of the mystery of God and that's when you have your hearts knitted in love in whom are all hid the treasures of wisdom uh and knowledge and they will just leave it there but here's the same thing understanding here's the same thing love knitted together in love understanding growing Divine love seeks truth and seeks understanding that's what we're growing in in this Divine love our hearts being knit together oh how we love have a greater knit together knit together by what by Divine love not separating from one another but our hearts knit together by love you'll never get everybody together in their minds there's too many opinions and and mine are probably just as bad as yours but if we can lay opinions aside and lay our thinking aside and our complexes and our reading into things and say let Divine love knit our hearts together let this Supernatural thing happen Among Us but it comes by understanding one another and God deeper and if you won't take the time to understand somebody you're going to remain trapped in what you think of them Divine love will seek truth and seek understanding so all of these all of these are a theme of understanding love and they go together so with that scriptural basis now I'm presenting to you that Divine love when it's moving in you will always seek out the truth and true understanding it will always keep seeking more truth and understanding whether it's of God or whether it's of the other person and as the truth comes out and as more understanding comes out because you know I mentioned it a few weeks ago I can't remember how I said it but there's so many factors to something that happens and uh so a lot of people don't wait for the true facts to come in they just their mind concludes bang that's it that's what happened and then they categorize that person put them in a certain place you know they must be serpent seed we don't have a right to do that he must be this way he must be that way and we conclude lacking information lacking understanding of it can you say amen and and so there's a lot of factors to something that takes place in your life and uh you know something something happens sometimes when people 30 40 years later in a family usually it's in family situations and something happened way back then and there was a disturbance and there was a disagreement and and so everybody Drew their lines in the sand everybody dug their heels in and I've talked to family members and say I've even talked to that person in 30 years since that incident I haven't talked to them in 30 years and not every situation is this way but some situations are is that somehow something happens where the more truth comes out and more understanding and they talk they're at a birthday party and they just talk and the other person says well I did this because of this and I was it and all of a sudden the other person goes I didn't know that I didn't know that's why you did that and now more after 30 years there's an understanding of what really took place and the facts we don't even go we're going to go with it when he when we don't even have all the facts in but I want to say this even when you got facts even when somebody has sinned even when you know that's the facts they did it I'm reminding you of Jesus when the Pharisees brought that woman they had facts they caught her in the ACT I'm going to say to you that the love of Christ is even greater than that it's greater than the truth there's forgiveness in it and it's greater than the facts you may stand there in your mind I got facts that's it it's truth it happened they did me wrong they sinned it's over not with the love of Christ it's never over you got the facts you got situation and then here's another thing you've got if you have all the facts you got that person's heart you don't know what their heart is because you're not a prophet maybe some of you think you are we're not Prophets God shows people in the body of Christ things I had somebody in the office this morning telling me a dream some of their dreams have come to pass this is the gifts working in the body sometimes they're the first thing I had dreams last night and you don't want me talking about my dreams because my crazy spaceships and all that had a stupid dream about the spaceship was waiting for us outside and I was fearful that my phone wouldn't work on it and I was in the store trying to find a bad a charger to take it with me on the trip and snacks I didn't know if they'd have any snacks and I was in the store in the dream grabbing up all the snacks but while I was going to say my wife got on the ship and the ship took off without me I missed the Rapture because of snacks that's kind of stupid dreams I have sometimes sometimes I'm not a dreamer so I don't have spiritual dreams a lot but I'm always sensitive to the body of Christ there's a sister in the church that had a few dreams a few months ago and three or four of those things have come to pass I'm just watching for the last one you don't think the spirit's moving within our body oh yeah because that's what it was not just the pastor's Gifts of preaching but you know that that's the thing is that you you can have something happen and not know the person's heart sometimes can you say man not know where they're at not under not understand where they were coming from during that time and misread and misinterpret and misunderstand why they acted that way it's not to justify sin but we should be seeking to know the full facts and know the understanding of the person's heart this is divine love this is what divine love does because when you got a full understanding of it then you really know how to pray you really know how to act you really know how to respond correctly instead of your mind figuring all out and you're concluding is that okay with everybody amen so uh so our hearts are to be rooted in in this love and our inner manners to be strengthened and we must be operating from the inward man and there is a quote that I want to read later if I get to it is that he says it never gives he says when we think with our own carnal mind like Cain did because Cain he hadn't figured out his worship was right he was bringing fruits and he he was about himself More Than This lamb a revelation that was provided for him and so he's elaborating on this subject the the prophet he's elaborating on it and all of a sudden he brings out and he shows that not only did he settle in his mind this is the way it is but he concluded I don't need Abel anymore and so I'm going to get rid of Abel this is how this is where our minds can take us denominational systems do this all the time denominational Spirits with on our ranks do this all the time you think carnally and then it says I don't need that other group I'm better than this other group I they categorize they they're in a certain group certain group and you put them in a category and now you can't fellowship with them now you now you shut them that's not Divine love when is the church going to be led by Divine love and our and not our own thinking in our own mind when are we going to be led by the spirit and love for the love of God because there's the power in there it dissolves all denominational differences it's greater than our opinions so so we we we see then there's so much in me from yesterday's studying that I'm I'm rushing ahead in my mind trying to get it all out here out of my heart so so now we see he says that he says Cain he said then he wants to say I don't need Abel he actually kills Abel I don't need this man in my life and guess what he did need Abel in his life because Abel was the man pointing to the right sacrifice and if he had a revelation like Abel he would have known that it wasn't about him it wasn't about Abel it was about both of us have one sacrifice Jesus Christ and if we would all focus on that one need everybody has a need for that sacrifice Christ and if we get our eyes on one thing and focus all that we all need the Lamb of God don't try to think it any further don't put a category on somebody else say and Cain should have said I I don't like what's happening here but Abel is pointing me to the right sacrifice and Abel needs it but I need the same sacrifice it's my substitute it's not about me saving myself it's not about bringing my own fruits bringing my own good works that I've done to God no he doesn't want those good works we have one substitute for our sin all of us need it it's Calvary it's our lamb and if we would have that one Focus for everybody we would quit worrying about who's better than the next person or murdering he murdered Abel he murdered him because his denominational spirit and his mind figured out that if I can just remove Abel I'll be okay if I can just remove this preacher out of my life be careful be careful because he may have humanness he may you may not like some of the things he does but what's he pointing you to what's he pointing you to and hopefully if it's a menace to gospel he's pointing you to the lamb I have a substitute you have a substitute and there is no big eyes or little use and I'm better my mind's better we dress better we dress less or poor or rich or more talented it all just dissolves we all need one thing the most talented musicians needs the same lamb and without it he's lost the poorest person in the church needs the same lamb the rich person the richest person in the church which isn't me and we don't have a lot of picture it might be you but guess what your riches will do you nothing you need the same lamb that I do you need a substitute for your sin and he says in that he says Cain did that and he says that's the way we function in a denominational spirit and he says it never is what I want you to catch it never gives the inward man a chance to operate it blocks the inward man and we're supposed to be living from the inward man Christ every day every hour everything perfect Faith Masters every circumstance this interrupted every time never gives it when I read that years ago I love that quote I love how he says it I said I don't want to be Cain I want to have the mindset of Cain and but I want to operate from the inward man and I don't want my mind to interrupt that I got a soul here I got the love of God in my soul I want to be functioning and operating from the inward man my Divine love isn't it time haven't we been through so much history like Israel's here's history how many years in this message haven't we been through so much haven't we seen so much in groups rising up and we got more resolution than you and we got more gifts than you and aren't we tired of all this if the inward man was operating you never get that result out of it isn't it I'm asking this church isn't it time that we're operating from Divine love isn't it time that our denominational differences end isn't it time that we quit lifting up big preachers and making little ones more little and isn't it time to grow out of all this childishness isn't this the final end operating from the inward man every individual operating including preachers operating from the inward man I can tell you everything possible everything is possible when coming from that inward man all things are possible but most the time I wonder if we're not giving him a chance to operate we're all Christians this morning we all love God we're lovely people you're all lovely people I love you all of you I hope you love me I believe you do but I wonder how many decisions every day and actions are made in our life from another source than your inward mind that's what Thrills me about the grace of God today I'm thrilled about the grace of God because we have his favor to receive preaching like this we are favored of God to hear what God wants to give us through the ministry and through what we read in our Bibles and study the word we are favored because he's going to give us instruction and he's going to lead us if we'll yield into a life of let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus and that we're LED from the inward man his grace is going to lead us there if we'll submit submissions got such a bad word to it a bad connotation today it's a Biblical word no matter how many decisions so it Thrills me of the Grace today we are we have his favor and listen to this despite this overwhelming influence of our flesh the overwhelming influence of our minds the overwhelming influence of our past our fears our abuse from other people are people that have targeted us our mistakes our sins our weaknesses our inbred family sins and strains in our family our pride and if you are eliminating you from any of these I'm reading you've got too much pride all of us have this say Amen or ouch or something inbred weaknesses from family inbred strains and family pride of family Pride a religious Pride our fleshly atmosphere we live in our laodicean age of laziness spiritually our dirty sex appeal-driven world it's a dirty sexual uh perverted world can you say man our material and money driven America that everything's about the Mighty Dollar you take all that and God's grace still comes down to us and said but I want you to live from the Imran I'm calling to you to something higher it's not your possessions it's not your businesses it's not how somebody has done you wrong that's all lesser things let's let loose of lesser things let's let it go and get to living from Divine love no wonder if it's difficult to give the internet a chance to operate no wonder in the age we live in and yet his grace still leads us and Longs for us to be operating from the inward man instead of anything else we will come to perfection in this age by the grace of God and that along he shall bring forth The Headstone with cryings Grace Grace unto it the Capstone will come down to his people crying with Grace Grace unto it somebody say praise the Lord because when I look at it it's too impossible but his grace is going to do it let us not justify ourselves and expect to stay fleshly driven in our lives I'm a Christian brother Paul I'm a Christian I I believe that you are but are you spirit-led and divine Love Led or is everything coming through the filter of your mind and actually blocks when the spirit's leaving leading you to do something deeper when I say Divine love seeks truth and understanding it's pretty simple to know what I'm talking about because the other way of life Divine love not seeking the truth understanding our minds do not seek the truth and do not seek greater understanding what happens then what happens when we don't speak deeper understanding of something oh my God do you got an extra three hours today to talk about what's happening in you and in me when we're not letting the Divine love get a greater understanding of God and one another what can happen oh my a lot of things can happen if we doubt that we have complete truth or understanding of something if we have that we draw premature conclusions if we don't have a full understanding we misjudge matters when we don't have a full understanding we misjudge one another when we don't have a full understanding we walk with a lack of understanding of anything when we do that we will hold it like there's truth in our like like there's like their truths in our minds that their final truth and I've been preaching uh to you was Wednesday night if you want to listen to it again just the power of our imagination getting in the way our imagination is so powerful that it creates these thoughts and brings these and it develops it and develops it and then we don't have an understanding of situation and we hold truths in our minds and we've made them truths and reality in our minds and come to find out it may not be full truth it may not be with the full understanding but look at Wednesday night stinking thinking and coming at us thinking thinking we all have a bit of it and and our imagination look at that example that the prophet gave that he says now you can think in your mind that brother hates me he said it's not true but you thought it and if you keep thinking about it your imagination goes to work goes to work and it builds and it builds and it's built that brother doesn't hate you at all in that situation there might be brothers that hate you but don't you ever let your mind conclude that unless you know that it's true and then what do I do with that he hates me he hates me he hates me well there's only one answer and still the Divine love of God I love you if you hate me if you spit in my face I love you as a brother I'll wipe my face off and I'm gonna love you anyway because love is the most powerful force in the world but our imagination gets a lot of people in our lives that we think hate us or our turning targeting us I'm not supposed to get political here but I'm just watching these the squad I guess the squad the four women they're and they're in Congress they get mad because one of them gets kicked out of a committee because she made anti-jew comments against the Jews she never apologized for him she can't really sit on a foreign committee when she's making statements like that so they took her off and all these women are just blasting and and you know we're being targeted because we're women of color and we're this and the LGBT and all they go into all this stuff in their mind and guess what everything everything gets ruled through their filter everything is concluded racism I'm being targeted everything gets I don't mean to use them for example but I'm saying that's how powerful the mind gets not truth not a not everything is a racist problem we do have a racist problem but not everything is that not everything is a targeting of you uh Mrs whatever her name is AOC not everything comes to just that same Concrete in her mind this is targeting women of color it's not true but it always gets comes through there amen how many conclusions have we made about God and others that did not have the full truth to them how many years ago did it happen and there are stories like I said that go on for years and then all of a sudden there's an understanding and there's been walls up for years been hatred for years and then somehow it gets talked about and ends up that the whole thing was a complete misunderstanding no one took the time to be adults and sit down and seek the full story conclude about things there's something about our thing that wants to bring a final judgment on stuff and really only God has the final say God has the final judgment on matters we should be able to judge matters Paul said that to the Corinthians you shouldn't be going to law with one another you should be judge matters amongst yourself in other words he's saying you should have the maturity to work it out the judge matters it's settled it's done we're going on with the Lord but no nobody wants to sit down and be adults about it and our mind wants to judge it wants to conclude and it wants to put people in a category I don't know why our minds think this way and do this but it doesn't Divine love does it but our minds do it and I don't know why if anybody knows why please come and tell me our mind wants to judge final judgment he wants to put everybody in a category it wants to conclude it wants to push people out it wants to say I can't I don't want to fellowship with that person anymore uh it's happy to conclude without full understanding I'm good with the walls that are up I'm good with years of holding a grudge I don't know why we're bent that way but we are our thinking without the love of God lists itself to a status of God itself our minds are the facts the law our minds bring the facts our minds are the lawyer our minds are the jury and our minds are the judge and our minds are the sentence we got a whole Court in our imagination in our mind and we did it all we didn't need any input at all am I telling the truth here a little bit of the truth here this morning you know I'm not preaching about some uh reprobate in mind I'm talking about your mind because you have the same mind as them it's just you're yielding it to the Lord but it can interrupt it can judge it can sentence it can bring a final judgment on something and our minds are too limited and and not infinite they're finite and they're they're not infinite like gauze and it's quite often because God knows all things he's the infinite God he knows every hair of your head of everybody's head you don't understand infinite like that he knows everything he knew it from the beginning your mind don't know that it's quite often that our minds becomes the whole justice system and it becomes like the justice system in our world that is not very balanced and doesn't get to the full truth sometimes our thinking becomes a filter besides events that never get a full understanding it filters all future events through that filter did you hear what I said our thinking becomes a filter besides events that never get a full understanding it filters all future events through that filter to where there's no trust but I'm preaching to you the love of God and the love of God is not that way and it seeks truth and it seats understanding of one another can you say man this is a presence that seeks out and is mature enough to fully understand before it makes a judgment call and then it's a power to wash all sin away and wash it away to forgive and not just forgive to be reconciled because how many know if you've studied it there's a difference in forgiveness and Reconciliation you can forgive somebody but not be reconciled you say well how can I reconcile somebody who doesn't reconcile that's not your fault that's their fault but Divine love is not only seeking forgiveness and repentance it's seeking reconciliation I must bring that if I can do everything to bring that together to understand to forgive and bring the fellowship that Satan doesn't get in between us I must bring it together as best I can in the face shut it down then I've done my part to express the love of God but we should not stop at forgiveness my relationship with the Lord did not stop when he forgave me I have been reconciled in Fellowship back to my god there are no walls between us there is no guilt if I sit and make a mistake I bring it quickly under the blood and I'm right back in Fellowship again I don't just have a forgiveness God's forgive me thank God and there's a lot of people that are in denominations they've been forgiven 30 years ago at the altar but they're living a life of sin you haven't been reconciled back to God you've been forgiven you've been forgiven but when you repent and this is the three basis for relationship true repentance true forgiveness and true reconciliation I knew it would be a little bit more teaching this morning forgive and not just forgive but to be reconciled and when you reconciled not one trace of ill feeling towards that person if some of you feel like that I'm preaching way up here Out Of Reach for you well guess what I feel the same way but it's not Out Of Reach if he said it in the Bible what everything is reachable by the grace of God but I feel that way too and I'm delivering my heart today because I'm headed on vacation tomorrow and I'm laying it all on the table I hope you pick up what I'm laying down praise the Lord so you know I wonder if that's how many Church splits take place I wonder how many Church splits took place for people leaving were based upon an unresolved misunderstanding and they find out years later and they're not adult enough to sit down and work it out clear it all out clear it and then we both move on pray about what the will of God is but there's no clearing up of it there's no the mind even stops you from doing the brotherly thing it exalted itself and the mind even says no I'm not going to go talk to that person no I'm not going to go try to resolve this I'm not going to do it your mind says that because we're afraid of Confrontation they're not they're not going to listen anyway it's all here this isn't down here it's all here it's not worth it I don't like confrontation I just I'm an easy going fella you know just let everything just happen and there's only thing one thing I can see in the scriptures sometimes that would make us be silent and that's when Jesus was falsely accused and he opened not his mouth but most other things and sometimes even that you're seeking understanding and you're seeking reconciliation this is what the love of God does but there's not enough adulthood sometimes to sit down work it out clear it out move on the Mind stops you from doing just the brotherly love thing which I can give you several scriptures someone has ought against you someone has overtaken in a fault ye with your spiritual goal restores such a one in the spirit of meekness considering yourself lest you fall also I don't see this happening a lot we're too scared to do it our mind interrupted our mind aborts it I imagine says hey let's leave it alone not always we shouldn't always leave it alone the scripture encourages us to try to resolve scripture says go to another one go to another one the mind is locked its exalts itself said I don't really need them anyway in my life or I tried I tried to do it I text them and said hello and they never reconciled with me you text them and said hello that was an effort to reconcile that's it they're done you know I tried you did no spending time to really resolve it this is something to advise to all of our Lives brothers and sisters all of our Lives there's so many examples now that I could give you in my life so that I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching it myself of misunderstandings and a lack of understanding for the heart and red things the wrong way because of not fully understanding and lack of this can damage the family parents must make adjustments all the time to the different ages of their children if you approach a teenager like a five-year-old and you keep doing that and you don't have an understanding of what age they're at now you're going to damage your family if you're getting the belt out every time can I say that publicly like that still in the word state law in Ohio still you can discipline your children I don't know about Michigan I haven't checked that one yet I'm sure Gabrielle will be checking it out see what rights I have as a daddy I'm just teasing on me when you have a lack of understanding and I'm only bringing one or two examples here because we could go on all day about this this is I just want to tell you this is in our lives okay if you don't let the love of God seek understanding then it's it's stopped short of a full victory uh I've watched mothers and fathers hover over you know 20 year old kids and 30 year old kids and it becomes unhealthy because they're still given input as if they were 10 or 12 years old and they're still because they're they're not understanding things have changed and so instead of speaking about you I speak about me I I've had that to make those adjustments and it's been very hard on me as the kids change and things seasons change can you say amen and so how you handle it is different you know and you have to adjust yourself and sometimes back off there can be times that you're you're weighing in pretty heavy to the will of God for their life and they need to be given everybody listening when they come to certain ages especially over 20 21 years old they need to be given Liberty to find the will of God from their for their life from God himself oh but I'm the parent and I weigh in and I and wait a minute you need to give them Liberty to find what the world is and then if they feel like it's the will of God give your counsel give your input but if they say this is the will this is what I feel to do you need to support them in what God's telling you and not abort what God's telling them to do is that okay with everybody because you're not understanding the different season you're in and and I have to understand and those changes take place you have to make a judgment there are some points you don't say anything at all because you will get told you will get told sometimes that Dad you have already taught me this for all these years I know what you're doing but you don't need to say it again you've said this a hundred times I know what to do I need to go and do you know and so so but but we think they've never heard it before and they have so as I step back and say you know she's right they're right I have said this a million times I've done my work to invest and give the word of God to my children now it's time for me to back off and pray for their lives if they come and ask for my counsel which is like wow whoa that hasn't happened in a long time let's have coffee I got a few questions for whoa I'm there what time I'll be there yeah they're asking for it what's the thing that says when I was 15 years old old when I was five years old my parents knew everything when I was 15 they knew a little bit when I was 21 they didn't know anything when I was 30 I said I called Dad said what do you think about this then when I get to be 40 or 50 years old my parents knew everything it's a season of life it's what they go through as teenagers in different seasons yeah I know I'm preaching some to some teenagers here they're seeing their side because they don't think their parents know anything right now but yeah that's one thing about me is that I get people emailing me from around the world and I don't say that boastfully and I can't even get to all the emails that are asking just just for an ounce of my advice about parenting about this and about that and this situation in a church and all this stuff from around the world and some of my kids never want to know what I have to say I don't mean to put them down because they're they're respectful and they do want to hear what I want to say but and I've said that to them I got people emailing me now asking all these things just want to know and you know sometimes I got people here even among us that they don't value it like that that's fine that's fine but you see now it's an understanding and I won't go back up there and look at it but you remember something that happened with um brother branham's daughter 18 years old she hit 18 and there was quite a quite some actions going on that hadn't happened quite before I get to that let me let me talk about something here he mentions this word understanding of things and I could take this a million different directions but I want to give these examples because I think they're where really where the rubber meets the road sometimes he mentions about understanding a husband understanding a wife a wife understanding sit down and try to understand them and children sit down and try to understand this 18 year old and let's think 18 year old thoughts you adjust yourself I'm going to think 18 year old thoughts now and you know what that is that's that's really the love of God saying I'm not going to think about it the way I thought about it before no compromising now but but there's no understanding of where you're at right now and you have to understand that person where they're coming from do they have a sickness going on do they have something emotionally going on and you blast them and you don't know that's taken place you got to get an understanding yeah none of it justify and sin because that's the guilt we always get we're justifying the sin in their life and what they're doing that's not it I'm talking about an understanding so you can make you know how to pray and you have a good judgment call of things that are going on okay and and so now this is applied to children and parents um mothers hovering over holding their children back uh you know it's just unhealthy in leadership he speaks that you know and the cycles of our life you know we send our kids to school and the teacher gets to train him and the mother has the child first and mentors them and does everything she can and then she has to back off because now the teacher's giving them things and then he said then they get to certain age and they've got to take over the father's business said then the mother backs off and now the daddy takes over to give leadership those are all Cycles if you got where that's not normally naturally health healthy happening you're going to have a 30 year old in the home and mom's still being treating them like a 10 year old completely unhealthy you're not understanding what's going on in the next cycle I want to talk about menopause a little bit it is a quote here foreign Branham he has a question I don't know if you guys have this one I think you do back there you have the quotes first quote for the ram I love the Lord but for the past year I have been faced with a problem seems sometimes I've always been out of my I've I've almost been out of my mind what is it please pray for me eat this and my husband when I read that last I had just laughed and laughed and left because he don't have the mental things going on but he's there and something's going because she's asking prayer for me but my husband also it says so much well if if this person was going on a private interview with me like the people being in there this morning it would pull that out what it is whatever it is you see because he's a prophet next quote the Lord would reveal what it is but now that I don't know who you are and you're not sitting here it is just a sister in Christ now now if there's something that you have done that's wrong that's bothered you so he's just breaking it down now then check it with the Bible and see what you must do but if you haven't done anything and you're not condemned of anything it's perhaps your nerves you see so now I'm just I'm teaching us here now as a pastor that different situations can be different and you can quickly in your mind say well they've like the woman they've got an evil spirit on them you know they got a demon Spirit controlling them you may not know that and you you've labeled a nervousness a demon spirit and and so it could be many things that happen maybe some trouble back in your life it's a woman here might be in the menopause time he's not saying she is but it might be and listen now that's when everything is wrong with her and there's nothing wrong with her yet everything's wrong with her and that's why the husband needs prayer too that's why she said pray for my husband too because he doesn't understand this he doesn't understand what she's going through everything has changed there's something back in the library there Sister Margaret can get it for you but he actually sister Rebecca wrote about this because when she hit 18 and her mom started to hit impulse menopause and she's hitting and they they begin to clash the two of them in the home because both of them are hitting a change of life at the same time and there was this this going on between them and they didn't understand what's going on what changed and he sat him down you can read it in article sat him down she remembers brother but I'm sending them down and explaining to us they understand this is what's going on and when he when they understood it they could be more tolerant to one another and understanding one another this isn't a devil this is a this is a conflict our bodies are changing so that's when everything's wrong with her there's and there's nothing wrong with her yet everything's wrong with her and she's not just putting on she really feels that it's just as real any person that's nervous is that way and don't never disagree I'm not you know I'm not making fun of this because this is real I mean we have several sisters going through this in the assembly okay and there needs to be a care there needs to be an understanding especially from the husbands you can try to approach it when you were first married all you want to and that ain't going to work well I want it like it was when we were first married I want to well grow up if you understand this part better then maybe you'll come into a different season of feeling like it was when you're first married but you got to discipline yourself to understand this season this is real brother Brahm says this and this is just not putting on she feels that it's just as real any person you can have all the answers you want to say you know get yourself together and this is ridiculous you know you're only damaging it more any person that's nervous that way and don't never disagree is there more quote to it and you husbands to your wives when they're in that time of life if you ever did any of you husbands or men think that you're going to be preached on this morning like this you never came thinking that but that's that's what it is that's my Ministry I guess and you husbands your wives when they're in that time of life if you she ever was your sweetheart you let her be right then because she needs you she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her there's the word understanding don't try to figure it out in your mind let the Divine love try to understand her is that okay with everybody it's using an example of a different season that you hit and there needs to be the love of Christ and the understanding of things there's some things that might be said that maybe aren't true okay maybe aren't true and there's no sense in human being that critical because you go through a midlife too it's emotional but it's mostly just looking for the next truck you want to buy or the boat that's how it comes out in you okay that's how you vent that midlife crisis okay but she vents it a different way so if she understands you buying that boat if you got her on board with that you're doing good but if she's understanding you that there's some changes in this guy he's acting different become a little disgruntled about stuff too much or whatever but just try to understand what's going on but if she's going to do that for you Brothers then here's your cue from the prophet sit down understand her if she ever was your sweetheart you let her be right then because she needs you she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her take to her talk to her take her up in your arms like she was your sweetheart and she should be is there any more Rebecca and understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing and you must be good to her at that time I think that's why Mr Rockefeller made a fatal mistake he was loved by the nation would have probably been our next president but when his wife took menopause and went in menopause he left her and married his secretary and you see what happened that shows there's some real good thinking Americans yet why because they didn't based on what he did to his wife they didn't put him in as president so some still some good thinking Americans I'm wondering about the thinking Americans now who we have in but I'm not supposed to be political I don't think we have too many thinking Americans left but they were right don't put that man in he's got that in his life he puts his wife and goes had an affair with another woman because he can't understand what she's going through that's not love this is not in the slides sister Rebecca this is this is when he was talking about Rebecca his daughter so a few days after her mother got after her for something she sassed her now that's not Rebecca at all took off slammed the door she's 18 years old almost knocked the things off the wall went to school and I uh brother but I'm saying I ought to have seemingly just taken my belt off and followed her out in the yard and brought her back with warps around her I'm just I like to hear the quietness see but I thought wait a minute I've got to think 18 year old thoughts you see I said mother I know she started crying meaty my wife I said I know you've done all you can do I've done all I can do now if it's out of our hands we have to take the next step as some lady sweetly wrote the other day it was one of the questions here it said brother Branham you're not the Messiah are you I said no ma'am she said we believe you to be our Shepherd but you're always pointing us to the great Shepherd I said that's right that's right I said well look honey now you've done he's saying to his wife now honey you've got to listen to me it's hard for you to do this I'm your husband but people drive across the nation and around the world just for a few words of advice from me now I talked to her the other day and she just walked away from me his wife said I tried to talk to Becca the other day she just walked away from me um now Becky never did do that to me and when her mother said something about it she slammed the door and said you expect me to sit here and be in a Wallflower all my life because they were concerned about her going over to the friend's house playing the wrong kind of music on the piano boogie woogie music and brother Brown says I don't want you going over there anymore and she got real mad about it and then she just slams the door and says you just expect me to sit here and be a Wallflower all my life and blaming she slammed the door and went out that was the devil it's the devil it's the devil on you when you act that way parents it's the devil but there's no instruction here to go and say you demon-possessed woman he's adjusted himself to the time of life and divine love if it's ministered with understanding and trying to find truth will destroy demon power but it needs to have understanding with it don't compromise but it's there's the administration of it she slammed the door she said and so that was the devil I remember the first two years of her life she cried we go into a restaurant and eat I walk her in the street she was a baby and then she'd walk out just cried and cried all the time Rebecca and one day everybody in Canada cried all night I couldn't rest and everything staying there and something said to me it's the devil getting at your ministry I said hand me that baby and I said Satan in the name of Jesus Christ you take your hands off of her and she stopped right then and never cried no more she's the quietest kid I've got from that very hour it was gone you say so you have to have that in you though before you can do it and when she started that and back doing this and I took media about an hour he just took an hour with his wife just to talk about this I said midi take your hands off of it she goes me that's my kid I said it it's mine too all right I said if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to God for her Eternal destination why can't we commit her to God now for our Earthly Journey and she said well that's my kid I said it's mine too now see me not say nothing to her and media's going and I'm trying to interpret this here media is saying me not saying nothing to her and I said I never said that will quit scolding her and just advise her she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and I we're her parents these kids today need a buddy if they had a mother and father would stay home and take care of them instead of out here in the bar room running around all night things like that we wouldn't have the juvenile delinquency somebody needs to love them somebody needs to be with him parenting takes a lot of love and time with them that's why the best case scenario is though the wife to be home with her husband not every time that can happen because of finances but if it can happen I love the young men that come up here and says I'm trying to get a trade or a degree because I want my my wife to be home with my children when I get married I say God bless you young men whoever's made that resolve because this is a very expensive world to live in in most situations the wife has to work but all the user are thinking that I just like the little extra money and the young kids at home you better pray about that you have to you have to do it sometimes but here he's saying if the mothers and fathers would stay home and take care of their children and give them love they got away from the Bible they went to church and they got Bunko games and everything else trying to polish up and make it Satan's grounds so so then he says we got uh let me just skip there I forgot to edit these so there we there we got down on our knees and committed her to God I said I know she's 18 years old she will be in a few days and a girl at age will think about boyfriends and we've kept her in I never wanted to see her married I wanted to put her in the office and do work I wanted to see her filled with the spirit and live like that just put her in the office keep the guys away from her every father thinks that well we we all wanted that she said well we can't do that she just won't listen to it I said wait a minute we've raised her all we can now put her in the hands of God commit her and hands of God and I said then when she does anything say Becky darling mother don't want you to do that but I'm your pal I'll stick by you see let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her she's going to get somebody to understand her she's going to find some friend that they listen to me some stranger that they'll bear their heart to should never happen sometimes it's because they don't have an openness from a parent they hear them out there's no relationship there's no connection of a heart I said it years ago I made preach I may preach the word whatever I do but the greatest thing that I want in this life is a relationship with my God and know the hearts of my children my wife we may not agree but I know their hearts and they know my heart and we're connected that's my goal she's going to get somebody to love her and I'm going to I have a lot here but I'm going to close on this because I think this is a good place to wrap it up she's going to get somebody to love her and it might be the wrong woman that loves her I said you be the woman that does a loving I said honey that sounds kind of crude but people come everywhere in set in personal interviews and things I said I'm so common as a dad I become common to her we're common to one another because we're husband and wife but we we will but we never let that happen you must remember this is in the name of the Lord so she said all right we got down we committed to God said we take our hands off it and the rest of the story is when they handled her that way she didn't go over to the other girl's house anymore she made the choice Mom and Mom and Dad prayed for me and I was being real bad I was being she's telling another friend this I was being wild I was being real bad mom and dad said they love me if you want to go over there you go but we disagree with you going whatever you want to do and she stopped going understanding understanding love Divine love brings a seeking of Truth and is seeking of understanding amen I've preached on the Joshua commission I'm closing now I preached on the Joshua commission and that was the transition that happened in that whole 40 years in the wilderness under a prophet under the cloud we read in the scripture and then all that generation passed and they couldn't go into the promised land but to Joshua and Caleb were commissioned to take the people into their land this has spiritually happened in the message okay and that is that there's a job there's a Moses Commission but then Joshua chapter 1 says Moses my servant is dead and the next verse Joshua take up and take the people into the promised land we've seen that transition and what that was is that now they wouldn't be little babies in the wilderness and waiting for Moses to do something may it Moses to do another miracle we need another miracle they grew up into an adoption in their Ephesians to say you can't wait around for God to do a miracle you got to take up your sword and go take the enemies the land back from the enemy that is yours now every individual under this Joshua commission should take the word that's being preached to them and the word that you're right and stand up against him and say I'm taking all of my land that's what we're in right now and and for 35 years I read this the other day I don't know if you ever caught it 35 years they fought together all the tribes together against the enemy for 35 years under Joshua and then he starts getting old he said there's more land to possess they took then they went and took that he says describe the land they described it so everybody knew this is exactly what we need to go take to me that's the ministry today getting very practical very Down to Earth being very specific what land belongs to you as a Christian if you're under a preacher a minister like that not just Evangelistic all the time but somebody he was describing your land to you and then you leave this church and you go get it that's the type of ministry to be under he said thank God for that it's specific it's practical it's it's in your face sometimes see that's why I'm down here right in your face but it's the Joshua commission 35 years they fought with one another against the enemy and then there were two and a half tribes that had agreed with Joshua when they first come over can we make an agreement when we fight for you and get all your land we want to come back across Jordan we'd rather stay here and Joshua agreed to it when we're done fighting when we're almost done fighting you can go back well it come to the place they took the land and so now they two and a half tries it's time for us to go back well they headed back and this is after 35 years of fighting with one another against the enemy they come to the Jordan where they had crossed and they said we're going to build an altar here okay so they start building up an altar and back however many miles away the rest of the children of tribes here they're building an altar that was a sin that was wrong to build an altar other than the one that would be among them they're building another thing and and so now when they hear they're building an altar they they start to take up their swords and they're going to go down to Jordan and kill their brothers for this altar they're building and they're headed down there and the brothers that are two and a half tribes saying send back word to them if if we're building another altar that's the altar then we need to be killed that's not our purpose that's not our motive listen to our motive we just wanted to build a memorial so that when your children are older and our children are over they can look at this as a memorial and go back to what God did we're not building another altar to replace the the right one we're just building a memorial and those Brothers completely misunderstood their motives so much so that they're ready to take their swords for the first time in 35 years they're picking up Swords to go kill their brothers instead of the enemy all because of what they missed understood what happened in the motives now what needed to happen before they took up their weapons they needed to say what are you guys doing what's the purpose in it if they had enough respect to sit down like adults before they picked up a weapon against one another but this is the end of our Joshua commission that the last thing I just excuse me friends I don't want to prophesy I don't want to but you watch what's taken place sometimes in our own ranks and the fighting and the taking shots across the pulpit at another preacher over here and undermining each local church Bishops over so many churches at churches and you don't have a clue what that brother is being led to do over there but you mistreat misread what he's doing you lash out against the pulpit against what they're doing over there help us preachers not to do that can I get more amens I mean just this is this has got to stop this has to stop it's misunderstandings many times when is divine love going to really take over not preaching a sermon on it but we see the fruits of it taking place take shots here and shots there and it's just understanding undermines the local church because God may be doing a unique thing in a local church sometimes a unique thing takes place and they start to say oh you know this is not happening anywhere else you need to come to this church that's wrong too God can do a unique thing in that local assembly I have the authority from God to teach and preach what I preach to this assembly I don't have to be influenced by other ministers to preach what they're preaching right now if I'm off the word you have a responsibility to come and correct me if I'm off the word and if I'm living in sin you have a responsibility to bring it to the church and if I'm going to continue sin to take me out of this office I've disrespected it but the main thing is am I preaching the word and if I'm not then you have to make a decision whether to go we get another Pastor whatever can you say Amen but if I'm on the word of God the manner the approach and where we're leading the sheep for this assembly don't get on there online and compare yourself to other assemblies well I'm going to listen to this one today and I'm going to sit back and listen to this one and this it should all really be in continuity if you're listening to the right Ministries it should be the Holy Ghost saying basically the same thing but if I want to do a teaching and do something very different than another Minister would do I think we should stop categorizing and and criticizing what the local assembly is doing with a simple humble Pastor that's just leading his flock and they were ready to take up weapons because they misunderstood their brothers they shouldn't have done that but guess what the positive things is when they sent backward and said Brothers Listen we're not doing this this is our motive the brothers back there said now we understand praise the lord we go for that guess what happened you know what that is it was a victory in Divine love that's the last of Joshua the last of Joshua is a victory in Divine love amongst the brothers come on folks let's praise God if it's in the Bible it's going to happen today again there was a victory in Divine love there was a victory in Divine understanding they understood one another laid their weapons down blessed be the name of the Lord may we understand one another with may the Lord Divine love of God seek truth before we draw a conclusion seek truth seek understanding with the brothers with sisters with pastors with God everyone let that love seek understanding husbands seek understanding with your wives wives seek understanding with your husbands parents seek understanding and live by mature understanding for your children your teenagers and let there be like in This Book of John let there be a victory how many know it's been prophesied she will have a victory in Divine love she will have a victory of understanding she have a victory of mature love this is where the message is taking us not back to holding grudges for years not back to jumping from church to church and you didn't understand the full situation not back to Old Fighters and that's what brother Brown called the old men that were under Moses they were the old Fighters all they knew to do was to fight to fight to fight and we're not supposed to be fighting one another we're supposed to be fighting the enemy glory be to God God has given us the victory can you say Amen praise the Lord God will give us a victory in Divine love it's already happening in a lot of things I see maturity in people trying to seek understanding first before they make a judgment call trying to meet with somebody and being adults about it trying trying trying doing out of divine love functioning out of divine love that's my heart friends and let it take place in me first that's what my prayer is amen Oh we must fight be brave against all evil let's stand never run or even let be high if we would win for God and the right just keep on is that F sharp go up to G oh you must fight be brave against all evil never run or even lag behind the ride just [Music] oh oh you must fight you're brave again if you would win for God and the right just keep on the fire the first person oh if you're in the battle for the Lord just keep on the fire red line you in my brother surely you must fight there are many dangers that we all must face if we die fighting it is no disgrace a coward in the service he will find no place so keep on against the enemy not one another oh you must fight be brave against God will only use a soldier he can trust amen you wear a crowd and bear the parole sure but he found the fire red light amen life is about to live before the master then help too bad it's able to spread good cheer gray you'll be rewarded for your service how many want to fight the Enemy Fight be brave against all evil never run nor even like behind if you would win for God in the right just keep on firing okay [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] when they understood one another they had a victory in Divine love they could go back to fighting the enemy instead of fighting one another it speaks volumes to his friends I pray they would yield ourselves and submit ourselves to what God's trying to say to all of us including me may God may God help us to yield to it praise be to God God bless you all pray for us while we're away going to see your brother Joel Joel down there that'll be exciting to be preached for brother Danny and anybody who's in Florida come and fellowship with us I think Doug and Debbie will be there why
