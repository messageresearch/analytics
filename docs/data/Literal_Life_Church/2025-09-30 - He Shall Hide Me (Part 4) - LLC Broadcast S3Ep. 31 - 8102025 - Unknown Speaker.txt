========================================

Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] Oh, one more time. Oh, [Music] do it again. Sing it with us. Oh [Music] Lord, you know when I'm giving my all or when I'm giving. [Music] And you know when I'm trying, but my heart's not in it. I'm amazed by the grace that you have for me every day. [Music] How could I let myself give you less than my highest praise? I've seen what we've been through and how much I've been blessed by you. So I'll do my best to bring you glory. Give my all to tell your story. Praise you through the trials showing you're worth it all. Amen. Oh you have set me into my fire. Call me upon the water. You have called me to live higher. You gave your all. So I'll do my best. [Music] Oh, [Music] I will lift up my hands when the circumstance pulls me down. When the world tries to silence me, I will sing. [Music] I will turn up my praise in the face of my enemy. Amen. I will dance in my freedom even in captivity. Why? Because I've seen what we been through. and how much I've been blessed by you. So I'll do my best to bring you glory. Give my all and tell your story. Praise you through the trials. Show me you're worth it all. [Music] You have stepped into my fire. Pulled me up from the water. You have me to higher. You gave your own. So I'll do my best to bring you glory. Gave my all to tell your story. Praise you through the triumph. knowing you're worth it all. [Music] Lord, you have sent me into the fire upon the water. You have to higher. You gave your own. So I'll do my best. Oh. I'll do my best. I'll do my best. [Music] I'll do my best. Psalms 27:5. In the time of trouble, he shall hide me. In his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. How many know that a rock in the Bible is type to a revelation. So he's he's not setting us up upon uh something that's not stable, but he's setting us up upon a revelation, something that'll stand the test of time. Jesus told Peter, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church, a revelation of him, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against a revelation." This is what's solid in our lives. Can you say amen? I want to add a scripture here in the Song of Solomon if I could. Chapter 7 and verse 10 is the woman speaking and she says it' be Song of Solomon 7 and verse 10, I am my beloveds and his desire is toward me. And then she says in verse 11, come my beloved. In the beginning of the chapters, he's saying to his wife, his beloved, come away. He's calling her away. He's calling her away. Now, when she recognizes I am my beloveds and his desire is toward me, she's calling him to come away as well. I think that's a wonderful thing to recognize this morning that there's such a love affair between Christ and his bride that uh each of them are saying, "I have a desire for you and I have a desire to come away and be alone with you." This hidden secret place is actually the apex. It's actually the the finish. It's actually the final of all the history of Christianity and of all the history of the journey of Christians in every generation. This quiet place in Christ, this hidden place, this pavilion is actually the apex that a Christian comes to. It's the high an apex is the highest point a believer reaches. The apex is the highest point in anything, but it's the, if I'm calling it the apex, it's the highest point a believer reaches. It is above signs. It is above miracles. It is above miracles and signs and wonders. It is above all the great works of God. It is it is the apex. It's the highest point. It is above having everybody in a perfect dress code like the holiness groups. If we would get if we can get everybody just dressed right, then we've reached the apex. And there are some holiness groups. That's the apex. If we could have all the girls and the men and women dressed just right, that's the apex. But I'm here to tell you that's all important in the word of God. But it's not the apex. It's not the highest point. &gt;&gt; If that were the highest point, some of the other groups would do better than us in the dress. Can you say amen? But they make it the apex. And isn't it interesting that there are so many Christian groups that have made the highest point? so many things. And yet, the more I study it, this secret place in Christ, &gt;&gt; is the apex. &gt;&gt; And us believers know that it's so important and it sets the apex. It's the room, it's the secret place that brings forth the rapture. So, it's pretty important. &gt;&gt; It is the apex. It's the ultimate place. It's not the dress code being perfect. It's not uh this all ends with not not in a convention or a geographical place or we're going to all end up in Jeffersonville or we're it's going to end in climax in a camp meeting. That's the apex is a camp meeting or a convention or it doesn't apex in us being the best church in the world and I go to it. No, that's not the apex. Take take all the best of all the Bible and all that God has done through the Old Testament into the New to the upper room to a prophet being on earth to Jesus being on earth and the apex. It's not a time or a church or a certain age or a geographical location or some success. It is a secret place that the bride has been invited into. If you don't get anything else this morning, that's the apex of Christianity. &gt;&gt; You don't have to all say amen, but I've looked at this enough to realize after everything God has done, this is the highest point that a believer can reach. And we're at the end here, friends. &gt;&gt; I want to know what the highest point is. And guess what? I want to be there. Everything I've been preaching, say, Lord, bring me to live in that place every day and never come out of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The apex is not a time or church or location or success. It's a secret place. It is the highest point a believer can come to or reach to. And I want to refer to Enoch because Enoch was our type. How many believe Enoch was our type in the Bible? We have many types of the bride, but Enoch was definitely our type. And Enoch reached the apex. You can't get any better than a scripture saying, "And Enoch was not for God took him. And to us, that would probably be the apex is the rapture, the coming of the Lord, getting out of here. Can you say amen? I I'd say all Christians would agree our goal is heaven. Our goal is to be on the other side. What Christians miss though is that the apex isn't necessarily going to the other side. The apex is where we're living before we get to the other side. Because when we go to read Enoch and we read about his life, he does not have a huge biography. probably just two verses or three at the most of his life. And if we know that he made it in a rapture, that he was translated and was not for God took him, then when we go to read, we're looking at how was this guy, what was his apex before he got out of here? What was he doing before he got here? And we go to the scripture of our perfect type and we're curious, what kind of man is this? What kind of lifestyle is living before the rapture? Because he was raptured. Uh is he raising the dead? Uh, was he an influencer on social media? Did he reach any heights? How many hits did he get on his social media? Wh was he an influ was he a famous singer? Was he a famous preacher? What was his gifts? What was his talents? What was he doing before the rapture? Was he the biggest amener in church? Did he dance all over the building? What was he what was the apex of Enoch before the rapture? And the Bible just simply says before the rapture, he had this testimony that he pleased God and he walked with God. &gt;&gt; And we're we're curious. We're looking what was he doing just before the rapture and we're curious. We go and we read it for the first time. That's it. That's what he was doing. &gt;&gt; It wasn't miracles, signs, and wonders. And you you trust me now? We're always going to have miracles and signs and wonder. If God is among us, he's a God of the supernatural. He's always going to be doing the super supernatural. He's always going to be healing cancer like you did a few weeks ago with my sister, the tumor is completely gone. If God is among us, he's a supernatural God. But I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about what was Enoch doing before. What was the apex? &gt;&gt; And the apex, his biography is real short, like three verses. He walked with God &gt;&gt; and God took him &gt;&gt; and he pleased God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; See, we don't make that the apex because we make all the other flashy stuff important. Can I get him? Can I get a witness this morning? That's it. He walked with God. That's it. He He pleased God. That was the apex. That was the highest point. And I want to be there. I want to bring in another element to it that we have not preached on in relation to the secret place. It's a place has been referred to as a place of refuge. It's a place of security. It's a place of God's protection and provision for believers. It's a place of finding refuge and and God in God's presence and refuge in God's promises. We heard that Wednesday night so beautifully that we need to be resting in one place and that's God's promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't rest in the economy. We can't rest in family members. We can't even rest. Husbands and wives, you can't rest in anything but the promise of God. And you find your place. I'm I'm focused on the promise of God. I'm resting in the promise. And this is a place where you're resting in his presence. You're resting in his promises. It's resting in his uh completely in the promise. And we have a place to run from, as I've been preaching, from our struggles and from our troubles. It's a place to run. I'll tell you friends, this world is getting so busy. Uh did you know how many has read the last few days that the the earth is spinning faster, &gt;&gt; you know? I didn't need to hear that. But something is happening and global warming or whatever it is. They're messing with things and also the glaciers and all that and it's affecting our days a little bit and it's going to start doing that a little bit more. But our days are shorter. I didn't need to read that. I feel it. Right. &gt;&gt; I I I got up and Tuesday they said this last Tuesday we ended up with a shorter day just by a second or less than a second. Well, I needed that second. You know, I had a lot of stuff to get done. I don't need shorter days. I need longer ones. And we're ended up shredding. That's because this world is spinning faster. And then our heads are spinning because the earth is spinning faster. How many can say amen? You know, we we need to really uh look into this secret place because we're so busy, we can't get quiet alone with God. &gt;&gt; The world's spinning and and Tuesday, I know it happened Tuesday before I even read it in the article because Tuesday, it was a shorter day, they said. And I know it was because I got up in the morning, I brushed my teeth, I went and mowled my grass, then I took my mom out for a date as I do every Tuesday night. I love my mom. I loved her husband, too. He was like a father to me. Every Tuesday night, I mowed the grass. I took my mom out, and then I went to bed. So, I know I didn't get anything else done. That was it. I know the day was shorter, and it was frustrating cuz I had 10 other things I needed to get done. So, I know this is happening. And I know to tell you this morning if it's happening physically, but it's also happening that we're too busy to spend time alone with the Lord. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I said we're so busy that time with the Lord is the last on the list. &gt;&gt; And somehow we got to get a revelation that it can't be the last on the list. &gt;&gt; And the times we're living, it's got to be the first on the list. Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; It's got to be first. And I'm going to show you some of the deeper reasons why it needs to be first on your list. And so now we see then this other element I want to talk about here as the times get more stressful. Here is one thing that has been missed that I haven't talked about. And when I was reading the meanings of this pavilion, this quiet place, and what David talked about, all the other meanings I just gave, a place of protection, a place of rest, a place to run to, uh, a place of refreshment. But here's one thing that I I missed in this mystery of the hiding place. They called it, they said it is a place of intimacy and fellowship with him. I haven't talked about that yet, but to me when I read that intimacy and fellowship that actually the Lord, the reason that he's saying, "I'll hide you here and I'll call you here cuz really he wants intimacy with us. &gt;&gt; He wants fellowship with us. &gt;&gt; And if it's not our priority, it's certainly Christ's priority." &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you how much today as I read the scripture in Song of Solomon, his desire is for me. his desires for my fellowship. We find that under the ministry that it's a place of intimacy and fellowship with him. A place alone with just you and him. The closest resemblance that we have of course to that of just being you and him or you and another person is marriage. Marriage is what God had on earth to reflect this this relationship that is an intimate relationship that is only shared between a husband and wife. God wrote that mystery in marriage on earth. But he was speaking of a greater mystery &gt;&gt; and that is that a husband and wife and I'm going to talk a little bit about that because if you didn't understand the world's twisted all the ideas of what marriage is. You got to go back what God said marriage is. And this is a place of intimacy. This is a place in marriage we know. Uh and let me just say without being too plain in front of the children today that there is an intimacy that's shared exclusively between a husband and wife. The husband and wife relationship is an exclusive relationship at so many levels including physical. But it is only two. Two in this close relationship. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is only shared by two. I want you to just hold that thought now because that's what it is. And I just wanted to say while I'm on these subjects, I try to take the time to teach as well and remind people if you don't understand that concept real deeply, you should not get married yet. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What concept? that it is an intimacy to be shared by just you two. If you don't understand that that I wouldn't get married yet because there's a couple of demonic spirits in the world and the Bible calls them fornication and adultery. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And those spirits are contrary to God's precept of sharing yourself and sharing your emotions and sharing your intimate details of your life and intimacy. God says it's only blessed in the state of marriage. It's only blessed by God after you say I do. Uh the sexual experience is only blessed in one place and that's in marriage, not before and not sharing it with someone else after. &gt;&gt; Come on now. I won't be don't get nervous on me. I won't be too plain. But you got to understand what I'm saying. God, just in case we don't know, it's not to be shared with two or three partners. You're not supposed to be just dating 10 people. Even young people are supposed to set their mind to say, "God, I'm praying because I'm to share all of my emotions, all of my pasts, everything that I am, my affections are being held and being kept to share with one person on the face of the earth. And that's the one person you gave me to share my life with. And when I say I do, I will share everything with them. And after I'm married, I will not share any of the rest of it with anybody else." Because the demonic spirits is fornication. doing that before the the wedding and then adultery after. And those two spirits are are are permeating in everything on this earth. The spirits of fornication and adultery means you share yourself with others besides just one. Things intended only for one in life are shared. Why do we have to understand this? Because the atmosphere is around us and on the web, worldwide web and on social media, the clips, the movies, the songs, the music, the books are contaminated with these two spirits of fornication and adultery to cause you to cheapen a relationship that's supposed to be exclusive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Those spirits are to cheapen a relationship that God wants to keep exclusive. Are you typing it with the spiritual now? &gt;&gt; God loves you so much and desires you so much. He doesn't want you sharing your heart with other gods. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want you be giving your affections to something greater than him. He wants your relationship to be exclusive. So if that's true in the natural, it's true in the spiritual. And you start tampering with those things in those spirits, whether by reading this or certain movies. And listen, I'm not going to get into details because the world's so full of it. You got to get the Holy Ghost and make your own decisions. But all I know is the more you feed on it, you'll weaken yourself as a Christian. You will weaken whatever God has given you. If you leave the services like this and go back to feeding on that, you'll weaken yourself. that that will become the dominant thing in your life. Oh, it doesn't bother me. Oh, I can watch this and it doesn't bother me. Well, uh, I'm sorry, but the way God has made us is that what we feed on is what we are. What we feed on is what we think about. What we feed on eventually becomes what we carry out and do. &gt;&gt; Just the way God made us. And this spirit is to cheapen a relationship that's exclusive. Every once in a while, I like to give reminders to our young people. There is one person, I hope you're listening and have enough confidence to listen to a gospel minister tell you. There is one person in life that will you will give your full heart, your full affections of life and physical intimacy. That's not meant for three. It's not meant for 10 to try out 10 of them before you get married. It's meant for one person in life. And you should say, "God, protect my innocence until that one person is there, and then I'll pour it out upon them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not to be shared. It's not to be played. And then after the commitment of I do at the ceremony, nothing before that. There's one place that's blessed and approved of God. I want to make it crystal clear. If you feed on those spirits of fornication every day on social media, on movies, if you take their mindset of sexual things, if you feed on those spirits of adultery over time, are you listening? You must be because you're quiet. &gt;&gt; You feed on those spirits of fornication, adultery, and all those clips. It eventually gets lodged in your spirit. &gt;&gt; You go for a while and you're just looking at it. But then the way God made the human being is you feed on something of that adultery or fornication spirit gets lodged in your spirit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then you're now you're talking about a different thing because when it gets lodged in your spirit, lust is not satisfied. You can't get enough of looking at this stuff. You can't get enough of listening to the kind of music that's encouraging. You can't get enough of it. And so because lust is not satisfied, you keep going that direction. And so that's why you ended up in the fornication is over time it got lodged into your spirit and carried you to where you become possessed with it yourself and then you carry it out. Just like a demon, just like a demon now came into your spirit. Now I want to say this as a positive. Just like a demon can come into your spirit, a demon can be cast out of your spirit. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? Just like a demon comes into your spirit by what you feed on, a demon can be cast out of you by feeding on the right thing. By inviting your life into the Holy Ghost, inviting him into your life, you can be delivered of fornication spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not lodged in your spirit anymore. And if you want forgiveness and freedom from the Lord, God can do it. But don't say that I want to be delivered. I don't like living this way. Don't say you want deliverance and go back to your trash this week like a dog back to its vomit. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work that way. I don't like this. I want this off of me, but I'm coming up for prayer. When you come up for prayer, we're asking for a supernatural God to get that spirit lodged and take get it cast out somewhere else. But don't dare go back to the trash you're feeding on &gt;&gt; because you invite it back again. Jesus said, "A house is cleaned, completely sanctified, and because it didn't get filled, seven other demons come back and fill that house." It's just the way human beings work &gt;&gt; and you can invite the wrong things. What about married people? Should we just talk about the young people in fornication? Or should we mention that feeding on demons of adultery in books and the internet? No sense just warning the young people. &gt;&gt; We should warn the married couples. You will feed on adultery enough in subtle ways it gets lodged in your spirit and now the exclusive love for you that you have for the one you made a vow to begins to be shared. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; The oneness in the marriage is broken. No, there's no divorce yet. But the oneness has been broken because it's not exclusive anymore. The bedroom is for rest and it's for intimacy between husband and wife and no one else. Now, if that's what God's mind was for marriage on earth, if he was thinking that way, an exclusive intimacy between just two, then that's what he had in his mind even more for you and him. I'm finishing this series now. In the day of trouble, what does he say he will do? What am I going to do with the trouble you're facing? Well, how is God going to deal with it? I'll hide you in my pavilion. Is he going to just give me more superpower? Yeah, he'll power to overcome, but what's he going to do? I've got to hide you. I want to be alone with you. I want to fellowship with you that you can be refreshed. Can you say amen? And when Song of Solomon says this, I want to comment now as I close on Song of Solomon. You know, it's the most intimate eight chapters of the Bible. Some rabbis in the early day begin to tell people not to even read the Song of Solomon because it was just too graphic and too intimate. But then you look at it and the rabbis later some of them says they said first it makes the hands impure so don't read it, don't touch it. Then later as they begin to look they called it the most sacred chapters of the Bible. Why? Because there's a mystery in there about Christ and the bride exclusive relationship. When we really look at it, it's such a deep love between them and it is so deep. They both are meeting their deepest thirst in one another and no one else. God gives us a fountain for the deepest thirst within us. &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
