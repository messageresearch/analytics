[0:00] in john 13
[0:01] verse 31
[0:03] therefore when he was gone out and he's
[0:05] speaking of judas when he left the room
[0:07] when judas went out jesus said now
[0:11] is the son of man glorified and god is
[0:13] glorified in him
[0:15] if god be glorified in him
[0:18] god should also god shall also glorify
[0:21] him in himself and shall straightway
[0:24] glorify him
[0:25] it's a it's a couple of mysterious
[0:27] scriptures and for years you read these
[0:30] things and you try to ponder them
[0:32] and you look at them and as you grow in
[0:33] the lord they become more and more clear
[0:35] but it's always been puzzling to me just
[0:37] how all that is worded
[0:39] we know we know jesus gave glory to the
[0:41] father we know jesus gave glory to god
[0:43] in his life he always glorified god
[0:46] but then now he says now the he's asking
[0:48] the father to come and glorify him
[0:50] and so he goes on if you skip over to
[0:52] john 17
[0:54] he's speaking of the same thing when he
[0:56] says in john 17 and verse 1 and 2 these
[0:59] words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes
[1:02] to heaven and said father the hour is
[1:04] come glorify thy son that thy son also
[1:08] may glorify thee
[1:10] so he's echoing this again
[1:12] as thou hast given him power over all
[1:15] flesh
[1:16] that he should give eternal life to as
[1:19] many as thou
[1:21] has given him and this is eternal life
[1:23] that they may know thee the only true
[1:25] god and jesus christ whom now has sent
[1:28] so this glorifying of the son
[1:30] is related to giving eternal life to as
[1:33] many as i've given him remember last
[1:34] sunday eternal life is living for others
[1:37] and when jesus said that greater works
[1:40] will you do he said to the church the
[1:42] works that i'm doing you will do also
[1:45] everything jesus is doing he can repeat
[1:47] through his body
[1:49] but then he says greater work should you
[1:51] do when we found out last sunday what's
[1:52] greater works than all the miracles
[1:54] signs and wonders that jesus did he said
[1:56] the greater work is not somebody's
[1:58] healed of cancer some of the greater
[2:00] works is that you have the power to
[2:01] impart eternal life to someone else
[2:04] because having eternal life is greater
[2:06] than physically being healed temporarily
[2:09] the church has power to do that
[2:11] jesus said it
[2:13] amen so then he's in the subject of
[2:14] being glorified and the last one is john
[2:16] 17 if you wouldn't mind in verse 21
[2:19] he says that they all may be one as thou
[2:23] father art in me he's praying for the
[2:25] church here as believers before he
[2:27] leaves
[2:28] that they all may be one as thou father
[2:30] art in me and i in thee
[2:32] that they may also may be one in us that
[2:36] the world may believe that the thou has
[2:38] sent me
[2:40] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[2:42] have given them
[2:44] that they may be one even as we are one
[2:48] so now the next step is that
[2:50] the glo he had the glory of the of the
[2:52] of god
[2:54] in his life and now he says lord the
[2:56] glory that we have and the oneness that
[2:59] we have i want them to have that glory
[3:01] too in them
[3:03] so now
[3:04] i in them verse 23 and thou in me that
[3:08] they may be perfect in one and that the
[3:10] world may know that thou has sent me and
[3:13] has loved them as thou has loved me when
[3:16] this glory comes it will bring true
[3:20] oneness
[3:22] when this glory comes in the church
[3:25] it will bring true oneness
[3:28] and remember it's not a one night event
[3:30] because paul says we are changed from
[3:34] glory to glory to glory and the more
[3:38] glory we get
[3:39] the more one we should become
[3:43] and i got everybody on board so far
[3:46] amen i want to speak on the glory that
[3:48] makes us one
[3:50] father bless your word anointed father
[3:53] and we recognize in humility
[3:56] the
[3:57] insufficiency of man
[3:59] to meet needs that are crucial in
[4:02] other men's lives
[4:04] but lord we pray that you'll minister to
[4:06] those hearing here today and those on
[4:08] streaming lord that you will do
[4:10] something supernatural in our mess lord
[4:12] in our hearts and change us from glory
[4:14] to glory we thank you for the songs we
[4:17] thank you for the special we thank you
[4:18] lord to feel the fellowship and to feel
[4:20] your presence here today may it all
[4:22] change us and may we learn something of
[4:24] you as we sit at your feet and we ask it
[4:26] in the name of jesus christ
[4:28] amen and amen once you shake somebody's
[4:30] hand before you seated god bless you
[4:43] i've been
[4:44] thinking lately about relationships
[4:47] and um
[4:49] i heard some good feedback from a couple
[4:52] wednesday nights i did hear on betrayal
[4:55] and uh in those kind of unique services
[4:58] because i got pretty down rubber meets
[5:00] the road about relationships and about
[5:02] betrayal and speaking of that and i got
[5:04] some good feedback from it so i feel the
[5:06] lord leading me to go into relationships
[5:08] a little bit talk about them but i have
[5:10] probably more questions than i have
[5:11] answers right now in talking about
[5:14] relationships i think it's a very
[5:15] important subject i think
[5:17] that we can't talk about it enough and
[5:19] so when we talked about those the
[5:21] betrayal that jesus experienced then we
[5:23] realized that we experienced betrayal as
[5:25] well
[5:26] and the effect that it has on human
[5:28] beings is really
[5:30] pretty strong sometimes when we are
[5:32] betrayed when we are abandoned when we
[5:34] are neglected sometimes it happens when
[5:37] we're children in fact most the time it
[5:38] happens when we're children you know we
[5:40] can have the best of parents but no
[5:42] parent is perfect and parents have
[5:44] different issues and different things
[5:46] they're learning as they go along but
[5:48] then you have the extreme situations
[5:49] where a child was actually abandoned the
[5:51] child was neglected and these have a a
[5:55] long-term effect on human beings we
[5:58] don't deal with betrayal very well we
[6:00] don't do deal with abandonment very well
[6:03] so when we when we come into that i
[6:05] wanted to learn from jesus life as he
[6:07] come to the final hours of his life i
[6:10] was looking at jesus and how he reacted
[6:12] to betrayal because as i said there's no
[6:15] man that's ever been betrayed like jesus
[6:17] was
[6:18] there's no man who has lost his friends
[6:20] like jesus was at the end in the time
[6:22] when he needed friends in the time he
[6:24] needed support in the time he needed
[6:26] commitment from his disciples in the
[6:28] time that he needed his friends the most
[6:31] that's when they all abandoned him his
[6:32] closest friends even peter james and
[6:34] john who he trusted many times as being
[6:38] exclusive to bring in a room to pray for
[6:40] a dead man or dead girl and raise him to
[6:42] life he had he had close friendships
[6:44] with these men and when the end when it
[6:46] was all said and done there was a
[6:48] betrayal of every one of they all
[6:49] forsook them they all left him and some
[6:51] of them screaming out in their loyalty
[6:53] to him i would never leave you jesus i
[6:55] would never leave you and he said peter
[6:57] before the crows you'll deny me
[6:59] three times and so human energy and
[7:02] human commitment wasn't enough and so
[7:04] the loneliness that he experienced the
[7:06] betrayal i feel i feel oh lord
[7:09] is it true that you ended your life and
[7:11] come to the end with no one there you
[7:13] were completely alone is it to my heart
[7:16] just rejoices in the lord and goes out
[7:18] to the lord today that he would
[7:19] experience that but don't forget our
[7:22] lord had to experience everything that
[7:24] we experienced
[7:27] our lord had to go through every
[7:29] temptation that we're tempted by the
[7:31] bible said he was tempted at all points
[7:33] as we are and tempted by a sexual lust
[7:37] tempted by all the things we think well
[7:39] jesus never experienced that no in order
[7:41] to be a high priest he had to go through
[7:43] everything people say well why do you
[7:45] have to be born a baby and go through
[7:46] the teenage years why did why couldn't
[7:48] he just come as a lamb at 33 years old
[7:50] old and go right to calvary because he
[7:53] had to be born a baby and go through
[7:54] every life situation go through his
[7:57] teenage years so that when you go to
[7:59] pray he understands what you're going
[8:01] through when a teenager is lonely and
[8:04] crying out to god he understands because
[8:07] he was a teenager as well
[8:09] our lord had to be the right he was a
[8:11] kinsmen redeemer redeemer but he had to
[8:14] be a right faithful high priest who had
[8:16] lived out every area of your life can
[8:19] somebody say man can somebody raise your
[8:21] hand and say my lord went through every
[8:23] season of life
[8:25] that's why i love him so much can you
[8:27] say man but betrayal he went through
[8:29] betrayal and being abandoned and he went
[8:32] through loneliness more than any other
[8:34] human being has ever went through before
[8:35] and he didn't deserve that he didn't
[8:37] deserve to lose his friends but you see
[8:40] jesus i'm watching him because he did
[8:42] not get into these molly grubs of this
[8:44] victim mentality he didn't close himself
[8:47] off he didn't say i'm finished with
[8:49] everybody he said he didn't say i'm not
[8:51] going to calvary and he had the choice
[8:54] to leave it all and say i can't believe
[8:56] i've been abandoned i'm going to go live
[8:58] my own life he had the choice and yet
[9:01] when he was abandoned and betrayed he
[9:03] made the decision to head straight
[9:06] towards calvary
[9:09] i'm learning something from his life
[9:12] that he didn't become a victim mentality
[9:15] even though he was falsely accused
[9:19] he said i'm not going to let this get to
[9:21] me because i understand
[9:23] why they're doing this maybe he doesn't
[9:25] understand all of it but he had to
[9:26] understand i see this i see the big
[9:28] picture and it's amazing to me i've got
[9:30] to finish in this area but he says it's
[9:33] amazing to me to see jesus came into
[9:36] something that not only endured the
[9:39] mistreatment of the betrayal and the
[9:41] mistreatment of judas and the
[9:43] mistreatment of his own disciples but he
[9:46] kept walking towards the sacrifice and
[9:50] death that would correct the core
[9:53] problem in human beings
[9:58] all right i thought i'd need to say that
[10:00] one again
[10:01] jesus made the choice in that betrayal
[10:05] to keep walking towards the sacrifice
[10:08] now i'm going to preach about
[10:09] relationships
[10:10] you better be listening real close
[10:13] jesus when he was betrayed made the
[10:16] choice to walk towards sacrifice
[10:19] and a death to himself that would
[10:22] correct the core problem that's in human
[10:25] beings
[10:29] and any other choice
[10:31] wouldn't have been the victory
[10:33] and the freedom that we sang about this
[10:35] morning
[10:36] freedom to worship freedom to dance
[10:39] you can't even do that or sing that
[10:41] unless he went to calvary for you can i
[10:43] get an amen this morning
[10:45] unless some you couldn't even come back
[10:48] into relationship with god to talk to
[10:50] him this morning unless somebody made a
[10:53] sacrifice for your life unless somebody
[10:56] said i'm headed to calvary anyway i'm
[10:58] gonna do it alone but for the future of
[11:00] these people for the future of
[11:02] relationship i'm going to go the hard
[11:04] way i'm going to go the via dolorosa i'm
[11:06] going to go to calvary i'm going to go
[11:08] to the death because i know that will be
[11:11] their victory over this betraying spirit
[11:17] over this thing that says
[11:19] i'm going to deny you i'm going to put
[11:20] my wall up i'm going to become an island
[11:23] i'm going to go by myself
[11:25] jesus said the only way to solve that
[11:28] is to go to calvary and sacrifice
[11:31] so that i break down the middle wall of
[11:34] partition
[11:37] between man and god
[11:40] you talk about walls up
[11:42] people had a wall towards god
[11:45] and god had a wall towards them
[11:49] he did yeah because you in sin
[11:52] you're born in sin you're unacceptable
[11:54] to god but i did so much and i gave so
[11:57] much to the united way
[11:59] without calvary and the blood you're
[12:01] unacceptable to god
[12:04] it's not your good works that make you a
[12:05] christian
[12:08] and so to to break down the middle wall
[12:11] partition to break down the walls
[12:13] between god and man there had to be a
[12:16] sacrifice made you'll never have better
[12:18] relationships until sacrifices are made
[12:22] until humility comes in
[12:25] is that okay with everybody
[12:27] if it's okay with you i'll continue
[12:30] and if it's okay with you it's okay with
[12:32] me that you don't even say amen today
[12:34] you just listen
[12:39] to restore the relationship with god
[12:41] lost in the garden of eden and to
[12:42] restore oneness and relationship between
[12:45] god and man to bring back ultimate
[12:47] oneness which is what jesus is speaking
[12:50] him and the father were one and he says
[12:52] i pray that they would become with us as
[12:54] we are one and then i pray that they
[12:56] would become one with one another now
[12:58] this is a prayer over the church before
[13:00] he left this is a prophecy how many
[13:03] believe that if anybody's prayer is
[13:04] going to be answered it's going to be
[13:06] jesus prayer
[13:08] you may think god's not answering your
[13:10] prayer but god always answers prayer
[13:12] whether it's yes or no but i can tell
[13:14] you one thing there's no doubt jesus
[13:16] prayer is going to be heard and you know
[13:18] what his prayer is here that they may be
[13:20] one as we are one
[13:22] that they would come to true oneness not
[13:24] through a denomination not through a
[13:26] mechanical legislated thing not through
[13:28] a world council of churches no no no no
[13:30] no they're going to use that scripture
[13:32] by the way they're gonna the the the
[13:34] church systems are using this scripture
[13:36] that we all become one all the
[13:39] denominations become one but they're not
[13:41] allowed to take that and apply that
[13:42] scripture they're not allowed to use
[13:44] that mechanically it's god that will
[13:46] make us one with one another it's the
[13:48] holy ghost
[13:50] glory be to god it's only by the holy
[13:53] ghost
[13:54] that the church becomes one
[13:57] it's actually when we break down our
[13:58] denominational barriers
[14:01] that god and by the only by the holy
[14:03] ghost one spirit do we become one
[14:07] it's only by the glory of god
[14:10] and so now
[14:12] questions you know
[14:13] there's questions about relationships
[14:15] that i've had i trust you're not
[14:16] offended by this but the things that i
[14:19] ask why under this great restoration
[14:21] message
[14:22] is family relationships still lacking
[14:30] why does someone say that they have a
[14:31] relationship with god
[14:33] and still have their walls up
[14:35] and their grudges
[14:37] to certain ones and favor others within
[14:39] the church
[14:43] just some questions
[14:46] why do some relationships cause other
[14:48] relationships to break up
[14:51] am i allowed to ask questions
[14:54] i don't even know all the reasons to
[14:55] these but i'm asking god why is this
[14:57] happening why why why why does
[15:01] why is it that when someone repents the
[15:03] grudge is still held against them for
[15:05] years
[15:11] why can some talk so religious and be so
[15:14] seem so close to god
[15:16] but have years of unresolved issues with
[15:19] their children and their wife
[15:27] hello
[15:30] has everybody left the building
[15:36] i don't mean this i don't mean this
[15:38] isn't this is 33 years of pastoring and
[15:41] a lot of these questions i ask myself
[15:42] because i've seen these breakdowns in my
[15:44] response to relationships i'm just
[15:47] asking the questions i'm asking you to
[15:49] take
[15:50] take them home with you and consider it
[15:52] why is it someone repents and the grudge
[15:54] is still held for years why can some
[15:56] talk told religious online on the
[15:58] internet close to god but have years of
[16:00] unresolved issues with children
[16:02] unforgiving spirit why can someone
[16:04] preach such wonderful things across the
[16:06] pulpit and but they can cut you off and
[16:08] disown you
[16:13] and label you through their preaching in
[16:15] a certain category why does that happen
[16:19] why do people say they are a christian
[16:21] and look for reasons to separate from
[16:23] the body of christ
[16:26] why are families sometimes completely
[16:30] locked up
[16:32] maybe because there's a secret rule in
[16:34] the family we don't talk about that
[16:36] don't talk about that children we don't
[16:37] talk about that we don't go there
[16:40] why are families locked up because of it
[16:43] and a lot of times daddy has locked him
[16:44] up and doesn't realize he's doing it
[16:47] i'm talking about relationships i'm
[16:50] saying
[16:51] that if if we have been restored in a
[16:54] full
[16:55] back to eden relationship unhindered
[16:58] because remember oneness
[17:00] intimacy that adam and eve had with god
[17:02] into intimacy the world has twisted
[17:05] intimacy and made it sex intimacy is not
[17:07] sex it's part of it but in a
[17:09] relationship with husband and wife
[17:10] intimacy is a relationship without walls
[17:17] and there's you can talk about anything
[17:19] because there's no walls up between you
[17:22] that's real intimacy so how many
[17:24] marriages are married having relations
[17:26] and you know what i'm talking about but
[17:28] no intimacy the walls have been up for
[17:30] years we don't talk about that we don't
[17:32] go there
[17:34] he's hiding something or she's hiding
[17:35] something or the children are hiring
[17:37] something and nobody's allowed to talk
[17:38] about it's got the family all locked up
[17:40] trying to come to church and raise their
[17:41] hands and trying to be free
[17:42] and there's no talk about it there's no
[17:44] openness there's no alpinatus
[17:45] conversations if all the walls are up
[17:48] listen i i'm interested in a gospel and
[17:50] a message that is preached that brings
[17:53] deliverance not just here at church and
[17:55] not just to help your relationship with
[17:57] god but that can trickle down into our
[18:00] families and our relationships
[18:03] god please bring the reality of the
[18:06] blood of jesus christ to the people
[18:10] i don't want to be a big preacher i
[18:12] don't want to be a big church i'm really
[18:13] not interested in it how many is here
[18:15] today doesn't matter to me my whoever is
[18:18] here i want there to be a better
[18:20] relationship with god when they leave
[18:21] and a better relationship with the body
[18:23] of christ and better relationships and
[18:25] families and better relationship even to
[18:27] the people who hate you and maybe never
[18:30] will like you your response is
[18:32] everything
[18:35] and if we can't get there then there's
[18:37] something wrong with how we're preaching
[18:38] the message
[18:41] because i'm not interested in getting
[18:42] you built up emotionally so that you
[18:44] feel good today and go right back to the
[18:46] walls that you have
[18:52] praise the lord
[18:54] so why why why my so many y's i could go
[18:57] on all day with the wise i have i have a
[19:00] million of them
[19:02] but you know that's that's kind of
[19:04] staying on the negative
[19:06] we'd all be pretty depressed when i if i
[19:08] spent this whole service on why how do i
[19:10] get to the wise i want to get to the
[19:11] answers
[19:13] i want to get to some victories
[19:15] you probably got a million wives you can
[19:16] tell me
[19:17] why is
[19:19] uncle soul soul never talk to me
[19:22] why does aunt lou
[19:24] i shouldn't use that because we have
[19:26] we had aunt lou in the family
[19:28] i didn't mean aunt lou
[19:33] why does aunt sue i can't use that one
[19:36] either
[19:38] man i got a lot of ants
[19:40] a lot of uncles
[19:43] why does this person you probably got a
[19:46] lot of wise too
[19:47] and the question is is that how come
[19:49] relationships aren't better
[19:53] if jesus said
[19:55] this effect
[19:57] will affect marriages will affect
[19:59] families
[20:01] if this is bringing us back to eden
[20:04] then where's the proof of it
[20:08] it's good now not let's not be so
[20:10] negative because we see some
[20:12] families that grow in marriages that
[20:14] grow you're sitting amongst people that
[20:16] marriages were restored that was
[20:17] impossible
[20:19] they shouldn't even be sitting together
[20:20] today today
[20:22] but by god's grace and the blood of
[20:24] jesus christ they're sitting together
[20:25] and their marriage has been restored so
[20:27] let's not be all negative but but for
[20:29] those of us who struggle sometimes and
[20:31] say lord why is this day why is this way
[20:33] we want i've been asking these questions
[20:35] now on wednesday night brother rap we've
[20:37] seen something that brother rath was
[20:38] bringing in this in the study of the
[20:40] church ages last wednesday night of
[20:42] every month brother wrap i'm giving a
[20:43] commercial here last wednesday night of
[20:45] every month brother raps taking us to
[20:46] the seven church ages you'd be good to
[20:48] come get you a church age book and study
[20:49] it out together it's great well one
[20:51] thing that we found that the godhead is
[20:53] he studying the godhead how god was one
[20:55] how
[20:56] the father-son holy spirit that's been
[20:58] split up into three different
[20:59] personalities is actually a detriment to
[21:02] the church because we realize you can
[21:04] never split god into three personalities
[21:06] it's three offices father son holy ghost
[21:08] and so we're learning about the godhead
[21:10] and we're learning that he's one he
[21:11] can't be anything else but one
[21:14] jesus said when you see me you see the
[21:15] father
[21:16] okay it's not a different personality so
[21:18] we're learning about that but one thing
[21:20] that i learned wednesday night is that
[21:21] god has is not to be just a doctrine
[21:24] taught to us there's so much more to us
[21:26] the reason why we need to know the
[21:28] godhead the reason why we need to
[21:29] understand how god was in christ because
[21:32] we can understand how god was in christ
[21:34] we can start understanding how god is
[21:36] living in us
[21:38] so it's the revelation of it it's not a
[21:40] doctrine it's not as brother rap said
[21:42] it's not an academic study but it's
[21:44] something in in fact it's not meant to
[21:47] be understood in our minds it's another
[21:48] point brother rap made it's that
[21:50] understanding the godhead in these minds
[21:52] you're never going to understand it and
[21:54] man for 2000 years has tried to
[21:55] understand that tried to put it together
[21:57] tried to explain it try to split it up
[21:59] 80 325 a.d split god into three
[22:02] different personalities messed with the
[22:04] baptism did all these other things it's
[22:05] all men trying to figure out but yet we
[22:08] can't really understand it with our
[22:09] minds god doesn't want us to catch it in
[22:12] our minds he wants us to catch it by
[22:13] revelation
[22:15] oh praise the lord in fact it's not
[22:16] meant to be understood in our minds but
[22:18] beyond academic study we see as brother
[22:21] wrap said it's god's heart from the
[22:23] before the beginning and this wonderful
[22:26] condescension of god and what is it it's
[22:29] the condescension of god god coming down
[22:33] getting closer to us all the time and
[22:37] god becoming one with man his 6 000 year
[22:41] process since the fall of condescending
[22:44] condescending condescending until
[22:47] finally he comes in a human being like
[22:49] us not like us in the sense that jesus
[22:51] was virgin born we weren't virgin bored
[22:53] but he was the full human being and god
[22:56] said i'll pour all of myself into this
[22:58] human being what was he saying it's god
[23:01] saying i'm coming down so that i can
[23:03] live in my temple which is not this
[23:06] church
[23:07] in the temple of the souls of men
[23:10] that's the godhead
[23:11] [Applause]
[23:13] it's god's great mystery expressed to us
[23:16] that god in christ were one
[23:18] and we in christ are one
[23:23] it's god getting closer all the time
[23:25] and one thing at the end of his teaching
[23:27] wednesday night intrigued me
[23:29] satan has fought this truth of the
[23:32] godhead more than any other
[23:34] truth
[23:37] he has messed with it
[23:40] he hates satan he hates this teaching
[23:43] that christ could be the fullness christ
[23:47] could be the fullness of god in flesh
[23:50] satan hates this why does satan hate
[23:53] this that actually the god could pour
[23:55] himself the completion of himself pour
[23:58] himself completely in a human being
[24:01] jesus christ satan hates that he doesn't
[24:03] like that i'm going to tell you in a
[24:04] minute why he's been exposed we know why
[24:07] he's jealous of why he doesn't like it
[24:08] but he is thought that god could dwell
[24:11] in humans in perfect oneness so here's
[24:13] two things that god could be in jesus
[24:16] christ in his fullness but that god
[24:18] by spirit could dwell in the human
[24:20] beings i'm not talking about a
[24:22] relationship where we just say i'm
[24:24] trying to be like jesus and i'm trying
[24:26] to be like the father and i've i've i've
[24:29] uh i've adjusted myself to be a better
[24:31] person to be like jesus and so i'm
[24:34] trying to be like the father and father
[24:36] that's not the relationship friends the
[24:38] relationship is by spirit by spirit that
[24:41] his own spirit is living within you that
[24:46] is how we're one
[24:49] and satan
[24:51] can't stand
[24:53] that doctrine
[24:55] no can't be true can't that that god
[24:58] could dwell in humans in perfect oneness
[25:01] he can't stand it
[25:03] it could
[25:04] not be so
[25:06] and so he takes and splits
[25:08] god into three personalities of father
[25:10] son and holy spirit you've probably
[25:12] never heard these things before i
[25:13] encourage you to study your bible study
[25:15] the word of god the open book from the
[25:16] last days the restoration ministry to
[25:19] bring us back into the truths that were
[25:20] lost for 2 000 years in church history
[25:24] trinity is number one the trinity truth
[25:26] is not based in the bible it's not based
[25:29] you say well sure seems like it because
[25:30] he's talking to the father you have to
[25:32] understand that because if you take that
[25:34] and say he's a different personality
[25:36] than the father you take it too far and
[25:38] you make god too instead of one
[25:42] and
[25:43] he's only one
[25:45] he doesn't want worshipping three
[25:46] different entities
[25:48] that's idolatry
[25:52] god sold you excuse me god so if satan
[25:55] sold you i'm going to quote the
[25:56] prophet's word satan sold you the
[25:59] doctrine of the trinity to make an
[26:00] idolater out of you
[26:04] because if you read your bible it's
[26:06] idolatry that was the problem all along
[26:08] serve me i'm one god get rid of the
[26:11] other gods don't serve two or three
[26:12] don't serve 50.
[26:14] ra or egypt whatever god it is god i
[26:16] don't want you serving other gods i'm
[26:18] the one true god
[26:19] i want you worshipped only to me
[26:23] amen those who are bible readers know
[26:24] that i'm right on the bible so we could
[26:26] never fully say
[26:28] all of god poured himself into one best
[26:30] vessel and this way splits god why is he
[26:33] split into three personalities i got to
[26:34] finish with this because i got a lot of
[26:36] other stuff so why did he split into
[26:38] three personalities so we could never
[26:40] say all of god poured into one vessel
[26:42] god couldn't do that no he wasn't fully
[26:44] god he was just the second person of the
[26:46] trinity his doctrine of the trinity
[26:48] wants to limit that full truth that god
[26:50] could put himself in a man that way also
[26:53] to make an idolater out of you to lie
[26:55] and say it's not really the same as fear
[26:58] as same spirit in christ to say the
[27:00] spirit in christ was not the same spirit
[27:03] as god it's the father living in the son
[27:06] a third personality of the same spirit
[27:08] in fellowship with the father but not
[27:10] really the father that's a lie that you
[27:13] tell the people
[27:14] that it's not really the father it's
[27:17] just a good fellowship between in
[27:19] relationship between the father and son
[27:21] but it's not really the father living in
[27:23] him i'm here to tell you it was the
[27:26] father
[27:27] the fullness of the father
[27:29] living in jesus christ
[27:31] he messed with oneness he is limiting
[27:35] relationship to fellowship with a
[27:36] different personality rather than
[27:38] relationship based on it's the same
[27:40] spirit and then he messes is what
[27:42] brother rap said he messed with baptism
[27:44] as people will come to give their lives
[27:46] to christ now listen now
[27:49] people will come and make the act and
[27:51] step and there's a young girl i'm
[27:52] talking to today
[27:54] the young grand girl that will talk
[27:55] about baptism she wants to be baptized
[27:57] god's led her heart
[27:59] human beings will come and take the step
[28:01] for baptism
[28:03] and they're going to take on his name
[28:06] they're supposed to take on his name
[28:08] that means oneness
[28:11] when a wife gets married
[28:14] she should she used to take on her
[28:16] husband's name
[28:20] that's the way it was that's the way it
[28:21] should be it's in other words my wife
[28:24] became rebecca lafontaine and she was
[28:27] glad to do that and she's glad to take
[28:29] my identity and come underneath my
[28:30] identity i shouldn't say underneath but
[28:32] come to oneness with me but part of
[28:34] becoming one is to say i don't want to
[28:36] be a separate entity now i'm willing to
[28:38] take on your name
[28:41] now if that's true in human beings
[28:42] that's true with god can you say amen
[28:45] look how satan messes up the baptism and
[28:47] say no no let's twist this baptism
[28:49] you're not going to take on his name
[28:51] because nobody can get that close to god
[28:53] nobody come in that oneness with god
[28:55] where they actually take on his name and
[28:56] oneness so let's mess with the baptism
[28:58] when you get baptized baptize them in
[29:01] the name of titles so when they worship
[29:03] god they're just worshiping this
[29:05] different personality they're worshiping
[29:07] the father and like brother rap said the
[29:09] little girl's confused in in the sunday
[29:11] school class at a at a baptist church
[29:13] excuse me baptist but she's asking which
[29:15] which one do i worship the most the
[29:18] father the son or the holy spirit it
[29:21] brings confusion
[29:23] we only serve one god
[29:26] right and so now satan says i'll mess
[29:29] with the baptism because now when they
[29:30] come at that precious moment to take on
[29:32] his name that means i become one with
[29:35] him can you say a man
[29:38] let's mess that up and you don't really
[29:39] become one with him don't take on his
[29:41] name be baptized in the titles and start
[29:43] to worship all three in your life
[29:46] ah what a deception
[29:48] i just want you to get this point that's
[29:49] what i thought of wednesday night
[29:51] satan
[29:53] is messing
[29:55] with
[29:57] relationship
[30:01] what's he really doing
[30:02] he's limiting this thing that says
[30:06] man and god can become one
[30:08] in a close relationship
[30:12] i'm going to make it about titles i'm
[30:13] going to make it about positions that's
[30:14] why i can't stand it when people are
[30:16] more about position even in coming to
[30:18] church they're more about what position
[30:19] they hold than about christ
[30:22] and they'll make decisions based upon
[30:24] positions and i listen friends this is
[30:26] about relationship
[30:29] this isn't about rules this isn't about
[30:32] positions this is about who's who jesus
[30:35] dissolved that when he washed the
[30:36] disciples feet when he said wash one
[30:38] another's feet you know what he's
[30:39] dissolving positions
[30:42] because the guy that's on the top is
[30:44] going to wash the stinky dirty feet of
[30:46] the lowest guy in the congregation jesus
[30:49] dissolved all positions
[30:52] praise the lord
[30:53] i'm having a good time today even if
[30:55] you're hesitant of where i'm going
[31:00] look at satan messing with relationship
[31:02] no i'm going to limit being that close
[31:04] to say that i'm one with god and i'm
[31:06] taking on his name and through the holy
[31:08] ghost i'm going to become one with the
[31:10] lord
[31:11] i'm going to limit it
[31:12] make it titles that our our attention is
[31:15] on the titles rather than the man you
[31:17] know my children i'm a father
[31:20] i'm a son and i'm
[31:22] a husband
[31:24] but i have a connection with my children
[31:26] i don't want them to be close to me just
[31:29] because i'm their father
[31:33] i want to know their hearts and i want
[31:35] to give my heart to them because this is
[31:37] the closest not because i have the title
[31:40] i could use my title as father i could
[31:42] exercise my authority even when they're
[31:44] not listening even when they're 30 years
[31:46] old i can say well i'm the father you
[31:48] need to do what i say
[31:50] well that's a real good relationship
[31:53] that has no relationship in it
[31:56] is anybody with me here this morning
[31:58] satan messes with the the truth because
[32:02] here it is you want some more proof of
[32:04] it that day that jesus said i and my
[32:06] father are one how many knows he said it
[32:08] i and my father are one it says the jews
[32:11] picked up stones to throw stones at them
[32:14] well who's getting mad at the oneness
[32:16] satan in the people is always angry at
[32:20] the oneness
[32:21] god's people becoming one in
[32:23] relationship with the father
[32:27] now i'll tell you why he's written
[32:28] sinful because what you have if you have
[32:30] the holy ghost and you're becoming one
[32:32] with god and you're one with god by the
[32:34] holy ghost when you're doing that you
[32:36] have a relationship that satan i'm going
[32:38] to tell satan this morning satan i have
[32:42] something that you can never have
[32:44] [Applause]
[32:47] he has been envious from the very
[32:49] beginning of god's children he has been
[32:51] jealous of god's children that's why we
[32:53] have little jealousies come up in the
[32:54] congregation sometimes we should never
[32:56] be jealous of one another if someone
[32:58] excels in the kingdom of god we should
[33:00] rejoice with him but instead it's
[33:02] jealousy oh i want to be there i can't
[33:04] do oh then they put somebody down no if
[33:06] somebody's like brother bram said about
[33:08] enoch he said listen he said he said i'm
[33:10] not going to criticize enoch being
[33:12] translated walking with god so close he
[33:13] went into rapture he said if someone
[33:15] could get that close to god i'm not
[33:16] going to criticize him praise the lord
[33:20] but i'm here to serve satan notice today
[33:22] i'm going to tell him satan i know he's
[33:24] listening he comes to church more than
[33:26] some of you all satan i have in my heart
[33:29] by the holy ghost a relationship with
[33:32] the lord jesus christ that you can never
[33:35] have
[33:41] that's why he hates me so much
[33:43] it's not because he thinks that i'm a
[33:45] good preacher
[33:47] he hates my relationship with god
[33:49] unfettered
[33:51] no walls
[33:52] under the blood of jesus christ i've
[33:54] come back into eden again
[33:56] what was eden
[33:58] unhindered relationship
[34:00] would god by the holy spirit come down
[34:02] in the cool of the evening
[34:04] and cooed
[34:05] with his children adam and eve there was
[34:06] no sin they weren't afraid of god they
[34:09] weren't afraid to talk to god they
[34:11] fellowshipped in the cool of the evening
[34:13] and it was unhindered relationship
[34:15] the blood of jesus christ is bringing
[34:18] god's children back to unhindered
[34:19] relationship
[34:21] not through a priest not through a pope
[34:22] not through a church but you can go
[34:24] directly to god
[34:25] i'll tell you satan's envious if you got
[34:27] that this morning you say praise the
[34:28] lord i got a relationship with him
[34:30] unhindered satan that's why he don't
[34:32] like you
[34:33] and he's tried to stop that relationship
[34:35] from the very beginning including making
[34:37] a false baptism false teaching of the
[34:40] trinity he fights to this day he fights
[34:42] your mind how many raise your hand said
[34:43] the devil fights my mind how many say
[34:46] the devil always tries to question you i
[34:47] don't i don't know if you're one of them
[34:48] you made a mistake the other day i don't
[34:50] even know if you're a child of god how
[34:51] many has that devil speaking to you the
[34:53] reason he does it is he resents he's
[34:55] jealous of your relationship with christ
[34:58] he can't have that he wanted power
[35:01] lucifer arose tried to take the kingdom
[35:03] influence the third of the stars and he
[35:05] wanted to lift his throne above the
[35:06] throne of god he wanted to be worshiped
[35:08] like god he's always wanted that
[35:10] position and then god comes down glory
[35:13] be to god and he hands all the creative
[35:16] power to his son adam not to an angel to
[35:19] his son adam on earth and says adam this
[35:22] earth is yours i created this one
[35:24] specifically for you and guess what you
[35:26] have all the power to change animals
[35:28] names to change mountains to create
[35:30] whatever you want you've got creative
[35:31] power and satan's going but that's what
[35:33] i wanted
[35:36] i want that creative power how many know
[35:38] satan can't create he only perverts what
[35:40] god's already done he cannot create
[35:42] anything but he's wanted it i want it i
[35:44] want it i want it i want that creative
[35:45] power and god comes and gives it to you
[35:48] sons and daughters of god living in you
[35:50] by spirit
[35:52] no wonder he's jealous of you no wonder
[35:54] he fights against you
[35:57] because you've got the very relationship
[36:00] i don't care what you feel about
[36:01] yourself today you might have had a
[36:03] defeated week
[36:04] but you got the holy spirit in you that
[36:06] says amen to the word of god
[36:08] you can tell satan this week start your
[36:10] week different you can tell before you
[36:12] leave this building satan
[36:14] i may not be perfect yet but i've got a
[36:17] connection to god you can never have
[36:20] somebody say praise the lord
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:26] hallelujah
[36:34] this is a quote from
[36:36] brother branham
[36:39] when sometimes when i catch their eyes
[36:40] in this discernment
[36:46] when sometimes i catch their eyes
[36:48] that's how i get them in that channel
[36:50] you see and then it's not mind reading
[36:52] it's not psychology if it is then paul
[36:54] used it when he was looked
[36:56] when he looked upon the man and said
[36:58] i perceive you have faith to be healed
[37:01] i will grant you this
[37:02] it is psychology in this way so
[37:05] this is quite an explanation here
[37:08] brother bryan didn't believe in
[37:09] psychology to try to help people
[37:12] in the sense of being in the answer
[37:14] but when he and the lord used him to
[37:16] discern hearts
[37:18] he said it's that's not psychology
[37:20] people thought well he's reading the
[37:21] mind he's just like doing using
[37:22] psychology no no he said if that's true
[37:24] paul would have been using that
[37:25] but he says i will grant you this it is
[37:28] psychology in this way if psych of
[37:30] course means the mind and it's the mind
[37:32] of christ that the human being has the
[37:33] privilege to enter into and know the
[37:35] mind of christ
[37:36] hallelujah what a reality to dwell in
[37:39] the channel of christ
[37:42] you you think it was just jason that
[37:44] stood there and raised his hand he
[37:46] didn't know there was another brother
[37:48] that was watching that needed that who
[37:50] felt like i've got cancer in the mind
[37:53] you think that's him acting and he's
[37:54] human no no he's tapped into a channel
[38:02] he said i want to stand in the gap for
[38:03] everybody who's got cancer of the mind
[38:05] everybody's got cancer
[38:08] the mind of christ comes in
[38:12] and so hallelujah he says he says and
[38:15] that the human being has the privilege
[38:16] to enter in and know the mind of christ
[38:18] hallelujah what a reality to dwell on
[38:20] the channel christ we unworthy mortals
[38:22] have been brought
[38:23] in to be sons and daughters of god to be
[38:25] fellow citizens and oh my i get to
[38:28] shouting when i get noticed into that
[38:30] realm
[38:31] where even angels can't come you say
[38:33] angels yes sir we're sons and daughters
[38:36] angels are servants that's right the
[38:38] servants cannot go where sons and
[38:40] daughters will go they can't enter into
[38:42] that relationship for their servants and
[38:46] worst sons and daughters
[38:48] so satan can't enter this relationship
[38:50] and not even an angel can have this type
[38:54] of relationship with god
[38:59] not even angels
[39:01] can have what you have access to this
[39:04] morning
[39:05] somebody say praise the lord not even
[39:07] angels
[39:08] angels step back here i come
[39:11] that's the old song used to sing
[39:13] angels step back here i come
[39:15] i just got to praise him for everything
[39:19] he's done
[39:20] i want to cry holy holy i don't know if
[39:22] sister debbie remembers this glory glory
[39:25] glory angels step back here i come
[39:28] because it's all around the throne of
[39:30] god and the angels are worshiping
[39:31] but listen they're worshiping because
[39:34] he's the creator but we're worshiping
[39:36] because he's the redeemer
[39:38] and angels can't sing that song
[39:42] so they're all worshiping every day
[39:44] but then when he's declared the redeemer
[39:46] the angels got to step back and say what
[39:48] do you mean
[39:49] and that's when your angels step back
[39:52] here i come
[39:53] i just got to praise him for everything
[39:56] he's done
[40:00] it's a song the angels can't sing
[40:03] and they don't have a relationship
[40:06] that believers have
[40:08] directly to christ
[40:14] amen
[40:15] so the glory makes us one let's let's
[40:18] let's move on
[40:20] the glory according to our texts
[40:23] come into christ
[40:25] made him one with the father and then he
[40:26] says now my glory he says that they all
[40:29] may be one
[40:30] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[40:32] have given them
[40:34] that they may be one so now let's take
[40:35] this a step deeper everybody still with
[40:37] me the glory that makes us one
[40:40] jesus refers often to the glory
[40:43] especially mostly in the book of john at
[40:46] the end it's at the end he said it a
[40:48] couple of times but that's the end he's
[40:49] over over again saying to his disciples
[40:52] the hour has come for me to be glorified
[40:54] the hour has come for the father to
[40:55] glorify himself and me
[40:57] now just to be simple the glory here
[41:00] it means
[41:00] the splendor the radiance the
[41:03] distinguished quality
[41:04] and beauty of his character in other
[41:06] words everything that god is the
[41:08] splendor the radiance of god the
[41:10] distinguished not the miracles of god
[41:11] not the miracles and signs of god but
[41:14] the beauty of his character the splendor
[41:16] the highness the radiance that's the
[41:19] glory of god and that comes in that's
[41:21] beyond just having a bible and have a
[41:23] mechanical teaching
[41:26] we're not changed just because we have
[41:28] the intellect of the bible we're changed
[41:30] when the glory of god comes down
[41:33] it's the glory of god that changes us
[41:36] and so now the glory is the splendor the
[41:39] radiance and jesus points to the hour
[41:41] where he's coming where it's coming to
[41:42] him he says i have glorified your name
[41:45] on earth now is the
[41:47] now is the hour that the father
[41:48] glorifies in me i want you to notice
[41:51] it's at the end at the most dark time of
[41:55] jesus life he's forsaken he's betrayed
[41:59] he's alone he's scourged he's whipped
[42:03] and god's glory is setting in
[42:07] more than it ever has
[42:09] i think we can learn something
[42:12] that when we think it is our lowest
[42:14] darkest time
[42:17] that's when
[42:19] god gets the glory the most
[42:22] or he should
[42:25] see nobody's seen that it's going on in
[42:27] jesus
[42:28] and at his darkest time he says the hour
[42:31] has come
[42:35] betrayed alone nobody his darkest
[42:38] weakest hour
[42:39] and that's when he proclaims but the
[42:41] hours come
[42:43] that the father is going to glorify
[42:44] himself in me
[42:46] i've glorified his name
[42:48] i've glorified him in earth and now he's
[42:50] going to come and glorify me and some
[42:51] people think well that was when he was
[42:53] resurrected in his new body because the
[42:54] bible does say brother paul that he
[42:56] hadn't descended yet don't touch me
[42:58] because he had an ascending yet in the
[42:59] holy ghost the holy ghost hadn't come
[43:01] yet because he was not glorified yet the
[43:02] bible says he wasn't glorified well yeah
[43:04] that's that's the glorified of his
[43:06] glorified body that's the ending of it
[43:08] but i hear scriptures that show that the
[43:10] glory of god is already upon him and the
[43:12] glory of god is coming more and more at
[43:15] his darkest hour
[43:17] why is that because
[43:20] because god
[43:22] likes to get the glory and god likes to
[43:24] bring more glory to you as you're
[43:26] suffering through something that nobody
[43:28] else sees if your heart is obedient
[43:31] saying lord i yield to you i yield to
[43:33] you through this suffering i've been
[43:35] mistreated but i'm yielding myself to
[43:37] you that's the character in radiance
[43:42] that's the glory nobody sees
[43:51] i believe it's because the characters
[43:53] express
[43:56] because it should have been a different
[43:57] reaction of how people were treating him
[43:59] he should have reacted different he
[44:00] should have left he should have been
[44:01] finished but he has really moved into
[44:03] deeper oneness with god this is the
[44:06] expression of his glory his glory
[44:08] brings deeper oneness
[44:11] relationships his glory brings deeper
[44:13] oneness everybody awake here
[44:17] it wasn't a doctrine
[44:19] it wasn't just a bible
[44:20] it's the glory of god and is expressing
[44:22] i find no place there at the end where
[44:25] there's only one or two places that he
[44:26] goes into the temple and he opens the
[44:27] book and he reads the scroll at the last
[44:31] all scripture is being fulfilled but he
[44:32] doesn't have a bible there
[44:34] the glory of god is is manifesting
[44:37] himself through him and he's glorious
[44:39] he's
[44:40] he's glorifying the father's name he's
[44:42] glorifying him and god is coming that to
[44:45] the glory of god is there and there's no
[44:47] bible there there's no doctrine there
[44:49] it's the glory of god expressing in him
[44:51] and in 17 2 he said he has in 17
[44:56] john 17 2 as thou has given him power
[44:58] over all flesh that he should give
[45:00] eternal life to as many as thou has
[45:01] given him it says he has power over all
[45:04] flesh it's not controlling him he's
[45:07] controlling what's happening because of
[45:09] the glory of god to give power to give
[45:11] eternal life to others listen he's the
[45:13] glory of god causes him to control
[45:15] what's going on rather than it
[45:18] controlling him
[45:21] that's where i want to live
[45:25] it's only by the glory of god not
[45:27] through psychology in the 10 steps to
[45:29] perfection
[45:32] it's when the glory of god comes is that
[45:33] we react different to something
[45:36] amen
[45:41] we know we he received power to raise
[45:43] the dead raised from the dead we all
[45:44] know he was crowned with glory the bible
[45:46] says he was crowned with glory he was
[45:47] given a glorified body but notice he has
[45:49] come into the glory before that we think
[45:51] of glory in different ways
[45:53] but at the end at rapture time that's
[45:54] that's we think of that it's going to be
[45:56] raptured that's from the glory of god
[45:57] that's but god likes to express his
[45:59] glory inside of you when you get a new
[46:02] body according to the scripture you'll
[46:03] think man that's when the glory of god
[46:05] is completely taken over that's when i'm
[46:07] going to have the glory of god but i
[46:08] want to let you know the glory of god
[46:09] expressed is expressed before that in
[46:12] the darkest times
[46:14] that's when he really expresses let me
[46:16] say it to this way another way to
[46:17] explain it to you now we have jesus come
[46:20] as a virgin born human being but virgin
[46:22] born so he didn't have any sin can you
[46:24] say amen so god comes to think my isn't
[46:26] that wonderful to see god in a in a
[46:28] virgin born body expressing god's
[46:30] fullness coming a virgin born body well
[46:32] we think why the glory of god in that
[46:34] but even greater glory is when god would
[46:37] come and bring his presence in a
[46:39] sin-born body like yours
[46:44] could i safely say that there could be
[46:46] more glory in the church than even jesus
[46:50] christ when he was on earth
[46:52] because that was the virgin born body
[46:54] your sin born and god's glory comes by
[46:56] the holy ghost
[46:58] changes your desires and raises you up
[47:01] [Applause]
[47:04] that's not belittling jesus christ
[47:05] because it's the same jesus christ in
[47:07] you but which has more glory in a virgin
[47:10] born body or in a sinborn body
[47:14] god
[47:15] likes to get glory
[47:17] out of broken
[47:19] people
[47:20] broken things
[47:22] last sunday i said the last call he said
[47:25] send him to the wedding feast and all
[47:26] the normal people got invited and they
[47:28] begin to make excuses saying i bought a
[47:30] cow i bought a wife and i haven't bought
[47:32] a wife i've married a wife
[47:34] i bought i bought a
[47:36] i got a piece of land and they made an
[47:37] excuse that i can't come i can't come
[47:39] i'm busy i'm busy i can't come so he
[47:41] said all right go go get the lame the
[47:42] halt the healing revival those that are
[47:44] sick
[47:45] and then when all those come he said i
[47:47] still have room go out on the highways
[47:48] and hedges and compel them to come in
[47:51] and the prophet comments and he says
[47:53] he says the good
[47:55] the bad and the indifferent
[47:58] the last call is the good the bad and
[48:00] the indifferent that's why i asked you
[48:01] last sunday what are you going to do if
[48:02] these seats fill up with the good the
[48:04] bad and the indifferent and you're
[48:05] looking over saying
[48:07] that's a lot of tattoos buddy
[48:11] it's interesting how people religious
[48:13] people sometimes will react
[48:16] well she needs to she needs to do this
[48:18] she needs to dress better she needs to
[48:19] do that
[48:22] she's not allowed to do that because i'm
[48:23] not allowed to do it come on you see if
[48:26] you're asking that question i have a
[48:27] problem with your experience
[48:29] i want to do my hair her that way if she
[48:32] gets to do that i want to do it you have
[48:33] a problem you don't understand what
[48:34] you're doing and what you're why we
[48:36] dress the way with you
[48:38] but when you can sit when you can sit
[48:40] there dressing modest like your the word
[48:43] says to do and you've got 300 other
[48:45] people that aren't dressing modest
[48:47] beside you now trust me i'm not going to
[48:49] let somebody in here is just wearing a
[48:50] bikini
[48:54] but
[48:55] when you can you you if you know where
[48:57] you stand you can sit next to and love
[48:59] and pray someone through the holy ghost
[49:01] with all of them sitting next to you
[49:03] that way because you know where you
[49:04] stand if you don't know where you stand
[49:06] you're going to be influenced by them oh
[49:08] it's okay yeah we can't you know we kind
[49:10] of
[49:11] we're kind of loose on those things no
[49:12] we're not right
[49:14] we preach it like the bible says it
[49:16] the word modesty came from the bible
[49:19] it has a meaning
[49:20] and this is because a lot of churches
[49:22] have dumped it out we don't dump it out
[49:24] it's in the bible
[49:27] but what you wear is not quite as much
[49:30] the emphasis is your relationship with
[49:32] god
[49:34] and i'm here to tell you that we have to
[49:36] come into oneness by the glory of god
[49:39] not by doctrine i've got to get to
[49:40] something here and i'm doing good at 12
[49:42] 30. i've got to get to something real
[49:44] important at the end here so then in our
[49:45] text he says they will have the same
[49:47] glory it will bring the same oneness we
[49:50] i pray that they will be one with us
[49:53] like we are one and i pray that they
[49:55] will be one with one another like we
[49:57] have oneness that's jesus prayer how
[50:00] many would agree with the word to say i
[50:01] don't know how we're gonna get there but
[50:03] there's gonna be oneness in the true
[50:04] church of god
[50:06] thank you for about five hands raised
[50:08] praise the lord
[50:09] amen if we can get more of you believing
[50:10] that that he's going to answer his
[50:12] prayer
[50:13] and god's going to break down your walls
[50:15] and then you're going to stop putting
[50:16] people into categories
[50:18] and stop holding grudges towards people
[50:21] and forgive people
[50:22] and realize that that person who has the
[50:25] holy ghost you may not like their
[50:26] personality but if they've got the
[50:28] spirit of god in him they are your true
[50:30] spirit brother even more than your
[50:33] physical family
[50:39] i know some people didn't like that
[50:41] but this
[50:43] this relationship is closer
[50:46] than your physical family
[50:48] oh boy
[50:50] i love my family i love my granddaughter
[50:52] back there i love my children i love my
[50:54] wife
[50:55] we are close by blood can you say man
[50:59] but the bible says
[51:02] there is a friend
[51:03] first of all it says
[51:05] he that has friends must show himself
[51:07] friendly and that actually it means that
[51:09] he that has a lot of friends
[51:12] he has to show himself friendly that's
[51:14] actually what that means
[51:16] and he's real popular because he's got a
[51:17] lot of friends
[51:19] then it says but there is a friend
[51:23] that sticketh closer
[51:25] than a brother
[51:28] we've always preached that as jesus
[51:29] christ but what he's really saying
[51:31] is that
[51:33] there is a level
[51:34] of closeness and relationship
[51:38] in the kingdom of god by the holy ghost
[51:40] that goes beyond
[51:43] a physical blood relationship
[51:46] with family
[51:50] [Music]
[51:53] amen
[51:58] i was looking for a place to get out
[52:00] here go out the back door
[52:08] bible says there's a friend you can have
[52:09] a friend
[52:11] that would actually be closer than blood
[52:13] relation
[52:15] how does that
[52:16] happen through the blood and the spirit
[52:18] of god
[52:20] i got family members today i love them
[52:23] there's no lack of love in them
[52:24] whatsoever but we have there's no
[52:26] fellowship about there's hardly any
[52:29] fellowship we try to find common ground
[52:31] and i find it and i talk about it
[52:33] but because of the holy spirit in my
[52:35] life you can only go so far
[52:38] but i can sit down with a brother jason
[52:40] or brother kyle or i can sit down with
[52:42] some of you and sisters even i can sit
[52:44] down boy we can have
[52:46] some connection
[52:56] john 20 excuse me
[52:58] uh look at this one john 21 18 and 19.
[53:06] rarely very i say unto you i'm doing
[53:08] good it's only 12 37.
[53:11] barely i say to you when thou s young
[53:13] he's talking to peter at the end here
[53:14] and that's one though girders thyself
[53:16] and walk us wither thou wouldest but
[53:17] when thou shalt be old thou shalt stress
[53:19] forth thy hands and anoth another shall
[53:20] worthy and carry thee without wither
[53:23] thou wouldest not
[53:24] so he's saying peter
[53:26] you're young
[53:27] you still got that
[53:29] attitude in you i'm going to do what i
[53:31] want to do and that's a lot of times in
[53:32] young people i'm going to do my own
[53:33] thing
[53:35] and jesus is saying i know you that way
[53:37] now it's fine you're still my son
[53:39] but i'm going to beat all that out of
[53:40] you and someday they'll actually come
[53:42] and take you and take you where you
[53:43] don't want to go
[53:44] verse 19. this spake he's signifying by
[53:46] what death he should glorify god
[53:50] so he's foretelling how peter's going to
[53:52] die
[53:53] you're going to give your life for the
[53:55] gospel but look how he words it
[53:57] this speak he's thinking by what death
[53:59] he should glorify god
[54:02] really
[54:04] peter's death
[54:06] is going to glorify god we don't think
[54:08] about the glory of god that way
[54:11] but his death
[54:13] is going to glorify god now there's a
[54:14] lot of people who die
[54:15] but i want to die and my death glorifies
[54:18] god
[54:20] we never think of the glory of god in
[54:21] that here's another one uh in first no
[54:24] here's another one in john 9 1-3
[54:29] i know it's a lot to chew on today
[54:32] john 9 went through the but i got to get
[54:33] to this one i mean two scriptures
[54:35] and then i got to get this one spot
[54:37] about the garden and then i'm going to
[54:39] end
[54:39] john
[54:43] i know i know that i can finish this
[54:45] next sunday i now have about
[54:48] you know 30 more sundays this year and
[54:50] you're probably saying he's got 30 more
[54:52] sundays split it up dude
[54:57] but it's so much funnier to get to it
[54:58] right now
[55:00] it's just better
[55:03] look at this john 9 1 3 and jesus passed
[55:06] by he saw a man that was blind from his
[55:07] birth and his disciples asked him saying
[55:09] master who did sin this man or his
[55:12] parents that he was born blind jesus
[55:14] answered neither have this man's sin nor
[55:16] his parents but that the works of god
[55:17] should be manifest in him did you hear
[55:19] this man was blind from his birth and
[55:21] they're trying to come up with reasons
[55:22] and blame why has this man this is
[55:25] unfair god's unfair there's somebody to
[55:27] blame jesus is it his parents is it him
[55:30] did he sin we always think of we're
[55:31] trying to look for somebody to blame and
[55:33] jesus is saying there's some things that
[55:35] happen even a kid that's blind from
[55:37] birth and then he gets to be 30 40 years
[55:39] old jesus passes his way and he's went
[55:42] 30 40 years completely by buying from
[55:44] his birth how is that fair i'll tell you
[55:46] how it's fair because god's waiting to
[55:48] bring glory to himself when he's 40
[55:50] years old
[55:51] and that's not the way we function but
[55:53] that's the way god functions i might
[55:55] wait their whole life to heal them of
[55:57] that cancer i may wait years because i
[55:59] know the time that i'm going to get
[56:01] glory to my name out of that miracle
[56:04] we've got to look at the glory of god
[56:06] right that the glory of god was waiting
[56:08] for him to be mentioned look at that i
[56:10] want you to notice him they're trying to
[56:12] find some problem with the parents that
[56:14] this is caused by and i'm going to make
[56:16] a point to you when i talk about
[56:18] relationship the next few weeks if god
[56:19] gives me liberty
[56:20] we can't go our whole life
[56:23] we can't go our whole life
[56:26] holding our parents responsible
[56:35] not when we know about the glory of god
[56:40] jesus neither hath this man's sin nor
[56:43] his parents but that the works of god
[56:45] should be manifest let god do it his way
[56:48] you can't blame your parents the rest of
[56:50] your life
[56:52] no matter how dastardly they were
[56:57] you can never go on
[56:59] in the glory of god
[57:01] if you keep looking for the blame
[57:06] somebody
[57:07] say amen
[57:08] i'm teaching about relationships
[57:11] and i'm going to end this right now in
[57:13] the garden of eden how many believe it's
[57:15] a perfect oneness
[57:17] before the fall
[57:19] they were of the same image
[57:21] and they were the same nature of god
[57:23] they were made in the image of god and
[57:24] guess what one with him one with god
[57:28] because they had the same nature that's
[57:29] the way we see it in the bible there's
[57:31] only a way that could be perfectly one
[57:33] with god is they had to have the same
[57:34] nature in them of god
[57:36] adam and eve had it
[57:38] the only way to have perfect oneness is
[57:40] be of the same nature
[57:44] they were the same as nature of god one
[57:46] with him because of the same nature and
[57:48] their name the bible says was adam this
[57:50] is before eve was separated their name
[57:53] was adam he created in the image adam
[57:56] and eve
[57:57] and he he created he them so adam and
[58:01] eve were both in this
[58:04] atom
[58:05] they were one that's why he could say
[58:07] they were one that's why they were one
[58:08] with god but also they were so one that
[58:10] they were that that masculine feminine
[58:13] was
[58:14] one it was later that god separated i'm
[58:15] going to talk about that but notice now
[58:18] and i hope can you give me can you give
[58:21] me 10 more minutes here
[58:23] all right and i'll do my best we'll wrap
[58:25] it up but this is so crucial about
[58:27] relationships
[58:30] adam and eve were the same nature of god
[58:32] and they were one their name was adam
[58:34] they were not two separate vessels until
[58:37] genesis
[58:39] 2
[58:40] where god
[58:42] uh
[58:43] takes a rib out of adam and he separates
[58:45] them okay and he makes them two
[58:47] different vessels
[58:49] but in spirit they have to say they're
[58:52] still one
[58:54] because they come off of god that way
[58:56] that they were once so even though now
[58:58] god separates now we know satan in
[59:00] genesis 3 he separates man from god he
[59:03] separates eve from adam satan's
[59:05] separation is detrimental he causes her
[59:08] to leave the word and when she left the
[59:10] word she lost everything they lost the
[59:12] glory of god they lost their
[59:13] relationship with god they lost
[59:15] relationship with one another they lost
[59:17] everything it's because satan separated
[59:18] them
[59:20] from the word
[59:21] and when you separate from the word you
[59:23] separate relationships
[59:25] can i get an amen
[59:27] when you separate from the word you
[59:29] separate from relationship with god and
[59:31] you separate in relationship with one
[59:32] another your relationships can never be
[59:34] right until your relationship with god
[59:36] is right and your relationship with god
[59:38] can never be right when you leave the
[59:39] word amen
[59:41] but before they were separated by satan
[59:44] god actually believe it or not now god
[59:46] he in his great plan
[59:49] he takes this adam and eve who were
[59:51] together and one spirit okay if you want
[59:54] to call it that one spirit
[59:56] and he puts them in vessels he breathes
[59:58] life into a vessel so now we can
[1:00:00] actually see something that's similar to
[1:00:02] the animal kingdom and the prophet said
[1:00:04] the reason why
[1:00:06] he made them kind of look like animal a
[1:00:08] little bit because they were going to
[1:00:09] rule over the animals before that they
[1:00:11] didn't have a bodily form so he makes a
[1:00:13] bodily form that kind of is similar to
[1:00:14] the animal kingdom although they're not
[1:00:16] they're made in the image of god still
[1:00:18] they're one with god but he make them
[1:00:19] because they're going to rule the animal
[1:00:21] king they're going to rule over the
[1:00:22] earth so now these vessels kind of look
[1:00:24] like a little bit that way
[1:00:26] and yet they're not because the
[1:00:28] difference in adam and eve is they had a
[1:00:30] soul
[1:00:32] dogs don't have a soul
[1:00:37] sherry i'm sorry
[1:00:40] god bless your dog business
[1:00:43] may god prosper it in every way
[1:00:46] don't pay tithes on it you're not
[1:00:47] allowed by scripture
[1:00:49] god bless your dog business
[1:00:52] but dogs don't have a soul
[1:00:55] they're getting rights like i've never
[1:00:57] seen before though
[1:00:59] ah they're everywhere i want to sit in a
[1:01:02] restaurant and they're sitting on my
[1:01:03] chair in the restaurant
[1:01:05] this preacher has a problem with dogs
[1:01:09] how far is this gonna go
[1:01:12] are we gonna have
[1:01:14] like our kids to protect are we gonna
[1:01:15] have
[1:01:17] dog seats in our car like we have child
[1:01:20] seats okay i just wondering
[1:01:26] so god takes and he separates
[1:01:29] all right
[1:01:32] and so they had a season there i don't
[1:01:33] know how long it was they had a season
[1:01:35] where they lived in two vessels
[1:01:38] where god took the feminine part out of
[1:01:40] man how many believe god created both
[1:01:42] the mask and feminine part
[1:01:45] and then god god separated them
[1:01:48] hello news flash to the world
[1:01:52] god created them not you
[1:01:55] and he made them masculine and feminine
[1:01:58] distinct from one another
[1:02:00] and he actually separated them into two
[1:02:02] different vessels
[1:02:04] never to be blended back again at least
[1:02:07] physically
[1:02:09] never to decide against an arrogance
[1:02:12] towards god say i don't care what god
[1:02:13] created me i don't care i'm what i
[1:02:16] choose to be what an insult to god
[1:02:19] but he took him and he separated he put
[1:02:21] the masculine in one vessel the feminine
[1:02:23] another vessel
[1:02:24] and for a season before the fall they
[1:02:27] had to go with now observing one another
[1:02:30] with the feminine side
[1:02:32] in her and the masculine side in him and
[1:02:35] yet
[1:02:36] yet
[1:02:38] they had to hold they held
[1:02:41] i'm one with her
[1:02:44] nothing's broke the oneness
[1:02:45] even though they had to start observing
[1:02:47] the difference in what that looks like
[1:02:50] with the feminine side being separate
[1:02:52] from the man
[1:02:55] and so now god put them in two vessels
[1:02:58] it's the first time we get to see two
[1:03:00] aspects feminine and masculine
[1:03:03] and they were different how many were
[1:03:05] raised around their different aspects
[1:03:08] but yet
[1:03:10] they're one
[1:03:14] still of the same spirit but different
[1:03:16] aspects
[1:03:17] that were one and the that's because the
[1:03:20] glory of god was still on them this is
[1:03:22] before the fall the glory of god's on
[1:03:24] them we're one and so this these
[1:03:26] sweethearts begin to function now not as
[1:03:29] before begin to function with two
[1:03:31] different vessels there loving one
[1:03:33] another in one with god fellowshipping
[1:03:34] with god no hindrance no walls up
[1:03:36] between one another but you gotta think
[1:03:39] you know you wonder if eve was sitting
[1:03:40] there one day
[1:03:42] and this is after god separating them
[1:03:43] and he's leaves looking over at all the
[1:03:46] gardens and she says maybe adam
[1:03:49] aren't those
[1:03:51] aren't those flowers
[1:03:53] just so
[1:03:54] beautiful
[1:03:55] and she starts to cry
[1:04:00] i'm just overwhelmed
[1:04:02] by how beautiful adam adam look adam
[1:04:06] adam
[1:04:11] look it just moves in tears
[1:04:15] how beautiful
[1:04:17] she just breaks down and she just she's
[1:04:19] a mess
[1:04:23] and
[1:04:24] maybe that's the first time adam's he's
[1:04:26] not crying
[1:04:33] yes yeah they're beautiful dear
[1:04:36] and he's kind of wondering
[1:04:37] but why is she crying about it
[1:04:48] what do you think are they honey
[1:04:50] sweetheart they are beautiful but look
[1:04:52] at that deer over there
[1:04:57] look at that buck
[1:04:59] have you counted how many
[1:05:03] and then she kind of
[1:05:06] you're looking at the deer
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:09] these flowers here
[1:05:11] deer
[1:05:13] don't look at the deer deer
[1:05:17] there's no fighting there's no
[1:05:19] and and something's functioning between
[1:05:21] them as they begin to notice
[1:05:24] that those have been separated
[1:05:27] there's still
[1:05:28] this revelation and glory
[1:05:31] that says no matter how different
[1:05:34] we're still one
[1:05:42] he comes in one day and says i'm gonna
[1:05:44] go on with this for about two minutes he
[1:05:46] comes in says
[1:05:48] sweetheart
[1:05:50] she said sweetheart what'd you do today
[1:05:52] well i see i was out naming some more of
[1:05:54] the animals i found some more animals
[1:05:55] they hadn't been named yet and i was
[1:05:57] going out there and man you talk about
[1:05:58] some beautiful seen a whole herd of herd
[1:06:01] of something and i just named him elk i
[1:06:02] just said that's a herd of elk that's
[1:06:04] the way that should sound i'm naming all
[1:06:06] those animals and he said that's what i
[1:06:08] did he said sweetheart what'd you do
[1:06:09] today she said well i was out just
[1:06:11] gathering some herbs and brought them
[1:06:13] home and i was mixing them together and
[1:06:16] you know i kind of uh made something out
[1:06:19] of the herbs i made some new toothpaste
[1:06:21] that i want you to try
[1:06:26] because your breath is kind of and so i
[1:06:28] mix these herbs
[1:06:30] together it's it's a
[1:06:33] it's a new mlm that i just signed up for
[1:06:35] and i
[1:06:39] he says what's this in the room he said
[1:06:41] well that's that's some essential oils
[1:06:43] that's going in the machine
[1:06:45] we're going to breathe these in and
[1:06:48] it's not for healing because we're
[1:06:50] completely whole we never we don't know
[1:06:52] what sickness is but this is just going
[1:06:54] to make it's actually going to give us
[1:06:56] more
[1:06:58] energy
[1:07:03] and you know the man he's
[1:07:06] you know we're laughing friends and i'm
[1:07:08] i know i'm i'm out on a limb just a bit
[1:07:11] but they did have a season where there
[1:07:13] were two vessels with the masculine and
[1:07:15] feminine separated and six thousand
[1:07:17] years of history i got a list here i
[1:07:18] don't have time to read it now of about
[1:07:20] 200 differences in male and female
[1:07:26] don't sit there quiet on me
[1:07:35] one day adam says sweetie you know i
[1:07:37] love you so much i love you sweetie
[1:07:39] you're the only girl for me
[1:07:43] he says
[1:07:44] yeah that's right
[1:07:47] i am the only girl for you
[1:07:52] five months later she brings it up she
[1:07:54] said adam can i ask you a question why
[1:07:56] did you
[1:07:57] five months ago why did you say
[1:07:59] that you're that i'm the only one for
[1:08:01] you why did you say that and adam's
[1:08:03] going she remembers that
[1:08:06] because a woman's brain can remember
[1:08:08] stuff better than the masculine brain
[1:08:12] they're discovering all these things
[1:08:15] differences big time differences
[1:08:19] but
[1:08:21] but
[1:08:22] something else there is there's a love
[1:08:25] there's a glory
[1:08:27] now just go ahead and say it
[1:08:29] there's a love and there's a glory and
[1:08:31] there's a oneness
[1:08:32] that we are one
[1:08:34] that actually makes them look at one
[1:08:37] another and celebrate
[1:08:40] how god has made them
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:44] never use it for a division
[1:08:46] never use it for divorce
[1:08:51] never use it no
[1:08:53] sel they'd have to be by the oneness and
[1:08:55] love of god celebrating the uniqueness
[1:08:59] of how god has made because i know god's
[1:09:01] made her and i know she's a part of me
[1:09:04] she's just a different aspect of me
[1:09:08] i'm talking about relationships
[1:09:10] and i wonder if we find in there a key
[1:09:12] about how we look at one another
[1:09:15] if adam and eve would have looked at the
[1:09:17] flesh
[1:09:19] they would have lost their oneness
[1:09:23] i'm not looking at your flesh today
[1:09:26] i'm not going to judge you by your flesh
[1:09:29] i want to judge you by the love of god
[1:09:34] you have a different personality than me
[1:09:37] you probably think some of my jokes
[1:09:38] today were corny
[1:09:40] and you don't have to tell me that
[1:09:41] because my wife tells me all the time my
[1:09:43] children so dad please don't tell that
[1:09:45] joke again i know my jokes are corny i
[1:09:48] know that
[1:09:49] but guess what if we've been birthed by
[1:09:51] the holy ghost true holy ghost
[1:09:55] there's a oneness there's something that
[1:09:56] makes us look beyond the flesh
[1:09:59] and to say we
[1:10:01] are one
[1:10:04] by his spirit
[1:10:06] we
[1:10:07] are
[1:10:08] one can you say amen
[1:10:10] adam and eve had to see we're never
[1:10:12] dividing we're never making fun of these
[1:10:14] things we're only
[1:10:16] celebrating this special person god has
[1:10:19] made i am still one with him in spirit
[1:10:22] she's a part of me the glory of god
[1:10:24] brought oneness to never let the flesh
[1:10:26] divide them we're not looking at the
[1:10:28] flesh we're looking at the spirit of god
[1:10:32] that makes us one.
[1:10:35] praise be to god amen
[1:10:37] let's stand together
[1:10:43] and i just asked does anybody want us to
[1:10:45] continue in this
[1:10:47] uh subject of relationships would you
[1:10:49] want me to continue
[1:10:51] amen
[1:10:52] i'm going to be helped by it i know i've
[1:10:54] been helped already and i believe it's
[1:10:56] going to help some families and help
[1:10:57] some relationships in the church just be
[1:10:59] humble before the lord be honest before
[1:11:02] the lord
[1:11:03] don't be stubborn not to talk about
[1:11:06] certain things talk about it talk about
[1:11:08] it to the lord first talk about it if
[1:11:09] you're too uncomfortable talk to
[1:11:10] somebody else talk about the lord but be
[1:11:12] honest with god
[1:11:13] then get someone close to you and say
[1:11:15] we've got to start we've got to start
[1:11:17] talking about this
[1:11:18] i remember that service brother diggs
[1:11:20] was here that last service on confession
[1:11:22] the holy spirit just swept through that
[1:11:24] place and there was such there was a few
[1:11:26] families very affected because it was
[1:11:28] such a call from the lord about being
[1:11:30] open honest confession to one another
[1:11:33] just that in itself begins to
[1:11:36] make the devil run
[1:11:38] breaks down walls
[1:11:40] we got a great message friends how many
[1:11:42] believe that
[1:11:43] and christ has broken down the middle
[1:11:45] walls of partition we have access to god
[1:11:48] and the
[1:11:49] the seals have been taken off of the
[1:11:51] book of life we are living in such
[1:11:53] wonderful times why can't it affect
[1:11:56] our
[1:11:57] love and affect our oneness and affect
[1:12:00] our relationship with others you say
[1:12:02] well that person is not responding to me
[1:12:03] i'm trying but you see now friends
[1:12:06] jesus love kept trying and kept holding
[1:12:08] steady
[1:12:11] you do your part to reach out in the
[1:12:12] greatest way you can and leave the rest
[1:12:15] up to god
[1:12:16] amen can we pray together lay your hands
[1:12:18] on one of their sisters on sisters
[1:12:19] brothers and brothers maybe husbands on
[1:12:21] wives
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:24] and let's pray together as they just
[1:12:25] play something quietly heavenly father
[1:12:28] we pray the same prayer and echo the
[1:12:30] same prayer that you prayed here two
[1:12:32] thousand years ago that they may be one
[1:12:35] as you and the father were one lord
[1:12:38] to understand it god it's just an
[1:12:40] amazing thing
[1:12:42] lord may it drop deep in the hearts of
[1:12:44] every person here this morning
[1:12:46] may you
[1:12:47] wash away our grudges and watch away
[1:12:49] wash away our unforgiveness
[1:12:51] may you wash away understandings that
[1:12:53] may not be perfectly based on the truth
[1:12:55] may you wash away our putting people in
[1:12:57] a category
[1:12:59] may you wash away our grittiness and our
[1:13:01] harshness lord
[1:13:03] may you wash away our trying to preach
[1:13:05] and teach against others
[1:13:07] but lord may we do as
[1:13:10] brother the prophet said to draw our
[1:13:12] circle bigger when somebody draws their
[1:13:14] little circle may we draw our circle
[1:13:16] that much bigger lord and include others
[1:13:18] into our lives and to impart eternal
[1:13:21] life to others because of your power in
[1:13:23] us lord when we see adam me going
[1:13:25] through that one spot there in that
[1:13:27] season before the fall
[1:13:29] lord how amazing it must have been to
[1:13:31] see the differences in one another
[1:13:33] and yet lord nothing ever brought them
[1:13:35] to the place of dividing it wouldn't the
[1:13:38] love of god wouldn't allow them to ever
[1:13:40] divide over that because they knew that
[1:13:42] they were one in god
[1:13:44] lord may we recognize other holy ghost
[1:13:47] people that we are one with them and
[1:13:49] it's not based upon flesh or personality
[1:13:52] but it's based upon the true holy ghost
[1:13:54] saying amen and believing the word of
[1:13:57] god for this age that's the criteria
[1:13:59] thank you father
[1:14:01] bless these hearts
[1:14:03] continue to help us to know you through
[1:14:04] this series on relationships lord and we
[1:14:07] give you the glory for it may your glory
[1:14:09] come more to us and change us we pray
[1:14:12] in jesus name amen
[1:14:16] i need him
[1:14:19] more than ever
