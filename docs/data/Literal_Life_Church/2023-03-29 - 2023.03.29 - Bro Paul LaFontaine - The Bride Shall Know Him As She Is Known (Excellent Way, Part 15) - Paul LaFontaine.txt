========================================

First Corinthians 13 12-13 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abide the faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen you may be seated tonight father bless the word as we administer to it Lord and just give to the people we pray that you'll bless each one and father we give our gift to you that could be a blessing to the people commit the service to you in Jesus name amen so tonight we're going to finish up what we were talking about Sunday and also finish up about 14 15 part Series in the excellent way in First Corinthians 13 and we're happy tonight to make the conclusion to that and tonight we want to talk on these last couple scriptures talked a little bit about it on Sunday but we want to finish in the word of God the theme at the end of first Corinthians 13 that Paul's bringing so tonight I want to title this the bride shall know him as she is known the bride shall know when I say shall know it's because there is a prophecy and it'll be this time that the bride shall know Christ the bride shall know him as she is known and so uh we'll just talk a little bit tonight and teach on the more practical side of it and bring out some things and then towards the end of the service we'll go into this prophecy of Paul saying that at that day he's saying now for we see through a glass in the first church age we see through a glass we see Christ through a glass but then face to face and so we know that that's a prophecy also he mentions it in verse 10 if you're looking when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away so that is a prophecy there'll be a coming day when that which is perfect will come and that that which is in part shall be done away I personally believe that there's enough Vindication to show that we're in that day when that which is perfect has come and I'm going to read something here in a moment from the prophet that's going to show that but before we get to that we just want to Echo what we said on Sunday about this knowing him face to face and the bride coming to know him in a face-to-face relay relationship and I'll just say it this way that if our vision of Christ is limited if we have a limited which Paul describes here as a dark glass or seeing through a glass Darkly seeing through a window that's faded or a window that doesn't give the full picture Christ is on the other side and it's not clear through the window because it's it's through a glass Darkly and that's the simplest way to explain that's how they looked through this glass Darkly to see Christ and when we look at them that way it's it's a wonderful thing but he says there'll become a day when we'll have a face-to-face relationship with Christ not through a glass Darkly can you say amen and so if our but here's the point if the if our vision of Christ is limited if we see through a glass Darkly then other things are limited and we have a partial revelation of Christ throughout the ages they had a partial Revelation and the the wonderful thing about the Believers in God who will have the Holy Ghost in every age they connected with what Christ was doing in that hour his word for that hour and when they connected with that they lived it they believed it with all their heart that even though it was a partial revelation of Christ they gave their all to it some of them gave their lives to it do you know that those Believers that were beheaded and given their lives for the gospel of Christ they did all that and sacrificed their life knowing very little of the of the character of Christ knowing very little of what we enjoy today of what Christ and yet they gave their lives for I'd say that if we know that this much of Christ in this hour and we're blessed with so much word revealed to us then we ought to give our all to it you got brothers and sisters you're going to shake hands with when you get on the other side and I'll tell you I'm going to feel humbled to be in front of them because they gave their lives and they only had a partial revelation of Christ they didn't know them like we're blessed to know him today but they gave their lives for they gave their all to it we should give our all to it can you say Amen a partial Revelation uh will tend to make our love partial as well as what we said Sunday a partial revelation will make our love partial and uh I want you to I want just to bring back some scriptures again related to the subject that partiality in the body of Christ shouldn't be there looking at one another and showing partiality with one another shouldn't be happening it happens in the world it happens in schools it happens in business can you say man their people are partial to different ones and they're they're partisan and all these other things but within the Holy Ghost kingdom of God the partiality should go away and we should look at one another through the eyes of Christ and we shouldn't just have favorites can you say amen and look down on other ones and try to judge each other but when we're looking through this glass and see Christ then he sees us without partiality so we should see one another that way so we have when we have a limited view in the face of Christ that we have a limited view then we're going to be limited in how this love comes out from us to others and that's the uh point that I was going to bring Sunday and so as Believers we cannot be partial in judgment or in our treatment of others we can't be partial in our treatment with others if you haven't learned anything from this uh excellent Way series you I would say if you learn it you you should learn this that we are to react to everyone in the love of Christ the same way and and the treatment of other people they deserve to be treated with the love of Christ and given the love of Christ and I'm not talking about compromising because you have to tell the truth love is rooted in truth but but when we're treating people wrong uh because we think they're less that doesn't belong in the body of Christ we should treat one you know hey everybody wants to be treated right how many rage yet I like to be treated right I'd like to be treated with respect and uh you know nobody likes to be abused whether it's mental or verbal or physical abuse uh sexual abuse that's a disrespect to the human being and so none of us like to be disrespected whether it's an attitude coming we like to be treated right and if there ever is a place that you see the treatment of one another with high respect and love and you may disagree but the the respect and the treatment of one another and and feelings and love for one another it should be resident Among Us and when it's not I would just say this safely when it's not happening somebody is not looking into the face of Christ correctly there's a there's a story that I remember a quick little story about Leonardo da Vinci uh DaVinci as he's painting the face of Christ and I've mentioned this before but there's a story that when he was painting the face of Christ on the the painting he was doing of the last supper and he was there and he was intently just working on the face of Christ and Leonardo he got angry at one of his servants and he lashed out at him he just lashed out he got outset they had done something wrong and so he pulled away from painting the face of Christ and he just got romantic lashed out at him and then he went back to and he and he he says he could not he was stumbling and and struggling to go back to painting the face of Christ he had trouble with it and he tried and he couldn't do it he tried he couldn't do it and there was too much evils just stirring within him and his anger and he had a lack of peace and that lack of peace made him throw down his brushes go and find that servant that boy and ask forgiveness from him just effective he could not paint the fate of face of Christ and have that feeling within him now that's just a natural thing it's just a natural story but I think it says something to us of what I'm trying to minister on that there's something about when we're when we're looking into him and looking at him through the word of God and we're keeping focused on him makes it very difficult to hate one another why because we're being changed into looking at the way Christ sees it so we can kind of tell in our lives when we're not in the face of Christ enough we've become affected so by so many other carnal things but when we're looking at them so he I just finished in the story he wouldn't ask forgiveness and and then only through asking forgiveness and prayer did Leonardo did he did he have an inner calm and settle down enough to go back to painting the face of Christ he settled down because he asked forgiveness hello he asked forgiveness and he he went to prayer and that's the type of things that relieves anger that's the type of things that relieves and so he did that and then he could calm down in order in order to go back and paint the face of Christ I think it says something to us and so uh you know I mentioned a couple scriptures I want to bring him up again tonight if they want to bring him first Timothy 5 19 says against it in this whole partiality thing and showing us it's not it doesn't belong Among Us within the church church people and Believers First Timothy 5 19 against an elder receive not an accusation Nation but before two or three Witnesses so it's very important that Among Us that we be careful when an accusation comes against an elder and for that matter for anybody that's a member of the body of Christ it's very important we don't just accept that and take it as truth and and so now notice the subject of partiality notice the subject of of waiting to see the whole picture of things not judging on partiality not judging on seeing it oh somebody made an accusation somebody gossip somebody put an elder down somebody put a pastor down somebody put an elder in the church down we are we are taught in the scripture we are not to receive that just like that but out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses or in other words we're waiting to see if it's the truth before we believe it that's maturity in the body of Christ you don't just accept gossip you know just to take it as the final Authority because that's being partial in your judgment and we're not supposed to be partial in our judgment we're not supposed to take half truths about somebody none of us like that about us being said about us so in maturity we're not taking half truths about what we hear but before two or three Witnesses it goes deeper when it says in verse 20 them that sin rebuke before all that others also May fear now that's a strong scripture and I've never heard too many uh pastors talk about it nevertheless it is in the scripture that Among Us them that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear I can't help but think it's in this same subject of partiality it's in the same subject we'll be real harsh on somebody here and somebody over here we won't be as harsh on and we have to be careful about partiality in our judgment here it says rebuke before all that others may feel or fear because all of us are under the same Holy Spirit and and the word is the same and so in that theme then he says verse 21 I charged thee before God and for the Lord Jesus and and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect Angels this is pretty serious that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality doesn't belong Among Us how many would just say that's that's good that's a good lesson for me that's the way it's supposed to function that you I say this before the elect angels and for the Lord Jesus Christ observe these things without preferring one before another without partiality and then it's echoed in again in James 2 verse 2 if you want to bring it up James 2 and verse 2 said my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect to persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with the gold ring in Goat goodly apparel and there come also a poor man in Vile Remnant he remit so in our day you know one comes in he's got all the rich clothes clothes on he he buys the very best he's got the very best of jewelry or she does and they're dressed for great maybe they're got a position in the in the in the county or in this or they're a mayor or something like that they're dressed good they drive drove the Mercedes in and then you got another guy gets out of his truck in overalls and he comes in and he stinks and he doesn't look that great and so our own human nature of this world is to judge them based upon those things we shouldn't do that and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing come on in and say unto him sit down here in a good place and give them the best place at the potluck and sit up close to the food and be the first in line and say to the poor stand back over here and sit here under my footstool are ye not then partial are you not not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts so it's it's related to now if we do not I'm getting back to seeing the face of Christ when we're looking at him then we see him the right way and his love flows through and the partiality is gone because why if we if we see him part impartial then we'll look at one another partially as I said Sunday he doesn't look up at us with a partial revelation aren't you glad he knows us fully and not only does he knows know our weakness and what we were born in our first birth actually he knows us in our new birth and he knows us there's some we're a Son of God from the foundation of the world does God see you does God know you God knows you God knows who you really are God knew who you really were before you knew who you really were and and so now that's why he can love you with a predestinated elective love because he knows he really knows who you really are and take people a lifetime to figure out who they are sometimes and they their identity crisis and trying to be everybody else young people do that when they're young they're trying to be everybody else and we're always preached to them find your identity in the word of God and actually by looking into the face of Christ in his word you find who you really are because it's a revealing it's a knowing this Christianity this this message is an identity that we get to know how God made us what he made us for why he sent us what he sent us here to do can you say this message is a revealing of our true identity and the true identity of Christ and who he really is it's a knowing relationship it's not putting something on the outside it's not changing who we are all the time it's not having complexes of who we are it's finding out solid I'm confident I know this is the way God made me I'm comfortable in my own skin and I'm going to give God glory in the way he made me because I am known of God I know God I am known of God He Knows My Name can you say amen he knows who I am and so I'm going to be who I am because I know who I am what an age of what an age of an identity crisis right down to the perversion of not even knowing whether you're a boy or girl anymore it's a it's a it's a Satan's attack on the identity even of a man and a woman what a perverted thing it's an identity crisis and yet in the word of God we are fearfully and wonderfully made who we are and individually we are known of God and when we know that we're known and he reveals to us who we are that he reveals to us who he is and we find our identity in him can you say Amen when God unveils who he is completely and we can look at him face to face then it brings this victory in Divine love flowing through you it brings this victory in Divine love looking into his face this face-to-face relationship this knowing him knowing us and US fully knowing him perfectly it brings us into this Victory Divine love that's why I conclude with this tonight that Paul is concluding the same way when we come in that day when that which is perfect has come we're looking perfectly into the face of Christ through his word it's a day of knowing it's a day of knowing who he is and it's a day of knowing Who We Are it's an unveiling it's a revealing it's it's not smearing on Christianity it's not living off the blessings of Christianity let me say this way it's not being just interested in Christ as The Giver it's being interested Christ himself the person and knowing that person how many want to know him tonight most people are happy with seeing what he does giving them a blessing his actions his miracles that he does observing from a distance but they don't want to give their heart and they don't want any relationship with him but when we're called to this this end time it's not any more about a partial relationship with him it's about knowing him intimately in a relationship that's why saying Falling In Love With Jesus that's why I'm saying I keep falling in love with him because this is not a religion this is a love relationship with Christ can you say Amen this is an everyday falling deeper in love with him I'm falling in love knowing as I get to know him more I fall in love with him more that's a true relationship in marriage too they start courtship and they start dating a courtship and so you know what it's about getting to know one another and so if you get to know one another and there's no love there's just like I'm backing off but you keep if you keep getting together and you know them more you keep falling in love with who they are and they're falling in love with you that's the way it is with Christ the more I get to know him the more I fall in love with him amen and so let me just say it this way how we're living day by day comes down to what we're looking at you can't separate it how we're living day by day in our house and in our lives comes back to what we're looking at most the time how you react to Life's troubles depends on this one thing what are you looking at what are you beholding what are you beholding in your life what are you looking at and if it's very little of this word in your life then you will not be able to react to life circumstances the right way but there's a power there's a power there's a transformation it just does it because God said in my in the gospel is power I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power unto salvation it does something when we keep our eyes beholding the word of God we see him can you say amen and and you don't have to work up the power you don't have to work up the transformation he just says keep beholding me keep looking at me and all the power to live to react to give love to to have wisdom in every situation it comes out of looking into his face and we look at it and it's hard to come out of prayer and come out of looking at his face it's hard to have ill feelings towards somebody when you're in that atmosphere of looking at him just like Leonardo just like it was hard to stay ill in his in his heart come into in front of the face of Christ that was just a picture I'll tell you when we're we got we're always looking at this there's a power that changes us we look at life different how you react to troubles depends on what you're looking at your Victory as a Christian is what you're mostly looking at in your life if he is here and has appeared before us in this hour then we can see him clearly it brings the result of a constant change from glory to glory to glory we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord because the glory of God is in the word of God and I'm not just talking about just our Bible it's the word it's the word of power but it starts by reading your Bible it starts by getting into it it's staying in front of it it's saying in the message it's it's staying in the word of God it's not the technical Written Letter on here it's what we're looking at in his character and when we keep looking at and beholding it because James brings up that thing about someone who's not a doer of the word and just to hear is the one that looks in a glass quickly and walks away but somebody who looks in a mirror and stays there and keeps looking and keeps looking he starts to see the flaw and becomes a doer of the word and not a hearer only how many members how many remembers that scripture in James so we are in his appearing now where his we're looking for his coming but we're in his appearing now he has appeared he is revealing his glory that which is perfect has come we just need to keep looking at it and be holding it and gazing upon it and Americans and American believers stop stop being so distracted by so many things and beholding everything else if you behold the news every day you're going to be pretty weak and pretty scared if you're beholding social media most the time you're going to be insecure you're going to be scared you're going to be buying into all different things of the world wisdom of this world what do you beholding uh you know right to the worst perverted things and looking at women and men on there if you're beholding that you're not going to survive it unless you pull out and say God take that from my life you're going to be affected by it every day your mind everything your heart try to come to church after feeding on that stuff say why do I feel so disconnected why because you're looking at the wrong thing you got to be beholding Christ most of the time we have to look at our computers we have to look at work we have to do our work of course we do but what I'm talking about is what are we be holding most of the time and if it's hardly any time in the word or in the message we're not going to be looking into the face of Christ enough we're going to be scared we're going to be insecure we're going to be jumping into all kinds of ideas of what's pretty and what looks good and what what what's what's accepted in this world and how I need to be accepted and how I need to be successful and it's all in what we're looking at makes us who we are and if we're barely looking into the word of God we're barely looking at it and not beholding that all the time we're going to be suffering spiritually and that's just the truth and we're not going to be able to offer this and come into this Divine love the way that we should so what we're looking at is that's that's what it is all about it comes down to what we're looking at most the time comes down to what we're beholding all the time even if it's not a computer it's just looking at one another we're not supposed to just constantly look and judge each other and nitpick one another and no it's discouraging sometimes to just keep looking at that but if we're looking and beholding him then we look at one another and we see each other the right way Grace comes Mercy comes uh balance comes can you say Amen so that's just a practical way of looking at it in our lives that what we're beholding is is has a power upon us and incidentally the word has power on us but the worldly the worldly things we're beholding has a power that goes with it but that's not the power you want in your life that is not the power you want working in your life a sway comes in when when Paul was talking about I have certain Liberties to do and if I have those Liberties I wouldn't do it to offend someone else and he says all things are lawful for me but not all things are expedient I know things are beneficial so there was things that you could do as a Christian he said I can do them I have Liberty to do them but it's not expedient for me to do them so I make a decision in in maturity to do to do that but he said there's one thing I will not be brought under the power of any of those things that's the key so obviously with those things there's a power that goes with it and so I will not be brought under the power of anything except the power of Christ we come into the power and love of Christ when we're beholding him when we're looking at his word where we're looking into him if we have very little time in that then we may come under the power of the Fashions of this world we might come under the power of somebody's uh Gossip of us we might come under the discouragement that somebody has put us down or abused us or said something wrong and there's a power goes with it that binds you and Paul said I will not be brought under the power of any of these things but I want to be under the power of one thing beholding Christ the power of the Holy Ghost the power of His word the power of his love manifested in my life can I get an amen tonight there's only one power I want controlling and leading my life and and guiding my life and that's the power of His Holy Spirit and his love working in me I won't be under the power of anything but so easily we get under the power of something else we get depressed by something else there's a power that goes with it and so we want to be under that so I'm going to switch down talk about this prophecy and I've been mentioning it that that when we get to the end time that which is perfect is come that which is perfect is come so Paul ends this with a prophecy that the bride of Christ of the last days shall see him and Behold Him clearly crystal clear through the word being revealed and his appearing through the word being revealed to us she this bride will Behold Him in a clear way and not through a glass Darkly let me say this respectfully dreams prophecies healings it's through a glass Darkly but it may not be knowing him this is a knowing relationship this is a knowing him relationship so dreams sometimes dreams are of the Lord sometimes they're not and if people want to follow every dream that they have I wouldn't follow hardly any of my dreams people get caught up in that in this stream and district and they're trying to interpret it be careful be careful because unless you're someone who really has a gift there to interpret it uh you you could go way off track and guess what you're doing you're seeing through a glass Darkly you're holding on to something that's it's a it's a partial trying to see what's coming and trying to see what's in your life and you know the thing is about the mystery of his will and that's what the Bible calls the mystery of his will you know his will is a mystery there's only one way to find his will is to look in his word because his word is his will I'm trying to find his will so you're looking maybe I'll give you a get I'll get a dream or something like that and and God does speak to but if you're only depending on a dream it's it's seeing through a glass Darkly there's a more sure word of Prophecy there's a there's a there's a a way the Lord can speak to you and drop it in your heart this is the will of God young people say well what do I do what career do I have and I don't know I wish the Lord would tell me to just be an engineer and God may do that God can do that he can impress upon your heart what to do but if it's the details of what who do I marry and all these other things you know I say to people his will is in the word of God so get in the word stay in the word and out of that that's his will for this hour that's his achievement for this hour what does what is God's will that he wants to achieve for this hour right now what is God's will right now what am I to be doing as a Christian in this hour and you find that in the word and you position yourself there then out of that he'll lead your heart to what job you should be having so what person to marry see it all comes back to beholding his word stay in the word and you're going to be winging it if you're out of his word and you've got to make big decisions in life and you're not saying in this word you're going to be winging it you found the fly it's off the cuff and I think vaguely I don't really have sure about this but I'm standing at the altar marrying this girl but I don't have full faith of it you can't do that you got to know where you stand you got to know it's his will can you say Matt to walk as solid as we can walk and there's nothing more solid in this world than beholding the word of God constantly everything comes out of staying in this word and beholding it look at God what's next for me I'll tell you I am so excited about what's next for me God what do you have to speak next to me what's next for the congregation what's the next series what's the next thing you want to say to us I'm excited when I look every morning in the word of God and I read it I'm excited about it because over and over again there's just this little trigger in my heart and I see a little scripture said there it is right there that's what I've been wondering about and that answers it if I hadn't been reading or stayed in that I may not have got that answer praise the Lord so dreams and prophecies that's through glass Darkly but she the bride will come into knowing him as he knows her he reveals himself and he reveals who she is too why it's a day of knowing he he is revealing who you are and he's revealing who he is that's the hour at that day Jesus said you'll know I'm in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me you'll know what kind of Oneness is happening because I'm gonna I'm gonna appear to you and I'm gonna reveal this oh plan to you I'm going to break open all this to you I'm not going to be partial I'm not I'm not going to be uh uh uh seeing you're not going to see me through a glass Darkly anymore but you're going to look at to me in a relationship that's face to face and thus you're going to know me and I'm going to know you there's nothing here and it's a relationship can you say Amen praise the Lord he reveals himself and he reveals who she is too it's a knowing time it's knowing him why is it important to see it because we tend to sometimes look back into a partial vision of Christ and reach back to Luther's day or Wesley's day or Pentecostal day and we we if you don't think people do this they'll they'll default back to that that Revelation which is a partial revelation of Christ if you have a minister and he comes to the light of this hour but he hangs on to his tradition he was a Lutheran Pastor or he was a Wesleyan Pastor which is under sanctification it's the restoration of sanctification or he was a Luther the justification reveal and or he came out of Pentecost you will find that if they don't Purge themselves of a life of just partial Revelation they'll they'll default back to their because you know in in the word we have today we're waiting for this to come to perfection in the bride we're looking at a perfect word but we're waiting for it to come to Perfection and how he's going to interpret it and people like to interpret it this is the bride's Revival so when we get nervous trying to interpret what's next what's next what's coming What's tomorrow what's next week in that we have an anticipation which I love that I'm excited about it but don't try to interpret what God's going to do and what brothers do sometimes they're in their nervousness they reach back and say well that worked back in Pentecost so I'm going to bring that forward and try to make that work but you're reaching back into a partial revelation of Christ when we've seen through a glass of Pentecost seen through a glass Darkly we don't want to reach back we want to go forward we want to take all that restoration right Gideon we want to take all of that restoration of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and we want to take all those truths that were there not the traditions amen when I when I put my hand to my ear it means you need to say Amen we want to take the traditions of those because every one of those eras have traditions no no we don't want the Traditions but the kernel of truth of those things will take it with us and go on with the word but oh most of the church world and many times in our own ranks there's such an influence coming from the past that influences to where you have a a starchy Church reading quotes with no moving of the spirit when I was a kid I went to some churches that were preaching the message it was like being in a Catholic Church and then my dad would come in and break the whole thing up and make everybody make everybody laugh and then bring the word in there and start a Revival in that place the spirit of God start to move that's I observed it as a kid wow there's no life here can you imagine but it's it if if you don't invite the Holy Spirit to do what he wants to do and move on you become traditional with whatever you have can I get an amen you'll become traditional with whatever you have you'll become denominational with whatever you have and then you go into some environments and I don't mean to be critical but it's just a display exactly what's going on in the Pentecostal Traditions the same thing and so we're not reaching for those Traditions we're actually coming out of the traditions and I have something that says brother brother Brown said it this way he said he said this the seventh trumpet to Israel is the same as the seventh seal to us bringing us out of Pentecostal and World Traditions to the genuine atonement to the world of of the word genuine atonement of the word so when he brings us out he doesn't bring us out of the truths of that we bring the truth but we're we definitely have to come out of the traditions of those ages in order to move on and so now here's the prophecy we're coming out of partial Revelation and seeing through a glass Darkly to be holding in this appearing of the Lord the fullness of his Perfection of his character and who he is the why is he doing this in the last stage because he's going to marry a bride he's marrying a bride it's full disclosure that's why we do a little pre uh marital uh talking with young people because there needs to be full disclosure there needs to you need to know that person sometimes the counselor can help to get them know them more everything's got to be out because you don't you want to have faith when you stand there I I want to marry this person I marry and I'm going to care for all of their heart everything that they are I fall in love with and I'll care for their life their heart for the rest of their life there's going to be a union we're moving towards a union the same with the bride of Christ it's not going to be a dating relationship it's not going to be staying in according with today is the age of marriage with Christ intimacy with Christ it's a relationship can you say man it's not and how much of the church world is a is a is is not even a bride but a woman who just keeps dating Christ and then breaks up with him come on do we have a world that has Partners all the time and breaking up and all these other things and I don't like to see that cycle on young people this boyfriend and they're in a relationship they're out of a relation to in they've got 10 of them before they that you know it's it's the way the world functions and it's the way the church World functions can you say man when they just want a dating temporal relationship with Christ this message is not that this is a union of a marriage so much he says invisible Union of the bride of Christ it's a union we go to the marriage supper the marriage is happening now the intimacy and the Oneness with Christ is happening now we're moving out of just a courtship relationship because when you have that then you have people that well I'll break up for a few months or a few years and then I'll come back no no no no this is not that or I just I I only want him for the gifts I only I like this boyfriend because he gives me a lot of nice gifts but I really don't want to marry him I like the jewelry he gives me I like the gifts he gives me uh hello I like when he blesses me I like when I see the signs of this boyfriend but I really don't want to be married to him and and know him that that like that praise the Lord we're in a knowing relationship with him we are known of him he is known of us this message has brought us into that relationship and it cannot be denominational it cannot be reaching back into a partial seeing through a glass Darkly even today it is not enough to watch what he does we must crave to know who he is can you say Amen we will look at what he has done instead of what he is it is not enough to watch what he does we must crave to know who he is I mean just raise your hand brother Paul pray for me pray for me that I have a craving a craving to not just be a spectator to what God does but to want to know who he is to Crave who is he and to come into relationship with him praise the Lord that's what even today is not just enough to watch what he does but we must crave who he is the children of Israel he complained God complained in in Psalms and then in Hebrews you find it I forgot to write the scripture down but he says there are people that know my works for 40 years for 40 years they watched my works but he says they have not known my ways that's what I preached on Sunday you get to know person when you know his ways they talk you hear their thoughts then you know a person but not just physically it's it's knowing his ways and God said for 40 years I'm grieved and notice this now God is grieved he was grieved with an entire 40 Years of generation why was he grieved because they would only go so far as to know him according to his Works they wanted to watch what he did and they wanted him to do more and more and more but he says there are people who do not know my ways my nature they're not catching my nature my character and so they stay in their immaturity of complaining in the wilderness because there are people that have not known my ways only my Works he was grieved with that generation they only stayed at knowing his word his works not knowing him he was always grieved with that he still grieved with that today when you have a people that just are always just knowing and Spectators Spectators of of what he's doing all the time testifying of what he's doing praise the Lord thank God you testify but you can't stay at a level as just testifying and being a spectator to what he's doing it's a relationship it's not deity it's not a boyfriend it's not just a friendship it is a friend God's a friend that sits closer than a brother but you move to those stages and it's in you in Christ you don't stay in dating or courtship or a boyfriend or girlfriend or stay in friendship and that's what we teach and even in young people when when it comes to that this is a thing to really pray about but as you get to know one another it's growing towards something it's not in and out of things all the time it's growing towards it I feel the faith to do it it's in growing into it to a union and that's what we're coming into with Christ as I said Sunday it's not in a physical glance that we know a person this is true in courtship and in marriage you can see someone but you don't know them you can see a person and that's why the question is always come up years ago James Dobson brought it up is it is love that first sight really possible mom and and respectfully some would say yes of course and they got the scripture for it when Isaac singing Rebecca okay I'll go with that and then you maybe got to test me and say first team my dad had it first time she walked into the back of church I looked there said that's it that's the woman I'm going to marry well God dropped the Revelation his heart I'm not against that but let me say it love is commitment love is respect love is loving the person who they are so is love at first sight real love really doable at the moment you see them no you have to know them in order to love them with sacrificial love so that's why he moves into this growing thing and the whole courtship thing is getting to know one another and getting no to know the families because you marry into a family too amen and so all of that is getting to know the person and it's working towards something because because if it's just you know uh something that's loose like the world then it's just I'm involved in going in and out of these things it shouldn't be that way it should be taken more serious than that and you shouldn't be under pressure for it but you should be prayerful prayerful about it very prayerful to say I'm in this not just for physical well I seen her and she's pretty and that's it I want to marry her I've seen him and he's he's good looking and so that's it you know that's I'm going to marry him well that doesn't work for this and it doesn't work for Christ and you say Amen but Divine love and the depth of Love Comes as you know and that's the thing when Christ got come to know us and knows us the way he knows us then the love just keeps pouring out because he knows who we are this is the way it should be in falling in love with Christ how can you love a person until you know who they are and the world has perverted this and reversed all of this until someone is intimate and physical with somebody the first night because the world's perverted I don't even have to know that person they're just a body and you that feed on pornography I can tell you in your mind a woman even in the church a young girl in the church or young person is just an uh just a a an image to you it's just a body because you've been taught that didn't expect to say this but I'm going to say it I'm going to say it you feed on that you feed on the world you feed into those things you'll never look at our young girls properly they're an object to you but you really don't care about their personality or getting to know them it's just moving quickly and the hormones are Russian and it's all carnal it's all wrong and all that stuff is to be left for the intimacy that's in a marriage that comes last can you say Amen but when you get to know them and you grow in that I've fallen in love with this person when we interrupted and perverted to the other way you haven't fallen in love with a person you're not even it's not even true love it's just lust because you're just thinking about just just that part of it which is God's made it special within a marriage that that will be that at the end of the relationship and the beginning of marriage that's where that's to be placed a complete intimacy and guess what it's a it's a it's a partnership but it's an exclusive relationship with just the two of you and you should come into an exclusive relationship with Jesus Christ an intimate relationship with him that nobody's going to talk you out of it it's not an in and out thing I have become married to Jesus Christ he is my lover so to speak in the sense of he's my spiritual connection he's my my one that I've given my life to pray I say this to the children when they get baptized you you uh you take on a woman takes on the husband's name and so she becomes a part of the husband and that's what you do when you get baptized in Merry Christ I take on his name I become him I'm one with him everything I do now represents my husband Christ there's certain things like places I can't go now there's certain things I can't do because I'm a representative I'm his wife what I do reflects on his name that's how serious we should take it but the world has perverted all of it friends and turned it all around and and I I'm blessed to know that God has restored truth not only in a relationship with Christ but the relationship how to direct these young people to approach it the right way and if you're approaching the right way God bless you and may God bless your marriage and God bless you your life because if you respect these values and these scriptural principles that are here God will bless you and God will have a happy marriage for you I believe that how can you know how can you know them until you know who they are how can you love them if you get to know them love grows for them your hearts begin to beat as one as brother Graham said it and it just keeps growing that way it keeps growing that way until there's a complete intimate relationship with one another you're known of one another and by that knowing you love one another more deeply so we go from a limited vision of Christ you still with me we go from a limited vision of Christ to a perfect vision of Christ from partial Revelation to perfect revelation we look how the prophet explains now the prophecy of Paul and I meant to read this Sunday didn't get to it but I'm going to read this and now then I'll close but stay with me here a minute as we look at that this statement that Paul says when that which is perfect is come and this is how the prophet explains that and I'm going to read this to you as they bring it up and this actually originated in a question in 1964. a question what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost that's what somebody was asking what is the evidence what do I look for in an Evidence of Holy Ghost 1964 and I think it's good teaching for us to know this but he said now there there is a really good question now the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience that a person must receive now let me kind of clear that up just for a minute you see and many people have the idea I believe it's twisted and maybe right here to the church and to the church that's listening there might be a question okay can I do this ah there we go and when I speak of not believing in the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking with tongues I I do not accept that I believe with God's help I can prove it to you by the Bible that that's wrong because the speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost how many knows that Divine Healing is a gift of the Holy Ghost and here Beatles are doing it stop right there we're just going to explain that so you know what he's referring to in 1964. so now here he's saying that the the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues speaking in tongues is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost the nine spiritual gifts it's actually at the bottom of all of them and Pentecost in the early days of Pentecost made the doctrine that that is the speaking in an unknown tongue unknown tongue is the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit he said that's wrong I can prove to you the Bible by the Bible That's wrong well where he gets it in the Bible is go right to the book of Acts that's is where they got the book of Acts and they come down and everybody was speaking in unknown tongues that's not true the Bible says they came out of the upper room speaking in other tongues not unknown and all the nations that were gathered in Jerusalem heard them what they were saying in their own language so it was not unknown tongues it was other tongues and these people were praising God in their Hebrew language Jewish language and the people were hearing them a supernatural God was making them hear this gospel or this praise and this worship is what it was there David is drunk in the Holy Spirit coming from the upper room just drunk in the filling of the spirit praising God praise the Lord look what he's doing this is Joel 2 28 fulfilled I don't know what they were saying but they were glorifying what God was doing in their own language but somehow all the nations were hearing it in their tongue God did a Supernatural That's not unknown tongues and Pentecost took and said that must be the evidence everybody that has the Holy Ghost has to speak in tongues or they don't have the Holy Ghost unknown tongues look what he says here so how many knows that Divine Healing then he goes Divinity is a gift of the Holy Ghost that's not the Holy Ghost the person it's a gift of the Holy Ghost we don't want just the gift of The Giver we want the giver we don't just want to enjoy the gift of healing praise God thank you for healing me and not know the giver of the healing then he says is a given and here the Bible you know what he's referring to the Beatles the singing group there was evidence of healings taking place in their concerts it's quiet how do you explain that I I really can't explain it I do not know the explanation that but it's I've got the news articles to show it that there was people built up in the frenzy and whatever happened faith I don't know what it was but something happened and besides that all the churches have Miracles taking place right so that can't be the only distinction God can perform God can honor faith in anyone that believes the strangest thing he's referring and he goes a little bit to me to an extreme to say and the Beatles are doing it okay The Beatles are doing it he said it I didn't then he says now that's no evidence oh holy ghost see you can't really rely on that you can't rely upon then he goes through you can't rely upon the fruit of the spirit because the first fruit of the spirit is spirit is love no that's one of the fruits of the spirit and the Christian Science exercise more love than anybody I know of and they even deny Jesus Christ being divine so they have the acts of the fruits of the spirit they can duplicate them the Pharisees duplicate them peace Joy long-suffering they can put them on and not have the giver can you say Amen even an act of love that's what he's talking about there the act of love and and put on these fruits of the spirit and they deny Jesus Christ being Divine you can't deny Jesus Christ you can't deny the word Jesus Christ and say well but I've got all the fruits of the spirit manifesting in my life you can't do that they're gifts they're things of the holy spirit so there's only one evidence holy spirit that I know of and that is a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour all the prophets that portrayed his life in portions played their part so this is later in the quote and he says all the prophets that portrayed his life in portions partial play their part but in him was the fullness of the Prophet so now he's taken all the Old Testament and all of them reflecting Christ through a glass Darkly but when you get to Christ of 2000 years ago you have a Perfection that come into into Christ that all the prophets and the law was talking about it came to a perfection so watch what he says now here he said all the prophet has betrayed his life in portions played the part he was in Joseph he was in Moses okay in portion in portion the prophets the word of the Lord came to them the prophets but this was the word and the prophet the same person now when a man receives Christ in that manner that he is in you can accept it as being you see now some of them say well I'm a Lutheran well there's nothing against that but the Eagles don't feed on that you see that was as far as it was that was fresh food of that day I'm a Wesleyan that's all right but you're living in the past you see now those people said why if we have we have Abraham Our Father the prophet said God's able to be Stones arise children to Abraham so where's this evidence it's knowing the Christ for your hour not a past portion of Christ not a past revelation of him not going back to Luther's day that was good for them Wesley's day that was good for them but knowing him now because even the Jew says we have Abraham Our Father how could they spiritually be the children of Abraham and denying their Messiah so it come to the Perfection and they missed it because they were reaching back we have Abraham Our Father physically they could say that that's true I'm from my father Abraham but spiritually they weren't connected with the word Christ for the hour and seeing him in front of them face to face in a Perfection that all the prophets wrote about he's standing in front of them so we get to the gift of the Holy Ghost you're quiet tonight we belong to this we belong to that that had nothing he said you generation of snakes who's warned you to flee from the Wrath don't begin to say we have Abraham to our father because God's able these stones to rise children to Abraham you see so being a well-trained theologian had nothing to do with it being Meek and gentle had nothing to do with it what made him different he was the word made flesh not the word for the day of Moses Moses was for that day word not the word for the days of Noah know us was the word for that day the word for the day of Elijah Elijah was the word for that day but he was the present tense word and they were living in the back so the first point he makes about us coming to a Perfection at the end time and the perfect uh the more perfect way is you can't reach back into the past into a partial Revelation because it's not a perfect revelation the same thing repeats that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when God reveals to you you see it thus said the Lord and accept it not what you are what you was or nothing about it it's what God had done for you now there's the evidence now the Holy Spirit when it comes it is a witness unto you that this word is right the word for today not the word for Luther the word not the word for Moses we witness it's the truth but it's it's another day now what if Jesus would have come and said now as Moses come talking to you taking you out of Egypt I've come taking you out of somewhere else what if he said let's go to work and build an ark here Jesus would have said that I'm the Lord God I'm going to float the world away now I'm going to drown the world all of them see we'd be an out of the see the scripture never said he'd come like that see he wouldn't have been the Messiah no matter how much Ark he built or whatever he had done he's still not he had he'd not have qualified the Messiah Hallelujah there you are it's qualification yes sir stop right there and now he goes to the scripture that I have been reading for several weeks now he goes to First Corinthians 13 and says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away I feel safer with him bringing that scripture than any of us if he applied that to this now we ought to just sit up and pay attention that he's talking about Christ and them hanging on to their past coming to the Perfection after the Old Testament and now you have seven Church ages now you have all this 2000 years of church history them knowing Christ through a glass Darkly okay but he says when that which is perfect is come you can't reach back to a past revelation it would be detrimental when that perfect appearing has come to try to reach back now can't do it and the evidence actually you have the Holy Spirit is that is that you will connect with that which has come that's perfect that'll be the evidence of the Holy Ghost finishing up here so all these little things so he says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things and that which is perfect and we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication there'd be a lot that squawk at that but because I've been serving the lord all these years and because he said it and because I've seen the Vindication of it he's exactly right Revelations 10 7. through the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished Malachi 4 5 and 6 Elijah coming to restore all the truth back there's too many scriptures that show exactly what he's saying there'll be a day coming and we're in that day when that which is perfect has come aren't you glad to live in this age I feel honored to live in this age didn't Jesus say something like this as many prophets and sages would have longed to hear the things that you hear every Sunday and Wednesday we're here there's prophets in the Old Testament that would give everything they had to be able to sit in one service that you hear the fullness of the word so we should say Thank You Lord For That and we have we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood his child but when I became a man I put away childish things now we could take it too far and say we're putting all the manifestations of God away that's not what he's saying we let God be God if he wants he continues to do this we let him do and vindicate to our young people that he's real can you say Amen I've said this before and I don't mean it mostly I don't need to see one more Miracle to keep me serving the lord I'm I'm All In because I've met the person he doesn't have to bless me financially or in any way if he never did again if I become a pauper I'm not leaving Christ I'm not Sherry's song says I'm not going anywhere let the devil know I'm not going anywhere he thinks oh they're gonna they're finished now this trial they had they're finished now I want to let the devil know I'm not going anywhere if I never see another miracle Another Blessing of God I'm not going anywhere because why this is not about another miracle to me this is a relationship of knowing him this is a face to face with him this is not a dress code can I get an amen this is not I believe in the dress code and I live by the dress code because I trusted God sent that too but this is not about a dress code to me this is not about rules to me don't do this and kick this out this is not about that I do that to sanctify my life because that's what came from the word of God but I don't do it and live and stay with Christ because of the do's and don'ts I do it because I love him and I'm in a relationship with him let him take everything from me let them take my my books let them take the message from me let him take my tablet let them now take my Bible which by the way they did in the early church they took their Bibles the Catholic Church took the Bibles away from people and the restoration gave our Bibles back to us come on now you know your history Luther and all of them thank God for King James King James Bible God was God used them but let them take this away and guess what guess what that's why when the people have the word in in them in communist country they got enough of the word in them you'll see all scriptures written on the wall and they don't have their Bible anymore but they remembered enough and God remembers to write them on the wall take this away from me tonight and I am in a relationship with Christ I will go on I will go on because this is not about rules it's not about it's not about trying to please him I I already pleased him when he took his son at Calvary can you say amen I was approved in the Beloved now I do want to please him I do I don't want to grieve his Spirit but but I'm not trying to gain my entrance to Heaven by my works the love is there he's proved it to me the love is there from him to me from me to him it's there it can never be removed that's just perfect just come we move out of this childish when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and what does that mean I don't dump out the gifts I'm not preaching that okay but you can't depend on just the gift now it's face to face with the giver it's face to face with him this message has brought us of the last days a completely different relationship with the Lord than the churches ever had before it's completely different knowing of Christ and completely it's not through a glass Darkly this is a face to face with him and I'm calling by the grace of God and the Holy Spirit of God every young person every person if you're just got a religion of this message I'm calling you this is much more than that the person meets us every service the person knows you he knows your name the person of Christ is speaking to your heart the person of Christ is speaking to your heart on the Internet or if it's on the broadcast the person of Christ it's the person of the word that's making himself real that's appearing in the last days and he's longing to to to take your heart and and to bring you into a love relationship with him not a religion but a relationship this is not about religion this is about relationship and this is the hour this is the time this is the day of his appearing this is the day when Christ makes him known he takes all the veils off what's the Book of Revelations mean Revelation means unveiling he's taken all those veils off of himself he's revealing himself to his people so don't reach back into just a blessing and I want God to answer this prayer and I want God to do this that's fine it will always bring our prayers to him but if you only have that and not know him then you're falling short he wants to know you he wants to know you more he wants to know you closer can you say Amen he wants to be so close to you that whatever would happen around you and whatever friends that you would lose or whatever this world dishes out to you what stays intact is your relationship with him did you hear me out tonight are you picking up when I'm laying down using all these modern terms I hope you're picking up what I'm laying down because God wants a relationship with you through the message of the last days and the light on the Scriptures it wasn't even you know there's a lot of people think he just brought back a dress code for the women the message is just God saying I'm going to bring the women under bondage oh my goodness how can somebody conclude I can tell you they're not looking into it themselves they're taking somebody's opinion because this is this is so much Beyond just a dress code so much Beyond just sanctification Beyond it and you should sanctify your life but this is this is deeper can you say Amen let's Stand Together God bless you thank you for letting me finish this tonight and I know it took a little taking a little bit over an hour but uh I pray that it'll be a blessing to you this evening you're a little quiet and tired but that's all right as long as you were listening take it in and speak to the Lord that's that's the main thing praise the Lord God is good I have a man make about it [Music] before even time began all my life is in your hands he knows my name yes and he knows my every thought and he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call listen to this now I have a father I have a farm ER thank you Lord oh he calls me his own what a relationship you'll never believe me no matter where I go [Music] home my name he knows and he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call one more course think about this now what we've been preaching in these last services on the excellent way you know what it is oh lord your beautiful your face is all I see [Music] for when I are homeless child your grace abounds in me leave it covet covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit of me nothing charity suffereth long it's kind charity envious not charity vaulteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they'll fail whether they be tongues they shall cease whether it be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I under understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for we now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known now abide of faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity Divine love father thank you Lord for what you've shown Us in this series and in this chapter thank you Lord and I pray it would be more than just a lesson May the Holy Ghost help us all find that entrance to this more excellent way as we look into your face I pray that's our desire I prayed for every person Lord that's Heard It In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ take the people now in your safety we are we we are appreciative of this lesson tonight and being able to fellowship and worship together Lord may we take this and apply it to our lives we pray tonight as we commit them to you in Jesus precious name we ask it everybody said amen God bless you tonight you're dismissed
