[Music] [Applause] Holy forever. &gt;&gt; First Kings 19 and we'll start reading at verse 9. We're picking up where Elijah here in the third phase of how the Lord dealt with him here. And he came thither thither unto a cave and lodged there. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him. And he said unto him, "What doest thou hear, Elijah?" And he said, "I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it. And he said, "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord." And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake. But the Lord was not in the earthquake. Now, this is extremely important what's being said here because God is going to show what he's going to be in &gt;&gt; and he's also going to show what he's not in. &gt;&gt; That's important, &gt;&gt; especially when you have people who are thirsty to find God and thirsty to find more of God. They're in a vulnerable state because we must not just seek it anywhere, but we must find what God is in and what he's speaking through. Amen. &gt;&gt; We could be very deceived into thinking God is in something. But he must make it clear to the prophet here where God is in where God is in. And he said he wasn't in the wind. He was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, all these real extravagant uh flamboyant things, very extreme things, but he's making it clear uh I'm not in any of those. And after the earthquake of fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice and I can finish it. And God is saying, "That's where you'll find me. &gt;&gt; That's where you'll find me." Strange, isn't it? We look for big things, but God says at the end, "This is where you're going to find me." Uh, it's very important to talk about emotional instability and mental instability. You say, "Well, why do I need to preach to believers about that?" Well, uh, we're the only ones, I believe, that we have a place that we can go to bring any instability. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We're the ones that have a place to go. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad you raised your hand this morning that we have a place to go for all of that? And that's what I'm trying to point you to. But to say we don't need to talk about it, well, that would be denying us as a human being because we are affected emotionally by things. We are affected sometimes mentally by things. But God has promised in his word that he'll give us uh mental stability. He says, "I wish above all things you prosper and be in health as your soul prospers." And that he would give you a sound mind. &gt;&gt; He would give us a sound mind. And so, uh, Calvary did not just provide a saving of from sin, but it also provided all things that we need to bring to him. And so now in the age that we live in, and I I elaborated on it last Sunday, so I don't need to talk about, but we explored a little bit of the cultural plague of addiction, the cultural plague of addiction. How many knows that we're in an age of addiction &gt;&gt; and and the addiction is usually from a lack of the reality of God in man's soul. People are turning to addictions and come to that because they don't have God. they don't have the availability or at least they're not seeking God because God is the source for our soul. God is the source for our emotions. &gt;&gt; And and so now we have a whole uh nation and world addicted uh by many many things they're addicted to and it's because they have not turned to the to the answer that God has given. And uh there's no sense in preaching about other people. But sometimes Christians in a hard time in their life don't turn to the answer that they know is the answer. They'll turn to other things to calm their nerves. They'll turn to other things to kind of settle them down. And they go through mental times. As I read last Sunday about Elijah when he was under the juniper tree, he was going through a real mental strain. He was going through a depression. So let's not deny who we are. We can have juniper trees in our lives. we can have low times in our lives and uh and so this is a reality in the hour we live in and I won't speak uh much more on on those things because we we covered it last Sunday but we realize there's a thirst because we are a three-part being and because we are emotional because we have our minds and not just our souls but we have our emotions that there are things that deplete us in our spirit uh sort of if we could call it this way constant withdrawals calls from our emotional bank accounts. And we live in a world that constantly drains us &gt;&gt; emotionally. &gt;&gt; Drains us mentally. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And I mentioned three things that causes that and that is it can be family or domestic trouble. Uh it can be number two a severe trauma that's happened in your life. You lose a loved one or you have something happen or someone treats you in a wrong way. there's some trauma that happens to your spirit. That's the second reason sometimes your spirit gets there's a withdrawal from your emotional bank. And then there's family and domestic trouble. That's number one. But then there's the third thing of the demonic forces. Just in the next dimension that is an increased pressure against the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Every day in the other dimension, there's forces against you as a son and daughter of God that that are always trying to and I'm going to get to it today. always trying to mis mislead you or pull you away from or cause you to lose the value of the fountain and the source for emotional stability to turn you to something else to accuse the brethren. Can you say amen? Most of the Christians that's in this room and believers understand the battle that you face and it doesn't get any lighter. It's stronger. Demonic forces are against the bride of Jesus Christ to drain you. try to drain you spiritually. And even though your soul would be sealed into the kingdom of God, Satan with what he's left to try to drain you emotionally, to drain you mentally, to to drain you spiritually. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and then we get weak. And and then when we get weak, we're emotionally uh uh just instable sometimes. But the worst part of it is is when we turn to hundreds of other remedies for this instability that we feel. &gt;&gt; The worst part of it is is we turn to other things to calm our nerves. Sometimes even something that is wholesome. We must be careful that there's not a replacement in our lives for the true stability that's in the word of God. My theme today is he's provided a voice within his word. And that still small voice is our full stability in our lives. &gt;&gt; That voice, that word is our stability for emotional pain. That word provides all things needed for for mentally not feeling right. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so there's a place that God has given no matter what we've gone through. We crave the approval of others &gt;&gt; to meet an emotional depletion. Preaching. &gt;&gt; Preachers crave to be approved by others. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be seeking to be approved by other preachers. &gt;&gt; You should seek, he told the Pharisees, you you love the praises of men more than the praises of God. And that's because people live emotionally off of the praises of men. But it's more important that you have God's support, &gt;&gt; God's approval than to s spend your whole life trying to build a big church or do whatever to impress all the preachers. I'm not here to do that to meet an emotional need. My emotional need can be filled in the word of God. Can I get an amen this morning? &gt;&gt; We're not here to build big churches. We're not here to impress other message churches. We're not here for that. We're here to preach the message of the last days and see lives changed. and to minister and heal people that are struggling in this hour. &gt;&gt; They need healing. Can you say amen? They need mental stability. &gt;&gt; And guess what? We've got the word to give it to them. &gt;&gt; We've got a place for it this morning. &gt;&gt; People need a lot of healing. Marriages need healing. &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't even get up here unless I knew that I'm pointing to a word this morning. I'm pointing to a still small voice &gt;&gt; that is the answer &gt;&gt; for every need. &gt;&gt; There's been a fountain opened in the house of David. &gt;&gt; If we'll drink from that, he has the the answer to our needs. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We crave the approval of others to be acknowledged. But you see, you should never take a gift and you should never try to be seen to fill an emotional void in your life. Am I speaking the truth this morning? I know this is right now where we're living, but we've got to grow into stable people. Can you say amen? We can't lean to the approval of others. And we can't live on our appearance. If I can just keep my appearance right in front of everybody, then that feels No, we must fill it with God's approval and God's love in our lives. Because I guarantee you, if you keep trying to fill it with other things, from Hollywood movies all the way to the approval of preachers, if you're trying to fill some need in your life, you will be disappointed. &gt;&gt; That's Satan's kingdom. Can you say amen? Every alternative he has is a disappointment. &gt;&gt; But in God, there's no disappointment. There's only satisfaction. &gt;&gt; There's only satisfaction. And may it may look sometimes it may look sometimes like God he didn't answer. Oh it didn't it may look like God's disappointed but God never disappoints us. &gt;&gt; God will never disappoint you. &gt;&gt; God will fill your needs. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God will establish you. &gt;&gt; God will stabilize you. &gt;&gt; God will even you out. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; God can take whatever you brought to church this morning. And God can give you a stable, peaceful minded heart. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Satan, I'm going through this by the grace of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we find all of it. We're not We are not here to fill our thirst for stability with all this with something else, but we find all of it in the Lord and his voice. And that's my theme. So now I believe God's calling us to be a stable people &gt;&gt; to express stability and consistency in an inconsistent world. &gt;&gt; Confidence. The Bible says in Proverbs, meddle not with those people who are given to change. Don't fellowship a lot with people that are given to change. &gt;&gt; In other words, from one week to the next, you don't know where they stand. You look at their post and it's like one week they're posting something that's completely contrary to a Christian testimony &gt;&gt; and the next week they're quoting a scripture as if they're so close to God. It's an age of instability. Don't meddle with them that are given to change and instability. Don't depend on the government. Don't depend on anybody else. Can you say amen? Find your stability in the word of God and in his voice. I believe it's a people that God is raising to be confident, not arrogant, &gt;&gt; but confident. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say this to you. You're not a sinner because you get nervous sometimes. You're a human being. &gt;&gt; You're not a sinner because you get anger. Angry. &gt;&gt; Just be angry and sin not. &gt;&gt; God made us who we are. &gt;&gt; We get angry. It's an emotion. We we we get nervous. We have nerves. God put them in our body. We just got to find something to keep them calm. We got to find the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we will get nervous. Elijah got nervous. We can't deny how God made us. But it's when we choose temporal things constantly. And I'm speaking to the social media generation. I'm speaking to all of us who have millions of alternatives to calm our nerves. Excuse me. From medicine all the way to the entertainment of the world. We're in we're in Satan's Eden here. And if I could describe it, he's the god of this world. And because he's the god of this world, he presents things to believers even that would be an alternative to calm our nerves. &gt;&gt; And I'm not against any of it. As I said last Sunday, I'm not against if a medicine is helping, we give God glory. But give God glory. &gt;&gt; And don't ever think that's your ultimate end. God helps you through that, then say, "I give God glory. He's helping me." Because he heals through medicine. He heals through a little bit of love. He heals through a little bit of caring for somebody. &gt;&gt; Don't you put in a box how God heals. It's not just a healing line. It's just not a healing. God's bigger than that. God can heal you right now while I'm ministering this word. There's a still small voice speaking right now. You're not a sinner because you get nervous. But it's when we choose temporal things constantly and we never stabilize into a more faithful consistent walk with God. How many would raise your hand? I want a consistent walk with God. I want a relationship with him that doesn't go from camp meeting to camp meeting. &gt;&gt; Consistency. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God the the the pressure is uh you know for a believer this the way we got to look at it. If we if more pressure comes on us, then we look at it is it's it's going to turn it into more power over the enemy in our lives. Not God's not called you to just be stay in a juniper tree. And that's what we had the three phases of Elijah's life, a Mount Carmel. How many's ever had a Mount Carmel? &gt;&gt; How many would like to always every day have a Mount Carmel? Well, it didn't happen with Elijah, so it's not going to happen with you. Second phase, the first one was Mount Carmel. Then he went straight down, hit rock bottom under a juniper tree, &gt;&gt; sleeping it off for days. Depression, people sleep, they sleep, they turned to all kinds of things. But Elijah just slept it off. Elijah's sleeping it off. So he had he had a low time. He was wanting to kill himself. God just kill me. God, just shoot me. I'm finished. I'm done. I got Jezebel barking at my heels. I've got all this stuff going on. And I I've just He just come from that real high. Ministers, watch yourself. You come that high to that low and he come right through that to experience even Jesus experience this depressing feeling. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's real. Don't deny that it's not going on. &gt;&gt; And and and so but you see, you have to know in those times that God has called you to something higher. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen this morning? God has called you for something more. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. It reminds me of the the pilot was in a one seat plane and he was going and flying at a certain level and he hears something in the back and he looks at the back and there's this little mouse in the back just chitter chattering and the mouse actually as he was flying and he only had one seat there. He couldn't get back to the mouse. He just starts to eat at some of the wiring that's running the plane. He's eating it and he's he's going at and so this guy starts to sweat and get nervous. He's wondering what am I going to do now? I can't get to that mouse. And if he keeps eating at this, we're going down, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he thought and a thought and he that thing is still eating at those wires. And all of a sudden, he has this thought. Hey, I can fly higher than that mouse. &gt;&gt; I'm built to fly higher &gt;&gt; than any little creature like that. Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; You know what he did? He just went way up high until he seen that mouse just disintegrate and fall over dead. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you this morning as a believer, you're not called to live like the rest of the world. You're not called to addictions. You're not called to any addiction. You need to fly higher than that. God's called you to something higher. &gt;&gt; Not because you deserve it, but because he gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Say, you're talking about everybody else in this room. I'm sorry, brother and sister. I'm not talking about everybody else in this room. I'm talking about you. So when Elijah then when he comes through the juniper tree, then he comes to the third phase which I read you this morning. And he comes Elijah in the cave, Mount Carmel, the uh juniper tree, and then the cave experience is the part that I'm emphasizing this morning. The the cave was the third part of the mystery behind this. The cave is the third part of the mystery. How many know that three is perfection? &gt;&gt; You will find in your Bible the basis of this number three being a part of the mystery and types throughout your Bible. And I could list a bunch of them, but this three has a spiritual meaning of of seven is completion, but three is perfection. So you when you hit the three, then you hit a perfection. So in other words, it's not in the first phase. It's not in the second phase that you hit a perfection, but the third phase is what we're growing into. And that's coming to perfection. And the number three means perfection. You'll find it throughout the Bible. Three means in the Bible means wholeness. Wholeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And perfection. Not just perfection, but wholeness. So, you know, it was the it was the third angel that came to Abraham with his final promise. There was three parts to the Old Testament tabernacle. Took three days for Israel to cross Jordan. Took 10 three days before they crossed over Jordan. Daniel prayed three times a day. Jesus said, "Destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again." &gt;&gt; And did he do it? Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It was the third day that the mystery broke. It was the third day that it was a perfection that came. &gt;&gt; I could read you hundreds of more. You can look them up yourself. The number three has a significance to it. Jesus said, "Destroy this temple." Paul was three years in the Arabian desert until he come out with the mystery to preach the mystery of Christ. There's three phrases to the rapture. Can you say amen? A shout, a voice, and a trump. &gt;&gt; The mystery breaks under the three. &gt;&gt; Mount Carmel, God gives you power and boldness like he did Elijah. &gt;&gt; The juniper, what is that experience? It tells us God will nourish us and sustain us when we are that low. Cuz he couldn't sustain himself. We learned in the juniper tree that when you can't take care of yourself, &gt;&gt; God will take care of you. God will nourish you. &gt;&gt; How many raises hand? I've been there, done that. I know what it feels like that I don't have the strength to go on. And God's faithful to me to send me some supernatural cakes. Can you say amen? A little bit of water. Can you say amen? Let them sleep it off a little bit. Rise up. Take nourishment. Can you say amen? Cuz we can't even get it for ourselves. But we learned under our juniper trees that God will be there and sustain us when we can ourselves. &gt;&gt; We learn in Mount Carmel to be bold and speak the word of God. &gt;&gt; Call fire down from heaven if needed. But you see now then we come to this third thing. It's kind of like two extremes in our walk. Must have been two extremes for Elijah to go from a Mount Carmel, which is the extreme of something glorious and God vindicating so much. You could tell God was there. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; God came and showed up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God showed up. God brought the fire. God proved to the whole world, all the nation of Israel, this is my prophet. This is him. This is God showed up in a in a big way. How many's had that happen in your life? &gt;&gt; And it's it's a wonderful, but it's like the two extremes because then you come to the juniper tree and it's the complete opposite &gt;&gt; and yet God is still there. &gt;&gt; The same God that brought fire down and vindicated himself to all of Israel, now he doesn't need to vindicate himself to all of Israel. Now he needs to just be a nourishment &gt;&gt; to his prophet. So God is God is bringing his prophet through this prophet process but he needs to show his show him the final mystery. It's the third one that he must come to and the bride must come to as well. He says stand out in front of the cave. Come out of that cave and stand up on the mount. I want to show you something. So God calls him to the cave and shows him something. He has a secret that he has to pass to Elijah. to stabilize things. And so now this third mystery, it's to stabilize and to show him. Because if get this now, it's and this is what it is today. Knowing he's going to show Elijah where I God's saying, I'm going to show you where I will be. Knowing where God is, where to find him. And friends, listen, that's my message this morning. Showing us where he is and where to find him is everything. We we have to look at this and we have to see it's essential that we know where God is and where to find him to get a hold of him today. Amen. &gt;&gt; This may be so just dirt simple this morning, but listen, I'm telling you this because we have an enemy that I'm facing even this morning in this service that is distracting the young people and distracting even bride members to cause us to lose value of where God is in the still small voice to cause us to fill our lives and make it busy to we don't have time. We don't sit still. &gt;&gt; Amen. and shut out all the noise &gt;&gt; so we can hear this still small voice. &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
