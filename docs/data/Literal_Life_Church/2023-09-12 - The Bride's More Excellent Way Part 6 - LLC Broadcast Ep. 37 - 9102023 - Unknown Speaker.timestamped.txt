[0:00] hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and
[0:02] literal Life Church in Petersburg
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God if you're hungry
[0:11] for more of Christ we believe you can be
[0:14] fed and we pray that you'll be blessed
[0:16] visit our website for more information
[0:18] at
[0:19] literallife.church may God bless you my
[0:21] friend and may the music and message
[0:23] encourage you today
[0:27] place was white as snow
[0:33] in pure's finest gold
[0:39] it had the look of new
[0:43] it had the look of old
[0:49] felt like I was home
[0:54] yet I felt so far away
[0:57] please
[1:00] I fear I thought to leave
[1:04] but felt the urge to stay
[1:10] foreign
[1:25] [Music]
[1:59] foreign
[2:02] [Music]
[2:41] then from my sleep awakens
[2:45] I looked into the night
[2:49] the darkness
[2:51] overtaken by a bright and Shining Light
[2:58] I couldn't understand it
[3:02] I couldn't reason how
[3:06] within my eyes
[3:11] [Music]
[3:17] [Music]
[3:34] [Music]
[3:35] oh
[3:37] [Music]
[3:47] [Music]
[3:51] foreign
[3:56] [Music]
[4:23] foreign
[4:25] [Music]
[4:33] First Corinthians 13 and verse 6 Rejoice
[4:38] not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the
[4:41] truth and I'll just read worthless now
[4:43] Divine love divine Capstone love
[4:46] rejoiceth not in iniquity it never
[4:49] rejoices in iniquity but it does Rejoice
[4:52] over something it rejoices it gets happy
[4:56] in the truth and when truth prevails and
[4:59] when honesty is there and the truth
[5:01] comes out that's where we Rejoice not in
[5:04] lies not in iniquity not when someone
[5:07] Falls not when someone makes a mistake
[5:09] there's no rejoicing in Divine love of
[5:12] that but when someone finds the truth
[5:14] and we know that the truth shall set you
[5:17] free and so that is divine love and
[5:20] action that we rejoice in truth and and
[5:24] that truth prevails just add a scripture
[5:27] in First Corinthians 12 the chapter
[5:28] before verse 25 and verse 26 as Paul is
[5:32] talking about
[5:34] the body and how it works together and
[5:37] the Natural Body and then he types it
[5:38] with the spiritual body of Christ verse
[5:41] 25 and verse 26 that there be no Schism
[5:44] no division that there be no division in
[5:48] the body but that the members should
[5:50] have the same care one for another and
[5:53] whether one member suffer all the
[5:56] members suffer with it or one member be
[5:59] honored all the members Rejoice with it
[6:02] so there can't be any jealousy if
[6:04] someone suffers we don't gloat over that
[6:06] we're not happy over that they got what
[6:09] they deserved no we suffer with them so
[6:12] there's a point to be made here and if I
[6:13] don't get to it again today there's a
[6:15] point to be made there if somebody else
[6:17] in the body is suffering then you're
[6:19] suffering
[6:20] that's how much we're part of one
[6:22] another
[6:22] if someone gets honored then we're all
[6:25] honored and we rejoice in that
[6:27] that's how much we're tied together now
[6:29] you can act separate next I'm an island
[6:31] to myself all these other things but
[6:33] that's not what the word teaches the
[6:34] word teaches by the Holy Ghost I'm tied
[6:36] to a body of Christ somebody suffers I'm
[6:38] suffering that's why I pray for them
[6:40] that's why I lift them up that's why I
[6:42] encourage them because if they're
[6:43] suffering I'm suffering
[6:45] if they're going through something I
[6:47] want I don't want to come down with them
[6:49] but I want to lift them up and I want to
[6:51] feel the pain of their suffering because
[6:53] they're a part of me I'm a part of them
[6:56] amen I'll say it like my dad used to say
[6:58] it you didn't put me in the body of
[7:00] Christ you can't take me out
[7:03] you didn't put the person standing next
[7:05] to you in the body of Christ so you
[7:06] can't take them out
[7:08] so he used to say it this way as much as
[7:11] some of you might don't not want me or
[7:13] someone else you're stuck with me
[7:16] you stuck with me amen so learn to love
[7:20] one another praise the Lord and so I'll
[7:22] just read that again he says there be
[7:24] that there be no division oh God
[7:27] hastened the day when there would be no
[7:29] division in the body of Christ but that
[7:31] the men members should have the same
[7:33] care one for another and whether one
[7:36] member suffer all the members suffer
[7:38] with it and one member be honored and
[7:40] all the members Rejoice with it last
[7:43] time we talked about the the more
[7:45] excellent way and this is the more
[7:47] excellent way part six hopefully we'll
[7:49] finish this up next Sunday but last time
[7:51] we talked about the more excellent way
[7:53] that Paul talked about it is the way of
[7:56] divine love and the last thing we
[7:57] dropped off of which I don't feel like
[7:59] we had plenty of time to cover the
[8:02] subject but the last time we learned
[8:04] that God's Divine love in US does not
[8:07] keep record of wrongs so I want you to
[8:10] remember that because that's probably
[8:11] one of the key things of all these
[8:13] things that we've been preaching on that
[8:15] that we that that love does not keep
[8:18] records of wrongs love does not hold a
[8:21] grudge for years but love forgives and
[8:24] the reason why this is an important one
[8:26] to re to to refresh your memory on is
[8:28] because this is the one I think we
[8:30] struggle with the most many times and
[8:32] that is we are bound when we hold on to
[8:35] a grudge of someone else we remain bound
[8:37] that person may be go on but we're not
[8:40] released we're not we're not bounds so
[8:42] forgiveness releases us and can release
[8:45] the other person as well so it's
[8:48] important that we don't keep records of
[8:49] wrongs and to clean the Slate of others
[8:53] just as God does with us to clean the
[8:56] slate and to forgive and to give others
[8:58] a fresh chance
[9:00] to release the wrongs through the true
[9:03] forgiveness of God to release wrongs
[9:06] through the truth you can't fully
[9:09] release them unless you come through the
[9:10] channel and the Forgiveness of God but
[9:13] when you bring your life through the
[9:14] Forgiveness of God then it releases the
[9:17] wrongs that others have done to you it's
[9:19] to wash the past history away to delete
[9:23] the past to click delete on our past
[9:26] debts with people it is very important
[9:29] to study this again and go back and look
[9:32] at it and it needs more than just a
[9:34] study I'll tell you this needs a real
[9:36] Supernatural manifestation in all of our
[9:39] lives
[9:40] some of us become professionals at
[9:43] keeping the score
[9:45] fresh in our minds of the wrongs that
[9:48] people have done to us
[9:50] some of us have it locked and lodged and
[9:53] it's it's blocked there in our memories
[9:56] and we're not even making any efforts to
[9:58] Let It Go
[10:00] but it gets lodged there I'm holding
[10:02] that 16 years ago they said that to me
[10:05] and they put me down and they criticized
[10:07] me and we hold it right there my friend
[10:09] I'm encouraging you if you stay there
[10:11] the other person isn't bound you're
[10:13] bound
[10:15] you're the one that's bound and the
[10:17] locked up of your mind of what that is
[10:19] and the Bible tells us love does not
[10:22] keep records of wrongs love pushes
[10:26] delete can you say Amen how do I do it
[10:28] brother Paul just ask God to help you
[10:30] just delete it just push delete erase
[10:33] the debts of others can you say Amen how
[10:36] can we not do that when God has done it
[10:38] for us when he pushes delete of our sins
[10:40] it's gone forever in the sea of God's
[10:42] forgiveness how is it that we can't do
[10:45] that for others you can't move on in
[10:48] Victory if you continue to hold on to
[10:50] these things and keep them in your mind
[10:52] and keep a record and keep these the
[10:54] history of people there was one married
[10:57] man that said to his friend you know
[10:59] every time my wife and I get into a
[11:00] conflict she gets historical
[11:03] and his friend said
[11:06] his friend said
[11:08] you don't mean historical you mean she
[11:11] gets hysterical when you have an
[11:12] argument she gets hysterical he said no
[11:15] I mean historical what do you mean by
[11:18] that is that when we get in this
[11:19] argument she rehearses anything I've
[11:22] ever done in the whole history of our
[11:25] marriage
[11:26] so I'm right she gets historical now I
[11:29] know none of you know anybody like that
[11:32] or your wife or husband you don't know
[11:34] anybody like that but listen for me I'm
[11:37] going to be honest if you're not I'm
[11:38] going to be honest is that this is a
[11:40] real thing is that when people get angry
[11:42] about something the the whole history is
[11:45] right there and they bring it all out
[11:47] and I don't know why we do but it's like
[11:49] a weapon
[11:50] is to get back at somebody I don't know
[11:53] anything else to say right now but I'm
[11:55] mad and all of a sudden I've got a whole
[11:57] list of what you've done then I'm taking
[11:59] you from after your salvation all the
[12:01] way through bang bang bang bang bang
[12:03] bang bang bang bang bang bang and then
[12:06] the person listening is like he's being
[12:08] shot bang bang bang bang
[12:10] she gets historical not hysterical now
[12:13] you might have some wives that actually
[12:14] get hysterical at the same time
[12:18] and I don't know why they use the
[12:20] example for a wife but let's not get on
[12:21] the wives okay wives had an incredible
[12:24] memory for things that's happened in the
[12:25] history but and I don't know
[12:27] psychological what all that is but
[12:29] listen now I'm not speaking on that I'm
[12:31] saying every one of us have a certain
[12:33] level of keeping the history of somebody
[12:36] come on people say amen
[12:39] and this is what the Bible teaches us
[12:40] against because we don't have a right to
[12:43] hold the history of somebody if they've
[12:45] asked forgiveness or if they haven't we
[12:47] don't know we pray for them that God
[12:49] will bring them to that but we are bound
[12:51] when we hold a grudge towards somebody
[12:54] so I'm bringing that back up up again
[12:56] because this part of divine love we
[12:59] really need to ask God to help us to
[13:01] project this it will set us free it'll
[13:04] set others free as well because we are
[13:07] giving them a chance and we're erasing
[13:10] their history so that we're giving them
[13:13] a chance for a fresh start in the part
[13:16] of divine love that's spoken of in verse
[13:18] uh uh
[13:20] verse six we want to study this a little
[13:23] bit because this this meaning today of
[13:25] divine love really gets to the heart of
[13:29] what makes us really glad or what
[13:31] pleases us there are things that make us
[13:34] happy and please us and and things that
[13:36] make us rejoice but as Christians there
[13:39] are other things that should make us
[13:40] rejoice and one thing in Divine love in
[13:42] the Christian walk is that we should
[13:44] never have something that triggers
[13:46] happiness in us when someone else Falls
[13:48] we should never have something in this
[13:50] that triggers a joy in us that swells up
[13:53] when someone else Falls or someone gets
[13:55] payback for what they've done wrong this
[13:58] should not be a part of us this is not
[14:01] part of the love of God and it shouldn't
[14:02] be a part of us can you say Amen this
[14:05] gets to the heart of what we really
[14:08] should be rejoicing over and this is
[14:11] what triggers us to rejoice and it says
[14:15] that it never rejoices in iniquity but
[14:18] it rejoices in the truth the source of
[14:22] our happiness joy and rejoicing and
[14:25] pleasing and and and gladness should be
[14:29] truth prevails
[14:31] truth comes to somebody truth is
[14:34] preached truth is lived can you say amen
[14:37] that's why when when we have this world
[14:39] of such uh that's in such a mess and sin
[14:43] is glorified and sexual sin is glorified
[14:46] and living together as couples is
[14:49] glorified it's all okay and people play
[14:51] around with one another and sexually
[14:53] give themselves another before marriage
[14:55] I like to at a wedding emphasize to
[14:58] those there to in the whole world to
[15:00] take something that stayed pure until
[15:02] marriage and kept it that way under
[15:04] God's holiness I like to blast it to the
[15:07] entire wedding ceremony and everybody
[15:09] listening because it's not too often
[15:11] that truth and Holiness get praised in
[15:14] this world
[15:15] everything else gets praised you see now
[15:18] this world's messed up because it always
[15:20] praises the sin all along but it doesn't
[15:23] praise a holy life every day it doesn't
[15:26] praise when truth prevails can you say
[15:29] Amen it doesn't acknowledge the truth it
[15:31] doesn't rejoice in truth but Christians
[15:34] should rejoice when truth prevails not
[15:37] when lies Prevail can you say Amen but
[15:40] when truth comes to a person and changes
[15:42] their life when truth sets somebody free
[15:45] I tell you we ought to be shouting and
[15:47] rejoicing and happy when somebody gets
[15:50] free
[15:51] you shouldn't be happy when someone gets
[15:53] revenge or someone sin is glorified in
[15:56] this world whatever affects God should
[15:59] affect us When sin prevails it should
[16:01] grieve us can you say Amen when
[16:03] everything Turns Upside Down In This
[16:05] World which it has it should grieve
[16:07] whatever makes God grieve should make us
[16:09] grieve but whatever makes God happy
[16:12] should make us happy can you say amen
[16:14] and divine love rejoices in the truth
[16:17] not in the iniquity can you say math
[16:19] what Grieves God should grieve us what
[16:22] makes God happy should make us happy as
[16:25] well and when and I'll get to it at the
[16:27] end of the service but there are seeing
[16:28] things in the scripture that we know
[16:30] makes God happy and makes the Angels
[16:32] happy and whatever that is that's what
[16:35] we want to be rejoicing over as well
[16:36] Divine love does not rejoice and get
[16:39] happy when others fall in sin Divine
[16:42] love whether it's you falling in sin or
[16:45] making a mistake or whether it's other
[16:47] people iniquity is not anything to get
[16:50] happy about if God Grieves that
[16:52] Rebellion then we should grieve at
[16:54] Rebellion whether it's in us or someone
[16:56] else if God is not gloating that someone
[16:59] got what they deserved do you think God
[17:02] gloats when he brings forth a punishment
[17:04] or a judgment on someone that he's
[17:06] promised to bring and they kept running
[17:09] over God and rebelling towards the word
[17:11] and God had to bring forth his promise
[17:14] that you'll reap what you sow but do you
[17:16] think God gloats in the fact they got
[17:19] what they deserve I can tell you God
[17:20] doesn't gloat in it I can tell you God's
[17:23] not happy with it I can tell you God's
[17:25] not saying they got what they deserved I
[17:27] told them I warned them they give God is
[17:30] not thinking that God is not willing
[17:32] that any should perish
[17:34] God's not willing that anyone should
[17:37] turn against his word in Rebellion and
[17:39] he doesn't gloat or rejoice when someone
[17:42] does it his heart is grieved
[17:45] and so God is not gloating that someone
[17:48] get what they deserve and if he doesn't
[17:50] then we should not if God carries
[17:53] through on his judgment and by how many
[17:55] would raise your hands to God is the god
[17:56] of judgment we don't hear that in the
[17:59] church World very much today because
[18:00] we've eliminated all the scriptures
[18:02] about but God being a god of judgment
[18:05] and following through it with judgment
[18:06] but we have too many accounts in the
[18:09] Bible that once he gives the warning
[18:11] then he does bring judgment he brought
[18:13] it on Sodom and Gomorrah for their sin
[18:15] he's brought it before and he will do it
[18:18] again he can't let our nation that's
[18:21] resisted God and this world he can't let
[18:24] him get by or he wouldn't be a just God
[18:26] judgment is coming
[18:29] and so so if we look at God now many
[18:32] people misinterpret him and they only
[18:34] say it's only the Grace part God is God
[18:37] full of grace but he's also a god of
[18:39] judgment he's just can you say amen and
[18:41] if he broke his promise and let
[18:43] everybody get by with it when they won't
[18:45] take his path for forgiveness they
[18:47] choose their own way then there has to
[18:49] be a judgment to follow that he warns
[18:51] them and then God's warning and then
[18:54] judgment that's his pattern warning in
[18:55] the Judgment I say to you today if
[18:58] you're listening online if God's warning
[19:00] you over and over again for the life
[19:01] that you're living if God's sinning you
[19:03] are you ought to respond to that warning
[19:06] because that's God's grace to correct
[19:09] you and to warn you
[19:11] you keep turning it down then the Bible
[19:14] shows you come under the judgments of
[19:16] God
[19:17] but I want to say about the judgments of
[19:19] God he carries through on his judgment
[19:22] but the reason that God carries through
[19:25] is not because he wants to
[19:29] it's because he must be just and he must
[19:32] follow his promises if he lets you get
[19:34] by and made a promise I'll warn you then
[19:37] judgment's coming and he didn't follow
[19:38] through we wouldn't have confidence that
[19:40] God keeps his word how can we trust any
[19:42] of this as God don't keep his word but
[19:44] when he says something he follows
[19:46] through
[19:47] so when he says something about judgment
[19:49] he will follow through but he doesn't
[19:50] want to do that he is not willing or
[19:53] gloating that any should perish
[19:56] how many know the scripture in Hebrews
[19:58] God used to be first Peter God is not
[20:00] willing that any should perish and I'll
[20:03] tell you friends that that's in the
[20:04] heart of God why is it in our hearts
[20:06] that I'm not willing to see anybody
[20:09] perish
[20:10] I don't have anything to see anybody I
[20:13] don't care how bad they've been I don't
[20:15] care if they've been in prison I don't
[20:17] care if they've killed someone in our
[20:19] hearts we are not willing to see anybody
[20:21] perish because of that but we look and
[20:25] pray for redemption in a life can you
[20:27] say Amen how many believe in Redemption
[20:29] this morning I believe in Redemption of
[20:31] God I believe the lowest sinner can come
[20:34] to God and be changed
[20:36] [Applause]
[20:37] that's how powerful Redemption is it
[20:39] doesn't matter how low you've gotten God
[20:41] can redeem you God can save you but you
[20:43] got to accept his way you got to give
[20:46] your life completely over to you the
[20:48] Greek word for um the Greek word her for
[20:52] rejoicing is uh the Greek word is Cairo
[20:55] Caro c-h-a-i-r-o which means to Rejoice
[20:59] to be glad
[21:01] to be delighted or pleased
[21:03] so when it says we don't rejoice in
[21:05] iniquity we rejoice in truth it means to
[21:09] be glad to be delighted to be pleased
[21:10] and think about when you are delighted
[21:13] about something what you think about
[21:14] when you're delighted about something
[21:15] you're pleased with something you're
[21:16] glad about something if you're glad
[21:18] about something you may talk about it
[21:20] you probably dwell on it you'll bring it
[21:22] up maybe you even make a a big deal
[21:25] about it all the time you magnify it
[21:28] because you're rejoicing over it you're
[21:29] pleased with it you're glad about it you
[21:31] rejoice in it it makes you glad so
[21:34] that's the the Greek word to this type
[21:37] of rejoicing so you should now put that
[21:39] do you are you glad and delighted over
[21:41] iniquity in someone's life or iniquity
[21:44] in your life are you pleased with that
[21:46] does that make you please does that make
[21:48] you delighted hopefully not
[21:51] but we magnify so look at your life
[21:53] today look at your life today and say is
[21:56] there something in me that is pleased
[21:59] and rejoices as in glad and is delighted
[22:02] when iniquity prevails when someone
[22:05] iniquity is unrighteousness iniquities
[22:08] iniquities knowing to do good and not
[22:10] doing it
[22:12] and when that happens in your friend's
[22:13] life or a person's life or a Brother's
[22:15] life sometimes
[22:17] what is it in your heart what's your
[22:19] first feeling about it
[22:21] think about the things that make you
[22:23] happy I don't know what that is things
[22:25] that make you glad and if that's a part
[22:27] of it we need to hit an altar and a
[22:29] heart say Lord something's wrong with me
[22:31] if I'm gloating and happy and get a
[22:33] little happy feeling when somebody gets
[22:36] paid back
[22:38] for their Rebellion
[22:40] that little thing that says they
[22:41] deserved it
[22:44] right when we leave that up to God
[22:47] why don't we leave that up to God so
[22:49] many people lately I've been saying why
[22:52] are you so Bound by what that other
[22:54] person is doing you're being bound and
[22:55] they don't even know it it's between
[22:57] them and God what they did
[22:59] you pray every day for them and that's
[23:01] all you can do but quit living under the
[23:03] bonds of worrying about what they're
[23:04] going to do
[23:07] release it in the name of the Lord
[23:09] release what they've done to you
[23:12] it's time to go on it's a new year
[23:15] brother Bob it's the new year can you
[23:18] say Amen Wednesday night we're on New
[23:20] Year's Revelations New Year's it's a new
[23:22] time why don't we leave the past in the
[23:25] past why don't we leave it in the
[23:26] graveyard of all the crazy stuff why
[23:29] don't we set our hearts on this new year
[23:31] 2023 is going to be a wonderful year
[23:33] with the Lord and I'm going to be free
[23:35] of losing sleep all over this stuff I'm
[23:38] going to free be free of the bitterness
[23:40] I have towards people I'm going to let
[23:42] it go it's between them and God
[23:45] somebody say praise the Lord
[23:48] amen so now we look at our life as a
[23:52] Christian and he's we have to see what
[23:54] triggers the most Delight is it when
[23:56] somebody gets payback is it when a lie
[23:58] is told because that if you have the
[24:00] opposite of Truth we have a lie when
[24:02] lies are told then do we Rejoice over
[24:05] that and that lie travels around lies
[24:08] travel around faster than truth
[24:13] you know we're working to get the truth
[24:15] out all over the world we're sending
[24:16] Bibles everywhere but I can guarantee
[24:18] you lives of the scripture travel much
[24:21] faster than the truth
[24:23] and in a local church gossip travels
[24:26] faster than the truth
[24:29] people buy into gossip as soon as they
[24:31] hear it they don't know if it's full
[24:32] truth yeah but but but you you join in
[24:35] with it I'm gonna talk about gossip just
[24:36] a minute because you see now all those
[24:38] lies travel around and they hurt a
[24:41] person because lies are going around
[24:42] about a person and so you hear it come
[24:46] back and it comes back to you and you
[24:48] have a little feeling well they deserve
[24:49] that so I'm joining do you enjoy a
[24:52] conversation of juicy gossip that puts
[24:55] others down but you don't know whether
[24:57] it's truth or not
[25:00] I say hit an altar
[25:04] do you give yourself permission around
[25:06] your family to talk down anybody in the
[25:09] congregation and what's interesting they
[25:11] don't hardly even know that person in
[25:13] their own congregation but once they
[25:14] hear a little something they say
[25:16] something they join in with it gives a
[25:18] little little sarcastic joke and little
[25:20] laugh about it and you don't even know
[25:22] that person you don't even know if it's
[25:24] the truth of what you're saying or
[25:25] hearing I say shame on us
[25:28] shame on us for joining in Gossip what's
[25:30] interesting is you don't like anybody to
[25:32] do that to you do you you don't like
[25:35] lies told about you as a matter of fact
[25:37] I'm going to go ahead and say it is that
[25:39] people what almost demand an apology if
[25:42] somebody gossips and something said
[25:44] about them they need to apologize to me
[25:46] but what's interesting is you don't
[25:47] apologize for anything you gossip you
[25:49] talk you put down other people and not
[25:51] once if you went and made it right
[25:55] so we don't like people talking about us
[25:57] when we get defensive about it we get up
[25:59] but we give ourselves permission to talk
[26:01] about anybody whether we know it's the
[26:04] full truth or not that's when we're kind
[26:07] of gloating over gossip
[26:09] and what we don't know and we're kind of
[26:11] happy and we kind of get a rush
[26:14] out of that atmosphere talking
[26:18] the pastor's hitting on Gossip because
[26:20] the devil of Gossip is always around
[26:25] you know he's not left with too much to
[26:27] work with but he always likes to get in
[26:30] conversations when it's gossip
[26:32] so the next one says love does not
[26:34] rejoice with injustices or iniquities
[26:36] love to rejoices with when truth
[26:40] prevails so if you've caught that
[26:41] thought today this is that that channel
[26:43] of divine love that finds the the the
[26:46] the reason why it rejoices First
[26:49] Corinthians 13 6 this is our text and
[26:52] then I read to you in first Corinthians
[26:53] 12 there that there be no division in
[26:56] the body of Christ but that the members
[26:58] should have the same care of one another
[26:59] and when the whether one member suffer
[27:01] all the members suffer with it or one
[27:04] member be honored all the members
[27:06] Rejoice with it in other words we are so
[27:08] tied together that's why we can rejoice
[27:11] when someone is honored and we can
[27:13] rejoice when someone comes to truth in a
[27:15] victory and a Deliverance in their life
[27:17] and that's why we can grieve when
[27:19] someone else is grieving
[27:21] give them a positive word give them a
[27:24] text of encouragement Interlink with the
[27:26] body of Christ it's not going to hurt
[27:27] you to get closer to the body that
[27:29] you're a part of
[27:31] it's not going to hurt you to bring your
[27:32] young people and get them integrated and
[27:34] plugged in with the body of Christ not
[27:36] going to hurt you to invite somebody
[27:37] over
[27:40] why are you why are you so afraid of
[27:42] that
[27:43] why are some of you so afraid of it
[27:48] tell you something that makes me nervous
[27:53] no that's your uncle that says things
[27:55] like that
[27:56] that's a family member
[27:58] I love you and I'm going to encourage
[28:00] you some of you are too detached from
