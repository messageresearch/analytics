========================================

few moments greet you all in the name of the lord our visitors as well good to good to see you in many years some of us um before we i won't be singing any songs i i've been told before that uh my brother has a singing gift in the family so we just try to keep keep where we're called and gifted as much as possible now yeah i stand next to gideon choir sometimes he notices i give him our time he holds the ear next to me and i try not to take that personally but um yeah we do our best before we get started i just want to give a give a short testimony on monday this week my my wife and son were heading to a doctor's appointment and i'm in the middle of my uh middle of my english class and i and i get this phone call and i almost didn't hear the phone because i have it on on silent but i heard something vibrating back behind me so i picked it up and it was my wife it's always good to pick up your wife's phone calls no matter if you're in the middle of something else and this time it certainly was because she and joba just got in an accident maybe you could show the first light here um there's the uh there's her car she'd gone through a uh red light and gotten hit by a uh gotten hit by another vehicle and i was uh we were just glad that uh it was just a car that was damaged uh a wife didn't have any uh she was a little bit sore for a day but nothing bad she often has headaches and things like that but the lord just really really touched her so we're just very thankful you know we uh we pray watch over our families uh when we go to work and things and uh it's good to see how god does uh it does protect us and uh you know i think her your guardian angel just might have gotten a promotion this week we're very thankful for that but now the other part of the testimony was uh last week brother brand i were talking about the uh about the used car market we both drive old cars and things i said lord i told i really pray our cars just keep on doing it for a really long time because i hear it's really hard to find a car right now when you do find a car people pay above the sticker price everything i don't like paying above sticker prices things like that and it's the very next morning i get the phone call your car's in trouble uh so we went and got ahead checked out it was uh totaled pretty quickly but my dad he said okay i think to help you he walked around he went to a used car used car lot and he walked in the door and right behind him uh walked walked in the owner of the company um tom all this is not an advertisement but he had just been to our school a couple about a month before um giving the kids gideon bibles so he knew he he knew who we were and things and he said yeah just the day before somebody had traded in a dodge caravan low miles great condition uh good price and within that same day i went home eight o'clock that evening with a new van and that's a god provided he protects and provides so we're just very very grateful my wife and i were talking in the evening we just you know when god takes care of you in such a way you just feel so loved he takes care of us well this morning um lord laid on my heart i had to give it a give it a title i'd call it the broken image and we'll start out in genesis 1 27 i have it here on the slide we can stand and we can read it in genesis 1 27 god so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so when adam was created we can see he was a mirror image of god and then when when eve was separated out of adam together they formed a mirror image of god and if there had been if the fall hadn't happened and there have been more many more mirror images of god populating eden one way or the other know how that would have happened but there was humans would be able to look at each other and say i can see god in you because we're mere images of god we can see god in one another that was what the intention was were mere image we were created as a mere image of god however with the fall the mirror image of god that was in them was broken it was it it was shattered and that's the broken image you want to talk today about that broken image and how god works to repair it and how satan tries to keep us from getting that image repaired you may be seated go back to the powerpoint presentation thinking about a a broken image and now we use uh i might use a mirror in them i was driving up and asked my wife in the car to know what what day is it today and i was thinking about uh today is halloween but she corrected me she's the more spiritual she said no it's reformation day because this is when martin luther nailed his 95 theses so she put me in my place there but i was just kind of thinking about about halloween and one of the superstitions that we know it's a if you break a mirror it said to bring seven years bad luck i don't uh i don't believe in that but i kind of thought the idea behind it why why do people associate that bad luck with that superstition well because they they look at this as a picture of you and when this image of you is broken that's a bad thing and i think you can take it back uh this this idea of an image being broken it goes back to the fall how god created man in his image and when that and when that image is shattered when that image is broken you can try to look in the mirror again but if there's a shattered mirror you're not going to see a clear picture of who you are and when that image of god within the human being was was broken with the fall there is no clear image of who we are when we look at one another we can see shattered pieces oh yeah there's there's something of there's something good because in in every human being no matter whether they're have if they've been washed in the blood if they're justified sanctified and every human being they're there there is still a broken image of god and they're capable of creating things of great work that's why even in in secular literature and secular music you can see some real kernels of truth out there because each person is made in the image of god but it's a shattered image and that's why we can't just focus upon upon any one individual to be our salvation because it's a shattered image of god so immediately though after after the fellowship with god was broken the image of god was shattered with an adam and eve immediately god comes down to seek his fallen children because they've lost their identity and the only place that they can see their identity clearly again is in god himself so the image of god is shattered they cannot look at each other and see exactly who they are god comes down himself so they can see ah that's papa god that's where i came from that's who i am he had he wanted to come right down to reaffirm who they are that they're his children and we're going to find whenever god comes down to try to reaffirm who his children are the devil's going to come right in very quickly to to to hinder that one of the uh maybe our next slide then our next one one of the very first of the ten commandments is thou shalt not make into the any graven image and i think this is significant not just because it's the second of the commandments but i think it's because we're made in god's image the image is broken and whenever we go to try to find out who we are from another source that's going to be an image instead of god only god only by looking at god can we see a clear image of who we really are and we can see right as god gathers the children of israel there at mount sinai with the purpose of establishing a covenant with them making clear their identity with him making clear their relationship with them they are his covenant his chosen people in this first one of his first grant is thou shalt not make any graven image and as he's up there on the mount one of the very first things they do is they make the grave an image and we see clearly in this situation why this is so bad maybe our next slide psalm 135 gives gives i think a good reason for why these images are bad the idols of the heathen are silver and gold the work of men's hands they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath in their mouths so it's completely illogical to worship a god that you make yourself but the next part is is the key they that make them are like unto them and whenever you set up an image instead of god in our life we're not going to become more like god we're going to start becoming like the image that we set up and then the book of exodus as soon as they uh they have set up this uh this molten calf they get up early the next morning they offer burnt offerings and peace offerings they get up to eat and drink and then they rose up to play they stopped acting like the chosen people of god and they started acting like animals because they who make the image become like undo it so when god wants us to be our attention completely focused on him because that's that's the only way that we can see who we're supposed to look like because the image is broken god wants our attention to be fully on him because as we focus upon him as we gaze upon him and open our hearts to his word we become changed more and more into his image because that's where we come from that's what he wants to restore us to he wants to repair the broken image and we didn't that image is repaired by focusing upon god and drawing closer to him the devil wants to get in there get some image in between whether it's a graven image whether it's a mental concept doesn't matter get something in between so that we'll be looking at something else besides god because only by looking at pen upon god gazing upon him accepting him that's the only way that the broken image within us can be restored idolatry carried a stiff penalty in the old testament because if you're not drawing your identity from god you will fall for anything and you will start acting like anything so there was a there was a clear penalty in deuteronomy 29 talks about if anybody starts setting up idols turning your hearts away from the lord your god to serve other nations etc and they'll say when this happens um they might bless themselves in their hearts from deuteronomy 29 and say i'll have peace i'll walk in the imagination of my heart i'll add drunkenness to thirst the lord won't spare him and his name would blotted out from under heaven it's a it's a serious thing to reject the image of god to reject the identity of god and then lead other people astray in that and then brother branham says um when israel this is in the sardisian church age when israel rejected the leadership of god in the pillar of fire and turned to worship the golden calves their names were removed from the book of life and then he says if it happened then most assuredly israel's rejection of jesus christ is the messiah would demand as severe a penalty so i want to take a look at another time take a look over in the book of um well we'll we'll be thinking more about matthew now when when jesus christ comes as the messiah here he's coming god and flesh if there's any way that we can see who we are who we're supposed to be who we're made to be it is in the ministry of jesus christ god and flesh this is what this is what god's will was at the beginning but very quickly whenever god is bringing forth a clear image of himself for us to focus on become connected with so we can be restored our broken image can be repaired whenever that happens the devil is going to come in with another image for us to look at now in the book of exodus we see this was a physical graven image in the um in in the gospels we see we don't see the scribes and pharisees erecting statues that we should be of jehovah we don't see a graven image but we do see images that they have in their own conceptions of how god would work and their own doctrine and those become the image that they seek after it's so important not to take anything else but just what god is because when you make an image whether it be a grave whether it be a graven image in the old testament you look in the all the old pagan literature they have all these gods and godlesses the gods and gods they create they're more like humans they're nothing more you can't you can't go beyond them and become more godlike they you become more depraved when you take a look though in the all in the um in the new testament as jesus comes the messiah comes fulfilling all the old testament scriptures the scribes and pharisees refuse to accept it and it's interesting the things maybe we could look over in psalm 69. i mentioned i said matthew we're going to look at psalm 69 this is a messianic psalm and david makes many statements about the messiah here that jesus ends up accepting or quoting about speaking about himself as you're turning i think it's interesting when we look when jesus comes as the messiah some of the things that happened around israel at that time i didn't realize but the description the sadducees in the pharisees they were two very very different groups within judaism actually about the hundred years before before jesus was born there was a there was a jewish civil war and the sadducees and the pharisees were on opposite sides they were fighting a civil war the sadducees were more associated with the greeks and they wanted to hellenize make it more make jewish more like the greek religion and the pharisees wanted to know keep it simple keep it back the traditions of moses and they fought a war about this thing but when they what's the one thing that could could unite these two groups in the spirit of bipartisanship it was the rejection of jesus people who had great enmity would never work together but when jesus comes and the messiah comes it brings these two groups together so when when the messiah comes here let's just take a look at psalm 69 and we'll just pick out a couple of scriptures here um verse eight a couple of couple of scriptures that we can easily identify with jesus i am become estranged to my brethren an alien to my mother's children here this is a case where this is one that clearly can be identified with jesus he says verse nine the zeal of your house has eaten me up and there are approaches of them that reproach thee or fall upon me jesus quotes the scripture as he's going through the temple and cleaning it of the money changers let's see here let's take a look down at verse 20. reproach has broken my heart i'm full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none and they gave me also a gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink this is this is fulfilled they're on the cross verse 22 let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap and this is a scripture that that really um i'd never seen that before in this slide until we were teaching our sunday school class a couple weeks ago and we were as we were reading this in the sunday school class it opened up to me like it hadn't before let their table become a snare before them their table this is where the torah would have been this is their their conception of how god should be coming we want god to come and throw off this roman yoke god has to come our particular way this is what what we this is this is the this is this is our grave our our graven image as it were how god has to work but when they reject truth when jesus comes and he fulfills all those scriptures the thing that had been a help to them this table of the torah the scrolls they had their table had been a help had been a guide for showing what god's will was but when you reject truth the same thing that had been for your good for so many years for centuries had been for their good it now became a snare a trap for them this word of god the law of the torah had been for their welfare but when they refused the fulfillment of it it becomes a trap because they think we've got it this jesus he's not in it at all and they're going to they're going to just they're going to the dutch have an expression when you're having an argument you're going to keep your legs stiff i'm not going to bend at all and this is why what happened here the things that they had held near for so long had fought wars over they'd confessed jehovah's name for so long yet now when they refuse truth when it's open before them the very things that they'd held there that were god's word becomes a trap and a snare to them because they are now drawing their identity from something besides god's revealed word god comes down in flesh this is who you're supposed to be here i am jesus says i am he he comes down in this way and the devil comes right with him at the same time to give them something else no you don't want this hold on to this interpretation of the truth and they they turn away from that from the god's revealed word to what they thought was true and what they had had becomes a trap and a snare for them when you look at if you follow paul and barnabas through the through the book of acts on their missionary journeys now we remember when we take whenever we take a whenever we erect a graven image we become like unto it and when um one of the amazing things that happens as as jesus is going to be crucified god has provided them with a king a king very different to what they had wanted or expected but god provided a king well in john 19 15 as the jews are betraying jesus now the pilate they shout with all their hearts we have no king but caesar as they reject what god has provided for them as they reject that they're making a full-hearted acceptance of the bondage that they had actually wanted to be freed from they'd wanted to deliver from that bondage when you resect when you reject god's revealed truth everything that you had had becomes a snare to you and you're making it open-hearted acceptance of bondage and they think they're doing right the whole time now paul on barnabas we can look at um acts 13. whenever paul and barnabas are traveling through asia minor they for a while they have a up to this point i believe there's there's a pattern they follow whether they go there in cyprus or in asia minor they first go to the synagogues because god god worked with the jews first before we start working with the gentiles we'll go to the jews first and every time they got they started getting put out of the synagogues after a while in acts 13 we see the jews now they have a likeness that they have erected of how god should work it is different from god's fulfillment in in in in jesus we're going to see them becoming like unto the image that they've erected acts 13 45 when the jews saw the multitudes of gentiles who were following paul and barnabas they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming now now the jews are acting like the very image that they directed they reject the image of god they take on the image of caesar caesar's our king and that starts affecting how they live they don't want anything to do with these people who are actually teaching from the law the truth from the torah taking them beyond that they don't want anything to do with that and they're crying out as hard against their they persecute paul and barnabas just like they had been persecuted by greeks and romans earlier but when you reject god's revealed truth take on another image you're going to become like that image paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life though we turn to the gentiles and from that point on the the the pattern changes when they go to cities they don't always go to the synagogues first they start going to the gentiles they had taken something else the jews had taken something else as their image and they became like it brother branham says you know god doesn't send anybody to hell you send yourself to hell god god directs barrier after barrier he sends the truth to you and every time that we step over that god's not sending us to hell god's not sitting in judgment in our lives it is we who are taking that choice whenever we take a that whenever the devil gives us a temptation he's giving us one end of the stick it looks very attractive very beautiful but we can't separate the end that the devil shows us from the end that's in his hand because it's very tempting is out there we want to grab that but the judgments the the difficulties that come with it are connected there at the other end of the stick and that can't be separated now as uh as paul continues his journeyings many different people start working with him but maybe we can turn over to second timothy one of these men was demas second timothy chapter four and we don't know a whole lot about demise's testimony what we do know though is he worked well with paul for a time but at some point demas started getting his eyes off of what god was doing and the world to come and the gospel that was being preached and he got his eyes on this present world and ii timothy 4 10 says demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world that's such a sad thing because demas was working with the apostle paul god was clearly working through the apostle paul's ministry doing a great and mighty work but how easy it is even then we're so close to truth it's being revealed how the one that god's working with we can still have our vision clouded we don't know whether there was a disagreement with paul i think he got his toes stepped on at some point or maybe he got flagged or thinking i should be getting some more attention maybe he just maybe he just wanted to wanted more money we don't know what it was but one way or the other got his eyes off what god was doing got his eyes on the present world and there was a desire out for that that's a sad thing now i spend a little bit more time looking more what what the antichrist what the devil tries to do even in this end time as god we can take a look in the book of acts in acts chapter 2 see how the how the church started out and it's very clear god's working in a in a supernatural marvelous way uh the holy spirit's being poured out it's just amazing but if you compare the book of acts with the description of the church that's given in the book of revelation chapter 2 and 3 and the church ages there's a very big difference between the book of acts and how the church became over the succeeding centuries very big difference and we see it some somehow somewhere the church started perhaps getting their eyes off of god started looking around and becoming more and more like the world brother braham talks about how the church was very similar to what how israel was back in the days of samuel how they wanted the king they wanted to be like the nations round about them when they do that they're getting their eyes off of what god is god is their king they start getting their eyes off of him looking at the other nations around them and they want something more like that so in the in in the day that we live in now god has shown what the son of god looks like he worked mightily in brother branham's ministry in the ministry of many others but he worked mightily in this way to do a restoration and i just want to i want to assert you that the antichrist is offering today if you look at pop culture and popular religion the antichrist is offering a substitute image for the church to identify with the bible give us a clear image of christ the the gospel that paul preached we want to be looking at that as we look at that we'll become more and more like that and the broken the shadow image within us will be repaired the devil wants to do anything and everything he can to get our eyes off of this truth is look at anything else so that that broke image within us can't be repaired his goal though he knows how we're made he knows that we need there there's a need for something bigger than ourselves there's a need for this sense of the religious for the sense of the spiritual so he does offer religion today he helps men scratch their spiritual itch he wants to do anything to keep that quiet enough so that they don't reach out to christ he's doing everything that he can to keep us from spying our true identity which can only be found in the word of god now in um kind of looking at how how the devil would be working in our day in the 20th century 21st century now i read a quote a few years ago by a man named william booth and he was the founder of the salvation army he was uh you could have on the slide here there he is he almost looks uh like this picture he looked like an old prophet almost but he as he's at the beginning of the 20th century he's writing he says the chief danger that confronts the coming century will be religion without the holy ghost christianity without christ forgiveness without repentance salvation without regeneration politics without god in heaven without hell i read this the my he describes our world today to a t the devil has done everything he can to give you religion without god religion without the holy ghost give you christianity without christ because if you have christ in the picture and you're looking at christ you're going to become more like him but he want to give us a sense that we're worshiping christ without ever knowing the real one want to give us a sense of spirituality the devil's not against spirituality he's for spirituality he's not against that he wants to encourage spirituality to turn you aside from truth from the bible that when god came down set as two feet on earth in the body of jesus christ that's who we should be identifying with the devil wants to take that completely out let you feel spiritual but not have this and what we have described if you look at the uh the next slide this is a picture from uh from pilgrim's progress this is when when pilgrim is carrying his his burden there on his back foreign pilgrim's progress is a really good thing you should have your your kids read at some point there's great uh can children's versions you can get for upper elementary junior high versions high school you can read the full thing it's a great book highly recommended but here you got pilgrim with his with this burden of sitting on his back and the evangelist just told him you've got to go go through that wicked yonder wicket gate that there's one way to get that off your path and and the door the gate is jesus christ you have to go through that gate and as he's going he makes at the gate as he's going he's good he's heading to an area that's going to be the cross at some point but he meets this man along the road named worldly wise man a worldly wise who says no you don't have to go that way that's way too hard you need to go over this way i've got a nephew a cousin in this little town called legality his name is mr civility and he can get that burden off your back and no time not so long a journey pain-free and you'll be able to settle nicely here legality and civility and he christian goes along this way it sounds nice but shortly along along the path he comes and he he comes by this mountain of the law because we can do all these things in our own minds we can take we can we can try to be nice people and we can try to we can try to follow the law of god the best we can but it doesn't always sate the conscience inside of us and he pilgrim goes along mount sinai and there's that's typing the law of god and he's feeling i'm going to be condemned that is not good i'm going to be death is upon me unfortunately evangelist comes just the nick of time and evangelist does not speak nicely to a christian he rakes him over the coals i mean if christian were to be offended this is the place where he would get offended but he says what worldly wise man has preached to you with all his kind kind sounding words he sounds so nice what he has done he he has tried to take the cross out of your experience and any any any kind of spirituality or religion that takes the cross the blood jesus christ out of your religion out of your experience with god it does a disservice to you and that should be offensive to us because it sounds so nice worldly wise men said civility this is a place with nice people who wants to live with nice people yes we all do but if they're not if they haven't met jesus christ if they haven't if they haven't seen meth met the cross but filled with the holy ghost you won't be helped there you might feel good there sometimes but christ didn't come to make us feel good christ didn't come to make us nice people christ came for dead people to be made alive if you go to the doctor and go to get surgery done i'm not looking forward to having surgeries done you're going to get shots you're going to get cut you're going to be have things done you that are not nice but those things have to be done to get work on the inside if you have if you want your heart to be changed open heart surgery they take this soul and they cut through your sternum they might break some ribs because something in your heart needs changed it's not nice this doctors come with this thought doctor i want a nice doctor no you've got to have a doctor who's willing to do what needs to be done and a worldly wise man isn't that doctor in 2005 the university of north carolina at chapel hill did a study of youth and religion and they studied the religious beliefs held by american teenagers and they conducted over three 000 interviews that's a lot to a lot of people to talk to i'm just i'm thinking here they're talking to folks who were teenagers in 2005. if they were 15 in 2005 they're going to be in their 30s now so um it says we'll just kind of see what they have to say about them but the dominant faith posture among american teenagers and indeed the culture at large the doctor the the the researchers summarized as moralistic therapeutic deism it says this is the this is the general religion of teenagers today and of our culture today i just want to spend a little bit reading reading about this because we're at a time remember we have a broken image of god inside of us that all of us do and god wants to repair the broken image the only way for that broken image to be repaired is for us to gaze upon the image of christ focus upon that and anything that tries to come between us and the true image of god it will be another image but it's going to keep us from being for knowing who we truly are and this moralistic therapeutic deism this describes the church today and if we're not careful it'll get in our homes how we even tell our bible stories how we tell our kids what it means to serve god it's not always a happily ever after ending in every single area of our life it can it can affect us on your next slide moralistic therapeutic deism what is it well it has five main uh main tenants or five laws about it first the idea god made the world to watch is over it um god's main purpose for us he wants us to be nice he wants us to be good and fair his main purpose for us according to moralistic therapeutic theism he wants us to be happy and feel good about ourselves and this is we we want this as well but you can have something that's that is con that is good but if it misses other things that are true the thing that you're being given is not a good thing nice people will live happily ever after there is an afterlife and if you're nice and good in this world you'll live happily ever after and lastly god does exist but he's cool with giving you your space he'll be there if you want him to be there but otherwise he's hands off do your own thing just be nice to everybody this is kind of a summary of moralistic therapeutic deism and one author says in a very real sense this idea of being nice kind pleasant respectful responsible working on self-improvement taking care of your health trying to be a successful person this sounds nice we want this and in a very real sense this appears to be true of a genuine faith commitment as well but insofar as this can be described as a faith commitment this is held by a large percentage of americans these individuals whatever their age believe that religion should be centered in being nice so whenever you try to take a stand for something taking a stand for anything is not going to be nice so kind of anything goes so it's moralistic in the sense that you have you got to be you've got to give general frame of what does nice behavior look like but it's therapeutic it wants to give therapeutic benefits to its adherence this is not a religion the researchers explained of repentance from sin or of keeping the sabbath or of living as a servant of the of of a sovereign god this is not a religion about saying prayers or observing holy days or building character through suffering or basking god's love and grace this is more a religion of spending yourself in gratitude for the cause of social justice it's about feeling good the dominant religion among u.s teenagers is essentially about feeling good happy secure in peace and this is the dominant religion in 2005 among teenagers that means these are our 30 year olds today it's about attaining subjective well-being being able to resolve problems getting along amiably with other people it's uh just being nice next slide it says god is something like a combination of the divine butler and the cosmic therapist he's always on call takes care of any problems that arise professionally helps his people feel better about themselves and does not become too personally involved in the process this is the rel this is the god the image of god that most people will carry today and there is not a church of moralistic therapeutic deism there's no denomination of that but the authors have kind of described this um this is a more of a dominant civil religion and they don't have their own church but they're almost colonizing the existing churches more people come to church saying these kinds of things that do sound nice but if you believe this without believing the cross without believing christ without believing the death of resurrection that he's in the need for the holy spirit you're saying some things that will sound you might sound like you're saying the same thing as a true believer sometimes but you aren't but but you aren't and it's this is this is a dangerous thing because the devil is giving us another image to be looking at that's going to keep the image of god within this from being repaired the authors of this study argue that this distortion of christianity has taken root not only in the minds of individuals but also in the structures of at least some christian organizations and institutions how can you tell the language and the experience of holiness sin grace justification sanctification heaven hell those things aren't often talked about right it's about being nice communion with god having good feelings be moralistic we're supposed to be good people supposed to feel good about ourselves or have some honor to to god and said about talking of these things the doctrine of the bible it's been these things have been supplanted by the language of happiness niceness and if you're nice you'll have some heavenly reward there at the end in this therapeutic age human problems are reduced to pathologies in need of a treatment plan sin is excluded from the picture and if you don't diagnose the problem right you won't deal with the sickness sins excluded from the picture doctrines like the wrath of god or the justice of god are discarded out of step with the times unhelpful to the project of self-actualization we're not supposed to be self-actualized you're supposed to be god-actualized but when we have a picture like this in front of us we want to become like this that is going to hinder the repair of the broken image of god inside of us when you think about this is the image of god that is preached in many churches throughout the country many places so even when even though we're made in the image of god the religious being that's offered in most churches is one where god of the god of the bible is largely absent that means there's no real mirror for us to see who we actually are just kind of think about in the dark ages had the devil do this he did it by doing the holster service in latin and now in our ssi today we have bibles everywhere you can get bibles get bibles anywhere you used to be thrown in jail for smuggling them now you can get them you can't you have you have a dozen bibles perhaps in your own house you have it on your telephone you have on any device you have them all over the place but it's deceiving us thinking that this is the god of the bible when it's not so there's no mirror for us now to see there is but we're not using it there's no mirror for us to see who we actually are so we're going to believe we are whoever the devil tells us we are and i just think that this if you look at many of the news stories and the some of the controversial issues in our day-to-day it has to do with teenagers especially but folks of all ages having an identity crisis who am i am i a boy am i a girl am i some combination between am i going from one what what is this why do we have this this huge identity crisis well the image of god has been shattered within us and now the the bible that tells us who we are who we're made to be has been subs the mirror's been put aside we're given you are whoever you're happy feeling you are and that's a moving target because one that you'll feel happy one way never you feel happy another way there's no real basis for who you are because the image of god has been shattered and our reference point for who we are the god in the bible has been pushed aside it's here though we can look at the word of god we can be changed more and more daily into his image we have to look at it and not take any substitute from the devil now the book of revelation talks about the bride of christ being clothed in white robes robes of righteousness and i just want to ask how is the modern church ever going to have such clothing if a religion without the cross is being preached if a religion without the blood is being preached a religion without the holy ghost is being preached repentance is not a fun feel-good process but it's very very necessary and if you're saying and as william booth said in this uh in this 20th century he's thinking there's going to be forgiveness without repentance i'm sorry but there is no forgiveness without repentance it's not it's not possible and if you're being told you'll be fine it'll be just fine but if you're not ever going through and repenting it's not fine if there's salvation without regeneration where regeneration is a work of the holy spirit where yes you come just as you are but you don't leave just as you were if you leave as you were you didn't meet anybody there at the altar so william booth is saying this coming century there'll be a great danger people will be thinking they have been forgiven but without having any repentance they'll think they're saved without being regenerated that's a lie a complete lie if this is the kind of thing that's being preached how will the ever how how will a church ever be clothed with robes of righteousness moralistic therapeutic deism does not clear spots wrinkles and such things from your clothes it does not let you be holding without blemish there's only one way for that that's for the blood of jesus christ to come and flow over us for us to be washed by the water of his word for his word but his anointing is being preached week and week out where we're fellowshipping not just around the world but in the spirit of the word with revelation of god that's the only way the only way for the bride of christ to be clothed in the white robes now there are many voices in the church world um i'm by far not the only one um many voices in in the church world who diagnose the problems with moralistic therapeutic deism and they're very good at diagnosing it much better than i am uh much better describing what's what's what's wrong with it but i i i'm going to suggest they're better at diagnosing than than treating so this moralistic therapeutic deism was published in a was described in the book written in 2005. in 2010 we could take a look at our next slide an evangelical pastor named david platt he published a book called radical taking back your faith from the american dream and in his book he critic he critiques the church for becoming like a corporation this uh church inc offers all kinds of benefits social centers daycare entertainment a consumer version of christianity and all these churches they compete for the local market share and many christians are simply pursuing in a spiritualized version of their worldly goals and one of the one of the pictures along with uh plant's book his diagnosis says we are not worshipping the jesus of the bible he's right he's right the american dream has taken over the church at large he gives a good diagnosis here his his treatment though his solution is that we should surrender our materialistic dreams i can say amen to that if we were to to to spend less and and and and and give more to uh in our tithes and offerings give more to charities to give more to other other other ways of helping the needs in the world that's a great thing he's suggesting do more mission projects in the third world live on a live on a percentage of your income give away a much larger percentage of it this is this is a great thing this will be killing the american dream within us there are great goals in these sets there's nothing to be said against them we'd be due to a lot better if we lived on less and gave our surplus to good causes but i'd say even though he diagnoses this really well his idea of living on less and giving more doesn't really restore a church who's held the doctrines of balaam who've gone into jezebel religion and estate who believes all kinds of things that are not true about god in the bible he gives a good diagnosis and it would be good if we spent less and gave more but we need something other than what he's prescribing what god prescribes god god looks at the very same situation if you read revelation chapter 3 when he looks at the loud to see in church age god is describing the very same things that these these the evangelical pastors would be describing this is this this this last stage church is going off the rails people are catching it they're diagnosing it but god's given god's description god's diagnosis knows notice god's treatment is different in revelation chapter three he says anoint your eyes with isaf if you look at revelation chapter 3 revelation chapter 2 this is not a church that needs to give less or spend less and give more it's a church who needs to be restored back to what the church was at the beginning this is a that is god's uh treatment plan if we were to call it such so even though platts um plants treatment plan might be uh uh different than what god's was some of the things that he says in this book i i came across this first in the new york times book review years back but um this this sentence i just wowed me he says when we gather in our church building to sing and lift up our hands and worship we may not actually be worshiping the jesus of the bible instead we may be worshiping ourselves we may be worshipping ourselves he says and i get to thinking i always heard there's only two choices on the shelf pleasing god or pleasing self when we please self who are we really pleasing it's i can think back to isaiah isaiah 7 or 14 i forget wish but satan lucifer wants to exalt himself above the stars of god he wants to be like the most high he's the first one who worships self that's right and whenever we take that spirit upon ourselves we want what we want i want to worship myself never take that spirit upon us we're not worshiping ourself it's really a nice looking version of worshiping lucifer and if you look at what he's saying in the church building singing and lifting our hands in worship you may not actually be worshipping jesus of the bible but worshiping ourselves and when i read this for the first time i maybe go back and think of a quote that brother branham i i'd heard of brother branham quoted many times and it can be honest as a teenager and i'd heard that when i would hear this quoted i kind of have the problem with it i didn't get it how is it possible for people brother branham says you'd be worshiping the devil thinking you were worshiping god how is that possible but if you look around us it's happening let's go to our next slide this is the message satan eden satan's eden the god of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping satan but it's satan impersonating himself as the church see as the church they worship satan thinking they're worshiping god to the church and i had a hard time getting this but you know what if he's preaching this in 1965 i was hearing in the 1990s and i'm processing then things have gotten so much worse so much worse and you can see the shoe fits the shoe fits and what we need today we don't need somebody to tell us how good we are help us feel good about ourselves we need a prophet to come out of the wilderness and say this is what's wrong with you this is god's solution wake up we need somebody you know they were teaching in sunday school class about the wise and foolish virgins last week in matthew 25 it says all 10 of them were asleep all of them were asleep so why is virginia start feeling good i'm i'm the good one no none of us are because all of them were asleep and when you have to wake somebody up i have to to my kids uh in in the morning getting ready for school you're not a nice person when you wake somebody up in the morning you're not i had we had a fire a firefighter come to school this past week and talk about fire safety with the kids and he's talking about if if the fire alarm goes off and if the smoke run goes off in your house what are you supposed to do you get out and you stay out where you're supposed to go you have to go to your place of safe everything and he's talking about with these kids and he's the he's the fire inspector he's this this is his thing he goes through schools teaches about it he says you know kids you should be having you should be having fire drills in your homes several times that you'd be doing that so that if there's a fire happen you need to be ready knowing exactly what to do he says my wife mrs myers she doesn't like when i do fire drills because i do fire drills at six in the morning and eleven at night like ah wow this is not a nice guy making everybody think's going off six in the morning not nice but he's seeing value most fires happen and everybody's asleep i want to get my folks up and out i don't care if my kids are crying if my wife's upset with me i want them out that's what we need that's what we need next slide satan is good at misconstruing parts of scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know all that moses did was perfectly well the scribes and pharisees had that what moses did was perfect it was great but when they were when they rejected jesus christ the table that had been for their benefit became made a snare became a trap when you take the promises that they gave for this day and then apply it to another age that's the devil's good at misapplying it that's all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all he doesn't have to translate the bible into latin he doesn't have to block the app and the whole country he just has to get you to think this isn't for me he's accomplished his goal then he says people ignorantly worship satan thinking they're worshiping god and i think that's what that's the case we see in the time that we live ii thessalonians chapter 2. let's see here this is the next slide paul writes here let no man deceive you by any means actually i'll read verses one and two also we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ by our gathering together with him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as tramas is that the day of christ is at hand it's not yet paul says one of us reap one of the signs of his coming will be this let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called god or that's worshiped so that he as god sits in the temple of god showing himself that he is god and here we have it being set up where satan is being seated and thrown in the church people are worshiping him thinking that it's that they're worshiping god now the book of revelation describes clearly an attempt of the devil to substitute another image for the image of god maybe we can turn over to revelation chapter 13. now in jesus day there was a large group of jews who would been following moses were who were religious and the church age book brother branham says as israel the chosen people of god in majority when they rejected jesus they forfeited their rights in the book of life and he also says then so also will the majority of the gentile church come into condemnation with the resultant removal of their name from the book of life by rejecting the word and thereby entering into the world ecumenical movement which is the image directed to the beast and that's when i read that statement a month or two ago i was that's a huge statement the majority of the names of the majority of the gentile church kept their names moved from the book of life but think about the majority of the gentile church what's being preached if it's moralistic therapeutic deism there's nothing there that'll let your robe be white and righteous there's nothing there that'll do that for you next slide revelation 13. i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake is a dragon he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causes the earth and then which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and that brother branham commenting about the scripture says it's another beast coming out of the earth and it has two horns like a lamb go back a slide maybe again yeah another one here we go um now if we hadn't seen what a buffalo was this is these are baby buffaloes but if you can put yourself in john's position what would you call these animals yeah is it a cow is it what is it exactly so he says yeah like like a lamb next and you can see next slide so you can see who it is there's a you see by looking at the parent you see the identity is go on then brother branham says this this creature next slide like a lamb coming out of the earth this unpopulated region the sea is filled with multitudes of people but this buffalo comes this land animal comes up out of the it says out of the united states this is this is this was the last frontier as it were and it speaks of another beast coming up out of the earth who's going to succeed in making an image to the beast that everyone in the world would worship and i just want to uh this is this is not new news but about 10 or 11 years ago pope francis he's been exceptionally effective in expanding the ecumenical movement he's making inroads in all kinds of in all kinds of churches especially among american charismatics but in february 2010 he spoke to kenneth copeland's word of faith ministries next slide and he speaks by uh by iphone and he says let's each give each other a spiritual hug and let god complete the work that he has begun a work of unifying us all together and kenneth kenneth copeland all these other men and women they thought this was just a a wonderful wonderful thing and the america an anglican bishop before he plays this video message this bishop palmer speaks to the crowd and says when my wife saw that she could be catholic and charismatic and evangelical and pentecostal and he was absolutely accepting the catholic church she said she'd like to reconnect her roots with the catholic church so she did and this is what the book of revelation talks about so are the so is the mother so are the daughters coming back together and the crowd cheered and palmer continues brothers and sisters luther's protest is over is yours and kenneth copeland after he uh after the next slide today this this this gathering his comment on this was heaven is thrilled over this you know what is so thrilling to me when we went to the ministry 47 years ago this was impossible and if you look at what happened in jesus's ministry around the crucifixion people who were at odds with one another were unified in their condemnation of of christ pilate and herod they were political enemies but in getting together to condemn christ john says they became friends jesus unified them the sadducees and the pharisees they'd been at each other's throats if you watched the chosen that's kind of alluded to these groups of the pharisees who don't get along all these politicking that that's alluded to but jesus brought them all together the scribes the pharisees the sadducees the herodians all these different groups came together and they joined to condemn jesus and matthew 13 says there before the rapture will take place there'll be a gathering and here we see a gathering of many many tears back to the roman system and uh pope francis we don't know uh how long he'll be pope or what but not but he's done really good job at gathering people together first with the the waldendians a group in italy that the catholic church had just martyred and persecuted terribly in the middle ages but he went to tour to apologize for that and uh and to draw them back together the lutheran so as if there was ever a big break with rome that would be it but many lutheran nominations have renewed ties with the vatican pentecostals charismatics and if we look about this is a this is a pope who's all about gathering people in i mean this pope writes encyclicals not just about doctrinal matters but about climate change he's associating himself with every woke popular cause this is a man this is this is an office who'll be gathering people together and what's going to be happening brother braham talks about the message christ is the mystery this would be an or an organizational association of ministers to make an image to the beast as the bible said a lot of people who might not go and worship there in the vatican they'll be worshiping in their own churches but they've they've made an image to the beast and they're in their protestant churches which brings the worship back to the beast himself what shall we do with jesus brother branham says today the protestants are throwing themselves together in the ecumenical council doing the same thing grafting in tradition of man instead of taking the word of god which is thoroughly identified by the holy ghost he's the same yesterday today and forever the church stand in the balance today and is found wanting your back and pilates judgment hall yes sir what does it do it's making an image to the beast it's a satellite to rome when the ecumenical council is forcing and will force every protestant nomination to do it he says what is it protestant harlots with the old mother rome the great this protestant nomination to do that what do we need today i would say that we need the wake-up call of matthew 25. we look in revelation chapter 3. i'm closing here so if musicians want to come you you're welcome to verse 14 under the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things set the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot the legacy in church i would say is nice nice isn't hot not nice not cold it's just nice water that's what the legacy in church is so then because you're lukewarm just nice not on fire for god just nice i'll spew the out of my mouth because you say i'm rich increased with goods have need of nothing i'm exercising the american dream fulfilling the american dream in my church because you think you you feel good about yourself you think you think you're great you don't know that you're wretched miserable poor blind and naked what's his advice i countless the buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich true riches white raiment that you'll be clothed that the shame of your naked does not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see that i salve is what we need and it can be i understand um i'm putting on a tape brother branham sometimes that can be a hard voice it can it can rub against the grain it can make you feel uncomfortable sometimes that's what we need and i would just encourage you take a look at make time for god make time to play a to play a tape make time to read a message because you know what we ask just like the scribes and pharisees they had their idea of what they want how they wanted god to come they wanted him to come on a white charger knocking the heads of all the romans off and sometimes we wish perhaps people would wish that god would have seen a theologian who could give a well-reasoned explanation of this or that god didn't send a theologian god sent a prophet he's in the prophet within the anointing and that's what we need because the anointing of the world it's everywhere you go into you go through the stores you you peruse your phone that anointing is there i need this i need that distractions i think i don't have time for god we think we don't have time to do this well how can i do it brother i'd say take on you take a look on your phone there's usually a screen time app they say how much time do i spend on my phone if you're talking three or four hours try just giving 10 percent of that because we've got that that time that we spent on our screen that's usually disposable time where you could be doing something else but you're just vegging just give a little bit of that time because i don't have time check how much time you actually have on your app it'll tell you how much time you actually have and there's probably something better we can do with that time by listing god that's described our day with such clarity and the devil has pushed that aside getting us to push that aside maybe our last slide sorry what's the uh what's the solution second corinthians 3 18 we all with open face beholdings in the glass the glory of the lord as we behold the glory of god we're changed into that same image from glory to glory get the true accurate image of god before you look at him next slide and that'll tell you who you're supposed to be who are you supposed to be i think i can't do it i'm a sorry excuse for a christian but if you start looking in god's word his word will tell you what you're going to be where you're supposed to be who your daddy is that's where you need to go amen let's stand and pray heavenly father thank you very much lord for for your word father i thank you lord that you've given us exactly what we need lord i thank you for a message that goes and and wakes the sleeping person up that says the bridegroom's coming go out to meet him go out to meet and the bridegroom's coming as long as we can just roll over and look at our phone and see what's going on i'm too tired to go out to meet him no the bridegroom's coming go out to meet him lord i pray o father you would shake us also wake us lord that we might see where we are paul said the last days won't come upon you except unless this this thing happens first or someone's going to be set up in the temple of god calling himself as though he were god even though he's not and we see that happening check or we see these things happening around us we see you being pushed out i mean there in the laodicean church age brother brethren said look christ is on the outside of the church and if we look at the doctrine of moralistic therapeutic deism that's preached and believed by many christians today you're not in it you're outside that church knocking to get in lord i pray o father that you would anoint our eyes with isaf lord i pray that you would help us to take time each day to spend with you because my atmosphere of the world is just like a poison gas you can go into your house get a gas leak you won't realize it you'll be affected by you'll be sickened by it help us lord have our eyes anointed each and every day lord breathing the pure heir of your word oh god lord i pray that when we do that we may not even understand everything we listen to oh i've heard this a gift through the sermon so many times he's still in this story again i don't care because there's a spirit with it god is moving with that there's an anointing upon it i want that anointing because he says anoint your eyes with eyes anointing is available just want to say if there's anybody that says war pray for me i need that i need that anointing upon my eyes raise your hand i'll pray for you because i've had a hard time before in the past i've had a hard time accepting the message because it seems so hard and rough sometimes i understand that but that's what we need help me to accept what god's given yes i'll pray for you on that i know what you're saying lord i thank you for each heart lord who's sensitive and open lord i pray that you'd move and but as we take a step toward you your word says you will take a step toward us and we can't even take a step toward you without you pulling on our heart first it all starts with you if you're here today god's working on your heart it's god you can't have come to church without god working and pulling you in some way recognize that you are a daughter of god you're a child of god god has a plan for your life wonder who am i i'm so confused look on the word of god because that is the only true accurate image of who we are i pray oh god you would help us to stare into that gaze upon it we might be changed more and more in your image each and every day o god bless each heart i pray in jesus name amen open my lord [Music] we want to see jesus to reach out and touch [Music] to say that we love [Music] open my ears and help us to open my eyes [Music] lord we want to see jesus [Music] open my eyes [Music] i want to see jesus [Music] to reach out and touching [Music] to say that we love [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] will you give us one do you have a song do you have a song do you have
