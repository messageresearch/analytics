[0:00] and uh
[0:01] i forgot a couple announcements
[0:03] a sunday
[0:05] uh completely forgot them i know that's
[0:07] hard to believe after all the
[0:08] announcements i made
[0:10] but uh i wanted to mention a couple real
[0:12] important things that i had forgotten
[0:13] that is on the 21st on sunday afternoon
[0:15] from 4-7 they're going to celebrate a
[0:18] time for philip and tabitha getting
[0:19] married
[0:20] back here and it will be in lima at the
[0:23] bible believer's school so i'd like to
[0:25] encourage you to go i know i got to
[0:27] attend the wedding but all of you didn't
[0:29] and so if you could support that and go
[0:31] down though i'm sure they'll have some
[0:32] food there and fellowship but philip and
[0:35] tabitha got married here a couple weeks
[0:36] ago two or three weeks ago and that's on
[0:39] february february november 21st and
[0:42] that's on a sunday afternoon so the 21st
[0:45] and then
[0:46] uh i also forgot to mention starts
[0:48] planning ahead for december 5th on
[0:50] sunday afternoon the lord suffered
[0:52] together december 5th the deacons wanted
[0:54] me to announce that and then we had
[0:57] eight or nine families out sunday and
[1:00] some of it was this coffin thing going
[1:02] through the kids and so
[1:04] uh looks like the lord's healing them
[1:06] rapidly and some are back already i know
[1:08] joe's family was healed today and looked
[1:10] a lot better jose so we thank the lord
[1:12] for his healing touch and we just want
[1:14] to continue to pray but we had so many
[1:16] out that i'm going to send the link to
[1:18] all of you by text of what i talked
[1:20] about sending a little bit of church
[1:22] order a little bit of parents watching
[1:24] over the children a little better for
[1:25] our services so if i send that to you
[1:28] that's not what you send to the trash
[1:32] you should listen to that all the
[1:33] families that missed and we'll might
[1:35] send it by email and text and make sure
[1:36] you listen that because that was
[1:37] important from the deacons and i that we
[1:40] set some order for some things
[1:42] and so if you do that we'd appreciate it
[1:44] that's all the announcements so let's
[1:45] read first kings chapter 22
[1:49] amen are you glad to be here tonight
[1:52] wonderful presence here tonight of the
[1:53] lord and we're glad to be a part of
[1:56] his kingdom and a part of just to sit
[1:59] sit at his table tonight to be able to
[2:01] be fed
[2:02] amen
[2:04] and they continue three years verse one
[2:06] they continue three years without war
[2:08] between syria and israel and it came to
[2:11] pass in the third year that jehoshaphat
[2:13] the king of judah came down to the king
[2:15] of israel and the king of israel said
[2:18] unto his servants know ye that rhemath
[2:20] in gilead is ours
[2:22] and we be still and take it not out of
[2:25] the hand of the king of syria and he
[2:27] said unto jehoshaphat will thou go with
[2:29] me to battle to remember gilead and
[2:31] jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i
[2:34] am is our thou art my people as thy
[2:36] people my horses as thy horses and
[2:39] jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel
[2:42] inquire i pray thee at the word of the
[2:45] lord today
[2:47] so i'm on the subject of accountability
[2:50] and here we have jehoshaphat
[2:53] and he's trying to make a link here with
[2:55] ahab or at least ahab is asking him
[2:57] which a king
[2:58] which is the king of israel that is now
[3:00] under a curse from elijah
[3:02] and he's at uh he's asking jehoshaphat
[3:05] to join with them in a worthy cause and
[3:07] is something that's actually he's saying
[3:09] is true that we need to take this land
[3:11] but jehoshaphat now says something that
[3:14] ahab didn't think of ahab's a long ways
[3:16] now from inquiring of the lord being
[3:19] accountable to the lord going to the
[3:21] lord but jehoshaphat still has something
[3:24] within him that says
[3:26] great i'll go with you my horses are
[3:28] your horses but you know what
[3:30] we need to be accountable and go and
[3:33] find out what the lord says
[3:36] amen
[3:37] then the king of israel gathered the
[3:38] prophets together about 400 men and said
[3:41] unto them shall i go up against rhema
[3:44] gilead into battle or shall i forbear
[3:46] and they said go up for the lord shall
[3:49] deliver it into the hand of the king so
[3:51] he got a green light for all the 400
[3:53] prophets
[3:55] and jehoshaphat said
[3:57] is there not here a prophet of the lord
[4:00] besides
[4:01] that we might inquire of him that took
[4:03] something very deep within jehoshaphat
[4:05] after 400 hebrew
[4:08] trained prophets
[4:11] after 400 this man is still saying
[4:15] all right
[4:17] but can i get some more counsel
[4:21] that's pretty amazing
[4:24] and most anybody would say
[4:26] 400 we're in let's do it
[4:30] but but
[4:31] jehoshaphat is feeling uneasy in his
[4:33] spirit
[4:34] and when you're feeling uneasy in your
[4:36] spirit sometimes you don't need to
[4:38] proceed you need to wait until god has
[4:41] really settled your spirit
[4:44] is that okay with everybody
[4:46] and so jehoshaphat is being accountable
[4:49] jehoshaphat is being accountable by
[4:51] consulting the lord a little bit deeper
[4:53] and then you know the story if you don't
[4:56] chapter
[4:57] verse 7 says
[4:59] jehoshaphat said is there not here a
[5:01] prophet lord besides that we might
[5:02] inquire and the king of israel said unto
[5:04] jehoshaphat there is yet one man
[5:07] micah the son of imla by whom we may
[5:10] inquire the lord but i hate him
[5:15] i want you to beat around the bush a
[5:16] little bit ahab you know
[5:18] i want you just come right out and say
[5:20] it
[5:21] but i hate him look now this is a king
[5:23] of israel friends
[5:25] and he's able to decipher in his spirit
[5:28] that i like all these prophets but this
[5:30] prophet i hate him
[5:34] for he does not prophesy good concerning
[5:37] me
[5:38] but evil
[5:41] and jehoshaphat said let not the king
[5:44] say so
[5:46] so as much as people through the
[5:47] generations maybe have criticized
[5:49] jehoshaphat and he had his times there's
[5:52] something deeper in jehoshaphat that's
[5:54] actually deeper than ahab
[5:56] and that is let's wait a little while
[5:59] and let's just make sure
[6:02] he's being accountable to the true word
[6:04] of god
[6:05] before he moves lord bless your word
[6:07] tonight minister through it we pray and
[6:09] we just pray on anointing it father for
[6:12] all the ears that would hear
[6:13] in the name of jesus christ amen god
[6:16] bless you
[6:22] so tonight i'm this is part two of
[6:24] accountability
[6:25] and i want to be a bit more specific i
[6:27] want to share some scriptures with you
[6:29] and i want to be a more specific and
[6:32] when we when we use the word
[6:33] accountability it's not that we will be
[6:35] accountable to god someday at judgment
[6:38] we will all the world will as i said and
[6:40] it's not other types of accountability
[6:43] this is i'm more specific i would be
[6:45] saying it
[6:46] making yourself accountable making
[6:48] yourself accountable that's really more
[6:51] a specific title but this is
[6:53] accountability part two and it's making
[6:55] yourself accountable and if i can say it
[6:57] another way it's it's it you you have an
[7:01] intentional
[7:02] honest exposure to the light of god's
[7:06] counsel in other words you've learned to
[7:08] grow and live life with an intentional
[7:11] honest exposure to the light of god's
[7:14] counsel and you do it intentionally you
[7:17] expose you're not afraid to show you're
[7:20] not afraid to expose your life to the
[7:22] light you're not afraid to expose
[7:24] yourself before god as far as your
[7:26] everything that you are your life is an
[7:29] open book and also to the body of christ
[7:32] and brothers that you trust and sisters
[7:34] that you trust you're not afraid to be
[7:36] honest and exposed to the light that we
[7:38] would be within them i'll say it another
[7:40] way uh if that wasn't good enough uh
[7:43] it's it's intentionally
[7:45] probing god
[7:47] for all the input
[7:49] you can get for decisions and how to
[7:52] live
[7:54] it's intentionally probing god for all
[7:58] the input you can get for decisions and
[8:01] how to live
[8:03] it's an intentional probing of god lord
[8:05] i'm staying staying with this i really
[8:08] want an answer from you
[8:10] and not a lot of people on the face of
[8:12] the earth will do that we know there's a
[8:13] lot of people in the face there that
[8:15] don't believe in god and then there's
[8:16] the ones that believe in god that think
[8:18] he's a distant god they basically make
[8:20] decisions every day on their own for
[8:22] everything in life and the only time
[8:23] they address god is when they're in
[8:25] emergency or at christmas or at easter
[8:27] at church or wherever they go but there
[8:30] is also a group of people on the face of
[8:32] the earth that have are intentionally
[8:34] probing and wanting the more faith of
[8:36] god in their hearts they wanted more of
[8:38] god they want to see a revival in their
[8:40] heart they want god to be real to them
[8:42] and they want god to be so real that he
[8:45] can come and counsel and give them
[8:47] leadership in every area of their lives
[8:51] and that's not just some pipe dream
[8:53] god can give you leadership in every
[8:56] area of your life
[8:58] do you believe that if you don't believe
[9:00] that then you won't go to god for
[9:01] everything in your life
[9:03] but there is a group of people and i
[9:05] just love that now let me remind you of
[9:07] the scripture in uh john chapter 3 and
[9:09] verse 21 and we read it out of the
[9:11] amplified they can put it up in the king
[9:13] james it's john 3 21 and it's after john
[9:16] 3 16 and he talks about that but this
[9:18] was really amazing i want to remind you
[9:19] of the scripture john 3 21 and this you
[9:22] can read it there but here's in the
[9:24] amplified but whoever practices truth
[9:26] and does what is right morally ethically
[9:29] spiritual i like to word it that whoever
[9:31] is a
[9:32] coming around truth or embraces truth
[9:35] comes to the light when you come to
[9:37] truth you come to light
[9:39] not darkness can you say amen
[9:41] here's how it's worded
[9:43] whoever comes to the truth comes to
[9:45] light so that his works may be plainly
[9:48] shown to be what they are
[9:51] accomplished
[9:53] in god accomplished so
[9:55] so it's proving that your works and
[9:57] what's coming from your life is actually
[10:00] accomplished because you're in the light
[10:02] and because you're giving the glory to
[10:03] god it's being accomplished by god it's
[10:06] not being accomplished by you it's not
[10:08] because of your energy's successes but
[10:11] things are being accomplished by god in
[10:12] your life because you choose to live in
[10:14] the light and you're living in the light
[10:17] and it says that it's accomplished by
[10:19] god and this is what i like divinely
[10:21] prompted
[10:22] done by god's help with god's help in
[10:25] dependence on him
[10:27] the part i liked was divinely prompted
[10:30] in other words if you're living in the
[10:31] light you can to be divinely prompted to
[10:34] do the right things
[10:36] so what a wonderful thing to come to the
[10:38] light we'll walk in the light beautiful
[10:41] light come where the dew drops of mercy
[10:44] are bright when you come to the word you
[10:46] come to the light you live in the light
[10:48] you stay in the light you're around the
[10:51] word of the hour you feed on the worthy
[10:53] hour it's every that light is allowed to
[10:56] be everywhere in your
[10:58] life it's most of what you expose
[11:02] yourself to it's it's most of your phone
[11:05] time it's it's mostly where he's at is
[11:07] where you want to be
[11:08] it's mostly mostly in your life trying
[11:11] to be around the people of god who
[11:14] that's who you want to be around it's
[11:16] his works uh and it's his decisions
[11:19] because you're divinely prompted and
[11:22] they're in your decisions and your works
[11:25] in your life are done with god's help
[11:28] because
[11:29] you're walking in the light
[11:31] what a place to be in
[11:33] so we spoke last week of our
[11:35] accountability to god
[11:37] and according to these scriptures and
[11:39] many more we are accountable to the word
[11:43] and even to the people of god
[11:46] how many believe that
[11:47] hopefully i can show you some scriptures
[11:48] tonight to show that we're not only
[11:50] accountable to the word and that's
[11:51] number one we should live our lives
[11:53] looking and probing for what's the word
[11:55] say on it what's god said about it
[11:58] in everything in life we're accountable
[12:00] to say i don't run off here and exclude
[12:03] this this is this is the absolute of my
[12:05] life
[12:06] this is the center of my life christ
[12:09] reveals himself through the word and
[12:11] this thing this is not just a book on my
[12:13] coffee table this is my life this is
[12:16] what influences my life so now you can't
[12:19] let it sit on the coffee table and get
[12:21] the instruction out of it you got to
[12:23] open it you got to say now lord show me
[12:25] out of your word how to do things show
[12:27] me out of your word how to make this
[12:29] decision
[12:30] show me out of your word how to choose
[12:32] and made in life
[12:34] show me out of your word the type of job
[12:36] to have the type of career they have
[12:37] what is your will for this can you say
[12:39] man
[12:40] and so the the the the word is the main
[12:43] thing in life in other words it's it's
[12:45] not just aside one of your
[12:47] responsibilities or one of your
[12:49] appointments church should not just be
[12:52] one of our appointments because if you
[12:54] live in the flesh if it's just one of
[12:56] your appointments of life if you live
[12:58] fleshly you're going to be tired to come
[13:00] to church but not tired to go everywhere
[13:03] else
[13:04] oh should i preach a little bit now
[13:07] you let your flesh through and you make
[13:08] churches just or reading your bible just
[13:11] a part of the schedule your flesh will
[13:14] push out things that are spiritually
[13:16] nourishing to you and it'll be the last
[13:18] on the list and it'll be after all your
[13:20] energy is gone
[13:22] when it should be the other way around
[13:25] god forgive us when we put it at the
[13:28] bottom of the list and god gets the
[13:29] leftovers
[13:31] of our
[13:32] energy and i'll raise my hand say i'm
[13:35] guilty god forgive me for giving you the
[13:38] leftovers of my energy that i'm laying
[13:40] there and i'm gonna try to open my bible
[13:42] at 10 11 o'clock at night after i've
[13:44] wore myself out and i try to open my
[13:46] bible and i'm trying to keep my eyes
[13:48] open i've i've given god the last of
[13:51] everything
[13:54] the leftovers
[13:57] you know how many like fresh fruit and
[13:59] not leftovers
[14:01] sometimes they can be okay but there's
[14:03] nothing like freshly cooked food
[14:05] hopefully this is fresh for you tonight
[14:08] the bride doesn't have to have leftovers
[14:10] by the way
[14:11] god's prepared a feast can you say amen
[14:14] god's prepared a seven course meal seven
[14:17] seals can you say amen and so we're
[14:19] feeding on a feast but we've got to make
[14:21] our priorities right that we don't give
[14:23] god the leftovers and we've got to make
[14:25] him the center of our life we've got to
[14:27] give him the the best of our energy if
[14:29] we if we just
[14:30] schedule god in and some people are very
[14:32] scheduled everything's scheduled in
[14:34] their life some people are not nothing's
[14:36] scheduled and so we won't talk about
[14:39] who's who but you know there's there's
[14:41] extremes on both sides
[14:44] and you can get yourself
[14:45] carnal on both sides
[14:48] not ordering your life because god's a
[14:50] god of order yes but you can so overly
[14:53] schedule yourself that you you don't
[14:55] tend to schedule the right things in and
[14:57] you know god really doesn't need to be
[15:00] scheduled in
[15:01] he'll ought to be allowed to interrupt
[15:04] any of your schedule
[15:07] you know none of this is in my notes
[15:08] tonight i don't know why god's pulling
[15:10] this out of me through you but i'm
[15:11] telling you
[15:13] god should not have to give the
[15:14] leftovers
[15:16] get the leftovers can you say man
[15:18] and if he chooses just like sunday when
[15:21] i was preaching here i had i only
[15:22] finished a half of what i was going to
[15:24] preach but i'll tell you i'm learning
[15:26] when the lord comes down and starts to
[15:28] move in that moment it's time to stop
[15:30] and let the lord move
[15:33] who cares you've got another rest of the
[15:35] sermon if he's moving in and the subject
[15:37] has come to the heart by jesus christ
[15:39] then you gotta you you've got to say
[15:41] lord now what are you doing here it's
[15:43] time to step away here let god do his
[15:45] work and we need to be open to god
[15:48] interrupting our schedule sometimes
[15:51] you know i find people oh i'm going to
[15:53] get in trouble tonight but i find people
[15:55] can schedule their whole month doctor
[15:57] visits everything else they would never
[15:59] miss some of this stuff for nothing in
[16:01] the world and yet they can miss a lot of
[16:04] important things of meeting with the
[16:06] lord
[16:09] praise the lord
[16:11] so
[16:13] the christians works and decisions are
[16:15] divinely prompted and are done with
[16:17] god's help because they're walking in
[16:19] light and so now according to these
[16:21] scriptures
[16:22] it's not just accountable to the word
[16:24] though it's it's to god's people and
[16:26] i've seen so many people say
[16:28] sometimes even within our own
[16:31] uh message believers
[16:33] they they they say i believe the message
[16:36] and yet they don't answer to anybody
[16:43] i could say this i only answer to god
[16:45] and there's some truth to that but when
[16:48] it goes extreme and says i believe god
[16:51] but i don't answer to anybody i'm going
[16:53] to show you some scriptures tonight that
[16:55] poke holes in that belief
[16:59] because there is an accountability that
[17:01] we have
[17:03] to one another
[17:05] is that okay
[17:07] now we've taken on some worldly
[17:09] principles sometimes and uh you know
[17:11] just like the one that we can we when we
[17:13] reach the age of 18
[17:16] and that is often emphasized when we
[17:18] reach the age of 18
[17:20] then you know i can do what i want i'm
[17:22] not under anybody anymore i'm not under
[17:24] any headship anymore i can do this i can
[17:27] the words i can drink or i can do
[17:29] whatever the ages are in each state
[17:31] uh and so then that's the
[17:34] teenager hangs on to that because
[17:36] somebody we don't know who said it we
[17:38] don't have set the age but somebody
[17:40] taught that there's this age that you
[17:41] reach that you don't have to listen to
[17:43] your parents
[17:45] that you don't have to listen to anybody
[17:47] anymore you're on your own you're an
[17:48] adult and probably if you're saying at
[17:51] 18 day one i don't have to listen
[17:53] anymore any to anybody more you're not
[17:56] an adult
[17:58] but somebody says your age says you're
[17:59] an adult you're not an adult just
[18:01] because the way you're talking
[18:03] i don't have to listen to my parents
[18:05] when i reach that you guys have told me
[18:07] all this stuff but i'm finished with it
[18:08] i'm going to do it so they get that in
[18:09] mind who taught you that age you didn't
[18:11] get it from the
[18:12] bible so this world teaches principles
[18:16] of unaccountability that will reach a
[18:18] time of unaccountability brother brown
[18:20] talk debate about the age of
[18:22] accountability come like 12 13 years old
[18:25] in all this life your parents been
[18:26] teaching you things but then god i
[18:28] really believe god begins to move on a
[18:30] young teenager's heart 11 12 13. he
[18:33] called it the age of accountability 13
[18:36] and he even said himself he said listen
[18:38] he said i he says i would have given my
[18:40] heart to the to the lord at age 12. now
[18:43] he wouldn't have given his heart unless
[18:44] god was moving on him god was starting
[18:47] to speak and there's something about god
[18:48] beginning to will you because you're
[18:50] you're leaving that part of you're
[18:52] leaving that part of just saying saying
[18:55] i do this because of mom dad then god
[18:57] begins to move on you say well why are
[18:59] you doing this
[19:00] do you love me do you want to do it
[19:02] because of me and god would you to say
[19:04] come and follow me
[19:07] and it's the age of accountability but
[19:08] we have ages set that will come out of
[19:11] accountability the world teaches you
[19:13] you'll have a time where you don't have
[19:15] to be accountable to anybody you can do
[19:17] what you want you can say what you want
[19:19] you can wear what you want i can do my
[19:21] own thing and i'm telling you it's the
[19:23] lie of the world to bring you out from
[19:25] underneath some kind of protection and
[19:29] guidance
[19:31] and when you really learn about
[19:33] the shepherd
[19:35] jesus christ
[19:36] and you know his loving guidance
[19:39] then you decide
[19:40] i never
[19:42] want to be
[19:43] without the shepherd's care
[19:45] there is no age that i would want to be
[19:48] out of that
[19:50] i'll say it this way i i've learned
[19:52] about the conviction of the holy spirit
[19:53] that the word can correct me and take
[19:55] the hide off me and i would never want
[19:58] to be away from that place that he can
[20:01] convict my heart
[20:03] give me a good uh spiritual spanking and
[20:06] correct me and
[20:07] i would never want to be outside of the
[20:10] realm of his correction because his
[20:12] correction is his protection
[20:14] now that's hard on some of you young
[20:16] teens tonight listening to me on the
[20:17] internet or here tonight in the service
[20:19] it's a little bit difficult thing to
[20:21] swallow i'm not asking you to swallow it
[20:23] i'm asking you to consider what
[20:25] authority and what accountability really
[20:27] is and don't let the world interpret you
[20:29] that there's some age you know the bad
[20:30] part of it is is when teenagers buy into
[20:33] the whirly thing that 18 i'm done and i
[20:35] don't have to be accountable the real
[20:36] bad part is when parents buy into that
[20:38] idea you got to do what i say until
[20:41] you're 18. and then you're on your own
[20:43] buddy
[20:44] so parents buy into it
[20:47] you may have never heard this before
[20:48] parent but the world set that age and
[20:51] you should never ever say that to your
[20:54] child
[20:56] repent if you said it because you're
[20:58] teaching your child there's a place that
[20:59] i reach that i don't have to be
[21:01] accountable to anybody
[21:04] and when you become a christian you're
[21:05] always accountable
[21:08] to the lord
[21:10] and god with skin on
[21:12] and you want to be you want to be
[21:14] how many testimonies do we have in our
[21:16] church
[21:17] that they could stand and say brother
[21:19] paul preached that to the young people
[21:20] because
[21:21] i've got scars on my life of when i was
[21:24] a teenager and took that very mentality
[21:27] i'm headed out as soon as i turned 18
[21:29] and they can give testimonies of the
[21:31] scars in their life because they bought
[21:33] into that
[21:36] even tonight i can ask for testimonies
[21:38] and they would do it just with a cry in
[21:39] their heart to say that whole thing of
[21:43] just
[21:44] doing your own thing is such
[21:47] a
[21:49] shallow
[21:50] thing to buy into
[21:54] amen
[21:56] so i'm taking my time because i realized
[21:59] that i'm not going to get through all
[22:00] this even tonight
[22:02] but we're having a good time anyway
[22:05] the world's at that age get it out of
[22:07] our minds that there's a time we reach
[22:09] where we're out from authority
[22:11] i'm so blessed to know people that are
[22:13] 60 70 80 years old
[22:16] that are submissive still
[22:20] 60 70 80 90 years old and they're
[22:23] submissive to god's authority his word
[22:26] they're corrected brother lonnie jenkins
[22:28] was one of them and gone on with the
[22:29] lord now but i would talk to him and
[22:31] every once while sometimes he'd say
[22:32] something like yes i always the great
[22:35] teacher of god we need a brother another
[22:37] brother lonnie he was awesome mentored
[22:40] me wonderful man of god and teacher and
[22:43] teachers can probe sometimes into
[22:45] teaching and doctrinal things but i love
[22:47] to hear him say every now and then he
[22:49] says i always thought about that way but
[22:51] he said the other day the lord corrected
[22:53] me and i had to quit preaching it that
[22:55] way and preach it more perfect
[22:57] we were talking 70 years old 75 years
[23:00] old
[23:01] what does that a man that has learned
[23:03] accountability
[23:05] a man that has learned that we never
[23:07] ever reach age brother paul if it's not
[23:10] 18 what age is it then
[23:12] i want to know if you're changing the
[23:14] age where i do my own thing what age are
[23:17] you setting i'm not setting an age
[23:22] because you don't know it yet but when
[23:24] you learn how loving christ's leadership
[23:27] is you never want to be outside of his
[23:30] protection and leadership
[23:32] you never want to be in a place that you
[23:34] can't be convicted by the holy spirit
[23:35] anymore that your heart is being
[23:37] challenged
[23:39] by his presence you don't ever want to
[23:41] be out of that
[23:42] that's why we come to church
[23:44] judgment begins at the house of god am i
[23:46] not reading a scripture judgment begins
[23:49] at the house of god
[23:51] so we're being judged you know why i
[23:52] want to be judged now you know why i
[23:53] want the word to judge me now and i'm
[23:55] corrected now because whosoever is
[23:57] judged here won't be judged on the other
[23:59] side in other words we're the bride's
[24:00] receiving her judgment now the bride's
[24:02] receiving her correction now
[24:05] matter of fact when you're born again
[24:07] you've passed that judgment and passed
[24:08] unto eternal life so as far as the soul
[24:11] god doesn't judge you anymore because
[24:13] you've accepted christ
[24:15] but the judging and correcting is
[24:17] because we live in these bodies and we
[24:18] always need correction as many as i love
[24:21] i rebuke
[24:23] i don't need to be rebuked i'm saved
[24:26] i've got eternal life no no it says as
[24:28] many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[24:33] be zealous therefore
[24:35] and
[24:37] repent
[24:38] repent
[24:40] amen so we need to get that out of our
[24:43] minds i don't know why labor on that
[24:44] point but i did so so i'd like to make
[24:47] some points now on what we should about
[24:49] consulting the lord okay
[24:52] sometimes that it is an accountability
[24:56] consulting the lord sometimes is an
[24:59] accountability to the right people
[25:02] it's a god with skin on
[25:04] and god can use men
[25:07] and women
[25:08] to give you leadership
[25:11] god can use the right people can you say
[25:13] amen
[25:14] now god can use flesh god can speak
[25:17] through lips of flesh
[25:19] the devil can also speak through lips of
[25:21] flesh
[25:22] so now when we get in the territory of
[25:24] listening to people we really have to
[25:26] have a discerning heart because
[25:28] we have to know that this council is
[25:30] coming from the lord
[25:32] because you can think this is coming
[25:33] from the lord so we have to be very
[25:34] discerning because there's some people
[25:36] in the flesh can guide you wrong and we
[25:38] have every good motive and intention so
[25:41] i want to talk a little bit about that
[25:43] and so we we we just we realized that we
[25:46] want to have god using flesh sometimes
[25:49] but never uh we know that the devil can
[25:53] use flesh sometimes but we never want to
[25:55] eliminate the body and who god can speak
[25:58] through
[25:59] god sometimes can actually speak through
[26:02] strange
[26:03] sources
[26:06] like
[26:07] a donkey
[26:11] for a better term instead of the
[26:12] scriptural term
[26:14] like a donkey
[26:16] and balaam was so proud
[26:19] balaam didn't see
[26:21] god trying to say something and he kept
[26:23] fighting against it because he never
[26:25] could see god can't speak through a
[26:27] donkey i can't believe this this is just
[26:29] you know but he is so proud he says i
[26:31] only listen to god through certain
[26:33] sources when i go to church or i do this
[26:36] and he was a prophet remember i only
[26:38] listen to god when he gives me a dream i
[26:40] only listen to god when he gives me a
[26:41] vision i only listen to god when i do
[26:43] this well here's a donkey and he had to
[26:45] humble himself as he was fighting
[26:46] against the will of god so much
[26:49] bible said balaam fell flat on his face
[26:53] and let me say to you you keep bucking
[26:55] against god trying to warn you you will
[26:58] fall flat on your face
[27:00] like balaam
[27:02] so we have to be open to god speaking
[27:05] through different sources sometimes i've
[27:07] had that happen so the next scriptures
[27:09] that i'm going to bring up to you and
[27:10] they will bring them on the screen i
[27:12] want to lay it down that it's not just
[27:14] that we're alone
[27:16] and we're not accountable to other
[27:18] people it's not just we're alone with
[27:20] our bibles and not accountable to the
[27:23] spirit of god in others
[27:25] prophets often go in the desert
[27:27] they have to receive the word alone they
[27:29] don't get it by counsel or by
[27:32] certain board members or denominations
[27:34] prophets are built special where they
[27:36] gotta they go on the back side of the
[27:38] desert and they get the word directly
[27:40] from god they can't consult with men
[27:43] they can only consult with god don't
[27:45] borrow too much of that for yourself
[27:46] that i'm just gonna i don't need to
[27:48] listen to any preachers i don't need to
[27:51] listen a lot of people don't listen to
[27:52] preachers i don't need to listen to any
[27:54] preacher i don't need to go to any
[27:56] church i don't need the body of christ i
[27:57] just need my bible and when i need to
[27:59] get something from god i go off in the
[28:01] desert that's a prophet
[28:04] there's too many other scriptures to say
[28:05] if you're not a prophet there's other
[28:06] ways that god's going to correct you
[28:08] including the fivefold ministry and
[28:10] don't let me say correction
[28:13] he's going to encourage you he's going
[28:14] to grow you he's going to edify you
[28:18] he sent gifts
[28:20] from heaven to you can you say amen
[28:23] he says i'll give them gifts of prophets
[28:25] and apostles and teachers evangelists
[28:27] and pastors a five-fold ministry five is
[28:30] grace god's grace to you is the true
[28:32] fifo ministry brother brahman says a
[28:35] pastor ordained of god he's ordained to
[28:37] lead you through all the way to the
[28:39] other side
[28:42] hallelujah god gives those gifts can you
[28:46] say amen
[28:47] and so now we're not alone with our
[28:49] bibles unaccountable i can stay home
[28:51] with my bible or be on the backside of
[28:53] the desert i just tell you anybody any
[28:56] family member if you're listening here
[28:58] tonight you're going to see by the
[29:00] scriptures that is no way a christian
[29:02] perspective it's not a christian
[29:04] principle and you're going to get
[29:05] yourself in trouble through the years
[29:07] taking that thing that i don't need
[29:09] anybody else we
[29:11] are accountable to the word and
[29:14] accountable to the body of jesus christ
[29:19] so let's go into it a little bit
[29:21] we should never get alone
[29:23] but never l we should you know we should
[29:26] get alone sometimes with god i believe
[29:28] in that but we should never live without
[29:30] seeking good advice from others
[29:32] and older ones
[29:35] there's a principle right in genesis
[29:37] that said in the beginning
[29:39] it's not good for man
[29:42] to be
[29:43] alone
[29:46] you know when i read that it was a
[29:47] single guy i used it
[29:49] for my singlehood
[29:51] praise the lord thus saith the lord it's
[29:53] not good for a man to be alone i want to
[29:56] get married
[29:57] but
[29:58] the the principle is bigger than that
[30:01] okay
[30:03] god says it's not good
[30:06] for man to be alone
[30:08] and remember now he's going to speak his
[30:10] family he's going to speak a family into
[30:12] existence because god himself said i
[30:14] shouldn't be alone
[30:16] god didn't want to be alone god was a
[30:18] lonely god and he just began to create
[30:20] angels but then that wasn't his sons and
[30:22] daughters and so he could he could only
[30:24] he couldn't fellowship with them they
[30:25] just worshiped him all the time he
[30:27] wanted sons and daughters that he could
[30:28] fellowship with and so now this whole
[30:30] thing of creating sons and daughters of
[30:32] god because it's not good to be alone
[30:34] god didn't want to be alone and then he
[30:35] says it's not good for man to be
[30:38] alone it's not safe to be alone it's not
[30:42] right for you to be alone
[30:44] it's not right for you to be lonely can
[30:45] you say amen
[30:47] and to make yourself lonely and to make
[30:49] yourself cut off from the body of jesus
[30:52] christ it's not a principle in god and i
[30:54] can tell you if you're staying home and
[30:56] not associated and not committed
[30:59] to a post of duty and committed also to
[31:01] fellowship with other saints and
[31:03] fellowship around the world and what the
[31:04] body of christ is doing whether
[31:06] worldwide or locally if you're saying i
[31:08] don't need any of that i don't want any
[31:09] of that listen you're going against the
[31:11] principle of god he says it's not good
[31:14] for you to be alone
[31:18] so you go against that you're going to
[31:20] find out why it's not good
[31:23] why your children maybe are not in
[31:25] church eventually
[31:27] why the family might be unraveling
[31:30] because you cut yourself off
[31:33] and the pastor went over and visited the
[31:35] guy who hadn't been in church in a long
[31:37] time
[31:39] and
[31:41] he didn't say nothing he just sat by the
[31:43] fire
[31:44] and they greeted one another but he
[31:46] didn't say nothing
[31:48] and he went up to the fire and took one
[31:50] of the sticks out hot coals and hot
[31:53] hot stick and he took it and set it over
[31:55] to the side and after about 10 minutes
[31:58] there wasn't any fire there wasn't any
[32:00] redness there wasn't anything in that
[32:02] stick
[32:04] but the fire was still going strong
[32:06] and when he laid it it'd become cold
[32:08] after a while become cold there was no
[32:10] fire in it and it's because he wasn't
[32:12] close to the fire
[32:15] pastor got up said god bless you
[32:18] that's all i wanted to say
[32:20] got his point across
[32:22] you do that you're going to hurt
[32:24] yourself
[32:28] in ecclesiastes 4 and i think they have
[32:30] the scripture for you here ecclesiastes
[32:32] 4 9 through 12 says two are better than
[32:34] one
[32:35] because they have a good reward for
[32:37] their labor that's one of the benefits
[32:39] is two are better than one because they
[32:40] have a good reward for their labor
[32:42] here's another scripture by the way that
[32:44] i used when i was single
[32:47] [Laughter]
[32:50] i had quite a few of them
[32:52] lord two are better than one i need a
[32:54] wife anyway two are better than one
[32:56] because they have a good reward for
[32:58] their labor
[33:00] for if they fall the one will lift up
[33:03] his fellow
[33:04] but woe to him that is alone when he
[33:07] falleth for he hath not another to help
[33:10] him up
[33:12] it's what is the principle it is not
[33:14] good for man to be alone
[33:17] two are better than one go back to the
[33:19] other one go back again i love this for
[33:22] if they fall one will lift the other
[33:23] fell out but woe to him that is alone
[33:24] when he falleth for he hath not another
[33:27] to help him up
[33:29] you need brothers and sisters
[33:33] why would you want to battle the devil
[33:35] alone
[33:37] why would you want to go through a
[33:38] struggle alone
[33:40] it always is amazes me and i'll say it
[33:42] and i hope people are listening but it
[33:44] always amazes me when people can through
[33:46] go through the deepest darkest times of
[33:49] their life for whatever reason and we
[33:52] all have been through that and if you
[33:53] haven't you will go through it in life
[33:56] but some people at their at the time
[33:58] they need encouragement edification
[34:02] uh building up they need somebody else's
[34:05] strength because they have no strength
[34:06] at that time many people will distance
[34:09] themself from church from the body from
[34:11] everybody and they just get alone
[34:14] at the most time they need it
[34:17] and never understand that this is the
[34:18] time you need somebody so that you can
[34:21] help somebody can help you up
[34:25] so it's accountability next one says for
[34:29] two better than one if two lie together
[34:31] then they have heat but how can they be
[34:33] warm alone
[34:35] praise the lord all of us from the north
[34:37] can say amen to that
[34:39] we probably brought down in uh africa
[34:42] and those places maybe don't it's too
[34:44] hot they don't understand this scripture
[34:46] it's so hot brother tony that they're
[34:48] saying no no you get on the other side
[34:50] i'm too hot
[34:51] but in the north this scripture is good
[34:52] for us because
[34:54] you get cold unless you got somebody up
[34:55] close to you
[34:58] you do that too okay
[35:02] i was just teasing
[35:04] you're my friend
[35:06] and if one prevail against him oh my
[35:09] goodness if one prevail against him
[35:12] two shall withstand him
[35:15] and a threefold cord is not quickly
[35:17] broken if one prevail against them well
[35:19] we got somebody prevailing against us
[35:22] and the worst spot that you can be in
[35:25] when the devil's prevailing against you
[35:27] is to be alone
[35:31] you need help you need strength
[35:34] you need the help in the body two shall
[35:36] withstand him and threefold be
[35:38] accountable to one another bible says
[35:41] confess your faults one to another you'd
[35:43] only do that you not only do that to
[35:45] keep the devil exposed but you go to
[35:46] another brother or sister someone you
[35:48] got confidence in and say listen i'm
[35:50] battling something i want you to join
[35:52] together with me because two shall
[35:54] withstand him the devil's fighting me
[35:56] i'm making a phone call today the
[35:57] devil's really fighting me i need your
[35:59] prayers today we're going to join
[36:00] together we're going to bind together
[36:03] listen there's a lot of people in the
[36:05] message even not even doing this but
[36:07] it's you're you're missing out
[36:10] you're missing out on a principle you're
[36:12] missing out on strength
[36:15] in the body
[36:16] call and be honest i'm struggling i've
[36:19] i've i've fallen i've made a mistake
[36:21] even be honest confess your faults one
[36:24] to another so the devil's exposed and
[36:26] say i need your strength right now i
[36:28] need the lord right now i need to bind
[36:30] together two shall withstand him and a
[36:33] threefold cord is not quickly broken is
[36:36] anybody hearing what i'm saying tonight
[36:39] get yourself distant from the strength
[36:42] of other brothers and sisters
[36:46] then he goes on to say i think there's
[36:48] more to it isn't there is that it
[36:50] all right so the next one i want to go
[36:52] through these tonight and that's all the
[36:53] further we get is these scriptures so
[36:56] proverbs 11 14
[37:00] where no counsel is the people fall
[37:03] but in the multitude of counselors
[37:05] there's safety
[37:09] amen
[37:10] i know some of you knew that scripture
[37:11] but there's some that don't
[37:14] there's some
[37:15] that maybe think in the message these
[37:16] scriptures are important every scripture
[37:19] is important
[37:20] when god restored me back to the word
[37:23] i can preach on every scripture in this
[37:25] bible and it's the word of god
[37:28] somebody said years ago you only need to
[37:30] preach on the ones the prophet commented
[37:32] on how terrible brother branham would
[37:34] have said that's crazy that's that's not
[37:37] true he
[37:38] he gave us these bibles back
[37:40] i can preach on any scripture in this
[37:43] bible and this one gets overlooked but
[37:46] it's got a truth to it for your life
[37:48] where no counsel is the people fall but
[37:50] in the multitude of counselors there's
[37:52] safety
[37:57] for if they fall
[37:58] where are we at here next one proverbs
[38:01] 24 6 for by wise counsel thou shalt make
[38:04] thy war
[38:07] and in multitude of counselors there is
[38:10] safety
[38:12] proverbs 12 15
[38:14] the way of a fool is right in his own
[38:17] eyes
[38:18] but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is
[38:21] wise
[38:22] can i read it again
[38:25] the way of the fool which proverbs
[38:26] speaks quite a bit of the way of the
[38:28] fool
[38:29] is right
[38:30] in his own eyes he didn't got any input
[38:33] you need counsel so now he's bought into
[38:36] that just because he thought it it must
[38:38] be right now sometimes the lord can lead
[38:40] a person but isn't it better to see uh
[38:43] get some counsel and some input to see
[38:45] if you're going the right way because in
[38:47] your own eyes every man appears right
[38:49] and righteous in his own eyes
[38:52] all of you do it we all do it there's
[38:54] something about our human nature
[38:56] we if we're judging ourselves we always
[38:59] come out smelling pretty good
[39:03] we do
[39:04] come on now
[39:06] and
[39:07] the way of the fool is right in his own
[39:09] eyes but he that hearkeneth and that
[39:11] means listening to
[39:14] counsel
[39:15] is wise
[39:16] so we got safety in it
[39:18] we've got when people fall they can be
[39:21] built up
[39:22] we've got
[39:24] wisdom from counsel proverbs 15 22 the
[39:28] next one without counsel
[39:30] purposes are disappointed
[39:34] but in the multitude of counselors they
[39:36] are established can you imagine the
[39:38] depth of the wisdom of this scripture
[39:40] without counsel
[39:42] purposes are disappointed in other words
[39:45] you have a purpose you want to
[39:46] accomplish something you want to do
[39:48] something
[39:50] but sometimes you can set yourself up
[39:53] for disappointment because you maybe
[39:55] didn't get enough input in godly counsel
[39:59] so you set yourself up for
[40:02] disappointment
[40:04] you went it on your own didn't talk to
[40:06] me didn't go didn't consult the lord
[40:08] didn't consult someone else some good
[40:10] counsel in it and so without it your
[40:12] great purposes are disappointed you set
[40:15] yourself up for disappointment and
[40:17] there's no reason that we have to do
[40:18] that we got the word we got the message
[40:21] we got people in the congregation that's
[40:23] been through things already they've
[40:25] they've invested in things they've done
[40:27] things they've went through the school
[40:28] of hard knocks they've learned some
[40:30] things and all that wisdom is available
[40:33] to you young couples and young young
[40:35] people and even older couples it's
[40:37] available to you
[40:38] for free
[40:42] that's pretty good
[40:44] it's a good good price
[40:46] it's for free
[40:48] in the multitude of counselors
[40:50] purposes
[40:52] are established
[40:54] how many would rather have your purpose
[40:56] and what you're shooting for
[40:58] have it established on greater
[41:00] foundations
[41:02] okay
[41:02] just open yourself up to
[41:05] it might be just one or two people but
[41:06] just say i'm running this across you can
[41:08] you give me some input and give them
[41:10] full liberty tell me what you think
[41:11] about this bang bang bang bang give me
[41:13] your input a godly brother a godly
[41:16] sister galileo counsel research in the
[41:18] message of the hour everything you can
[41:20] because it's going to influence and
[41:21] establish your purpose now i'm feeling
[41:24] really good about this because it's
[41:25] established in the word of god and i got
[41:28] my brothers and sisters praying and
[41:30] after a little bit of time they're
[41:33] feeling a green light about it and i'm
[41:35] feeling stronger about it it's
[41:37] established by the word of god and good
[41:40] counsel
[41:42] and this is things that are important
[41:45] for youth
[41:46] deciding on who they marry
[41:49] oh is it ever
[41:51] what they do in life
[41:53] a home to buy
[41:54] a career to have
[41:58] how to raise the children
[42:00] i remember i said it a few weeks ago i
[42:02] know what it was so many young couples
[42:04] do not
[42:05] pull upon the wisdom of the older
[42:07] couples in the church
[42:09] to how to raise kids
[42:11] it's not like they have to tell you what
[42:12] to do but they've already been through
[42:14] it so why not use that free wisdom
[42:19] and say i got a kid and he's doing this
[42:21] and or she's doing that and
[42:23] you know he's
[42:24] pulling people's eyes out whatever you
[42:26] know he's got problems and
[42:28] you know did you ever have a kid that
[42:30] was kind of like this
[42:31] and i just want to know from you how did
[42:33] you learn from it what did you do about
[42:35] it i'm just open to some input it's okay
[42:39] they might give you a just a wisdom and
[42:42] you know how to direct that kid because
[42:43] every kid's different you have to adjust
[42:45] yourself to everyone but why can't we
[42:47] pull upon the resources
[42:50] that god has given us
[42:53] some of you listening your financial
[42:55] life has been in ruin for years because
[42:58] you won't get counsel from somebody
[43:01] that's godly and can give you direction
[43:03] on it
[43:04] you're still living from paycheck to
[43:06] paycheck
[43:07] because you're going to do it on your
[43:09] own
[43:13] you got purposes
[43:15] do you want them established
[43:18] don't set yourself up for another
[43:19] disappointment
[43:22] without counsel purposes are
[43:24] disappointed but in the multitude
[43:26] of counselors
[43:28] they are established
[43:31] i like that
[43:34] ephesians 5 21 here we go in the new
[43:37] testament submitting yourselves one to
[43:40] another in the fear of god is that
[43:42] accountability
[43:45] is that accountability
[43:48] submitting yourself one to another in
[43:51] the fear of god i don't believe that
[43:53] it's just letting everybody tell you
[43:55] what to do we misinterpret it that way
[43:57] is that you just tell have all these
[43:59] people they're telling you what to do
[44:01] that's not it you find godly counsel and
[44:03] you submit yourself he's talking about
[44:05] the body of christ then he talks about
[44:06] the wife of course to the husband and
[44:08] the guy some husband to god
[44:10] the subject is submission the subject is
[44:13] accountability we don't as christians
[44:16] live our lives on our own without a
[44:18] submission to the word and in obedience
[44:21] to the word and a submission to the word
[44:23] and to one another
[44:26] congregations submit to your pastors
[44:29] pastors submit yourself to the
[44:31] congregation
[44:34] i want to read the whole quote
[44:36] that's what he said
[44:39] submission is a part of god's kingdom
[44:41] lucifer come out from the submission
[44:43] underneath god
[44:46] satan's principle is rebellion to
[44:48] headship and authority
[44:50] god's principle is submission to the
[44:51] right authority when he sends it
[44:54] hebrews 13 7 8
[44:57] remember them which have the rule over
[44:59] you
[45:00] what
[45:02] what
[45:03] somebody what somebody has the rule over
[45:06] me
[45:08] paul's saying it in hebrews somebody has
[45:10] the rule over you
[45:13] remember them that have the rule over
[45:15] you
[45:16] who have spoken unto you the word of god
[45:19] whose faith follow
[45:22] what follow i'm not going to follow
[45:24] anybody
[45:26] the bible says there's people to follow
[45:28] paul said
[45:30] follow me
[45:31] as i follow christ and i think that's
[45:33] the strong principle i'm not going to
[45:35] follow somebody who's not following
[45:37] christ i don't have to follow somebody
[45:40] who's not following christ
[45:42] but paul said follow me as i follow
[45:45] christ you see a deeper walk in christ
[45:47] you follow that say what whatever
[45:49] they're doing however they're praying
[45:52] i'm i've got my eyes open to people like
[45:54] that and i'm watching their lives i like
[45:56] what's happening
[45:58] they're getting good they're getting
[46:00] good prosperity how many knows joshua
[46:02] one says that you'll have good
[46:04] prosperity not just prosperity in life
[46:06] that's what the world has but good
[46:08] success
[46:09] good prosperity good successes in the
[46:11] lord regular successes in the world but
[46:14] good success is something for christians
[46:17] how many want good success
[46:20] good success and you see somebody else
[46:22] in good success godly and god's blessing
[46:24] their life in every way they don't say
[46:26] well i'll just do my own thing no he
[46:28] said they're doing something right
[46:29] praise the lord help me out here
[46:31] what are you doing
[46:34] let me come over and pick your brain
[46:36] or your soul or whatever
[46:39] you're doing something right
[46:42] it's an obedience to say god can speak
[46:44] through someone else
[46:46] remember them they have the ruler who
[46:47] have spoken to you the word of god whose
[46:49] faith follow considering the end of
[46:51] their
[46:52] conversation conversation is your manner
[46:54] of life and so you're looking at them
[46:57] and watching
[46:58] their the end of their manner of life
[47:00] it's not what they speak over the pulpit
[47:01] it's not what they speak to the word of
[47:03] god anybody can speak the word of god
[47:05] this is why i preach about preachers and
[47:07] everybody else it's not just that we
[47:09] have the message in the word but
[47:11] character comes with it
[47:13] can you say amen
[47:14] the people ought to not only watch how
[47:16] good the preacher preaches and he's a
[47:18] great preacher and he's very polished
[47:21] and he can really bring that word and
[47:22] bring the mysteries i'm looking at that
[47:25] man's life as well i love what he
[47:27] preaches but let me see the end of the
[47:29] manner of his life let me see his
[47:31] attitude is pride growing up with his
[47:34] knowledge of the word i'm out i won't
[47:36] follow it
[47:37] because i'm not just following somebody
[47:39] that preaches the message today i'm
[47:40] following i'm looking for the character
[47:42] of king david i'm looking for the
[47:43] character of king jesus
[47:46] this message does not just produce
[47:48] doctrinal truth can you say mine it
[47:51] produces the character of jesus christ
[47:55] knowledge puffeth up knowledge will make
[47:57] a man more proudful knowledge will make
[47:59] a church and a man say we're advanced
[48:02] above all the other messed churches and
[48:04] when you start giving that attitude i'm
[48:06] out i'm not following it i'm not
[48:08] supporting it and may that never happen
[48:10] here may we stay humble before the lord
[48:12] that as we raise in revelation we raise
[48:15] in humility as well
[48:18] god help us to be that way we've seen so
[48:20] much of this pride even in our own ranks
[48:23] i'm so tired of it you may know all the
[48:25] mysteries of god and be able to preach
[48:27] in much better than i ever could but let
[48:29] me see the end of your conversation
[48:32] if you're preaching the word let me see
[48:35] the end of your life let me see your
[48:36] manner of life let me see your attitude
[48:44] let it be
[48:46] churches can get lifted up in pride
[48:48] that we're the best in the world
[48:50] preachers kadeta nobody's preaching
[48:53] stuff like this you're gonna have to
[48:54] come to this church to hear it what a
[48:56] shame may we stay away from all that
[48:59] if a church stays real humble brother
[49:01] brahm says
[49:03] he says you'll see the power of god
[49:04] working in that church
[49:08] fathers need to stay humble
[49:10] husbands need to stay humble
[49:13] wives need to stay humble
[49:17] remember them to have the rule over you
[49:19] and then
[49:20] the next scripture says what i'm
[49:22] preaching about hebrews 13 8 everybody
[49:24] knows that we don't have to put up jesus
[49:26] christ the same yesterday
[49:29] today
[49:30] and forever
[49:33] he doesn't change
[49:35] in his character
[49:37] in his miracles
[49:39] he can do anything he did back then
[49:41] he'll do it again today if he lived that
[49:44] way 2000 years ago we're going to see
[49:46] him live that way today
[49:48] it's not a new version of jesus it's not
[49:50] a new lord
[49:51] it's not a new jesus christ that's not a
[49:54] bible it's the same nature jesus christ
[49:57] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:03] first oh wait let me continue on
[50:05] hebrews 13
[50:07] 17 just a few scriptures down
[50:10] hebrews 13 17.
[50:12] next one
[50:17] obey them later he said obey them that
[50:20] have the rule over you
[50:22] and submit yourselves
[50:24] for they watch over your souls
[50:27] as they that must give an account that
[50:29] they may do it with joy and not with
[50:31] grief for that is unprofitable for you
[50:33] so the guy that's administering it
[50:35] should not do it for any other mode of a
[50:37] reason and they should do it with joy
[50:40] and not with grief for if they do it
[50:42] that way it's unprofitable for you so
[50:45] this is a guy that's bringing it and
[50:46] watching over your souls but then obey
[50:48] them they had rule over you see that
[50:49] character you see that life you see that
[50:51] the real care for your souls submit
[50:54] yourselves for they watch over your
[50:56] souls
[50:57] next one
[51:05] first peter 5. this is the last one here
[51:09] likewise you're younger just checking
[51:11] the time likewise you're younger submit
[51:13] yourselves unto the elder yea all of you
[51:16] be subject one to another
[51:19] have i read scriptures tonight that
[51:21] prove
[51:22] christians should be accountable
[51:27] likewise younger submit yourselves unto
[51:29] the elder
[51:30] yea all of you be subject one to another
[51:34] and be clothed with humility
[51:38] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[51:41] grace to the humble
[51:45] humble yourselves therefore unto the
[51:47] mighty hand of god that he may exalt you
[51:51] in due time now if he just talked about
[51:54] obeying those that have the rule over
[51:56] and he's in this he said that other
[51:58] scriptures but then he he comes back in
[52:00] in in first peter here and he's bringing
[52:02] the theme ye younger submit yourself
[52:05] until unto the elder
[52:07] be subject one to another and be then he
[52:10] comes and be humble now then verse seven
[52:13] says humble yourself
[52:14] casting all your care
[52:16] upon him
[52:18] for he careth for you
[52:20] look at the benefits that come from
[52:23] being submissive from being the the
[52:26] younger submitting to the elder look at
[52:28] the submission there's a care for you
[52:30] because god cares god can care for you
[52:33] and your needs
[52:35] through that
[52:37] it's how god works can you say amen
[52:40] casting all your care upon him for he
[52:42] cares for you be sober be village
[52:45] vigilant because your adversary the
[52:47] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[52:51] seeking whom he may devour
[52:55] do these things submit yourself be
[52:58] clothed with humility be subject to one
[53:01] another because why you have an
[53:03] adversary
[53:05] and you don't want to go at him alone
[53:08] now i believe
[53:10] a brother or sister that's full of faith
[53:13] i don't want to weaken this tonight
[53:15] sometimes i've seen students and people
[53:17] in the alone time grab a hold of the
[53:20] faith of god and they come against the
[53:22] devil because you are a one-man army
[53:27] i believe that
[53:28] you could have the faith to do it
[53:30] but you don't have to go it alone
[53:34] because your adversary the devil is
[53:35] rowing seeking whom he may devour
[53:37] because of that submit yourself to one
[53:39] another be subject be clothed in
[53:40] humanity humility
[53:42] and god giveth grace
[53:44] to
[53:45] the humble wonderful
[53:48] so it seems that when you choose to be
[53:50] unaccountable to god with all these
[53:52] scriptures now
[53:54] i'm going to find a place to close now
[53:57] it seems that when you choose to be
[53:58] unaccountable with godly input and
[54:00] counsel it's a danger zone that you
[54:03] enter into
[54:04] when you live this private life with no
[54:07] other eyes checking what you're doing
[54:09] you set yourself up for sin
[54:12] for stupid decisions for marrying the
[54:14] wrong person for never growing further
[54:17] in the lord by being unaccountable
[54:22] look at examples that we have today a
[54:24] girl meets a guy on the internet doesn't
[54:26] know him from sam
[54:29] develops a relationship with him
[54:32] he says he's a christian
[54:35] doesn't check him out doesn't know
[54:37] anything that's that's going on right
[54:38] now there's there's situations
[54:41] and then she won't listen to the
[54:43] the dad now she won't listen to anybody
[54:45] this is it and then she's gonna proceed
[54:47] unaccountable to anybody not watching it
[54:49] not looking at it close
[54:51] my she's she's gambling with her future
[54:56] don't you don't have to gamble with your
[54:58] future you can get good counsel
[55:01] you can look to the word of god
[55:04] you can have a strong foundation
[55:06] a girl meets a guy in the end a guy
[55:08] meets a girl on the internet and that's
[55:10] how it all happens it's a completely a
[55:12] girl starts to text a guy
[55:14] and there's no accountability to those
[55:16] texts they just text privately a lot can
[55:19] be said that's under the outside of the
[55:21] radar that shouldn't get said when
[55:24] there's no accountability in a
[55:25] relationship
[55:27] i know some of you don't like that and
[55:28] some of my own family i don't even know
[55:30] i'm not trying to preach anybody i'm
[55:32] just saying i was preaching this 32
[55:33] years ago and i'm going to continue to
[55:35] preach accountability in guy girl
[55:37] relationships in marriages marriage
[55:40] husbands and wife need to be accountable
[55:42] to one another they don't need to live a
[55:44] private life away from one another
[55:48] this accountability carries throughout
[55:50] our entire life a family needs to be
[55:53] accountable to their local church with
[55:55] their attendance and their offerings can
[55:56] you say amen there's an accountability
[55:58] that goes with this kingdom of god and a
[56:00] girl that meets a guy or a guy that
[56:02] meets a girl and it's a completely there
[56:04] is no counsel there is no input it's
[56:06] completely on their own i disagree with
[56:09] that because they're missing out on god
[56:11] being able to guide that relationship
[56:13] with other sources as well not just on
[56:15] their own
[56:18] guess what a preacher refuses to
[56:19] fellowship with other preachers
[56:22] and let his congregation fell up and let
[56:24] his congregation fellowship with other
[56:26] churches
[56:27] he refuses he holds them back from doing
[56:30] it
[56:31] it's dangerous it's a danger zone
[56:35] a boy spends all of his savings
[56:38] whole life savings on an un unreliable
[56:42] investment
[56:44] or rings up 30 000 in a credit
[56:47] for debt
[56:49] without consulting with anybody puts his
[56:52] life under a shadow of debt the rest
[56:54] many years down the road
[56:56] where he buys a fancy car way more than
[56:58] he can afford
[57:03] so you're thinking well is he talking
[57:05] about situations in the church no i come
[57:07] up with these myself
[57:10] but every one of us are susceptible to
[57:12] make foolish decisions
[57:14] when we don't seek the counsel of the
[57:15] lord
[57:17] you young people some of the older ones
[57:19] you've learned this but the young people
[57:20] listen to me you'll never go wrong in
[57:23] your relationships and your money in
[57:26] every part you'll never go around
[57:28] consulting the lord completely living in
[57:30] the light and consulting with good solid
[57:34] godly senior people
[57:37] all these decisions come from people
[57:39] that are unaccountable and living with
[57:42] no
[57:42] counsel
[57:48] say well just can't we just
[57:50] if we just have the holy ghost isn't
[57:52] that enough
[57:54] in my experience
[57:56] we have a mind
[57:58] i may not put this out to on the archive
[58:01] because i'm speaking personally and some
[58:03] of these things are just what i've
[58:04] learned
[58:05] we have a soul and if that's been
[58:07] converted by the holy ghost
[58:09] the power is in there to be able to
[58:12] guide a life can you say amen
[58:14] but you have a mind
[58:17] and you have flesh and that mind can be
[58:20] influenced
[58:21] or that mind cannot be taught yet it's
[58:23] just like i was saying to somebody the
[58:24] other day about a a young teenager
[58:27] receiving the holy spirit when they're
[58:28] young oh how wonderful it is when they
[58:30] receive the true holy spirit when
[58:31] they're young
[58:32] they say lord fill me with the holy
[58:34] ghost i need you right now
[58:36] i'm not going to wait to some other day
[58:38] i may not have the opportunity so they
[58:39] get filled with about 14 years old and
[58:42] the parents start to expect them to act
[58:44] like this fully matured person and
[58:46] christian at 14.
[58:49] that's unfair
[58:51] because even though god's done something
[58:52] real in their life
[58:54] they're still 14 years old in the head
[58:57] they still think 14 year old thoughts so
[58:59] you watch them doing something in just a
[59:01] little bit of offer saying how can you
[59:03] do that and be a holy ghost-filled
[59:04] christian
[59:05] you got to be careful of that you got to
[59:07] watch your tongue
[59:09] because they've got to grow as a human
[59:11] being in some areas
[59:13] even though god's dealt with their heart
[59:15] or god's filled them
[59:17] so it's a tragedy then to to push
[59:20] them to a certain level of of
[59:23] expectation that you should be a
[59:25] christian now and all these expectations
[59:28] come because you're a christian now
[59:32] none of us like to be put under
[59:34] unrealistic expectations
[59:37] how many had parents that put you under
[59:39] unrealistic expectations
[59:44] some of our kids aren't raising their
[59:45] hand because mom and dad's sitting
[59:46] beside
[59:50] i love it
[59:54] amen
[59:56] you can tell this subject i love it
[59:58] i could talk all night about it but i'm
[59:59] going to close
[1:00:02] the worldly principle is just
[1:00:04] we have the
[1:00:05] if we have the spirit of god
[1:00:08] we have the power within us
[1:00:10] but we have a mind
[1:00:12] and that answer that says
[1:00:15] what else do we need
[1:00:16] i've had couples say
[1:00:20] i'm not quite done yet
[1:00:22] that couple say
[1:00:23] they both got the holy ghost and that's
[1:00:25] all the council you need to give them
[1:00:26] before they're married
[1:00:29] they've got everything they need to make
[1:00:30] it through the journey
[1:00:33] i disagree with that
[1:00:35] not completely because i know that if
[1:00:37] they've been filled with the holy spirit
[1:00:38] they have the power to be able to live
[1:00:41] but you see that i've had a couple say
[1:00:45] i know we don't have a job
[1:00:47] i don't have i know we don't have
[1:00:49] anything to support the family right now
[1:00:53] but we have the holy ghost and we have
[1:00:55] love
[1:00:56] and with those two things that's all we
[1:00:58] need
[1:01:00] a lot of parents that said that
[1:01:02] and went through so many things looked
[1:01:05] back and said it's just how that's
[1:01:07] lacking wisdom in it okay i won't ask
[1:01:11] for a show of hands but you just say no
[1:01:12] no no
[1:01:13] you should approach it with a little bit
[1:01:15] more maturity than that
[1:01:17] you need a job
[1:01:20] okay because something happens in your
[1:01:22] love and you have kids
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:29] they eat
[1:01:32] right mom i ate i had to eat something
[1:01:36] you have children then you have another
[1:01:38] one then you have another one then you
[1:01:39] have sometimes it's they just keep
[1:01:41] coming
[1:01:42] and then you have to counsel and let
[1:01:44] them know what's happening and like why
[1:01:45] they keep coming
[1:01:47] find out the reason why
[1:01:50] and there's more malice to feed and it's
[1:01:52] it's responsibility that comes with it
[1:01:54] but if you be accountable to the lord
[1:01:56] early on god can give you direction not
[1:01:59] just that you're filled with the spirit
[1:02:01] but in your mind and your spirit you can
[1:02:03] lay down some
[1:02:05] biblical principles to say i'm going to
[1:02:06] follow these guidelines
[1:02:09] through the counsel of god's word and
[1:02:11] establish something and have a little
[1:02:13] bit so you don't have to be a rich man
[1:02:14] to get married you have to be rich i'm
[1:02:16] not people think well you got to be a
[1:02:17] millionaire before you can even get
[1:02:19] married to a girl
[1:02:22] my goodness no there's no end to the
[1:02:24] rules around here
[1:02:26] just in love i mean you don't have to
[1:02:27] kill it
[1:02:29] i mean my goodness you and brother barry
[1:02:31] killing romance killing love all the
[1:02:33] time
[1:02:34] we're just love we can live on love if
[1:02:36] we don't have any food we'll live on
[1:02:38] love
[1:02:42] not trying to kill anything i'm trying
[1:02:44] to get you to approach life accountable
[1:02:45] to say lord
[1:02:47] how can i jesus is all about foundations
[1:02:50] and preparations
[1:02:53] it's in the book of matthew
[1:02:56] the guy built his house on the sand
[1:02:58] guy built his house on a rock
[1:03:01] jesus is all about foundations don't
[1:03:03] build your life on sand build your life
[1:03:05] on the rock of revelation
[1:03:08] jesus is all about preparation she said
[1:03:10] what man go at the war it doesn't sit
[1:03:12] down first and count the cost can i go
[1:03:15] against this army and win
[1:03:17] instead of just we're going out we're
[1:03:19] going right now i don't know if we can
[1:03:21] do it but we're going to
[1:03:24] no jesus is about preparations what man
[1:03:27] goeth to build a house or building and
[1:03:29] doesn't sit down and count the cost can
[1:03:32] i afford this
[1:03:33] can do i have the right pieces in place
[1:03:36] can i step out and make this decision to
[1:03:38] build a house you don't say we're doing
[1:03:40] it we're doing it i don't know how we're
[1:03:41] going to do it but we're doing it praise
[1:03:43] god
[1:03:45] no
[1:03:46] jesus is not about that jesus about
[1:03:49] prepare for something
[1:03:52] lay the foundations for something
[1:03:54] and then wait until god's timing
[1:03:57] now you get that green light i'm going
[1:03:58] to build this house i'm going to marry
[1:04:00] that woman i'm going to marry that guy
[1:04:04] those
[1:04:05] good things come
[1:04:07] to those who are willing
[1:04:09] to wait a little bit
[1:04:13] and the bible teaches that as well well
[1:04:15] we'll just follow our heart this follow
[1:04:18] your heart i heard a song on the radio
[1:04:20] the other day
[1:04:21] follow your heart
[1:04:25] no no it's not true it's a lie
[1:04:30] for
[1:04:31] jeremiah 17 9 says the heart is
[1:04:34] deceitful above all things
[1:04:37] and desperately
[1:04:38] wicked who can know it
[1:04:42] i the lord searched the heart
[1:04:45] i try the reigns
[1:04:47] even to give every man according to his
[1:04:50] ways
[1:04:50] according to the fruit of his doings oh
[1:04:54] you found that one to the fruit of his
[1:04:57] doings it's so funny his doings you're
[1:05:00] going to have doings in life
[1:05:03] all your doings can be established on
[1:05:05] the word or your doings can be
[1:05:08] not established in the word and you're
[1:05:10] actually going to either the fruit of
[1:05:12] your doings
[1:05:14] how about let god lead you
[1:05:16] how about be accountable
[1:05:18] so that the fruit is a better fruit that
[1:05:20] the lord is pleased with
[1:05:22] we don't follow our heart we proverbs 4
[1:05:25] 23 says to keep our heart protect our
[1:05:28] heart
[1:05:29] follow the holy spirit but don't follow
[1:05:31] your heart
[1:05:33] make your heart accountable to the word
[1:05:35] of god because your emotions can kick in
[1:05:37] and it's your emotions going to tell you
[1:05:39] do all kinds of things your flesh can
[1:05:41] kick in your hormones can kick in
[1:05:43] everything gets in this has to be
[1:05:45] something deeper in your life besides
[1:05:47] your hormones and your flesh and your
[1:05:49] feelings
[1:05:51] don't be don't act like you don't have
[1:05:52] feelings you do
[1:05:54] don't deny who you are as a human being
[1:05:57] but there has to be a solid thing that
[1:06:00] leads feelings and emotions and thoughts
[1:06:03] and that's the word of god
[1:06:06] let it lead your life father
[1:06:09] thank you lord
[1:06:11] thank you that you've given us your word
[1:06:15] god the word is so specific now
[1:06:20] this teaching tonight lord i pray that
[1:06:22] many young people see it
[1:06:25] not just young people but maybe if
[1:06:26] someone's older and they haven't seen it
[1:06:28] yet they see it lord
[1:06:30] that even though our prophet when he was
[1:06:32] talking about micah and the prophets
[1:06:36] and i read it today and i didn't get to
[1:06:37] it tonight i'll take another service on
[1:06:39] this but
[1:06:40] i read it where brother branham says now
[1:06:43] i know the bible says in the multitude
[1:06:45] of counselors and safety he says that's
[1:06:46] not always true
[1:06:48] it depends on
[1:06:50] the counselors
[1:06:52] so it's not always in the multitude of
[1:06:55] counselors of safety if the counselors
[1:06:56] are wrong
[1:06:58] so we have to really seek god to find
[1:07:01] even the right
[1:07:03] counsel in our lives
[1:07:05] that's godly
[1:07:07] that has the character of god
[1:07:09] that's the wisdom of god and it's based
[1:07:11] upon the message and the word of god
[1:07:14] not someone's ideas
[1:07:17] help us lord to be accountable
[1:07:19] help
[1:07:20] us to be
[1:07:22] submissive
[1:07:23] help us to be open lord to the light to
[1:07:26] be shined on every area of our lives
[1:07:29] help us to confess our faults one to
[1:07:31] another
[1:07:32] help us to go and consult you in every
[1:07:34] matter of our life father what do you
[1:07:36] want me to do in this situation lord
[1:07:38] what do you want what decision do you
[1:07:40] want me to make and i've seen it over
[1:07:42] and over again when a couple or
[1:07:45] one seeking the will of god when they'll
[1:07:47] just put that prayer sincerely and
[1:07:49] they'll be neutral about it when they
[1:07:51] put that there i've seen you come and
[1:07:53] answer so crystal clear
[1:07:56] this is my answer for my son and
[1:07:59] daughter
[1:08:00] you do it lord because those that are
[1:08:02] seeking your will
[1:08:03] the sons of god really want your will
[1:08:05] and they're neutral until they find it
[1:08:08] you're more than willing
[1:08:10] to show them what your divine will is
[1:08:13] i love you tonight father thank you
[1:08:16] for my life
[1:08:19] and with my
[1:08:20] sometimes i didn't listen and i went
[1:08:22] through that too sometimes i made a
[1:08:25] decision and i wasn't accountable
[1:08:26] forgive me that lord
[1:08:29] may we all father take our mistakes and
[1:08:32] say we've learned from them
[1:08:34] we've learned there's no way that we
[1:08:36] want to live outside of the
[1:08:38] correction
[1:08:40] and the boundaries and the
[1:08:42] presence the atmosphere
[1:08:45] of being spoken to by god
[1:08:47] never would we ever want to live outside
[1:08:49] of that ever
[1:08:51] again
[1:08:53] may this
[1:08:54] seed that i've planted tonight
[1:08:56] bring forth great fruit
[1:08:59] in the congregation i pray in jesus name
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:04] amen thank you for staying alone
