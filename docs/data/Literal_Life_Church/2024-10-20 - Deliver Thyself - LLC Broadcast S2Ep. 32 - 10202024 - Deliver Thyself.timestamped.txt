[5:22] good you've
[5:25] been real good
[5:30] you've
[5:31] been so
[5:34] good to
[5:39] me Proverbs Chapter 6 my son if thou be
[5:44] shity for thy
[5:46] friend if thou Hast stricken thy hand
[5:48] with a
[5:50] stranger thou art snared with the words
[5:53] of thy mouth Thou Art taken with the
[5:55] words of thy mouth that verse 6 verse
[5:58] one chapter 6 6 vers1 says shy and it
[6:02] has the connotation of sometimes you can
[6:05] apply it to co-signing for somebody or
[6:07] become a becoming a partner with
[6:09] somebody in business this is often how
[6:12] that is taken is that you become shity
[6:14] in other words you found you form an
[6:16] agreement you form a bond or a
[6:18] partnership with somebody and so now
[6:21] when that can be taken not only for
[6:23] business the scripture kind of uh leans
[6:26] us away from forming bonds like that and
[6:28] being Partnerships
[6:30] but if you do There's real warnings that
[6:32] come with it and so he says if thou be
[6:35] shy for thy friend if thou has stricken
[6:38] thy hand with a stranger because this
[6:40] say says with a friend this is where we
[6:42] form bonds and we form tightness and uh
[6:45] you know we we hang out together and
[6:47] then we start to form bonds and
[6:49] agreements together it has to do with
[6:51] agreements and forming those type of
[6:54] friendships and then it says Thou Art
[6:56] snared with thy words of thy mouth Thou
[6:58] Art taken with the words of thy mouth do
[6:59] this now my son and deliver thyself when
[7:03] thou art come into the hand of thy
[7:04] friend go humble thyself and here's the
[7:07] theme make sure thy friend so if there's
[7:10] going to be this kind of a bond you
[7:12] better make sure of this friend you
[7:15] better check him out you better check
[7:17] her out you better make sure you may
[7:19] secure the character of this person
[7:22] because why you're going to form an
[7:24] agreement a partnership you're going to
[7:26] form a bond with him and the scripture
[7:28] is warning us is that if you form the
[7:31] wrong bond that it says to deliver
[7:33] yourself but before you even get there
[7:35] make sure thy friend give not sleep to
[7:39] thine eyes nor Slumber to thine eyelids
[7:41] in other words Keep Your Eyes Wide Open
[7:43] deliver thyself as a row from the hand
[7:47] of the Hunter and as a bird from the
[7:50] hand of the foul Fowler and both places
[7:55] in verse three and verse 5 it says to
[7:57] deliver thyself this is only mentioned
[8:00] three times in scripture to deliver
[8:02] thyself these two places here and also
[8:05] in one of the Old Testament prophets
[8:07] where it says to Israel when they were
[8:09] mingling with B Babylon he says to
[8:12] deliver thyself so I want to speak on
[8:14] that this morning deliver thyself we
[8:17] often hear a person say I need
[8:20] deliverance from God I need Deliverance
[8:23] I need God to deliver me and there's not
[8:25] a thing wrong with that but here's a
[8:27] small section where it says deliver
[8:30] thyself the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[8:32] Christ in this hour is being called
[8:36] away into the secret of his dwelling
[8:39] place we're called to a secret
[8:42] relationship in this inner room with him
[8:45] we're called to a place to be hidden in
[8:48] Christ hidden from the things of the
[8:50] world hidden from the being affected by
[8:53] the things of the world how many know
[8:56] we're called to a hidden place in Christ
[8:58] David said hide me in the Rock and so we
[9:02] are called to this place Song of Solomon
[9:04] says something he says to his love Arise
[9:07] My Love and come away and you know the
[9:10] song of the Solomon is a is a a chapter
[9:13] in the Bible a book in the Bible that is
[9:15] actually uh such an intimate close
[9:18] Oneness with the the woman that he loved
[9:21] the one woman that he found Solomon and
[9:24] so now we realize that's a type of the
[9:26] Bride In Christ at the last days and one
[9:28] of the things he says to her is Arise My
[9:31] Love and come away in other words it's
[9:33] an exclusive relationship it's calling
[9:36] the bride away to something that's
[9:39] personal and exclusive and to forsake
[9:42] any other bond that is a hindrance to
[9:45] this one relationship God is calling us
[9:48] to forsake every Bond every attachment
[9:52] everything that is more important than
[9:54] your bond with Christ God is calling us
[9:57] to a secret dwelling place with him if
[10:01] you want to know what the message has
[10:02] come to do that's what it's come to do
[10:04] it's saying Arise My Love come out of
[10:07] the world come out of all the things
[10:09] that that the pressures of this world
[10:11] and where do we come to a relationship
[10:14] with Jesus Christ personally that we
[10:16] have never known
[10:18] before and so it's arise Come Away
[10:21] forsake any other bond that is a
[10:23] hindrance and we use it in the wedding
[10:25] ceremony in the in The Vow forsaking all
[10:28] others and that's a true marriage is
[10:30] that now at that decision time there
[10:32] might be other ones that you dated or
[10:34] was with or whatever or you you know I
[10:36] don't know but at this point if it's a
[10:38] real commitment it's forsaking all
[10:41] others and cling only to him that's
[10:44] what's the wife says that's what the man
[10:45] says you forsake all others if that's
[10:48] true of a marriage a Christian marriage
[10:50] it's true of our relationship with the
[10:53] Lord you forsake all others that would
[10:56] be a hindrance to this relationship
[10:59] and we cling to him uh if if he is not
[11:03] our strongest bond in life we will be
[11:06] shaken
[11:08] up everything else in this life is being
[11:11] shaken every other thing that we had
[11:13] Security in is becoming insecure you
[11:16] will feel insecure if you put your trust
[11:19] in any other relationship because all of
[11:22] it seems to become disappointing all of
[11:24] it seems to follow that's why we have
[11:26] such a lack of trust today in
[11:28] relationships because we've been hurt
[11:30] before so we don't trust relationships
[11:32] but there is a relationship that you can
[11:35] trust there is a relationship and
[11:37] sometimes when one ends and it's a good
[11:40] thing that it ends it's the Lord driving
[11:42] you to the one relationship that will
[11:44] bring you Security in this hour and
[11:46] that's with the Lord when everything
[11:48] fails when he is all that we have left
[11:52] then he will be all that we
[11:55] need can I safely say that if we got got
[11:59] to the place in life where he was the
[12:01] only thing that we had left including
[12:05] money he was the only thing we had left
[12:09] if that happened to you he would be the
[12:11] only thing that you need we cannot form
[12:14] a bond we cannot form a strong bond with
[12:19] something that's insecure that's being
[12:21] shaken all the kingdoms of this Earth
[12:23] will be shaken including the economic
[12:27] system we do all we can we work we plan
[12:30] we invest we might what do whatever we
[12:33] do but don't you dare put your trust in
[12:36] a system that we know according to
[12:38] scripture is supposed to crash all this
[12:40] stuff is being lined up right now can
[12:42] you say Amen so we do what we do in this
[12:45] world and if God blesses it fine but
[12:47] don't ever don't ever as a minister of
[12:50] the Lord don't ever put your security in
[12:52] that because it can all change in one
[12:54] day our only security is us being driven
[12:57] in a bond with the Lord because when he
[13:00] is all we have then he's all we
[13:05] need we're being drawn into that kind of
[13:08] life and whether it's in life or death
[13:11] he will be all that we need whether it's
[13:12] in life or death the difficult part when
[13:15] we have the bride being called to a a
[13:17] close relationship with him and a
[13:21] exclusive relationship and coming into a
[13:22] secret place the difficult part with us
[13:25] sometimes is the separation part part of
[13:28] him drawing us away and freeing oursel
[13:31] from uh and fre freeing ourselves so we
[13:33] can be closer to him part of it is is
[13:36] that he draws us away from other
[13:39] unhealthy Bonds in our life he draws us
[13:42] away from that and when you're drawn
[13:44] away from those bonds and that closest
[13:46] and that friend when you're pulled away
[13:48] from that there's a pain that will go
[13:50] with it and we don't like that pain but
[13:53] we are called to cut ties with certain
[13:55] things we are called to separate from
[13:57] certain things our Father Abraham was
[14:00] called to separate from his Kindred and
[14:03] in order to move on with the promise he
[14:05] had to separate some may not understand
[14:07] that they say well come on how do you
[14:09] understand a God that would separate
[14:10] from your Kindred hey your Kindred is
[14:12] your Kindred your family is your family
[14:14] and that's probably the hardest part is
[14:15] when you have to separate sometimes from
[14:17] family not that you're not friendly with
[14:20] them not that you're not courteous but
[14:22] Abraham was called some people don't
[14:24] want to accept this but when he was
[14:26] called to more to take his PR more of
[14:28] God he had to separate yourself from
[14:31] your Kindred we don't understand that
[14:34] because hey family's family family will
[14:37] always be
[14:38] family stick with the family we stick
[14:41] together we stand for one another there
[14:43] are some incidences where God CS you to
[14:45] separate a bit from that because you
[14:48] have cannot have a stronger bond with
[14:51] your family than with the
[14:55] Lord so God calls it's painful and and
[14:59] and this is the part of we love the fact
[15:01] that I say that we're going to be called
[15:02] to a hidden place in Christ that we're
[15:04] being drawn away closer to him but it's
[15:07] painful when he begins to cut ties or we
[15:10] begin to be called to cut ties we tend
[15:13] to cling cling to our past identity
[15:15] cling to our friends and we're more used
[15:19] to that we feel safer with that these
[15:21] are the friends we've developed all
[15:23] these years we feel safer and trust me
[15:25] today I'm not speaking against true
[15:27] friends true friends true Godly friends
[15:30] that lead you closer to the Lord that's
[15:32] a wonderful thing if you have true
[15:33] friends they're a gift of God if you
[15:35] just made up a friendship sometimes it
[15:37] can be unhealthy and if it becomes more
[15:40] and more unhealthy God says deliver
[15:42] yourself from that Bond deliver yourself
[15:45] from that friendship make sure who your
[15:48] friend
[15:52] is it may become a stronghold that keeps
[15:56] us from what's better in our life being
[15:59] tied in bonds to the wrong people can
[16:01] limit you here I I in the scripture
[16:05] today is a call to deliver yourself from
[16:09] the wrong bond to deliver yourself from
[16:12] the wrong friend to make sure thy friend
[16:17] you know we Americans uh we quickly are
[16:20] emotionally attached to
[16:23] people and we are emotional God made us
[16:25] that way but we we tend to really
[16:28] emotionally ATT attach ourself to people
[16:31] and when we do that we have to take this
[16:33] lesson everyone does make sure thy
[16:36] friend because we will normally attach
[16:38] oursel more emotionally to somebody that
[16:41] will come natural and we just form a
[16:43] bond and now we're friends we're bodies
[16:46] this is it but the scripture warns us we
[16:48] must be so careful who we form a bond
[16:51] with we must be sure that this is the
[16:54] right kind of friend can you say Amen we
[16:56] must be sure if we form deals and part
[16:58] parterships and all these things are
[17:00] linked to forming an emotional bond
[17:03] sometimes a financial Bond sometimes a
[17:05] mental Bond we we are warned in the
[17:08] scripture that we we and and Americans
[17:10] take this rough sometimes because we
[17:13] quickly emotionally attach to something
[17:15] Hollywood knows this the movie industry
[17:18] knows this the music industry knows this
[17:21] that we are music itself is even used
[17:24] sometimes to emotionally attach people
[17:27] to someone or to
[17:29] something and the music affects us to do
[17:32] that and we we lean more towards
[17:35] emotional feelings and we'll choose to
[17:38] bond with something just simply on how
[17:40] it feels instead of checking it out
[17:44] music affects us emotionally it opens
[17:47] our hearts I've I've I've read you the
[17:49] lyrics of the song by Barry Manalo years
[17:52] ago I read it for the purpose of showing
[17:54] who's speaking behind the song it says I
[17:57] write the songs I've been alive forever
[17:58] ever and I wrote the very first song I
[18:01] Put the words and The Melodies together
[18:03] I am music and I write the songs I write
[18:06] the songs that make the whole world sing
[18:08] I write the songs of love and special
[18:10] things I write the songs that make the
[18:13] young girls
[18:16] cry I write the songs I write the songs
[18:21] second verse says my home lies deep
[18:23] within you and I've got my own place in
[18:25] your soul I've been alive forever I
[18:27] wrote the verse who's talking
[18:30] here not Barry
[18:33] Manalo there's another author of
[18:35] something speaking here my home lies
[18:38] deep within you I've got my own place in
[18:40] your soul now when I look out through
[18:42] your eyes I'm young again even though
[18:44] I'm very old I write the songs that make
[18:46] the whole world sing and then the course
[18:47] and then the the the bridge says and my
[18:51] music makes you dance it gives you
[18:53] Spirit to take a chance I wrote some
[18:55] rock and roll so you can move music
[18:57] fills your heart well that's a great
[18:59] Fine Place to Start it's for me it's for
[19:02] you it's from you it's from me it's a
[19:06] worldwide
[19:08] Symphony and everybody
[19:12] cries it becomes a an emotional thing
[19:16] and who's the author speaking well he's
[19:18] def definitely looking for a place in
[19:20] the
[19:20] soul and now he uses his music to do it
[19:24] movies and books make us cry and laugh
[19:26] and we form a friend without checking
[19:29] them out Bible says be careful who you
[19:32] form a partnership with friends can be
[19:35] more how many know that friends can be
[19:37] more than just human beings I find with
[19:40] the young people sometimes their phone
[19:42] has become their
[19:44] friend that's who they have there all
[19:46] the time that's their companion the
[19:48] Bible says don't be a companion of fools
[19:51] it says that to the young people don't
[19:53] have be a companion with fools well if
[19:55] it's not a person because everybody's so
[19:57] isolated then the phone becomes their
[19:59] friend or all the people that's on their
[20:01] phone how many know fear can become a
[20:04] friend you don't have any friends so
[20:07] fear the fear in your life becomes your
[20:09] friend that's what you're used to that's
[20:11] the bond that you have is fear you're
[20:13] afraid and so it becomes your friend can
[20:16] you say amen and all the the industries
[20:19] I was thinking of it this morning why
[20:21] why do they call my health insurance uh
[20:24] plan or my health insurance why do they
[20:26] call it a healthc care partner
[20:29] you know they're bleeding people of
[20:30] millions of dollars how can that be my
[20:34] partner that's called a partner and my
[20:36] insurance they want me to look at my Ins
[20:39] Insurance company as a good
[20:42] neighbor what where are all these These
[20:45] are insurance companies corporations and
[20:47] they want the corporations to be my
[20:49] neighbor they're using these terms my
[20:51] partner my health partner and and and
[20:53] there's a reason that they're using them
[20:55] is because people I guess are lonely but
[20:57] I can trust this Health Care system
[20:58] system they will be my partner they will
[21:00] make it as long as we pay the you know
[21:02] 1,500 a month to keep it going you're
[21:04] going to we're we're real friends what
[21:06] kind of friendship is
[21:08] that like a good neighbor and then they
[21:12] get in your head with a song like a good
[21:14] neighbor State Farm is
[21:17] there Nationwide is on your
[21:21] side all these guys just blatantly
[21:25] taking the place of a partner and a
[21:28] neighbor and a friendship in your life
[21:31] bleeding you for hundreds of thousands
[21:33] of dollars all the time which you won't
[21:35] ever get back and they are doing that to
[21:37] you and they want you to call them their
[21:40] friend neighbor and they're on your side
[21:42] as a buddy I wonder I wonder when I
[21:45] thought of that last night or this
[21:46] morning I thought I wonder if this is
[21:49] part of the whole breakdown of America
[21:51] that don't have any close friends and
[21:54] it's an alternative I'll be your friend
[21:57] and so we go back to Proverbs Chapter 6
[21:59] and just break it down just a little bit
[22:01] before I come back around to that
[22:03] thought of delivering thyself Proverbs 6
[22:05] if you have your Bible open it jumps to
[22:08] describing uh first of all it says be
[22:10] sure thy friend and then it jumps to the
[22:13] characteristics of the wrong kind of
[22:15] people to be around verse 12 a naughty
[22:17] person a wicked man walth with a forward
[22:20] mouth he winketh with his eyes he
[22:23] speaketh with his feet he teacheth with
[22:25] his fingers forwardness in his is in his
[22:28] heart he deceiveth he he deviseth
[22:31] Mischief continually he Seth Discord
[22:34] therefore shall his Calamity come
[22:36] suddenly suddenly shall he be broken
[22:38] without remedy so that's the first place
[22:40] he describes a forward person that's not
[22:43] the kind of friend to have well what is
[22:44] a forward person who has a forward mouth
[22:47] habit habitually disposed to being
[22:50] disobedient and being in opposition the
[22:52] synonyms are their headstrong
[22:54] self-willed willful willful Disobedience
[22:57] not obeying or complying with the
[22:59] commands of those in authority and then
[23:02] it uses the word perverse the Greek word
[23:04] used in Matthew 17 for perverse by y
[23:07] Yeshua which means to distort a turning
[23:11] so in other words a forward person has a
[23:13] perverse type of manner but it's not
[23:16] perverse in the think we think it's a
[23:18] pervert it's not that extreme perverse
[23:21] saying a person saying perverse things
[23:24] it it means to just distort a turning
[23:26] aside we see in both languages that the
[23:29] meaning of perverse is not some demented
[23:32] thing but merely a slight Distortion of
[23:35] or turning from the
[23:38] truth that's perverse so it's not this
[23:41] thing hey come on let's go party let's
[23:43] go to the world no it's what Satan was
[23:45] in the garden it's perverse it's a
[23:47] slight going off the truth it's just a
[23:49] distortion of events when you have a
[23:52] distortion of events you have a
[23:54] distortion of the truth cuz that's not
[23:56] what really happened it's a distortion
[23:58] of what happened when you have a
[24:00] distortion of the pastor or a distortion
[24:02] of the church that's not the full truth
[24:05] and so to make sure thy friend we CLE
[24:08] clear it up and make sure what truth is
[24:10] before we believe
[24:12] it moves on to uh Proverbs uh 16:28 and
[24:17] this is tied together with a forward man
[24:19] Proverbs 1628 in the King James a
[24:21] forward man Seth strife and a Whisperer
[24:25] separateth Chief friends what kind of
[24:27] spirit is that when you have Unity when
[24:29] you have closeness when you have a bond
[24:32] even in a marriage what kind of spirit
[24:34] would come along to cause a whisper of
[24:37] separating Chief friends in other words
[24:39] this isn't it's saying I want to be your
[24:41] friend but it wants to separate true
[24:44] friendships a forward man Seth strife
[24:47] and a whisper separated Chief friends
[24:49] it's in the other Lang in the other
[24:51] versions of the Bible it's mentioned a
[24:53] perverse Man soul Strife you know what
[24:55] Strife is is just tension everything
[24:57] they say is just to make tension to make
[24:59] drama there's no peace in it a perverse
[25:02] Man soul Strife a whisper separates the
[25:04] best of friends and another American
[25:07] Standard a p a perverse man scattereth a
[25:09] broad strife and a whisper scatter Chief
[25:11] friends and in the Berean Bible says a
[25:14] perverse man spreads dissension and a
[25:16] gossip divides close friends so now you
[25:21] have a relationship maybe number one
[25:22] with the Lord but you have decent
[25:25] relationships you have Unity you have
[25:27] you have close cless you have bonds you
[25:30] have the right kind of bonds this spirit
[25:32] is to divide those bonds your
[25:35] relationship with the Lord is meant to
[25:37] be divided by this motive to stop that
[25:40] and to pull you away from it so this
[25:42] statement that says deliver thyself
[25:45] three times in the scripture we always
[25:47] hear God I want him Del to deliver me I
[25:50] I need Deliverance but God can't move if
[25:54] you're not going to let go of
[25:56] things can I say it again amen God is
[25:59] the deliverer he came to deliver his
[26:02] people from all bondage he can deliver
[26:05] you but God cannot move if you're not
[26:08] willing to let
[26:10] go if you're not willing to deliver
[26:13] yourself this a pretty strong word
[26:15] deliver yourself you can deliver
[26:17] yourself he can't break a bond that you
[26:19] have so tight that you're not willing to
[26:21] break it he can't break that but you can
[26:24] deliver yourself from that Bond God I'm
[26:27] going to I'm going to break this I'm
[26:28] going to break this unhealthy thing this
[26:30] unhealthy Bond I'm going to move forward
[26:32] with this God will just jump right
[26:34] behind you and you'll feel the wind can
[26:36] you say Amen underneath your
[26:39] wings say God I'm going to break this
[26:41] relationship I'm going to cut this off
[26:42] I'm going to cut myself free of this and
[26:45] watch The Wind Beneath Your Wings just
[26:47] take you in faith further can you say
[26:49] Amen but it says to to free yourself and
[26:52] and the and the example here is to tear
[26:55] yourself away that's the other
[26:57] translations tear yourself away from the
[27:00] trap of a hunter or the hand of a Fowler
[27:03] it actually means to free yourself after
[27:05] you've been trapped I'm I'm going to
[27:07] verse um so you catch it deliver thyself
[27:11] from a as a row a deer from the hand of
[27:13] the Hunter and as a bird from the hand
[27:15] of the fer you're already in the hand
[27:17] they've caught you but it says just
[27:19] start fighting and get out of the hand
[27:21] of the fower you're already in the Trap
[27:23] but you know when you're in a trap you
[27:25] can start to wiggle around and that's
[27:27] what this is It's not not before you get
[27:28] trapped it's actually when you're
[27:31] trapped that God can come along and put
[27:34] the wind with the wings and help you but
[27:36] you got to start fighting to free
[27:38] yourself
[27:39] up God I'm trapped by this pornography
[27:42] God I'm trapped by this addiction God
[27:44] I'm trapped by this wrong relationship
[27:46] it's an unhealthy one but I'm going to
[27:48] start wiggling my way out of it and get
[27:50] out of this
[27:52] [Music]
[27:54] trap to deliver
[27:56] myself amen
[27:59] I just got to believe that when you
[28:01] wiggle yourself out there's another hand
