Luke 12. verse 32 Luke 12 32. Luke 12 32 says it says fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I want to speak on this morning about the evidence of that land the evidence of that land may we go to prayer father we love you Lord God you just so wonderful there's definitely power in your name God everything's been conquered in Your Name Lord we've been baptized in your name God we've just trust God you're you're just the all-knowing God and we love you Lord we thank you for just to be in your presence this morning made something that be said this morning to help me get out of the way Lord not to be of myself but to be of you God let us get in a channel this morning to speak to your bride your people this morning draw us closer this morning Lord father we just want to be more like you Lord we just God We Adore You Lord we just we're searching for that landlord God we're searching we're like Caleb and Joshua where we're not giving up till we see that land this morning and father I ask you just bless this church blessed brother Paul and everyone here father we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated because I was thinking on this I was reading that Luke 12 32 this morning I was thinking about that fear not little flock and it's so it's so good that he says fear not little flock and brother Bram says it was it was a little flock he all he goes on to say that it's and he says for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and aren't you glad this morning that Jesus Christ is coming for a bride without Sparta wrinkle this morning but you know what it's nothing that we've done he's already paid the price he's coming for a bride and brother Bram says in one place he says everything we have we need of is is preparing for the bride everything we need of is in the word of God he's already paid the price there's nothing we can do I could travel the roads a million miles and it's still not enough but his blood and what he's done is worth it all he's paid the price and I believe we're all searching for land this morning I believe that you're not just come here just to get in your car to hear me or hear Brother Paul but to hear from Jesus Christ and we're all going through this life and we go through the hard times that brother Bram said it's not always on the mountaintops but it's in the valleys you know and then when they had the great fights in Goliath and you think about it it always was in The Valleys they were fighting you know it's not always on the Mountaintop he says the fruit freezes in the mountaintops and I love what he says that he says the fruit freezes but in the Mountaintop in The Valleys we have to press through we have to it's a struggle it's a fight every day it's not always oh it's just wonderful song or one for this but we go through trials in life but the pressures make you better makes you a better person it cleans you out it it it the the brother Brahman says tension tension's good for you church is good for you this morning so it's hard to grasp sometimes when it's in your own front yard or you're fighting through but but we're we're looking for that land this morning and I believe that I would call you a Caleb and Joshua this morning that we're out of over 2 million people there was two that came back and saw evidence of that land and I believe we you might we might look small and vital but we are strong in the army of God you know he might he said well he camps about us that we we get in here and we start having church and we we inherited his praise you know what he don't just go to the Tabernacle of Jeffersonville but when you call on him he's encamped around these walls this morning and when you're in your car you call on him in time of need but I'm telling you we're going to a city and I want to encourage you this morning not to give up not to give up when you're in your doubts and you're in your valleys and you know why I say keep pressing on and when brother Brandon went behind the curtain of time and the message behind the curtain of time he went from his body he went over there and he said these are converts coming to him at 90 years old and he said you don't remember me and she said no I'm paraphrasing for time this morning but he says no I don't remember you and he goes over there and you know he says you don't want to miss this land you don't want to miss this for nothing and he didn't even want to go back into his body he said but the the crowd kept saying keep pressing on keep pressing through this bottle and I believe if your loved ones today that's passed on they would pull the curtain of time and tell you to keep pressing on to keep holding the torch it might seem tough and life seems tough and it throws you curved balls but I tell you that land's full of milk and honey this morning that lamb we're searching for is something to strive for with everything that's within you everything you have is is searching for that land and not to give up program says he says in this message testimony he said Jesus always said fear not fear not do not fear Reverend said Don't Fear he said don't do that he said if you do then God can't work with you he said if you do he said if you do believe then God can work with you isn't it that right he said I have that faith in God I believe that's what Jesus said have faith in God and you know the Bible says you can't even please God without faith but you know what faith is it's by coming and hearing the word of God is by listening to the prophet listening to you know what I thought about was driving over and praying and I thought about you know what the message don't need to be tested he's already proved he was medicated prophet in this day it's already been tested it's been trial it's your test now it's the bride's test to see what you believe and you Proclaim and this message that's already been tested it's already been Vindicated but it's just you getting in the Bible and saying you know what I'm gonna fight for every inch I'm gonna fight for my family members I'm going to fight for my loved ones I'm going to fight for this sickness you know what I tell my I tell sweetheart today you claim your healing this morning you get up and claim it this morning if you came with depression you know what God didn't God didn't want you to have that this morning he's already paid the price you have to accept it this morning he wants you to have this land you know what he said he died for all of us he died for us all you're just blessed to see the truth you're just blessed aren't you glad that he went through the garbage can today or to the dump yard and picked you up and set you aside and said hey you're one of them no I don't know why he passed this piece of trash but he picked this one up it set you aside for service well aren't you thankful this morning that he picked you up out of the Maori clay set your feet upon a rock and I'll tell you what we're here to stay but it's trust in Jesus Christ everything I tell my I tell my wife all the time I said we tell the boys I said boys no matter what we do we're gonna like Joshua we're going to serve the Lord in this house I said for the for the days that we live we'll serve the Lord if Daddy loses his job will still serve the Lord if I don't have enough money better to pay to us we're still going to pay our tithes because that's what the Bible says and this has to be your absolute the word of God the word of God because you know what this was brother Graham's road map right here the Bible you know we read his quotes and I'm so thankful for the prophet but you know what he pointed us to Jesus Christ he showed every one of you who Jesus was where we're going where we came from and where we're going and I'm thankful this this morning that he showed you he showed me what the grace of God we had this morning that there's evidence in that land because brother Branham went behind the curtain of time he didn't want to go back to that body they always tell him my mom's over there and I say praise God she got baptized and gave her heart to the Lord probably about four months before she fell over you know I'd love to have her back but not in a way I'm actually jealous in a way because I'm like you're in that land waiting for us to to the adoption we're all groaning the Bible says we're groaning on the inside waiting for adoption and if there's something that's not on the inside this morning that's not groaning for that for that land or for that adoption this morning it's time for a checkup it's time for a checkup this morning if we don't have something on the inside that's groaning like crying out saying father come quickly Lord come quickly I know you'll have had enough of this past house the prophet is God says he said he said so don't fear fear is of the devil he said every time everything Jesus would say fear not he said consistently fear not fear not is that right always fear not he said now God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe he says so every one of you believe with one Accord one Accord every one of you you think about that he would always say I love what the prophet said he said even cancer wouldn't have stand in the way if you could believe even cancer covet whatever they want to call it Delta American Airline virus whatever it is Delta it's always something every year it's always a new virus in the land but God has conquered every virus every sickness 2 000 years ago you have evidence this morning you just have to accept it Austin says his faith in the believer that makes them whole we can pray for you all day but you've got to let your body obey that confession and you have to claim it every day claim your job claim your inheritance God's gave it to you just claim it I love Barbara talks about the abstract deed he says hey we have the abstract deed and it goes all the way back if you pull it on the house and I've been in real estate where you pull it back you see all the owners but you know what's so great we see the king written over ours when you look back you might have all these different owners but the King was the first owner and he's conquered death held in the grave and I'll tell you he's coming for a bride this morning and we should be all looking for that land we should keep our focus on that land and that should be our shride this morning that should be our stride this morning program says when Divine love is projected in 1957. he said when those Hornets had me covered I knew I'd be stung to death in a few moments he said instead of being afraid he said there was only two elements that you can be controlled by and that's either Faith or doubt he says a fear will accompany doubt so if you he said if you're Jesus said fear not Don't Be Afraid God keeps his word no matter what condition you are tonight God keeps his word I love that God keeps this word that's who we got to trust in it's not by what I do it's all about what Jesus already said he's done he's already gave you he's already done he's paid the price we just have to accept it that's like Bobby Brown said that when that uh when the uh I'm paraphrasing the night this morning for time but he talks about the president he gave him that pardon and he brought it back to him and he didn't accept that pardon you know he had his party right in front of him but he didn't accept it you know what you just got to reach out and accept it this morning you know what if you have Assad this morning how thankful you should be how thankful you should be because I've come from a home and I would pass it up through here coming up I told the boys I think it's that little mosque up here on in Perrysburg and we were passing through I said boys I said Isaac I never thought I would drive back through here and bring back memories never thought it didn't family never saw the message none of my family saw the message and my grandmother handed me them two CDs one day when I was going to the military she said why the nomination just about religion and it changed my life that changed my life because I realized there was an Evidence there was a deep call to the Deep to respond there was a deep cloth to the deep and I was passing up this mosque and we turned off and I said boys son I used to just walk down this highway and I used to walk down this highway and I'd walk through here as a little kid trying to run away from home and I started running around that mosque and it was corn fields at the time and I said it was like a Kmart over there and we go through the wrong crowds and we would try to run away from home for weeks and come back and I said boy I look at I said and I said but God came and rich in Mercy I said God he from the foundation of the world he came down and he saved me a sign and I said he did the same thing with you son and then we might it might be cold outside but the holy spirit is warned today and I thought about that mosque and I thought about how but that's every one of our Lives we all have a testimony we've all but God has come down and gave you evidence of that land this morning and you are the fruit of it this morning I want to claim that this morning if you haven't had had the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you hadn't been baptized I provoke you now to get baptized I say I say get baptized get in the name of Jesus Christ because that's going to carry you through the prophet of God says in the seven Church ages he says in Revelation 15 3 he says it says in the in the in the seeing in the scene of the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thy king of saints he says the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement of The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty he said that is his presence present office that is what he's doing now pleading his blood for our sins he said but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah and he says he will come forth in the power and glory and take his authority to reign as king he says he is the coming king of this Earth of course he said that he said that does not say he is not a king now he said for he is our king the king of saints right now it's a spiritual Kingdom he said it is not of this world system even as the night of this world that's the reason we act different from the world but he says I love it I'm talking about evidence of the land this morning but he says our citizenship is in heaven our citizenship is in heaven this morning you know I always thought about Brother Paul's thinking you know this is the negative life right now there's always a negative and positive in this flesh we're coming in the negative but there's a positive Awakening there's that theophany awaiting that's pulling groaning to go to a perfect land with milk and honey like Caleb and Joshua and I tell you you ever thought about a battery have you ever tried to crank your car and take the negative off try it try it I wish I had a demonstration I thought about this morning I was praying this morning and I was like man I need a battery with a light but I thought about you take the negative off it doesn't crank it doesn't crank try it go go light up a light and take off the negative it doesn't light up it takes the negative to turn to the positive this morning it takes the bad trials to make you a better Christian it takes the hard trials in the valley to get to the Mountaintop this morning it takes hard trials hard situations care whatever it is this morning but I tell you he is the positive this morning and think about the cross there is a negative sign but Jesus was nailed on the cross it became positive this morning and that's what we go to the bank on this morning there might be a negative sign in it but it was all positive and he was nailed to the cross but it takes the negative to become the positive so don't get down with the devil's on your shoulder he did it with the brother Branham the devil did it the prophet today his sister his little daughter was on the bed dying think about it and hear the the devil got on his shoulder and said hey hey you've been traveling and you've been doing all this hey just give up I'm preparaphrasing this this morning just give up he does that to me he probably does it to you but you know what you keep striving on he said blessed be the Lord that giveth and taketh away in Jesus name he said the presence of the Lord came down in that room because he started calling upon his name now Sister Gabby was singing this morning that song I said praise God you can just feel the presence of the aroma falling in this place last night when they were singing God bless you Sister share I mean I was just like praise God she's just she's shining the light for Jesus Christ and you know what it might you know always people say Well they're here and they're singing here and they're doing you know what at least they're doing something for Jesus Christ at least they're shining a light for Jesus Christ I say God bless you keep holding that torch and you know what he brought back says just just put your arm out this much farther and reach and get them in just be salty this morning you know what you might you one day you might have been in this pest house there was a Chris Kathy one day that was walking in Perrysburg that was of this world wearing shorts ate up in life but one of you pulled me to the side and said give me a message let me shine a light for you and I thought about in that church last night we were sitting there and they were singing I was thinking I was here one time and just let me be a witness let me be a light maybe just watch just just just just just listen to the aroma of Jesus Christ and I was just sitting there thinking Lord I was in this chicken house one day but there might you know what there's still that one more soul and that could have been there last night and I said God bless you I said they're shining the light but you know what we want to hear Too Much complaining well they're doing this and they're over here and you they're out in the world you know no they're Shining Light what are you doing what are you doing why are you doing to Proclaim this message you got evidence of the land why don't you share it with someone else share it with a loved one share it someone of the world share it at the gas station wherever you're at share the word of God share the word of God let's turn to numbers this morning how far we'll get but let's turn the numbers this morning numbers 13. verse 17. he talks about the 12 South sent out to the land in verse 17 of numbers 13 17 it says that Moses sent them out to spout the land of Canaan and said to them he said get up this way Southward and go into this mountain and he said see the land what it is and it really hit me and struck me for what it is you know what is sickness good is sickness bad is healing good you know they had to actually question them hey go see what it is if the God says there's a great land if he says you're healing this if you're he can heal you in Jesus name whatever he says in this Bible he'll give it to you but here they go they question and see what the land see the land and what it is and the people that dwell therein whether there be strong or weak few or many and what the land is and they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities he says and they be they that dwell in whether the tents or strongholds it says in what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and it says and be of good courage and bring forth fruit of the land bring up the fruit of the land now the time was the he says that was the time was the time of the first great first great right grapes and verse 25 for time it says in the return for they to return from searching for the land after 40 days and they went out and came to Moses in there and think about he's sitting all these tribes out there and they the the congregation the children of Israel and to the Wilderness of Pera and the kadish and brought back word unto them and then to the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land verse 27 and they told that they told him and said and said we come into the land whether they're sentenced us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it he goes to verse 28 28 I'm building on this it says nevertheless the people be strong in that dwell in that land and the cities are walled and very great they started coming back with the evil report think about it they started to go they send them over there and they'd come back and they come back hey well there's they're strong we look like grasshoppers in the side of them we look we're we can't fight this battle but you know what this battle is not yours think about it in second Corinthians second chronicles it talks about King Jehoshaphat and he says hey this battle is not yours it's mine he's already paid the price you might be in battle brothers says you have to fight for every inch of ground and it's it truly is a fight and he says when you become a Christian he says he basically says when you become a Christian you gotta fight and that's when the battles start that's when the trials start that's when the trials of this life but it's come to test you it's come to see who you are in Christ not just to carry around a book and say I believe a message not just to know all the Cults the devil knows the quotes he knows who the prophet is he knows every scripture but I tell you he just looks at the life behind the name he says when a weak Christian gets on their knees he said the devil the devil trembles imagine a pretty dope man of God imagine a man that's that surrendered his life to the calling or whoever it is that's one of us just shrilly saying Lord I will shred everything off me of this world imagine someone prayed up imagine what they do when they get their get on their knees oh praise the Lord it says nevertheless these people be strong and dwell in the land verse verse 30 skip down it says and Caleb's still the people before Moses and said let us go up once and possess it for we are able to overcome it I love that you know what because they knew that if God gave them the land if God said go get the land and he says hey I'm going to prepare a place this morning he's prepared the place this morning for us for me and you this morning it's the grace of God but he said is he going to do it he's going to prepare a place and it says but when the man went up verse 31 with him it said we are not able to go against see listen I think that's how people act today well hey brother well you know I'm going through this trial I don't think I'm going to make it yes you're going to make it the Bible says we are Overcomers we're conquerors we're more than conquerors and it says we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report and I believe we live in a day that's just nothing but evil violence it's perfect every every sickness you could think of or immorality everything you could see is the past tense out there they want to tell you evil reports you can't have this you can have everything in Jesus Christ if you took on his name you're the Bride of Jesus Christ and you are missed Jesus Christ this morning but he goes he says evil reported in the land verse 32 which they have searched into the children of Israel saying the land thou which we we have gone to search he said is a lamb that's eaten up with inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there was they saw a giant they saw the Giants and the sons in it hey which have come it says Giants and when we were in our own sights as Grasshoppers and so we are in this in their sight and I believe that's how we get sometimes we get before the devil the devil wants to lie to you and tell you something or tell you you don't have that land or these young people I'll see them come through prayer lines and say they're fighting this or fighting this Spirit or fighting this and you know what that's Justin but the LIE of the devil it's just the buff of the devil it's just the bluff because he knows where you're going he's not after some people passing you see all these churches we come through here passing downtown we are blessed and you see all these churches passing and we have what we have in this day and what the evidence we have and you are the evidence this morning you are the fruit as they went back and they brought back the fruit Blood Brothers said they were so big a grapefruits of two men more than two men could take two men to pack it out over two million people they sent out spies but only two of them came went over the land and possessed it oh it's it's few in number this morning it's few but you know what Mighty is he that's in it that we're in Jesus Christ if you think about Noah there was eight in his day you think about he was just him and his family I'll tell you just claim your family brother say to be one in Jeffersonville one here one here you claim your family this month you put your family there hey I'm gonna make it my family is going to make it my sons are going to make it and by the way hey you can have your inheritance this morning if your kids Wayward you keep pressing on you keep praying for them you keep claiming them this morning you keep claiming them the prophet said and proving his word 1964. he said it came to pass they did this believe the prophet he said after seeing the word being so confirmed the bride got out of Step he said there was one stayed up by the name of Joshua and Caleb he said he believed the word of promised true regardless of what the circumstances was he says watch he said when they got to canis barnetta brem says that's the Judgment seat of the world he calls it that he says in case barnita Moses sent out one of each tribe to go spout the land he said to which he goes brother I said to which way they was to enter he says and he sent his General Joshua I love what he says here he sent his General Joshua was his Prophet was it Prophet so he sent a mind their Prophet under Moses and Joshua listened to Moses and it says they send them out so he he said so he said go and spout the land brother Bram says and this is a little bit longer quote I'm sorry but he says and the general went out and picked him out of a man he said pick the man out of each tribe and they took took took off and he took Caleb and I love what he called Caleb he called Caleb his side buddy the prophet of God called Caleb his side buddy and I love what he says here I got to underline he says he took his Caleb his side buddy because he known Caleb believed I'll call you my side buddy today brother Paul oh you gotta have a side buddy that believes the word of God that believes the message of the hour that no matter what devil in the hell can bring upon you you need a side buddy this morning to pull beside you this morning and say Hey Brother Paul I'm going through this and then he encourages me I encourage him we all need a side buddy this morning somebody that believes this word somebody no matter what if you're the only two standing you were still standing brother we're still standing sister we got to have a side buddy this morning I love how he called it his side buddy because he believed the words he said they went over into the Promised Land and he said I love what he says he says and they came back with a bunch of grapes he said that taking two men to pack see the prophet said he said now see that Israel will have the evidence before they even get into the promise see they'll have the evidence he says see they'll have the evidence that God said it's a good land it's filled with milk and honey it's the grand land the prophet said it's a good land he said now you're old he said all this old garlic leak and whatever you got here in Egypt he said now we're talk we're taking we're talking you taking you to a land with milk and honey you probably never tasted either one milk or honey down there in Egypt or all these years he said they just give you some slaves rationings he said but now you're going to this land he says so just at the moment moment time he said they got in about one Day's Journey where King is Born either the great judgment seat of the world was he said they stopped under this great poems out there that Springs and Camp he said now he said to let the people know brother Graham says watch what a perfect what a real perfect evidence it is how God does that he said just as he does today he said now God said the land is great he said now before you could go over I want you to see the land is great he said go bring me back some evidence of that land and show it to the people and I'm so thankful that we had a prophet go before our day and tell you how hell was going to be how he saw the pain the painted eyes and then he went over and saw the evidence of no he ain't seen Jesus Christ yet because he said he's just a little bit higher but he says he was still in that just imagine he didn't even got to see Jesus how much how how we need to strive to get to see Jesus Christ oh he just got to see even a glimpse and he still didn't want to go back in that body he still didn't want to go back so if your mother or father has passed away in Jesus Christ oh they're praising God right now I told my wife the other day we did Brother Paul we did a we had to do a will the other day because this and this and this business and we're doing this and we got down to the funeral part and I kind of chuckled we got down to it and the attorney says how you want to fill this out I said I don't care about the Future Part I said honey when I die I want y'all call Brother Paul call whoever I want y'all to have a Revival service I want y'all you take the money and I said don't be spending no money big old money on no box I'm being serious honey if you're listening I know she is hey I'm being serious I said honey you saved the money you put in your pocket I don't care I said pay for the kids college whatever it takes I said but most of all you pay for a four day Revival let's have brother Paul let's have everybody and let's have a rejoicing time because when I get to that land I'm going to be dancing in Jesus name I'm going to be praising God in there Jesus name I didn't want no sorrowful the funeral I'm talking about a land that's for milk and honey that the prophet went and saw this morning and I'm here to tell you I said just order a box like Billy Graham did I said you know he had the prisoners build it just just whatever just hey had their brothers put a pie wallet box together I said they're gonna put the ball on it anyway I said just throw it in there and just hey it'd be fine but first we'll have Revival service I said pay for a week of Revival because one soul is worth 10 million worlds and I said I'm personally could get in those and I said by one life one live life one live life and I said just have Revival service says your Sherry will pay you to come sing we'll pay everybody we'll have a quick a blasted Revival I said use the money for the good because you know what many people you know everybody wants to show up to the funeral you'll see parents you'll see your parents you'll see people you've never saw before hey Johnny how are you doing I haven't seen him in 10 years but you know what's so sad they can't show up to church I don't know where I'm going but they can't come to church they they what Jesus Christ's done for us he's gave us evidence of the land this morning brother Brown's brawl back went back in the body and told us evidence of that land like Caleb and Joshua and he even got to the Final Destination yet because he said he's just a little bit higher he said one day he'll be the he'll be the Lamb of the light he'll be the light of the city think about it one day that's what you're striving for this morning that's what you keep pressing through battles that's why you're going through heartaches that's why you're going through trials that's why if Monday comes is another trial there's a you lose a job or whatever it is or you keep pressing if someone tells you to quit singing or or do this I tell you to keep singing for Jesus Christ I tell you to keep pressing on for Jesus Christ if it's in Jesus name you keep doing it but I thought about everybody just show up for a funeral show up for this but I tell you what I'll tell you it's good to be in the house of God it's the Judgment seat for us it's a time to cleanse off and get things all out of the world or things out of us it's it's like going not going to the gas station imagine you're riding around in this snow today and just not never going to the gas station and filling up you're going to run out of gas my wife tells me all the time honey the Lights On The Lights On The Lights On she does the lights on uh you know finally I'm like okay I gotta go it's down to zero I have to go I have to be some guy but you know what as you come into church you need your tanks filled up we need your tanks filled up and that's not just by sitting you know what thank God bless you for the the the the sound system and the and the the visual audio but I tell you what the devil with this covert has put us in a different mindset where we can watch church or anywhere we can just watch it in our I'm just going here I don't know why but you know we just we just want to sit in the comfort of our home drink some coffee want to drink some coffee and just kind of sip on some coffee in our pajamas I'm not saying if you're sick my wife is today but I'm saying if you're sick praise God God bless you it's wonderful to have I said but there's nothing like being in The Presence of Jehovah because spirit said in five minutes of time with Moses five minutes time changed his life took away his teachings took away everything that he learned five minutes at the burning bush sometimes we just need a burning bush experience we need the presence of God we need to take all the formality off of us and just lay our hair down forsake and say God I'm going to serve you whatever happens today I'm going to praise you oh we can go to a ball game and get excited we could go here and get excited we should be some excited people in this place today that we have evidence of that land oh the police will tell me say Daddy I got excited a little ball game one time they told me I got excited one day at the ball game and my boy said hey I just wanna hi bro Daddy I hope you do that in church on Sunday I said you just better watch out cause here I come I said because I love Jesus more than that bag of there I said what he's done for me what he's brought me from what he's brought you from diabetes cancer whatever it is he's going to heal you if you don't get your healing here you'll get it over there [Applause] oh praise God oh he's worthy of our Praises he's worthy of our praises oh you know what they say Chris you're just crazy I said I'd be like brother Brown just leave me away leave me that way just leave me that way leave me that way I'm happier this way than I was the other way I love what he says the prophet says he said now always he said when you come to bring back the in evidence there the enemy lays in the road he lays in the road I'm looking what he says he says when some of them follow fellows looked over and seen those great Giants of Canaan oh my Prophet said we can't do it he said he said they said we can't do it he said but they brought back the evidence that the lamb was there he said they had been been falsely LED aren't you thankful that you're not being falsely LED but you got a pastor today that stands up it stands for this message of the hour stands for this truth no matter you know they got this nonsense there's not a cloud there's not a bridge they didn't fall you know what that's nonsense to me you either believe it 100 or get out brother I said 99 is still alive but I'm here to tell you I'm like sister how do you write brother Brown that ain't nothing but the truth everything you said everything you pointed is to is nothing but the truth you show me somebody that went God saw the evidence of that other land show me that someone when he brought back Millions hundreds of thousands of people with stretchers pulled off and he would bring them up for him and tell him and then he would change the address and say your address changed your address changed but then to be so humble where the prophets so humble that he would iron his suit in his car to get out this message he went right through brother Billy upon them would say they would take his suit and we would run it through the side of the seat to even get the wrinkles out just for me and you to hear a message to point us back to Jesus Christ this point is back not the brother Branham not to the man but to the god in the man the god in the man he said can't you see today he said that you're all drive a thousand miles to hear the word and watch it being proved and confirmed it's the evidence of a great land he said you could see a shadow of a man laying dying with cancer be made whole he said and we see the words of God he said that he spoke happening today but being confirmed it's evidence that keeps his word evidence that keeps his word aren't you thankful God commissioning Moses 1953. he says Joshua and Caleb he said they went over he said I like that I like that thought were there he said when they came over they 10 came but come back and said oh we look like grasshoppers on the side of them Joshua and Caleb said we can do it we can do it that's right he said God promised we could do it God said we could do it God promised our fathers that we was going that was our land and that belongs to us he said no matter if you got walled cities and they look like Giants and everything else so no matter what you're going through no matter what world city you got today in your mind or in your whatever you're going through you know what it's nothing but the bluff of devil it's nothing but because the devil's just a bluff he's just broke him up and said he's just a perverter he just perverts the word he's got no power but you know what my sister Gabby was singing there's probably when they were singing power in the name of Jesus to break every chain to break every sickness he's already broke every sickness he's broke Every Chain he's been raised he's done he's sitting in Heavenly places and he controls everything aren't you thankful that our control teller today is Jesus Christ and he's in evidence in their land he's in that city building a place he said I went away to prepare a place aren't you thankful that's where we're going and if you're not ready and you haven't received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I provoke you to get into Jesus Christ I said get in Jesus Christ I say give your heart to Jesus Christ because this world will sell you the devil will put you on the side of this road and run over you and laugh at you he's done it to me he'll run over laugh at you and keep on going but Jesus Christ will come by and pick you up and say there's one of my sir there's one of my Lambs I'll leave the 99 for one oh but there's that one still we're looking for that's that one that we just got to bring in one day it's coming soon church I believe it I believe we're right here at the finish line and I believe if your loved ones could tell you that today of the day and they were over in that land they could say hey keep pressing on I keep pressing on if they just look through the curtain of time right now and just pull the curtain back they would tell you to keep pressing on like they did Brother Brian they'd say sister Sherry keep pressing on brother Paul keep pressing on oh you don't want to miss this for the world you don't want to miss this place for the world you keep pressing on no matter what the trials of the devil brings you no matter what sickness the land brings you you know what one day we're gonna come to the river brother said when you get down to the river that's where the devil stops and then he carries this over to a Promised Land that's flowing with milk and honey and I'm telling you keep pressing on today pre-pressing on keep giving all you got and you serve god with everything that's in you he said he quit looking at the Giants and started looking at God's word and when men and women quit looking at their sickness and diseases and start looking at what God said about it you'll take you'll you'll you'll it'll take over he said amen and things are subject to Jesus Christ he said in all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in his name and believe amen he said ask what you will in his name in my name and it'll be done that's right brother said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive him and you shall have it but just because you pray that Jesus Christ and just like I said you got any good father if Isaac asked for something I know it's going to take him to the world any good father is going to pray about it before they just give it to him just like any father you know we think hey our God we need this today maybe you don't need it maybe it'll take you farther away from the world maybe if you gave you a big old job with a bunch of money he'd take you farther away from the world think about it but then you see all these people that move away and there's not even a they're not even a church nearby they'll take a job I don't understand this they'll take a job Millions miles away make more money and there's not even they just go spiritually dead I'd Rather Have Nothing I'd rather live in a soap box just to come in the presence of God every Sunday every Wednesday to support the church the support of ministry to support this message of the hour I'd rather have nothing to live inside my car than be somewhere that doesn't have a church or because you have evidence this morning you should something on the inside saying Lord tell whatever it is take it from me Lord make me more like you strive for that purpose strive for that purpose he says God says so he said let nothing stand in your way program said stop looking at things where you're looking at here look at the Unseen look at the Unseen but you know what it takes something on the inside to look at the Unseen people look at you when you're out and about they'll say Chris what are you looking at you're singing songs we're going through hard times you're full of joy I said because it's on the inside are seriously groaning on the inside it's their soul crying out for adoption today it's like you know what the devil can't do nothing to me that he that he doesn't allow think about it program talks about how job you think about it he had job his wife cursed him said curse God he was there with Bulls all over him scraping balls off of them lost everything you think about we go through trials sometimes scraping balls off of them oh all in a bad place and he still got down and said I serve you Lord think about it because there was something on the inside that knew there was evidence of that land there was something I'm here to tell you this morning if you don't get anything else you keep pressing on you keep starving no matter what they say no matter what their critics say and you know what's so funny they create this websites and this this junk that I don't even look at I don't even give it one that one iota show me one place they were Vindicated show me one place they're medicated then I look at it but then their life's right up they're out in the world they pull someone out of these you hear this and that and they get out of this I'm talking about the land they get away from church they get on the one going here but they get away I'm telling you young people do not keep your eyes on the word of God and you believe every scripture you go from Jesus to Revelation you get a Bible foundation and then you will you see why the message where the Prophet comes out of the Bible don't do it the other way don't learn just a bunch of quotes and don't learn this Bible you get your priorities in line and you trust every word I tell my boys I said we're going to learn Genesis the Revelation and why we believe what we believe because they're going to pull you out the devils in hell are going to say this and say that but you can say the Bible says the Bible says he's going to send your prophet in our day and that's what he sent you but when you get a Bible base and when you get a Bible Foundation ain't nothing going to stand in their way ain't never there when that Foundation is done and we're building houses I build houses sometimes and we have to dig so deep to get Divergent soil to pour the Footers you need a strong footer today you need a strong footer and the only footer that you need is this Bible and it needs to be your foundation in your home it needs to be everything that you got and your foundation needs to be in Jesus Christ it's got to be your father today and it can't be the other way around I'm not hating on the message in any way God bless it I'm thankful for it we wouldn't have the eyes to see this if we didn't I'm just telling you we got to get our priorities straight he pointed us to the Bible and you've got to learn the front and the back of this cover this is your instruction manual but a lot of times we don't get it enough we don't read it enough we're on Facebook too much we're on Instagram you know what I say get your face in this book and don't play Facebook Facebook this make this your Facebook get your face in this book because it's filled with milk and honey everything you had need of is in the word of God he's already paid for it he's gave us the evidence of that land you just have to accept it this morning you have to claim every healing that you need it's already paid on Calvary it's already paid Romans 8 you want to turn there for time 8 or 8 37 39 they said nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life this is me right here I just want to I told her I want to put this poet just right up on my by my office before I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities no powers nor things presence nor things to come nor Heights nor death nor website I just say website whatever it is so whatever it is nor death nor any other creatures shall be able to separate us from the love of God from the love if you're truly a bride of Christ this morning I'm not trying to add to it but I'm here I'm just paraphrasing but nothing should separate you from the love of this truth and the love of this message and you know what you need to line it up if they tell you to go check this check this check their life see if they're serving God these people put this stuff in this website that makes my soul just it just it makes me want to throw up they want to say this and say that I want to say where were they were and when brother Brandon was here the same people fell over his feet and had to ask them to get hey you come escort this man off my feet because they challenged the Holy Spirit they challenged and you know what they're still healing on the tapes we're listening to a tape the other day or we were reading a a thing the other day and the boys were sick for two weeks and I opened the opened the Bible we started reading and we turned right to a message and they probably called out their sickness the Holy Spirit fell in that house and completely healed my boys there's healing in this message they're healing in this Bible and I'll tell you what the boys completely got healed in the mighty conqueror 1958 he said he pulled back the curtains so that we could look past the curtain of time he pulled back every Bluff of the devil he said he fully paid the price he said and tonight he's the Conqueror and the Bible said that we are more than conquerors through him who loved us Who Loved Us think about it went through Iowa we're coming to Christmas now think about it they think about where he went they didn't go where he thought he would go think about he born in a manger think about it they thought he was going to come a certain way well Jesus Christ don't come as what they think the world thinks is going to come hey we already had a prophet in our land come and these people are looking for this or looking for that Prophet they're looking but you're blessed to see it today you are blessed to have the evidence of that land he said fully paid the price and tonight he's the Conqueror and the Bible said that we are more than conquerors through him it says so every Christian in here tonight he has the thing under he said tonight has the thing under control we've conquered sin we've conquered death we've conquered hell he said we've conquered the grave we conquered sickness because of Jesus is our Mighty conqueror Jesus is our Mighty conqueror he says the this word is the pardon this word was written for a parting to know that he is a mighty conqueror he said is a pardon to each of you if you receive it as a pardon you got to receive it as your pardon you got to accept it no matter what the devil tells you no matter what he says hey you can't have it you know what you've already got it if you're in Jesus Christ you see what you see I tell you why I was telling my dad the other day and I'll call him I'll say Dad how you doing or this and that he'll say son you still believe in it still believe what you believe I said Dad I said I'll die I believe in this truth I said Dad I'll go to my dying grave believe in just like sister had he writes I said because there was a seed to be watered one day there was a seed to be watered one day and then I finally got to see and what brother Brown went over the evidence of that land and now we got we're partakers of that land every one of you are partakers of that land you're going to be partakers of a land that's flowing with milk and honey whole word with a lamb is the light oh so I tell you not to give up I'll tell you not to give up and keep striving but there's going to be trials and we'll read this as the musicians come today I love what Psalms 121 says one through eight says well I lift up my eyes into the Hills from rent's cometh my help my health Cometh From The Lord it says which made in heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth he said thy will not slumber love it behold he that keepeth Israel shall never slumber nor sleep it said the Lord is thy keeper I just said Lord that is the truth The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand thy son shall not Spike thy there by day nor by Moon by night the Lord shall preserve thy from from all from all evil aren't you thankful he shall preserve thy soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and ever Evermore so he's an all-knowing God he knows who he's coming for this morning he's coming for a bride and he's going away he said he went away to prepare a place that we're not worthy of even the prophet said if he set my soul the hell I'd still serve my Lord I said I never understood that statement I told my wife that I never understood the statement my brother Graham says I'd still serve my God but you know what it took many years to get in this word of God and to become it become a love language and start to fall in love with the author you know and I could actually say today if you set my soul hell I'd still serve my God for all he's done for me he's done nothing but good brother Paul his benefits weigh out your 401K it pays out anything you could ever accomplish in this world whatever he's whatever you think you guys it's going to burn up one day but you know what one day it's gonna be like the three Hebrew children they walked in that fiery fungus brother Brown said they couldn't burn the Holy Spirit out of him didn't matter how much how hot they got it seven times harder it was killing the guards they were throwing them in there but it didn't matter because the fourth man had to show up and he if he hadn't showed up in your life and he ain't in your life I encourage you today to get them in your life to get them in your life let him reign in every aspect of your life your job everything let him be it all in all first let him be first place not your wife not your husband not your kids but Jesus Christ first and everything else will be added everything else will be added I'll tell you why my wife left her job many years ago she was a pharmacist oh I'm sharing this I could play something soft and I just want to share this real quick and we we're doing really well wife was pharmacist and I said honey I'll come home one day and I'm not telling you to do this I'm just filled to share it and I come home one day and I said honey I said we're doing this wrong I said honey why don't you just put in your notice they said we want you to be the chief of the hospital the chief stepping down they said I want you to be the chief of the hospital and I said honey why don't you put it in I said I said why don't you put your another sin I said forget the money I said I want you to raise our boys they were Isaac was like one or two years old I said you know honey we're doing it wrong and I'm not telling you you do however you feel that I said but sweetheart I said for this for me and our house this is where when they were young about two years old I said honey put it in she come home Faithfully she was shaking that she was putting in because we didn't know how we were going to pay the bills we know how we're going to pay the house payment we didn't know how we're gonna pay the car payment I actually had one eye open at 11 o'clock at night she walked in from second shift she put she'll tell you she's putting her notice in and I said Lord I was in my prayer closet and I said Lord I'm sorry Lord I said I need a mom to raise these kids in the abernation of Jesus Christ everything you got Rachel I want you to raise these kids in a Godly home I don't want these other I don't want anybody in this world raising our kids and I'm just speaking for my family some people sometimes you got to go to work and you have to it is what it is but I'm just talking about real personal relationship with Jesus and he said you know what don't matter if you lose it all it's worth it all and you know what we did that about it's probably been 10 years 12 13 years ago and we've God has blessed us more than we could abundantly that we could ever ask he's gave it back million times fault but you know what it is it's not just that situation it's a surrendered life in every situation he knows your mother brother Brown said this all about your mode have been objective and it's a surrender life this is Lord no matter what it takes in this situation I'm going to serve you I'm going to love you if I got a come into church sick you know what I'm going to leave well I'm going to claim my healing I don't know how I'm going to pay the next power bill but you know what God does Jesus Christ does he's paid for it all that's the God we serve that's the God we serve today so we're blessed people we're blessed people there's a quote I wanted to read if I can get to it and I'll be done bear with me sorry he says he talks about storms of life and I'm not telling just because you go through this and there's evidence of land you're going to have storms and trials he says in a greater than Solomon is here he's the first thing you know there come a little storm across the mountains he said I'd go back behind the tree he said there was a blow down there it was almost a Timberline he said you've got he said I got down below and I got down behind this tree and sat down there a little bit and the storms blowed real hard he said I had my head down like this saying God you are wonderful he said you're the gods of the mountain you're the god of the valley he said you're the guy when we're poor he said you're you're God when we're rich he said your God when we're sick he said you're God when we're happy he said you're god with them honey you're God when I'm crying you're God and God Paul no matter what you're going through today he's still God of your Valley still God of your Mountain he's got your sickness he said we just got to reach out and say Lord I claim it this morning Lord I worship you Lord not me but him the one
