[0:00] let's go to Romans chapter 10 very
[0:03] familiar scripture to us
[0:06] Romans chapter 10 thank you musician
[0:08] musicians
[0:10] just just feel like I just walked into a
[0:13] real welcome Spirit here
[0:15] Romans chapter 10.
[0:18] and we want to start with verse 8.
[0:23] everybody find your places
[0:27] but what saith it
[0:30] the word is neither
[0:33] even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[0:37] that is the word of faith which we
[0:40] preach
[0:42] that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[0:45] mouth the Lord Jesus and Shout believe
[0:48] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[0:51] from the dead thou shall be saved
[0:56] for with the heart man believeth unto
[0:59] righteousness
[1:00] and with the mouth confession is made
[1:03] unto salvation
[1:05] for the scripture saith whosoever
[1:07] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:11] for there is no difference between the
[1:14] Jew and the Greek
[1:15] and for the same Lord over all is Rich
[1:19] until all that call upon him
[1:22] for whosoever shall call
[1:24] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:28] and how then shall they call on him in
[1:32] whom they have not believed
[1:34] and how shall they believe in him whom
[1:37] they have not hurt
[1:39] and how shall they hear without a
[1:41] preacher
[1:42] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:45] sent
[1:46] as it is written how beautiful are the
[1:49] feet of them
[1:50] that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:52] bring Glad Tidings of good things
[1:56] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[2:00] for Isaiah says the Lord who hath
[2:04] believed Lord who hath believed our
[2:06] report here it is
[2:09] so then Faith cometh by hearing
[2:12] and hearing by
[2:14] the word of God
[2:17] but I say have they have they not heard
[2:20] yes verily their sound went into all the
[2:24] Earth
[2:25] and the words unto the ends of the world
[2:29] I want to preach tonight a message on
[2:32] faith cometh by hearing the word of God
[2:38] may God bless us the reading of his word
[2:40] you all can have your seats this evening
[2:41] thank you
[2:45] brother Branham
[2:47] he preaches
[2:49] a principle that I think is
[2:51] incredible I just don't see anyone in
[2:55] the world
[2:56] that that preaches on it he in the way
[2:58] that he preached on it
[3:00] he said that God Lots
[3:03] his word a portion of that word to every
[3:08] age
[3:09] that in God's Great economy and God's
[3:11] Great mind that he brings his word to
[3:15] the Earth but
[3:16] brother random said only so much of that
[3:19] word is fulfilled in a generation in
[3:22] every generation
[3:24] so God Lots his word I think that's an
[3:27] incredible thought he Lots his word and
[3:31] he he in other words he takes a portion
[3:34] of that word and he manifests it in
[3:37] every age and so he sometimes will come
[3:41] through a prophet and he'll send it down
[3:43] through a prophet and the prophet will
[3:45] catch thus saith the Lord and he'll
[3:46] manifest that word to that age and then
[3:50] we've seen that God manifesting himself
[3:53] in in Noah or God manifested in Elijah
[3:58] God manifested in Moses or Jeremiah and
[4:03] then when the word comes to that age and
[4:05] it's interpreted it's manifested he
[4:09] makes that word live for that age
[4:13] he takes the words off the pages and he
[4:17] makes it material he makes it manifest
[4:21] so it was God in Noah God in Moses god
[4:25] in Abraham God in Joshua God and David
[4:29] God all the way and it is the
[4:31] predestinated that catch it
[4:36] when God reveals a portion of his word
[4:39] to that age the predestinated catch it
[4:43] Hallelujah do you love the Lord
[4:46] he said the spirit the spirit filled of
[4:49] that age he said catch the Revelation
[4:52] for that age
[4:54] and so but now faith comes by hearing
[4:58] the word of the Lord
[5:02] and brother Branham said now Faith is
[5:04] not a loose thing
[5:06] he said it's based on something he said
[5:09] you've got to know something about what
[5:13] you are having faith in
[5:15] before you can have faith in it he said
[5:18] so we we first must know what is God's
[5:23] desire
[5:24] what is God's plan
[5:27] and his approach to that plan
[5:30] then we can walk boldly to the throne of
[5:33] grace and we can plead what God has
[5:37] promised
[5:39] hey that's solid that is that's the way
[5:42] we can get something from the Lord that
[5:44] we must know what God's desire is what
[5:49] his plan is and how we are to approach
[5:52] that plan faith comes by hearing the
[5:57] word of almighty God now that word
[6:00] hearing means to understand
[6:04] a carnal man can't understand the things
[6:07] of God neither a man that is not born by
[6:10] the spirit but here means he that he
[6:14] said that Faith cometh by understanding
[6:18] faith comes by spiritual revelation
[6:23] understand means to apprehend the
[6:27] meaning or the intention of
[6:31] it means to comprehend
[6:34] to get a comprehension so if we need in
[6:37] order to have faith
[6:39] and to see God move upon the different
[6:42] needs that we have then we must be able
[6:45] to hear with us spiritual ear
[6:48] which means to understand what we're
[6:51] hearing
[6:53] so it's not just a casual observation
[6:55] but it is a spiritual grasp and a and a
[7:00] taking a hold of
[7:01] Hallelujah praise the Lord
[7:04] and an apprehending of what we are
[7:07] trying to get
[7:09] so it's just like brother Brennan had
[7:11] said that Paul Paul was not in the upper
[7:14] room Paul was an enemy to the church and
[7:17] then God met him on the road to Damascus
[7:20] and God did not send Paul to the bishop
[7:24] Peter to get taught in Apostolic
[7:27] Doctrine but God moved him to Arabia and
[7:31] by divine revelation revealed the gospel
[7:35] that he revealed to Peter to Paul
[7:39] so when Paul met Peter brethrenham said
[7:42] they saw I too I in Doctrine
[7:46] it was not the teaching of manner
[7:48] indoctrination of man it was the
[7:51] revelation of Jesus Christ
[7:53] that's why Paul said I did not receive
[7:56] this of man neither was I taught it but
[8:00] by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[8:03] so when we hear the word of God we need
[8:06] it to be revealed by the author the
[8:10] author that wrote the word must reveal
[8:13] the word to every individual to our
[8:16] young people to our old people to our
[8:19] needy people the spirit wants to reveal
[8:23] himself
[8:24] and he that has an ear
[8:27] let him hear
[8:29] what the spirit is speaking
[8:33] to the churches
[8:37] it was Paul that said I pray for you
[8:40] and desire that you might be filled with
[8:42] all knowledge of his will
[8:44] in all wisdom and spiritual
[8:47] understanding
[8:49] how many could use that tonight
[8:51] another place Paul said I cease not to
[8:54] give thanks for you making mention of
[8:55] you in my prayers that the god of our
[8:58] Lord Jesus Christ and the father of
[9:00] Glory may give you the spirit of wisdom
[9:03] and Revelation in the knowledge of him
[9:06] that the eyes of your understanding
[9:09] would be enlightened that you may know
[9:11] what is the hope of his calling what is
[9:14] the riches of his glory and The
[9:16] Inheritance in the Saints and what is
[9:19] the exceeding greatness of his power
[9:22] towards us word who believe
[9:25] do we believe tonight
[9:28] Hallelujah so before we can ever receive
[9:31] from God we have to get into the spirit
[9:34] of God
[9:35] and then the spirit begins to show us
[9:38] things it is a work of the Holy Spirit
[9:41] he that has an ear to hear Let Him hear
[9:44] what the spirit is saying we need to be
[9:47] in the spirit to understand what he he
[9:50] wants to break it to us
[9:52] he wants to reveal himself to us he
[9:55] wants to take us up higher
[9:58] how many can say Amen
[10:00] and you say well you know look at John
[10:03] you know John is is walking around with
[10:06] the Lord he lived with him he knew his
[10:08] mannerisms he knew his ways he he was in
[10:11] his bosom he was in the Inner Circle
[10:13] what a relationship John had but in the
[10:17] Book of Revelation John did not
[10:20] understand that the lamb had to take the
[10:22] book he saw the book and and he wept
[10:25] because there was no man and he saw the
[10:28] lamb coming and he told him don't weep
[10:30] John for the lion has prevailed to open
[10:34] the book and when he opened it he
[10:36] shouted and he he came to an
[10:39] understanding
[10:40] that he did not know in the flesh
[10:45] he came to a deeper understanding
[10:49] sometimes we say I cut my teeth on a
[10:51] message pure I know all the quotes but
[10:54] the Lord wants to pull back his word and
[10:57] reveal it to us
[11:00] there are deeper places in God
[11:03] we've got to break out of a know-it-all
[11:06] mentality and we've got to say Lord my
[11:08] heart is hungry
[11:10] for you to manifest yourself in me
[11:15] surely there's more
[11:17] surely show me things I've never seen
[11:20] before
[11:21] it's our mindset limit us
[11:24] amen when you get down to the bottom
[11:26] you'll find unbelief limits us
[11:28] Beyond ahead knowledge it's a heart
[11:31] knowledge
[11:35] Hallelujah
[11:37] it is a work of the Holy Spirit
[11:40] brother said millions hear the words
[11:45] but do they pay heed to them
[11:48] he said but who will lend in here
[11:51] and and want to know the words of truth
[11:55] he said and we'll find the spirit of God
[11:58] will Enlighten him
[12:00] if your ear is open to the word the
[12:03] spirit of God will make that word real
[12:06] to you
[12:10] what a meaning this could be
[12:13] what a meaning this could be if we could
[12:15] get out of the buzz of all the
[12:17] distractions
[12:19] if we could break away from all the
[12:21] worries
[12:22] and say Lord take me into your power
[12:26] Lord if I need correction to give me my
[12:29] correction let me rise higher
[12:33] how many say Lord that's my prayer
[12:37] everything has to work together the
[12:40] church has to pray the laity has to pray
[12:44] we all come together and pray and it
[12:47] brings us into the presence of God
[12:50] Hallelujah
[12:54] in the first Exodus
[12:56] the Bible said
[12:58] when the time of the promise Drew night
[13:02] when the time of the promised junai
[13:05] which God swore to Abraham
[13:08] then God began to move upon the scene
[13:11] when the time of that word to be
[13:14] fulfilled
[13:15] and when the time of that word was to be
[13:18] fulfilled the spirit of God began to
[13:21] move
[13:22] and God will choose predestinated people
[13:25] to help bring that word into fruition
[13:29] because God does nothing but he reveals
[13:32] it through Believers he he comes to
[13:34] Believers in other words brother random
[13:35] said if God is going to manifest a
[13:37] certain word he will predestinated
[13:40] Believers for that age to receive that
[13:42] word to catch that word
[13:45] and so when God was going to fulfill his
[13:48] word he had an amram and a jock a bit
[13:51] that was there to receive because they
[13:53] believed
[13:55] and brother Ritter said when the time
[13:57] came for God to fulfill his own word uh
[14:01] and amram and jochebed begun to to have
[14:05] a burden for they knew according to the
[14:08] prophecy we're about ready to get out of
[14:10] here
[14:11] and they started praying in the will of
[14:14] God
[14:15] they knew it was the will of God the
[14:17] plan of God and they were a part of that
[14:20] plan and God moved upon them to start
[14:23] praying in a certain way
[14:28] Hallelujah
[14:31] it's amazing have you ever thought how
[14:34] that how in the world Moses being raised
[14:37] in the Egyptian schools
[14:40] how did he escape the indoctrination of
[14:44] Egypt
[14:46] and brother Branham actually alludes to
[14:48] that thought he said how in the world
[14:50] did he escape the indoctrination as they
[14:53] taught him Egyptian ways and taught him
[14:56] the way and and brother Branham said how
[14:59] this happened
[15:01] what defused the indoctrination of Egypt
[15:05] upon the life of Moses was a mother
[15:09] who nursed him and raised him on her lap
[15:13] and she said Moses
[15:15] you are a chosen one of Gods
[15:20] God's hand is on you you're different
[15:23] than other boys
[15:25] you're raised for a purpose and you are
[15:29] going to deliver God's people
[15:31] and faith comes by hearing
[15:36] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[15:40] he believed his mother's words it had an
[15:44] effect upon him
[15:46] oh yeah he had his ups and downs and he
[15:49] had his Hall of mistakes like all of us
[15:51] do but still God's word will prevail
[15:58] Hallelujah
[15:59] Moses you are trolls of the Lord
[16:05] now the word of God
[16:07] produces faith
[16:11] there were several prophecies where God
[16:14] had told Moses after 400 years I will
[16:17] bring you out with a mighty hand
[16:21] and then Joseph said surely God will
[16:24] visit you you'll take my bones out
[16:29] God's good for his word in me
[16:32] and so Israel when they came under the
[16:35] cruel bondage they began to cry for
[16:37] deliverance
[16:39] now what made God hear them as they were
[16:42] praying according to the program of God
[16:46] they were praying in the will of God and
[16:49] faith comes by hearing
[16:52] if you want to be healed it's because
[16:54] there is healing for you
[16:56] they wanted Deliverance because there
[16:59] was Deliverance for them
[17:01] and they began to pray in the will of
[17:04] God lord deliver your people Lord get us
[17:08] out of here above all circumstances
[17:11] against the greatest militaries Against
[17:14] All Odds God deliver your people
[17:20] Hallelujah
[17:22] and brother random said now you're
[17:24] praying something
[17:26] he said they were crying in the will of
[17:28] God and God had to provide what he
[17:31] promised
[17:32] if you're praying for something out of
[17:35] the will of God you cannot have faith
[17:40] see but they were right in the will of
[17:42] God
[17:44] Hallelujah
[17:46] so we must understand the will of God in
[17:49] order to have faith
[17:51] you've got to understand the word of God
[17:53] the message that God has sent to us
[17:57] the Bible said be not unwise
[18:00] Ephesians 5 17 be not unwise but
[18:03] understanding what the will of the Lord
[18:06] is
[18:09] I don't think it's a time that we be
[18:11] casual
[18:17] I say this you know respectfully I I've
[18:19] talked to people that got good
[18:21] memorization but as shallow as shallow
[18:23] can be
[18:26] can tell you the quotes and quote to you
[18:28] but a shallow is shallow can be
[18:32] we need understanding from our hearts
[18:37] understanding what the will of God is
[18:41] furthermore understanding what the will
[18:43] of God is for our own individual lives
[18:47] how many would like that Lord I would
[18:49] like to understand my part
[18:51] in your great Plan of Redemption
[18:55] you know Elijah had marched right up
[18:57] into the face
[18:58] of Ahab and stuck his finger in his face
[19:01] and said it'll not rain
[19:03] until I call for it
[19:06] brother Branham said he did not stutter
[19:10] now you're talking about the king now
[19:13] you walk right up stuck his finger right
[19:16] at the end of his nose and said it is
[19:17] not going to rain until I call for it
[19:20] he said he knew where he was standing
[19:23] because he had thus saith the Lord
[19:27] see real Faith takes the fear away
[19:31] and that is based upon the word of God
[19:35] and Elijah now prayed and the Bible
[19:38] tells us he prayed and it rained not for
[19:41] the space of three and a half years
[19:44] he said he literally closed the heavens
[19:48] now this is amazing he said now why
[19:51] would a man pray that God would close
[19:54] the heavens he said people are starving
[19:57] people or he said but he knew the will
[20:00] of God
[20:01] he said the people had to repent God
[20:05] wanted them to repent
[20:08] so God shot the heavens not to destroy
[20:11] the people but to bring them back to the
[20:14] word of God
[20:15] [Applause]
[20:16] so the prophet he comes into alignment
[20:21] understanding the will of God praise the
[20:24] will of God shuts the heavens and this
[20:28] is not a man that was an angel he was a
[20:31] man subject to like passions like you
[20:33] and me he was a man with ups and downs
[20:36] but he caught the will of God and when
[20:40] he caught the will of God he prayed the
[20:43] will of God and he shot the heavens
[20:46] the Bible said the effectual fervent
[20:49] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[20:53] and he Compares any of us to Elijah that
[20:57] could shut the heavens
[20:59] there is power in your prayers
[21:03] but you must know the will of God you
[21:07] must understand what God wants from you
[21:11] [Applause]
[21:12] more than coming to church
[21:15] more than letting the preacher preach a
[21:17] sermon but I am going to be a part of
[21:21] God's word made manifest
[21:24] I have a part you have a part
[21:28] we need to create an atmosphere where
[21:31] God can come down and bring his word to
[21:34] fruition
[21:37] Hallelujah
[21:39] Hallelujah
[21:41] I'll say it as simple as brother Branham
[21:43] said it faith is the revelation of the
[21:47] will of God
[21:51] faith comes by hearing
[21:55] the word
[21:57] of God
[22:00] now brother Branham said that this word
[22:03] is a road map to power to the power of
[22:08] God
[22:10] but we also know power without character
[22:13] is satanic
[22:15] so God just can't throw power out to
[22:17] people because we'd be zapping everyone
[22:19] that disagreed with our Doctrine
[22:22] so brother random said that's why we he
[22:24] gives it out so sparingly
[22:29] but brother Branham said that word and
[22:32] I'm quoting verbatim out of unfailing
[22:34] realities of God this word will lead you
[22:37] to power
[22:39] now why in the world would brother
[22:41] Branham tell us that because you know
[22:43] Wicked and adulterous Generations sign
[22:46] Seekers and why would he you know put
[22:49] Power why would we want power I mean
[22:51] we're too humble for that
[22:55] because we need power
[22:58] we need power to drive the enemy off our
[23:01] promises
[23:03] we need power in our church for our
[23:06] young people to to see that God is alive
[23:09] and that he answers prayer and there is
[23:12] nothing too hard for God
[23:16] how many can say Amen
[23:19] now brother Branham said that he had
[23:21] traveled the nation so much he said I
[23:25] found it astounding I told my wife he
[23:28] said now I can tell anybody uh what road
[23:32] to take to maybe let's just use
[23:34] California he said and I could tell them
[23:36] how much time it'll take them to get
[23:38] there within 15 minutes
[23:42] whether it be Florida whether it be
[23:44] Missouri whether it be Louisiana I can
[23:47] tell them he said because I have done it
[23:50] so much
[23:52] he said I just know it I understand it I
[23:55] I've experienced it he said that's why
[23:59] God wants us to know his word
[24:02] he said he wants us to know it inside
[24:04] and out and and be so versed with it
[24:09] to know that in my name you will cast
[24:13] out devils and it works
[24:16] and the prayer Faith Works
[24:21] now he said that word
[24:24] he said you that word will lead you to
[24:28] power
[24:28] he said that's the way God wants us to
[24:31] know his word we have just traveled in
[24:33] it we've tried it he said no his map is
[24:36] the Bible and the Bible is the road map
[24:39] that leads to his power
[24:43] he said faith
[24:46] leads you to power
[24:49] power
[24:50] produces the promise
[24:57] okay
[24:58] so God can't give power to those that
[25:01] are operating in their own will
[25:10] but God gives power to those that are
[25:12] operating in his will
[25:15] who is representing his kingdom
[25:17] and fighting to establish his kingdom
[25:21] amen
[25:24] so faith in the word of God leads us to
[25:28] power
[25:29] and that power produces God's promise
[25:34] Hallelujah
[25:38] now brother Branham said
[25:41] in first John chapter 5 verse 14 in the
[25:44] Pro gaming age he said this is the
[25:46] confidence that we have in him if we ask
[25:49] anything say anything
[25:51] if we ask anything according to his will
[25:54] he heareth us
[25:56] whoa
[25:59] if we ask anything according to his will
[26:03] he heareth us
[26:08] I know the devil tells you that your
[26:10] prayers don't go beyond that ceiling and
[26:12] and scarcely gets a foot over your head
[26:15] but the Bible said he does
[26:20] he said now we ask what is the will of
[26:23] God
[26:24] he said there is only one way to know
[26:27] the will of God that is by the word of
[26:31] God
[26:33] there it is if it's not the word you
[26:35] cannot have it so we can't ask unless
[26:39] it's in the word
[26:41] Hallelujah
[26:45] now here's a word for you
[26:47] God is not willing that any would perish
[26:51] but that all would come to repentance
[26:55] that is the will of God
[26:59] there is no one here that God Wills to
[27:02] be lost
[27:03] God Wills every one of us to be saved
[27:07] God will for us to be healed God will
[27:10] for us to be filled God Wills for us to
[27:14] live in Christian victory
[27:19] that includes you
[27:21] do you know when Jesus died on the cross
[27:24] he died for every person on the face of
[27:29] the Earth
[27:31] front words and backwards it is nothing
[27:35] you have done or I it is the gift of God
[27:41] everything in the Old Testament pointed
[27:45] to Calvary
[27:47] every Prophet everyone everything
[27:50] pointed there
[27:53] and everyone can be saved
[27:56] everyone can be healed
[28:00] now I know Redemption we know that
[28:03] there's an economy of God and Redemption
[28:05] are those that were in his mind before
[28:07] the foundations of the world and
[28:09] redeemed as a person a certain class but
[28:12] everyone can be saved
[28:15] that wants to be saved
[28:19] brother Branham said Redemption the word
[28:21] Redemption which means to bring back
[28:23] pertains only to the elect we understand
[28:25] that but anyone can be saved
[28:31] God not willing that any he is not a man
[28:34] that he should lie not willing that any
[28:37] would perish
[28:39] he looked at Cain and said
[28:41] if you do what your brother does I will
[28:44] receive you
[28:46] serpent seat
[28:52] but how shall they hear without a
[28:55] preacher
[28:57] and how shall they preach
[29:00] except they be sent
[29:04] see the preacher's job is easy in one
[29:07] sense
[29:08] because all he's supposed to do is point
[29:11] you
[29:12] to Calvary
[29:15] because Calvary is where you get over
[29:17] sugar diabetes
[29:20] Calvary is where you overcome depression
[29:24] Calvary is where you cast down nervous
[29:27] devils
[29:28] Calvary is where you overcome
[29:30] homosexuality
[29:32] Avery is where you overcome yourself
[29:35] [Applause]
[29:38] it is the cure
[29:41] to the human sickness
[29:43] and every preacher ought to be pointing
[29:46] to Calvary there is your salvation there
[29:50] is your Victory there is your healing
[29:53] there is your joy
[29:58] brother Adam said as I look across the
[30:01] nation going Beyond this Camp 1964. he
[30:04] said I'm fully persuaded that the people
[30:06] are not getting to Christ
[30:10] I believe it's the enemy that's brought
[30:12] the hindrance because the reason I
[30:14] believe this is he is not the object
[30:18] that they are pointing to
[30:24] do you know Doctrine does not save you
[30:27] [Music]
[30:32] Doctrine what you believe cannot save
[30:35] you who you believe does
[30:41] Hallelujah brother Branham said I'm
[30:43] afraid they're appointing he said to a
[30:46] Doctrine to a Dogma to a party to a
[30:50] sensation instead of pointing them to
[30:52] Christ the word
[30:54] [Applause]
[30:55] Hallelujah
[30:57] but God's program will forever be the
[31:01] blood
[31:02] from the time of the Garden of Eden down
[31:05] through the Exodus down Through the Ages
[31:08] God's program is the blood they've tried
[31:12] to educate it and denominated and make
[31:15] it a philosophy it is an experience that
[31:19] every one of us can feel received
[31:21] tonight
[31:23] the blood of Jesus Christ does not
[31:25] discriminate it's for the white man for
[31:28] the black man
[31:29] [Music]
[31:31] is for the Catholic it is for the
[31:34] Presbyterian it is for the methodists
[31:38] Hallelujah
[31:41] brother Branham said notice in the
[31:43] discernments the angel not one time ever
[31:46] said what church you belong to
[31:48] [Applause]
[31:50] if they were catholic he healed them
[31:52] if they were Baptists he healed them
[31:55] if they were women preachers he healed
[31:57] them
[31:58] [Applause]
[32:02] one blood for all nations
[32:05] one blood for all Races
[32:08] Hallelujah
[32:10] and it can free anyone from sin
[32:15] Hallelujah
[32:17] we believe in healing lines
[32:20] but the real healing line is Calvary
[32:25] we need to be lined up under Calvary and
[32:28] God let God let your spirit go to Every
[32:31] sick person in the sound of my voice by
[32:35] his stripes your heels
[32:43] Hallelujah
[32:45] he said we're only trying to get them
[32:48] to look to the man that already healed
[32:51] him
[32:53] and to get them to accept that by faith
[32:58] I believe every sick person was healed
[33:01] when Jesus died at Calvary
[33:07] there are no great ones Among Us
[33:12] healing does not come from a man
[33:15] healing comes from your faith in a
[33:17] finished work
[33:19] James said how can you have faith when
[33:22] you respect one another and when you
[33:25] when you have a respect of persons when
[33:28] we are all children of one father
[33:30] how can you have faith when you're
[33:33] looking to men and looking at the wrong
[33:35] place you must Center your faith on
[33:38] Calvary
[33:40] Paul did it Peter did it Mary had a
[33:44] shout and fit
[33:47] Mary had to do the same thing
[33:50] any man that ever reaches heaven will
[33:53] have to have his own personal revelation
[33:55] in the cross of calvary
[33:57] without any prejudice
[34:00] without any account of rank wealth
[34:05] personal friendship or popularity
[34:09] he has no respecter of persons
[34:15] God does not care about persons
[34:22] Hallelujah
[34:26] praise the Lord
[34:30] so when the preacher comes
[34:33] with the word of God
[34:35] he begins to preach to you
[34:38] you can be healed
[34:40] it's God's perfect will
[34:43] to heal you
[34:49] how did Brother Brennan get those
[34:50] results
[34:52] he didn't go through personal interviews
[34:53] and say well God can't I used to wonder
[34:56] that as a young man how there could be
[34:58] 20 000 people there and they receive
[35:00] their healing instantaneous because
[35:02] healing is for all
[35:07] how many believe that say Amen
[35:10] now all the preacher does is he comes
[35:13] with the word and shows you the will of
[35:15] God
[35:16] he's gifted to do it that way
[35:18] So Divine Healing is for everyone and
[35:22] the preacher is to preach the promises
[35:24] of God we are to preach the nature the
[35:28] unchanging nature of God if he was a
[35:31] Healer he'll always be a Healer and that
[35:34] his attitude cannot change if he did it
[35:37] for the woman with the blood issue he
[35:39] can do it for you if he did it for the
[35:41] thief on the cross he'll do it for you
[35:43] it is the unchanging attitude and nature
[35:47] of almighty God we must understand what
[35:52] Calvary done for us we must understand
[35:55] the principles of Faith healing and
[35:58] deliverance
[36:03] and there are principles that we must
[36:06] approach God by
[36:08] faith comes by hearing
[36:11] the word of God in other words spiritual
[36:14] understanding is revelation Revelation
[36:17] comes by hearing
[36:20] everybody get it
[36:22] so brother Branham talked about
[36:25] uh Samson
[36:28] contrary to
[36:31] you know the Sunday School pictures
[36:34] you know Samson is always ripped and
[36:37] you know spinning a lion on his finger
[36:40] brother Benham said now there would have
[36:42] been no mystery there
[36:44] because the whole story was they were
[36:46] trying to find the mystery
[36:49] but God did not choose a muscle-bound
[36:52] man
[36:54] brother Branham said he was a
[36:55] curly-headed little shrimp
[36:58] now we know the nature of God if we
[37:00] could take an entire sermon on the
[37:02] nature of God to say why he chose a
[37:04] curly-headed little shrimp
[37:07] see it had nothing to do with Man's
[37:11] power
[37:13] see God wanted the glory out of this
[37:16] and you know men are proud creatures
[37:18] that love to share the glory of God
[37:21] but God will share his glory with no one
[37:24] so he chooses a man they'll say I just
[37:28] don't know how he does it
[37:30] unless you knew his God
[37:34] then you could understand it so brother
[37:35] Brandon said now Samson was the
[37:38] curly-headed little shrimp
[37:40] he said but then when he got in trouble
[37:42] the spirit of God would come upon him
[37:45] and he said whether it was a lion he
[37:48] would rip it apart with his bare hands
[37:51] he said not because he was strong but
[37:54] because he had thus saith the Lord
[37:59] see he knew the will of God
[38:03] he knew he was put on Earth with a
[38:06] purpose to deliver the people of Israel
[38:08] and whether it was a lion or a thousand
[38:12] Philistines or whatever the enemy it was
[38:15] going to crumble and fall because he had
[38:19] a revelation of the will of God
[38:23] now Samson is not a man that I would
[38:26] have chose
[38:27] Samson got in trouble he had woman
[38:30] trouble and I I honestly think out of
[38:33] all the characters of the Bible I say oh
[38:36] my
[38:37] he goes into harlot's house he's he's
[38:40] always getting in trouble and I said
[38:42] Lord
[38:44] how
[38:47] the Lord in these things is speaking to
[38:49] us
[38:51] and then brother Branham answered the
[38:53] minute the the mystery even coming out
[38:57] of a harlot's house he lifts the gates
[38:59] of Gaza under the power of God how in
[39:02] the world is this working is because God
[39:05] was not looking at Samson he was looking
[39:09] at Seven Locks which represented his
[39:12] promise and God was not obligated to
[39:15] Samson he was obligated to the Covenant
[39:19] that he made with Samson
[39:22] and when God gave a covenant to Abraham
[39:24] no matter what Abraham done God sold
[39:28] himself into that promise and God made a
[39:32] promise he'll have a church without
[39:34] spots without wrinkle he has tied
[39:38] himself
[39:41] is obligated to bring forth his words no
[39:46] matter what we look like he is obligated
[39:49] to the message
[39:54] oh yeah
[39:59] Hallelujah
[40:01] Samson actually represented us studied
[40:04] in in the message you'll find Samson
[40:06] represented the bride
[40:11] now God's looking at Samson
[40:14] and as long as God could see the cover
[40:16] remember it grew back I will restore
[40:19] saith the Lord
[40:21] as long as that Covenant was there he
[40:24] could claim any promise
[40:26] and I think we could do it tonight I'm
[40:28] gonna claim him as my healer I'm going
[40:30] to claim the Holy Spirit I'm going to
[40:32] claim victory over this enemy
[40:34] [Applause]
[40:38] God's gonna give it to me
[40:40] because it ain't based upon my ups and
[40:42] downs it is based upon the unmoving rock
[40:46] of the revelation of God's word and
[40:49] Faith cometh
[40:51] the hearing
[40:55] hearing the word of God lord Let It Go a
[40:59] song you wrote past my ears to my over
[41:02] my head to my heart
[41:05] how many would like that
[41:07] in these meetings
[41:09] maybe sickness is holding you
[41:12] maybe an enemy is holding maybe there's
[41:14] a place you can't move over
[41:17] God will be looking down from heaven
[41:20] you need to tear into it and run it to
[41:23] Pieces by the power of God
[41:30] you don't have to live under your
[41:32] god-given privileges
[41:35] it is revelation
[41:38] that gives us Authority
[41:40] over the devil
[41:42] is that what the prophet said
[41:44] it is the river now Faith or Revelation
[41:47] comes by hearing
[41:49] the word the will of God
[41:52] and it is the revelation of God that
[41:56] gives us Authority
[41:58] over the devil
[42:00] now brother random said that's where
[42:03] eternal life Lays
[42:04] is knowing him personally yourself
[42:07] know his nature
[42:10] know what he does
[42:13] how he acts
[42:15] and when you do that you'll have a
[42:18] knowledge of his word
[42:20] and what he wants you to do
[42:23] see there's where Faith Comes you cannot
[42:27] step halfway thinking he might do it or
[42:29] maybe perhaps he will you've got to know
[42:33] exactly his will and you've got to
[42:35] believe it with all your heart
[42:38] [Applause]
[42:41] that's why God sent us a message that
[42:44] cannot be disputed
[42:46] because in order to have faith you have
[42:48] to have something perfect to have faith
[42:51] in
[42:53] because you and I are the moving object
[42:55] the God's word is the anchor to the soul
[42:59] so God gave us the perfect
[43:01] interpretation of the word with Divine
[43:03] Vindication to eliminate all questions
[43:07] so now we would know the perfect will of
[43:10] God in this hour
[43:12] and now we could begin to operate in the
[43:15] will of God
[43:18] which will bring us to power
[43:21] [Applause]
[43:24] which will produce the word
[43:30] there will be a resurrection
[43:36] you know Mary when she said beat unto me
[43:38] according to Thy word that God used a 15
[43:41] year old girl to bring Redemption to the
[43:44] entire Earth
[43:47] he used the faith
[43:49] of a 15 year old any 15 year olds in
[43:53] here raise your hand anybody higher
[43:56] brother raise your hand couple
[43:59] he used the faith of a 15 year old
[44:02] child
[44:06] to redeem you and me
[44:09] to bring he used her faith
[44:13] be it unto me
[44:17] this is the way God works
[44:24] so brother Branham said there is a great
[44:26] enemy of faith
[44:35] scary
[44:39] he said the great enemy of faith
[44:43] is little
[44:44] timid
[44:46] hope
[44:51] he said the greatest enemy faith has
[44:56] is Hope
[44:58] because when a person is hopeful he said
[45:00] they actually
[45:02] leave faith
[45:04] he said now hope agrees with the Bible
[45:08] and he said hope believes the word of
[45:11] God
[45:12] and he said
[45:14] hope believes all of that but says look
[45:18] at my condition
[45:20] he said now Faith doesn't look at any
[45:22] condition
[45:24] faith comes and said I don't care about
[45:26] conditions God said so it's mine
[45:30] and he said that Faith actually flexes
[45:33] its muscles
[45:37] he said now hope looks for something way
[45:41] off
[45:42] but Faith claims it right now
[45:45] [Applause]
[45:47] he said hope expects it'll get better
[45:49] one day and he said as long as the devil
[45:52] can make you look off to another day
[45:54] that's as good as he wants he said but
[45:57] Faith takes the challenge right now and
[46:00] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[46:02] I'm not going to wait till tomorrow I'm
[46:05] going to believe God right now
[46:07] [Applause]
[46:10] Hallelujah he said Faith wands up its
[46:13] muscles
[46:16] but hope is passive
[46:19] he said hope is not active
[46:22] it's a bystander
[46:25] Hallelujah
[46:28] I I love history
[46:31] and I was doing a study on Alexander
[46:33] dowey and you know brother Branham spoke
[46:35] of Alexander dally and as I broke into
[46:38] his histories I was absolutely
[46:40] amazed thousands times thousands was
[46:44] healed thousands he was he came in the
[46:47] 1920s actually he was in the 1800s but
[46:50] he he lasted to the 1920s and great
[46:53] leaders like FF Bosworth and John G Lake
[46:56] and many of the great leaders and
[46:58] healing revivalists of the 20s came out
[47:00] from under him
[47:01] but how he came about Divine Healing
[47:03] which was lost in the ages the Bubonic
[47:06] plague had struck Australia in 1875 and
[47:10] I just asked that you bear with me I
[47:12] don't even have a clue what time it is
[47:16] praise the Lord thank you
[47:19] Bubonic plague 1875 had struck Sydney
[47:24] Australia and he reseted that his heart
[47:26] was Heavy because he had been visiting
[47:29] about 30 beds of the dying his flock
[47:32] that was dying and he had buried about
[47:35] 40 of them and he said that that as he
[47:39] cried out to God where is the god of the
[47:41] Bible that heals he said no prayer would
[47:44] reach his ear and he would cry and said
[47:46] Lord your arm is not shortened that you
[47:49] cannot say be saved he said but no
[47:52] matter what he said he couldn't turn the
[47:54] tide and he said this was not bad people
[47:56] he said these were strong Christians
[47:59] that were dying and leaving widows and
[48:02] leaving orphans and and he can do
[48:05] nothing about it and he said he felt
[48:08] like the enemy was just mocking as he
[48:10] would visit and try to encourage the
[48:12] people that lost their loved ones
[48:15] and he and he said he was he had his
[48:18] head hands in his head his head in his
[48:20] hands and he was like Lord you know what
[48:24] what is happening he said you've got to
[48:26] speak to me and he's praying and he's
[48:29] crying and as he's crying the lord gave
[48:32] him one verse
[48:33] in Acts chapter 10 verse 38 it he says
[48:38] that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[48:41] the Holy Ghost and with power who went
[48:44] about doing good healing all that was
[48:48] oppressed of the devil
[48:51] and at that moment he realized oh
[48:55] the devil is the defiler
[48:57] and Christ is the Healer
[49:01] and it came from God he just saw that
[49:04] distinction that it was not sickness was
[49:07] not the will of God but it was The
[49:10] Offspring of Satan
[49:12] and he said is this is he thought he
[49:14] goes he all the sudden when that one
[49:17] verse came the door of healing opened
[49:20] wide
[49:21] and he said at that moment a knock came
[49:24] at the door and they they came in and
[49:27] said Mary is dying Pastor you've got to
[49:30] come to Mary and so he grabbed his hat
[49:33] and cloak and he rushed down to see the
[49:36] little girl
[49:37] and when he got to her bed she was
[49:39] groaning and grinding and clenching her
[49:42] teeth she was in total Agony blood and
[49:45] froth was coming from her mouth she was
[49:47] distorted in pain and he said as he
[49:51] looked at her his anger became and it
[49:54] began to grow toward it and he said oh
[49:57] Lord if you would give me a sharp sword
[49:59] to cut the serpent that's destroying
[50:02] this young child's life
[50:05] and he said there was a doctor there and
[50:07] the doctor was trying to comfort the
[50:10] mother the doctor looked over it uh
[50:12] Alexander dowey and said it does not God
[50:15] work in mysterious ways he said this is
[50:19] not the work of God he said this is the
[50:23] work of the devil
[50:24] [Music]
[50:27] and the the doctor was offended turned
[50:30] on his heels and and went out
[50:33] and he said he looked at it he became
[50:35] angry beyond description
[50:38] and he said he was looking at it and
[50:40] said this is not God's way
[50:42] he said this is not the will of God
[50:46] because Jesus healed all say all there
[50:49] was a press of the devil
[50:52] and so we looked at the mother and said
[50:54] why did you call for me she said I
[50:57] thought you could help he said we can
[50:58] help we can pray and he said so he
[51:02] prayed and he said it wasn't even
[51:03] eloquent but he began to pray and call
[51:06] upon God and quote the scripture you're
[51:08] the Healer of all of our diseases and
[51:10] and by your strengths we are healed and
[51:13] he prays and he said as he prayed he
[51:16] felt something come upon it and he said
[51:19] she's healed
[51:23] they came out of prayer and she is
[51:25] Motionless
[51:28] and the mother said is she dead he said
[51:30] no she's not dead
[51:31] she sleeps as a young babe would sleep
[51:37] he snapped his finger and opened her
[51:40] eyes and she sat up in bed and was
[51:43] completely healed
[51:53] now that was always in the word
[51:56] but God gave him a revelation by the
[51:59] word and Revelation comes by hearing the
[52:02] word of God which brought power which
[52:05] brought forth the promise of God
[52:08] and I want to say tonight it is so
[52:11] important that we know our enemy he has
[52:15] come to kill and to still and to destroy
[52:18] and the nature of the devil does not
[52:21] change like God's nature does not change
[52:23] and the devil will always put you in a
[52:26] prison house
[52:28] and the will always bind your joy the
[52:31] devil will always make you critical and
[52:33] tie you up but God will set you free
[52:37] [Applause]
[52:40] Hallelujah it is the devil that puts
[52:43] unbondage it is the devil that makes you
[52:45] sick it's the devil that brings
[52:47] confusion it is the devil that breaks
[52:50] the word of God
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:52] Satan is the enemy of the human race
[52:55] for this purpose Jesus was manifested
[53:00] that he might destroy the works of the
[53:04] devil
[53:05] [Applause]
[53:08] sickness is a work of the devil diabetes
[53:12] is a work of the devil high blood
[53:14] pressure is a work of the devil
[53:21] the Bible said Jesus came out and said
[53:24] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[53:27] because he has anointed me to preach the
[53:30] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[53:32] heal the brokenhearted to preach deliver
[53:34] it say Deliverance to preach Deliverance
[53:38] to the captives and the recovering of
[53:40] the sight of the Blind and the Senate
[53:43] Liberty them that are bruised
[53:47] the Bible said Jesus healed all manner
[53:51] of sickness
[53:52] and he healed all that was oppressed of
[53:55] the devil
[53:56] and every time he went to a funeral he
[53:59] broke up the funeral he would raise the
[54:02] dead because he was destroying the works
[54:05] of the devil he healed the eyes of the
[54:08] blind he brought the tormented back to a
[54:11] normal State because he was destroying
[54:14] the works of the devil
[54:17] Jesus said as the father sent me so send
[54:20] I you and he commanded his disciples to
[54:24] cast out devils and to heal the sick
[54:27] because the ministry of Jesus Christ
[54:30] continues in the body of Christ
[54:34] if Jesus was to destroy the works of the
[54:38] devil then his body does the same thing
[54:42] our preaching should be to tear down the
[54:46] strongholds of the enemy
[54:48] our preaching should there be combat
[54:50] sickness and to set the captive free
[54:54] are we Believers here tonight
[54:57] the preaching of the Gospel is to turn
[55:00] over the devil's Kingdom to cast out the
[55:03] evil one
[55:07] to destroy sickness to destroy
[55:10] depression to destroy complexes to
[55:13] destroy the enemy
[55:19] and you need to start in your seat right
[55:21] now devil you have no power over me
[55:26] I will not cry another tear
[55:28] I will not take another beating
[55:32] Christ is my deliverer Christ is my joy
[55:36] Christ is my peace
[55:40] faith comes by hearing
[55:43] the word of God are you a believer in
[55:47] the word of the Lord
[55:48] Satan is a brother Branham said Satan is
[55:51] afraid say afraid
[55:53] he is afraid of the blood of Jesus
[55:57] Christ
[55:59] what
[56:01] what I thought we're the ones that are
[56:03] supposed to be trembling
[56:06] do you know that
[56:08] the devil is afraid
[56:11] of what you have clothed yourself in
[56:17] a Blood Washed
[56:19] Church
[56:22] brother random said he is afraid of it
[56:25] God came down and proved that no
[56:28] sickness could stand it was not William
[56:30] Branham
[56:33] he was a preacher pointing to Calvary
[56:36] and it worked
[56:42] now did you know that
[56:44] just as Moses was given a command to
[56:47] deliver the people
[56:49] that the church is commanded to deliver
[56:51] God's people
[56:56] that's exactly right
[56:58] and he told the disciples when you enter
[56:59] into the city
[57:01] Open the Eyes of the blind
[57:03] cleanse the leper
[57:05] freely you have received freely give
[57:07] you will tread upon the head of serpents
[57:12] is that what he said
[57:13] you will tread
[57:16] upon the heads of serpent
[57:18] and nothing shall stand before you
[57:21] faith comes by hearing
[57:24] the word of God
[57:26] faith is a direct revelation of God
[57:30] faith is the substance of things hoped
[57:33] for
[57:35] not timid hope but we actually possess
[57:38] the possession of what hope is looking
[57:40] for
[57:42] faith is not a peacemaker
[57:50] Hallelujah brother Branham said now if
[57:53] you believe it
[57:54] you will see the glory of God
[57:57] that's what he told Martha his her
[58:00] brother's Dead four days he said if you
[58:03] will believe
[58:05] you will see the glory of almighty God
[58:11] and brother Branham said this he said
[58:13] now Faith overcome death
[58:16] faith is the victory over death
[58:18] faith is the victory over sin faith is
[58:22] the victory over sickness faith is the
[58:24] victory over worry faith is the victory
[58:27] over frustrations faith is the victory
[58:31] that overcometh the world he said not a
[58:34] floating faith
[58:36] but a real faith
[58:38] faith is not a peacemaker
[58:43] hmm
[58:45] how may say Lord Give Me Faith
[58:49] he said Faith overcomes
[58:52] he said faith is a conqueror
[58:55] it conquers conquering Victory is the
[58:58] same conquer means to beat down to
[59:01] override to handcuff and to throw in
[59:05] prison it means the sin that ruled you
[59:08] now you rule it
[59:14] Hallelujah
[59:16] do you love the Lord
[59:19] brother Branham said if it's against the
[59:21] word it's your enemy
[59:23] that's that's strong
[59:25] anything that is not the word is your
[59:28] enemy
[59:30] now now Joshua overcome the Wilderness
[59:34] by faith he overcome every Temptation by
[59:37] faith
[59:38] and when they arrived to the promised
[59:40] land God said now it's yours
[59:43] but you've got to go take it
[59:46] so their job was no matter how big the
[59:49] giant no matter how big the wild cities
[59:52] their job was to take a step of faith
[59:57] and these weren't Warriors
[59:59] these were people traveling through the
[1:00:01] desert but because God was looking at
[1:00:05] the commission and they were willing to
[1:00:07] step out on that commission God was
[1:00:10] obligated to defend them
[1:00:12] so now all they had to do if the Giants
[1:00:15] had would reach the lights is take your
[1:00:18] sword and just
[1:00:23] and God would go
[1:00:29] start getting a little more confidence
[1:00:36] will be
[1:00:39] they're just Fallen even before he hits
[1:00:41] him he just
[1:00:43] foreign
[1:00:45] that's right brother Branham said before
[1:00:47] they could get to the line they would
[1:00:49] raise up and be healed
[1:00:53] but you got to have faith
[1:00:56] this ain't a hope so this ain't timid
[1:00:58] hope this is Faith
[1:01:00] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[1:01:04] brother Brennan said the very faith that
[1:01:06] you move your finger with is the very
[1:01:08] faith that performs Miracles we don't
[1:01:11] need a lot of faith we just need to know
[1:01:14] what God wants us to do with our faith
[1:01:16] [Applause]
[1:01:19] everyone here has plenty of faith
[1:01:22] but God wants us to utterly destroy
[1:01:26] take no prisoners do not bow to devils
[1:01:30] that's what he said do not bow to them
[1:01:32] don't even speak of them you will not
[1:01:35] run
[1:01:36] but your enemies will flee before you
[1:01:39] you will not bow you will not murmur or
[1:01:43] complain but the shout of the king is in
[1:01:46] the camp
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:01:53] praise the Lord
[1:01:55] I think we ought to have a little
[1:01:58] righteous indignation
[1:02:01] did you know the Bible says to abhor
[1:02:03] that which is evil
[1:02:05] it means a holy anger
[1:02:08] do you know the Bible says resist the
[1:02:10] devil and he will flee how many believe
[1:02:13] that here tonight
[1:02:15] the Bible says give no place to the
[1:02:18] devil
[1:02:19] I want you to look at shamgar can I I
[1:02:21] have no idea what time it is
[1:02:24] can I go a little further
[1:02:27] yeah you know shamgar we know the story
[1:02:29] so well and brother Branham talked about
[1:02:31] him making his grain silos and bringing
[1:02:34] in his Harvest and and what a proud man
[1:02:36] he was and then the enemy said you know
[1:02:38] we're going to take what shamgar has
[1:02:41] we're going to take it so uh shamgar
[1:02:44] sees them coming down the road Trump and
[1:02:47] they they start taking his corn and he
[1:02:49] said please don't please don't take my
[1:02:52] well a little
[1:02:54] don't take it all could you leave some
[1:02:56] no we're going to take the wheat
[1:02:59] and we're going to take your chickens
[1:03:01] and I like eggs so I'm going to take
[1:03:04] your eggs
[1:03:05] and your milk cow don't take my milk cow
[1:03:07] please have mercy Mr devil don't take my
[1:03:11] milk cow
[1:03:12] and he took every bit of it before he
[1:03:15] left he grabbed shamgar by the face and
[1:03:18] he just pushed him down on the ground
[1:03:19] and everyone gave him a swift kick on
[1:03:22] their March out
[1:03:24] well maybe this next camp meeting the
[1:03:27] devil will leave me alone
[1:03:34] next year come along and he's ready for
[1:03:36] a good camp meeting and Trump Trump
[1:03:39] trump here he comes
[1:03:41] oh
[1:03:42] who now he's shaking oh no they didn't
[1:03:46] forget where the camp meeting was Trump
[1:03:48] trump they probably faced him down to
[1:03:51] the ground and they steal his chickens
[1:03:52] and
[1:03:54] three camps go by pretty soon when he
[1:03:56] comes to Camp there's there's just no
[1:03:58] joy at all
[1:03:59] it's sitting in the back just
[1:04:03] been in the message all my life it just
[1:04:05] don't work for me
[1:04:10] and God is sitting there going how long
[1:04:12] are you going to take this man
[1:04:16] and you know this is amazing part
[1:04:18] brother Branham said one day they came
[1:04:20] in and shamgar was not looking at them
[1:04:22] he looked at his wife
[1:04:24] and she's drawn up he looked at his kids
[1:04:26] and said you know what
[1:04:30] my loss is actually affecting my whole
[1:04:33] family
[1:04:37] my defeats is affecting the faith of my
[1:04:41] children and my wife
[1:04:43] how are they going to have confidence
[1:04:45] in the God that I serve
[1:04:48] and admitted he thought that the Holy
[1:04:51] Spirit gave him a slap on the back right
[1:04:53] man
[1:04:55] who are you
[1:04:56] I'm an Israelite
[1:04:58] we're different than every other nation
[1:05:00] in the world
[1:05:02] if I was just an Israelite that'd be one
[1:05:04] thing but we are the people of God and
[1:05:07] the Holy Spirit slaps him on the back
[1:05:08] again and furthermore I am a circumcised
[1:05:12] child of Abraham and the Holy Spirit
[1:05:14] slaps him on the back sometimes we've
[1:05:17] got to encourage ourselves in the Lord I
[1:05:20] am a believer
[1:05:22] I am an overcomer
[1:05:24] God has called me with a Divine Purpose
[1:05:28] in my life
[1:05:30] pretty soon brother said if you don't
[1:05:32] believe it say it until you believe it
[1:05:35] we ought to have a positive confession
[1:05:37] and as he said it he just felt an
[1:05:40] unction of strength and he said I'm sick
[1:05:43] and tired of it brother said we need
[1:05:45] righteous indignation
[1:05:48] we need to have a right that the devil
[1:05:51] is our enemy and God commissioned us to
[1:05:55] destroy the works of the devil
[1:06:01] and so he just looked around and he
[1:06:03] grabbed the first thing and think about
[1:06:05] it he's overcome
[1:06:07] and he just starts walking out to 600
[1:06:09] men
[1:06:11] and they're laughing
[1:06:13] and then they're like he's serious
[1:06:19] and they're like laughing until he goes
[1:06:21] boom and a head goes over the moon
[1:06:24] and they're like dear God he's
[1:06:26] is this shamgar
[1:06:29] and they started dropping like flies
[1:06:32] God wants us just to have a little faith
[1:06:35] in it
[1:06:36] God wants us to quit sitting there just
[1:06:39] just relishing in our failure realistic
[1:06:43] in our in our inability instead of
[1:06:46] looking to God it's like God you
[1:06:48] promised me
[1:06:50] that I would be the header not to tell
[1:06:52] and my enemies will turn their backs
[1:06:56] Lord you promise me healing Lord you
[1:06:59] promise me Deliverance

[1:07:11] promised where we would meet you would
[1:07:13] be there

[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:20] it's your promise Lord
[1:07:23] we are born again of the spirit of God
[1:07:26] the circumcised children of Abraham
[1:07:32] and I'm sick and tired
[1:07:35] of being sick and tired
[1:07:39] you told me I could have my backslidden
[1:07:42] husband
[1:07:45] you told me I could claim my children
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:50] you pulled me Lord
[1:07:52] [Applause]
[1:07:53] I'm not just a denomination I'm the
[1:07:56] elected bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:00] and I know what you want done with your
[1:08:03] words
[1:08:06] May the spirit of God begin to move
[1:08:09] pick up your Ox goat
[1:08:12] make the devil nervous
[1:08:18] get a fighting spirit in there Caleb
[1:08:22] got your Ox goat
[1:08:24] tell the devil he was defeated at
[1:08:27] Calvary
[1:08:29] tell him you're not taking it no more
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:36] Faith rise up
[1:08:38] the devil you Bluff long enough
[1:08:41] my Lord crushed your backbone
[1:08:45] all you have is words
[1:08:48] and I'm gonna shut your mouth tonight
[1:08:55] not by power not by might but by my
[1:08:59] spirit saith the Lord
[1:09:02] but you've got to get tired of being
[1:09:05] pushed around
[1:09:06] you got to get tired of losing
[1:09:09] you got to get tired of living under
[1:09:12] your god-given privileges
[1:09:19] Hallelujah
[1:09:23] health
[1:09:25] when he began to think like that the
[1:09:27] Holy Spirit come upon him
[1:09:30] would he began to talk like that the
[1:09:32] Holy Spirit come upon him
[1:09:35] when we begin to believe like that the
[1:09:37] Holy Spirit comes upon us
[1:09:40] God give us a backbone
[1:09:43] God give us a faith in the word that you
[1:09:46] have sent us
[1:09:48] you have healing claim it you have your
[1:09:51] loved ones claim it
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:57] who has believed our report
[1:10:01] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:10:03] revealed
[1:10:04] brother Branham said in the Sixth Seal
[1:10:07] that the arm of the Lord was represented
[1:10:09] by the right hand of God the power of
[1:10:13] God who hath believed the report of the
[1:10:17] Gospel you know that's the first verse
[1:10:19] of Isaiah 53 that he was wounded for our
[1:10:23] transgressions by his stripes we are
[1:10:25] healed
[1:10:25] who has believed that report and to whom
[1:10:30] is the arm of the Lord revealed the arm
[1:10:33] of the Lord is revealed to them that
[1:10:36] believe his report
[1:10:39] the power of God is available
[1:10:42] to them that will believe him
[1:10:45] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[1:10:49] and when the Believers believed in The
[1:10:51] Exodus the arm of God stretched forth
[1:10:54] and released two million of them
[1:10:57] the very arm of God that released two
[1:10:59] million Jews can release you of your
[1:11:02] suffering
[1:11:05] the blood of the Lamb of woolly lamb in
[1:11:08] The Exodus released two million
[1:11:10] Believers what will the blood of God do
[1:11:14] and I'm asking you who has believed his
[1:11:18] report
[1:11:19] it's a question
[1:11:21] who has believed his report
[1:11:24] and to whom
[1:11:26] is the power of God revealed
[1:11:34] and in other words who is the word of
[1:11:37] God manifested to
[1:11:40] healing power lays in Calvary
[1:11:44] deliverance and freedom
[1:11:47] lays in Calvary
[1:11:49] did you know brother Branham said God is
[1:11:52] just as obligated to heal you as he is
[1:11:55] to save you
[1:11:58] a statement
[1:12:00] that is just as much the will of God
[1:12:03] to heal your body
[1:12:06] Christ's attitude is the same
[1:12:11] you say well I'm battling with unbelief
[1:12:13] the blood of Jesus Christ kills unbelief
[1:12:18] so brother Branham said he said they
[1:12:19] killed the very source
[1:12:22] and when Jesus died for our he or was
[1:12:25] opened his wombs his wounds for healing
[1:12:27] he was not just physical healing many
[1:12:30] times as we get older we need physical
[1:12:31] healing and and the young people can't
[1:12:34] even touch that they can't grasp that
[1:12:36] yet
[1:12:38] but it went deeper into the spirit Realm
[1:12:42] that God can actually there are children
[1:12:44] that live under terrible circumstances
[1:12:47] abused and can never speak about it
[1:12:50] and God knows all about it
[1:12:53] there is a blood that can come and heal
[1:12:56] those wounds and those injustices and
[1:12:59] those wicked things
[1:13:02] there's a blood that can go in where you
[1:13:04] have defiled your mind and spirit with
[1:13:07] pornography he can heal it and make you
[1:13:09] a gentleman
[1:13:11] he can go down into your fears and begin
[1:13:13] to pull your fears out by his stripes I
[1:13:17] am healed
[1:13:19] brother Branham said he went to the
[1:13:21] whipping post and as the Roman soldier
[1:13:23] took the cat of nine tails
[1:13:25] he said it just ripped the hide right
[1:13:28] off his back and they laughed earn
[1:13:31] chunks of meat is being pulled off he
[1:13:33] was those stripes that healed you
[1:13:38] Struck it and it was for you it was for
[1:13:41] me it was not advanced
[1:13:45] in vain and so powerful is the healing
[1:13:47] of God
[1:13:48] it'll go down into your spirit
[1:13:52] begin to take a confused mind and turn
[1:13:55] it and make a man out of it
[1:13:58] goes down into the sinful Soul the
[1:14:01] corrupted crooked soul and he
[1:14:03] straightens it back up again
[1:14:08] he makes the Crooked pass straight again
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:12] by his stripes
[1:14:16] who has believed his report
[1:14:19] he could take a heart make a man out of
[1:14:23] him
[1:14:24] make a lady out of it
[1:14:26] he goes down into the physical Realms
[1:14:28] the spiritual Realms and even into the
[1:14:30] very heart
[1:14:33] and there is healing for every row here
[1:14:36] tonight
[1:14:37] for those out on the stream there is
[1:14:40] healing
[1:14:42] those that were rejected those that can
[1:14:44] overcome the complex those that were
[1:14:47] hurt
[1:14:49] those that were done wrongfully
[1:14:53] but you know Jesus was done wrong
[1:14:56] he came out of Nazareth
[1:14:58] nothing good comes out of Nazareth
[1:15:01] he was given a black name and he's born
[1:15:04] with peasants he never had a real chance
[1:15:07] in life
[1:15:09] but you know he never used it as an
[1:15:11] excuse
[1:15:12] because our light shines brightest in
[1:15:15] the Darkness
[1:15:17] and your faith is like the light of God
[1:15:19] that runs the devil away
[1:15:22] and he did not complain he shined his
[1:15:26] light
[1:15:27] that God's Great Paradox that he out of
[1:15:30] Nazareth would come forth the Redeemer
[1:15:34] what about Toledo
[1:15:36] what about Lima
[1:15:38] what about your corner of the Earth
[1:15:41] that God would reach down to a person
[1:15:43] never had an opportunity God's given you
[1:15:46] one
[1:15:47] have you believed his report
[1:15:50] God's given you an opportunity
[1:15:56] he's given us an opportunity
[1:16:00] every one of us have dealt with hurts
[1:16:04] rejections deep unspeakable pain
[1:16:12] but I am the Lord
[1:16:18] I believe there's enough faith in here
[1:16:20] to start a Revival that won't quit to
[1:16:22] the coming of the Lord
[1:16:26] are you a Believer here
[1:16:28] you've got a claim you've got to step up
[1:16:30] and say I am a believer I'm a shamgar
[1:16:34] I don't have much in Ox Gall goat is all
[1:16:36] I need it's enough to whip the devil
[1:16:39] your little bit of faith is enough to
[1:16:41] whip the devil
[1:16:42] to claim your healing to claim your joy
[1:16:45] to get out of that situation that you're
[1:16:48] in for God to send an answer here this
[1:16:50] weekend and turn the whole course of
[1:16:52] your life
[1:16:54] to make you useful in the Kingdom
[1:16:57] not to give you a nice career so you go
[1:16:59] backslide but to do something for the
[1:17:01] kingdom of God
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:06] let the weak say I'm strong
[1:17:12] let the poor say that I'm rich
[1:17:15] how many believers do we have here
[1:17:19] we must understand what God wants done
[1:17:22] with his word
[1:17:25] and what he wants you to do is quit
[1:17:27] sitting there with passive hope
[1:17:30] he wants you to take him at his word
[1:17:34] draw your sword
[1:17:36] pick up your Ox goat
[1:17:38] grab your jaw and go to swinging at the
[1:17:41] Devil for your job in this life is to
[1:17:45] destroy the works of the devil
[1:17:49] the work of this church
[1:17:52] is one thing to destroy the works of the
[1:17:56] devil
[1:17:57] To Shine the Light to preach his word to
[1:18:01] sing the songs of Zion to raise the
[1:18:04] banner to lift the cross to shout to him
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:11] God wants an army
[1:18:15] say I need more than what I got he has
[1:18:18] more for us
[1:18:21] brother Branham said a real Revival is
[1:18:23] and we love to shout he said that's not
[1:18:25] a real Revival he said a real Revival is
[1:18:28] when you tear down the sheds and go to
[1:18:30] praying and getting right with God
[1:18:34] brother Branham said there's too much
[1:18:36] lack of sincerity
[1:18:40] and he tied sincerity with repentance
[1:18:42] the old-fashioned repentant meetings
[1:18:46] you say Lord I failed you I've made
[1:18:48] excuses I've been a coward
[1:18:52] I'm just going to call it what it is
[1:18:54] Lord
[1:18:56] I've been a coward
[1:18:58] I'm not gonna hide behind a fig leaf
[1:19:02] I'm going to step out and say Lord I'm
[1:19:04] sorry
[1:19:06] I want something different
[1:19:09] brother Branham was going to run off
[1:19:10] into the Wilderness and the Lord rebuked
[1:19:13] him and said you keep going on with your
[1:19:14] plans
[1:19:16] and you'll end up a bum he said Lord I
[1:19:18] don't want that I want something
[1:19:21] different
[1:19:23] and the Lord said I have you've got more
[1:19:25] gifts than that of Moses
[1:19:32] every one of us
[1:19:35] we need to have a conference with God
[1:19:39] and I believe if we will be pure in our
[1:19:41] hearts
[1:19:43] and really lay our hearts out before the
[1:19:45] Lord
[1:19:45] and say Lord I want what your will is
[1:19:49] I want your word
[1:19:51] and I'm not going to be afraid but I'm
[1:19:53] going to yield myself and let you use me
[1:19:56] the way you see fit
[1:19:58] I'm not going to be scared to step out
[1:20:00] I'm going to quit listening to all of
[1:20:02] the the Mind battles and I'm gonna step
[1:20:05] out
[1:20:06] and I'm gonna do something for you Lord
[1:20:09] I'm going to yield myself I am not going
[1:20:11] to be bound by this anymore
[1:20:14] how many say Lord that's my prayer
[1:20:17] I want to see the Holy Spirit come into
[1:20:19] my home and and Lord bring a Revival in
[1:20:22] my home
[1:20:25] I don't want to just appear like I'm
[1:20:27] religious I really want the Life of
[1:20:31] Christ in my children and my wife and in
[1:20:34] my husband

[1:20:50] and I just want you to search your
[1:20:51] hearts
[1:20:54] this is we're just preaching on faith
[1:20:56] tonight
[1:20:57] and in these meetings
[1:20:59] there's nothing pre-planned we just
[1:21:02] opening our hearts to the Holy Spirit
