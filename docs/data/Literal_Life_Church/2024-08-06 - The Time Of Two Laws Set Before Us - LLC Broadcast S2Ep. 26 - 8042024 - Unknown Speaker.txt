encourage you today I am weak but Thou Art strong [Music] WR Jesus keep me from all wrong I be [Applause] satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to thee [Music] just a closer walk [Music] with great Jesus is [Music] my walking close to the let it be dear Lord let it be through this world of toils and snares if I falter Lord who cares and who with be my burdens bear oh none but the dear Lord none but the sing it with us a to walk with me [Music] [Applause] Jesus is [Music] my D me walking close to thee let it be dear Lord let it be [Music] just the closer walk just the closer walk just the closer walk just [Music] Clos day walking close to me let it be dear Lord let it be let it be dear Lord let it be let it be Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 15 and 16 see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it you probably read these in Sunday school and you've read them maybe many times but I would like you to look at the the order that God is calling for towards the end of Israel's journey and Moses is getting ready to go off the scene this is the end of Deuteronomy and uh this he he's saying when we come to the end here before going in the promised land there's there's two things set before you two things set before you there's two laws there's two choices that you would have to make and that's between life and death and so then but I want you to notice the already says I command these day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways that's first before he says keep his Commandments notice the order it doesn't say keep his Commandments and then you will love me it says to love me first notice the order love me because that's priority because if if you don't when one is without the other you have a message of God that is not complete and will not lead to its fullness when you have keeping the Commandments without a passion and life and love for the one who gave us the Commandments then we begin to when we have one without the other the Commandments without the love and the W and walking in his ways and when we have the love and some Churches try to ditch the Commandments and ditch the principles of God and say it's only about love no we want both but I can tell you when one is without the other when you have Commandments without this life without this love without knowing him who gave us the Commandments then our message of God is not complete and it will not not lead us to the fullness of what he gave us I'd also add in verse 19 and 20 where it says that again I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live may live that thou mayest love the Lord thy God that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swear to thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give them when we come to Moses saying I've set these two things before you if that time back then is like our time then I really believe that we're living in a time that two laws is set before the people and uh you know let me just say something about laws um laws are laws are a good thing um if laws are abused then we find that we uh those that understand laws in our land that's the simplest way to explain to our children we're thankful for some of the laws that we have um there are uh government officials that I believe that are abusing uh making new laws that don't fit certain things in common sense and just common decency and common uh just what a man is and what a woman and different things but I think that's abuse of it and that's what always happens is there's an abuse use of the laws but some of our laws were given for a good motive they're good given for our protection and laws themselves can be a a motivator or the the thing that we live by a law is something that we live by and some laws you're living by this you say I don't live by any laws well yeah you do you're hopefully going to stop at a stop sign and hopefully you're going to obey the laws of the land so you you live by some of them all people say I don't live by any law it's really only what they're talking about is Bible law that's what they don't live by but you have to live by other laws and there are laws of nature there's a laws of gravity and you're under that law this morning or you would be flying and floating around the room laws are there and there are powers that are there and uh we we are under those some of those laws and some of them uh there's a a motive law is a motivator that we live by it's a power that pushes us uh but we must know the purpose of the one who is behind it I just give a little example one time when my children were little and they must must have got a little afraid sometimes when Daddy would get pulled over sometimes you know you got little kids and they're scared to death and they're wondering why the police is coming up to the door one time we were coming across the border and we were trying to bring another vehicle that I'd purchased from a sister there in Windsor and uh so I I knew I had to go through and check everything and I had the paperwork but oh man when they seen me there those police got around me pulled me to side there's police all over the car I had all my children in the car I think I scared them because one time I was going down through Sylvania here I said to the kids kids hey you know why do we wear seat belts because so the police don't catch us and I realized then I was a failure as a parent I have failed I realized that quite a bit even off later lately is I realized I was a failure because I did not teach them the reason why we wear the seat belts they should have been saying if I would have been the right parent and taught them right they would have said it's for my protection it's because that we might have an accident and I could get killed you see but they said because the police might catch us what a terrible Dad no it's it's there are things that are the people who pass the law this is the way you can look at it and I'm just going to speak from my heart this morning I I pray that it'll be a blessing to you and so when you go back to a law there there's people who pass the laws even for a seat Bel in many of the laws and the people who pass that law you can look at it this way they must have cared for me they must have cared for life they must have cared for my life to make that law there are other laws that are not that that way they're just to make things more inconvenient for us I'm convinced of that as well but there are some laws with the right motive behind it can you say am man there are some laws with the right motive there's some things that are said that have the right author behind it and the right person and they love and they care for my life and that's why they're writing the law now friends I don't believe putting God in a place of his laws about man God is not man and I can tell you safely that anything God sends from his throne for his people is for their good when you trust God that way you know he had to send it for some reason even if I don't understand it God had to send these things for my good because he loved me but when we look at it as an inconvenience or we don't trust the one who sinned it and we say they just sent this seat Bel law to make my life more inconvenient when you look at it that way that's the way you're going to look at it but if you can go back to the author and see somebody cared for Life somebody cared for my life so I will do it and because there's a reason behind it the love behind it not that I might get caught so how many of how much of the message do we follow and live because we might get caught you know fear is a motivator but it's not the best motivator so so you see now I want you to look at some things today and some things you will know maybe some things you won't know but this is what the Lord has given me and I feel to bring it this morning and and see I'm not more perfect because I wear my seat belt every time there are some people people who think that they're more perfect because they wear their seat Bel every time I'm not more perfect because of that but I'm more safe because I made a personal decision to put that seat belt on it's in relation to who I carec that I care so so we know that the person who wrote the law cares for my life and now we come back in response in relation to I do this because I care now the person who wrote it cares but now I care because someone else cared for me I care to do it because someone else cared for me I care to observe this I care to do this and this goes back to what the prophet said he says we don't do these things out of Duty we do it out as our love back to him we love him can you say Amen we do it out of respect and appreciation for the grace that he has given us we do things in reflection and and response in love I care because someone cared for me can you say Amen so now I'm still feeling led to stay in this time frame of Israel after 40 years and God said you remember at the first of Deuteronomy he said something there that we had been preaching on it's time that you get off of this mountain you've circled this mountain long enough you circuit it for 40 years and it's time to turn northward that's what he said it's time to turn northward because this and because this type is perfectly speaking of our time right now I am pulling some uh more nuggets out of it and going back into this area to feed on this because we realize there's so much importance to this call that God said to Israel you have come out of Egypt but now you've been wandering for 40 years in this message and it's time for you to stop that and it's time for you to move northward which northward met as the map I showed you northward met it's time to move into the full promise it's time to move in to to the full promise how many would raise your hand and say I believe it's time in my life to move to the full promise not a portion of it but to the full promise that's my desire so if that's the call then what is it that they were to come out of in order to go in they came out of Egypt but now what do they have to come out of now they moved out of the World when they moved out of Egypt Egypt is a type of the world and God comes and you I've got many sitting here that was living in all kinds of sin and different things and they didn't have that uh New Birth they didn't have they didn't know there was life available to them and so something happened to them and they were called by the message of the Lord Christ saying come out of that bondage come out of the world come out of all those things and so we see that happened individually in every life and it has to happen in every life but you see now there's something about when we go along with the Lord many years that he he calls to go to the higher calling even though I can look back and say well 20 years ago he called me to this but things in the middle you see things in the midst of time Satan can still work to try to bind you and try to get you stuck somewhere I like to say to people what's your hurdles why' you quit what what's going on can I help you over your hurdles can we talk about it we can talk about anything but can I help you as a minister to get over your hurdles because it's not them it's not other people it's the enemy that causes you to get discouraged if you don't get anything else this morning know this one thing that's one thing they had to come out of is that the 40 after 40 years the message had become a lot of discouragement things that are discouraging if you don't get nothing else God's calling us out of all the discouragement no wonder no wonder Joshua the first chapter in Joshua he says Be Strong be courageous it's time to stand up and have courage why is he saying that because they had lived with so much discouragement around the group of the message after 40 years there were other things restricting their worship you remember they come out of bondage and boy Pharaoh was controlling them and uh they come out of pharaoh and not only did God deliver him from pharaoh and that kind of bondage he washed the whole Army in the Red Sea and no wonder they danced and shouted when you feel free from your pharaohs you don't have to have a seminar on worship you're going to come and worship God you feel free in your spirit can I get an amen you feel free in your spirit because God has taken care of your enemy God has drowned your pharoh in the Red Sea can you say Amen why don't you lift your hand and say I need God to drown my Pharaoh in the Red Sea he can do it again can you say amen and when you do you feel free in your spirit you feel like something is lifted from you I'm no longer under the thumb of pharaoh to make me do what I don't want to do I feel free to serve the Lord I feel free to Worship the Lord I feel free to shout I feel free to dance can you say amen I feel free in the Holy Spirit nothing is quenching the spirit in my life anymore I can free I Can Be Me In Christ that's where I want to be but guess what guess what Satan knows that freedom and after 40 years some of the people had come under bondage again so if you're in bondage again you need another setting free can I get an amen you need another setting free because the the at the end of the day is are you free are you free to worship are you free in your spirit are you free by the Holy Spirit and are you living the Commandments by love and by the Holy Spirit there is no other way to live his Commandments oh what a miserable journey to live as Commandments without the Holy Spirit life in you what a miserable life glory be to God so they were free to worship and then after 40 years there was other things restricting their worship something developed that would put them in bondage again they received the law but if they made are you listening they received the law on Mount on the mount God brought the law the 10 commandments they receive the law but if they made that law more important than love grace mercy and the one the leading of the Holy Spirit and the one that gave the law if may they made that law more important than love than Grace than Mercy than the leading of the spirit and the one who was leading them if they made that law more important it was going to be death for them the same law that was meant to bring life would bring death now I'm writing the scripture cuz Paul picks it up in the New Testament we'll read the scripture in a minute Paul picks it up he's calling the law it's death without the spirit of Life to Live it it's death the law is death it has to have life in you God sends something as he's done in many uh slots throughout the ages if you read your Bible you can you can tell and even history shows when everything got bad God sends something to his people God sends a messenger God sends a message and God sends something and human nature is to make it something different than what God sent it for now we might as well just be real honest here this morning the people can turn it into something that God never in intended for it to it to be God send something and we make it something else then we say thank you God you know thank you for sending your message I'll take it from here that's what they did for 40 years you gave us the law you gave us but now all of us this fussing over the law now all this I'm better than you and you're better and I'm living it closer to you and and uh but quote battles and but Moses said this over here but here's a quote from Moses over here and all of this carnality and all this stuff just comes out of this and it's like they're saying thank you God for sending this we got it from here failing to really be led by the Holy Spirit who sent the law I'm here to say that Grace and His Holy Spirit and love is to continue to lead us for the finish of this journey not just the start amen so praise the Lord that we have something praise the Lord that God sends something and then you know once people they start say God thank you for sending this I'll take it from here I'll break it down from here I'll tell everybody from here then it's got truth in it and so then because we got truth we got truth let's see who can memorize it the best let's see who can know the best quotes from Moses let's show how everyone else is wrong and we're right with the message that we have let's show others how more knowledgeable we are or how better dressed we are we've got the best dress code and we start showing off with the truth that he gave us we start developing a pride with the truth that he gave us can you say am man there are people in the world today who uh were the the they were the most extreme legalistic versions of the truth that we have and I had them in my church they're not even they're not even around today they they have no some of them are atheists but when they were here with me they were some of the most rigid legalistic had their kids on the front row and if their kid dozed off they slapped them in the head and so they would wake up oh that was so funny they said they had it down and their kids were perfect and they were dressed perfect and they look perfect and I'm serious if they dozed off the mom just go ahead sister Jane you probably slapped them in the head wake up and nobody who could dressed as perfect as them and no they were the perfect example supposedly of what this message is and that's because over time in the message you have two laws right you have two laws and you have a choose a choice you choose life of this message or you choose just the law which is death and today they're spiritually dead there's no life oh they have they're living but I mean spiritual life it's gone it's gone because when every person will make the choice to choose the life of this or to choose death we think okay these scripture we read in Sunday school choose life or choose death choose a blessing choose a cursing and we think that was out when people in the world come and choose the life no this is people that he's saying to this after watching the prophet for 40 years they've got a choice now what are you going to choose are you going to choose the life within you or you're going to choose just the law is this okay don't answer that this is the truth we've got it let's see who can memorize it the best let's show how everyone is wrong and we're right let's show others more knowledge we're more knowledge we're better dressed and and so then then we have Exodus 19 going back now at the beginning of the journey Exodus 19 where the Prophet said that Israel made their fatal mistake what was that fatal mistake they chose law over Grace now the law you can't dump out the law Jesus said I come not to destroy the law there's many churches today that are just destroying the law we only need Grace but no you don't understand no God sent the things but he never sent it to be lived out without the Holy Ghost without life and so now we don't dump out the law but he said in Exodus 19 can you get your Bible and open it let's go back and look what he said it uh excuse me yeah Exodus 19 this is what it all began and he said in these scriptures not Genesis Exodus 19 I want you to read this with me this when they began the journey and verse three and Moses went up to God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying Thou shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto my South notice what he says where was he bringing them where did God set why did I destroy Pharaoh where am I bringing you I'm bringing you to myself this is about a relationship now therefore if you obey my voice indeed keep my commandment then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou speak unto the children of Israel and Moses came and called for the Elders of the people and laid before the faces all these words which the Lord commanded and all the people answered together and said all that the Lord hath spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord they're making a promise they can't keep there is no hint in their confession to do this that Lord I still need you to lead me I need your grace and I want to follow you the author that wrote this there's no words in this it's just okay you gave it to me I'm going to go do it tell me what I need to do and I promise you I do it that's a promise they couldn't keep not without life what they should have been saying I love you Lord and I need you I can't do this without you and your leadership and the Holy Spirit leading my life and if I can just stay close to you then I know by your grace I'll be able to follow these boundaries and follow these strings by your grace I'll do it unmar and favor there's no humility to say I just want to love you I just want to follow you I just want to be near you and this wonderful word that you've given me to live will be lived by you when I love you is anybody getting it this morning they should have said I love you Lord with all my heart soul mind and strength I see your ways I see the way that you are I'm impressed with the way that you are matter of fact some of God's more character was coming out in these Commandments of how a person can live with God inside Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not uh steal Thou shalt not think and it it it wasn't necessarily it should have been shouldn't have been worded Thou shalt not it should have been worded that this is how a Believer will live when they got God living in their heart they won't do these things because life is motivating them most of Christianity has Twisted even the Ten Commandments to make it if you live by that by the law you'll make it and that's not true you live by it because of love you live by it because the author who sent it he cared for you and now you care about him but it's all that mode of how many of the Ten Commandments did I Live this week and I was up to about eight and a half last week doing pretty good Lord give me credit for eight and a half who taught us that way let me tell you something in your human weakness you could fail all 10 of them then where you at with God does his love stop does his Mercy stop does his grace stop no it can't it's when you as he said he said love him and cling to him it's when you're clinging to him and saying I can't do this on my own thank
