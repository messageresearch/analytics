destroying the works of the devil I pray Lord God will be a believing people tonight Lord Quicken your word Quicken our hearts to it and have your way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the mighty name of the Lord It's good to see each and everyone we love you with the love of the Lord let's go straight into the word of God tonight as Psalms chapter 107 appreciate everyone pushing out and just feeling Liberty and the Lord Psalms 107 I see many friends I can't start calling names I see many and I just appreciate you all Psalms 107 and let's start with verse 8 tonight and just say Amen when you find your places oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men for he satisfieth the longing soul and he filleth the hungry soul with goodness such has sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in Affliction in an iron because they rebelled against the words of God condemned the kinds counsel of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labor and they fell and there was none to help then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses he brought them out of darkness in the shadow of death and he break their bands asunder all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men for he hath broken the gates of brass and he has cut the bars of iron and sunder fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abhorth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death and then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses hear this he sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from all their destructions praise the Lord I want to preach tonight on he sent his word and healed them God bless you you can have your seats this evening I want to continue my thought on faith tonight and brother Branham said the biggest curse there is among the Full Gospel people he said is that people are afraid he said God has made the provision but you are afraid to take God's word for it he said if we were not afraid tonight then you would take your healing by faith and know that God has promised it and the thing would go Plum away from you he said that's the reason I'm a Believer in healing I know that if you can get away from the scare and Love Takes its place something is going to happen he said there's only two faculties that govern the human one of them is Faith and Faith brings results he said and the other is fear and there is no value to it at all he said faith is of god fear is of the devil fear makes you weary and makes you wonder he said but it does you no good to weary and no good to wonder he said if you knew you were going to die tomorrow morning he said fear would do you no good he said but Faith you say what good would Faith do he said Faith would write your pardon he said to be weary don't be scared he said have faith and believe when we fear fear will hinder us being scared will hinder us it will hinder us from our blessings and God cannot work with us when we're afraid to take him out his word but when we believe God the spirit of God can move Among Us and and faith can begin to move and God will work with you then the Pharisees read the same scriptures Jesus read the Pharisees had the same Bible that Jesus had but brother Branham said the Pharisees could not make the word work because they did not practice what they read well he said now he said I want to see somebody that's got faith and will take God in his word we need somebody that will practice what they believe because faith without works is dead brother Branham said and I one time I went into a cave and and there was these little bats everywhere and and they said these bats have lost their eyesight because they had dwelt in darkness so long that they did not neither eyes anymore so it started birthing little bats and generations to come without eyesight altogether and brother Branham said if we were to take somebody's arm and strap it up behind them you just let 25 years go by pretty soon that arm will become dormant because you are not using it or if you yourself was locked in darkness your eyes would eventually become dormant because you are not using the god-given senses that God gave you and so brother Branham said that's the same with faith if the church is not operating and exercising faith in the word of God he said that faith will go dormant and the church will go powerless Hallelujah see it's the our very faith that contacts God it is your faith that brings the blessing of God to you tonight and we need to know how to use our faith we need to exercise our faith can you say Amen because he said faith without works is dead let's turn in our Bibles real quick to James chapter 2. James chapter 2 and we'll start with verse 14. everybody love the Lord praise the Lord James chapter 2 verse 14. what does it profit my brethren though a man say he has faith and has not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked or destitute of daily food and one of one of you say to them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things that are needful for the body what does it profit so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah man say thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works thou believest there are one God he said thou do us well for Devils believe and tremble he said but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead I like that he said oh vain man that means a man that is void of understanding it means he's empty opposed to full it means that his hands are empty and he's fruitless in what he's saying and he's false he cannot produce what he's talking about because he cannot produce the faith that he speaks so he says that faith without works is dead it's like a man with no spirit wow praise the Lord brother Brigham said people right now anyone can be free of their disease they can be free of their afflictions he said but we're scared to make a start we're scared that that and he said what happens is we're this is and I'm reading the quote he said we're waiting for God to come down and pull you out he says but God does not deal with us like that he said you're the one that's got to make a step you're the one that's got to step out in faith can you say Amen brother Brandon was given a gift not to heal the people but to stimulate Faith to believe God that's the only access that we have and if we can believe God it can change our situation it can take a sick man and make him well it could take a depressed man and make him free in Christ faith without works is dead the Bible said by faith Noah moved with fear because if you've got faith it'll move you if you believe you'll act upon that faith and so Noah believed it was going to rain Noah believed the judgments of God was coming so Noah moved with fear and the Bible said that he's he started preparing an ark to the saving of his household he was looking to the Unseen because faith comes by hearing God told him I'll destroy this world and Noah feared God the Bible said he was moved but fear brother Branham said you can't fear God unless you believe God are we Believers tonight so Noah by faith moved with fear and began preparing he grabbed a hammer and he started working on an ark praise the Lord and and there's you know Noah could not be a secret believer this isn't going to happen I mean he he's faith God wants him to display to the all unbelieving world don't you be afraid to stand for God don't you be afraid to say God has sent a message in this hour don't be afraid to believe in angels and visitation of angels and and the same Promises of God are all ye and amen Hallelujah and so Noah he said I believe it and he went out he didn't wait for the approval of the Bishops or of his own family but Noah's faith faith has an effect upon others and you better start believing right now it'll have a fact upon your neighbor Noah started working Papa what you doing God is going to send a deluge and his faith was contagious and the more that Noah believed it began to affect his children and the children began to believe I don't think we ought to indoctrinate our children I think we ought to believe God and they will see our faith and the fruits of our faith so Noah couldn't hide his faith you know did you know brother Branham said he sold his farm he was a very prosperous farmer and he said he sold his farm to get the money to build this Ark so now Noah looks ludicrous he's given up everything that he's worked for in life looks like an absolute fool turned in his investment sold this house got him a tiny little apartment and he invest in all this wood and he's he's got to do every bit of it himself and he goes out he's chopping Timbers and his sons come under the influence of Daddy's faith and they start helping him pack the Timbers and and little by little he's building this structure and then I was talking to Wesley just yesterday he was telling me how they had to beat the pitch out of another tree how many ever heard brother random say that they would cut another tree down and they would beat that tree till the pitch came out of it because the Lord said pictured inside and out and so you know how much pitch that they had to beat out of trees to cover that Ark and so God said it's going to rain in 15 years of beating trees you would think I'm going to give up but Noah's Faith held but not just Noah's Faith held his faith was a testimony to every unbeliever in that area beating trees and beating the pulp out of them and that's why Christ they beat the pulp out of Christ in order to seal us with the Holy Spirit [Applause] Christ is our Ark but see Noah had works to go with his faith Noah believed it how many believe it as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be and so what a testimony now brother Branham said God has a principle and I want everyone to listen he said in order to see a miracle how many believe in miracles he said in order to see a miracle though you must obey the word first you must act upon the word first and then the miracle will follow everybody with me now notice Moses was the same way God told him I'm going to deliver the people Moses had to act upon the word before the Miracles would take place see it's obedience God wants obedience to the word of the Lord and you got to be willing you got to be willing to make a step you got to be willing to step out and claim it and act upon what you claim Moses made a step you see like how he threw down the serpent and it turned into a serpent and so it turned through I'm sorry threw down the staff and it turned into a serpent and then brother Branham said then the miracle followed when he came to the Red Sea he said Lord what do I do he said speak and go forward so notice he had to make a step and then the Red Sea moved back if you believe God God will make a way for you you've got to take a step you've got to reach out by faith and watch the Devils move back watch sickness move back watch the enemy move back God Will Make A Way but you've got to take a step of faith this is God's order this is God's way he'll make a way for you he'll make a way when you're hungry he'll make a way in Temptation he'll make a way when everyone turns her back he'll make a weigh-in trial Hallelujah Moses makes a step the sea goes back he gets on the other side and that's when his problems start he had less problems with Pharaoh than he did with his own church that came from heaven he had more of a fight with his own church than he did Pharaoh's Army and that's the way the devil does it's to destroy your faith he brings trouble in the church he brings trouble among the youth he he criticizes the pastor criticizes the music criticizes everyone it's the devil that's doing it [Applause] Moses first fight was the easiest because God just swallowed him then 40 Years of dragging a complaining Church this is where our faith needs to come forth and manifest when things aren't going right when things are sideways when everything is negative [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] when it's rainy every day complaining every day this is when we need faith [Applause] yourself you see we got to make a step brother Branham said when they stepped out how many babies would be born to two million people in one night [Music] coming and knocking on his door and you pray for me pastor how's he going to clothe there's no Walmarts in that desert how is he going to clothe 2 million people can you imagine the diapers he's got to feed him now this is an act faith Hallelujah but a journey of a Thousand Miles begins with one step lord it's better that I die than dwell with this people they were hungry so God sent them Quail right out of the ocean can you imagine the millions of quail to feed two million people and they and they didn't have arrows and machine guns they would just reach out and catch them out of the air how many believe in the miracles of god I believe if you're longing for an answer that the Lord will send it right through this building and all you got to do is reach out and get a hold of it or we'll believe in people they get hungry and God would drain the bread out of heaven and but they would come out and smell like Panera Bread have their coffee with God's angels food that was sent down from heaven amen no you say Lord how are you going to do it he does it in his own way but Moses job was to believe God we're going to the promised land God don't want us to know how he's going to do it he just wants us to believe that he will do it and he wants us to take a step of faith because God will honor his word get that word on the inside of you and God will obligate himself to that word our job is to believe it with all of our hearts you know Elijah at the brook of cedarth you know he had a mighty Showdown and the Lord said get to the brook of cedarth and he said well I have a place prepared and brother Branham said that God was faithful to his servant because he stood with the word of the Lord and God just rained down bread from heaven and God would just let him drink from the river what a beautiful place of quiet separation unto God and I imagine that was probably some of Elijah's best days up there in the presence of the Lord with no battles how many would love to have that no bad you know what no battles equals no people I know everyone else is the problem and we're waiting for them to get perfected come on folks but God wasn't going to leave it that way Lord he was just strengthening him for another battle pretty soon it dried up because everything in this world is temporary everything in this world is temporary you say I'm having a Revival they'll be coming ups and downs and negatives and positives there'll be trials but faith will take you to every one of them pretty soon it dries up Lord are you moving me sometimes your trials is not God's punishment but he's moving you to the next post but you've got to take a step instead of trying to hold on to yesterday's Revival you've got to say Lord bring me another one God says I have Revival for you but it's right through the Red Sea it's right through the trials Hallelujah and he said Lord my Revival's dried up and God said I've got a preparation made for you he said what is it Lord he said I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee praise the Lord I've been living out on this ground for months on end I am looking for a rich with a woman with fellow feather tip feather pillows and Victorian decoration a little old lady that gives me a room and oh praise the Lord I imagine he hot footed it right down the mountain and what a disappointment when he gets to her gate and there is one meal between her and death God's timing is perfect because when we obey a miracle is going to happen no I I'm sorry Elijah knew God enough to know when you get into situations like that something wonderful he said well the harder it gets is the more we ought to believe the darker it gets the more faith we ought to apply because that's when the miracle takes place here's a little woman just barely enough strength and he said that's the one that you're is going to feed you and sustain you and the spirit of God comes upon him because he obeyed God's word he said woman bring me a drink and she went to move and he said and a little cake for I'm hungry and she looked and she said sir I'm a given heart I would give you all that I have got one meal between me and death and me and my son are gonna die he said but bring me one first for thus saith the Lord for thus saith the Lord you will be sustained until the trials are over Faith Comes by hearing the word of the Lord she knew this was the man that called for a three and a half year drought she knew his words had weight behind them so she went in by this is an incredible Act of Faith now God put her in a place where he gave her thus sight the Lord now she must act God brings the saith the Lord and places it upon us and then we must act we must act [Music] God puts us in our dilemma and something struck her heart I believe is the spirit of God and she went in and she took her last meal and her last oil and she dumped it out and began to make a cake and she brought it to the man of God you want to talk about faith and works together she brought the very thing that would sustain her son she gave like Abraham gave he said go back in and make you one she said I used it all obey the word of the Lord she went back in and she poured and when you pour out God is filling you back up every time you empty out God will come back and fill you up again take a step of faith empty out tonight I'm tired of my unbelief I'm emptying my attitudes let God come and fill you up again how many need a Revival in their lives how many need to feel a God God is here to give it to you but you must act upon your faith Hallelujah Hallelujah she was sustained by thus saith the Lord how beautiful God is searching for someone to act upon his word all of us can claim to be Believers but what good is our faith if it doesn't have works if I am sick I am commanded to act upon God's word is that the word of God now notice God loves to see our reaction the reason he did that was to test her faith so God put a stumbling block in the way I knew there was nothing to it and so it was just an intellectual conception the whole time but brother Branham said God cannot use a coward he said if the first trial comes and we run God cannot use you wow remember Martha you know brother Branham spoke of Martha how she called for the Lord and and he just ignored her he did it on purpose he was going to test her faith four days late and he comes walking in and here he comes and she looks up and sees him coming and there's no doubt the devil came and said you made him a robe you made him meal after meal you got kicked out of your church for that man and you believed he was a real preacher and now here he comes four days late it's like he didn't even care he knew about it but brother Branham said this was not her attitude she ran up and she said Lord if you had been here my brother would had not died and the spirit of God began to move and he said I am the resurrection in the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth now this she said I know that you are the Son of God brother Branham said something happened by those words because God test our action and reaction when she said I believe that you are the Son of God he said the great cogs of God begin to turn he said her faith was the little Cog on Earth God's faith and power locked in with her cogs and it's began to generate the power of the Resurrection if our faith will lock in with God tonight it'll produce healing it'll produce Joy it'll deliver the captive and it was her attitude that begin to move the power of God and as soon as she said it he said where have you laid him I bet and they brought him to the place and the most incredible thing happened when he gets there he looks at Mary and Martha just you know just 100 pounds 100 pound girls and said roll away the stone why did he roll away this time why brother Brandon said he could have he walks on water he turns water to wine he stops storms we're always told take away the stone in other words brother Branham said that tells us that you have got to do something God is all-powerful healing his great coffers his Heavens are full His blessings are full tonight God's glory is fall tonight but he tells her you roll away the stone because you have something to do God wants to see you act God wants you a part of his economy God wants you a part of redemption and you've got to do some rolling away if you want a Revival tonight start rolling away your unbelief start rolling away all the devil's lies you've got something to do I don't know how long it took them to move that stone and they look over in England in a hand finally they get it off and about the time they made their feeble effort the spirit of God comes he said Lazarus come forth and a man that was dead four days his Spirit gone his blood cold worms through his body his cells came back together his Spirit came back into that body he stood to his feet and obeyed God and he walked out as a witness of the resurrection and the life he's the same God tonight but he wants us to roll away the stone there are stones in our way that we have not been able to get rid of for years and you're like God get rid of this for me he said you've got to do it you're the one that's got to separate yourself from all unbelief you're the one it's got to make us step towards I'm not going to baby you I'm not you're a child of God and I want you to make a move towards me brother Branham said Jesus now watch this he said if you want a miracle you've got to roll away the stones now my opening scripture was their souls were suffering and they cried to the Lord in their trouble everybody stay with me I'm getting to where I want to go the Bible said he sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destructions how many believe there's power in the word of God but if he sent his word how did he send it we know that there's many ways that he said it in the Bible First he would always send his word by a prophet brother Branham said that every time people got in trouble God always sent the word to deliver them God always send them the word in every case he said God will send a prophet and the word comes to the prophet and he said that's what delivers the people always because he is a god of Might he is a god of healing he is a god of Miracles and he said it takes the word of God to meet the challenge how many have confidence in the word of God brother Bradham said in every age it's the same Cry of the spirit he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches if you're a Christian you must get back to what the spirit is teaching the word for this hour every Messenger to every age will preach that word every Revival will be because men got back to the word of God again he said every time a people backslid the remedy was come back to the word the word is the answer for your healing for your joy for your peace God sent his words [Music] but how shall they hear without a preacher Faith cometh by hearing the word of God the Bible said that the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God everything that God could do for us has already been done at Calvary the price has been paid at Calvary and the preacher's job is to point you to Calvary and say there is your Victory there is your healing there is your salvation I want to talk about the power of God's word because a preacher when he preaches the spirit of God begins to Get Out Among the people this is not a communistic gathering they have plenty this is not some leftist a political show this is the house of the Living God and we are talking about the Eternal Word of God that has creative power behind every promise is that right brother Branham said God's word is a gift are you hearing me you realize the words that I'm speaking are not the words of a man they're the words of God and God's word to you is a gift praise the Lord but he got that now he said that the word is a conductor and then when the word is preached the holy spirit will follow this word how many believe that he said wherever the word is preached your pastor will preach he said all of a sudden across the building will go the Holy Ghost the word is the conductor of the spirit because the word is preached and the spirit follows it wherever the spirit follows the word and the Holy Ghost confirms the word you know how you come into the house of God and you feel that lift how many feel it in these meetings you feel the presence of God lifting that is a supernatural thing and it ain't brother Craig it's God's word and I know if I will be faithful and preach the word of God the holy spirit will be all over this congregation how many believe that and brother Branham said now the reason that we preach like this if I am preaching healing and quoting scriptures and preaching it gets you in the spirit to think about healing brother Branham said I must get you thinking that way in order for the Holy Spirit to move upon you that's what he says direct quote and he said now you let the mind which is the word the mind of Christ come in you he said and when you do and begin thinking God's thoughts it brings God's blessing and his power [Applause] praise the Lord he said it'll bring new life it'll bring Resurrection it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a new person it'll bring death to life he said now why did God give us the great power of the Holy Spirit I give you power to tread upon the heads of serpents he said the reason God gave us this great power of the Holy Spirit he said is so we would operate the work of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit and the branch we know that the branch produces the fruit not the vine but the branch must receive the power of the vine and if we will yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit it will energize us to produce the fruits of God brother men have said every time in history that the Holy Spirit ever struck the church he said without fail a Revival of signs and wonders and miracles they healed the sick in every age they continued in every age when they let the Holy Spirit take control of their being he said Martin Luther prayed for a man and he was healed he said John Wesley prayed and 240 cases of sick was healed he said Dwight Moody did not even preach the principles of Divine Healing he said he didn't even teach it but when he would preach the gospel the Holy Spirit would begin to move over the audience and people would go home absolutely healed even though he did not preach it he said because the holy spirit is the Healer it was an automatic thing when the spirit of the Lord would move he said the holy spirit is the Healer and he is here to energize every heart and every life and to bring you into the promises of God how many know that it's for the front row the second row the third row all the way to the back row the holy spirit is here to energize our life and Victory to energize our faith to bring understanding of God's Eternal words how by the foolishness of preaching how shall they hear without a preacher and how can there be a preacher except God sends him Hallelujah I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to them that believe how many say Lord come by my way so when you receive the word of the Lord that is being preached from the pulpit and you take that word into your heart that makes you a conductor it makes you a direct copper line a conductor is something that transfers energy Hallelujah in a Believer is a copper wire and the the enlightening power of almighty God is looking for somebody that will believe so he can bring forth a healing or a resurrection he's looking for a copper wire he can pull all of that current down to the believer and out of that believer will come forth the glory of God that's why Jesus told Martha if you will believe you will see the glory of God we must come back to the word and believe it by faith now brother Branham said he said Mr ardenbright come out of here hear ye hymn 1957. he said Mr argenbright told me that seven has already been healed while I was preaching that is the original way that's the way of doing it preaching the word and the people getting healed by the preaching God sent his word to heal them now brother Branham said that is the first and initial way he said but then because we can be kind of thick-headed he will send gifts to try to help bolster that but God's first and original way he said is for the preaching of the word to bring it to you and you're to receive it Hallelujah do you love the Lord and brother Branham was talking about a minister uh Tommy Osborne how many remember Tommy Osborne is amazing brother Branham talked about him he said now Tommy there were many with gifts in their hands and and you know all kinds of oils and different things it was unscriptural but he said Tommy he said there is no fanaticism in Tommy whatsoever matter of fact Tommy was birthed out of other brother brenham's meetings and he come up and said brother Brandon do you think that I have a gift of healing he said you would have known it by now he said brother you don't need a gift of healing he said every preacher has the general commission to pray for the sick he said sit under that oak tree which was FF Bosworth he knew more about Divine Healing than any man in the land he said drink from him and go out and pray for the sick and he did that brother Tommy became so efficient and so gifted at preaching the word that he would not even form prayer lines now we're not against prayer lines because God heals my prayer lines he heals my anointing of oil he heals my music he heals in many ways so it's not to say God does it one way he is the Healer of all of our diseases but brother Brandon was talking about God wanting to heal by his word and he said Tommy Osborne would preach to 20 000 people and bring the word into such a place that the devil had no place to stand he said notice Jesus never used his power he used his word because the word will defeat the Devil any place any time I think this would be a good time to draw the sword on your enemy and cut the devil's head off that is tormenting you and affecting you the word of God will defeat the Devil any place any time under any circumstance it is the word that destroys our enemy it is the how many believe Jesus destroyed the works of the devil when he did it he did it by the word [Music] he sent his word and delivered the woman caught in adultery delivered the woman with a blood issue delivered the blind man delivered Legion who was out of his mind he sent his word and he healed them he said Tommy Osborne's a dear friend of mine young Christian use Mighty works all over the country not a streak of fanaticism he said he uses the scriptures and don't even have a prayer line once again don't say brother Craig don't believe in prayer lines I've done a many and I'll continue to do them till Jesus come our Prophet taught us this and he still had prayer lines but I'm trying to tell you that he sent his word it is written and God wants us to believe his word so it's not the hands of an evangelist it's not the great ministry of a popular person you're laying your hands or Christ is laying his hands on you you are looking to Calvary where God wanted you to look Hallelujah and when a man takes God at his word it destroys the do you know all Heaven is behind the word of God do you know what I'm preaching to you tonight can deliver any affliction can deliver from any problem how many believe that all power of God is behind this word brother Branham said there was a 17 year old girl that had come to the Tabernacle he said she was ate up with cancer just a 17 year old girl he said I never touched the child he said I went he said the devil wanted to cut her life short he said I never touched the child I went to the pulpit and I began to preach the word and the word healed her so instantly she rose up completely well Hallelujah he said she believed it and the word went forth and the word is God's life and the word is God's power and the word is God's promise and the word heals the sick whoo brother Branham said if we are sick we need to open up our channels to receive the word of God into our hearts he said in Durban South Africa 30 000 people he said uh delivered at one time he said I never touched one of them he said they looked and they believed remember the Roman soldier or Centurion he said I'm not worthy that you come under my home I'm not worthy that you stepped foot well that that speaks because here's a man that actually admitted to the Lord that he was not worthy but yet he had a request and many of times when we go to the Lord with a request we actually forfeit our blessing because we are not worthy but here was an unworthy man that said if I ever receive anything from God I have got to ask and the Lord says ask that your joy may be full you say I'm so defeated ask God for power to overcome I just feel so bad ask God for his grace to to rise up above your trials Lord I know that I am not worthy but I also know that you're bigger than every devil and that devil is your enemy and I know sickness must bow and I know diabetes must bow and I know uh cancer must bow all I'm asking is to hear your word because I know there is Authority behind your words would you speak to your enemy and free that child that word is being preached to you tonight it is the word of the Lord brother Branham said this was the Gentile way that we believe his word brother Branham said it is the highest form of faith the Gentile way is to believe the word of God my word shall not return void but it will accomplish that where I sent it how many believe that God sent a message on this day and the world is rejected it but somehow you have responded it's God accomplishing turning our hearts back to the faith of the fathers how many knows God's word has an effect is it affecting you has it turned your heart back has it made you long to see the real or the real Church rise again do you long to see the new heavens and the new Earth and to live like we were created to live Hallelujah all power say all power all power and authority is behind this word if you will believe and act upon it Hallelujah he sent his word and he healed them you know many times I have seen in preaching many times I've seen Justin preaching not even on Divine Healing the Holy Spirit move out just this kind of preaching in an atmosphere like this and the spirit of God move and somebody testify of their healing I don't know if he's here and I don't want to embarrass him if he's here I know brother Joe C was one just sitting under the presence of God and God went right to him and he said brother Craig I never had a bulldog Faith he said God gave it to me praise the Lord and I've seen real afflictions healed but then I see him lose it and the reason they lose it is because they're expecting God just to heal them with no effort on their half or they don't know how to keep the devil away so I have seen many receive their healing and it's it's visible and then they lose it see but God wants to heal even in an atmosphere like this he wants your faith to be in him he wants you to set your sights upon him how many believe that and so many times when we're in a meeting like this you'll feel quickening power you'll feel Faith rising up in you and it's God it's God dealing with you I had it happen myself the preaching of the word was going and and I had vertigo and God said take me at my word and the devil said don't do it you're going to make a fool of yourself and the Lord said take me at my word and I testified before the whole church God healed me in that seat and God dropped a faith and God met me there when I confessed to my healing and the Lord delivered me two years later he came back I was preaching at a church he came back and I felt the whole place start spinning and the devil goes oh I got you now I'm about ready to walk out to preach and at first I'm like oh no and then something rose up in me and said the same God that healed me keeps me healed he went away and I never dealt with it again [Applause] Elijah said thus saith the Lord it shall not rain until I call for it stomped off into the Wilderness had a three and a half year Revival with God then he comes back and he has a showdown with the unbelievers and we talked about this last night that the reason that he stopped the heavens was to bring the people to repentance and after he was done with them they were repenting and God made a promise if they would repent he would open up the heavens and pour out his blessings because God wants to bless his people and Elijah went up to the mountain and he told geeza go out there and see if God is moving he went out and he looked and there was nothing oh man nothing in this revival meeting brother Paul he goes back and said nothing he said oh no no no we ain't stopping that click go back okay went back and said no I'm certain this time there's absolutely nothing there's less than the first time I went he said go back seven times and Elijah had his head in his knees and he's praying and gehaza went and looked and he saw something coming out of the water he'd look like the a man's hand he came back and said I see something but it ain't very much just like a little hand brother Branham said that was the first sign of God beginning to move on his promise he said the very first thing that that little nudge that you'll feel while the preaching of the word is going forth it's the size of a man's hand but if you won't run away and say Lord I receive that and I want that blessing the power of God will begin to multiply and God will heal you and deliver you and pour out his deluge the very first move of God the very first inspiration of God you need to reach out and say I accept it I'm accepting my healing is God moving on you I'm accepting my Deliverance right now in this meeting I don't need a Revival some evangelist I'm taking you out your words I'm going to confess your word I'm gonna believe your word I'm going to step out on it Lord God inspires your heart you need to step out in faith how many knows that God is Among Us right now God is moving in these meetings God's challenging us God's saying accept it and I'll come Hallelujah if you need the Holy Spirit he said Lord I want the Holy Spirit when you fill the nudge step out and take it it's for you in these meetings it's for you tonight if you feel that don't let the devil back you off to I believe his word my life is going to change tonight my situation is going to change tonight I don't care how bad it is how many have needs in here if you want it just know Lord you promised to answer he's moving all Among Us and God is looking for somebody to take him at his word there's no hard cases with God your case is not a hard case God answers prayer how many believe that say Amen so what are you doing preacher I'm trying to preach faith into your heart if you're gonna if you want Divine Healing you've got to create an atmosphere of Divine Healing you want the Holy Ghost you've got to create an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost how many want the Holy Spirit to come to them then you need to create an atmosphere of Faith to say Lord let your spirit fall upon me you are a conductor take that word in your heart and let the power of God fall upon you if my neighbor don't want it I want it Lord I'm a Believer I believe in healing I believe you are the same I believe you're now in this meeting I believe you want to give it to me more than I want it Hallelujah he's still God he's still God the holy spirit is for you healing is for you Joy is for you he died that you might have it we need a daring faith that's what brother Branham called it a daring face come on Peter come on Peter Jesus comes walking in on her troubled sea I know that some of us have real trials in our lives and God will do it just to test your reaction and the disciples are out in a troubled sea a storm is blowing things are out of control the cells are ripped and they look out in the darkness and these weren't little mud puddles brother Branham said they were White Caps going up and down 20 feet high and he said when they looked out they saw Jesus and when he made a step he said the whole White Cap would go flat and there's coming they're like ah a spook a spook now if you read your Bibles there's no spooks go ahead brother Branham said they were afraid they were afraid of the only thing that could help them I would have loved to see this it's out of control where's the Lord where's the Lord he's watching you matter of fact he's coming to fetch you hello the Sails are blowing the place is shaken the devil is howling and you look out when you think you're gonna sink and you see something coming don't be afraid of it that's your deliverance he sent the word the White Caps are moving flat on every step and they said a spook a spooky said don't be afraid God speak to the hearts of the people tonight don't be afraid it is high amen they knew that voice and they all got to looking and Peter was just the kind of guy we all like because he's quick at the trigger and he does things that we would probably do and Peter looked and said he said didn't he come Lord let me come and the Lord's out there he said come Come Peter and Peter's like and he starts coming and Jesus says come come here yes I praise the Lord pray and brother Branham said that water is 20 foot but now he's walking why is he walking because the word commanded him to walk and he's walking and he took a step of faith Because he believes the word that spoke to him the same word that said come says you're healed says you're free says you're gods the same word that said Peter come says come unto me lay down your burdens lay down your complexes lay down all the unbelief he's requiring something out of Peter for Faith Peter I'm not going to pick you up and carry you around you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God aqua [Applause] come on come on praise the Lord Jesus is telling you come step out on faith step out to your healing step out for your deliverance I sent my word and as long as he believed he walked [Music] and then oh oh Lord God help me the whole scene changed as soon as he let fear come in and just before he was ready to expire a great hand reach forward took hold him up you did so good Peter I'm proud of you no why in the world did you doubt you know the word that I'm preaching to you do you know that you could walk on water that this word is just as solid if God says you can be filled with the Holy Spirit then you can be filled with the Holy Spirit if the Lord says you are healed I want you to believe I am healed come on Peter God's calling you he says come up by my word I don't need a pillar of fire I don't need a lightning flash I need God's work come you don't have to be in that trial forever you don't have to live under privilege forever God's telling you to come take a step of faith step out on God's promise have faith in God [Music] he has sent his word and he's healed them the spirit of God is moving Among Us now and if you have a need do not walk out of this building without reaching up and saying Lord I'm going to put some Works behind my faith I realize I gotta move away the stone I realize I gotta take a step before you meet me God is calling us to to not let your faith lay dormant let's use our faith let's believe the Lord how many believe that he's here how many believe he's the same yesterday today and forever how many believe he never changes I believe that the power of God can move out of this building and bring our loved ones back bring our loss back I believe he could bring the prodigal back he can fill your children with the holy spirit all things are possible we got to be a believing people I think this word we ought to believe God he can heal blinded eyes he can take cripples and make them straight again he can bind the Brokenhearted come on Peter how long does he got a call how long does he got to cry God says come step out on my word quit looking at the waves quit looking at the wind look at Christ look at his word the word says come [Music] on Peter there's a Peter in here somewhere somebody will jump out and say I'm tired of living like this my life is going to change my trial is going to change come on Peter Spirit of the Lord is calling he requires us to believe we're waiting on God and God is waiting on us he gave us his word you can step out on it I don't care how bad
