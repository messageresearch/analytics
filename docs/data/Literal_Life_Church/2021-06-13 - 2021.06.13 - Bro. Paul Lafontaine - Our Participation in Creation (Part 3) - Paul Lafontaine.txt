then this wednesday we'll have brother joel uh rama ramla which would be brother ray and sister anna's son-in-law he's from new york and or connecticut there and he'll be speaking for us he just started preaching recently so we want to have him speak for us wednesday night and that'll be here in the sanctuary not the back room it'll be here and then on the 23rd we'll cancel getting ready for the kids days that week so we'll cancel that wednesday night and then i want you to remember july 6 on a tuesday night at 7 00 p.m we'll have a celebration of life for brother gary dinman he was with us in our church many many years and his family is going to be in town that weekend and so on tuesday night they've agreed to have here in the sanctuary and they're providing the refreshments after but we come together to celebrate our brother who's had his his promotion and we want to just take a look at his life and rejoice in god for hit so if you would i'm asking the congregation i know it's a weak night but we'll cancel our wednesday night and all the normal crowd from wednesday and some of you sunday crowd if you could come and honor our brother and show the family that you care we'd certainly appreciate you come out seven o'clock july 6th that will be on a tuesday night amen and then we'll be announcing some more different brothers coming in for the month of july i want to have like a summer series of wednesday night revivals and i have some brothers lined up to come so we're looking forward to that and then in the month of july brother rap asked me to announce there's no adult sunday school classes for the month of july they'll start up the first sunday in august amen praise the lord proverbs chapter 18. and verse 19. a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city so i just asked you how many has lived that out how many knows that's true how many has offended a brother thank you a few people honest people here a brother offended is harder to be one than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth so now we're talking about where the offense usually comes from and that's what comes out of our mouth or what comes out of someone else's mouth we have offenses that come many times a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled and then we have this familiar scripture that says death and life are in the power of the tongue death you notice how powerful this is now and when we have relationships whether with god or with one another offenses may come and we we realize that that the the offenses often come from what is spoken what is said what comes from this tongue and so he he go solomon says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it they that indulge in it they that speak more shall eat the fruit thereof and the fruit thereof you eat from what you say it can be good or bad it could be good fruit it could be bad fruit so we want to continue to talk a little bit this morning about our participation in creation part three our participation and creation but we just want to be just a little bit more practical today than what we've been and speak a little bit about the tongue our participation in creation father we pray lord that this special spirit lord your presence here this morning will continue and now speak to us through your word take each of our lives lord and hide us lord in your presence in your secret place and speak to us intimately this morning and tell us those things that are are needful for our lives tell us what's next in our lives lord and we'll be obedient to follow you we just pray you'll bless every person that's under the sound of our voice streaming or hear we pray lord that you will do something special in our midst lord we appreciate that you stirring the waters here lately it's such a special move of god we pray father that we would get out of the way that you speak those things lord that are needful to the people today it doesn't matter what level a person is at lord you meet us where we're at and you draw us higher and we pray that you'll do that this morning as we commit ourselves this this next hour or so to the word of god we ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you shake so many sand as you're seated this morning and god bless you each one i want to lean us today a little bit more towards maybe a daily application of our subject that we've been on our participation in creation you know we've talked about all the things that we're blessed to know in the last days the third poll and the spoken word and the prophet showing us that it's in the thoughts of god and no people has ever known this like the bride does and that is he taught us he says god's thoughts have to be spoken and he says there's still a thought until he speaks them he says it goes from thought of god to a revelation but it doesn't stay there he says it's still a thought until you speak it so you can imagine now how god is bringing us to a level in the last days that we understand what it is god wants to do through us and it's not just god speaking his word through a prophet or through preachers or through pastors that is important and it has its place and has a great important place but lest we should back off and let all the speaking be done by someone else it's every believer that has the holy ghost has to recognize that god can use your lips to speak life in situations if you have the holy ghost you have life in you to speak life to someone else how many believe that this morning and that's one of the blessings of the revealed word for the last days that we understand these things the third poll is not some mystery to us that we understand it comes back to us understanding our position and our place and all these things and we have let me just say this before i go further we have been so blessed in the last days so blessed in the word of god we are such a blessed people to understand and to see the things that we see i say thank god for it i feel unworthy of it but god's blessed me with it praise the lord and he's blessed you with it but we tend to uh separate a lot of these themes many times from uh let me just say this we tend to separate these great themes that we hear that preach to us we tend to separate them from what is happening on a daily basis in our lives matter of fact many times we can leave a service and hear glorious things but we go right back to and we we disconnect what we're hearing that that should apply to our daily lives and incidentally what's coming out of our mouths all the time we tend to disconnect it and we feel good at church i'm a preacher i hate that i hate it in myself i hate it in people that we live in the glories of god at church but we can't seem to apply it to our everyday lives and i believe god has not given us these things just to talk about in church or just to get excited about in church god has given us what we have within us to apply in our lives every day it's the application of the token can you say man that counts and so when i when i labor in these points the last few weeks it's for us to catch something that we can apply beyond what we just enjoy here services you know and i just say this i thought of it last night services that we have are not just pep rallies to work you up and then to let you down this isn't a pep rally convention shouldn't be a pep rally to get people all emotionally excited and then they're let down or to get people emotionally excited about something and then they go back to emptiness that's not what we're gathering together for god is actually depositing things within us that we can take and believe be the believer that we need to be on an everyday basis blessed be his name and so it's not a pap rally it's not an amway convention i don't know when i was a kid i went to amway conventions or multi-level conventions with my dad and they're professionals at pumping you up with the idea that you are a millionaire and that you are a diamond direct and you're a diamond direct material some of you are laughing because you've been to those conventions where they pump you up in the pep rally and they make you feel like i'm a millionaire i'm a diamond direct and then you go back to the reality of life and you realize none of that is true at home it's still the same at home and you feel empty again but you see friends what we preach is not a pep rally this is not something to work you up what we preach is is is the things of substance that god gave you as promises and i'll just tell you i'm not here to tell you you're going to be a millionaire spiritually speaking you already are millionaires can you say man if you've got the holy ghost you're already spiritually rich can you say amen and the father has already signed the check but he's given you the checkbook to write it out for what you need praise the lord and so you won't feel empty again if you take it as your own that god has made you a spiritual millionaire but you see many times we don't apply it at home and the truth in our text and through the bible throughout in in proverbs chapter 18 we realized what happens in our life what happens in life whether death or life or whatever happens what happens alive will come mostly from what we say from our tongue i know this is going to be very practical this morning and i won't get to all of it but i want to get to some of it i want to apologize ahead of time i have my my uncle jim's uh funeral or memorial today up in chelsea michigan so i apologize ahead that we have to we may have to keep this a bit short and there's plenty of preachers here so if i have to go i'll just bring one of you up brother raymond or one of these brothers and you can just take over because i don't want to squelch the spirit but i do apologize ahead that i'll have to get going and so it may be short here this morning but you know what we what happens in life according to proverbs 18 here what happens in life most of it all comes whether bad or good because of the tongue because of what's been said can we agree and uh and so you know the the tongue and and where we speak the central place of whether there's life or death is the tongue it's not really the soul the soul you have to have life in the soul if we're talking spiritually you have to have life in the soul i know god changes the soul but you see the way the prophet taught us is that it's not just that it stays in the soul but that what comes upon your lips in confession whether the positive or negative begins to create in other words creative word happens when it is spoken and the prophet didn't just apply that to the logos in the beginning he didn't just apply it to a prophet speaking a prophet's word has creative power to it he grabs the thought of god he speaks it and whether it's 400 years later or a thousand years later because that word has a creative power in it as soon as the prophet speaks it it's gonna happen it's not if it's when it's gonna take place why because it's not man speaking it anymore it's god's thought can you say amen but it has to be spoken and the prophet brought it down to us even in our confession our positive attitude and in this word that we're holding if we begin to speak it in situations and be faithful to it can you say amen then we watch it do its work there's some believing for healing in our congregation i tell them hold on keep speaking positive keep speaking that i'm healed because why is that we don't look at the time when it happens we just know it's going to happen we believe it's going to happen this is our word it's god's word and so but our tongue is it's crucial and it's it's it's a crucial is that we speak words life or death and our our effect and so i want to teach this this morning how many would raise your and say i want to be a i want to speak life i want to speak life if i have the ability to speak life or to speak death i don't want to speak death to myself or anybody else but you have within you the ability to speak death you can speak death but uh as believers we don't no longer want to speak death we want to speak life it's important that we say i want to be a life-giver i want to speak life to people and situations and so you can speak death all of us have the potential i've said this for years you and your your first birth you have the potential of the of the worst possible things to commit now you may not have done them but you may not have murdered somebody but you have with your first birth you have within you the potentials to murder somebody you have the anger that can become uncontrolled you have all the potential to become the worst drug addict the worst alcoholic the worst adulteress the worst prostitute say well i've never done that those things are the paul praise the lord that you have it but i want to tell you i want to tell our young people the nature that you're born with is capable of the worst things of this world that's how they got there is because the nature wasn't changed and maybe it's been kept in check because you've grown up in church and your parents have directed you the right way praise god for that and it's kept in check but the nature of it you are potentially you have within you all the potential to do the worst things and until god changes that nature on the inside you can go to all the psychology you can go through all the mental practices you can do anything you can drink it off you can smoke it off you can try your best to get your mind towards it but there has to be a change of your nature on the inside and when that happens you no longer desire the things of the world and then when that happens is what i've been preaching on now you have his kingdom within you and now you have the potentials of christ within you which means you're capable of doing the works that jesus did by nature jesus said the works that i do you will do also me you don't know where i came from you don't know what i've done you might have murdered somebody and been in prison but when god changes that nature that person that murders somebody has the potential to speak life to someone else you say well how do i deserve to that you don't deserve it but when the nature's changed you become a son of god not a son of the devil you become a son of god and thus your heart and your soul and your lips begin to manifest and begin to speak and to begin to see the word materialized by the word that you speak i'm confessing this thing is true i'm confessing god's word is true i am a believer i've been changed by the word of god and you begin to speak those things it begins to be articulated and it begins to materialize and things that you can't change by your word they begin to change i'm enjoying this this morning i could close right there and that'd be enough to shout on right there we want to speak words of life in our tongue we can hurt or we can heal we can destroy or we can build by our tongue by the words that are coming out of our mouth we speak words of life and so it it is in our hands what we say think about it now i think i mentioned this the first part of the series our whole life has been affected by words everything that's changed in our life has come because of words our whole life has been affected by something that somebody said whether it was god or god through someone else what was said has changed us we're here today because something came through a vessel of god to draw us to him remember last sunday i said the book of acts the seed came through the body in other words you can't find in the book of acts where somebody got a new birth and the creation of the new creation without some other believer speaking it first the gospel to them for them to get it they didn't get it from an angel paul metadays paul met christ but his in his birth in his holy ghost there had to be a man come to him and share and lay his hands on him for in order for him to receive the new kingdom and that tells us we're part of this new creation if you're created in christ you're created a new creation can you say man but it'll come through something that was said by a vessel in that body that's how powerful it is can you say about and so through this vessel you're here through a vessel of god it drew us to him there was already something within us but something said through a vessel something said the word that was said triggered something within us it brought it out it put water on it whatever you want to call it we were in god as a sun before the foundation of the world and when we're born we're born with that part of us that's laying dormant that's laying dead but somebody has to speak something the gospel to us you come into the presence of god and all of a sudden that which is dormant within you comes to life somebody had to speak it that should be his name and so i mentioned to you you know today i have four wonderful children i have a son-in-law i have a granddaughter i have a a house i have a couple cars i have a couple rental properties i have i'm blessed but i get tired just mentioning all that stuff all these responsibilities but i'm blessed and and there's so many other things i can mention but you know my family all that became i told you a few weeks ago it tells the visitors it because oh i got all of that because i said something one day i said over the phone to my girlfriend i said i like you it was before she was my girlfriend i said i like you and i'm gonna be spending some more time with you that's how it all got started i got four kids a house seven acres of property two that i have to mow once a week and all that came because one day i said i'm interested in you and i'm going to be spending more time with you and then she said the feeling is mutual and you know what i said dicks i said i know she's going where did he get all this confidence but that's where i know it's humorous but that's where all this started if i hadn't said those words on that phone that on the phone i said not face to face on the phone look how powerful those words were and if i hadn't said those words i'd still be over on the east side of toledo at the piccadilly apartments eating mac and cheese for breakfast and lunch and going to big boy for supper every day i'd still be there that'd be it i wouldn't have anything else i wouldn't have these four lovely kids and my lovely granddaughter ellie i wouldn't have it but it all starts somewhere and i'm here to tell you everything good or bad starts with words it starts with something that's sad and so if you if you desire things and this is you know it's true in a human sense but it's even more true as believers as we have the word we're holding the word within us it is so true that we we need to watch what we say that we speak life instead of death and if we're wanting something if we desire something in our heart jesus instructs us to speak to if the motive is right jesus instructs us to speak those things and that's what i did i spoke those things and that's what happened if you want to get things going you start talking about it you want to see something further spiritually in your life you start talking about it you start speaking the word of god can you say man you start saying the desire of your heart can you say amen i hope this is okay this morning now this is the truth for all humans you know human beings without god on a certain level they can speak life or death if we talk you know i've got some people that don't have god don't have the holy ghost but they're they stay positive people and their lives are better because they're just positive people so on a human level this is what it says if we indulge if we speak solomon says we will the we will eat the fruit of what we say bad or good but on a deeper level if the believer has eternal life then he can speak life to another or triggle trigger life that lays dormant can you say man one example of that i've used before and that is mary when she went to visit she's already met with the angel of god that which is conceived in views of the holy ghost she said be it unto me according to thy will we understand she's only about 15 years old so you can imagine the enormous word this was she's hearing things from the angel that no one has ever spoken before or said before besides isaiah behold a virgin shall conceive and so he's told that and she just says the words be it unto me according to thy word and right then the thing was triggered because your response was right can you say it you think you can keep turning down what gospel ministers are preaching and you're going to get by with it no there has to be a response from you if you want eternal life there has to be a response jesus preached eternal life to the rich young ruler but it was looking for the right response he didn't respond right can you say amen you have to respond it's not just given in a way that there you have no interaction with it you have to believe the word of god you have to say be it unto me mary is just this quiet and it says she's shy we got all these things but i want you to notice in scripture if you turn to luke 1 or they can put it up on the board luke 1 there the story is really interesting because and i wasn't going to spend much time on it but i think we should then mary when she receives the word it's not even born yet it's just beginning in her it's just it was a seed by the holy ghost within her it's in its infant stages it's not even a baby yet but notice when mary goes and visits her cousin elizabeth and she comes she walks into the room or into the yard whichever way the movies portray it she comes into the yard and she she just greets she just gives a salutation to elizabeth we don't know all that she said they say that she says his name the holy ghost he spoke to me angel smoking he said i'm gonna have a baby and call his name jesus and and so she just gives a salutation and a baby that was dormant inside of elizabeth was triggered to life it moves she hadn't felt it move in however many months it was now sudden comes to life mary doesn't even have her baby yet she's just holding the word this little shy girl shy something like this happens to her and she's not shy anymore she realized i just gave a salutation here and it made the elizabeth's baby come to life god's doing something god's doing something through me that's why i preach this this word this message what god has given you is not just for yourself it's to speak life to others you can't be in some hole somewhere hiding out with the holy ghost god has put us here to be a light god has put us here to speak what we have even if it's your testimony and it can have power within it and you don't realize what it's doing and mary this shy girl all of a sudden now she's there and and she i don't know if you have luke chapter one open but i just wanted to show i caught this last night all of a sudden now when she says that in verse 45 i think it is oh no verse 39 and all the way down to verse 43 it's uh luke chapter 1 verse 43 and whence this is to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which shall see it's not happened yet but he says you're blessed because you believed and there's going to be a performance the word is going to be formed now can you say man everything that was told her by the lord there's going to be a performance of those things and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he has regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great this is mary's song and it's similar to hannah's song who was barren and all of a sudden she realizes god's gonna do this and here's a confirmation i must have something within me because what i said out of my lips gave life to another baby and if what i said gave life to another baby in the womb then this baby is going to come to pass this baby is going to be born and this shy little girl starts writing songs and it just comes out or you know she may not have talked very much before you know she's talking a lot because she realizes i better talk because good things are coming out of what i'm saying even a greeting hello i don't know how she said it hey elizabeth how's it going the lord spoke to me i'm going to have a baby named jesus bang there's power in it can you say man i've been show i've been showing you that sometimes the least little thing that we say can be anointed of the lord to bring life to someone else amen she goes on for he that is mighty verse 49 hath done to me great things that his holy holy is his name and his mercies on them for them to fear him from generation in general he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud and the imaginative from their hearts if he has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he has filled the hungry with good things is this a shy girl anymore no something's happened to this girl something has happened to this girl and she wants to talk and praise god listen there's something about when you find your confidence that what god has placed within you that you're not ashamed to open up and praise god for it he hath holding his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy he spake to our fathers to abraham and two seed forever and mary bowed with her about three months and returned her own house and so boy she really comes out of her she's pretty happy can you say man and hey she should be happy because of what god has just done she should be rejoicing in praising the lord she should be happy you should be happy for what god has done to you and god has provided for you brother brahms says in relation to that white had to be shepherds 1964 the quote she went up to the hills of judea to tell elizabeth and when she met elizabeth she told her that she was going to be a mother and she couldn't understand it knowing no man but she said the holy spirit overshadowed me and said that this holy thing that will be born of me will be called the son of god and i'll call his name jesus and the first time that the name jesus was ever spoke in a human lip a little dead baby in its mother's womb leaped for joy and shouted and jumped in the womb of a mother and it never had received life yet the name of jesus christ spoke life into a dead baby what ought it to do in a church that claims to be born again somebody say praise the law first time it was spoken human lips on human lips that's what it did what could it do in the holy ghost filled church notice in our text it uses the word offend back in proverbs it says a brother offended it uses the word offense i want to talk about offending we'll talk about the the bad side of what we speak first a little bit and then quickly get to the good side again because we can say things even as a christian that can hurt that can destroy that can offend it's a shame when it happens and jesus actually speaks of it in matthew 18. we're going to go there in a minute but when jesus speaks of it he's very straightforward about someone offending someone else especially one of his children and so this word offend we're gonna just talk about it because it is a sin to offend one another i'm prepared for people to get real quiet right now it is a sin to offend someone else it's a sin to cast a stumbling block in front of somebody else how much on the internet today is stumbling people over the message there's going to be a responsibility paid can you say man either repentance has to take place because god takes very seriously someone who misrepresents the thing and someone who causes many souls to stumble and doubt and fear can you say amen it happens every day it happens 24 7. but god does not like it whether it comes to someone else or comes through us it's a sin to offend one another including our own family members and so we can all be preached to this morning can all learn a lesson what comes out of our mouths towards one another matters to god can i get a greater amen what comes out of our mouth in our homes in our places in our in our employment wherever it is what comes out of these mouths now the rest of the world they have given themselves permission to say anything they want at any time from cussing all the way to putting down someone else all the way to gossip they give themselves permission because there's no holy ghost check there it still grieves god but when a son and daughter of god get in the flesh and give themself permission to spill out things out of their tongue god is very concerned about it and especially to offend someone else we want to get out of the mode of offending and discouraging someone else because we want to be a life-giver if you turn to matthew 18 if you offend someone and hurt them no matter who it is god cannot bless your life matthew 18 says this about he uses little children as an example i'm being practical today and you can just um take the what the lord has for us if you would matthew 18 verse 3 3 says verily i say to you except you be converted and behold and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven now it's not just about children he's talking about when you're converted you need to be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of god whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same as the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me so we're not talking about children just children here we're talking about any age of somebody who believes on the lord and you cast a stumbling block before them that's a serious matter to god your word said the wrong thing to discourage them whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me if it it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea woe unto the world because of the offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh you see what he's saying now we live in a world there's going to be offenses and god says woe to all of it he doesn't like any of it can you say man but he says it's worse when somebody even especially somebody is supposed to be representing him woe to that to the person that the offense comes through that is a very serious thing woe to the person that the offense comes through and how did it come through them they spoke something that wasn't right they spoke something that was an offense now just so so so from these scriptures we learn you can't hurt a child of god without hurting god you can't offend a child of god without offending god there's not many many amens on that but if you go over to james and he talks about the tongue i'll go there in a minute just because you were quiet i'm going to james james tackles the tongue james puts the tongue in its place and james you know his type of ministry james was he said let me see if you got the goods a christian james is from missouri he's from the show me state show me what you got let me see it in your life let me see the things you say so we'll go there in a minute but you can't hurt a child of god without hurting him you can't offend the child of god without offending him it offends him and the word offend here in the greek means scandaliso scandaliso sounds like scandal to offend to make to offend it sounds like a scandal something is said and you know whenever a scandal happens it it discourages a lot of people it offends a lot of people take the worst of scandal of a minister who falls in sin and commits adultery so or he falls by money or popularity or women or something like that the three things ministers can fall by money popularity or women and so he has all these influence of people underneath him and people looking to him and trust him you see and so all of a sudden now there's some scandal in his life that offends a lot of people it hurts a lot of souls it is it's destructive can you say man so you wonder this scandaliso means a finn means scandaliso means to make offend to a finn to put a stumbling block or an impediment in the way upon which another may trip and fall and that's the that's the metaphor that's the way it looks is that somebody has stuck a big stone in the way of a person that they can't walk freely and they stumble and they fall down that's what a person does to discourage from going on with the lord they believed they innocently believed they gave their heart and now somebody is either by their words or sometimes by their actions as living a life and the prophet taught us that he says sometimes it's not the bootleg joints or the bars that's so destructive it's someone like elvis presley who claims to be a christian and he's singing in the bars and singing in the nightclubs and then he's in the church the next day he said that will send more souls to hell than all the bars in the country why because people have to look and say i thought he was a christian and here he's acting like the world and singing like the world and gyrating his body like the world and he's still a christian that's a stumbling block to people when people are hungry for something real they don't want to see the world in a life they want to see sanctification they want to see something that's real they want to see this has done something and it's changed my life forever i'm no longer i no longer sing the music of the world i no longer do the things of the world i've been changed that's what people that are hungry for god want to see but when you have a mix it becomes a stumbling block to people i thought this oh i wish i had another hour to talk about the stumbling blocks that have been said by people that have left the message and the stumbling blocks and the calls that i get of discouraged believers and discouraged christians it grieves my heart somebody is going to answer someday a judgment for it god have mercy on the ones who have spoken those words to misdirect souls and i believe god will have mercy on settlement before this over i'm praying for every one of them to see the light and repent of it but if they don't there's going to be a reckoning someday you know who i feel for i just shared with brother kyle the other night i feel for the sheep because i'm a pastor i feel for the sheep a man can go off and do all kinds of things and he'll have to answer to god for it but i care for the sheep i care for the young people that's been offended and and they're discouraged and their their disillusion what's happening in the message but i'm here to stand as a gospel minister i stand for this truth with all my heart not only because it's a movement because it's real in my heart the holy ghost that brother ma'am talked about the christ is living in me i love him and i would never have any other life but serving the lord under this message i love it you know you all know around here you know how much i love it i have more fun than a human being should be allowed to have and it's not just fun it's joy oh let me be a witness for this message this morning this message is not religion it's not some man's idea [Applause] god in his grace sent us this to bring us into a relationship with jesus christ that we've never seen before it's given a secret place a hiding place like sister hannah said this morning it's given this secret place with the lord this relationship with him we would have never known it this way through a denominational idea i i love him this morning i love him because he first loved me i love this message and no doubt in some points in my life i've been offensive sometimes i don't know you can ask my children i'm sure in some place i've made some mistakes said the wrong things but i bring it to the lord and my goal is i want to be a life speaker i want to speak life can you say that amen i want the best of what this message gives us and i want to preach it like i've never preached it before and those that offend we're praying that god will let them see can you say amen so for the discouraged souls that are out there listening so many that listen god bless you thank you for for listening in but i want to tell you listen don't listen to any other voice except the voice of jesus christ the voice of truth shut all the other voices out all the other things that caused confusion because i can tell you god didn't send this message to bring confusion to people it's satan that has caused the confusion it's satan that has interpreted things and caused confusion you're a young 16 year old you're a young 14 year old you've watched a lot of stuff go on but i'm here to tell you that you bet if you get your eyes on jesus christ and him alone he'll restore your hope he'll restore your love for him he will put you in your position as a believer and you don't you get to where i i i i don't i'm like brother diggs i don't have any identity crisis i know who i am i'm a son of god i'm not still trying to find myself i have no identity crisis i'm a believer in christ and the message of christ of the last days i'm glad to be i'm proud to be not proud in a wrong way but i'm proud to be i stand with it because i think it's leading us somewhere i got to have a guide i got to have a leader the lord jesus got to lead me i can't get myself out of this mess i can't get myself in a rapture i need a leader and you can have a personal relationship with jesus christ himself until it's like like uh jesus said to peter that one day he was worried about where people were going to go he said where will this one end up and where's this one kind of going and he's all confused about where where will this disciple go where's this one and jesus said listen just forget about that what is that to thee quit thinking about that just follow me follow me young people just follow him and all the confusion fades away praise the lord well let's give the lord a hand give me a break here let's give the lord a hand i'm your brother i'm your brother in christ this morning i i only seek to tell you the truth amen and i have a lot more energy than what i've had in recent days because i've been i've been biking this week six miles a day zach i know that's not a lot but it's it's good i know you're thinking how far did you bike i don't know um i know that there was joggers passing me i don't know that whether that's a good thing or not and some of those bikes just some of the bikes just what passed me so fast i think there's got to be a speed limit i don't know how they were going that fast i'm sure there's a speed limit for bikers or they had a they had one of those engines on it i know they did because there's no way they could go that fast cheaters i like i do it the old way with my legs and they got those machines on there i'm an honest christian to offend somebody and it goes on to say that in the meeting it goes deeper to in to entice to sin we could preach on that you're influencing somebody else to go do something that's against the word of god you're posting like on the internet to somebody to mislead them they're doing things wrong and you're liking it what are you doing that for you're misleading them you should be the person that unlikes it and if you don't unlike it just don't say nothing don't promote it it's wrong to cause a person to begin to distrust or desert one whom he ought to trust and obey to cause to fall away to be offended in one in essence to see in another what i disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority to cause one to judge unfavorably or unjustly of another since one who stumbles or whose foot gets entangled feels annoyed to cause one displeasure at a thing to make indignant to be displeased so many things that we could preach out of that from the meaning to offend but all of us have done this and all of the seed that sees this happening every day it offends the lord when a little one is offended whether it's a child or a child in the lord or anyone in the body of christ when we speak words that offend somebody else when we discourage somebody from the word of god when we are you listening when parents make the wrong decisions and take a young heart or take their young hearts or young hearts within the church and discourage them by other priorities that's a wrong thing to do you ought to think about decisions you're making we're supposed to be encouraging the young encouraging them in the lord i've seen parents take all of the sanctification of the word and all of the modesty and all of the holiness and give it the label of legalist i got a sermon coming up because i want to preach on sanctification give it a good name again i want to preach on holiness and give it a good name again i want to preach on modesty and give it a good name again because there's people sometimes even in our own ranks that has taken it all anything and said that's a legalist he's legalism i'm sorry my friend that's not true the devil's made it legalism to you but the worst part is to teach your children until they run away from and they're afraid of anything that resembles holiness sanctification modesty they just quickly because you taught them they label it legalist and i need to stay away from that i'd like to spend some time with you and take the bible and say sanctification is from god he sanctifies our lives holiness is from god and it's a wonderful thing i believe in sanctification how many believe in him still i believe in holiness can you say amen i got young girls in here that still believe in modesty and i thank the god for them i i say god bless you young girls god bless you sisters in this church somebody in this world still believes in modesty and holiness holiness is on the inside but it's on the outside as well god bless you sisters for holding up the standard of holiness [Applause] you're not going to be you're not going to get no hand clap of praise out there in the world you're going to be persecuted but in this church you're going to be praised for it and thanked for it god bless you for making a stand for holiness holiness is not legalism modesty is not legalism sanctification is not legalism god through his blood takes a life and sanctifies them from things of the world the things of the world become strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace you stay in the presence of god and he washes all those worldly habits off of you you stay in his presence and he'll wash that habit of smoking that habit of drinking that habit of pornography stay in the word and receive it he'll sanctify your life and you'll be freer than you've ever felt in your entire life you want to feel free some of you young people want to feel free give me your phone and stay off social media for about a month and even with that you're going to feel more free don't watch a video don't watch a youtube i challenge you take one month and don't watch any of it it's got those little things that got a little cussing in and that's okay and you justify it and it goes here and goes here there and you did take one month off of it and see how different you feel you're feeding on the wrong things and you can't have a sanctified life god can't wash you properly if you're still feeding on those things blessed be his name so okay go to james and then i'll close i have to leave right out the door now to be on time james told you we're going to james anybody going with me we're traveling to james we can't ignore james he's got it here on the tongue he's the best commentary on the tongue james three uh my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for many things we offend all if any man offend not in a word the same as a perfect man and all able also to bridle the whole body oh my goodness if you can bring the tongue out of the holy ghost you can bring everything else show how powerful the tongue is if you say lord bring this tongue under subjection may not utter a word unless it's terrifying help me lord this week to shut my mouth to saying the wrong things you might not say it that way to the lord but just to emphasize the point help me lord to shut my mouth because if if you if a man offend not in word his tongue what he said the same as a perfect man also to brighten his whole body behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about the whole body their whole body behold also the ships which through though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whatsoever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fireth fire kindleth fire is a destructive thing the smallest fire if it's uncontrolled can destroy your whole house can destroy acres thousands of acres of forest in california even now now we're in a drought again thousands of acres and it just started with a little campfire started with somebody throwing something in there small fire kindle with the great matter and that's the tongue that's the tongue and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell for every kind of beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and have been tamed by mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison wow and you think i'm a hard preacher that's your tongue it's not talking about somebody that's your tongue has the potential to be a deadly poison amazing there with bless we god this is the part that i'd like to get to they're with bless we god and there with curse we men which are made after the similitude of god here's the paradox the same tongue can bless god and curse other people just like jesus said about the little little children and defending one you can't offend them without offending me you can't bless god and curse men it doesn't work that way you can't be vicious with your tongue horizontally and sing the praises of god and magnify him vertically our vertical relationship and our horizontal relationships must be in harmony with what we believe is that okay with everybody blessing here means to to invoke blessings of course but to celebrate to praise to consecrate a thing with solemn prayers to ask god's blessing on a thing pray him to bless it to one's use pronounce a blessing on it god to cause the pro to cause to prosper to make happy to bestow blessings on favorite of god so this is what comes out of your mouth is that is to bestow up a prosperity or a blessing to bless their their road in front of them we do this to god we bless god we praise god but we don't do it to men that often and what we don't realize is that if we're if we know christ is somebody what we say can pull more of the christ out of somebody how many know that i've preached on before that when paul says about fathers provoke not your children to anger usually it's by your words it can be by your actions but inspire your words provoking is to stir up you say the wrong words to stir up anger in them husbands can say just the right thing to stir up anger in their wives wives can say just especially if you've been married for many many years you know just what to say to get his goat you've learned you've become a professional at it and it's provoking it's stirring it up if you've got mistakes in the past then you use the ammunition of their mistakes in the past when you're real angry you bring up their past mistakes it's under the blood but you brought it up when are we all gonna say lord get my tongue and get my actions in harmony with the holy ghost when am i giving myself the right to bring up somebody's past and use it as ammunition when god doesn't do that against us husbands and wives i encourage you to pray and take this before god and i'm preaching to myself too we better watch our words because that's the one we know the most is our mate and that's the one we can take advantage of too much or we can take for granted of and get loose with our words but fathers can provoke their children anger sometimes by their actions than their mixed up priorities or their words and their there's anger raising up in the kid doesn't boils out every now and then sometimes it could just be hidden i'm angry because i'm looking for dad and mom to give me some leadership in the holy ghost so are we to bless another person i i'm going to have to find a place to end here but where are we to bless we're to bless god james says we don't bless god and curse men are we to bless uh one another yeah we say god bless you well how can we say god bless you and then gossip against the person in that week blessing is not just saying god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you we mean it when we watch what we say about that other person about that pastor we really mean it because we're blessing them and obviously from this praising another human being is right it's our position and duty as a christian to praise another human being and we always back off because we don't want to you know you know we want them to get the big big head but what we're blessing is that christ within them we live in a world of lives today that are live without proper praise to have balanced kids they say you must have nine praises to balance out the one correction i'll tell you when i my kids were younger they can tell you i failed at that i failed at that because i i am so good at finding what's wrong i'm a professional at it but i'm not as good at finding what's right parents you have to find what's right every once while you have the other side of it they only praise their kids and never correct them right and you can tell how they act that's right you know you got to correct your kids you got to have the rod you got to do all that can you say amen but nine praises to every one correction wow that's you know my how imbalanced are some of us it's right and ever so powerful to praise and to bless others can you say amen i have a bunch of other scriptures here i'm going to skip them but i think it's really mostly lacking between husbands and wives and parents and children low self-esteem in women was rated as the top thing and the cause for their depression is low self-esteem in women i should say that we should be the ones brothers and the body of christ that should break this cycle that's in the women to bring honor back to bring dignity back to our women and proverbs 31 says that the woman that fears the lord shall be praised it is okay to praise another human being can you say amen this is this is the truth brothers and sisters can you say amen and so i'm trying to i'm looking through my notes finding a place to end we'll pick it up next sunday again but sometimes we need to watch what we say that we can't bless god oh praise the lord and through the week we're cursing other men and we're we're not blessing other men we can't do that god says that's james says here through the lord james says we therefore bless we god even father and therefore he curses amen which is made at the similar gratitude of god out of the same mouth proceed the blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter can the fig tree my brother and bear olive berries and either a vine or figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh who is the wise man endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom and he goes on and on and on lord help us to know when to shut our mouths sometimes we need to shut our mouths over an issue because we're fighting for the issue and we might discourage somebody over the issue we should be more interested in souls than we are winning in arguments we should be more interested in winning souls than winning arguments or to help us to know when to shut our mouths i want to be a vessel that's participating in creation to speak life can you say amen and about shutting our mouth i'll end on this about shutting our mouth there was a man honored to be a great linguist they paid tribute to him that he not only learned seven languages and seven languages well but they gave him praise because he learned not only seven languages well but learned when to be silent in all seven we give ourselves permission to say a lot of things but we need to take that and say lord you be the lord of my tongue i'm here to be an edifier and that means to build up not to tear down there's enough stuff in this world to tear people down there's enough stuff in this world to tear our young people down let me be an edifier and correction is edifying if it's done right we have to have correction it edifies too if it's done right if it's received right so we're not eliminating correction but we say what comes out of this mouth let it be led of you let it be of god let it be a blessing and not a curse let it glorify you and they may it build up other people and if there's christ in somebody let it pull out that christ part and paul says provoke your children anger it means you're pulling out their anger instead of the good things out of them let us speak words that stir up all the good that's within somebody else pulls the christ the best the potentials how many know brother abraham says this bride has the potentials of him within her she has his potentials within her who pulls those potentials out of their bride members speaking by the holy ghost we pull it out of one another i hope i gave you something to live by this week it's a challenge for all of us but there's a god if he said it then he must have gave us a way through the holy ghost to live it we'll yield ourselves to him we can do it hallelujah you love him this morning let's stand together
