[0:00] place of the wilderness which will speak
[0:01] about what that means
[0:03] but his purpose in alluring her away
[0:05] from all of that
[0:07] is that so he can speak to her god in
[0:10] our lives will allure us away from
[0:12] things
[0:13] and his purpose is to speak close to us
[0:16] and the reason he has to bring us in the
[0:17] wilderness sometimes is because
[0:19] we can't hear his voice we're not in
[0:21] fellowship with him
[0:23] and so he has to allure us away from
[0:25] things
[0:26] so that he could speak comfortably to us
[0:28] aren't you glad he knows how to speak to
[0:30] us how many has ever been spoken to by
[0:31] the lord
[0:32] it's a wonderful thing and he wants to
[0:34] continue that and have that fellowship
[0:36] with you and i'll just
[0:38] add in here verse 19 because we may get
[0:40] to this subject of faithfulness
[0:42] and i will betroth thee unto me forever
[0:46] yea i will betroth thee unto me in
[0:48] righteousness
[0:49] and in judgment and in lovingkindness
[0:52] and in mercies
[0:53] i will even betroth thee unto me in
[0:57] faithfulness so we have righteousness
[0:59] judgment
[1:00] loving kindness mercies but he also
[1:03] draws us into a relationship
[1:05] of faithfulness and that's not only him
[1:08] being faithful to us
[1:09] but it's us being faithful to him
[1:14] heavenly father bless your word today as
[1:16] we just calmly sit at your feet
[1:18] and ask for you to give us those things
[1:21] that we're hungry for this morning
[1:23] we commit it to you in jesus name amen
[1:26] god bless you may be seated
[1:33] god was calling israel
[1:37] as we've been speaking about god was
[1:39] calling israel out of an unfaithful life
[1:42] that they had come to as a whole as it
[1:44] is the children of israel
[1:45] they had been unfaithful to him and in
[1:48] the book of hosea he keeps bringing
[1:50] scenarios of adulteress and a woman to
[1:52] the left he even has hosea
[1:54] marry a woman who would become a
[1:56] and be unfaithful to him
[1:58] as a symbol to israel this is how she
[2:00] was being unfaithful to god
[2:02] so the theme of hosea as we look at it
[2:05] is that
[2:06] theme that a woman a wife israel has
[2:09] has been unfaithful to him and served
[2:12] other gods and other idols
[2:14] and that's being unfaithful to the lord
[2:15] and so then it's not only the whoredom
[2:18] that we see in hosea but
[2:19] it's it's redemption it's it's how god
[2:22] draws her back
[2:24] that he would even draw her back is the
[2:26] mercies of god
[2:28] that he would even give them a chance
[2:30] after their whoredoms
[2:32] it's god's mercy it's god's grace can
[2:34] you say amen
[2:35] and so he didn't have to do that
[2:39] but because of election and because of
[2:41] grace
[2:42] and because god is rich in mercy he must
[2:46] find a way for her to come out of her
[2:48] adulterous spirit
[2:50] and come back to an exclusive
[2:52] relationship with him
[2:54] and if we would be honest with ourselves
[2:56] saints of god we
[2:57] we can we can we we we try to find our
[3:01] way back sometimes
[3:02] and the truth is most the time we can't
[3:05] find our
[3:05] way back god has to lead us back god has
[3:09] to show us
[3:10] the way back aren't you glad this
[3:12] morning when you
[3:13] were away from god he showed you the way
[3:15] back
[3:16] aren't you glad when you're distant from
[3:18] him he shows you the way back
[3:20] he actually is what i want to preach on
[3:22] he allures he allures you back
[3:25] he entices you back he draws you back
[3:28] and it's his grace and his mercy that
[3:30] because sometimes we
[3:32] find ourselves we don't know our way
[3:33] back to relationship with him
[3:35] and people today they get stuck in their
[3:38] habits
[3:38] and and something becomes a part of
[3:40] their life and it so much becomes a part
[3:43] of their life
[3:44] that it actually becomes normal to their
[3:46] life it becomes a normal routine
[3:48] and it begins to distract them from
[3:50] being close to the lord
[3:52] a lot of there are some people who
[3:54] micromanage god in their life
[3:56] they they like to do they micromanage
[3:58] everything else in their life they're
[4:00] controllers
[4:01] and so when god comes in the night they
[4:02] eventually micromanage god and that
[4:04] i need you when i need you and i need
[4:07] you on sundays or
[4:08] maybe not even that it's just whenever i
[4:10] have a emergency in my life
[4:12] but they're micromanaging i want god as
[4:14] much as i want them in my life there are
[4:16] some people like that
[4:17] but there are some who sincerely have
[4:20] got themselves in a habit and away from
[4:22] their fellowship with god
[4:23] and they don't know their way back but
[4:25] i'm here to tell you
[4:26] god can show you the way back
[4:30] and sometimes you don't even know the
[4:32] way back and god has to hold your hand
[4:34] and lead you out and show you the way
[4:36] back to him and in this case he's
[4:38] alluring
[4:39] israel back to him can you say amen
[4:42] hosea is a great study hosea
[4:44] i'm going to suggest to the congregation
[4:47] here that you i would gonna it's not a
[4:49] very long book but i'm gonna suggest
[4:51] this week that you read it
[4:52] if you haven't read it yet um it's it's
[4:54] a wonderful book i want you to read it
[4:56] and i would suggest
[4:57] also listening to invisible union of the
[5:00] bride of christ by brother branham
[5:02] that he spoke because what i'm finding
[5:04] is that what he preached there
[5:05] is actually also in the book of hosea
[5:08] and
[5:08] it links together so wonderfully and i'd
[5:11] like you to how many can maybe
[5:12] take the time this week to listen to
[5:14] that message and also read through the
[5:16] book of isaiah hosea
[5:17] how many would take the time to do that
[5:19] tell you what i'll give you two weeks
[5:21] just to take time with it
[5:22] but i'm encouraging you as a pastor as
[5:24] we've been in this study
[5:26] that's where you'll see some wonderful
[5:27] things take your time and read the book
[5:29] of
[5:30] hosea and listen to that message
[5:32] everything he says in that message
[5:34] invisible union
[5:35] is in the book of hosea and and it's
[5:38] it's a it
[5:38] exposes a spiritual adultery
[5:42] plainly but then redemption is there the
[5:44] threat of redemption is throughout the
[5:46] book of hosea he's going to show her way
[5:48] back
[5:48] and there's going to be invisible union
[5:50] and where when her old husband
[5:52] has been put away and dies and as as he
[5:55] brings out invisible union
[5:56] that's the only way that a woman can
[5:58] come to another marriage
[6:00] properly is if her whole husband is dead
[6:02] can you say amen
[6:03] that's scripture for the woman but
[6:05] especially for the bride of christ
[6:07] all the old affairs have to be gone and
[6:10] dead
[6:11] can you say man for you to have a proper
[6:14] union with jesus christ
[6:16] there cannot be a flirting or an affair
[6:18] with some other idol or some other thing
[6:20] like israel was doing
[6:21] it has to be an exclusive relationship
[6:24] and fellowship with your husband jesus
[6:26] christ
[6:28] amen so i have a lot of things on my
[6:31] heart and a lot of things to preach a
[6:33] lot of different subjects
[6:34] that's been coming out of the word of
[6:35] god but i've been directed of the lord
[6:38] to stay
[6:38] right here in this in this subject for
[6:41] another service
[6:42] because i got the gut feeling that some
[6:45] went home last week after last sunday
[6:48] and maybe went back right to the same
[6:51] life
[6:51] so filled with so many other things
[6:54] and media and maybe movies and music
[6:59] and apps and the gossip
[7:02] and the drama and you went right back to
[7:04] it and you didn't hear what i said
[7:06] that god's trying to draw you away from
[7:09] being so
[7:10] busy and so consumed that there's no
[7:13] time
[7:13] for fellowship with him
[7:17] don't feel offended but i just got that
[7:19] gut feeling i wonder if son didn't catch
[7:22] it
[7:22] and i even said to my my kids and my
[7:24] wife i said what are you going to preach
[7:26] i said i'm just going to preach the same
[7:27] notes from last sunday
[7:29] until we get it i want to move on to a
[7:32] lot of other subjects but listen
[7:34] we got to realize that when we term
[7:36] ourselves the bride of jesus christ
[7:38] it's not a movement it's not that you're
[7:40] a part of this church it speaks of a
[7:42] marriage relationship and in union every
[7:45] day with him
[7:46] it's a fellowship that nobody else is
[7:48] allowed to enjoy can you say amen
[7:50] and if you're not in that relationship
[7:52] if you're not in that fellowship with
[7:54] him
[7:54] then you're not catching what this
[7:56] message was sent for
[7:58] i said you don't know what it is it's
[8:00] not a movement it's not something i'm a
[8:02] part of the message
[8:03] but if you have the term bride then we
[8:05] are the closest people to jesus christ
[8:07] we're not just in a master-servant
[8:09] relationship we are in a relationship
[8:11] with him that's an intimate that we
[8:13] share with no one else
[8:15] and if you're not in fellowship that way
[8:16] with him every day that's why i'm here
[8:18] to preach
[8:19] and to encourage you and watch the holy
[8:21] spirit allure you
[8:23] out of all the things that are busy in
[8:24] life to a relationship with him
[8:28] and i'm determined to do that i'd like
[8:29] to see that i'm so burdened about this
[8:32] subject
[8:32] and i told you last sunday particularly
[8:35] for me i'm taking a self-examination
[8:37] i i'm just it's brought me into a
[8:39] serious thing to see
[8:40] the something greater and a closer
[8:42] relationship
[8:43] in the lives of the people with the lord
[8:46] we may be coming in joy and worship and
[8:48] we may be
[8:48] enjoy the benefits of the word being
[8:51] taught and all these other things that
[8:52] but this thing
[8:53] is about a relationship and i think in
[8:55] one service i i sat
[8:56] all my family down the other night and i
[8:58] said what i said in church a few weeks
[9:00] ago on a scale of one to ten
[9:02] where would you say your relationship
[9:03] with the lord is right now
[9:05] and so i wouldn't do that personally to
[9:07] everybody here unless you wanted to
[9:08] share it but i did it with my family
[9:10] because i said i don't want to know
[9:11] where you're at
[9:12] and i gave where i felt like i was and
[9:14] my children gave where they was my wife
[9:16] and and we just shared and then we went
[9:18] to prayer and i made a commitment to
[9:20] them
[9:21] that now that i know where you feel like
[9:23] you're at right now i'm gonna pray
[9:24] that god will take you closer to him
[9:27] that you're not out of five anymore
[9:29] by by but in the coming weeks that
[9:31] you'll grow closer that you'll be a nine
[9:33] or a ten closer to him
[9:36] and that's why i'm preaching you to to
[9:37] you this morning i have no other agenda
[9:40] it's not about money or position that
[9:42] was gone when i was a young minister
[9:43] i cared about who my name and the
[9:45] message or whatever these things i've
[9:47] grown out of all that
[9:48] i don't care if i get invited to any
[9:50] conventions and i'm not here for your
[9:52] money or anything
[9:53] i'm here because your soul and your
[9:54] relationship with god
[9:56] and if i can't encourage you to realize
[9:58] that this message is not just a movement
[10:00] or something that we say we're a part of
[10:02] but it's a relationship with jesus
[10:04] christ
[10:05] and i don't seek to get you closer to
[10:07] him than i've failed in my
[10:08] office i desire to see you closer to him
[10:12] can you say man
[10:14] i even caught myself monday morning
[10:16] after church i caught myself monday
[10:17] morning
[10:18] grabbing that phone and going right to
[10:20] the same things and clicking the same
[10:22] news buttons that i'd clicked before and
[10:24] i caught myself and said
[10:25] wait a minute boy you better you better
[10:27] live what you're preaching to the people
[10:30] but by habit we we turn because
[10:33] it's so part of our lives we turned
[10:36] everything else first that we're used to
[10:38] turning to
[10:39] and the lord's not number one our
[10:42] fellowship
[10:42] with him is not number one he gets the
[10:45] leftovers
[10:47] and i just feel in my heart if he had
[10:50] time for me
[10:51] if he had time for me throughout history
[10:54] and especially when he went to the cross
[10:56] he had time to go to the cross for me
[10:58] i've got time for him
[11:02] i got myself and i just corrected and i
[11:04] said no no i'm going to lay this aside
[11:07] and if i find out about that later it's
[11:09] not a big deal
[11:10] i want to read the news and the word of
[11:12] god and find out what god's doing i want
[11:14] to stay close to him
[11:15] we're distracted on the average in
[11:18] america about 5.4 hours a day on our
[11:21] phones
[11:21] 5.4 hours of our day on the average goes
[11:25] with a phone time that's about 40 hours
[11:28] a week
[11:28] it's about nine years of our lifespan
[11:32] and it's growing it's growing and the
[11:35] question is
[11:37] what what is it yet your what is it
[11:38] first of all what are you looking at
[11:40] what is it is it beneficial is it
[11:43] fruitful for you
[11:47] anybody listening this morning what is
[11:50] it that you're looking at so much
[11:52] is all of it fruitful is it dragging you
[11:54] down spiritually
[11:57] is it just just a bunch of fluff
[12:00] is it just mindless time that you're
[12:02] feeling to escape from
[12:04] all of your pressures i thought we were
[12:06] supposed to escape to the lord
[12:07] i thought we were supposed to bring our
[12:09] burdens to the lord i thought we were
[12:11] supposed to go in prayer when we had a
[12:12] hard time with our family
[12:14] i didn't think we're supposed to look up
[12:16] some psychology or something to fix
[12:17] family problems
[12:18] we got a god to go to and i thought we
[12:20] were supposed to go to him when we have
[12:22] problems
[12:23] i thought we were supposed to gather the
[12:24] children and go to the word of god and
[12:26] teach them the word and say we've got a
[12:27] mighty god here and we're going to call
[12:29] on him
[12:30] to answer in this problem financial
[12:32] problem sickness problem
[12:34] whatever it is what are we turning to
[12:37] all the time for our answers or for our
[12:39] escape
[12:40] or for our relaxation
[12:44] what are we looking at is it fruitful is
[12:47] it filth
[12:48] that you're looking at is it weakening
[12:50] you
[12:51] is it just mindless uh television on
[12:54] your phone or
[12:56] mindless things that are just a bunch of
[12:57] dirt and trash and
[12:59] dirty jokes and cussing is it that my
[13:01] take a look at your life
[13:03] take a look at the sanctifying grace of
[13:05] the lord jesus christ that needs to
[13:06] sanctify your life
[13:08] but if it's not either that if it's time
[13:10] filling mindless stuff
[13:12] i ask you to examine it because it's
[13:14] hurting your relationship with the lord
[13:18] is it replacing your time with the lord
[13:21] how much time a day is spent
[13:23] walking and talking with our christ most
[13:26] of us
[13:26] if not all this is the this is become
[13:30] way
[13:30] out of balance i raised the question has
[13:33] it replaced
[13:34] in you know remember brother branham was
[13:36] so straight with us
[13:38] about that instrument of the television
[13:40] taking us away from god
[13:42] he said it could have been used for the
[13:44] greatest uh
[13:47] here's where i hang my coat
[13:50] got my mind other things said the
[13:53] television could have been the greatest
[13:55] tool for the gospel to spread the gospel
[13:57] could have been a good instrument it
[13:58] shows that the instrument can be used
[13:59] for the right thing
[14:01] if it was if it was about the instrument
[14:03] we wouldn't be streaming this morning so
[14:04] people could be
[14:05] uh in distances listening this morning
[14:08] it's not about the instrument it's
[14:09] what's on the instrument
[14:11] and he blasted that thing and blasted
[14:13] the unfiltered television and he blasted
[14:15] it
[14:16] so i was asking the question has our and
[14:18] maybe you'd as has phones replace the
[14:20] whole television thing because
[14:21] he was so straight on that but he
[14:23] wouldn't speak against cell phones
[14:25] because we didn't have it back in that
[14:26] day
[14:26] i can speak against cell phones i'm not
[14:29] asking you to get rid of
[14:30] it i'm saying this thing is consuming
[14:31] our life five hours a day that much time
[14:34] in our life
[14:35] and is it going to keep growing and i
[14:36] got a little slide there that watch the
[14:38] transition
[14:39] as we see tv it's true that it has
[14:41] replaced the phones if you guys got that
[14:43] i don't know if you have that slide
[14:44] but tv and mobile devices the average
[14:47] time spent in the us
[14:48] and if you watch this graph 2014 we made
[14:52] the crossover and just
[14:53] look at just two or three years ago that
[14:56] now they're more on their phones than
[14:57] they're on television
[14:58] so i have to preach to you it's
[15:01] everything that we used to get on
[15:02] television
[15:03] now we're getting on our phones and now
[15:05] as satan was using that device
[15:07] now he's using the device that you have
[15:09] sitting in your hand today
[15:13] maybe i need to have a service and not
[15:15] expect any amens out of this
[15:17] but i'm telling you whatever he said
[15:18] about a distraction
[15:20] and the filth that comes across the
[15:22] television we can switch it now to our
[15:24] phones
[15:25] because we've made that transition this
[15:27] is where satan
[15:28] will take your time
[15:31] this is where young people will be
[15:33] exposed to all kinds of filth
[15:36] privately i wish i had never given my
[15:39] kids a phone at
[15:40] their whatever we gave them 13 14. i
[15:42] wish i'd have waited until 18. well it
[15:44] was way too late
[15:46] but they have to be taught the word of
[15:48] god they have to be taught
[15:49] that listen in this world we can't
[15:51] change sodom and gomorrah but we can
[15:54] have principles about us of
[15:56] lord sanctify me sanctify my mind
[15:58] sanctify my heart
[16:00] and if i have this tool oh god help me
[16:03] to keep it
[16:03] sanctified before you
[16:10] i need a closer walk with him you need a
[16:12] closer walk with him
[16:13] and this this this experience with jesus
[16:16] christ i'm trying to be as practical
[16:18] about this this morning as i can
[16:20] this is not a roller coaster this is not
[16:23] a carnival
[16:24] that you've come to it's not a park
[16:27] it's not your christian life is not a
[16:29] carnival where it's a roller coaster
[16:31] ride of up and down
[16:32] the reason i say that is because people
[16:34] are that way they're up and down they're
[16:35] real high
[16:36] and boy they're enjoying the convention
[16:38] and the meetings and shouting and
[16:40] everything
[16:40] and then you don't see them for weeks
[16:42] and they're low and out here doing all
[16:44] kinds of things and that's a roller
[16:46] coaster christian white life
[16:48] or in a carnival we have the twister and
[16:50] that's why i find sometimes with
[16:51] people's mind their minds are just
[16:53] spinning all the time god hasn't called
[16:56] us to
[16:57] to the arcades and all the booths that
[16:59] are set up that are just
[17:01] to actually deceive us and lose all of
[17:03] our money this is not what this is about
[17:05] this is about an everyday walk with the
[17:08] lord
[17:09] it's not a roller coaster it's not a
[17:11] twister can you say a man
[17:12] it's not the candy apples and the
[17:14] attractions that attract us
[17:15] temporarily and make us feel good this
[17:17] is a consistent
[17:18] relationship fellowship faithful to the
[17:21] lord
[17:22] every day he's faithful to us we're
[17:24] faithful to him
[17:25] we stay in fellowship with him and when
[17:27] we make a mistake we quickly bring it to
[17:29] the cross and say god
[17:30] help me never to do that again forgive
[17:32] me may your blood wash me from that
[17:35] this is a walk with the lord
[17:38] and not to let those things linger that
[17:40] distract us the carnival is
[17:42] distractions and candy apples and just
[17:44] to and that's what we live in in this
[17:46] world
[17:47] but sometimes a young person you know
[17:51] even a young person you watch them get
[17:52] close to god and then all of a sudden
[17:55] they get a girlfriend in their life or
[17:56] they get a boyfriend in their life
[17:58] there's nothing not a thing wrong with
[18:00] that but if it's a distraction from the
[18:02] lord
[18:02] it's not the right relationship
[18:06] so many things in this life for adults
[18:09] and young people and children can be
[18:12] distractions
[18:14] from what our walk with the lord
[18:19] maybe luther's day or maybe he wouldn't
[18:22] had to preach a sermon like this but
[18:23] today
[18:24] we got to talk about it we got to talk
[18:27] about phones we got to talk about the
[18:28] busy life
[18:29] we got to talk about the rat race and
[18:31] it's only you can make a decision
[18:33] wait a minute wait a minute the lord
[18:35] wants to be with me here
[18:37] and i make a choice today is he going to
[18:39] have the leftovers or not even get any
[18:40] time today
[18:41] and i sit and i just fellowship and talk
[18:44] with him and stay in the word of god
[18:45] there has to be time in a relationship
[18:48] and i've been preaching it
[18:49] if you didn't do that in a marriage the
[18:51] marriage is going to fall apart
[18:54] there has to be honesty there has to be
[18:56] open communication
[18:58] there has to be fellowship or there's
[19:01] going to be unfaithfulness
[19:03] there has to be more than something just
[19:05] that you're together raising children
[19:07] there has to be a relationship there has
[19:09] to be a oneness
[19:10] there has to be a connection made and
[19:12] when that begins to break that satan
[19:14] loves those breaks in the relationship
[19:15] in a marriage
[19:16] and he's in there to tear it apart even
[19:18] more because he hates oneness
[19:19] but that's when that couple rises and
[19:21] said wait a minute i love you i married
[19:23] you because i loved you
[19:24] something's missing here let's get back
[19:26] together let's let's come back and
[19:28] fellowship
[19:29] and there might have to be honesty and
[19:30] there might have to be all the essential
[19:32] elements that god has given us
[19:34] and if we don't have elements of
[19:36] forgiveness and honest repentance and
[19:38] that
[19:39] we we wouldn't even be able to see
[19:40] marriages restored but we do have the
[19:42] elements
[19:43] of repentance of forgiveness people look
[19:46] to psychology and all this stuff no
[19:48] what happened to the elements if someone
[19:49] repents honestly
[19:51] forgive god forgave you
[19:56] we can't even have a grounds through
[19:58] fellowship to come back unless there's
[19:59] repentance and forgiveness
[20:02] but marriage relationship can't survive
[20:06] without there being a restoration to
[20:09] come back together and
[20:10] fight to get back together with one
[20:13] another
[20:14] it can't happen unless there's a desire
[20:16] on both sides to be able to do that
[20:18] and fight for the oneness i remember
[20:21] singing that song for
[20:22] seth and steph's wedding love is not a
[20:24] fight
[20:25] but it's something worth fighting for
[20:28] love is not a fight but it's something
[20:30] worth fighting for if you had an
[20:32] original love
[20:34] then you fight for it christ had an
[20:36] original predestinated
[20:38] love for you and he had to go to calvary
[20:40] and fight for that love
[20:42] will you fight for your love for the
[20:44] lord will you fight for your fellowship
[20:46] with the lord
[20:47] will you fight to get back in oneness
[20:49] with him love is not a fight
[20:51] but it's something worth fighting for
[20:56] praise the lord i want to point out this
[20:59] morning because of the text of the
[21:00] scripture it will be
[21:02] more than a prayer we pray together with
[21:04] our family and
[21:05] i'm praying for my children that
[21:07] whatever level they feel
[21:08] that they will get closer to the lord
[21:11] but really it'll be more than a prayer
[21:12] and support to get you into more
[21:14] fellowship it's
[21:16] it's you pulling away from things
[21:19] and listening to him allure you
[21:22] back to himself
[21:28] allure means to draw it means to entice
[21:32] having the quality of attracting
[21:36] or inviting enticing or
[21:39] tempting even uses the word tempting and
[21:41] we're familiar with temptation and
[21:43] enticing because we're familiar with the
[21:45] enemy
[21:46] tempting us why does why does he use the
[21:49] same method because we don't just
[21:51] go out usually and just do something we
[21:53] are slowly alert
[21:55] and enticed into doing something and
[21:58] because satan knows how the human being
[22:00] works
[22:01] and you're all human beings he's watched
[22:04] you he knows how the human being ticks
[22:06] and so now he's learned this thing of
[22:08] enticing of alluring
[22:09] every man is drawn away of his own lust
[22:12] second peter said
[22:13] every man is drawn away of his own lust
[22:15] but every man is enticed as he's drawn
[22:17] away
[22:17] he's enticed to temptation but it
[22:20] doesn't happen
[22:21] quickly it happens by alluring and
[22:24] enticing
[22:24] over time and when you're learned by
[22:27] satan and then you fall into temptation
[22:29] then it becomes a habit you learn that's
[22:31] how satan you realize
[22:32] satan got me and it started way back
[22:34] here he alerted me he enticed me
[22:37] it didn't happen overnight can you say
[22:39] amen so we're familiar how the devil
[22:42] works because he knows us as human
[22:43] beings
[22:44] but i want to let you know god works the
[22:46] same way
[22:48] god does the same thing and because
[22:50] satan appeals to the flesh and not the
[22:53] soul satan appeals to the flesh first
[22:56] we gravitate towards fleshly things more
[22:58] easily to be tempted
[22:59] but god does the same alluring by his
[23:02] voice
[23:03] to allure us into the wilderness back to
[23:06] himself
[23:06] he uses the same enticement to allure us
[23:10] to attract us back to him
[23:13] sometimes the voices are so much in our
[23:15] lives we can't hear
[23:16] his voice of allurement
[23:20] but he does it the same way you may not
[23:22] get there overnight you may not get here
[23:23] just in the service today
[23:25] but if i can be a voice and a holy
[23:27] spirit-filled vessel
[23:29] to the lord to speak to me that he's
[23:32] alluring you back into the wilderness
[23:34] alone with him
[23:39] some of you have been distant because of
[23:42] family troubles because of deaths
[23:44] because of financial troubles because
[23:48] someone
[23:48] spoke to you wrong someone's done you
[23:50] wrong
[23:52] some of you got involved in some
[23:55] pretty bad things in your mind
[23:59] and nobody else knows about it but you
[24:02] and god
[24:06] and god knows you're there
[24:09] and his mercy just begins to allure you
[24:12] back
[24:14] draw you away to entice you back
[24:19] the lord uses it his voice is their
[24:21] calling
[24:23] but what's it doing it's it's the first
[24:25] step is to draw us away from everything
[24:29] to draw us away from it all to come away
[24:32] a while read it last sunday in the song
[24:34] of solomon
[24:35] as solomon uses the words come away
[24:37] little one come away beloved one
[24:39] come away little bride the first step is
[24:41] he calls you away
[24:43] we find jesus doing it with his
[24:44] disciples after they he was sent them
[24:46] out two by two
[24:47] and they were very wore out from the
[24:49] ministry they did and
[24:51] in in i believe it's in mark
[24:54] he says and the apostles gathered
[24:56] themselves together unto jesus
[24:58] and told him all things both what they
[25:00] had done and what they had taught
[25:02] so they're telling them of the wonderful
[25:03] meetings you know what jesus said after
[25:05] those wonderful meetings
[25:06] he said unto them come ye yourselves
[25:08] apart into a desert place
[25:10] and rest a while for there were many
[25:13] coming and going and they had no leisure
[25:15] so much as to eat
[25:16] they were very busy doing the work of
[25:18] the lord that he'd called him to do
[25:20] and yet he said at that moment it's time
[25:22] for you to come apart
[25:23] come yourselves apart into a desert
[25:26] place
[25:27] and rest a while and they departed into
[25:31] a desert place
[25:33] by ship privately we cannot have a close
[25:37] relationship with the lord
[25:39] if we're not willing to come away from
[25:41] things
[25:48] this isn't turning out a shouting
[25:50] service
[25:54] but we cannot have a close relationship
[25:56] with the lord if we're not willing to
[25:57] come away from things
[25:59] to come apart jesus said come apart
[26:02] come apart so you don't come apart
[26:06] pull away and change how much time we're
[26:09] spending
[26:10] doing other things and that's why this
[26:12] is an alertment
[26:14] to the wilderness now the wilderness
[26:16] it's it's you know we all understand
[26:18] that because
[26:19] we understand that the wilderness
[26:20] represents it's as
[26:22] in other places in the bible it
[26:23] represents different things but for this
[26:25] thing when he allures us out in the
[26:27] wilderness
[26:27] he has to get us away from the city or
[26:30] away from things
[26:31] and all of us know what the wilderness
[26:33] means because that represents something
[26:35] of getting away when i'm going to go up
[26:37] north or i'm going to go to the
[26:38] wilderness
[26:39] it represents i'm going to get away from
[26:41] everything i'm going to get away from my
[26:43] responsibilities i'm going to get away
[26:45] from all the pressures
[26:46] and i'm going to go somewhere in the
[26:48] wilderness you know i've been a city boy
[26:50] my whole life but i have changed
[26:52] so much the last few years especially
[26:54] but you know when i married a wife that
[26:56] was from the smoky mountains
[26:57] i didn't know there was mountains that
[26:58] pretty and i love those mountains and
[27:01] i've seen a lot of the mountains around
[27:02] the world i love those the most the
[27:03] smoky mountains
[27:04] and but i was a city boy and she knew
[27:07] that and she still married me i was a
[27:08] city boy from toledo
[27:10] she left all those beautiful mountains
[27:11] for me because she loved me
[27:13] and she loved you as a congregation and
[27:15] she left it all
[27:16] to the con missionary work in the
[27:19] concrete jungles of toledo
[27:22] sister bess you grew up in it too she's
[27:25] one of the
[27:26] mission projects that come out of toledo
[27:29] that's why we're here
[27:32] yeah so i was a city boy but you know
[27:34] what i've grown to love
[27:36] because it represents getting away from
[27:39] everything
[27:40] now god didn't call us to get away and
[27:42] go up there like the whole rest of the
[27:43] world and
[27:44] get a place up north and drink beer the
[27:45] whole weekend
[27:48] how twisted have they become he calls us
[27:50] a way to get along with god
[27:52] to fellowship with him undistracted
[27:55] that's what the wilderness means
[27:56] and i was a city boy and i fell in love
[27:58] with those mountains i have a
[28:00] statement on my uh a wall one of the men
[28:02] said
[28:03] uh from new york he was a congressman i
[28:05] believe and he fell in love with the
[28:07] smoky mountains
[28:08] and he made this statement he every once
[28:10] in a while in his office in new york
[28:12] and he would say the mountains are
[28:14] calling and i must go
[28:16] and i have that in my office because
[28:18] every once in a while
[28:19] when it gets to be too much i say the
[28:22] mountains are calling
[28:23] and i must go what is that calling
[28:26] something
[28:27] get me away from everything get me
[28:29] undistracted
[28:31] get away so i can just hear god's voice
[28:33] and enjoy
[28:34] those streams those thousands of miles
[28:37] or hundreds of miles of streams coming
[28:38] down that mountain the smoky mountains
[28:40] now i'm discovering some beautiful
[28:41] places up here in michigan and i don't
[28:43] have to go so far sometimes but
[28:45] beautiful places that we can get away
[28:47] what does it represent to us it
[28:48] represents
[28:49] pulling away and when he says i want to
[28:52] allure you
[28:53] into the wilderness he wants to come and
[28:55] fellowship with you
[28:56] now don't think that the lord is calling
[28:58] you to take every weekend and take off
[29:00] now to the wilderness
[29:01] i'm preaching a spiritual wilderness
[29:05] we know what it means physically to get
[29:07] away and sometimes
[29:08] if you go away you don't get any rest
[29:10] because you got
[29:12] five grandchildren to take care of
[29:16] sometimes you go and you don't give
[29:17] yourself permission to relax and you can
[29:19] go to the greatest vacations in the
[29:21] world some people do
[29:22] and spend all the money but because they
[29:24] don't have fellowship with god
[29:25] and because it's all about money they
[29:27] don't get satisfaction when they're in
[29:29] the wilderness anyway
[29:30] it's about getting away but i'm talking
[29:32] to you spiritually what it means in your
[29:34] spiritual life
[29:35] that he allures you away and pulls you
[29:38] to a spiritual wilderness just with him
[29:41] which means you're pulled away from
[29:44] everything anybody understand what i'm
[29:46] saying
[29:46] and so we he's not talking about you
[29:49] taking off every weekend
[29:50] to up north michigan or traverse city
[29:52] he's talking about
[29:53] while you're in your life now he's
[29:56] alluring you away from things
[29:57] for a few hours away in a wilderness
[30:01] with your bible or with whatever
[30:03] and just fellowship and and communicate
[30:06] with him
[30:07] that you can be refreshed in his
[30:09] presence thank god we don't have to
[30:10] spend a lot of money to go again in his
[30:12] presence
[30:12] somewhere else up north but we can be in
[30:14] his presence right now
[30:16] that's why i'm happy finally for all
[30:18] these years to have a sanctuary and a
[30:20] place
[30:21] only set aside for people to come and
[30:23] worship and talk with the lord
[30:25] a lot of times we had to use the
[30:26] building for different things because we
[30:27] didn't have a facility
[30:29] thank god we can set this building
[30:31] completely aside
[30:32] for one purpose for us to hear from god
[30:35] and us to speak back to him
[30:37] and you can walk through those doors and
[30:39] it's one place in life you can shut
[30:41] everything else out now of course i
[30:43] still people see people on their phones
[30:45] while i'm preaching
[30:46] what a shame you can't even get rid of
[30:48] that thing while the lord is speaking
[30:50] but this building is you can shut all of
[30:53] that out
[30:53] and come in here and release it all and
[30:56] just worship and fellowship with god
[30:59] you say well i'm going to have my
[31:00] problems when i go home
[31:02] i know but at least you can communicate
[31:04] with him
[31:06] and it's a closer to be able to handle
[31:07] those problems
[31:09] you have to have time with the lord
[31:12] for him to correct you for him to
[31:13] encourage you for him to tell you
[31:15] give you direction people get scrambled
[31:19] in their minds
[31:19] what am i going to do what am i going to
[31:21] do have you talked about god i remember
[31:23] one time a
[31:24] minister rebuked me i was all nervous
[31:25] going into a meeting i was lost couldn't
[31:27] find the place
[31:28] i couldn't find the motel i was going to
[31:29] be late for the service and you know my
[31:31] family can tell you i can get that way
[31:32] just
[31:33] oh this is not happening as quick as it
[31:34] should happen and that guy looked me in
[31:36] the face
[31:37] and he says well i was just so
[31:39] frustrated i said i don't know about
[31:41] this
[31:41] i don't know where the motel is i don't
[31:42] know what he just looked and he says
[31:44] well
[31:45] settle down let's have a word of prayer
[31:49] and well let's let god figure it out
[31:51] here just said it real softly
[31:53] and you even get mad at that sometimes
[31:57] but it's a wake-up call you're way off
[31:59] track here
[32:01] you're way too caught up thing in things
[32:03] that don't matter
[32:06] most of the time what's going to happen
[32:07] is going to happen
[32:09] you're way too angry at stupid stuff
[32:15] am i preaching to anybody here this
[32:17] morning you're way too consumed
[32:19] with this problem what even if it's
[32:21] financial or whatever somebody said
[32:23] something
[32:24] an uncle said something against you or
[32:26] somebody in another church
[32:27] gossiped and you're way too consumed
[32:29] with it if you're losing sleep over it
[32:31] i'm preaching to you a place in the
[32:33] wilderness that that stuff you don't
[32:34] worry about
[32:35] that's between them and god what's most
[32:37] important is i fellowship with him
[32:39] and i can be confident and settled in my
[32:42] place
[32:42] in christ no matter what the world says
[32:45] about me
[32:47] no matter what pressures that i feel
[32:51] there's a place in the wilderness that
[32:53] we need to get to
[32:54] and stay there with him
[32:57] and it's a place away from the
[33:00] distractions
[33:01] and the noise where he can speak to you
[33:03] where it's
[33:04] in this case with israel is to pull them
[33:06] away from all their other lovers
[33:08] to get away from the city life sodom and
[33:10] gomorrah
[33:11] the busy life the filthiness of saturn
[33:14] gomorrah that we live in
[33:15] got a message come up coming up about it
[33:18] friends
[33:19] we're at another stage the gay choir in
[33:23] san francisco
[33:24] writes a song that is titled we're going
[33:27] after your children
[33:30] every day something in the news pops up
[33:32] and you know what the lord showed me
[33:33] this week you cannot change sodom and
[33:35] gomorrah i can preach it here you can
[33:37] say amen
[33:38] but you're not going to change lot tried
[33:40] to change sodom and gomorrah but you're
[33:41] not going to change that
[33:43] the answer is to be with abraham was up
[33:45] in the mountain
[33:46] interceding for the souls that are
[33:47] coming under judgment
[33:49] arrested settled and praying god save no
[33:52] you don't go down and try and change
[33:54] sodom can you say man
[33:55] it's knocking at our door but where is
[33:57] the position of abraham
[33:59] god save some souls god deliver them
[34:02] before judgment hits
[34:05] the only thing we can do and we have the
[34:06] power to be able to go to prayer for
[34:08] that
[34:08] distractions notice the nature of god
[34:11] for his prophets
[34:12] he drew them out in the wilderness how
[34:13] may remember that moses he actually
[34:16] could give them
[34:17] his word he couldn't give his word to
[34:19] moses or paul
[34:20] or the prophet of this day until he got
[34:23] them out of the city and away from all
[34:25] the voices
[34:26] and denominational voices moses wrote
[34:28] five books of the old testament
[34:30] and god called him on the back side of
[34:31] the desert to do it paul
[34:33] wrote writing the new testament he had
[34:35] to be pulled away from all his teaching
[34:37] and all of associates
[34:38] three and a half years on the arabian
[34:39] desert he had to be called away in the
[34:41] wilderness
[34:42] in order to get away from all the other
[34:44] voices
[34:45] to write the word of god our prophet
[34:49] under prophecy he couldn't just stay
[34:51] there in jeffersonville he was called to
[34:53] the desert
[34:54] away from everything to bring the word
[34:57] of god for this day
[34:58] notice the pattern god has to get you
[35:01] away for him to give you something
[35:05] it's in the bible god has to pull you
[35:06] away our prophet did the same thing
[35:08] john said that he was the voice of one
[35:12] crying in the wilderness did you ever
[35:13] think about that john
[35:15] said he was the voice of one crying
[35:18] in where the wilderness that meant that
[35:21] he was the one
[35:22] lone voice he was out there by himself
[35:25] it means
[35:26] no one else was speaking things that
[35:28] john the baptist
[35:30] was speaking nobody else was saying it
[35:32] that way as a matter of fact those who
[35:34] wanted to hear john's message
[35:36] they had to go out and find him he
[35:38] wasn't in jerusalem
[35:40] he wasn't around all the churches he
[35:42] wasn't around all the denominations can
[35:44] you say mine
[35:45] he wasn't around all that he says i'm
[35:47] the voice that's in the wilderness
[35:49] and in order to follow this voice you
[35:51] have to come out in the wilderness to me
[35:55] one lone voice in the wilderness he's
[35:57] saying things that nobody else is saying
[35:59] he's baptizing that nobody else is
[36:01] baptizing and they had to come out
[36:03] even if they were pharisees they had to
[36:05] come out to the wilderness
[36:07] with john away from all their stuff
[36:10] john was not amongst all the churches
[36:14] john the baptist was a voice
[36:18] in the wilderness this is the nature of
[36:21] god through the bible
[36:23] he said we want to find him we find him
[36:25] in the wilderness
[36:26] and i'm not talking about up north
[36:28] michigan i'm talking about spiritually
[36:30] you have to come away from things
[36:34] to hear the voice of god
[36:38] you have to pull away so i can't change
[36:41] some things there's some things we can't
[36:42] change
[36:43] but i happen to believe there's some
[36:44] things you can change
[36:47] you may not want to tell how much your
[36:48] boss makes you work
[36:50] you can't control that but that phone
[36:52] that you own and you pay 80 bucks a
[36:54] month for
[36:55] you can control that
[36:58] i can't control it i got to see what's
[37:00] going on i got it you know three in the
[37:02] morning
[37:02] four in the morning you're grabbing that
[37:03] phone you're checking everything it's
[37:05] controlling you
[37:06] and you own that you're paying 80 bucks
[37:08] a month for something that's controlling
[37:09] you you're obsessed with
[37:11] you're borderline addicted to that thing
[37:15] and it's taking you away from the voice
[37:17] of god how much time do you spend in the
[37:19] tapes
[37:19] how much time do you spend in the bible
[37:21] five hours a day
[37:22] on the average on your phone as a
[37:24] national average and i say is anybody
[37:27] spend five hours or even close
[37:29] with the lord in your life this past
[37:31] week excuse me for being so
[37:33] i'm preaching to myself like i'm
[37:35] preaching to you but if we're spending
[37:36] five hours on that phone a day
[37:38] how much time are we spending with the
[37:40] lord
[37:42] i'd say it's nowhere near five hours
[37:48] you forgive me for being so
[37:50] straightforward with you but i want to
[37:51] tell it like it is
[37:53] that we all need to come to a desert
[37:56] spiritually to hear his voice and that
[37:58] means coming away
[38:01] we have to make decisions to pull away
[38:04] from things
[38:06] some people got something scheduled
[38:08] every night of the week
[38:12] they don't schedule church in
[38:16] but they got everything else scheduled
[38:19] you can't make it to church because
[38:20] they're just a little bit tired
[38:23] can't make it the wednesday night
[38:24] because it's just a half hour away and
[38:26] that's just
[38:27] too long and i can't quite make it but
[38:29] it's amazing how you can be
[38:31] everywhere else how do we know because
[38:34] we see the pictures of you at
[38:36] kmart and walmart kmart's pretty old
[38:39] walmart and kroger and
[38:41] over at this guy's house and this
[38:43] woman's house and with the family in
[38:45] this birthday party
[38:46] and that and you've been going all week
[38:48] but wednesday you're too tired and some
[38:50] sundays
[38:51] you're too tired there's nothing left of
[38:53] your energy and if you were sick
[38:55] then you should have been home sick for
[38:56] all the other events

[39:48] [Applause]
[39:53] praise the lord
[39:57] feeble feeble excuses for missing being
[40:00] in the presence of god
[40:02] feeble and you can go do every other
[40:04] thing and work and
[40:06] every other appointment consumed with it
[40:10] i'm just staying right here a minute
[40:14] just consumed with projects
[40:18] and life and planning
[40:21] the next thing don't talk to me about
[40:24] projects i got
[40:25] unlimited projects all the time
[40:28] i got my wife's and mine on the list
[40:33] you get consumed with it my problem is
[40:36] that's not the problem as much as
[40:39] what gets pushed to the very bottom
[40:42] of the priority list and i'm talking to
[40:45] you
[40:46] some of you done it for two or three or
[40:47] four years now every feather possession
[40:50] and real estate project every new
[40:53] business venture
[40:54] has become the most important thing
[40:58] and you can schedule everything
[41:02] but you can't get a hold of your time
[41:06] to say lord i'm not going to go do that
[41:09] today
[41:11] i'm just going to spend time with you
[41:16] i got about an hour here i got two hours
[41:18] you know what i'm changing the plans
[41:20] today
[41:21] i'm not going to go do that lord i want
[41:23] to let you know i'm just going to talk
[41:25] to you a while
[41:27] this is so if this is in your life as a
[41:30] consistency
[41:31] god bless you god bless you but i know
[41:34] for the most part
[41:35] americans where they're at right now
[41:37] it's not a normal thing
[41:44] praise the lord you still love me
[41:47] thank you so
[41:53] the voice of the lord is a lone voice
[41:56] it can't be compared with anything else
[41:59] and you will have to come away from all
[42:01] former ideas all denominational ideas to
[42:04] hear the voice of the lord in the last
[42:06] days
[42:06] i'm the voice of one crying in the
[42:08] wilderness you would have to come away
[42:10] from all the other religious voices
[42:12] to hear the voice of the lord because
[42:14] he's set apart
[42:16] and if god can allure you away from all
[42:18] the idols and get you to himself
[42:20] that he can really speak to you and the
[42:23] bible says in hosea
[42:24] i'm trying to allure you to the
[42:26] wilderness so i can speak to you
[42:28] comfortable things
[42:30] i'll tell you that's exactly what he'd
[42:31] do he's not bringing you out to rebuke
[42:33] you or tell you you're nothing you've
[42:35] crossed the line
[42:36] he's wanting to get fellowship with you
[42:38] and intimacy and closeness with you
[42:40] that he could speak he said comfortable
[42:42] words to you now i'm i'm in
[42:45] i'm in for hearing some comfort
[42:50] are you in he said when i draw you away
[42:54] i want to speak some comfortable words
[42:56] to you i we
[42:57] we americans should be all in for
[43:00] comfortable words because
[43:01] we get blasted by everybody else we got
[43:04] people gossiping against us
[43:05] we got bitter resentment in this world
[43:07] we got people angry we got betrayal
[43:10] jesus said in those days
[43:11] that many will betray one another we
[43:13] can't trust anybody
[43:15] that's the world we live in we're not
[43:17] getting any comfortable words from
[43:18] anybody
[43:19] but god says when i get you alone in the
[43:22] wilderness
[43:22] i'm prepared to speak some comfort to
[43:25] you i'm prepared to speak some
[43:27] comfortable words to you
[43:28] i'm prepared to speak rest to your soul
[43:33] but if you won't get alone with me you
[43:36] can't hear my comfortable words
[43:38] if you've got tons of voices going
[43:40] through you
[43:42] and you've got tons of busyness going
[43:44] through you that you can't even hear
[43:46] what i want to say to you he's got to
[43:48] get you in a wilderness
[43:50] spiritually can you say amen and there
[43:53] there are people that are walking close
[43:55] to god but
[43:56] there and they were close to him years
[43:58] ago but
[44:00] they're not willing to give up things
[44:03] that have filled their lives
[44:05] to get back closer to him so this wife
[44:08] had become unfaithful
[44:11] i just want to speak amended on
[44:12] unfaithfulness
[44:15] and faithfulness we know and we sing
[44:18] about and we preach
[44:20] and we are aware of god's faithfulness
[44:22] to us
[44:25] how many are thankful for god's
[44:26] faithfulness
[44:28] we sing and we speak of his faithfulness
[44:30] great is
[44:32] thy faithfulness he's faithful to us
[44:36] he is there always for us it means he's
[44:38] always there for us
[44:40] his love never ends for us it's not an
[44:42] up and down relationship with the lord
[44:44] he's consistent with us can you say amen
[44:47] he if we confess our sins he's faithful
[44:50] and just
[44:50] to forgive our sins instantly why
[44:52] because he wants the fellowship back
[44:55] and even when he couldn't give the blood
[44:57] of the true lamb jesus christ back in
[44:59] the beginning when adam and eve were
[45:00] hiding in the
[45:01] and putting fig leaf religion over their
[45:03] private parts a fig leaf like a fig leaf
[45:05] religion
[45:06] trying to have their religion as a
[45:07] covering you know so when man
[45:09] fell in sin instead of looking to god he
[45:11] covered himself with his own religion
[45:15] and god comes over and says adam where
[45:17] are you he's looking for adam he's
[45:19] seeking them out
[45:20] adam wasn't seeking god eve wasn't
[45:22] seeking god
[45:24] you weren't seeking god he seeks you
[45:28] and they're in the bushes naked trying
[45:30] to cover themselves with some religion
[45:31] and he says where are you and he says
[45:34] i'm back here and
[45:35] this is what happened and he starts
[45:37] explaining they're all scared they're
[45:38] under condemnation
[45:40] and god draws them out and says come out
[45:42] here
[45:43] take off those fig leaves and he grabbed
[45:46] some animal skins
[45:47] and that an animal died with blood
[45:49] because it's always
[45:50] the way back is through the blood i said
[45:53] the way only way back is through the
[45:54] blood
[45:55] not religion grabs those animals strips
[45:58] and throws those animal skins on him
[46:01] what was god doing he was trying to find
[46:03] even though he didn't have the blood of
[46:05] the lamb yet
[46:06] he was trying to find a place so they
[46:09] can fellowship again
[46:11] and with their sin he couldn't
[46:12] fellowship with him so he has even a
[46:14] temporary
[46:15] throw this on you and the blood of that
[46:18] that
[46:19] goat or lamb that blood of that lamb
[46:21] being killed for you
[46:22] will give you a place for fellowship god
[46:24] is always
[46:25] trying to get back in to fellowship with
[46:28] you
[46:29] god is always trying to draw you away
[46:32] from some of your social media and your
[46:34] private things you're looking at your
[46:36] phone
[46:36] he's trying to draw you away from it
[46:38] even this morning because why
[46:40] he wants fellowship with you he wants
[46:43] time with you
[46:44] put away lesser things don't make lesser
[46:47] things as important they're not quite as
[46:49] important let me tell you something
[46:51] relationships i preached at tuesday at
[46:53] brother gary's funeral
[46:54] brother gary i appreciate i asked the
[46:56] church to come out some of you were here
[46:57] i appreciate you coming out it was a
[46:59] wonderful memorial
[47:00] brother ken the song i just want to say
[47:03] thank you to all who put such a
[47:04] wonderful memorial
[47:05] and i have a testimony of the family
[47:07] that came
[47:08] there was a healing that took place
[47:10] tuesday night between gary's family and
[47:12] our church they never knew us
[47:14] uh we never knew them but there was such
[47:16] a healing and they said we've been so
[47:17] healed because we didn't know
[47:19] the church that gary was a part of was
[47:21] like this if we'd have known we would
[47:22] have come around
[47:23] but but they just said it was such a
[47:25] wonderful
[47:26] time and you all said some wonderful
[47:28] things and and i thank the lord
[47:31] i thank the lord that we were able to do
[47:32] that but i was saying to the people
[47:34] what is value what is value value is
[47:37] your own soul
[47:38] and the souls of others
[47:42] and when we arrange a life that soul
[47:45] your soul and the souls of others are
[47:48] down
[47:49] on the bottom of the list we have lost
[47:52] the value of life
[47:57] making more money is not the value of
[47:59] life
[48:01] it's nice but it's not the ultimate
[48:04] value of life
[48:06] what shall a prophet of man if he gained
[48:08] the whole world
[48:09] and lose his soul this church is about
[48:13] souls
[48:16] we rarely have a financial report like
[48:17] that because i don't like to talk about
[48:19] money we got to pay for this place and
[48:20] it belongs to all of you we've got to
[48:22] pay for it but this church is not about
[48:23] money
[48:24] god will sustain us and take care of
[48:26] things this church is about your soul
[48:28] and the souls of others preaching the
[48:31] word and the blood of jesus christ and
[48:33] the message of christ
[48:34] for the last days why for your soul
[48:40] that you can be in fellowship with him
[48:43] i said value what is it its value is
[48:46] is about your soul and the souls of
[48:49] others and nothing else
[48:51] counts and brother branham's saying that
[48:54] i had an old
[48:54] model t ford or some type of ford and
[48:56] such a nice car
[48:58] i shined it up and i every day i was out
[49:00] there shining it
[49:02] you know 20 some years later says
[49:03] where's that ford today
[49:05] he said somebody put me a new cadillac
[49:07] in my in my garage it's over there at
[49:09] the house
[49:10] he says such a nice thing i never had
[49:12] that something that nice
[49:14] i take care of it but he says you know
[49:15] just another few years there'll be
[49:17] nothing to it it'll be gone
[49:19] so you ask yourself what is value what
[49:22] is value
[49:22] souls your soul
[49:25] where's your soul at where's it in
[49:27] fellowship well i got saved 30 years ago
[49:29] i was at the altar and
[49:30] my soul saved and sounds like a baptist
[49:33] i'm saved always saved i've talked to a
[49:34] baptist he's smoking a cigarette
[49:37] i was saved 20 years ago and god doesn't
[49:39] mind at all i smoke this cigarette
[49:41] there's something
[49:41] beyond just salvation there's a real
[49:44] changing of the desires of the soul
[49:45] that you no longer desire the things of
[49:47] the world
[49:50] and even with that your soul can be
[49:52] saved
[49:53] but you're not filled with the spirit
[49:55] every day
[49:58] a lot of christians are just cold formal
[50:01] starchy
[50:02] christians there's no life to them
[50:04] there's no joy to them
[50:05] there's no revival in their hearts
[50:07] that's the condition of the soul and
[50:09] i'll tell you
[50:10] when you really get baptized with the
[50:12] holy spirit and you
[50:13] stay in fellowship with him your soul is
[50:16] in a revival
[50:17] every day you may wake up monday morning
[50:20] and you don't feel saved but you know
[50:23] you're saved
[50:24] and i'm ready to go against the devil
[50:26] today
[50:29] there's a fervor there's a there's a
[50:31] revival in your heart
[50:32] when you come to church you want to
[50:33] stand up and sing like
[50:35] the song leader says let's stand and
[50:37] sing to the top of our voices there's a
[50:38] revival going on
[50:40] there's a spiritual life going on and
[50:42] nobody's pushed it
[50:43] nobody's pushed you to get up and
[50:44] worship to god it's already happening
[50:47] i'm in fellowship with him so i don't
[50:49] mind getting up with the song leader
[50:51] says let's raise our hands
[50:52] let's sing to the top of our voices some
[50:54] of them are
[50:55] some of you are like a bump in the log
[50:57] you can't get anything to move you it's
[50:59] because of where you are spiritually
[51:01] you're coming to church but there's no
[51:03] revival and fellowship in here
[51:05] it's a mechanical thing i'm here i
[51:08] scheduled church in
[51:09] but it's not a revival in the soul i'm
[51:11] talking about a condition of the soul
[51:14] you may not shout like the rest of them
[51:17] but
[51:17] something will move you and sometimes
[51:20] you're just moved to tears in the
[51:22] presence of god
[51:23] god i'm so glad to be here can i just
[51:26] tell you how much i love you today
[51:28] this week lord you blessed me so much

[52:33] we just end on this faithfulness i know
[52:37] my lord is faithful to me
[52:40] there's no question that but i want to
[52:42] be faithful to him and this woman of
[52:46] israel
[52:47] had an unfaithful spirit and
[52:50] if i can just show you you may have a
[52:54] wife
[52:54] in this world that's unfaithful to you
[52:56] and she's sleeping around
[52:58] or you may have a husband who's dabbling
[53:02] in pornography or
[53:03] sleeping around that means he's
[53:05] unfaithful to the marriage bowel
[53:09] but there are marriages where they never
[53:12] physically been with someone else but
[53:15] they have an
[53:16] unfaithful spirit
[53:19] guiding them they have thoughts
[53:23] of unfaithfulness now we all have
[53:26] thoughts but i'm talking about they
[53:27] carry through with those thoughts
[53:28] and it leads them under things because
[53:30] they've taken on an adulterous spirit so
[53:33] unfaithfulness is not just physically
[53:35] having
[53:36] relations with someone else besides your
[53:37] wife or husband
[53:39] it has a spiritual it's an unfaithful
[53:42] spirit and that's what i've been feeling
[53:43] lord jesus
[53:44] lord jesus i may not go out here and
[53:47] join at the bar at some party or
[53:50] something like that i know better than
[53:51] to do that
[53:53] but lord i want my spirit
[53:56] to be faithful to you
[54:00] because only god knows right you don't
[54:02] know that
[54:04] i want my spirit to be that he's
[54:06] faithful
[54:08] that god has said he's faithful to me
[54:10] he's a faithful partner to me
[54:13] because i know he's faithful to me but i
[54:15] want to be faithful to him
[54:18] in your spirit you can have
[54:20] unfaithfulness
[54:21] and god in his grace alert her back out
[54:24] of her unfaithful life
[54:26] away from her lovers uh away away from
[54:30] what she was
[54:31] uh doing and you remember now eve eve
[54:34] eve in the garden was deceived
[54:38] into unfaithfulness
[54:42] eve was deceived by the serpent to an
[54:45] unfaithful life
[54:47] so every person is deceived in
[54:50] unfaithfulness
[54:51] you don't even sometimes do it will for
[54:52] the yourself you're slowly deceived
[54:55] into unfaithfulness you're alert into
[54:58] unfaithfulness
[54:58] so if you can be alert into that you can
[55:01] be alert
[55:02] back to a faithful life in a faithful
[55:05] walk with the lord
[55:06] and in my private world because remember
[55:09] character what's character
[55:10] character is who you are when nobody
[55:12] else is around
[55:15] character shows up and it's there when
[55:17] no one else is around that they trust
[55:18] you
[55:19] characters when you are when no one else
[55:21] is around so in your private i'm not
[55:23] preaching to what you do here at church
[55:24] today
[55:25] and what you look like and dresses and
[55:27] long hair and all that i'm preaching
[55:28] about your spirit you men
[55:30] with your hair just right and all these
[55:32] other and somebody even wore ties
[55:34] god bless you thank you but i'm not
[55:36] preaching to what you're wearing today
[55:38] i'm preaching where are you in your
[55:40] private world
[55:41] and is your spirit faithful to this
[55:44] christ
[55:45] that you claim are you
[55:48] offering to him an unfaithful
[55:49] relationship privately
[55:53] or is it your desire to say if i'm there
[55:55] lord
[55:57] will be back into faithfulness with you
[56:00] let me be a faithful partner there's a
[56:03] scripture at the end and let me
[56:04] let me end on this one revelation 17 14.
[56:08] and this is at the big war at the end
[56:10] when ten kings
[56:11] gather together with the antichrist
[56:13] who's become incarnate in the
[56:14] book of revelations the antichrist
[56:16] becomes incarnate of man i can tell you
[56:18] who he is
[56:19] but i'll just let you come and ask me
[56:20] about that but it'll be the antichrist
[56:22] spirit that's here now will become
[56:24] incarnated man
[56:25] it will be of a religious nature and ten
[56:27] kings will join together in a great war
[56:29] against the lamb
[56:31] it's going to happen you guys have that
[56:34] scripture
[56:35] but here's hear who is with christ the
[56:37] lamb here's who's with him do you have
[56:39] that
[56:39] revelations what was it again revelation
[56:42] 17 verse 14 can i get
[56:44] that revelation 17 14
[56:47] these shall make war the ten kings and
[56:50] the antichrist more with the lamb and
[56:52] the lamb
[56:53] shall overcome them for he is the lord
[56:56] of lords
[56:57] and king of kings
[57:00] amen it's not over and they that are
[57:03] with him
[57:05] are called are chosen
[57:09] and they're faithful
[57:12] i can read you a lot of scriptures about
[57:14] his faithfulness but
[57:15] at the end this is the people that's
[57:17] with the lamb christ
[57:22] if you notice the first two titles you
[57:24] didn't earn
[57:27] he gave you those titles you were called
[57:30] how many has been called
[57:32] how many has been chosen that's why i
[57:34] said about a bride that's been chosen
[57:35] out of the all the other women we feel
[57:36] so grateful that he's chosen us
[57:38] we want to live for him we want to be
[57:40] his wife can you say amen
[57:41] but it's can i have that scripture again
[57:43] called
[57:45] and chosen but the last title
[57:48] must be how we've lived right now
[57:52] that we i tell you friends
[57:55] it'll be by his grace but i want that
[57:58] title
[58:02] i want that title that's what the bride
[58:05] will be called someday
[58:06] called chosen and she's faithful to me
[58:11] she doesn't have an unfaithful spirit
[58:15] may this spill over into our marriages
[58:18] can i get an amen because we got a devil
[58:21] that
[58:22] fights marriages as well so bad they
[58:25] have an unfaithful spirit
[58:27] may it spill over our marriages but i'm
[58:29] wanting it to come into your
[58:31] spiritual life lord
[58:34] let me be faithful to you
[58:38] and when no one can see i have this life
[58:41] that i live
[58:42] musicians can come i have this life that
[58:44] i live if no one else seen
[58:46] the inside of the inside he can look at
[58:49] me and say
[58:51] he's faithful to me
[58:54] he doesn't flirt he doesn't dabble
[58:57] a bunch of stuff that's dirty
[59:02] he doesn't
[59:05] talk against me he wants fellowship with
[59:09] me and he's willing to pull away
[59:12] from other things you don't think the
[59:15] the love of the lord's going to just
[59:17] swell up
[59:18] when he say hears you say yeah
[59:22] you know what i've got to work today and
[59:24] tonight
[59:25] i'm not going to be able to do that
