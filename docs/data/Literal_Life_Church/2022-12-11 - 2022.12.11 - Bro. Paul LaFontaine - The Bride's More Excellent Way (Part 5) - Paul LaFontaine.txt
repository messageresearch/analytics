========================================

scripture with you this morning if you would turn in your Bibles to Proverbs Chapter 19 and verse 11 we'll read the scripture and study the word together and we pray that this will be a blessing to you this morning we thank God for his grace we thank God for all of our musicians helping us today and all the different components and Gifts within the church working to make a service possible and just to create the right atmosphere through the songs and through your worship that the Lord can be welcome and it's not just that he's invited but he's welcome there's a difference in in just inviting the lord it's if he feels welcome your worship makes him feel welcome when you open up your hearts and sing and praise and express your heart to him Lord prepare my heart and someone sings a special We join in with them we're never just Spectators but we have a responsibility and a love for the Lord that we want to make sure that his presence is welcome among us and that he can do his good work in each of Our Lives Proverbs Chapter 19 and verse 11. I'm just reading this one scripture and we're going to preach off of this this morning in our series the bride's more excellent way and this says Proverbs 19 and verse 11 says the discretion of a man defareth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression the discretion of a man defereth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression and I might reword that there are many different translations but I'll just reword it so we might understand it a bit better and that is the discernment of a man the the caution of a man would defer make him not react so quickly and anger would defer his anger and it is his glory to cover a multitude of sins there's a glory in that there's a christ-likeness in that and that is when you not only forgive but you pass over transgressions can you say Amen Lord bless your word today anoint it we pray that you'll bless the whole day Lord of fellowship and as we come together Lord for the Christmas play tonight that you would bless everyone who comes bless the children help them to remember their parts help them Father to be anointed in their presentation of Christ and Lord if there's any hearts here they're hungry for more of you I pray father as they come that you would just put them in your presence that they could hear from you today and that you can fulfill that hunger that's in their hearts we look to you father the author and finisher of our faith the originator the Perfecter of our faith and we look to your word that you've blessed us with to be able to bless us we just commit our hearts to you for the day and we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you're seated today this verse in Proverbs 19 and verse 11 has just been intriguing to me the last few days as we've been studying over and this verse actually in one verse covers both of my new points as we cover them today and the bride's more excellent way just so you know if you haven't been a part of the series that we're out of First Corinthians 12 the last scripture in verse Corinthians 12 says covet earnestly the best gifts but yet I show unto you a more excellent way and then Paul goes into all the attributes of love divine Love In First Corinthians 13 and so we've been taking those things little by little and we're going to take two more of those things today what the excellent way is and what divine love is and how that translates into Holy Ghost love being expressed in this hour from our vessels not just a shallow love but holy ghost Divine love expressed through us and we know that it's been taught us us that when when uh saw when Divine love projects then Sovereign Grace takes over so it's not just that we say I love God it's not just everybody matter of fact this Christmas season there'll be a lot of people say they know Christ and they love God but it's not just that we love God but that we have the love of God by the Holy Ghost and that we project that love in everyday situations and then he said if then it's been said that you when you project love when Divine love is projected not just I got it but when it's projected and manifested then Sovereign Grace can take over situations that we cannot handle that we cannot do something steps in how many would love it if the Lord would step into situations so when love is projected there's so there's a power that works in love love is the most powerful force in the world I shouldn't say love is because there's a lot of different versions of love that the world has given but Divine love Holy Ghost love is the most powerful force in the world can you say Amen there is nothing greater there is no demon there is no political power there is no government there is nothing more powerful than Divine love there's no church there's no system there's no religion that can be as powerful as Divine love and so this is what we want it to project we want it to project on our lives and so I'm going to cover two two more points of divine love and that is love is not easily provoked to anger number one love is not easily provoked to anger and love does not keep a record of others wrongs so that's the two we'll be looking into today love is not easily provoked uh to anger and love does not keep a record of others wrongs so there's just something intriguing about this particular verse and it's amazing that this one verse can say so much even about the points that I'm on today uh for uh and and to look at a man that could come to a place and and in God that it says here there's such wisdom behind it because it says the discretion of a man this isn't some worldly man this is a Godly Man the discretion of a man defareth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression that is not the glory of the world that is not the way of the world that is not a man of the world this Glory has to be a glory that that has come in that man from God from God because the glory of the world and the way the world is is that we do keep record of wrong we don't cover transgression we remember transgressions we don't defer our anger we usually react in Anger that's the world's way but when the glory of the Lord comes in a man or a woman then it's going to be manifesting more of these things and that is a a deference because of discernment you step back and look and before you react in our number one default thing and that's anger before you react in Anger you defer it with wisdom and with discernment to say now wait a minute what is the what is the whole picture can you say Amen what is going on here before I just just respond in anger and then it is the glory of a man to pass over or to cover all over a transgression that's been done to him or any transgression it's the glory I can say safely it's the glory of God to pass over a transgression of somebody else so this is something to say that this amazing this this amazing verse can say so much for a man to come into this kind of reaction and the covering another man's sins he would be entering into another Glory than a regular man reacting in anger and vengeance quickly and keeping tabs on others wrongs is the glory of a worldly man in fact he's praised for it have you ever watched that the men of the world and our stars and our sports stars and our movie stars and the people that are everybody's looking to have you ever noticed how much they get a free pass from manifesting any character because that's the glory of the world so they get free passes all the time they we overlooked that because of their gift because they're good at football or whatever else and they live all kinds of lives and do all kinds of things and yet that glory is the glory of the world because we're still going to praise them we're still going to glorify them we're still going to build them up as a being a mighty Superstar and movie star and singer and all these other things no matter how they live how much they cuss how much they they evade their taxes how much the the the the dirtiness of their life how many marriages they have it doesn't matter what they do we will still glory and praise them for their gift but that and and that is the that's all the further the glory of man goes but this man in the scripture has to be a man of God because a man of the world is praised a man of the world is actually praised for getting back at someone to even the score with somebody to cuss and to think he has he has won the battle by cussing someone else that's the type of people we glorify and to think that he he is a man because in a movie or a video video game this man mowed down hundreds of people with his AK-47 or some machine gun and to think that that he's a real man and he's considered a man because he learned how to to deal with things this way and and that he actually dies holding hateful grudges towards people this is what the the world glorifies but when the glory of the Lord comes on a man he doesn't hold grudges he doesn't hold on to the past and he can cover the sin of another can you say Amen praise the Lord but man from the beginning that's the world but man for the beginning how many know has been made to come into another Glory the glory of the Lord was upon Adam he was in he was a he was a Son of God and he acts like God and when a Son of God comes into that place of Glory again through Redemption he acts like God and he reacts like God I said he acts like God and he reacts like God and we first begin to see this we seated a little bit through the Old Testament but we first begin to see that the glory of God had come back and a man that had fallen from Adam because he was in that Glory Now That Glory completely fills the vessel of Jesus Christ and we see a man with the glory of God act like God do Miracles like God do do signs like God can do right in his vessel but it wasn't just that Jesus acted like God In Miracles and signs and wonders he reacted to situations like God would so it's not just that you act like God but that you react to life situations like God because it's God living in you is everybody awake this morning I was just checking he acts like God he reacts like God and we seated in Jesus Christ we love to hear the Miracles because that was the glory of God upon him that was part of the glory of God he's he's doing Miracles he's able to raise the dead he's able to multiply the fishes and Loaves and so this is the part that gets emphasized many times about Christ Christ is the Miracles we know that the glory of God had returned into the second Adam we call Jesus the second Adam because the first Adam had that he fell away from it and now we have the second Adam Jesus Christ acting like the original Adam who was in rulership and had the authority of God Jesus had all of the authority of God can you say amen he could do anything he wants through the spirit of God that was within him he acted like God but also there's many situations in the four gospels that shows that he reacted like God when demons were coming against him when he was being accused when he is being even beaten the the deeper part of the glory of God was that when Jesus was reviled reviled the Bible says he reviled not again so we know the Miracles but what about the reactions to being reviled the Bible says he reviled not again when anger came at him he didn't react with more anger unless it was holy anger who was correcting religious spirits the boldness you see Jesus was both lying and lamb and with Lion he was the king and he had the boldness and most the time his correction was to religious people so he could call them out of their religion and out of denomination and out of all that phoniness can you say Amen that the systems bring to the people Jesus was bold with religious people to tell it like it was to say you need to come out of that so he was lying but he also was lamb he was sacrificing he had the gentleness can you say amen and so now I just want to quickly get to this because I could preach quite a while right here on Christ I love to preach about the other side to him that's not preached that often but you see now the deeper was is when he was reviled he reviled not again we've seen him when he even had a right to speak Jesus he had a right to speak he was been accused being accused of being wrong he was right they were wrong and he had a right to speak about it and we see him shut his mouth and did not take his right to react this is the glory of God the glory of a man is to cover a transgression and to defer his anger and to hold back and get a discernment of the situation he was falsely accused and he let it go we've seen him boldly correct religious Spirits holding nothing back but then we see him with the woman caught in into in adultery and from the situation with the woman caught in adultery and I don't have to read this you know the story if you don't you can read it in your Bible we find in the situation when the religious leaders brought a woman caught in adultery caught in the very act obviously the situation is they were very angry at her they were very upset because like we caught this woman she's living this way they bring her before Jesus to test Jesus what are you going to do with her knowing that what the law said to do with her and so so it's whenever you have situations like that when someone's going to bring a court case and this is why we have a world full of people suing one another because people get angry and the only way to settle it is to bring them into court I'll see you in court buddy I'll settle this in court I'll see you I'm I'm going to lawyer up you lawyer up we'll see who wins and so we bring it into court and there are some things that will only be settled in court but I'll tell you where it starts it starts with somebody getting angry with somebody there was an injustice done but the Injustice listen now the Injustice is one thing and we have injustices and we have to seek them to make him right sometimes but the anger about it and what you do about it in your humanness is the flaw of man because this life you will have injustices in this life you will have people speak against you in this life people will wrong you I can't guarantee that's not going to happen even this week it's going to happen it's not that it's not going to happen it's what we do with it so now anger became a part of this situation they found her now we're going to test Jesus and so now when you have ten situations come and they're dragging this woman out and they throw her right in front of Jesus and they're all standing around and they're going to their their anger is going to test Jesus because they're already angry at him angry at his ministry they don't like him so we're going to bring them to a test now we find somebody we're going to pull this and this is a very very tense situation and everybody in the whole atmosphere is tense except one person good only one person is keeping their cool only one person is not joining in as I said last Sunday some people want to draw you in the ring with them and have a have a few rounds don't be drawn in the ring with them I had a sister tell me I my family oh my family Lord have mercy they're trying to draw me I will not after what you preached this morning brother I will not I refuse to be draw brought in the ring with them praise the Lord okay and they hate they get madder at you if you won't get in the ring with them it's like I'm not a boxer I'm a Christian right I'm not I don't I don't function that way I'm looking to the word for my reactions and that's not going to do any good to have a 10-minute argument and drop a bunch of bombs and now now the relationship's worse it's not going to do any good so you see Jesus this whole situation it's all tense but he's not tense he's relaxed he's at peace he's standing there and I guarantee you he is not going to join in with their anger with their judgment their accusations with all of their their view of the word of God that he's not joining in with any of that the glory of the Lord is upon him and that is we learn from the prophet perfect Faith how many believe Jesus was living in perfect faith perfect Faith Masters every circumstance now the glory of the world is it's the other way around is that circumstances Master us circumstances Master our emotions circumstances Master how we react but this is a man with perfect faith and perfect faith and perfect love Masters every circumstance and he's standing there completely calm like he was in the boat when the storm came up some Minister was here a few weeks ago brought a great message on the storm and he's calm he's actually sleeping in the boat Jesus is actually sleeping while there's a big storm up and the disciples are scared to death and Jesus is taking a nap during the storm talk about a peaceful man talk about a man that's at peace can you say Amen there is in any storm there it is in any anger there isn't any accusations there isn't any Spirit of people there isn't anything that's going to move him from his peace Hallelujah he's sleeping in the storm Lord don't you care that we're about ready to get destroyed here don't you even care he's sleeping during the storm peace in the midst of the storm can I get an amen this morning are you seeing the vision peace in the midst of the storm he's sleeping during the storm and he gets up and the first thing he does he has the power to address the storm and he does but before he speaks to the storm he speaks to the disciples fear they play this on wlmb when I spoke about it taught about it wlmb Jesus had power to speak to the storm he's got power to speak to your storm today all he has to do is wave his hand and speak to your storm in your life and it would be finished but before he spoke to their storm he spoke about their fear Jesus would rather cast out your fear than cast out your storms can I get an amen this morning because you see now if he's dealing with your fear he's dealing with something probably that's greater than the storm you're making the storm the storm I'm going to die I don't think I'm going to survive this Lord don't you care this storm in my life this divorce in my life that all this thing is happening and you got your mind on the storm and you want Jesus to get his mind on your storm trust me Jesus knows about the storm Jesus knew there was storms going to be in your life he knew about this storm in the boat can you say Amen but he would rather cast out your fear because perfect love cast out all fear what's the greater victory that Jesus speaks to your fear he said why are you so fearful to the disciples why are you in the and can you imagine the storm it's getting ready to knock the boat over it's just it's just and he's wanting to have a conversation about what's internally inside them it's like Jesus hello can we take care of this first no why are you so fearful that's worse I got to get my disciples out of human Faith to perfect faith I got to bring him to a Pentecost I gotta fill them with the Holy Ghost I got to get ready to make him rise as Sons and Daughters of God and so a storm a storm you're scared you're afraid about your life you're afraid things are going to be over here you're afraid this is the the last of it we we tend to set our storms in life huge mammoth bigger than our internal problems praise the Lord so Jesus was in this situation and I got to finish up this but when they the the the the the the the Pharisees had kept a tally of her adulteries they were keeping record and they had it all there had it all written down they had it this is this and this man and this man and besides this whole record of wrongs and adultery we've caught her today in the act and so we got a situation here so we're just wondering how you're going to deal with it and here's this man with the glory of God the discretion of a man deferth his anger first of all he didn't get angry about it and His glory to pass over a transgression and he steps back and he looks much deeper than any of us are looking he steps back and he first he says let him that's without sin cast the first stone they begin to drop their stones but he that day looked at her and and he I'll say it in my own words he says you are free it's washed away he did not remind her of the record of her life because in that moment the record of her life was washed away and he of all people there was not angry was not reacting the situation he looked with discretion at the whole situation and we know he looked in the with the eyes of predestination and he's seen this was a daughter of God but she had this whole record of stuff but in a moment's time he was able to wash all that away and said go and be free and today you are free to start with a clean slate today today you can start with a clean slate and that was the glory of God in Jesus Christ because it's the glory of man a God man to pass over a transgression it's the it's the flaw of the world to keep records of somebody's wrongs is everybody okay with this this morning sure are quiet this morning I hope you're listening really intently and I hope there's amens in the soul because I'm not getting a lot in the lips this morning operation and just just to say it further the glory this Glory this Glory that was in Jesus was to come in Sons and Daughters of God can you say Amen John 1 says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God and this Glory was to come in all Sons not just some Sons but all his sons look at this term the sons of God in the New Testament to as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name Romans 8 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God plural the sons of God all creation later on it says all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Hebrews 2 for it became him Christ for whom are all things and by whom all things are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings he came not just for himself but to bring many sons to the same glory and if it is the glory Glory of man to to defer his anger and to say I'll step back and wait for the leadership of the Lord in every situation and then I'm willing to cover a transgression I'm not I'm willing to to release the record of wrong in somebody's life and see them forgiven that is the glory of God and it won't just be in Jesus it'll be in the sons of God praise the Lord anybody wonder and I'm speaking to all who's listening online as well anybody wonder why these terms of sons of God are in the New Testament the revelation of Jesus Christ and the mystery of Christ is not just in the Son of God but in the sons of God otherwise this term sons of God wouldn't have been mentioned so much in the New Testament it is in the New Testament can you say man it's sons of God coming to the same Glory my Christian friends let me ask you today how many sermons have you heard at your church about the sons of God I guarantee you've heard hundreds of thousands of sermons your whole life about the Son of God you'll hear a lot of them this Christmas the Son of God was born and that's wonderful but I'm here to tell you that's only part of the mystery that's only part of the Revelation you're ignoring the whole other part it's not just the Son of God but it's the sons of God coming to the same Glory that was in Jesus Christ you better find a church that's preaching the full counsel of the word of God not just the Son of God but what that son comes and live in Sons in his glory that's the full mystery of God somebody say praise the Lord this morning hey how many sermons you heard about the sons of God I just read a few to you the manifestation all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God not the Son of God the sons of God praise the Lord at the end of 2000 years the church history there was a turning point let me just bring this out while I'm on this subject at the end of two thousand years of church history hope you're listening at the end of two thousand years of church history there was a turning point that happened in Revelations 5 Revelations 5 is a turning point you had seven Church ages seven churches they were in Asia Minor but they were types of seven Church ages of two thousand years of church history we're in the laodicean age the final age and so it was Seven Ages and then there was a missing part and Calvary had paid the price how many believe this morning that Calvary had paid the full price of redemption but yet even Calvary and I've been thinking about this this week with Calvary and even Jesus said at the cross it is finished well that's because in the mind of God the work of redemption was finished but you weren't even born yet you weren't redeemed yet so even though he proclaimed it is finished it'll be a complete Redemption but you hadn't come on the scene so now 2 000 years of predestinated sons of God come forth and be redeemed redeemed redeemed and then we get to the last one and we realize there's still a missing part he went to Calvary but there's still a missing part of redemption what was it the book of redemption that had your name in it was sealed up um write in your Bible revelations 5. so there was even though Christ went to Calvary the Son of God there was a barrier keeping sons from the full complete Redemption as Sons there was a barrier so all the glory of what the son could be was held back to the sons there was a breach between the church ages and the seals that's the way it's termed the breach between the church ages and the seals a breach a breach is a gap or a breakthrough to a wall or a barrier he termed it the breach between the church ages and the seals Revelations 5 is the breach between the churches and Zeals and the breach is a gap everybody listening a breach is a gap or a breakthrough to a wall or a barrier there was still a barrier to get to and Revelations 5 is the book of redemption in other words there was a barrier we couldn't get fully to our names in the book and full Redemption until he he made a gap he made a breach and the breach that he broke the berry was seven Zeals on it that was the bear you couldn't look at it nobody could look at it nobody was worthy to look at it and even John cried and wept why was John weeping in Revelations 5 because nobody was found worthy to look or take the book or take the seals off and if nobody took this book all of creation would be lost there was a barrier but I'm here to tell you by the grace of God in the last days he breaks he breaches that he makes a gap and he tears the seals off of that book so finally sons of God not just the Son of God but sons of God and guess what it was the lamb who did that as well it was the lamb that was worthy tore the seals off in this last days so sons of God begin to look and see their position in the word so that they can come to his final Glory I know this is going to translate into how we act every day that's the way I always lean but I want you to know the mystery of it the breach the Gap has been made the seals have been taken off the book of redemption somebody say praise the Lord that's the hour you live in if you don't know it my friend if you're listening you're here you don't know I would be glad to share with you the scriptures to show it's time the time is now he even gave us the exact day when he would do it the time exact season that he would do it when he said in Revelations 10 7 because in Revelations 5 it was closed then the lamb takes it in Revelation 10 it's open and what did he say he gave when is it when is it when is it going to happen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when Isha begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished he gave the season it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he will break this Gap he'll make a gap he'll break the barrier can you say Amen that Sons can begin to walk into and step into that position as a Son of God and all the glory of God can pour upon the sons of God again Hallelujah this is why Solomon could word this this way and say the discretion of a man defer his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression this is why because with discernment and caution with discernment in the sons of God there's discretion before they react and being led by the spirit of God as sons of God we don't react in our anger and a son of God has the ability to cover a multitude of sins instead of keeping account of them in everybody's life it is the glory of God to do so so this week you can choose you can live like everybody else or you can submit yourself instead let the glory of God fill this Temple that I stopped keeping a record of everybody's wrong praise the Lord this discretion is showing good judgment in situations before reacting looking deeper into it before we react in Anger you know police are example policemen are example of having to use discretion in every situation I thought of them a policeman let's first of all say the policeman has has to use discretion in every situation that changes every day with every situation and we know there's a few cases there's very few cases where a policeman fails in his discretion and sometimes he has to react very quickly you know he's armed and he's not only are but he's got the authority to use the the uh he's that he's armed and so now he walks into domestic situations he walks into people with guns then he walks into uh all all kinds of situations I wouldn't want to be a policeman but you see now he has the authority from the city or from the state to to act can you say man but he has to act with discretion and some decisions have to be made quickly and it's difficult and some of our law enforcement there's been few cases where they have failed and they didn't use the right discretion and they fail miserably they either get fired they go to prison for it we understand that because of their humanness we understand it because we're human can you say Amen but you see now there's more cases and I say if you got the statistics there's thousands more cases than the ones where they failed what police been acted with with with with caution and they acted with discretion and they was trying to to weigh the whole situation as best they can so they don't react the wrong way with their Authority now the rest of us don't have that Authority but policemen have that Authority so their discretion in every situation is important to us that we have a trust in those men that they will act at every situation with discretion with discernment can you say Amen but guess what police have the authority they've got that armor with them they're to react quickly but but but they they're sometimes even acting quickly they got to have discretion they got to have caution they can't let themselves become irritated too irritated with people because if they let them their own anger and their own irritation it would take over them and all of a sudden they're they're grabbing their gun and they're using it for the wrong reason they have the authority to use that but you have to have discernment with it they can't let themselves become irritated people get mad at police all the time and I think they get mad at uh I think they get mad at Authority in general they don't like anybody in Authority we have a generation that don't like anybody in Authority they don't like to uh come under any Authority they want to get rid of the cops they want to defund the police system what kind of word would we have then we elect them and we give them Authority so that we're protected but we would love to have a force that uses discretion we don't want someone's going to snap right and so now this is I I know it's strange to type sons of God with policemen but you know what sons of God have the authority of God to use any way they want sons of God have the authority of God like a policeman a pastor has certain authorities that's been given him to God a husband has Authority uh and so there's god-given authorities but you can abuse that or you can use it in the right way it's your discernment but there are certain people in Authority they get the authority whether they use it right or not they get it and then they'll lose that Authority if they use it wrong can you say Amen pastors and all you keep abusing the authority of God God's going to remove you or the congregation is going to remove you and so but but listen now every believer every believer in Christ has the authority of God we have Jesus name we not only say Jesus name but we have the power of His name and so we hold that Authority and hear the policeman he carries Authority he carries heat he has to have discernment and all kinds of situations if if Bob is traveling for lack of a better term Bob is traveling at 75 miles per hour in his 60s uh miles an hour speed limit then the police officer pulls Bob over and he has a he has this is all to bring out what discretion is it has he has a decision of either giving Bob a warning or giving Bob a ticket how many is glad when you get a warning all right because you know even if you're guilty sometimes you know your heart you know I I've tried to it's not like I got a million tickets but I have tried to use with my tickets everything in the book and whenever I try to use something intentionally I'm a pastor it's always backfired on me it gets worse after I say that well if you're a pastor why are you speeding I'm a Christian I was on my way to church just it's better not to say nothing Bob has the authority to make the decision doesn't matter you know is he and and so Bob uh Bob is going to get a warning but the policeman has the authority over Bob he's going to make the call and when you get pulled over and when like here bobby gets pulled over for a ticket here and he's speeding both sides it can be a pretty tense situation the police can be mad at him speeding I've had policemen very mad they're very mad they're very upset and that you know to me oh my if this guy's walking up this mad I have no mercy whatsoever just because he's mad and he's he's mad plus he has the authority so I'm not going to get out of that ticket and sometimes I don't want to get out because I'm guilty if I'm not guilty I say it but if if I'm if I'm guilty I say yes sir I was doing that and I find that works better I had I had one just the other day like I said I don't have a million of these pullovers Brother Kyle Sister Laura our editors now for the videos and more and more I have to edit things out but you know I had on the other day I just thought right I said sir I am guilty I uh I pulled over on a highway in the traffic I pulled to the right side and uh you're not supposed to go you're supposed to stay in the lane if you even if you're backed up for two hours you stay in that I did it boy he got me and he walks up just saying I said listen I am I did it I'm guilty I know I wasn't supposed to do that he said well at least you're honest about it and I got off the hook found that's better than saying I'm a pastor no and don't get you off but but that policeman has to make a judgment call because he has Authority but if he walks over there like a lot of them in Anger he's if he's going to stay in his anger about it he needs to be calm-headed because he's going to come into a lot of situations but if he stays he's just angry and he takes his authority is anybody listening to what I'm preaching this morning if he has Authority and he takes his anger with his authority it's not going to be good it's probably not going to be a good judgment in this situation you see so that's Christians we have authority but we we don't have a right to react in our anger we might be upset about it but we have to be careful we're not drawn into the situation and so now the the policeman's mad Bob's mad because he's being pulled over Bob's mad the police this is a tense situation Bob's upset why did I get pulled over I wasn't speeding most the people defend themselves even though we're when they're wrong they're saying I didn't do nothing I've got to get to work all these other so everybody's angry everybody's angry Bob's angry the policeman's angry Bob's wife is really angry sitting next to him she's mad too which which doubles the anger and everything's tense and then if you got kids in the back your kids are scared to death that they're all going to go to jail my kids when they were little it's just like we got pulled over a couple times and it's like they were scared of Solomon's big eyes and Gideon's sad face and dead are we going to go to jail and I said I said one time and this was a real lesson for me that I had not been teaching my kids right I said kids okay kids why do you wear seat belts why do you wear seat belts so we don't get caught by the police is what they said and I realized I was a failure as a parent if I teach him the word of God that way I'm doing wrong why do we follow the word God because we don't get caught no no no no no I didn't teach you that it's not so we get caught go to jail that's not it it's to protect us it's for safety idiot this can be these can be tense situations and if not you're the cop life offers some tense situation where everybody is starting to get really close to blowing a fuse Lord make us manifest the Divine love of God of Jesus to settle down grab some discernment from the Lord and react the decision is up to that policeman and he decides not to give Bob a ticket because Bob when he looked at it Bob has a perfect driving record he has used the cop has used his discretion in it all he's looking at the whole thing and he chooses to give him a warning because he looked at his record and this is the first time he's had this so he's not weighing just I'm mad at him I'm going to give him the ticket no he's weighing the whole picture isn't that what Jesus did when the woman was caught in adultery I said isn't that what he did so there's a bit of a glory in that there's a cop holding his authority but all the more with sons and daughters of God who has Christ in them we realize that we must act in our Authority with discretion now that's a foundation to finish up these two points today and to break down these other two manifestations of divine love is everybody ready everybody got this scripture and I spent the last uh hour on the discretion of a man defareth his anger the discernment the caution of a man in every situation will defer his anger that's not the default thing that he acts with is anger something triggers him and he just reacts with anger that's not the glory of the that's not the right glory and and it is his glory to pass over a transgression he's not keeping records of wrong so this next point of divine love is love is not easily provoked to anger Ecclesiastes 7 9 says be not Hasty in thy Spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of force in this version of cab the same scripture says don't be quick to get angry for Only Fools nurse anger so that's that's a further interpretation if you have something in the bosom of foods fools it actually goes back to a woman who has a baby in her bosom and she's going to feed that and nurse that baby and she holds it she protects it she nurses it and do you know that you got somebody nursing like a baby nursing their anger and holding it close to them their whole life no wonder if they're nursing their anger they're coddling their anger they're protecting their anger and they're holding it there instead of doing what Brother Kyle said a few ways a night you got to let it go real simple message you just got to let it go you got to let things go but this guy's not letting us go he's actually coddling and holding and nursing his anger holding it close to him for Life he's not letting go at all don't be quick to angry because if you're nursing only the full nurse is anger and if if you're quick to anger all it's going to do is keep festering and keep festering and nurse the anger further it has to come an end to your anger brothers and sisters listen to me we're always going to have the emotion of anger but if you're nursing it for life you'll see destruction in your path and you don't even recognize it because you have old anger and you're nursing it and anybody who tees you off just with one thing it brings back all the past memories and you're quick the reason you're quick to get angry is you're nursing your anger wow amen James 1 says wherefore my beloved brother let every man be swift to hear we need to be more listeners than talkers be swift here be more willing to listen than just react quickly Swift to hear slow to speak slow to anger slow to Wrath why because the wrath of man not God now because Ami knows God has a Wrath yes it's a holy wrath but the wrath of man will never work the righteousness of God and that's a good reason not to nurse your anger anymore too it will never produce the righteousness of God well I'm a Christian I've been in the message for 20 years I've been messaged for 50 years I'm I'm a Believer I believe this I believe the message I believe the end times I believe all these things I go to a message church but if you're nursing your anger your whole life you've got a whole track record of all kinds of things going on and you can't it can't work the righteousness of God it can't it never brings the fruit of that any further you're stuck right there with your anger at your bosom you still love me get to an altar lay down your anger before the Lord Lord let me die and let me hand back this anger to you Lord that's what he says cast all your cares everything on him Lord I've got to die to this now I'm 50 years old I'm 40 years old I'm five years old it's best to get rid of that anger now and release it to the Lord now can you say Amen give it back to God so so this is after that the prophet is saying we should live a life to the world they can tell when it's real that we live a real Christian Life okay and this is somebody responding saying if I'm ever a Christian so it's something the world says if I ever become a Christian I want to be like that man or that woman so they're looking at our lives so that's the way they'll be if I ever do I see something in them that's different it's a change they act different than the world they react different to situations how many want to say that's how I want the world to see my life but when you're when you blow off and you cuss and you're reacting all the same way as any other employer or any other person did when you're boiling with this anger and doing it you're not acting much different than their last boss and yet you're claiming Christianity if I ever was a Christian I'd want to be like that man or the wonderful they have love joy peace long-suffering goodness gentleness patience meekness and so forth the nine fruits of the spirit dwells within them they're not easily provoked you can't make them mad at you laughs oh it's so quiet in here it's so quiet somebody give me a pin and I'm gonna drop it it's gonna be they're not easily provoked you can't make them mad at you they will not become angry they're so loving that in their very presence you feel Christ help me Lord I'm looking at that image Lord I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be but I'm not the image of what I should be until I die to myself and lay my anger this uh not easily provoked to anger there are regular irritations in life are we going to give me just a little more time this morning there are regular irritations in life that that cause it's not just somebody being angry at you there are things that trigger us trigger us and they make us irritated at something okay and so we of course our our goal and our spirit should say Lord I want to get to this place that I'm even the regular irritations in life that we're more patient with it that we're more more restful with it and not to react and I encourage people pre-marital counseling um if you want to go through it with the the leadership here uh before you get married I encourage it and it's it's not ever to discourage somebody falling in love it's so that you research a little bit of your life and your spirit and your heart and the girls and you research it together in a very nice way but you're trying to see if there's any triggers in your life that that mate might not realize that they're stepping on something and they irritate it and you have unresolved anger unresolved triggers there because now if you get in marriage and that spouse does not know what your past is then they're going to trigger and step on your pain and there's going to be a reaction and your spouse is going why in the world did you react that extreme because you really didn't lay your triggers and lay your pain before the Lord you didn't really discover it I love for young people to start laying these things before God now what's in me Lord that needs to come out Lord you're not going to get everything but at least you're working at it and the reason the one reason I tell couples to do it is because the devil has less grounds to try to divide your Oneness in your mercies he's got less grounds to be on if you're aware of what triggers one another if you're aware of it it's half the half the battle right so there's regular irritations I mean we we had it we went out for a few days and at the airport on Sunday night it was like there was this couple and there were a Nigerian couple brother Michael and they had their baby with them in a stroller and we're going through security and they're going to Nigeria obviously and I found that out later and I think they had half of their house they were taking with them through the security they had everything with them and I don't know what they checked in but this was half their house here and the stroller was huge and somehow we got behind them and I realized I'm getting a little irritated because we're running a little late and it's like okay we need to get through security you know even if I'm not running late uh Securities irritate me anyway might as well admit it foreign went with me to the Philippines and I I hope I want I think he had a wonderful trip but his biggest struggle was being with me in the airport I don't know if he'll ever go back with me again you could go with some other missionary but we were in in irritation yeah it was I mean we come back to Hong Kong from the Philippines and realize my flight going back home was 12 hours later than what we expected so we had to spend 12 hours in the Hong Kong airport and it was overnight so we couldn't go uh to Hong Kong Disney or we couldn't go any of that it was the night time and we couldn't go out so we had to spend the entire night in the airport so you know this and he could fill my tenseness and it's just like wow I didn't want to spend 12 hours in the Hong Kong airport and so then to make a long short we made it I went to that was the first McDonald's I had seen so I satisfied myself at McDonald's for a few hours and then uh we found a place that you could sleep for a while like they had some beds you could rent them and we slept so it ended up working out but anyway he got an idea so I get tents in airports anyway I get tents since we're all I'm just given all my confessions to you this morning I'll continue and then I'll let my wife up to give about 50 more drive-throughs drive me through the wall drive-throughs aren't drive-throughs they drive me crazy so anyway this nice couple and they weren't nice at that time because they were they had everything and then the guy the security guard had to get that stroller through the machine you couldn't just drive it through the scanner it had to fit and they were crunching and I know they spent 20 minutes trying to Crunch this thing down and push it through the machine it's like just drive it through just leave it here buy one in Africa don't take any huge bags and just and stuffing this stuff through that scanner and it took forever and then as I come to the other side and it's taken us about a good over a half hour I would it seemed like I'm reminded of what I was preaching that Sunday morning by the Lord usually that reminder comes from my wife but this came from the Lord and I wasn't even on this subject yet it's just all this subject of divine love and I'll tell you I have been tested in my home life domestic life family I have been tested to the very core Myself by these if this series isn't for anybody else it's for me to look at my life and say Lord I'm struggling but I want this more excellent way I Gotta Have It and so then we come through the other side and I start I said all right because of what I preached this morning I'm going to start talking to this couple ask where they're going going three months Nigeria ah we got Nigerian people in our church and I asked if they knew your names and I was just hi I connected I connected and I found them to be the nicest couple both of them so nice cute baby I changed my whole attitude towards those people and they were very open they started talking I started to talk about the church and and they lived close enough and I got I got the new card out and the people that I was so irritated at a hand of card and invited him to church he says we'll get home we're going to come and visit now if I'd have stayed in my former attitude do you think they'd come and hear me preach I destroyed it I didn't even get a chance to preach anything to him yet and I destroyed the chances why why because my first discernment wasn't good of the situation and I was irritated so that's normal irritations but what about what about when what about when a pastor gets going so you don't preach all day what about what this provoking means the Greek word for provoke means to sharpen to stimulate to Rouse to anger that's that provoking pushing another's buttons okay and this is love is not easily easily provoked to anger but that's what it does sharp and stimulate Rouse to anger the Phillips Bible paraphrases this love it is not touchy love does not have a hair trigger temper some people make everyone around them walk on eggshells because they're always their feelings are on their shoulders and they don't know how to act because they walk to eggshells because because maybe it's you you keep everyone in eggshells because you're you're touchy and you're you're just you could blow up at any time it is not touchy love does not have a hair triggered temper some people make everyone around them walk on eggshells they're easily offended one little thing that doesn't go their way and kaboom and they use their temper to intimidate and to punish now there's there's something to preach about they actually use their anger as a weapon to intimidate to push back to punish someone to get back at them and when you confront them many times they say sure I have a bad temper but a lot of people has problems I know I got that temper but you know what at least I just get it all out and it's over in a few minutes you know what that's like that's like a bomb it's like a bomb I just get it out there and you're actually Justified and it's over a few that's a bomb you drop a bomb and it's over in a few minutes but look at the devastation it leaves behind you think it's over you went back to work or you went back to your bedroom and you went back to kaboom explosion it's over I said it I said my piece it's done it's not over because you drop the bomb and look at all the devastation from the bomb when you're angry usually you're not loving the King James version these are the scriptures I've given to you be not Hasty in thy Spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools let me move real quickly now to the next point and this quote wasn't finished I guess okay there there you are that's what the church needs not because you could argue your religious standpoint that doesn't mean it's your life that proves what you are amen everybody's still with me one more Point love does not keep a record of others wrongs love does not keep a record of others wrongs and the scripture says love thinketh no evil so it's it's tied to our thinking love does not keep a record of others wrongs it thinketh no evil so it's tied to our thoughts a lot of times we're not keeping a record of others wrongs in a in a log somewhere or in QuickBooks but we're keeping it in our thinking that's why you it think of Love thinketh no evil because it's this thought process as you look at that person and you've got the log in your mind and so you're looking you're thinking evil thoughts of of them instead of positive thoughts instead of right thoughts you're thinking already and you're standing there talking trying to be polite if you're been doing that and you're shaking their hand God bless you and you're you give a cold handshake you know because you've seen him from across the room and you think you're you're thinking you've got the whole record going over of what Dan has done wrong to you and his life and what he's done wrong to everybody and you're thinking all that through so now you give him the cold shoulder but it's all in your thoughts you keep it a record in your thoughts this is our text the discretion of man defer this anger and His glory is a Passover transgression first Peter 48 when above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins it doesn't keep record Divine love but it actually actually releases the record of somebody and it forgives can you say Amen so it's in the thinking really that we hold this account now this word when it talks about accounting it thinketh no evil and it's tied to the Greek here that's why we get the conclusion love does not keep a record of others wrong this is a counting word it's used of numerical calculation it is used the same word in the Greek is used of God that does not impute our guilt to us he does not impute sin to us which means he doesn't he he doesn't keep it on our account he releases it from our account but instead of imputing the righteousness of Christ to instead God imputes the righteousness of Christ to our account and does not impute our guilt or our sin Romans 4 6-8 that's what it says so love doesn't keep a tally of wrongs and bear a grudge until everyone has has it paid for can I get an amen love does not keep a tally of wrongs and bear a grudge until everyone is paid for it doesn't try to gain the upper hand by reminding the other person of the past wrongs love forgives can you say Amen love forgives and it tries to even forget it's that's harder but for sure love forgives love forgives love forgives love love doesn't keep a record of others wrong how much do we do that how much record are we keeping of another person's wrong you know we are taught so hard to keep records in in the world we live in if you're in business you got to keep Good Records or you're going to have bad business you keep receipts I uh my secretaries pull their hair out because I'm not good at I keep the receipt but I can't remember where it is and if I remember where it is I don't know remember what expense it's for and so now I'm really bad at that but we're in if we keep good business we've got to keep records of things so we're in it and some people are good at keeping Good Records financially some people are not but some people are good accountants some are not but now I'm looking at a live keeping records of people's wrongs that they do us in our lives and and so we're taught accounting be have a good accountant if you're going to have a business you got to have a good account at keeping up with those things how many know that's true and uh maybe you have some program like QuickBooks and you keep up with all the expenses and all that goes out all that comes in and those things help you uh to keep good books but you know brother Brown says that God keeps good books too let me know God keeps good books God is the perfect accountant God has the perfect QuickBooks and brother Brown refers to your giving he says the littlest giving he even said now when you you when you send money money and you give money and you send me overseas he said you'll get credit to that God keeps good books too he said you'll get credit because you sent me over there to preach the gospel and souls got saved and that will be credited to your account for that Soul being saved for you given to missions and he says God keeps good books too can you say Amen so God's the perfect accountant every little act will will not be forgotten can you say Amen every little thing that the whole world didn't see but you did somehow some selfish act you gave and you did something and God is the perfect accountant and how many believe God keeps perfect records except for one thing our sin this is why he's a perfect accountant too except for our sin in God's Great Quick Books perfect QuickBooks God can go over and take all the things that we've done wrong and click on it and scroll down the whole list of our whole life and he Scrolls down and Scrolls down he Shades it all what do they call that shading it or clicking on it he Scrolls down Scrolls down Scrolls down gets to the very end of all your stuff in QuickBooks that you did wrong he's got it all blocked shaded and then he reaches over and he clicks the delete button somebody shout praise the Lord he clicks delete and you know how that happens with you even when you accidentally do it it's gone it's in Oblivion you can't find it and all your sin was cast in the sea of forgetfulness and God cannot remember it no more he deletes it he deletes it we understand justification just as if you never did in the place first place God I'm sorry I keep asking apology for that God I'm sorry I'm sorry and God's looking it up in his QuickBooks and he can't find it because he deleted it when he went to Calvary he deleted all of it he can't find that account Jesus dropped the charges can you say Amen Jesus dropped the charges and it's all gone and so I'm telling you this now to to just get it across as I'm closing to say in this point here if we're in this glory of God and in this Kingdom that it is that we don't our God does not keep a record of wrong if he says when you're praying oh God this sin he says what sin it's like he lets you start from scratch can you say Amen you're reminding him because the devil remind you of something back there but it's under the blood and he can't remember it can you say amen and that is that if something new has happened then we ask forgiveness but don't attach it to all the past things because God cannot remember anymore if God is this way why don't we have a delete button on the things people have done wrong to us because they didn't apologize or you're going to live bound your whole life because they may not ever apologize but you can find the glory of the Lord to forgive say for me that's between them and God I'm a free man I'm a free woman my forgiveness never gives up it's been some questions about boundaries with that and there certainly are boundaries we don't let someone to continue to just abuse us but that doesn't have to do with forgiveness forgiveness is in our heart 70 times 7 Jesus says blew the disciples mind away or what are you talking about 70 times 7 because forgiveness doesn't give up we continue to forgive and yet there's boundaries sometimes to realize that person can't continue to abuse but we can continue to forgive we're taught so much to keep records and look what brother Bram says here love covers a multitude of sin I'm bringing it down to a close if I don't see some of you no more remember this that's my theme is love covers it all I believe in the redeeming love of the Lord Jesus listen just a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just to be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church you see you see my vision not at all I want I want the spiritual gifts working there but he's showing the more excellent way I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in my church now that might seem sound hard in a Pentecostal group interesting but I would rather have it where there's gifts they'll fail whether it's gifts they'll be they'll bring confusion where there's gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts let me say that's powerful amen I think there's nothing greater than love and love if we can't express it now we can say that we have love we're just saying that but when we can really Express what we've said that we have then we show it in ourselves and now we're not a perfect people we make our mistakes we do things that's wrong but you see love covers all of that we're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another yeah that's Warriors that is really men and women that's Gallant love covers a multitude of sins can you say Amen praise the Lord and so this glory of God moves in man and in woman and it makes them cover a multitude of sins in others sons of God under the power of redemption and this open book will come to levels of forgiveness never seen before in men I'm making some closing statements here and hopefully it'll just it'll seal things up how many want more of the love of God at least more of it manifesting in our lives this sons of God under the power of redemption and this open book in the last days will come to new levels I could say new levels of gifts new levels of prophesying that's fine I'm not saying that I believe this open book will bring new levels because we know our position as Sons will bring new levels of forgiveness never seen before in men it makes us Revelations 5 he said as they worship makes us Kings and Priests how many know the Bible says and he hath made us Kings and Priests looking in this book of redemption that's been opened makes us Kings and Priests not just Christians Kings and Priests what does that mean that means that were as kings in worship we have authority as kings King means you have authority but we also have an understanding of Grace to intercede and feel the pain of others because that's what a priest does he intercedes he feels the pain of others because he's been through it before so not only we have the authority as kings but we have the priesthood to understand and give Grace and intercede for someone because we know it would have a discernment what they're going through I have one more scripture in Hebrews 5 1-4 and I want you to read it so touched me this morning as I pulled it up Hebrews 5 talking about this priesthood for every priest I don't know if you guys want to pull it up there for every priest Hebrews 5 if you give me two minutes I'll be done are you getting anything out of this this morning this is a lot to chew on but we'll take it it's Eagle food can you say amen for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god notice how he words that now every priest he's talking about Old Testament priesthood but every priest this is the purpose of a priest every priest is taking from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God so he is the goal between between God and Men he's taken from men he's ordained four men can you say Amen in things pertaining to God so horizontally it's coming from other men and then vertically he has he has a uh he has a how should I say it he's got he's attached to God or he has access to God the priest has access to God to bring the right sacrifices and but yet he's been in tune with man because he's a man himself so he's this in between priests and so now he says who he says things that pertain to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity this is a great priest can you say amen and this priest can have compassion on others and on ignorant men and those that are out of the way listen we come in contact every day with people that are out of the way we have people in this assembly that are out of the way they're they're they're not what they should be yet but you see a high priest he doesn't judge that he says Lord I'm going to get a hold of you I'm going to stand because I've been out of the way I can understand what it is to be weak and not be strong and so I'm going to be a faithful high priest here can you say Amen this book makes us priests with compassion on the ignorant see we the world says you're ignorant you should know better than that and so we get angry at the ignorant but this priest says I can understand what a person is ignorant of what they're doing because I've been there and brother Branham came to that at the end of his life when he says I had to quit criticizing I was saying you rickettas and you Ricky's out there and he says God corrected me on that my attitude was wrong he says some of those are souls that would give their hearts to God if they only knew the way back to God you can't stand there and criticize somebody who's never heard truth before when you go out there you don't know if they've heard the truth she's she's bobbed her hair she's wearing britches like a man she's got tattoos all of herself and so now you put them in hell because you can't do that because if they haven't heard the truth if they don't know the Bible truth on it you can't accuse them they are ignorant and so I can have compassion I can stand in the Gap see that's our problem in the ranks of the message is that predestination becomes prejudiced go ahead Oh I thought I was done I thought I was done preaching but I'm not done here for a minute our teaching on predestining is the greatest teaching that's ever come back to the church but in some ranks our predestination gets so proud that it becomes prejudiced that we choose what group everybody is in serpent seed foolish virgin wise virgin no Holy Ghost Holy Ghost and we start to choose and we become selective we become selective and we become exclusive we have a monopoly on the truth only those who come from through us and we become prejudiced now Prejudice is a problem it's in this country people still fight against it if you go to a junior high you're going to have Prejudice they're going to make fun of you for you know your ears or whatever's you know weird they think you're gonna get made fun of prejudice but now we shouldn't let Prejudice come in our ranks that we're actually prejudiced against denominational people Prejudice means I am in a higher class I'm of a better race you're below us where did we get that out of our great teachings we don't have a right to judge anybody if you don't know because if they're ignorant this kingship and priesthood comes to the place it says I can have compassion on somebody who's ignorant I can speak the same words from my life that Jesus spoke from the father from the cross that said this cross he said forgive them Father because they're ignorant they don't know what they're doing right now so forgiveness didn't hold back and say say look at the tragedy they're doing they're putting me on a cross but they didn't know what they were doing right so forgiveness was not held back from somebody it was released to those people at the cross that were putting their Roman soldiers Jews everybody standing around the cross the most tragic event in history and forgiveness was released to those people even the other man on the cross somebody brought out car somebody brought out so wonderful we have all their things people need to go through before we accept them and he just said Lord remember me when I cut when you come into your kingdom that's all he said didn't get baptized and forgiveness was released to him at that moment we don't have a right to withhold forgiveness from anybody priesthood and Kings is what this book of redemption oh I've heard ministers that can elaborate on the book of redemption and the opening of the seals I if you're a preacher some of these ministers can break it down It's So Glorious and what God has done I love it I absolutely love it but let me remind you each one if I don't see the fruits of it making you a king and a priest something's missing in what you see in this book of redemption if it makes you prejudice you got the wrong result because that's not the glory of the Lord the son of God a Son of God has Authority to have compassion on the ignorant on them that are out of the way for he for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason thereof he ought ask for the people so also for himself to offer for sin and no man taketh this honor unto himself you didn't give it to yourself but he that is called of God as was Aaron and I can tell you you are called of God as Sons and Daughters of God you have a calling from this book and he is making us Kings in rulership with the authority like a policeman but with the compassion to defer your anger until you know the whole situation and to cover a multitude of sins Sons and Daughters of God are holding the token they're carrying the atonement with them and the atonement is forgiveness of sins it's a washing away of sins if you're carrying the token then you can have Graces the prophet said in the token message he says he said when you go to apply the token how many believe in applying the token you get this Holy Ghost token it's the atonement to wash away the sin in your life to clean your home up with all the trash he said the dirty magazines the dirty television all these other things you applied the token and you know for years people said apply the token kick this out kick out the short skirts kick this out apply the Holy Ghost to your home like Moses did he applied the blood to his house that's what we're doing right now apply it before the death angel comes these are all real things friends you got to get the token you got to apply it apply it kick this out kick that out and they forgot to read just a about a page later when he says now when you go to apply it apply it with such love people forgot to read that part because when they went to apply it they applied it like a tyrant what are you doing honey I'm applying that talking around here forgot to read just a few pages later when he says no when you go to that wife and that family and you apply it to your family members he said apply it with such love that shall see the results boy how many homes for the last 60 years have applied it the wrong way without love and the children grow to hate the very precious stones and precious message and token because it wasn't they resisted the token or the message they resisted the way it was applied can you see my vision as a pastor can you see where I'm going can you see the pastures that I want you all to feed on right now as sheep let's stay right here and say Lord deal with me change me burn out the selfishness and pride and irritability and impatience and keeping records of people's wrongs if God has a sea of forgiveness why don't you have a sea of forgetfulness this week create one of your own God has one say God I'm going to pray now and I'm going to have my own sea of forgiveness and I'm going to take the record of what I have of people have done me wrong and I'm going to take it and I'm going to gather it up and then this sea of forgiveness I'm going to throw this in my sea of forgiveness because Lord you had one for me you can't even remember my sin anymore you kept no record of it you can't remember it anymore now I'm going to have a sea of forgiveness for people who have done me wrong and I'm going to cast it into this sea and I'm going to go on living life in Victory I'm preaching Victory to you whether you believe it or not there's some victories in this there's some levels in this forgiveness if you come my way in the Lord's way you're going to get some you're going

like to keep a record of somebody else's wrongs know what it's like to be irritated at someone else's transgressions all of us if we're in this life have to experience these things it's not that we won't experience it but it's how we give back what we give back to it what we respond to it and I want so much for my response to be right it'll take his grace it'll take me knowing Lord how much you've forgiven me and how your flood of forgiveness is flooded in my life each time I come to you Lord you wash it away you forgive me the bible promises he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins if we would ask I want to be that way with other people Lord I want to let the Forgiveness flow as a fountain flowing from my life Forgive Me Lord for not being forgiving forgive me for holding grudges and Wrongs against fathers and mothers and family members and church members whoever it is Lord it doesn't matter that person deserves respect and they deserve the love and forgiveness of God so we're sorry lord of the things that we make it our levels of forgiveness but Lord may we not limit it you have made us Kings and Priests you have made us Kings and Priests you are molding a people of rulers that will rule and reign in the Millennium and your emoting priests that can be touched by the feeling of the infirmities of the people because we can have compassion because we too have had infirmity help us to have that compassion Lord as the scripture says let our speech be seasoned Lord with the salt of Grace when we speak let it be seasoned with Grace forgive us father we give our lives to you strengthen Us by this word Lord may it put spiritual meat on our bones as it were make us loving Christians I pray committed to you and all these things Lord all these attributes we lay
