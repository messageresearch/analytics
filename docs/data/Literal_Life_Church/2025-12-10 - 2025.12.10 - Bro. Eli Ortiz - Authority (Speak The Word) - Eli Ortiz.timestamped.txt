[29:37] surely indeed
[29:40] it's a pleasure to be here tonight and
[29:42] our heart rejoices, Father, as we come
[29:46] together in one mind, in one accord
[29:49] to just praise you and worship you for

[30:01] protection.
[30:03] Father, uh uh your blessings.
[30:08] Father, I don't know what we can do,
[30:10] what would we do without you, Father,
[30:12] because tonight I need you, Lord. We
[30:15] need you.
[30:17] And we want you to speak to our hearts
[30:18] tonight, Father. You know what we each
[30:20] one of us have need, Father. And I know

[31:02] blessing.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Father, we ask you tonight that you can
[31:06] make yourself more real to us tonight
[31:09] &gt;&gt; than before. Father, because that is
[31:11] what we want. We want to serve you. We
[31:14] want to love you.
[31:16] And that is how hard this are tonight
[31:19] that you come and take your rightful
[31:22] place in our heart and throw yourself
[31:25] there father that is your rightful
[31:27] place.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; So we give it to you in Jesus name we
[31:30] pray. Amen. Before we sit there let's
[31:33] read
[31:34] uh Matthew 8 chapter 8 verse 5-10.
[31:56] Try to hide this toolbar. Come on. Hide.
[32:04] Okay.
[32:05] So, are you there now? Amen. Oh, yeah.
[32:08] You You got it. And when Jesus was
[32:11] entered into Capernium,
[32:13] there came unto him a centurion bish him
[32:17] and saying, Lord, my servant lies some
[32:20] sick of the policy grievously tormented.
[32:26] And Jesus said unto him, I will come and
[32:28] I heal him. Wow. No hesitations, huh?
[32:33] &gt;&gt; We should respondse that way when people
[32:35] come to us and said, I want you to pray
[32:37] for my family. I want you. He said sure
[32:40] come.
[32:42] So he says
[32:44] for I am a man under authority. I'm
[32:47] sorry. The centurion answer and said
[32:49] Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest
[32:52] come under my roof. So what did he ask
[32:55] him? He said you know if he feels that
[32:58] way sometime but that is a man humbling
[33:01] himself because he knew the Jewish
[33:03] customs.
[33:05] So he said, "For I am under uh under my
[33:08] roof, but speak the word only." And
[33:11] that's what we want tonight. We want the
[33:13] word.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; That's why we come
[33:17] &gt;&gt; because the word is is our life.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; It is more than life to us.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Says, "And my servant shall be healed,
[33:26] for I am a man under authority, having
[33:28] soldiers under me. And I say to this
[33:31] man, "Go." And he goes, "And another
[33:34] one, come." And he comes, and my
[33:36] servant, and to my servant, "Do this."
[33:39] And he do it. When Jesus heard heard it,
[33:42] he marvel and said to them that follow,
[33:46] "Burely, I said unto you, I have not
[33:49] found so great faith, not not in
[33:52] Israel."
[33:54] So I'm not going to speak about faith.
[33:56] I'm glad that brother, your pastor, took
[34:00] care of that, you know, Sunday.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just piggy back on his sermon.
[34:08] And I didn't know that until, you know,
[34:10] I have my sermon already ready by
[34:12] Saturday, last Saturday. So, uh, this
[34:15] house God work, God synchronizes thing.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; It's not man's, but God can, Holy Spirit
[34:21] can work in this church same way he can
[34:23] work in our church. and we'll
[34:25] synchronize. He synchronized everything
[34:27] that we have need. So
[34:30] I'm glad that a sermon that we heard
[34:32] about faith is needed tonight as well.
[34:35] So you can be seated. Thank you.
[34:42] I want to concentrate on
[34:45] the subtopic maybe authority.
[34:50] Have authority.
[34:52] The centriion says, "I know about
[34:54] authority. I have it."
[34:57] See, he was in a position of
[34:59] responsibility,
[35:01] a position that was given to him and he
[35:04] had authority. They gave him authority
[35:06] to do that kind of a job. See,
[35:09] just like brother Brandon said about the
[35:10] policeman, he has no he cannot stop the
[35:14] traffic. He has no power to do anything,
[35:16] but he has authority of the city to put
[35:18] him in that position
[35:19] &gt;&gt; and he knows that.
[35:22] So he don't doubt it.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; When he stopped somebody, they better
[35:26] stop.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; So
[35:31] speaking the word, he says, "Speak the
[35:32] word only."
[35:35] So in Luke 4:36,
[35:38] we're going to do like a Bible study. I
[35:40] like Wednesday because Wednesday is uh
[35:42] more
[35:44] &gt;&gt; small and cozy and
[35:46] &gt;&gt; we don't have to hear me screaming and
[35:48] yelling.
[35:52] So I promise I will not preach. Let's
[35:55] have a Bible study
[35:57] and well I promise that but I want to be
[35:59] able to. Okay. And they were amazed in
[36:02] Luke 4:36. Jesus he was speaking again
[36:06] among themselves saying what a word is
[36:08] this.
[36:10] See I guess you and I will know what's
[36:12] the difference between the word of God
[36:14] and the word that is not God. Because
[36:17] the word of God will be always
[36:19] vindicated.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; My word will not be vindicated, but his
[36:24] word will never fail. And whatever it
[36:27] goes out to to do, it will do. It will
[36:29] not come back in vain.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; See, and that's the difference between
[36:33] my word of a man and his word.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; He cannot fail. It cannot lie.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; It says,
[36:42] "What word is this? For we with
[36:45] authority and power he commanded the
[36:49] unclean spirits and they come out
[36:53] &gt;&gt; power and and and authority.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; So
[36:59] in Luke 9:1 says then he called his 12
[37:02] disciples together and gave them power
[37:05] and authority. So he didn't stay with
[37:07] Jesus.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to pay attention.
[37:10] See, he said he gave power and authority
[37:13] over the devil and all the diseases to
[37:16] cure.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And I looked about authority.
[37:25] Authority. The word is exosia I think is
[37:29] a pronounce it right. To delegate power.
[37:33] So Jesus had delegated power. Rights and
[37:36] all the rights that come with that
[37:38] power.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. and all the privilege
[37:41] to exercise divine power. power in the
[37:45] Greek is damus dunamis and that is the
[37:48] word that come if I I'm not pronouncing
[37:50] it right in Greek but that is a word
[37:53] that the word dynamite come from
[37:57] &gt;&gt; because dynamite has power
[38:01] &gt;&gt; believe me don't try it at home it has
[38:03] power
[38:05] &gt;&gt; don't try to prove it
[38:08] so
[38:09] the ability to carry out what the
[38:11] authority permits
[38:15] So not only in authority but that word
[38:20] goes out in power.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Empower. So you know sometimes
[38:27] you graduate from college you know and
[38:29] they give you diploma. What the diploma
[38:31] says with all the authorities and
[38:33] privilege and responsibility we bestow
[38:35] and blah blah blah. So you have invested
[38:39] &gt;&gt; you know to go and delegate you to have
[38:42] this power and go and do
[38:44] &gt;&gt; what they have taught you to do
[38:46] &gt;&gt; or what you study the same thing you
[38:49] know we we progress.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; We are here and we come to church and we
[38:54] and we mature
[38:57] you know until we come to the perfection
[39:00] the maturity. So as we progress
[39:04] you get more power. Yeah,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; you can delegated more power and when
[39:09] you graduate one of these days, well,
[39:11] you will have full power because that's
[39:14] where we want to go. And the full power
[39:17] is the spoken word.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; But we start slowly just like going to
[39:21] school training. Church is a training
[39:24] place.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; But the last the the the goal is so you
[39:29] come to perfect maturity.
[39:34] So you will be bested
[39:37] you know and have the authority and the
[39:39] power
[39:40] &gt;&gt; yes
[39:40] &gt;&gt; to speak the word of God.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; I mean if not that then how can we carry
[39:47] out what Jesus says
[39:48] &gt;&gt; you will do the same work greater work
[39:51] unless we are vested
[39:53] &gt;&gt; and have the authority and the
[39:54] responsibilities that's come with it
[39:55] too. So in John 14:12, verily, verily I
[39:59] said unto you, that he that believe on
[40:02] me,
[40:05] &gt;&gt; the works that I do shall he do also,
[40:08] &gt;&gt; and greater work than this shall he do
[40:12] because I go to the father.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; So now he didn't left it with the with
[40:18] the uh disciples. See,
[40:21] &gt;&gt; now it comes forward is on us as well.
[40:25] That's right.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Because we believe says
[40:29] Matthew 21:21 says, "Jesus answered and
[40:31] said unto them, verily I said unto you,
[40:33] if you have faith and doubt not, you
[40:36] shall not only do this which is done to
[40:38] the fig tree, but also if you shall say
[40:41] unto this mountain be removed, and be
[40:44] thou cast in the city, it shall be
[40:46] done."
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:51] So what I'm saying is the power has come
[40:54] down to the disciple but instead in the
[40:57] day of Pentecost that power is available
[41:00] today to us as well because while we
[41:02] believe
[41:06] &gt;&gt; however here in Proverbs 8:21 says
[41:10] death and life are on the power of the
[41:13] tongue.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Wow dynamite.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. uh and they that love
[41:20] shall eat the fruit therefore.
[41:23] So we know that brother Brown told us
[41:26] power without character is what?
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Evil wicked.
[41:32] So the responsibility is that at the
[41:34] same time that you are being given power
[41:37] you have to have character that goes
[41:38] along with the power.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Without power we cannot handle
[41:43] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[41:45] &gt;&gt; true. So there's a responsibility that
[41:47] goes with this. So the whole journey is
[41:50] to learn is to have the character of
[41:52] God. We are shaped and formed to his
[41:55] character. That's
[41:56] &gt;&gt; right.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; For the only reason that we can handle
[41:59] his word.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Without his character, we cannot handle.
[42:02] We make a mess
[42:03] &gt;&gt; is what it is. So Matthew 21:22 says,
[42:07] "And all things whosoever you you ask in
[42:10] prayer, see believe
[42:12] &gt;&gt; and you believe you shall receive." So I
[42:15] want to bring this one because not only
[42:17] when when we appreciate or when we are
[42:20] you know pray for somebody else but if
[42:24] for also when you pray pray could be
[42:27] could be a vocal voice or sometime we
[42:31] put request unspoken request it doesn't
[42:34] matter spoken voice the thing is that
[42:37] prayer falls in the same category
[42:40] &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to pray for Lazarus when
[42:43] he went to the tomb
[42:45] uh he didn't make a lengthy prayer.
[42:48] Actually, he didn't even kneel or put
[42:50] his hands together. He stood there like
[42:53] he was talking to to God. He was I mean
[42:56] that's what prayer is all about.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; So don't put aside prayer because prayer
[43:01] has the same power.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; I mean it had the same results.
[43:06] So he stood there said, "Father, I know
[43:08] you always hear me,
[43:10] &gt;&gt; but for their sake and that was it,
[43:14] &gt;&gt; man."
[43:16] &gt;&gt; So all I'm saying is that you had to
[43:19] handle prayer just with the same uh uh
[43:24] way that you will handle a a prayer to
[43:27] somebody that is sick. Because when you
[43:30] are praying is something that comes out
[43:31] of your heart. show desire something or
[43:34] you have a burden for something.
[43:37] So it works the same way. You have to
[43:40] have uh the same uh what we call power
[43:44] and you should also as uh we begin in
[43:49] the beginning you have to have authority
[43:52] when will you pray.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; So prayer don't take it lightly.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; It requires the same authority and the
[43:58] same power.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:00] So,
[44:03] so that and I want to use this later on.
[44:06] It it's going to come out back again.
[44:09] So,
[44:12] Luke 11 and4 says, "And he said unto
[44:16] them, when you pray, see,
[44:20] our father which are in heaven, hallowed
[44:22] be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will
[44:26] be done in heaven, so as in he." So they
[44:29] as the they as the the the disciple
[44:31] asked Jesus teach us that they seen his
[44:34] prayer being you know come to pass they
[44:38] wanted to have that kind of a
[44:40] &gt;&gt; you know way in fact when he sent them
[44:42] out they tried to pray for somebody that
[44:45] uh a boy or something that have policy
[44:47] or something like that and they pray
[44:50] they pray and Jesus came and you know
[44:52] they said but they your disciple pray
[44:54] but they haven't been able to
[44:56] &gt;&gt; nothing has happen.
[44:59] So, and then Jesus was said some some
[45:03] some spirit will not come out without
[45:05] fasting. Okay? We have to do a little
[45:08] bit more.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; But the point is that that's why the
[45:12] disciples said, "But teach us how to
[45:14] pray cuz we trying to do it and nothing
[45:16] happens."
[45:18] So he says when you pray,
[45:20] this is what you do. You know, first
[45:24] address your father, honor your father,
[45:26] and then
[45:29] later on
[45:31] that will be done. As in heaven, so as
[45:34] in earth.
[45:36] Few things I want to point right quick.
[45:38] The kingdom of God is in you and me.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the kingdom of God is in
[45:44] your heart.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; So we don't have to be looking too far,
[45:47] &gt;&gt; right? This is not something power
[45:49] that's going to come sh some from the
[45:51] sky
[45:53] &gt;&gt; or something is going to strike you.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; It is right within you sir.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; First thing that Jesus said you don't
[46:01] have to be looking too far is it's right
[46:03] there.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Second he says and it will be done as in
[46:08] heaven so as in earth. So the next thing
[46:11] he's saying, you know, the will of God
[46:14] in heaven, it has to be voice has to
[46:18] have a voice in earth.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; See, that's what he says. The will that
[46:23] is in heaven is the word of God because
[46:26] the will is God's word.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; But that will that is for her being
[46:30] spoken in heaven, it has to be voiced
[46:35] &gt;&gt; in earth.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody has to voice it. Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; So then we have to first know that the
[46:44] kingdom of God is in us. And also we
[46:47] need to understand that when we speak
[46:50] what has already been spoken
[46:54] &gt;&gt; and revealed through a prophet through
[46:57] the Bible,
[46:59] not something different but speaking his
[47:02] word because his word will never fail
[47:05] us. See,
[47:07] &gt;&gt; God cannot fail. So those two things for
[47:10] right now. So Matthew 6 also I remember
[47:14] and I didn't write it there but Matthew
[47:16] 6 talks about a little bit of more
[47:18] prayer a little more extensively
[47:23] or further more. So, and he started
[47:26] talking about people that pray, you
[47:28] know, the hypocrites.
[47:31] They pray, you know, and sometimes they
[47:35] pray also repetition prayers and
[47:39] sometimes they uh elaborated eloquent
[47:44] prayers, you know, and Matthew said, you
[47:47] know, that's not the way to pray,
[47:49] &gt;&gt; right? You know, so he was kind of a
[47:51] getting in the in in in people that they
[47:55] wanted attention sometime. Oh, look at
[47:57] how he pray how good it is. But see,
[48:00] that's not the way Jesus said tell the
[48:04] disciples said you pray and the kingdom
[48:07] of heaven is in your heart.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody had to know what you pray for
[48:11] when you pray. The Bible said, "Ask,
[48:14] knock, seek, and it shall be done unto
[48:16] you." Right.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; So
[48:20] that's why sometimes we have to pray so
[48:23] God to lead us. You know when we want to
[48:26] pray for someone we need to pray God I
[48:29] got a burden.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; See because if you try to do pray for
[48:34] somebody just because you are concerned
[48:38] it might get worse.
[48:40] We don't need a I know we concerned. Oh
[48:43] well, if that brother can continue doing
[48:45] that, he's going to go further than he
[48:47] wants to go. I'm I'm just concerned that
[48:50] okay, but that is not a reason to play a
[48:53] concern. It's good to be concerned, but
[48:56] what I'm saying is when you get to be
[48:58] concerned, get down in your knee first
[49:00] and pray
[49:02] and get hold to God and God might not
[49:05] even send you.
[49:07] My God might have somebody else to do
[49:09] that work. That's why we have to be
[49:11] careful not go on with a concern because
[49:14] thing can get worse. So we pray. Now if
[49:17] God wants to send you and he speak to
[49:19] you then you go
[49:22] then when you speak to the brother or
[49:23] when you or the sister and you start
[49:25] praying the sister's going to know that
[49:27] God sent you because you're going to be
[49:28] saying things that only God knows that
[49:31] is in that sister or brother heart.
[49:35] See, anyway,
[49:39] to speak the word with authority and
[49:42] power. See, we're not talking with a
[49:45] scare tactics. So, a lot of people like
[49:46] to do that, but trying to scare us to
[49:51] believe or but if you don't do this, you
[49:53] you're going to die. They we don't use
[49:56] the scare tactics.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; No, but we got power.
[50:01] But it's not to scare anybody, right?
[50:04] So in Luke 11:1 says again the the the
[50:09] prayer, "Our Father, which are in
[50:10] heaven,
[50:12] here I'm going to start getting into my
[50:13] subject, authority."
[50:16] There's three things that you need
[50:20] before you have authority.
[50:23] Well, at least two things. You need to
[50:26] know your place.
[50:29] And second, you need to know your
[50:31] position.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; When you know your place and your
[50:34] position, then authority will come.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Listen what it says over here. Our
[50:41] Father, which are in heaven,
[50:45] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[50:47] thy will be done.
[50:50] As in heaven, so in earth. Now my
[50:55] father, we are in heaven.
[50:59] Where is heaven?
[51:01] Where in heaven?
[51:04] Where? I'm going to put to you that we
[51:06] talking about heaven in places in Christ
[51:09] Jesus.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going with this.
[51:14] And then
[51:16] the kingdom of God like I said is in
[51:19] your heart. Okay?
[51:22] And the will of God is his word. Right?
[51:26] So let us start from there. heavenly
[51:28] places. Now, Ephesians
[51:31] 3 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God of
[51:36] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
[51:38] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[51:41] in where?
[51:43] In heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[51:49] Okay. So,
[51:52] our five that are in heaven, where in
[51:54] heaven? In heavenly places. That's the
[51:56] place that I'm going to show you that we
[51:59] got to be. Now, Hebrew 11:6, but now
[52:03] they desire
[52:05] a better country. This is Paul talking
[52:08] about Abraham. A better country. See
[52:12] that is in heavenly
[52:15] and heavenly. See the place not only
[52:18] wasn't any any place in Canaan land. It
[52:21] was a heavenly place. So he's Abraham
[52:25] looking for a city
[52:27] &gt;&gt; in a heavenly place.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Where God is not ashamed to be
[52:32] called their gods. See for he had he had
[52:36] we go keep this word in mind. Prepare
[52:40] for them a city.
[52:43] See Abraham was looking for a heavenly
[52:45] resident but not in in the earth. That's
[52:48] right.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; He was looking for a place, a resident
[52:51] in a city that was not, you know, made
[52:53] by mans or flesh. It was by God.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And you and I, that's why we are in this
[52:59] pilgrimage in this sojouring just like
[53:02] Abraham looking for that place. I'm not
[53:05] looking for resident here. I like to get
[53:07] out of here. That's what I like. But
[53:09] because my resident is not here, it's in
[53:11] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; That is our walk.
[53:16] So I want you to keep this in mind. The
[53:18] place that we're talking about is
[53:20] heavenly places, a heavenly resident.
[53:24] And we got here Acts 7 uh five
[53:31] talking about Abraham and he gave him no
[53:33] inheritance. So that mean he never saw
[53:37] never possess it. He says, "But he went
[53:40] looking for it and he never stopped
[53:43] looking for her even though because he
[53:45] couldn't find it, but he knew his face
[53:48] knew and believed that there was a this
[53:50] kind of a city somewhere,
[53:53] not in earth, but in heaven." Now, not
[53:56] so much as he sets foot on this on the
[54:00] land. Yet, he was promised that he would
[54:02] give it to him for possession, but he
[54:06] never possess it.
[54:08] at least not him in the flesh. And did
[54:12] and he se after him when as yet he had
[54:15] no he didn't even had a child yet and
[54:18] now he promised you know a city a
[54:20] heavenly place.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] But we know that's the land that the
[54:31] Jewish possessed, you know, the Exodus,
[54:33] they went to the to the land that God,
[54:36] you know, offered them.
[54:39] That was the rich land.
[54:43] Uh that the Bible says if milk and
[54:46] honey, you know, fluid with milk and
[54:47] honey and everything, the promised land,
[54:50] that was their possession.
[54:52] Now, let me make a little comment here.
[54:55] Just because God give you something,
[54:56] that don't mean that you have to to just
[54:58] sit down and wait for it.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Because in order for them to possess the
[55:03] land, they have to fight.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to sit over
[55:09] here and then the the day of the
[55:11] rapture, you don't now come into my
[55:14] going to have to fight until the end
[55:16] &gt;&gt; for the change of a body because Satan
[55:18] is going to be there all the way.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; You and I have to fight. We have any
[55:24] inheritance but we had not possessed it
[55:28] &gt;&gt; just like they did. They had not
[55:30] possessed it yet. Abraham didn't even
[55:32] saw it
[55:34] &gt;&gt; but he fought for it.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; So you and I also
[55:39] God paid for Jesus came and for his
[55:42] blood he paid for that and we have a
[55:45] deed. We have a deed
[55:47] &gt;&gt; and we can claim it but we we don't have
[55:50] no possession of it yet. But we are
[55:52] going to learn the taste. We are going
[55:54] to possess it.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; The same thing with the Hebrew children.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; So I walk to that city. You know, just
[56:04] like Abraham, he says,
[56:07] "For he looked for a city." Hebrew
[56:10] 11:10, "He looked for a city that which
[56:14] has a foundation."
[56:17] See
[56:19] whose builder and maker was God.
[56:23] See,
[56:25] and we know that this foundation, our
[56:29] foundation, the foundation we're talking
[56:31] about here is the rock. See, because
[56:35] it's the rock of revelation. And that's
[56:37] where the foundations always start with
[56:39] a heavy stable, you know, rock.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And we standing in that rock of
[56:45] revelation. That is our foundation.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; And God is building, building, building.
[56:52] And we are being built in that
[56:54] revelation because we get a revelation
[56:56] from revelation for revelation from
[56:58] glory to glory to glory to glory.
[57:00] Brother Brandon said the thing that we
[57:02] need the most is more revelation. You
[57:04] want to seek something, seek more
[57:06] revelation because that is God word
[57:09] being uh ministered to you and then
[57:13] reflect it
[57:14] &gt;&gt; cuz you know stay just in in the mind
[57:17] goes to the heart. So looking for a city
[57:22] has a foundation. Remember what
[57:25] uh Jesus said you know he will build his
[57:30] church right and in the rock of what
[57:34] revelation
[57:36] his church his body so that is the
[57:39] foundation
[57:42] see and that's revelation and we
[57:44] standing on that rock of revelation
[57:47] Moses stood on that rock amen and we
[57:51] standing on the same rock of revelation
[57:53] ession 2 Peter 2:46
[57:57] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[58:02] disallowing indeed of men but chosen of
[58:05] God and precious talking about Jesus
[58:08] Christ that Jesus Christ was the
[58:11] rejected stone actually Jesus Christ was
[58:14] the cornerstone
[58:16] &gt;&gt; and he became the capstone
[58:19] &gt;&gt; of the building you know the two most
[58:22] important that this in the house is the
[58:24] foundation
[58:25] &gt;&gt; has to be stable not in sinking sand.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; But the second thing more important is
[58:30] the roof.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Because the roof is what crystallize,
[58:35] you know, brings everything together.
[58:37] Without a roof, walls can fall. But the
[58:40] roof is what brings it all together,
[58:44] right?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And that's the same like Jesus. He's the
[58:47] foundation and he's also the capstone
[58:51] that keeps the body stable solid in one
[58:54] piece.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; So this allowing the five says ye also
[59:01] are lively stones. We are lively stones
[59:04] are built all up on the spiritual house.
[59:07] Now I'm going here because Abraham was
[59:10] looking for for a city
[59:14] in the heavenly places, right? Now we
[59:17] talking here that God is building a
[59:19] house. Okay, we live stone a body.
[59:24] You and I, we are live stones.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; I should change my last name to to
[59:30] living stone. You know, Eli living
[59:33] stone. Look, I am a lively stone.
[59:38] Anyway, I built up a an spiritual house.
[59:42] So the same way it is a earthly house,
[59:46] this is an earthly house.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; I do have an spiritual house.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Abraham knew that and he was looking for
[59:53] that house
[59:55] &gt;&gt; because this bad this is not going to
[59:56] make it. This is condemned. This is
[59:59] going to be dissolved. But it doesn't
[1:00:01] matter when I leave this house, I got
[1:00:03] another
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; house. But that is a spiritual house.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham was looking for.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:13] Oh okay.
[1:00:15] So he says are built upon a spiritual
[1:00:18] house and a holy priesthood to offer
[1:00:21] spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God
[1:00:24] in Jesus Christ. Therefore also it is
[1:00:27] contained in the scriptures. Behold I
[1:00:29] lay in Zion.
[1:00:31] You all know you know that Zion is the
[1:00:33] bride.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Did you know that? Amen. Agree disagree.
[1:00:41] And you know where siren is at right in
[1:00:44] Jerusalem at there the middle east the
[1:00:47] chief corner stone elect precious and he
[1:00:50] that believe in him shall not be
[1:00:52] confounded.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; I lay in Zion a cornerstone
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; and we know who is the cornerstone
[1:01:01] already been laid
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; and people trample and you know over
[1:01:05] that you know elect and precious. Now
[1:01:09] James
[1:01:10] 14:2 says
[1:01:12] now he as we're trying to you know shape
[1:01:16] this this this this subject in my father
[1:01:19] house
[1:01:21] are many mansions
[1:01:25] if we were not I would have not told you
[1:01:29] I go to prepare remember I told you
[1:01:31] remember the word what he told Abraham
[1:01:33] I'm going to prepare the same word a
[1:01:37] city a place a heavenly places. Now this
[1:01:41] is the same word prepare.
[1:01:44] He says I will leave you but I'm going
[1:01:48] to go and prepare a place. He told it
[1:01:50] for you.
[1:01:53] Okay. Now keep all this together. He
[1:01:56] says as we're not so I will not tell
[1:01:58] you. I'm going to prepare a place for
[1:02:00] you. So we're talking about the place,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You
[1:02:08] need to be in that place.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're not only speaking
[1:02:13] the word from earthly speaking. This is
[1:02:16] your house. But you have another house.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; But when we speak, we speak words that
[1:02:23] come already spoken in heaven
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; through you. Right?
[1:02:29] I want to show you that there's more
[1:02:32] than one you.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, you went bananas now.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Tell me something. Do you have a
[1:02:42] representation in heaven?
[1:02:46] We bypass the theophony. Do you have a
[1:02:49] representation in heaven that look just
[1:02:50] like you?
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I I'm getting
[1:02:54] ahead of my my knee.
[1:02:57] But
[1:02:58] brother B says when the since we're
[1:03:02] open, okay,
[1:03:05] and you heard a voice and you believe,
[1:03:09] he says, you heard from where?
[1:03:13] You heard from your
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. No, you heard from
[1:03:17] where?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; What? That's you in a spirit form. Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Now there's two of you,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; a flesh one
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; and a spiritual one.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; So when we speak from heaven, we speak
[1:03:33] what? The spiritual one
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; because that's the word that was a part
[1:03:40] of God. In fact, that was a uh a gene of
[1:03:44] God,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; We were in his mind.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Words spoken.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; That is the theophony. a celestial body
[1:03:53] that God now here you go that he went to
[1:03:56] prepare for you. So where he's at you
[1:04:01] will be.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Now remember he says
[1:04:05] he says I'm going to prepare you a place
[1:04:07] so you will be where I am.
[1:04:10] And we are in Christ Jesus in where? In
[1:04:13] heavenly places.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; The problem is some people believe that
[1:04:18] this is when the rapture happened. and
[1:04:21] that's where I'm going to go. No,
[1:04:23] that is already in place waiting for you
[1:04:26] and me.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Just keep that in mind. A minute now. In
[1:04:32] my house is many mansion. So people
[1:04:34] trying to put this in the future, but
[1:04:37] this is happening right now. I heard
[1:04:39] from my theophony. You think that was
[1:04:41] just for that purpose only to bring me
[1:04:43] in? I'm still hearing from my theophony.
[1:04:48] I think we we we have come to well let
[1:04:52] me continue. So that is the place that
[1:04:56] you have a representation
[1:05:00] even you you are in earth. Let's
[1:05:01] continue now position
[1:05:04] that's a place and the position in 1
[1:05:06] Corinthians 15:40 they are also
[1:05:09] celestial bodies
[1:05:12] and they're also what terrestrial bodies
[1:05:16] but the glory of the celestial is one
[1:05:20] and the glory of the terrest of the
[1:05:22] terrestrial
[1:05:24] the human body the f the weak body is
[1:05:28] another
[1:05:30] see it's is a human being, you know,
[1:05:32] like me,
[1:05:34] but we have a celestial body someplace
[1:05:38] else, too. I don't know, brother. I'm
[1:05:40] trying to figure out where you're going
[1:05:41] with this. Just just listen to me. Let
[1:05:43] me get done with this. So,
[1:05:46] so we have a representation.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; we have a celestial body.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. And that is in is in a position
[1:05:55] already in heavenly places in Christ
[1:05:57] Jesus. Okay. Now I know this is
[1:06:00] different from what you have heard but
[1:06:02] that's me different and me lie. Okay.
[1:06:05] Philippians 3:21
[1:06:08] who shall change our bow bodies. This is
[1:06:12] talking about this bound body that that
[1:06:14] is may be fashioned like onto a glorious
[1:06:17] body.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; This body will be changed.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; To a glorious body.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. But what I'm telling you that body
[1:06:25] is already there at least
[1:06:29] the spiritual body the the the the the
[1:06:32] celestial body has an interest in that
[1:06:36] part that is here
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; because remember when the rapture
[1:06:40] happens some are going to come to look
[1:06:42] for bodies
[1:06:44] because they cannot function they they
[1:06:47] are together Adam when God created Adam
[1:06:50] from the dirt you know and then he took
[1:06:52] the the spirit spirit that he created
[1:06:55] and put it in that body. Now he became
[1:06:57] one, right? He became like God, a small
[1:07:01] messiah,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; right? In earth,
[1:07:05] but he was a combination of the
[1:07:07] spiritual that God created first into a
[1:07:12] house that was a terrestrial house.
[1:07:16] Okay? So keep that in mind as we go.
[1:07:19] according to the working whereby is able
[1:07:21] to even subdue all things unto himself.
[1:07:24] Galatians 5:16 says this I said then
[1:07:28] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:07:30] fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:37] Talking about we need to agree
[1:07:41] with what has been said in heaven
[1:07:42] already. See we need to agree
[1:07:46] with the word. Okay. And you are a gene
[1:07:50] of God. You are a word expressed.
[1:07:54] But your theophony, we bypass our
[1:07:57] theophony.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; So where is your theophony sitting at
[1:08:00] right now?
[1:08:02] In heavenly places.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prepare your place. And
[1:08:06] this is the other part of the that
[1:08:07] theophony bypass. Now Christ did not
[1:08:10] bypass his theophony.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:13] He God created a body and put that
[1:08:16] spirit in him. See
[1:08:21] Matthew 18:19.
[1:08:24] I guess you kind of quiet on that one.
[1:08:27] Jesus Christ did not bypasses the
[1:08:28] offony. He came in the body. That's why
[1:08:31] he came not sexually. He came what?
[1:08:35] God created the cell, the sperm and the
[1:08:37] blood and put on the on the egg and put
[1:08:40] it into a body.
[1:08:43] See,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; he didn't came like you and me.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Again, I said unto you, Matthew 18:19, I
[1:08:52] said unto you that if two of you shall
[1:08:55] agree in earth as touching anything that
[1:08:59] they shall ask, it shall done for it
[1:09:02] shall be done for them of my father
[1:09:04] which is in heaven.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; So we had to agree with the word. Yes,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; you need two. If two of you can agree
[1:09:13] today on the Russia, it will happen.
[1:09:16] Brother says that.
[1:09:18] So, but to agree
[1:09:22] the other half to agree with that the
[1:09:25] other half that is in celestial places
[1:09:27] in Christ Jesus, we know that the
[1:09:30] rapture nobody knows the time and the
[1:09:31] day. So to agree on the rapture today,
[1:09:35] it's not going to happen.
[1:09:38] But brother B just was making a a
[1:09:40] statement saying if two can agree if you
[1:09:43] can agree with the word of God that been
[1:09:45] spoken in heaven. Okay.
[1:09:49] John 17 I don't want to confuse you. It
[1:09:51] get clear at the end. These words spoke
[1:09:53] Jesus and lift up his eyes to heaven and
[1:09:57] said father the hour has come. Glorify
[1:10:00] thy son. Thy son also may glorify thee.
[1:10:04] And the glorify and the glory which how
[1:10:07] gave me I have gave I given them that
[1:10:11] they may be one even as we are one.
[1:10:15] Father I will that they also whom thou
[1:10:17] has given me be with me where I am.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; So where he at?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He said I will go to prepare a place for
[1:10:26] you. So you will be where I am. So where
[1:10:29] he's at?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Don't put him too far. See
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; right? when you pray where he's at is in
[1:10:35] heavenly places and we are in heavenly
[1:10:37] places with Christ Jesus.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to to be aware what's the
[1:10:44] thing is here when when when we decide
[1:10:46] to move forward.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; You know with the word of God
[1:10:52] there had to be certain agreement.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. It says
[1:10:57] and gives me says father will I also
[1:11:01] whom they have given me whatever I am
[1:11:04] that they may be behold my glory which
[1:11:07] thou has given me for thou love me
[1:11:09] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:11:11] he said the same glory that I have with
[1:11:13] you before the foundation of the world.
[1:11:16] You know you and I we had the same glory
[1:11:19] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; because we were created you know
[1:11:23] celestial bodies first spirit body see
[1:11:27] Adam if you wouldn't fall we would have
[1:11:29] came just like Jesus
[1:11:32] but because the fall causes the
[1:11:36] separation that we come a different way
[1:11:40] see the way we should have came was a
[1:11:42] spoken word
[1:11:45] you know I winner said, "Honey, see
[1:11:48] because she was the helmmaid. Honey, uh,
[1:11:51] we need to bring the next one." The next
[1:11:54] one, I guess it should be, uh, either
[1:11:58] not Kane. Kane wouldn't come out on that
[1:12:01] way, but Abel would have come out. We
[1:12:03] need to bring the next one and the next
[1:12:05] one and the next one. So, the job of of
[1:12:09] uh, it was to agree when two can agree
[1:12:14] takes two.
[1:12:16] So Adam said, "Let's be the next one."
[1:12:19] And she says, "I agree."
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And it happens, right?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; So the same thing with the church in
[1:12:27] Christ. He's our husband.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And the husband says in heaven, the word
[1:12:32] of God, he's the word.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing that you got to do
[1:12:37] is agree with our husband. And when two
[1:12:40] can agree,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; it happens. Beautiful.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; So sometime we talk we think it's just
[1:12:47] two of us and it's good we me and
[1:12:50] brother can agree but when you can agree
[1:12:54] with the word that been spoken
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; the husband is your word
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; it says and if you can believe you can
[1:13:02] have what you have said.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; So as we go it gets a little bit more
[1:13:08] clear. says,
[1:13:10] "So now we know the place heavenly
[1:13:12] places. We know the position
[1:13:16] and the position that I was talking
[1:13:18] about here is that let me see if I
[1:13:22] missed my uh scripture in 1 Corinthians
[1:13:26] 15:40." Would you go kind of back
[1:13:28] because I kind of got ahead of myself.
[1:13:32] It says they are also celestial bodies
[1:13:35] and body terrestrial and by the glory. I
[1:13:38] read this one. So yes.
[1:13:41] Okay. So what Paul was talking about is
[1:13:44] again we got bodies but we also got
[1:13:49] celestial bodies. However
[1:13:53] they uh
[1:13:56] position
[1:13:58] I don't know where the scripture went.
[1:14:00] Let me see.
[1:14:04] Okay.
[1:14:07] Okay.
[1:14:09] Just give me a minute.
[1:14:14] So
[1:14:16] anyway, let me give it to you this way.
[1:14:18] So
[1:14:21] the place and the position. Now there
[1:14:24] are various different kind of glories
[1:14:26] according to to the Bible. I was to see
[1:14:27] if I wrote it or disappear or not. So I
[1:14:31] don't know what happened
[1:14:36] but anyway there's there's different
[1:14:38] kinds of glory according to the Bible
[1:14:42] and what he's saying is there there's
[1:14:44] different between you know positions in
[1:14:47] heaven. Okay? Because you you had to be
[1:14:50] in your place and your position. Now
[1:14:53] brother brother brother uh Paul is a
[1:14:56] pastor. Well he's not just a pastor
[1:14:59] here. That is his position in heaven
[1:15:01] because brother Brandon will be a
[1:15:03] prophet in heaven just like it's here.
[1:15:06] See those those don't change because
[1:15:09] from heaven it says he came and gave
[1:15:12] gift to man.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; So the same position you have here you
[1:15:17] will hold in heaven. Amen. So therefore
[1:15:22] when we talking about different
[1:15:25] uh glory
[1:15:28] glorious body and different station of
[1:15:30] glorification it's mean that you have
[1:15:33] different uh gift and different talents
[1:15:37] and just because you go to heaven that
[1:15:39] don't mean you don't play in the piano.
[1:15:42] Whatever you have been gifted here that
[1:15:44] will be also carried to the next you
[1:15:49] know place that we are going to. So,
[1:15:52] brother Branaman will be you know
[1:15:55] prophet and he's going to present all of
[1:15:59] us of this generation mira and all who
[1:16:02] will be in the side and he's going to
[1:16:04] present and he's going to say you know
[1:16:06] I'm going to be judged yes just like
[1:16:09] just like Paul was judged by no problem
[1:16:11] because I'm preaching what he's
[1:16:13] preaching you know all these things so
[1:16:15] so the thing is that you when we change
[1:16:19] you know not only The bodies will change
[1:16:22] but our position still the same.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Brother will be a prophet. You will be a
[1:16:28] pastor. You will be a minister of music.
[1:16:32] You probably belong. You're going to
[1:16:33] belong to the choir helica choir in
[1:16:36] heaven. Satan is not going to have that
[1:16:38] one anymore. But you guys that like to
[1:16:40] sing. You got your place is all I'm
[1:16:42] saying. So that mean saying that this is
[1:16:46] what I'm trying to tell you. Do not
[1:16:49] coveret somebody else place
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; because whatever place you got here
[1:16:53] that's the place in heaven
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; and God hasn't changed that. He gave you
[1:16:56] a place and he gave you a position to
[1:16:59] be. So what I'm saying is let me said
[1:17:02] this kind of uh not criticizing anything
[1:17:06] but brother Brown says a pastor cannot
[1:17:09] tell a prophet what to do
[1:17:12] and evangelist cannot tell a pastor what
[1:17:14] to do and so go down and a teacher and a
[1:17:17] minister
[1:17:18] why because that's how God set it up.
[1:17:22] Now
[1:17:24] saying that I like to say this now
[1:17:28] when an evangelist seek a position of a
[1:17:31] pastor
[1:17:33] that won't work.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; I know some people do it and not
[1:17:36] Christian is not criticizing
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; because you crossing you're crossing
[1:17:42] positions
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; that was not your position. I cannot be
[1:17:45] a pastor and I will not be a pastor.
[1:17:48] That was not my calling. So I tell
[1:17:51] brother Dog when I started with him I
[1:17:53] just said you don't have to worry about
[1:17:54] me. I don't want your position.
[1:17:56] In fact I don't want it at all because I
[1:17:59] know how it is. I've been working with
[1:18:00] pastors. It it is a hard position and
[1:18:04] I'm not made condition for that to be
[1:18:06] that kind of a person. I don't have the
[1:18:08] heart of a pastor
[1:18:10] even though I minister the word. I can
[1:18:13] teach. I can do evangelistic but I could
[1:18:15] not never take a position. So what I'm
[1:18:18] saying is when we trying to cover
[1:18:20] somebody's cell position and I've seen
[1:18:22] evangelists doing pastoral work, it
[1:18:24] hasn't worked too good.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; I travel a lot and I know
[1:18:30] so what I'm saying you have a place and
[1:18:32] a position here and you will have the
[1:18:34] same place and position there to to be.
[1:18:37] God will not change your positions.
[1:18:40] So when you know your position and you
[1:18:42] know the place then you can have
[1:18:46] authority
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; because out of your place you cannot
[1:18:49] have authority. What happened to Satan?
[1:18:52] They changed what their state. That mean
[1:18:55] they had a position in heaven
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; but they wanted to be he wanted to be
[1:18:59] like God. He wanted another position
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; that cannot work.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Never work. Yes sir.
[1:19:08] So
[1:19:11] the same thing with with uh with certain
[1:19:15] people that like uh okay but I like to
[1:19:17] be a deacon. Well,
[1:19:20] if God called you to be a deacon
[1:19:23] and you meet the requirements, sure
[1:19:27] that's why the Bible says you know the
[1:19:29] gift your gift will seek his place. We
[1:19:33] seek you seek the place that you belong.
[1:19:35] Yes.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And we need to respect and that's one of
[1:19:39] the thing we need to respect position
[1:19:42] and the way you respect position is the
[1:19:44] way God respect position. You know if I
[1:19:47] say something that you disagree what
[1:19:49] brother uh Paul is preaching forget
[1:19:53] about what I just told you just pray for
[1:19:55] me. Just take what he tells you.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I cannot teach no higher. Ran says I
[1:20:01] cannot teach no higher than my pastor.
[1:20:03] You cannot live no higher than my than
[1:20:06] your pastor. That's why brother said
[1:20:07] why? Because that is the gift and you
[1:20:11] lower than that gift. That mean that
[1:20:13] he's more special than you. But you
[1:20:15] cannot go higher than that gift.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Because if you do and that's the problem
[1:20:20] we have in our church sometimes that we
[1:20:21] have I don't know we have for for time
[1:20:23] now but people think they know more than
[1:20:25] the pastor.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; So you're trying to seek something. You
[1:20:29] don't know what they you're doing.
[1:20:32] See because God had anointed that person
[1:20:35] had had given that person that office
[1:20:37] the tool that he needs. See and you
[1:20:40] might have another gift evangelist but
[1:20:43] that's different that what God has done
[1:20:46] with the pastor. So sometimes what
[1:20:48] happen is people leave because they
[1:20:49] think they know more than the pastor.
[1:20:52] God has called that pastor for that
[1:20:54] office,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And he's responsible
[1:20:58] and he has authority, you know, and he's
[1:21:01] the higher
[1:21:03] and the pastor is the hard thing in in
[1:21:05] the church is the pastor. Okay, I know
[1:21:08] everything is run by the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:21:10] not dismissing that part. We all, you
[1:21:12] know, do that. So anyway, John 17. So
[1:21:16] talking about different kind of glories.
[1:21:20] So authority that can come now brother I
[1:21:23] read this this expression here now you
[1:21:26] know your place now you know your
[1:21:28] position this is your uh why says
[1:21:31] authority so Ephesians 6 says
[1:21:36] over here
[1:21:38] put on the whole armor of God and I know
[1:21:42] brother Paul used this scripture I was
[1:21:44] wondering if he want to go further but
[1:21:45] he didn't go too far that was good that
[1:21:47] you may be able to stand against the
[1:21:49] bows of the devil.
[1:21:52] Amen. For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:21:55] and blood.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; But against principalities, against
[1:22:01] powers, against the rulers of the
[1:22:03] darkness of this world, against
[1:22:05] spiritual weakness, wickedness in high
[1:22:07] places, in heavenly places. That is
[1:22:10] where Satan is squatting right now.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And now and and then we to
[1:22:17] he's going to come down and we're going
[1:22:18] to go up to our rifle place because when
[1:22:21] Adam fell Satan
[1:22:25] squatted in his place he's in heavenly
[1:22:27] places.
[1:22:30] See so
[1:22:32] that is what I'm talking about the place
[1:22:35] heavenly places. He says for us again we
[1:22:39] preach our wickedness in high places and
[1:22:42] that's heavenly places. Amen.
[1:22:44] So here's what I'm trying to you know
[1:22:46] coming down almost today now what I'm
[1:22:48] saying is that
[1:22:51] the reason that we need to know a place
[1:22:54] and opposition to have the authority to
[1:22:57] speak the word you know so if we don't
[1:23:01] know that then it's going to be hard
[1:23:02] because according to here we are
[1:23:04] fighting an enemy I've been in wars and
[1:23:08] it's good to know the enemy and to see
[1:23:10] the enemy and to defend yourself but you
[1:23:13] are fighting an enemy that you cannot
[1:23:15] see, you cannot hear.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; How can you fight that?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; So in your flesh, you cannot fight.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; So where are you going to fight?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Because this war is against
[1:23:31] principalities of the air. But who is in
[1:23:33] the air? Are you in the air? No. Who is
[1:23:35] at in the air in heavenly places?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Because that's where he's at.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, your other theophony is
[1:23:43] there,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; but who is dictating how the fight is
[1:23:48] going to go?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Your words.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Remember that Jesus could have called
[1:23:55] 10,000 angels,
[1:23:57] right? He could have spoke and asked for
[1:24:01] help, but he didn't. Now, brother man
[1:24:04] says that you speak, right? And when you
[1:24:08] speak, you know, then
[1:24:11] the the heavens,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; will move. But they're waiting for
[1:24:18] the heavens will not move until you
[1:24:19] speak. This is the thing about this.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; God will not, you know, or anything will
[1:24:25] happen until we said the word.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; The word that is already been said in
[1:24:30] heaven has to be speak in the earth.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's what he's saying over
[1:24:36] here in heavenly presence in Christ. So
[1:24:38] the fight that we are fighting you know
[1:24:42] is difficult because we cannot see the
[1:24:44] enemy. We cannot defend ourself or
[1:24:46] something that we cannot see and we
[1:24:49] cannot hurt something that we cannot see
[1:24:51] prevented from coming. So we cannot be
[1:24:54] defenses and we cannot be offensive. You
[1:24:57] know, like that's what you got in in in
[1:24:59] in football,
[1:25:02] defense and the offense.
[1:25:04] And the defense is to protect you from
[1:25:07] getting, you know, injured. And to
[1:25:10] offense, the offense is to go after the
[1:25:13] enemy to
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; But you and I cannot do that in the
[1:25:16] flesh because we cannot see.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; We cannot see the target. So when we do
[1:25:21] it in our knees,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; we command from our knees in our place
[1:25:28] that is heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:25:31] And from there is where the fight
[1:25:33] remember when David when uh uh Daniel
[1:25:37] prayed and it took 21 days for the
[1:25:41] messenger the angel to come to assist
[1:25:43] him. And what did he said? I have a
[1:25:46] little bit of trouble. I had to fight
[1:25:48] the king of this, the king of that. They
[1:25:51] would not let him. They wanted to block
[1:25:53] the blessing
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; because the fight was not here. The
[1:25:56] fight was there.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And your fight is not in the flesh.
[1:26:00] That's what the Bible said. This is not
[1:26:02] a fleshy fight.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; This fight is a spiritual fight.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; It is not your brother. It's not your
[1:26:09] sister. It's not your wife. It is not.
[1:26:11] It is not. It is a spirit that you are
[1:26:13] fighting.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you cannot see that spirit,
[1:26:16] how you going to fight it?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; In your knees,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; you need to speak
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; the word that was spoken and command
[1:26:27] that and they will move.
[1:26:30] See, when Jesus went to see the uh the
[1:26:32] man that was possessed, Dion with a
[1:26:34] thousand spirit, you know, not until
[1:26:38] Jesus there and spoke to him and spoke
[1:26:40] to those spirits so coming, they knew it
[1:26:43] was trouble. No,
[1:26:45] but Jesus did not do something radical
[1:26:47] and beat him and get out. No, the sooner
[1:26:50] they saw him, they said,
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; "What do you got to do with us?" Now,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; see, that's what the five stars
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; when you face those spirits in your
[1:27:00] knee. Let me let me say something here.
[1:27:02] When something does anything to you,
[1:27:06] Christian or not Christian at school, at
[1:27:08] work, anywhere you go, brother says that
[1:27:11] is not your brother. That is not that
[1:27:13] person. That is what
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; the devil.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Because this is a spirit that is driving
[1:27:19] the people.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; It is not the people, the spirit. So
[1:27:23] therefore,
[1:27:25] you don't need to fight the flesh.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; See, we don't fight flesh. We fight
[1:27:31] spiritual battle.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; So what you got to do to love that
[1:27:36] person.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; To pray for that person
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; so that spirit will live.
[1:27:43] Because
[1:27:44] this is not a fleshy fight.
[1:27:47] But you have you must agree
[1:27:50] with
[1:27:52] heavenly places, the will of God, the
[1:27:54] word of God. It says, okay, for we ren
[1:27:58] against flesh and blood,
[1:28:01] but against princip. That's why
[1:28:02] sometimes what brother Paul was talking
[1:28:05] about uh Sarah, you don't need to get
[1:28:08] upset if she didn't have the faith yet
[1:28:11] because that don't come from her,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; She cannot make her have faith.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; She don't even understand what's going
[1:28:18] on.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; So we cannot have we have to be toler
[1:28:23] tolerate be be patient
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; pray. So that wrong start moving around
[1:28:30] there
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; and then it will do the rest
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; but that's why we don't engage
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; physically
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; you know like somebody told me and it's
[1:28:43] been said it says you don't catch flies
[1:28:46] with vinegar
[1:28:48] you want to catch fly you put honey
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; so you be sweet you be kind
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter what they had done to
[1:28:57] you
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; because the only way you're going to
[1:28:59] change that person is from heavenly
[1:29:01] realms,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; not from fleshy
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; real.
[1:29:07] So Peter says,
[1:29:09] "Wherefore
[1:29:11] I was trying to look at the time and
[1:29:13] this computer never change the time. I
[1:29:15] still got two sometimes." So I guess I
[1:29:17] got a lot of time. I got 6:30 over here.
[1:29:21] 8:30. Okay. I thought I had two hours.
[1:29:26] Second Peter 1:10 says, "Wherefore,
[1:29:28] rather, brethren, give diligence to make
[1:29:30] your calling and election sure. For if
[1:29:32] you do so, you shall never
[1:29:36] fall.
[1:29:38] Know your place, know your position,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; and you will never fall
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; because you're going to be guided from
[1:29:48] heavenly places."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I believe we
[1:29:53] have a headquarters. It's called
[1:29:55] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That's
[1:29:57] where all our commands come from. See, I
[1:30:01] don't believe in flesh headquarters, but
[1:30:04] I believe in heavenly places. That's our
[1:30:06] headquarters.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; That's where the Holy Spirit is our
[1:30:09] connection. I don't know if I get there.
[1:30:11] I don't to heavenly places in Christ
[1:30:14] Jesus. Because Jesus said, "I will send
[1:30:16] you the comfort. He will teach you. He
[1:30:18] will show you. He will bring you things
[1:30:20] that he hears and see from heavenly
[1:30:23] places.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; It's our connection
[1:30:28] to our heart.
[1:30:30] I'm not saying that you're going to hear
[1:30:32] your theophony talking to you. But I
[1:30:34] said you heard from your theophony. See
[1:30:37] that day that you decided to give your
[1:30:39] life to the Lord when you heard this
[1:30:40] message.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; But it's the Holy Ghost is the
[1:30:44] connection. Yeah.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; To heavenly places because Jesus when he
[1:30:48] died in in Calvary and he resurrected,
[1:30:51] brother B says in in that day Easter, he
[1:30:55] went up and he punched a hole as it go
[1:30:58] and made a way to heavenly places have
[1:31:01] been closed since the beginning of the
[1:31:04] fall. Nobody could get it. Heaven was
[1:31:06] shut until Jesus came and made a hole
[1:31:10] and made a way a door to heavenly places
[1:31:13] in that Jesus. But at the meantime, the
[1:31:16] heavens has been shut
[1:31:19] and Satan have been having a power
[1:31:21] throughout all the centuries but no more
[1:31:24] no longer. See, let me finish up.
[1:31:28] Wherefore the right give allegiance to
[1:31:30] make your calling and relationships see
[1:31:32] and now that we're living in this
[1:31:34] dangerous times you know like uh uh
[1:31:38] apostasy you know people are just
[1:31:41] renegade leaving the message you know
[1:31:44] make sure that that that that we know
[1:31:47] what we believe and where we stand and
[1:31:49] we're south place in in in this message
[1:31:53] in heavenly places. No,
[1:31:56] it says over here
[1:31:58] John 1:4, let me go quickly. These
[1:32:01] things have I spoken unto you, being yet
[1:32:03] present with you. But the comforter
[1:32:05] which is in is the Holy Ghost whom the
[1:32:07] father will send in my name, he shall
[1:32:10] teach you all things, bring all things
[1:32:12] to your remembrance whatsoever I have
[1:32:14] said to you. So he is the one. He is our
[1:32:18] connection to heavenly places. You and I
[1:32:20] cannot ascend.
[1:32:23] Yeah. We cannot go up but he can come
[1:32:26] down. See
[1:32:28] now
[1:32:30] one more thing his presence
[1:32:34] because even though the word is in
[1:32:35] heaven we can feel his presence.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Now John 3:13 and no man has ascended up
[1:32:42] to heaven but he that came down from
[1:32:45] heaven even the son of man which is in
[1:32:48] heaven. Wow.
[1:32:50] This is not a uh one of those trying to
[1:32:54] figure it out. The one that ascended to
[1:32:57] heaven, he came down from heaven and he
[1:33:01] is in heaven. Okay, I'm confused now.
[1:33:06] Well,
[1:33:09] no man has known the mysteries of the
[1:33:11] kingdom of God to that to that point.
[1:33:13] Nobody knew that because nobody has gone
[1:33:15] there and come back and tell us about
[1:33:17] it. So nobody knew and nobody knew the
[1:33:21] place. See, but Jesus said, "I tell you
[1:33:26] where I'm going and you will be there
[1:33:28] with me."
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; But see, all that happened in this time.
[1:33:32] So no man has known since then, the
[1:33:36] place and the position. It's only
[1:33:38] revealed by the divine will of God in
[1:33:41] our life through this message. Now John
[1:33:44] 14 10:11. Believe thou not that I am in
[1:33:48] the father and defines in me. The word
[1:33:50] that I speak unto you, I speak not all
[1:33:52] myself, but the father that dwells in
[1:33:55] me. He does the work. Okay. So where is
[1:34:00] the father?
[1:34:03] You know,
[1:34:06] did did he see visions like brother
[1:34:08] Brandon? Did did he heard things? You
[1:34:11] know, did God send messengers to him to
[1:34:13] see? says is it's not me doing the work.
[1:34:16] My father that is in heaven, right?
[1:34:19] Heavenly Father, he said at the
[1:34:21] beginning in the prayer that is in
[1:34:22] heaven,
[1:34:24] what I see him doing in that realm,
[1:34:28] you know, it shows me what I need to do
[1:34:32] and it don't it's no different for us.
[1:34:35] You want to find the will of God, find
[1:34:36] out what he already has spoken and his
[1:34:38] wife is doing in heaven, in the heavenly
[1:34:41] places in Christ Jesus. See believe
[1:34:43] believe that I am in the father and the
[1:34:45] father is in me also believe me for my
[1:34:48] very work. So then the holy ghost is god
[1:34:52] in us Jesus in us right it's the office
[1:34:54] of god in us
[1:34:57] you are not in heavenly places but he is
[1:34:59] in heavenly places. You cannot contain
[1:35:01] god just in in you. God is in you. God
[1:35:04] is in you. You and God is everywhere.
[1:35:06] You cannot box them in in just one
[1:35:07] place.
[1:35:10] you you are restricted, but he's not.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; John 5:19 said, "Then answer Jesus and
[1:35:18] said unto them, verily verily I said
[1:35:19] unto you, the son cannot do nothing of
[1:35:22] himself, but what he sees of the father,
[1:35:24] for what things soever he does, they
[1:35:28] also to the sonlike wife." So he saw the
[1:35:32] father. When did he see the father doing
[1:35:35] it? Well, he was in contact with the
[1:35:37] father all the time. The father was in
[1:35:40] him, the spirit of God leading him and
[1:35:42] guiding him.
[1:35:44] First Corinthians 2:9, but it is
[1:35:46] written, I had not seen
[1:35:50] nor heard, neither have entered into the
[1:35:53] haram the things which God has prepared.
[1:35:56] He he goes the word prepared again.
[1:35:58] Nobody knew of that place.
[1:36:01] That place did not existed after the
[1:36:04] resurrection. you know a place in heaven
[1:36:07] for them that love him. So we know our
[1:36:10] place our place is not in this earthmen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Our place is in him.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And then later on we come to earth and
[1:36:19] we have our rightful place but right now
[1:36:22] our place is in Jesus Christ
[1:36:25] and what he says up there what he says
[1:36:27] in heavenly places I speak in this
[1:36:30] flesh.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:33] So it says uh God was manifested
[1:36:36] and we are his attributes. He manifest
[1:36:39] himself through us now and the Holy
[1:36:42] Ghost reveals these things and bring all
[1:36:44] these things to our life to our
[1:36:47] understanding. It's no longer a secret.
[1:36:50] Brother man says after the seven were
[1:36:53] open he says and I'm I'm finishing. I
[1:36:56] got one more thing to read. He said that
[1:37:00] uh Jesus
[1:37:02] and let's see let's see which way I want
[1:37:04] to go with this. Well, let me finish
[1:37:07] this and I go with that in the middle.
[1:37:10] Now, this is what he says in the mighty
[1:37:12] conqueror. Let me finish because if not
[1:37:15] I stay a little longer. Well, I had no
[1:37:16] more war. Well, and we will have no more
[1:37:20] wars then when he comes. No more
[1:37:23] sickness, no more trouble. Notice it
[1:37:26] says when he
[1:37:29] uh he had died there so little spoke of
[1:37:31] his ascension.
[1:37:33] It is one of the of the greatest days
[1:37:37] when he ascended up cause all over the
[1:37:40] earth since the day of the garden of
[1:37:42] Eden. The sin was committed. All heaven
[1:37:46] was shut off from mankind.
[1:37:51] when he when he had no access to God to
[1:37:55] heavenly places.
[1:37:57] I'm glad that he stayed that way. He
[1:37:59] said
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; heavens the atmosphere was shut up. So a
[1:38:05] little bit here heavenly places is not
[1:38:08] in earth. Heavenly places is in the
[1:38:11] place a little higher than us in the
[1:38:14] atmosphere. Now let me tell you when God
[1:38:17] created Adam, he gave him dominion over
[1:38:20] the earth and everything else. He was
[1:38:22] not commanding from the earth at the
[1:38:25] time. He was a spirit made before he got
[1:38:28] God gave him a body because there was
[1:38:30] nobody to till the ground. But in the
[1:38:31] meantime, he gave him power and dominion
[1:38:34] over everything.
[1:38:36] But he was in heavenly places. He was in
[1:38:39] the spiritual. It was the theophony. He
[1:38:42] was not the body yet. So in that realm
[1:38:45] is what I'm talking about that is
[1:38:47] heavenly places. Adam was commanding
[1:38:51] everything from that realm when the
[1:38:53] Bible said that he fell. He didn't fell
[1:38:56] from the ground. Lord, you cannot go no
[1:38:58] lower than the floor. But he fell from
[1:39:00] heavenly places,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; you know, from that realm. He fell down
[1:39:04] to a Lord
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; now
[1:39:08] because even though after God put him in
[1:39:10] flesh, he was still commanding from
[1:39:12] heavenly places,
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; right? So
[1:39:17] I'm not saying that Adam was here and
[1:39:19] then he had another one that once God
[1:39:20] took him and put him in a body. Now it
[1:39:24] was a different story. Now you have the
[1:39:26] spirit in a body. And that's what going
[1:39:29] to happen to us one of these days. The
[1:39:32] rapture will change our body. And then
[1:39:34] those that are already die and pastor,
[1:39:36] they will come to get bodies. God will
[1:39:38] make them a body that they supposed to
[1:39:40] have to begin with, not this corrupted,
[1:39:42] the real perfect body. And God will take
[1:39:44] that spirit and we go into that body.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; And then you become already changed
[1:39:49] completely with a glorified body that
[1:39:51] you supposed to have to be with.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So right now, that's why they're
[1:39:57] waiting. They're waiting for to to come
[1:39:59] back and pick up a perfect body. See,
[1:40:03] God made the body of Adam and he will do
[1:40:05] the same thing with you in that day. He
[1:40:07] will make your body. Now, you and I that
[1:40:09] we still live and remain. We will be
[1:40:12] changed. This body will drop and you get
[1:40:14] another body.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; That was the body that he from the very
[1:40:18] beginning he designed for you to have.
[1:40:19] That this one, this is Satan designing.
[1:40:22] So it says he was commanding from
[1:40:26] heavenly places. See all heaven was shut
[1:40:29] off from mankind. Satan is the prince of
[1:40:31] the power of the earth. Now see this is
[1:40:33] where heavenly places are in a different
[1:40:37] realm not here. Now this is the place
[1:40:40] where we battle.
[1:40:42] They chose to battle and they chose the
[1:40:45] ground to battle and that was you and
[1:40:48] me. Satan chose the mind
[1:40:52] and God chose the the heart. But you are
[1:40:55] only a ground that they decided to meet.
[1:41:01] So you had no choice.
[1:41:04] The only choice you have is to decide
[1:41:06] who one is going to win. That's all.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Because they already made the choice.
[1:41:12] And it's hard to be a battleground
[1:41:16] because you can do nothing. It's been
[1:41:18] chosen.
[1:41:19] I didn't volunteer. You know, I didn't
[1:41:22] set that day. I was that day I met the
[1:41:24] off. Oh, I want to go to earth. I want
[1:41:26] to go through all that and I want to sin
[1:41:27] and I want to be weak and uh-uh me. I
[1:41:30] didn't volunteer for that. But the Bible
[1:41:32] said that God, you know, since uh Paul
[1:41:35] says in Romans chapter 8, he says
[1:41:40] that he put us in this in these uh
[1:41:43] bodies. Satan is the prince of the
[1:41:45] power. While he was falling from heaven,
[1:41:48] Lucifer, no man could see into into
[1:41:50] glory. No man can see into glory. No man
[1:41:53] could understand because the power was
[1:41:55] just above.
[1:41:58] So here again I'm saying you cannot
[1:42:00] fight in the flesh realm
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; but you can fight above
[1:42:05] because you have a representation above.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; See that's why I say it's not fleshify.
[1:42:13] That's what we fight a battle in our
[1:42:15] knees. Okay. He says he had died and
[1:42:19] rose again
[1:42:22] and no no one has ascended up but he
[1:42:24] that came down first. When he was in
[1:42:27] heaven, he was the logos then went out
[1:42:29] of God in the beginning and he came down
[1:42:32] from earth and he was not be made an
[1:42:34] angel and he be made an angel. He became
[1:42:37] down on earth took the form of a
[1:42:40] bondsman not an angel not come down in
[1:42:43] great Jehovah glory but he came down in
[1:42:46] the men's to redeem man to die for men
[1:42:49] to die for man he never died as God he
[1:42:53] died as a man
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; see because God cannot die
[1:42:58] his spirit
[1:43:01] this his body his flesh died the sin of
[1:43:04] man was upon the sin of man and He had
[1:43:06] to be to become a man in order to pay
[1:43:09] the penalty. What did he do? The Bible
[1:43:12] said he was made a little lower than
[1:43:14] angels in order for debt that he might
[1:43:17] take away and abolish sins and take away
[1:43:20] sickness from word. Now when he came
[1:43:22] down from the highest logos from God, he
[1:43:25] came down through angels and came down
[1:43:28] and was made man and he said I am not
[1:43:31] even a man. I am a worm and no man. For
[1:43:35] he was despised and rejected. He was he
[1:43:40] uh he was he had come down the logos
[1:43:43] from heaven when he went back to took
[1:43:46] with him. He took with him. Then the
[1:43:48] high priest being a high priest anointed
[1:43:51] with the torch light of his own blood.
[1:43:54] When he went down there over their power
[1:43:57] here that accused wouldn't let God and
[1:44:01] my fellowship is being broke. See that
[1:44:05] is is broken. He broke all that in the
[1:44:07] garden of Eden. See done the thing the
[1:44:11] domain of this earth which Satan it
[1:44:14] belongs to the devil. But when he come
[1:44:17] the anointed high priest you know we'll
[1:44:20] take care of that and he did. So
[1:44:24] in order so we can close. Uh I hope I
[1:44:28] didn't confuse you more that you were
[1:44:29] already confused. No, you're not the
[1:44:31] confused people and I'm not confused.
[1:44:34] All I'm saying is this that we need to
[1:44:37] understand that we have a place and a
[1:44:40] position in heavenly places.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Now, even though our flesh is here, we
[1:44:46] have a position and a place.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And when we realize who we are and what
[1:44:51] we are and what is waiting and what God
[1:44:53] has made for God, then you will have
[1:44:55] authority and you will have power over
[1:44:58] the spirit. And the fight is not against
[1:45:01] your brother, your sister. The fight is
[1:45:04] against principalities, Satan, spirits
[1:45:07] in heavenly places. How do you fight?
[1:45:10] You fight in the spirit.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Walk in the spirit
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; and not in the flesh."
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Everything that we have to do, we do it
[1:45:19] in the spirit. And if the spirit has to
[1:45:22] agree with that spirit
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; that's why sometimes uh uh we have so
[1:45:30] much trouble sometimes in the agreement
[1:45:33] sometime we agree with each other but we
[1:45:36] need to agree with the word of God and
[1:45:38] in heaven
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; whatever he has said when you pray
[1:45:44] you know
[1:45:46] you talk to God and you ask and you have
[1:45:49] a desire
[1:45:50] But you must wait until you get an
[1:45:52] answer
[1:45:54] because
[1:45:56] uh it won't come out right because if we
[1:45:59] do whatever we want to do when we pray
[1:46:01] thinking that okay well I talked to God
[1:46:03] he never I never heard anything that
[1:46:04] mean I guess he's all right to do it
[1:46:06] because I didn't heard he didn't say no
[1:46:08] that's what I used to do with my mom and
[1:46:10] dad I asked dad but he never said no so
[1:46:13] I get it's okay that's not how things
[1:46:15] work in the in this realm so so when we
[1:46:18] pray. We wait for an answer from heaven.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when that answer come, you
[1:46:25] know it is finished.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, shall we stand then?
[1:46:33] Sorry, it's a little broken,
[1:46:36] but I hope that the Holy Spirit will
[1:46:38] will help you understand
[1:46:40] that
[1:46:42] we are not alone.
[1:46:46] You know who has the best interest
[1:46:50] vested in you tonight?
[1:46:54] You theophony. You know that theophony
[1:46:56] wants you to make it because if you
[1:46:57] don't make it, he will have a make. He
[1:47:00] will make it. He needs the other half is
[1:47:02] in you.
[1:47:05] So no wonder when you accepted this
[1:47:09] message, you heard from where? Oh, glory
[1:47:12] to God finally. Now we are coming
[1:47:16] together.
[1:47:18] Finally, we can get things going and
[1:47:20] let's get things done. I've been waiting
[1:47:22] for that body. I was worried the other
[1:47:24] day that you was going to get killed. I
[1:47:25] went to Vietnam. I almost got killed a
[1:47:27] few times. But I could not die yet
[1:47:29] because I couldn't didn't know this
[1:47:31] truth.
[1:47:32] And that the offen helps me because he
[1:47:36] knew if he if I get lost, he had no body
[1:47:39] to go into.
[1:47:43] We need he needs a part that we have and
[1:47:46] we need that part.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; So tonight I want you to know that it is
[1:47:51] just more than you in flesh that there
[1:47:54] is a spiritual realm. That's
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; that is around us
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; that is active
[1:48:00] and it's positive and it's moving.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not fighting a fight
[1:48:06] on your own. Don't get worried. Don't
[1:48:08] get tired. There's a whole heaven that
[1:48:10] is backing you up
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; if you realize where your place is at
[1:48:15] and your position is at and how these
[1:48:17] things are moving.
[1:48:20] Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you
[1:48:24] once again for this opportunity that we
[1:48:26] had to to address this congregation.
[1:48:29] Father, I just ask that I know with my

[1:49:03] weak, you're strong and you lead us and
[1:49:06] you guide us. Uh and you are the one
[1:49:08] that give us the strength to to move on.
[1:49:11] You give us the word to speak. Father,

[1:50:36] help, but we wanted just to do your
[1:50:38] work, your service, Father. And we thank
[1:50:41] you tonight, Father, for those that that
[1:50:44] made the effort to come. But we also ask
[1:50:46] you to bless those that are listening,
[1:50:49] Father. And we ask you that uh you
[1:50:53] protect them from the evil one as as we
[1:50:55] depart from each other and take us home.
[1:50:58] Father, sound safe. Father, we love you
[1:51:00] and we thank you. And we tell you that
[1:51:03] we love you, Father. And we thank you
[1:51:06] for everything you have done for us that
[1:51:08] this you continue doing. Father, in the
[1:51:11] name of Jesus Christ, we ask you all
[1:51:13] these things. Amen. And amenus.
[1:51:21] Thank you. Praise the Lord. Have you
[1:51:24] appreciated the teaching tonight?
[1:51:26] scripture after scripture after
[1:51:28] scripture laying in such a wonderful
[1:51:30] truth tonight. I would like to elaborate
[1:51:32] on it, but we have lack of time. But uh
[1:51:35] I'll tell you that he laid in some
[1:51:37] pretty solid scriptures about what it
[1:51:40] means to be standing in the authority to
[1:51:42] speak the word in authority. It's not a
[1:51:44] human thing, but we're drawing from a
[1:51:46] position in heavenly places. And I'll
[1:51:48] tell you, I sure enjoyed each scripture
[1:51:50] confirming that tonight and enjoyed the
[1:51:52] word of God. I told my uh
[1:51:54] daughter-in-law today who's just close.
[1:51:56] She's great with child and uh she was
[1:51:59] eating a sandwich at lunch there today
[1:52:02] or this afternoon and I said, you know,
[1:52:04] go ahead and eat more cuz you're you're
[1:52:05] eating for two. You know that. And you
[1:52:07] got to do that. And and uh I enjoyed
[1:52:10] that. When my wife was pregnant, I kind
[1:52:12] of joined in with that even though I
[1:52:13] didn't wasn't having the baby. But
[1:52:16] there's something about that you have
[1:52:18] another life within you and you have to
[1:52:20] feed the other life as well. And that's
[1:52:22] when you have the Holy Ghost. You have a
[1:52:24] connection with your theophony. Can you
[1:52:26] say amen? And that's feeding you. And
[1:52:28] you, as you feed on the true word of
[1:52:30] God, you're feeding that. And that is
[1:52:32] what gives us strength and power and
[1:52:34] position to be able to have power over
[1:52:37] the enemy. That policeman stands there
[1:52:39] with a badge. He has no power of his
[1:52:42] own. But there is a headquarters that
[1:52:44] would back up that policeman. If he
[1:52:46] stands with his hand up, he's got the
[1:52:48] authority. And there's a headquarters
[1:52:50] somewhere. And we have a headquarters in
[1:52:52] the other dimension that's going to back
[1:52:54] up God's word when we speak it. And I
[1:52:56] tell you, I enjoyed that tonight. I
[1:52:58] appreciate it so much that our prayer
[1:53:00] would have authority. How many desires
[1:53:01] your prayer to have authority? It's not
[1:53:03] just saying prayers. It's not just
[1:53:05] praying, but God, when we go, we stand
[1:53:08] flatfooted in our position, and we know
[1:53:10] that our prayer has a meaning before
[1:53:12] God. Praise the Lord. I want to say
[1:53:14] before we close tonight, how much I
[1:53:16] appreciate my lovely wife. I she's not
[1:53:19] there and I was going to say something
[1:53:20] nice. I don't know what happened. It is
[1:53:22] our 32nd anniversary today and it was
[1:53:26] this evening. It was on a Friday night
[1:53:28] in Johnson City, Tennessee. Brother
[1:53:30] Donnie Reagan and the whole
[1:53:32] congregation. It was Ken and Bess were
[1:53:34] there. You got there a little late but
[1:53:36] uh but they made it and uh it was on
[1:53:40] tonight and so 32 years ago. So God has
[1:53:43] blessed us these 32 years. We love and
[1:53:45] appreciate uh my I know you all do. I
[1:53:48] love uh what she means to me and I'm the
[1:53:51] man I am because of God and because of
[1:53:53] my wife and I love her tonight. I don't
[1:53:55] know where she went but uh I honor her
[1:53:57] tonight in our uh marriage this many
[1:54:00] years. We appreciate it. Heavenly
[1:54:01] Father, thank you Lord for the word.
[1:54:04] Thank you Lord that you have enriched
[1:54:05] our lives with it and Lord teaching
[1:54:07] stabilizes the church. Sometimes Lord,
[1:54:10] we receive all these scriptures and they
[1:54:11] just go over and over in our hearts and
[1:54:13] our minds and we realize Lord, you lay
[1:54:16] these revelations and what we always
[1:54:19] believe and say amen to. But Lord,
[1:54:20] teaching solidifies why we believe what
[1:54:23] we believe. And we're thankful for the
[1:54:25] word. Bless and give strength to brother
[1:54:27] Eli, Lord, tonight for giving us the
[1:54:29] word. Bless us now in these next few
[1:54:31] days until we meet together again on
[1:54:33] Sunday, Lord, for the Sunday school and
[1:54:35] for the regular service. May you send
[1:54:37] your Holy Spirit to the ministry and
[1:54:40] also Lord those who are receiving. We
[1:54:42] thank you tonight. We give you all the
[1:54:44] glory and we ask it in Jesus name.
[1:54:46] Everybody said amen. I'm pressing on the
[1:54:50] upward way as we go tonight. You're
[1:54:52] welcome to stay in worship, but you have
[1:54:53] to be dismissed. I know many of you have
[1:54:55] work and school. God bless you tonight
[1:54:57] and may you express your gratitude to
[1:55:00] the Lord for the word that's been
[1:55:02] brought tonight. Amen. I'm pressing on.
[1:55:07] God bless you all. The upward way.
[1:55:12] New heights I'm gaining
[1:55:17] every day.
[1:55:21] Still praying as
[1:55:24] Amen. I'm onward.
[1:55:29] Lord, plant my feet on high. your
[1:55:33] ground.
[1:55:35] Amen. Lord, lift me up
[1:55:40] and let me stand
[1:55:44] by faith on him.
[1:55:48] Let's save land,
[1:55:52] a higher plane
[1:55:56] that I have found.
[1:56:00] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:56:04] ground.
[1:56:07] My heart has no
[1:56:11] desire to say
[1:56:15] where doubts arise
[1:56:19] and fears dismay.
[1:56:23] Though some may dwell
[1:56:27] where these abound,
[1:56:31] my prayer, my name is high your ground.
[1:56:38] Lord, lift me up
[1:56:42] and let me stand
[1:56:46] by faith on heaven's
[1:56:50] table land.
[1:56:54] a higher place
[1:56:57] that I have found.
[1:57:01] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:57:05] ground.
[1:57:15] Oh,
[1:57:37] hey.
