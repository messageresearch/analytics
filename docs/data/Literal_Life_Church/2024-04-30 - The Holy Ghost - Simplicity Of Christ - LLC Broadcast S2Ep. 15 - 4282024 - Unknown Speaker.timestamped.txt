[2:09] [Music]
[2:11] be the only one
[2:15] step ahead I
[2:20] see we'll talk it
[2:25] over in the by and by
[2:31] we'll talk it
[2:35] all my Lord
[2:40] I I'll ask the
[2:45] reason you tell me
[2:49] why when we talk it
[2:54] over in the by and by
[3:00] I'll ask the
[3:04] reason you tell me
[3:12] [Music]
[3:14] why when we talk it
[3:17] [Applause]
[3:18] over in the by and by in the by and by
[3:24] who am I am by
[3:28] [Applause]
[3:32] for I am jealous over you with a Godly
[3:35] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[3:39] husband that I may present you as a
[3:42] Chase virgin to
[3:44] Christ and that's the prophet for the
[3:46] age Paul's speaking that that's his
[3:49] purpose that's his agenda is to present
[3:51] the people of God as a chased virgin to
[3:54] Christ but I fear lest by any means as
[3:58] the serpent beg
[4:00] Eve through his
[4:01] subtility so your minds should be
[4:04] corrupted notice now he pulls all the
[4:06] way from the fall the beginning and says
[4:09] not just what happened not just that we
[4:11] know what happened but he he looks at
[4:14] how Satan come through his subtility and
[4:17] how he dealt with eve and he's saying
[4:20] that the same Enemy enemy will try to
[4:23] work the same way in you can you say
[4:26] Amen so this is our enemy and in the
[4:29] same way that he beguiled Eve through
[4:30] his subtility so your minds should be
[4:34] corrupted from what from the
[4:37] Simplicity in
[4:40] Christ that your mind should be
[4:42] corrupted now when we think of
[4:44] corruption we think of your mind's being
[4:46] corrupted by the dirtiness of This World
[4:49] by the filthiness by the immorality we
[4:52] think of a corrupt mind and that is that
[4:54] is corrupt those things uh shouldn't we
[4:56] shouldn't look at those things as a
[4:57] Christian because we corrupt our Minds
[4:59] how many knows that the the world and
[5:02] and fornication and adultery and just
[5:04] pornography all these things but we
[5:06] think in terms of of of that type of
[5:08] corruption but see this is this is a bit
[5:11] different is that Satan would in his
[5:12] subtility corrupt our minds from the
[5:17] Simplicity that is in Jesus
[5:20] Christ so how many know that God is not
[5:23] the author of
[5:24] confusion so who's the author of
[5:27] confusion Satan's the author of it
[5:30] and so he says there he says I I fear
[5:33] lest your mind should be corrupted from
[5:34] the Simplicity that is in Christ for if
[5:36] he that cometh preacheth another Jesus
[5:39] whom we have not preached or if we
[5:41] receive another Spirit which ye have not
[5:44] received or another gospel so these are
[5:46] things that come after the message has
[5:49] been preached these are the come things
[5:51] that come after the true message has
[5:53] gone forth now we see other another
[5:55] Jesus preached we see another Spirit
[5:58] brought we see another gospel presented
[6:01] and that's the thing that's can corrupt
[6:03] the people's mind and he says you might
[6:05] well bear with him and then I'll just
[6:07] repeat in verse three that your mind
[6:10] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[6:13] that is in Christ we want to teach and
[6:16] to preach on the Holy Ghost a little bit
[6:18] of both that's called preaching I want
[6:20] to go into it and speak on it just a
[6:22] little bit and and uh uh a few weeks ago
[6:25] we had read uh Matthew 25 which is the
[6:29] parable or prophecy for our times it
[6:32] speaks about five wise virgins and five
[6:35] foolish virgins and we realized that
[6:38] they were called virgin virgins and they
[6:40] were uh Christians they were all
[6:42] Christians they weren't the uh people of
[6:45] the world but in this parable of the end
[6:47] time at the Midnight Hour at the very
[6:50] last hours we find a parable that we
[6:52] have many Christians and the only
[6:54] difference at the last moment is that
[6:58] five of them had oil and the other five
[7:00] didn't have oil that was the only
[7:02] distinction is that five had the Holy
[7:04] Spirit five didn't have the Holy Spirit
[7:07] and that's one of the last Parables
[7:09] before the coming of the Lord is that we
[7:11] have the only distinction between
[7:12] Christians and one who have the oil and
[7:15] ones who don't have the oil so that's a
[7:17] very significant thing and I trust it
[7:18] was a challenge to all of us not to
[7:21] preach condemnation to us but to preach
[7:23] conviction because I think in order to
[7:26] live in this hour and in order to be a
[7:28] Christian and in order to fight against
[7:30] the devil who belittles us and puts us
[7:32] down and fights against us I think we
[7:34] ought to everyone know that we have this
[7:39] oil amen so I think it's essential can
[7:42] you say Amen it's essential for
[7:45] Christians to know that they have the
[7:47] true baptism of the Holy Ghost and and
[7:50] so uh that is the only difference in the
[7:52] closing seconds of time and so but I'm
[7:55] always amazed sometimes when I preach a
[7:57] little bit on the Holy Ghost I'm Amazed
[7:59] at the response sometimes and sometimes
[8:02] it's good response it's all good
[8:04] response but I'm amazed when I preach a
[8:06] little bit about the Holy Ghost I'm
[8:08] amazed sometimes the response that the
[8:10] enemy jumps into the situation and
[8:13] begins to jump in and mess with minds
[8:15] and begins to speak to people and begins
[8:18] to raise other questions you know you
[8:19] preach these things to settle questions
[8:21] but the devil doesn't want questions
[8:23] settled he wants to raise more questions
[8:26] and he wants to raise them in your mind
[8:28] that you begin to fear you begin to
[8:29] doubt you begin to doubt your experience
[8:32] with the Lord and I want to say this
[8:33] morning listen if the Lord has dealt
[8:35] with you in any way it doesn't matter
[8:37] what level if it is the Lord then we
[8:40] should rejoice and praise God for how
[8:42] he's dealt with you in your life and I
[8:44] got to say to you that I've Got
[8:46] Confidence that whatever God has done
[8:48] and you can say I know God did this in
[8:50] my life if you know he's in your life if
[8:52] you'll stay in that channel God will
[8:55] give you everything that you need to
[8:57] finish this journey
[9:01] I say that because the devil is present
[9:03] and he listens too and I'm tired of him
[9:05] messing with people's
[9:07] minds we may struggle we may try to get
[9:10] our handle on things we might have
[9:12] different things but we should stop it
[9:14] at the door stop it at the door when the
[9:17] devil tries to mess and corrupt our
[9:19] minds that's one place he should not be
[9:21] allowed to be in but I find that I find
[9:25] that when that subject is presented it's
[9:27] it's it's such a thing that the devil
[9:30] begins to wrestle with people's minds
[9:32] and raise questions and and so I I just
[9:35] want to as a pastor break it down just a
[9:37] little bit if that's all right with you
[9:39] so now as a foundation there are some
[9:42] things that we know about our enemy we
[9:44] have learned through the years serving
[9:46] the lord we there's things that we know
[9:48] about our enemy and we know that Satan
[9:51] puts in extra hours extra time when
[9:54] something good is getting ready to
[9:56] happen to a Believer something good is
[9:59] coming to them if he picks up on it or
[10:02] senses that you're a lot of times he
[10:03] says you're beginning to yield more
[10:05] you're beginning to come to the altar
[10:07] you're getting broken uh you're
[10:09] beginning to respond and Satan is
[10:11] watching you do that and that means he's
[10:14] learned that if there's Brokenness and
[10:16] there's yielding and there's obedience
[10:18] and there's this Rush towards God he
[10:21] gets nervous because he knows something
[10:24] good is coming from God to you and I
[10:27] find the devil's nature is that when he
[10:29] knows something good is coming he tries
[10:31] to jump out ahead of it God wants to
[10:33] connect with you but know your enemy
[10:37] he's stepping out in front of it and he
[10:39] wants to distract you can you say
[10:41] amen and then in the Bible just before
[10:44] the promise came the devil has learned
[10:46] when people really supernaturally
[10:49] connect he jumps out in front of the
[10:51] promise he he gets people nervous before
[10:54] the true promise comes the real the real
[10:56] thing and he jumps out ahead and he
[10:58] tries to tries to get a counterfeit to
[11:01] the real thing coming so that's the way
[11:03] the devil works too we know in the
[11:05] promise of Abraham okay Sarah saying
[11:08] nothing's happening nothing's happening
[11:09] get Hager my servant have maybe God
[11:11] meant it and they try to mechanically or
[11:13] they try to work something up and the
[11:16] devil works in those things keeping a
[11:18] person from the true promise coming to
[11:20] them how many knows the Holy Ghost is a
[11:23] promise it's your promise but the devil
[11:26] through history in the Bible has jumped
[11:27] out in front of the promise
[11:29] to try to confuse and to try to turn it
[11:32] into something else and just before the
[11:35] promise he has learned when people and
[11:38] I'm just exposing him because we know
[11:40] him now after all these years just
[11:42] before Satan has learned when people
[11:44] really truly connect supernaturally
[11:47] connect with God's promise for that hour
[11:51] when they connect with it those people
[11:53] become powerful they become invincible
[11:55] they become stronger than ever before
[11:58] and Satan knows knows that and so he's
[12:00] going to keep them from the true promise
[12:02] of the
[12:03] hour he would love to stop it before it
[12:07] happens he would love to stop the
[12:10] promise before it happens but he's never
[12:12] been able to do it no that's the track
[12:15] record now of God you see the thing is
[12:17] is that once God speaks the promise
[12:20] through a prophet once it's spoken
[12:22] that's it it's as good as done and there
[12:26] isn't a demon there isn't a devil with
[12:28] all there is the devil and his minions
[12:31] the devil there isn't any devil or any
[12:34] spirit that once is spoken by the mouth
[12:37] of a prophet you can never stop that
[12:40] promise coming to pass
[12:43] Hallelujah even if it hasn't even come
[12:45] in the people yet or manifested yet you
[12:47] can't stop
[12:49] it see that's before it even gets to you
[12:52] that's just when it's released because
[12:54] God says when I speak a word it will not
[12:57] return void unto me it will accomplish
[12:59] what I set it out to do and the way that
[13:02] he accomplishes it the way he spreads it
[13:04] out there the the way God puts out his
[13:08] word is through the mouth of a prophet
[13:12] once the promise is spoken and once it
[13:14] lodges in the hearts of the people and
[13:16] starts to manifest there isn't a thing
[13:18] that he can do to stop it and the if the
[13:21] wheels are set in motion that's why I
[13:23] say about your own experience with the
[13:24] Lord because in this series I'm going to
[13:26] separate between what God does as a
[13:28] group and and a and a generation to the
[13:31] individual because it's the same Holy
[13:33] Spirit but he works with you
[13:35] individually and whenever we compare our
[13:38] experience with someone else's we get in
[13:40] trouble but as an individual God works
[13:43] with you and he has your experience and
[13:45] you have to realize when he begins to
[13:47] deal with you Satan becomes angry and no
[13:49] wonder he wants to mess with your mind
[13:51] and make you doubt everything that God
[13:53] has given you because he's got to stop
[13:56] this process but to me when the we are
[13:59] set in Motion in my life when I was 16
[14:02] years old when I was 8 years old and got
[14:04] baptized I did it because the Lord led
[14:06] me to do that the Lord was in my life
[14:08] then a few experiences later and then at
[14:10] 16 he filled me with his holy spirit I
[14:13] look at this as a journey and I see God
[14:15] dealing with me and once the process has
[14:19] been set in motion if God started it God
[14:23] will finish
[14:25] [Applause]
[14:27] it and you start resting in that that's
[14:30] what the Holy Ghost is is
[14:33] rest he rested the seventh day because
[14:36] the works were finished before the
[14:38] foundation of the world catch that
[14:40] Revelation catch that Revelation I'm
[14:42] resting in the Holy Ghost because the
[14:44] works were finished at Calvary
[14:46] everything that was done was done there
[14:48] the victory was won there for my life
[14:50] the victory has already been won all I
[14:53] need to do is yield
[14:54] myself and once things are set in Motion
[14:57] in your life then you say God has Set Me
[15:00] In Motion I'm G to stay right here I'm
[15:02] going to keep following and everything
[15:04] that I need he's going to give me that
[15:06] is the basic purpose and evidence of the
[15:08] Holy Ghost it's when he the person of
[15:12] Truth the person of the word comes in
[15:15] you to make the promise and word for
[15:18] this hour live for this hour that is the
[15:23] evidence of the Holy Ghost can I say it
[15:25] again the basic purpose and evidence of
[15:28] the Holy Ghost is when he the person of
[15:29] Truth the person of the word comes into
[15:32] you to make his word for this hour live
[15:35] through you and to lead you and to guide
[15:38] you into all truth let's look at this
[15:41] after it filled those in the upper room
[15:44] because that's the example we go to
[15:45] right away that's the best example a
[15:48] after the Holy Ghost filled those in the
[15:50] upper
[15:50] room the question was raised for those
[15:54] who were looking carnally and looking at
[15:57] here they come out of the upper room
[15:58] something happen happened up there they
[15:59] weren't up there so but they see the
[16:01] effects of the Holy Ghost they see the
[16:03] effects and the effects was my they were
[16:05] baptized in something that made them
[16:07] just begin to glorify God and lose all
[16:09] their pride and lose all the and come
[16:11] down there staggering drunk drunk like
[16:14] drunk men coming out of the upper room
[16:17] and but what they were doing is not
[16:18] speaking unknown tongues they were
[16:20] glorifying God and they weren't ashamed
[16:22] to do it praise be to God God has done
[16:25] something God has done something but I
[16:27] want to say to you they weren't just
[16:29] saying oh and because the question was
[16:31] what is this Peter what is going on here
[16:34] what is this they were asked and that's
[16:35] the question what is this going on what
[16:38] is taking place and I want to say that
[16:40] Peter did not point to any emotion he
[16:44] said they are not drunk as you suppose
[16:46] people are drunk he didn't say well we
[16:48] were just up there and we were all
[16:49] together and man we we started to sing
[16:51] and all of a sudden just we just got
[16:53] built up in EM motion he didn't say that
[16:56] Peter said what is this Peter pointed to
[16:58] the the word he said this this is that
[17:03] which is spoken by the prophet
[17:07] Joel everything that you're seeing here
[17:10] and especially as far as the person of
[17:12] Christ coming by the Holy Ghost in their
[17:14] souls first time ever in history it came
[17:16] on David's spirit and by the way the
[17:18] Holy Ghost came so much in David spir it
[17:20] couldn't come on his soul yet because
[17:21] there was no Calvary his soul would have
[17:23] the serpent nature you can't put the
[17:25] Holy Spirit on a serpent nature so but
[17:27] David with the holy ghost on his
[17:30] Spirit worshiped and danced and and
[17:34] glorified God and it was only on a
[17:37] spirit glory be to
[17:42] God with just the Holy Spirit on his
[17:46] Spirit he says I was glad when they said
[17:48] unto me let's go to the house of the
[17:52] Lord if you're hungry for the Holy Ghost
[17:54] and it's doing something to you you
[17:56] might be saying the same thing I was
[17:58] glad when it was Church time I wasn't
[17:59] looking for a reason to miss it my
[18:01] schedule's too tight the Holy Spirit
[18:03] leads a person to say I'm glad it's
[18:05] church now I'm ready to go to church oh
[18:08] somebody ought to give me an amen
[18:10] somewhere without the B because so now
[18:12] I've got to get on this is that now it
[18:15] can come in the soul and but Peter did
[18:17] not say we're having a big Revival here
[18:21] and there's there's something strange
[18:22] going on I don't understand what's going
[18:25] on but it just feels good P Peter never
[18:28] said that
[18:29] Peter could take the word that came from
[18:31] the prophet Joel and say What's
[18:34] Happening Here In The Souls of men is
[18:36] right here in the scripture it's a
[18:38] promise in Joel and that promise now
[18:41] after hundreds of years is happening and
[18:44] has happened in this upper room it's to
[18:46] the word this is that it wasn't it just
[18:49] I don't know we're just all drunk and we
[18:51] don't know what's going on but I'm
[18:52] enjoying it what you it's like people
[18:54] come to say what did he say today I
[18:56] don't know what he said but it sure felt
[18:57] good
[18:59] come on people and you know I'm
[19:02] correcting things because we can't live
[19:03] on the surface we can't live on Bubble
[19:05] dances we can't just live on a Feeling
[19:07] can you say Amen Monday morning the
[19:09] feeling may be gone but the word in our
[19:11] life is not gone the promise is not gone
[19:14] what God has done in your life is not
[19:16] gone so that's why we can shout and
[19:19] rejoice on Monday morning the same as we
[19:21] do on Sunday at
[19:23] church that's why our Revival is not to
[19:26] the next camp meeting our Revival is
[19:28] every day in the Holy Ghost and we don't
[19:31] need any music we don't need anybody
[19:33] around we don't even need the preacher
[19:35] the revival can stir up within us on
[19:37] Monday morning and say devil I'm ready
[19:40] to meet
[19:41] you there was a reason Peter said what
[19:45] is this this is the word being fulfilled
[19:47] in us there's this is the promise
[19:49] happening in me there was a reason for
[19:51] the outward motion there was a reason
[19:53] that they were drunk in the spirit and
[19:55] glorifying God the word the promise was
[19:58] Happ happening something on the inside
[20:01] was happening and it was showing up on
[20:03] the
[20:05] outside he the person came in them to
[20:08] fulfill the promise of that hour it's
[20:11] from the inside out not the outside
[20:16] in what is the Holy Ghost when it really
[20:19] TRS really comes to you it's working
[20:21] it's the inside out not the outside in
[20:24] you don't get caught up in something on
[20:26] the outside and don't get nothing real
[20:27] on the inside
[20:30] it's in the inside out not the outside
[20:33] in so the devil tries to stop the
[20:38] promise but if he can't stop it which he
[20:41] can't he
[20:43] looks to mess with it
[20:49] afterwards he tries to get it before he
[20:51] can't do it and then he tries to do
[20:54] other things maybe while it's going on
[20:56] but he really observes and watch
[20:59] watches what it is that's happening
[21:02] outwardly and tries to copy
[21:07] itah but he can't copy the real life of
[21:12] the Holy Ghost Inside a Believer he
[21:15] can't get it
[21:17] himself because if he if he if he got it
[21:20] himself he'd have to be justified
[21:23] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[21:25] then he wouldn't be the devil he'd be
[21:26] your brother and you'd have to shake his
[21:28] head
[21:31] but when you go down that path of
[21:32] justification and baptize with the true
[21:34] Holy Ghost he's he's he's your enemy can
[21:37] you say amen and so now Satan watches
[21:40] I've said it this way it's is he he's
[21:42] watching everybody in in Jud Jud
[21:44] everybody in Jerusalem is watching these
[21:46] come out of the out of the upper room
[21:48] but Satan is watching too and he can't
[21:52] duplicate or copy what's happening to
[21:54] them on the inside but he has through
[21:57] countless years
[21:59] tried to copy the acts and the
[22:03] manifestations of the Holy
[22:06] Ghost now why why would he do that why
[22:09] would he try to copy that because he
[22:10] can't have the life he can't do that he
[22:13] can't find find the source of what's
[22:15] really happening in the soul level he
[22:17] can't get there he has no hands to touch
[22:19] that he can't do it but he can copy he's
[22:21] a copycat he's a copycat he's a
[22:24] duplicator he's he's trying to recreate
[22:26] situation recreate atmospheres do that
[22:28] and but why why does he do it he does it
[22:31] because he wants to misdirect people
[22:33] from the power of the Holy Ghost now
[22:37] Satan is
[22:39] able to in that
[22:41] atmosphere every gift of the nine
[22:44] spiritual gifts can be
[22:48] imitated now I don't understand all that
[22:51] I just know that it's true he can't
[22:54] touch the life of it he can't change a
[22:57] life
[22:59] but he can make a life copy what's going
[23:02] on and he can allow people to get under
[23:05] because the rain falls on the just and
[23:07] the unjust now why would he do that why
[23:10] wouldn't he go just say let's go to the
[23:12] bar man forget all this rejoicing in
[23:15] this holy ghost stuff let's just go
[23:16] serve the world uh he's smarter than
[23:20] that so if he can through 2,000 years of
[23:24] church history if he can get people to
[23:26] come back into works doing Works doing
[23:30] things then he can Sidetrack a real
[23:33] genuine New Birth and a change in the
[23:35] soul and if they do the works if they
[23:38] imitate the emotion or if they can do
[23:40] all the stuff that's around it then he
[23:42] deceives that person because they didn't
[23:44] really get the real
[23:47] thing and that's all he needs because
[23:49] when they get the real thing they become
[23:51] an invincible Army he don't know how to
[23:54] deal with them and I've said before if
[23:57] he was really smart which he's not he's
[23:59] dumb if he's really smart he would have
[24:02] never planted Jesus in the
[24:07] ground what a
[24:10] dummy because Jesus already says you
[24:12] plant this in the ground it's going to
[24:13] bring forth so he for three three and a
[24:16] half years he had one to deal with with
[24:18] the power of the Holy Ghost all over him
[24:21] he plants it in the ground it resurrects
[24:23] and a few days later he's got
[24:25] 120 talk about Harvest and then
[24:28] thousands of souls came to the kingdom
[24:30] got filled with the Holy Ghost and
[24:32] Satan's going what did they do I was
[24:35] better just to deal with one now he got
[24:37] 120 now he got a thousand with the same
[24:40] Spirit on them because he's dumb he
[24:43] didn't realize that if you allow that to
[24:45] be planted that that's what grows and it
[24:48] grows and it grows this Holy Ghost grows
[24:51] and grows and grows it is the power to
[24:53] grow it is the power to bring the full
[24:55] promise it's the power to take you to a
[24:57] rapture it has power that Satan can't
[25:00] stop this is what we know of Satan as
[25:03] well he likes to complicate and
[25:06] confuse what God has done or is doing
[25:09] what God
[25:11] sends is always simple it just needs
[25:15] simple Faith now I'm quoting the message
[25:19] now how many know that the message comes
[25:21] God sends it in
[25:23] Simplicity that it confounds the wise
[25:26] don't you ever make this message
[25:27] complicated that's the the devil when
[25:29] God sends something it's simple and
[25:31] matter of fact it's so dirt simple that
[25:34] most of the world miss it and say that
[25:36] can't be
[25:38] God but we know that the message is
[25:41] simple and we know that it takes just
[25:43] simple Faith as a mustard seed to
[25:46] believe it that's what he needs that
[25:48] simp simplifies it God s what he sends
[25:51] is simple can everybody just get that
[25:53] point this morning to say what God sends
[25:56] is simple and the way to receive it is
[25:59] through simple
[26:01] Faith simple faith not complicated Faith
[26:05] simple
[26:07] Faith the devil Works overtime and puts
[26:09] in extra hours to take what comes from
[26:12] God and to complicate it where our text
[26:16] says in the minds the corruption in our
[26:19] thinking to take something simple that's
[26:21] come from God and to confuse it
[26:24] questions can confuse people instead of
[26:26] help people
[26:29] so you always say who's asking the
[26:31] question what's the source of the
[26:33] question there's nothing wrong with the
[26:36] question but what's the spirit behind
[26:38] the question I think the Pharisees
[26:41] motive for asking questions was
[26:43] different than a sincere believer Satan
[26:46] likes to confuse the minds of the people
[26:49] from what God has sent so now in
[26:52] relation to my subject on the Holy Ghost
[26:53] in relation to the Holy Ghost I don't
[26:56] know of a subject Satan has tried to
[26:59] mess with so much as the subject of the
[27:03] Holy Ghost since this filling and this
[27:06] baptism and this change and this Born
[27:09] Again experience happened Satan has
[27:12] tried to confuse people's minds as to
[27:15] the interpretation of it what it is he
[27:18] wants to confuse people isn't it amazing
[27:21] that the most important thing that God
[27:24] can ever do to an individual is one of
[27:28] the most confused things by Satan in the
[27:32] church it's your experience with Christ
[27:35] that he will discredit the most and try
[27:37] to discredit the most and try to play
[27:39] with your mind the most to try to figure
[27:42] it all out and the more we try to figure
[27:44] it out the more confusing it becomes we
[27:47] live in a complicated world we live in
[27:50] pressure we live in financial pressure
[27:52] how we going to make ends meet all these
[27:54] other things but if it's a complicated
[27:56] world it's hard to make a living it's
[27:57] hard to put things together and you're
[27:59] you're sometimes you're worried about it
[28:00] what's the next step what am I going to
[28:02] do you need to leave those cares to the
