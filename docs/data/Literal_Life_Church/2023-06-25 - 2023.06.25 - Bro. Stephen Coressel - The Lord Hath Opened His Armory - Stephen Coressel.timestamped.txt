[1:28] and we're going to read to 25.
[1:31] the scripture reads a son of battle is
[1:34] in the land and of great destruction
[1:37] how is the Hammer of the whole earth cut
[1:38] asunder and broken how has Babylon
[1:41] become a desolation among the Nations
[1:43] I have laid a snare for thee and thou
[1:46] art also taken o Babylon and thou has
[1:49] not and thou was not aware that are
[1:52] found and also caught because thou is
[1:54] driven against the Lord the Lord hath
[1:58] opened his Armory
[1:59] and hath brought forth the weapons of
[2:01] his ignition for this is the work of the
[2:04] Lord God of hosts in the land of the
[2:07] Chaldeans who by our heads were to
[2:09] prayer most gracious kind Heavenly
[2:11] Father Lord I Thank you Lord for this
[2:12] congregation
[2:14] a group of people that are wanting to
[2:15] serve the Lord
[2:17] and Lord we sing songs we've given
[2:19] testimonies we had a great a great
[2:21] weekend with the kids Lord to further
[2:23] your gospel in their hearts but Lord as
[2:26] our Prophet taught us we now come to the
[2:28] most important part of a service Lord
[2:30] and we ask you now dear Jesus by thy
[2:33] anointing speak to our hearts o God
[2:36] we don't come to be seen we come to be
[2:38] come to hearing from you oh God
[2:42] and so we ask you dear Jesus anoint our
[2:44] ears anoint the speaker Lord just anoint
[2:47] the whole service so that thy presence
[2:49] would be knowns amongst us
[2:52] your Supernatural can have a hook in our
[2:55] hearts and in our lives we're trusting
[2:57] you and believe again now in the name of
[2:59] thy son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[3:01] the bride said together amen God bless
[3:04] you may be seated
[3:06] laughs
[3:09] and um
[3:11] I'm going to preach the message called
[3:13] the Lord hath opened his Armory
[3:16] the Lord hath opened his Armory now
[3:20] sometimes people especially in the world
[3:22] and sometimes us can get the wrong image
[3:24] of God sometimes as brother Graham said
[3:26] that um uh a lot of people treat God as
[3:29] like a doting old grandpa up there and
[3:32] you can just sit on his lap and just ask
[3:33] him this thing and ask him that thing
[3:35] and he's just like a doting old grandpa
[3:37] over you and things like that amen but
[3:39] God's that's not God's character amen
[3:42] but it says in Exodus uh chapter 15 that
[3:46] the God is a man of war
[3:48] that God is not here to compromise with
[3:51] the Enemy God is not here just to settle
[3:53] things out a lot of times I hope you're
[3:55] hearing me this is not God's attitude
[3:57] towards situations and trials it's not
[4:00] just to sit on the sideline and just let
[4:02] bygones be bygones no the Lord is a man
[4:05] of war
[4:06] amen matter of fact in Exodus chapter 17
[4:09] this is one of of Jehovah's Redemptive
[4:12] names in Exodus 17 verse 15 and Moses
[4:15] built an altar and called the name of it
[4:17] Jehovah Nissi for he said because which
[4:20] means the Lord is my banner and he said
[4:22] for he said because the Lord has sworn
[4:24] that the Lord will have war with the
[4:26] Malik from generation to generation amen
[4:30] see what does this mean God don't
[4:31] compromise God always has War amen when
[4:35] God went to war with sin he went to war
[4:38] to abolish it
[4:40] not just to live with it not just let it
[4:43] do what it wants sometimes and then you
[4:45] go oh well you know one or two times
[4:47] ain't that big of a deal no from
[4:49] generation to generation the Lord was
[4:52] going to have War
[4:53] amen he's a man of war amen and so are
[4:58] his children
[4:59] amen watch brother bam said that first
[5:02] quote I sent you brother it's in
[5:04] Revelations chapter 5 and 61. now Satan
[5:07] will constantly punch at you until
[5:09] you're finished here on Earth I know
[5:13] you want to break sometimes don't you
[5:16] know it's not that's not what happens
[5:18] watch he says it right here just
[5:20] remember that you'll never have a time
[5:22] but what there's a punching going on all
[5:24] the time because you're in a battle did
[5:28] you ask to come to Christ to go to a
[5:30] picnic well you're sure going to be
[5:32] surprised ain't that the truth I know
[5:34] some of you are surprised weren't you
[5:36] you come to Christ and you thought oh
[5:38] everything's gonna be great and it's
[5:39] going to be easy and then also in the
[5:41] battle show up didn't it do you know why
[5:43] the battle showed up is because the Lord
[5:45] will have war against sin
[5:48] we don't compromise with sin the world
[5:51] lets it Go the world says why not let
[5:53] them do that why not let these things
[5:55] happen oh they're just laughing look at
[5:57] that Spirit of homosexuality amen they
[6:00] just oh they just love no God will have
[6:02] war against that spirit
[6:05] that's why it becomes harder for you
[6:08] the Lord will have War
[6:12] you don't come to Christ to go on the
[6:14] picnic you're sure to decide because
[6:16] it's a constant battle he said I've been
[6:18] on the field for 31 years and had a
[6:21] fight for every inch
[6:23] amen but you remember this this isn't
[6:27] our war
[6:28] this is the Lord's War
[6:31] amen God started this fight
[6:35] you remember the Book of Job amen when
[6:38] job was living a good life and things
[6:39] like that safety came up and said and
[6:41] job picked the fight or I'm sorry God
[6:43] picked the fight
[6:45] Zayn was walking around one day and God
[6:47] said hey satan
[6:49] hey have you considered job
[6:51] I wanted to happen to one of you one of
[6:53] these times
[6:54] hey have you considered job look at this
[6:57] man he's fear of God and look what he's
[7:00] doing pretty good God Satan said oh you
[7:02] just put a hedge bottom of course he is
[7:03] like that God said all right go ahead
[7:06] Satan never brought job up God did
[7:09] oh why am I going through this struggle
[7:11] why is it so bad for Me Maybe god
[7:12] mentioned you
[7:14] glory to God hallelujah see God's gonna
[7:18] have war against sin
[7:22] God's gonna have War
[7:24] and because he has War he's gonna have
[7:26] some weapons don't he
[7:28] needs the weapons to fight in this war
[7:30] amen uh in Isaiah 13 Verse 1 watch this
[7:34] scripture here in Isaiah 13 Verse 1 the
[7:37] bourbon of Babylon which Isaiah the son
[7:39] of Amos did see lifting up a banner upon
[7:42] the high mountain exalt The Voice unto
[7:44] them shake the hand that they may go
[7:46] into the gates of the Nobles I have
[7:48] commanded my Sanctified ones who got any
[7:51] Sanctified ones in here
[7:53] so he's commanding you to do something I
[7:55] commanded him my sake to fight once I
[7:58] have also called my my mighty ones for
[8:00] my anger
[8:04] amen
[8:05] God's upset about something and he needs
[8:07] to deal with it
[8:08] and so he opened his Armory and he's
[8:11] getting some weapons out
[8:13] and what are those weapons his
[8:14] Sanctified ones let's set the cat out of
[8:16] the bag hello
[8:19] how does it feel to be one of God's
[8:21] weapons of ignation
[8:24] he's going to have one worth of Malik
[8:26] and he needs some weapons and he pulled
[8:28] you out of the Armory glory to God in
[8:31] Hallelujah
[8:33] oh my Jeremiah 51 watch this Jeremiah 51
[8:37] verse 19 the portion of Jacob is not
[8:40] victim for he is the former of all
[8:42] things and Israel is the rod of his
[8:44] inheritance the Lord of hosts is his
[8:46] name Thou Art my battle Acts
[8:50] and weapons of war you see you thought I
[8:52] was making it up maybe just a little bit
[8:54] amen but God called you a battle ax
[8:59] see you're more important in this fight
[9:01] than you think sometimes
[9:03] hey man there's no Little People in God
[9:07] I I tell you what sometimes we get this
[9:09] idea of of we got high people up here
[9:11] low people up here listen we're all in
[9:13] Christ together
[9:15] do you know that's why you do foot
[9:16] washing we know God gave us three
[9:18] ordinances right first one is water
[9:20] baptism what does that do it gives a
[9:22] Christian a date something they do to be
[9:24] born again right it's not the actual
[9:26] cleaning but it gives a Christian
[9:28] something to hold on to that they can
[9:30] look back and say I did do the word and
[9:32] that's two amen I did do it amen so
[9:35] that's why God gave it to us amen then
[9:38] we have communion what is communion to
[9:39] do it's to remind us of why we're going
[9:41] to make it glory to God why are we going
[9:44] to make it not because we were better
[9:46] than the church down the road but by the
[9:48] body and blood of Jesus who is broken
[9:50] for us that's what's going to get us
[9:53] through
[9:54] and God knew as humans we would go on
[9:57] being a Christian we forget so he
[9:59] brought you the Lord's Supper to remind
[10:00] you that you're only going to make it
[10:02] because of the body and blood of the
[10:04] Lord Jesus Christ
[10:07] so aren't you glad he did it too because
[10:09] we would have
[10:10] that's why God gave us the Lord's Supper
[10:12] so then why did God give you foot washes
[10:15] why did God give you foot washing he
[10:18] tells us why remember Peter when Peter's
[10:20] asked to do the foot washing Jesus said
[10:22] wash my feet
[10:24] he said Laura or no Jesus said let me
[10:26] wash your feet Peter said you ain't
[10:28] gonna wash my feet Lord You're the Lord
[10:29] Jesus see if you don't let me watch your
[10:31] feet you have no part with me
[10:33] and Peter said not only my feet and God
[10:36] my head and my shoulders do it all then
[10:39] and he said if I your order Master
[10:41] washed your feet so ought to wash one
[10:44] another's feet what is it to remind you
[10:46] of there is no big people or Little
[10:48] People in God
[10:49] We're All in This Together
[10:53] you all got a part to play
[10:56] amen don't devalue your part god did it
[11:00] glory to God
[11:02] God didn't devalue your part
[11:05] amen we're all important this together
[11:08] amen boy I tell you what if if none of
[11:11] you are playing your part this morning
[11:12] this sermon be pretty boring
[11:15] I didn't be preaching the walls who
[11:17] wants to do that
[11:18] hey man see we all got a park to play
[11:21] glory to God you know sometimes even God
[11:23] use your worship to play a part
[11:26] you know what I mean sometimes you can
[11:28] praise the Lord remember at one time
[11:29] Paul and Silas who were in prison pray
[11:31] the Lord so hard brother bam said about
[11:33] the first Jailhouse Rock
[11:36] split the prison and set them free
[11:39] oh well we're all over the place anyway
[11:41] we're going amen
[11:43] you know sometimes you think sometimes
[11:45] your service is a waste of time it's
[11:46] never a waste of time there has never
[11:48] been something you've done for God
[11:49] that's been a waste of time
[11:51] never not one thing
[11:54] you have never been a bother you have
[11:57] never been a waste of space you are a
[11:59] weapon in the hand of God
[12:02] and one time Paul and Silas were in a
[12:05] jail amen why God knew see there oh God
[12:08] knows it better than us sometimes amen
[12:10] God knew there was a Philippian Jailer
[12:13] there
[12:14] God knew about him
[12:16] so of course God brought him a trial to
[12:19] Paul and Silas remember they were just
[12:22] doing the work of the Lord and they
[12:23] ended up in jail
[12:25] but they had to be there because there
[12:27] was a man who needed to hear the word
[12:33] and they were a weapon in the hand of
[12:36] God
[12:37] that despite being in a jail in
[12:40] circumstances
[12:42] at one time he said a Christian Masters
[12:44] all circumstances
[12:47] not that he controls every circumstance
[12:50] in his life but the circumstances don't
[12:52] control him
[12:54] that's the difference
[12:56] Paul and Silas were surrounded by
[12:59] circumstances that night in the jail
[13:01] they were just trying to do the work of
[13:03] the Lord preaching the gospel and they
[13:05] ended up in jail but they didn't allow
[13:07] the circumstance to control them and
[13:10] they became a weapon in the hand of God
[13:13] because that night they probably started
[13:14] singing that night Gideon amen they
[13:17] heard some songs saying you know thank
[13:20] God I am free free free
[13:23] remember that Philippian Jailer heard
[13:25] him all night the Bible says they heard
[13:27] them singing
[13:29] and that Philippine jail heard him well
[13:31] what in the world
[13:33] what Maybe started saying once like a
[13:35] bird in prison I dwell no freedom from
[13:39] this sorrow I felt then Jesus came and
[13:44] listened to me glory to God he set me
[13:47] free
[13:49] that Philippians set him free they're in
[13:53] jail right now
[13:54] what do you mean they're going to be
[13:55] free ah God knows how to do it amen it
[13:59] wasn't that they controlled the
[14:01] circumstance they didn't let the
[14:03] circumstance control them
[14:06] and because of their right attitude God
[14:09] is able to use them
[14:10] and and with the right mental attitude
[14:13] towards any Divine promise of God it
[14:15] will bring you to pass they were looking
[14:17] to save souls and God put them in the
[14:19] right spot to save a soul because God
[14:22] sent a Jailhouse Rock through there slit
[14:25] the jail no wonder that Philippian
[14:27] Jailer believed they were singing
[14:29] praising the God Amen that's settle free
[14:32] and then they became free amen
[14:36] and he was about to kill himself why
[14:38] because he was going to do it before the
[14:39] Roman boss did it
[14:41] since they let some prisoners go he was
[14:43] going to die in their place
[14:45] but then Paul said well we're still here
[14:48] we're still here no wonder he believed
[14:51] Stephen why do I gotta go through this
[14:52] hard trial
[14:54] what is gonna be so bad for me
[14:56] maybe there's a Philippian Jailer in the
[14:58] easy to hear the word
[15:00] could God use that to save somebody else
[15:05] see God is going to have war against sin
[15:10] against this world sin
[15:13] not against people
[15:15] against the sin
[15:18] amen and who did he call to fight it
[15:22] amen the Lord will have War
[15:26] with a Malik
[15:27] so the Lord opened his Armory
[15:30] in that situation the Lord opened it he
[15:32] got a Philippian Jailer so the Lord
[15:33] opened his army and he took out a pollen
[15:35] to Silas that day
[15:37] amen one time the children of Israel
[15:40] amen we're stuck in Egypt
[15:43] they need to be saved God made a promise
[15:46] to them of a promised land to Abraham
[15:48] Isaac and Jacob but they were Bound in
[15:51] circumstances in Egypt there arose a
[15:54] pharaoh that knew not Joseph and so they
[15:56] became stuck in that situation and so
[16:00] God had to open his Armory
[16:02] and God said I'm going to free my people
[16:05] and he opened an Armory and he got out
[16:08] of Moses amen and he took a Moses amen
[16:12] now listen sometimes God's going to do
[16:14] things in a weird way sometimes
[16:17] you think when Moses was 40 years old he
[16:20] mo God had her he had Moses in the in
[16:22] the Kingdom
[16:24] God God already put Moses in the
[16:27] pharaoh's house
[16:28] you think this would be the time to
[16:30] deliver up matter of fact see I think
[16:33] Moses is about a rapper when he took
[16:35] that out that Egyptian you know in a
[16:37] human sense it made sense for him to do
[16:39] what he did
[16:40] he was a prince of Egypt at the time he
[16:44] was in line to take over
[16:46] so he was the boss at the time
[16:49] and so he took out one Egyptian
[16:52] but do you know why God couldn't do it
[16:54] that way
[16:55] amen because it wasn't Moses's fight it
[16:58] was the Lord's fight
[17:00] and then Moses would have done it it
[17:02] would have been Moses
[17:04] amen so God had to make sure everybody
[17:07] knew that the Lord was in this war
[17:10] so he said you know what we gotta wait
[17:12] another 40 years we're going to wait for
[17:14] the day that nobody could think you
[17:16] could do it glory to God wait until he
[17:19] was 80 years old amen Bend him in a
[17:21] burning bush gave him a Crooked Stick
[17:23] and said go take over
[17:26] all he gave him brother Ben told us what
[17:29] that stick represented he said it was
[17:31] the name of Jesus Christ
[17:32] amen look weird to the world but that
[17:35] stick turned water into blood
[17:38] that stick took out an entire nation
[17:41] amen amen that name is more powerful
[17:45] than you give a credit sometimes I know
[17:48] you say it in church I know you say it
[17:50] in church amen I'm not talking about
[17:52] here though I'm talking about when
[17:54] you're in the land of Egypt
[17:56] and you're gonna need the name of Jesus
[18:00] can I say it like this
[18:02] it ain't called thinking word
[18:05] it's called spoken word
[18:08] [Applause]
[18:09] sometimes you need to pipe up and say it
[18:12] amen
[18:15] Oprah but Stephen I don't know no I
[18:17] believe it then ask God to help your
[18:19] unbelief and say it anyways you know
[18:21] what the Bible says the Bible says my
[18:23] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[18:25] my ways are higher than your ways
[18:29] I tell you what sometimes we get too
[18:30] much brother Paul we get too much
[18:31] trouble doing it our way
[18:34] your way can never be better than God's
[18:37] ooh preach it brother Stephen I think I
[18:39] will amen your way is never going to be
[18:42] better than God God knows more about it
[18:44] than you
[18:45] you just need to yield and belief
[18:48] this is not your War
[18:51] amen you are a part of it but you didn't
[18:53] start it
[18:54] do you see what I'm saying the Lord is
[18:57] in this war and you're the weapon God
[18:59] uses to take it out
[19:02] to fight on that side of the war amen
[19:06] that's why brother Bynum said the best
[19:08] thing you can do is yield yourself unto
[19:11] him
[19:12] amen
[19:13] listen I know we say it
[19:15] but what does it look like when we
[19:17] actually yield ourselves
[19:19] oh now we're going to preach a little
[19:20] bit I hope you don't mind amen
[19:23] what does it look like when you yield
[19:24] when we say ah you know I surrender all
[19:30] oh we love singing that song it's a
[19:32] great song don't get me wrong but what
[19:34] does it look like when we surrender
[19:36] what would it look like
[19:38] you know I've said it like this before
[19:41] I said you know if the Lord called me
[19:45] to eat Taco Bell every day of my life
[19:49] I'll be like well the Lord said so
[19:52] and I'd be right there get my Taco Bell
[19:54] every day
[19:56] see that wouldn't hurt me that's
[19:58] something I would be willing to do
[20:00] but what if God asks you to do something
[20:02] you're not willing to do
[20:07] what does it mean when we say we
[20:09] surrender all
[20:11] can you surrender something you don't
[20:13] want to
[20:14] see surrendering to God is not measured
[20:17] by the things you're willing to do but
[20:18] by the things you're willing not to do
[20:21] amen
[20:22] when you're really wanting to serve God
[20:26] be closer to God what does that mean
[20:30] surrender all
[20:32] amen yielding to him see I see what I'm
[20:36] saying when we say you know oh yeah the
[20:38] greatest gift is the yield unto God
[20:39] sometimes that's not easy to do and can
[20:43] I say it like this a lot of the times
[20:45] it's not easy to do
[20:47] to yield unto God
[20:49] when you're supposed to witness to
[20:51] somebody when you're supposed to say
[20:53] something and you stop yourself
[20:55] were you yielding
[20:57] can I give you some advice real quick
[20:58] amen you can't scare people into hell
[21:01] too
[21:02] there's no such thing as hell too
[21:04] there's only there's only the bad way
[21:06] amen you can't make their situation any
[21:09] worse than what it already is
[21:13] you're not going to be liked by
[21:14] everybody well here we are
[21:17] you're not going to be liked by
[21:18] everybody
[21:21] the Bible says Christ is a rock of
[21:23] offense
[21:25] people can get upset
[21:27] people are gonna get mad at you
[21:28] sometimes but are you willing to fight
[21:30] in the war regardless
[21:32] listen God is a man of war he does not
[21:38] compromise
[21:40] people are going to look at you as if
[21:44] you're being mean
[21:46] listen can I say like this just because
[21:48] somebody says something don't mean it's
[21:50] true
[21:53] one time I walked into the uh I used to
[21:55] work at elevator when I was a young
[21:57] Christian I walked in there and they
[21:59] said Oh look The Holy Roller is here
[22:02] and I said thanks I like that
[22:04] hurt my feelings one bit why because I
[22:07] know I know what I am I've been calling
[22:10] a brain a night
[22:11] many many times I've been called a brain
[22:13] of my oh you just follow a man
[22:15] but they can say whatever they want
[22:16] doesn't mean I do you see what I'm
[22:18] saying just because a Critic says
[22:21] something doesn't mean you actually are
[22:22] that
[22:23] quit giving them so much power amen
[22:26] listen to what God Said Amen
[22:31] they're not going to make it to heaven
[22:32] for you oh that was so good and
[22:35] hallelujah amen they're not gonna make
[22:38] it heaven for you only God's gonna take
[22:40] you home
[22:42] so make sure God said you're going to
[22:44] make it that's even more important amen
[22:47] well I you know as someone one time are
[22:50] you going to heaven or hell you say I
[22:51] got a 50 50 shot don't I
[22:54] I said boy I'm glad I don't serve your
[22:56] God
[22:58] only give me a 50 chance
[23:00] if God would call a Rapture in three
[23:03] minutes from now would you go
[23:05] would you go see every time I do that
[23:08] there's always that hesitation I feel I
[23:11] always feel that well would I well you
[23:14] should know the answer now
[23:17] it should be so settled in your heart
[23:19] you do get a little big-headed about it
[23:21] sometimes
[23:23] what do you mean a Rapture of course
[23:25] you're I'm going to make it a Rapture
[23:26] the rapture's for me
[23:29] of course I'm gonna be there I'm a
[23:31] Christian God say my soul
[23:34] when he died on the cross we sing that
[23:37] song when he died on the cross you and I
[23:38] was on his mind amen so who is he
[23:41] thinking of he was thinking of me
[23:43] the Bible says he endured the cross
[23:45] despise the shame for the joy set before
[23:47] his heart
[23:49] amen who is the joy what was the joy it
[23:52] wasn't cars it was the houses who was
[23:54] the joy it was literal lifetime literal
[23:56] Life Church right here up here in
[23:57] Michigan right now amen he died for me
[24:00] he died for me it does sound a little
[24:03] big-headed but that's exactly what the
[24:05] scripture says you're not saying
[24:07] anything contrary that's what the Bible
[24:08] said
[24:10] and by Revelation Glory when you look at
[24:13] the word of God and it says the Joy by
[24:16] Revelation you say that's me amen
[24:21] what did Paul say he said we shout out
[24:24] our sleep but we shall be changed
[24:28] well he's got a mouse in his pocket
[24:30] who's the we
[24:33] the reason why Paul had to say we is
[24:36] because I exist
[24:39] and I'm gonna be there in the rapture
[24:43] get it settled in your heart don't make
[24:45] it against the game don't hope about it
[24:47] don't don't think it's gonna you have a
[24:49] chance I'll think it's like a lottery
[24:51] oh that was ooh
[24:53] don't think Heaven's like a lottery
[24:56] don't think the reference like gonna be
[24:57] a lotto that you're just rolling the
[24:59] dice and hoping you make it
[25:01] be assured
[25:03] that he who promised it will bring it to
[25:07] pass
[25:09] get persuaded I'm gonna tell you
[25:11] something I don't know what it is this
[25:12] morning amen make sure you're persuaded
[25:15] today
[25:16] I wouldn't even wait to the end of my
[25:18] sermon
[25:19] amen get persuaded right now if God
[25:22] would have the Rapture at the end of
[25:23] this service I'd be gone
[25:28] and have it so settled in your heart
[25:31] have it so settled in your heart that
[25:33] not even you can take yourself out of it
[25:40] when Noah was put into the ark and the
[25:42] doors closed he was in there for seven
[25:44] days even if he wanted to leave he
[25:47] couldn't
[25:48] that's how sold out you need to be
[25:52] whether you're going to make it or not
[25:54] get get it in your heart you're not
[25:57] hurting God's feelings being assured the
[26:00] Bible says try the spirits whether it be
[26:02] of God or not the Bible says prove all
[26:04] things not just some of them all of them
[26:06] that includes whether you're part of
[26:08] First Corinthians 15 or not
[26:10] amen
[26:12] we which are alive and remain shall not
[26:15] hinder them which are sleep in Christ
[26:17] who's not going to hinder them I am not
[26:19] going to hinder them me I'm not in the
[26:22] way
[26:23] I'm going to make it oh I don't know
[26:26] what it is this morning amen but I think
[26:28] we need to be reminded why we're coming
[26:30] to church to begin with
[26:34] why do we have kids days why do we do
[26:37] these for our kids why do we come to
[26:38] church and hear a preacher spin around
[26:40] all day it's God's provided way for you
[26:43] to make it to heaven
[26:46] I know people sometimes don't like
[26:47] hearing that but you're going to hear it
[26:48] anyways because it's Bible God gave you
[26:50] a promise in Ephesians 4 by the
[26:53] foolishness of preaching God will save
[26:55] them believe you have a five-fold
[26:57] Ministry given to you to bring you into
[26:59] the Perfection of the Statue of a
[27:01] perfect man and you cannot do it any
[27:04] other way but by the fast forward God's
[27:07] provided way amen
[27:13] so you're not going to make it without a
[27:15] preacher
[27:16] amen it's God's provided way
[27:19] that why you come here
[27:21] we don't come here for a social
[27:23] Gathering
[27:25] we don't come here just to hang out is
[27:28] it okay for social Gatherings of course
[27:30] it is I'd rather hang out with you guys
[27:32] than at the bars okay I think that's
[27:35] kind of a given
[27:37] amen right even if I was in the world
[27:40] you guys would still be nicer than them
[27:43] I've been in the bars don't you ever go
[27:45] either
[27:46] hear me young people you don't want my
[27:48] kind of a testimony okay
[27:50] but listen I've been to the places
[27:52] they're they're all bad anyways
[27:56] a bunch of depressing spirits and
[27:57] everything like that
[27:58] you're still better than what they have
[28:00] to offer
[28:02] amen
[28:05] we do not so it's okay to hang out with
[28:07] each other
[28:08] amen it's okay for social gatherings
[28:11] but when we come in the house of God
[28:15] it is to get closer to God to prepare us
[28:19] according to the word of God remember we
[28:21] have preachers not because we thought it
[28:23] was better
[28:24] the church didn't come up with it when
[28:27] Paul set the church in order he set up a
[28:31] five-fold Ministry through God now God
[28:34] set it up but God used Paul as the
[28:37] instrument
[28:38] to set it up how you're going to make it
[28:42] and you need them
[28:44] you need them and guess what I don't
[28:48] know if you know this or not
[28:49] they need you
[28:52] we need each other
[28:55] listen you're not going to have a
[28:57] special this church ain't going to have
[28:59] their own Rapture and then my church is
[29:00] going to have their rapture
[29:02] We're All in This Together aren't we
[29:04] we all got a part to play the Bible says
[29:07] there's a diversity of gifts and many
[29:09] operations
[29:11] there's multiple things there's multiple
[29:13] ways to act and things like that we all
[29:14] have our part to play make sure you're
[29:16] willing to Play Your Part
[29:18] oh brother Stephen I don't know what my
[29:20] part is
[29:21] well I don't know I'd ask the guy who
[29:23] decided it
[29:26] you know what I mean
[29:27] why don't you go ask God what you're
[29:29] supposed to be doing
[29:30] amen why don't you asked God
[29:33] brother Brown said there's one thing we
[29:34] should ask more than anything that's
[29:35] revelation
[29:38] you need a purpose
[29:40] you know they've proven that many times
[29:42] many times that people who don't have
[29:44] purpose they just die off they have no
[29:46] goal they have no Direction God is here
[29:48] to give you Direction and purpose today
[29:51] amen you're not useless wow well praise
[29:55] the Lord you are not useless what you
[29:57] did this weekend was not useless
[30:01] even if it's one little small thing it
[30:04] is not useless
[30:07] you are important
[30:09] and you are vital to the body of Christ
[30:14] Paul even talks about it in First
[30:15] Corinthians 12 about the body
[30:18] he said you know body parts that are
[30:20] more vital you don't necessarily see do
[30:22] you but body parts that seem to have no
[30:26] use like your hair for instance
[30:29] what's my hair actually doing for me
[30:31] well think about it physically do I
[30:33] really need it I know we have some
[30:35] brothers who can say you don't really
[30:36] need it do you don't mean to bring it up
[30:39] I know it's a hard thing brother I know
[30:40] it's a hard thing to bring up okay
[30:42] so you forgive me for that okay
[30:45] but you know if I came in with just my
[30:47] hair just all messed up and everything
[30:49] like what's wrong with that guy up there
[30:52] that guy's preaching in that goofy
[30:53] looking hair
[30:55] I'd be like what are you talking about
[30:56] my hair does nothing anyways who cares
[30:59] it just does actually nothing for me so
[31:01] why would I need to take care of it and
[31:03] yet we all woke up took a shower and
[31:05] combed our hair didn't we
[31:07] everybody took care of their hair even
[31:09] some of you sisters braid it make it
[31:10] look a little prettier and things like
[31:12] that sometimes you put it in a bun
[31:14] sometimes you lay it out why because it
[31:16] looks pretty yeah there's actually no
[31:18] use for it at all
[31:21] see that's how God set up the body
[31:24] can I say something like this let me
[31:26] type into preaching
[31:27] you know me and brother Paul and other
[31:29] preachers you know when Paul's supposed
[31:31] to preach as a pastor he's supposed to
[31:34] show up
[31:35] I mean he's the pastor
[31:37] right Paul's the pastor so Paul's going
[31:39] to show up to church I mean he's the
[31:41] pastor nobody's shocked that he showed
[31:43] up
[31:44] he's the pastor but you take somebody
[31:46] with like one of you
[31:49] who who maybe you just sit there and
[31:52] pull on the word of God and just listen
[31:54] but you show up Sunday Wednesday Sunday
[31:57] Wednesday you might even have a bad day
[32:00] and you still show up maybe you had a
[32:02] long day of work and you're still
[32:03] Somehow Here you show up like that like
[32:06] that oh it may not look useful but you
[32:09] got a grand more testimony than us
[32:12] preachers
[32:13] we're supposed to show up
[32:15] and yet somehow you're still here
[32:18] pulling on the word you are not
[32:20] unimportant
[32:24] God thinks remember God even hears those
[32:26] small prayers
[32:30] God even hears those small prayers you
[32:32] have sometimes
[32:35] this sermon is throwing in a bunch of
[32:36] rabbit Trails so you forgive me for this
[32:38] amen
[32:40] you know build a brand one time
[32:42] amen
[32:43] Went to went to fish and I'm gonna
[32:44] butcher up the testimony so you forgive
[32:46] me but he went fishing with those book
[32:47] boys
[32:48] amen and Bank Woods that's it is Woods
[32:51] the woods boys and so forth they went
[32:53] fishing he caught that one little small
[32:55] fish remember he had the vision in the
[32:56] beginning there's going to be a
[32:57] resurrection of life
[32:59] and there's a little fish swim that's
[33:01] flown in the the water and just stood
[33:03] there for hours just dead
[33:05] all the innards was took out
[33:08] he wanted to say you shot your last wad
[33:10] you know what I mean
[33:12] and all of a sudden God anointed brother
[33:14] Banner
[33:16] amen it's a little fishy I give your
[33:18] life back in the name of Jesus
[33:21] swam off
[33:23] and brother Graham said I got people who
[33:26] are dying of cancer
[33:28] I got manual letters of people going
[33:30] through way way bad things
[33:34] and yet God used his power to raise that
[33:36] fish why did God do it
[33:39] but the man tells us why God did it
[33:42] is to tell us he's even concerned about
[33:45] the small things
[33:47] he did it for you
[33:50] he did it for us in this day right now
[33:52] in this service the reason why God did
[33:55] it is because this preacher was going to
[33:58] say it to you this morning
[33:59] and remind you even the small things
[34:03] that you're worried about God is still
[34:06] listening to you
[34:07] God has not forgotten about it God has
[34:10] not forsaken you on it God even hears
[34:13] the small things that you're worried
[34:15] about
[34:17] that's why God did it back then
[34:20] was for you this morning
[34:23] aren't you thankful for that
[34:26] aren't you thankful he is worried about
[34:27] those small things
[34:30] the things you don't think are a big
[34:31] deal oh I shouldn't waste God's time
[34:34] with it I don't know why we think of it
[34:36] like that sometimes
[34:37] God is not like the president of the
[34:40] United States
[34:41] he wants to have a relationship with you
[34:48] I say we get rid of that fear
[34:52] get rid of the the the depression and
[34:55] anxiety
[34:57] throw it out the door you ain't got time
[34:59] to waste being depressed
[35:02] listen listen I know I it's a real thing
[35:05] don't get me wrong depression anxiety it
[35:08] is a real thing
[35:10] but do you understand as Christians it
[35:12] makes no sense why you are
[35:16] do you understand that it doesn't make
[35:18] any sense why you're depressed this is
[35:20] God's War not yours what do you got to
[35:22] fear what do you got to be scared of God
[35:24] this is God's War he started it
[35:27] hey man so how can you lose if it's
[35:29] God's
[35:30] if God's on your side who can stand
[35:32] against you
[35:33] can anything stand against you
[35:36] so yes it is a real Spirit but it makes
[35:39] no sense why you're doing it
[35:41] if you really believe God
[35:45] so stop believing in yourself
[35:48] when when Jesus cursed the fig tree
[35:51] he said he said I curse you you're gonna
[35:53] bear no more fruit they came back Peter
[35:55] said look this tree look how fast it was
[35:57] cursed what did Jesus say Jesus didn't
[35:59] say okay memorize chapter you know
[36:01] Psalms 150. memorize this certain book
[36:04] what do you say have faith ain't God
[36:08] he did not say Have Faith In Yourself
[36:12] can I say like this if you're looking as
[36:15] being a Christian through you of course
[36:18] you're messing up
[36:20] and you're sitting here right now
[36:21] probably thinking it's so hard to live a
[36:23] Christian Life well of course you're
[36:25] thinking that you're trying to pick it
[36:26] up yourself
[36:27] of course it looks like that if you just
[36:29] let go and let God
[36:31] stop having so much faith in yourself
[36:34] have faith in God
[36:36] 's gonna do it this is the Lord's War
[36:39] amen
[36:41] amen you know what that's a good segue
[36:43] because I want to talk about a little
[36:45] story here
[36:46] remember the title was the Lord hath
[36:49] opened his Armory
[36:50] amen I hope you don't mind going on a
[36:53] rabbit Trail sometimes amen I sure hope
[36:55] you're hearing what the word is saying
[36:56] though amen amen remember the church
[36:59] feeds off inspiration
[37:01] we make it because of inspiration
[37:02] because God breathes the word amen
[37:05] that's what we're listening for amen
[37:09] one time the Philistines showed up
[37:12] against Israel
[37:14] amen and the Bible says the Philistine
[37:17] Army ended up on one mountain and so
[37:19] Saul and his army went onto another
[37:21] Mountain
[37:22] so the Bible says they were both on two
[37:24] mountains there was a valley in between
[37:26] them
[37:27] that's how the devil likes to come
[37:28] sometimes don't he never comes when
[37:30] you're on the Mountaintop does he
[37:33] when everything's going good he don't
[37:34] show up then does he
[37:36] it's when you're in the valley he starts
[37:38] showing up then don't he amen that's
[37:40] when the real fight's going to start
[37:43] the fight is never going to start when
[37:45] you're all happy and everything's good
[37:46] you hear me Church
[37:48] that's why a lot of times the battle
[37:50] doesn't really start in this service
[37:52] we're all surrounded by Christians we
[37:54] have a great atmosphere we're on a
[37:56] Mountaintop we're in church
[37:58] a lot of times that's where the battle
[38:00] is not going to start though it's going
[38:01] to start out there in the world
[38:02] let's go start on your job when you're
[38:05] in the valley and it's time to fight
[38:07] that's when you got to start fighting
[38:10] then
[38:11] and they were on both of the
[38:12] mountaintops and so forth
[38:15] and all of a sudden in a big old man
[38:17] showed up
[38:18] now you say brother Stephen you're a
[38:20] pretty big guy well I know that don't
[38:22] get me wrong
[38:23] but this guy was even bigger than me
[38:27] the guy and I know you all know the
[38:28] story but we're doing it anyways it was
[38:30] kids days right I think it's okay to go
[38:31] over some of these old Bible stories
[38:33] sometimes amen remember this the Bible
[38:35] says when the kids came up to Jesus the
[38:38] fair the disciples tried to shoot them
[38:40] away no bring him on in for such is the
[38:43] kingdom of God
[38:45] sometimes that was us adults need to
[38:47] remember to go back down to being a kid
[38:48] again sometimes
[38:50] amen
[38:51] a man named Goliath showed up do you
[38:53] know how tall he was
[38:55] he was over nine foot tall
[38:57] nine foot nine inches I mean that's
[39:00] taller than this
[39:01] he's still taller than me
[39:04] this man was huge and he wasn't just a
[39:07] big guy as far as his waistline if you
[39:09] will this guy was a man of war from his
[39:12] youth
[39:13] amen his armor the Bible says wait five
[39:16] thousand shekels I looked it up it's 125
[39:18] pounds that he just wore as a male on
[39:21] his body that weighs more than a lot of
[39:24] us in here amen
[39:26] and not only that he had Grieves a
[39:28] Target on his back his staff was six to
[39:30] eight feet long
[39:32] I am 6'5
[39:34] his staff was longer than me
[39:37] the weight of it was 15 pounds I mean
[39:39] this guy was huge
[39:42] a massive man
[39:45] amen and Goliath walked up and said
[39:48] bring out a man
[39:49] bring out a champion
[39:52] I'm a Philistine you're for the armies
[39:54] of Saul did you notice he called it the
[39:56] armies of Saul not the armies of God
[39:58] see God call it guys God was listening
[40:01] he said oh this guy doesn't know who
[40:03] he's dealing with if Goliath knew who he
[40:05] was really dealing with he might have
[40:07] ran hightail too amen
[40:09] he said the Army's a saw bring out a man
[40:13] and I wonder if God was in heaven
[40:16] you know the Bible says he rested on the
[40:17] seventh day I think I said this last
[40:19] time you know God sometimes rests
[40:22] amen I wonder if he was resting in a
[40:24] chair I don't know
[40:26] I don't see nothing wrong with chairs in
[40:28] heaven do you
[40:30] maybe he was sitting on a chair
[40:33] I don't know reading a book I don't know
[40:36] how do you rest baby he was reading the
[40:38] stories of people who believed him
[40:40] amen baby he was reminiscing about job
[40:43] if you will and just how proud he was of
[40:45] his son
[40:46] amen that even through his trials he
[40:49] could recognize his fear and be able to
[40:52] overcome
[40:53] maybe you looked at Abraham and just
[40:55] looked at the stories of what he was
[40:57] able to when he went out to go save his
[40:59] brother
[41:00] remember lot Amen brother man said that
[41:02] was his nominational brother and Abraham
[41:04] still had enough care for even for his
[41:06] denominational brother to go pray for
[41:08] him hear me Church
[41:11] don't get too messy amen we're here to
[41:14] help people in general
[41:18] amen
[41:22] Abraham was concerned about his brother
[41:24] lot who even ends up inside him anyways
[41:27] and maybe God had that story open
[41:29] reading in his chair one day
[41:31] praise the Lord that's my son
[41:33] that's exactly what I want to see hey
[41:36] man that's so good and all sudden he
[41:39] hears a voice from on Earth
[41:42] he says I defy the armies of the Living
[41:45] God today
[41:46] perked his ear up a little bit
[41:48] oh what's going on down there I better
[41:50] go look and maybe he looked over a cloud
[41:53] and looked down and saw this big man
[41:56] he says oh he wants to take me on
[42:00] well I think I'll just let them
[42:03] and all of a sudden the Lord looked back
[42:06] and opened up his Armory
[42:09] and he looked through he said I've used
[42:11] that one before maybe he pointed Abraham
[42:13] and I've used that one before
[42:16] I looked at Isaac I've used that one
[42:18] before Joseph I used that one real well
[42:21] I'm going to give Joseph a break
[42:23] I use that weapon a lot
[42:26] and he looked and he looked at a current
[42:28] weapon he's been using lately maybe he
[42:31] just got it out and started testing it a
[42:32] little bit and he said you know what I
[42:35] think it's time for this weapon to go
[42:37] into the big games
[42:39] and he took out a little old Ruddy Fair
[42:42] counting its boy who he just anointed to
[42:45] be king
[42:46] and he took out a little David and he
[42:48] said you know what I think I'll use
[42:50] David
[42:51] remember Goliath made his protests
[42:54] against God for 40 days he came out day
[42:58] and evening day if evening you hear me
[43:01] church sometimes it feels like that
[43:03] don't it every day and evening it's the
[43:07] same Goliath that's showing up all the
[43:10] time you think he overcame them the
[43:12] first day nope he showed up day two
[43:14] didn't he and day three and day four
[43:17] see sometimes I think we give the devil
[43:19] too much credit do you know how stupid
[43:21] that devil is
[43:22] sometimes he keeps coming thinking he's
[43:24] going to win he ain't gonna win he
[43:26] always loses
[43:28] he keeps fighting this war thing he's
[43:30] going to win we already know the end
[43:32] from the beginning he ends up in the
[43:33] Lake of Fire
[43:35] amen and yeah he is still fighting like
[43:38] as if he's going to make it
[43:40] amen that's how dumb the devil is so you
[43:42] just remembered that yeah he's a smart
[43:43] shoot guy don't get me wrong
[43:45] but when you really break down what he's
[43:47] doing he's pretty dumb
[43:50] and Goliath kept showing up day dang and
[43:54] everybody was scared of him
[43:57] well in a human view I think I would be
[44:00] too
[44:01] this man was nine foot nine inches man
[44:04] of muscle had huge weapons who could
[44:07] take him out
[44:09] and all of a sudden Jethro or Jesse I'm
[44:12] sorry uh David's father says I need you
[44:15] to go down to the war
[44:17] you need to bring some food to
[44:19] strengthen your brethren oh if only
[44:21] Jesse knew what he was doing
[44:23] I bet he knows now since he's on the
[44:25] other side what he was doing David was
[44:27] going to go and strengthen his brother
[44:28] and all right it just wasn't in the way
[44:30] Jesse thought
[44:32] because he told him to take some food
[44:35] and go strengthen the Brethren can I say
[44:37] something why don't you do that with
[44:38] each other sometime too
[44:41] don't try to focus on putting people
[44:43] down try to strengthen people
[44:46] give them strength you know sometimes
[44:48] you can strengthen people just by being
[44:51] available
[44:53] just be willing to help you may not know
[44:56] what you need to do but sometimes you
[44:58] just need to sit there and be available
[45:00] that's going to strengthen each other
[45:04] David is called of his father Amen to go
[45:08] down the war to strengthen his brethren
[45:11] and so David Goes Down And he's going to
[45:14] do what the father told him glory to God
[45:16] and he goes down there and remember this
[45:19] isn't his battle
[45:21] the Lord is going to have war with
[45:24] Goliath
[45:25] so God hadn't made sure David was in the
[45:27] right spot at the right time
[45:30] the Bible says he showed up in the
[45:31] morning he even left the carriage for
[45:33] the other person why David had to rush a
[45:36] little bit to get there David God's like
[45:37] David you gotta hurry up he's about to
[45:39] come
[45:40] and God put David right there he's about
[45:43] ready to go strengthen his brother
[45:45] Goliath showed up
[45:48] and he made his post again
[45:51] said the same words I'd fire the armies
[45:53] of the Living God
[45:55] but the Bible says something different
[45:56] here the Bible says and David heard him
[46:01] uh oh
[46:02] see this day is going to be a little
[46:04] different they stay is going to be a
[46:06] little different why God put a weapon
[46:09] there and David heard Goliath
[46:13] amen and it sparked something in him
[46:16] listen this boy was not a big guy
[46:19] brother man I looked up a few quotes he
[46:21] weighed anything from 80 to 110 pounds
[46:24] I mean I'm three Davids right now you
[46:27] know what I mean I'm standing up being
[46:29] three of them amen it was not a big guy
[46:33] but there was a revelation in his hearts
[46:36] amen something sparked in him God was
[46:39] going to have war and he was the weapon
[46:42] for the day amen he was the weapon God
[46:45] choose for the day hearing me Church
[46:47] there was a day when Goliath was trying
[46:49] to destroy the armies of the Living God
[46:51] it got out a weapon for the day to take
[46:54] care of it what are you gonna do today
[46:57] amen we're in a wicked evil age but God
[47:01] still has weapons on the Earth
[47:05] you're called to handle the day you are
[47:07] built to handle it
[47:09] don't let Satan lie to you that this
[47:12] world can destroy you it cannot you're
[47:15] built for it
[47:17] just like the three Hebrew children when
[47:19] they're throwing the fiery furnace amen
[47:21] the fire couldn't even touch them
[47:23] Amen to fiery furnace was seven times
[47:25] hotter Seven Ages of heat were built up
[47:29] and at the end of Satan's Eden showed up
[47:31] amen and they got thrown in the fire
[47:35] but a Fourth Man showed up glory to God
[47:38] a Fourth Man showed hope you know what
[47:41] that Force man had to be there before
[47:44] they entered into it
[47:47] glory to God
[47:50] and that Fourth Man was already there
[47:52] when they entered into Satan's Eden yeah
[47:54] it's pretty bad out in the world isn't
[47:56] it and it's only going to get a worse
[47:57] church it's not going to get better it's
[48:00] only going to get worse amen but there's
[48:03] a fourth man here still in the last day
[48:06] glory to God and you are built and
[48:09] equipped the hand of the heat of the day
[48:13] the Bible says couldn't even smell the
[48:15] fire on them oh glory to God even though
[48:19] the world's getting worse and worse you
[48:21] can't even get a hint of the smell of
[48:23] the world on a real Christian amen it
[48:26] cannot touch them amen
[48:29] brother Ben told us the only thing he
[48:31] did was loose their chains
[48:34] they were Bound in circumstances weren't
[48:36] they
[48:37] and they became free
[48:39] hey man listen this world can't even
[48:43] touch you
[48:44] God there's a fourth man in the fiery
[48:47] furnace
[48:48] God was having war at that time
[48:51] and he took out those three Hebrew
[48:52] children
[48:54] David heard these words
[48:56] boasting that Goliath had
[48:59] and God says I'm going to defy the
[49:00] armies of the Living God
[49:02] David said who is this uncircumcised
[49:06] philistine
[49:07] you know he got a little angry
[49:09] you know the Bible says be angry and sin
[49:11] not
[49:13] let not the sun go down upon
[49:15] your Wrath
[49:18] you're allowed to be upset absolutely
[49:20] just don't be upset at each other
[49:22] [Laughter]
[49:24] don't be angry at each other we ain't
[49:27] got time for that you hear me Church be
[49:29] angry at the actual problem
[49:30] it's spirits and wickedness in high
[49:32] places
[49:33] we wrestle not against flesh of blood
[49:35] but against principalities and so forth
[49:37] amen that's the real enemy
[49:39] amen who's your biggest enemy brother
[49:41] man Thomas who our biggest enemy was he
[49:44] said it's not even the devil
[49:46] amen and so you know husbands it's not
[49:48] that white beside you either
[49:51] it's not her either just so you know
[49:55] your wives too I'm not gonna get there
[49:56] anymore okay I'm done last thing I'm
[49:58] gonna say about it amen
[50:00] who's the biggest enemy you got yourself
[50:05] amen that a lot of time is our problem
[50:08] that is the enemy
[50:10] amen listen can I give you some advice
[50:12] again amen as a Christian you have got
[50:15] to remember you cannot control what
[50:17] other people do
[50:18] no matter how hard you try no matter how
[50:20] hard you try to be nice no matter how
[50:22] hard you try to be kind you cannot
[50:24] control what other people do but you
[50:27] can't control
[50:29] what you do
[50:32] when I was a young Christian I heard the
[50:33] testimony of Earl Williams he was the
[50:35] son of Carl Williams with the business
[50:37] better businessman Bureau and so forth
[50:40] um he preached for brother Craig one
[50:41] time gave his testimony brother Earl
[50:42] Williams did way back in the day this is
[50:44] going maybe 2009 and so forth
[50:47] and I was a young Christian at the time
[50:49] and Earl Williams gave a great testimony
[50:51] he gave his opinion about brother Bama
[50:52] one part of it and he said you know
[50:54] about brother Branham you couldn't tell
[50:56] the difference between his friends and
[50:58] his enemies
[51:00] and I remember being a young Christian I
[51:02] got on my knees after that I said Lord
[51:04] God that's what I want to be spoken
[51:06] about me
[51:09] nobody could tell the difference between
[51:11] my friends and my enemies you treat them
[51:13] the same love your enemies amen bless
[51:17] those that curse you I'm sorry church I
[51:20] hate to be the bearer of bad news but
[51:23] not everybody's gonna like you
[51:25] some people are going to despise you
[51:27] some people are going to say some very
[51:28] hateful things especially behind your
[51:30] back
[51:31] and listen can I can I give you I have a
[51:34] little saying if you see one Mouse
[51:36] there's two in the walls
[51:38] if you see something how much more has
[51:41] it happened to you didn't see
[51:43] you see what I'm saying
[51:45] so see there's just things a lot of
[51:47] times that happen in life
[51:48] and it's not going to be easy it's not
[51:50] going to be fun
[51:51] amen that's why it's so important to
[51:53] make sure you know who you are
[51:55] know where you stand you can't control
[51:58] think about Brother Band me and Josiah
[52:00] were talking about this brother brand um
[52:02] the critics like to say he just had a
[52:03] word of knowledge gift or he had just a
[52:06] gift of Prophecy no he was a word
[52:08] prophet
[52:09] see a gift of Prophecy can be turned off
[52:12] and on by God
[52:13] a word of knowledge gifts are an
[52:15] anointed brother Ryan said a gift can
[52:16] anoint you one time and then not anoint
[52:18] you for 50 years
[52:19] he said that so gifts can be anointed
[52:21] and then taken back that's not brother
[52:23] Branham brother Brown was a prophet of
[52:26] prophets he was a word Prophet it didn't
[52:28] turn off and on he always had divisions
[52:30] could you imagine looking at people and
[52:33] knowing what they did to you
[52:35] all the stuff he knew it all and he
[52:39] could shake their hand
[52:41] say God bless you brother
[52:43] still love him from his heart
[52:45] remember that was the test for the seals
[52:48] remember
[52:49] it remember when God called him for the
[52:52] healing lines would he say if thou can
[52:55] only be sincere
[52:59] oh can you think about that and yeah he
[53:01] knew everything everybody said about him
[53:04] maybe he didn't know at all but he sure
[53:05] knew a lot of it
[53:08] and he knew it and he still had to be
[53:10] sincere in his heart and we know he was
[53:12] because he did heal the sick
[53:16] those prayer lines did work
[53:19] I said Lord take me higher then
[53:21] we talk about Higher Ground don't we
[53:23] won't go higher what does it look like
[53:26] what does it look like when we go higher
[53:28] amen I think it starts looking like when
[53:30] we can treat our enemies like our
[53:32] friends
[53:33] see when we're talking about this story
[53:35] of Goliath and so forth It's not the
[53:38] person that we're fighting Goliath is
[53:41] representing something but I've been
[53:43] talking many times can represent
[53:44] intellectual faith and so forth like
[53:47] that it can represent all these things
[53:49] what is the Goliath in your life I don't
[53:51] know but it's not each other
[53:55] amen
[53:57] we deal with spiritual things
[54:00] amen those are the Glides sometimes it's
[54:03] yourself
[54:04] looking in the mirror
[54:06] amen so David heard these words from
[54:10] Goliath I defy the armies of the Living
[54:13] God
[54:14] David said what's going to happen to the
[54:17] man
[54:18] it takes out Goliath well they said
[54:20] Saul's going to reward them greatly
[54:23] it's always going to reward them greatly
[54:24] but you know what David didn't worry
[54:26] about the rewards
[54:28] do you know that he was even accused of
[54:30] it God's you know sometimes you're going
[54:32] to have critics too he had a Critic oh
[54:34] that was so free I never thought of his
[54:36] brother as a Critic before amen David
[54:38] had his own critics
[54:40] because his older brother said I know
[54:42] the naughtiness in your heart did you
[54:44] know that just because he said that
[54:46] didn't mean David did
[54:48] David did it right David was a man after
[54:51] God's Own Heart
[54:52] so yeah God called see elab said you
[54:55] have naughtiest in your heart God said
[54:56] you're a man after my own heart who you
[54:58] going to listen to
[55:00] oh that was so free Hallelujah and I'm
[55:03] not even charging for that this morning
[55:04] amen I hope you heard the voice of God
[55:06] this morning amen just because somebody
[55:09] says something don't mean it's true
[55:11] about you
[55:14] Elie said oh you got naughty sir I know
[55:17] your pride you're just trying to be a
[55:19] bigger Christian than me oh let's bring
[55:21] it on down to us amen you're just trying
[55:23] to be more spiritual than me
[55:26] David said what are you talking about
[55:29] he said is there not a Cause
[55:32] and that's what David was worried about
[55:36] he wasn't worried about the reward he
[55:38] was worried about the condition the
[55:40] church was in
[55:41] and there was a problem that needed to
[55:43] be addressed
[55:45] Hallelujah quit sweeping your problems
[55:48] on the rug
[55:51] you hear me church because they don't
[55:53] actually go away you know God didn't
[55:55] even do that
[55:56] God didn't take the sin question just
[55:58] sweep around the road
[55:59] what did he do he came down into youth
[56:01] of Flesh and met the problem
[56:03] and when God met the problem what did he
[56:05] do he said I'm just going to forgive it
[56:07] all
[56:08] see that's going to help your heart a
[56:10] lot of times get a heart brother
[56:12] Ramstein a perfect faith faith is based
[56:15] on forgiveness
[56:17] so if you can't forgive you can't
[56:21] believe
[56:23] I hope he heard that I said the same
[56:25] with brownies and I still feel God's
[56:26] anointing right now when I just said it
[56:28] if you can't forgive you can't believe
[56:34] and you're sitting there going oh why is
[56:36] it so hard to believe in healing do you
[56:38] got bitterness in your heart why is
[56:40] bitterness so bad is because you can't
[56:42] forgive it that's why it's there
[56:45] and people like to hide just that little
[56:47] bitterness in their heart oh I'm
[56:48] preaching now you know why I'm preaching
[56:50] out because I've walked it myself
[56:52] you hide just a little bitterness in
[56:54] your heart and you know what you do you
[56:56] take another little bit of bitterness
[56:57] and you stack it on top of this
[56:59] bitterness and guess what now you got
[57:00] more of it
[57:02] then you take this and take that
[57:03] remember you can't control what other
[57:05] people do
[57:07] you can't control Satan coming in and
[57:09] bringing in bitters in your heart but
[57:11] you can't control what you do
[57:15] you don't have to hold on to your
[57:17] bitterness
[57:20] because if you do you
[57:22] if I have the Holy Spirit out of your
[57:23] heart you will come to church depressed
[57:26] and sad you'll be home reading your
[57:28] Bible getting nothing from God
[57:30] and you'll be like where is the feeling
[57:32] I used to have with God I'll tell you
[57:34] why you don't got it you ain't got no
[57:36] faith
[57:37] that's why you're feeling like that
[57:42] you got that bitterness of stacking up
[57:44] stacking up and listen listen I'm not
[57:46] saying it's going to be easy
[57:48] can I say it like this real quick well
[57:50] brother Paul we're here aren't we
[57:51] brother Paul
[57:54] can I say this listen you ain't being a
[57:56] big guy with bitterness
[57:59] amen
[58:00] bitterness is easy
[58:03] being bitter against somebody that's
[58:05] easy anybody can do that
[58:07] can you forgive like a man
[58:10] we taught the boys at kids days we
[58:12] taught boys to be men really drive home
[58:14] what sister Sharon was saying about
[58:15] trying to really define gender roles
[58:18] because of what this world is trying to
[58:19] do to it it is okay for boys to be boys
[58:22] and it's okay for girls to be girls
[58:25] nothing wrong with it and boys amen have
[58:28] to be tough
[58:30] they are tough they can endure hardships
[58:33] they got to the Bible does call I'm
[58:35] sorry to remind you remember the Bible
[58:37] does say a woman is the weaker vessel
[58:39] not that they're a worse vessel they're
[58:41] just weaker but they have different
[58:43] benefits right
[58:45] amen sometimes when the babies are
[58:47] crying about times that God can't handle
[58:49] it sometimes
[58:50] amen Brothers I got aim in the house of
[58:52] God yeah amen sometimes when the baby
[58:54] keep crying you're just like what are we
[58:56] crying about
[58:57] you know and you're just sitting there
[58:58] trying to solve the problem well you
[59:00] pull your hair out that's why you need a
[59:02] mama there sometimes
[59:04] because the mama can take it
[59:06] she can be emotional about it she can
[59:08] sympathize easier she can empathize
[59:10] easier that's why you do it but then
[59:13] sometimes you need somebody to take the
[59:15] hits
[59:16] somebody's got to protect the family and
[59:19] that's why Ben got to be tough
[59:22] that's why I say it like this bitterness
[59:25] is easy man
[59:26] it's easy to be bitter can you forgive
[59:29] like a man
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:36] get rid of the bitterness bitterness is
[59:39] never worth it there has never been a
[59:42] time in anybody's life that bitterness
[59:45] helped them in any way shape or form
[59:47] never happened it didn't help the human
[59:50] race and it ain't going to help you when
[59:52] God came to save the human race he
[59:54] didn't use bitterness Glory he used
[59:56] forgiveness the Bible says God has
[59:57] forgiven us for Christ's sake Hallelujah
[1:00:00] when God saved the world when God saved
[1:00:04] our souls he didn't use bitterness he
[1:00:07] used forgiveness amen
[1:00:11] Paul your dad one time preached a long
[1:00:13] time ago BCF the power of forgiveness
[1:00:16] amen there's so much power untapped in
[1:00:20] forgiveness for the church this morning
[1:00:21] you will feel better you will walk
[1:00:24] better you will talk better you'll think
[1:00:27] better you'll have a better day it is a
[1:00:30] new and better Covenant Hallelujah when
[1:00:32] you trust in God Amen and believe in
[1:00:35] forgiveness
[1:00:36] not only for yourself but for the sins
[1:00:39] of the whole world you know the Bible
[1:00:40] even says the world sins are forgiven
[1:00:45] nobody goes to hell because of sin
[1:00:48] nobody
[1:00:49] they go to hell because they didn't
[1:00:51] accept the pardon
[1:00:53] God paid the price for all sins
[1:00:57] he paid the price for all sins you know
[1:00:58] why because as soon as somebody accept
[1:01:00] it their sins are already paid
[1:01:02] there's not a new payment God is if
[1:01:04] somebody knew coming to this church and
[1:01:05] ask for forgiveness God doesn't have to
[1:01:07] show up again to die for him
[1:01:09] he already paid the price and since he
[1:01:11] already paid the price when they accept
[1:01:12] it we're done
[1:01:14] it's forgiving and that's how God save
[1:01:16] the world Hallelujah and that's how
[1:01:18] God's Gonna Save your loved ones amen
[1:01:22] oh I said we strike down Goliath today
[1:01:25] amen strike down that Goliath of
[1:01:27] bitterness amen use your grace amen fire
[1:01:31] smooth Stones David took j-e-s-u-s
[1:01:34] g-r-a-c-e f-a-i-t-h amen take your five
[1:01:38] stones and break down that giant amen
[1:01:45] glory to God and Hallelujah
[1:01:49] are promised not to be long today but
[1:01:52] it's not working is it
[1:01:57] hey man oh don't you feel good in the
[1:01:59] presence of the Lord do you feel that
[1:02:01] right now do you feel it's it's somehow
[1:02:03] you know what I mean like like a lot of
[1:02:06] times people get stuck in this
[1:02:08] legalistic thinking of I if I have more
[1:02:10] works I can be closer to God Amen and I
[1:02:14] just I can I encourage you this morning
[1:02:15] get rid of that thinking out of your
[1:02:19] mind
[1:02:20] I've said this multiple times lately it
[1:02:22] keeps popping up in my sermons I've said
[1:02:24] do you think that if you hadn't made any
[1:02:27] good works and you live so holy that if
[1:02:30] you add your Holiness to God he'd be
[1:02:32] more holy now
[1:02:34] you cannot live so holy that you add
[1:02:37] more Holiness to God
[1:02:39] amen so then why does God need your
[1:02:41] Holiness then there's nothing wrong with
[1:02:43] good works but we got to think of it
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:46] I don't do good works because I think
[1:02:48] God is better because of it
[1:02:50] I do it because I love him because of
[1:02:52] what he did for me I don't want to hurt
[1:02:55] him what did Brothers say the middle of
[1:02:57] the road between faith and works
[1:02:59] called it love
[1:03:01] that's the middle of the road
[1:03:04] listen what did God what does God
[1:03:05] actually want from you
[1:03:07] what does God actually want from you
[1:03:09] think about it like that
[1:03:11] does God need your good works to be
[1:03:12] better
[1:03:13] you know what the Bible says the Bible
[1:03:15] he says in the book of Acts he doesn't
[1:03:16] even mean your hands to worship Him
[1:03:19] seeing he gives life and breath to all
[1:03:20] things
[1:03:21] wait a minute so now he doesn't need my
[1:03:23] hands to worship I mean think about it
[1:03:25] God made the air didn't he
[1:03:27] he made your body so he made it all so
[1:03:30] you're only alive because of him
[1:03:32] so he made you alive just to do this
[1:03:36] what did he actually want from you
[1:03:39] but Abraham said the Bible well we're
[1:03:41] we're doing a different sermon this
[1:03:42] morning I hope you don't mind
[1:03:44] the Bible says brother bam taught us in
[1:03:45] Christ the minister of God the Bible is
[1:03:46] written for one purpose and one goal
[1:03:49] one purpose you hear me
[1:03:51] it's not two it's not three it's not ten
[1:03:53] all this Bible was written for one
[1:03:55] purpose
[1:03:56] and he said it's three-fold
[1:03:59] amen it's not three purposes
[1:04:03] it's a three-fold one purpose
[1:04:05] and what is it we all know what it is
[1:04:07] Christ on the preeminence of one man
[1:04:09] Christ I'm the preeminist a group of
[1:04:11] Believers hello
[1:04:12] you are the second fold of his purpose
[1:04:14] hello you are a part of God's purpose
[1:04:18] but then what's the third one
[1:04:20] Adam and Eve in the garden again
[1:04:23] all the Bible's purpose is written for
[1:04:25] is that we would know him in the
[1:04:27] fullness back in the garden
[1:04:29] and what was the garden made for you
[1:04:31] ever thought about that for a second why
[1:04:33] did God make the guardian of Eden I mean
[1:04:35] Canadian just made man and planted him
[1:04:36] anywhere
[1:04:38] and one sense he could right he's God he
[1:04:40] could do whatever he wants but why did
[1:04:42] God make the Garden of Eden brother
[1:04:44] Brahm tells us and it's a quote I can
[1:04:45] give you the quote later if you want it
[1:04:46] but the RAM said in Fellowship the
[1:04:48] guardian of Eden was made for Fellowship
[1:04:52] there's one thing God couldn't do by
[1:04:56] himself
[1:04:57] and that's fellowship with you
[1:05:01] so why did God bring you here
[1:05:04] for Fellowship
[1:05:06] do you see why God don't need your works
[1:05:09] I do my works I want to live a better
[1:05:11] Christian life because of what he did
[1:05:14] for me
[1:05:15] not because I think he'll do more for me
[1:05:18] are you hearing me church I know this is
[1:05:21] so hard for us to hear sometimes
[1:05:23] your Works your Works your your holiness
[1:05:27] amen isn't going to ever match God's
[1:05:30] holiness
[1:05:31] your Holiness and your righteousness is
[1:05:34] filthy rags
[1:05:35] so throw it in the dumpster already will
[1:05:37] ya
[1:05:38] get rid of your anger and your
[1:05:40] bitterness
[1:05:42] amen get rid of your legalistic thinking
[1:05:44] what a waste of time don't you want to
[1:05:47] serve God
[1:05:48] how do you serve God who wants to be
[1:05:50] closer to God I know I do
[1:05:52] well brother man told you how to do it
[1:05:55] said read your Bible and pray every day
[1:05:57] it's one of the quickest answers you
[1:05:59] ever gave him question and answers my
[1:06:01] goodies do you think you talk a little
[1:06:02] bit more about it
[1:06:05] but is it really that simple
[1:06:08] you know what I mean could it be that
[1:06:10] simple
[1:06:12] oh sometimes we think we got to be a
[1:06:14] better Christian and I gotta do more
[1:06:16] work for the Lord can I feed more sick
[1:06:18] can I feed more of the poor can I do
[1:06:21] more work can I do more do more
[1:06:24] and sometimes we start relying on that
[1:06:27] stuff that's what's going to make it to
[1:06:29] heaven for us
[1:06:31] for us no it's not
[1:06:33] you're going to make it to Heaven
[1:06:34] because of him
[1:06:37] remember the story of Martha and Mary I
[1:06:40] always mix them up you forgive me if I
[1:06:42] get their names wrong but there was one
[1:06:43] sister one time doing the work in the
[1:06:45] kitchen getting the food ready and the
[1:06:47] other sister was sitting down listening
[1:06:49] to the word
[1:06:50] and the other sister got upset didn't
[1:06:52] she
[1:06:53] man I gotta do all the work and this
[1:06:55] one's not doing anything Jesus says she
[1:06:57] picked the more important thing
[1:07:03] this was supposed to be a fun sermon but
[1:07:09] what are you doing
[1:07:11] are you picking the important thing
[1:07:13] sometimes you're going to need to stop
[1:07:16] and listen
[1:07:18] listen it's good to hear a preacher amen
[1:07:21] it's good to hear each other but
[1:07:23] sometimes the only answer is going to be
[1:07:25] God
[1:07:26] and you need to start listening for his
[1:07:29] voice
[1:07:30] you need to hear what God has to say to
[1:07:33] you
[1:07:35] because I'm telling you right now
[1:07:37] preachers don't always have the answers
[1:07:39] sorry
[1:07:40] brother Ram said that he said the gospel
[1:07:42] ain't a gimmick
[1:07:44] it's not a gimmick that has all the
[1:07:46] answers to everything
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:49] one person might have to do something
[1:07:51] and one person has to do something
[1:07:52] different
[1:07:54] sometimes they can look completely
[1:07:55] opposite of each other and yet they're
[1:07:57] both following the will of God you ever
[1:07:59] think about this for a second Jonah
[1:08:02] when Jonah was was ended up in that
[1:08:04] Wales building you know how Jonah ended
[1:08:06] up in that whale's belly
[1:08:07] not doing what God told him to do he was
[1:08:10] supposed to go to the Eva and he said I
[1:08:13] ain't going to Don Nueva and he went to
[1:08:15] tarshus and he was on a boat that day
[1:08:18] and they knew those Sailors had a lot of
[1:08:20] sense more sense of the world today they
[1:08:22] think the judgments of God and things
[1:08:24] like that and the bad weather is because
[1:08:26] of climate change
[1:08:27] oh man that was pretty good amen those
[1:08:29] Sailors knew better than that they said
[1:08:31] no this climate ain't because of climate
[1:08:33] change because God's trying to tell us
[1:08:34] something oh that was good you take that
[1:08:36] home with you hey man who hallelujah
[1:08:38] amen those Sailors had a lot more sense
[1:08:41] they said oh what's this storm going on
[1:08:43] this ain't just climate change God's
[1:08:46] doing something here
[1:08:48] and Jonah knew it was him
[1:08:51] he said throw me off and they actually
[1:08:53] felt bad for the guy took lots and it
[1:08:55] was still Jonah
[1:08:57] he was a prophet remember so not only
[1:09:00] did he know but God made sure and Jonah
[1:09:02] aylined up in that whale's belly didn't
[1:09:04] he
[1:09:05] he said once more will I look to thy
[1:09:07] Holy Temple
[1:09:08] now we sometimes brother Graham said
[1:09:10] this sometimes Jonah gets a bad rap
[1:09:13] people think Jonah was backslided
[1:09:15] brother man said Jonah wasn't
[1:09:16] backsliding he was spirit-led
[1:09:20] wait a minute
[1:09:22] Jonah Spirit lead
[1:09:24] how could you say that oh it's very easy
[1:09:26] Jesus brings it up
[1:09:29] about his own Resurrection
[1:09:31] Jesus said as Jonah was in the whale's
[1:09:33] belly for three days and three nights so
[1:09:35] shall the son of man be in the heart of
[1:09:36] the Earth
[1:09:37] Jonah became a type of the resurrection
[1:09:39] of Christ as a matter of fact he's the
[1:09:42] only one
[1:09:43] he's the only type of a person going
[1:09:45] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:09:48] and how did he end up in that whale's
[1:09:49] belly
[1:09:50] not doing what God Said
[1:09:54] isn't that something
[1:09:56] brother Stephen I don't think that
[1:09:58] brother should be doing that are you
[1:10:00] sure
[1:10:01] what if he's a Jonah oh can I say it
[1:10:04] like this what if you're the Jonah
[1:10:09] see that's why it's so important I'm
[1:10:12] going to close with this because I could
[1:10:13] talk about this all day hey man but let
[1:10:16] me just end with this amen
[1:10:19] sometimes we don't have all the answers
[1:10:22] you don't have all the answers for
[1:10:24] yourself and you don't have all the
[1:10:25] answers for your brother
[1:10:27] but we're all in this together still can
[1:10:30] you say Amen
[1:10:32] and not just I hope you understand your
[1:10:34] local assembly should be close together
[1:10:35] too remember there's a bride over the
[1:10:37] whole earth too I appreciate what
[1:10:39] brother Paul said about your church
[1:10:40] supporting other Ministries and so forth
[1:10:42] amen that's what we ought to do
[1:10:44] and you ought to be thankful that your
[1:10:47] your your finances and your and your
[1:10:49] servitude and so forth can help other
[1:10:51] people
[1:10:52] I know you got started you're
[1:10:53] broadcasting and things like that I
[1:10:54] think that's an absolute fantastic idea
[1:10:57] you know how many people don't have a
[1:10:58] chance you got
[1:11:01] don't even have a chance to hear the
[1:11:03] words of the prophet
[1:11:05] we take it for granted sometime can you
[1:11:07] say Amen I know I do sometimes
[1:11:11] sometimes we get stuck in our own little
[1:11:13] bubble and we forget about the actual
[1:11:15] goal is to find more souls for Jesus
[1:11:18] Christ
[1:11:19] maybe we can do a little prayer like
[1:11:21] that maybe we'll end on that amen can
[1:11:23] you let's take a little time and just
[1:11:25] remember those people who don't know
[1:11:26] Jesus Christ
[1:11:28] and we can and we can worry about them
[1:11:30] just a little bit can you say Amen
[1:11:32] there's people out there who if you
[1:11:35] don't say something are going to hell
[1:11:38] if you don't bring it up
[1:11:41] when you're in the supermarket
[1:11:43] amen and you maybe you see somebody have
[1:11:46] a little Jesus fish pin on their thing
[1:11:48] in the cash register bring it up
[1:11:51] hey are you a friend
[1:11:53] Christian will praise the Lord I'm a
[1:11:55] Christian too
[1:11:56] would you mind if we pray
[1:11:59] with them
[1:12:01] amen oh I think I've given you this
[1:12:03] testimony before but I'm going to do it
[1:12:04] again real quick okay if you don't mind
[1:12:07] I had a brother one time come up to me
[1:12:09] and ask me that very same question when
[1:12:11] I started working at Salters he came up
[1:12:13] to me and he said me and this other
[1:12:14] brother pray each morning
[1:12:18] hope you hear me
[1:12:23] he overheard me talking about Christ to
[1:12:25] somebody else
[1:12:27] and he came up and he said I want to
[1:12:29] pray you want to pray with me and this
[1:12:30] other person uh me and the other person
[1:12:33] work third and he worked first so they
[1:12:35] would pray in the morning together and I
[1:12:37] said amen I'll pray with you
[1:12:39] there were all denominational people
[1:12:42] some Mennonite some uh Pentecostal
[1:12:45] we prayed with each other
[1:12:48] something so small is that
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:52] and then they found out they did a bible
[1:12:54] study on Tuesday some men's bible study
[1:12:56] would you like to come
[1:12:57] sure I'll come
[1:13:00] and we get to talking and so forth and I
[1:13:02] present the message to him
[1:13:04] amen by by that one little willingness
[1:13:08] to pray with somebody else
[1:13:12] ended up saving a man named Steve
[1:13:13] Delaney
[1:13:15] and you know his daughter she a couple
[1:13:18] of his daughters and I think about it
[1:13:19] the one daughter seered this time but
[1:13:21] the other daughter decided to miss my
[1:13:23] service too you make sure you make Kyle
[1:13:24] and Laura feel bad for missing my
[1:13:26] service okay
[1:13:28] I did it to Josiah and Ashley last time
[1:13:30] now I'm doing to them okay I treat the
[1:13:32] ladies like my family so I can get him
[1:13:34] in trouble he's listening right now so
[1:13:36] I'm getting him in trouble amen
[1:13:38] but that's my point
[1:13:40] is that that one little prayer that's
[1:13:43] all it started I'm just so struck by it
[1:13:46] right now
[1:13:48] it was one man came up to me and asked
[1:13:51] to pray with him
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:54] saved an entire family
[1:13:58] what about you
[1:14:01] you see what I'm saying
[1:14:03] I have a heart willing for that have a
[1:14:06] heart like David
[1:14:07] when you see that Goliath
[1:14:10] let's take that Goliath out amen

[1:14:15] let's take Grace with us amen and let's
[1:14:19] take out the Goliath can you say Amen

[1:14:26] heads for a prayer most gracious kind of
[1:14:27] heavenly father I just thank you Lord

[1:14:30] Lord your presence just as Paul said
[1:14:32] this morning Lord your presence just
[1:14:34] feels so comforting this morning Lord
[1:14:36] the words that you spoke today Lord I
[1:14:38] believe we're just used to try to lift
[1:14:40] us up a little higher Lord
[1:14:42] just said Lord we do want to be better
[1:14:45] Christians
[1:14:47] I want to be able to be a servant to you
