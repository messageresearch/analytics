[44:57] amen before we go to the Lord in prayer
[44:58] if you have an unspoken request you can
[45:00] acknowledge it to the Lord by uplifted
[45:05] hand let's
[45:09] pray Lord Jesus father we are here on
[45:12] the merits of your mercy and Grace
[45:15] Lord know there's no good thing that we
[45:18] could do father that's Place Us in this
[45:21] position but it's all your election and
[45:23] your choosing Lord Lord and you see that
[45:26] hands that are lifted to you father to
[45:27] identify a need or a desire Lord and we
[45:31] know that you're more than able Lord to
[45:32] touch that need or that desire but Lord
[45:36] we pray this morning Lord that our
[45:38] desire and our need would be according
[45:40] to your perfect will Lord God that we
[45:43] wouldn't want father anything that you
[45:45] don't already have for us Lord but Lord
[45:48] God we would pray Lord and we desire the
[45:51] leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord
[45:53] knowing father if it's your will nothing
[45:55] could stop it from coming to pass Lord
[45:58] no no enemy Lord no situation nothing
[46:02] could hinder it from coming forth Lord
[46:04] in its fullness so Lord God we give it
[46:07] to you this morning Lord we thank you
[46:09] for the atmosphere Lord you've allowed
[46:11] us to create as amateur creators Lord
[46:14] that's what you said about us Lord so we
[46:16] create an atmosphere today that we're
[46:20] believing that you are welcome Lord and
[46:23] Lord if you're welcome Lord you're
[46:24] welcome to be everything that you are in
[46:27] our lives right now Lord some may need
[46:30] healing Lord some may need Deliverance
[46:32] or encouragement or financial blessing
[46:34] or whatever it may be Lord we put you in
[46:37] position right now to be that God who is
[46:42] a reward of those that diligently seek
[46:44] him Lord and Lord God we know that there
[46:47] different situations in families Lord
[46:49] and and in churches Lord and we put the
[46:52] hand of God before it Lord and we give
[46:54] you our faith this morning Lord along
[46:57] with our B souls and spirit Lord that
[47:00] you'd have a dominating presence over us
[47:04] today Lord Lord that nothing of the past
[47:07] Lord or nothing even right now in the
[47:09] present would hinder us from being
[47:11] dominated by the spirit of the Holy
[47:13] Ghost and father we want the Holy Ghost
[47:16] to take full control of us and the
[47:18] servants both speaker and hearer Lord
[47:21] Lord not just in the sanctuary Lord but
[47:24] father throughout the rest of this day
[47:26] Lord when we leave this place Lord let
[47:28] the word that's been sold Lord bring
[47:30] forth a h hundredfold Lord and we pray
[47:33] for the pastor Pastor Paul Lord you just
[47:36] continue to use them Lord in a mighty
[47:38] way to touch lives Lord and father all
[47:41] those that follow him Lord that they're
[47:43] following the spirit of Christ the voice
[47:45] of the Lord which is more than just the
[47:47] man because we as men and as women we
[47:50] have failures but with you leading Lord
[47:53] and you being the Forefront of Our Lives
[47:55] Lord L father it takes over anything
[47:58] that we can do as men and women so Lord
[48:01] God let the projection of Our Lives be
[48:03] the projection of Christ and Lord God we
[48:06] ask as we say so many times Lord forgive
[48:09] us for our sins Lord the trespasses Lord
[48:12] in our lives Lord the transgressions
[48:14] Lord the things that no one else sees
[48:16] but you Lord that may be a stench in
[48:18] your nostril Lord we ask that that blood
[48:20] would atone right now Lord that it will
[48:23] still be a sacrifice Lord amen for the
[48:26] covering in our lives Lord Jesus father
[48:29] we bless your name Lord God and we we're
[48:32] in expectation of what you will do with
[48:34] us in the
[48:35] service in the precious and Wonderful
[48:38] Name of Jesus Christ we pray Let the
[48:40] church say Amen the church say amen amen
[48:44] before we read amen I just want to give
[48:46] thanks to you all amen we we always
[48:50] enjoy ourselves and and and we feel so
[48:53] welcome when we come I I appreciate
[48:57] brother Paul so much you know because to
[49:01] me he's one of the brothers that I can
[49:05] truly say is a
[49:07] friend you know and uh you know God
[49:09] called Abraham friend Hallelujah you
[49:13] know but he called him friend through
[49:15] his
[49:16] trials amen and that's how you know who
[49:18] really is your friend amen when they can
[49:21] when they can still show their love no
[49:24] matter what you going through they may
[49:27] not even have an explanation for what
[49:29] you're going through but they still show
[49:31] their love amen and that's I feel about
[49:33] brother Paul you know I I really
[49:35] appreciate him you know I appreciate his
[49:37] wife his family his church family all of
[49:39] you guys amen because what I see when I
[49:42] come is I see the expression of love you
[49:45] know there's there's there's great gifts
[49:47] there's great Ministries you know that
[49:49] we're all different people we have our
[49:51] own individual personalities but what we
[49:54] should be reflecting is the love of God
[49:58] Amen church people say it all the time I
[50:00] want perfect love perfect love but you
[50:02] got to get there amen so I I really
[50:05] thank God for him and what he's doing
[50:07] and how God is using him I think we have
[50:11] to realize that you know David was a man
[50:14] of God's very own heart but the men that
[50:17] God gave to David was just as powerful
[50:20] as he
[50:22] was let's realize something David was
[50:25] was a giant
[50:26] killer but all the men that followed
[50:29] David were also giant
[50:31] Killers
[50:32] Hallelujah so you you need to consider
[50:35] what God is doing when you look at your
[50:37] pastor and you see the goodness of God
[50:39] and the grace of God you're a part of
[50:41] that which God is doing in his life so
[50:44] we appreciate him amen and I know it's
[50:46] pastor's appreciation and I just thank
[50:48] God for a good pastor cuz I have one
[50:50] amen but let's just uh get into the word
[50:53] of God today how many

[51:10] the Ohio
[51:13] rivalry Ohio and Michigan Let's Pretend

[51:50] is shining Hallelujah but it was shining
[51:54] yesterday yes it yes it was we have to
[51:58] look beyond the conditions
[52:00] amen uh St John 11 verse1 if you have it
[52:03] say
[52:04] Amen the Bible says now a certain man
[52:07] was sick named Lazareth of Bethany the
[52:10] town of Mary and his his sister M her
[52:14] sister Martha it was that Mary which
[52:18] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[52:20] wiped his feet with a hair whose brother
[52:23] Lazarus was sick there therefore for his
[52:25] sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold
[52:30] he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus
[52:33] heard that he said this sickness is not
[52:37] unto death but for the glory of God that
[52:42] the Son of God might be glorified
[52:45] thereby oh my praise the Lord let's go
[52:49] to Second
[52:53] Corinthians second
[52:56] Corinthians
[52:57] chapter I want chapter 12 2 Corinthians
[53:01] chapter
[53:03] 12 second Corinthians chapter
[53:17] 12 oh my praise the Lord 2 Corinthians
[53:20] 12
[53:22] and let's start reading that verse
[53:26] verse let's start at
[53:29] verse
[53:32] six 2 Corinthians 12 and6 the Bible says
[53:37] for though I will desire to Glory I
[53:39] shall not be a fool for I will say the
[53:44] truth but now I forbear lest any man
[53:47] should think of me above that which he
[53:50] seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
[53:55] and L I should be exalted above measure
[53:58] through the abundance of the
[54:00] Revelation there was given to me a thorn
[54:04] in the flesh the messenger of Satan to
[54:07] Buffet me lest I should be exalted above
[54:10] measure for this thing I besought the
[54:13] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[54:17] and he said unto me my grace is
[54:21] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[54:25] made perfect in
[54:26] weakness
[54:28] most gladly therefore I will rather
[54:31] glory in my infirmities that the power
[54:34] of Christ May rest upon me oh my let's
[54:38] read that again listen to what Paul says
[54:41] he says and he said unto me my grace is
[54:44] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[54:46] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[54:49] therefore will I rather glory in my
[54:52] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[54:54] rest rest upon me amen may the Lord the
[54:57] blessing reading of his word you can
[54:59] have your seats praise
[55:02] God let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[55:10] Praise amen this morning by the help of
[55:13] God I want to use for a subject a
[55:16] Overcomers
[55:19] attitude a
[55:21] Overcomers attitude you know I think
[55:24] that word attitude is very important to
[55:28] the Christian amen it's very important
[55:30] to our Christian walk our attitude even
[55:34] right now just being in church you know
[55:37] how you sit reflects your attitude you
[55:40] know how you how you worship when the
[55:42] songs were going forth it it it kind of
[55:45] tells me what your attitude is
[55:47] concerning worship you know uh uh
[55:49] depending on the event or what the event
[55:52] is and where it's at the clothes you put
[55:55] on tells me your attitude concerning
[55:58] that event you know so how attitude is
[56:00] very important Hallelujah you know your
[56:03] attitude uh per se can be uh known as or
[56:07] looked upon as a behavior Hallelujah you
[56:11] know one thing we hate when we tell our
[56:13] kids something sister spur we hate hallu
[56:16] to tell them something and they give us
[56:19] what an attitude oh you know that one
[56:21] huh they give us an attitude that attit
[56:25] means that they don't quite agree with
[56:27] what you're telling them to do and most
[56:30] times there's consequences and
[56:32] repercussions when you have an attitude
[56:35] Hallelujah so as a Believer if we could
[56:38] say this morning what kind of attitude
[56:41] should we have concerning the things of
[56:44] God and you know Hallelujah one of the
[56:47] uh Premier statements that our Prophet
[56:49] made is that the right mental attitude
[56:53] Hallelujah Hall Hallelujah the right
[56:56] mental attitude will bring any Divine
[57:00] promise of God to
[57:02] pass Hallelujah and I know right now
[57:06] some of you are needing something for
[57:08] God or you want God to do something but
[57:11] let me ask you this morning what is your
[57:14] attitude concerning God doing that for
[57:17] you Hallelujah cuz sometimes God will
[57:20] make it linger or God will do it just
[57:22] like that because of your attitude
[57:26] Hallelujah and you know church when we
[57:28] look in the scriptures one thing God
[57:31] hates is a bad
[57:32] attitude Hallelujah because one thing
[57:35] about God he knows what he's able to
[57:39] do and can you imagine us praying to God
[57:43] and asking him to do something and then
[57:45] we get an attitude because he don't do
[57:48] it when we ask him to do it now let's
[57:50] keep in mind he's well aware to do it
[57:54] can I get an amen your prayers your
[57:58] desires God is well aware to do it he's
[58:03] more than able to do it so why should we
[58:06] have an attitude that he's
[58:09] not amen this morning our attitude
[58:13] should be
[58:15] expectation hallu you say brother why do
[58:18] you say that well I'm going to give you
[58:19] a scripture Hallelujah that shows what
[58:22] our attitude should be like Hallelujah
[58:24] the scripture says wherever two or three
[58:27] are
[58:28] gathered I don't know about you but that
[58:30] does something to me Hallelujah he says
[58:33] wherever two or three what kind of two
[58:35] or three
[58:36] Believers wherever two or three
[58:39] Believers are gathered Hallelujah now I
[58:41] know I'm a Believer I believe brother
[58:43] Joe is a Believer I believe this
[58:45] brother's a Believer and this brother's
[58:46] a Believer this brother's a Believer so
[58:48] right now I got more than two or
[58:51] three Hallelujah I know she's a believer
[58:55] I know she's a Believer I know I know
[58:57] he's a
[58:58] Believer
[59:00] Hallelujah let's keep
[59:03] going Hallelujah wherever two or three
[59:07] are gathered in my name Hallelujah now I
[59:10] don't know how you come I don't know
[59:13] what you're believe in but I come in the
[59:15] name of Jesus Christ can I get a witness
[59:19] can I get a witness that we're all here
[59:22] because of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we
[59:24] come and We Gather in the name of Jesus
[59:28] Christ can I get an amen we are gathered
[59:32] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[59:35] Christ two or three I don't know about
[59:37] it's maybe 150 to 200 in here I don't
[59:41] know about the
[59:42] other 147 but I know I got
[59:47] three
[59:50] huj and then the Bible says I only need
[59:52] two Hallelujah so if I'm not sure about
[59:55] the rest of y'all I got my daughter I
[59:57] know she's a Believer hallelujah
[1:00:00] hallelujah so I ain't got time to
[1:00:01] question whether you believe or not I'm
[1:00:04] a grab hold of somebody I know that can
[1:00:06] make this word come to pass with
[1:00:09] me
[1:00:11] Hallelujah so two or three of us are
[1:00:15] gathered in his name in the name of
[1:00:17] Jesus
[1:00:18] Christ then the Bible says hallelujah if
[1:00:22] those two or three
[1:00:25] would touch and agree concerning
[1:00:30] anything that's my attitude Hallelujah
[1:00:33] if I find somebody in here this morning
[1:00:35] let me get Gideon Hallelujah if I find
[1:00:38] somebody who can agree can touch and
[1:00:40] agree with me the Bible says that we can
[1:00:43] have what we ask
[1:00:46] for that should be our attitude this
[1:00:49] morning that if we touch and agree
[1:00:52] concerning anything in the name of name
[1:00:54] of
[1:00:55] Jesus we should have it Hallelujah but
[1:01:00] what God has to do he has to Hallelujah
[1:01:03] bounce our attitudes Hallelujah God has
[1:01:06] to put us in check cuz a lot of times
[1:01:09] we're not looking at things how God is
[1:01:11] looking at
[1:01:12] it anybody got
[1:01:15] trials anybody got
[1:01:17] pain Hallelujah and sometimes that trial
[1:01:21] and that pain will affect your attitude
[1:01:28] but I'm here to say hallelujah that pain
[1:01:31] can be a
[1:01:32] blessing
[1:01:33] W Hallelujah trials and tribulation can
[1:01:37] be a blessing Hallelujah suffering
[1:01:40] trouble can be a blessing Hallelujah
[1:01:43] because it's by those things that God
[1:01:46] can't help but come on the
[1:01:50] scene
[1:01:52] Hallelujah but what we have to do we
[1:01:54] have to Solomon we have to adjust our
[1:01:56] attitude while we're suffering we have
[1:01:58] to adjust our attitude while we're going
[1:02:00] through pain we have to adjust our
[1:02:02] attitude while there's trouble in your
[1:02:04] life Hallelujah cuz I'm going give you
[1:02:06] another scripture the Bible says he'll
[1:02:09] put no more on
[1:02:12] you oh my do I got a church in here this
[1:02:16] morning he'll put no more on you than
[1:02:19] you can bear so my attitude should
[1:02:22] reflect that whatever I'm going through
[1:02:24] I can overcome it whatever I'm going
[1:02:27] through is there to make me stronger
[1:02:30] whatever I'm going through is only for a
[1:02:33] period of time it's not forever
[1:02:35] Hallelujah so our attitudes are to
[1:02:38] reflect that God is in
[1:02:41] control oh my but what we do we get in
[1:02:45] the moment what's the key thing that
[1:02:48] messes up your attitude the key thing
[1:02:50] that messes up our attitude is this
[1:02:53] thing called your imagination oh
[1:02:58] yeah let me show you how powerful the
[1:03:01] imagination can be remember the story of
[1:03:04] the garden well and y'all forgive me I'm
[1:03:07] not a pool pit preacher I'm a walker
[1:03:09] Hallelujah my attitude is to walk
[1:03:12] Hallelujah my attitude is to connect
[1:03:14] with your spirits you didn't know that
[1:03:16] was going on Hallelujah watch me good
[1:03:18] I'm going to places where people are
[1:03:22] pulling if you want me on your you got
[1:03:24] in the pull hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:03:27] want me to talk to you you got the pull
[1:03:29] amen if you if your attitude is just to
[1:03:31] say brother di preaching that's all you
[1:03:33] going to get is some preaching
[1:03:34] Hallelujah but if your attitude is Lord
[1:03:37] let him talk to
[1:03:39] me Lord let him talk to me something
[1:03:42] will begin to direct my feet towards
[1:03:44] your
[1:03:46] path what is it you're pull H you pull
[1:03:50] what happens I preach you pull I preach
[1:03:52] you pull I preach you quit I stop you
[1:03:55] resist I
[1:04:01] sniff so there's three different levels
[1:04:04] in here this morning for your attitude
[1:04:06] that's
[1:04:07] right Hallelujah but you know church
[1:04:10] when we look at these things and and we
[1:04:12] appreciate what God is doing the pre the
[1:04:15] primary thing that affects our attitude
[1:04:18] is our imagination now let's get this
[1:04:21] straight Hallelujah and the key thing
[1:04:23] Hallelujah
[1:04:24] that that that motivates and move your
[1:04:26] imagination is
[1:04:31] fear
[1:04:34] Hallelujah you said oh when I get to
[1:04:36] heaven it's going to be such a rejoicing
[1:04:38] Hallelujah in the beginning we didn't
[1:04:40] need an imagination for
[1:04:44] that Adam was created in the image of
[1:04:46] God the likeness of God so he didn't had
[1:04:49] to I can only
[1:04:52] imagine what it be
[1:04:54] like surrounded by Your glory what would
[1:04:59] my life
[1:05:00] be we didn't have to
[1:05:03] imagine Adam was in the presence of God
[1:05:05] every day it worked like clockwork he
[1:05:09] knew what the voice of God was he didn't
[1:05:11] have to pray about whether this is God
[1:05:13] or not when he heard it he knew it was
[1:05:16] God there was no imagination there it
[1:05:19] was only
[1:05:23] reality God so what brought forth an
[1:05:28] imagination the
[1:05:30] fall are you with me church so let's be
[1:05:34] careful where we are in our attitudes
[1:05:37] today now we know that Satan wanted to
[1:05:40] get into uh God's he wanted to get in
[1:05:44] God's way so he got in creation he used
[1:05:47] Eve Hallelujah cuz she was the weaker
[1:05:49] vessel no matter how you want to say it
[1:05:51] Hallelujah she was the weaker vessel so
[1:05:55] Satan came to her first cuz he knew he
[1:05:57] could influence her
[1:06:00] attitude because when he saw Adam he saw
[1:06:03] the same one that kicked him out of
[1:06:04] heaven so his attitude was and it's
[1:06:07] always been and it shall be to this day
[1:06:10] I'm not messing with that Son of
[1:06:14] God hallelujah when the devil saw Adam
[1:06:17] he said I'm not messing with that Son of
[1:06:20] God and when you get the holy spirit
[1:06:22] inside of you it's still the same
[1:06:25] attitude concerning a Son of God the
[1:06:28] devil won't mess with you if you know
[1:06:30] who you
[1:06:33] are
[1:06:34] Hallelujah
[1:06:36] so we know the story they sin they fall
[1:06:39] into sin and now the next thing starts
[1:06:41] to happen they go from a reality to an
[1:06:46] imagination What do they do fear came in
[1:06:49] Hallelujah although adultery was the
[1:06:51] first act fear was the first Act
[1:06:53] attribute of
[1:06:56] sin Hallelujah and now in this day in
[1:06:59] this time even right now while I'm
[1:07:01] preaching on it some of you need to
[1:07:03] overcome your
[1:07:04] fears there are things in your life
[1:07:06] Hallelujah that's holding you back from
[1:07:08] giving God your all there are things in
[1:07:11] your life Hallelujah that's holding your
[1:07:13] marriage back there are things in your
[1:07:14] life that's holding your worship back
[1:07:16] there are things in your life that
[1:07:18] holding your life back what is it it's
[1:07:22] fear
[1:07:25] but what the enemy has done he's given
[1:07:27] it a a a proper
[1:07:30] name he's given it a proper name and now
[1:07:34] we've accepted
[1:07:36] it and doctors have given it a proper
[1:07:39] name Hallelujah Physicians and and
[1:07:42] psychologists all these people have
[1:07:43] given it a proper name and now we've
[1:07:46] accepted the spirit what's the proper
[1:07:48] name it's called
[1:07:52] anxiety
[1:07:55] we hear people confess it all the time
[1:07:57] my
[1:07:58] anxiety my anxiety oh I just my anxiety
[1:08:03] when I get there it's just my anxiety
[1:08:05] let me tell you something that's just
[1:08:08] fear and fear comes from where the devil
[1:08:12] Hallelujah and if it came from the devil
[1:08:14] it's a part of your imagination and if
[1:08:17] it came from the devil it doesn't have
[1:08:19] an origin of creation it's a
[1:08:22] perversion
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:27] I want to strip the enemy so bad today
[1:08:29] that we walk out of here
[1:08:32] like we be doing a goose step in the
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:41] spirit listen God says hallelujah
[1:08:46] through a Vindicated Prophet that Satan
[1:08:49] cannot
[1:08:49] create all he can do is pervert so fear
[1:08:53] here is not a
[1:08:55] creation and if it doesn't have an
[1:08:58] origin I'm going to say something that's
[1:09:00] going to shock you if it doesn't have an
[1:09:02] origin is it really
[1:09:06] real if it's not a creation is it really
[1:09:12] real if it's not a creation it's a
[1:09:16] perversion of other creation is it
[1:09:19] really real cuz if you turn it around to
[1:09:23] what it really supposed to be then you
[1:09:25] have the substance of it Hallelujah but
[1:09:28] once you live in the life of it after
[1:09:30] it's been converted it's a
[1:09:35] lie how many of us today are living a
[1:09:39] lie I'm talking about the attitude of an
[1:09:42] overcomer Hallelujah but
[1:09:45] listen God comes down in the cool of the
[1:09:49] day like he's always did like he like
[1:09:52] he's always done
[1:09:54] Hallelujah even after Hallelujah sin
[1:09:57] came in God in his faithfulness
[1:10:00] Hallelujah his attitude was these are my
[1:10:04] children Hallelujah and I'm not going to
[1:10:06] let sin affect our relationship
[1:10:09] Hallelujah it'll affect our fellowship
[1:10:12] but it's not going to affect our
[1:10:13] relationship God looked at Adam and Eve
[1:10:16] still as a son and a
[1:10:20] daughter oh my how many of us can look
[1:10:23] at one another as children as people of
[1:10:26] God with certain things in our life that
[1:10:28] we might
[1:10:30] see but we do we look at one another say
[1:10:33] oh man did you hear my brother so and so
[1:10:35] you hear what he going through he must
[1:10:37] be the
[1:10:40] devil God didn't call Adam the
[1:10:44] devil he didn't call Eve the
[1:10:47] devil but what did he do he called him
[1:10:50] by the name he originally gave them
[1:10:55] he didn't say sinner sinner where are
[1:10:59] thou adulterer adulterer where are thou
[1:11:03] unbeliever unbeliever where are thou but
[1:11:06] he said Adam Adam where are thou so even
[1:11:11] after he fell into sin God didn't live
[1:11:13] in imagination God lived in
[1:11:22] reality
[1:11:24] and I want to live in my
[1:11:27] reality and God has made me an
[1:11:31] overcomer God has made you an overcomer
[1:11:34] and that should be our
[1:11:37] attitude not succumbing to the
[1:11:39] imagination of
[1:11:42] anxiety you know there are people among
[1:11:44] us who don't like to be around
[1:11:46] crowds oh I just I just get afraid when
[1:11:49] I'm around too many
[1:11:52] people don't get
[1:11:55] afraid that's just who you are you like
[1:11:57] to be
[1:12:01] alone what is I get the terms mixed up
[1:12:06] uh
[1:12:08] introvert extrovert Hallelujah now you
[1:12:11] may look at me and you say he has to be
[1:12:14] an
[1:12:15] extrovert has to be cuz he's loud he's
[1:12:19] wow he's all over the place he just
[1:12:21] loves to be around and something happen
[1:12:26] uhuhuh that's just the
[1:12:28] gift but who I am I just like to be by
[1:12:31] myself sometimes H I just like to think
[1:12:34] about what's going on sometimes but that
[1:12:36] shouldn't produce a fear in your life
[1:12:39] Hallelujah that's just Hallelujah a part
[1:12:41] of how God Made You Hallelujah like we
[1:12:44] may have some people that like to shout
[1:12:46] and dance and worship Hallelujah you
[1:12:48] have some people who just like to lift
[1:12:49] their hands and cry you have some people
[1:12:51] who like to stare
[1:13:03] now the staring one is a challenge for
[1:13:05] me
[1:13:07] hallelujah hallelujah unless you got a
[1:13:10] strong pull in your stair Hallelujah but
[1:13:14] then there are some people who don't say
[1:13:16] a word but you can feel a
[1:13:18] connection hallelujah amen they're just
[1:13:22] dare their expectation they're on the
[1:13:24] edge of their seat and they're saying
[1:13:25] amen my brother inside amen my brother
[1:13:28] inside Hallelujah my brother inside
[1:13:31] thank you Jesus my brother inside and
[1:13:33] the minister can feel it
[1:13:35] Hallelujah even the worshippers can feel
[1:13:38] those who really have a spirit of
[1:13:40] worship in their heart and they may not
[1:13:43] be they may just be doing
[1:13:46] us Lord let them
[1:13:49] worship let your praise flow to me
[1:13:56] but it's connecting Hallelujah but you
[1:13:58] look at how God hallelujah how God now
[1:14:01] remember I'm dealing with an attitude
[1:14:03] first you look at how God hallelujah
[1:14:06] look at his attitude towards Adam and
[1:14:08] Eve after the
[1:14:09] fall after sin came into their life God
[1:14:13] didn't move in an imaginary
[1:14:16] Mode God remained the same Hallelujah he
[1:14:20] still wanted Fellowship
[1:14:24] yeah but oh my God told Paul Hallelujah
[1:14:28] my grace is sufficient for you
[1:14:30] Hallelujah don't worry about what's
[1:14:32] going on in your life my grace is
[1:14:34] sufficient I have this there for a
[1:14:36] purpose can you believe it church God
[1:14:39] allowed the fall for a
[1:14:42] purpose so we would just be Angels but
[1:14:45] we would be Sons and Daughters of
[1:14:49] redemption to know what it means to come
[1:14:52] through things and still feel the love
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:56] God to know what it means to have
[1:14:59] failures in your life and God still show
[1:15:01] up as a
[1:15:06] deliverer oh
[1:15:08] my I want to I want to I want to I want
[1:15:11] to caution you don't wait 45 minutes to
[1:15:14] get into what I'm
[1:15:16] saying cuz I might be quitting by then
[1:15:19] cuz y'all know right now I'm about to
[1:15:22] close
[1:15:24] hallelujah what we do our attitudes is
[1:15:26] it's like brother say something I've
[1:15:29] never
[1:15:32] heard give me something that can
[1:15:34] challenge my
[1:15:37] mind the challenge to God is not in your
[1:15:41] mind the challenge to God is deliver it
[1:15:43] from your
[1:15:45] heart
[1:15:46] Hallelujah see fear Hallelujah can
[1:15:50] conquer your
[1:15:51] mind that's right Hallelujah
[1:15:54] how many athletes have become
[1:15:57] Hallelujah gold medalists and champions
[1:15:59] Hallelujah because they played the game
[1:16:02] or they they they they lived through the
[1:16:04] game from what was in their heart they
[1:16:07] conquered what their fears they overcame
[1:16:11] what their anxieties hallelujah what did
[1:16:13] it reflect their attitude they have
[1:16:16] something Hallelujah in the sports world
[1:16:19] where they call that man that woman she
[1:16:21] must be a dog
[1:16:26] y'all heard that
[1:16:29] expression a dog means that they going
[1:16:31] to grab hold of

[1:17:07] children's bread to that dog but look at
[1:17:10] her look at the attitude of a dog
[1:17:12] Hallelujah she says truth Lord but the
[1:17:15] dog eat from the crown eat the crowns
[1:17:18] from the table of the

[1:18:36] around a
[1:18:40] Chihuahua Hallelujah so it's just like
[1:18:43] what the prophet said it ain't the size
[1:18:45] of the dog it's the size of the fight
[1:18:46] that's in the dog H cuz you step in a
[1:18:49] room Hallelujah with a Rowdy wild
[1:18:52] Chihuahua and he'll let you know El

[1:19:20] has made me I'm going to display that
[1:19:22] that's my attit think about it Church
[1:19:24] the attitude of a Chihuahua he's this
[1:19:27] big but his attitude is like
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:30] this Hallelujah his attitude is the
[1:19:34] attitude of a of a of a St
[1:19:37] Bernard Co
[1:19:46] Jo
[1:19:48] Hallelujah but we look at Hallelujah
[1:19:51] God's attitude
[1:19:53] once the imagination of the believer
[1:19:56] came into sight God didn't change God
[1:19:59] knew they was going to experience pain
[1:20:02] but his attitude didn't change God was
[1:20:04] going to use the pain to make them an
[1:20:06] overcomer H but what he has to do he has
[1:20:09] to allow us to look through his lens
[1:20:12] that's the only way we're going to
[1:20:13] overcome Hallelujah because look fear is
[1:20:17] not connected to your
[1:20:20] flesh no it's not connected to your
[1:20:24] flesh it's connected to that inward man
[1:20:27] H what's stopping you from touching the
[1:20:30] stove again hallelujah it's not your
[1:20:33] five senses it's your
[1:20:37] memory Hallelujah see it's your memory
[1:20:40] first then touch comes into place so
[1:20:43] fear deals with the inward man that's
[1:20:46] why fear can be a
[1:20:51] torment
[1:20:53] and too often the devil hasn't even done
[1:20:57] anything but our imagination makes it
[1:20:59] run
[1:21:01] wild and here just to say what I'm
[1:21:04] saying hallelujah God comes down and he
[1:21:06] says Adam Adam where are thou his
[1:21:08] faithfulness is God
[1:21:10] faithful I want you to testify is God
[1:21:13] faithful Hallelujah is God
[1:21:16] faithful he's faithful to conquer your
[1:21:20] fears Hallelujah let's live in a reality
[1:21:24] today as an overcomer look God comes
[1:21:27] down he says Adam Adam where are thou he
[1:21:30] didn't call them by the sin they just
[1:21:34] produced he called them by the
[1:21:36] revelation of who they
[1:21:38] were
[1:21:40] Hallelujah Adam Adam where are thou and
[1:21:44] then he comes down and the first thing
[1:21:46] they begin to say Lord we hid ourselves
[1:21:50] because we were naked now God is f to
[1:21:53] address their attitudes their thinking
[1:21:55] first thing God says is who told you you
[1:21:58] was
[1:22:00] naked because God didn't give them that
[1:22:03] kind of exposure Hallelujah so if
[1:22:06] there's something you're fearing God
[1:22:08] didn't put it in there hallelujah it's
[1:22:11] something that's perverted you allowed
[1:22:13] to be perverted in your life and it's
[1:22:15] stopping you from making a contact with
[1:22:19] God he said who told you was naked
[1:22:24] but before we get to that part listen to
[1:22:27] what they say look at their attitude
[1:22:28] they say we heard you we heard your
[1:22:31] voice in the garden now the question is
[1:22:34] hadn't they always heard his voice in
[1:22:35] the
[1:22:37] garden so that didn't change still the
[1:22:40] same God we heard your voice in the
[1:22:42] garden and we ran and hid ourselves so
[1:22:46] what happened between them always
[1:22:48] hearing God's voice and now they're
[1:22:50] running hiding themselves what came in
[1:22:52] me
[1:22:55] fear fear will cause you to run from God
[1:22:58] when God is trying to have
[1:23:00] Fellowship fear will cause you to run
[1:23:03] from God when God is trying to be
[1:23:05] faithful Hallelujah are you with me
[1:23:09] Church Hallelujah and now Hallelujah God
[1:23:12] says who told you was naked and the
[1:23:14] first we do we start to blame somebody
[1:23:18] else when you the one going through it
[1:23:21] I'm going to give you a pre example of
[1:23:23] something I like talking about and I
[1:23:24] probably said this here before
[1:23:26] Hallelujah but it's just a part of my
[1:23:28] Ministry so I'll say it
[1:23:31] again real
[1:23:33] Deliverance is not you running from what
[1:23:36] you're delivered
[1:23:40] from say brother what do you mean if God
[1:23:44] delivered you from being a smoker hallah
[1:23:46] you're not running from cigarette packs
[1:23:48] in the
[1:23:49] Walmart I can't go down that aisle
[1:23:51] cigarettes are down
[1:23:54] right I seen a I seen a mar pack
[1:24:01] out that's not Deliverance that's
[1:24:06] fear I was in a restaurant one time
[1:24:09] eating with a brother I was preaching
[1:24:11] for him that weekend and we were sitting
[1:24:13] in we sitting in a restaurant and you
[1:24:14] know how they have music playing in the
[1:24:19] restaurant you know coughman you know
[1:24:22] how that brother was hitting that field
[1:24:27] yesterday you know that was in our
[1:24:29] spirit when we got back my daughter
[1:24:30] couldn't
[1:24:34] stop we almost got in the hotel
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:47] went the music was in my spirit H but it
[1:24:52] was a joyous
[1:24:54] sound Hallelujah see that's what real
[1:24:57] worship should do it should bring a joy
[1:25:00] in your life it shouldn't make you
[1:25:02] depressed or
[1:25:03] judgmental real worship that is but
[1:25:07] anyway I'm going to leave that alone cuz
[1:25:08] I know we got to all everybody has a
[1:25:10] difference of
[1:25:14] opinione and my thing is why is it so
[1:25:16] hard cuz the Bible says hallelujah in
[1:25:19] the mind of God we all shouted and dance
[1:25:22] for
[1:25:23] joy in the mind of God hallelujah now
[1:25:26] what was the Rhythm in God's mind I
[1:25:28] don't know but I know I was
[1:25:31] there brother Kenny I don't know but I
[1:25:33] knew I was there so I worship in God's
[1:25:36] mind all I can do is do it here on this
[1:25:40] side it ain't my job to explain to you
[1:25:42] why I worship the way I worship
[1:25:44] Hallelujah just let me be
[1:25:47] free Hallelujah cuz I know what it's
[1:25:50] like to be bound to rap music
[1:25:53] when it come
[1:26:02] on I know what it's
[1:26:04] like huah some of you folks in here know
[1:26:07] what it's like to be bound by country
[1:26:10] music what do you mean to be bound
[1:26:12] country music has a spirit of depression
[1:26:15] on
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:18] it and you think oh man I just love G
[1:26:21] Brooks he's just
[1:26:23] oh my boyfriend left me and my
[1:26:25] girlfriend
[1:26:29] gone they always singing about their
[1:26:32] pain and Taylor Swift all her broken
[1:26:39] relationships there's a spirit on
[1:26:40] everything
[1:26:42] Hallelujah but let me leave that alone
[1:26:44] Hallelujah I let him do
[1:26:47] that H well better yet I should be able
[1:26:50] to do it let me take the licks as an
[1:26:52] evangelist Amen Let me take the links
[1:26:54] Hallelujah cuz the prophet of God said
[1:26:56] the Evangelist he comes and stands
[1:26:59] between you and the enemy that's right
[1:27:01] Hallelujah and if there's any kind of
[1:27:03] spirit in the land that's trying to stop
[1:27:05] the people from worshiping that's an
[1:27:07] evil
[1:27:12] spirit Hallelujah cuz Through the Bible
[1:27:16] Hallelujah you know the scripture that
[1:27:18] says the battle is not yours but it's
[1:27:20] the Lord's before you get to that
[1:27:23] scripture God said you're going to go
[1:27:25] through the battle but you're not going
[1:27:27] to fight just go there and
[1:27:31] worship go back and read it before they
[1:27:34] even fought the Battle Hallelujah they
[1:27:36] sent singers and worshippers out there
[1:27:38] first to prophesy the victory through
[1:27:43] music Hallelujah and sometimes the gifts
[1:27:47] in the church don't start operating till
[1:27:49] a good song is played yeah
[1:27:52] what do you mean that happened with the
[1:27:54] prophet Hallelujah the prophet was angry
[1:27:56] and he said bring me a Minstrel and when
[1:27:59] they brought the minist his gift start
[1:28:01] the working
[1:28:03] W so let's be careful how we judge
[1:28:06] things let's be careful with our
[1:28:08] attitudes concerning individual
[1:28:13] worship Hallelujah cuz David Hallelujah
[1:28:16] when he worshiped his worship was so
[1:28:18] powerful Hallelujah it drove off an evil
[1:28:21] spirit that God put on
[1:28:28] somebody that mean in that moment
[1:28:31] Hallelujah he was so much like God he
[1:28:34] could tell the spirit what to do through
[1:28:35] his
[1:28:37] Worship in one place God said you can
[1:28:41] over Oh my he said through the prophet
[1:28:44] you can overcome
[1:28:47] God I thought that's all I was going to
[1:28:49] get is a
[1:28:51] my ah
[1:28:54] my my my means I don't know if that's
[1:29:00] true
[1:29:02] my if you believed it you would have
[1:29:04] said
[1:29:06] amen let me address your mind all right
[1:29:10] God being overcome by a desperate
[1:29:14] believer we know the story of Jacob to
[1:29:18] Israel look at his attitude how do he
[1:29:21] overcome Hallelujah he started to
[1:29:23] wrestle with God and he said I'm not
[1:29:25] going to let you go until you bless me
[1:29:27] now he kept saying Turn Me Loose turn me
[1:29:29] loose he said no not until you bless me
[1:29:32] turn me loose turn me loose no not until
[1:29:34] you bless me turn me loose turn me loose
[1:29:36] no not until you bless
[1:29:41] me when did he turn him loose after he
[1:29:45] got the blessing so he
[1:29:48] overcame W that's what the prophet of
[1:29:51] God said the prophet God said he
[1:29:53] overcame God in that
[1:29:55] moment Hallelujah and that one ain't
[1:29:58] good enough for you let me keep going
[1:30:01] cuz I feel your thoughts Hallelujah some
[1:30:03] of you are in that in that message Zone
[1:30:04] I don't know did the prophet say that I
[1:30:08] don't know
[1:30:12] maybe your attitude the right mental
[1:30:16] attitude can even change God's mind for
[1:30:19] that
[1:30:20] moment hallelujah hallelujah you said oh
[1:30:25] my boy I feel the expectation in here
[1:30:29] Glory Hallelujah it's coming as a
[1:30:31] resistance but I feel it
[1:30:34] ah Hallelujah think about the church God
[1:30:37] comes to Hezekiah he say hey it's your
[1:30:39] time it's time to go life is over and
[1:30:42] then Hezekiah goes into prayer and he
[1:30:44] says God you know my heart you know my
[1:30:48] life I walked perfect before you now I
[1:30:51] need more more time and the prophet was
[1:30:53] walking out and the prophet spin back
[1:30:54] around and came back God said go tell
[1:30:56] Hezekiah I've given him 15 more
[1:31:01] years what look at his
[1:31:06] attitude hezekiah's attitude made God
[1:31:08] change his
[1:31:11] mind what about your attitude Hallelujah
[1:31:15] but Church like I say we was in a
[1:31:20] restaurant
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:29] brother say oh brother DS I'm sorry I'm
[1:31:32] sorry brother di for the

[1:32:22] bothering you it'll get louder and
[1:32:25] louder you know why it gets louder
[1:32:27] because you're
[1:32:30] afraid it gets louder and louder
[1:32:33] Hallelujah but then he says Oh Brother D
[1:32:35] Brother D I'm so sorry the music is just
[1:32:37] out of control I say look brother this
[1:32:39] music is not bothering me it's bothering
[1:32:41] you I didn't have to overcome rock and
[1:32:44] roll I had to overcome R&B and rap now
[1:32:47] if this was Tupac it would be
[1:32:50] different right if if this was Mary J BL
[1:32:52] it'll be different but I don't know
[1:32:55] nothing about Van Halen and
[1:33:00] whoever it don't bother

[1:33:40] got a problem stand alone and and and
[1:33:44] speak your mind don't try to gather
[1:33:46] whole church like a
[1:33:49] coward that's what's wrong with all the
[1:33:51] people that are leaving the message they
[1:33:52] can't leave quietly on their own they
[1:33:54] got to try to influence everybody else
[1:33:57] why cuz they don't believe in
[1:34:01] themselves they need a group of people
[1:34:03] to make them feel good in their
[1:34:08] imagination I told you i' take the
[1:34:13] leaks Hallelujah I didn't took him
[1:34:16] before a Leck is a
[1:34:19] Leck Hallelujah see I'm used the licks

[1:34:29] good Hallelujah but you know Church
[1:34:33] Hallelujah we'll go through things and
[1:34:35] we'll experience pain but we're not
[1:34:37] supposed to be running from it see real
[1:34:40] Deliverance you'll stand back and you'll
[1:34:41] look at it and say this what God brought
[1:34:43] me through and you'll look it in the
[1:34:45] face and you'll say you know what rock
[1:34:47] and roll you have no power over
[1:34:50] me Hallelujah I go sit right down in um
[1:34:55] I can't think of a restaurant that has a
[1:34:56] bar in
[1:34:58] it Hallelujah Applebees I go to sit
[1:35:01] right down in Applebees and order my
[1:35:03] chicken and fries and eat it and feel
[1:35:05] good about it and say oh that was
[1:35:08] nice Hallelujah with no temptation to go
[1:35:13] by the album of the word of music that I
[1:35:15] heard playing on that
[1:35:19] radio that's when you've
[1:35:22] overcome Hallelujah when you overcome
[1:35:26] you're not running from your
[1:35:28] imagination see your imagination creates
[1:35:30] things that are not even
[1:35:36] true people in their minds they go
[1:35:39] through things and they go through
[1:35:41] troubles and and Trauma uh in their
[1:35:44] lives oh my I feel like committing
[1:35:47] suicide that's a lying devil talking to
[1:35:50] you
[1:35:52] what is that that's fear that's the
[1:35:54] imagination of fear what have you done
[1:35:57] to Merit
[1:35:59] suicide nothing it's the enemy trying to
[1:36:02] pervert your pain when your pain should
[1:36:05] be there to make you
[1:36:11] stronger if I can cuz I'm feeling us you
[1:36:13] take a woman who who has a baby and she
[1:36:16] starts to go through
[1:36:20] postpartum
[1:36:21] depression
[1:36:23] stress look that shouldn't be happening
[1:36:27] right because the Bible there's no
[1:36:29] scripture for postpartum depression H
[1:36:32] the Bible says hallelujah when a woman
[1:36:35] is in travail Hallelujah she can
[1:36:38] experience the pain she experience the
[1:36:39] hurt the agony all the things she's
[1:36:41] going through while she's in travail but
[1:36:43] it's that travail that lets her know a
[1:36:46] birth is about to happen hallelujah it's
[1:36:49] the pain and all the things she's going
[1:36:51] through that let her know she's about to
[1:36:54] step into a new era of Life Hallelujah
[1:36:57] and he says what's the child is born she
[1:37:00] doesn't even remember the pain
[1:37:04] anymore Hallelujah now that's
[1:37:08] scripture you carried it for months and
[1:37:11] weeks after your child's been born
[1:37:13] that's a spirit on
[1:37:17] you and I say this morning that there's
[1:37:20] enough power one here because there's
[1:37:22] two or three of us that we can touch and
[1:37:25] degree and people can be delivered even
[1:37:28] the one you praying about can be
[1:37:32] delivered
[1:37:33] Hallelujah but let's look into it
[1:37:35] everybody all
[1:37:37] right now I can get into my
[1:37:44] message oh my I pull that first quote
[1:37:48] up I ain't going to be too much longer
[1:37:51] listen listen he says we always get what
[1:37:53] we expect when people expect anything
[1:37:56] well then they usually get what you look
[1:37:59] for it's the mental attitude that you
[1:38:02] have remember this remember this church
[1:38:06] remember this and never forget it the
[1:38:09] right mental attitude towards any
[1:38:11] promise of God will bring it to pass the
[1:38:14] right midle attitude towards any promise
[1:38:17] of God that I will you in your SE to
[1:38:21] think of a promise that you need from
[1:38:26] God and he says the right mental
[1:38:28] attitude of bring it to
[1:38:30] pass what does the right middle attitude
[1:38:33] look like you can take that down we're
[1:38:36] going to go back to John chapter 11 and
[1:38:39] I'm going hit this quick and I'm going
[1:38:40] get out the way cuz I believe you you
[1:38:43] you you understand what I'm talking
[1:38:44] about see the first part of the service
[1:38:47] was deliberately dealing with Spirits
[1:38:51] right
[1:38:51] right you know why because I've learned
[1:38:55] Hallelujah for people to get Deliverance
[1:38:58] you have to poke at the
[1:39:02] Devil you have to poke at him make him
[1:39:05] upset Hallelujah and let him know I see
[1:39:09] you you've been hiding and L your life
[1:39:12] too long but you spirit of fear today is
[1:39:15] your
[1:39:17] day to be conquered by
[1:39:20] faith
[1:39:22] usually demons like to hide they'll hide
[1:39:26] under good worship I've been I've been
[1:39:28] in Services where Hallelujah we've
[1:39:30] preached in this line of matter and
[1:39:31] they' come up to sing and the lead the
[1:39:34] one leading the songs were demon
[1:39:37] possessed but nobody knew it because she
[1:39:39] had a good
[1:39:40] voice but she had things in her life she
[1:39:42] was going through that didn't make her
[1:39:44] unbeliever that means that the word came
[1:39:46] to give her a
[1:39:48] cleansing oh my my alarm going off
[1:39:56] man how time flies when you're having
[1:40:00] fun am I all

[1:40:57] that roast beef and them
[1:41:01] Donuts but listen let's look at the
[1:41:04] attitude of an overcomer first things
[1:41:07] first Christ always Hallelujah tries to
[1:41:11] get us to look at how he's
[1:41:13] thinking can I get Amen in any situation
[1:41:17] Hallelujah that we go through which may
[1:41:19] produce pain let's understand something
[1:41:21] about pain pain has a contrast to
[1:41:25] it there's a contrast to pain H pain is
[1:41:30] dead to bring forth a
[1:41:35] healing we use the term growing
[1:41:38] pains and all of us we had to grow into
[1:41:41] adults but growing into adults there was
[1:41:44] a lot of pain there was a lot of
[1:41:46] struggles some of us couldn't get our
[1:41:48] finances together some of us chose the
[1:41:50] wrong people when we were young we went
[1:41:51] through different things pain pain pain
[1:41:54] but it made us who we
[1:41:56] are
[1:41:58] hallelujah oh my you know what if I
[1:42:00] could say this what I'm tired of I'm
[1:42:02] tired of the enemy coming to trying to
[1:42:05] divide Us by our
[1:42:10] personalities the common goal is that we
[1:42:13] love Jesus
[1:42:14] Christ Hallelujah why should I look at
[1:42:17] you different because you're not as
[1:42:19] radical as me on
[1:42:22] you are on the inside
[1:42:25] though on the inside you
[1:42:30] like I can feel it Hallelujah because
[1:42:33] I'm not creating this atmosphere you
[1:42:36] are Hallelujah but what the flesh tries
[1:42:39] to do is say well this ain't God because
[1:42:41] you ain't on your feet that's a
[1:42:44] lie or you say this is God because
[1:42:46] you're on your feet that could be a
[1:42:48] lie and what the enemy see preachers
[1:42:51] shouldn't be coming try to separate us
[1:42:53] based upon our
[1:42:55] personalities because Peter and Paul
[1:42:58] were completely different but when they
[1:43:00] met they had the same goal which was the
[1:43:02] death Buri and resurrection of Jesus
[1:43:05] [Applause]
[1:43:10] Christ well well brother you know I love
[1:43:15] the way brother Paul said can you say
[1:43:18] Amen am man
[1:43:26] you know I got to get them
[1:43:27] back cuz when he preach a message he
[1:43:29] start shouting like me my this brother
[1:43:37] digs and then said somebody call him and
[1:43:39] show it to
[1:43:41] him see only a friend could do that he
[1:43:44] knew I wouldn't be offended so I called
[1:43:47] I said brother that message was good it
[1:43:48] was just one thing I didn't appreciate
[1:43:54] Hallelujah but friends can do that and
[1:43:56] not be offended Hallelujah and you think
[1:43:59] about how how how many times somebody
[1:44:01] has been your friend and they told you
[1:44:03] something you needed to hear you got
[1:44:05] offended and cut the Friendship
[1:44:08] off you weren really a
[1:44:11] friend you were an
[1:44:17] associate like I say a friend can stick
[1:44:19] with you through your good do your
[1:44:21] bad a friend can stick with you when
[1:44:24] you're going through some pain that they
[1:44:26] don't even have an answer for but what
[1:44:28] he can say is well even in this moment
[1:44:30] I'mma still be your
[1:44:34] friend what it is is in the message of
[1:44:37] the hour we got too many eleases in the
[1:44:40] church you know who he was he was Joe's
[1:44:43] buddy and when Jo start going through
[1:44:46] nobody had an answer but what happened
[1:44:48] to his message believing friends they
[1:44:51] turn their backs on him when it was God
[1:44:54] in the midst of the
[1:44:55] pain they had the wrong
[1:45:01] attitude oh my church let's let's let's
[1:45:05] look at it St John

[1:45:12] right oh my running out of time

[1:46:43] hallelujah
[1:46:45] look it says and it was the Mary which
[1:46:49] Anointed The the Lord with ointment
[1:46:51] Hallelujah so the people who called upon
[1:46:54] God they called on him because they had
[1:46:57] an
[1:46:58] experience this this is their attitudes

[1:47:16] an attitude that was what the attitude
[1:47:19] of an overcomer
[1:47:25] look in that moment there was nobody
[1:47:28] reminding her of her
[1:47:32] past but everybody jumped right on board
[1:47:34] with the attitude of Faith say let's go
[1:47:37] get the Lord
[1:47:40] hallelujah that Mary who anointed the
[1:47:43] Lord ointment and wiped it his feet with
[1:47:46] a hair see Mary was the kind of person

[1:47:56] her hair Hallelujah and a woman's hair
[1:47:58] is her glory she gave God the glory

[1:49:06] do something hallelujah what brought God
[1:49:08] to the children of Israel it was their
[1:49:10] cry it was their pain of being in
[1:49:14] bondage then Moses was
[1:49:18] born let's keep going
[1:49:22] when Jesus heard that he said the
[1:49:25] sickness is not unto death look what is
[1:49:28] he doing he's changing their
[1:49:32] attitude they look at they say my

[1:50:21] turning it into more than what it is
[1:50:24] hallelujah I give you a prime example my
[1:50:26] mom Hallelujah back when it was ring and
[1:50:28] raging she went to the hospital
[1:50:30] Hallelujah she said because she was
[1:50:32] dehydrated Hallelujah she was taking
[1:50:34] some medicine and the medicine was
[1:50:35] dehydrating her so she went to the
[1:50:37] hospital they said oh ma'am ma'am you
[1:50:39] got Co she said look I came here for a
[1:50:41] dehydration I didn't come here for no
[1:50:47] Co then they s the nurse in Hallelujah
[1:50:50] they s the nursing who look like her and
[1:50:52] talk like her and say oh oh mama call
[1:50:55] her my mama

[1:51:00] things they're hard to receive and hard
[1:51:03] to you know just believe your body can
[1:51:04] go through this and it's hard to accept
[1:51:07] my mom was like hard to accept what that
[1:51:08] you have Co she said look
[1:51:10] girl I don't have no Co I came in here
[1:51:14] for dehydration and treat me for
[1:51:18] dehydration
[1:51:21] but y'all know the enemy he don't give
[1:51:23] up easy and no doubt she had some
[1:51:26] symptoms of pain but what was those
[1:51:28] symptoms there for the symptoms were
[1:51:30] there to challenge who she really
[1:51:32] was and what she really believed
[1:51:35] Hallelujah and sometimes you'll get in a
[1:51:37] moment where God is trying to make the
[1:51:39] real you come
[1:51:41] out then the dark that comes in he looks
[1:51:44] so professional and has all his charts
[1:51:46] and books and he starts to talk to her
[1:51:48] and calls her mother and all these
[1:51:50] things and and and looks at her and says
[1:51:52] you know you got it and she says got

[1:52:18] bound everything else that they were
[1:52:20] trying to give her her confession made
[1:52:23] everything else null and void Hallelujah
[1:52:26] her confession Hallelujah kept
[1:52:28] Hallelujah Co suppressed kept lung
[1:52:31] problems suppressed kept all the other
[1:52:33] sickness that comes with it suppressed
[1:52:35] why because of her confession her
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:44] attitude look he says he's trying to
[1:52:48] adjust the attitude said this sickness
[1:52:50] is not un to death but for the glory of
[1:52:53] God could you be going through a pain in
[1:52:56] your life why for the glory of
[1:53:00] God right it could be something that God
[1:53:03] wants to get Glory out of
[1:53:06] you how's he going to get it in that
[1:53:09] moment you just say thank you
[1:53:12] Jesus you just say Hallelujah Lord I
[1:53:14] give it to you right Lord my life
[1:53:17] belongs to you see what we fail to
[1:53:20] realize it's not up to us to heal
[1:53:24] ourselves it's up to him once you put
[1:53:26] him in position that savior God has to
[1:53:29] take it from you that's right Hallelujah
[1:53:31] it belongs to him once you say Lord I
[1:53:34] give it to you God says I
[1:53:38] accept
[1:53:40] Hallelujah but it's our attitudes
[1:53:42] Hallelujah he says but for the glory of
[1:53:44] God that the Son of God might be
[1:53:47] glorified thereby I'm a witness is of
[1:53:50] that I had something in my life that end
[1:53:53] up being the glory of God cancer in my
[1:53:56] brain H oh my but it took the word
[1:54:00] coming into my life so I could see it
[1:54:02] for what it really is the Devil comes he
[1:54:05] said oh you got cancer you going to die
[1:54:07] you going to be a vegetable and they
[1:54:08] were partly right I did die and I am a
[1:54:11] hot pepper for Jesus
[1:54:16] Christ Hallelujah w
[1:54:20] oh my look Church where I am right now
[1:54:25] because it's a product of my pain that
[1:54:28] God turned into his
[1:54:31] glory I would have never met him without
[1:54:34] the testimony of Jesus Christ in my life
[1:54:37] I would have never met you without the
[1:54:38] testimony of Jesus Christ in my life so
[1:54:41] God used that pain to bless
[1:54:46] you let's keep going amen now Jesus
[1:54:50] loved Martha and her sister and Lazareth
[1:54:55] let's keep going when he had heard

[1:55:06] me I could come right away but you know
[1:55:09] what I'm going to take two days
[1:55:13] off and that's when our attitude start
[1:55:16] to get messed up when we feel like God
[1:55:18] is Not There

[1:55:24] seeing what's really in your heart what
[1:55:26] he's doing he's giving you attitude of
[1:55:31] checkup and you know some of us we get

[1:56:46] let us go unto Judea again now he turns
[1:56:49] back and starts going back the other way
[1:56:51] right still ain't going to
[1:56:55] Bethany Oh my he said you know what we
[1:56:58] going to let this thing marinate to see
[1:57:00] what kind of attitude they got let's
[1:57:02] keep
[1:57:03] reading he said the disciples said unto
[1:57:05] him Master the Jews of late sought to
[1:57:08] Stone thee and goes therefore thei again
[1:57:12] let's keep going Jesus answered are
[1:57:14] there not 12 hours in a day if any man
[1:57:16] walk in the day he stumbleth not because
[1:57:19] he said the light of this world but if a
[1:57:22] man walk in the night he stumble because
[1:57:25] there is no light in
[1:57:27] him these things said he and after that
[1:57:30] he said unto them our friend Lazarus
[1:57:34] sleeping first of all what he did he had
[1:57:37] to deal with the attitudes of the
[1:57:41] disciples he's like if y'all go come
[1:57:43] with me your attitude got to be right
[1:57:46] they were walking in fear they were like
[1:57:47] Jesus we can't go back here remember
[1:57:49] they wanted to Stone you God wasn't
[1:57:51] afraid of that Hallelujah he was like
[1:57:54] I'mma go wherever I want to go because
[1:57:56] I'm
[1:57:59] God
[1:58:01] hallelujah and he's making them wait
[1:58:03] what he's doing he's getting everybody
[1:58:05] on the same page to
[1:58:07] overcome Hallelujah let's keep reading
[1:58:10] no no no right there right there he says
[1:58:12] our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go
[1:58:14] that I may awake him out of the sleep
[1:58:17] hallu see Jesus his attitude he didn't
[1:58:20] even acknowledge he's trying to get them
[1:58:22] to see he's not dead he's just sleeping
[1:58:25] now if you sleep that mean you got to
[1:58:28] awake but the people wern't catching it
[1:58:31] h then he said to the disciples Lord he
[1:58:33] sleep shall he shall do well he said how
[1:58:37] be it Jesus speak of to death but they
[1:58:39] thought that he had spoken of taken of
[1:58:42] rest in
[1:58:43] sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly
[1:58:46] Lazarus is
[1:58:48] dead see they wern't catching it right
[1:58:51] yeah some of us are not catching it that
[1:58:54] what you going through is a blessing in
[1:58:58] disguise what you going through is that
[1:59:00] very thing that's going to make Christ
[1:59:04] come what you're going through is that
[1:59:06] very thing Hallelujah that pain is there
[1:59:09] to bring forth a
[1:59:10] joy Hallelujah that sickness is there to
[1:59:14] bring forth the healing Hallelujah that
[1:59:16] bondage is there to bring forth Liberty
[1:59:19] H that sadness is there to bring forth
[1:59:22] the
[1:59:23] joy there's a contrast to it
[1:59:26] Church let's
[1:59:29] go and I'm glad for you now look at God
[1:59:31] God saying I'm glad for your sake I'm
[1:59:34] glad for your sake that I wasn't
[1:59:37] there Hallelujah he wanted Lazarus to
[1:59:42] die just so he could show his
[1:59:45] power maybe he wanted you to lose that
[1:59:48] house
[1:59:49] just so he could give you a bigger one
[1:59:53] Hallelujah he wanted you to lose that
[1:59:56] car or whatever it is whatever you
[1:59:57] thought it was significant that you
[1:59:59] couldn't live without he wanted it to
[2:00:01] happen so you can see the glory of
[2:00:06] God he said for your sake that I was not
[2:00:09] there to the intent ye may
[2:00:12] believe these things are happening so
[2:00:15] God could make real Believers out of
[2:00:18] us
[2:00:20] nevertheless let us go unto
[2:00:22] him all right now said Thomas which is
[2:00:25] called Damas unto the fellowship let us
[2:00:29] also go that we may die with
[2:00:32] him then when Jesus came he found that
[2:00:35] he had laay in a grave for four days
[2:00:37] four days it seemed like it's
[2:00:40] irreversible it's been happening a long
[2:00:42] time you look at your loved one's life
[2:00:44] and they way out in the world they way
[2:00:46] out there but God let it go out there
[2:00:48] like that just to show you that once he
[2:00:50] get a line on you H he'll reel you back
[2:00:53] on in oh this is a big one oh it's
[2:00:55] coming back it's coming back you know
[2:00:57] what Jesus don't struggle like that he
[2:00:59] stands in one
[2:01:02] spot and you just
[2:01:06] come now Bethy was n unto Jerusalem
[2:01:09] about 15 forong off and many of the Jews
[2:01:13] came to Martha and Mary and comfort them
[2:01:16] concerning their brothers their brother
[2:01:18] see he's dead now everybody's coming
[2:01:20] there saying oh my your brother we
[2:01:24] understand my
[2:01:25] sister but that's the wrong
[2:01:28] attitude that's the wrong attitude they
[2:01:31] shouldn't be like Jesus on the
[2:01:34] way I heard he's almost
[2:01:38] here he's all the champion is almost
[2:01:42] here hallelujah the deliverer is almost

[2:10:21] [Music]
[2:10:24] three Hallelujah see that's what we must
[2:10:27] first realize this message of the hour
[2:10:31] Hallelujah is a product of the Bible
[2:10:34] right Hallelujah William bam is a
[2:10:38] product of the Bible he's a word Prophet

[2:10:48] Hallelujah and look he says Mary and
[2:10:51] Martha now they're touching and agreeing
[2:10:53] amen he said and the Jews also weeping
[2:10:56] which came with her he groaned in the
[2:10:58] spirit and was troubled Hallelujah why
[2:11:01] is he groaning Hallelujah because he's
[2:11:03] almost like I'm here and some of y'all
[2:11:06] don't have the right attitude why are
[2:11:09] you crying this should be a
[2:11:11] rejoicing he said I told you I've come

[2:11:41] which opened the eyes of the blind have
[2:11:43] caused that even this man should not
[2:11:46] have died Hallelujah now they trying to
[2:11:48] blame Jesus for the death but he already
[2:11:50] told him get your attitudes right I've
[2:11:52] come that you may see the glory of God
[2:11:55] he was supposed to
[2:11:59] die Jesus therefore again groaning in
