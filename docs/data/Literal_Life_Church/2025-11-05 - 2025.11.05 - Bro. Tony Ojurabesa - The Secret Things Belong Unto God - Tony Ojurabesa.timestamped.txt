[1:47] the Lord.
[1:49] Some begin to say, "Can we all stand and
[1:52] sing that he's in the house?
[1:57] Death has to flee

[2:37] The people all were weeping.
[2:40] Yes, Lord. They just laughed at Jesus
[2:44] when
[2:46] said she's only sleeping. Oh, but as he
[2:51] took her by the hand,
[2:55] she began to live again. Hallelujah.
[2:59] Some began to praise the Lord. And some
[3:04] began to say,
[3:06] "Oh, he's in the house.

[3:46] verse tonight. Oh, I was like that
[3:50] little girl,
[3:53] dead in all my sin,
[3:57] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[4:00] and gave me life again. Hallelujah. Oh,
[4:06] I'm just a house of clay.
[4:10] And ever since that blessed day, oh,
[4:14] there's a light that shines in me. So,
[4:18] all the world can say,
[4:21] "Oh, he's in the house."
[4:26] Oh, death has to flee.
[4:31] Now there is light
[4:34] where darkness used to be.
[4:39] Oh, now there is hope. Hallelujah. Oh,

[19:30] God.
[19:32] Come tonight
[19:44] with God
[19:47] in a secret
[19:51] place. This is where I want to be.
[19:54] There
[19:56] in the spirit
[20:00] beholding
[20:02] his face. Yes Lord. Oh gang
[20:09] you power
[20:12] to run in this race.
[20:19] I long
[20:22] to be shy
[20:25] with God as the Lord.
[20:31] Shing
[20:34] with God
[20:38] in a secret
[20:41] place.
[20:44] Oh, there
[20:47] in the spirit
[20:50] beholding
[20:53] his face. Yes, Lord. For gaining
[20:59] new power
[21:02] to run in
[21:05] the race.
[21:08] Oh, I want
[21:11] to shout.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; And so tonight, you know, brother Tony
[21:17] is one of our family. I've been
[21:19] preparing for the services and brother
[21:21] Tonyy's part of the family here, brother
[21:23] Michael's uh dad. And uh so we count he
[21:27] comes and stays a long time with us and
[21:29] he's going to be here through
[21:30] Thanksgiving. So this worked out so I
[21:32] could prepare for those services for him
[21:34] to speak a little bit to us tonight. We
[21:36] appreciate him always being around.
[21:38] Appreciate his amens when he's here.
[21:39] When I'm preaching,
[21:41] &gt;&gt; preachers know how to say amen to a
[21:43] preacher more than anybody. I think they
[21:45] know that they need the amen. So, you
[21:47] give that to him tonight. He's going to
[21:48] share something in the word of God. I
[21:50] was talking to him to the office. I
[21:52] don't know uh have you if you've heard
[21:54] the Christians that have been killed in
[21:56] Nigeria in his country in the last this
[21:59] last year, but also the last couple
[22:01] months it's even more severe. One day
[22:03] there was 200 that were killed and
[22:06] brother Tony said it's mostly in the
[22:07] north um when that's happening. Um but
[22:10] you know it has a potential to to spread
[22:13] sometimes and so that's terrible you
[22:15] know to see that they're being killed
[22:17] for the Christian faith. And so let's
[22:19] just lift our uh brothers and sisters up
[22:22] and those that have lost their family
[22:23] members and uh somehow God could step in
[22:26] and change that situation because
[22:28] there's a lot of Christians losing their
[22:29] lives by the pressure that they're under
[22:32] there in the north of Nigeria. So let's
[22:34] pray for them if you would. Amen. So
[22:36] we're going to have brother Tony come
[22:38] tonight sharing the word of God. And we
[22:40] want to do as the song says we want to
[22:41] be shut in with God in that secret
[22:43] place. It's one thing about the word is
[22:45] it's a dimension to itself. And if we're
[22:48] drawn into that dimension, we can be in
[22:49] another place with him where he can
[22:51] speak to us. It's a little bit extra
[22:53] effort on Wednesday nights when we're a
[22:55] little tired. So to enter in and to just
[22:57] say, "Lord, just bring me in to receive
[22:59] what you have for me." Um just still
[23:02] enjoying an overflow of his presence
[23:05] here and in our lives from Sunday. I had
[23:08] such liberty to minister the word of God
[23:10] this Sunday. I pray brother Tony will
[23:11] have it tonight. You all have shown your
[23:14] hunger for the word of God. you I was
[23:16] shown your response to the word of God
[23:18] and u I believe like sister Julie was
[23:21] saying there at the uh the the communion
[23:24] service that God knows how to prepare
[23:27] for the right kind of revival and he may
[23:30] be just getting our hearts in the right
[23:31] place uh for him to send a true revival.
[23:34] How many would agree I' I'd love to see
[23:36] my life deeper in him but we don't want
[23:39] to work up anything. We want our hearts
[23:40] prepared for it. But I I trust our
[23:43] expectations will be that and every word
[23:45] he gives us even tonight will just add
[23:47] word upon word upon word upon word and
[23:50] then something strikes that and boy I'll
[23:52] tell you he he really has always has
[23:54] greater things in mind for us. So we
[23:56] love him tonight. Shut in with God and
[23:58] let's get behind the word of God tonight
[23:59] and bless our brother. As I said he's
[24:01] family. Brother Tony you're family among
[24:03] us. So you feel at home tonight to
[24:05] minister the word of God. And uh he's
[24:07] come in the country for a few
[24:08] conventions. convention speaker South
[24:11] America and Canada and different places.
[24:13] So we don't want to miss enjoying what
[24:15] the Lord has dropped in his heart
[24:17] tonight
[24:22] with God in a
[24:28] &gt;&gt; let's worship him now.
[24:30] Thank you pastor. Thank you pastor.
[24:31] Thank you. There in the spirit
[24:38] in his face
[24:45] my power
[24:48] to run
[24:50] in the race.
[24:53] I love
[24:56] to be shouting
[24:59] with God. One more time. Oh yes.
[25:05] Shut
[25:07] we go
[25:10] in the sea
[25:13] creepless.
[25:17] There in the spirit
[25:22] beholding
[25:24] his face.
[25:28] gaining
[25:30] new power
[25:33] to run
[25:35] in the race. Oh, I am called
[25:41] to be shouting
[25:44] with God.
[25:46] Hallelujah. How many of us tonight will
[25:48] say, Lord, I want to be shouting with
[25:49] you, Lord Jesus. I want to be in fellow
[25:52] with you tonight. God bless you all. You
[25:56] may have a seat.
[25:58] God bless you. We are so glad to be back
[25:59] in the house of Lord this evening to
[26:01] feed on the word and to fellowship.
[26:05] I want to thank the pastor for having me
[26:07] here to
[26:09] encourage the church a little bit.
[26:12] I kind of get me a little nervous
[26:15] but I believe believe that when there's
[26:18] called for duty
[26:20] we have to be ready
[26:22] &gt;&gt; and uh it's not by what our own might.
[26:24] He's not by our power by might by by his
[26:26] grace.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; So I want to thank the pastor for the
[26:30] his kindness to us and you all in this
[26:32] assembly for your love for me and my
[26:34] family all the ministers all the church
[26:38] elders. May God bless you all. I feel
[26:42] home here with you all.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; And you know I just came back from
[26:46] Nigeria. I was in Nigeria. I went to
[26:47] Canada for a convention to speak and
[26:49] then I came from there. But you know
[26:52] understand when I first come from
[26:53] Nigeria that like that my accent get
[26:56] little pretty heavy. So you need to
[26:58] listen very pretty close
[27:02] you know when you when we have our guest
[27:04] minister from the United anywhere in the
[27:06] world come to Niger and they preaching
[27:08] their accent
[27:09] we don't speak like they do but we have
[27:11] to listen very close to understand what
[27:12] they're saying. So you do the same for
[27:15] me tonight. May God bless you. I want to
[27:17] thank you all again. I thank pas pastor
[27:20] pastor John Paul and the lovely family.
[27:23] May God bless them for their kindness to
[27:25] us. Praise the Lord. I'm going to try my
[27:28] best not to take your time. I know this
[27:30] is Wednesday night.
[27:32] If I was telling brother Brandon that
[27:33] even back our church Nigeria, I hardly
[27:37] preach on Wednesdays because I know
[27:38] people are tired. They always watching
[27:40] their their their watch
[27:43] and then that made made the preacher
[27:46] really nervous. So I have my young
[27:48] minister and brothers to preach during
[27:50] the week on Wednesday and Friday night
[27:51] services and on Sundays I preach because
[27:55] sometime we have some guests new people
[27:57] in the church that need to hear about
[27:58] the gospel of Christ. So you be with me
[28:01] tonight and listen very pretty close.
[28:03] Praise the Lord. Like I said I'll try my
[28:06] best not to take your time but don't put
[28:08] you under pressure. Just say amen to the
[28:10] word of God. Hallelujah. You know what
[28:12] brother Abraham says whenever I come to
[28:15] the house of God he say time c seizes
[28:18] &gt;&gt; I know preach they don't like to hear
[28:19] that
[28:20] &gt;&gt; you know but that's the truth cuz we are
[28:23] dealing with an eternal word you hear
[28:26] what pastor pastor just just told you
[28:28] about Nigeria
[28:30] the killing Christian in our country
[28:31] right now
[28:33] that's not happening in America
[28:36] one of these brother said we don't have
[28:37] this opportunity anymore anymore
[28:40] &gt;&gt; they will shut our doors
[28:41] won't be able to come back here to put
[28:43] fellowship anymore. All this be a
[28:45] memorial.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; So while we are still here today, let's
[28:48] enjoy the fellowship.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; May God bless you in the name of Lord
[28:52] Jesus Christ. Then I want to wish
[28:54] brother Dana happy birthday. Where's
[28:56] brother Dana? God bless my brother. I
[28:58] was in his house last night with sister
[29:02] Jen. He's my son and my daughter-in-law,
[29:05] my grandchildren. Uh he's 80 80 years
[29:09] old. I think you don't look no 80.
[29:13] May God bless you, sir. God bless
[29:14] Rodana. I really love the family. And um
[29:17] the last time that um sometimes ago when
[29:20] I came to preach, I believe in the old
[29:22] church or here I believe in the old
[29:24] church I um I preach on a message, a
[29:28] scripture message that titled the rock
[29:31] of my salvation.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Praise. I don't even remember that. And
[29:37] uh I don't know if I ever finish that
[29:39] message. A very powerful message that
[29:40] which I really I was blessed with.
[29:43] And tonight long willing if I have your
[29:46] favor and God's favor tonight. I pray
[29:48] for the auction auction of the Holy
[29:50] Spirit to advance a little bit further
[29:53] and dig a little deeper today in our own
[29:55] little humble way to cap off the message
[29:58] gloriously.
[30:00] But I just want to testify the fact that
[30:02] tonight Jesus is still the rock of my
[30:05] salvation. Amen.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah somebody.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; And I hope tonight I see your rock too.
[30:11] That we said last time rock denote
[30:13] stability.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord somebody.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; The rock is the Christ is our rock.
[30:22] Christ the solid rock.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are we sing that song.
[30:26] Praise the Lord. We have an anchor that
[30:29] keep the soul
[30:31] &gt;&gt; steadfast and sure while the billows
[30:33] roll fasten to the rock which cannot
[30:36] move
[30:37] &gt;&gt; grounded firm and deep in the savior's
[30:40] love. Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of trial we have.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; There's an anchor that keep our soul.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Like brother, I'm not the one holding
[30:48] him. He's the one holding my hands.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; We sing another song. Jesus hold my
[30:52] hands. I need you every hour. He hold my
[30:55] hands. If I'm the one holding his hand,
[30:57] he don't know how I drop this hand.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; But he's the one holding me. When I
[31:01] fall, he put me up. You ain't going
[31:03] nowhere. And he's doing the same to us.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; And that is amazing grace. Hallelujah.
[31:08] That's right.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; So I was going to speak tonight before
[31:11] on the grace of God. The God of second
[31:14] chance, God of many chances, which is
[31:16] based on grace of the grace of God. And
[31:19] that's what who our God is.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; He's God of many chances.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; If not for that, none of us will be here
[31:25] today.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; You remember I was thinking about Jonah.
[31:29] When God sent Jonah to Nineve
[31:31] &gt;&gt; and he got went to Tash on on vacation,
[31:35] God rather should have destroyed killed
[31:37] that man.
[31:38] But so God still give me another chance
[31:40] to go and deliver the message.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; So the same thing with David. Many of
[31:44] them like that.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; That's who we are today.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; We accept a God of many chances.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; May his name be praised forever more.
[31:53] Tonight if you don't have a Bible not to
[31:55] waste your time I'm going to read a
[31:57] couple scriptures and quotes of the
[31:58] prophet. If you don't make me nervous we
[32:01] close on on time. If you say amen to the
[32:03] word we go home on time. You don't but
[32:05] just look at like watching television
[32:07] we'll be here. for I'm just kidding.
[32:09] You're going to be here for a while.
[32:10] This This is Wednesday. Wednesday. And
[32:13] in Deuteronomy 29:29,
[32:16] I want to speak tonight uh for the next
[32:18] few minutes. I find los on the subject
[32:22] of um
[32:25] the secret thing things belong to God.
[32:29] And I subtitled it the supernatural
[32:31] adoption of the end time bride.
[32:35] supernatural adoption end time bride. So
[32:37] if you have a Bible tonight, children of
[32:39] God, let's read together from um um
[32:42] Deuteronomy 29:29
[32:45] by for prayer if you don't mind. How
[32:47] many of us here have a need in your life
[32:49] tonight? God bless you. He knows all
[32:52] things. Hallelujah. That song say my
[32:54] Jesus knows all my needs.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; He satisfies and every need supplies.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Whatever you need from him tonight, just
[33:03] put from him. Yes sir.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Let's pray at this time. Heavenly father
[33:05] in the name of Jesus Christ. We have
[33:08] come today to you again as our master
[33:10] savior God that can do all things.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; We are asking that you help us tonight
[33:16] Lord as your children.
[33:18] We are weak but thou are strong. Lord
[33:21] may you supply every need of the every
[33:24] hand that was raised up tonight. They
[33:26] signify a need one day or the other.
[33:29] maybe for healing of the body or some
[33:31] kind of need somewhere. But the Bible
[33:33] say you're the all knowing God.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; May you supply every need tonight in the
[33:38] name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[33:40] And as for me tonight, Lord, I'm so
[33:42] unworthy to stand behind this secret
[33:43] desk. I just came back from a many trip
[33:47] for four countries trip preaching the
[33:49] gospel. And Lord, I just pray that you
[33:51] give me strength
[33:53] &gt;&gt; and give me a clarity of speech to your
[33:54] children and let it be God speaking
[33:57] tonight. Amen. For a man's word shall
[34:00] fail, heaven are not will pass away, but
[34:02] your will stand forever more.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we prayed. Amen.
[34:08] Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 29
[34:12] um verse 29 and it says
[34:17] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[34:19] our God.
[34:21] But those things which are revealed
[34:24] belong unto us and our children forever.
[34:27] Not for weekend or for Wednesday night
[34:30] but forever.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; That we may do all the words of this
[34:34] law. Hallelujah. And you know that there
[34:37] the Bible is not talking about doing the
[34:38] following law of the Pharisees or
[34:41] Pharisees. I'm talking about obeying the
[34:43] word of God. Hallelujah. Cuz in Matthew
[34:45] 5:16, Jesus said, "I did not come to
[34:47] remove the laws that to fulfill the
[34:50] law."
[34:51] Praise the Lord. And we today fulfill
[34:53] the laws of God by simply simple
[34:56] obedience by faith to his word.
[34:58] Hallelujah.
[35:00] Hallelujah. Okay. Let's turn to 1
[35:02] Corinthians 2 6-12 also
[35:06] and says how be it we speak wisdom among
[35:10] them that are perfect
[35:13] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[35:16] the princes of this world that come to
[35:19] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[35:22] mystery watch even the hidden wisdom
[35:26] which God ordained before the world unto
[35:29] our glory.
[35:31] which none of none. Everybody say none.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world
[35:36] knew. For had they known it, they would
[35:39] they would not have crucified the Lord
[35:41] of glory. But as is written, I had not
[35:45] seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
[35:49] into the hearts of men the things which
[35:51] God had prepared for them that love him.
[35:55] Then he said, "But I like that God had
[35:59] revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; For the spirit searchth all things,
[36:05] yeah, the deep things of God, the deep
[36:09] things of God, I like that."
[36:11] &gt;&gt; So much deep people of God that we can
[36:13] see today by God's God's grace that our
[36:16] journey from here to glory line is no
[36:19] longer a secret.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. somebody because the b the
[36:24] seals have been broken. Hallelujah. The
[36:26] Bible is no longer a secret to us. It's
[36:29] a it's an open book. Hallelujah.
[36:31] For the prophet, the prophetic promise
[36:33] for this day, this last day is in the
[36:36] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[36:41] when he not day, as of many, one voice.
[36:46] When he shall begin to sound, the
[36:49] mystery of God shall be finished as he
[36:51] had declared to his servants the
[36:52] prophets. Hallelujah. May I have a seat?
[36:54] God bless you.
[36:57] Um so Apostle Paul reaffirmed this truth
[37:01] in our testimony by saying I had not
[37:04] seen nor ear heard neither had have
[37:08] entered into the hearts of men the
[37:10] things which God had prepared for them
[37:13] that love him.
[37:15] But God can reveal them unto us by his
[37:19] spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[37:21] things. Yeah. The deep things of God. 11
[37:24] For what man knoweth the things of a
[37:27] man, save the spirit of man, which is a
[37:29] name. Even so the things of God knoweth
[37:32] no man, but the spirit of God. 12 Now we
[37:36] have received not the spirit of the
[37:38] world, but the spirit which is of God,
[37:41] that we might know the things that are
[37:43] freely given to us of God,
[37:46] &gt;&gt; without money, without price. 13 Which
[37:49] things also we speak, not in the words
[37:51] which man wisdom teacheth, but which the
[37:54] Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual
[37:57] things with spiritual. 14 But the
[38:00] natural man referee not the things of
[38:03] the spirit of God, for they are
[38:05] foolishness unto him, neither can he
[38:08] know them, because they are specially
[38:11] discerned.
[38:12] But he that that is spiritual judgeth
[38:15] all things, yet he himself is judge of
[38:18] no man. For who had known the mind of
[38:21] the Lord, that he may instruct him, but
[38:24] we have the mind of Christ. Amen. Praise
[38:29] the Lord. Um I want to start by saying
[38:33] that revelation is very important to the
[38:35] church of God, to the believer's life.
[38:36] Hallelujah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; We cannot come to church because
[38:39] somebody invited us or we come for our
[38:41] friends. say sake of our spouse's uh uh
[38:46] sake that make us make believers.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; We have to have our own personal
[38:50] experience with Christ. Hallelujah.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; We have to be really born again.
[38:54] Hallelujah. And feel the holy ghost.
[38:56] Hallelujah. And brother Abraham said
[38:57] seven churches page 13 talk about the
[39:00] importance of re revelation there. He
[39:02] said the importance of re revelation by
[39:05] the spirit to a true believer. Now true
[39:07] believer now can never be
[39:10] overemphasized. That is we can never
[39:14] talk or preach too much to a general
[39:16] believer about revelation.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he said revelation
[39:21] means more to you than perhaps you
[39:23] realize.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Like I talk about healing the other day.
[39:29] But say if you're sick, just imagine
[39:31] your healthy
[39:33] person standing in front of you and
[39:35] walking to that
[39:36] &gt;&gt; and you gonna be you'll be healed.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; That that's simple. Praise the Lord.
[39:40] Praise the Lord.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Praise. Yes, sir. If if you we just
[39:46] heard Apostle Paul said also a natural
[39:49] or canal man cannot understand the
[39:51] things of the spirit of God for they are
[39:54] spiritually discerned. Brother Brown
[39:56] said, "I am talking about all
[39:58] revelation. It is tremendously important
[40:00] to the church." Hallelujah.
[40:03] And also remember that brother Brown
[40:05] prophet taught us that Satan hates only
[40:09] two books in the entire Bible.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; And that is the book of Re Genesis and
[40:14] Revelation
[40:16] and the ending.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote quickly in re the
[40:20] book of the seven church of Jesus. If I
[40:23] talk too too fast for you, that's just
[40:26] the effect of just coming back from for
[40:28] Africa.
[40:30] Just watch my lips. Hallelujah. And
[40:32] listen very closely.
[40:35] I love you, church. God bless you,
[40:37] brother. Say in this revelation, he
[40:39] tells us what the end of the devil is,
[40:43] how he's going to deal with the devil
[40:45] and cast him into the lake of fire. I
[40:48] like that. A amen. One of my one of my
[40:51] one of my preacher preacher friends said
[40:53] some time ago, he said, "If devil comes
[40:55] to show or remind you about your
[40:57] weakness or mistakes, you show me his
[40:59] end."
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; He's going to be turned to lake of fire.
[41:02] Hallelujah. That's his saying.
[41:03] Hallelujah.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; He's going to toast in hell like a
[41:06] bread.
[41:08] But our said he revealed the end of the
[41:11] wicked ones who followed Satan
[41:13] unbelievers and Satan hates that.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he continue by saying, "Have
[41:20] you ever noticed how Satan hates two
[41:22] books of the Bible more than all their
[41:25] others?"
[41:27] Through liberal theologians and
[41:28] pseudocientists, he is always attacking
[41:31] the book of Genesis and the book of
[41:32] Revelation.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; In both of these books, we find Satan's
[41:36] origin,
[41:37] right? His ways and his destruction.
[41:41] That's why he attacks them. He has to be
[41:44] exposed. And in those books, he is
[41:46] exposed for exactly what he is.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus said about Satan, he had no pardon
[41:53] me and I have no pardoning. The devil
[41:56] would like to prove that different but
[41:58] he cannot. So he does all he can to
[42:01] destroy confidence in the word word.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; That's what it does.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Needs to doubt the word of God.
[42:06] Hallelujah. Man, the Bible say by his
[42:09] strip you are healed.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; He's going to give you another idea.
[42:12] Don't listen to the devil. Stay with the
[42:14] word of God. Hallelujah.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; You do whether you understand or not,
[42:17] just say, "Father, I don't understand,
[42:18] but I believe." Amen. Do like Peter.
[42:20] Hallelujah.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; The devil would like to prove that
[42:23] different. But he cannot. So, he does
[42:26] all he can to destroy confidence in the
[42:28] word of God. But when the church
[42:30] disbelieves Satan and believe the spirit
[42:32] revelation of the word, the gates of
[42:35] hell cannot prevail against her.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, I I tell some some
[42:42] people in journey. I was in journey last
[42:43] month. I said, you know, God give me a
[42:45] grace to do. So when I come to the Lord,
[42:47] he g give me grace about how to deal
[42:49] with that. How many of us here have
[42:51] battle of the mind here? Let me see your
[42:52] hand. I know you do. I do too. I know
[42:55] you be lying if you say you don't. The
[42:57] devil talk to us in our mind every
[42:59] second
[43:01] &gt;&gt; every weird thought to weaken your faith
[43:03] to discourage you.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; But when that come to and it's a spirit
[43:07] is around. We don't see him but he's
[43:08] there. So what is this I do brother Paul
[43:10] in my bedroom Nigerian when they begin
[43:12] to talk to my ears all those nonsense I
[43:15] said sister I know you are here I cannot
[43:16] see but I know you are here I said the
[43:18] Lord rebuke you in Jesus Jesus name
[43:20] &gt;&gt; I mean to sing songs of praises I mean
[43:22] to praise praise God hallelujah
[43:24] &gt;&gt; but the man said good gospel music cast
[43:26] the devil out
[43:28] &gt;&gt; or sometime I put
[43:30] sermon tapes because he know that man is
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Paul I know Jesus I know too but who art
[43:36] thou
[43:37] &gt;&gt; he know that the voice God for this hour
[43:40] he that the atmosphere be clean for you.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And also remember brother
[43:45] said each of us the creator said we
[43:48] create the atmosphere in which we live.
[43:51] Praise the Lord. You can do that.
[43:52] Hallelujah. We begin to talk all kind of
[43:54] rubbish your ears or head. He's standing
[43:57] on your head. You don't see him but just
[43:58] say I know you here. Just go and bring
[44:00] with play some gospel song some tape. He
[44:04] will leave.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And know that Apostle
[44:08] Paul declared in our test tonight in 1
[44:10] Corinthians 2:9 that I had not seen nor
[44:13] ear heard neither have entered to the
[44:16] heart of men the things which God had
[44:19] prepared for them that love him. I wish
[44:22] I have time tonight. This is a Wednesday
[44:23] night. I'm I want to be very careful to
[44:26] show us that we have some great event to
[44:28] look forward to.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Great event. Glorious event people of
[44:32] God. Brother Gideon wonderful time.
[44:34] Come. Hallelujah. Somebody
[44:37] &gt;&gt; we have passed from death unto life.
[44:39] People of God,
[44:40] &gt;&gt; we're not only we are the bride of
[44:42] Christ. Hallelujah.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; So, but God has revealed them to us by
[44:47] his spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[44:51] things. Yeah. The deep things of God.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; That's why probably after the sea was
[44:56] open, we to talk about the future home.
[44:59] Hallelujah. The rapture. Things that are
[45:01] to be
[45:03] &gt;&gt; things that we never heard in church.
[45:06] church priesty
[45:07] &gt;&gt; because now we are living in a different
[45:09] dimension. Hallelujah.
[45:12] And we find out that the book of
[45:14] revelation is the program of God for
[45:16] redemption.
[45:17] And if you follow the order of the
[45:19] events in the book of revelation, you
[45:21] will see how our prophet orderly placed
[45:23] the book in accordance to God's eternal
[45:25] salvation plan. Right? From revelation
[45:28] chapter 1 to chapter 22.
[45:31] Yeah. Praise the Lord. Well, I probably
[45:33] thought about the guy that came to his
[45:35] brother Abraham James have eaten some
[45:37] hot pepper soup that night when he wrote
[45:38] that thing. He did understand their
[45:41] account. They cannot catch it.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; But God was showing John things that
[45:46] will be in the future is God's plan for
[45:49] redemption. Hallelujah. For example,
[45:51] here I probably taugh us in Revelation
[45:53] chapter one that Revelation chapter 1
[45:55] through 3 is the gentile dispensation.
[45:58] Hallelujah. or the period of seven
[46:01] churchages which Apostle Paul also
[46:04] referred to as the fullness of times.
[46:07] Hallelujah. Galatians 4:4-7. Let me read
[46:10] that quickly. Galatians 4:4-7.
[46:13] Paul said, "But when the fullness of
[46:15] time was come, God sent forth his son
[46:18] made of a woman made under the law to
[46:21] redeem them." Who? You and I.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; That were under the law that we might
[46:26] receive the adoption of sons.
[46:28] Hallelujah. There goes your spiritual
[46:30] adoption this tonight of the bride
[46:33] without any natural blood relation to
[46:35] add Abraham. Now we have access and
[46:37] claim to Abraham's blessings. We're not
[46:39] related to him. We're not Jews in the
[46:41] flesh. Hallelujah. But by the faith of
[46:45] Christ, we are Abraham's seed.
[46:46] Hallelujah.

[47:09] outwardly neither is the circumcision
[47:11] which is outward in the flesh but he is
[47:14] a Jew which is one inwardly
[47:18] &gt;&gt; and circumcision is that of the heart in
[47:21] the spirit the Holy Ghost baptism and
[47:23] not in letter whose praise is not of men
[47:27] but of God. Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody, I want to come to read
[47:30] Galatians 4:E 6. And be and because ye
[47:33] are sons, God has sent forth the spirit
[47:36] of his son into your hearts crying aba
[47:40] father.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Wherefore thou art no more a servant
[47:46] that Jesus told the servant saying
[47:48] you're not my servant. You are friends.
[47:49] You're my friends. Because his servant
[47:51] does not know what his lord does.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; He had to share some deep things with
[47:55] them. Wherefore th there are no more a
[47:57] servant but a son. How many of us are
[48:00] when he say son that sisters included
[48:01] now. How many of us are children of God?
[48:03] Here let me see your hand.
[48:05] Therefore therefore that no more no more
[48:08] a no more servant but a son and if a son
[48:12] then and here hallelujah of God through
[48:15] Christ.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah somebody. We have claim to
[48:20] everything that Christ died for.

[48:24] father Abraham is ours as well.

[48:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord somebody. Now quickly
[48:28] let me let me go through the other
[48:30] events in the book of Revelation before
[48:33] I got too excited here.

[48:47] the preacher have cleaned all the devils
[48:48] out of the church. Anybody want to
[48:50] preach?
[48:52] I see I hear you.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; So

[49:00] watches or the seven church ages.

[49:18] one. I only my quotes and not on
[49:21] pictures yet. God bless you. Go to my
[49:24] scriptures and quotes first.
[49:28] So revelation chapter one chapters 1 to3
[49:32] are the seven watches or the seven
[49:33] churches. Revelation chapter 4 is the
[49:36] rapture. Hallelujah. For John was
[49:39] summoned to come up hither. John being
[49:42] the top of the bride. Hallelujah.
[49:44] Revelation chapter 5 up to 17 are the
[49:47] seven seals, the seven vials, the seven
[49:50] trumpets. Revelation 11 is the ministry
[49:53] ministry of those two olive trees, the
[49:56] two prophets, Moses and Elijah to the
[49:58] Jews to call out the 144,000 Benjamins
[50:02] from Israel for their uh atonement
[50:04] feast. Are you with me? Somebody say
[50:06] amen, somebody. And the brother did not
[50:09] return back to the earth again until
[50:11] revelation the 19th chapter with our
[50:14] groom on the white horse. You can give
[50:16] me that. Give me the Lord cried that
[50:18] white horses. Brother, sister, whoever
[50:20] is there at the back there, can you

[50:32] can I No, not that one. The next one I
[50:36] put. There you go. That's Christ. That
[50:39] Revelation 19 there. Praise the Lord.
[50:43] Nasty. Thank you. Now I got you now. I
[50:46] got the hang of this on this one. That's
[50:48] Christ on the white horse. And the bride
[50:50] is coming by hand. No, no, no, no, no. I
[50:54] No, no, no. I don't need that right now.
[50:57] I'm sorry about that.
[50:59] Anyway, this high-tech thing, there
[51:02] something else. But Christ came back
[51:04] with you can see the host of heaven.
[51:06] That's you and I on the white horse.
[51:08] Come back for the millennium reign on
[51:10] earth.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And this is coming people of God. This
[51:13] is still true story, true prophecy.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; And we're going to be there by the grace
[51:17] of God.
[51:19] Hallelujah. And after this is the
[51:22] millennium reign, the white throne
[51:23] judgment, the battle of Gog and Magog,
[51:26] new Jerusalem descending like a bride
[51:28] adon to her husband and eternity reign
[51:30] from there on. Hallelujah. But Abraham
[51:33] said here Revelation 4 verse 1 he read I
[51:37] want to read Revelation 4:1. He said
[51:39] after this I looked and behold a door
[51:42] was open. Now you can give me the door
[51:44] now. Okay.
[51:47] Where is that door that you just give me
[51:49] now? Right there. And I and I look and
[51:52] behold a door was open in heaven and the
[51:55] first voice this just a symbol.
[51:59] And I heard and I and I heard and which
[52:03] and and the first voice which I heard
[52:05] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[52:08] me which says come up hither and I will
[52:12] show thee things which must be
[52:14] hereafter. Hallelujah
[52:17] that represent the rapture. Praise the
[52:19] Lord.
[52:21] Come up hither. Hallelujah. And then the
[52:24] message revelation 4 part 2
[52:28] uh 961 uh January 1 it say now we find
[52:33] that after after these things the Bible
[52:35] said see after means that after the
[52:38] churches churches had ceased
[52:41] then John was summoned to come up hither
[52:44] higher come up higher which means come
[52:47] up here
[52:49] so she show him all that was going to
[52:52] happen in the world on the church age.
[52:55] Then after the church ages was over, we
[52:58] find that John was a type of the true
[53:00] believer that would be summoned by
[53:02] Christ on high. That's right. Someone
[53:06] come up hither. And we find out that the
[53:09] voice that spoke to him was the voice of
[53:12] a trumpet clear decently. And it was the
[53:16] same voice that spoke to him here on
[53:19] earth. Hallelujah. See, as long as he
[53:22] was in the midst of the seven golden
[53:24] candlestick, he was speaking to to the
[53:26] church. Oh, I like that. Speaking from
[53:28] the candlesticks. See, he was in the
[53:30] candlesticks. Speaking to from them to
[53:32] his church. Then when the church age has
[53:35] ceased, he left the earth and moved up
[53:37] to the heavens and he called his redeem
[53:40] up with him. That's what he promised.
[53:43] That wherever I am, you may that may be
[53:45] also, right? So, wherever Jesus Christ
[53:48] is, we're going to be with him there.
[53:49] Hallelujah. Oh, isn't that beautiful? It
[53:52] just made me just make my heart jump.
[53:55] Hallelujah.
[53:56] Praise God. It made my heart jump to to
[53:58] know I'm going to be in rapture. People
[54:00] are we not be in the rapture.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Bible say we not we're going we are not
[54:04] going to sleep. Brother Dana I was
[54:07] telling brother Dana to I said very soon
[54:09] you're going to be 90. He said I don't
[54:11] want to stay that long.
[54:13] God bless. I said but that's longevity.
[54:17] Longevity is a blessing. He said that I
[54:20] want Christ to come. He has delayed too
[54:21] for too long. I want to come.
[54:24] I said but if he delays, if he tries as
[54:27] he likes, who are we to complain?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That's praise. Even so come Lord Jesus.
[54:34] My confession tonight people of God is
[54:36] that I still believe this glorious end
[54:38] time message. People are leaving it left
[54:40] and right. I'm not going anywhere.
[54:42] Praise praise the Lord.
[54:44] I still believe this full word revealed
[54:46] word of Yah. Hallelujah. I'm not looking
[54:49] for another one. I don't want need
[54:50] another prophet another voice. I already
[54:52] got mine. I don't about you.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; I ain't go nowhere. I quit shopping when
[54:57] I came to this message. I am home to
[54:59] stay forever in this message throughout
[55:02] eternity. By the grace of God,
[55:04] &gt;&gt; I still believe that that God is the
[55:06] healer tonight.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; How many of us are sick tonight? If you
[55:10] are sick, my God will heal you.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Why are they leaving the message? But
[55:14] the brand sent the message supernatural.
[55:15] said the reason why they doing that
[55:16] because they lose their faith. That's
[55:19] what they're doing. That's that's what
[55:21] happened. Once you lose your faith, you
[55:23] out on the streets.
[55:25] Don't ever lose your faith in Christ cuz
[55:27] he's not dead, people of God. He's still
[55:29] a healer. Hallelujah. He's still a
[55:31] savior. He still answered prayers. He
[55:34] still supply all our needs. Hallelujah.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The problem is not with him.
[55:40] He's with us. Hallelujah. I believe our
[55:43] God can do all things.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; What what do I do tonight?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; I still believe in his grace. Somebody
[55:50] someone say we preach on grace too. No,
[55:51] no, no. We have plenty on the other side
[55:53] too. If you want the other one, we can
[55:54] preach on the other side too. But I
[55:56] still believe now on the grace of God.
[55:58] But Paul said by grace are ye saved and
[56:02] that not of your own. It's a gift of
[56:04] God.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; It's not by power by not what you have
[56:08] done. Hallelujah. But what he had done
[56:10] for us.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] Hallelujah. I still believe tonight in
[56:13] the power the power of God. I still
[56:15] believe in his word. I still believe in
[56:17] importance mean all powerful.
[56:20] Hallelujah. In my Bible, the Bible say
[56:22] in Psalm 33:6 that by the word of the of
[56:26] the Lord were the heavens made and all
[56:28] the host of them by the breath of his
[56:31] mouth. Hallelujah.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; So our God is omnipotent tonight. He has
[56:35] always been. He can do all things. He
[56:38] can believe all things are possible for
[56:40] us. So, hallelujah. And he's not dead.
[56:42] Hallelujah. I told them in Brazil, we
[56:44] sing a song here in America. God's not
[56:46] dead. He's alive. God's not dead.
[56:52] He's alive. God, he's not dead. He's
[56:56] alive. I feeling in my heart. I feeling
[57:00] is that how it goes? I feeling in my
[57:02] whole body. He's not dead. Hallelujah.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; If you are sick now, my God will heal
[57:06] you.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they going through. He
[57:09] can deliver you from any kind of
[57:11] problems.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He's not dead. Hallelujah.
[57:15] He's omnipotent. Hallelujah. Somebody
[57:17] years ago, there's a preacher in England
[57:19] called Author Pink. I don't know if you
[57:21] ever read his book. And he said he has
[57:24] something to say about the importance of
[57:25] God. And I want to read that to you. He
[57:27] said, "Well, may the saint trust such a
[57:30] God."
[57:32] They're not giving my quotes.
[57:35] I don't know. Maybe I should go back.
[57:38] I'm sorry I'm
[57:41] &gt;&gt; they just
[57:44] &gt;&gt; they don't have any Oh no.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Oh no. I sent it. That's old devil.
[57:50] I sent to them.
[57:53] So I asked my son if they have WhatsApp
[57:56] number that I can send to WhatsApp for a
[57:58] backup. But that's okay. I'll be reading
[57:59] for you then. That's may make better.
[58:03] Then the after pink said well may the
[58:07] saint trust such a god he is worthy of
[58:10] implicit confidence. Implicit mean
[58:13] unlimited confidence.
[58:15] Nothing is too hard for him.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; If said if God were stinted in mighted
[58:22] mean to be inadequate or insufficient in
[58:25] in mind in power. If God was sced in
[58:28] might and had had a limit to his
[58:31] strength, we might as well despair on
[58:33] fear. But see that is clothe with
[58:36] omnipotence. No prayer is too hard for
[58:39] him to answer.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say tonight? No, I don't
[58:44] care what about they are not too hard
[58:45] for him to answer. No needs too great
[58:47] for him to supply.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; No passion too strong for him to subdue.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; No temptation too powerful for him to
[58:55] deliver from. and no misery too deep for
[58:58] him to deliver relieve.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; So no matter what you're going through
[59:01] tonight, his only potent can help you.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He grant the victory and
[59:05] give you peace. Do you believe that
[59:07] tonight son of God?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Now quickly I want to go by
[59:11] my my sermon so I can close quickly. In
[59:14] my in our test tonight, we read from um
[59:17] Deuteronomy 29:29
[59:19] on the secret things belongs to God, but
[59:21] things that are revealed belong to our
[59:25] children forever. Praise the Lord.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Before I left Nigeria, Pastor Paul, I
[59:30] was preaching on the subject of the
[59:33] kingdom of God and the kingdom of men,
[59:35] which we still have a lot to things to
[59:37] cover. That's how it is with the word of
[59:39] God, especially in the book of
[59:41] Revelation. God God's word is eternal.
[59:44] Something will lead to dead like Paul
[59:45] was saying the other day, you can't just
[59:47] stop. The word of God is interconnected.
[59:50] Hallelujah. There's no end to the word
[59:51] of God. It's eternal. Praise the Lord.
[59:54] Especially when we're studying from the
[59:55] book of Revelation, it is non-stop.
[59:58] Light upon light follows like Brown said
[1:00:00] to eliminate the word of God.
[1:00:02] Hallelujah. And there are so many too
[1:00:04] many so many secrets in I'm talking
[1:00:05] about this God's secret. The secret
[1:00:07] things belong to God. But things that
[1:00:08] are revealed belong to us and our
[1:00:10] children forever. There are so many
[1:00:12] secrets inside the book of revelation
[1:00:14] and that's why they are called
[1:00:15] mysteries.
[1:00:17] Hallelujah. And what is a mystery?
[1:00:21] We let the prophet go answer the
[1:00:23] question himself in the message. Is this
[1:00:25] the sign of the answers? December 3,
[1:00:28] 1962 paragraph 244. Brother said, "A
[1:00:32] mystery is scripture. A previously
[1:00:35] hidden truth now divinely revealed
[1:00:38] divinely but with the spiritual element
[1:00:41] in it. This part revelation
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; then we need to mention the mystery
[1:00:45] revealed to the bright end time bride in
[1:00:47] this last days. He said the greater the
[1:00:50] greater mysteries and the great
[1:00:51] mysteries are he said number one the
[1:00:54] mystery of the kingdom of heaven.
[1:00:58] Hallelujah. That's the one we are
[1:01:00] talking on on now. Matthew 13:3-50.
[1:01:04] And our second mystery is the mystery of
[1:01:07] Israel's blindness during this age.
[1:01:10] Romans 11:25
[1:01:12] with the with with the contest. Romans
[1:01:14] 11:25-26 says, "For I for I will not,
[1:01:18] brethren, that you should be ignorant of
[1:01:20] this mystery, lest you you should be
[1:01:22] wise in your own conceits that blindness
[1:01:25] in part is happen to Israel until the
[1:01:28] fullness of Gentiles become."
[1:01:30] Hallelujah. God blinded blinded Israel
[1:01:33] so they can come in. Hallelujah.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; They can they can be saved. They want to
[1:01:36] be saved but God blinded their eyes and
[1:01:40] so all Israel shall be saved as is
[1:01:43] written there shall come out of Zion the
[1:01:45] deliverer and shall turn away ungoliness
[1:01:47] from Jacob. Praise the Lord. But now you
[1:01:51] know that one time was going to go to
[1:01:54] going to go to Israel to preach to them.
[1:01:56] uh his friend I believe Luis Petros a
[1:02:00] Jewish man said but if you can come to
[1:02:02] Israel and display this prophetic gift
[1:02:05] the Jews will believe you they believe
[1:02:06] in the Lord Jesus Christ but ra
[1:02:10] to Israel to preach and use the gift the
[1:02:13] prophetic gift before them because they
[1:02:15] believe the Jews always believe they're
[1:02:16] prophets and when he landed in Cairo
[1:02:20] Egypt
[1:02:22] and uh then he he The the word said you
[1:02:26] should go behind the anger and say the
[1:02:29] time is not yet
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Bill this not the time go and I send
[1:02:34] somewhere else went to India.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Brother said one I said see he love to
[1:02:43] he love to um go there and win some of
[1:02:46] them to Lord and said do you believe in
[1:02:49] the prophet? Yes. I said come on come on
[1:02:51] here and begin to display the gifts but
[1:02:54] it's not his ministry. Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] That's for Moses Elijah.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; He sent a message handwriting on the
[1:03:01] wall uh September 2nd 1956. He said here
[1:03:04] the other day but Aambrite showed me
[1:03:07] that picture 3 minutes before midnight.
[1:03:10] That wasn't that that that wasn't
[1:03:12] Christians. That was science said that
[1:03:15] the old clock has went away and the
[1:03:18] pendulum has beat back and forth back
[1:03:20] and forth through troubles and chaos and
[1:03:23] gospel sermons and messages until
[1:03:25] finally she's 3 minutes before midnight.
[1:03:28] And I see that picture and I seen them
[1:03:32] bringing those Jews.
[1:03:35] Excuse me. I seen them bringing those
[1:03:38] Jews in. Coming down from Iran.
[1:03:41] Hallelujah. Somebody
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; bring them from Iran. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:03:49] Coming down from Egypt. Coming down from
[1:03:51] all over the world. And there's packing
[1:03:54] them in. boys packing their old mommy
[1:03:57] and their and their back
[1:04:02] and they went up in to interview them.
[1:04:05] When we when we landed just below and I
[1:04:08] landed in Caro, Egypt, I seen them big
[1:04:10] planes coming in loaded with with with
[1:04:14] um
[1:04:16] Is it off?
[1:04:18] What? What happened?
[1:04:20] Can I put this? Okay. Hey, thank you.
[1:04:28] Oh, I'm sorry. It's up again. What did I
[1:04:32] do wrong my brother?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; All right. There. That's there.
[1:04:38] Yes.
[1:04:40] When we landed just below and and I
[1:04:42] landed in Caro, Egypt and I seen them
[1:04:45] big planes coming in loaded with the
[1:04:47] with those people walk up and said,
[1:04:49] "What are you going to what are you
[1:04:51] going back to the homeland for? Are you
[1:04:53] going back there to die so you can be
[1:04:56] buried in the homelands?" Those old Jews
[1:04:59] with tears run down there. She said,
[1:05:01] "No, we are going there to meet the
[1:05:03] Messiah." Hallelujah.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; We are going there to see the Messiah.
[1:05:07] He'll be there soon. M
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; They're not going to to die. They're
[1:05:12] going to see Messiah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that is what we
[1:05:16] should make us to be on fire for God
[1:05:19] because
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; that time is almost up.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Once he say I accept the gospel is over.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; and then another message Jar brother say
[1:05:31] I was at Caro Egypt going to Palestine.
[1:05:34] The Jew will believe it. the Jews six
[1:05:36] signs and they will believe it and we
[1:05:38] had a bunch of them. I was going to
[1:05:41] bring thousand of them out. You see you
[1:05:42] that's plan to bring many many of them
[1:05:44] out into the the gospel. When Lis Petros
[1:05:47] sent the Bible back there when those
[1:05:49] Jews came off from Iran and was looking
[1:05:52] at the Bible they said if this be the
[1:05:55] Messiah they never heard anything about
[1:05:57] the Messiah said if this just be the
[1:05:59] Messiah then let us see him do the sign
[1:06:01] of the prophet and we believe it.
[1:06:04] I promise surely they will. I tell
[1:06:06] they'll believe it.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus said when you see the fig tree
[1:06:10] putting forth its yonder when them Jews
[1:06:14] coming in this with in the six point
[1:06:17] star of David flying the first time for
[1:06:20] 20 2500 years the oldest flag in the
[1:06:23] whole world they become a nation on the
[1:06:25] sixth day on the seventh day of May
[1:06:28] 1946. on the sixth day rather on the
[1:06:31] seventh day the the same time the angel
[1:06:33] of law appeared down there and sent out
[1:06:36] this message
[1:06:38] just just look at the time peace of God
[1:06:41] the scene that God commissioned the
[1:06:42] prophet in in Greenmail
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; the following day
[1:06:47] exactly right you see it was for to know
[1:06:51] what take place then I was I was right
[1:06:53] at Caro and the Holy Spirit said not at
[1:06:55] this tower return back and I went back
[1:06:58] to Rome That's right. Just not the hour
[1:07:02] when the Jews receive the gospel, the
[1:07:04] gentile is finished.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Brown said, "Where where
[1:07:10] those Jews have been brought back to
[1:07:12] their homeland back in 1950s, his friend
[1:07:15] Li Petrus asked him to visit Palestine
[1:07:17] with prophetic gift in his life and that
[1:07:20] the Jews will believe on the Lord
[1:07:21] Jesus." But the prophet of God
[1:07:24] immediately bought his flight ticket to
[1:07:25] Palestine. But when they land in the
[1:07:27] carrot Egypt, the angel of the Lord
[1:07:28] stopped him from going to Israel because
[1:07:30] it is not the time yet for Israel
[1:07:33] blindness to the gospel of Christ to be
[1:07:36] removed. Hallelujah. That's number
[1:07:39] number two mystery that was revealed
[1:07:40] this. We don't know that. We've been
[1:07:42] dimension for many years. Nobody ever
[1:07:44] taught us this.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; But in this day, God opened the Bible.
[1:07:48] Now we know this truth. The third
[1:07:50] mystery is the the translation, the
[1:07:52] rapture of the living state sent at the
[1:07:54] end of the age. Hallelujah. The rapture
[1:07:58] of the saint 1 Corinthians 4:15 and also
[1:08:01] 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17
[1:08:04] that people of God there will be a
[1:08:05] rapture in this age.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we are doing. That's why we
[1:08:09] are coming to church to be prepared.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; We are feeding on that word because we
[1:08:13] want to have that rapturing faith.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; When the pastor come here to labor, it's
[1:08:19] a lot of work for him to do. People of
[1:08:20] God, it's not easy.
[1:08:22] Hallelujah. I'm saying that because I
[1:08:24] know I've been I know how it feels. I'm
[1:08:26] a pastor too and I know you have to go
[1:08:28] and study all night. I asked my son I
[1:08:30] couldn't sleep. She said yesterday I
[1:08:32] learned yesterday I'm going to preach
[1:08:33] today. I couldn't sleep. It's a lot of
[1:08:35] work. But that word is to prepare us for
[1:08:40] the rapture.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's why it's good to come to church.
[1:08:43] People of God, come to church people.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Don't stay home and play tapes.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Come and hear the word of God.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. But the brand said the fire
[1:08:51] for ministry is a bright dress wear.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; They they will dress you us for the
[1:08:56] rapture
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; and they said rapturing faith is in the
[1:09:00] messages.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody the more you hear
[1:09:04] the word the more that word changes you.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; You don't see what don't understand
[1:09:08] what's going on in the street world but
[1:09:09] we are being changed. Like that person
[1:09:12] said that black person in the south said
[1:09:15] I I know I ain't what I'm supposed to be
[1:09:17] but I'm sure ain't what I used to be.
[1:09:19] Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You are changing. Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; With that song said from glory to glory
[1:09:25] is changing me.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Is changing me. He's changing me. His
[1:09:31] likeness and image to perfect in me. The
[1:09:35] love of God shown to the world for he's
[1:09:39] changing
[1:09:41] changing me from earthly thing to the
[1:09:45] heavenly
[1:09:47] his likeness and image to perfect in me
[1:09:51] the love of God shown to the as the
[1:09:53] preach the pastor is preaching other
[1:09:54] ministers we are being changed
[1:09:56] hallelujah
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; you just when when at the last supper
[1:10:01] when Lord was going to wash Peter's
[1:10:03] Peter's feet he said Lord Lord That's
[1:10:05] the Lord's job in Israel. He said Lord
[1:10:06] you won't wash my feet. The Lord said
[1:10:08] you don't Peter don't wash your feet you
[1:10:10] have no pard me. Oh Pet said that's
[1:10:12] that's different then not only my feet
[1:10:14] don't all my hair all my the Lord said
[1:10:17] no you don't need to do all that. He
[1:10:19] that cleans needs not what to wash. So
[1:10:21] you're already clean. He said the word I
[1:10:23] spoke to you has cleansed you.
[1:10:26] The sanifying power is the word of God.
[1:10:28] Hallelujah. It's not the word of man.
[1:10:30] It's not pastor Paul's word. It's God's
[1:10:32] word. It's not about my what is his
[1:10:35] word.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You become the word and you see the
[1:10:39] word.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love what my late friend
[1:10:42] Habbran said many years ago said before
[1:10:45] the word can work for you, you must
[1:10:47] first agree with the word.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Don't resend the word of God. Young
[1:10:52] people don't resend the word of God.
[1:10:53] Accept it.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Apply to your life. Hallelujah. I know
[1:10:57] there are some things that you to preach
[1:10:59] in the past that if you preach it today
[1:11:01] the church be will be be few in number
[1:11:06] don't want to preach about it anymore we
[1:11:08] preach about life people's life by
[1:11:10] biting gospel in the church
[1:11:13] hallelujah lost brother pastor preach
[1:11:15] the other day on Sunday they part of
[1:11:18] gospel hallelujah
[1:11:21] don't go about to run your brother and
[1:11:22] sister down hallelujah
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; the Bible says speak evil or No man,
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Don't ever go behind
[1:11:30] your brother or sister. How can you tell
[1:11:32] brother your sister God bless and go
[1:11:33] behind the back and run them? That
[1:11:35] that's not good. That's on Christian.
[1:11:37] That's ungodly.
[1:11:38] Praise the Lord. Always speak good of
[1:11:41] your brothers and sister. Brothers, if
[1:11:43] you have nothing, you don't have
[1:11:45] anything good to say, keep your mouth
[1:11:46] shut. Praise the Lord. I'm sorry. And if
[1:11:51] now that's the mystery of Israel
[1:11:53] and the rapture. Hallelujah. But before
[1:11:56] Israel can receive the gospel, we're
[1:11:58] going to be out of here. Hallelujah. And
[1:12:00] the fourth ministry of is the of the of
[1:12:02] the new is the New Testament church
[1:12:04] testament church as one body composed of
[1:12:08] both Jews and Gentiles. That's right.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says some Jews are going
[1:12:12] to be allowed to come in the gentile
[1:12:13] bride.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And that people like L Petros is a
[1:12:17] Jewish man,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; but believe this message.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; That's God's own prerogative.
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. The fifth mystery is to the
[1:12:24] church as the bride of Christ. We don't
[1:12:26] know that the church the bride of
[1:12:27] Christ, Pastor Paul. No, they don't
[1:12:29] teach us back organization. Jesus
[1:12:32] church. But now we know the church the
[1:12:34] true church is the bride of Christ.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] And I'm going to stop there talking
[1:12:42] about um the the um I need to close
[1:12:46] pastor
[1:12:47] and I'm watching your faces
[1:12:50] and talking about the rapture.
[1:12:54] The Bible said blood flesh and blood
[1:12:57] cannot inherit God's wisdom kingdom. We
[1:13:00] have to be changed. Hallelujah. And I
[1:13:02] probably talk about the seven dimension.
[1:13:04] How remember the seven dimensions?
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He said there are seven dimension.
[1:13:07] Right.
[1:13:09] light matter time. Hallelujah. hate
[1:13:13] hate hell or or grave product that that
[1:13:17] now is on the under the or under the
[1:13:19] altar and part that hallelujah and the
[1:13:22] abort of abot of God are you with
[1:13:24] somebody
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; I had that all that all this the devil's
[1:13:28] m today I had that quote I want to share
[1:13:31] with you but said we live on the first
[1:13:34] three dimension light matter time that's
[1:13:39] why our bodies cannot disintegrate Our
[1:13:42] bodies stay together. Hallelujah. And
[1:13:45] the fourth dimension is science. Praise.
[1:13:48] Praise the Lord. We talk about all kind
[1:13:50] of invention today in America and all
[1:13:51] over the world by science. But said what
[1:13:55] happened? The devil broke into God's
[1:13:56] laboratory.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; That this that's true. He just went to
[1:14:00] the laborator and peeped and closed the
[1:14:02] door and for those few second what he
[1:14:04] saw that's why he was able to achieve
[1:14:07] what he has achieved today. Satan being
[1:14:09] being an impersonator.
[1:14:12] Hallelujah.
[1:14:13] So the so the first three dimension is
[1:14:17] light, mother time. The fourth dimension
[1:14:19] is science. The fifth dimension is hell,
[1:14:21] hes or grave. And the six the sixth is
[1:14:24] paradise that now is. Let me stop there
[1:14:27] before I close tonight. We're talking
[1:14:29] about secret things that belong to God.
[1:14:32] When Adam and Eve sin in Garden of Eden,
[1:14:35] before they sin, they were living
[1:14:36] eternity in the garden, right? They are
[1:14:39] eternal. They are they are God. God of
[1:14:41] the earth and God is God of the whole
[1:14:43] universe.
[1:14:45] Adam named all the animals in the in the
[1:14:47] king in Eden. Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] And um after the sin came to mankind
[1:14:54] after the the fall everything changed.
[1:14:58] And we remember the Bible say in Genesis
[1:14:59] that God drove out of the garden. They
[1:15:03] were driven out of garden. And after
[1:15:05] they died, they could not go to God
[1:15:07] because the door was shut
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; of fellowship.
[1:15:11] But just open that gate. Remember open
[1:15:13] that open ye gate everlasting gate.
[1:15:14] Remember Christ opened that.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's why you don't need to open that
[1:15:17] gate anymore. Today we have to open open
[1:15:19] the door for rapture. I'm come to that
[1:15:21] very close.
[1:15:23] Praise the Lord. Are you still with me?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And after Adam and Adam and Eve all
[1:15:28] generation died, they could not go to
[1:15:30] heaven. So God in demonology said God
[1:15:33] prepare a paradise for them under the
[1:15:35] earth including demology a waiting place
[1:15:40] because they not the blood had not shed
[1:15:42] yet and that's why they were I can tell
[1:15:45] of some story now about that story so
[1:15:48] that I share with people I like that
[1:15:50] story that's why everyone that died from
[1:15:53] Adam to the to before Calvary that's why
[1:15:57] they were waiting for the blood to be
[1:16:00] shed shed
[1:16:02] and after the blood was shed there was a
[1:16:04] rapture
[1:16:06] man 27 right remember Bible said I can
[1:16:09] read it if you have time if you're not
[1:16:11] in a hurry but the Bible told us that in
[1:16:15] M 27 well when Christ crashed on was
[1:16:19] down the cross and in cry the lord was
[1:16:22] Eli Eli lamas bakani b said the grace of
[1:16:26] the saint cracked is that the truth
[1:16:28] that's in the bible That's right.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And then they came out with him after
[1:16:32] his resurrection because they cannot
[1:16:35] come before him because he's a mighty
[1:16:36] conqueror.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with somebody?
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You have to go to that old paradise that
[1:16:40] then was to bring him out himself.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with somebody?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And then when he went there, I I like
[1:16:47] the story that somebody told. He said
[1:16:50] when Lazarus died, Christ had not died
[1:16:51] shed his paid the price of for our sins.
[1:16:54] He said that uh
[1:16:57] when Lazar died
[1:16:59] was a a good follower of Christ and was
[1:17:03] faithful believer. When he pass died
[1:17:08] he went to that same place to wait. But
[1:17:11] when he arrived there like a a big city
[1:17:13] a waiting place. When he arrived there
[1:17:17] it was fellowship time.
[1:17:20] But man said death does not change who
[1:17:22] you are. Amen.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That only change your place of our board
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; where you live. That's why he say if
[1:17:27] you're a liar here, you be a liar hell.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian here, you're going
[1:17:31] to be a Christian over there.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; So when they got there to tele
[1:17:34] fellowship time and he saw and he saw
[1:17:37] father Abraham, he saw Isaac and Israel,
[1:17:40] Jacob and every everybody g their
[1:17:42] testimony. He said they postponed to
[1:17:44] testify was father Abraham talk about
[1:17:47] how he knew the Lord. Say oh children I
[1:17:49] know him. I know him. They say how do
[1:17:52] you know? say I know him. I remember
[1:17:54] when he came to me under the oak tree
[1:17:56] with two angels. He promised to give me
[1:17:59] a son. Me being an old man and he also
[1:18:03] told me about this plan to distrust and
[1:18:05] Gomorrah.
[1:18:06] After father Abraham was done, here come
[1:18:08] Isaac said, "Father Abraham, father, I
[1:18:10] know him too." They said, "How do you
[1:18:11] know him?" He said, "Well, after you are
[1:18:13] gone, he came to me and revealed him and
[1:18:15] said to me and said, we establish his
[1:18:17] covenant with you with me too." Really?
[1:18:20] Yeah, I know him too. Then here come
[1:18:22] Jacob said, "Grandfather Abraham, father
[1:18:25] Isaac, I know him too." Say, "You how do
[1:18:26] you know me?" He said, "Well, I can't
[1:18:28] remember. I can never forget that day
[1:18:30] that he came to me. We wrestle all night
[1:18:33] long."
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; He wrestle with me and I wrestle with I
[1:18:37] let him go until he blessed me and he
[1:18:39] touched my side and been to limp. That's
[1:18:42] right.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Really? And here's a new arrival in
[1:18:44] paradise. Then Lazarus and Christ was
[1:18:47] over there on earth in in in Jerusalem.
[1:18:51] And that story said
[1:18:54] that um the Lazarus said, "Father
[1:18:58] Abraham
[1:19:00] uh Father Isaac, I know him to this day.
[1:19:02] You are just a new arrival here in
[1:19:04] paradise. How do you know him?" Said, "I
[1:19:06] know him." He said, "Look." And at that
[1:19:08] time, Christ was at at this at the grave
[1:19:10] on earth.
[1:19:12] And he said, "Oh, I know him too." They
[1:19:14] said, "How you know?" He said, "Oh, I
[1:19:16] walked with him and went to preach with
[1:19:17] him." He said, "We eat on the same
[1:19:19] table, even sleep on the same bed." He
[1:19:21] said, "Nobody ever call my name like he
[1:19:23] called my name." He said, "Brother
[1:19:24] Lazarus."
[1:19:26] He said, "Nobody ever called my name
[1:19:27] like said about that time Christ was at
[1:19:29] his grave on earth and call him Lazarus
[1:19:34] come forth."
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; At that voice, all these days too. He
[1:19:40] said they said when l when Christ called
[1:19:43] Lazarus that voice echoed into eternity
[1:19:47] sign for the owner of that name.
[1:19:49] Hallelujah. And that name if God Christ
[1:19:53] has not said Lazarus with that voice all
[1:19:54] the death in come up that proper
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; but when he say Lazarus that voice went
[1:20:01] to the owner bear that name straight
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; and Lazarus said in fact matter fact
[1:20:05] he's calling right now I got to go and
[1:20:08] left and came back to life on the other
[1:20:09] side on earth.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the that was
[1:20:15] I need to close tonight. People of God,
[1:20:17] these are the things that God has
[1:20:18] revealed to us this last and they are
[1:20:20] true.
[1:20:22] Praise the Lord somebody.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And they now the father that when cried
[1:20:28] down on the cross
[1:20:31] after Yes. Well, and if you readology
[1:20:37] said when you're going down down there,
[1:20:40] the first place you come to the where
[1:20:42] the s of unjust are sinners who turn
[1:20:45] down the gospel of the of God in their
[1:20:47] day. That's the first place you come to.
[1:20:49] You go keep going down, you come to
[1:20:51] where the devil himself is. He has a
[1:20:53] throne. How many know the devil has a
[1:20:56] throne?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 28. in Nigeria some years ago
[1:21:00] and someone probably remember this one
[1:21:02] preacher testified how that he doesn't
[1:21:05] have much crowd in his church and some
[1:21:08] other preachers that have a large crowd
[1:21:09] large crowd in their churches came to
[1:21:10] him and said what are you what's wrong
[1:21:12] with you how come you don't have more
[1:21:15] members in the church what's wrong come
[1:21:17] on jo
[1:21:19] our our group so he said why do I do he
[1:21:22] said well come we're going to go to a
[1:21:24] place we're meeting at night
[1:21:27] you have to come with
[1:21:29] So they put him in the store so when the
[1:21:31] day they the day that fix came they they
[1:21:36] put him in an SUV and drove out of town
[1:21:38] into the woods and then later they come
[1:21:41] to a river at that river they said they
[1:21:44] found a ko
[1:21:46] what you call boat I don't know what you
[1:21:47] call boat we s on the on the river
[1:21:50] nobody's there at that night and they
[1:21:52] packed their SUV cars and um enter the
[1:21:55] cano and start paddling kenno and they
[1:21:58] want on that river all of a sudden that
[1:22:02] can went inside the water and they found
[1:22:06] themselves on the B Palashia place under
[1:22:08] the water. This is a true story of a
[1:22:11] preacher, Pentecostal preacher.
[1:22:14] And uh when they landed there, they saw
[1:22:17] somebody this devil himself on the
[1:22:19] throne.
[1:22:20] And you know that's Satan's plan from
[1:22:23] the from the beginning. That's why he
[1:22:25] was kicked out of heaven. He want to be
[1:22:27] like God. Is that not the truth? Isaiah
[1:22:30] Isaiah chapter 12 Isaiah 28 he said I
[1:22:33] want to raise his his throne above the
[1:22:35] stars of God which is the children of
[1:22:37] God.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Right? You know that that's this day he
[1:22:40] has already got that throne. The devil
[1:22:43] add that on today. He has achieved his
[1:22:44] purpose. Today millions, billions are
[1:22:47] watching Satan today in the name of
[1:22:48] Christianity. Don't even know it.
[1:22:52] Preach a message a dutured by the world.
[1:22:56] Hallelujah. And Satan's Eden. Praise the
[1:22:59] Lord. The devil has achieved his purpose
[1:23:02] in this in this day. And uh but thank
[1:23:05] God for this message that we know the
[1:23:07] truth.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ye shall know the truth and
[1:23:10] the truth shall set you free." Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; That's why I cannot come to this this
[1:23:14] message and be to play around.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; We want to be saddened of God. We want
[1:23:18] to be serious with this message
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and and live for God. Live for Christ,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; be a witness for for Christ with our
[1:23:25] lives.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; We have come too far to look back.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; There are too many things. And then and
[1:23:32] then talking about then when Christ died
[1:23:34] on the cross he emptied out
[1:23:37] he emptied out that old paradise because
[1:23:40] there's a resurrection Matthew 27 right
[1:23:43] and he took those saints let's read it
[1:23:45] if you don't mind do you have time is
[1:23:48] that okay let's read Matthew 27
[1:23:52] I'm going to pray after this I have I've
[1:23:55] not touched the other mysteries Matthew
[1:23:57] 27
[1:24:17] Okay. 27.
[1:24:25] Let's read from verse
[1:24:27] Verse 44 46. And about the 9inth hour
[1:24:31] Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
[1:24:33] Eli, Eli, Lansakani,
[1:24:36] that is to say, my God, my God, why hast
[1:24:40] thou forsaken me? Some of them that
[1:24:42] stood there when they heard that said,
[1:24:46] this man collect for Elias. And
[1:24:49] straightway one of them ran and took a
[1:24:52] sponge and fill it with v vinegar and
[1:24:56] put it on a reed and give it to drink.
[1:24:59] The rest said let be let us see whether
[1:25:02] Elias will come to save him.
[1:25:06] But Jesus said when Jesus Jesus when he
[1:25:09] had cried again with a loud voice
[1:25:11] yielded up the ghost and behold the veil
[1:25:14] of the temple was rent in twain from the
[1:25:17] top to the bottom and the earth did
[1:25:19] quake and the ros rent and the graves
[1:25:23] were opened. Watch and many bodies of
[1:25:26] the saints which left arose.
[1:25:29] Well, Paul said even they saw father
[1:25:31] Abraham and Sarah two feet on the street
[1:25:35] of Jerusalem
[1:25:37] and they appear Abraham said we we've
[1:25:40] been noticed and disappeared.
[1:25:43] Hallelujah.
[1:25:46] And they came out of the grave after his
[1:25:48] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:25:50] and appeared unto many. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:55] That is why how when God Christ emptied
[1:25:57] out old paradise cuz he had another one
[1:26:00] made up here in heaven which is the
[1:26:03] sixth dimension today
[1:26:05] and the if you are a Christian the Lord
[1:26:08] call it home today you're not going down
[1:26:09] there you're going up
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; we also call it solo the altar
[1:26:13] hallelujah it's is real place but taken
[1:26:16] there cut beyond the cut of time he was
[1:26:19] taken there the angel called him one
[1:26:20] time said in the one time in his bedroom
[1:26:23] said we like to see beyond a quarter of
[1:26:25] time said yes he will help me and he all
[1:26:29] of a sudden he saw that he left his body
[1:26:31] is that the truth and he find himself in
[1:26:35] a place beautiful place there's no
[1:26:36] language vocabulary to describe the
[1:26:38] glory of that place and saw the saint
[1:26:42] there and he said he even saw his
[1:26:44] daughter she chiron rose right and
[1:26:48] Sheron said daddy I said daddy I'm not

[1:27:01] heaven." And that
[1:27:05] brother said, he said, "Heaven? Yes,
[1:27:07] this is heaven." Said, "Mama is waiting
[1:27:08] for you in the house."

[1:27:15] believe that you also have your house
[1:27:17] there. Your mansions. That's

[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you. The word, brother.
[1:33:47] Thanks, sir. Thank you. Yes.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; In
[1:33:52] Jesus
[1:33:54] name
[1:33:56] we press on.
[1:34:00] Amen.
[1:34:03] Dear Lord
[1:34:06] with surprise.
[1:34:12] Thank you Lord. before our eyes.
[1:34:20] We find the strength
[1:34:25] to press on.
[1:34:30] Before we're dismissed tonight, I don't
[1:34:32] want us to miss the theme of the
[1:34:34] scripture he quoted over and over again.
[1:34:36] And don't miss the depth of this
[1:34:37] scripture that said, "The secret things
[1:34:40] belong unto the Lord our God.
[1:34:44] But
[1:34:45] those things which are revealed belong
[1:34:48] unto us. God doesn't want to keep them
[1:34:50] to himself. He wants to give them to his
[1:34:52] children. Don't you feel privileged
[1:34:54] tonight that we are the people of the
[1:34:56] mysteries. All the mysteries he's
[1:34:58] talking about. Jesus said it's given to
[1:35:00] you to know the mysteries. It's not
[1:35:02] given to everybody. And that doesn't
[1:35:03] mean we put anybody out. But we should
[1:35:05] say thank God that I when I get a
[1:35:08] revelation it's God revealing secrets to
[1:35:11] me to his elect. And get don't you
[1:35:13] parents don't forget it's to us and it's
[1:35:15] to our children.
[1:35:17] Our children need revelation too. Can
[1:35:19] you say amen? And when you see that
[1:35:21] picture of the Jews, they're catching
[1:35:23] the mystery even back then. They're
[1:35:25] catching the mystery of prophecy and
[1:35:27] they're acting out by going back into
[1:35:29] the homeland. All of that our actions
[1:35:32] are to to act on behalf of the word of
[1:35:34] God because we're fulfilling it because
[1:35:38] he's holding the secrets but he's
[1:35:39] revealing them unto us so we can live
[1:35:41] them out. It's not just that we catch
[1:35:42] the mystery, but we live it out. We live
[1:35:45] it out. And guess who's going to fulfill
[1:35:46] the mystery of the rapture?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Uh he's preaching to you tonight.
[1:35:52] There's a people that's going to fulfill
[1:35:53] that mystery. We're a people of that
[1:35:55] mystery. That's why it's real to us when
[1:35:58] he talks about the resurrection, the
[1:35:59] rapture, something registered down
[1:36:01] inside. Why? Because we're not just
[1:36:03] reading about it out of our Bibles.
[1:36:05] We're a people of that mystery. Praise
[1:36:06] the Lord. God bless you. We're going to
[1:36:08] close in prayer tonight. God bless you.
[1:36:10] you'd be dismissed to get your children
[1:36:13] home and such, but it's been good to be
[1:36:14] in the house of the Lord. I is brother
[1:36:16] Dan, it's his birthday, Sister Jane,
[1:36:18] he's 80 today, is it next week?
[1:36:22] Yesterday, man, I didn't know that. So,
[1:36:25] some of the cake they have back there
[1:36:26] for Aaron is for you, too. How about
[1:36:29] that? Happy birthday to you.
[1:36:33] All right. Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:36:35] you, sir. Enjoyed the word tonight,
[1:36:36] Brother Tony. God bless you. Heavenly
[1:36:39] Father, we're just coming to the
[1:36:40] dismissal of the service and we want to
[1:36:42] say thank you for the word that's so
[1:36:44] rich to us that this great these secrets
[1:36:47] that you held in you for all this time.
[1:36:50] You want to give them to somebody. You
[1:36:51] want to you want to deposit them to a
[1:36:53] people and watch them live it out. And
[1:36:55] we feel grateful tonight. May we uphold
[1:36:58] the name of Christ the very best we can,
[1:37:01] Lord. And to if we're privileged in our
[1:37:03] heart, then we know we want to live it
[1:37:05] just the just yielded to you. And I
[1:37:07] thank you, Father, for these precious
[1:37:10] riches. Lord, bless your people of God
[1:37:12] as they go home tonight and the homes
[1:37:14] that are listening. Bless the homes with
[1:37:16] your token in your presence. Lord, may
[1:37:18] you go with us with your angels around
[1:37:20] us. We pray and how we love you tonight.
[1:37:22] Take us now in your presence in Jesus
