[0:00] Let's
[0:09] sing that verse. I have a maker.
[0:13] I have
[0:15] a maker.
[0:21] He formed
[0:24] my heart
[0:28] before
[0:30] before
[0:32] even time began.
[0:37] My life was in
[0:40] his hands.
[0:47] He knows
[0:49] my name.
[0:55] He knows
[0:57] my every
[1:00] thought.
[1:03] And he sees
[1:06] each tear
[1:08] that falls.
[1:11] And he hears me when
[1:14] I call singing that I have a father.
[1:21] I have
[1:23] a father.
[1:27] He calls me his own. He calls me his
[1:32] own.
[1:34] He'll never never leave you. He'll never
[1:40] leave
[1:42] me.
[1:45] No matter
[1:47] where
[1:48] I go,
[1:52] he knows.
[1:55] He knows
[1:57] my name.
[2:01] Yes, he knows. He knows
[2:05] my every
[2:08] thought.
[2:11] He sees
[2:14] each tear
[2:16] that falls
[2:18] and he hears me well. One more time I
[2:22] call. Oh, he knows.
[2:28] He knows
[2:30] my name.
[2:34] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:36] He knows
[2:39] my end. every thought before you even
[2:43] pray.
[2:45] He sees
[2:47] each tear
[2:49] that falls
[2:52] and he hears me when
[2:56] I call.
[2:58] Amen. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much
[3:00] for another opportunity to gather in
[3:02] your presence and worship you and be
[3:06] alongside the body, Lord. and we love
[3:08] you so much. We pray that you would just
[3:10] bless this sermon, this worship service,
[3:13] and just speak to our hearts today,
[3:15] Lord, in a special way. Jesus name we
[3:17] pray. Amen.
[3:20] Amen.
[3:22] Will you stand up with me? Let's let's
[3:24] sing that old song at the cross,
[3:28] the chorus. At the cross, at the cross,
[3:33] where I first saw the light and the
[3:36] burden of my heart rolled away.
[3:41] It was there by faith. I received my
[3:46] sight and now I am happy. Oh, one more
[3:50] time. At the cross, at the cross, at the
[3:54] cross, where I first saw the light and
[3:58] the burden of my heart rolled away.
[4:03] And it was there by faith. I received my
[4:08] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[4:14] Let's sing this one. You ask me why I'm
[4:17] happy and I'll just tell you why.
[4:21] Because
[4:22] my sins are gone.
[4:26] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[4:30] where they are, I'll say,
[4:33] my sins are gone.
[4:36] Oh, they're underneath the blood of the
[4:40] cross of Calvary.
[4:42] As far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[4:48] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[4:51] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[4:55] My sins are gone. Let's do the next one.
[4:59] Was at the old time altar when God came
[5:02] in my heart and now
[5:06] my sins are gone.
[5:09] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[5:13] did depart. I'm glad
[5:17] my sins are gone. Amen. They're
[5:21] underneath the blood of the cross of
[5:24] Calvary.
[5:26] As far removed as darkness is from dawn
[5:31] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[5:34] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[5:38] My sins are gone.
[5:42] And when Satan comes to tempt me and
[5:45] tries to make me doubt, I say
[5:49] my sins are gone.
[5:52] You got me into trouble, but Jesus got
[5:56] me out. I am glad
[5:59] my sins are gone. Why don't you go greet
[6:01] everybody today? They're underneath the
[6:04] blood of the cross of Calvary.
[6:08] as far removed as darkness is from dawn
[6:13] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[6:16] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[6:20] Let's have the band play it. Let's go
[6:21] greet each other. Amen.
[6:42] They're under. Oh, they're underneath
[6:46] the blood of the cross of Calvary.
[6:50] As far removed as darkness is from dawn
[6:55] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[6:58] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[7:03] My sins are gone. Oh, praise God,
[7:08] my sins are gone.
[7:11] Praise God,
[7:13] my sins are gone.
[7:19] Amen.
[7:22] Amen. Let's pull up that song,
[7:23] sufficient for today.
[7:26] Sing if you know it, sing it with me. If
[7:28] you don't, please pay attention to these
[7:30] words cuz it is it so moving.
[7:37] There may be storms
[7:41] that will move out the way
[7:45] and trials will come
[7:50] to only test my faith.
[7:54] What I've learned about your favor,
[7:58] your mercy, and your grace
[8:03] is they go on forever
[8:07] is sufficient for today.
[8:10] Let's do the next verse.
[8:13] When I'm worried about tomorrow,
[8:18] I won't be overwhelmed.
[8:22] And the burdens that I've carried, I
[8:26] will choose to lay them down.
[8:30] Cuz what I've learned about your favor,
[8:35] your mercy, and your grace
[8:39] is they go on forever.
[8:43] They're sufficient for singing.
[8:46] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[8:52] Hallelujah.
[8:56] Hallelujah.
[9:01] There's sufficient for today. One more
[9:03] time. Sing hallelujah.
[9:09] Hallelujah.
[9:13] Hallelujah.
[9:18] They're sufficient for today.
[9:22] In the joy and in the sorrow,
[9:26] I find you just the same.
[9:31] And behind my darkest mornings, there's
[9:35] a peace I can't explain. Amen. I'm so
[9:40] grateful for your favor,
[9:43] for your mercy, and your grace.
[9:48] Cuz they go on forever.
[9:52] They're sufficient for us. Sing
[9:54] hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.

[10:09] There's sufficient for today. Sing
[10:13] hallelujah.
[10:18] Hallelujah.
[10:22] Hallelujah.
[10:26] They're sufficient for today.
[10:30] Amen.
[10:32] Sing. One day I'll finally see you and
[10:37] my faith will be my sign
[10:42] and all my present sufferings will be
[10:46] gone and left behind. Amen. I'll be
[10:51] standing in your favor,
[10:54] your mercy, and your grace.
[10:59] Cuz they go on forever.
[11:03] They still they still go on forever.
[11:07] Oh, they still go on forever.

[12:08] glory.
[12:12] Because of who you are, I give you
[12:18] praise.
[12:22] Because of who you are,
[12:26] I will lift my voice and say, "Lord, I
[12:31] worship you because of who you are."
[12:39] Oh Lord, I worship you because of who
[12:45] you are. Let's sing that again. Oh,
[12:50] because of who you are, I give you
[12:54] glory.
[12:57] Oh, we give you glory because of who you
[13:01] are. I give you praise

[13:25] Oh Lord, I worship you because of who
[13:31] you are.

[13:43] Amen.
[13:44] Jehovah na
[13:48] Lord, you reign in victory.
[13:53] Jehovah Sho,
[13:57] we need you, Lord. My prince of peace
[14:03] and I worship you because of who you
[14:08] are.
[14:11] Oh Lord, I worship you because of who
[14:17] you are.
[14:24] When I think about the Lord,
[14:29] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[14:34] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[14:39] healed me to the uttermost.
[14:44] When I think about the Lord,
[14:48] how he picked me up and turned me
[14:52] around. How he placed my feet
[14:57] on solid ground.
[15:00] It makes me want to shout,
[15:04] "Hallelujah.
[15:06] Thank you, Jesus.
[15:09] Lord, you're worthy of all of the glory
[15:13] and all of the honor and all of the
[15:16] praise.
[15:19] It makes me want to shout,
[15:22] "Halleluah.
[15:25] Thank you, Jesus.
[15:27] Lord, you're worthy of all of the glory
[15:31] and all of the honor and all of the
[15:35] praise.
[15:38] universe. When I think about the Lord,
[15:44] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[15:49] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[15:54] healed me to the uttermost.
[15:58] When I think about the Lord,
[16:02] how he picked me up and turned me
[16:06] around, how he placed my feet
[16:11] on solid ground.
[16:14] It makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah.
[16:20] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy.
[16:25] full of the glory and all of the honor
[16:29] and all of the praise.
[16:32] It makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah.
[16:38] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[16:43] all of the glory and all of the honor
[16:47] and all the praise."
[16:50] Let's try this one.
[16:54] I just can't give up now.
[17:02] I've come too far from where I've
[17:07] started from. Amen. Nobody told me
[17:12] nobody told me the road would be easy.
[17:19] And I don't believe he brought me this
[17:23] far to leave me one more time. Oh, I
[17:27] can't give up now.
[17:29] I just can't give up now.
[17:38] I've come too far from where I've
[17:42] started from.
[17:47] Nobody told me the road would be easy.
[17:54] And I don't believe he brought me this
[17:58] far to leave me. Let's sing a verse of
[18:01] that.
[18:03] Oh, there will be mountains
[18:07] that I will have to climb. Amen. And
[18:12] there will be battles
[18:16] that I will have to fight.
[18:20] But victory or defeat,
[18:24] it's up to me to decide.
[18:29] Oh, how can I expect to win
[18:34] if I never try?
[18:40] Oh,
[18:42] I just can't give up now.
[18:50] I've come too far from where I've
[18:54] started from.
[18:59] Nobody told me the road would be easy.
[19:06] And I don't believe he brought me this
[19:10] far. Let's sing it again. Can we have
[19:12] the choir come up? Let's get the choir
[19:14] up here. Oh,
[19:16] I just can't give up now.
[19:25] I've come too far from where I've
[19:29] started from.
[19:34] Nobody told me that the road would be
[19:39] easy. And I don't believe he brought me
[19:44] this far to leave me one more time. I
[19:48] just can't give up now.
[19:51] I just can't give up now.
[19:59] I've come too far from where I've
[20:03] started from.
[20:08] Nobody told me the road would be easy.
[20:15] And I don't believe he brought me this
[20:19] far to leave me. No, I don't believe.
[20:23] No, I don't believe he brought me this
[20:27] far to leave me.
[20:31] No, no, I don't. I don't believe he
[20:35] brought me this far to leave me.
[20:40] Amen. You may have your seats. Amen.
[20:57] that trouble me.
[21:02] Many are they that rise up against me.
[21:10] Any be which say
[21:13] of my soul
[21:19] there is no help for him in God
[21:28] Lord
[21:30] are a shield for me
[21:34] my glory and the lifter of My hand

[26:23] reminding us of David's psalm that he's
[26:26] a shield for us. Can you say amen?
[26:28] Lifter of our head, a protector, and he
[26:31] is really the only protector in this
[26:33] day. We can do what we can to protect
[26:36] ourselves and we do what we can, but
[26:37] he's our ultimate protector. And thank
[26:40] you choir. We've been asking for them to
[26:42] sing a little bit more. And so we're
[26:43] blessed this morning to worship with
[26:45] them as they lead us into worship. We
[26:47] appreciate so much uh their their gifts
[26:51] and given to God. I was just looking at
[26:53] all of them and seeing the the lives
[26:56] dedicated to the Lord. See the the
[26:58] sisters looking such an expression of
[27:01] the holiness of God and we appreciate
[27:03] that. A lot of singers out there, but we
[27:05] appreciate those that have a life that
[27:07] goes with the song. Praise the Lord.
[27:09] Want to welcome the Ruths with us.
[27:11] They're a part of our congregation, but
[27:12] they're not around a lot. And uh you're
[27:16] welcome to come anytime and be around a
[27:18] lot more. You guys, we appreciate you
[27:20] from Iowa. God bless you and for being
[27:22] with us this morning. And some other
[27:24] visitors. The Lord be with each and
[27:26] every one of you. It's a blessed day to
[27:28] serve the Lord. Amen. It's a blessed day
[27:31] to be a Christian
[27:32] &gt;&gt; and uh we're just very looking forward
[27:34] to sharing in the word of God together.
[27:37] I don't think there's any other
[27:38] announcements except to thank uh brother
[27:40] Boaz and sister Mary and brother Ryan,
[27:41] sister Haley, and also all their other
[27:43] helpers for putting on such a lovely day
[27:46] yesterday. Such a nice day, but also a
[27:48] nice dinner. Thank you, Boaz. Thank you,
[27:51] Miriam. We appreciate it. Amen.
[27:55] Wonderful, wonderful time of fellowship
[27:57] and the activities and also the food as
[27:59] well. Whoever did all that food, you're
[28:01] certainly right down my line. That's for
[28:03] sure. Praise the Lord. Can we stand
[28:05] together this morning and turn our
[28:07] Bibles to Jeremiah Jeremiah 29?
[28:12] We'll read a portion of scripture here
[28:15] that we just moved upon here the last
[28:18] couple weeks of the Lord and want to say
[28:21] some encouraging words to you this
[28:23] morning. You know, sometimes we just
[28:25] need a word of encouragement
[28:27] &gt;&gt; and I'd like to give that if the Lord
[28:29] allow me this morning. And also in the
[28:31] meantime, maybe give the devil a real
[28:33] black eye. And uh I think this will do
[28:35] it for sure. Jeremiah 2029
[28:39] and we'll start reading together. God
[28:42] bless you all. God bless your musicians.
[28:44] Thank you all the offices and helps in
[28:47] the church of God. We appreciate it so
[28:48] much. Jeremiah 29 and verse one. Now
[28:51] these are the words of the letter that
[28:53] Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem
[28:56] under the residue of the elders which
[28:58] were carried away captives and to the
[29:00] priests and to the prophets and to all
[29:02] the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had
[29:05] carried away captive from Jerusalem to
[29:07] Babylon.
[29:09] After that, Jonaniah the king and the
[29:12] queen and the Unix and the princes of
[29:13] Judah and Jerusalem and the carpenters
[29:16] and the smiths were departed from
[29:18] Jerusalem by the hand of Elasa the son
[29:21] of Sha Shaina and Gariah the son of
[29:23] Hilka whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent
[29:26] unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of
[29:29] Babylon, saying,
[29:31] Thus sayith the Lord of hosts, the God
[29:33] of Israel, unto all that are carried
[29:35] away captives whom I have caused to be
[29:39] carried away from Jerusalem unto
[29:41] Babylon. God himself says that actually
[29:45] I allowed this this captivity. I allowed
[29:48] this. Uh there are things that happen in
[29:51] our lifetime that are self-inflicted.
[29:54] There are things that happen in our
[29:55] lifetime that other people inflict upon
[29:58] us. There are things that happen in our
[30:00] life that circumstances cause. And then
[30:03] there's the bigger thing of when God
[30:05] allows something and God is taking a
[30:07] little bit of ownership here, saying
[30:08] that that I carry I carried you away to
[30:11] Jerusalem unto Babylon. Build ye houses
[30:14] and dwell in them and plant gardens and
[30:16] eat the fruit of them. Take ye wives and
[30:18] begott sons and daughters and take wives
[30:20] for your sons and give your daughters to
[30:23] husbands that they may bear sons and
[30:25] daughters that they may be increased
[30:27] there and not diminished. and seek the
[30:30] peace of the city, whether I've caused
[30:32] you to be carried away captives, and
[30:33] pray unto the Lord for it. For in the
[30:35] peace thereof shall ye have peace. For
[30:38] thus sayaith the Lord of hosts, the God
[30:40] of Israel, let not your prophets and
[30:42] your divi divers that be in the midst of
[30:45] you, deceive you, neither hearken to
[30:48] their to your dreams, which he caused to
[30:51] be dreamed. For they prophesy falsely
[30:53] unto you in my name. I have not sent
[30:56] them, sayaeth the Lord. I feel the Lord
[30:59] is saying that when you're there uh
[31:01] marry wives, have children, and and get
[31:04] the best peace out of the thing that you
[31:06] can and uh live as best as you can, but
[31:09] be aware of the false prophecies among
[31:12] among us that rise up. Be aware of them.
[31:14] And then he goes into this verse 10, for
[31:17] thus sayaeth the Lord, that after 70
[31:19] years be accomplished at Babylon, I will
[31:22] visit you and perform my good word
[31:24] toward you in causing you to return to
[31:27] this place. You can imagine when this
[31:29] letter is being read to those in
[31:30] Babylon, they're beginning to rejoice in
[31:32] their heart cuz God's giving a timeline
[31:34] and saying, "I'm not going to leave you
[31:36] there for forever. I'm going to deliver
[31:39] you out of your captivity." I imagine
[31:41] that felt good. But you know what? This
[31:43] goes even deeper. Verse 11, for I know
[31:46] the thoughts that I think toward you,
[31:48] saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and
[31:51] not of evil, to give you an expected
[31:55] end.
[31:56] Isn't it good to know the thoughts that
[31:58] God thinks towards us?
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:01] Then shall you call upon me, and you
[32:03] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[32:05] hearken unto you, and you shall seek me
[32:07] and find me, when you shall search with
[32:09] me with all of your heart. And I will be
[32:12] found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I
[32:14] will turn away your captivity, and I
[32:17] will gather you from all the nations,
[32:19] and from all the places whether I have
[32:21] driven you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will
[32:23] bring you again into the place whence I
[32:26] cause you to be carried away captive.
[32:30] Amen. And heavenly father, we ask Lord
[32:32] that you will be mindful of this this
[32:36] morning as we have gathered together
[32:38] Lord of this most important moment.
[32:42] Everything in our lives Lord revolves
[32:44] around the revelation that you deposit
[32:48] to our hearts. And Lord, what we can
[32:50] receive here, Lord, would be influential
[32:53] to every other question and every other
[32:55] thing and every problem, everything Lord
[32:58] that we don't understand, Lord, this
[33:01] this would be a channel this morning
[33:03] that you could use in order to speak to
[33:06] us. And so I pray, Father, you'll take
[33:09] each life into your hands. We pray that
[33:12] Lord we would be able to move our other
[33:14] thoughts and things away from us this
[33:16] morning and we be able to look into your
[33:18] face and look into you Lord and and and
[33:20] reach out in seeking you and say
[33:22] something is this promise to Israel said
[33:25] if you seek me then you will be found of
[33:28] me and Lord we hold on to that promise
[33:30] our hearts seek after you this morning
[33:33] and we pray father that whatever is
[33:35] wrong that you will make right and
[33:37] correct it by your word we pray father
[33:39] that you'll minister minister to each
[33:40] one, those that are tired from laboring
[33:43] yesterday, Lord, and serving. May you
[33:45] bless them for their uh reward them for
[33:48] their sacrifices and labors, Lord, and
[33:50] be with them. We pray. Also ask you to
[33:53] help me, Lord. A little sickness here, a
[33:55] little bit of cold and some others in
[33:57] the congregation, some that couldn't
[33:58] sing in the choir and uh the enemy just
[34:01] trying to hold them back with sickness.
[34:03] And Lord, maybe some others are feeling
[34:05] it this morning. And I just pray that
[34:07] you'll bring your healing balm, your
[34:09] healing touch to us this morning.
[34:11] Father, may you minister to every life
[34:13] that's here, whether through physically
[34:15] or emotionally or spiritually. Lord, you
[34:18] provide that place for us this morning.
[34:20] And we'll give you glory for it in Jesus
[34:23] name. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[34:25] seated.
[34:31] It must have been quite a wonderful
[34:33] moment for Israel or those that were in
[34:36] captivity to hear these words from the
[34:39] prophet of God through a letter and to
[34:42] hear uh I guess I'll call it a spoken
[34:45] word book being read from the prophet
[34:47] and it was sent from the prophet
[34:48] Jeremiah and they were listening to what
[34:51] he said in this letter and they had
[34:54] heard from Jeremiah's letter before they
[34:56] even left actually Jeremiah was already
[34:58] prophesying of uh a rebuke because he
[35:02] was giving the reasons why that the
[35:04] armies of Babylon were going to come in
[35:06] and take you captive. And a lot of it
[35:08] was because of Israel's rebellion
[35:10] because they had turned away from the
[35:12] Lord. They had turned to idols. And so
[35:14] the people had heard from the prophet
[35:17] many things about rebuke and many things
[35:19] about their uh why they got into this
[35:22] trouble. They had heard the prophet
[35:23] Jeremiah speak these things and they had
[35:26] heard about their mistakes and they had
[35:28] heard the reasons why they went into
[35:30] Babylon. They had heard the path that
[35:32] they took over many years that got them
[35:34] into this state of being exiled into
[35:37] Babylon. And a true prophet of course
[35:40] would not hold back that rebuke. A true
[35:42] prophet will tell us uh where we're
[35:44] wrong. A true prophet will rebuke and
[35:47] and a matter of fact God uses them to
[35:49] rebuke the entire nation when a nation
[35:51] has left God. There's a dispensational
[35:54] rebuke that comes from a prophet. And
[35:56] there are many things that are corrected
[35:59] and many things that are said that
[36:00] nobody else will say that a prophet will
[36:03] say. Uh I've grown in my experience to
[36:05] love that part of God speaking through a
[36:08] prophet. I don't run from that at all
[36:10] because I know as I was telling the
[36:11] young people Friday night and trying to
[36:13] encourage them to listen to the prophet
[36:15] of this age because I know that when you
[36:17] look at the conditions of our time and
[36:19] you look at uh the the the conditions
[36:22] similar to the days of Noah, the
[36:24] conditions similar to the days of Sodom
[36:26] and when you you can see what conditions
[36:28] are there, there's one conclusion that
[36:30] we need and that is please God send us a
[36:34] prophet.
[36:35] And so you can you can bulk at that all
[36:38] you want to, but when you know the
[36:39] conditions, you'll look through the
[36:41] Bible, you say, "There's one thing we
[36:42] needed. We needed a voice of a prophet
[36:44] to speak and God to speak through him."
[36:46] And so with that, you of course have the
[36:48] rebuke and to many things that being uh
[36:52] showing where you got off track and and
[36:54] so a true prophet would not hold back
[36:56] that rebuke and we thank God for that.
[36:59] And he actually gave the exact time when
[37:01] it would end uh their captivity. So he's
[37:04] given a time frame of 70 years. There
[37:07] was another false prophet there that uh
[37:10] gave another prophecy. Uh while he said
[37:13] that, he said, "You're going to be there
[37:15] 70 years and I'm going to bring you
[37:16] back." And another false prophet was
[37:18] there. And while he he said, "No, no."
[37:20] And and maybe this false prophet was
[37:22] being influenced by some of them who
[37:24] were standing there listening, some of
[37:26] Israel, some of the people saying, "My
[37:28] 70 years, uh uh you know, my are are you
[37:32] sure? Uh, you know, Jeremiah, are you
[37:34] sure? Is it is it that long? That's a
[37:36] long time. And maybe out of the emotions
[37:39] of the people, Haniah said, "No, no, no,
[37:42] no, no. I'm prophesying it's going to be
[37:44] only 2 years." And maybe he was catering
[37:47] to the emotions of the people who did
[37:49] not want to hear. 70 years is a long
[37:51] time. My goodness, I don't know if we
[37:53] can make it that long. And so, another
[37:55] prophet comes and says something
[37:57] different in order to cater maybe to the
[38:00] people's emotions. say, and he
[38:01] prophesies just as strong. Two years,
[38:03] you'll only be there two years and God
[38:06] will bring you out. I'm telling you
[38:07] friends, we live in the same time when
[38:09] there's many other voices that's saying
[38:11] something opposite of what the prophet
[38:13] of the hour says.
[38:16] And maybe it's because they didn't want
[38:17] to hear that long. And yet in this
[38:20] letter was a personal message for his
[38:22] elect, those that are in Babylon. He
[38:24] said, "I'm going to bring you back to
[38:26] Jerusalem. Like I said, I'm going to
[38:28] gather you together. I'm going to gather
[38:30] you from all the places that you have
[38:32] been scattered and I'm going to bring
[38:34] you back to Jerusalem. There's going to
[38:36] be a remnant come back and I'm going to
[38:38] bring you back. I will remember you. And
[38:40] at the end of 70 years, there's going to
[38:42] be a time and and when that time
[38:44] strikes, there's going to be a shout.
[38:46] There's going to be a voice. There's
[38:47] going to be a trump. Those of you who
[38:49] know the scriptures for the last days
[38:51] know what I'm talking about. And the
[38:52] first thing he does in the coming of the
[38:54] Lord is there's a shout. And he says a
[38:56] shout is to gather them together. We've
[38:59] had a shout. Can you say amen? A shout
[39:01] is a message and it's the beginnings of
[39:04] our exit out of this earth.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; He said there's going to be a shout.
[39:08] There's going to be a voice. There's
[39:10] going to be a trump. And when that
[39:11] begins to happen, your time, your days
[39:14] are limited there in Babylon. I'm going
[39:16] to deliver you. In other words, in this
[39:18] one sentence, God begins to speak his
[39:21] redemption to his people. In that one
[39:24] sentence, he's bringing redemption and
[39:26] grace. Now, grace after his temporary
[39:30] punishment to the people for them being
[39:33] rebellious and them being making
[39:35] mistakes and all of the fruits that they
[39:38] were reaping because of their mistakes,
[39:40] then God has redemption. And if you read
[39:43] through your Bible, every time there's a
[39:45] a judgment that takes place, he's always
[39:47] giving a little measure of grace for
[39:49] those who want to come. Even when he
[39:51] said at Noah's day, I'll destroy this
[39:53] whole earth. I'll destroy man whom I've
[39:56] created. I'll just throw it in the
[39:58] trash. I'll start all over. Even with
[40:00] that, Noah found grace in the eyes of
[40:03] the Lord. You will always find the
[40:05] threat of redemption
[40:07] in every one of God's judgments.
[40:10] Something for people to say, "He's
[40:12] speaking to me. He's calling me to grace
[40:17] when it doesn't look like there's no
[40:18] grace." And then this this expression he
[40:22] says this 70 years and then the
[40:24] messenger or the message or the letter
[40:27] says these words I know the thoughts
[40:29] that I have towards you.
[40:32] They get a window into what God really
[40:36] thinks about them. Now listen friends,
[40:39] there's nothing greater than when God
[40:41] reveals what he's thinking about you.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:45] And God has to do it because there are
[40:48] so many different ideas and so many
[40:50] things that we think of ourselves and
[40:52] there's so much guilt that goes with our
[40:54] mistakes that we start to think in our
[40:57] mind and we're wondering what God thinks
[41:00] about us.
[41:02] And so now God says, "I know the
[41:05] thoughts that I have towards you." And
[41:07] guess what? They at that time did not
[41:09] know the the real thoughts that God had
[41:12] towards them.
[41:14] But he said, 'I know the thoughts that I
[41:16] have towards you. And the people get
[41:18] start to get a little window into go
[41:20] what God really thinks of them. And in
[41:22] this it's he says,"I know all the
[41:25] thoughts I have, thoughts of peace and
[41:27] not of evil. And that I would give you
[41:29] an expected end." And so in these
[41:31] thoughts, they begin to go a window into
[41:33] what God really thinks of them. And it's
[41:36] not his anger. It's not his rebuke. It's
[41:39] not his temporary judgment. It's his
[41:41] real thoughts, eternal thoughts about
[41:45] his elect. And his eternal thoughts are
[41:48] greater than temporary judgments that he
[41:51] brings. His eternal thoughts, they are
[41:53] eternal. And if they're eternal, they
[41:56] never did begin. They never will end. He
[41:59] will always think that way about his
[42:01] elect.
[42:04] It will never change.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; His thoughts are greater. There's m, you
[42:10] know, there's nothing more than we
[42:11] desire to hear what God thinks of us.
[42:14] How many would raise your hand and say,
[42:15] "I want to know what God thinks of me."
[42:18] And his thoughts are greater than the
[42:21] temporary state that we're in. How many
[42:23] believe that his thoughts are greater
[42:25] than the temporary state that we're in?
[42:27] And at the end of all this, at the end
[42:30] of all this, it's it's not what you
[42:32] think that God thinks about you. It's
[42:34] not what others think about you.
[42:38] It's not what you think God thinks about
[42:40] you. It's not what others think. And
[42:42] it's not even about what your thoughts
[42:45] are about yourself.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; I think I need to say that again.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; We're we're dealing at a deeper level
[42:53] here. At the end of all this, it's not
[42:56] about what you think God thinks cuz we
[42:58] can put thoughts in God's mind
[43:01] &gt;&gt; and we can try to figure out what is God
[43:03] thinking about me. Is this I did this
[43:05] and and we we we always jump towards to
[43:07] trying to figure it all out. But we
[43:10] don't need to figure out God's thoughts.
[43:12] He can reveal them to us on his own. And
[43:15] many times it's very surprising. But at
[43:17] the end of the day, at the end of all
[43:18] this, it's not what you think God
[43:20] thinks. It's not what you think about
[43:22] yourself. It's not what others think
[43:24] about you. It's not what conclusions
[43:27] that you have made about yourself, the
[43:29] church, the message. It's not about
[43:32] that. It's about what God's thoughts
[43:34] are.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you. Somebody
[43:39] said, "Preach." And I'm going to do that
[43:40] today.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; If I can get enough sycams, I'm going to
[43:44] preach.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; His thoughts are greater than the
[43:48] temporary. It's, you know, it's not what
[43:51] you think of yourself. It's not what
[43:53] others think of you. And it's certainly
[43:55] not what the devil thinks of you.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; He's like the last on the list. His
[44:00] thoughts are not even considered. And
[44:03] yet, how many times do we allow him to
[44:06] speak to our minds his thoughts about
[44:09] us?
[44:12] &gt;&gt; But his thoughts shouldn't even be
[44:14] considered.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; They're not even in the equations.
[44:18] So for Israel now,
[44:22] excuse me, before their rebellion,
[44:24] before their mistakes, and it took years
[44:26] to go into idolatry until God said,
[44:28] "Okay, that's enough. You're going to go
[44:29] into captivity. Nebel's going to come
[44:32] and take you. You're going to go into
[44:33] captivity." Before that happened, there
[44:35] was mistakes. There was rebellion. But
[44:37] before the rebellion, before the
[44:39] mistakes, before the bondage in Babylon,
[44:43] before a life uh uh before a life that
[44:46] was no longer perfect, but it was
[44:48] unrighteous and not perfect. Before
[44:50] that, there was God's before all of
[44:53] that, there was God's thoughts of
[44:55] Israel.
[44:57] Before the mistakes is God's thoughts
[45:10] and God's thoughts was greater than all
[45:12] of that.
[45:13] That's what he really thought of them.
[45:16] That thought,
[45:18] that thought of God, the thoughts of God
[45:22] would raise them after 70 years because
[45:25] the thought was greater than their
[45:27] bondage. The thought of God was more
[45:30] powerful than the state that they were
[45:31] in. And that thought eventually kicked
[45:34] in and it begin to raise the people in a
[45:37] resurrection, raise them out of their
[45:38] bondage, raise them out of the situation
[45:41] they're in. And that thought had an
[45:43] expected end to it. So, it would raise
[45:45] them to that. And it's amazing now here
[45:47] it's a 70-year time period. Now you say,
[45:50] you know, brother Steven's true, he's
[45:52] great at the numbers in the scripture
[45:53] and goes through that with us sometimes
[45:55] in the class. But you see now I just
[45:57] thought of that. I looked up. I said,
[45:58] "What's the average lifespan?" Here's
[46:00] the 70 years they were in Babylon. And
[46:02] and globally, we're at about 73 years.
[46:05] The average lifespan of a person
[46:07] globally used to be a lot shorter. Now
[46:10] it's up to 73. That's the average
[46:12] lifespan. So, mom, you are well past
[46:15] that and you are doing fantastic. Let's
[46:17] give her a hand this morning.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:22] It's interesting. It was 70 and that's
[46:24] about how many years we have on this
[46:26] earth.
[46:28] And our years on this earth, it's our
[46:30] life and in that life is our story. And
[46:33] guess what? Every one of your stories is
[46:34] different.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; And the interesting thing about it,
[46:38] every story is different. Every
[46:40] background is different. And the whole
[46:42] redemption story is different. Every one
[46:45] of you have a testimony.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And the the interesting thing about it
[46:50] is many of us do not like our story.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; We're some of us are bitter about our
[46:57] story.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; We don't like it. And also, if we're
[47:01] really weak and don't see the plan of
[47:03] God, we would rather have somebody
[47:05] else's story than ours. We actually are
[47:07] are jealous over somebody else's story.
[47:09] I wish I had their story. I wish I could
[47:11] have had a grown up in a Christian home.
[47:13] I wish I wasn't abused like this. I wish
[47:15] I could have it like this. And we're
[47:16] always comparing oursel to somebody
[47:18] usually that we think would had a little
[47:20] bit more perfect life. But listen now,
[47:22] none of us have had a perfect life.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; All of us have flaws.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't give a strong amen on the
[47:30] second one, but news flash. All of us
[47:33] have flaws. All of us were born in sin,
[47:36] shaped in iniquity, speaking lies. All
[47:39] of us were unacceptable to God when we
[47:41] were born. Even if we were if we were
[47:42] born in a Christian family, we were
[47:44] unacceptable to God. And all the
[47:46] potential that made somebody go murder
[47:49] somebody and go on drugs and commit
[47:51] adultery. All the potential to do that.
[47:53] You may not have done that, but all the
[47:55] potential is in you to do all of that.
[47:57] So which is worse, the person who does
[47:59] it or the person who has all the
[48:01] potential to do it. That's why this
[48:03] politics and whoever says that they are
[48:05] going to be the the greatest president
[48:06] to fix all these things. My friend, you
[48:09] can't fix any of this violence until you
[48:12] change the heart of a man. Can you say
[48:14] amen? Unless you deal with a soul and a
[48:17] chained nature, you'll never stop all of
[48:19] this. Although I appreciate the extra
[48:22] work that's being done to bring a little
[48:23] bit more law and order and make people
[48:25] responsible. I appreciate that. But for
[48:27] someone to boast and say, you know,
[48:29] after 2 or 3 thousand years, we're going
[48:31] to bring peace in the Middle East and
[48:32] we're going to be the ones that do does
[48:34] it and we're going to settle this.
[48:35] That's that's arrogance.
[48:39] I like the the old song by the Imperials
[48:41] said, "There will never ever be peace
[48:44] until God is seated at the conference
[48:46] table."
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a peace coming, but it won't
[48:50] be through Trump.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Won't be through the Democrats. Won't be
[48:55] through the Republicans. I'm the one guy
[48:58] that actually got to step in. Trump
[49:00] thinks he's the one, but it's in
[49:01] scripture. It's the Antichrist that's
[49:04] going to come to try to solve all the
[49:06] problems. And it's going to look so good
[49:08] that everybody's going to go after it.
[49:11] This is so good. Here's our man. We
[49:13] thought it was Trump, but no. The Bible
[49:15] says it's the Antichrist.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And it will embody a man
[49:20] &gt;&gt; that's going to have the answer to fix
[49:23] everything.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; But you can't fix things properly
[49:28] until you fix the problem in the soul.
[49:31] And all of you were born with the same
[49:33] potentials to do all those things wrong.
[49:35] That's why if you can say amen to what
[49:38] Jesus said, you must be born again. I
[49:41] said you must be born again. Young
[49:42] person, you must be born again. Don't
[49:45] try to smear on the outside without
[49:47] saying, God, I need a new birth. I need
[49:49] a change in my life.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; And so, you know,
[49:57] when we look at our story and we would
[49:59] like to trade our story with someone
[50:01] else and and and through all of it,
[50:03] through all of it, we think about
[50:05] things, which is which is where we're
[50:07] off track, we try to fix things and we
[50:11] get bitter about our story. And uh if we
[50:15] love God and have an honor for God, then
[50:17] we also we wonder what God is really
[50:20] thinking of us because of our flaws and
[50:22] because of our mistakes, because of our
[50:25] weaknesses. We we try to fix things. We
[50:28] try to think it through. We get bitter
[50:30] sometimes about it. People finish their
[50:32] lives. Just bitter people because
[50:34] they're they're they're thinking through
[50:36] why did I do this? Why did I why did my
[50:38] life turn out this way? Why did this
[50:40] person do this to me? They've destroyed
[50:41] my life. They've ruined my life. I've
[50:44] ruined my life. Other people have ruined
[50:46] my life. And even some say, "God, God
[50:48] has ruined my life cuz God didn't step
[50:51] in."
[50:53] &gt;&gt; It gets pretty bad. Bitterness gets
[50:55] pretty bad when you start turning your
[50:57] blame towards God.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And so then we say, "I wonder what God,
[51:03] if he allows this, what is he really
[51:05] thinking of us?" And that's a good
[51:06] question. And not a lot of people ask
[51:08] that, but I think people who have a
[51:09] concern, they want to know what God is
[51:11] thinking. They want to know his
[51:13] thoughts. I think that's a good thing.
[51:15] And he knows the thoughts that he has
[51:17] toward you. They were already
[51:19] established before the foundation of the
[51:21] world. And they have not changed. If God
[51:24] has you in his thoughts or were you were
[51:26] a thought of God, that thought cannot
[51:28] change because I'm going to read it in a
[51:30] minute. It's his eternal thoughts of us.
[51:33] And something that's eternal doesn't
[51:35] have a beginning or doesn't have an
[51:37] ending.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; That's pretty good.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Something that's eternal does not have a
[51:43] beginning, does not have an ending. And
[51:45] and so whatever happens here in your
[51:48] story has to work around the thoughts of
[51:52] God and eventually become subject to
[51:55] what God thought of you.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say praise the Lord? Amen.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever your story is, it eventually
[52:01] has to end up a redemption and it has to
[52:04] be subject to what God thought of you.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful scripture in Psalms 139
[52:11] verse 17 and 18. How precious are thy
[52:16] thoughts unto me, oh God. Psalms 139:17.
[52:20] How precious also are thy thoughts unto
[52:22] me, oh God. How great is the sum of
[52:25] them. If I should count them, they are
[52:28] more in number than the sand. When I
[52:30] awake, I am still with thee. How
[52:33] precious are his thoughts towards me. Is
[52:36] that an encouragement to you this
[52:38] morning?
[52:39] I have thoughts toward you. I know what
[52:42] I'm thinking about you. I have thoughts
[52:44] of good and not evil. I have thoughts of
[52:46] not just good, but they're thoughts of
[52:48] peace. They're they're thoughts that
[52:50] will bring you to an expected end. and
[52:52] everything that happens is going to work
[52:55] around that thought of God. Uh uh so so
[53:00] now going back to Israel in in Babylon
[53:03] hearing this it must have been
[53:04] encouraging to hear this part that they
[53:07] heard that the the prophet like he did
[53:09] in this hour when he began to say in
[53:12] this hour we were in his thoughts before
[53:14] the foundation of the world. The only
[53:17] difference today in Jeremiah 29 is not
[53:19] just what God knows his thoughts he
[53:21] thinks towards us. But but at the end
[53:24] time we begin to know the thoughts he
[53:26] thinks towards us.
[53:30] I'm going to tell you what the thoughts
[53:32] are. In other words, God's saying at the
[53:34] end time, I'm going to I'm going to I'm
[53:36] not just going to say I know the
[53:37] thoughts that I have toward you like he
[53:38] said through Jeremiah, but I'm going to
[53:40] begin telling you the thoughts that I
[53:42] have. And now now there's so many things
[53:44] and I don't want to spend a lot of time
[53:46] on this but but he starts to break open
[53:48] that revelation in the last couple years
[53:50] of the ministry of the prophet. You are
[53:53] the elected seed.
[53:56] That means when he says see that means
[53:58] you're the you're God's offspring.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You're God's family.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; So you're not just someone else but
[54:07] you're God's family. And if you're in
[54:09] his thought, that seed thought, then you
[54:11] are seed of God when you're born into
[54:13] this earth. Then there then that thought
[54:16] can be changed. That's what he thought
[54:17] of you. That's what he thinks of his
[54:19] elect. And that you are a seed as
[54:21] offspring. And notice, listen, he didn't
[54:23] think of us. His thoughts were of us. In
[54:27] other words, it does it's not like we
[54:29] okay, I had a thought and and and God
[54:32] thought a thought of Stevie and God
[54:34] thought a thought of Bren and I. I
[54:36] thought of them. So I now I'm going to
[54:38] predestinate them to come and I I I I
[54:41] did. No, no, no. It's that's not how
[54:42] God's thoughts work. He didn't think of
[54:44] us because that would be a beginning.
[54:48] His thoughts are of us.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; See, we always look at these things and
[55:00] put our mind with God's mind. But see,
[55:02] if he called us, he says, I'm going to
[55:04] read it in a minute. We are the eternal
[55:05] thoughts of God. You're an attribute of
[55:08] God that was in his mind before the
[55:10] foundation of the world, before the
[55:12] beginning. Matter of fact, there was no
[55:13] bidding to beginning to that. He didn't
[55:15] think of us. His thoughts were of us.
[55:17] Listen. And then because his thoughts
[55:20] are us, his whole plan, the whole plan
[55:23] of God, all creation, all things he
[55:26] created had a source of inspiration. The
[55:29] earth, the moon, the stars, this earth,
[55:32] everything, it had an inspiration behind
[55:34] it. And guess who that inspiration was?
[55:37] It was you, my brother and sister.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Everything that he did revolved around
[55:43] his thoughts of you.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; This earth was created for his sons and
[55:49] daughters.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody else owns it now, but we're
[55:53] going to get it back.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's what redemption. Praise the Lord.
[55:58] And all these uh, you know, Russia,
[56:00] everybody's fighting over land. Just let
[56:02] them go ahead and fight. It belongs to
[56:04] me. It belongs to you. Let them fight
[56:07] over it all they want to. There's coming
[56:09] a day that God will remove all the evil
[56:12] spirits from this earth. All the
[56:14] dictators, all the arrogant ones, and
[56:16] then he's going to say, "I didn't give
[56:18] this to you. I gave it to my bride and
[56:21] now I'm handing it back. This earth will
[56:23] belong to his bride in a millennium."
[56:28] Everything that was created, everything
[56:30] that w that he was doing his was
[56:33] revolved around his thoughts of us. His
[56:36] even his pressing through to go to
[56:40] Calvary, what was inspiring him? What
[56:43] was driving him? What made him lay down
[56:46] even his sunship? Brother Bram said he
[56:49] laid his sunship down to go to the
[56:52] cross. But what was his inspiration? The
[56:55] Bible said he for the joy that was set
[56:59] before him endured the cross. Who was
[57:02] that joy? It was you, my brother and
[57:04] sister.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Everything that God was doing in his
[57:10] word was to have the end result, the
[57:13] expected end to bring his thoughts into
[57:17] manifestation. And you are those
[57:20] thoughts.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:23] So, you can imagine why I could say, "I
[57:25] don't care what you think of yourself. I
[57:27] don't care what the devil told you this
[57:29] week. He thinks about you. I don't care
[57:31] what your life has been. Every one of us
[57:33] have a story, but I'm telling you, if
[57:36] you're in the thought of God, it trumps
[57:38] everything.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; I hate to use the word trump. It just
[57:43] But God's thoughts
[57:47] will trump everything." Thank you.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; So, you know, a lot of you have might be
[57:53] saying, "I've heard this preached
[57:54] before. I've heard this preached for
[57:55] years." Well, it's time to start living
[57:58] in a way.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; It's time to stop saying, "Well, I'm in
[58:01] the message. I've heard that." It's time
[58:03] to start saying, "Lord, give me a real
[58:05] deeper revelation when I walk every day
[58:08] that I'm not just another human being.
[58:11] By flesh, I am. I've got a sticky flesh.
[58:13] But by by representation, by what's
[58:16] inside me, I was in his thoughts before
[58:19] the world was formed.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; No wonder I love the word. No wonder I'm
[58:24] here saying amen to the word. No matter,
[58:25] brother. No wonder, brother Paul, this
[58:27] bigger preacher is there saying things,
[58:29] but I'm not registering with brother
[58:30] Paul. I'm registering what what he's
[58:32] saying. There's something in me saying
[58:34] that's me.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; That's my husband speaking to me.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; No wonder. It's because something on the
[58:41] inside is registering and connecting.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; It's that attribute of God.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; It's that attribute of God. It's that
[58:51] thought of God that he deposited.
[58:54] He for the joy set before him. How many
[58:57] can say praise the Lord. He endured the
[58:59] cross and his motivation was you. his
[59:02] offspring, his family, his relationship,
[59:06] relationship back with his children was
[59:08] greater than anything that was going on
[59:11] in earth.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; They were eternal thoughts. So they had
[59:16] no beginning. They always were in his
[59:17] mind. It's not, well, I thank God he
[59:20] eventually thought of me that night at
[59:22] the altar.
[59:24] I thank God that he thought of me and he
[59:26] brought me in. It's much deeper than
[59:28] that. It's not, well, I thank God he
[59:30] eventually thought of me. I feel
[59:32] special. No, this revelation is deeper.
[59:35] I thank God. I'm an eternal thought of
[59:37] God and I heard the call of my father.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Here's just one of the many places he
[59:44] begins to break this now. Then in the
[59:47] church age book, now then here we are
[59:48] coming to a conclusion. As the eternal
[59:50] logos, God was manifested in the son and
[59:53] in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[59:54] godhead bodily and that eternal one was
[59:57] the father manifest in flesh and thereby
[59:59] gain the title of son. Even so we
[1:00:02] eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:00:04] became the many membered spoken word
[1:00:07] seed manifest in flesh and those eternal
[1:00:10] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[1:00:12] sons of God even as we are so-called. We
[1:00:16] did not become seed by the rebirth.
[1:00:21] We were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:00:25] for only the elect can be reborn.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:00:32] We didn't become the father's children
[1:00:35] at the new birth. We just recognized who
[1:00:38] we are at the new birth. We were always
[1:00:40] his seed. We were always his offspring.
[1:00:45] You're not going to hear that in most
[1:00:46] churches this Sunday morning. And I
[1:00:48] don't belittle them. I say, "Thank God
[1:00:50] for me hearing from my father to tell me
[1:00:53] his thoughts towards me." And his
[1:00:55] thoughts is, "You didn't get saved at
[1:00:57] the night at the altar." That's when you
[1:00:59] identified. That's only when you
[1:01:00] recognize I'm a son of God. There's
[1:01:03] something in me saying amen to the word
[1:01:04] of God.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; We didn't become seed by the rebirth. We
[1:01:09] were seed. And therefore, we're reborn.
[1:01:11] For only the elect can be reborn because
[1:01:13] we were see because we were seed is the
[1:01:16] reason we could be quickened. In non
[1:01:18] seed there's nothing to quicken. Hold
[1:01:20] this carefully in your mind. Now take
[1:01:22] the next step. Redeem means to bring
[1:01:25] back. It restores to the original owner.
[1:01:27] God. So many churches sing about
[1:01:29] redemption. They don't even know what it
[1:01:30] means. Redeem means to bring something
[1:01:32] back that already was there.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Redeem doesn't say take some new product
[1:01:37] or some new thing and that's not
[1:01:38] redemption. That's buying something new.
[1:01:40] redeemers that you always were. You went
[1:01:43] into the pawn shop and God come and paid
[1:01:45] the price and got you out of the pawn
[1:01:46] shop. He had you in the beginning.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." You
[1:01:51] were already his in the beginning. You
[1:01:54] fell and God came and redeemed you back.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You always were. My He said he spoke he
[1:02:03] brought back the spoken word. Oh, I got
[1:02:05] I'm passing here. Redeem means to bring
[1:02:06] back. It restores the original owner.
[1:02:08] God by his death, the shed blood brought
[1:02:11] back his own. He brought back the the uh
[1:02:14] spoken word seed bride. My sheep hear my
[1:02:17] voice and they follow me. You always
[1:02:19] were a sheep. You never were a pig or a
[1:02:21] dog turned into a sheep.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; That is impossible for every kind of
[1:02:28] life produces the same kind and there's
[1:02:31] no change in the species as you know
[1:02:34] they try to mix those. There's they've
[1:02:35] never been able to mix those. You can't
[1:02:36] change the species. If you were that
[1:02:38] species to start with, you're always
[1:02:40] that species.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; As we were in the thoughts of God and
[1:02:44] then expressed in flesh, there had to
[1:02:46] come a day when we would hear his voice,
[1:02:49] the word, and hearing that voice, become
[1:02:52] aware of our father calling us, and
[1:02:55] recognize that we are the sons of God.
[1:02:58] We heard his voice, and we cried out as
[1:03:01] did the prodal son, save me, oh my
[1:03:04] father. I am returning to thee
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; you know what's behind the revelation of
[1:03:15] the prodical son not just one of your
[1:03:17] sons or daughters just has went astray.
[1:03:19] It's predestination.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz they forget to preach it that he was
[1:03:24] already in the father's house.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I said he was already in the father's
[1:03:30] mind. He was in the father's house. He
[1:03:33] was a son. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And he strayed away.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Blew up every bit of inheritance he had
[1:03:42] and he was in the pig pin and he just
[1:03:44] said, "What in the world am I doing?"
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you raise your hand to all
[1:03:49] these people? Maybe they're discouraged
[1:03:50] cuz they're in the pig pin now. How many
[1:03:52] raise your hands? I was in the pig pin.
[1:03:54] I was the prodal and I was starting to
[1:03:56] think this isn't me.
[1:04:00] I'm trying to act like all these smokers
[1:04:02] and drinkers and and and and and living
[1:04:04] in adultery and fornication and I'm
[1:04:06] trying to act like them for 20 years of
[1:04:08] my life. I have wasted my life. But
[1:04:10] there's something in me calling out is
[1:04:12] saying this is not me. How many raise
[1:04:14] your hand? That's what you felt.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; And the very reason you're starting to
[1:04:18] feel that is because you were something
[1:04:20] else from the beginning and you're
[1:04:22] hearing a call back to be who you really
[1:04:24] are.
[1:04:31] That's the gospel.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; That's the good news.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's a That's a the revelation of the
[1:04:39] new birth on steroids.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Not going to hear the new birth like
[1:04:46] that too much in many churches, but it's
[1:04:49] in the Bible. Read Ephesians 1. I
[1:04:53] predestinated you to be conformed. I
[1:04:55] predestin you to be sons and he could
[1:04:58] predestinate us because we were in the
[1:05:00] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:05:01] world.
[1:05:05] So through these quotes and I've got a
[1:05:08] hundred of them I can read besides this
[1:05:09] but through these quotes at the end time
[1:05:12] we can begin saying
[1:05:15] I know the thoughts he has about me.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; The ones in Babylon couldn't say that.
[1:05:22] They didn't know the thoughts, but they
[1:05:23] could hear God say, which felt very
[1:05:24] good. I know the thoughts that I have
[1:05:26] for you. You have an expected in, I'm
[1:05:29] bringing you out because my thought says
[1:05:32] you've got to come out.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But today, through these quotes and
[1:05:38] through the word being open to us at the
[1:05:40] end time, we can say, "I know the
[1:05:42] thoughts that he has towards me." You
[1:05:44] can leave this morning the service
[1:05:46] saying, "I know a little bit more of
[1:05:48] what God thinks of me."
[1:05:51] That's that's powerful, friends.
[1:05:55] If it's a revelation, you're going to
[1:05:56] walk different.
[1:05:58] You're going to talk different.
[1:06:01] You're going to be like that slave that
[1:06:04] was acting so
[1:06:08] confident as he's in chains
[1:06:12] and he's standing tall and he's but he's
[1:06:15] in chains, but he knows who his father
[1:06:17] is back in Africa.
[1:06:20] and he's conducting himself
[1:06:23] like he's the king's son from a tribe
[1:06:25] that's the king and he's in the lineage
[1:06:27] and the offspring of the king and he's
[1:06:29] in chains and he's acting like a son of
[1:06:34] a king
[1:06:39] now soon as we look at this
[1:06:42] if we look at it carnally we we start to
[1:06:45] inject our own thoughts into it I don't
[1:06:47] know maybe you have this morning and
[1:06:49] That's why I'm going to preach a little
[1:06:50] bit is that it's our thoughts that
[1:06:52] interrupt these thoughts of God to us.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; It's our stinking thinking.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; It's when we we begin to try to figure
[1:07:00] it out.
[1:07:02] And as soon as we start to hear these,
[1:07:05] we start to inject our own thoughts and
[1:07:07] we're trying to think it through. Now,
[1:07:09] how how does this work and how do and an
[1:07:11] analytical person, maybe an engineer
[1:07:13] type mind, they they've got to know how
[1:07:15] it works. And and they and so a real
[1:07:17] highly educated mind will have a harder
[1:07:20] time
[1:07:23] receiving the thought that God really
[1:07:27] didn't ask us to figure out his
[1:07:29] thoughts.
[1:07:36] God really didn't ask us to figure it
[1:07:39] all out. He asked us to believe it.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And any more understanding that would
[1:07:45] come, he would like to bring through
[1:07:46] revelation to our hearts that we know it
[1:07:50] by revelation and not by that we figured
[1:07:53] it all out.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:55] Because I probably could safely say,
[1:07:57] you're not going to figure out all the
[1:07:59] thoughts of God
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; because he always end up acting
[1:08:04] different than the way we thought he
[1:08:06] should act.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:13] I'm I'm trying to keep this encouraging.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I promise my kids today is going to be
[1:08:18] an encouraging message.
[1:08:21] But I have to think about our own minds
[1:08:23] a little bit interrupting
[1:08:27] and start to think, well, if I'm a if
[1:08:30] I'm a thought of God,
[1:08:32] then why didn't God just skip all of
[1:08:36] this
[1:08:37] and just bring me the way that I was
[1:08:40] originally and we can all be one big
[1:08:44] happy family on earth as Adam and Eve
[1:08:47] was? And once again, you're trying to
[1:08:50] think it through. Why couldn't I skip my
[1:08:52] story? Why couldn't we skip this earth?
[1:08:55] Why couldn't we skip all of this
[1:08:57] perversion around us? And why couldn't I
[1:09:00] be placed right as a thought of God on
[1:09:03] this earth the way? Well, you know, it
[1:09:05] was headed in that direction, but
[1:09:06] something interrupted it.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Sin, unbelief.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says that Adam and Eve
[1:09:15] would have spoke their children into
[1:09:17] existence as God did.
[1:09:20] would be no labor pains,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Sisters can say, "Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:09:26] That would have been nice."
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; There would be no nine months and of not
[1:09:31] getting sleep cuz you're in pain. And
[1:09:33] then you have the baby, you think you're
[1:09:34] going to get sleep after that.
[1:09:37] And then you don't get sleep for about
[1:09:39] 10 years.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; It's not quite that long, but seems like
[1:09:43] it.
[1:09:45] No menopause.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; No menopause.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Why couldn't you know why couldn't it
[1:09:57] happen that way? And then now now we
[1:09:59] expand into a whole another thing that's
[1:10:02] difficult for us to understand about God
[1:10:05] allowing.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:09] Because
[1:10:11] God allowed
[1:10:13] a fallen realm
[1:10:17] and a place to be made that he might
[1:10:21] manifest his thoughts because you can't
[1:10:23] stay a thought. Of course, you have to
[1:10:25] be manifested.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; It's how we were manifested and the way
[1:10:29] we were manifested that is what we don't
[1:10:32] understand. Sometimes we would have
[1:10:35] chosen more perfection. we would have
[1:10:36] chosen this keeping at perfection. We
[1:10:39] You know what? I got to preach another
[1:10:41] sermon because we're we're too bent on
[1:10:45] looking for perfection.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; We look for it on this earth. We look
[1:10:53] for it in other people. We expect it out
[1:10:56] of our children.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Usually, we expect it out everybody else
[1:11:00] except ourselves. But there are a lot of
[1:11:02] people that expect it out of themselves
[1:11:04] and they wear themselves out and they're
[1:11:06] looking for this unrealistic
[1:11:08] perfection in these bodies and in this
[1:11:11] life.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it takes people years to
[1:11:15] settle into the fact we're in a broken
[1:11:17] world. We're in a torn world. We're in
[1:11:19] an evil world. We're in a vile world.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And because of that, things will not
[1:11:24] always go to a state of perfection. We
[1:11:28] are not to have that unrealistic thing
[1:11:30] of us coming. There's some people even
[1:11:32] preach it this way. They preach the
[1:11:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost as as some
[1:11:36] type of perfection that you hit one
[1:11:38] night at an altar and all of a sudden
[1:11:39] now you're like an angel floating around
[1:11:42] and you don't have any problems anymore.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; That's not Bible teaching.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; The difference when you receive a new
[1:11:49] birth, the Holy Ghost, the difference is
[1:11:50] is you receive for the first time the
[1:11:53] power of the to overcome. Brother Bram
[1:11:55] was asked a question. I might have
[1:11:56] mentioned this Wednesday night. Brother
[1:11:57] Brandham was asked, "Can a person who
[1:11:59] has the Holy Ghost be tempted to do some
[1:12:02] things sometimes
[1:12:04] uh even though he has the Holy Ghost?"
[1:12:06] And brother Bam says, "Oh yes." He said,
[1:12:07] "That's when that's when the battle
[1:12:09] begins."
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; The devil just left you alone. Now you
[1:12:13] got the Holy Ghost. Now you're his
[1:12:14] target
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; and you're going to be tempted and
[1:12:17] you're going to fall to some
[1:12:18] temptations.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; But I thought I had I thought I was an
[1:12:23] attribute of God. I thought and God's
[1:12:25] doing something and he's placing an
[1:12:26] attribute because we can't he can't
[1:12:30] squeeze us through heaven and we come on
[1:12:33] the other side and God just did
[1:12:35] everything right for us and then call us
[1:12:37] an overcomer. God's not going to do
[1:12:39] that. We have to be overcomers. So we
[1:12:42] have to overcome something so we get on
[1:12:44] the other side. What did you overcome?
[1:12:46] Well, Leodysa number one. But the
[1:12:48] biggest thing you overcome is this
[1:12:51] sticky sir
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; self.
[1:12:56] your worst enemy.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; People are too much. Let's leave it for
[1:13:05] another sermon. Looking for perfection.
[1:13:08] And that's why they're in depression and
[1:13:10] disappointed many times their whole life
[1:13:12] is because you keep expecting it's going
[1:13:14] to go this way and this life it goes the
[1:13:16] other way. Sometimes way the other way.
[1:13:19] And God puts his thoughts in a fallen
[1:13:22] realm.
[1:13:24] And in order to manifest them, it cannot
[1:13:27] stay a thought. It has to be manifested.
[1:13:30] And he says, "I'll put that in a body of
[1:13:32] flesh." This is scriptural when Paul
[1:13:34] says, "We have this treasure in earthn
[1:13:36] vessels." God puts a treasure of his
[1:13:39] seed in an earthn vessel.
[1:13:42] I'll put that in a body of flesh that is
[1:13:43] a fallen body. Why? Because in a
[1:13:47] contrast,
[1:13:48] in a contrast, God shines brighter.
[1:13:53] He created darkness
[1:13:56] so that light could be manifested.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; If you didn't have darkness, then you
[1:14:03] wouldn't be able to see the gloriousness
[1:14:05] of the light.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; This is our God. Can you say amen? It's
[1:14:09] the flaw that makes it a masterpiece.
[1:14:14] It's the sticky flesh that we hate so
[1:14:16] much that he chooses to put his thought
[1:14:18] in to allow it to let it rise above that
[1:14:21] and rise even into a rapture. That's the
[1:14:24] redemption. That's the glory of God.
[1:14:26] Now, at this point, I'm just wondering
[1:14:29] how much our thoughts get in the way.
[1:14:31] How much do our thoughts get in the way?
[1:14:33] You know, God doesn't ask us to
[1:14:35] understand everything or think
[1:14:37] everything through. He doesn't need
[1:14:39] man's opinion. He didn't ask for man's
[1:14:42] opinion. And you can slow up the
[1:14:44] thoughts of God working in your life and
[1:14:46] his will by injecting too much of your
[1:14:50] thinking.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; And what's worse about our thinking is
[1:14:53] we draw conclusions.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; And what's worse about drawing what's
[1:14:57] worse about drawing final conclusions is
[1:15:00] we make judgments
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; on things. Final judgments based upon
[1:15:08] our conclusions. And it's all in the
[1:15:10] realm of our thoughts
[1:15:14] and conclusions and judgments on other
[1:15:17] people becomes your belief system. You
[1:15:19] make justice judgments based upon your
[1:15:21] conclusion. There's, you know, friends,
[1:15:23] there's only one mind that was had a
[1:15:26] perfect thought.
[1:15:28] There's only one mind
[1:15:30] that had a perfect thought when he
[1:15:32] thought it or perfect thoughts of God.
[1:15:34] It wasn't your mind.
[1:15:41] There's only one mind
[1:15:44] that was perfect from the beginning.
[1:15:46] News flash, it wasn't yours.
[1:15:52] Our minds are to be corrected all the
[1:15:54] time. Our thinking is to be changed. Our
[1:15:57] thinking is always to be renewed. I
[1:15:58] don't care if care if you're 80 years
[1:16:00] old. Our minds will always need to be
[1:16:02] corrected and renewed and never draw a
[1:16:05] final conclusion about anything unless
[1:16:10] you know it's God's truth.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; And your thoughts either begin to work
[1:16:18] with the thoughts of God or they begin
[1:16:20] to get in the way. In Proverbs 3:5, if
[1:16:22] you guys want to pull that up, Proverbs
[1:16:24] 3:5, are you still with me? Just for a
[1:16:26] few more minutes.
[1:16:28] Proverbs 3:5, the text that brother
[1:16:30] Brandham read and lean not to thine own
[1:16:32] understanding. Trust in the Lord with
[1:16:34] all of thine heart and lean not unto
[1:16:37] thine own understanding. There is a
[1:16:40] trust that we enter into a deep How many
[1:16:43] want to enter a deeper trust in God.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; What moves you from that trust is
[1:16:49] leaning to your thinking too much. Oh,
[1:16:52] please, please, just everybody uh just
[1:16:55] be real still now and just listen to me,
[1:16:58] would you?
[1:17:00] If we say we want to trust the Lord,
[1:17:02] really trust him with all of our heart
[1:17:04] further,
[1:17:06] what can move you from that trust is
[1:17:09] leaning too much to your own thinking.
[1:17:16] And brother Brandham opens that message
[1:17:18] by saying, now I think that's the most
[1:17:19] beautiful scripture. I want to take it
[1:17:21] for a text. The fifth verse, lean not to
[1:17:23] thine own understanding. Now, this is a
[1:17:25] very strange text for the day that we're
[1:17:27] living in. Because the emphasis today is
[1:17:29] certainly laid upon education and upon
[1:17:32] our own understanding of things, the day
[1:17:35] of learning. Today, we send our children
[1:17:37] to the school to have understanding.
[1:17:39] Then after they are through the grammar
[1:17:40] schools, we send them to high school for
[1:17:42] a better understanding of knowledge.
[1:17:43] Then after that, they go through there.
[1:17:45] Some children are even fortunate enough
[1:17:46] to go to college and go through college
[1:17:48] to complete their education and their
[1:17:50] understanding of knowledge what they are
[1:17:52] requ acquired. Many times to get a job
[1:17:55] you have to have at least a high school
[1:17:57] understanding or college education and
[1:17:59] so forth. Yet the wise Solomon told us
[1:18:02] that not to lean to it, not to not to
[1:18:04] our own understanding. Learn not of
[1:18:06] these things because we wonder why that
[1:18:09] he would say such a thing as this. For
[1:18:11] it's because that usually our modern
[1:18:14] understanding is usually the wisdom of
[1:18:17] man which is contrary to the word of
[1:18:20] God. So he says this is a strange
[1:18:23] scripture. Don't lean to your own
[1:18:25] understanding. Don't lean to your own
[1:18:26] thinking. Even if you are an educated
[1:18:28] person, be careful of depending on that
[1:18:31] because there's one thing that always
[1:18:33] happens and that is that wisdom of man
[1:18:37] always comes in conflict conflict with
[1:18:39] the wisdom of God. Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I I he said always. He said always. So I
[1:18:46] would trust in that to realize that we
[1:18:48] have to always be on guard because we
[1:18:51] wonder why that he would say this for
[1:18:52] it's because that usually usually our
[1:18:55] modern understanding is usually the
[1:18:56] wisdom of man which is contrary to the
[1:18:58] word of God. I think that's what the
[1:19:00] Solomon that that's what Solomon was
[1:19:03] trying to advise his sons was not to be
[1:19:05] illiterate
[1:19:06] but not to lean to their own
[1:19:08] understanding.
[1:19:10] Education, science,
[1:19:13] the internet, the information highway
[1:19:16] has taught us to be more thinkers.
[1:19:22] In some ways, it's made us numb to
[1:19:23] thinking as I was talking about
[1:19:25] Wednesday night. In other ways, it
[1:19:28] teaches us to be teaches to go get
[1:19:30] information. Go get go get thoughts on
[1:19:32] this. Go get it. And and we have to be
[1:19:34] careful because the scripture says lean
[1:19:37] not to your own understanding. And this
[1:19:40] is the message brother says God doesn't
[1:19:42] ask us to understand his word. There's a
[1:19:44] there's a guy just thought of that years
[1:19:46] ago challenged me 20ome years ago and he
[1:19:49] got real mad when I said that. God
[1:19:52] doesn't us ask us to understand his
[1:19:53] word. He asks us to believe it. And he
[1:19:55] thought I said it. And I said well I
[1:19:57] went back. This is what brother Bram
[1:19:58] said. You know this is a prophet. And
[1:20:00] whether you understand that or not, I
[1:20:02] mean it's this is what he said. He
[1:20:04] doesn't ask and he always tried to teach
[1:20:06] his kids now. Kids be open thinkers, be
[1:20:10] open-minded now. Don't swallow anything.
[1:20:12] And there's a certain truth to that. But
[1:20:15] how did they use discernment? They use
[1:20:16] discernment through the word of God.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; But just to teach your kids, always have
[1:20:21] an open mind. Usually comes from someone
[1:20:24] who feels like they had everything
[1:20:25] crammed down their minds when they were
[1:20:27] young. So, I'm going to have kids and
[1:20:28] they're going to have an open mind. Very
[1:20:30] dangerous in this age to teach your kids
[1:20:32] just keep your mind open to anything
[1:20:34] because what you don't realize, it's not
[1:20:36] just opening their mind to thoughts.
[1:20:37] It's opening your mind to the spirits
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; behind the thoughts.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And that's a lot of trouble because that
[1:20:44] takes an extra measure of fasting and
[1:20:46] prayer and faith to deliver them later
[1:20:49] of that spirit. So, openmind and
[1:20:53] education. He said at the beginning here
[1:20:55] this scripture is good because we have a
[1:20:56] day of emphasis on education
[1:20:59] and uh science
[1:21:02] um emphasis laid upon education our
[1:21:05] partner understanding and school and
[1:21:07] these things. So it's in direct
[1:21:08] conflict. So I just wanted to conclude
[1:21:10] by saying in this this area that the
[1:21:13] scripture tells us not to lean towards
[1:21:15] it whether through education or the
[1:21:17] world access to know access to
[1:21:19] knowledge. We are taught to be thinkers
[1:21:21] and to analyze things to the max and to
[1:21:25] be overthinkers.
[1:21:27] Anybody ever heard of the term an
[1:21:29] overthinker? Overthinking things.
[1:21:33] Overthinking is a pattern of excessive
[1:21:36] repetitive thought about a situation or
[1:21:39] problem that doesn't lead to solutions
[1:21:43] often resulting in anxiety.
[1:21:47] You know, I always love to read the
[1:21:49] psychology
[1:21:51] of anything the devil is using to bring
[1:21:54] anxiety.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I read them here because I like to
[1:21:58] expose the devil. And you can call it
[1:22:00] psychology. Well, it is. It's behavior
[1:22:02] of human beings that are in depression
[1:22:03] and anxiety. And a lot of us have those
[1:22:06] things. But I'm always trying to say,
[1:22:08] well, what's the devil using to do it?
[1:22:09] And here's one thing. Overthinking
[1:22:12] things.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Thinking that you got a mind like God
[1:22:16] and I'm going to figure all this out.
[1:22:18] And I'm thinking things. And I'm
[1:22:20] thinking about what can happen before it
[1:22:22] even happens.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking for a show of hands.
[1:22:29] There's very people that are just so
[1:22:30] laidback and say what you know
[1:22:35] whatever will be will be. The future's
[1:22:38] not mine. You see
[1:22:46] quesas
[1:22:49] whatever. There's very few people that
[1:22:52] watched that movie years ago and I'm
[1:22:55] going to live like that. Quesaser
[1:22:57] whatever. There's very few people like
[1:22:59] that. Very few people left.
[1:23:02] And I'm not even asking you to be that
[1:23:03] way because I know you got to put
[1:23:06] something in your mind and that's the
[1:23:07] word of God.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; But most of us are overinkers. I the
[1:23:13] other day I'm confessing to you because
[1:23:16] I I'm preaching to myself here. You
[1:23:18] know, I was I woke up in the middle of
[1:23:19] the night the other night. I told some
[1:23:21] of my kids this and my wife and I said,
[1:23:22] "You know what I was thinking about? I
[1:23:24] was thinking about some event coming up
[1:23:26] to the church that we're going to have.
[1:23:28] And this one sister has a baby. I'm not
[1:23:30] going to tell who it is, but I was
[1:23:32] worried
[1:23:34] about the event if she could come or not
[1:23:37] because I wondered if she had a
[1:23:38] babysitter or not.
[1:23:45] Now,
[1:23:48] you could say that's a real burden,
[1:23:50] pastor, for every need in the church. Or
[1:23:53] you could say that has nothing to do
[1:23:56] with you and don't you have other things
[1:23:59] to think about.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's about how my family responded to
[1:24:03] me.
[1:24:04] What in the world are you think that's
[1:24:06] not even your responsibility? I know,
[1:24:08] but I was I was worried about it. And I
[1:24:11] was trying to think through how I could
[1:24:12] help her to get a babysitter and I could
[1:24:14] call the next morning and make all the
[1:24:16] plans and it's none of my business.
[1:24:20] This is how bad it gets.
[1:24:23] I like to tell the fellow who said,
[1:24:26] "I spent the first
[1:24:30] 30 years of my life
[1:24:32] worried about what everybody was
[1:24:34] thinking about me.
[1:24:36] And then I spent the next 30 years of my
[1:24:38] life not caring what everybody thought
[1:24:40] about me.
[1:24:42] And then I spent the next 30 realizing
[1:24:44] nobody was really thinking about me
[1:24:49] as much as I thought they were thinking
[1:24:50] about me.
[1:24:52] Overthinking is a pattern of excessive
[1:24:54] repetitive thought about a situation
[1:24:58] or a problem that doesn't lead to
[1:25:00] solutions often resulting in anxiety,
[1:25:02] stress, and a feeling of being mu me
[1:25:05] mentally struck stuck or exhausted. It
[1:25:08] can stem from factors like fear of
[1:25:09] uncertainty, perfectionism, low
[1:25:12] self-esteem, trauma, and mental health
[1:25:15] conditions like anxiety and depression.
[1:25:17] While not a formal dis former excuse me,
[1:25:19] while not a formal disorder, it is a
[1:25:22] common unproductive way of thinking that
[1:25:24] negatively affects well-being and can be
[1:25:27] addressed through strategies such as
[1:25:30] mindfulness. And they give some other,
[1:25:31] you know, things to do here. But then
[1:25:33] what is overthinking? Repetitive thought
[1:25:36] loops. Overthinking involves getting
[1:25:38] caught in an endless loops of thoughts
[1:25:40] about the past or future
[1:25:44] without ever progressing towards a
[1:25:46] solution. Repetitive loops of thought.
[1:25:49] It it also is unproductive anal
[1:25:51] analysis. The core of overthinking is
[1:25:54] that it's unproductive. It provides no
[1:25:56] clarity or resolution.
[1:25:58] It's emotional or factual thinking.
[1:26:00] Thoughts driven by emotion rather than
[1:26:02] facts are a key sign of overthinking.
[1:26:04] And then and analysis par paralysis.
[1:26:07] This is the inability to make a decision
[1:26:10] due to overanalyzing every possible
[1:26:13] income, excuse me, outcome. Uh I talked
[1:26:16] about that Wednesday night when it
[1:26:17] talked about pornography and how it uh
[1:26:19] it paralyzes the other part of other two
[1:26:22] parts of the brain, the thinking part
[1:26:24] and activates the pleasure center so
[1:26:27] much that it becomes addictive and your
[1:26:29] thinking part of your brain is not used
[1:26:31] at all. And this is what they say here
[1:26:32] about overthinking. There's a paralysis
[1:26:34] to it that that you analyze too much.
[1:26:38] And this is the inability to make a
[1:26:40] decision. So you can't make a solid
[1:26:42] decision because you're analyzing
[1:26:44] overanalyzing every possible outcome.
[1:26:54] So somebody's late for dinner. You were
[1:26:57] supposed to meet him in a restaurant and
[1:27:00] you're thinking,
[1:27:02] "Were we supposed to meet at this
[1:27:05] particular time?
[1:27:08] I'm wondering if this is really the
[1:27:09] place we were going to meet up.
[1:27:12] Is it actually this Thursday that we're
[1:27:14] supposed to meet?
[1:27:17] Were we even meeting at at Thursday?
[1:27:22] Do I actually even know this person?
[1:27:26] Do they really exist?
[1:27:29] Do I even exist?
[1:27:36] Or you say something awkward in front of
[1:27:38] somebody
[1:27:40] or in front of a crew and they forget it
[1:27:42] in 5 minutes, but you think of it the
[1:27:44] next 10 years at 3:00 a.m. in the
[1:27:46] morning. There's a there's a slide here
[1:27:49] that shows what we do sometimes.
[1:27:58] Yeah, you can say amen to that. Sure.
[1:28:01] The person who thinks all the time has
[1:28:03] nothing to think about except thoughts.
[1:28:07] And so he loses touch with reality.
[1:28:10] The primary cause of unhappiness is
[1:28:12] never the situation, but your thoughts
[1:28:15] about it.
[1:28:20] The biggest problem with overthinking is
[1:28:21] when we begin to overthink God's
[1:28:24] promises.
[1:28:28] Galatians 2 21 says, "I do not frustrate
[1:28:32] the grace of God. For if righteousness
[1:28:35] come by the law, then Christ is dead in
[1:28:37] vain." Paul says, "Don't frustrate the
[1:28:41] grace of God." Don't frustrate
[1:28:44] everything. But if you're going to fr be
[1:28:45] frustrated and overthinking everything
[1:28:47] else, do not overthink the word of God,
[1:28:51] the promise of God,
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; and the grace of God. I don't understand
[1:28:56] his grace. Neither do I. But we're not
[1:28:59] supposed to understand it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; We're saying, "Lord, if you give it to
[1:29:02] me, I'll take it."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; I think Sarah was overthinking the
[1:29:06] promise when she made Abraham go with
[1:29:08] Hagar.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; She was thinking it through. Maybe it
[1:29:13] was supposed to happen this way. I'm so
[1:29:15] excited about this child coming. And so
[1:29:17] she's for years thinking about Oh, and
[1:29:19] she overthinks it and makes Abraham go
[1:29:21] with Hagar.
[1:29:23] She's interrupting the promise. Boy, did
[1:29:24] she ever interrupt it. Boy, did she ever
[1:29:26] get in the way there, but she's
[1:29:28] overthinking it. I think Gideon was over
[1:29:30] was overthinking when he told the angel,
[1:29:33] "I'm a poor I'm from a poor family. Uh,
[1:29:35] I'm the least of the crew. You don't
[1:29:37] know who I am. You got the wrong guy."
[1:29:40] And the angel kept reading out of the
[1:29:41] book of life. Gideon, thou mighty man of
[1:29:44] valor. The promise don't need you to
[1:29:47] overanalyze it. It needs to be believed.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; The grace of God does not need to be
[1:29:54] frustrated. Can you say amen? Moses was
[1:29:56] saying, "I'm I can't speak. I stutter
[1:29:58] all the time. I'm not eloquent at
[1:30:00] speech." And yet, friends, you look at
[1:30:02] the vision God had for Moses' life, and
[1:30:05] it didn't have to do with the flaw that
[1:30:08] he had about speaking. God was willing
[1:30:10] to raise him as the vocal cords for the
[1:30:12] the prophet for the hour. Look at our
[1:30:15] prophet of this hour. Seventh grade
[1:30:17] education, the last on the list for
[1:30:20] somebody to be picked to speak to this
[1:30:22] entire generation. But God used the
[1:30:25] flaw.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Can you get it? Can I get an amen? God
[1:30:30] took that and he said, "I'll make it the
[1:30:32] profit of this age."
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; God's not afraid of the fall. Can you
[1:30:38] say amen?
[1:30:40] But thank God we had a teenage girl.
[1:30:42] They say about 15, 16 years old, little
[1:30:45] Mary. And guess what? When an angel told
[1:30:47] her, "You're going to conceive and
[1:30:48] fulfill the prophecy. Behold, a virgin
[1:30:50] shall conceive. You'll be conceive
[1:30:53] you'll conceive a child and you'll bring
[1:30:54] forth." The only thing she says, "But I
[1:30:57] haven't known a man." Uh, that's the
[1:30:58] only thing she said. But you do you
[1:31:01] think a 15year-old girl something great
[1:31:04] had to happen in her life and something
[1:31:06] had to trust God so much that she never
[1:31:10] did any overthinking to the angel. She
[1:31:12] never answered back anything that would
[1:31:15] be a doubt. And that's what God needed
[1:31:18] for his greatest promise to bring forth
[1:31:19] his son. He not only needed his promise,
[1:31:22] he needed a vessel to say, "Be it unto
[1:31:25] me according to thy word." Can you raise
[1:31:27] your hands?
[1:31:29] He needs somebody to quit overthinking
[1:31:31] his promise
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; and start trusting his promise
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; and say those words. I don't understand,
[1:31:40] but I'm not even going to question. I be
[1:31:43] it unto me according to thy word.
[1:31:49] I'm closing on this quote.
[1:31:53] I trust that the Lord is
[1:31:57] trust the Lord's given you something
[1:31:59] this morning.
[1:32:02] I thank the Lord for strength to preach
[1:32:03] today. I've been a little weak with a
[1:32:05] cold, the strength to study yesterday
[1:32:07] and I said, "God, just give me the
[1:32:09] strength to bring this." I know you all
[1:32:12] were disappointed you didn't have
[1:32:13] Brother Diggs here today
[1:32:16] or some of you. And uh he came in June,
[1:32:18] I believe it was. And uh I didn't
[1:32:21] reschedule them, but I heard enough back
[1:32:23] that we need to get them in for the
[1:32:25] Sunday after fall fellowship.
[1:32:28] I thank God for the strength though to
[1:32:30] bring this. It's a burden on my heart
[1:32:32] this morning.
[1:32:36] I was on David a few weeks ago on a
[1:32:38] Wednesday night and talking about him
[1:32:40] being confronted by the prophet
[1:32:43] and after his sin, his house would never
[1:32:47] be the same.
[1:32:50] But the word that was over David's life
[1:32:54] never changed
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; when he spoke it. And and guess what?
[1:33:00] David wasn't even there when the mind of
[1:33:03] God spoke through the prophet
[1:33:06] um
[1:33:08] Samuel. It was the prophet Samuel. And
[1:33:12] he's going to take Saul out of his
[1:33:14] position because he's rebelled. He's
[1:33:16] taken out of position. And he says, God
[1:33:19] says, "I'm taking you out." And he says,
[1:33:21] "I'm going to have a king after my own
[1:33:24] heart." David was a man after God's own
[1:33:27] heart.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; And that's the word. David wasn't even
[1:33:30] there for that thought about him,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; But God speaks it. He's already got he's
[1:33:38] got his king. And you know who's you
[1:33:40] know who you know who's thought of is?
[1:33:42] He didn't just think of Daniel. I need
[1:33:44] to search for another. Saul's messed up.
[1:33:46] No. No. He was in eternal thought as the
[1:33:49] king. And so when he said, "I'm going to
[1:33:52] get it. I I I I got a man after my own
[1:33:53] heart," it was in God's eternal thought.
[1:33:56] David was the one in that thought.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You know, David's life,
[1:34:01] there wasn't anything. Even though he
[1:34:04] lost children, he he lo his house fell
[1:34:07] apart. His one of his son raped another
[1:34:10] girl. There was just chaos in his house.
[1:34:13] But I want to tell you the grace of God
[1:34:16] never changed that thought.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; So then he comes that day and he gets
[1:34:28] the oil poured on him. I'm anointing you
[1:34:31] the king of Israel.
[1:34:34] And as I was saying to the men last week
[1:34:35] at the men's meeting, you know, if he'd
[1:34:37] have known all that was going to come
[1:34:39] from that, he probably would have said,
[1:34:40] "No, no, don't put that on me. I'll stay
[1:34:42] away." Oh yeah,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; it sounds like a good job, but if he
[1:34:45] knew all that was going to come with the
[1:34:47] job, he would have ran away.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't tell us all that's going
[1:34:51] to happen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; It's kind of his sense of humor a little
[1:34:55] bit. You don't tell us our story.
[1:34:59] And so many things happen. I didn't
[1:35:01] expect this at all to happen. I didn't I
[1:35:02] didn't know I would go down those paths.
[1:35:04] I didn't know that I'd be overdosed on
[1:35:06] drugs. I didn't know that I'd do this
[1:35:07] and be with all these women. I I hate
[1:35:09] that. I live with that every day.
[1:35:11] people. I live in that that in my mind
[1:35:13] every day. The scar doesn't go away.
[1:35:17] God re God forgives
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; and he heals,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; but the scar can still be there.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And with the scar comes guilt. And
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; God, you know, what do you think of me?
[1:35:28] And all these other things.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't show us what the story
[1:35:33] will be. He just pours the anointing on
[1:35:35] us and it begins the journey. He's not
[1:35:37] even on the throne yet or positioned
[1:35:39] yet, but he gets the Holy Ghost. He gets
[1:35:41] the anointing. He's got the thought of
[1:35:43] God and he heads in that direction and
[1:35:45] he has great victories. He defeats
[1:35:48] Goliath. He's a man of faith. He's a but
[1:35:50] really what God has thought of him is
[1:35:53] not just he's a king or a man of faith
[1:35:54] or all these other things. He's going to
[1:35:57] be a man after my own heart.
[1:36:02] Friends, I pray that somewhere in the
[1:36:04] thought of God, that's what he has of me
[1:36:07] because I don't want to be any position.
[1:36:09] I don't want to be popular. I I just
[1:36:11] want to me be a man after God's own
[1:36:13] heart.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I'm ending on this quote. God's thoughts
[1:36:21] never changed. He was still a king even
[1:36:23] after his sin.
[1:36:25] This old prophet, old bald-headed fella,
[1:36:28] stomped in, old Nathan out of the
[1:36:29] wilderness, sat down and said, 'David,
[1:36:32] how's everything going? He said, 'Fine,
[1:36:34] fine, old prophet of God. Live forever.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah.
[1:36:40] He was just He thought everything was
[1:36:41] fine. He thought he could hide it. But
[1:36:43] you can't hide from God. He knows what
[1:36:45] you're thinking right now. He knows your
[1:36:46] thoughts for he's God. That Holy Spirit
[1:36:48] that's in the building this morning
[1:36:49] knows your thoughts, who you are, where
[1:36:51] you come from, what you've done. For
[1:36:54] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:36:55] today and forever. God had revealed to
[1:36:58] that prophet, he said, "David, there was
[1:36:59] a rich man lived on the side of the
[1:37:01] road. He had a whole lot of sheep. Oh,
[1:37:02] he was very rich. A man lived on the
[1:37:04] side of the road was poor. He had one
[1:37:06] lamb. He treated it like a daughter. He
[1:37:08] fed it out like the same spoon. He eat
[1:37:10] with it. He slept with the lamb.
[1:37:12] Everything just it was just like his own
[1:37:14] sheep. It was just like a daughter to
[1:37:16] him. And one day a visitor come. So
[1:37:17] instead of the rich man taking one of
[1:37:19] his own sheep and making a feast for the
[1:37:20] visitor well instead of that he went
[1:37:22] over and took the poor man's lamb and by
[1:37:24] force took the lamb and slayed it and
[1:37:26] made a feast. Now that was David's
[1:37:29] passions.
[1:37:30] He had 500 wives but when he seen
[1:37:33] Uriah's wife instead of taking one of
[1:37:35] his 500 wives to appease or satisfy his
[1:37:38] passions he went took this other man's
[1:37:41] wife then killed Uriah when he become
[1:37:44] the when she had become the mother.
[1:37:46] David didn't know what he was doing.
[1:37:48] Why? David was ready to pronounce
[1:37:52] judgment.
[1:37:56] And that's the way we are.
[1:38:00] We can always judge the other fella,
[1:38:04] but when it comes to us, oh, that's
[1:38:06] different.
[1:38:08] David said, "The man will pay with his
[1:38:10] life." The man will pay with his life.
[1:38:14] And that old prophet them eyes narrowed
[1:38:16] down and he said, "David,
[1:38:19] surely you'll not die." Because after he
[1:38:22] said, "Thou art the man." He said, "Thou
[1:38:24] art the man." He says, "David, surely
[1:38:26] you'll not die." Listen to this. Look at
[1:38:28] this. Watch grace there. Go to work
[1:38:33] right quick.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because out of his own thinking is
[1:38:40] always hiding his sin. He's ready to
[1:38:43] proclaim something to pronounce his own
[1:38:44] judgment.
[1:38:47] And grace steps in and stops him.
[1:38:52] Why?
[1:38:54] Because the thought of God that's not in
[1:38:57] the thought of God.
[1:39:01] Watch.
[1:39:09] I'm I'm trying to find Watch Grace
[1:39:10] there. Go to work right quick. The
[1:39:12] spirit struck the prophet. Saved David's
[1:39:13] life. Grace, surely you'll not die, but
[1:39:16] the sword will not leave your house till
[1:39:19] it's thoroughly purged your heart. For
[1:39:21] you are that rich man. Oh, it was
[1:39:23] different then, wasn't it? What saved
[1:39:25] David? When his own judgment said, "The
[1:39:28] man will die. He'll pay to the uttermost
[1:39:32] and he'll pay for it with his life. And
[1:39:34] the prophet said, "Surely, grace. Surely
[1:39:38] you'll not die. You'll not die, David.
[1:39:41] Grace has saved you." It was grace to
[1:39:44] David that saved him. Oh my. If it
[1:39:47] hadn't been for grace, where would we
[1:39:50] all be?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Taken from a sermon called Message of
[1:39:57] Grace. You know what he's saying?
[1:39:59] This message of this hour, I don't care
[1:40:02] what people say about it. It's a message
[1:40:05] of grace.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; The rebuke, all that goes with it, but
[1:40:12] it's a message of grace because it's
[1:40:15] revealing the thoughts of God about you
[1:40:18] and the thought of God. Grace and the
[1:40:22] thought of God will always be greater
[1:40:25] than our story.
[1:40:29] My thought of you is to have an expected
[1:40:31] end. My thought of you is peace. And if
[1:40:35] he would have pronounced that, David
[1:40:36] would have been dead. And we can
[1:40:40] pronounce things and conclude on things
[1:40:43] sometimes out of our own thinking. But
[1:40:46] the grace of God steps in.
[1:40:49] How many times has it done it in our
[1:40:51] lives?
[1:40:54] Some of you are here today and you can
[1:40:57] say, "I'm only here
[1:41:00] because grace stepped in."
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; How many raise your hand? I'm only
[1:41:04] sitting here. I may not all be all I
[1:41:08] need to be, but I wouldn't even be
[1:41:10] sitting in this church, but I'm sitting
[1:41:12] here because grace stepped in.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Grace said, "That's enough."
[1:41:20] See, it's not just saying this grace he
[1:41:22] saved me. It's the grace throughout our
[1:41:24] lives that when we're ready like Abraham
[1:41:28] overthinking the situation and saying if
[1:41:31] I take my wife down there and I go down
[1:41:34] to that city, she's so pretty the king
[1:41:38] is going to fall in love with her. And
[1:41:39] he's thinking it all through. My wife is
[1:41:42] so pretty. The king's going to fall in
[1:41:43] love her, but he can't marry her because
[1:41:46] she's the one the promise of God is
[1:41:47] going to come through. So, I've got to
[1:41:49] protect this and I've got to think this
[1:41:51] through. So, he goes down and he says,
[1:41:55] "Sarah, tell tell the king that you're
[1:41:58] my sister,
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; not my wife." This is overthinking on
[1:42:02] steroids.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:42:07] And so now God's watching all of it and
[1:42:09] you've got a son of God just moving in
[1:42:11] certain decisions and directions and
[1:42:14] he's just headed in a certain direction.
[1:42:15] But I can tell you when it starts to
[1:42:18] head to interrupting the promise, God's
[1:42:21] grace will step in.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Now that ought ought to give us a
[1:42:28] license to sin. No,
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; it ought to put a real softness on a
[1:42:33] heart to say, "God, let me stay in your
[1:42:35] will."
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Let me quit overthinking this message.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; There's people on the internet every day
[1:42:41] overthinking this,
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; looking for a perfection in a prophet.
[1:42:45] And every one of the prophets in the
[1:42:46] Bible had flaws.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Had mistakes. They don't even know their
[1:42:51] Bible.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And they're expecting a perfect man with
[1:42:56] everything he said perfect. And listen,
[1:42:58] that's not how they look at us. That's
[1:43:00] not how you look at prophets. And when
[1:43:02] he went down there, the king said, "I'm
[1:43:04] going to marry this girl. This this is
[1:43:06] done. It's in the bag. It's all over."
[1:43:08] And now Abraham's regretting. Oh, and
[1:43:10] what am I going to do? And you know, uh,
[1:43:13] he's all happy to marry. And it's just
[1:43:15] it's just a mess. And God gives that
[1:43:18] king a dream and says, "You marry her.
[1:43:20] You're a dead man."
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; This is the part of Grace that I don't
[1:43:25] understand.
[1:43:28] He says, "You, that is Abraham's wife.
[1:43:30] You give him back tomorrow morning. You
[1:43:32] give him back his wife. If you do marry,
[1:43:35] I'm going to kill you."
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Right? That's exactly.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; You see, you you don't think God's
[1:43:42] protecting his thought of you.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; You're going to mess it up. He ain't
[1:43:46] going to let you mess it up.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; This is the part it's like in the
[1:43:52] morning, give him back or I'm going to
[1:43:54] kill you. And when he gets his camels
[1:43:58] ready and he starts leaving, just before
[1:44:00] he leaves, ask Abraham to lay his hands
[1:44:04] on you and your kingdom to pronounce a
[1:44:06] blessing on you,
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I would be overthinking that one.
[1:44:16] What I'm supposed to have that liar
[1:44:20] lay his hands on me? I don't want no
[1:44:22] blessing from that guy.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Mhm. I don't think
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; but God's looking from his his thought
[1:44:31] of his son and he's willing to protect
[1:44:33] his son and there's one of the greatest
[1:44:35] mans on the face of face of the earth
[1:44:37] and even his mistakes he says you you
[1:44:40] pray that he will lay his hands on and
[1:44:42] bless your kingdom if you want a
[1:44:44] blessing from anybody it needs to come
[1:44:46] from him.
[1:44:49] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:44:52] I can only
[1:44:56] I can only think of the song Think About
[1:44:59] His Love because you know what?
[1:45:02] It's really what we only we only need to
[1:45:04] be thinking about his love and his
[1:45:06] goodness,
[1:45:11] his grace.
[1:45:14] His thoughts of us are higher. His
[1:45:18] thoughts of us are not of evil. But
[1:45:21] brother Paul, you don't know what I've
[1:45:23] done. God made David pay in so many
[1:45:28] ways, but he never took him out as king.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; He did that to Saul, but he never took
[1:45:34] him out of his position. His house was
[1:45:36] trouble all the way through,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; but it never changed his thought. This
[1:45:41] is my king after my own heart and he'll
[1:45:45] finish the work that he's put on earth
[1:45:48] to do.
[1:45:51] The David songwriter, he didn't write
[1:45:54] this one, but he maybe had one similar
[1:45:56] today. I'm going to think about his
[1:45:59] love.
[1:46:01] Think about his goodness.
[1:46:06] Think about his grace
[1:46:09] that has brought us through.
[1:46:14] For as high as the heavens above,
[1:46:19] great is the measure of our Father's
[1:46:24] love.
[1:46:30] Great is the measure of our
[1:46:35] love.
[1:46:39] Think about his love.
[1:46:43] Oh, think about his goodness.
[1:46:50] Think about his grace
[1:46:53] that has brought us through.
[1:47:00] For as high as the heavens above,
[1:47:05] great is the measure
[1:47:08] of our Father's love.
[1:47:16] Great is the measure
[1:47:19] of our father's.
[1:47:22] Giving you something to think about this
[1:47:24] week. Let's stand. Think about his love.
[1:47:30] Think about his just direct your
[1:47:32] thoughts.
[1:47:34] Gird your mind.
[1:47:37] Think about his grace
[1:47:40] that has brought us.
[1:47:45] Oh, for as high as the heavens above.
[1:47:52] Great is the measure of our Father's
[1:47:57] love.
[1:48:02] Great is the measure
[1:48:05] of our father. Can you close your eyes
[1:48:08] now? Just think about his promise. Think
[1:48:10] about his thought. Think about his love.
[1:48:15] his thoughts towards you.
[1:48:23] Think about it. Should make us just weep
[1:48:26] in his presence this morning.
[1:48:29] He's brought us through.
[1:48:33] High as the heavens above.
[1:48:38] Great is the measure of our father's
[1:48:43] love.
[1:48:46] Oh,
[1:48:48] great is the measure
[1:48:51] of our father's love.
[1:48:55] Precious Lord, we ask you, Father, to
[1:48:57] deposit your word in the hearts of the
[1:48:59] people. And Lord, if they're a seed of
[1:49:02] God, your offspring,
[1:49:04] there's something in them, Lord, that
[1:49:05] responds to their husband, Christ.
[1:49:08] to follow it, to come under the
[1:49:11] protection of it. So Lord, I pray for
[1:49:14] every soul represented here, Lord, that
[1:49:16] they heard something from the father
[1:49:19] today to call them and draw them closer
[1:49:21] to you. Lord, that you don't have to, we
[1:49:24] don't have to tell them and give them 10
[1:49:26] steps to do something. A seed of God
[1:49:28] will be awakened to what they need to
[1:49:31] do. They know what to do, Lord. And
[1:49:34] they'll step into doing that when they
[1:49:36] catch the mind of God and catch the
[1:49:38] thought that you had of them before the
[1:49:40] foundation of the world. What love is
[1:49:42] this, Lord? What love is this? May we
[1:49:45] direct our thoughts off of worry and
[1:49:49] anxiety and fear and trying to figure
[1:49:53] everything out.
[1:49:55] Lord, could we be molded into people
[1:49:57] that just has such a trust in you that
[1:50:02] you say, "Trust in the Lord with all of
[1:50:04] thine heart. Don't lean to your own
[1:50:07] overthinking.
[1:50:09] In all thy ways acknowledge him and
[1:50:11] he'll direct your paths. Could we be a
[1:50:14] people that trust you so much that our
[1:50:16] minds, our thoughts, everything would
[1:50:19] just rest in you, Lord, and rest in the
[1:50:22] thoughts of God. You'll figure it out,
[1:50:24] Lord. You've already got it figured out.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; You've already got it figured out. You
[1:50:28] already know what needs to be done,
[1:50:30] Lord. Bless your people, Lord. Lead them
[1:50:33] to
[1:50:35] whatever is next in their lives. Don't
[1:50:38] let them linger, Lord, but lead them,
[1:50:41] Father, and may they trust you and
[1:50:43] follow you.
[1:50:45] Feed on your word.
[1:50:48] Oh, God. Thank you for your thoughts
[1:50:49] towards us, Lord.
[1:50:53] thoughts of peace
[1:50:55] and not of evil
[1:50:58] to give us an expected end.
[1:51:01] Lord, we look forward to that change of
[1:51:03] the body, that rapture
[1:51:05] to bring us out of this Babylon. Lord,
[1:51:09] you promised it, Father.
[1:51:12] Jesus name.
[1:51:16] Restless heart,
[1:51:18] troubled mind.
[1:51:21] I try hard to find
[1:51:27] answers
[1:51:28] to why it's turned out this way.
[1:51:36] While my heart's
[1:51:39] gripped with fear,
[1:51:42] I can feel him draw near.
[1:51:47] Gently
[1:51:49] I hear my Lord say,
[1:51:57] "Oh, keep
[1:52:00] your mind.
[1:52:03] Stay
[1:52:05] on me.
[1:52:08] Stay
[1:52:10] on me.
[1:52:18] And I
[1:52:21] will give
[1:52:24] you perfect
[1:52:26] peace.
[1:52:29] Sweet
[1:52:32] release.
[1:52:34] If you'll just keep your mind stay on
[1:52:40] me.
[1:52:44] It's evening time,
[1:52:47] the hours late.
[1:52:49] There's a pressure
[1:52:52] so great.
[1:52:56] Everywhere
[1:52:58] hearts fail
[1:53:00] because of fear.
[1:53:05] But when I think
[1:53:07] of lovely things,
[1:53:10] all the peace his word brings.
[1:53:16] His still small voice
[1:53:20] I can hear.
[1:53:23] This what he says now. That's what he
[1:53:25] says. Oh, keep
[1:53:28] your mind.
[1:53:31] Stay
[1:53:33] on me.
[1:53:37] Stay
[1:53:39] on me.
[1:53:42] Faithfully.
[1:53:46] And I
[1:53:49] will give
[1:53:52] you perfect
[1:53:55] peace.
[1:53:57] Sweet
[1:53:59] release.
[1:54:02] If you'll just keep your
[1:54:06] singing the first verse again just
[1:54:08] before we dismiss. First verse. Listen
[1:54:10] to this now. Restless heart,
[1:54:15] troubled mind.
[1:54:17] I try hard to find
[1:54:23] answer why
[1:54:27] it's turned out this way.
[1:54:32] But while my heart's
[1:54:34] gripped with fear,
[1:54:37] I can feel him drowning.
[1:54:43] Can Can you hear that voice this
[1:54:46] morning? Can you hear that voice?
[1:54:49] That gentle voice telling you this
[1:54:50] morning, "Oh, just keep."
[1:54:55] He understands. He knows.
[1:55:03] He loves you this morning.
[1:55:06] He knows his thoughts and he thinks
[1:55:08] towards you,
[1:55:10] precious thoughts.
[1:55:12] And I
[1:55:16] will give
[1:55:18] you perfect.
[1:55:22] Amen.
[1:55:24] Sweet
[1:55:26] release.
[1:55:28] If you'll just keep your mind, stay on
[1:55:34] me.
[1:55:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. All hearts clear
[1:55:39] this morning. You're welcome to stay and
[1:55:41] just enjoy this presence of the Lord.
[1:55:44] Take it home with you. Take it into your
[1:55:45] homes. Take it into your hearts, your
[1:55:47] families. Take it in your private
[1:55:49] communication with the Lord. Just invite
[1:55:51] his presence. You don't need church to
[1:55:54] do that. You don't need a pastor to do
[1:55:55] that. You have that within you that
[1:55:58] calls out to God.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Oh, may you be encouraged
[1:56:02] in the Lord. How many were encouraged
[1:56:04] today? That was my heart. Encouraged in
[1:56:07] the Lord. His thoughts are greater.
[1:56:09] Isn't there a song there that says,
[1:56:11] "Bigger than all my problems, bigger
[1:56:13] than all my fears.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; God's bigger than any mountain." Do we
[1:56:17] have that on the songs? And we'll sing
[1:56:18] that as we go. Bigger than any shadows.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; That's the course there. Praise the
[1:56:24] Lord. We love you all. If you need
[1:56:26] prayer, just come forward. We'll pray
[1:56:28] with you.
[1:56:30] Bigger than all my problems, bigger than
[1:56:33] all my fears, God is bigger than any
[1:56:37] mountain that I can or cannot see.
[1:56:43] Bigger than all my question, bigger than
[1:56:47] anything. God is bigger than any
[1:56:50] mountain that I can or cannot see. First
[1:56:54] verse.
[1:56:56] Bigger than any shadows that fall across
[1:57:00] my path. God is bigger than any mountain
[1:57:04] that I can or cannot see.
[1:57:09] Bigger than all the confusion.
[1:57:12] Bigger than anything. God is bigger than
[1:57:15] I don't know if I'm singing that right
[1:57:16] or not. Can or cannot see. Amen. Oh,
[1:57:21] bigger than all my problem. His thoughts
[1:57:24] are bigger.
[1:57:26] God is bigger. You got to come and see
[1:57:29] that I can or cannot see.
[1:57:33] Well, bigger than all my questions.
[1:57:36] Bigger than Amen. He's bigger. Bigger
[1:57:40] than any mountain that I can or cannot
[1:57:43] see.
[1:57:46] bigger than all the giants of fear and
[1:57:50] unbelief. God is bigger than any
[1:57:53] mountain that I can or cannot see.
[1:57:58] Look at this. Bigger than all my
[1:58:00] hang-ups. Bigger than anything. God is
[1:58:04] bigger. Amen. I can say amen to that.
[1:58:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:11] Oh, bigger than all my problems.
[1:58:16] Go to the rock as well. I go to the rock
[1:58:19] and I can see.
[1:58:23] Oh, bigger than all my questions, bigger
[1:58:27] than anything. God is bigger than any
[1:58:31] mountain that I can and cannot see. Oh,
[1:58:35] bigger than all my problems, bigger than
[1:58:38] all my fears. God is bigger than any
[1:58:42] mountain that I can and cannot see.
[1:58:47] Oh, bigger than all my questions, bigger
[1:58:51] than anything. God is bigger than any
[1:58:54] mountain that I can and cannot see.
[1:59:00] the rock.
[1:59:08] Where did Where can I go?
[1:59:13] When no one left to who can I talk to? I
[1:59:19] go to the rock.
[1:59:22] When there's no found, no one left to
[1:59:25] listen. Who can I lean on?
[1:59:28] There we go.
[1:59:30] When there's no nation stable, I go to
[1:59:34] the rock. I know he's able. I go to the
[1:59:39] rock.
[1:59:40] Amen. I go to the rock of my salvation.
[1:59:46] I go to the stone that the builders
[1:59:49] rejected. I run into the mountain and
[1:59:53] the mountain stands by me.
[1:59:58] When the earth all around me is sinking
[2:00:01] sand, on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[2:00:06] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[2:00:10] friend, I go to the rock.
[2:00:15] Where do I hide?
[2:00:19] Till the storms have all passed over.
[2:00:23] Who do I run to
[2:00:27] when the winds of sorrow threaten? Is
[2:00:31] there a refuge?
[2:00:36] In the time of tribulation?
[2:00:39] When my soul needs
[2:00:42] consultation,
[2:00:43] I go to the rock.
[2:00:47] Oh, I go to the rock of my salvation. I
[2:00:52] go to the stone that the builders
[2:00:54] rejected. Running to the mountain and
[2:00:58] the mountain stands by me.
[2:01:03] When the earth all around me is sinking
[2:01:06] sand on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[2:01:11] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[2:01:15] friend, I go to the rock. I go to the
[2:01:18] rock. Oh, I go to the rock of my
[2:01:22] salvation. I go to the stone that the
[2:01:26] builders rejected. I run into the
[2:01:29] mountain. Then the mountain stands by
[2:01:32] me.
[2:01:35] When the earth all around me is sinking
[2:01:39] sand, on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[2:01:44] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[2:01:47] friend, I go to the ride.
[2:01:51] Oh, when I need a shelter, when I need a
[2:01:55] friend, I go to the ride.
[2:01:59] Oh, one more time. When I need a
[2:02:01] shelter, when I need a friend, I go to
[2:02:05] the ride.
