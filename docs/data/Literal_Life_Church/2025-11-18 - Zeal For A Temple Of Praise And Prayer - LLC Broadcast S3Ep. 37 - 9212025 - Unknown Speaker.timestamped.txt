[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:28] for. It's not what I wanted.
[0:33] It's not something I understand.
[0:40] My circumstances
[0:43] may be so confusing.
[0:46] I'm placing it all in your head.
[0:54] Your ways are higher than mine.
[1:00] I want mountains to move.
[1:03] You want me to climb.
[1:07] So I'm going to trust your work, your
[1:12] will, and your tongue.
[1:17] Your ways are higher than mine.
[1:25] [Music]
[1:34] One day I'm sure I will look back and
[1:39] marvel
[1:40] at how you knew best all along.
[1:48] you see from heaven.
[1:51] You know it's the hard times that make
[1:55] my face steady and strong.
[2:01] Your ways are higher than mine.
[2:07] I want mountains to move.
[2:11] You want me to climb.
[2:14] So I'm going to trust your work, your
[2:19] will, and your time.
[2:23] [Music]
[2:25] Your ways are higher than mine.
[2:31] When I start to doubt,
[2:35] help me believe
[2:38] somewhere
[2:40] so far above me.
[2:45] Your ways are higher than mine.
[2:51] I want mountains, too.
[2:55] You want me to climb,
[2:58] so I'm going to trust your word, your
[3:04] will, and your tongue.
[3:07] [Music]
[3:09] Ooh,
[3:13] your ways
[3:15] are so much higher than mine.
[3:21] [Music]
[3:26] Your ways are higher
[3:30] than mine.
[3:36] Matthew chap 21 and verse 12. And Jesus
[3:41] went into the temple of God, and cast
[3:44] out all them that sold, and bought in
[3:47] the temple, and overthrew the tables of
[3:51] the money changers, and the seats of
[3:53] them that sold doves, and said unto
[3:56] them, It is written, "My house shall be
[4:00] called the house of prayer, but ye have
[4:03] made it a den of thieves." and the blind
[4:07] and the lame came to him in the temple
[4:10] and he healed them. So this morning I
[4:14] want to go back into the attention that
[4:16] Jesus gave here to the temple and what
[4:19] was going on in the temple. The focus
[4:22] was in the temple and there were not
[4:24] good things going on in the temple and
[4:26] he was concerned about that. He was
[4:28] burdened. He's actually the Bible said
[4:30] he was zealous and had a zeal for the
[4:32] house of God. And instead of uh besides
[4:35] just uh beating the money changers out
[4:38] and cleaning the house, then he turned
[4:40] around and begin to use the house of God
[4:42] for what it was intended for. And they
[4:45] brought the lame and the the blind. And
[4:47] he began to do those things because I
[4:49] believe that's what the temple of God
[4:51] should be manifesting. The power of God
[4:54] to heal, to change lives. It should be
[4:57] the central location for that and it
[5:00] should not be a place that they they
[5:02] were using it for. So you can see the
[5:04] temple had lost its original purpose.
[5:06] Keep in mind that we'll be speaking
[5:08] about your temple because you're the
[5:10] temple today of the Holy Ghost. Let's
[5:13] read another place in John how he says
[5:15] it and he mentions it in all four
[5:16] gospels this incident where he goes into
[5:18] the temple. But here it's just worded
[5:21] just a little bit different. John 2
[5:24] verse 12. After this he went down to
[5:26] Capernaum. He and his mother and his
[5:28] brethren and his disciples. And they
[5:29] continued there not many days. And the
[5:31] Jews Passover was at hand. And Jesus
[5:34] went up to Jerusalem and found in the
[5:37] temple those that sold oxen and sheep
[5:40] and doves and the changers of money
[5:42] sitting. And when he had made a scourge
[5:44] of small cords, he drove them all out of
[5:47] the temple and the sheep and the oxen
[5:50] and poured out the money changers money
[5:52] and overthrew the tables. It doesn't
[5:55] look like he's asked acting like the
[5:57] Jesus that we know. This isn't a very
[6:00] gentle Jesus. And it's because he became
[6:02] very concerned and zealous over the
[6:04] house of God when it was being used for
[6:06] purposes that it wasn't supposed to be
[6:09] used for. I would say to you this
[6:11] morning that we should be just as
[6:13] zealous for the house of God as he was
[6:15] when there's something there that's not
[6:17] for the original purpose.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; He became very concerned and said unto
[6:22] them that sold doves, "Take these things
[6:24] hence. Make not my father's house a
[6:27] house of merchandise." And his disciples
[6:30] remembered that it was written, "The
[6:32] zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
[6:36] taken from the book of Psalms and
[6:38] prophecy and David saying this the zeal
[6:41] of thine house. So I'd like you to keep
[6:43] that uh as the disciples could attach
[6:46] the scripture. They couldn't do this in
[6:48] many things but this they could they
[6:50] could attach the Old Testament prophecy
[6:52] of David and attach it to the way Jesus
[6:54] was acting in his passion for the house
[6:57] of God that it be kept clean. Can you
[7:00] say amen? And that it be used for God's
[7:02] purpose. Other place he says, "My
[7:04] father's house shall be called the house
[7:07] of prayer." The temple of the Lord, the
[7:10] temples of the Lord is for purposes not
[7:13] for what they're doing, but for it's for
[7:15] uh it's for exuberant praise to the
[7:18] Lord. That's what the temple's for. It's
[7:20] for prayer. Can you say amen? And and so
[7:23] when we get the temples away from this
[7:25] purpose, then we are, I could say,
[7:27] backsliding from God's original purpose
[7:30] for him to fill you with the Holy Ghost.
[7:33] And so this zeal, this passion is what
[7:36] the disciples see. And I'd like to speak
[7:38] on the zeal for a temple of praise and
[7:41] prayer because we should be just as
[7:43] zealous over our temples and houses of
[7:46] God that it remains a house of praise
[7:49] and a house of prayer. the percentage of
[7:51] the kings of the Old Testament who
[7:54] sought God for a revival and they moved
[7:57] to change the lifestyle that they had
[8:00] become backsliden in. There was kings
[8:02] there was 42 kings that I put in front
[8:04] of you and there was a small percentage
[8:07] eight out of the 42 that actually uh had
[8:10] a call for revival to move to change the
[8:13] lifestyle and the lifestyle that they
[8:15] had developed in the Jews was a
[8:17] lifestyle of the heathen. They had taken
[8:19] on the heathen worship. They had taken
[8:21] on the heathen lifestyle. And these uh
[8:24] few kings, very small percentage of
[8:27] them, uh something rose in their heart
[8:29] to change. But one of the reasons that
[8:31] they wanted to change things and to
[8:34] purge the idols out of everything in the
[8:36] country and in the the tribes that they
[8:38] were over is that the main thing that
[8:40] was affected by this backsliding was the
[8:42] temple was affected. The temple praise
[8:45] was affected. the temple where God came
[8:47] down and brought his glory that was
[8:49] affected and we'll find that in our
[8:51] lives is that when we we we find that we
[8:54] be when we begin to look towards other
[8:56] motives and other things and look into
[8:58] the world too much it's what what gets
[9:01] what for a Christian what gets affected
[9:03] most is our temple because this temple
[9:05] is to be reserved for God it's to be
[9:07] dedicated for God and it's not just our
[9:10] souls but it's our minds it's our
[9:12] spirits it's our it's our emotions it's
[9:14] everything God wants wants to fill this
[9:16] whole temple. But when we get our eyes
[9:18] looking at the heathen ways and what
[9:20] they do and we get a little jealousy or
[9:22] whatever it is there, we start adapting
[9:24] to that. What gets affected? Our temple
[9:27] becomes affected. So that we can't
[9:30] worship freely. We can't pray freely.
[9:33] And even our prayers can be hindered
[9:37] &gt;&gt; because why? Our temple's not right. Our
[9:39] temple's not the way it should be. Even
[9:41] the Bible speaks of a man and how he
[9:43] treats his wife that his prayers could
[9:46] be hindered. The way he treats his wife,
[9:48] the Bible says that if you don't treat
[9:50] her as a an equal with God as co-airs
[9:53] together, she is a weaker vessel, but if
[9:56] you don't treat her right, your prayers
[9:57] can be hindered. None of us want to be
[10:00] in a place where our prayers are
[10:02] hindered. If there's any everything else
[10:03] that falls apart, we want our prayer to
[10:06] stay in the place that God can hear our
[10:08] prayer.
[10:10] And so it affected the temple. And so
[10:13] they would get a revival. The the temple
[10:15] had lost its purpose. It lost its
[10:17] praise. It's lost its freedom. It lost
[10:19] its sacrifice. And it lost its effective
[10:22] prayer. And there was a small percentage
[10:25] that had the zeal in their heart to
[10:27] restore the temple, to clean the temple,
[10:30] to bring back the praise and worship in
[10:32] the temple. I read to you uh about
[10:34] Hezekiah and the different ones, but
[10:36] some of them they said, "Let's bring
[10:37] everything back in. Let's bring the
[10:38] priest back in. Let's bring the
[10:40] sacrifice. Let's bring our atonement.
[10:42] Let's preach our atonement. Let's bring
[10:44] it back. Let's bring the musicians back
[10:46] in. Let's restore. There was only a few
[10:49] that had a zeal to say, "Let's get this
[10:52] temple back to to the place it should be
[10:54] in."
[10:56] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to all of us this morning
[10:58] that those percentages are small.
[11:00] There's a lot of Christians in the
[11:01] world, but how many Christians have a
[11:03] passion and a zeal for their temples?
[11:08] Praise the Lord. So, let me just uh lay
[11:12] this out to you. The temple became the
[11:14] central point for everything in Israel.
[11:16] You remember that when they got the ark
[11:18] and then they put it in the tabernacle,
[11:20] which is a temporary place. They'd pull
[11:22] up the stakes of the tent of the
[11:24] tabernacle. When the pillar of fire
[11:26] moved, they move with it. And so,
[11:28] whatever the pillar of fire moved, then
[11:29] they put the stakes down. They'd build
[11:31] this temporary tabernacle. And it kept
[11:33] moving. It kept moving all the time. And
[11:35] God would come down in that the the word
[11:37] the ark was in there. Everything was in
[11:39] there. But then then God put it on
[11:41] David's heart to build a permanent
[11:43] temple, a permanent place. And when this
[11:46] happened and when it was dedicated, the
[11:48] glory of the Lord came down. And we
[11:50] realize it became the central I could
[11:53] safely say it became the central place
[11:56] or headquarters for everything,
[11:59] including the rest of the world. hearing
[12:01] about it. The rest of the world got wind
[12:04] of what was taking place in this central
[12:06] place.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba heard about it and
[12:09] she traveled many, many days to go see
[12:12] what was going on in Jerusalem. And it
[12:14] what was it was what was what was she
[12:16] was intrigued by is this place. What was
[12:19] happening in the temple? What's going on
[12:21] in the temple? God's got a gift there
[12:23] that's working. Uh Solomon was working
[12:26] the gift of discernment. Can you say
[12:27] amen? They had a godly king. It was a
[12:30] revival. It was a millennium when it
[12:32] comes to the children of Israel. And
[12:34] this place, everybody wanted to come and
[12:36] see it around the world and see what was
[12:38] because it was just such a move of God
[12:41] and his glory came down. They heard in
[12:43] the newspapers about his glory filling
[12:45] that temple so much that the minister
[12:47] couldn't even speak. They heard it
[12:49] through the news and they were intrigued
[12:51] by this. But I just want to say it was
[12:53] the central location for everything God
[12:56] was doing.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, where's the
[13:00] headquarters today?
[13:04] Where's the central place that God wants
[13:07] to do most of his work?
[13:10] In you. All of the glory, all of the
[13:13] praise, all of the faith, all the faith
[13:16] to move mountains. It's not to come
[13:18] through just the preachers. It's not to
[13:21] come through just some movement or some
[13:23] special evangelist. Every believer in
[13:26] the kingdom of God is to be the central
[13:28] place for God to work.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; He wants to work in you.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; And that means you can be in a grocery
[13:35] store. You can be at home. Fathers, you
[13:37] can be there with your children. Can you
[13:39] say amen? And you don't have to wait to
[13:41] get to church. You don't have to say,
[13:42] "Well, I'll share that. I'll get my
[13:43] pastor with you." You become the central
[13:46] place
[13:48] to be able to witness to this. I'm
[13:51] telling you, they came from around the
[13:52] world. And in that temple, the ark was
[13:54] there, which means the word was there,
[13:56] the sacrifice was there, the place of
[13:58] unrestricted worship and praise was
[14:00] there. But mostly Solomon said this,
[14:03] when they pray, he prayed to God when he
[14:06] built the temple. says, "My prayer is
[14:08] that when the people pray,
[14:10] when the when the prayers go up from
[14:12] this place and when even they're in
[14:15] another country and they would, this is
[14:17] what Solomon asked, that they look
[14:19] towards this central place that their
[14:21] prayers their prayers would be heard."
[14:26] &gt;&gt; And this was a great desire, Solomon.
[14:28] And God said, "I'll do it. I'll do it."
[14:31] Even if they look out of a whale,
[14:34] Jonah's in the whale and I don't know if
[14:36] he had his GPS on his phone or how he
[14:38] figured out how to point towards the
[14:40] temple, but he did it in the belly of a
[14:44] big fish. He got on his knees amidst all
[14:48] of the whatever he's in and he brought
[14:50] his prayer towards the temple and God
[14:53] delivered him from the fish
[14:57] &gt;&gt; because this became the central place
[15:00] that God said my glory will come down
[15:03] there and if you look to this the prayer
[15:06] the prayer will be answered. That's the
[15:08] most important thing is that our prayer
[15:10] be heard and that we have effective
[15:12] prayer. It doesn't matter when it
[15:14] happens, brothers and sisters, but we
[15:16] know that when we pray, we have
[15:18] confidence and faith in our prayer.
[15:20] Every condemnation is under the blood.
[15:22] Every guilt trip that Satan's putting us
[15:24] on us, we're not living by guilt trip.
[15:26] We have faith and confidence that when
[15:28] we pray, whether it's now or 10 years
[15:30] from now, God has heard our prayer and
[15:33] the answers on his way. Sometimes it
[15:35] takes 21 days of fighting through
[15:38] demons. Can you say amen? Like he did
[15:40] with Daniel. But Daniel kept fasting and
[15:42] praying. And the angel kept fighting
[15:44] through the prince of Persia. And if you
[15:47] keep praying on this side, God is on his
[15:49] way on this side.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Because he promised that kind of prayer.
[15:54] I'm going to get through to that prayer.
[15:56] Your temple is a temple of the Holy
[15:58] Ghost. You will have the zeal to say,
[16:00] "Now I better watch over that temple. I
[16:02] better keep it clean. I better not let
[16:04] habits get into it. I better not watch
[16:06] the wrong movies.
[16:09] Yeah,
[16:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take it further at the end
[16:12] of the sermon, but I'll mention to you,
[16:14] it's not just bad things of the world
[16:16] that we clean out of our temples and our
[16:18] minds, but it's bitterness.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; It's resentment.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; It's things that get lodged in our
[16:25] spirit against somebody.
[16:28] It's things that come in that are there
[16:30] in a small section of our life that we
[16:34] allow to stay there. And if we really
[16:36] had a zeal for the holy for the Holy
[16:38] Ghost being on us, then we would say,
[16:40] "Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've
[16:42] got a concern for this temple.
[16:45] I've got a zeal for this temple. I can't
[16:47] worry about everybody else." That's what
[16:49] they said about getting the oil. He
[16:51] says, "We have not enough for oursel.
[16:53] Let them go and buy. I can't worry about
[16:55] somebody else's Holy Ghost. I got to
[16:57] make sure I have it."
[17:00] &gt;&gt; You can pray for somebody. You can
[17:01] encourage somebody. But I think
[17:03] sometimes we worry too much about what's
[17:05] going on in other people's lives and
[17:07] we're not focused on our own temple.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; We're not focused on our own thoughts.
[17:12] Why am I feeling this way? Where did
[17:14] this come from? Uh Satan's using he's in
[17:16] my spirit here. Satan's getting a hold
[17:18] of me. And so when we have that type of
[17:20] fervor and zeal for our own temple of
[17:23] the Lord, then we're saying whatever it
[17:26] is that causes me to restrict my praise,
[17:29] to be limited in my praise, to be
[17:31] limited in my freedom, to be limited in
[17:34] my prayer, condemnation limits my
[17:37] prayer. Let's remove the condemnation.
[17:39] Let's get past the guilt that's in our
[17:41] mind, in our spirit. Let's let's leave
[17:44] those things alone. So why? My temple
[17:46] can be free. Hallelujah.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "Come and lay hands. I
[17:51] trust you. Lay your hands on me." We got
[17:53] confidence when we lay our hands on
[17:54] them.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Something's going to happen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:01] Dwelleth not in temples made with hands.
[18:03] And when you come to the New Testament,
[18:04] he said, "A body thou has prepared me."
[18:07] Then it says, "The Lord will suddenly
[18:09] come to his temple." That's the prophecy
[18:11] I think in Malachi. The Lord will
[18:13] suddenly come to his temple. And they
[18:15] thought, the Jews thought, "Oh, he's
[18:17] going to come to this physical Solomon's
[18:19] temple." No, he'll come to his real
[18:21] temple. And did he ever come to a
[18:23] temple, but he didn't come to a temple
[18:25] of a building? He took all of himself
[18:27] and poured himself into Jesus Christ.
[18:30] The Lord shall suddenly come to his
[18:32] temple.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? God, the fullness of
[18:37] everything that he was, would pour
[18:39] himself into a body
[18:42] &gt;&gt; because that's what his desire was.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord,
[18:46] &gt;&gt; temples, bodies
[18:48] to be filled.
[18:50] And so when Jesus came,
[18:53] he didn't pour the fullness of himself
[18:55] into a prophet.
[18:58] I said when Jesus came, God did not pour
[19:01] the fullness of himself in a prophet
[19:04] &gt;&gt; or else he would have done it in John
[19:06] the Baptist.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; He poured it into a son,
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; So he didn't pour the fullness of
[19:14] himself into a prophet. This was not his
[19:15] final emphasis. It was his son. The
[19:18] mystery continues to the end because in
[19:20] the last few chapters of the Bible when
[19:22] the new Jerusalem, it says when the new
[19:24] Jerusalem come down, it come down as a
[19:27] bride adorned for her husband. Who's the
[19:29] new Jerusalem spiritually? You're the
[19:31] new Jerusalem. You're the city of God.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; The bride is the new Jerusalem.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; When we go to a physical place, yes, but
[19:39] God's emphasis is not the physical
[19:41] place. He said, I go prepare a place for
[19:44] you. That's fine. But what's the final
[19:47] thing? New Jerusalem coming down as a
[19:48] bride adorned for her son for her
[19:50] husband. The final end is and then he
[19:54] says those words at the end. Behold,
[19:56] finally the tabernacle of God. This is
[20:00] the last few scriptures of your Bible.
[20:03] Behold the final goal has been met.
[20:06] Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
[20:10] men.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. You need to rejoice.
[20:17] Not a prophet,
[20:19] &gt;&gt; not a church,
[20:21] &gt;&gt; it's in men.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; The final resting place is in his
[20:27] people.
[20:28] And that's why why is the final thing in
[20:32] the last two or three scriptures? Who's
[20:35] speaking?
[20:36] Who's saying come if you're thirsty?
[20:39] Who's making the appeal to come? The
[20:42] spirit and the bride. the only ones that
[20:45] will take time to have a zeal to cleanse
[20:47] their temple and give attention to it.
[20:49] And I want to just give attention to
[20:51] saying give attention because sometimes
[20:54] it's not just cleansing your temple of
[20:56] dirty things, but it's always having
[20:59] attention to your temple.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; It's the most important thing. You can
[21:04] help a lot of other people, but you
[21:06] better not ignore attention to your own
[21:09] temple. What do you mean, brother Paul?
[21:11] your own thoughts, your own spirit,
[21:13] where your heart is. I preach a lot on
[21:15] these things. I'm sorry. That's just my
[21:16] bent. It's that where where is your
[21:19] temple? Where are you at right now? And
[21:21] people ignore it. It's like somebody
[21:24] ignoring their health. We we can't do
[21:26] that. I I I struggle in that area
[21:27] myself. I'll be honest with you. But we
[21:29] cannot ignore our health. You know, they
[21:31] say about teeth. If you ignore your
[21:33] teeth, they'll go away.
[21:37] The dentists tell us that. I made the
[21:39] mistake of walking into a dentist office
[21:40] when I was about 8 years old with a
[21:42] sucker in my mouth. I had those nurses
[21:45] and doctors all over me just attacking
[21:47] me. What are you doing in here with
[21:48] that? And they threw it out. Threw it in
[21:50] the trash. I just didn't think I walked
[21:52] into a dentist's office with a sucker.
[21:55] And doctors to say, you know, hey, you
[21:57] know, you you you you can't ignore
[22:01] things that are important in your own
[22:02] temple. You could be a doctor, a nurse,
[22:05] and a nurse trying to help everybody
[22:07] else and ignore your own temple.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; And you're thinking about this morning.
[22:15] I think there's a lot of Christians in
[22:16] this world that are maybe on the
[22:19] internet and they're constantly thinking
[22:20] about what's going on in the message and
[22:23] what's going on in other people's lives
[22:25] and everybody else's temple while
[22:27] ignoring their own their own read your
[22:30] Bible and pray every day, their own
[22:32] fellowship with the Lord, their own
[22:33] communication with him. They're caught
[22:35] up in what everybody else is doing. But
[22:38] I believe we need to give attention to
[22:40] our own temple. To some of you, that
[22:43] seems selfish. It's not selfish because
[22:46] when this is right, when this vessel is
[22:48] right, that's how we can be most
[22:50] effective to help other people. You
[22:53] can't ignore your temple. You can't
[22:56] ignore your mind. You can't ignore
[22:58] what's inside of you. And so I want to
[23:00] say, hey, you might even have to say,
[23:03] hey, push back a little bit. Say, I'm
[23:05] not able to do all of this.
[23:08] I'm not able to go and take all these
[23:10] invitations
[23:11] &gt;&gt; because attention first is my own
[23:13] temple.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not able to do what I was able to do
[23:18] to help the whole world because I got to
[23:21] make sure this temple is ready for a
[23:23] rapture. This temple is holy. This
[23:26] temple is free. Yes.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; The ones who cleanse it is the ones who
[23:36] know the potential of it. That it's not
[23:38] just church.
[23:40] I'm not just another human being. I'm
[23:43] not cheap. My vessel is not cheap. I
[23:45] teach this to the young people. Vessels
[23:46] of honor, vessels of dishonor. And you
[23:49] will dishonor your vessel if you don't
[23:51] have a value for yourself.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; You will commit fornication. Many times
[23:55] it's because you do not had a value in
[23:58] the word and in Christ of who you are as
[24:00] a human being. If you knew that value,
[24:03] then you protect it. Then you cleanse
[24:05] it. You keep your mind clear. You don't
[24:07] dabble and feed on all kinds of
[24:09] pornography. Why? Because you value this
[24:12] temple. You give attention to this mind.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And so your temple is
[24:19] a temple of the Holy Ghost. I'm not
[24:21] cheap. I'm not just another human being.
[24:23] If you go do the things of the world,
[24:24] then you value yourself as just another
[24:26] person of the world, just another human.
[24:28] You're not another human being. You're
[24:30] sitting here this morning and a lot of
[24:32] you shouldn't even be here, but you're
[24:34] still here. Even though you've sinned
[24:36] and you've messed up and you've had a
[24:38] hard past life, but guess what? You're
[24:40] still here because there's something in
[24:42] you that still wants God.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[24:46] &gt;&gt; There's a reason you're here. You many
[24:48] of you shouldn't. I know your
[24:49] testimonies. There's people sitting
[24:51] here, I wish I could have the
[24:52] testimonies right now. You shouldn't be
[24:54] here. The things that you've been
[24:55] through, the deaths in your family that
[24:58] Satan should have taken you down and you
[25:00] give up on everything, but you didn't
[25:02] give up. You're still here.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; You're still growing.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; You have to begin to value. I must have
[25:11] value as my temple.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Now, you God's given attention to it. He
[25:16] provides you preachers like this that
[25:19] are in your face.
[25:22] That'll tell you the truth even when I
[25:24] don't even want to do it. That will be
[25:26] honest with you, that'll encourage you,
[25:28] sometimes rebuke you, and I'm putting it
[25:31] in your face all the time. Here I am.
[25:33] And God is giving attention to your
[25:36] vessel.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; But there's something else. You have to
[25:39] give attention to your vessel.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; You have to value and see how much
[25:44] potential you have. say, "Well, I've
[25:46] really messed up." Put it bring it under
[25:48] the blood.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Bring it under the blood. Come to the
[25:52] altar.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Ask forgiveness from God. And it's time
[25:56] to move on to your full potential.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; I'm damaged goods. I'm finished. You're
[26:00] not finished.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; You're not finished.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; God still has potential for your life.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Get a hold of it. Say, "Lord, forgive me
[26:10] of what I've done wrong. Let me never
[26:11] use my temple for that again. But now
[26:13] let it be used for the kingdom of God
[26:15] and for your glory.
[26:17] You must have value in the temple that
[26:20] God's given you in order for you to
[26:22] clean it and give attention to it. Know
[26:25] you not that you are the temple of God
[26:26] and that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[26:28] you? It's a question. Don't you know
[26:30] you're the temple of God and that the
[26:31] spirit of God dwellth in you? If any man
[26:33] defile the temple of God, him shall God
[26:35] destroy. For the temple of God is holy,
[26:37] which temple ye are. Let no man deceive
[26:39] himself. You know, hello
[26:43] Selfdeception is the worst kind.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; And that's biblical. Let no man deceive
[26:49] himself. Selfdeception is the worst
[26:51] kind. You can be deceived by somebody
[26:52] else. But you can be deceived yourself.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive himself. For if any
[26:58] man among you seemth to be wise in this
[27:00] world, let him become a fool that he may
[27:02] be wise for the wisdom of this world.
[27:04] I'm not going to continue on. That's the
[27:05] one place he says uh the temple is the
[27:08] Holy Ghost. Then over in chapter 6, real
[27:09] quickly with me, chapter 6, verse 12.
[27:13] All things are lawful for me, but not
[27:15] all things are expedient. In other
[27:17] words, I'm I'm able to do all things,
[27:19] but the other things are not a benefit
[27:21] to my temple. They're not a benefit to
[27:23] my Christian walk. I'm free to do
[27:25] whatever I want, but my wants have been
[27:27] changed. I don't not go to the bar today
[27:31] because I'm I the word tells me not to.
[27:34] I don't go because I don't have a desire
[27:35] to. It's true. I can do whatever I want,
[27:38] but my wants have been changed.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; And this is the temple of the Holy
[27:42] Ghost. I'm watching over where I go,
[27:46] &gt;&gt; what I do, what I watch, the music I
[27:49] listen to.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; All things are lawful, but not all
[27:53] things are expedient. They're not
[27:54] edifying to my body.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; That's the life of a Christian life. And
[27:59] then if you make a mistake, you see
[28:00] something you shouldn't see, which is
[28:02] very possible in the day we live in.
[28:05] You quickly say, "Lord, forgive me.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want to defile your temple."
