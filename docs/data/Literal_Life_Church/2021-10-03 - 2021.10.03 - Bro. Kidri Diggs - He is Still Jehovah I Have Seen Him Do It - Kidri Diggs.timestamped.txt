[0:02] then we want to go to um
[0:04] psalms 121.
[0:26] exodus chapter six if you haven't say
[0:28] man verse 1
[0:31] the bible says then the lord said unto
[0:32] moses now shall thou see what i will do
[0:36] to pharaoh
[0:37] for with a strong hand shall he
[0:40] let them go
[0:41] and with a strong hand
[0:43] shall he drive them out of his land
[0:46] and god spoken to moses and said unto
[0:49] him i am the lord
[0:51] and i appeared unto abraham
[0:54] unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of
[0:57] god almighty
[0:58] but my name jehovah
[1:01] was i not known to them
[1:03] amen let's go to
[1:05] psalms 121.
[1:11] verse 1 the bible says i will lift up
[1:14] mine eyes unto the heels from whence
[1:16] cometh my help
[1:18] my help cometh from the lord which made
[1:21] heaven and earth
[1:23] he will not suffer thy foot to be moved
[1:26] he that keepeth thee will not slumber
[1:30] behold
[1:31] he that keepeth israel shall neither
[1:34] slumber nor sleep
[1:35] the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy
[1:38] shade upon thy right hand
[1:40] the sun shall not smite thee by day nor
[1:43] the moon by night
[1:45] the lord shall preserve
[1:47] thee from all evil he shall preserve thy
[1:50] soul the lord shall
[1:52] preserve
[1:53] thy going out and thy coming
[1:56] in from the time forth
[1:59] and even forevermore
[2:01] may lord bless read of his word you can
[2:03] have your seats
[2:06] amen praise the lord
[2:11] this morning by the grace of god i want
[2:13] to encourage you amen
[2:16] how many loves to be encouraged
[2:19] but this encouragement i'm gonna i want
[2:21] to give out this morning
[2:23] it should never leave you
[2:26] it should stay with you forever
[2:28] because i'm gonna try to encourage you
[2:30] through the word of god
[2:32] and the word of god has no expiration
[2:34] date
[2:36] it doesn't change with the trials and
[2:39] error of life
[2:40] it doesn't change with the different
[2:42] storms that may come forward
[2:44] but the word of god remains the same
[2:47] so if you can receive any kind of
[2:49] encouragement out of the word it doesn't
[2:52] matter what you go through that word
[2:53] remains the same
[2:55] so all you got to do is pick that back
[2:57] up and be like david encourage yourself
[3:00] all over again
[3:02] hallelujah because one thing we have to
[3:04] realize when it came to the people of
[3:06] god
[3:07] when they went through things that they
[3:09] may have made mistakes but after the
[3:12] mistake was made god was still there
[3:15] god never changed who he was
[3:17] when samson was deceived and uh by
[3:20] delilah as soon as his hair grew back
[3:23] and he recognized that the strength of
[3:25] god was always there
[3:27] it was just that he got out of the way
[3:29] hallelujah and so was it with many other
[3:32] different saints in the bible whatever
[3:34] promise god gave he never changed it he
[3:37] stayed there he was just waiting for the
[3:39] people to recognize who he is amen
[3:43] and and by his grace
[3:46] today i want to use for a subject
[3:49] he is still jehovah
[3:52] he's still jehovah amen and you know i
[3:55] love the scripture right here where he
[3:57] says in exodus the 6th chapter i
[4:00] appealed to abraham unto isaac and unto
[4:03] jacob by the name
[4:05] of god almighty hallelujah
[4:07] but
[4:08] for my name jehovah was i not known
[4:11] now he's talking to moses he's telling
[4:14] moses
[4:16] that there are levels of me
[4:20] god is saying hallelujah that you can't
[4:22] just put me in this category there are
[4:25] levels of god
[4:33] [Laughter]
[4:41] but let me tell you something church if
[4:43] you tap into what god did for abraham
[4:46] he's still the same god
[4:48] he's tough he has no respective person
[4:51] but what we have to do is find out who
[5:09] but you know what i love about him being
[5:12] god almighty who was he to abraham what
[5:15] was he doing as god almighty before he
[5:18] became or before he pronounced himself
[5:21] as jehovah as god almighty what was he
[5:24] doing for abraham he was pushing abraham
[5:27] into his position of faith
[5:30] hallelujah he said i'm the mighty god
[5:33] and i'm gonna push you into the position
[5:36] of faith
[5:49] think about it amen abraham was just a
[5:52] regular ordinary person and god comes to
[5:55] him and he says i'm going to make you
[5:57] the father of faith
[6:00] it's going to start with you abraham and
[6:02] abraham is looking at himself him and
[6:04] his wife he said you're gonna have a son
[6:06] but this woman and sarah laughs holly
[6:09] and god is saying hallelujah why did you
[6:12] laugh i'm god almighty
[6:16] i can do anything earlier so what that
[6:19] your body is wrinkled so what
[6:22] that abraham is old so what
[6:25] do you guys may not be knowing he's
[6:27] knowing each other like that i'm god
[6:29] almighty
[6:32] oh i didn't know what i'm talking about
[6:36] see god knows what he's able to do
[6:38] capable of doing hallelujah he wants us
[6:41] hallelujah to try him amen he wants us
[6:45] hallelujah to put him in position over
[6:48] our lives
[6:49] but as god almighty what did he do amen
[6:52] he he pushed abraham to believe
[6:56] hallelujah abraham didn't know he was
[6:59] the father of faith but god did
[7:02] so what god did god kept pushing him
[7:05] that more and more faith would come out
[7:08] more and more faith would come out what
[7:11] was god doing ian you know what he was
[7:13] doing he was unlocking the mystery of
[7:15] faith
[7:18] wow hallelujah he was unlocking the
[7:20] mystery of faith in abraham what kind of
[7:23] faith was it it was perfect faith
[7:28] and god was going to show that there's a
[7:30] level of faith hallelujah
[7:32] that has to be a lock in the believer's
[7:35] life but abraham i'm going to start it
[7:36] with you and like i said last night
[7:39] hallelujah god pushed abraham to believe
[7:42] past his fears
[7:45] hallelujah even though he the the
[7:48] mystery is being unlocked he looks at
[7:51] sarah and he says hey you're very
[7:53] beautiful and king is gonna want you see
[7:56] his fears his imaginations produced
[7:58] something that wasn't even true
[8:02] he was he was god almighty he was there
[8:05] to protect hallelujah and abraham in his
[8:08] own mind he's saying they're going to
[8:11] take you and kill me
[8:14] where did that come from god never said
[8:16] that
[8:18] he produced that in his own imaginations
[8:21] when god had already told him i'm god
[8:24] almighty
[8:27] and what god does he always proves his
[8:29] word
[8:30] so he he allowed what abraham was
[8:32] thinking to happen
[8:35] just so he could show how great he is
[8:38] he let sarah get taken then god comes to
[8:41] the king in a dream and he says you're
[8:44] as good as a dead man if you don't give
[8:46] her back
[8:47] why because i'm god almighty
[8:50] i can do what i want to do holly i can
[8:53] even protect a liar
[8:57] wow hallelujah he don't deserve it but
[9:00] i'm gonna protect my liar why because
[9:02] i'm god almighty
[9:05] [Applause]
[9:08] church look at that our god is so great
[9:11] he can protect you even when you're in
[9:14] sin
[9:16] even when it's your fault the reason why
[9:19] you're into what you're into
[9:24] see other kings they couldn't do that
[9:27] when you go through the bible different
[9:28] kings and different things happen i
[9:30] think about esther hallelujah and when
[9:33] vashta wouldn't come to the king
[9:36] and
[9:36] and the different chamberlains and
[9:38] different ones that are around they say
[9:39] hey king we can't let this happen
[9:42] because the other women are going to
[9:44] hear about this and they're going to
[9:45] rebel
[9:47] not when it came to god
[9:49] god didn't have to use hallelujah the
[9:51] advice of chamberlain's hallelujah god
[9:54] will let your life play out knowing he's
[9:56] god almighty
[9:59] knowing hallelujah if the seed of god is
[10:02] in you there is nothing
[10:04] that can stop it from coming forward
[10:06] [Applause]
[10:10] amen we look at our life and we say why
[10:12] does this happen and why that happened
[10:14] because god is unlocking a mystery
[10:18] and he let hallelujah the mystery of
[10:20] faith be unlocked right before their
[10:22] eyes as he protects that seed of faith
[10:25] hallelujah and then he tells the man
[10:28] give back his wife are you a good damn
[10:30] he says but god you know the integrity
[10:32] of my heart he says yeah that's why i
[10:34] didn't let you sin against me
[10:36] because i'm god almighty
[10:39] i know everything about it hallelujah
[10:41] church let's just think about how great
[10:44] god is
[10:45] amen
[10:46] now amen he gave hallelujah abraham back
[10:49] his wife and then he told that king
[10:52] hallelujah who was blameless
[10:56] the king did no wrong
[10:58] but because of who abraham was
[11:01] whoa because of what god told him god
[11:04] had to protect that seed wow
[11:07] sarah was a part of that promise so he
[11:10] couldn't let her get injected by false
[11:12] seed
[11:16] and we'll be looking at our lives
[11:18] sometimes and we say why does this
[11:20] happen why does it happen god has a plan
[11:23] he's trying to get his best out of you
[11:27] and the best way for god to get his best
[11:29] out of you is to let you go through
[11:31] something
[11:36] you know we ought to be rejoicing
[11:38] because we're going through trials we're
[11:40] going through tribulation we ought to be
[11:42] rejoicing the bible says count it all
[11:44] joy when you fall
[11:50] when you fall into darwin's temptation
[11:52] you're supposed to say thank you lord
[11:55] but you look at it he told that king he
[11:56] said hey
[11:58] restore the man back his wife
[12:00] and let him yeah that liar let him pray
[12:04] for you
[12:06] because he's my prophet
[12:08] god wasn't even looking at the life oh
[12:12] hell yeah all god was looking at was
[12:14] what he told abraham you are the father
[12:17] of faith
[12:18] god's not worried about what's going on
[12:20] in the middle of your life he's your
[12:22] beginning and he's your end
[12:28] everything in the middle is orchestrated
[12:30] to make you stronger
[12:34] and look what he did
[12:36] even in abraham and you know holly they
[12:38] had the son amen
[12:40] they had the son that god promised him
[12:42] hallelujah and look sarah who was an
[12:45] unbeliever in in that first moments she
[12:48] laughed about it but god dealt with her
[12:50] in such a way she named her son isaac
[12:54] why does she name him isaac isaac means
[12:56] laughter
[13:00] hallelujah will you go back and read it
[13:02] sarah said god has made me laugh
[13:06] because when the doctors were saying you
[13:08] won't be able to have a child holy god
[13:10] said i'm god almighty
[13:13] when the doctors were saying holy that
[13:15] the womb is buried god said i'm god
[13:18] almighty
[13:20] when everybody was saying that abraham
[13:21] was too old i was saying i'm god
[13:24] almighty
[13:25] i don't care what the doctors are
[13:27] telling you you have to realize he's god
[13:29] almighty
[13:34] hallelujah
[13:36] but then i loves when he gets down to
[13:37] jacob hallelujah and jacob hallelujah
[13:40] yes he doesn't even realize he's a
[13:43] product of the promise god gave abraham
[13:46] hallelujah and his life is going to be
[13:49] controlled by the promise god gave
[13:51] abraham
[13:52] you know what that promise did that
[13:54] promise made him
[13:55] lose his relationship with his brothers
[14:00] oh
[14:01] you thought you was gonna just serve the
[14:03] lord and everything was just gonna be
[14:05] all right no
[14:06] god is proving his word
[14:10] hallelujah you think about a church
[14:12] because of the promise god almighty made
[14:16] abraham jacob's life was in a whirlwind
[14:20] hallelujah he didn't know why he was
[14:23] sitting at home with mama in the kitchen
[14:25] cooking
[14:27] his brother outside hunting you know
[14:28] they probably looked at him and said man

[14:50] the different stuff that they captured
[14:51] and this and that this and that and
[14:53] jacob sit back stir in the pot holly
[14:56] you know what it is sometimes god has
[14:58] you all to yourself just because he
[15:01] wants to stir up the pot
[15:02] hallelujah some of you got all of the
[15:04] proper ingredients but it's laying on
[15:06] the bottom of the pot honey and you
[15:08] sisters know holly we just had some of
[15:10] the best chili hallelujah in the whole
[15:13] wide world
[15:15] but it's no good sitting at the bottom
[15:17] of the pot the pot had to be stirred
[15:19] hallelujah
[15:21] and the hotter it gets the more you got
[15:24] the story of hallelujah because if you
[15:25] don't it will stick hallelujah
[15:30] oh my and god is tired of some of you
[15:32] coming to church and sticking to the pot
[15:36] [Applause]
[15:39] he's going to let it get hotter and
[15:41] hotter and hotter what is he trying to
[15:43] do he's trying to set you free
[15:47] and you know when that pot reaches the
[15:49] right temperature it's hot it's boiling
[15:52] all the ingredients they're so free
[15:54] they're bubbling
[15:56] everybody wants to show what's in the
[15:58] pot you got beans in there
[16:00] you got bell peppers in the head you got
[16:03] onions in there everything that's in the
[16:05] pot is trying to show itself
[16:08] and that's why god allows the pot to get
[16:11] hot because god hallelujah wants to show
[16:14] what's in this atmosphere
[16:15] [Applause]
[16:18] hallelujah
[16:19] what do you think about jacob's whole
[16:21] life
[16:22] it was a mystery to him
[16:24] because of what god was doing on the
[16:26] inside
[16:27] he lost his relationship with his
[16:29] brothers
[16:30] he lost his confidence with his daddy
[16:32] because he told him a lie but you know
[16:33] he had on his side his mama
[16:37] his mama before the foundation of the
[16:39] world hallelujah
[16:41] she was ordained
[16:43] to help her son
[16:44] tell a lie
[16:52] that was her purpose
[16:55] to help trick her profit
[16:57] husband
[16:59] because he wouldn't be able to do it
[17:01] without his mom
[17:03] sisters don't sell yourself short
[17:05] earlier there is a purpose for you in
[17:07] your life hallelujah you say well i'm
[17:10] just a i'm just a homebody hallelujah
[17:12] there are qualities that you are giving
[17:14] out at home that will be with your
[17:16] children for the rest of their life
[17:20] jacob would have never gotten that birth
[17:22] right jacob would have never gotten the
[17:24] holy ghost without the help of his
[17:26] mother
[17:28] oh
[17:29] and you moms heard earlier you are put
[17:32] in a position over these children
[17:34] hallelujah because your life is an
[17:36] influence on them and without you some
[17:39] of your children will never get the holy
[17:41] ghost
[17:44] hallelujah and you know church he lost
[17:48] his relationship with his brother
[17:49] hallelujah his daddy was looking at him
[17:51] funny because he got tricked hallelujah
[17:53] and then he had to run for his life
[17:56] but as he's running
[17:57] god is unlocking another mystery
[18:00] hallelujah he goes down in layman's
[18:02] house he sees a young lady he falls in
[18:04] love he says i got to have a hallelujah
[18:06] but then when he gets married i'm going
[18:08] kind of fast cause i'm trying to get
[18:09] somewhere
[18:10] then when he gets married hallelujah he
[18:12] gets a woman that he didn't want
[18:18] he gets a woman that he didn't want
[18:21] that's why it's very important
[18:22] hallelujah when you pray by these things
[18:25] be specific to god
[18:30] we got all the examples in the scripture
[18:33] church realize this jacob did not love
[18:37] leah
[18:41] she was a product of the promise god
[18:44] gave abraham
[18:48] he was in love with rachel hallelujah
[18:50] but you know what jacob said hallelujah
[18:53] you know you think about some of some of
[18:55] us some of us young ladies who've been
[18:57] single so long or young brothers have
[18:58] been single so long you be like lord
[19:01] i just need me a good church man
[19:05] no amens day what y'all looking for
[19:10] what y'all looking for i know you ain't
[19:11] looking for no hip-hop gangster
[19:18] at least at least let that be a part of
[19:20] your prayer
[19:22] but don't let that be the whole just of
[19:24] it
[19:25] because you you can get exactly what you
[19:28] ask god because he's god almighty he
[19:30] will give you your heart's desire you
[19:32] say lord i just need me a good church
[19:34] man and he'll come to church and be
[19:37] faithful hallelujah but at home he'll
[19:40] have emotional issues
[19:42] at home he may not provide for his
[19:45] family but he'll be faithful going to
[19:46] church because that's what you asked for
[19:49] but all that other stuff he may be
[19:51] lacking because you didn't ask god for a
[19:53] complete package
[19:56] [Applause]
[19:58] say lord i want a man who's going to go
[20:00] to church who's going to love the word
[20:02] and love me like you love the
[20:04] church hallelujah i want a man
[20:07] hallelujah that's going to put you first
[20:09] hallelujah and then his family check it
[20:12] because if he put you first hungry the
[20:14] next thing in line is automatically you
[20:17] [Applause]
[20:20] but so many times we go to god in prayer
[20:23] and we're not specific and then we get
[20:25] what god what we ask for and we're
[20:27] looking at god what is this
[20:28] [Music]
[20:31] what is this you say you asked for a
[20:33] good church man you didn't ask for
[20:35] somebody who loved the lord
[20:41] and he'll sinner this message for years
[20:43] and years and years because he's a good
[20:45] church man
[20:47] but never fell in love with god and then
[20:49] all of a sudden he's uprooting you and
[20:52] the whole family bouncing for church to
[20:54] church because he's a good church man
[21:00] oh my but when you ask for a full
[21:03] package lord i want somebody who's in
[21:05] love with you
[21:08] he can see those gifts in the ministry
[21:10] of god he can see the love of god in the
[21:13] people of god hallelujah and god is love
[21:17] [Applause]
[21:20] and you know god showed me a lesson
[21:21] about this a long time ago about being
[21:24] specific in prayer
[21:26] you know we say oh lord please
[21:29] father i just need me a piece of car
[21:32] just a piece of car
[21:34] something to get back and forth to work
[21:36] a piece of car
[21:38] and now what you get a piece of junk
[21:43] every time you turn around it's in the
[21:44] shop
[21:46] every time you look something got to be
[21:48] done to it
[21:49] and be like lord i pray for a car no you
[21:52] pray for a piece of car
[21:56] and that's what you got because god
[21:59] always gives you
[22:01] what you asked for
[22:05] hallelujah so you know me
[22:08] i'm just way out there i'm i'm i'm a
[22:10] different kind of believer
[22:13] i'm a different kind of message believer

[22:17] and i say y'all know that belong to me
[22:19] you know that rolls royce belongs to me
[22:22] hallelujah you know that maserati
[22:24] belongs to me you know that 3 000 square
[22:27] foot house with the fogar garage belongs
[22:30] to me
[22:32] hallelujah
[22:33] why can't we believe like that he's
[22:35] still hallelujah god
[22:38] almighty but what we do is we put on
[22:41] this false humility because we believe
[22:43] people are looking at us
[22:45] [Music]
[22:46] i can't i can't drive that to church why
[22:49] not
[22:51] god gave it to you
[22:57] [Music]
[23:04] y'all heard me say this before
[23:05] hallelujah
[23:07] i got no problem celebrating what god
[23:09] has blessed me
[23:12] hallelujah
[23:13] if god has did it i'm going to give him
[23:16] praise
[23:18] but you look at what god did all the way
[23:20] through that church jacob's life
[23:22] hallelujah
[23:24] he was a product of the promise god gave
[23:27] to abraham and now god is constantly
[23:30] locking up
[23:31] unlocking mysteries hallelujah that they
[23:33] didn't even know they were a part of now
[23:35] jacob goes down in the labor's house he
[23:37] sees one girl and he gets two of you and
[23:40] he says you know what i'm gonna work
[23:41] another seven years because i got to
[23:43] have a holiday and you know what
[23:44] hollywood leah said you know what i'm so
[23:47] sick of you i'm gonna stop pushing our
[23:49] babies
[23:51] and leah starts to push our babies
[23:53] healthier and then rachel gets mad she
[23:55] says i'll give her my hands made hands
[23:57] may stop putting out babies and leah
[23:59] says you know what i got a hands made
[24:01] too her hands may stop pushing out
[24:03] babies now it looks like there's four
[24:05] women fighting over one man
[24:09] hallelujah but what is it god's
[24:11] unlocking the mystery hallelujah what
[24:13] mystery the mystery of the hundred and
[24:15] forty four thousand hallelujah hey
[24:19] jacob didn't know how it was gonna come
[24:20] about but it was there hallelujah he had
[24:23] to come through four different women
[24:25] that didn't like each other
[24:32] he's got almighty
[24:36] they looking like he my man she's like
[24:38] no he i mean i got four babies
[24:45] hallelujah but what was god doing holy
[24:48] he told abraham he said your seat is
[24:50] going to be like the stars it's going to
[24:51] be like the saints holy everywhere you
[24:53] look hallelujah it's going to reflect
[24:55] the seed of abraham and jacob was a part
[24:57] of that so his own life didn't belong to
[25:00] him
[25:01] so as god almighty what was he doing he
[25:04] was unlocking the mystery in the
[25:05] believer's life
[25:09] now we get to moses
[25:11] he's still god almighty now
[25:14] but he's gonna take it to another notch
[25:17] he comes to moses he says moses i've
[25:19] heard the cry of my people and i've come
[25:21] down to deliver them
[25:24] hallelujah and then he makes it real
[25:26] real he he he makes it real specific
[25:30] about what he's about to do he says look
[25:32] abraham isaac and jacob
[25:35] they've known me as god almighty but by
[25:38] my name jehovah
[25:41] they never knew me
[25:43] put that first quote up hardly
[25:46] hallelujah
[25:50] look
[25:50] he says but in genesis
[25:52] when he was made
[25:54] when he made man he said i am yahuwah
[25:58] yahweh jehovah
[26:01] what did it mean
[26:02] i am the all
[26:05] existing one
[26:07] who has created something off of myself
[26:12] see not only now
[26:14] is he pushing moses
[26:16] he's telling moses
[26:18] who you are
[26:20] is a part of me
[26:23] when you look in the mirror i want you
[26:25] to see me
[26:26] holy remember he says i've heard the cry
[26:29] and i've come down where was god he was
[26:32] in moses
[26:36] now he's taking the revelation of the
[26:38] believer and he's taking it a place
[26:40] higher
[26:42] he says
[26:44] something off of myself to be a son of
[26:46] mine or a temporary or amateur little
[26:50] one of mine glory why
[26:52] he gave man jehovah means
[26:55] that he gave man to be an amateur god
[27:00] before you go up hold right there
[27:03] he's telling moses
[27:05] i'm not only going to push you into your
[27:07] position
[27:08] but in this position i want you to be a
[27:10] god
[27:14] how many are you in your position
[27:17] if you are in your position you're not
[27:19] in there hallelujah as who you think you
[27:22] are
[27:24] with your public name or your name that
[27:27] came down from your father from the
[27:29] generations but no once you realize who
[27:32] you are you're in that position as a
[27:35] part of god
[27:37] so i want you to look at it a little bit
[27:39] different if you believe you're in the
[27:41] right church if you believe that brother
[27:43] paul has been called to be your pastor
[27:45] you're not looking at paul preach you're
[27:47] looking at god talk to you
[27:49] [Applause]
[27:55] and the prophet of god say that's our
[27:56] greatest challenge
[27:58] our challenge is not
[28:00] believing that god hallelujah
[28:03] can use man but believing and seeing
[28:05] that god is in man
[28:11] because we see one another's mistakes
[28:15] we see one another's huff and puffing
[28:17] when we get mad and all these things
[28:19] but now he's saying
[28:22] when you begin to know me as jehovah
[28:24] hello
[28:26] i'm going to show you hallelujah
[28:28] that you are a part of me
[28:31] and what does he do with moses
[28:33] he has to change moses thinking
[28:35] hallelujah
[28:36] he tells moses he says hey
[28:39] you going to go deliver the people and
[28:41] moses
[28:42] lord i
[28:47] lord i can't do this lord i can't dad
[28:50] lord who am i who i'm gonna and god say
[28:52] shut up moses
[28:55] stop crying to me
[28:58] go back and read your bible
[29:00] i know it's a little bit more graphic
[29:02] coming out of my mouth
[29:05] what else he told moses
[29:07] he comes to moses he says who made your
[29:09] mouth
[29:13] see he won't let him settle
[29:15] hollywood by just the mystery being
[29:18] unlocked
[29:20] he wants him to see the total the total
[29:22] scope of who he is
[29:25] and moses is looking at himself and he's
[29:27] saying i'm this i'm that i'm doing some
[29:29] that and god says be quiet moses he says
[29:31] who made your mouth
[29:33] and all these things and now god is
[29:35] gonna put moses holly he's going to
[29:37] enlighten moses and what's really going
[29:40] on
[29:41] because he's saying
[29:42] you're going to know me as jehovah
[29:45] and he says hey
[29:47] you be god
[29:49] and let aaron be your prophet
[29:52] he changed the whole microscope of it
[29:55] he said you're not going down here as
[29:57] just a prophet deliverer but you're
[29:59] going down here as a god
[30:01] and as a god everything is under your
[30:04] control
[30:06] hallelujah
[30:07] he's still jehovah
[30:10] let's keep going
[30:12] he says because he's a father god
[30:15] and he made a man an amateur god so
[30:19] he isn't self-existing anymore he exists
[30:22] with his family
[30:27] so what i'm saying this morning the head
[30:29] of this church is jehovah
[30:32] he exists with his family hallelujah
[30:36] ella ella elohim now
[30:39] he is jehovah jehovah means the one who
[30:43] exists with his family
[30:46] [Music]
[30:49] but jesus why are you saying he's still
[30:51] jehovah well let's think about it who's
[30:54] the head of the family the father
[30:58] now for those of us who are fathers
[31:01] you think about it as a father
[31:04] and my daughter no i'm finna use her as
[31:06] example
[31:08] but you know
[31:10] she's at an age now where she wants to
[31:12] drive and all these things like that
[31:15] if i ever come out of my mouth and i say
[31:18] you know what
[31:19] when you turn 18
[31:22] i'm gonna have a 500 mercedes benz
[31:23] waiting on you
[31:27] she ain't heard nothing as i said but
[31:29] 500 mercedes benz
[31:32] because those words are coming from her
[31:34] father
[31:36] the one who's taking care of her
[31:38] since she was a baby
[31:40] the one who's fed her the one who fight
[31:43] her battles all that all she sees is my
[31:45] father made me a promise
[31:50] wow she gonna come back to me and say
[31:52] daddy you got the money at
[31:54] no she's sticking with the promise
[31:57] she's not gonna come to me and say well
[31:59] daddy how you going to get it all she
[32:01] know is i made her a promise
[32:04] what about us church if he's still
[32:07] jehovah shouldn't we stick to what god
[32:09] has said
[32:12] [Applause]
[32:14] he said i'm the lord and i changed that
[32:17] now if he's still god the father he
[32:19] exists with his family that means every
[32:21] word he's given us is still relevant
[32:24] today
[32:28] all she knows when she ate 18
[32:31] she's gonna be looking at the window
[32:35] she's going to watch me see if i'm going
[32:37] someway see if i'm going to get
[32:38] something cause now she has an
[32:39] expectation based upon the promise i
[32:42] gave
[32:44] hallelujah
[32:46] that's the god we serve
[32:48] if he steals jehovah you should have an
[32:50] expectation based upon the promises god
[32:53] has made
[32:56] he said i'll never leave you nor forsake
[32:59] you
[33:00] you know what i'm in a place now where
[33:02] i'm not just looking for blessings i'm
[33:04] looking for the bountiful blessing
[33:07] he said press down shaken together he
[33:10] said prove me hallelujah
[33:12] he said it'll be so much that you won't
[33:14] even be able to contain it
[33:18] he's still jehovah
[33:22] church i went to the bank
[33:26] because i need to move
[33:29] and i went there and
[33:31] people look at my account they look at
[33:32] all the stuff
[33:34] he said before we do anything you got to
[33:36] come up with 17 dollars
[33:39] and looking at my account
[33:40] the man said where you gonna get it from
[33:43] i'm like
[33:44] you just get the loan going
[33:46] you get the loan going my god will take
[33:49] care of the rest
[33:51] but see they don't see what we see
[33:53] well he's looking at his w-2 forms and
[33:55] tax
[33:56] tax returns and all these things i'm not
[33:58] looking at that i'm looking at the
[34:00] promise
[34:02] so what my account doesn't reflect 17
[34:05] holly in the natural but it does in the
[34:07] spirit
[34:10] you say well brothers how can you how
[34:12] can you go into something like that
[34:14] because my subtitle is i've seen them do
[34:17] it
[34:21] i've seen him do it hallelujah
[34:23] amen i've seen god do things hallelujah
[34:26] that was just
[34:27] miraculous amen
[34:29] you know there's a sister that came to
[34:31] our church hallelujah
[34:33] hey man she's a good good good good
[34:35] friend of ours from london hey man she
[34:38] came to the church and she started
[34:39] telling a testimony about finding a job
[34:42] anybody need a job
[34:44] talk to me now
[34:46] i'm gonna tell you how to get it hardly
[34:49] remember he steal jehovah
[34:52] she said lord i didn't fill out a
[34:53] hundred applications
[34:55] a hundred
[34:57] she said all i need is just one person
[34:58] to call me back
[35:00] hallelujah
[35:01] and then she had one person to call and
[35:03] this is a very high profile job honey
[35:06] they called back they said come on we
[35:07] want you to come in for the interview
[35:09] she passed the interview they said okay
[35:11] now there are tests you have to take
[35:12] colleen and the first test had to deal
[35:15] with math and she's like i'm not that
[35:16] good at man
[35:18] not at all i'm not that good at math she
[35:20] said but lord i'm trusting you she said
[35:22] she looked at some of the questions some
[35:24] of the some of the different problems
[35:25] and stuff and she's like i don't know
[35:27] none of this stuff she said but that's
[35:28] what i'm gonna do lord i'm gonna trust
[35:30] you
[35:31] and she bowed her head and she prayed
[35:34] and she said lord i want you to guide my
[35:36] hand to every answer
[35:38] and from that moment after the prayer
[35:40] she didn't even look at the problems
[35:50] what was that
[35:51] that same fate that god gave abraham as
[35:54] god almighty is still in the believer's
[35:57] life when he reveals himself as jehovah
[36:01] so what she did hallelujah y'all ever
[36:03] did this in school she went a
[36:05] b
[36:06] c
[36:07] d
[36:08] d
[36:09] c
[36:10] a
[36:10] b
[36:13] she did that the whole test
[36:15] believing that god was guiding her hand
[36:18] she wasn't even looking at the questions
[36:21] she didn't even look at the problems
[36:23] what was she doing she was depending on
[36:26] jehovah
[36:27] one who exists with his family
[36:30] so you know what church what she did
[36:31] after the test she folded it up and sent
[36:33] it in harley went home and she was
[36:36] waiting on a call harley it was it was
[36:38] like four other women taking the same
[36:40] test
[36:41] when they called they called her back
[36:43] and they said you pass
[36:46] they say but you didn't just pass you
[36:49] made a perfect score
[36:52] [Applause]
[36:56] he's still jehovah god
[36:59] he's still jehovah
[37:02] he'll let you pass the test even when
[37:04] you're going into his blind
[37:06] [Applause]
[37:09] hallelujah
[37:10] but it wasn't done
[37:12] because he's the head of the family
[37:13] hallelujah
[37:14] church she had another interview for the
[37:17] same job now she said they said you
[37:19] scored higher than anybody ever scored
[37:21] why because god took the test
[37:25] where was god he was in her
[37:28] [Applause]
[37:33] all you got to do is turn it over to him
[37:35] church
[37:36] holly
[37:38] then the next interview was some kind of
[37:39] personality interview
[37:41] what she got there they actually all
[37:42] kind of questions what would you do in
[37:43] this situation blah blah blah so the
[37:45] interviewer said
[37:47] she said now you have questions
[37:49] based upon
[37:51] personality or whatever it was
[37:53] and you got to come up with the answers
[37:55] so the interviewer said when they ask
[37:58] you this question
[37:59] this is what you say
[38:03] when they ask you the next question this
[38:05] is what you say
[38:07] so for every question the interviewer
[38:10] gave her all the answers
[38:17] church when god do something he does it
[38:23] and she wasn't even worthy pretty much
[38:25] of getting a job hallelujah but god made
[38:28] sure she got the job amen
[38:31] because he's the one who exists with his
[38:33] family if god ever gives you a promise
[38:35] he's going to make it come to pass
[38:38] hallelujah and you think about it amen
[38:40] if he's a father he has to be a husband
[38:43] amen
[38:44] hallelujah and if he's a husband that
[38:46] means he has to be a provider
[38:49] hallelujah god is still a provider
[38:54] you know why i can believe god for
[38:55] seventeen thousand dollars
[38:57] you know why i can believe him for that
[38:59] because i know of another brother
[39:00] brother tony he may have known i'm
[39:01] talking about holly
[39:03] i i know another brother him and his
[39:04] wife was praying about a house and y'all
[39:06] may have heard this this testimony but
[39:08] we need to put it out then yeah
[39:09] honey he's believing this him and him
[39:12] and his wife is believing for her house
[39:14] and they had the deal and the deal fell
[39:16] through
[39:17] and from that moment every morning a
[39:19] certain time she used to get up out of
[39:20] the bed go into another room and pray
[39:22] and the husband didn't realize what was
[39:24] going on he said he'd wake up and she'd
[39:26] be gone but one morning he followed she
[39:28] was in the other room praying
[39:29] she did that for two years
[39:33] cause she was wondering lord why did you
[39:34] let this fall through
[39:36] she's like we were right there why would
[39:38] you let this fall through let me tell
[39:40] you if something fall through that mean
[39:41] god has something better in store
[39:46] hallelujah
[39:47] he got something better in store
[39:50] don't get discouraged he's still jehovah
[39:53] if he's a father he has to be a husband
[39:59] so harlow his her husband was a a
[40:01] minister
[40:03] and their pastor had to go overseas and
[40:05] preach
[40:06] but the pastor couldn't go
[40:08] so the pastor told him to go
[40:10] so he went to this church and he
[40:12] preached and had a good time this and
[40:13] that blah blah blah just being in his
[40:16] position
[40:17] hallelujah
[40:18] so when he was getting ready to leave
[40:20] the brother he preached for he said hey
[40:22] uh you got children he said yes he said
[40:24] he like candy he says yes he says i'm
[40:26] gonna put a bag of candy in your luggage
[40:29] so he gave him a brown paper bag full up
[40:31] with candy
[40:33] he gets home his wife in her position
[40:35] starts to unpack the clothes and she
[40:38] says honey what is this she said she
[40:39] said that's just a bag of candy
[40:42] for the children so she starts to
[40:44] unravel the bag and she comes back she
[40:46] says oh honey
[40:48] oh
[40:50] honey this ain't no candy honey this is
[40:53] a bag of money honey hallelujah church
[40:56] it wasn't just a little bit of money it
[40:58] was 350 000 dollars
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:06] and you want to tell me don't believe
[41:07] jehovah for 17.
[41:11] holy
[41:13] that brother hallelujah that gave him
[41:14] the candy he said lord see god is always
[41:17] working on both ends he said lord if you
[41:20] blessed me with this business deal i
[41:22] paid a tithing to the first brother that
[41:24] come and preach for us hallelujah and
[41:26] because god knew who he had to go to he
[41:29] made it where the pastor couldn't go
[41:30] hollywood so where the evangelist in the
[41:32] church could go why because he needed to
[41:35] build a house
[41:39] he was ready to move
[41:40] [Applause]
[41:46] and not only did his wife get the house
[41:48] she won't
[41:50] whoa you told my billy the house this
[41:53] house she built she built a house with a
[41:55] swimming pool indoors
[42:03] he's god
[42:06] he's still jehovah
[42:09] church
[42:10] i've seen them do it
[42:11] i've seen god unlock things that
[42:13] shouldn't be unlocked
[42:15] but because he's god me and a friend of
[42:17] mine we were going to a men's meeting
[42:19] one time and you know we stopped at a
[42:21] gas station and we were like hey i'm
[42:23] gonna pay for the gas he was like no i'm
[42:24] gonna pay for the guy i'll say i'm gonna
[42:25] pay for that no i'm gonna be able to get
[42:28] somebody's running inside the stove to
[42:30] pay for the gas
[42:31] not realizing that his doors were going
[42:33] to lock automatically
[42:35] with the keys in the ignition
[42:39] it's on the door lock
[42:40] and both was out there looking at each
[42:42] other like we crazy because we are going

[49:58] get out of the way

[50:06] a debate with brother um
[50:09] what was what was the old dog man
[50:13] the man he had debate with we wanted to
[50:15] fight him
[50:17] dr best thank you brother
[50:19] he was having a debate with dr best
[50:22] and brother branham asked him a question
[50:25] he actually
[50:26] was the redemptive names of jehovah
[50:29] in the covenant
[50:32] and dr bess couldn't ask the question
[50:34] well he could
[50:35] but if he would have said yes that means
[50:38] that he's jehovah rapha
[50:42] and we got a right to be a healer
[50:43] hallelujah
[50:45] so if he's jehovah rapha that means he's
[50:47] jehovah jairo

[50:52] provider and a healer amen hallelujah
[50:55] he's jehovah nisi amen he's a better
[50:57] he's a shield he's all that he's overra
[51:02] hallelujah he can't be one without the

[51:09] hallelujah you got the same access to
[51:11] healing
[51:13] if he's your healing help you you got
[51:15] the same access to him being a provider
[51:18] if he's your provider you got the same
[51:20] access as him being a protector
[51:23] he's jehovah and every avenue
[51:28] hallelujah he can't be one without being
[51:31] the other
[51:33] [Applause]
[51:35] but it's according to your need this
[51:37] morning
[51:39] hallelujah
[51:43] churchill i've seen myself what i
[51:45] consider to be on the short end of the
[51:46] stick
[51:48] a lot of times
[51:50] but it's god
[51:53] it's god right there
[51:55] holly
[51:56] unlocking unfolding and blessing all at
[51:59] the same time
[52:01] while we look at it and say why am i
[52:02] going through this why is this happening
[52:04] why is that happening he's still jehovah
[52:09] because church the children of israel
[52:12] the children of israel heard moses say
[52:14] i've come to deliver god has sent me and
[52:18] boy they got they got hyped
[52:20] they were like oh why are we gonna get
[52:22] out of here yeah
[52:25] they were ready
[52:27] and then they got that first opportunity
[52:29] god came down doing signs and wonders
[52:31] through moses and the people bagged up
[52:33] they still was ready and pharaoh said
[52:35] just sit down you ain't going nowhere
[52:38] and they were like
[52:40] just all the air went out of their cell
[52:44] and look at it he did that at least nine
[52:47] to ten times
[52:52] and the people hollering they start to
[52:54] lose their confidence in what moses said
[52:58] but what they was failing to realize
[53:00] they were losing their confidence in
[53:02] what god said
[53:04] holy
[53:04] and to the place they got to the place
[53:06] to where they start complaining about
[53:08] supernatural things god was doing
[53:11] can you imagine isaac they sit there
[53:13] eating supernatural food from hell from
[53:15] from from heaven and then they say our
[53:18] souls loathe with this light brain
[53:21] god told me
[53:24] they eating bread from heaven
[53:26] holly they even cook fish from heaven
[53:29] hallelujah and they start complaining
[53:32] why because god wasn't doing it the way
[53:34] they expected it
[53:36] but let me tell you something
[53:38] the way god does it
[53:40] nine times out of ten is always the best
[53:42] way
[53:46] hallelujah
[53:47] so you look at a church
[53:49] they get to a place to where they're not
[53:51] even believing moses anymore they're
[53:52] just out there they just going to church
[53:56] they just going to church they don't
[53:57] even believe that there's a real
[53:58] deliverance
[54:00] you think about how many people
[54:01] hallelujah because we've said that
[54:04] there's going to be a rapture at least a
[54:06] thousand years now
[54:10] we've been hearing by the rapture at
[54:11] least a thousand years
[54:13] and now you got people who say ah
[54:15] rapture man please they didn't believe
[54:17] in the prophet no more why because it
[54:19] hasn't happened in their time
[54:22] but you know god god is a god who loves
[54:25] to prove you
[54:27] holy he said i've led you the way of the
[54:30] wilderness to prove you and see what was
[54:33] really in your heart
[54:35] that's why god allows a pandemic to come
[54:38] to see who really loves him
[54:41] to see who's going to press through what
[54:43] all the naysayers are saying and still
[54:46] come back to church
[54:49] but not only come back to church be
[54:51] happy you're here
[54:55] and you don't have restrictions on your
[54:57] fellowship
[55:00] can't shake nobody's hand cause uh uh
[55:02] you know there's a pandemic
[55:04] foolishness oh my
[55:08] that's my lawn
[55:11] see i'm mindful
[55:18] but you think about it god allow these
[55:19] things to happen to seek who you to show
[55:22] you who you really are
[55:24] he knows who you are
[55:26] so he let them come out hallelujah and
[55:28] all these different things and just like
[55:29] he did us he gave us a pandemic that
[55:31] shut down the whole world just to see
[55:34] who was going to stay faithful
[55:38] just to see when the opportunity to
[55:39] present himself who was going to stay
[55:41] home hallelujah and be able to control
[55:43] brother diggs i don't like that
[55:46] subject oh he's talking about me
[55:50] honey just cut that off
[55:58] he put the remote in your hand
[56:00] to see what you gonna do with it
[56:03] and it's sad to say that some people
[56:04] have gotten so over charged with the
[56:06] atmosphere of the pandemic they've
[56:08] forgotten that this is just a test
[56:15] this is just the test to see who you
[56:17] really are
[56:18] hallelujah
[56:20] but for those hallelujah who stayed true
[56:22] to what moses was saying hallelujah
[56:24] there was a day coming hallelujah and
[56:26] i'm gonna end with this one what paul
[56:27] was saying honey moses is in the whole
[56:30] church because now he's jehovah man he's
[56:32] not just god almighty they're standing
[56:34] at a red sea two million of them maybe
[56:38] and they're wondering how are we gonna
[56:39] get over this hallelujah what they
[56:41] should have been saying god is able
[56:46] look at your bills and you ought to be
[56:48] saying god is able
[56:50] look at your health and you ought to be
[56:52] saying god is able look at your family
[56:55] and you ought to be saying god is able
[57:02] we don't live in present conditions we
[57:05] live by the word
[57:09] we don't live hallelujah in the moment
[57:12] we live by prophecy
[57:15] hallelujah
[57:17] we live by prophecy church
[57:21] the moment is only a shadow
[57:25] hallelujah
[57:27] church
[57:28] not until the place that the rest don't
[57:30] get nervous don't about the clothes
[57:32] now they had the red sea
[57:33] hallelujah
[57:34] and everybody's wondering
[57:37] what we gonna do
[57:39] they should have said with god and gave
[57:41] us food from heaven
[57:45] not just food from heaven but food that
[57:48] nobody else has ever tasted
[57:52] we're eating a revelation that
[57:54] denominations have never ever tasted
[57:57] earlier
[57:58] we got food on our plate that has never
[58:01] been in the stores
[58:06] it ain't even on the bookshelf in your
[58:08] best christian store
[58:12] because this is something earlier that
[58:14] you can only get from our father's table
[58:19] [Applause]
[58:20] that's what they should have been saying
[58:22] they should have been saying i don't
[58:23] know but if he gave us water out of a
[58:26] rock
[58:29] think about that
[58:31] they didn't have no shovels and stuff to
[58:33] deal with god told moses go to that rock
[58:35] and speak to it
[58:38] hallelujah see god was already grooming
[58:41] moses trying to get moses to speak
[58:44] but moses so caught up with the people
[58:45] he wanna hit something
[58:52] church
[58:53] hallelujah
[58:55] now he's standing there
[58:57] in the water god so faithful
[58:59] god lets water come forth church
[59:02] not just any water
[59:04] but they were drinking water that nobody
[59:06] else has ever drank
[59:12] we're drinking from a fountain
[59:14] that nobody has ever tasted
[59:18] he's still jehovah
[59:21] and now he gets to holly
[59:23] the red sea
[59:25] and moses is so
[59:27] worried about the people and all the
[59:28] stuff he said god you brought these
[59:30] people this and this and that and all
[59:32] this and and they crying and all that
[59:34] stuff and this and that god you know
[59:35] what he did again he told moses shut up
[59:37] moses
[59:44] that's all some of us do we cry a bunch
[59:46] of crybabies
[59:50] oh god i thought i was really a saint
[59:53] i've been serving you and why am i going
[59:55] through all this because he wants you to
[59:57] be perfect
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:04] and moses is crying and this and that
[1:00:06] god says shut up moses
[1:00:09] speak
[1:00:10] and move forward
[1:00:15] but what i love about that whole story
[1:00:18] it looked like the red sea was the
[1:00:20] problem
[1:00:23] red sea wasn't the problem
[1:00:26] the problem was what was behind them
[1:00:29] and like he said before he came up holly
[1:00:32] don't let your past put you on the run
[1:00:36] don't let your past lead you to a place
[1:00:39] hallelujah where you don't have no ouch
[1:00:43] they're running from the past of egypt
[1:00:46] and moses god tell moses to speak
[1:00:48] hallelujah moses says stand still harley
[1:00:52] and see the salvation of the lord now
[1:00:55] he's not even talking to the sea but he
[1:00:57] says the egyptians whom you see you
[1:00:59] shall see him no more forever
[1:01:04] and when moses said that the sea heard
[1:01:07] it hallelujah and the sea start moving
[1:01:13] so god has things in your place ready to
[1:01:16] open up once you deal with your past
[1:01:22] when you deal with your past god already
[1:01:25] got the doors open to your future
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:01:34] and in that moment to see heard god
[1:01:36] speak to the enemy knowing that
[1:01:38] hallelujah the sea was the only thing
[1:01:40] that could destroy the egyptians forever
[1:01:44] but it was already in the path of the
[1:01:46] believers
[1:01:49] the thing to deliver you is already in
[1:01:51] your path
[1:01:54] you just got to say the right thing
[1:01:58] church
[1:01:58] holy
[1:01:59] and then they go through the red sea
[1:02:01] they didn't walk through mud
[1:02:03] dry ground
[1:02:07] dry ground
[1:02:08] before i close
[1:02:10] listen
[1:02:11] god said when joseph
[1:02:13] holly i mean when joshua led the church
[1:02:16] back to the jordan
[1:02:17] he said it was the highest times for the
[1:02:19] tithe
[1:02:20] he said why would god lead that way
[1:02:23] at the highest times
[1:02:24] he said but joshua had to be confident
[1:02:26] in what god said
[1:02:28] he said yeah joshua had to check the
[1:02:30] list say lord you told me to be strong
[1:02:32] and very courageous check
[1:02:35] logic told me not to bow down to any
[1:02:36] other man check lord you told me not to
[1:02:38] have no babylonians garments check and
[1:02:41] all josh had to do is go down his
[1:02:42] checklist of everything that god told
[1:02:44] him to do and if he did that everything
[1:02:47] brother branham said now joshua looking
[1:02:49] at his checklist not as checklist but he
[1:02:51] said now joshua looking at everything
[1:02:52] god told him to do and if he had did his
[1:02:55] part holy the next step belongs to god
[1:03:02] have you done everything you're supposed
[1:03:03] to do
[1:03:04] according to what god has asked you to
[1:03:07] do the next step belongs to god
[1:03:10] holly don't you worry the next step
[1:03:12] belongs to god amen and as soon as they
[1:03:15] stepped in the water the water started
[1:03:17] to move
[1:03:20] but the key to the whole thing
[1:03:23] what you gonna do after god give you the
[1:03:25] blessing
[1:03:32] after you see that he steal jehovah
[1:03:34] how does that change your life
